<HEAD>African Nations Say South Africa Endangers Namibia's Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   African nations on Wednesday appealed to
the Security Council to foil alleged attempts by South Africa to rig
the outcome of Namibia's pre-independence elections in November.
   The African nations told a special council meeting that South
Africa was trying to stop the South-West Africa People's
Organization, known as SWAPO, from taking power.
   Ghana's ambassador, James V. Gbeho, called on the Security
Council to adopt a new resolution giving the United Nations interim
control over Namibia, rather than the South African
administrator-general for Namibia.
   But South African U.N. representative, Jeremy Shearar, said SWAPO
was the real threat to Namibian independence.
   In response to criticism of the continued South African presence
in Namibia, South Africa said Tuesday it was confining former
members of a feared police unit to base for retraining.
   But Gbeho said it was not good enough to place former members of
the Koevoet police under U.N. supervision. He said the veterans, who
have been integrated into the South African-led Namibian police,
should be fired.
   Ghana's ambassador also said the proposed election laws are
unfair because they allow white South Africans who worked or were
born in Namibia to register to vote there.
   Gbeho also objected to proposed Namibian laws that disqualify
those convicted of crimes, including treason and sedition, from
voting or being candidates for the constituent assembly. He said
these provisions would bar many SWAPO leaders from running for
assembly seats, and prevent SWAPO activists from voting.
   SWAPO has accused South Africa of trying to manipulate November's
pre-independence elections, which it is expected to win.
   Shearar said it was a ``great pity'' the Security Council had
been convened by the Africans.
   He said fewer than 2,300 South Africans with Namibian citizenship
had registered to vote so far. Up to 700,000 people are expected to
vote.
   Shearar said SWAPO poses the true threat to Namibian
independence. He said that 1,900 armed SWAPO guerrillas entered
Namibia from Angola the day the U.N.-backed peace plan went into
effect on April 1.
   Hundreds of guerrillas and dozens of soldiers and police died in
subsequent fighting between SWAPO and the South African-led security
forces.

   A man who allegedly told a co-worker he was
``bored with life'' and that he was going to Burbank to shoot
KNBC-TV news anchorwoman Kelly Lange pleaded innocent Tuesday to a
terrorism charge.
   Warren Sevy Hudson, 57, was ordered held on $50,000 bail after he
pleaded innocent to one felony count of making a terrorist threat,
said Deputy District Attorney James David Jacobs.
   Hudson was arrested Friday after a co-worker at the downtown
precious metals exchange where he worked reported hearing him
threaten to kill Ms. Lange, Jacobs said.
   He told the co-worker that he was ``bored with life and that he
was going to Burbank to shoot Kelly Lange,'' Jacobs said.
   Hudson allegedly made the threat Wednesday, the day before he was
fired from his job.
   Hudson wrote letters, made telephone calls and sent gifts to Ms.
Lange for the last five years, Jacobs said. The gifts were returned
and she never met or spoke to Hudson, the prosecutor said.
   ``He was despondent. He felt she didn't understand him,'' Jacobs
said. ``He apparently had this love affair with her in his mind for
several years.''
   The case is the latest in a recent series of attacks or
harassment of celebrities by fans. Among them was the slaying last
month of actress Rebecca Schaeffer, allegedly killed by an Arizona
man described by police as an obsessed fan.
   A KNBC executive contacted the district attorney's office
Thursday to report the threat, prompting police to locate Hudson and
make the arrest the following day, authorities said.
   A .38-caliber pistol and ammunition were found in the motel room
where Hudson was arrested, police said.
   Ms. Lange and KNBC officials declined to comment on the case.
   A preliminary hearing for Hudson was scheduled for Aug. 25.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will travel to the
United States to meet with President Bush next month, the Japanese
government announced Thursday.
   An official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Kaifu will
meet with President Bush in Washington on Sept. 1. The government
has not yet confirmed details of the trip.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama will accompany Kaifu, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At the meeting, Kaifu will reaffirm his government's commitment
to maintaining good relations with the United States, the official
said.
   This will be the first time for the two leaders to meet and also
Kaifu's first meeting with a foreign leader since becoming prime
minister on Aug. 9.
   The 58-year-old Kaifu took Japan's highest office after Sousuke
Uno stepped down to take responsibility for the governing Liberal
Democrats' crushing setback in parliamentary elections last month.
   A U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
President Bush will interrupt a holiday at his home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, to meet with Kaifu.

<HEAD>State Says Ad To Make Chicago Tourism Boom Shows Too Much Bust</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may be art, but Illinois tourism officials
couldn't believe their eyes when an ad featuring an Alberto Vargas
watercolor of a nude woman fondling her breasts beckoned Europeans
to visit Chicago.
   Portrayed on the other side of the Atlantic as home to seamy
politics, bluesy music and gangsters, the city has long been viewed
as a wide-open town. But this time, city and state officials
concurred, someone went too far.
   ``We think there are a lot greater things that portray Chicago
better than a nude lady,'' said Avis LaVelle, spokeswoman for Mayor
Richard M. Daley.
   ``I'm sorry it happened,'' Gov. James R. Thompson said, ``but it
wasn't our fault.''
   Developed for the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community
Affairs by the Milan, Italy-based STZ agency, the ad featuring
``Legacy Nude No. 1'' was part of a 13-week campaign running in the
European editions of Newsweek and Time.
   The campaign touts the city's world-class architecture, museums
and business institutions, the Lake Michigan shoreline, its varied
sports and vibrant nightlife.
   The Vargas painting was used in an ad promoting the city's
magazine publishing community and was accompanied by copy inviting
Europeans to ``Come to the city where Life was created. (And
Playboy, too.)'' and proclaiming ``A city once famous for its hogs
gives birth to a bunny.''
   Vargas' famous ``Varga Girl'' paintings appeared in Esquire
(which also got its start in Chicago) and later Playboy from the
1930s through the 1960s. His works also are held by a number of
private collectors.
   State officials recognized the Vargas painting was art, but they
also knew they didn't like it as advertising.
   ``I don't like to censor anything, and it was a picture done by a
world-famous Chicago artist of another time,'' Thompson said.
   ``But I thought the ad would be controversial and I didn't want
folks talking about the ad. I wanted them talking about Chicago, so
I said no, we are not going to run that.''
   State officials subsequently contacted both magazines and
directed them not to publish the ad.
   But a production assistant at Time inadvertently picked up the
wrong copy and some 400,000 readers of the magazine's European
edition received the unauthorized invitation, according to Marianne
Floriano, a spokeswoman for the state commerce department.
   Thompson said Time officials apologized and agreed not to charge
the state for the ad.
   But Playboy spokeswoman Terry Tomcisin suggested the flap was
much ado about nothing.
   ``We started here, we are the best-selling men's magazine in the
world and Vargas' association with Playboy goes back a long way,''
she said. ``I think this whole thing just highlights the discrepancy
between what Americans and Europeans find acceptable.
   ``We sell 5{ million copies worldwide, and over in Europe without
controversy. In fact,'' she added, ``we're considered kind of tame
over there.''

<HEAD>After Revelations, Investigations, PTL Founder Bakker Goes On Trial</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After two years of revelations _ and a
last-minute prosecution surprise _ PTL founder Jim Bakker faces
trial on charges of using TV, telephones and the mail to defraud
supporters out of millions of dollars.
   Jury selection in his fraud and conspiracy trial is set for
Monday. Opening arguments are to begin one week later and the trial
is expected to last at least six weeks, with dozens of witnesses and
thousands of documents.
   Bakker, whose multimillion-dollar evangelical empire crumbled
after word leaked about his sexual tryst with a church secretary, is
charged in a 24-count indictment with diverting millions in PTL
money to support a lavish lifestyle.
   If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years in
prison and ordered to pay more than $5 million in fines.
   The case against Bakker resulted from a 16-month federal grand
jury investigation into PTL, which once boasted $129 million in
revenue under his leadership.
   Richard Dortch, Bakker's former top aide at the now-bankrupt
television ministry and former co-defendant, agreed on Aug. 8 to
plead guilty to four counts and to testify against Bakker.
   Dortch pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud, one count of
wire fraud by telephone, one count of wire fraud by television and
one count of conspiracy.
   ``It's got to have some effect (on the approach taken at
trial),'' one of Bakker's attorneys, George T. Davis, said of
Dortch's testimony. ``But these kind of people who make these kinds
of pleas are not always considered as credible as they might be.''
   The Bakker trial follows the tax evasion convictions of two
former PTL aides, brothers David and James Taggart, in the same
federal courtroom.
   The Taggarts' attorney, Ben Cotten, said his clients would
consider testifying against Bakker.
   David Taggart, who was Bakker's personal aide, and James Taggart,
his former interior designer, are scheduled to be sentenced on Aug.
25 _ three days opening arguments in Bakker's trial.
   The Taggarts each face 25 years in prison and more than $1
million in fines when they are sentenced by U.S. District Judge
Robert Potter, who also will preside over the upcoming Bakker trial.
They were convicted July 25.
   It's been more than two years since Bakker stepped down as
chairman of PTL, following revelations about his sexual encounter
with secretary Jessica Hahn and hush money paid to her by PTL.
   The story broke in March 1987. Disclosures about Jim and Tammy
Bakker's extravagant spending habits on homes, cards and jewelry,
PTL's bankruptcy proceedings, and charges of homosexuality by former
Bakker associates touched off an unprecedented ``holy war'' among
some of America's most prominent televangelists, including Jerry
Falwell and Jimmy Swaggart.
   The federal grand jury heard testimony from more than 100
witnesses, reviewed thousands of documents and watched tapes of old
``PTL Club'' shows.
   Its Dec. 5 indictment came almost eight years to the day after
Bakker and Ms. Hahn had sex in a Clearwater Beach, Fla., hotel room
_ Dec. 6, 1980. Dortch was accused of giving her $265,000 in PTL
money in exchange for her silence.
   Bakker is charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of
wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.
   Specifically, he is accused of pocketing some of the $158 million
that poured into PTL from 1984 to 1987 under various ``lifetime
partnership'' programs.
   In eight of the 11 programs, contributors were promised free
lodging at the ministry's Heritage USA Christian retreat near
Charlotte in exchange for a one-time donation of $1,000 or more.
   Instead of using all of the money to build hotels and other
facilities at Heritage USA, the indictment said, PTL executives
spent more than $4 million on themselves and used some of it for
operating expenses.
   All the while, PTL was suffering from severe cash-flow problems
as Jim and Tammy Bakker received nearly $3.5 million in bonuses from
1984 through 1987 and Dortch got $550,000 in bonuses. At the same
time, they withheld informaton about PTL's worsening financial
problems from its board of directors, the indictment charged.
   Tammy Bakker was not charged.
   Prosecutors Deborah Smith, who works in the fraud section of the
U.S. Department of Justice, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller
have declined to discuss details of the upcoming trial.
   Bakker and his defense attorneys also are mum, saying they
believe it will be impossible to get a fair trial in Charlotte
because of extensive pretrial publicity, particularly in The
Charlotte Observer.
   The newspaper won a Pulitizer Prize last year for its
investigative stories about PTL under Bakker's leadership. He
resigned when the Observer's editors told him they were prepared to
go to print with a story spelling out the details of the
sex-and-money scandal.
   Defense attorneys failed in their attempts to move the trial out
of Charlotte.
   Davis, Bakker's lawyer, said the judge has said he believes it's
possible to select a fair jury. ``And if that's true, I can't think
of anything we're more anxious to do than to go to trial,'' he said.

<HEAD>Quebec Separatist Issue Back in Canadian Politics</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public opinion poll has thrust the issue of
Quebec independence back into the Canadian political arena, although
Quebeckers rejected separatism in a referendum nearly a decade ago.
   The Gallup poll indicated that 28 percent of Canadians believe
French-speaking Quebec should become an independent country.
According to Gallup, it was the strongest support for separatism
nationally since the company's pollsters first asked the question
more than 20 years ago.
   Perhaps the most startling finding of the poll of 1,034 Canadians
was that 27 percent of English-speaking Canadians and 36 percent of
French-speaking Canadians favored Quebec's becoming a separate
nation.
   There long has been resentment in parts of English-speaking
Canada, especially in the West, of what is perceived as favoritism
or special treatment for Quebec. But the percentage of those who
would just as soon see it separate from Canada had not been
perceived to be as high as the poll indicated.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a native of Quebec, brushed the
poll findings aside.
   ``The heartbeat of the nation is strong, it's vigorous and it's
resolved to even greater unity,'' he said.
   ``It's kind of silly to ask Canadians whether they want to divide
their country or to strip their country. The answer, when you strip
away the varnish, is absolutely `no.'''
   Mulroney conceded that some linguistic tensions exist in Canada
but said that always has been the case.
   Indeed, a focus in the Canadian news media on the national unity
issue may be as much a result of a languid summer without much else
attracting attention as to any concrete developments in Quebec.
   Premier Robert Bourassa of Quebec, who opposes separatism,
appears virtually certain to win the election expected in early
fall, possibly with an even greater margin of victory for his
provincial Liberal Party than in 1985 when it won 99 of 122 seats in
the Quebec legislature.
   The Parti Quebecois, which found success with its separatist
message in the 1970s, has fallen on hard times, and the economic
prosperity that has lasted in Quebec along with most of Canada for
seven years makes this an unlikely time for a comeback.
   Quebec, Canada's largest and second most populous province with
6.5 million people, is 81 percent French-speaking.
   No one is predicting a new surge of the separatist movement. The
poll results were a reminder of how intractable the French-English
issues are in Canada and the difficulties of running a country in
which nine provinces are majority English-speaking and one
French-speaking.
   Among those expessing unease, however, was John Turner, the
retiring leader of the naional Liberal Party, which sits in
opposition to Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives.
   ``I have, during the course of the last six or nine months,
experienced and felt a deterioration in the mood of the country,''
Turner said. ``I believe all those who share with me the view of a
tolerant, bilingual federation working in equilibrium should be
concerned.''
   Quebec barely surfaced as an issue in the national election this
past November when the big issue was the free trade agreement with
the United States.
   Mulroney's victory allowed the pact to take effect as scheduled
Jan. 1, and Quebec was a center of support for the agreement and its
native son. Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives do not run in
Quebec's provincial elections.
   But the Quebec government's refusal last winter to remove its
restrictions on bilingual signs despite a Supreme Court of Canada
decision touched off resentment among the province's English
minority and in English-speaking provinces.
   French is required throughout Quebec as the only language on most
outdoor signs.
   There also has been growing realization that the Meech Lake
Accord, a constitutional agreement recognizing Quebec as a
``distinct society,'' may not make its deadline on June 23 for
ratification by all 10 provinces.
   The Atlantic coast province of New Brunswick and Manitoba in the
West have yet to ratify the agreement, and threats have been made to
reconsider ratification elsewhere before the deadline.
   The Meech Lake Accord developed because Quebec had refused to
join the nine other provinces in signing the national constitution
at the outset of the decade. The constitution still applies to
Quebec even without its signature, but the impasse makes it more
difficult for changes to be made on such national issues as native
rights and the way the Senate operates.
   Quebec voters rejected sovereignty in a 1980 referendum after a
dizzying decade in which power shifted from the English minority to
the French majority.
   The Parti Quebecois governed the province from 1976 to 1985 but
lost its spirit after 60 percent of Quebec's voters in the 1980
referendum rejected separation.

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Once-bustling Beirut, emptied of most of its
population, is now filled with despair. Those who remain can do
little but wait for the end. Here is a report on how they survive
under a constant rain of shells.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After five months of day and night
shelling by Christian and Syrian forces, Beirut has been abandoned
by 90 percent of its people. It is a living hell for those who still
huddle in its ruins.
   ``We're living like rats underground, hiding in fear in shelters
for endless days and nights,'' lamented Salwa Ashkar, a 22-year-old
Maronite Catholic woman who runs a beauty parlor in Christian east
Beirut. ``We can't take much more.''
   Across the capital's dividing Green Line, a moonscape of
devastated apartment blocks infested by snipers, life is as
desperate for the Moslems as well as the Christians.
   ``We're going down the drain,'' said Mahmoud Shami, an
engineering graduate from the American University of Beirut who has
no job and no future.
   ``I'm trying to get out. Anywhere. I'll go to any country that
will give me a visa,'' said Shami, 24.
   Hospitals are running out of medicine. There's no electricity or
water. The presidential palace atop a hill overlooking Beirut in the
Christian suburb of Baabda, like most buildings, has been blasted
into rubble.
   Packs of stray dogs, their ribs poking through their sides,
scavenge through the piles of fly-infested garbage in the streets.
   Rats, some as big as cats, scamper through the stinking mounds
that lie feastering in the summer heat on nearly every alley corner.
   Beneath the rubble-strewn streets, where power cables cut by
shrapnel dangle from splintered wooden poles, the estimated 150,000
Beirutis who cling to what is left of their lives cower for days on
end in underground bunkers or basement parking lots from the
bombardment.
   Apartment building tenants crowd ground-floor entrances to cook
whatever they have on makeshift stoves. Housewives hand out the
meager fare. The men venture out when they can to forage wood or
anything that will burn.
   There is nothing but despair. After 14 years of civil war, an
Israeli invasion and murderous street battles between rival
militias, surviving one day to the next is all Beirutis can expect.
   The capital's radio stations cut into programs to report which
areas are being hit _ in between commercial breaks with bouncy
jingles advertising scotch or hairsprays that seem grotesquely out
of place.
   The police, who long ago lost all hope of maintaining law and
order in a country that seemed bent on self-destruction, chronicle
Lebanon's daily disasters with painstaking dedication.
   They estimate that more than 1.3 million of the 1.5 million
people who lived in Beirut before the latest spasm of fighting
between the Christians and the Syrians broke out March 8 have fled
the city.
   Every day in Moslem west Beirut, when the shelling eases, people
emerge from the bunkers, load up cars and pickups with whatever they
can carry, and head south.
   Some find shelter with relatives. But tens of thousands have to
camp out along the coastal highway as they did when they fled the
Israeli siege of Beirut in 1982.
   They sleep in their cars or under plastic sheets.
   For miles along the highway, these refugees in their own land
squat beside the road, listening to the rumble of shellfire to the
north ripping their city apart.
   In east Beirut, the Christians are not so lucky. Their
310-square-mile enclave, shrunken after years of defeats in the
civil war, is ringed to the north, south and east by the Syrians and
their allies.
   The only way out is by sea, past a Syrian blockade on ships bound
for Cyprus. Not everyone makes it.
   A Christian couple lost their two daughters a few nights ago when
Syrian shellfire hit the speedboat ferrying them to a
Norwegian-owned hydrofoil, the Santa Maria, that sneaks in at night.
   The parents were separated when they were pulled from the
Mediterranean by the Santa Maria's crew. Both thought the other had
the children.
   It wasn't until they reached the Cypriot port of Larnaca hours
later that they bumped into each other and learned their children
had been killed.
   Many Christians had fled to the comparative safety of ski resorts
of Faraya, Harajel and Ashkout in the pine-studded central
mountains. But it it expensive: A two-room apartment rents for about
$1,800 a month.
   Some Beirutis have stuck it out. Some have nowhere to go. Some
have no money to get out. Some have just given up and wait for the
end.
   Gaby, the Armenian who has had a barber shop in the basement of
the Commodore Hotel for 15 years, is still there. He used to have
hundreds of customers a month, sipping scotch as he clipped their
hair. Now he's lucky if he gets a dozen.
   His best customers in the ruined hotel, once headquarters for the
foreign press, are the 30 Syrian soldiers billeted there. If he's
lucky, they sometimes leave a tip.
   ``Mostly they don't bother paying,'' he said. ``What can I do?
There's nowhere for me to go anymore.''
   The Christians, paralyzed by a fuel shortage because of the
blockade, line up at gas stations. Gas canisters for cooking cost
about $21. In more peaceful times they cost $1.
   In the Moslem sector, fuel is more plentiful, although still
scarce. Oil and gas are brought in from Syria, but even that's
becoming risky because the Christians are shelling the mountain
roads used by Syrian convoys.
   Beirut's cafes and restaurants, once the haunt of high-rolling
Arab sheiks and their bejeweled women, are closed: no customers, no
power, no water.
   A few bistros open briefly during lulls along rubble-strewn Hamra
Street, the main commercial thoroughfare that once bustled with
life. But few risk sitting down for a coffee when a shell could blow
them away at any minute.
   Along west Beirut's corniche, the Syrians have set up artillery
guns that shell the Christian side across the bay. They have become
a favorite target for Christian gunners, which makes for dangerous
living in the apartment blocks lining the corniche.
   Government offices, banks, businesses are closed. What was left
of the government system after years of fighting has ceased to
function.
   No one is being paid. Schools have been closed for months.
Parents teach children at home, often in the shelters during
shelling.
   Central Bank Governor Edmond Naim lives in the building's
underground bunker and refuses to answer the telephone _ even when
it is functioning _ because the bank isn't operating.
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun huddles in his bunker two
floors below the presidential palace, which has been demolished by
Syrian shellfire.
   Simon Khoury, Aoun's spokesman, said the two-story, 35-room
complex has been hit by 10 240mm mortar rounds, designed to knock
out army bunkers, and scores of 180mm shells.
   ``They try every day to blow us away, but we're still here,'' he
said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a rundown of the main military forces and militia
factions involved in Lebanon's civil war:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AMAL _ Arabic for Hope, is the mainstream Shiite Moslem faction
that controls most of southern Lebanon. It was founded in 1974 as a
social movement seeking better living standards for the
million-strong Shiites, Lebanon's largest single faction. Its leader
is French-educated lawyer Nabih Berri. Although a close ally of
Syria, Amal's 6,500 fighters have stayed out of the latest
confrontation between Syrian forces and Lebanese army christian
units.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PROGRESSIVE SOCIALIST PARTY _ The militia force of the Druse,
an offshoot of Islam based in the Chouf mountains east and southeast
of Beirut. The party is led by Walid Jumblatt who is from the
largest clan among the 200,000-strong Druse community. The
Progressive Socialists have about 100 Soviet-made tanks and 4,000
hardcore fighters but can field up to 12,000. The party has been
fighting alongside the Syrians.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HEZBOLLAH _ The Party of God is Amal's main Shiite rival and
seeks an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Lebanon. It controls
Beirut's southern slums. The Iranian-backed party, formed in 1982,
has some 3,500 fighters. Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella
group for extremist Shiite factions holding most of the 16 foreign
hostages in Lebanon. It has declared support for the Syrian units in
Lebanon but has not joined the battle.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE MOURABITOUN _ The main militia force of the Sunni Moslems
before it was smashed by Amal, aided by the Progressive Socialists,
in April 1985. It has gone underground since then, leaving the
Sunnis without any significant militia force.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LEBANESE ARMY _ It has been fractured along sectarian lines.
The mainly Christian units, with an estimated 20,000 men, are led by
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite Catholic. His three
combat brigades are U.S. trained and equipped with U.S.-built tanks
and artillery. They are the main force defending the Christian areas
around Beirut.
   The Moslem military forces, with an estimated 22,000 soldiers,
are commanded by Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib. These brigades, made up of
Druse, Shiite and Sunni troops, have stayed out of the latest
fighting.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LEBANESE FORCES _ Led by former medical student Samir Geagea,
it is the Christians' main militia. The right-wing force has some
6,000 fighters and thousands more reservists. The force has
pro-Israeli leanings and is well armed with tanks and artillery. In
the past year it has received an estimated 120 tanks plus armored
personnel carriers and 155mm artillery from Iraq, Syria's main Arab
foe. The Lebanese Forces are Aoun's only backers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION _ Comprised of about 5,000
guerrillas and thousands of reservists based in camps in southern
Lebanon. PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's loyalists, who make up the
bulk of the force, have stayed out of the current fighting but
pro-Syrian dissidents have joined forces with Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party. They include some 1,000 fighters from the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, headed by
former Syrian army Capt. Ahmed Jibril, and Col. Saeed Mousa's
Fatah-Uprising.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SYRIAN TROOPS _ They first entered Lebanon in 1976 as part of an
Arab League peacekeeping force. The non-Syrian units soon pulled
out. The Syrians initially sought to curb Moslem factions, but wound
up fighting the Christians in later years. The Syrians, with more
than two divisions _ about 40,000 troops with hundreds of tanks and
heavy artillery _ in Lebanon, control about 70 percent of Lebanese
territory. They are blocking all land exits from the 310-square-mile
Christian heartland.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE SOUTH LEBANON ARMY _ Supported by Israel, the army is mainly
Christian and holds a salient around the mountain town of Marjayoun
in south Lebanon. Its estimated 2,500 fighters also patrol Israel's
self-declared ``security zone,'' an occupied border strip running
from the Mediterranean to Mount Hermon. The army often engages
Moslem and leftist militia groups in clashes in south Lebanon but
has no force close to the battle lines in and around Beirut.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ISRAEL _ It maintains about 1,000 troops, with armor and
artillery, in the buffer zone carved out when the Israelis withdrew
the bulk of their army from Lebanon in 1985, three years after it
invaded that country.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IRAN _ It has some 2,000 men from the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon.
They moved in to fight the invading Israelis in 1982. They have not
been involved in the latest fighting, although Iran has declared
support for Syria.

   Montana's first female Supreme Court justice
was named to the bench just this week, no matter what the National
Women's Political Caucus directory says.
   The organization listed Chief Justice Jean Turnage as one of the
women holding top elective offices around the country, in its
National Directory of Women Elected Officials.
   Trouble is, Turnage is a man. His first name, French for John,
has been Anglicized.
   Turnage said his name hasn't caused him problems in recent years,
but he recalled receiving written invitations to join sororities
when he was in college.
   ``I once knew a guy named Pearl, but I never knew a boy called
Sue,'' he joked Monday.
   The women's caucus will be able to cite one female justice on the
state's Supreme Court in its next directory, though. Gov. Stan
Stephens on Monday appointed Diane Barz, a state district judge in
Billings, to fill a vacancy on the bench.

   Hundreds of Elvis Presley faithful walked
with candles up a winding quarter-mile driveway to his former
mansion Tuesday night to pass the singer's grave and mark the 12th
anniversary of his death.
   The crowd walked single file and carried candles lit from an
eternal flame at the mansion, called Graceland. Many left single
roses at Presley's graveside beside the swimming pool. The rock 'n'
roll pioneer died Aug. 16, 1977.
   ``He just had everything,'' said Laurie Cousins, who waited on a
sidewalk for 13 hours to be first in line for the procession. ``He
had looks. He had charisma. He had everything.''
   The candlelight vigil, expected to draw more than 4,000
participants through the night, is the largest single event of a
nine-day lineup of concerts, memorials, trivia contests, film
festivals and souvenir fairs that make up Elvis International
Tribute Week.
   The 7-year-old Tribute Week is organized and promoted by managers
of Presley's former residence, Graceland, which draws 650,000
visitors a year, including some 40,000 over the anniversary
celebration, said Jack Soden, executive director of the Graceland
division of Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc.
   The vigil was begun 11 years ago by the Elvis Country Fan Club,
one of more than 250 Presley fan clubs around the world.
   Georgann Reynolds of Austin, Texas, president of the Elvis
Country club, said her group has more than 1,200 members worldwide,
many of whom are too young to have been Presley fans when he was
alive. She said she expects the annual graveside vigils to continue
for years to come.
   ``One reason for a fan club is to pass the torch, to keep the
candle burning,'' she said.
   Ms. Cousins, 38, of Winnipeg, Canada, said her daylong wait to be
first in line was worth it. It was the third year in a row that she
and her friend-in-Elvis Sheryl Fordin, 38, of New York, have been at
the front of the procession.
   Graceland and its 36,000-square-foot souvenir shopping center
take in about $12 million a year. The complex is run for the
financial benefit of Presley's only child, Lisa Marie.
   Tickets to tour the house, two of Presley's former airplanes and
a museum of his cars and motorcycles cost $15.95 each for adults and
$10.25 for children. A tour of the house alone is $7.50.
   Presley bought the three-story, white-columned residence in 1957
when his rock 'n' roll career began to blossom, and he called
Memphis home for most of his professional life. Presley died at age
42 of heart disease.

<HEAD>Marathon Trial Is `Cottage Industry Event' in Bloated Justice System</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense attorney sees the McMartin preschool
molestation trial as ``a cottage industry event'' and legal experts
say its protracted length is symptomatic of a bloated, unworkable
justice system.
   With the trial in its third year and the charges against Raymond
Buckey and his mother 6 years old, the McMartin case has set records
in criminal law. And it's not over yet.
   In April, the trial became the longest in U.S. history,
surpassing the two-year record of the Hillside Strangler case. Its
cost was estimated recently at $15 million and climbing.
   ``This trial has become a cottage industry event,'' said Buckey's
attorney Danny Davis. ``It made experts out of people who testified.
It became an annuity for attorneys. It has regularly been a ratings
focus for television. ... Lots of carpet baggers glom on and make
hay.''
   The chief prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, says
that although McMartin is the longest trial it's not that unusual.
   ``I would say that in many respects the McMartin case is like
other cases that take much too long to go through the system and
come to a conclusion,'' she said.
   Ms. Rubin blames the defense for the trial's length, citing
interminable cross-examinations. She says 80 percent of the 14
months she spent presenting her case was taken up by defense
inquiries.
   The defense blames the prosecution.
   ``McMartin is a case that may have been doomed to excesses,''
Davis says. ``It started in excess. Its core defect was numbers _
numbers of counts, numbers of defendants, numbers of children.
Whatever you think of guilt or innocence, there was no necessity to
bring such a large case.''
   It began with Buckey's arrest in 1983 and escalated to include
six other teachers at the prestigious McMartin Pre-school in the
seaside community of Manhattan Beach. Prosecutors alleged that
Buckey, his mother, sister, grandmother and three other women
teachers had molested hundreds of tots at the school over five years.
   But after an 18-month preliminary hearing, District Attorney Ira
Reiner dropped charges against five of the defendants, saying there
was insufficient evidence to prosecute them.
   Buckey, now 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, were
left to face trial on 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of
conspiracy involving alleged molestation of 11 children.
   Since the trial began in April 1987, the jury of 12 with a backup
panel of six alternates has been dwindling due to illness and
employment problems. With only one alternate left, Superior Court
Judge William Pounders worries that the case will be aborted if more
jurors are lost. A jury of 12 is required to decide a criminal case.
   ``It is a probability this case will end in a mistrial,''
Pounders said recently, vowing to do everything he can to avert
that. He has limited defense witnesses and lengthened the trial day
to six hours. Attorneys hope to submit the case to jurors this year.
   ``The system can't survive too many more McMartins because it's
so long and expensive,'' says Peter Aranella, professor of criminal
law at the University of California at Los Angeles.
   Aranella suggests that the time and money consumed by such a case
reduces the chance for other defendants to receive trials.
   In order to work, he said, the system must rely on plea
bargaining to dispose of 80 percent to 90 percent of criminal
prosecutions.
   ``The adversarial trial system is too time consuming, cumbersome
and expensive to provide to every criminal defendant,'' he said.
``That's a fact of life that every actor in the criminal justice
system understands.''
   ``The irony,'' Aranella says, ``is that as long as the system can
rely on plea bargaining to settle the majority of criminal
prosecutions, we can go on for a long time with these occasional
show trials.''
   The national trend is toward longer and longer trials, says
Albert Alschuler, professor of law at the University of Chicago who
calls the length of the McMartin case ``incomprehensible.''
   ``American trials are just ridiculously too long with the result
that we don't give them to everyone,'' he said. `` We pressure
almost all defendants into plea bargains.''
   Alschuler, citing legal history, says trials have been growing in
length for the last century.
   ``I think it was the late 18th century when the first criminal
trial lasted longer than a day,'' he said. ``... It's been a gradual
process of increasing trial complexity.''
   Ms. Rubin thinks that McMartin will lead to reforms with
legislators moving to limit the length of jury selection and
preliminary hearings. But Alschuler sees little chance for reform.
   ``This is a great system for lawyers, and lawyers control the
criminal justice system,'' Alschuler said. ``It's not a great system
for defendants and taxpayers. But, by God, it's a great system for
lawyers.''

<HEAD>Disputes Over Auschwitz, Covenant Hurt Jewish-Catholic Relations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relations between Roman Catholics and Jews have
suffered new setbacks that threaten long-term efforts aimed at
mending centuries of mistrust and misunderstanding.
   Officials on both sides are appealing for moderation to deal with
the disputes involving a Roman Catholic convent at Auschwitz and
Pope John Paul II's recent remarks about God's covenant with the
Jews, in which he said history showed Israel had not always been
faithful to God's law.
   While expressing anger and disappointment, Jewish leaders in
Europe and the United States said relations with the church have
improved substantially since the 1962-65 Second Vatican Council, and
they want to continue the interfaith dialogue.
   ``Our relations have to overcome 2,000 years of
misunderstanding,'' said Rabbi Leon Klenicki, director of interfaith
affairs of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in New York
and the group's liaison representative to the Vatican. ``You can't
do it in 20 years. What is crucial is to continue the dialogue and
the relationship.''
   It has been a bumpy relationship during the 10{-year papacy of
John Paul.
   Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, former chairman of the International
Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations, said relations
have gone ``two steps forward, one step backward.''
   The steps forward included John Paul's visit to Rome's main
synagogue in 1986, the first recorded visit by a pope to a Jewish
shrine, and his talks with a delegation of American Jews in 1987.
   A step backward was the pope's meeting at the Vatican in 1982
with PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Then came the pope's audience in 1987
with Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, accused of complicity in Nazi
war crimes.
   The Holocaust has been a particular source of friction.
   Jews and others have questioned whether Pope Pius XII did enough
during World War II to stop Hitler's campaign to exterminate the
Jews. John Paul was criticized for not mentioning Jewish victims
during his 1988 visit to the Mauthausen concentration camp in
Austria, although a few weeks later he spoke of the ``particular
measure of extermination'' suffered by Jews.
   In a 1987 papal letter released in the United States, John Paul
said Christians ``approach with fearsome respect the terrifying
experience of the extermination ... suffered by the Jews'' during
the war.
   Still, some Jewish groups say the pope has not gone far enough
and that he treats the Holocaust as not exclusively a Jewish tragedy.
   Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and author,
recently accused John Paul of trying to ``de-Judaize'' the Holocaust
by ignoring Jewish suffering in speeches and comments about that era.
   The Holocaust is at the root of the latest dispute, which
involves a Carmelite convent at Oswiecim, Poland, a few feet from
the fence surrounding the Auschwitz concentration camp.
   Jewish groups say the convent and its Christian symbols, such as
a 23-foot cross, offend the memory of the 2.5 million Jews who died
there.
   Under an accord signed by Catholic and Jewish leaders in 1987,
the nuns were supposed to have moved by Feb. 22 to a prayer center
to be built several thousand yards away.
   The deadline passed, and the center has yet to be built. Jewish
groups accused the Polish church of reneging.
   ``What was supposed to be and should have been a discreet and
loving gesture of conciliation and reconciliation, because of delays
has become a stumbling block on the path of Jewish-Catholic
relations,'' said Tullia Zevi, president of the Union of Italian
Jewish Communities and a signatory to the 1987 accord.
   After a series of demonstrations at the convent by American
Jewish activists, Cardinal Franciszek Macharski announced Aug. 10 he
was suspending the agreement to move the nuns. He blamed Western
Jewish groups for launching ``a violent campaign of accusations and
slanders'' and creating an ``atmosphere of aggressive demands.''
   Many Jews want the pope to intervene.
   The pope himself sparked a controversy with his remarks during
two recent general audiences about God's covenant with Moses on
Mount Sinai.
   On Aug. 2, the pope said God selected Jews as the chosen people
``on condition that they remained faithful to his law.''
   ``But the history of the Old Testament shows many instances of
Israel's infidelity to God,'' he said. ``Hence God sent the Prophets
as his messengers to call the people to conversion, to warn them of
their hardness of heart and to foretell a new covenant still to
come.''
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith protested, expressing
``profound concern'' at the comments and said it hoped the ``clock
of Catholic-Jewish relations has not been tragically set back.''
   The group said the pope's remarks suggested the new covenant with
Christianity had replaced and superseded the alliance with Jews, who
believe that God's covenant with them is everlasting.
   Jewish leaders said the pope's remarks contradicted the Second
Vatican Council's 1965 document Nostra Aetate (In Our Times), which
officially rescinded the accusation that the Jews killed Christ.
That document is considered a turning point in Catholic-Jewish
relations.
   The Rev. Pier Francesco Fumagalli, an official of the Vatican's
office for relations with Jews, confirmed he received the
Anti-Defamation League's letter of protest and said it would be
studied. Otherwise, the Vatican has not commented publicly on the
issue.

Rubble</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Investigators uncovered a fourth body Tuesday
from the rubble at a charred rooming house, the site of a fatal fire
officials believe was triggered by an arsonist.
   Stephen F. O'Connell, a spokesman for Essex County District
Attorney Kevin Burke, said authorities located the body on the Ben
Crest Plaza's top floor about 3:30 p.m.
   ``What happened is in the course of re-interviewing witnesses the
detectives determined they should go back to the building and search
a particular area. On doing so, the body was found,'' O'Connell said.
   The victim was not immediately identified, but forensics experts
were were being consulted, O'Connell said.
   He said so far no suspects had been linked with the fire, which
burned out of control for three hours a week ago and killed at least
three other people. Authorities said the building had several safety
violations.
   Investigators were still tracking down leads in the case,
O'Connell said.

<HEAD>Former Exec Files $80 Million Libel Suit Against Business Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chief executive for Allegheny
International Inc. has filed an $80 million libel suit against
Business Week magazine, claiming a defamatory cover story cost him
his job and reputation.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court said false statements
about Robert J. Buckley's business dealings and professional
competency were made in the Aug. 11, 1986, issue of the magazine
published by McGraw-Hill Inc.
   ``He was the featured cover article in a national publication, he
was held up to ridicule and scorn, he was accused falsely of ruining
the company and he lost his position at the company as a direct
result of this and follow-up articles,'' Buckley's lawyer, Dort S.
Bigg of Manchester, said Tuesday.
   The suit also cites a July 3, 1989, article that mentions Buckley
in another cover story on corporate directors under the heading
``Horror Stories.''
   Buckley was fired as Allegheny's chief executive officer shortly
after the 1986 article hit the newsstands and the Pittsburgh-based
appliance manufacturer later went bankrupt. Buckley has been
unemployed since then, Bigg said.
   ``He has found it virtually impossible to pursue the type of
business dealings it was his experience and his pleasure to
pursue,'' Bigg said. ``He has been seriously damaged economically
and in the national and world business community.''
   Buckley's son, Christopher Buckley, currently has a lawsuit
pending against the publishing house in federal court in Pittsburgh,
claiming he was defamed in the 1986 story.
   Robert Buckley initially filed his libel suit in a Pennsylvania
court in 1986, but dropped it after McGraw-Hill moved the state
court action to federal court, McGraw Hill attorney Ken Vittor said.
   ``We feel it has no merit. We stand by our story,'' said Betsy
Russo, director of public affairs for McGraw-Hill. ``The story was
exhaustively researched and we intend to vigorously defend it.''
   Robert Buckley filed his suit in New Hampshire on July 28, only
days before the state's three-year statute of limitations ran out,
Bigg said.

   Gen. Colin L. Powell said goodbye to Atlanta's
business and government leaders at a reception commemorating his
short stint as commander-in-chief for Forces Command at Fort
McPherson.
   Powell, who was nominated last week to serve as chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he enjoyed his four-month stint at the
Atlanta post.
   ``I leave here loaded with Southern hospitality,'' he said
Tuesday.
   Delta Air Lines Chairman Ron Allen, chairman of the Atlanta
Chamber of Commerce, presented a picture of the symbol of Atlanta,
Phoenix Rising, inscribed to Powell, ``who was in our midst the
shortest time of any Forscom Commander but will leave the longest
shadow.''
   Mayor Andrew Young praised Powell for his work as former
President Reagan's national security adviser, saying he was ``the
last person the president talked to before he made a decision and he
made some very good decisions on your watch.''
   ``We really hate to see you go,'' Young said, ``but we couldn't
find anybody better to entrust our military to.''

   Former ``Charlie's Angels'' TV star Kate
Jackson underwent cancer surgery in which doctors removed a
malignant part of her breast, a spokeswoman said.
   Miss Jackson, 40, was resting comfortably at an undisclosed Los
Angeles-area hospital and ``her prognosis is excellent,'' publicist
Lisa Kasteler said Tuesday.
   Surgeons performed a modified mastectomy and reconstructive
plastic surgery, Kasteler said.
   ``I'm making this disclosure public in order to help other women
facing this difficult situation, encourage early detection of breast
disease through mammography and to save inquiring minds 50 cents,''
Miss Jackson said in a statement.
   The actress, who starred in the movie ``Making Love'' and the
short-lived 1989 television series ``Baby Boom'' on NBC, will return
to work Sept. 6 in a still-untitled television movie for CBS, her
publicist said.

   John Candy loves his wisecracking roles in
comedy films, but he regards viewing his own movies as a horror.
   ``I don't watch my movies,'' the hefty actor said. ``I just get
too critical of myself.''
   Candy, who got his start in television with ``SCTV,'' said he
watches daily prints during shooting and often views rough-cut
versions. But he won't go further in fear of second-guessing his
performances and editing room decisions.
   ``You get frustrated thinking, `I would do this and I would do
that,''' he said. ``Instead of putting myself through that, I don't
even bother with it anymore.''
   Candy plays an irresponsible bachelor baby-sitting his brother's
children in ``Uncle Buck.'' The film, scheduled for release this
week, is his third collaboration with moviemaker John Hughes.

   Actress Jill Ireland, whose battle with cancer
was described in two best-selling books, is ``pretty much stable,
looking good and feeling good,'' her publicist said.
   ``The cancer has not recurred in her neck and shoulder,''
publicist Lori Jonas said Tuesday. ``She is undergoing chemotherapy
and still has the catheter in her chest. But she is doing very
well.''
   The English-born actress, wife of movie star Charles Bronson,
first underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous right breast and
eight lymph nodes under her arm in 1984. She wrote about the ordeal
in ``Life Wish.''
   In April 1988, Miss Ireland began feeling pain in her shoulder
and was diagnosed with cancer that had spread to her lungs, hip,
femur and thyroid.
   The 53-year-old actress underwent a drastic form of treatment in
Arlington, Texas, called hypothermia that involved injecting 9-inch
metal skewers into her shoulder and heating them to 160 degrees in
an attempt to burn the tumors.

   Kitty Kelley, the biographer whose unauthorized
life stories of Jackie Onassis and Frank Sinatra set their subjects
seething, is a target of a $50 million lawsuit from syndicated
gossip columnist Karen Feld.
   In the suit filed Tuesday in District of Columbia Superior Court,
Feld alleged that Kelley and Time Inc. photographer Stanley Tretick
tried to drive her out of business by threatening to file a lawsuit
of their own. The action allegedly resulted in Feld losing her
syndicated column at The Washington Times.
   In June, Feld wrote a column saying Kelley appeared at the
funeral of the daughter of former Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger
``disguised as one of the bereaved.'' The article speculated that
Kelley, who is writing a biography of Nancy Reagan, attended only to
get access to Reagan insiders.
   Kelley told Washingtonian Magazine she had been invited by the
Nofzigers, who confirmed the invitation, and threatened to sue Feld.
That suit was never filed.
   Feld's publicist, Samantha Dean of Samantha Dean &amp; Associates
Inc. in New York City, said Feld stands by her column. Kelley did
not return a telephone call seeking comment.

   The crowd was smaller, the musicians amateur
and Saabs replaced sandals as the favored form of transportation,
but hundreds of people donned tie-dyed shirts to conjure the spirit
of Woodstock anyway.
   Twenty years after Richie Havens opened the Woodstock festival
before 400,000 people, the late Max Yasgur's old farm filled with
revelers Tuesday to celebrate one of rock 'n' roll's most sacred
anniversaries.
   ``It was a deeply spiritual experience and certainly people would
want to come back,'' said comedian Wavy Gravy, the only one of
Woodstock's original performers.
   Gravy, wearing a beanie with a propeller and carrying a walking
stick topped with a pig's snout, waved to festival veterans before
being ushered into a forest of satellite dishes for one of dozens of
interviews.
   More free enterprise than free love was evident at the upstate
New York meadow as tourists could choose between T-shirts emblazoned
with ``I survived the Woodstock Reunion'' and ``Was I Late?''
   ``I really honor the people whose spread this is for allowing
this to take place,'' Gravy said. ``It's very folksy.''
   It wasn't without a price. A man who said he was a relative of
the field's new owners, Louis Nicky and June Gelish of New York
City, asked a $5 ``field restoration'' donation from each carload.
Police said the owners squabbled with merchants who tried to sell
their wares.
   True to the spirit of the original Woodstock, when fans swarmed
over fences to transform it into a free concert, some motorists just
waited until the landlord looked the other way and snuck their
vehicles onto the field.
   Police were on hand to make sure traffic kept moving. There were
no arrests, said Sgt. Charles Kulick of the Sullivan County
Sheriff's Department. He estimated the crowd at about 600, the
largest of a celebration that had been building for a week.
   The most tension came when television reporters, nervously
approaching 6 p.m. deadlines, competed for space near the
commemorative plaque that is the only permanent fixture on the
alfalfa field.
   ``I didn't really know what to expect,'' said Ralph Corwin, a
resident of upstate New York who said he attended the original show
and has returned every year since. ``I'm just thankful that they let
us go back. The numbers have fallen down but the spirit hasn't
died.''
   On the same corner where Jimi Hendrix, the Who, the Jefferson
Airplane and the Grateful Dead performed 20 years earlier, a
makeshift stage was built for stray amateur guitarists. One singer
replaced Country Joe McDonald's infamous ``Gimme an `F''' cheer with
the more modest L-O-V-E spellalong.

   An Indian reservation sounded like a good
home for a buffalo herd, but the Chippewa tribe wishes someone would
take them away.
   ``We don't want a herd of buffalo,'' said Fred ``Fritz'' Monette,
a Chippewa tribal councilman. ``Unfortunately, we got stuck with a
herd of buffalo, and we don't know what to do with them.''
   Feeding the herd is costing the tribe about $100 a week and will
become more expensive come winter, he said Monday.
   The National Park Service gave the herd to the Turtle Mountain
Indian Reservation under a program that distributes surplus animals
to reservations.
   The herd has grown from nine head in 1984 to 29.
   Louise Crosby claims the tribe is trying to cut expenses by
starving the buffalo. ``To see them starve like that is a horrible
thing,'' she said.
   Crosby, who ran a game farm before selling her animals to the
Minot Zoo, said she offered to buy the buffalo to show the tribe how
extreme she thinks the situation is. But she said she doesn't really
want them because she too is daunted by feed costs.
   Monette and Tribal Chairman Twila Martin-Kekahbah deny the
buffalo are starving.
   ``They cost some money to the tribe, which we really can't
afford,'' Martin-Kekahbah said. ``However, the buffalo are not
starving. Some believe the buffalo are better taken care of than the
membership.''
   Richard Peltier, caretaker for the buffalo, said the animals
usually are fed between 15 gallons to 30 gallons of ground barley a
day. The tribe also buys 80 to 90 bales of hay a year for the herd,
he said, and provides a barrel of canned food supplement and a salt
block. The herd also has a large spring-fed water hole, he said.
   ``I think they are fed better than a lot of places,'' Peltier
said.
   Complaints from people like Crosby may stem from a
misunderstanding about how buffalo should look, he said. ``A person
has to get pretty close to them to see what shape they are in,'' he
said.
   Monette said the tribe is asking for suggestions on how it might
reduce the herd to a manageable size, possibly by auctioning or
donating animals.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Considering Tax Benefits for Savers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, seeking ways to boost
the U.S. savings rate to cure a variety of economic ills, appears to
be inching closer to recommending increased tax incentives for
thrifty Americans.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills added her support to the
idea Tuesday, saying that expanding Individual Retirement Accounts
would make her job of reducing America's huge trade deficits easier.
   Millions of American savers could benefit through expanded IRAs,
which enjoyed great popularity earlier in the decade, but it could
cost the U.S. Treasury billions of dollars in lost tax revenue.
   Hills, in an interview with reporters, stressed that she was not
signaling an imminent administration announcement on IRAs. However,
other officials said a proposed increase in tax incentives for IRAs
is high on the list of options being studied by the administration.
   Americans' personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of
after-tax income _ fell to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and
increased only slightly to 4.2 percent last year.
   By contrast, Japan, the country with the world's largest trade
surplus, had a savings rate of 16.5 percent in 1987.
   Administration officials said they are planning a fall campaign,
to be led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, focusing on the
country's chronic low savings rate and proposing ways to correct the
problem.
   The huge cost of IRAs was one reason they were greatly scaled
back by the 1986 Tax Reform Act. As a result, the number of tax
returns claiming IRA deductions fell from 15.5 million in 1987 to
7.4 million last year.
   In endorsing increased tax incentives for IRAs, Hills said it
would ``highlight the great need for private savings to go up. It
sends up a flag saying, this is very important, not only to your
nation, but to your own future and to your children.''
   A key reason advanced for America's high trade deficits is the
fact that Americans consume more than the country can produce
domestically. Economists argue that if Americans can be persuaded to
cut back consumption and save more, it would limit the need for
foreign goods.
   A higher savings rate would expand the pool of available funds in
this country and lower the cost of borrowing by U.S. businesses,
making them more competitive internationally.
   The Bush administration is negotiating with Japan on U.S. demands
for the Japanese to lower trade barriers erected against foreign
goods.
   Hills said cutting the federal budget deficit, which drains away
savings, and efforts to boost personal savings would counter
Japanese arguments that America is not doing enough at home to fix
its trading problems.
   In recent weeks, Budget Director Richard Darman and Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan have issued their own warnings about
the need to increase the U.S. savings rate.
   Darman attacked America's ``cultural now-now-ism,'' which he
defined as an unrestrained appetite for satisfying immediate wants
at the expense of long-term goals.
   Greenspan, testifying before Congress earlier in the month,
called raising the U.S. savings rate ``the crucial issue for the
long-term economic outlook of the country.''
   Hills is holding negotiations with Japan, Brazil and India in an
effort to get those nations to lower trade barriers cited by the
administration in May in a ``hit list'' of the most harmful
impediments to U.S. trade.
   The administration is holding separate talks with Japan on
so-called structural impediments that keep foreign companies from
doing business in Japan, such as the Japanese distribution system.
   However, she warned that despite the administration's best
efforts, the U.S. trade deficit is likely to widen ``a little'' in
the next 18 months because the dollar has increased in value, making
American goods less competitive on overseas markets.

<HEAD>Poland's Governmental Problems an `Internal Affair,' US Officials
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is engaging the Kremlin
in a mild war of words over attempts by Poland's Solidarity trade
union to form a non-communist government in that Soviet bloc country.
   ``Questions involving the government of Poland are properly an
internal affair,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Tuesday. He was using a diplomatic formula that recalled the flavor
but not the intensity of 1980-81, when Solidarity last challenged
the Polish Communist Party, leading to martial law.
   In Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda warned that
efforts by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to form a non-communist
government were ``against the principles of parliamentary
democracy'' and ``could lead to a prolonged political crisis.''
   ``The opposition has changed its strategy and has taken the
course of an immediate seizure of power,'' Pravda said. The
commentary noted that fixing the Polish economy required a coalition
of political forces, including the communists.
   The commentary contrasted with recent Soviet media reports on
Poland. Soviet television recently broadcast neutral coverage of
such Solidarity leaders as Walesa and Bronislaw Geremek, and
highlighted a visit last month by filmmaker Andrzej Wajda, a
Solidarity supporter and member of parliament who served as a judge
in the Moscow Film Festival.
   An independent Washington-based analyst, Janusz Bugajski, said
the Soviet commentary ``means that they are trying to send a message
to the government and to Solidarity that things have gone far
enough.''
   ``The Soviets have given the countries of Eastern Europe a free
hand over the past few years, but they may be reassessing that
policy,'' said Bugajski, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies and author of the book, ``Eastern European
Fault Lines.''
   Poland's communists, he said, ``would like to lure Solidarity
into a coalition'' to share blame for the deteriorating economy and
soaring prices, but do not want to surrender power, especially of
military and security forces.
   Solidarity leaders, on the other hand, are coming under pressure
from rank-and-file supporters to take advantage of elections this
year that shattered the communists' hold on parliament.
   But Solidarity is wary of sharing power with the communists and
taking the fall for continuing economic and political problems, said
Bugajski.
   Soviet leaders worry that Poland ultimately may leave the Warsaw
Pact defense alliance, but know that a 1981-style military crackdown
would jeopardize the efforts of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to improve relations with the West and reform the Soviet
system.
   In Warsaw, Walesa continued to jockey with communist authorities
over who should lead the government.
   Walesa said he was willing to serve as prime minister ``if
society wants it.'' And Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski called
for a joint meeting soon of the country's major political leaders to
find a ``rational solution'' for the deepening governmental crisis.
   In an interview with Warsaw radio Polish service, Walesa issued
an assurance clearly aimed at assuaging Kremlin fears, saying that
changes in the Polish government would ``not represent a threat to
the Warsaw Pact.''
   State Department spokesman Boucher declined to comment directly
on the Pravda article, but said U.S. officials ``note that Poland
faces a difficult period of transition from a state dominated by one
party to a more pluralistic and democratic system.''
   ``This process must be managed within Poland itself. The
formation of a new Polish government is an internal matter for the
Polish people to decide. We hope that a new government will be
formed as soon as possible,'' he said.
   Another State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, described the situation in Poland as ``very delicate,''
but said that the Soviet warning was not viewed with great alarm in
Washington.
   ``It was not even as strong as a shot across the bow,'' said the
source.
   A third government source, also speaking on condition that he not
be further identified, said U.S. officials did not think it likely
that Gorbachev would choose or be forced by conservatives in his
country to order a crackdown in Poland in the near future.

<HEAD>Americans Get Rare Chance to See Total Lunar Eclipse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The moon plunges into the Earth's shadow
tonight, creating the first total lunar eclipse visible in North
America since 1982, and thousands of telescopes are awaiting a
celestial show of light and color.
   The eclipse will start at 8:23 p.m. EDT when the Earth's shadow
appears to take its first nip from the full moon, and will end about
5{ hours later.
   The last full lunar eclipse visible over North America was in
December 1982, and the next one will not occur until December 1992.
   If the skies are clear, East Coast residents will get the best
view. The moon will be overhead with twilight ending just as the
eclipse begins.
   In time zones farther west, the eclipse will start before sunset
and moonrise, cheating some Americans out of seeing the full lunar
show. None of the eclipse will be visible in Alaska.
   Moonrise in Chicago, for example, will be at 7:43 p.m. CDT, half
an hour after the eclipse has started.
   Even more of the eclipse will take place below the horizon from
the perspective of Los Angeles.
   ``The moon will not become visible until sometime after 8:30 p.m.
PDT,'' according to a statement by the Griffith Observatory in Los
Angeles, and will be in eclipse as it rises.
   ``This a rare event,'' said an observatory official. ``The last
time the moon rose while totally eclipsed as seen from Los Angeles
was on Feb. 5, 1841, and it will not rise while totally eclipsed
again as seen from Los Angeles until June 25, 2029.''
   Free telescopes have been set up at the Griffith Observatory for
public viewing of the event.
   In Fort Worth, Texas, several local astronomical societies are
staging an eclipse-watching party with free use of telescopes. The
first glimpse the Texans will get of the moon will be about 7:55
p.m. CDT when it already is eclipsing.
   ``Moon Watch II,'' a free outdoor celebration of the eclipse and
the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11's lunar landing, will be held in
New York City's Central Park. A small rocket will be launched to
open the event, followed by lectures on the eclipse and live
entertainment featuring a dance called ``Moon Beams II.''
   At the McDonald Observatory near Fort Davis, Texas, astronomer
Art Whipple plans to fire a laser beam at the moon during the
darkest part of the eclipse.
   He hopes the light will strike a reflector left on the moon in
1971 by the Apollo 15 astronauts. If his aim is good, a small bit of
the laser light will bounce back, almost a quarter million miles,
and be detected by telescopes at the observatory.
   Usually, Whipple said, the experiment isn't attempted during a
full moon because the natural light is too bright to see the
reflected laser beam. But when the full moon is eclipsed, the
returned beam can be spotted.
   ``It provides us an opportunity to range (fire the laser) in a
period we usually don't even try,'' said Whipple. ``This gives us an
opportunity to sample a portion of the (moon's) orbit we don't
normally get.''
   By clocking the time it takes for light to travel from the laser
to the moon and then back to the McDonald telescopes, scientists are
able to precisely measure the distance between the Earth and its
moon.
   Whipple said astronomers have discovered that the moon is moving
away from the Earth at the rate of about 2 inches a year. The mean
distance between the Earth and moon is about 230,000 miles.
   Observatories from coast to coast are expected to spend at least
some time observing the event.
   Cloudy skies, of course, could spoil eclipse-viewing plans at any
point. And the outlook was not good for much of the East. Forecasts
for today and tonight along the east coast called for thunderstorms.
Observers may have better luck in the central and western areas
where the forecasts generally were for clear to partly cloudy skies.
   With good local weather, some phase of the spectacle should be
visible to about a billion observers. The moon will eclipse within
view of North and South America, western Europe and Africa, and the
Antarctic.
   A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow
created by the Earth blocking the sun's light. The moon, in its
orbit of the Earth, usually passes above or below this shadowline,
but it occasionally follows a path that shades it completely for a
time, an event called a total eclipse.
   During an eclipse, the moon can appear to be a bright coppery red
if there is a clean air between the lunar surface and the observer
on Earth. If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon can dim to an
faint orange color or even fade from view altogether.

   Syrian troops pounded the Christian
enclave from all sides Tuesday and mobilized militia allies in
apparent preparation for an all-out assault on the besieged area.
   Meanwhile in New York, the U.N. Security Council, assembled in an
emergency session by the secretary-general under a rarely used
article of the U.N. charter, called late Tuesday for an immediate
truce in the 14-year-old civil war and Arab League mediation.
   The 15 nations in the council ``urgently appeals to all the
parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firing
and all shelling on land and at sea,'' said Algerian Ambassador
Hocine Djoudi, the council president.
   ``It further appeals to all parties to observe a total and
immediate cease-fire,'' the U.N. declaration read by Djoudi said.
   Christian forces, greatly outnumbered by Syrian soldiers, fought
Syrian troops with tanks and artillery along the southern, eastern
and northern edges of the 310-square-mile enclave north of Beirut.
   Syrian gunners also hammered the 28-mile-long Christian
coastline, the Christians' only escape route.
   Police said 19 people were killed and 99 wounded in fighting. By
police count, 760 people have been killed and 2,045 wounded since
the battles began March 8.
   Casualties Tuesday included two young girls killed when a Syrian
shell hit their home in the Christian port of Byblos, north of
Beirut, and a Moslem woman who was eight months pregnant. Doctors at
Beirut's Makassed Hospital said the baby survived.
   The Syrians, who were reported massing troops and tanks in the
mountains, appeared to be trying to stretch Gen. Michel Aoun's
Christian fighters, who number 20,000 to the Syrians' 40,000.
   Aoun urged the 22,000 Moslem soldiers in the fractured army to
join the Christians.
   ``The hour of unification has struck,'' he said on the radio.
``Our reunion is essential to reunite the partitioned homeland and
defeat the enemy.''
   The poorly equipped Moslem soldiers have largely stayed out the
fighting and were not expected to go against the powerful Syrians.
   International pressure was building for a cease-fire.
   Pope John Paul II, his voice shaking with emotion, said from
Castelgondolfo, Italy: ``In the name of God, I turn to the Syrian
authorities, asking them to stop the bombardment that aims to
destroy ... the whole country.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called the
emergency Security Council meeting Tuesday after none of the 15
council members took any lead in the issue, and hours later the
declaration prepared by the Algerian ambassador that called for
peace in Lebanon was unanimously adopted.
   The U.N. charter allows the secretary-general to call such
meetings when situations are deemed to threaten international
security.
   The last meeting of its type was held in 1979 after Iran seized
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   The Syrians summoned their Moslem and leftist Lebanese militia
leaders to Damascus for a council of war in what appeared to be a
move to escalate the campaign against the Christians.
   The leaders of 16 factions, including Iranian-backed Shiite
groups and radical Palestinian guerrillas, attended.
   Syria's state-run Damascus Radio pledged that Aoun ``will be
defeated not by the Syrian army, but by the nationalist and Moslem
forces.''
   Syria's tactic in recent years has been to use its militia allies
to do most of the ground fighting while Syrian artillery and armor
provide support, giving Damascus room for diplomatic maneuvering.
   Until the last few days, most militias had stayed stayed out of
the fighting.
   Assem Kanso, leader of the Lebanese chapter of Syria's ruling
Baath Socialist Party, said after the meeting: ``We shall fight a
decisive battle with Aoun and we shall foil the plots he is
hatching.''
   The duels began after Aoun, the army commander and head of a
Christian government vying for power with a Moslem Cabinet,
blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of
Beirut.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the Syrians had expanded the confrontation to
cover all the Christian enclave in an apparent effort to shatter
Aoun's forces and deplete their stocks of ammunition.
   He said the Syrian move was ``in apparent preparation for a new
offensive against Aoun's defenses.''
   A Syrian attempt to storm the Christians' strategic Souk el-Gharb
garrison on Sunday was repulsed.
   Aoun said he expected the Syrians to strike at the Upper Metn
area, north of Souk al-Gharb.
   ``They'll try again and again and again,'' said a spokesman for
Aoun's command.
   An Israeli legislator said Israel planned to warn Syria of
certain lines it should not cross in Lebanon. If Syria passes these
points, the Israeli military might intervene, said Uzi Landau of the
right-wing Likud bloc following a report by the defense minister.
   Officials have said in the past that Israel would not tolerate
Syrian troops south of the Awali river, about 25 miles from Israel's
border, or into areas from which Israel withdrew in 1985 in the
Bekaa Valley.

<HEAD>Disabled Workers Drop in Earnings, Rate of Employment</HEAD>

   The handicapped are losing earning power
because those who do manage to find jobs often get low-level
positions with little chance for advancement, says a disabled
Vietnam veteran from South Dakota.
   Disabled men earned 64 percent as much as male employees in
general in 1987, while disabled women made 62 percent of the amount
earned by all female workers, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.
   That was down from 77 percent for handicapped men and 69 percent
for disabled women in 1980, the report said.
   One major reason, speculated Gene Murphy of Sioux Falls, S.D., is
that handicapped workers are often placed in a limited type of job
and simply left there.
   ``Companies say, well, how can he ever move up. They give him a
job in the back room, sorting mail, and they don't ever look at him
again. He isn't reviewed when they advance other employees,'' said
Murphy, a disabled Vietnam veteran who directs the South Dakota
office of Disabled American Veterans.
   Many companies are leery of hiring the disabled, he added, noting
that companies may fear having to spend money on special
accommodations or that the worker will be out sick a lot.
   That may be partly why the employment rate among the disabled has
also declined in the 1980s, Murphy speculated. ``It's harder for the
really disabled veteran or individual to become employed.''
   Other factors in that drop could include concern by the
handicapped over losing their Medicare and Medicaid benefits, and
the lack of strong laws encouraging hiring the disabled, said Paul
Hippolitus, director of plans, projects and services for the
President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped.
   For disabled men, the share working full-time fell from 29.8
percent in 1981 to 23.4 percent in 1988, the Census Bureau reported.
Disabled women increased slightly, with 11.4 percent working
full-time in 1981, growing to 13.1 percent in 1988.
   Part-time disabled male workers dropped from 41.9 percent to 35.8
percent; part-time female workers rose from 23.5 percent to 27.5
percent.
   Laws mandating equal employment for the disabled do not cover all
employers and have failed to have a major impact, Hippolitus said in
a telephone interview.
   As to the relative income decline, Hippolitus agreed with Murphy
that many companies ``think only in terms of entry-level positions
(for the disabled) and tend to leave them there.''
   ``People with disabilities have the greatest problems with upward
mobility and career advancement. They are perceived as fitting into
some particular area but not as moving up. As everybody else moves
up the career ladder they don't,'' Hippolitus said.
   The Census Bureau study, the first to compare the employment of
disabled people over time, does not include explanations for the
changes in income and employment. It is based on the Current
Population Survey, which conducts interviews with about 60,000
households every month.
   The report classified people as disabled if they reported a
health problem that prevented them from working or limited the types
of work they could do, but it did not specify particular types of
disabilities. The study covered people ages 16 to 64.
   Average earnings of disabled males rose from $12,579 in 1980 to
$15,497 in 1987, but in the same period earnings of all male workers
climbed from $16,362 to $24,095.
   For disabled women, earnings rose from $5,335 to $8,075 while
earnings of all women went from $7,770 to $13,000.
   The years used to compare employment rates differ slightly from
those used to compare income because, while people were asked about
their disabilities at the time of the study, they were asked to list
their earnings in the prior year.
   The employment figures for the disabled in 1988 also disclosed
that blacks were most likely to be disabled, at 13.7 percent,
compared with 8.2 percent of Hispanic Americans and 7.9 percent of
whites.

   A federal grand jury is investigating whether
Alexandria mystery pilot Thomas Root or his law firm falsified a
Federal Aviation Administration document last year, the Washington
Post reports in today's editions.
   The document reportedly shows the FAA signed off on a broadcast
tower proposed by one of Root's clients, saying the radio tower
would pose no danger to aircraft.
   The document was needed to continue plans for a new FM radio
station in Kirksville, Mo., the newspaper reports. It was approved.
   But for several months federal officials have been trying to
determine whether the FAA ever filled out the approval form, the
Post quotes sources as saying.
   An FAA official said the technician whose name appears on the
suspect document has testified before the grand jury.
   Falsifying a government document is a criminal violation, an FAA
spokeswoman said.
   The grand jury investigation is one of several legal questions
facing the 36-year-old pilot and lawyer, who survived a bizarre
six-hour plane trip, a crash into the Atlantic Ocean and an
unexplained gunshot wound last month.

<HEAD>Percentage of Unemployed Collecting Benefits Dropping</HEAD>

   The share of jobless workers who get
unemployment insurance has never been lower, mainly due to stricter
government regulations and a shift to a service economy, a private
research group says.
   Only 31.5 percent of all unemployed workers _ 2.1 million out of
6.7 million _ received benefits in the average month last year, the
liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said Tuesday.
   That percentage tied the record low measured in 1987, and was the
sixth straight year that the proportion receiving assistance has not
improved.
   Researchers at the Washington-based center conceded that the
figure was not as alarming as it appears on its surface, because
large numbers of jobless people do not qualify for public
assistance. Nonetheless, they said the finding is significant
because it shows that the public safety net is shrinking.
   ``The record low level of unemployment insurance coverage in 1988
not only indicates an economic security problem for today's
unemployed, but it also may be a harbinger of what will occur in the
event of a new recession,'' the group's report said.
   The center calculated the figures using Department of Labor
statistics.
   Isaac Shapiro, a researcher at the center who helped write the
report, attributed the high number of jobless people without
insurance to a tendency for workers to be out of work longer than
before. Public unemployment programs expire after a fixed period,
usually 26 weeks for state aid and 13 additional weeks for federal
benefits that last year were available in only one state: Alaska.
   Shapiro cited federal and state eligibility restrictions that
were tightened during the 1980s. He said another factor was the
increase in service jobs at the expense of manufacturing positions,
where workers are more likely to be notified by their union or
company that they can apply for assistance.
   ``With a service economy, it's less likely people might know
they're eligible,'' he said.
   Mary Ann Wyrsch, director of unemployment insurance in the
Department of Labor, did not dispute the report's statistics.
   But she said many of the jobless don't qualify for unemployment
insurance because they did not work long enough, left their jobs
voluntarily or were fired for adverse actions. Historically, only
about 40 percent of the jobless receive coverage, she said.
   ``We're concerned about the difference between the 40-odd percent
and the 31 percent that is reported'' by the center, she said.
   Between 1955, the earliest year for which figures are available,
and 1984, the percentage of covered workers dropped below 40 percent
only once, when it hit 39.3 percent in 1966.
   The nation's unemployment rate has dropped steadily since 1982,
when it reached 9.7 percent. It was 5.5 percent last year.
   The center said the situation was worst for minorities. Just 21
percent of unemployed blacks and 14 percent of jobless Hispanics
received unemployment benefits last year, according to the report.
   In 28 states and the District of Columbia, two-parent families
with a jobless worker can get other assistance, even if they do not
receive unemployment insurance.
   The proportion of jobless workers receiving benefits last year
varied widely among the states, from 17.3 percent in Florida to 72
percent in Rhode Island.
   Only in four states did most unemployed workers get insurance:
Rhode Island; Massachusetts where 57.3 percent were covered; Alaska
with 51.5 percent; and Vermont with 50.2 percent.
   By contrast, there were 16 states where less than one-in-four
jobless workers was covered: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida,
Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Hampshire,
New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and West
Virginia.

   Leftist opposition supporters and members
of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party hurled bottles,
rocks and sticks at each other as the electoral college met to
decide a disputed state election Tuesday. At least 18 people were
injured, officials said.
   Police used tear gas and sprayed water from a fire truck to break
up the confrontation. Several hundred people had gathered early in
the day outside the Legislative Palace, where the electoral college
held its meeting.
   The Red Cross and Civil Hospital said about 30 people were
treated for inhalation of the fumes, the newspaper La Voz de
Michoacan said. Most were injured after being hit in the head, and
four were in serious condition, the paper said.
   The fire truck, a police car, an ambulance and eight private
vehicles were destroyed in the disturbance in the Michoacan state
capital, 145 miles northwest of Mexico City, the newspaper said.
   Army troops guarded the main square Tuesday night.
   The leftist party has been picketing outside the state government
offices since the July 2 legislative election.
   Official results gave the ruling party, known as PRI, 12 of the
18 directly elected seats and the leftist Democratic Revolutionary
Party, six.
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party claims it won 14 seats and
says voting in the other four districts should be annulled because
of widespread fraud. Six other seats are to be assigned to minority
parties according to the percentage of the vote they received.
   The college was to meet again on Friday to ratify the results and
announce its decision.

<HEAD>Farmers Pay More for Fuel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are paying more for gasoline, diesel
fuel and other forms of energy, but an Agriculture Department
economist says the total bill isn't much different from the early
1970s if inflation is taken into account.
   Economist Richard Nehring also said that the switch from gasoline
to diesel-powered tractors has prompted a sharp reduction in the
amount of fuel used per acre.
   Overall, 1989 farm energy prices are expected to remain above
1988 levels because of higher crude oil costs in recent months,
according to a report by the department's Economic Research Service.
   Energy spending by farmers are forecast to increase about 6
percent from 1988 to around $7.5 billion, reflecting the higher
prices and greater fuel use needed to handle an expansion in crop
acres, the report said.
   Nehring, one of the authors of the report, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday that the $7.5 billion forecast for 1989 farm
energy expenditures will be the highest since 1985 when spending
totaled $9 billion.
   The record farm energy bill, which includes diesel fuel, gasoline
and LP gas from liquefied petroleum, was about $10.2 billion in 1981
at the peak of the oil crunch. In 1974, by comparison, the farm
energy bill was around $3 billion.
   But those are ``nominal'' costs for specific years and don't take
general inflation into account. When that is done, Nehring said, the
farm fuel bill overall won't be much different from 1974.
   For example, using 1967 dollars as a base, the government's
consumer price index for all items increased from an average of
147.7 percent in 1974 to 340.4 percent by 1987 and has continued to
rise.
   Nehring said that the consumption of fuels used by farmers has
declined significantly since the mid-1970s.
   ``Roughly, the consumption of gasoline, diesel fuel and LP per
cultivated acre declined from about 24 gallons in the mid-1970s to
about 15 gallons currently,'' he said. ``That basically reflects the
replacement of gasoline by diesel fuel.''
   In its report, the agency said U.S. refiners paid an average of
$16.50 per barrel in the first quarter of 1989, up about 25 percent
from the last quarter of 1988. For all of this year, crude oil
prices are expected to be in the range of $15 to $20 per barrel.
   Nehring said the peak year was 1981 when crude oil averaged $33
per barrel, triple the $11 of 1976.
   Net imports of oil are expected to rise by more than 10 percent
this year to a daily average of 7 million barrels, or 41 percent of
domestic consumption. The record was 8.6 million barrels a day in
1977, or 47 percent of U.S. consumption. Imports dropped to 4.3
million barrels daily in 1985, only 27 percent of use.
   On-farm use of diesel fuel declined about 3 percent last year due
to the drought, while gasoline and LP use held steady. But with a
return for better weather and larger crop plantings, diesel use by
farmers is expected to jump 14 percent this year.

   The Agriculture Department has allocated $200
million to 46 organizations under the Targeted Export Assistance
program for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Under TEA, as the program is called, various trade associations
get funds to carry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural
products. The program is aimed at countering or offsetting adverse
effects of unfair foreign trade practices on U.S. exports.
   In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of their
own money in carrying out specific projects. The amount of those
contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, the agency that oversees
the program.
   The $200 million announced Tuesday by USDA is the same as for the
current fiscal year, a level set by Congress in 1989 appropriations
legislation.
   Officials said the 1990 allocations will be finalized after
Congress completes work on next year's appropriations bill.
   The largest amount for next fiscal year was $15.4 million
reserved for Cotton Council International to promote raw cotton in
overseas markets, followed by $12.5 million for the California
Raisin Advisory Board.
   Other leading recipients included: American Soybean Association,
$11.5 million; Florida Department of Citrus, $9.9 million; and the
U.S. Meat Export Federation and the Wine Institute, each with $9
million.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has named
Daniel D. Haley, a former California state agricultural official, as
head of the Agricultural Marketing Service.
   The Agriculture Department agency provides marketing services and
regulatory programs for a wide range of commodities nationwide.
   Yeutter said Tuesday that Haley ``brings with him firsthand
experience and knowledge of many complex farm programs that are
imperative'' in the administration of the agency.
   Haley, 44, will take over the $80,700-a-year job Sept. 5.
   Haley was attorney and head lobbyist for Western Growers
Association, Irvine, Calif., from 1983-87, when he was named chief
deputy director of the California department of food and agriculture.
   Jack Parnell, who was named in April as deputy secretary, the
USDA's No. 2 post, had been director of the California department of
food and agriculture since 1987.

   WANTED: Big, beautiful beast, one of
last of dying breed, as possible mate for same. Serious inquiries
only.
   That's the pitch a group of zoologists is making to zookeepers
around the country. Their matchmaking service, a sort of modern-day
Noah's Ark, could be the last hope for many wild animals facing
extinction.
   This ark is fashioned from computer software and cooperation.
   Through it, a black rhino calf was born in Detroit to a mother
swapped from Oklahoma City whose seven previous offspring had lived
less than a month. ``Logistically, it was difficult and expensive,''
said Doris Applebaum, registrar at the Detroit Zoological Park. She
said the switch cost around $6,000, but ``it was well worth it.''
The calf, born in March, was doing well on Tuesday, Applebaum said.
   The black rhino is declining at a rate of 97 percent per
generation, said Nathan Flesness, director of International Species
Information System, which compiles data for the animal swapping
program. The animal's population has plummeted from 70,000 in 1970
to about 3,000 today, and captivity may be the key to its
preservation.
   ``Humans shoot them to sell their horns for enough to retire on
for the rest of their life,'' said Flesness.
   The program, with headquarters here in the Minnesota Zoo, is
called the Species Survival Plan. It was set up by the American
Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums in 1980 with a goal
not only of matching animals, but also of convincing zookeepers that
donating or swapping some of their most prized possessions is in the
long-term interest of their profession.
   Fifty species _ including the gorilla, cheetah and thick-billed
parrot _ so far have climbed aboard the computer ark. Thomas Foose,
the program's coordinator, says he hopes that number will increase
tenfold by the start of the next century.
   The choice of species to include usually comes down to ``the big
and the beautiful,'' said Flesness. ``It's a long way short of
everything, but it's a lot better than doing nothing.''
   Foose's group tracks data, including genealogy and medical
history, compiled by the ISIS on over 96,000 living vertebrate
specimens in 347 zoos and 32 countries.
   Foose says that as a result of the gorilla program, for example,
there is less inbreeding and healthier babies are being born. About
15 gorillas have been born a year for the last 10 years with the
population presently at about 300. ``We've gone from a situation
where that population was declining to one where it's increasing by
about 2 or 3 percent a year,'' he said. ``That's very healthy.''
   Gorilla mating is difficult since long-established pairs tend to
treat each other like brother and sister.
   The solution, Flesness said, is just a plane ride away: ``Put one
of the two partners on airplanes, switch them to another zoo, and
let them make friends.''
   While conservationists once had misgivings about keeping exotic
animals in captivity, they now are realizing the role zoos can play
in preservation, said Flesness.
   Wildlife managers, he said, increasingly realize they have a
small population and that it is often in one place. ``They want to
take their species into captivity for insurance reasons, and they
suddenly move into the same arena, the same set of challenges as
zoos.''
   The Puerto Rican parrot is an example. Forty-three of the birds
exist in the wild on the island, and an equal number live in
captivity there.
   ``If one bad hurricane comes, they'll not only wipe out the wild
birds but at least endanger the ones in the aviary,'' said Flesness.
Conservationists, he said, have agreed that a few of the animals
should be moved to a mainland zoo.
   The prospects of easing animals back into the wild look bleak, he
said, as long as humans keep encroaching on their natural habitat.
   ``The species that are going to make it out there are the ones
that can handle lots of bulldozers, highway disturbance, and little
teeny spots of semi-wild land left,'' he said.
   ``The big ones are the ones that are ... going to go unless we do
something radically different. What's surprising is that they're
going to go in our lifetime.''

<HEAD>US Will Argue Iranian Lawsuit in World Court</HEAD>

   The United States plans to argue its case
before the World Court in a suit by Iran over the U.S. downing of an
Iranian jetliner, but a Bush administration spokesman declines to
say whether the decision will be abided.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher made the announcement
Tuesday, shortly after President Bush told a White House news
conference that he hoped to end a decade-long estrangement from
Tehran and that Iran could help free American hostages held in
Lebanon.
   The U.S. government has offered to pay the families of the 290
passengers and crew members who died July 3, 1988, when the USS
Vincennes shot down the Iranian airbus in the mistaken belief it was
an attacking F-14 fighter.
   However, the United States has refused to give the compensation
to the Iranian government, insisting that it go directly to the
relatives.
   ``We have not gotten an official response yet from Iran'' on
compensation, Boucher said. ``We continue to hope that Iran will do
the right thing for its citizens.''
   Iran filed suit May 17 in the World Court, located at The Hague
and formally known as the International Court of Justice, alleging
that the United States violated the Seattle and Montreal conventions
on civil aviation. The lawsuit demands payment.
   No date for the trial has been set.
   U.S. attorneys argue that civil aviation conventions don't apply
to the Vincennes, which was protecting shipping in the Persian Gulf
during the Iran-Iraq war. Iran pulled out of the war shortly after
the jetliner was shot down.
   ``In this case, the USS Vincennes acted on the belief that the
airliner was a hostile military aircraft,'' Boucher said. ``The mere
fact that this belief was erroneous does not make the act of the
Vincennes unlawful.''
   Boucher, asked whether the U.S. decision to participate in the
case means that Washington will respect any ruling by the court,
said:
   ``I don't think you can say it is an irrevocable decision binding
us to whatever happens. We have the inherent right of self-defense.
We wouldn't accept limitations on that right.''
   The decision to argue the suit, Boucher said, ``shows the U.S.
desire to work within the court. ... It shows our willingness to
support the work of the court in appropriate cases.''
   The decision was disclosed against the backdrop of efforts to
restore diplomatic relations with Tehran and win Iranian help in
freeing American hostages.
   ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran for the rest of our
lives,'' Bush said. ``I think that if Iran decided they wanted those
hostages to come out of there, there would be a good likelihood that
that would happen, perhaps not with certainty, but a good
likelihood.''
   The Reagan administration dubbed the 15-member panel a
``propaganda forum'' in 1984, when Nicaragua took the United States
to court to seek an injunction against U.S. support for the Contras.
   The United States walked out halfway through the proceedings,
saying the court had no jurisdiction. After 17 months, the court
ordered an immediate halt to all American aid to the Contras.
   The court is reviewing a Nicaraguan demand for U.S. compensation
for damages inflicted by the rebels during their seven-year
insurgency. The United States isn't participating in that procedure.
   ``We did appear in the Nicaragua case in order to enable the
court to determine whether it has jurisdiction,'' Boucher said.
``The court's decision in that case we found to be untenable.''
   Since the 1985 walkout, the United States has been involved in
two other cases, losing both times.
   The court ruled last month that Italian authorities had legally
confiscated the Sicilian branch of a U.S. electronics company in the
late 1960s. In 1988, the Reagan administration suffered a defeat
when the court ruled that Washington's plan to close down the U.N.
mission of the Palestine Liberation Organization in New York
violated international law.

<TEXT>
   Remember all that talk about pork rinds during
last year's campaign? Forget it. About the only place you can find
them in the White House is in a vending machine in the press area.
   White House aides say the president rarely munches on pork rinds
while working in the Oval Office. In fact, his favorite snack
appears to be popcorn.
   And, while jelly beans used to reign supreme in the Reagan White
House, these are days of candy wars in the top corridors of power at
the White House.
   Chief of Staff John Sununu keeps a full bowl of licorice outside
his office. It serves as the same social gathering point for staff
members as water coolers do in other offices.
   A rival bowl of confections _ candy-coated chocolate M&amp;Ms _ sits
outside the Oval Office and has its own flock of devotees.
   Last week, a minor rebellion erupted after some unidentified _
but health-conscious _ staffer replaced the M&amp;Ms outside the
president's office with what may have looked like pork rinds at
first glance, but that turned out to be oat bran cereal.
   The oat bran went nearly untouched. The crowd grew bigger at
Sununu's licorice bowl.
   After a few days of protest, the dietary experiment was halted.
The M&amp;Ms are back.
   Meanwhile, pork rinds, while scarce at the White House, are
regularly put out in Bush's cabin aboard Air Force One.
   The president and the staff that emulates him by jogging, playing
tennis and horseshoes and riding exercise bikes apparently devotes
more time to exercise than nutrition.
   Sununu, meanwhile, is one who hasn't been caught up in the recent
exercise binge. His idea of exercise, claim staff members, is
playing computer games _ particularly mathematical ones.
   Asked why he hadn't been swept up in the fitness craze, the
stocky Sununu told a reporter: ``Hey, listen, I wish I had more
time, and I should probably have more discipline.
   ``I've been playing a little basketball with the kids at home,''
he added.
   But he made it clear that you won't see him jogging alongside the
president during Bush's three-week vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine,
which begins today.
   ``I think it's great'' that the president can engage in such
activities, said his chief of staff. ``I think it adds to his
capacity.''

   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, a recent lunch guest at the White
House, was asked by reporters about Bush's state of mind in the
midst of the recent hostage crisis.
   ``I think remarkably calm, peaceful,'' Law said, speaking on the
driveway outside the White House.
   ``I think the president is a very competent person. And he
listens, he's interested. He has the ability to ask pretty probing
questions. And I experienced all that during the course of the
meal.''
   The cardinal went on to say he counts himself among Bush's
friends.
   ``It's a very good, close, warm relationship. I feel as though,
if I have something that I wanted to discuss with the president that
I could easily contact him.''
   He paused a moment, then added: ``I would hope that I would never
abuse that because, God knows, I read someplace that he's got 10,000
very close personal friends.
   ``When you're one among 10,000 ... you don't want to overdo
that.''

   President Bush says he wouldn't hesitate to use
military force if he thought that would safely rescue the eight
Americans being held hostage in Lebanon.
   However, the president said he didn't ``want to be responsible
for the loss of innocent life.''
   ``But if I could find a way to take those hostages, get them and
bring them out, and that required using the military force of the
United States, make no mistake about it _ I would do it in an
instant,'' Bush said Tuesday at his 21st formal news conference
since taking office seven months ago.
   Bush stressed the uncertainties that involve any military
response when asked why he had not retaliated for the murder of
hostage Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   Bush, who embarks today on a 20-day vacation to his oceanfront
retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine, again signaled that he is willing
to work to improve the bitter U.S.-Iranian relations of the last
decade.
   ``We don't have to be hostile with Iran for the rest of our
lives,'' the president said. ``We've had a good relationship with
them in the past.''
   The first step, he said, is for the Islamic republic to stop
supporting terrorism and to pressure the Lebanese kidnappers to
release their American captives.
   ``I think that if Iran decided they wanted those hostages to come
out of there, there would be a good likelihood that that would
happen.''
   Noting conflicting signals from the new Iranian leadership about
rapprochement with the West, Bush said ``the jury is still out as to
what has happened internally ... in Iran.''
   He said he can't say the chances of a breakthrough on the
hostages are closer today than three weeks ago, ``but we're going to
keep on trying.''
   On another matter, Bush previewed the national anti-drug strategy
he and drug czar William J. Bennett will send to Congress on Sept. 5.
   The drug strategy ``will target all aspects of the problem,''
including new efforts to cut off drugs at the source as well as
tougher penalties for casual users, Bush said.
   ``I think the day of tolerance for those who break the law in
using drugs is over,'' he said. ``We are going to expand federal
expenditures'' for the drug fight not by raising taxes but through
``some reallocation of resources.''
   Bush gave no specifics, but said his budget office was drawing up
a list of programs from which funds could be diverted.
   On other topics, the president:
   _Refused to rule out the possibility of abducting Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega to face drug-trafficking charges.
``I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' he said.
   _Declared he was ``very comfortable'' with budget director
Richard Darman's complaint that the Federal Reserve was keeping
interest rates too high.
   _Praised Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and Larkin Smith, R-Miss.,
killed in separate plane crashes, as ``outstanding public servants''
who gave their lives trying ``to better the lot of mankind.''
   _Said that if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, the Shiite cleric seized
last month by Israeli commandos, were indicted for the kidnapping of
Higgins, ``I would be remiss if I didn't try to see him brought to
trial.''
   _Suggested ``some kind of international effort'' to offer
military assistance to countries that request help in eradicating
drug production.
   _Expressed the hope that ``the legal process (can) go on without
a lot of hype'' against suspended State Department diplomat Felix
Bloch, suspected of spying.

<HEAD>NHTSA Steps Up Nissan Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal engineers say they are stepping up
their investigation into complaints that as many as 1.5 million
Nissan cars manufactured between 1982 and 1984 have a dangerous
seating defect.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday
that it had received 96 complaints that the cars' seat backs shifted
backward suddenly and without warning.
   The agency considers the allegations serious enough to upgrade a
preliminary evaluation into an engineering analysis, said spokesman
Tim Hurd. The change means engineers will study actual seat backs to
determine whether they are defective, as opposed to paperwork
analysis.
   Nissan spokesman Don Spetner said the company was reviewing the
decision and would have no immediate comment.
   The Nissan action was among several announced Tuesday, including
new or upgraded investigations of models sold under the nameplates
of Ford, Mercury, Peugeot, Toyota, Hyundai, BMW, Buick, Oldsmobile
and Pontiac and the closing of other investigations involving
Hyundai, Lincoln, Chevrolet and Ford.
   ``We've had large recalls of other cars for seat-back failures,''
Hurd said of the Nissan action. ``It's a hazard. You can lose
control of your car if the seat back suddenly fails.''
   Complaints to NHTSA have blamed 22 accidents and 13 injuries on
the alleged defect, he said.
   The agency's engineers are examining these Nissan models
manufactured during the 1982, 1983 and 1984 model years: Maxima,
Pulsar, Sentra, Stanza, 200SX, 300ZX, 510 and 720.
   NHTSA also launched an investigation of 1987 and 1988 Ford
Escorts and Mercury Lynxes after 13 complaints that safety belts had
failed. Four injuries have been blamed on the belts' alleged failure
to restrain occupants during accidents, Hurd said.
   Also, NHTSA granted a petition requesting an engineering analysis
of the 1989 Peugeot Model 405. Six complaints have been filed about
malfunctions of the passive restraint system in 2,200 cars, Hurd
said.
   The agency also reported opening preliminary investigations of:
   _Stabilizer bar breakage in 400,000 Toyota Tercels from model
years 1982 through 1988.
   _Passive restraint system problems in the 1987 Hyundai Excel.
   _Rear-belt failure in the 1989 Ford Festiva.
   _Brake dragging and locking in 30,000 BMW models _ the 325,
524TD, 528E and 5351 from the 1985 through 1987 model years.
   _Parking cable wearing in several 1985-1987 General Motors cars:
the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, the Pontiac Grand Prix, the Oldsmobile
Cutlass and the Buick Regal.
   _Front wheel drive steering column locking in 500,000 Chrysler
cars with tilt steering wheels sold under Chrysler, Plymouth and
Dodge nameplates.
   The agency also raised several preliminary evaluations to the
engineering analysis level. One was a probe of 1,064 Buick LeSabres,
Oldsmobile 98s and Pontiac Bonnevilles from 1986 and 1987 in the
wake of complaints about jammed brakes. Another involved safety belt
failures in 6,282 Toyota Land Cruisers.
   The agency reported discontinuing a probe into seat-back failures
in Ford passenger cars made between 1983 and 1986, finding
insufficient grounds to proceed.
   The agency closed three other investigations, finding there was
``no defect trend.'' The investigations were into complaints of:
   _Heater core failure in the 1986 Hyundai Excel GL.
   _Fuel filler pipe spurting in the 1988 Lincoln Town Car.
   _Brake lamp switch problems in the 1989 Chevrolet Celebrity.

<HEAD>Cuomo, Bush Official Tangle Over Shoreham</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, unsuccessful in a
bid for federal approval to tear down the Shoreham nuclear plant,
still insists the new plant on Long Island will not open.
   ``No matter what their intent is, they're not going to be able to
open this plant,'' Cuomo said Tuesday after a nearly one-hour
meeting with President Bush.
   But Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said the plan to tear
down a completed nuclear power plant before it produces any
commercial electricity was ``an upside-down energy policy that
defies any kind of logical description.''
   Bush, according to Moore, wants the Shoreham plant ``mothballed''
so it can possibly be resurrected later.
   ``I don't think anything was done to change the governor's mind.
I don't think anything was done to change the president's mind,''
Moore told reporters outside the White House after the meeting.
   Cuomo said ``the most productive part of the meeting is that the
(energy) planners would get together'' sometime later to discuss
energy policy. The governor also said he will continue to pursue
court challenges to the federal government's authority to intervene
in the Shoreham case.
   Cuomo declined to characterize Bush's reaction to his
presentation, but said it was a positive sign that the president
agreed to the meeting.
   At issue is New York's plan to dismantle the $5.5 billion
Shoreham plant as part of its agreement with the Long Island
Lighting Co., which would sell the plant to the state for $1. In
exchange, LILCO gets guaranteed rate increases of about 5 percent
for a decade.
   Although the deal has been approved by the state and LILCO
stockholders, the U.S. Department of Energy has said it will try to
prevent the deal by opposing transfer of Shoreham's license.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must approve the transfer and
the Energy Department has tried to slow that process by asking the
commission to order its own environmental review of the impact of
closing Shoreham and using alternative energy sources. The Energy
Department also wants the NRC to stop LILCO from further reducing
staff at the plant.
   Last week, the Energy Department joined a lawsuit that challenges
the Shoreham shutdown on environmental grounds.
   Cuomo requested the meeting with Bush after White House chief of
staff John Sununu said the plant should be mothballed _ put in
storage, in effect _ for a few years until Long Island residents
realized they needed the power the plant would provide.
   Cuomo met Tuesday with Bush, Sununu, Moore and deputy chief of
staff Andrew Card.
   Cuomo, on a flight back to Albany, N.Y., told reporters that
``Henson Moore is an old politician who doesn't write sentences, he
writes slogans. ... They talk in slogans, they really do. And when
they talk in sentences, they get in trouble.''
   Cuomo was referring to Moore's contention that Shoreham could be
operated by the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency buying
the plant under the agreement. Cuomo said state law prohibits the
agency from operating a nuclear power plant.
   Cuomo argues that Shoreham would be unsafe to operate because
Long Island couldn't be evacuated in case of an accident. But Moore
said the NRC has approved an evacuation plan for Long Island and
that Cuomo simply was personally opposed to opening the plant.

<HEAD>SBA Overhauls Set-Aside Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Small Business Administration is
overhauling its minority set-aside program in response to the
Wedtech bribery and influence-peddling scandal.
   The regulations, issued Tuesday and effective immediately, put
into effect legislation signed nine months ago by President Reagan.
They are designed to minimize political influence on the agency's
21-year-old program under which companies owned by blacks,
Hispanics, Asians, Indians and economically disadvantaged women are
given preference in the awarding of government contracts.
   Among the changes:
   _The director of the program will be a career employee of the
agency, rather than a political appointee. SBA Administrator Susan
Engeleiter named Erline Patrick, a former staff aide to the Senate
Small Business Committee, to the post.
   ``The person in charge will not have to respond as much to the
political pressures,'' Patrick said.
   _Companies that misrepresent their status as minority-owned will
be subject to stiffer penalties. The maximum fine was increased from
$50,000 to $500,000 and the top jail term from five years to 10
years.
   _For the first time, competitive bidding is required among
minority-owned companies for manufacturing contracts over $5 million
and product and service contracts over $3 million.
   _The length of time a company may get special preference was
lengthened from seven years to nine years, but companies will be
expected to derive a steadily decreasing percentage of their
revenues from contracts awarded under the program.
   _Owners of eligible companies must have net worth of less than
$250,000, excluding equity in their home or business, when they
enter the program. The old standard was $750,000, including home or
business equity.
   _The agency must rule on applications within 90 days.
   Patrick, at a news conference, said about 3,000 companies
participate. She said the net worth requirement and the initiation
of competitive bidding may discourage new participants, but she said
she hoped the deadline for decisions would boost participation.
   When Congress passed the law last year, Sen. Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, said it was
aimed at preventing the recurrence of Wedtech-type scandals.
   Wedtech Corp., a South Bronx military contractor, was awarded
more than $250 million in no-bid contracts in just four years but
became the subject of five different state and federal criminal
investigations.
   E. Robert Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer and close friend of
former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, was convicted earlier this
month of illegally receiving $425,000 from Wedtech to influence
government officials in the company's bids for contracts.
   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., faces trial next month on charges he
and his wife illegally accepted cash and jewelry from Wedtech.

<HEAD>Algae Substances Show Anti-AIDS Activity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government experiments show that four fatty
substances found in common ocean algae are ``strikingly active''
against the AIDS virus, scientists say.
   Algae extracts protected cells of the human immune system against
attack by the human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes
AIDS, a team of scientists for the National Cancer Institute
reported.
   The substances, called sulfolipids, are structural components of
membranes of chlorophyll-containing cell components in many plants,
algae and micro-organisms.
   Their viral-fighting ability had not been known before and was
discovered in the cancer institute's program to screen substances
for potential AIDS-fighting ability.
   ``The pure compounds were strikingly active,'' with all four
showing similar activity, according to the report in Tuesday's
Journal of the National Cancer Institute. However, the effectiveness
varied according to which line of test cells was being used.
   Compounds with similar chemical structures gave no protection
against the virus.
   The test could not show how the sulfolipids protected against
viral activity, the report said.
   ``The sulfolipids that we have identified represent an intriguing
new structural class of potential AIDS-antiviral compounds,'' the
scientists wrote.
   ``Because of the urgency for identification and comparative
clinical evaluation'' of new anti-AIDS drugs, ``the Decision Network
Committee of the National Cancer Institute has selected the
sulfolipid class as a high priority for further pre-clinical
investigation and for evaluation of feasibility as a candidate for
clinical testing,'' wrote the team.
   So far, only one drug, zidovudine or AZT, has been shown to be
effective against AIDS, though some others can help fight diseases
that result from AIDS.
   The authors were institute researchers Kirk R. Gustafson, John H.
Cardellina II, Richard W. Fuller, Owen S. Weislow, Rebecca F. Kiser,
Kenneth M. Snader and Michael R. Boyd, along with Gregory M.L.
Patterson of the University of Hawaii.

<HEAD>Military Police Flood Newspapers with `Dirty Laundry'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers are being flooded with anonymous letters
from an unusual source _ disgruntled gendarmes, the military
corpsmen who make up almost half of France's 200,000 police officers.
   Government officials have replied by saying reforms will be
proposed this fall, and in the meantime the gendarmes should think
about the soldier's duty not to air the military's dirty laundry in
public.
   National and regional newspapers have received dozens of letters,
each purporting to speak for a large number of gendarmes who are
unhappy about pay scales, long hours and poor living conditions in
barracks.
   The 90,000 gendarmes are responsible for police duties on most
French highways and in rural areas, although they also sometimes
patrol in cities. Special squads fight terrorism, monitor river
traffic and patrol airports, among other tasks.
   The line between the duties of the gendarmerie and the national
police is not always clear, and leads to frequent conflict between
the two bodies. It occasionally leads to arrests of gendarmes by
police or vice-versa.
   The gendarmerie traces its origins back centuries to the
``Marechaussee,'' medieval soldiers called to catch bandits and
highwaymen. It got its name and current status in 1791, at the
height of the French Revolution.
   ``It's a unique organization that exists in no other country in
Europe,'' Napoleon once said, according to a history of the
gendarmes. ``It's the most efficient way to maintain the tranquility
of a country. ... It's a half-civil, half-military surveillance,
spread over the entire territory.''
   Gendarmes answer to the Defense Ministry. They are trained, paid
and expected to work and live like soldiers, while doing exactly the
same tasks as police. Unlike police, they cannot form unions, and
are not paid overtime.
   Speaking out publicly means certain disciplinary action under
military rules.
   An anonymous letter published in the regional daily Ouest-France
complained about ``the 120 hours on-call each week, including 60 to
80 hours working, no overtime pay or compensatory time off and no
compensation for working weekends and holidays.''
   Starting pay is $1,135 monthly for the unmarried, and pay
increases on a sliding scale for those with families. Several
letters said that, once unpaid overtime is taken into account,
gendarmes barely get the minimum wage.
   A letter published by the national daily France-Soir from an
anonymous gendarme's wife who signed herself ``Madame X'' denounced
``the degradation of family life.'' She said the gendarmerie makes
life ``abominable for couples, leading many of them to divorce.''
   Married gendarmes live in apartments built into the barracks,
with widely varying amenities.
   The first anonymous letters appeared in regional newspapers in
eastern France in early August and only gradually attracted national
attention. Soon there was a flood, with the French news agency
Agence France-Presse counting almost 20 over the weekend of Aug.
12-13.
   Gerard Renon, the junior minister in the Defense Ministry, said
in a television interview that the letters dealt with ``problems we
know about and are working on.''
   Other government officials said a proposal would be presented in
the fall to redistribute the work force, upgrade the barracks,
assure at least some free time to the gendarmes and possibly
increase the number of draftees allowed to do their military service
as auxiliary gendarmes.
   The director-general of the gendarmerie, Regis Mourier, issued a
statement saying he was aware of the problems and was working on
them.
   Meanwhile, he said, the gendarmes should keep quiet, ``not just
from respect for the obligations of the military status, but from
respect for the institution, its history and its place in the
nation,'' Mourier said.
   The call to silence just unleashed more letters.
   ``It's not by telling us to shut up that the problems will be
solved,'' said an anonymous letter published in the daily Le
Populaire du Centre de Limoges in central France. ``Watch out,
general officers and elected officials, disgust and discontent is
getting established in this good old Marechaussee.''

   The American Museum of Natural History has
decided that three heads are better than one when it comes to
dinosaurs.
   The museum has revised its opinion of what the head of an
apatosaurus _ commonly known as a brontosaurus _ looked like.
   But because the museum's 17-foot-tall, 66-foot-long apatosaurus
skeleton was assembled in 1905 and contains bones that are 140
million years old, it was too fragile to withstand a head transplant.
   So the museum has created an exhibit featuring three heads. One
is a copy of the head now on the apatosaurus skeleton, another is a
model that scientists now believe more closely resembles the
apatosaurus' real head, and the third is the head of a close
relative of the extinct beast.
   ``We may have to change our minds again once we find a skeleton
with a skull attached, but we think this is the most likely guess
based on the available evidence until we actually find a complete
skeleton with a skull attached,'' said Lowell Dingus, exhibit
coordinator.
   No one has ever found an apatosaurus skeleton with a skull
attached. The skull created for the 1905 model skeleton was based on
that of a dinosaur believed to be close kin, a camarasaurus.
   Since then, paleontologists have changed their minds about the
apatosaurus' likely relatives. A paper published in 1978 argued that
the diplodocus was a closer kin than the camarasaurus, implying the
apatosaurus had a longer, sleeker head than had been believed.
   When the museum tried to behead its apatosaurus in preparation
for a new skull, ``it sent vibrations down the skeleton and a couple
of the ribs fell off and broke,'' Dingus said.

   A 7-year-old who can't get enough baseball
figured a way to get neighborhood kids to come out to his local
sandlot. He bribed them with soda pop.
   ``I like baseball a lot,'' Billy Green said Tuesday. ``I played
little league for Bartonville `Little Dream Hut' this summer. But
the season's over now. I didn't have anyone to play with.''
   He tried to interest some ``big kids'' in a game, but they turned
him down because they considered him too small.
   Not to be deterred in his quest for one last game before he
enters third grade Aug. 24, Billy decided to up his offer.
   With the help of his 10-year-old sister, Angie, Billy passed out
hand-lettered fliers: ``Baseball Game, Held By Billy Green at
Pleasant Vallay School, Friday, Aug. 11, 1989. 3:00.''
   The key to the flier was the fine print at the bottom: ``Water
and cups supplied. Also Coke, 7-Up and Root Beer. Bring your bats,
gloves and balls!''
   Billy stuck fliers under doors in the neighborhood, and got more
than a dozen boys and girls ages 7 to 14 to turn out.
   ``Some of the big kids are kind of lazy,'' Angie said. ``You kind
of need a bribe to get them to play.''
   The game had a story-book ending as well. Billy doubled and his
team won, 5-1.

   Southfork Ranch can claim a real Ewing now.
   Cheryl Lee McClanahan gave birth to the first baby born at the
ranch on Sunday. So she decided to make a concession in naming her
10-pound baby boy: Tory Lee Ewing Crick.
   ``We couldn't fit in J.R.,'' Ms. McClanahan said.
   The Dallas woman was a week away from her expected delivery date,
but she decided to accompany her fiance, Chase Crick, to the ranch
just east of Parker. Crick had won a two-day stay at the ranch,
where exterior scenes for the ``Dallas'' television series are shot.
   When she realized she was about to give birth, she called a
midwife who helped her deliver the child.

<HEAD>Trident 2 Missile Failure Could Set Back Program</HEAD>

   The second explosion of a
submarine-launched Trident 2 missile in five months could again
delay Navy plans to send its newest, deadliest weapon on operational
patrol.
   The original December target was put off until March 1990 by the
first failure. Now the March goal is in jeopardy.
   One of the 44-foot, $23.7 million missiles exploded Tuesday
seconds after it was launched from the nuclear submarine Tennessee
while it cruised submerged about 200 miles southeast of Cape
Canaveral.
   The Navy said the blowup caused no injuries nor did it damage the
submarine or a nearby support ship.
   Officials said the problem occurred shortly after the missile
cleared the surface and ignited, reminiscent of the first Trident 2
submarine launch on March 21. That missile blew apart four seconds
after it was launched by the crew of the Tennessee.
   Investigators traced the problem in March to a mechanical linkage
responsible for moving the rocket steering nozzles back and forth.
The faulty part was redesigned.
   On Aug. 2, the Tennessee launched a Trident 2 with the design
changes on the missile's first underwater success, and Navy hopes
were buoyed.
   There was no immediate indication whether the two failures were
related, and officials said they won't know exactly what went wrong
Tuesday until they study radio telemetry tapes of the missile's
behavior.
   There was no immediate assessment of what impact the latest
failure will have on the Trident 2 operational schedule. The first
failure set back the plan three months.
   The Navy had planned about six more underwater tests before
sending the Tennessee on operational patrol in March with 24 of the
nuclear-tipped weapons. Nine Trident 2 submarines are planned.
   Each missile is capable of propelling as many as 10 nuclear
warheads to different targets more than 4,600 miles away.
   Nineteen Trident 2s were test-fired from a land launch pad before
sea trials began. The Navy rated 15 of them successful.

<HEAD>Riverboat Gambling Passes in Two of Three Iowa Counties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to allow riverboat gambling
passed in two Iowa counties, but a third county surprised some
people by sinking the floating casinos plan by a wide margin.
   Voters in Dubuque County, the largest of the three counties,
approved the proposal by a 2-1 margin. With about 25 percent of
voters going to the polls, 7,793 or 66 percent voted yes and 3,913
or 33 percent disapproved.
   The Dubuque County vote was expected, but Allamakee County's
rejection didn't seem to be in the cards, some said, because there
was little organized opposition.
   ``It was very quiet. There were a couple of letters to the
editor. It's surprising,'' said deputy county auditor Marian Smith.
   With 23 percent of eligible voters in the extreme northeast Iowa
country going to the polls, 1,099 turned down the measure and 645
voted for it.
   In Clayton County, with about 20 percent of voters going to the
polls, the measure narrowly passed 1,122 to 1,060.
   ``It was hard to get an indication of what was going to happen.
There wasn't any organized opposition,'' said Robyn Denning, mayor
of McGregor in Clayton County. ``I'm just glad it passed.''
   Terry Harrmann, chairman of Dubuque's Riverboat Referendum
Committee, said he didn't expect a close vote.
   ``Dubuque is on the move,'' Harrmann said. ``Dubuque voters have
seen fit to say `Let's move forward, let's not rest on our
laurels.'''
   Six more Iowa counties along the Mississippi River will hold
special elections this month on the plan.
   Iowa's new riverboat gambling law allows gambling on excursion
boats, beginning April 1, 1991, in counties where voters first
approve it by a majority vote in a referendum. The Legislature
limited betting to $5 per play and set a $200 limit on losses.
   Boats can offer blackjack, roulette, slot machines, dice games
and video gambling.
   The state Racing and Gaming Commission will decide how many
licenses to grant and where the boats will dock, but that decision
isn't expected until next year.
   Harrmann said the City Council will select a possible site for a
dock if Dubuque acquires a license. He said supporters have
contacted three or four excursion boat operators to possibly operate
a floating casino.
   One of them is Fried-Schegan and Associates of San Diego.
   Company President Frank Fried said: ``We're confident that
Dubuque County made the right decision and applaud their efforts.
Passage of this referendum means that this region is one step closer
to bringing a first-class national tourist attraction to the
Midwest.''
   Special elections are scheduled Aug. 22 for voters in Lee and Des
Moines counties. An Aug. 29 referendum is set for voters in Scott,
Jackson, Clinton and Muscatine counties.
   In western Iowa, along the Missouri River, petitions are being
circulated in Mills and Woodbury counties. No dates have been set
for referendums there, the secretary of state's office said.

<HEAD>Town Agonizes Over Fate of Soldier Missing in Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM RON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROSH HAAYIN, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lebanese hostage crisis has
increased anxieties in this community, where residents pray for one
of their own _ a soldier who according to news accounts may have
died more than three years ago.
   Rachamim Alsheikh, 23, was captured on Feb. 17, 1986, when Shiite
Moslem extremists ambushed an Israeli convoy.
   Since then, there has been no word from Alsheikh or Yossi Fink,
also 23, who was taken in the same attack.
   Recent reports have said they died of wounds shortly after their
capture by the radical militia Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   A neighbor said the Alsheikhs suffer ``in total silence, seldom
making their anguish public.'' The family declined to be interviewed.
   ``The Alsheikh family's pain is felt by the entire community,''
said the neighbor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They are
never alone, there is always someone from the family or the
neighborhood with them.''
   Rosh Haayin is a small town on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Like
the Alsheikh family, most of its residents are Jewish immigrants
from Yemen.
   The community never forgot Alsheikh's capture, but anxiety over
it was heightened on July 28 when Israeli commandos abducted a
Shiite Moslem cleric reputed to be a leader of Hezbollah in a raid
in southern Lebanon.
   Israel has offered to swap the cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid,
and hundreds of Shiite prisoners for an Israeli navigator shot down
over Lebanon in 1986, Alsheikh and Fink and the 16 Western hostages.
Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
of The AP, abducted 4{ years ago.
   The Sunday Times of London said in an report last weekend,
however, that Obeid's interrogators concluded the two infantrymen
died of wounds shortly after the ambush. The newspaper quoted
unidentified senior sources in the Israeli government.
   Israeli officials, in an effort to reassure the families of the
missing men, said they assume the soldiers are alive unless there is
conclusive proof to the contrary.
   At a public prayer session Monday in Rosh Haayin's synagogue,
Rachamim Alsheikh's father, Shlomo, tearfully recited Psalms and
prayers for his son and other missing Israeli soldiers.
   Hundreds of the town's 13,000 residents attended the service.
   ``Praying may be the only way to save our sons,'' the elder
Alshiekh said.
   Rachamim Alsheikh was captured while serving in the elite Givati
infantry brigade. Under a special arrangement for students who
attended Jewish seminaries, he divided his mandatory military
service between religious studies and combat duty.
   Yehiel Zahavi, 53, a factory worker who has lived across the
street from the Alsheikh house since 1950, described Rachamim as a
``devout young man.''
   Zahavi said Rachamim attended a private Orthodox grade school and
then a seminary in a nearby town. There are six other Alsheikh
children, one of whom has devoted his life to religious studies,
Zahavi said.
   The owner of a neighborhood restaurant described Rachamim as
``innocent about the world.''
   All men and women in Israel, which has a population of 4.2
million, are drafted into the military.
   The abduction of Obeid was portrayed by Israeli leaders as an
example of Israel's ``sacred principle'' that every effort be made
to gain freedom for captured soldiers.
   Rosh Haayin residents remain optimistic in the face of the
conflicting reports about Alsheikh's fate.
   ``I served in the army and in all the wars,'' Zahavi said. ``I
know that the army always takes care of its boys, never abandons
them.''

<HEAD>Agency Gets Criticism For Tranquilizing Pole-Sitting Bear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state agency said it was only
concerned about the safety of residents when it tranquilized a bear
that had ambled up a utility pole, causing her to tumble to the
ground in a shower of sparks.
   The state Department of Game and Fish was criticized Tuesday for
tranquilizing the bear atop the 25-foot pole without first cutting
electrical power or providing a safety net.
   Mark Birkhauser, a conservation officer with the department, said
he received nearly 30 calls Tuesday after television and a local
newspaper showed the bear falling from the pole, contacting
transformer coils that generated the spray of sparks, then trailing
smoke 25 feet to the ground.
   The singed bear survived with a limp after the 7,200-volt shock
and the fall, officials said, but that didn't deter callers.
   ``We've received quite a bit of calls _ primarily criticism.
Public opinion in general seems to think it wasn't handled as well
as it could have been,'' Birkhauser said. ``Most of them would have
liked to have seen us put a net under the pole or let the bear come
back down off the pole on its own.''
   But Birkhauser said public safety was the main concern.
   ``To have put a net would have been difficult and not terribly
smart,'' he said. ``That bear could have came back to and latched on
to the person holding the net.''
   ``The main concerns of callers were that the bear was
tranquilized while too high on the utility pole and no attempt was
made to cushion its fall, and that electrical power wasn't shut off
before the animal was shot down,'' said Merrilyn Segrest, deputy
supervisor at the Animal Humane Association in Albuquerque.
   Department officers shot the bear once on Monday with a
tranquilizer dart on a Northeast Heights rooftop, then again after
it reached the top of the utility pole.
   The bear, believed to be from the Sandia Mountains, was taken to
the Rio Grande Zoological Park, where she is doing well, officials
said. She sustained an electrical burn on her right hind leg.
   The bear was believed to have been searching for her lost cub. A
6-month-old cub was captured Sunday in a mulberry tree in
Albuquerque. The cub, which was being held in the Albuquerque zoo,
is fine, Birkhauser said.
   ``It's just scared and looking for mama,'' he said.

<HEAD>PEN Writers Conference Will Not Focus on Rushdie Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international writers' group that plans to meet
next month in Canada has decided against focusing on the case of
British novelist Salman Rushdie, according to an official.
   Graeme Gibson, president of the Canadian Center of the PEN
Congress, said that although the conference is titled ``The Writer:
Freedom and Power,'' Rushdie's predicament will not receive a great
deal of attention.
   Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' has been in hiding in
Britain since Feb. 14, when the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
called on Moslems to track down the author and kill him.
   Khomeini, Iran's spiritual and political leader until his death
in June, said the novel blasphemed Islam.
   The PEN Congress, an international group of poets, playwrights,
editors, essayists and novelists, will hold its annual conference in
Toronto and Montreal from Sept. 23 to Oct. 1.
   Gibson said the British-based Committee for the Defense of Salman
Rushdie asked that the conference not take up Rushie's situation.
   ``It's very hard to know what to do about it,'' he said. ``It's
certainly part of the territory for PEN, but there is nothing
specific planned at this point. ''
   ``There are others in far worse conditions than Mr. Rushdie, and
in saying this, I'm not minimizing his condition,'' Gibson said.
   Numerous nations that are predominantly Moslem banned Rushdie's
novel after critics said it associated the prophet Mohammed with
prostitutes and suggested that the Koran, Islam's holy book, was the
work of Mohammed rather than Allah.
   Some Western nations pulled the novel from store shelves and
dropped plans to publish it.
   Meanwhile in Stockholm, a Swedish publisher said it will
distribute ``The Satanic Verses'' starting Friday, and will release
another book explaining Islamic principles in two weeks.
   Carl-Otto Bonnier, vice chairman of the publishing house Bonnier,
said the second book is titled ``Islam, Our Belief,'' written by two
Moslem organizations and sponsored by the Islamic Information
Association in Sweden.
   ``It is not a polemic book. It describes Islam in a friendly
way,'' Bonnier said Tuesday, adding that it explains criticisms of
``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``There was never a question of blackmail of any sort,'' he said.
Moslems in Sweden ``want to feel they are getting an opportunity to
make their voices heard.''
   But he also acknowledged the Moslem groups had made it clear that
publishing the book could prevent the kind of violence and protests
that occurred in other countries over its publication.

<HEAD>11 Arrested on Charges They Set Jungle on Fire in the Yucatan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven people have been arrested on charges
they set fires that scorched 370,000 acres of jungle in southeastern
Mexico, the Attorney General's office said.
   The group started fires in the state of Quintana Roo ``for the
purpose of exploiting lumber resources and creating areas for
cultivation and uncontrolled human settlements,'' the office said in
a communique Tuesday.
   Residents near one of the fires told authorities they saw two of
the suspects pour gasoline across a wide area of jungle, then set it
ablaze, the communique said.
   The fires advanced slowly through the jungle for five months
until rain extinguished them in early August.
   Dry wood and other forest litter from Hurricane Gilbert last
September and the late start of the rainy season helped spread the
fires, authorities have said.
   Mexican and foreign experts estimate recovery of the jungle will
take more than 30 years, a spokesman for the Group of 100 Artists
and Intellectuals, an ecological organization, said Tuesday.
   Eight of the 11 were arrested in Mexico City, two in Quintana Roo
and one in the state of Veracruz.
   With 30 others, they had taken over land in Campeche state, also
in the southeast, and set fire to it to open land for cultivation,
the Attorney General's office said. Unable to control the blaze,
they fled to Quintana Roo in late March.
   They were charged with property damage, carrying weapons without
a license, criminal asociation and violation of forestry and
ecological protection laws.
   The communique said some of those arrested Monday have been
involved in fires and illegal land dealings on Ajusco, a mountain at
the southern edge of Mexico City.
   Two of the group were also wanted for various homicides in Mexico
City, the communique said.

<TEXT>
   ABC and NBC laughed all the way to the ratings
bank as their comedy shows took over the top spots in the latest
Nielsen survey.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' led the pack, and NBC claimed the most places
with six while CBS failed to place a single program in the Top 10
for the week ended Aug. 13.
   NBC's ``Cheers,'' in a tight race all summer with ``Roseanne''
for first, was second.
   Other comedies in the Top 10: ABC's ``Wonder Years,'' NBC's
``Dear John,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's ``Golden Girls''
and ABC's ``Coach'' tied, NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' ABC's ``Who's
the Boss?'' and NBC's ``Empty Nest.''
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of
10.9. ABC followed with 9.8 and CBS with 9.1.
   For the season to date, from Sept. 19, 1988, NBC leads with 14.6.
ABC has 11.8 and CBS 11.7. The ratings are the percentage of the
90.4 million homes with television in the United States. The share
is the percentage of sets in use.
   CBS had only three shows in the Top 20 for the week: ``60
Minutes'' in 12th place, ``Designing Women'' in 18th, and part one
of the miniseries ``If Tomorrow Comes'' tied for 19th.
   ABC's new program, ``Primetime Live,'' which made its debut the
week before in 37th place, was in 43rd place.
   It hasn't been a good time for summer shows. ``Knight &amp; Daye''
was in a tie for 44th place and ``13 East'' fell to a tie for 47th
place. ``13 East'' has dropped in the ratings each week since its
debut in 10th place.
   Fox Broadcasting's top show was ``Married ... With Children'' in
36th place. Fox's ``Totally Hidden Video'' was 39th and ``America's
Most Wanted'' was tied for 47th with ``13 East.''
   The only good news for CBS was a victory for its evening news
program. It was first among the news shows with a 9.0 rating. ABC
was second with 8.7 and NBC third with 8.3.

   Iran has begun a crackdown on a lucrative
trade in smuggling Persian rugs to evade strict controls on carpet
exports.
   Last month, authorities in southern Bushehr province seized more
than 750 silk rugs in what the official Islamic Republic News Agency
said was the biggest carpet haul so far. The agency said the rugs
were worth millions of dollars.
   The rugs were hidden inside tanker trucks and would have been
illegally shipped from a port on Iran's Persian Gulf coast, IRNA
said. The agency was monitored in Nicosia.
   Persian Gulf merchants say most smuggled Persian rugs are shipped
across the gulf to the coast of the United Arab Emirates and trucked
to warehouses in Dubai, the region's major trading center.
   The crackdown on carpet smuggling from Bushehr province started
in July following similar campaigns against narcotics and arms
smugglers.
   It followed reports in Iran's state-run media that contraband
carpet exports would soon outstrip legal sales abroad.
   According to official statistics, rug exports earned Iran at
least $260 million last year, or more than one-third of its non-oil
exports. Iranian newspapers estimated another $200 million worth
were smuggled abroad.
   Silk rugs, which cost five times as much as wool ones, account
for about 15 percent of carpets legally sold abroad.
   Dubai merchants say a trickle of legal exports provides the cover
for a huge smuggling network with dealers flying in from Japan and
Western Europe to pick up bargains in Persian carpets.
   Iran's carpet industry used to employ more than 2 million people
who spent the winter months weaving carpets in their villages.
   But production fell sharply following the 1979 Islamic revolution
and the ouster of the monarchy. Political turmoil shut down major
exporting firms and villagers from recession-hit weaving districts
flocked to the cities to seek jobs.
   Soaring inflation meant that imports of fine wools and dyes
needed for high-quality carpets were sharply reduced. It takes
several years to weave a large carpet in a complex multi-colored
design.
   In the revolution's early days, carpet exports were banned on the
grounds they were part of the nation's store of wealth.
   Now, customs officers value carpets before they can be shipped
abroad and exporters have to hand over their foreign currency
earnings to the government in exchange for Iranian rials at an
artificially low rate.
   During the Persian Gulf war between Iran and Iraq, dealers in the
Syrian capital of Damascus stocked up on rugs sold by Iranian
tourists given government-paid trips to Syria because their
relatives had died as ``martyrs'' fighting Iraq. Syria was Iran's
main ally during the eight-year conflict.
   ``The Iranians would bring a small silk rug or two to sell in
Syria. But after the cease-fire last year, there aren't nearly so
many Iranians visiting,'' said Nazir Nahawndi, a dealer in Damascus'
cavernous Hamadiye bazaar.
   Despite competition from lower-priced rugs made in India, China
and Turkey, traditional Persian rugs are still appreciated, Western
European dealers say.
   ``Comparatively speaking, Persian carpets are selling for the
equivalent of 1960s prices ... and they don't wear out, unlike the
new Far East rugs,'' Firouz Selmi, an Iranian merchant in Frankfurt,
said in a telephone interview.
   Antique rugs, some almost 100 years old, are an investment ``that
rates with anything else on the international art market,'' he added.
   A modern rug measuring 6 feet by 6 feet from a leading maker in
the southern Iranian city of Isfahan, a renowned carpet center, can
sell for upwards of $15,000 at a London auction house.
   In Damascus, rug merchants mostly buy from private homes as
Syrian families sell off the family heirlooms and switch to fitted
carpets. Prices are considerably lower.
   A good-quality Shiraz rug measuring 10 feet by 6 feet costs less
than $1,500. A top-quality throw rug in varied colors from Kashan or
in deep red with bold dark designs from Bokhara costs about $2,000.
   ``Prices are still reasonable because we get enough stock from
the old houses. But it's a limited supply and it can't last that
much longer,'' said David Hamedan, whose family runs an antique
store in the heart of the maze-like Damascus bazaar.

<HEAD>Prison Stormed After Captives Raped, Murder: Officer</HEAD>

   Soldiers stormed a prison and killed
convicts holding a religious group hostage after learning they had
murdered male captives and raped the women, the officer in charge of
the jail said today.
   All 16 convicts and five of the 15 hostages died before troops
recaptured the jail Tuesday in Davao City, 610 miles south of Manila.
   The dead included a 9-year-old boy and Australian missionary
Jacqueline Hamill, 36, of Sydney. One of the captives who was freed
said Miss Hamill was raped at knifepoint the night before she was
killed.
   Officials said most of the hostages were slain by their captors
before the assault and that none of the captives died in the
military attack.
   But in Canberra, Australia's foreign minister said Miss Hamill
may have been killed by soldiers when the convicts tried to break
out of the jail hours before troops stormed it.
   President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said there was no evidence
the military bungled the hostage crisis but announced an
investigation into the bloody incident.
   Lt. Col. Franco Calida, Davao City's police commander and jail
superintendent, said civilian officials tried to negotiate with the
inmates after they seized the hostages Sunday during religious
services at the prison.
   A few hours before the attack, the convicts had tried to escape
by using hostages as shields. During an exchange of gunfire, one
captive and one inmate were killed but five hostages escaped. They
told police of the rapes and killings, Calida told Manila radio
station DZXL.
   ``When we learned that the women were raped and that male
hostages were being killed, the task was given to us,'' Calida said.
``So the negotiating team was left with no other choice, because the
hostages were being killed one by one. That is what the hostages
were telling the negotiating team.''
   The attack began at about 3 p.m. Troops rushed forward firing
automatic weapons and secured the downtown jail after about 40
minutes, witnesses and officials said.
   Miss Hamill's body was found dumped outside the detention center
with a bullet wound in the chest. She had only been in Davao City
for a month.
   The Rev. Fred Castillo, one of the freed hostages, said Miss
Hamill and some of the nine other women hostages were raped. Other
freed hostages said they heard the women screaming on Monday night.
   ``Jackie told me about the incident,'' Castillo said Tuesday.
   In Canberra, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said it appeared Miss
Hamill may have been shot by a soldier during the escape attempt.
   ``In the doctor's opinion, death was instantaneous and had
occurred some hours previously, which would indicate she had been
shot during the attempted escape incident in the morning.'' Evans
said in a report to the Australian Senate. ``Ms. Hamill was seen to
slump as the group retreated back through a gateway to the inner
compound.''
   Evans said he had asked Philippine officials to investigate her
death.
   In Hobart, Australia, Miss Hamill's father, Ray Hamill,
criticized both Australian and Philippine authorities for their
handling of the crisis.
   ``Why the hell did they have to storm the prison?'' he told the
newspaper Hobart Mercury. ``She gave her life to helping other
people and now she has paid for it with her life.''
   Presidential spokesman Adolfo Azcuna told reporters, ``There
appears to be no indication of mishandling the situation although we
are examining exactly whether what they reported actually is what
really happened, whether or not the casualties could have been
avoided and what can be done to avoid similar situations in the
future.''
   All the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, a
Protestant group. Calida said the group had been holding prison
services for two years as part of a program ``to rehabilitate the
prisoners'' to ``help them morally.''

<HEAD>Security Council Calls for Cease-Fire, Arab League Mediation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Lebanon, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Security Council condemned the bitter
fighting in Lebanon and called for an immediate truce and renewed
mediation efforts by the Arab League.
   The council's 15 member nations unanimously passed the statement
Tuesday night after Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
invoked a rarely used power to convene a session when the council
failed to act on its own.
   The Arab League ministers who have tried to mediate a peace
settlement in Lebanon also called for an immediate truce and
denounced the intensified fighting.
   France, to get the council to act as soon as possible, pushed for
the Security Council to adopt a statement rather than a stronger,
binding resolution, said diplomats who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   But minutes before midnight the Security Council passed a
statement, read by Algerian Ambassador Hocine Djoudi, this month's
council president.
   It said the council ``profoundly deplores the intensification of
the shelling and bitter fighting in recent days.''
   ``It expresses its great disquiet at the loss of human lives and
the untold suffering it causes to the Lebanese people,'' the
statement said.
   The council ``urgently appeals to all the parties to put an
immediate end to all operations and to all firing and all shelling
on land and at sea. It further appeals to all parties to observe a
total and immediate cease-fire.'' When no council member was willing
to call for a meeting on Lebanon, Perez de Cuellar invoked Article
99 of the U.N. Charter for the first time since he became
secretary-general in 1982.
   The article allows the secretary-general to call emergency
meetings on any threat to ``international peace and security.''
   The secretary-general only had to resort to this twice before in
the 44-year history of the world body, said U.N. officials.
   In 1960, Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold invoked Article 99 to
call a meeting on the Congo Crisis; in 1979, Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim used it to convene a meeting after Iran took American
hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
   Some diplomats said the fact that Perez de Cuellar had to invoke
Article 99 showed the Security Council had little hope for the
situation in Lebanon, where Christian troops are battling Syrian
forces and their Lebanese Moslem allies.
   The council's statement said it supports an Arab League committee
that has tried to arrange a cease-fire and political settlement that
would end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The members of the league's Tripartite Committee are King Hassan
II of Morocco, King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz al Saud of Saudi Arabia; and
President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria.
   Late Tuesday night they they issued a statement that said they
were ``saddened and profoundly moved by the recent evolution in
Lebanon, marked by a significant deterioration in security, without
precedent,'' the Moroccan news agency MAP reported in a dispatch
from Rabat.
   The leaders did not single out any party for blame. In a
statement Aug. 1, however, the foreign ministers of their nations
specifically condemned Syrian's actions and said their peace efforts
had come to ``a dead end in both the political and security fields.''
   That was the second Arab mediation effort to collapse this year,
and the diplomats said Arab members of the Security Council were not
eager to join in a declaration would make them responsible for a
solution to Lebanon's problems.
   The council may try to pass a resolution later in the week if the
warring parties do not respond to the statement and to other
diplomatic initiatives, the diplomats said.
   The permanent members of the Security Council are the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China. The current
temporary members are Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia,
Finland, Malaysia, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.

<HEAD>Former Treasury Chief Dies at 79</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert B. Anderson, a former Treasury secretary
under President Eisenhower whose career was tarnished in recent
years when he was convicted of income tax evasion and disbarred, has
died at age 79.
   Anderson died Monday at New York Hospital, which he entered July
25 suffering from cancer of the esophagus, his son, Gerald L.
Anderson, said Tuesday. He died from surgery complications.
   As Treasury secretary from 1957 to 1961, Anderson was known as a
conservative who put a higher priority on preserving the dollar's
value than cutting taxes or paying for additional outlays.
   It was on his recommendation that Eisenhower decided that the
projected surplus for fiscal 1961 be used to pay off some of the
national debt rather than cutting taxes.
   After leaving government, Anderson was a limited partner in the
New York-based investment banking firm of Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Co. from
1961 until 1973.
   He also served as a director for several companies, including Pan
American World Airways and Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, and served as an
economic adviser to the Sultan of Oman and as a lobbyist and
consultant for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.
   Anderson pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to
evading taxes on more than $127,000 in income in 1983 and 1984, and
to operating an illegal offshore bank in which investors lost more
than $4 million. In 1987, he was sentenced to a month in prison and
five months' house arrest.
   He served his prison term in August 1987 and completed his house
arrest in January 1988, authorities said.
   Judge Edmund L. Palmieri also sentenced him to five years'
probation and directed him to make restitution to victims of the
bank operation who lost money on his advice.
   The judge said he was aware Anderson had been hospitalized for
alcoholism 10 times since 1981 and ordered him to enter a treatment
program.
   In January, the Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court
disbarred Anderson, saying the illegal banking had been
unconscionable.
   Originally a Democrat, Anderson supported Eisenhower in his first
presidential campaign in 1952 and switched to the GOP in 1956.
   He served as secretary of the Navy in 1953-54, during which time
he carried out Eisenhower's request to desegregate Navy posts in
Charleston, S.C., and Norfolk, Va. He also was deputy secretary of
defense in 1954-55. In those positions, he was known as a quiet and
efficient administrator.
   Besides his son Gerald, Anderson is survived by another son,
three grandchildren and two sisters. His wife, the former Ollie Mae
Rawlings, died in 1987.

   From the same Harlem playground, at about the
same time of day, on the same day of the week, two toddlers who
lived in the same apartment building vanished.
   Investigators now are distributing posters around the country of
2-year-old Christopher Dansby and 19-month-old Shane Walker.
   Shane disappeared 5 p.m. Thursday, while Christopher was last
seen 7 p.m. on Thursday, May 18.
   The two never played together, but authorities say the
disappearances may be linked because of the eerie similarities.
   Just before they vanished, the toddlers were even playing with
the same children.
   The two playmates, a 10-year-old girl and her 5-year-old brother,
cannot recall seeing anyone take the boys from the busy playground,
police said. Authorities have questioned them extensively.
   ``No one that we have found yet has seen anybody with the child,
taking the child by the hand, carrying it, leading it, taking it
through a fence, or leaving the playground,'' said Deputy Chief
Ronald Fenrich, head of Manhattan detectives.
   He said two black men ``similar only in their dreadlock hair
styles'' are being sought for questioning. He declined to elaborate.
   Christopher and Shane, who both lived in the Martin Luther King
Jr. Towers housing project, vanished from the development's large
playground.
   Rosalee Glover, Shane's mother, said she and Shane went to the
playground about 5 p.m. She sat on a bench as Shane played with the
two children, she said.
   The kidnapping ``happened so fast,'' she said. ``I turned my head
away when this guy asked me a question.'' When she looked back,
Shane was gone.
   Elizabeth Manley, Christopher's grandmother, believes the two
cases are connected. ``In both cases, the kids were taken right
under our very noses,'' she said.
   Manley said she, too, turned her head away for a minute at the
playground, ``and my grandchild was gone.''
   The national search includes rewards for the return of the
children totaling about $30,000.
   Police have searched the area's sewers, roofs, basements, and air
shafts of occupied and abandoned buildings, but have found no signs
of the boys.
   The disappearances also have led investigators back to their
files: They've reopened the cases of two other infants kidnapped in
the area in the last two years. One theory they have is that
Christopher and Shane were taken as part of a conspiracy to steal or
sell babies.
   But the heads of two private adoption agencies in the city, which
place large numbers of black children with adoptive parents,
discounted that thought.
   ``It's hard to imagine,'' said Elaine Rosenfeld, executive
director of the Louise Wise Services. ``There is a black market for
white babies, but for black babies, I don't think so.''
   Catherine Unsino, director of the adoption department at
Spence-Chapin, said: ``I have not heard of kidnapping any children
of that age to satisfy the wishes of adoptive couples ... I can't
picture the end result (of a kidnapping) being adoption.''
   She added: ``People have used babies as fronts for illegal
activities ... children are being sold for drugs.''
   Detectives were looking at other theories as well, including
abduction by a pedophile, an adult who has abnormal sexual desire
for children, or simply by a person who wished a child harm.
   Investigators had ruled out ransom as a motive, saying no one had
contacted the families for money.
   ``We're going over everything with a fine-tooth comb because we
really have nothing to go on, and just have to dig, dig, dig,''
Fenrich said.

   Military forensic experts today
began identifying the remains of U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland and 15
others who were killed when their plane crashed into a cliff in
southwestern Ethiopia.
   The bodies arrived in Ethiopia's capital Tuesday evening.
Helicopters were used to remove them from the wreckage of their
light plane, a Twin Otter, on the steep slopes of mile-high Tam
mountain.
   Seven Ethiopians and nine Americans _ including Leland, a Texas
Democrat who chaired the House Select Committee on Hunger _ died in
the crash Aug. 7 en route to a refugee camp near the Sudan border.
The plane crashed about 100 miles short of its destination.
   ``Ethiopian and U.S. authorities declare that all bodies have
been recovered,'' Marine Lt. Col. David Titus said later in a
statement read to reporters.
   Additional medical personnel were to arrive in Addis Ababa today
to help the forensic experts already on hand identify the bodies
before the Americans are returned to the United States for burial.
   Titus said the task of identifying the dead probably would take
five to seven days. The work was being done at a clinic at Addis
Ababa's international airport.
   Members of an investigating team from the United States and
Canada flew to the crash site this morning to examine the wreckage
for the cause of the accident.
   They included members of the U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board and representatives of the Boeing and Pratt and Whitney
companies, which made the airframe and engines of the Canadian-built
Twin Otter.
   The Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority is coordinating the
investigation.
   Leland, 44, and his party were heading to the Fugnido refugee
camp about 480 miles southwest of this capital when the accident
occurred.
   Heavy clouds, rain and low visibility were believed to have led
to the crash.
   After a six-day search, rescuers Sunday found the wreckage and
bodies strewn over about a quarter-mile wide region of the
5,500-foot mountain.
   The Fugnido camp is one of four in southwestern Ethiopia run by
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. They house more than
300,000 Sudanese who have fled war and famine in their neighboring
country.
   Leland, a six-term representative from Houston, was mourned as a
champion of the homeless and hungry throughout the world.
   Funeral plans for Leland include a memorial service to be held at
7:30 p.m. Friday at the Texas Southern University campus in Houston.
Mass will be said at 10 a.m. Saturday at St. Anne's Catholic Church
in Houston.
   Private burial will take place at a later date.

   Pro-IRA activist Martin Galvin was deported to the
United States today after violating an order barring him from
British territory, the government said.
   Galvin, publicity director for the New York-based Irish Northern
Aid Committee, or NORAID, was flown out of Britain on a Royal Air
Force flight heading to Washington, the Home Office said.
   The 39-year-old New York lawyer was arrested Tuesday in
Londonderry, Northern Ireland, after taking a walk through the city
on the 20th anniversary of the deployment of British troops in the
troubled province.
   ``He was flown out on a regular RAF flight to the United
States,'' said a spokesman for the Home Office, speaking anonymously
in keeping with British custom.
   ``It was a point that we wanted him out of the country as soon as
possible and the RAF had a plane available at about 5 a.m.''
   Galvin has been banned from entering British territory since July
1984 when he gave a speech endorsing violence one day after a
soldier was killed in Londonderry.
   A month later police tried to arrest him during a public
appearance in west Belfast. Galvin fled, but a young man was killed
by a plastic bullet fired by police trying to break up fighting in
the crowd of Irish Republican Army supporters.
   Galvin has visited Northern Ireland illegally on at least three
other occasions.
   He said Tuesday he had been in the province for three days before
police in bullet-resistant vests arrested him. He was flown Tuesday
night to Royal Air Force base Brize Norton, about 50 miles northwest
of London.
   During his walk, Galvin was accompanied by Martin McGuinness,
vice president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, and by
several local IRA leaders. They openly walked past a security
checkpoint on their way to the mainly Roman Catholic Bogside area of
Londonderry.
   Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said Galvin was not permitted to
speak to lawyers before being deported, but would be challenging the
exclusion order on his return to the United States.
   Britain says NORAID collects money to buy arms for the outlawed
IRA. Galvin denies this, saying the money goes to families of
victims of violence in the province.
   The IRA is fighting to unite the province and its Protestant
majority with the predominantly Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

   An East German failed in an attempt to escape to
West Berlin when the truck he was driving flipped over after
striking a border barrier, police said today.
   West Berlin police said Communist East German border guards
quickly surrounded the man and dragged him from the vehicle shortly
before midnight Tuesday at the Stolpe crossing point between East
Germany and West Berlin.
   Police said the truck appeared to be a military vehicle. They
said that East German guards covered the truck with camouflage
material at once to prevent onlookers from viewing it. The crossing
was closed for a half-hour after the escape attempt was thwarted.

   Michigan Bell officials weren't amused when
a radio station offered prizes to listeners who used operator
assistance to call the station during the telephone company's strike.
   Six people used directory assistance to call WJXQ-FM, and they
won free admission to a music festival. Several others told the
station they'd tried, but failed, said disc jockey Paul Sutherland.
   ``I fail to see the merit in this type of program,'' said Bob
Lacinski, Michigan Bell public relations director for Lansing.
``This is not the time to do those types of things, just to see how
Michigan Bell can react.''
   Sutherland said he and his partner, Dave Marcum, decided not to
do it again Tuesday after a Bell official called them.
   ``We weren't really trying to screw anybody up. We were just
trying to have some fun and _ even more so _ just see how tied up
things were,'' Sutherland said.
   Nearly 200,000 operators, clerks, technicians and other workers
are on strike against four so-called Baby Bell companies in 20
states and the District of Columbia.

<HEAD>State Sues Exxon, Other Oil Companies Over Alaska Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a lawsuit, Alaska accused Exxon Corp.
and six other oil companies of deliberate and gross negligence in
not preventing and properly cleaning up the nation's worst oil spill.
   The lawsuit does not specify damages, but could amount to
billions of dollars, a state official said Tuesday.
   The state alleges that Exxon Corp. and Exxon Shipping Co., the
subsidiary that owned the tanker Exxon Valdez, are responsible for
the tanker running aground by failing to staff it adequately and
supervise the crew properly.
   The lawsuit, filed in state Superior Court at Anchorage, also
says Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of oil companies
that runs the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, failed to take prompt and
adequate measures to contain and remove the spilled oil or prevent
it from spreading into environmentally sensitive areas.
   Alyeska was in charge of the initial response to the spill.
   The March 24 tanker disaster left nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil in Prince William Sound.
   ``If you assume that the damages haven't been half mitigated and
then you add in any potential punitive damages, this is probably in
the multiple billions,'' said Robert LeResche, the state oil-spill
coordinator who announced the lawsuit at a news conference.
   The lawsuit names Alyeska and each of the consortium companies:
Exxon Pipeline Co., an Exxon Corp. subsidiary; Arco Pipeline Co.; BP
Alaska Pipelines Inc.; Mobil Alaska Pipeline Co.; Amerada Hess
Pipeline Corp.; Phillips Alaska Pipeline Corp.; and Unocal Pipeline
Co.
   Those companies controlled Alyeska's budget to a degree that
makes them responsible for Alyeska's response to the spill, the
lawsuit says.
   ``We feel that Alyeska as a corporation was merely a sham, a
corporate shell if you will, behind which these partners have been
hiding for the last 12 or 15 years,'' LeResche said.
   The lawsuit also charges that the oil companies misrepresented
their ability to contain and clean up oil spills, violated federal
marine pilotage laws and inflicted ``severe emotional distress on
Alaska residents.''
   In a statement issued at its New York headquarters, Exxon said it
had not seen the complaint ``but it appears to completely disregard
the fact that Exxon's response to the accident has been massive and
responsible.''
   ``Our goal continues to be to leave the water and shorelines in
an environmentally stable condition such that animals, birds and
fish are not harmed and no restrictions on commerical use or
subsistence hunting and fishing are necessary,'' Exxon said.
   The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for destruction of the
environment and harm to the region's fisheries-based economy.
   ``The state recognizes that more than 1,000 square miles of its
lands, waters and resources in or near Prince William Sound, the
Kenai Peninsula and Kodiak Island suffered severe environmental
damage, including the devastation of beaches and coastal waters, the
death or injury of thousands of animals, the curtailment of
important commercial fisheries, and the impairment of recreational
opportunities,'' a state news release said.
   The lawsuit seeks punitive damages, its cleanup costs, its costs
of studying and monitoring the spill, and a negligence fine under
state law of up to $100 million. The state also asks for an
injunction to ensure Exxon and Alyeska continue the cleanup until
the environment is restored.
   LeResche said he expected the lawsuit would take a decade to
resolve.

<HEAD>Genda, Pearl Harbor Planner, Dies on Anniversary of Japan Surrender</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minoru Genda, one of the chief planners of Japan's
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, has died of heart failure in a
hospital, his family said.
   Genda, who died Tuesday on the anniversary of Japan's surrender
in World War II, would have been 85 today.
   A graduate of Japan's naval academy, he was a young aviation
staff officer who was called in early to plan for the daring attack
that severely damaged the U.S. Pacific fleet in Hawaii and brought
the United States into the war.
   He directed much of the secret training in Japanese waters before
the attack and, on Dec. 7, 1941, Genda was aboard one of the
Japanese carriers that launched the raid.
   In June 1942, however, he was involved with the unsuccessful
Japanese attack on Midway Island. Some analysts partially faulted
him for failing to order enough search planes to find the U.S. fleet
in the assault. The U.S. defense of Midway ended with many Japanese
warships sunk or damaged in one of the great sea battles of modern
times.
   After the war, Genda joined Japan's revived air force in 1954 and
became its chief of staff in 1959. After retiring from the military,
he was elected in 1962 to the upper house of Parliament for the
governing Liberal Democratic Party, and was re-elected three times
before he retired in 1986.
   Regarded as a hawk among the ruling party's defense experts,
Genda said in 1968 that if Japan had possessed an atom bomb it
should have used one during the war.
   Genda was a native of Hiroshima, the western city that was
leveled in the first atomic attack on Aug. 6, 1945.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms whipped parts of New York and Pennsylvania with
strong winds, heavy rains and hail. Storms also were scattered
across the Southwest and Plains states and spawned a tornado in
Texas.
   In northwest Pennsylvania, storm winds Tuesday evening downed
trees and knocked out power around Girard and McKean and pelted Lake
City with hail the size of golf balls.
   Strong thunderstorms also were scattered from parts of Nevada,
Utah, Arizona and New Mexico to the central and southern Plains. In
the Texas Panhandle, a tornado was spotted near Middle Water but
apparently did not touch down, and baseball-size hail fell at
Dalhart.
   Strong winds and lightning caused power outages across portions
of Phoenix, and nearly 1} inches of rain fell north of Tucson
Tuesday afternoon. Also in Arizona, more than an inch of rain fell
in one hour at Globe.
   A cold front pushing its way across the northern Rockies produced
thunderstorms across western Montana. Showers and thunderstorms also
were scattered across Missouri, Kansas, the Carolinas and southern
New England.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
Oklahoma and northern Texas across the central and eastern Gulf
Coast, the Tennessee Valley and the Appalachians to the Atlantic
Coast. Showers and thunderstorms also were expected to be scattered
across the northern Rockies and parts of Arizona and New Mexico.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 70s from northern New England
across the Great Lakes to the upper Mississippi Valley, and from
central Montana to Washington and northern Oregon, as well as along
the California coast; the 90s from the southern Atlantic Coast
across the lower Mississippi Valley, much of Texas and the southern
Rockies to parts of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Nevada; between
100 and 110 degrees over the desert Southwest and interior valleys
of central and Southern California; and the 80s in the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 45 degrees at Hibbing,
Minn., to 91 degrees at Thermal, Calif.

<HEAD>Estonian President Meets with Kremlin Leaders on Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associate Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kremlin leaders met today with the president of
Estonia to consider ways to end a weeklong strike by Russians
complaining of discrimination in the Baltic republic, Soviet media
said.
   The strike by tens of thousands of ethnic Russians and other
non-Estonians is in response to a new law that limits the right to
vote and hold office to long-term residents of the small republic.
The workers are also upset about a new law requiring many of them to
learn to speak Estonian.
   The People's Front of Estonia, a pro-democracy group that also
has been a moving force behind pro-Estonian changes in the republic,
called for a national law guaranteeing the rights of minorities, the
labor newspaper Trud reported today.
   ``We will be living together for a long time and if the tension
keeps increasing, our lives and that of our children will be
intolerable,'' the group's statement said.
   While Estonian President Arnold Ruutel met in the Kremlin with
the ruling council of the Soviet government, a group of
parliamentarians toured Estonian factories and spoke with workers,
strike committee member Mikhail Lysenko said.
   The legislators met Tuesday night with the strike committee,
Lysenko said in a telephone interview.
   Maarika Saarna, an editor with Estonian state radio, said from
Tallinn Tuesday night that 26,000 workers at about 40 enterprises
were believed to be on strike. Lysenko said tens of thousands of
workers at 50 enterprises were involved.
   The walkout has paralyzed rail cargo around Tallinn, Estonia's
capital. Izvestia said more than 3,000 rail cars were idle while
Pravda said 2,000.
   To assure that necessary supplies get to the city of 480,000,
goods are being shipped to other cities in the republic, Pravda
quoted the republic's deputy premier, P. Palu, as saying. ``That
way, we'll supply Tallinn with everything needed,'' Palu said.
   Estonia's new election law limits voting to adults who have lived
in the same district for two years, or anywhere in the republic for
five years. Candidates for elected office must live in the same
place for five years, or in Estonia for 10 years.
   State-run Radio Moscow said the law will take the right to vote
away from more than 100,000 recent non-Estonian arrivals. That was
the aim of backers of the law, who fear an influx of outsiders is
making ethnic Estonians a minority in their homeland.
   However, Estonian journalists said the number of people affected
was 10,000 to 20,000, since most of the republic's non-Estonians
have lived in the republic more than two years.

<HEAD>Nephew of Briton Jailed in Iran Offers to Take his Place</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 17-year-old nephew of jailed businessman Roger
Cooper offered today to take his place if Iran would allow Cooper to
return to Britain for his mother's funeral.
   Cooper, 53, has been held in Tehran as an alleged spy for nearly
four years, and his family and the British government have appealed
to Iran to let him attend the funeral on Saturday.
   Simon Cooper, son of Roger Cooper's brother Paul Cooper, offered
to go to Iran as collateral for his uncle.
   ``I am a little scared, obviously, because I have never been to
Iran, but my father has been there three times,'' he said on British
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   ``He has had no problems with the Iranians. They have treated him
well. I cannot see any reason why they would not treat me properly.''
   Paul Cooper said his son's offer was contained in an appeal he
sent to Iran.
   ``If they wanted a surety that Roger would return to jail, since
officially he is still a spy or is being held for who knows what, I
have said my son, Simon, would be happy to go as surety,'' Paul
Cooper said on the BBC.
   ``That was Simon's own proposal when we discussed the matter a
couple of days ago.''
   He said the move was a personal initiative rather than one
approved by the Foreign Office.
   ``It is very important to us that Roger is at his mother's
funeral,'' Paul Cooper said. ``She is the woman who brought him into
this world. She has been a wonderful mother.''
   Their mother, Dr. Rosaleen Cooper, died Aug. 3.
   Roger Cooper, who had lived in Iran for more than 20 years, was
detained in November 1985 and formally charged with espionage one
year later. Iranian officials have claimed that he also has been
tried and sentenced but the sentence has not been disclosed.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian delegation will visit Moscow to
discuss the possible purchase of commercial airliners from the
Soviet Union, according to news reports today.
   Quoting a report in the Tehran Times, the Islamic Republic News
Agency said the delegation will leave for Moscow on Thursday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted an unidentified source
as telling the newspaper that ``avenues for closer cooperation
between Iran and the Soviet Union in the aviation field will be
explored,'' and that Iran might buy some passenger planes.
   IRNA had earlier quoted aviation sources as saying Iran has been
in the market for new jetliners, and that the European Airbus was
among the aircraft being considered.
   Iran Air, the national airline, has a fleet of 23 aging Boeing
and Airbus jetliners. Another domestic airline, Aseman, has three
Dutch-built Fokker aircraft and a few Cessnas.
   The Soviet Union and Iran have become close trade partners in
recent months.
   Following the August 1988 cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq
war, the Soviets have been helping Iran rebuild many war-battered
industrial complexes and refurbish other facilities.

<HEAD>U.S. Naval Vessel Rescues Vietnamese Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese boat people were rescued by the U.S.
Navy vessel whose former captain was punished for not picking up
refugees who later resorted to cannibalizing dead shipmates,
officials said today.
   A U.S. Embassy official said the Dubuque, an amphibious transport
ship, brought 30 Vietnamese into Singapore on Monday after rescuing
them from a wooden boat in the South China Sea early Sunday.
   The Dubuque, now commanded by Capt. D.L. Wetherwell, was
permitted to put the refugees ashore on the embassy's guarantee that
the Vietnamese would be resettled in another country within 90 days,
said the U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Wetherwell would not be interviewed about the rescue, said the
U.S. official, who was not certain whether the present crew members
were aboard in June 1988 when the Dubuque gave food and water to
Vietnamese refugees but left them to continue sailing on their own.
   The skipper at that time, Capt. Alexander Balian, was tried by
court-martial in the Philippines and found guilty Feb. 24 of
dereliction of duty for failing to recognize their distress or act
to see that they survived.
   The case highlighted the mariner's code that requires giving help
to a vessel in distress and the dangers faced by Vietnamese boat
people, who risk death in storms, by starvation and at the hands of
pirates.
   In the 1988 incident, the refugees had been drifting without
engine power for several weeks.
   Eighteen days after the Dubuque sailed away, Filipino fishermen
found the disabled boat, and survivors said 31 people had died. The
survivors later admitted they had cannibalized the dead.
   Balian was relieved of his command before his court-martial. His
conviction resulted in a reprimand and he was transferred to
Washington.
   On Sunday, the Dubuque's crew spotted a wooden, 35-foot refugee
boat about 460 miles north-northeast of Singapore, the U.S. Embassy
official said.
   The boat, carrying 23 adults and seven children, was out of food
and fresh water and low on fuel, he said, and some of the refugees
were suffering from dehydration. The vessel was determined not to be
seaworthy, and the refugees were taken aboard the Dubuque, the
official said.
   The Navy ship then brought them to Singapore, where it was making
a routine port call.

   A 2-year-old boy allegedly abducted by his father
when he was 17 days old has been reunited with his mother after a
passerby spotted him hiding in the back seat of a parked car,
officials said.
   The child's father, who was arrested along with two other men,
took the boy after his wife fled a religious cult to which they
belonged, authorities said.
   The boy's mother, 25-year-old Mary Lou Weinzetl, wept as she
described her ordeal Tuesday at a news conference.
   ``I thought I'd never see him again,'' she said as the boy,
Brendan Broderick, munched fistfuls of candy from a paper cup. She
said she lives in the Chicago area, but would not disclose her
hometown.
   The child's father, Brian Broderick, 27, allegedly ran off with
Brendan in August 1987 after Weinzetl fled the group, which FBI
investigators call a cult. Aurthorities said the group is known as
the Holiness Tabernacle Church or Holy Alamo Christian Church in
Alma, Ark.
   Weinzetl's daughter from an earlier marriage, Jackie, now 3, was
returned to her by Broderick five months after she left the group.
But she says he refused to let her see Brendan and eventually went
into hiding with him.
   After two years of searching, Weinzetl got a call at her Illinois
home telling her Brendan had been found.
   On Aug. 3, a woman told police of two men who appeared to be
living in a car with a small child in Manhattan. When the men, and a
third who claimed to be the boy's father, did not produce
identification for themselves or for the child, they were arrested
for allegedly endangering the welfare of a child, prosecutors said.
   Broderick had been sought on a felony charge of custodial
interference in Arkansas. He has waived extradition.
   The three men were arraigned Aug. 5, and the baby was turned over
to officials. He was found to be in good physical condition.

<HEAD>Housing Starts Continue to Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction continued to rebound from
the depressing effects of high mortgage rates with a 0.8 percent
increase in new starts last month, the government reported today.
   This could mean more jobs in the construction and building
materials industries, and additional employment and sales in such
housing-related businesses as home furnishings and appliances.
   The Commerce Department reported that new homes and apartments
were built in July at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43
million units, up from 1.42 million units in June when the rebound
began.
   The housing industry had been among the sectors hardest hit
earlier this year as the Federal Reserve drove interest rates up to
restrain economic growth and contain inflation.
   Construction starts had fallen for four consecutive months
through May, the longest string of declines since activity slowed
for five months in a row from February through June 1987. The May
level of 1.31 million units was the slowest pace since the 1.3
million rate in December 1982.
   But the central bank began nudging rates down in June and, in
anticipation of that move, fixed-rate mortgages began falling from
their peak of 11.22 percent in March. The Federal National Mortgage
Association said fixed rates had dropped to 9.96 percent by last
Friday.
   The July construction pace followed a hefty 8.5 percent hike in
June, the highest since a 8.6 percent jump to 1.51 million units in
February 1988.
   But June's increase reflected a 32.9 percent rise in the volatile
apartment construction, the highest since a 43 percent increase in
April 1988. Apartment construction last month fell 1.2 percent to an
annual rate of 389,000 units. It had increased 5.4 percent in May
after falling 26.6 percent in April.
   Construction of single-family homes in July rose 6.3 percent to
an annual rate of 1.04 million units. Single-family starts had risen
0.2 percent in June after falling 5.1 percent in May and 4.7 percent
in April.
   Analysts had expected single-family construction to remain weak
as the economy continued to slow, causing a buildup in unsold new
homes.
   By region, overall housing construction jumped by 16 percent last
month in the Northeast, where starts rose to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 196,000 units.
   Starts were up 11 percent to 272,000 units in the Midwest but
fell 4.3 percent to 530,000 units in the South and 4.2 percent to
432,000 units in the West.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future
multifamily housing activity, were down 3.1 percent in July,
following a drop of 2.9 percent in June. They had risen 1 percent in
May and 8.5 percent in April after three consecutive monthly
declines.

   A former Boeing Co. executive is facing
charges he stole and reproduced classified Pentagon and National
Security Council documents.
   Richard Lee Fowler, 64, was indicted Tuesday on charges that he
stole secret Pentagon planning documents while he was selling Boeing
products to the military from 1979 to 1985.
   Reached at his Springfield, Va., home Tuesday night, Fowler
declined to comment.
   The classified documents described the Pentagon's Planning,
Programming and Budgeting System, which is used to plan future
weapons purchases.
   ``Possession of these documents would provide a competitive edge
to anyone in the business of supplying the (Defense Department) with
tactical and strategic weaponry,'' Pentagon Inspector General June
Gibbs Brown said in a statement.
   Fowler, who had been a senior marketing analyst with Boeing, was
charged with 39 felony counts, including a charge he removed the
``secret'' classification stamp from some documents and reproduced
them for other Boeing executives.

   However, the department declined comment Tuesday on the

   De Klerk, who is expected to be elected president in September,
was to be the first South African leader to visit the United States

<NOTE>Drug Czar Says Nostalgia for Woodstock Mistaken</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug czar William J. Bennett says part of the
legacy of Woodstock was tolerance of drugs and that Americans should
be glad that times have changed.
   Bennett emerged Tuesday from a White House meeting on anti-drug
strategy with President Bush to complain about ``memory distortion''
going on about the rock concert in upstate New York that captivated
a generation 20 years ago.
   The 45-year-old Bennett, a onetime guitar player and fan of early
rock 'n' roll, recited what he called ``the casualty list from
Woodstock'': rock performers who died in later years from drug
overdoses.
   They included Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon of the Who
and Paul Butterfield of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band.
   ``Part of the legacy of Woodstock was tolerance of drugs and let
us be glad that is over rather than wishing it were back,'' Bennett
said. ``We do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs.
We've come too far.''

<TEXT>
   An anti-apartheid youth leader freed
last week from detention was shot and killed outside his home today,
his family said.
   Eric Gumede, 27, was released from custody Friday after a
prolonged hunger strike. Relatives said he lost more than 65 pounds
during his protest against being held without charge
   Gumede was a leader of the KwaMashu Youth League, an affiliate of
the banned United Democratic Front coalition based in one of the
largest black townships adjoining the port city of Durban.
   His brother, Popo, said a car drove up to their home in KwaMashu
shortly after midnight and someone inside began honking the horn.
Eric went outside to see what was happening, and was shot in the
chest by two blasts from a shotgun, Popo said.
   No arrests were reported, and Popo said no one at the home saw
who was inside the car.
   In April, another former hunger striker, Chris Ntuli, was stabbed
to death at his home near Durban two weeks after being released from
detention.
   Unlike Gumede, Ntuli was under a restriction order confining him
to his house at night.
   In Pretoria, a petition was presented today at police
headquarters protesting the restrictions placed on many recently
released detainees.
   The Pretoria Council of Churches said the petition was prepared
by relatives of the former detainees and called on Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok to lift the restrictions.
   In many cases, the activists are placed under nighttime house
arrest, barred from certain political activities and required to
report daily to local police stations.
   Organizers said the petition was forwarded to Vlok after acting
President F.W. de Klerk turned down a request to meet with relatives
of the former detainees.
   At least three activists have been arrested this week after
publicly announcing that they would defy their restrictions.

<HEAD>U.S. Lawmaker: Our Bases Will Find Home Elsewhere If Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Stephen Solarz said today he
hopes the United States can reach an agreement to keep its military
bases in this country, but he said Washington will find other host
nations if necessary.
   The lease on the six military installations, including the Clark
Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, expires in 1991. Many Filipinos,
including lawmakers, have said it should not be renewed.
   Solarz, D-New York, was scheduled to meet later today with
President Corazon Aquino. She has not stated her position on the
issue.
   ``If they come to the conclusion that it is to the best interest
of the Philippines to permit us to continue using the facilities,
then we will gladly and willingly continue to utilize them,'' Solarz
said.
   He added, however, that the American government would develop
``operative facilities elsewhere'' in case the Philippines decides
to close the bases.
   Solarz, who is chairman of the Asian and Pacific affairs
subcommittee in the House, arrived in this country today with Rep.
Robert Dornan, R-Calif., and Eni Faleomavaega, a legislator from
American Samoa.
   In other comments to reporters, Solarz said Singapore's proposal
to host some American forces was a ``constructive offer'' _ but not
a substitute for the bases in the Philippines.
   Singapore extended its offer earlier this month.
   However, Defense Minister Tengku Ahmad Rithauddeen of neighboring
Malaysia said the proposal could jeopardize political stability in
Southeast Asia.
   Some Filipino opponents of the bases, wary of the heavy American
presence, have suggested the facilities could instead be used for
such things as commercial ship repair and industrial parks.
   The Philippines and United States are expected to begin talks
this year on whether to extend the current agreement. Mrs. Aquino is
expected to discuss the issue during a visit to the United States in
November.
   In October, the two countries reached an agreement allowing the
bases to remain until 1991 in return for $962 million in U.S.
military and economic aid over two years. About 40,000 American
troops, civilian workers and military dependents are stationed at
the facilities.

<HEAD>Armenia Quake Victims Complete Treatment in Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of people injured by the devastating
earthquake in Soviet Armenia were back home today after receiving
treatment by Israeli medical experts.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said 61 people injured in the
earthquake arrived aboard an Israeli airliner Tuesday in Yerevan,
the capital of the Armenian republic. Tass said some patients had
received artificial limbs during their seven weeks of care in
Israeli hospitals.
   At least 25,000 people were killed, 31,000 were injured and more
than 100,000 left homeless in the earthquake that decimated large
areas of Armenia on Dec. 7.
   Tass reported that Soviet television said the flight ``meant the
end of operation `Healing.'''
   ``The passengers of today's unusual flight spent seven weeks in
the best Israeli hospitals,'' the agency said. ``Very complicated
operations were made on them, and they received prosthetic
appliances produced according to the latest methods in medical
science and engineering.''
   The Soviet Union cut diplomatic ties with Israel to protest its
occupation of territories belonging to Moscow's Arab allies in the
1967 Middle East war. But relations between the countries have
improved in recent years under the government of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   Tass said operation ``Healing'' was undertaken by what it called
the ``amalgamated distribution committee,'' and said it represented
the largest Jewish charity organization in the United States.
   Tass said operation ``Healing, which cost some $500,000, ended.
But it continues its aid to Armenia.''
   The report said Aria Kuperstog, the project's chief organizer,
told Soviet television: ``We want to establish a children's
rehabilitation center in Leninakan. The project hopes that its
construction will begin soon. The design is ready.'' Leninakan is a
city in Soviet Armenia near the border with Turkey. It was
particularly hard hit during the earthquake.
   Tass also said the charity organization ``intends to shoulder
training of Soviet doctors who will work at the center.''

<TEXT>
   A couple living on the first floor
of a condominium are asking a judge to decide whether they may use
their patio door.
   Henrietta and Alfred Binns have made a habit of using the door as
a shortcut to the parking lot.
   But the condominium association complained July 13 that their
back-door ways are destroying the landscaping and are ``viewed as an
eyesore by other owners.'' It ordered the couple to use the
building's main entrance.
   So on Aug. 8, the Binns sued in Broward County court.
   ``I laugh about it, but it really isn't a laughing matter,'' said
the Binns' lawyer, Benjie Sperling. ``You don't give up all your
rights when you enter a condo. Entering and exiting a door is about
as basic as you can get.''
   Taking the shortcut is ``the natural thing to do,'' said Mrs.
Binns. She said the grass outside the door is thick, green and looks
fine.
   The condo association's lawyer, Michael Hyman, said Tuesday he
had not yet reviewed the lawsuit.
   ``I would doubt if there is any precedent on something like
this,'' Sperling said, ``because it's too ridiculous.''

<HEAD>Daily Says U.S. Must Condemn Israel and Release Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian newspaper said today the United
States can only improve ties with Iran by condemning Israel for
``acts of terrorism'' and releasing frozen Iranian assets.
   The same daily newspaper said Tuesday that the release of Iranian
assets would not guarantee Iranian help in freeing Western hostages
held by pro-Iranian groups.
   In an editorial today, the Kayhan International newspaper said
President Bush has shown ``substantial restraint'' on the hostage
issue but that is not enough to improve ties between the nations.
   The editorial, reported by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, echoed a statement Monday by an Iranian leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, that there is no chance for talks between U.S. and
Iranian leaders.
   The United States ``can demonstrate its wisdom, farsightedness
and pragmatic approach just by taking two simple actions: 1. Condemn
Israel for its acts of terrorism, and 2. Release Iranian assets,''
Kayhan said.
   Billions of dollars in Iranian assets, mostly undelivered
military equipment, were frozen in the United States after Iranian
extremists seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and took 52
Americans hostage. The hostages were held 444 days.
   There are 16 Westerners, including eight Americans, held hostage
in Lebanon, most by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions.
   Bush said Tuesday the Iranians have it in their power to get
American hostages released and rejoin the ``family of law abiding''
nations. But he has said there can be no link between unfreezing
Iranian assets and releasing the hostages.
   Kayhan said Tuesday that for Bush to ``pin hopes on Iran's
assistance'' to free the hostages ``without respecting Tehran's
conditions is wishful thinking.'' It said the release of Iranian
assets in the United States would ``be taken only as a goodwill
gesture,'' not as a trade-off for help in freeing the hostages.
   The plight of the U.S. hostages was pushed to the fore after
Israeli commandos July 28 kidnapped Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a
Shiite Moslem cleric from south Lebanon. Israel said it wanted to
trade him for the Western hostages and three Israeli soldiers held
in Lebanon.
   In response, a group called the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth claimed it had hanged an American hostage, Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins. Another pro-Iranian group threatened to kill
another American hostage but later suspended the threat.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In another development today, the 17-year-old nephew of jailed
British businessman Roger Cooper offered to take his place if Iran
would allow Cooper to return to Britain for his mother's funeral.
   Cooper, 53, has been held in Tehran on spy charges for nearly
four years, and his family and the British government have appealed
to Iran to let him attend the funeral on Saturday.
   Simon Cooper, son of Roger Cooper's brother Paul Cooper, offered
to go to Iran as collateral for his uncle.

   An interstate highway taken by tens of
thousands of New York City-bound commuters reopened this morning
more than a week after a fire in a pile of rubbish buckled the road.
   Four lanes of 10-lane Interstate 78 were opened to traffic before
rush hour.
   Three elevated sections of the road were seriously damaged Aug. 7
when debris piled beneath the highway caught fire, warping support
beams. Engineers salvaged a fourth elevated section with $385,000 in
emergency repairs.
   The owners of a recycling company responsible for the debris were
arrested last week on charges including endangering the public.
   Interstate 78, which is used by more than 100,000 motorists a
day, links western New Jersey's heavily populated suburbs with the
New Jersey Turnpike and ultimately New York. Commuters have had to
take detours, causing long tie-ups.
   Repairs are expected to take about eight months and cost about $5
million, said Randy Linthurst, a spokesman for the state Department
of Transportation.

<HEAD>Less Than Half the Public Supports New Japanese Administration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of new Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
has more public support than the previous administration, but its
approval rating remains below 50 percent, according to results of a
poll released today.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party has pinned its hopes for
recovering its popularity on Kaifu, 58, who became prime minister
Aug. 9. His predecessor, Sousuke Uno, resigned after only 69 days in
office following the party's heavy losses in July 23 elections for
the upper house of Parliament.
   Kyodo News Service said 46.5 percent of those responding to a
poll conducted last week approved of Kaifu's new administration,
compared with 35.5 percent who supported the Uno Cabinet when it was
formed on June 2.
   Forty-three percent of respondents said they disapproved of
Kaifu's administration, compared to 49 percent who opposed the Uno
Cabinet, it added.
   It said the poll showed support for the conservative governing
party rose 9.6 percentage points from June to 40.8 percent, while
support for the biggest victor in the elections, the Japan Socialist
Party, rose 5.3 percentage points to a record 33.8 percent.
   Kaifu's initial support rating was the third lowest since Kyodo
began conducting approval polls in the 1960s, the news agency said.
The lowest rating for a newly formed Cabinet was for the
administration of Takeo Fukuda, formed in November 1976, it said.
   Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, began his administration
with a support rating of 58.6 percent in November 1987, but that
dropped to an all-time low of 3.9 percent in April of this year,
largely because of a stock-trading scandal that forced him to resign.
   Asked why they supported the Kaifu administration, the largest
number of respondents, 28.9 percent, said there was no other
appropriate person for the post, Kyodo said.
   The main reason given for opposing the new government, cited by
33.7 percent of respondents, was that it was backed by the Liberal
Democratic Party, it said.
   Kyodo said 3,000 eligible voters were contacted in the poll,
conducted Aug. 11-12, and 1,968 responded. It did not provide a
margin of error.

<TEXT>
   Leona Helmsley _ the self-annointed hotel queen
portrayed in court as a tight-fisted tyrant _ had no friends, a
former aide says.
   That was exactly what Mrs. Helmsley's lawyer wanted the jury to
hear.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is charged with evading about $1 million in
federal taxes by charging about $4 million in personal expenses to
Helmsley businesses. Her husband, Harry, 80, was previously ruled
mentally incompetent to stand trial.
   Defense attorney Gerald Feffer has sought to show that the couple
were entitled to bill Helmsley businesses for expenses at their
Greenwich, Conn., mansion because they used it to do work and
entertain business associates.
   Feffer on Tuesday opened his case by calling Mrs. Helmsley's
former personal assistant, Martin Goldstein, to the stand. Goldstein
had also testified for the prosecution.
   Goldstein testified that Mrs. Helmsley and her husband spent most
of their time on the weekends working at Dunnellen Hall. He said
they read correspondence, financial reports and other business
documents.
   ``Mr. Goldstein, did the Helmsleys have any personal friends?''
Feffer asked.
   ``No,'' he replied.
   Goldstein said he once presented Harry Helmsley with a stack of
financial reports and told Helmsley they might put him to sleep.
   ``Put me to sleep? This is the most exciting reading I can get,''
he said Helmsley replied.
   Previous witnesses had portrayed Mrs. Helmsley as an abusive boss
who extorted kickbacks from liquor suppliers, didn't pay her bills
and forced suppliers to charge personal expenses to her business.
   Even her attorney conceded she was ``demanding'' and ``abrasive.''
   Also Tuesday, U.S. District Judge John Walker reserved decision
on whether to admit an accounting report that Feffer says shows the
Helmsleys are actually owed $681,000 in tax refunds in 1983-85, the
years charged in the indictment.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita said the defense gave him a
copy on Monday. He complained that the documents should have been
turned over much earlier under the rules of evidence.
   The judge admonished Feffer for not furnishing the material
earlier. ``To me, it is inexcusable and I can't understand why it
didn't happen,'' he said.

   Elvis Presley fans marking the 12th
anniversary of his death filed solemnly past his pool-side grave in
a candlelight procession early today.
   The vigil, which began Tuesday night, drew 3,000 to 4,000
participants, police said. The affair is the largest single event of
Elvis International Tribute Week, a nine-day lineup of concerts,
memorials and fan get-togethers.
   Presley died of heart disease on Aug. 16, 1977. He is buried next
to the swimming pool at his white-columned estate, Graceland.
   Participants in the vigil marched single file up the quarter-mile
drive at Graceland, carrying tapers lighted from a torch fired from
an eternal flame at Presley's graveside. Many left roses by the
simple marker.
   Devotees began lining up at Graceland's distinctive gates _
decorated with musical notes and a rendering of Elvis _ five to six
hours before the procession.
   By the time the ceremony began, the highway in front of the
mansion was filled with Elvis fans, more than a few with Elvis-style
metallic sunglasses, spangled belts or jet-black hairdos.
   Paul Campione, 6, of New York, wore a green jumpsuit with a white
cape as he posed for snapshots, striking karate poses a la Elvis.
``I love Elvis. He was kind and generous and I like his music,'' the
boy said.
   His mother, Angela, said her son was entered in an Elvis
impersonator contest at a local nightclub.
   The graveside vigil has been sponsored by the Elvis Country Fan
Club for 11 years. The club has more than 1,200 members worldwide,
many of them too young to have been Presley fans when he was alive,
said club president Georganna Reynolds.
   ``One reason for a fan club is to pass the torch, to keep the
candle burning,'' she said.
   The 7-year-old Tribute Week is organized by the managers of
Graceland, which draws 650,000 visitors a year, including some
40,000 during the anniversary celebration.
   Presley bought the three-story residence in 1957 when his rock
'n' roll career began to take off. It was opened to the public in
1982.
   Graceland and its 36,000-square-foot souvenir shopping center
across the highway take in some $12 million a year and are run for
the benefit of Presley's only child, Lisa Marie.

<HEAD>Mozambique Rebels Announce Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mozambican rebel forces have issued a peace
plan saying they would rather participate in elections than carry on
their 12-year-old battle to oust the government by force.
   Their 16-point plan, released in Nairobi Tuesday, represented an
answer to an earlier proposal by the Mozambican government of
President Joaquim Chissano.
   The rebel plan said neither the rebels nor the government would
gain from continued fighting.
   ``It is not Renamo's intention to change the existing order in
Mozambique through armed force,'' said the two-page document,
referring to the Portuguese acronym for the rebel Mozambique
National Resistance.
   ``The armed struggle is just a last recourse in the defense of
the people against the negation of their rights,'' the two-page
document said.
   Renamo has been fighting the Marxist-oriented government since
Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1977. The war has
killed an estimated 600,000 people.
   The rebel proposal followed a week of discussions that began Aug.
8 in Nairobi between Renamo and a delegation of Mozambican Roman
Catholic and protestant church leaders.
   During the talks, the church officials presented a 12-point peace
plan from the Mozambican government.
   Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama said the rebel proposal was a
response to Chissano's offer, which was never made public.
   In its proposal, Renamo called for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from the southeast African nation and urged ``genuine'' peace
negotiations be held.
   The United States and many other Western countries have been
providing non-military aid to the Mozambique government, which
continues to get the bulk of its arms from Soviet bloc. Some Western
countries, including Britain and Portugal, provide some security
assistance. Zimbabwe has large number of troops in Mozambique
helping the government fight the war.
   Chissano said recently he has accepted South Africa's word that
it no longer aids the rebels. However, Mozambique still believes the
rebels receive help from non-governmental groups in South Africa.
   Renamo's statement said the rebels want negotiations toward ``a
national reconciliation without winners or losers'' that would
``finally end in peace.''
   Renamo's other proposals included a call for its own recognition
``as a political force,'' an end to verbal attacks by Chissano's
government and general elections. The guerrilla proposal also stated
Renamo's opposition to human rights abuses.
   ``Renamo is a guerrilla force whose survival depends only on the
people, therefore it is by nature against any atrocity that risks
the lives of the people, its reason for being,'' said the document.
   The rebels have been accused of committing atrocities against
civilians while seeking food or new recruits.
   In an English-language news release accompanying the proposal,
Dhlakama said the church leaders and rebels addressed the withdrawal
of foreign troops and possible ways of ending the conflict.
   The closed-door meetings between church leaders and rebels were
held under Kenyan government auspices.
   The Nairobi talks followed Chissano's request to Presidents
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to mediate an
end to conflict in the former Portuguese colony.
   Mozambique is one of the world's poorest countries. An estimated
6 million of its 15 million people receive food aid.

   A group formed to promote solutions to social
problems today honored the Guardian Angels for their patrols on the
London subway and said they led authorities to improve security on
the system.
   ``Whatever the government's reservations about this group may be,
they have had a salutary effect on the authorities, who have been
shamed into placing more police on the Underground system as a
result,'' said the citation from the Institute for Social Inventions.
   ``Rigorously self-disciplined, unpaid and imaginatively trained,
they are visibly succeeding not only in New York, but in other
cities,'' it said.
   The Guardian Angels began patrolling the London subway in May,
wearing their trademark T-shirts and red berets. They underwent
three months of training supervised by the organization's American
founder, Curtis Sliwa.
   British police and government officials opposed the Guardian
Angels setting up in London, saying law enforcement should be left
to professionals.
   But after their arrival, the government said it would temporarily
assign an additional 80 police officers to patrol the subway system.
   British Transport Police refused comment on the award.
   The Institute for Social Inventions each year gives out 12 awards
worth a total of $1,500 to groups or individuals who come up with
``new and imaginative ideas to improve the quality of life.''

<HEAD>Palestinians Call for Strikes to Protest Identity Cards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian activists in the occupied Gaza Strip
today called for a two-week boycott of jobs in Israel to protest new
computerized identity cards for day laborers.
   The call came one day after leaflets distributed by activists in
the occupied West Bank also told day laborers there to strike for a
week to protest the measure imposed on the Gazans.
   Palestinians in the occupied territories were already in the
second day of a separate general strike today. Shops, offices and
many schools remained closed for the strike, which was called to
mark a prison riot last year that left two Palestinians dead.
   The new strikes are to start Friday, when Israel has said it will
start enforcing the new identity card system. An estimated 50,000
Gazans and 60,000 West Bank Arabs work in Israel and play an
important role in its economy.
   On Tuesday, an Israeli truck driver was charged with manslaughter
and reckless driving in the deaths of four Gaza Arabs on Dec. 8,
1987. Riots touched off by the traffic deaths are viewed as the
beginning of the uprising.
   In renewed violence today, five Palestinians were shot and
wounded in stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops, Arab reports
said.
   Slogans spray-painted on walls in the coastal Gaza Strip, signed
by leaders of the 20-month-old uprising, urged the day laborers to
stay away from their jobs in Israel to defy its efforts to control
them by requiring the cards.
   The government began to issue the computerized identity cards two
months ago to try to control the movement of Gaza day laborers. The
move came after the kidnapping and killing of an Israeli soldier in
the Gaza Strip and other attacks by Gazans on Jews inside Israel.
   Cards are denied to anyone with a criminal record or who is
considered a security risk.
   The work boycott could result in a permanent loss of jobs for
many of the Palestinians. Israeli employers have been under growing
pressure to replace Palestinian workers with Israelis, both for
security reasons and to reduce domestic unemployment.
   Earlier, Palestinian activists launched a campaign to sabotage
the identity card operation, urging Palestinians to reject the cards.
   The charges against the 29-year-old Israeli truck driver, Herzl
Bokovza, were delayed for 20 months because of police investigations
and a backlog in the courts, Justice Ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshed
said.
   According to witnesses, Bokovza's truck collided with a car
carrying Gaza laborers from the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing all
four Arabs in the car.
   Rumors spread through the Gaza Strip that the truck had
intentionally run over the workers, and rioting broke out.

   A decorated U.S. drug agent whose undercover work
goes back to the French Connection days was himself arrested in a
sting by colleagues after he allegedly walked into a setup carrying
62 pounds of cocaine.
   Edward K. O'Brien devised some of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration's best undercover operations during an 18-year
career, said fellow Agent John J. Coleman, who described himself as
a friend of O'Brien's.
   O'Brien, 44, was arrested late Monday at Logan International
Airport while delivering suitcases filled with cocaine to
informants, authorities said.
   ``This is a very sad, sad moment in drug enforcement,'' Coleman
said Tuesday.
   Coleman said he and O'Brien worked together in southern France
trying to uncover heroin labs in the 1970s.
   ``Those were the hotbeds of activity in the French Connection
days,'' he said.
   Coleman said O'Brien's knowledge of how sting operations worked
made his arrest particularly difficult. To conduct the sting that
netted O'Brien, the DEA used private citizens who cooperated with
the agency, Coleman said.
   ``You're dealing with someone in every respect who would be
knowledgeable of everything,'' Coleman said.
   O'Brien headed the DEA's Springfield office from 1982 to 1988 and
received a special citation from Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1984 for
supervising a crackdown on a major cocaine ring in western
Massachusetts.
   Before his arrest O'Brien worked at agency headquarters in
Arlington, Va., helping set up a DEA museum, said spokesman George
Festa. O'Brien has been placed on leave.
   Coleman said O'Brien received the cocaine earlier Monday from an
informant in Miami. O'Brien received $14,000 to transport the drugs
and was expecting to receive another $14,000 on delivery in Boston,
Coleman said.
   O'Brien was charged with possession with intent to distribute
cocaine, and could get 10 years in prison and fines up to $4 million
if convicted, said U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd said.
   O'Brien's brothers Paul, 34, and John were arrested Tuesday and
charged with conspiring to possess cocaine with intent to distribute.
   Edward and John O'Brien, who is from Bourne, Mass., were held
pending a bail hearing Thursday. Paul O'Brien, of Sandwich, Mass.,
was released on $25,000 bail.
   Coleman said that in July, O'Brien, under DEA surveillance,
Miami, obtained about 55 pounds of cocaine and sham cocaine and
brought it to Boston from Miami for $25,000.

<TEXT>
   Four U.S. Air Force jets came dangerously
close to colliding with a Spanish commercial jetliner carrying 50
people, an aviation official said today.
   Antonio Yus, the director of air traffic at Zaragoza's airport,
said the incident occurred the afternoon of Aug. 10 when the U.S.
A-10A Warthog jets were returning to the air base at Zaragoza and
the Aviaco jet was approaching to land.
   The air base and Zaragoza airport share a landing strip.
   The pilot of the DC-9 saw the Warthogs coming at him and had to
climb at 60 degrees, at 2,000 feet per minute, to avoid a crash, Yus
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   The normal climbing speed is 500 feet per minute.
   ``It was clearly a dangerous situation because neither the
airline pilot nor air traffic controllers had been informed of the
jets' flight, and they were not in contact with the tower,'' Yus
said.
   The American jets, NATO anti-tank aircraft normally stationed in
West Germany, were at the Zaragoza base to practice firing at nearby
Bardenas Real training range, he said.
   A U.S. Air Force spokesman, Lt. Cliff Atkinson, said the air
force was preparing a statement on the incident.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A principal who cut his own job so
teachers would not be laid off is back at work after an outpouring
of support from townspeople.
   A cheer rattled the rafters of Town Hall after the school
committee voted unanimously Monday night to reinstate Norman Najimy.
   The committee said it did not know where it would get the $43,000
to pay Najimy, who has been teaching for 37 years. But members said
they were bowing to the overwhelming desire of parents and others in
the Berkshire town of 1,600.
   Four weeks earlier, Najimy, whose country elementary school of
200 pupils was cited for excellence by the U.S. Education
Department, had suggested the board eliminate his job to protect
teachers from sharp budget cuts.
   ``The parents have been just wonderful and so have the senior
citizens. It's a myth they don't care about the schools. Richmond's
senior citizens were ready to make cash donations out of their own
pockets,'' Najimy said Tuesday.
   ``If there is one lesson I have learned from all this, it is that
there are a lot of people in this country that believe in education
and were eager for someone to speak out about reordering our
national priorities.''
   Najimy had received job offers from schools all over the country.
   Even Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, whose cuts in state aid have been
blamed for much of the town's financial problems, telephoned.
   ``He asked if there was any way he could help get me back into
the job,'' Najimy said. ``I told him that my concern was not that,
but what we are going to do to preserve good schools.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Announce Major Opposition Unity Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid leaders today
announced plans for a national conference aimed at unifying
opposition to the government. They called on foreign countries to
ensure the meeting was not banned.
   Organizers of the ``historic conference'' on Oct. 7 include
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, black miners' union leader Cyril
Ramaphosa, and Albertina Sisulu, co-president of the banned United
Democratic Front coalition.
   ``The aim of the conference will be to map out the most
effective, shortest path to the ending of oppression and
exploitation, and the creation of a democratic country,'' the
organizers said in a statement.
   ``We expect the conference to be attended by thousands of
delegates from all walks of life, representing millions of poeple.''
   A similar broad-based, anti-apartheid conference was scheduled to
be held in Cape Town last year but was banned by the government.
   Predicting another ban this year, the conference organizers said,
``We are alerting the international community to monitor the actions
of the regime in relation to this gathering of the people.''
   They said officials from the United States, Soviet Union, Western
Europe and southern Africa had been briefed about the conference, to
be held in Johannesburg.
   ``The current mood of our people is such that we believe they
will defy any attempt by the state to prevent the conference from
going ahead,'' the organizers said.
   They noted that a nationwide defiance campaign already was under
way, challenging various segregation laws as the Sept. 6
parliamentary elections approach.
   The organizers said any group would be welcome to join the
conference which shared support for seven basic demands.
   These were a one-person, one-vote political system, lifting of
the state of emergency, unconditional release of political
prisoners, unbanning of political organizations, freedom of
association and expression, press freedom, and a ``living wage'' for
all workers.
   The announcement made no mention of the forced resignation of
P.W. Botha this week and the appointment of F.W. de Klerk, leader of
the governing National Party, as acting president.
   De Klerk has promised a five-year program to bring the black
majority into the political structure, but activists say his
proposal is too vague and too slow.
   The specific issue which triggered Botha's split with his Cabinet
was the planned trip by de Klerk on Aug. 28 to confer with Zambia's
President Kenneth Kaunda, a vehement critic of apartheid.
   Tom Langley, foreign affairs spokesman for the far-right
Conservative Party, today described Kaunda as ``an outspoken enemy
of South Africa'' and urged de Klerk to call off the meeting.
   If the meeting takes place, Langley said, de Klerk should ``give
a public assurance that no internal affairs will be discussed.''
   Langley said Kaunda in effect would be representing the African
National Congress guerrilla movement, which wages a bombing and
sabotage campaign aimed at toppling the National Party government.

<TEXT>
   Iran's Parliament today elected as its new
speaker Mehdi Karrubi, a middle-ranking clergyman who has been
instrumental in trying to export Iran's Islamic revolution to other
Moslem countries.
   State-run Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said 145 of the 243
deputies at today's vote supported Karrubi.
   Karrubi, who has long experience in the Majlis, or Parliament,
was appointed deputy speaker last year to Hashemi Rafsanjani, who
had served as speaker since 1980.
   Rafsanjani resigned Tuesday to take over the presidency, which he
won with 94.5 percent of the vote last month.
   As head of the Pilgrimage Bureau, Karrubi has been a leader in
the movement to spread Iran's fundamentalist revolution.
   In 1987, he led his country's pilgrims to Mecca, where Saudi
troops were called in to quell political rioting allegedly
instigated by the Iranian contingent. The violence left 400 pilgrims
dead, mostly Iranians.
   At an anti-Saudi demonstration this year, Karrubi said the 1987
riots were ``a calculated plot designed by American and Israeli
advisers to prevent the spread of the Islamic revolution to other
parts of the world.''
   Karrubi is believed to have considerable influence with radicals
in the Iranian hierarchy, headed by Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, who oppose moves to improve ties to the West.
   Karrubi also had good relations with the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, who appointed him head of the Martyrs' Foundation, a vast
conglomerate that controls more than 700 enterprises.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on the death of Congressman Mickey
Leland:
   The death of Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas while on a famine-relief
trip tp Ethiopia reminds us of the nobler side of politics.
   Congress is not held in particularly high esteem these days.
Still, many individual members of Congress _ perhaps even most _ are
highly principled, dedicated, hard-working public servants who are
genuinely interested in serving the public good.
   Leland was one of them, although not all of his colleagues or his
constituents were captivated by his driving humanitarianism. He was
sometimes criticized for his obsession with bringing relief to the
starving people of Africa; his detractors said he should have
concentrated on the hungry people of the United States instead.
   But Leland had an answer for that: ``I am as much a citizen of
this world as I am of my country,'' he said. ``To hell with those
people who are critical of what I am able to do to help save
people's lives. I don't mean to sound hokey but I grew up on a
Christian ethic which says we are supposed to help the least of our
brothers.''

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on the death of Congressman Mickey Leland:
   Mickey Leland, 44, died last week in the country that was birth
to his mission as a politician.
   The U.S. Representative from Houston had always fought on behalf
of people in need, but in 1983 he toured Ethiopia and was shaken by
the desolation and deprivation he saw visited upon the people there.
   When he returned to Washington, ... Leland began his crusade to
create a select committee on hunger. That committee, with ... Leland
at its head, has been the conscience of the Hill _ not just
concerning famine relief for Ethiopia, but the plight of the poor in
the United States. ...
   The impetus behind the formation of the hunger committee was a
trip to an Ethopian refugee camp, where a little girl died before
his eyes from the hunger that consumed her. It was on his fifth trip
to such refugee camps that his plane crashed.
   The tributes to him from President Bush, from House Speaker
Thomas Foley, from activist Jesse Jackson go properly to one who, in
... Foley's words, ``represented the best in compassion that we as a
nation possess.''
   Real tribute to Mickey Leland will come as such leaders work to
ensure that a commitment to feed the hungry is always a top priority
of this land of plenty.

   The Union Leader, Manchester, N.H., on quiet diplomacy and the
hostages:
   President Bush, who could have restored not only American faith
and world respect but given himself just a tremendous boost as our
new leader, seems to have hunkered down to threats against American
hostages in the Middle East.
   He talks of long, quiet ``diplomacy'' to get back some _ not all
_ of our hostages.
   This is wrong, terribly wrong. We cannot allow the remaining
hostages (most of whom knew the risks they were taking to stay in
Lebanon) to handcuff our foreign policy. Nor can we allow our
enemies to continue to kill Americans with impunity.
   We must not, but we fear that is what is happening.

   The Providence (R.I.) Sunday Journal on Collin Powell as JCS
chairman:
   If the Senate concurs, and there really isn't the slightest doubt
that it will, Gen. Colin Powell, 52, will soon become the youngest
man to be named chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as
the first black ever to hold that powerful position.
   President Bush has chosen well.
   Not that the selection was all that surprising. ...
   Powell made his mark under the Reagan administration, so he is
well known and highly respected by ... Bush and the members of his
national security team.
   And so while the naming of ... Powell will understandably be
accorded added symbolic significance because he is black and
relatively young, this should not draw attention from the main
point: The nominee is eminently suited for the job.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on babies without brains:
   In a civilized society, doctors trying to save life cannot be
allowed to profane the dying. Yet that's just what the medical
community would do if it comes out on the wrong side of the debate
involving brain-absent babies and organ transplants.
   Although the debate involves a small number of potential organ
donors _ fewer than 200 brain-absent babies are born alive in the
United States each year _ it has far-reaching implications.
   By the time an anencephalic baby dies, usually within a few days
of birth, its organs often have deteriorated to the point that they
are not usable for transplant purposes. Those who want to speed up
the process, by declaring living children dead and maintaining them
on life-support systems until their organs are needed, would do a
terrible thing.
   A disturbing report appeared recently in the New England Journal
of Medicine. Authors argued that anencephalic babies are not alive,
and that doctors should therefore be allowed to ignore the usual
standards of brain death in order to use such an infant's organs
earlier.
   The suggestion is chilling.
   What Dr. Robert D. Truog of Harvard Medical School and
bioethicist John C. Fletcher of the University of Virginia propose
is the creation of an artificially sustained class of ever-ready
organ donors. ...
   Currently, most transplant centers will not traffic in
anencephalic organs, because such donors are not considered dead
under standards set by either states or medical societies. With
today's technological advances, however, doctors have the ability to
blur the fine line between life and death, morality and immorality.
   Those who misuse brain-absent babies leap across that line.
   The precedent such transplants would set would be devastating. If
doctors succeed in keeping brain-absent babies alive on machines
until their organs are needed, it's not much of a jump for them to
consider the same fate for comatose adults, or anyone else the
medical community has given up on.

   St. Cloud (Minn.) Times on 900-number phone calls:
   The phone bill arrives. It's unusually high. Ah, hah. Someone's
been making calls to those 900 numbers _ the ones promising all
sorts of exciting messages.
   Unfortunately, children comprise a big share of the market for
services offered by a 900 number. Who else would respond to a sleazy
television commercial advertising the chance to talk to Mickey
Mouse, the Tooth Fairy or horror movie king Freddy Krueger?
   Action for Children's Television, the national advocacy
organization for quality young people's programming, has filed a
petition with the Federal Trade Commission demanding that AT&amp;T
provide consumer safeguards on special-charge 900 numbers.
   The group wants the company forced to give refunds to parents who
get surprise phone bills for 900 calls by their children _ at least
the first one _ and requests AT&amp;T offer blocking of 900 calls on
their phone line if requested. They also want bills itemized to
clearly indicate services directed to children aged 12 and under.
   It's a good theory on the surface.
   And in reality, it's not feasible to expect one company, which
only provides the lines and billing for the information providers,
to excuse all bills claimed to be made by a child. If that were the
case, a precedent would be set for erasing responsibility for what
our children do. It would also teach children the lesson that they
can get away with irresponsible behavior because their parents will
get them out of it.
   Temptations such as 900 recordings are here to stay, and until
blocking is available on all telephone companies, large phone bills
are a danger. Parents must teach their children to make responsible
choices and take the consequences when they don't.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on airline deregulation:
   The current financial state of America's domestic airline
industry can be summed up in four words: profits up, bargains down.
   The relatively few airlines that made it through the
post-deregulation chaos are reporting record profits. The good news
for the industry, however, translates into bad news for travelers.
Fares are up _ by more than 15 percent in the past year. And
discounts, frequent flier programs and other enticements ... are
fewer and more restrictive.
   More disturbing, however, is the fact that only eight airlines _
United, American, Delta, Northwest, TWA, USAIR, Pan Am and
Continental _ control more than 90 percent of the domestic market.
That concentration of market control is the antithesis of what
deregulation was supposed to be all about. ...
   The free market has worked and the fittest have survived, but at
what cost to those companies that died along the way and those
cities that no longer have air service?

   Herald Times Reporter, Manitowoc-Two Rivers, Wis., on the atomic
bomb:
   Almost without notice two significant anniversaries passed last
week.
   Sunday was the 44th anniversary of the first atomic bomb attack
on Japan carried out by a U.S. B-29 bomber. And Wednesday was the
same for the second and the world's last nuclear attack to date.
   It was Aug. 6, 1945, that about 140,000 people lost their lives
in a firestorm that engulfed the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three
days later nearly half that amount lost their lives at Nagasaki.
   Those two days did as much as anything in this century to change
the course of the world. While the attacks resulted in a swift end
to the U.S.'s Pacific involvement in World War II, it was the
beginning of the atomic age, the nuclear age. And it was the
beginning of awareness of the power of nuclear energy and the horror
of it if used improperly.
   Every day the world lives in fear of a nuclear holocaust. Will it
ever happen? No one can know, but the sheer thought of it should
never leave the minds of those who are in global decision-making
positions.
   And just remembering Hiroshima and Nagasaki should make everyone
strive for peace every day of their lives.

   The Hutchinson (Kan.) News on the HUD scandal:
   Not even solid, conservative columnist James J. Kilpatrick can
stand the stench seeping from the records of Ronald Reagan's
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   ``The more one learns of this rotten affair, the worse it gets,''
Kilpatrick wrote ... in his nationally syndicated column, ``A
Conservative View.''
   He called the scandal shameful, and correctly put the blame
squarely where it belongs. Ronald Reagan and his handpicked aide,
Samuel Pierce, did absolutely nothing in all those years to close
the spigots of money going to those who were looting the Treasury.
   Kilpatrick's discovery of Reaganesque incompetence is better late
than never, and it is a discovery that should be embraced promptly
by others who have tolerated as merely unique a management style
that was essentially a non-management effort. ...
   Kilpatrick could go one step further in his assignation of blame
and accountability. Beyond Reagan and Pierce, the blame lies with
those who embraced the virtues of illusions, jokes and old movie
scripts to take their minds off the difficult business of running a
decent government.

   Seattle Post-Intelligencer on the embryo fight:
   In London's Observer in 1950, the British clergyman Lord Fisher
declared that ``the only thing that science has done for man in the
last 100 years is to create for him fresh moral problems.'' Almost
40 years later, science continues to create such problems.
   Take the embryo imbroglio in ... Tennessee. There, in a bizarre
custody dispute, a divorcing couple is arguing over control of what
one lawyer has called the ``preborn children'' of their union.
   The estranged wife, Mary Sue Davis, had been unable to carry
naturally fertilized embryos to term. A fertility program at a
Knoxville hospital artificially fertilized eggs taken from the
woman's body with sperm of her now estranged husband, Junior Lewis
Davis.
   The result was nine fertilized human eggs. Two subsequently were
implanted in the woman's womb with no success. Then came the
divorce, and the dispute over the remaining seven fertilized eggs.
...
   While we may not completely share ... Fisher's morose evaluation
of scientific accomplishment, we cannot debate his assertion that
scientific progress has shoved us up against more and more
complicated if not more difficult moral dilemmas. Progress has not
only blessed us with the wonders of medical science but with its
horrors, too.

   The Times, Trenton, N.J., on the investigation into the crash
Flight 103:
   President Bush's decision to reverse himself and create a study
commission on the Flight 103 disaster was just plain common sense.
   Flight 103 exploded last Dec. 23 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing 270 people.
   Among other things, the commission will look into allegations
that airline security was lax and that the lack of uniform
counterterrorism policy increased the chances for such disaster.
   Families of the victims have questioned why the United States
failed to make public the terrorist threats against the airline,
especially since some U.S. officials abroad were advised against
taking the flight.
   It's time to resolve the questions concerning the disaster, and
it's time to separate fact from rumor. It's also time to look for
better ways to protect air travelers. The commission is the right
way to achieve these goals. ...
   Bush was right to change his mind.

<HEAD>Dockworkers Refuse to Handle Toxic Wastes From Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Port owners and dockworkers today
refused to unload Canadian toxic waste from a Soviet freighter,
despite assurances from the environment minister that it poses no
pollution or health risks.
   The freighter Nadezhda Obukhova was carrying polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs, from Montreal when it docked at Liverpool,
northwest England. The cargo was to have been sent to a special
high-temperature incinerator in south Wales.
   But the Mersey Docks and Harbor Co. refused to allow the PCBs to
be unloaded and said the ship will return to Canada after unloading
other cargo.
   Earlier this month, the Tilbury Port Authority at the mouth of
the River Thames refused to handle a separate consignment of PCBs
from Canada, and another Soviet freighter had to take them back to
Montreal.
   PCBs were used primarily as a coolant in electrical transformers,
but have been banned in North America because they have been linked
with cancer.
   Regarding the ship in Liverpool, a dock company spokesman said:
``The ship will be discharging and unloading other cargo and sailing
tonight.''
   A dockers' spokesman, who also requested anonymity in keeping
with British custom, said: ``We did not know how serious it was
until it was brought to light recently and became a political
football.''
   The Liverpool port's refusal to handle the PCBs follows a wave of
protests from residents of New Inn, Wales, where the Rechem
International Ltd. incinerator is located, and from the Greenpeace
environmental group.
   About 100 protestors greeted the ship when it arrived at the
Royal Seaforth Container Terminal four hours later than scheduled
because of bad weather in the Irish Sea.
   The environment secretary, Chris Patten, said the Liverpool
dockers had ``no reason whatsoever'' to fear the cargo on
environmental grounds.
   He said government regulations, tightened following a toxic waste
controversy last year, ensured the Canadians PCBs were safe to
handle.
   ``There is no reason whatsoever why on environmental grounds
these cargoes should not be handled,'' he said. ``After all, the
port has been handling these cargoes safely for some time.''
   Rechem has a contract to dispose of a total of 13 consignments of
wastes to be shipped from Canada in the coming weeks. Company
spokesman Allan Woods said its lawyers are studying the contract,
although Rechem is not considering legal action ``at this stage.''
Rechem, he said, will ``defend our position.''
   Canada has only one incinerator capable of disposing of PCBs. It
is located in Alberta and does not accept wastes from other
provinces.
   Britain tightened its regulations for accepting chemical wastes
last year after a ship containing 2,000 tons of toxic waste,
including PCBs, was banned from docking. The Karin B, a West German
vessel, was carrying Italian wastes which had been illegally dumped
in Nigeria.
   The wastes were ordered removed from the African country and were
rejected by several European nations before being finally accepted
back by Italy.

   President Bush will discuss his new drug policy in a
televised speech to the nation on Sept. 5, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   Bush is to unveil the details of his administration's war on

   Fitzwater, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One en route
to Miami, said Bush felt the issue was important enough to warrant a
nationwide TV address, which will be the first of his presidency.
   The spokesman said the address probably would come from the White
House, although the exact location and time have not been determined.

   Two minor parties today endorsed the idea
of a coalition government led by the Solidarity movement,
strengthening Lech Walesa's bid to create the East bloc's first
non-communist government.
   The United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party, which hold the
balance of power in the Polish legislature, said they would back a
Solidarity-led coalition.
   ``We have entered a period of an open fight for power,''
Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski told Communist
lawmakers today. ``The situation is dangerous, but it is not time to
put up our hands'' in surrender, the state-run PAP news agency
quoted him as saying.
   A Soviet diplomat expressed concern over the developments in
Poland but said Moscow would not interfere.
   The governing crisis that threatens to interrupt more than four
decades of communist rule began with the party's crushing losses in
June parliamentary elections, the most democratic balloting in the
country since World War II.
   Huge gains made by the Solidarity-led opposition hampered
communist efforts to form a coalition government.
   On Monday, Communist Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said he was
prepared to resign and abandon efforts to assemble a Cabinet in the
face of Solidarity's opposition to any communist-led government.
Kiszczak became prime minister 12 days ago.
   On Tuesday, President Wojciech Jaruzelski proposed a meeting of
the country's main political leaders to find ``rational solutions,''
but there was no word on when the meeting might take place.
   Solidarity has said that only an opposition-led government will
have the public support needed to deal with a deteriorating economy
and a $39 billion foreign debt.
   The possibility that Solidarity may lead a new Polish government
has worried Polish communists and the Soviets, who fear the Warsaw
Pact military alliance could be threatened.
   A communist legislator who asked not to be identified said
Rakowski gave a ``very emotional'' speech today on the challenge to
his party.
   ``What can you expect after such a lack of diplomacy by
Solidarity?'' he said. ``Nobody in the world wants to give up power.
And they want a government without communists. They could have
power, but only by going step by step and not trying to turn it over
all at once.''
   In a bid to ease Soviet fears, Walesa, the Solidarity leader, on
Tuesday promised that in any Solidarity-led government the Communist
Party would be given control of the ``sensitive'' ministries of
defense and interior that control the army and internal police.
   It was possible communists could receive other ministries as
well, union spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said today.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yuri Gremitskikh, said today
that Walesa's statement was ``very sensible... In regard to the
following, that Poland is a member of the Warsaw Pact and Solidarity
should make the necessary conclusions as a result of that.''
   He said the Soviet Union was ``very much concerned'' about the
Polish situation but, ``We don't interfere in the internal affairs
of that country. The Polish people should decide themselves.''
   A Polish communist official said the party ``will not take
responsibility for the result'' if Solidarity forms a coalition
government that excludes the communists.
   ``Every thinking man ... should realize that we are not a state
of parliamentary democracy yet,'' party Secretary Slawomir Wiatr was
quoted as saying in the Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawy. ``Having a
parliament majority in itself is not sufficient to exercise power.''
   Kiszczak on Monday said he would turn over his unsuccessful
attempt to form a ``grand coalition'' government to Peasant Party
Chairman Roman Malinowski.
   But Malinowski has not publicly said if he wants to be a
candidate for prime minister, and his own Peasant Party legislators
declared after meeting with him today that they ``fully support Lech
Walesa's initiative.''
   In a resolution, they urged party leaders to ``quickly realize''
the Walesa coalition plan, party spokesman Jozef Kowalczyk said.
   Kowalczyk declined to say what majority the resolution was
supported by the 76 Peasant lawmakers, who make up the third-largest
parliamentary delegation after the communists and Solidarity.
Malinowski returned to party headquarters to meet with party
leaders, he said.
   Meanwhile, the 27-member Democratic Party caucus also met and
with only one negative vote adopted a resolution supporting the
Solidarity-led coalition, said their caucus leader, Jan Janowski.
   Janowski said coalition talks with Solidarity started last week
and while there had been no decision on whom to propose as prime
minister, he understood the premier would come from Solidarity, the
largest coalition partner.
   Deputy prime ministers would come from the two minor parties, he
said.
   Walesa said Tuesday that he would serve as prime minister ``if
society wishes it.'' But he said that he would prefer someone else
take the office.

<TEXT>
   The leader of Lebanon's Christian forces
today welcomed a U.N. call for an immediate cease-fire as Syrian and
allied Moslem troops reportedly bolstered their forces outside the
Christian heartland.
   The Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, ``welcomes
without any conditions the U.N. Security Council resolution,'' said
an Aoun spokesman, who demanded anonymity.
   ``The resolution, as we understand it, is a package deal that
involves not just a cease-fire, but also the lifting of blockades
and planning the Syrian military pull-out from Lebanon,'' the
spokesman added.
   The spokesman did not elborate, and it was unclear if Aoun's
welcoming of the truce was tantamount to accepting it.
   The U.N. resolution made no direct references to Syria or its
blockade of the embattled Christian enclave. But it called on ``all
the parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all
firing and shelling on land and at sea.'' The resolution also called
for ``the opening of the lines of communication and the lifting of
the sieges.''
   There was little fighting in Beirut today after heavy artillery
battles on Tuesday.
   Aoun's statement was issued one day after the Syrian army and
Moslem factions vowed to join forces to defeat the Christians.
Sources today reported a buildup of troops and ammunition around the
Christian heartland.
   There was no reaction to the U.N. cease-fire demand from Syrian
and Moslem forces. The 15-nation Security Council had called for the
truce during an emergency meeting ordered by Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Arab League ministers also renewed their call for an end to the
fighting. Arab League committee members King Hassan II of Morocco,
King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz Saud of Saudi Arabia and Algerian President
Chadli Benjedid called in a statement for ``an immediate and
global'' cease-fire.
   Police said 19 people had been killed and 104 wounded in the
fighting since Tuesday, when Christian forces fought Syrian troops
with tanks and artillery along the southern, eastern and northern
edges of the Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   Syrian gunners also pounded the 28-mile-long Christian coastline,
the only escape route for the area's residents.
   By police count, 760 people have been killed and 2,050 wounded
since the latest round of fighting in Lebanon's civil war began
March 8.
   Since then, shelling day and night has largely destroyed Beirut
and driven out 90 percent of the city's 1.5 million residents.
   The fighting between the 20,000 mostly Christian troops under
army Aoun and Syria's 40,000 soldiers slackened early today to
intermittent shelling.
   But Moslem security sources speaking on condition of anonymity
said the Syrians were reinforcing their troops opposite Aoun's lines
in Beirut, the central mountains and northern Lebanon.
   One source said, ``Syrian trucks were observed early in the day
bringing in troops and ammunition to positions facing Aoun's lines.''
   He said Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party and Palestinian guerrilla groups from Col. Saeed Mousa's
Fatah-Uprising, bankrolled by Syria, also sent reinforcements to
their positions in the wooded mountains southeast of Beirut.
   The buildup began after a seven-hour meeting in Damascus of the
heads of virtually all Lebanon's fractious Moslem groups.
   The Syrians summoned their Moslem and leftist Lebanese militia
leaders to Damascus for a council of war in what appeared to be a
move to escalate the campaign against the Christians.
   The leaders of 16 factions, including Iranian-backed Shiite
groups and radical Palestinian guerrillas, attended. They issued a
statement late Tuesday saying they would close ranks to bring down
Aoun.
   ``The solution must be on the basis of ending the Israeli
occupation, and blowing up the sectarian regime from its roots,'' it
said. ``But to bring down Aoun is the priority, as well as blowing
up all the imaginary red lines.''
   The border of the Christian enclave is often referred to as a
``red line'' that would provoke international intervention if
crossed by Syrian forces because it would represent a major
escalation in the fighting.
   Syria has used its militia allies to do most of the ground
fighting while Syrian artillery and armor provide support, giving
Damascus room for diplomatic maneuvering.
   International pressure was building for a cease-fire.
   Pope John Paul II said Tuesday from Castelgondolfo, Italy: ``In
the name of God, I turn to the Syrian authorities, asking them to
stop the bombardment that aims to destroy ... the whole country.''
   Perez de Cuellar called the emergency U.N. meeting when none of
the Security Council's 15 member nations acted.
   The U.N. charter allows the secretary-general to call such
meetings when international security appears in serious danger.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Black Journalists
gave its ``Thumbs Down Awards'' for negative portrayals of blacks to
NBC News and syndicated columnist Patrick Buchanan.
   The NABJ objected to what it said was the derisive tone and
terminology used by NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw and reporter Robert
Hager in a 1988 obituary on Max Robinson, the first black network TV
anchorman and a founder of NABJ. Robinson died of AIDS.
   In a letter to the network, two NABJ officials said Brokaw's
introduction ``insinuated that Mr. Robinson contracted AIDS in a
decadent, shameful fashion, though there were no facts reported to
support that presumption.''
   ``We reviewed our piece on Max Robinson and we remain convinced
that it was fair and objective,'' said Peggy Hubble, speaking for
NBC News.
   Buchanan got the dubious designation in the print category for a
May 8 column calling for a coalition ``to liberate black America
from a worse enemy than the Klan ever was, the black criminal.''
   Buchanan wrote that ``if a young black, or young white male,
sidles up to ask directions, and one of the two is a robber, rapist
or killer, the odds are at least 11-to-1 that it is the black male.''
   Lisa Dallos, a spokeswoman for Buchanan, said Tuesday that she
would try to relay the news to him, but he had not commented by
today.
   The Thumbs Down awards were issued Tuesday and NABJ was notifying
recipients by letter.
   ``Mr. Buchanan uses too broad a brush to stereotype all black
men,'' said Gayle Pollard of the Los Angeles Times, NABJ vice
president for print.
   ``Crime is not a function of race; it is a function of economic
advantage or disadvantage,'' said NABJ president DeWayne Wickham of
the Gannett News Service. He said such depictions ``serve to fuel
the engines of racism in this country.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle said today a new poll
shows ``I'm off to a very good start,'' even though it found that
more than half the people surveyed thought he isn't qualified to be
president.
   The Washington Post-ABC News poll found nearly a 2-1 approval
ratio for the way Quayle is handling the vice presidency. However,
52 percent of those questioned said he wasn't qualified to take over
the presidency.
   ``I am very delighted to see that by a ratio of 2-1 Americans
think I am doing a good job as vice president,'' Quayle said today
at a photo session. ``I feel I'm off to a very good start.''
   Asked how he explained the 52 percent figure, Quayle said, ``I
tend to accentuate the positive and I have a very positive ratio of
support with the American people of 2-1 on how I am doing the job.
They approve of the way I am doing the job. That's good news for
me.''
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the
poll's findings. ``We think the public does have confidence in the
vice president,'' he told reporters en route to Miami with President
Bush.
   Fitzwater said Bush ``thinks the vice president is doing an
excellent job; he has outstanding qualities in many areas.'' Asked
whether he had faith in public opinion polls, the spokesman said:
``I never believe in the bad ones.''
   Quayle talked about the poll as he posed for pictures with Han
Xu, who is returning to Beijing after serving as ambassador to the
United States.
   Quayle called it a ``final courtesy call'' and said the two would
have ``a frank discussion.''
   ``Clearly I will be giving him messages that he can take back to
his government,'' the vice president said.
   David Beckwith, the vice president's press secretary, said Quayle
raised concerns about human rights and ``what China will have to do
to improve its relations with the United States'' in the aftermath
of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy forces.
   The poll on Quayle's performance was conducted by telephone with
1,022 people Aug. 4-8, about a year after George Bush selected
Quayle as his running mate. It showed little change from earlier
polls that indicated a widespread lack of confidence in Quayle's
qualifications to take over the government in an emergency.
   Fifty-two percent said Quayle wouldn't be qualified to take over
as president. Thirty-eight percent said Quayle is qualified to be
president and the rest offered no opinion.
   Forty-three percent said Bush should seect another running mate
if he runs for re-election.
   But the respondents had less trouble with Quayle in his current
job: 43 percent approved of the way he's handling the vice
presidency, 22 percent disapproved and 34 percent said they didn't
know.
   The results were similar to national polls taken last spring that
showed slightly more than half of those responding said Quayle was
not qualified to be president.
   Quayle told the Post that his continued poor showing in polls is
a result of last year's campaign in which Democrats attacked him as
unprepared to step into the Oval Office.
   ``I don't think people have the knowledge and information about
me they do about the president,'' Quayle said.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said Bush was unconcerned
with such poll results.
   ``The president likes the job he is doing,'' Sununu said.
   The results were sharply different for party members. Two-thirds
of those who said they were Republicans approved of the job Quayle
is doing, while only a third of the Democrats approved.
   The poll found 43 percent believe Bush made a mistake in
selecting Quayle, while 47 percent said it was not a mistake and the
rest had no opinion.
   The survey has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

   Currently, with their numbers unlisted and their entrances

   Drought has struck wide areas of China _ from
southwestern Sichuan province to the northern cities of Beijing and
Tianjin _ endangering crops and supplies of drinking water, official
reports said Wednesday.
   The droughts in northern China, stretching as far west as
Xinjiang province, have parched 27.84 million acres of land and
affected water supplies for more than 6 million people, the People's
Daily newspaper said.
   Millions of workers have been recruited to help save crops in
those regions affected by lower-than-average rainfall, it said.
   In northeasternmost Heilongjiang province, more than 40 percent
of the province's grain and soybean crops, about 5.75 million acres,
have been affected, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   Average rainfall for parts of the province in August has been
about 80 percent below normal, it said.

   Speakers at a civil rights convention today
stressed the need for black participation in both the Republican and
Democratic parties and urged voters to watch for persecution of
black elected officials.
   ``We don't want our folks singled out,'' said Spiver Gordon, a
commissioner in Greene County, Ala., said at the annual convention
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. ``We are concerned
where there seems to be a special effort to prosecute
African-American elected officials.''
   Gordon, a national SCLC board member, was convicted of vote fraud
in a Justice Department probe of election irregularities in Alabama,
but the conviction was overturned on appeal. Gordon had contended he
was the victim of selective prosecution based on race, a charge
denied by the Justice Department.
   Emmanuel Cleaver, vice mayor of Kansas City, Mo., noted the
absence of Republican National Committee chairman Lee Atwater after
the Bush administration's apparent courtship of black voters with
Tuesday's appearance of Vice President Dan Quayle. Atwater had been
scheduled to appear.
   ``The Republican Party just has not offered the kind of
sensitivity needed if we are going to participate,'' Cleaver said.
   At the same time, Cleaver cautioned Democrats not to assume
blacks are satisfied with the party. ``We have been bludgeoned
politically by Democrats,'' he said. He added it will be
``infinitely easier'' for blacks to progress in both parties.
   Civil rights leaders have been meeting with the Bush
administration over what they say is a trend toward overturning
civil rights victories with Supreme Court rulings.
   The group has said it intends to decide a course of action for
``reversing the assault on affirmative action and minority set-aside
programs.'' The theme for this year's conference is ``Rebirth of
Hope In The Struggle.''
   Quayle on Tuesday told participants that recent Supreme Court
rulings against affirmative action and minority set-asides do not
reflect Bush's attitude toward their cause.
   The crowd of about 500 board members and staffers applauded him
enthusiastically at times and seemed cool at others. Quayle said
afterward he had ``no expectations going in there'' but felt good
about the response.
   ``I know there are concerns among you,'' Quayle said. ``We will
make America open and make America equal for all.
   ``We may differ from time to time as to the course this nation
must travel, but we do not differ on the ultimate destination.''
   Later, Quayle declined to comment on what those differences were.
Civil rights leaders have said they are focusing upon the Bush
administration's actions, not its words.
   In introducing Quayle, SCLC President Joseph Lowery urged Bush to
``put some music'' behind the discussions.
   ``Let me take this opportunity to provide some music,'' Quayle
said. ``This president has, in fact, gone beyond the rhetoric. ...
Yes, we can do better and yes, we will do better.
   ``This is not rhetoric. This is not politics. This, my friends,
is the right thing to do.''
   Quayle referred to last week's appointment of Gen. Colin Powell
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and said the SCLC ``can
rest assured we will not be deterred'' in reaching out to appoint
blacks in the administration.
   ``I feel confident we can work together and build an America we
all envision,'' Quayle said.``There is no place for the Klan,
neo-Nazis, skinheads or any other racist group in our country.''
   ``I was surprised to hear about some of the things he knew about
the movement,'' Lowery had said after a recent meeting with Quayle.
``He was tossing out names and places and asking a lot of
questions.''
   Lowery was one of the few civil rights leaders to support the
Bush administration's failed nomination of William Lucas as the
nation's top civil rights enforcer. Others had charged that the
black Republican lacked experience.
   The nomination was killed two weeks ago in the Senate Judiciary
Committee; Bush subsequently appointed Lucas to another position in
the Justice Department that didn't require Senate confirmation.
   The convention, which runs through Friday, is being held in
Atlanta for the first time since Lowery took over the leadership in
1977.
   Martin Luther King Jr., with Lowery and the Revs. Ralph Abernathy
and Fred Shuttlesworth, founded the SCLC in 1957 in Montgomery,
Ala., to carry on the movement started with bus boycotts in that
city.
   It has long been considered the grass-roots arm of the movement,
working on issues such as homelessness, unemployment and economic
empowerment.

   A man protesting the taxation of Japan's new emperor
fired a pistol shot and briefly barricaded himself inside a tax

   The man, who identified himself as Kazuyoshi Fududa, a platoon

shouted, ``Taxing the imperial family is not forgivable!'' and fired
one shot, police said. Nobody was hurt.
   Fududa, 31, forced his way to a second-floor room and barricaded
himself in with office furniture before surrendering to police about
40 minutes later, police officials said.
   Investigators were questioning him, they said.
   Emperor Akihito has paid an inheritance tax of $3.06 million on
$12.9 million in personal wealth inherited from his father,
Hirohito, who died in January.
   Rightist groups in Japan have expressed opposition to taxing the

   Time has erased most of the scars
left along the Mississippi Gulf beachfronts by Hurricane Camille,
but for survivors the horrors of the 1969 killer are as vivid as
yesterday.
   ``We live with the memory of Camille,'' said Civil Defense
Director Wade Guice. ``There's another Camille out there somewhere
and I just pray it doesn't come in here.''
   The most powerful storm in U.S. history, Camille danced along the
coast for days before roaring ashore in Mississippi the night of
Aug. 17, 1969. Camille's 200 mph winds smashed everything in its
path and it unleashed a wall of water as high as 30 feet.
   Two hundred forty-eight people died, including 141 in Mississippi.
   Structures that had withstood major hurricanes of the past,
including Betsy in 1965, vanished under Camille's tidal wave. Large
ships were tossed onto dry land, with a 200-foot barge coming to
rest across what was left of U.S. 90, at the time the major traffic
artery along the coast.
   ``I flew down there the next morning and it was incredible,''
recalled U.S. Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss. ``I had seen
total destruction in battle zones in Europe and in Vietnam, but
nothing like this.''
   ``There were no cars, no people moving. It was very
frightening,'' he said.
   In the weeks following Camille, National Guardsmen patrolled
streets to prevent looting. Volunteers from across the country
arrived to help remove debris and provide food and shelter for
hundreds of homeless.
   Losses from the storm, which also caused extensive damage along
coastal Louisiana and Alabama and spawned scores of tornadoes
inland, was placed at $1.5 billion, with most of the loss coming in
Mississippi, Guice said.
   Camille destroyed 6,744 homes and damaged 46,709 more, while
destroying or damaging 746 businesses.
   Harbor facilities have been rebuilt and the sand beach reclaimed
over the years, but there are reminders _ driveways leading to empty
lots, twisted, aging trees and even a souvenir shop built next to a
shrimp boat that rests near where it was blown ashore.
   ``When a hurricane gets in the Gulf you see people looking out
over the Mississippi Sound, wondering if another Camille is
coming,'' said George Byrd, harbor master at the Gulfport small
craft harbor. ``Before that storm people always felt things wouldn't
be as bad as the weather people were predicting. Well, Camille
changed all that.''
   The storm left another calling card for shrimpers along the coast
as receding waters sucked debris back into the Gulf.
   ``There were lots of shrimp out here after Camille but you
couldn't drag but about 10 minutes before you would have to pull the
nets in to clean out the referigerators, car batteries, pilings and
things like that,'' said Mike Sevel, who as a 16-year-old at the
time worked with his father aboard their shrimp boat.
   ``We even had `zippers' on our nets so they could be opened
quickly to dump the debris.''
   Jacqueline Hines and her husband had ridden out hurricanes for
more than 50 years and saw no reason to abandon their beachfront
home in Gulfport despite the urging of friends and neighbors.
   Within a few hours, the two were clinging for life, 30 feet up a
television antenna, watching as gulf waters crushed their home and
covered the two-story house next door.
   ``How can one forget a night like that?'' asked Mrs. Hines, 79.
``Everything we had, things that can never be replaced, are gone
forever.''
   Mrs. Hines recalls the violent wind that pinned her head back for
hours, the blinding flashes of lightning in a night with no stars or
street lights, and the hours she hung onto her unconscious husband
in a sea of debris.
   The two, suffering broken ribs and other injuries, were rescued
the next morning.
   ``There are so many stories of horror from that storm,'' said
Guice, who has headed Harrison County's emergency agency for 28
years. ``There was the apartment complex where at least 24 people
drowned during a hurricane party and an Episcopal Church built in
1849 where 13 members of one family died.''
   ``I keep thinking about the loss of life, if only those people
had responded to our evacuation call.''

<HEAD>Government Reports More Evidence of `Soft Landing'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial production rose for the first time
in three months in July while housing starts continued to rebound,
the government said Wednesday in reports seen as further evidence a
recession will be avoided this year.
   The Federal Reserve said its industrial production index last
month stood at 141.7 percent of its 1977 base, compared with 141.4
percent in June.
   The 0.2 percent increase in July followed consecutive declines of
0.1 percent in May and June. Overall production was up 2.7 percent
over a year ago.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said housing starts
rose 0.8 percent in July after posting declines for four consecutive
months through May. They started to rebound with an 8.5 percent
increase in June.
   At the same time, the Fed reported that the factory operating
rate remained steady at 83.6 percent in July, continuing to ease
inflationary pressures.
   ``It's consistent with the soft-landing scenario, modest growth
without tipping into a recession,'' Thomas Holloway, senior
economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said of
the reports.
   David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said that several months of stagnant production at
manufacturing plants had been causing fears of a recession.
   But Wednesday's report ``indicates that manufacturing may have
bottomed out and we're seeing some moderate strength that should
help with the soft-landing scenario,'' he said.
   The Fed has been walking a fine line between keeping interest
rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures without slowing
growth so much that the economy slides into a recession. It began
letting rates drop in June as inflation seemed to lessen.
   ``The July gain mainly reflected a rebound in the output of total
materials as well as continued strength in business equipment
excluding motor vehicles,'' the central bank said Wednesday in
releasing the industrial production report.
   ``In contrast, automobile and truck production fell sharply, and
output of construction supplies, on balance, remained weak,'' it
said.
   Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and
non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent after remaining flat in May and
June. That was a 3.3 percent increase from July 1988.
   Output at mines and oil wells rose 0.3 percent following a
revised 1.1 percent decline in June caused in part by a coal strike.
The July output was 3.5 percent lower than a year ago.
   Production at utilities, reflecting increased use of air
conditioning, rose 0.8 percent in July, following a 1.3 percent
decline in June. Utility production was up 1.2 percent from July
1988.
   William D. Kelleher, manager of the Community Resources Section
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said he was encouraged by the
housing report.
   ``This month's rebound in housing starts shows that the country's
economic expansion is continuing,'' he said.
   The July level of construction totaled 1.43 million units at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 1.41 million in June.
   Single-family construction rose 6.3 percent last month while
apartment starts fell 1.2 percent. Analysts said the multifamily
drop was a natural falloff from an unusually steep 32.9 percent
increase in June.
   The operating rate at the nation's factories remained at 83.6
percent last month after declining 0.3 percentage point in June, the
Fed reported. The rate hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent last
December. Last month's operating rate was down from 83.7 percent a
year earlier.
   The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the
greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading
to shortages and price increases. Analysts generally consider an
operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of
inflationary pressures.
   The operating rate at manufacturing plants slipped 0.1 percentage
point to 83.9 percent, down from June's 84 percent. That rate had
peaked at 84.7 percent in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods, big-ticket items
expected to last more than three years, edged down 0.3 percentage
point from 82.6 percent in June. The rate at factories producing
non-durable goods rose to 86.2 percent, compared with 86.1 percent
in June.

<HEAD>South Accuses North of Using Border for Propaganda</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government accused communist North
Korea on Wednesday of using the border for propaganda purposes by
allowing a student to return to South Korea across the Demilitarized
Zone after an illegal visit.
   Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo said, ``These provocative acts
could endanger a truce on the Korean peninsula.''
   Im Su-kyong, 20, was arrested when she crossed the border Tuesday
at the Panmunjom peace village. She had gone to North Korea six
weeks ago.
   Government officials said Miss Im was being questioned Wednesday
by the Agency for National Security Planning at a hospital. She was
taken there for a medical checkup because she recently went on a
five-day hunger strike.
   Officials said she would be released from the hospital soon into
the intelligence agency's custody. The agency has said it intends to
arrest everyone who participated in sponsoring or financing the trip.
   South Korea forbids unauthorized trips to North Korea and insists
that all dialogue on reunification be conducted through official
channels. The peninsula has been divided since 1945.
   Miss Im went to the North for an international youth festival as
a symbol of reunification and has said she returned across the
heavily guarded border to dramatize the issue. Her supporters call
her ``the flower of unification.''
   She crossed the border with the Rev. Moon Gyu-hyun, a Roman
Catholic priest who traveled to North Korea to escort her home.
   They were arrested immediately. The government has said they
would be charged with violating security laws by making unauthorized
trips to an enemy country and committing other acts against state.
   Dissidents and radical students said they would conduct a
nationwide campaign against any punishment for Miss Im and Moon.
   Newspapers and political columnists predicted the trip and its
aftermath would accelerate the deterioration of relations and lead
to another crackdown on dissent in South Korea.
   Lee, the unification minister, said North Korea ``committed an
intentional provocation'' by permitting the crossing ``through
Panmunjom despite our repeated warnings.''
   The U.S.-led United Nations Command, a signatory to the 1953
armistice agreement that ended the three-year Korean war, said a
formal protest would be filed with North Korea. The U.N. Command and
South Korea say the crossing violated the agreement.
   No peace treaty has been signed, so the nations remain
technically at war. Talks to reduce tensions have been held
sporadically, with little progress.

   Participants in a government-sponsored
conference on AIDS and minorities disrupted a morning session
Wednesday to demand discussion about women's issues and other topics
they said were getting short shrift.
   About two dozen people attending the National Conference on HIV
Infection and AIDS Among Racial and Ethnic Populations took over the
stage during the main morning event and, when the speaker finished,
commandeered the microphone.
   ``I'm not getting what I need out of this conference,'' Diana
Diana, executive director of the South Carolina AIDS Education
Network Inc., told the audience of several hundred. ``I need
information on drugs. I need information on other people's
programs.''
   Diana and others complained that women's issues _ including low
representation in drug-testing trials _ weren't being adequately
addressed and that there wasn't enough opportunity for people
actually running programs in communities to share their experiences
with each other.
   A man among the demonstrators said people like himself who have
AIDS were being shortchanged by the lack of discussion about
life-prolonging treatments that are becoming available and about
access to clinical trials in which new therapies are being tested.
   ``I'm sorry we had to act up, and I'm sorry that some of you
don't like the fact that we're acting up, but some of us are
fighting for our lives,'' he said.
   ``It's platitudes, empty rhetoric we're hearing,'' Gail Harris of
the Center for Women's Policy Studies in Washington explained after
the demonstration that, with much support from the audience,
disrupted the conference for about half an hour.
   During the interruption, a woman who had been translating into
sign language for the deaf continued signing, and often the audience
broke in with enthusiastic applause for the protesters, some of whom
are members of the activist group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power,
known as ACT UP.
   At first, some in the audience argued with the action of the
demonstrators, with one person in the audience calling the protest
``an act of incredible disrespect'' because the demonstrators began
mobilizing at the front of the room while a native American was
speaking from the podium.
   But another person in the audience rose to say:
   ``I think what they're doing is encouraging. ... There are too
many of us that have felt a lot of anger and it's about time someone
did something.''
   Another person in the audience drew hearty applause when she said:
   ``We are letting ourselves be divided _ that's not what we're
here about. We need to move on and work together.''
   The moderator of the session agreed to give the protesters five
minutes, which stretched to about 20 minutes, for individuals among
them to state their concerns.
   The four-day conference, which ends Thursday, is being sponsored
by the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Jim Brown, a spokesman for the Public Health Service, which is
part of HHS, defended the agenda for the conference.
   ``In putting together this conference, we worked with all groups
involved in the fight against AIDS ... about what should be
discussed,'' he said.
   ``The list of sessions covers the complete spectrum _ from legal
and discrimination issues to drug abuse, helping people with AIDS,
volunteerism _ the whole spectrum.''

<TEXT>
   The second test flight of
the $530 million B-2 stealth bomber was cut short today by a low
oil-pressure reading, the Air Force said.
   The radar-evading aircraft lifted off over the Mojave Desert at
7:29 a.m. for a three- to four-hour flight but returned at 8:36 a.m.
because of ``minor concerns'' with its indicators, said Air Force
spokeswoman 1st Lt. Anu Sjaardema.
   ``It was decided to land, which is a normal procedure during any
type of flight. ... The crews were never in any danger,'' she said.
``We don't even know if it's a problem yet. We're concerned with it
and will have to check it out.''
   Nevertheless, ``we did achieve some of the things we set out to
do, so we can't say it wasn't a successful flight,'' she said.
   The black, batwing bomber, whose fate in being debated in
Congress, flew with its landing gear retracted for the first time
and also flew a little faster and higher than on its maiden flight
in July, although the Air Force won't specify the speed and
altitude, she said.
   Each of the B-2's four engines ``has an accessory drive. One out
of the four drives indicated low oil pressure,'' Sjaardema said.
   Tech. Sgt. Donn Clarius said the accessory drives power the
engine turbine startup unit and hydraulic systems, but there was no
failure of the hydraulic system, which on many planes allows pilots
to operate flaps and other control surfaces.
   The flight by Northrop Corp. test pilot Bruce J. Hinds and Air
Force Col. Richard Couch came after a day of delays blamed on wind
and a long list of preflight checklist.
   During takeoff, the plane climbed gradually and looked steady as
it flew with the wind at its tail. Aircraft usually take off from
here heading west, into the wind.
   During the plane's July 17 maiden flight, Hinds and Couch flew
the B-2 nearly two hours at up to 10,000 feet. The tailless,
172-foot-long wing with bulges in the middle was described by Couch
as a ``very nimble aircraft'' and ``a lot of fun'' to fly.
   The Air Force had planned to fly the plane again after dawn
Tuesday, but the test was rescheduled.
   ``There was nothing wrong with the airplane,'' said Air Force
Col. Don Weisert, a B-2 deputy program director. ``We expected winds
to come up and we wanted to make sure we could get in a full day of
activity.''
   The bomber, the most expensive warplane in history, was given a
unique contour and built with radar-absorbing composite materials.
It is designed to carry nuclear bombs and, with the conventional
B-1, replace the aging B-52 bomber.
   Earlier this month, the House voted to put strict limitations on
production of the plane, requiring the Pentagon to come up with a
cheaper program. The Senate made a modest cut of $300 million in the
$4.7 billion President Bush is seeking.
   The government has already invested about $22.4 billion in the
B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule.

   A trail of popcorn led authorities to four
young vandals who broke into a school, trashed several rooms and
tried to take the sting out of any future punishment by stealing the
school's paddles.
   The boys splattered finger paint, tore up a bean bag chair and
scattered its contents and poured bleach, vinegar and cooking oil on
floors.
   They also spilled unpopped popcorn, and that was their undoing,
Sheriff Ted Montgomery said Tuesday.
   Montgomery said a boy at Cactus Elementary School inquired the
day before the burglary last week if there would be paddling during
the upcoming school year.
   ``He was told yes, there would be,'' the sheriff said. ``Part of
the things that were missing were all of the paddles in the school.''
   Authorities later found popcorn kernels around the home of the
boy who had popped the corporal punishment question.
   ``Apparently the youngest one had gotten cooking oil all over
him,'' the sheriff said. ``The popcorn had stuck to the youngest
one's clothes.''
   School officials had no estimate of the damage.
   The boys were turned over to their parents and the case was
referred to juvenile authorities.
   Cactus is about 50 miles north of Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle.

<TEXT>
   Mary Ann Gerlach remembers the approach of
Hurricane Camille on Aug. 17, 1969, was little more than an excuse
for a party at her Mississippi Gulf Coast apartment complex.
   After all, she had ridden out hurricanes before and ``a hurricane
party was a good time to drink and play cards under the hurricane
lamps.''
   But within hours the storm's screaming 200 mph winds and wall of
water claimed her husband and the two dozen people who had gathered
on the third floor of the apartment complex for the party Gerlach
organized.
   There were many stories of personal tragedy in Camille, including
Jacqueline Hines, who spent that night 20 years ago with her late
husband clinging for life 30 feet up their television tower in
Gulfport as giant waves reduced their home to rubble.
   Gerlach said long hours at work before the storm saved her life.
   ``I had worked the night before so we decided to take a nap in
our second-floor apartment and join the party on the third floor
later. Not going up to that party is why I'm alive today.''
   Within hours, Camille's strengthening wind had blown out their
apartment's windows and water from the nearby Mississippi Sound had
reached waist deep in their bedroom.
   ``We looked up at our ceiling and there were cracks in the walls,
you knew the third floor was fixing to come down right on top of
us,'' she said. ``We swam out of the window and I immediately got
tangled up in telephone lines.''
   Gerlach said once she had freed herself, she fought to swim away.
   ``It was during that time I heard my husband hollering, `Mary
Ann, Mary Ann,' and then I didn't hear his voice any more. I knew he
had drowned but the shock didn't register,'' she said.
   As she grabbed onto debris and fought to keep her head above
water ``I looked back and I could see the apartment house. It just
started sliding down into the water,'' she said. ``I will never
forget seeing the hurricane lamps as they were still lit and
disappearing under the water. I knew all those people inside were
gone.''
   Gerlach was rescued the next morning on a pile of debris. Her
husband's body was found in a tree-top 11 days later. Gerlach is now
serving a life sentence for murdering a later husband.
   Hines, now 79, had experienced several hurricanes during her 51
years living along the coast. She rode out a major storm in 1947 and
``I just didn't believe Camille could be any worse than that one.''
   Despite warnings from friends, the couple decided to stay to
protect their home. Within a few hours it was too late to leave.
   Water eventually poured into their home and they were swept
outside. They clung to their 60-foot television tower, inching
higher as waves broke over their heads.
   ``All around it looked like we were in mid-ocean _ the wind was
so strong I couldn't hold my head up,'' Hines said.
   The tower finally broke off, sending the couple into the water
and knocking her husband unconscious. She managed to pull him to the
roof of their house, ``which was floating like a barge at the back
of our property.''
   Hours later, the two were rescued and both were hospitalized for
broken ribs and other injuries.
   ``The first Sunday Leon was out of the hospital he went to his
Sunday school class at the First Methodist Church in Gulfport, and
the class sang the hymn `Lord Plant My Feet on Higher Ground' and
dedicated it to him.''

<TEXT>
   Californians want a bigger say in who
becomes president of the United States and strongly support
advancing the date of the state's primary, a poll found.
   A California Poll released Tuesday found that residents favor
moving up the primary, now scheduled in June, unless the move costs
a lot of money.
   Democrats and Republicans alike favor the proposal by 61 percent
to 21 percent, according to the poll.
   But the estimated $40 million added expenses was a definite
turn-off, with only 14 percent backing such a plan when the estimate
was included.
   The last time California voters cast decisive votes in a
presidential bid was in 1972, when George McGovern beat Hubert
Humphrey in the California primary to grab the Demoratic nomination.
   Measures have been introduced in the Legislature to move the
primary to February, March or April.
   ``It would create at the top of the calendar an instant winnowing
device for both parties and establish early on who are credible
national candidates,'' said Michael McCurry, a spokesman for the
Democratic National Committee.
   Those who dislike the current primary system say the state has
virtually no voice in selection of presidential nominees, even
though it sends the largest groups of delegates to party conventions.
   The California Poll was based on interviews with 754 registered
voters and was conducted by telephone from July 12 to July 23. The
results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percent.

   A man helping move a piano was killed
when he fell from the back of a pickup truck and the piano fell out
and landed on his head, police said.
   Tommy Gaddis, 43, was pronounced dead at the scene Tuesday,
police Capt. Wyatt Gantt said.
   He said Gaddis was sitting in the back of the truck holding the
piano when the truck backed over a curb, the piano shifted, and
Gaddis and the piano fell.
   Gaddis and three friends were helping move the upright piano from
a church to the home of Sarah Davis, who had bought it for $75 so
her grandchildren could take piano lessons. Hours after the
accident, the black piano stood at the curb of Mrs. Davis' house.
   ``I called Goodwill,'' Mrs. Davis said. ``They're going to come
get it in the morning. I can't have that thing in my house.''

   President Bush today ruled out normalization of U.S.
relations with Cuba unless President Fidel Castro installs ``more
freedom for his own people.''
   In remarks at a fund-raiser on behalf of Republican congressional
candidate Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in a city long a magnet for Cuban
emigres, Bush said he will look for indications that Castro will
follow the moves toward openness now exhibited by his Soviet-bloc
allies.
   ``Someday I'd like to see improved _ yes, normalized _ relations
with Cuba. But that cannot and it will not be as long as Castro
violates the human rights of his own people; as long as he, almost
alone in the entire world now, swims against the tide that is
bringing sweeping change, democracy and freedom to closed societies
around the world,'' he said.
   ``As president, I will look for signs that Castro wants to move
away from subverting his neighbors, move toward more openness, more
freedom for his own people. But until I see demonstrable change
there will be no improvement in relations with Cuba,'' Bush declared
to warm applause. ``It simply cannot be.''
   The United States severed relations with Cuba in 1961. The two
nations currently are represented in each other's capital by
``interest sections'' rather than full-fledged embassies.
   The president embarked on a three-week Maine vacation today by
taking a roundabout route from Washington to boost Ros-Lehtinen's
bid to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper in a House
district that includes many Cuban-Americans and other Hispanics.
   The Cuban-born candidate's campaign manager is Bush's son, Jeb.
   Bush's trip to Miami comes amid a bitter debate over Justice
Department efforts to deport an anti-Castro Cuban militant, Dr.
Orlando Bosch. The Justice Department says secret U.S. intelligence
information implicates Bosch in bombings and assassination attempts
during Castro's 30-year rule of Cuba.
   Bosch's supporters, including Ros-Lehtinen, view him as a hero in
the battle against Castro. Ros-Lehtinen said she planned to ask the
president to overrule the deportation order, and Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla., has requested a meeting with Bush on the matter.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, however, that
the president could not address the case. ``It's a matter before the
legal system and we can't comment on it,'' he said.
   Bush called Ros-Lehtinen ``the kind of uncompromising,
experienced crime-fighter we need in Washington right now.''
   And, in a district whose ethnic voting population is critical to
campaign strategies, Bush said that Ros-Lehtinen has ``an increased
sensitivity to the problems of all oppressed minorities, wherever
they may be.''
   He recounted a story about her grandfather who helped smuggle
Jewish refugees out of Cuba ``wehn Castro's tyranny crushed freedom
on the island.''
   The president was campaigning for the 37-year-old educator as the
GOP eyed what it considers a golden opportunity to add to its 10-8
majority in Florida's congressional delegation.
   Pepper held the seat for the Democrats from its inception until
his death 27 years later, May 30 at age 88.
   Ros-Lehtinen will face Gerald Richman, who won the Democratic
nomination in a heated runoff Tuesday night, in the Aug. 29 election.
   Bush was to travel to Kennebunkport, Maine, later today to spend
the next 20 days at his family compound by the sea. Bush's staff
said the Maine trip would be mostly recreational, with Bush's family
and friends on hand.
   First lady Barbara Bush has spent most of the month there.
   However, Bush is expecting visits from Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney and Danish Prime Minister Poul Schluter.
   The athletic president has spent past trips to Kennebunkport in a
whirl of golf, tennis, jogging, swimming, boating, fishing and
restaurant-hopping.
   The Florida race is one of several House special elections this
year in which the Democrats and Republicans are sparring heatedly.
Republicans hope to improve their standing of 175 members to 255 for
the Democrats, with five vacancies.
   The most recent vacancies were created by the deaths of Texas
Democrat Mickey Leland and Mississippi Republican Larkin Smith. They
died in separate plane crashes.
   Ros-Lehtinen, whose resignation after seven years as a state
legislator is effective Aug. 29, won the four-way race for GOP
nomination with 83 percent of the vote.
   The Democratic runoff was charged with ethnic innuendo.
   Richman, a lawyer, said repeatedly that the seat is ``an American
seat.'' His opponent was Cuban-born Rosario Kennedy, who came to the
United States when she was 14.

   The Internal Revenue Service says a tax notice
sent to a 5-year-old boy wasn't really a bill for $48,000 and it
won't seize his toys.
   The agency apologized Monday to Vickie Crowley and her son,
Dustin, but said a closer reading of the notice would have clarified
the situation. Crowley's lawyer said she couldn't understand the
IRS' letter, either.
   Dustin was worried about the feds' threat to take his property,
which consists of a Big Wheel bike and various toys.
   ``They gave me a release of levy,'' Crowley said after talking to
the IRS Monday. ``That releases Dustin of any levy, and he said they
won't come and get his Big Wheel.''
   IRS spokesman Jan Hadley said Dustin received a bill, but not for
$48,000.
   She said the IRS is trying to collect back taxes from a business
that has gone bankrupt. Hadley declined to give the company's name,
but said that part of the effort to collect involves the IRS sending
bills to people who are shown on the company's records as owing it
money.
   Dustin got the letter, she said, because the IRS goofed.
   ``We tried to send the letters out to parents, and in this
particular case we were unable to figure out who was the parent or
the child,'' she said.
   ``But I can assure you that Dustin is not responsible, and if you
read the letter, it says that.''
   Crowley said she had never heard of the company that supposedly
counted the Crowleys as creditors.

   More than a century after Chief Red
Cloud refused to sign a treaty allowing a road through Indian
territory, the Pine Ridge Reservation is getting a stoplight.
   ``The Pine Ridge Reservation will remain the Land of Chief Red
Cloud, but it will have a stoplight,'' said G. Wayne Tapio, mayor of
Pine Ridge Village.
   Tapio said the light, to be installed at the intersection of
state Highway 407 and U.S. Highway 18, reflects progress.
   ``We are progressing and we have to grow with the flow of
traffic,'' he said.
   Pine Ridge Village is a community of 5,000 people in southwestern
South Dakota. Traffic from outlying towns increases the risk of
accidents during busy times of day, Tapio said.

<HEAD>Report: Juveniles and Adults Housed in Same Cellblock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Juveniles held at the city's House of
Correction have been put in the same cellblock as adults, and in at
least one case, in the same cell, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported
today.
   Prison officials disputed the report, which the newspaper said
was based on court records, a retired prison chaplain and a source.
   State and federal law allow juveniles who have been certified to
stand trial as adults to be housed in an institution with adults.
   But the practice may violate a Philadelphia Common Pleas Court
consent decree requiring that juveniles at the House of Correction
be kept separate from adults there, the newspaper said.
   The Inquirer said that according to prison records, one day last
month, three adults were held in a part of the cellblock that prison
officials said is for juveniles.
   The records also showed that an adult was housed in the same cell
as a juvenile who had been at the House of Correction for one day.
That adult had been charged with aggravated assault and endangering
the welfare of children.
   Prison officials said as many as 27 juveniles at a time have been
held in a wing of the adult prison over the past nine months because
of overcrowding at the city's youth detention center.
   But Maj. Thomas Costello, who oversees city juvenile facilities,
and Maj. Wilhelmina Speach, a deputy warden at the House of
Correction, told The Inquirer that adults and juveniles have not
been held in the same area.

   He was charged with possession of narcotics, possession of
narcotics with intent to sell, destruction of evidence and
possession of drug paraphernalia, Moughty said.
   The car's driver, Darryl Mayer, 47, of Stamford, was charged with
possession of drug paraphernalia, Moughty said. He was also charged
with driving without a license and given a written warning for
failure to drive right.
   Both men are due in court Aug. 23.

<HEAD>Eds: RECASTS throughout to show that shipments not at 18-year low,

<TEXT>
   Shipments of hard liquor fell last year to
the lowest point since an industry survey began in 1970, a
development attributed to Americans' new love of health and fear of
addiction.
   With only a few individual ups among the downs, sales of
distilled goods fell 4.2 percent last year, to 159 million cases in
1988 from 166 million cases in 1987, the trade publication Impact
reports in its current edition.
   Liquor sales last year were 2.5 percent below the 163 million
cases shipped in 1970, the first year Impact began its industrywide
survey. A case equals nine liters.
   Industry experts have blamed a variety of factors: growing health
consciousness, the aging of the baby boom generation and the
powerful campaigns in recent years against drunken driving and
intoxication by alcohol and drugs.
   In the late 1970s, some in the industry hoped hard liquor sales
would rise as the baby boom generation grew out of beer and wine.
Instead, distaste for drinking appears to be drying up sales of all
alcoholic beverages.
   Total wine consumption in this country dropped to 552.2 million
gallons in 1988, down 28.7 million gallons, or 4.9 percent, from the
previous year, the industry publication Wines &amp; Vines reported last
month.
   Beer sales, too, were flat, registering a negligible rise to 2.4
million cases in 1988.
   Impact blamed the decline in sales of distilled goods on ``the
cumulative effects of federal, state and local tax increases on
spirits and the continuing pressure on the entire alcoholic beverage
industry from anti-alcohol forces.''
   Studies indicate consumers drink less as they age, Impact said.
   Distillers, their profits drained by declining sales, cut total
advertising budgets last year by more than $100 million, to $240
million, Impact said.
   Makers of so-called ``white goods'' _ vodka, gin, rum and tequila
_ could toast some sales gains.
   Vodka, at 38 million cases distributed last year, was reported
the biggest-selling distilled spirit in the country, far ahead of
the 21 million cases sold in 1970. Gin ran a poor second in 1988
with 14 million cases. Rum, with 13 million cases in 1988, advanced
7 million cases over 1970.
   Whiskeys took the biggest whipping, a challenge distillers regard
as extremely grim as they look for ways to recruit new customers to
replace aging whiskey sippers. It's estimated people over 50 years
old account for half the sales of whiskeys, called ``brown goods''
in the trade.
   Sales in the whiskey segment, including bourbon, blends, Scotch,
Canadian and Irish, declined 43 million cases, to 60 million cases,
between 1970 and 1988. Bourbon was the biggest loser, dipping 19
million cases from the 36 million figure in 1970 and skidding 6.3
percent between 1987 and 1988 alone.
   The biggest loser from 1987 to 1988 was Scotch, dipping by 8.8
percent to 13 million cases.
   But even as they spurn hard liquor, drinkers demonstrate there's
still commercial value in the snob appeal of a beverage like
single-malt Scotch. The leading single-malt Scotches, Glenlivet and
Glenfiddich, advanced by 130,000 and 75,000 cases, respectively,
between 1987 and 1988.

<TEXT>
   In an ethnically tense battle to succeed the late
Rep. Claude Pepper, a lawyer won the Democratic nomination on the
theme that he's running for ``an American seat.''
   His Cuban-born Republican opponent called his victory ominous.
   The winner was Gerald Richman, a 47-year-old former Florida Bar
Association president making his first run for office. Richman
gathered much of his strength from a heavy majority of the diverse
district's white non-Hispanic voters in a 61-39 percent victory over
Rosario Kennedy.
   Richman moves on to an Aug. 29 special election against state
Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Cuban-born as is Ms. Kennedy, for the seat
left vacant by Pepper's death May 30 at age 88.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen got a strong endorsement today from President
Bush, who hastily arranged a side trip to Florida before beginning a
vacation in Maine.
   ``Ileana's dream is your dream,'' he told some 600 people at a
fund-raising luncheon. ``It's not a Republican dream or a Dade
County dream _ it's the American dream.''
   Bush emphasized Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's legislative experience and her
tough stand on crime and drugs.
   Richman called his victory a victory for the community. ``Now is
the time for Democratic unity. ... I cannot understand how being an
American can possibly be divisive.''
   He said he will represent ``all the people,'' not any one ethnic
group.
   With all of 146 precincts reporting unofficial returns, Richman
had 14,411 votes to 9,226 votes for Ms. Kennedy.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a seven-year state legislator, flew to
Washington Tuesday and flew back to Miami late this morning aboard
Air Force One with Bush, who headed a list of speakers at the
luncheon. Organizers said they raised at least $250,000 for
Ros-Lehtinen's campaign.
   ``I think the victory sends an ominous message that there are
some voters who respond to an ethnically divisive campaign,'' Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen said.
   Republicans believe they have a strong shot at adding to their
10-8 majority in Florida's congressional delegation by winning the
seat Pepper held for Democrats since its inception 27 years ago.
   Ms. Kennedy, 44, in her concession speech, called on Richman ``to
stop this divisive campaign'' and warned that an ethnic campaign
``can have Claude Pepper's seat in jeopardy.''
   She said she would meet with Richman today to discuss the general
election campaign.
   Richman said, though, that he can defeat Ms. Ros-Lehtinen on
issues such as abortion _ she's anti-abortion, he's for abortion
rights _ and that he can unify the community.
   ``She is in the right-wing, extreme element of the Republican
Party,'' said Richman.
   ``We're going to campaign by going to the people. This is a
grass-roots campaign,'' said Richman, who overcame Ms. Kennedy's
support by party leaders, the AFL-CIO and The Miami Herald.
   Richman said his theme was meant to unify Miami and to rebut
Republican national Chairman Lee Atwater's statement that it's time
to elect the first Cuban-American to Congress.
   ``He thinks that Lee Atwater is his opponent,'' Ms. Ros-Lehtinen
said. ``I condemned those words the moment they were uttered.''
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 37, said she will campaign on issues such as
crime and drugs and holding down taxes.
   ``I think voters are going to choose on issues and experience,''
she said. ``I'm certainly proud of my heritage, but I don't campaign
on that basis.''
   Ms. Kennedy carried Hispanic and black precincts Tuesday, but was
defeated 4-to-1 in predominantly ``Anglo,'' or non-Latin white,
precincts.
   Richman, Jewish and Brooklyn-born, stunned Ms. Kennedy, the
Democratic front-runner, with a late-charging, 146-vote victory in
the Aug. 1 primary, in which five other Democrats were eliminated.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, whose resignation as state legislator is
effective Aug. 29, won the four-way race for GOP nomination with 83
percent of the vote. Her campaign manager is Jeb Bush, the
president's son.
   Little difference on issues emerged between Ms. Kennedy and
Richman in their runoff, dominated by discussion of ethnic
divisiveness, qualifications and ability to defeat Ms. Ros-Lehtinen.
   Democrats are concerned that an increasing number of Hispanic
voters _ they now make up 40 to 50 percent of those registered _
will swing future elections to Republicans.
   Richman supporters said he can best energize the vote in black
neighborhoods and on Miami Beach to capitalize on the Democrats'
continued registration advantage.

   A bomb exploded at a public meeting
Wednesday where opposition leader Sheik Hasina had been speaking,
but there were no injuries, police said.
   Two men carrying explosives were arrested, said police offcials
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On Friday, assailants opened fire on Ms. Hasina's house in Dhaka
and hurled a grenade at it. There were no injuries in that attack.
   Ms. Hasina is a vocal critic of president Hussain Mohammed Ershad
and is the daughter of Bangladesh's first president, the late Sheik
Mujibur Rahman.
   Rahman, his wife, three of his children and three other family
members were killed in a military coup Aug. 15, 1975. Ms. Hasina was
out of the country at the time.
   Farooqur Rahman, one of the leaders of the coup, leads the
Freedom Party. Since the 1975 coup, Bangladesh has had eight
presidents, all of whom were installed through military intervention.
   Ershad, an army general, seized power in 1982. He resigned in
1986 and then won the presidency in elections that Ms. Hasina and
other opposition leaders call fraudulent.
   Wednesday's blast came soon after Ms. Hasina finished speaking at
an outdoor public meeting organized in the capital by her Awami
League party. The explosion occurred about 200 yards from speaker's
podium, witnesses said.

   The jury in the 6-month-old ``Night Stalker''
murder trial resumed deliberations today after the foreman reported
that panel had ``put behind them'' the slaying of a juror and the
suicide of her boyfriend.
   The ``Night Stalker'' defendant, Richard Ramirez, a drifter
charged with 13 murders, shouted out an objection and an obscenity
when the judge indicated he would allow the panel to return to its
task with an alternate member.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan ignored Ramirez's comment and
rejected a defense request for at least a week's delay in
deliberations to allow jurors to recover from their grief. There was
no request for mistrial.
   Earlier, the judge called into the courtroom the jury foreman and
asked whether jurors were able to proceed in light of the slaying of
Phyllis Singletary by her boyfriend.
   ``I feel it's somewhat tranquil,'' said the foreman, Felipe
Rodriguez. ``Everyone appears to have put it behind them.''
   The judge then summoned all of the jurors and told them: ``We
must get on with the task that life has given us. No matter how
deepl.
   The alternate who was chosen to replace Ms. Singletary appeared
upset when her name was called and sat trembling in her chair rather
than moving into the jury box.
   Tynan said he understood the jury's emotions: ``I think we have
all been terribly affected.''
   But he said the killing was unrelated to the Ramirez case and
expressed the hope that panelists could complete their job.
   ``I do not mean to be callous,'' he said, ``but we have business
to do.''
   The judge said he would allow jurors to attend Ms. Singletary's
funeral arrangements if the services are in Los Angeles. Ms.
Singletary, a Pacific Bell employee, is originally from El Paso,
Texas, where her family lives.

<HEAD>Budapest Mayor OKs Tents for East German Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities gave permission Wednesday
for a tent community to shelter hundreds of East Germans seeking to
emigrate to the West, while the international dispute surrounding
them escalated.
   East Germany told a West German official that activities by
Bonn's embassy in Budapest violate international law.
   Bonn government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling said the East
German Foreign Ministry called in Franz Bertele, the head of West
Germany's Permanent Representation, to lodge the protest.
Schmuelling said it was rejected by Bertele.
   The tents approved by Hungarian authorities are intended for use
by some of the hundreds of East Germans who left their makeshift
camp outside the West German consulate Tuesday and moved to a nearby
Roman Catholic Church.
   A crush of passport and asylum requests by East Germans has
overwhelmed West German diplomats in this city and East Berlin. The
embassy and consulate were closed in Budapest Monday, and the West
German mission shut down in East Berlin on Aug. 8.
   Csilla von Boeselager, president of the Hungarian Maltese Caritas
humanitarian group, said about 20 military tents would be set up
Thursday on a campground in a working-class district in the Pest
part of Budapest.
   The tents, sent with cots by the West German Red Cross, can
shelter up to 350 people, the state news agency MTI said.
   Some East Germans began round-the-clock vigils outside the
consulate last month in hopes of getting help to emigrate to West
Germany. Most have now illegally overstayed their visas to visit
Hungary.
   Bonn government officials said Monday that 141 adults and 40
children remained holed up inside the West German Embassy despite
the closure to the public. They have demanded asylum in the compound.
   Hundreds more East Germans are reported to have gone underground
rather than return to their Communist homeland. Some refugees say
they fear persecution if they go home, and others say they seek a
better life in the West.
   East Germany and Hungary are allies in the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact. Hungarian officials have privately acknowledged that East
German attempts to use Hungary as a springboard to the West are
leading to tensions between their country and East Germany.
   Officially, Hungary insists the affair is strictly between Bonn
and Berlin. But a West German diplomat said Wednesday the Hungarians
are doing what they can to help the East Germans' efforts to
emigrate.
   ``The tent city OK comes officially from the mayor of Budapest,
but it's clear that the (Hungarian) interior and foreign ministries
were consulted,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The estimated 300 East Germans who left the consulate crowded the
lawns of a Roman Catholic church Tuesday evening, but Mrs.
Boeselager said Hungarian families took in two thirds of them
Wednesday.
   On Wednesday, many of those remaining at the church lined up at
folding wooden tables as Hungarian Red Cross volunteers doled out
peas and pork. Some refugees ate sitting on the lawn, while others
filled out questionnaires given them by West German diplomats.
   The refugees say the diplomats have been processing requests and
handing out passports on church grounds.
   Several East Germans say they will stay in Hungary as long as it
takes to gain passage to the West.
   ``People at home are so bitter about the stagnation there,'' said
a 30-year old woman while her two boys, aged 6 and 3, crouched at
her feet eating their food. ``We'll do anything to make it over the
border.''
   The wave of refugees developed in Hungary after its liberal
communist authorities removed border fences with Austria in May.
Hungarian border guards, however, have not let East Germans pass
with papers obtained in Budapest.

   Whitney, wife of businessman and horsebreeder C.V. Whitney,
cracked a rib, blackened an eye and opened a gash on her forehead
that required 13 stitches when she fell while dancing Friday during
the annual ``Evening in Old Saratoga'' ball.
   Whitney was taken to Saratoga Hospital, where she seemed more
concerned about the blood on her yellow and turquoise taffeta Arnold
Scaasi gown than with her injuries. Renee Walsh, a friend from
Chicago, was dispatched to a convenience store while still in her
ball gown to buy seltzer water as an aid to removing the blood.
   ``We had our priorities straight,'' Whitney said, back in action
Sunday night at another gala event. ``Take care of the dress first,
then dress my head.''
   Craig Foster, a New York City plastic surgeon and Whitney friend,
will check the gash in three to four months to see if plastic
surgery is necessary. In the meantime, Whitney said she's going on
safari.
   ``It's much more dangerous to go to an evening in Saratoga than
it is to go off on safari and sleep in a tent with wild animals all
around you,'' she said.

   Two-time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond,
who was shot in the abdomen in a hunting accident in between his
1986 and 1989 cycling wins, has sold film rights to his dramatic
come-back story.
   Nobody is talking about how much money the 28-year-old cyclist
got paid.
   ``That's something they don't talk about, at least they don't
share that information with me,'' said Doug Duitsman, a vice
president for Warner Bros. Televison said Wednesday by telephone
from Burbank, Calif.
   Lawrence Lyttle, an independent producer who will make the movie
for Warner Bros., said Tuesday that filming is expected to start
next spring. The story of the Reno native is intended for broadcast
during the 1990-91 television season.
   LeMond's story also will be told in an authorized biography to be
published by Warner Books, Duitsman said.

   Another bump is in the path of Pete Rose, the
Cincinnati Reds manager already under fire over allegations he
gambled on baseball.
   Rose and umpire Joe West shoved each other after the manager came
to the defense of second baseman Ron Oester, who also exchanged
bumps with West. It was the second time in 13 months that Rose has
bumped an umpire.
   The argument Tuesday night came during the Reds' 5-2 loss to the
Chicago Cubs. It started over a call by the plate umpire.
   Rose is under investigation by Baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett
Giamatti for allegedly betting on Reds game. A federal court order
prevents Giamatti from conducting a disciplinary hearing on the
charges.
   National League President Bill White will review the bumping as a
separate matter and will not take into account the gambling probe,
spokeswoman Katy Feeney said Wednesday.
   White is gathering reports from the umpires and will review any
available videotapes, she said.
   Last season, Rose was suspended for 30 days and fined $10,000 by
then-NL President Giamatti for bumping umpire Dave Pallone.
   ``You saw what they did when I pushed Pallone last year,'' Rose
said. ``Let's see what happens now.''
   ``We have no comment, nothing to say,'' said Jerry Crawford,
chief of the umpire crew.

<HEAD>Utility Chief Says Nuclear Managers Ignored Warning of Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of a Maryland nuclear plant that has
been called one of the nation's worst ignored warnings as long ago
as three years that complacency was jeopardizing safety, the owner's
chief executive told federal regulators Wednesday.
   George McGowan, chairman of Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., said he
had told supervisors at the Calvert Cliffs plant on Chesapeake Bay
that he saw ``a slippage setting in'' that threatened the plant's
reputation for efficiency and safety.
   ``I'm not so sure they believed what I had to say,'' McGowan told
members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which last December
declared Calvert Cliffs one of the worst-run plants in the country
and stepped up monitoring of its operations.
   The commissioners called in McGowan and the utility's other top
officers to explain how Calvert Cliffs had fallen to the bottom of
the performance pile after long being touted as one of the best-run
and most efficient plants in the nation.
   The plant's sudden fall from grace has raised new questions about
the NRC's ability to detect drops in plant performance levels before
serious accidents occur.
   Both of Calvert Cliffs' nuclear reactors were shut down last May
because of mechanical problems. A series of earlier mishaps at the
plant culminated in the accidental death last September of an
employee who drowned in a water storage tank.
   ``We recognize we have problems _ major problems,'' McGowan told
the commissioners. ``The current state of affairs disturbs me
deeply.''
   He and other utility officials said they were working on a broad
strategy for improving operations, including methods of ensuring
stricter adherence to safety procedures and strengthening plant
management.

   The Chicago-born O'Malley began his lifetime commitment with the
choir in 1912 as a singer. He became director in 1928. Under his
leadership the choir traveled around the country and performed at
the White House.
   It disbanded due to O'Malley's advancing age and retirement, a

   Israel has made clear it does not want to
intervene in Lebanon, but is quietly reminding the Syrians of limits
to how far they can expand their battle with the Christians without
risking retaliation.
   The warnings have been contained in hints by some officials and
repeated public statements calling for worldwide pressure on Syria
to stop the 5-month-old battle
   Uzi Landau, a legislator from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc, said Tuesday the Israelis would warn Syria
``in a quiet way'' about ``red Lines'' that cannot be crossed.
   That same day, Israel's air force sent a warning to Palestinian
guerrillas, some of whom are allied with Syria, by buzzing guerrilla
positions near Sidon in south Lebanon.
   Reporters asked Shamir on Wednesday whether Israel would put
limits on Syrian military action in Lebanon. He replied without
elaboration: ``There are red lines. The red line is the safety of
Israel.''
   Israel has long made clear that its strongest territorial defense
line is drawn at Sidon and the Awali River. The river is 25 miles
north of the border.
   The government also insists the Syrians not threaten Israeli's
freedom to fly reconnaissance over Lebanon or its ability to patrol
the southern Lebanese coast to block guerrilla attacks by sea.
   Most statements by officials have castigated the United Nations
for failing to stop or condemn Syria's bombardment of civilians in
Beirut, which Israel also shelled relentlessly during a 70-day siege
in 1982.
   ``We were sorry to see that the U.N. Security Council was not
ready to do anything of any significance,'' said Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens. ``The Syrians think they can act in this brutal manner
contrary to all the norms and laws of civilized society.''
   At a meeting called by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
the Security Council approved an appeal Tuesday night for a
cease-fire in the Syrian-Christian artillery battle that began five
months ago.
   Analysts say they believe Syria understands how far it can go,
but also pointed to changes in strategy Israel would consider a
threat.
   Mark Heller, a Middle East expert at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies, said a Syrian ground buildup could be
dangerous for Israel even if it did not encroach on south Lebanon.
   ``If they bring large formations, air defense systems are part of
these formations,'' he said, and Israel would fear that Syrian
missiles could interfere with its aerial surveillance.
   Syria now has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   Aharon Levran, a retired brigadier general and independent
military analyst, said Syrian air defense batteries could ``gnaw
away'' at Israel's freedom of action in the air.
   He also said a Syrian victory in Lebanon that upset the balance
of power might force Israel to reconsider its non-intervention
policy.
   ``If Syria ends up with the upper hand, being victorious, this
will be a drastic change in the strategic situation in Lebanon,'' he
said.
   Levran added, however, that he did not believe President Hafez
Assad of Syria would risk possible retaliation from Israel or from
Iraq, which supplies arms to the Christians.
   Assad does not want to ``annihilate'' the Christians, he said,
only to punish the Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, for
challenging his role as power broker in Lebanon.
   Aoun describes the Syrians as an occupation army and says he is
fighting a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out.
   ``What Assad really wants is Aoun's head,'' Levran said.
   He said involvement in Lebanon has kept Syria too busy to
concentrate on Israeli, and ``it's a blessing for Israel that Syria
will be bogged down deeper and deeper in the Lebanese mud.''
   Israel's unwillingness to intervene stems from its experiences in
the 1982-85 invasion and occupation of Lebanon: 650 soldiers killed,
political disunity at home and harm to Israel's image abroad.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the center-left Labor
Party, said on television Wednesday: ``Israel did not get out of
Lebanon in order to return there. ... There is a place for being
worried only if direct Israeli interests are harmed.''

<HEAD>What's Life Without a Yellow Legal Pad, Lawyers Are Wondering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The capital's army of high-priced lawyers _ at
least those not spending August playing golf somewhere _ was jolted
by an edict from local government trash collectors this week: ``Stop
using yellow legal pads.''
   The warning was intended to prepare local office workers for a
sweeping new recycling law that goes into effect in the District of
Columbia on Oct. 1, and to discourage them from producing colored
paper trash which many recycling firms don't want.
   Although yellow legal pads aren't actually banned by the new law,
the order from Joan Rohlfs, recycling coordinator for the
Metropolitan Council of Governments, sent a chill through this town
with the highest concentration of lawyers anywhere in the country _
more than 30,000 of them, or roughly one for every 22 residents.
   Does this portend the demise of the legal brief? Will there be
fewer petitions to habeas the corpus? Will those friends of the
court _ the amicus curiae _ be popping in less frequently to lend a
helpful hand?
   ``It means we'll have to use white legal pads, I guess,'' said
Michael Horn, a partner in the prestigious, 240-lawyer firm of
Covington &amp; Burling.
   Yellow legal pads are suffering a decline in popularity among
younger lawyers who prefer to use personal computers for their legal
research and note-keeping, Horn said.
   ``But us older fellows and gals are wedded to yellow legal pads,
I'm afraid,'' he said. ``My desk is littered with them right now.''
   Arthur J. Rothkopf, partner and chief spokesman for Hogan &amp;
Hartson, said the new law will mean headaches for landlords, who
must haul the trash away, but not for lawyers.
   ``We'll do things the way we always have,'' Rothkopf said.
``There'll always be yellow pads. We lawyers can't live without
them.''
   Washington lawyer Lawrence Barcella, a former assistant U.S.
attorney, predicted that his colleagues will figure a way to ``pick
at the law'' and get around it somehow, possibly by using legal pads
with a slightly different color, ``such as beige, or maybe mauve.''
   ``Lawyers charge by the pound for paper, whether it's separated
in piles for recycling or not,'' Barcella said. ``They'll still
figure out a way to make the law work for them.''
   The law, signed by Mayor Marion Barry in January, is intended to
help the District of Columbia recycle more of the 720,000 tons of
trash it generates annually. Most of the city's solid wastes are
burned in an incinerator or buried in a suburban Virginia sanitary
landfill that is expected to reach capacity in three years.
   D.C. Council member Nadine P. Winter, who sponsored the new law,
called Washington ``a paper factory'' whose paper trash amounts to
53 percent of the city's solid wastes, compared with a national
average of about 36 percent.
   Effective Oct. 1, according to Ms. Rohlfs, all paper trash _
newspapers, magazines, computer paper and office stationery _ must
be collected separately for recycling. ``Keep the newspapers
separate,'' she said. ``Keep the computer paper separate. Keep out
contaminants such as gum labels, tape and see-through envelopes. And
stop using yellow legal pads.''
   Washington lawyer Roslyn A. Mazer said crackdown on yellow legal
pads might lead to a bright future for some of her colleagues.
   ``Many lawyers are frustrated gourmet ice cream salesmen,
baseball executives or proctologists,'' she said. ``The
unavailability of the yellow legal pad will enable them to embark on
fully satisfying careers.''

<HEAD>Governing Party's Youth Wing Protests Any U.S. Bases in Singapore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party's youth wing on
Wednesday protested Singapore's proposal to allow U.S. military
bases on its territory.
   Singapore's offer, made earlier this month, was seen as a move to
encourage the Philippines to extend the lease on American bases
there. The Philippines asked other countries in the region to share
some of the burden of having U.S. bases.
   Five officials of the youth wing of Malaysia's governing United
Malays National Organization gave their note to the Singapore
diplomats at that country's embassy.
   However, the youth officials and about 20 supporters made no move
to protest at the U.S. Embassy across the street.
   The note accused Singapore of ignoring the concerns of its
neighbors. ``We know it is Singapore's sovereign right to do as she
wants, but how will she like it if Malaysia invites the Soviet Union
to site bases in this country?''
   Some members of the group said they ignored the U.S. Embassy
because the proposal came from Singapore, and Washington has not
said it would accept it.
   Malaysian leaders, including Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
also have criticized Singapore for making the proposal. If accepted,
they said, it could destabilize the region.
   Singapore diplomats declined comment on the youth group's
criticism, saying only that the note would be sent to their
government.
   The tensions stem from the opposition of many Filipinos,
including lawmakers, to extend the lease of the six American
installations there. They include the stategically important Clark
Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who is touring the Philippines, said
Singapore's offer was helpful and that Washington was also eager to
keep its bases in the Philippines.
   He said, however, if Philippine opponents of the bases win their
battle to block leasing of the bases beyond 1991, Washington will
find other host countries for them.
   ``If they come to the conclusion that it is to the best interest
of the Philippines to permit us to continue using the facilities,
then we will gladly and willingly continue to utilize them,'' he
said.
   He added that the United States would develop ``operative
facilities elsewhere'' in case the Philippines decides to close the
bases.
   Solarz, chairman of the Asian and Pacific affairs subcommittee,
arrived in Manila Wednesday with Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., and
Eni Faleomavaega, a legislator from American Samoa. He met briefly
with President Corazon Aquino but did not say what was discussed.
   Mrs. Aquino has not stated her position on extending the base
agreement.
   The Philippines and United States are expected to begin talks
this year on whether to extend the agreement despite growing
anti-American sentiment. Mrs. Aquino is expected to discuss the
issue during a visit to the United States in November.
   In October 1988, the two countries reached an agreement allowing
the bases to remain until 1991 in return for $962 million in U.S.
military and economic aid over two years. About 40,000 American
troops, civilian workers and military dependents are stationed at
the facilities.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian lawmakers Wednesday elected to the
influential post of parliament speaker a radical anti-Western cleric
who advocates the spread of the Islamic revolution.
   The selection of Hojatoleslam Mehdi Karrubi was seen as a blow to
the new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose so-called pragmatist
faction favors rebuilding relations with the West.
   Parliament has to approve all the president's Cabinet
appointments. As the overseer of the 270-seat parliament, Karrubi
could make or break legislation and curb Rafsanjani's policies.
   State-run Tehran radio monitored in Nicosia said Karrubi won 145
votes among the 243 members of the parliament, called the Majlis,
who attended the session Wednesday.
   Rafsanjani, 54, had been speaker since 1980 but gave up the post
after his election to the presidency July 28. He had pushed for
former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri to succeed him.
   During his time as speaker, Rafsanjani built the speakership into
a key role.
   Karrubi, a 51-year-old middle-ranking cleric, has been a member
of the Majlis since March 1981 and was elected deputy speaker under
Rafsanjani last year.
   He is a revolutionary hard-liner who frequently was imprisoned
for his clandestine activities during the reign of the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   He is allied with Rafsanjani's political rivals, led by the
radical interior minister, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   Karrubi also was close to the late revolutionary leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who named him head of the Martyrs'
Foundation, a vast conglomerate that controls more than 700
enterprises in Iran.
   As head of Iran's Pilgrimage Bureau, Karrubi was well-placed to
oversee covert operations in the drive to export the Islamic
revolution.
   In 1986, Iranian Revolutionary Guards posing as pilgrims tried to
smuggle explosives and weapons into Saudi Arabia during the annual
pilgrimage to Islam's holiest shrines in Mecca. Most were arrested
and deported.
   The following year, Karrubi led militant Iranian pilgrims to
Mecca, where Saudi troops were called in to quell political rioting
allegedly instigated by the Iranians. More than 400 pilgrims, most
of them Iranians, were killed.
   This year, Karrubi told demonstrators in Tehran the 1987 riots
were ``a calculated plot designed by American and Israeli advisers
to prevent the spread of the Islamic revoution to other parts of the
world.''
   Karrubi's brother, Hassan, was involved with Rafsanjani in secret
arms-for-hostages negotiations in 1985 with then-U.S. National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.
   Rafsanjani is expected to take the oath of office Thursday. He
takes over the presidency from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was
elected Iran's religious leader after Khomeini died June 3.

   The pilot of a plane carrying Rep. Larkin
Smith appeared nervous and even ran the aircraft off a taxiway
shortly before takeoff, officials investigating the fatal crash said
Wednesday.
   The Cessna 177 veered east from its anticipated flight path
before slamming into a 70-foot pine tree in the DeSoto National
Forest Sunday night. Killed were pilot Chuck Vierling, 58, and
Smith, a 45-year-old freshman Republican.
   People who saw Vierling before takeoff ``said he appeared to be
kind of nervous ... like he was concerned about the flight,'' said
Jorge Prellezo, regional director for the National Transportation
Safety Board in Miami.
   ``People at the Hattiesburg airport observed the aircraft taxing
out and said it ran off the paved (taxiway) area and into the grass,
then back onto the paved area, which is kind of strange,'' Prellezo
said in a telephone interview.
   The two were returning from Hattiesburg to their homes in
Gulfport, about 70 miles to the south. The plane wreckage was found
Monday, scattered through tall pines and dense underbrush about 14
miles south of New Augusta.
   William Dowden, an employee of Southeast Aviation, watched
Vierling's single-engine plane both during and after takeoff.
   ``He taxied straight out off the ramp area onto the grass and
when he realized what had happened, he made a 180-degree turn, then
taxied slowly out to the runway,'' Dowden said. ``The taxiways are
lit up with blue lights and what happened struck us as being highly
unusual.''
   Prellezo said there were other questions about the first minutes
of the flight, including why the pilot told controllers that he
would follow the established route along U.S. 49 but instead flew
about nine miles to the east over the DeSoto National Forest.
   ``We will look at every aspect to see why he deviated,'' Prellezo
said.
   While the investigation into the crash continues, residents of
the Mississippi Gulf Coast, where Smith once served as sheriff,
began filing by the congressman's flag-draped casket on Wednesday. A
funeral Mass was scheduled for Thursday.

<TEXT>
   New York's highest court agreed Wednesday to
hear the appeals of three white men convicted in the 1986 Howard
Beach attack, in which a black man fleeing a white gang was hit by a
car and killed.
   State Court of Appeals Judge Joseph Bellacosa, on behalf of the
full seven-member court, granted the appeals of Scott Kern, Jon
Lester and Jason Ladone.
   Kern and Lester, both 20, and Ladone, 18, were convicted in
December 1987 of second-degree manslaughter and first-degree assault
for attacking three black men in the Howard Beach section of the New
York City borough of Queens on Dec. 20, 1986.
   One of the black men, 23-year-old Michael Griffith, was struck by
a car and killed as he fled. Another man, Cedric Sandiford, was
beaten with tree limbs and a baseball bat.
   The cas is likely to reach the top court late this year or early
next year, said Court of Appeals spokesman Walter Mordaunt.
   Lester, who is in jail, was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in
prison. He also was sentenced to one to three years in prison on an
unrelated prior conviction for weapons possession.
   Kern was sentenced to a six- to 18-year term and is out on
$300,000 bail. Ladone was sentenced to five to 15 years and is out
on $150,000 bail. Both had their sentences stayed pending the appeal.
   Bellacosa granted the appeal without comment. By agreeing to hear
the case, Bellacosa feels there are questions of law that should be
decided upon by the top court, said Mordaunt.
   Helman Brook, an assistant to special state prosecutor Charles
Hynes, had no comment on Bellacosa's decision to grant the appeal.
   Charles Weintraub, lawyer for all three defendants, said he'd
base the new appeal on many of the same arguments he used
unsuccessfully before the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court.
   In July, the Appellate Division unanimously upheld the
convictions and sentences.

World War II by reminding his countrymen of the ``heavy burden'' of
their Nazi past.
   Bishop Karl Lehmann, chairman of the West German bishops
conference, also called the Nazi massacre of the Jews
``unparalleled'' in human history.
   On Sept. 1, 1939, Adolf Hitler's troops attacked Poland, touching
off the worldwide conflict that killed more than 50 million people.
During their 12-year dictatorship, the Nazis also killed an
estimated 6 million Jews.
   In his message, Lehmann said later generations are not
responsible for what happened under the Nazis.
   ``But that alone doesn't take care of the question of guilt and
its causes,'' he wrote. ``All in fact are affected by the common
heritage and must carry along this heavy burden in solidarity.''
   ``And what's more, all are responsible for what will become of
our people in the future,'' the 53-year-old bishop wrote in his
message distributed to the news media.
   He blamed the outbreak of the war on the Nazi leaders'
``megalomania,'' third thirst for power, and their ``criminal
contempt of mankind.''
   The bishop also called on West Germans to be on guard against
movements that lead to hatred. The country has been seeing
increasing support for the extreme right, which has blamed
foreigners for many of the nation's troubles.
   Lehmann also singled out the sufferings of the Jews under the
Nazis.
   ``Hitler's profound hatred of Jewish fellow human beings and of
certain minorities determined his actions,'' the bishop said. ``The
genocide of the Jews is unparalleled in human history.''
   West Germany has been the scene of a debate sparked by some
conservative historians who argue that the Nazi killings of the Jews
should be compared to other atrocities in history. Some West Germans
contend those historians are trying to diminish the horror of the
Holocaust.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Air Force plane carrying
forensic experts, medical equipment and nine coffins arrived
Wednesday to retrieve the bodies of Rep. Mickey Leland and eight
other Americans killed in a plane crash.
   Marine Lt. Col. David Titus said it probably would take five to
seven days to identify the remains. The task was under way in a
makeshift clinic at Addis Ababa's international airport.
   ``Obviously, we wouldn't want to ship an Ethiopian body back to
the states by mistake,'' said one U.S. official, explaining the need
for the medical specialists and their sophisticated equipment.
``Conversely, we wouldn't want to leave an American here.''
   Seven Ethiopians also died in the crash Aug. 7 of the small Twin
Otter plane, which was en route to a refugee camp near the Sudanese
border. The plane slammed into the side of a mountain in bad
weather, killing all aboard.
   Leland, D-Texas, was visiting Ethiopia in his official capacity
as head of the House Select Committee on Hunger.
   As the medical experts arrived, other American military personnel
began leaving.
   On Sunday, when the wreckage of the plane was found, more than
300 U.S. personnel were in Ethiopia taking part in the search.
   Not since 1974, when a military coup brought a Marxist government
to power in Ethiopia, have so many U.S. personnel been in the
country.
   The Ethiopians even permitted an American U-2 reconnaissance
plane, commonly used on spy missions, to participate in the search.
   That cooperation extended into an investigation into the cause of
the crash, being conducted jointly by the Ethiopian Civil Aviation
Authority and U.S. and Canadian experts.
   Members of the National Transportation Safety Board and its
Canadian counterpart and representatives of the Boeing and Pratt &amp;
Whitney companies flew to the crash site Wednesday to begin the
investigation.
   Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney provided the aircraft's frame and the
engines for Leland's chartered Twin Otter, which was manufactured in
a Canadian plant.
   A memorial service for Leland was scheduled Saturday in Houston.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Secretary of
Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan and White House personnel
director Chase Untermeyer would represent the president at the
service.

   After seven years of silence, Britain and
Argentina on Wednesday began talks aimed at normalizing diplomatic
and trade relations that were severed after the 1982 Falklands War.
   Britain's U.N. ambassador, Sir Crispin Tickell, met Lucio Garcia
del Solar, director-general of Argentina's Foreign Ministry, to
``seek to establish the conditions and agenda for direct talks
between the United Kingdom and Argentina,'' according to Britain's
U.N. mission.
   The mission said the meetings ``will be without prejudice to the
sovereignty positions of either side regarding the Falkland
Islands.''
   The talks opened Wednesday but no details on the times and
locations were disclosed. An official communique is expected after
they conclude Thursday.
   Although the dialogue is not taking place under U.N. auspices,
``it is an encouraging development that Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar welcomes,'' said his spokesman, Francois Giuliani.
   Argentina's new president, Carlos Saul Menem, made the dialogue
possible when he dropped his country's insistence that Argentina's
claim to the islands it calls the Malvinas be the first step in any
talks.
   A meeting between British and Argentine government officials in
Bern, Switzerland, in July 1984 broke down when Argentina raised the
sovereignty issue as a precondition.
   In April 1982, Argentina invaded the islands, where 2,000 people
of British descent live. Britain counterattacked and defeated
Argentina in a six-week war that cost nearly 1,000 lives.
   Britain cut ties with Argentina and has said it will never
negotiate sovereignty of the islands, where the population has
expressed almost unanimous preference for continuing their colonial
relationship with Britain.
   Argentina and Britain have held indirect talks through the United
States on such issues as fish conservation.
   Menem's government would like to recover fishing rights in the
area around the Falklands. Britain currently enforces a 150-mile
exclusion zone, steering Argentine vessels away from the area.
   Many nations fish in the areas just outside the exclusion zone,
largely unregulated, and Britain and Argentina would like to reach
an accord on regulating fishing in the south Atlantic.
   Both countries have lifted bans on importing each others'
products, with Buenos Aires taking the step this month. Britain
lifted its ban in 1985.
   Diplomats said Argentina is also looking ahead to the unified
European Community in 1992 and realizes it must mend fences with
Britain, which will be one of the major members of the new
Euromarket, the largest trade bloc in the world.
   The Falkland Islands are 300 miles east of the Strait of Magellan.
   A British explorer sighted them in 1592, and Britons landed on
them in 1690. They have been under British rule since 1833, but
Argentina claims it inherited the land when it declared independence
from Spain in 1810.

<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's defense minister on
Wednesday accused the United States and Pakistan of organizing a
major guerrilla offensive to overthrow Kabul's Marxist government.
   Defense Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai, in an unusual interview with
Western reporters, also said fighting in the 11-year-old civil war
had died down across most of the country in recent months despite
what he described as ``newer, heavier, and more sophisticated'' U.S.
arms provided to the guerrillas.
   Tanai also said the Moslem guerrillas fighting to overthrow the
Soviet-backed government of President Najib were feuding among
themselves and could never be united under a single command.
   Asked about reports of a new guerrilla offensive, he said: ``On
the basis of information acquired from different sources, the
Americans, Pakistanis and Saudis are making strenuous efforts to
amass a huge force from among all opposition groups to launch a
major offensive with the hope of a military victory.''
   He did not say when he expected it to begin or provide any other
details, however.
   ``I'm also of the opinion that the problems of Afghanistan should
be settled through peaceful means, and there is no possibility of
the military solution of the problem,'' Tanai said.
   He added that the Soviet Union was ready to stop supplying
weapons to Afghanistan if the United States, Pakistan, and Saudi
Arabia halted arms shipments to the guerrillas.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have accused each other of
escalating the arms race in this poverty-stricken nation of 10
million people.
   Washington says the Soviets have nearly doubled their weapons
shipments to Kabul since they pulled their last troops from
Afghanistan in February. It says the Soviets are providing up to $3
billion in weapons annually.
   Last week, Afghanistan said the Soviets had begun to supplying
MiG-29 fighters and the latest Sukhoi-27 ground-attack jets.
   Washington has promised the guerrillas new weapons to attack
airport runways and counter high-altitude bombing attacks by the
Afghan air force.
   Despite the reported arms shipments, Tanai said there had been an
overall reduction in fighting by the guerrillas, except in provinces
bordering Pakistan. The seven most powerful guerrilla groups are
based there.
   Tanai also said that since the Soviet pullout, leaders of the
Pakistani-based guerrillas, who formed an interim
government-in-exile, have lost much of their control over guerrilla
field commanders.
   He said they were becoming increasingly isolated because of their
growing identification with foreign powers.
   ``I am of the opinion opposition groups can never have a regular
organization, and they can never be used under a single command.
This is the result of the shattering blows of the armed forces ...
which led to severe differences among them,'' he said.
   Though reputed to be a hard-liner, the general said he supported
Najib's policy of bringing all warring factions into a broad-based
coalition and creating a neutral, demilitarized Afghanistan.
   He said the Afghan government has confounded Western predictions
it would fall quickly without Soviet troops.
   ``The armed forces ... proved in the last six months that they
can independently and alone eliminate the opposition groups inside
the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Communist Party Seeks to Restore Moral Leadership</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party is appealing to the patriotism
of the Chinese people as it tries to re-establish its moral
influence in the wake of the June crackdown on dissent.
   Official newspapers Wednesday reprinted a 1956 article by senior
leader Deng Xiaoping that focused on the party's efforts to adapt
socialism to fit China's needs, and its duty to set a moral example
for the public.
   Deng, responding to questions raised by a youth group, said
Communist Party members were ``advanced elements among the common
people'' who can lead China down the ``happy road to socialism.''
   The renewed call for party members to ``serve the people
wholeheartedly'' is part of the party's effort to regain public
confidence following massive pro-democracy protests this year.
   Party hardliners, who ordered the army to crush the student-led
protests on June 3-4, are blaming the demonstrations and violence on
ousted party leader Zhao Ziyang and a small group of dissidents it
accuses of promoting ``anti-Chinese,'' or unpatriotic, ideas.
   There are no signs yet of the xenophobia of the 1966-76
ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, when even tenuous contacts with
the outside world drew severe political persecution.
   After a decade of openness, China's leaders appear unwilling to
jeopardize foreign trade and international aid. They make only vague
attacks on Western democratic ideas.
   But those attacks portray the Communist Party as the nation's
defenders against a conspiracy to replace its customs and traditions
with Western culture and socialism with capitalism.
   ``Today, restoration of capitalism in China can only turn the
socialist country into a dependency of the West. The Chinese nation,
except for the traitors, will never agree to this,'' the People's
Daily said Tuesday.
   State Council spokesman Yuan Mu on Wednesday accused ``some
foreign powers'' of contributing to the pro-democracy movement and
of stirring up a ``wave of anti-Chinese feeling.''
   The party has justified its arrests of many Chinese dissidents by
charging that they opposed communism and rejected Chinese culture.
   Dissidents such as astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who is in hiding in
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, ``looked down on (China's) ancient land
and our yellow-skinned countrymen to such an extent that they even
dreamed of extinguishing the Chinese race,'' the Beijing Daily said.
   The official commentaries blame Zhao, who is believed to be under
house arrest, for corruption and have repeatedly criticized him for
supporting a controversial TV series broadcast last year, ``River
Elegy,'' that questions the superiority of traditional Chinese
culture.
   ``River Elegy taunted and condemned the Yellow River and the
Great Wall ... (and) went on to use yellow water, yellow soil,
yellow beans, yellow rice and yellow skin as signs of China's
backward and hopeless civilization,'' the Beijing Daily said.
   The People's Daily, the official party newspaper, said the series
``repudiates the achievements made by socialist China ... While
eulogizing and beautifying Western or capitalist civilization.''
   An author of the series, Su Xiaokang, is blamed in some accounts
for inciting the pro-democracy protests with Zhao's support.
   But Su, who was arrested in June, said ``River Elegy'' was
intended to encourage ``enlightenment and help the Chinese people
find a way out for their country.''
   The party's efforts to meld partriotism and party influence is
aimed at recapturing the influence lost by the pro-democracy
protests and the resulting crackdown, in which hundreds were
believed to have died.
   The protesters' complaints of official corruption touched a
sensitive chord among the general public and posed a clear challenge
to the party's moral leadership. Hundreds of thousands of people
took to the streets to cheer the protesters and to voice their own
grievances.
   Chinese say privately that few people are cooperating with party
officials sent to work units to investigate supporters of the
protests.

   Israeli authorities are depriving the 700,000
Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip of adequate medical care as
an additional means of battling the Arab uprising, a group of
doctors alleged Wednesday.
   The Israeli and Palestinian doctors, who wrote a report on
medical conditions in the occupied lands, said at a news conference
that indifference by Israeli authorities and political obstacles
also have led to poor medical care in the territories.
   The only psychiatric ward for Gazans has no one trained in
psychiatry, and the only oncology department is run by a blood
specialist rather than a cancer expert, the doctors said in a report.
   The group _ the Association of Israeli and Palestinian Physicians
for Human Rights _ said that since the outbreak of the uprising, ``a
new tendency has appeared: the use of medicine as an additional
means of repression against the population.''
   The military government's chief medical officer in Gaza denied
the charges. ``We don't mix medicine and politics,'' said Dr.
Yitzhak Peterburg.
   He added that ``this physicians' association is known for its
imprecision and slanting of facts.''
   The doctors conceded that since Israel captured the Gaza Strip
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war, medical treatment for Gazans
has vastly improved. For example, infant mortality has dropped from
86 deaths per 1,000 babies to 28 deaths between 1970 and 1988.
   But they said the improvements came mainly because Israeli
hospitals were available to Gaza residents. They said facilities in
Gaza have been ignored.
   The doctors said the need for medical care has risen steeply
because of the 20-month-old uprising, which has killed 536
Palestinians and wounded thousands in clashes with the army and
Jewish settlers.
   The inadequacy of medical services has created a situation where
Gazans ``are completely dependent on the decisions of the military
government,'' the doctors said.
   It cited a severe shortage of doctors _ one per 1,400 residents
in Gaza compared with one per 400 residents in Israel. It also
claimed that Israeli policies prevent dozens of Arab doctors from
working.
   No services exist in Gaza for chest or blood vessel surgery,
neurosurgery, radiation treatment, pathology or handicapped
rehabilitation, the report said.
   It charged that during army-imposed curfews, people who need
medical care often could not get to clinics or hospitals. It also
said army troops had thrown tear gas inside hospitals and entered
some facilities to beat patients and medical staff.
   Peterburg said soldiers were under strict orders not to interfere
with hospitals but could enter to make arrests. He said soldiers
caught in beating incidents were punished.
   While acknowledging that health services in Gaza were not on a
par with those of Israel, he said: ``If you look at the area over a
period of years and remember where we started, the figures show that
there has been constant improvement, even during the uprising.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Kremlin
leadership on Wednesday rejected as unconstitutional a new Estonian
law that denies some Russian residents of the Balitic republic the
right to vote.
   They called it a violation of human rights.
   However, the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top
executive body, has apparently sought to avoid a contest of wills
with Estonian leaders over the law, which has touched off an
8-day-old protest strike by tens of thousands of ethnic Russians who
live in the tiny Baltic republic.
   Instead, the Presidium said that by Oct. 1, Estonia's government
would present the republic's legislature with proposals to bring the
law into line with the Soviet Constitution, the Tass news agency
reported. That seemed to indicate agreement on both sides to avert a
crisis.
   Leaders in the republic of 1.6 million people, which declared its
sovereignty in November, have rejected attempts by Moscow-based
authorities to annul their laws, but both sides have avoided
bringing matters to a head.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel met with the Presidium in the
Kremlin Wednesday and explained the reasons that led to adoption of
the election law, Tass said. It was not clear whether he agreed it
should be revised.
   Ethnic Estonians have called the more-restrictive law a necessity
to ensure they maintain political control in their ethnic homeland
and are not overwhelmed by an influx of ethnic Russians and Soviet
outsiders lured by Estonia's higher living standards.
   But the Presidium found that the law's restrictions, which
Justice Minister Veniamin Yakovlev said constitute the Soviet
Union's first residency requirements for voting and holding office,
``violate human rights .. including in the International Covenant on
Human Rights,'' Tass said.
   The law limits the right to vote and hold office to long-term
residents.
   Among diplomatic commitments entered into by the Soviets that are
violated by the law is a Covenent guarantee that ``each citizen
should have the right and possibility to vote without any
discrimination and without groundless restrictions,'' the Presidium
said.
   ``The Soviet Constitution, its demands of equality of rights of
citizens and equality of citizens before the law, must be observed
unconditionally _ there is no other way,'' said Vice President
Anatoly I. Lukyanov, a Gorbachev protege, who chaired the meeting.
   Excerpts of the session were shown by state television.
Gorbachev, the Presidium's chairman, did not take part, but Tass
said he signed the decree at the Kremlin, giving it his personal
stamp of approval. The Soviet leader has been rumored to be on his
customary August vacation.
   The Aug. 8 decision of Estonia's Supreme Soviet parliament to
limit the right of suffrage and office-holding ignited a strike that
continued Wednesday. Strike committee member Vasily Maximov said by
telephone from Estonia's capital, Tallinn, that more than 20,000
workers have walked off the job, shutting down 51 factories and
enterprises.
   Official Soviet media have said the strike in one of the
country's most economically advanced republics has cost the national
economy millions of rubles.
   More than 2,000 loaded freight cars are sitting idle and dock
workers at Tallinn's two ports also have joined the walkout, Tass
reported.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said Wednesday the Estonian
government had annulled its own Aug. 10 decree that had ordered an
immediate end to the strike, but which stiffened strikers'
resistance instead.
   Protest leaders said the decision, which they called an attempt
to appease them, would have no effect.
   ``Our demands are political, not economic,'' said Maximov. ``We
are fighting for our political rights.''
   Leaders of the strike, which began the day after the more
restrictive election law was adopted, say the measure
disenfranchises many ethnic Russians and other recent arrivals in
the republic. Of Estonia's total population, 65 percent are ethnic
Estonians and 28 percent are ethnic Russians.
   While the Presidium was in session, a commission of Soviet
parliamentarians toured Estonian factories hit by the strike and
spoke with workers, said Mikhail Lysenko, another strike committee
member.
   The panel of legislators met Tuesday night with the strike
committee, Lysenko said from Tallinn.
   Under the new election law, residents of Estonia must live in the
same district for at least two years or anywhere in Estonia for a
total of five years to be able to vote. Candidates for elective
office must have lived in the same spot for five years or in Estonia
for 10 years.
   By declaring the law unconstitutional, the Presidium again was
taking issue with the republic's claim of ``sovereignty'' proclaimed
in November by Estonia's Supreme Soviet, which said the
independent-minded republic could set its own policy in all fields
except foreign policy and defense.
   Moscow authorities pronounced that concept invalid, but the
Estonian parliament has stood by its vote. This year, Estonian
lawmakers also declared Estonian the republic's official language
and approved limited private property.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the Philippines and bank
creditors announced tentative agreement Wednesday on a new debt
package, allowing the Bush administration to claim a second victory
for its program to reduce the debt burden being carried by the Third
World.
   The Philippines will receive new money in addition to a partial
reduction in its $28 billion debt burden, about half of which is
owed to commercial banks.
   The Philippines agreement follows an accord reached last month
with Mexico, the developing world's second largest debtor with $108
billion in loans.
   The Bush administration hailed the Philippines pact as evidence
that its initiative to reduce the $1.3 trillion Third World debt
burden was bearing fruit. Private economists, however, were less
enthusiastic, saying the amount of actual debt reduction was likely
to be modest both for the Philippines and Mexico.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who was briefed on the details
of the debt plan Wednesday by top Philippine negotiators, predicted
that it would ``promote significant debt reduction while also
providing new money.''
   Brady on March 10 unveiled the administration's new approach to
Third World debt. The effort seeks to get commercial banks to
voluntarily forgive a portion of the loans they hold in return for
guarantees from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
that the reduced debt would be repaid.
   In the Mexican agreement, banks were given the choice of reducing
interest or principle on the old debt or lending new money.
   The same option of reducing old debt or supplying new money will
apply for the Philippines, officials said. They stressed that the
exact amounts of new money and debt relief will not be known until
the commercial banks holding the debt make their individual
decisions on which option to take.
   Philippine negotiators, who had been seeking new bank loans of as
much as $1.7 billion, expressed happiness with the outcome of the
discussions, which were held in New York.
   Jose Fernandez, the Philippine central bank governor who led his
country's negotiating team, said that the combined effect of the
debt reduction and an improving economy would eventually ``bring
about the end of the debt problem for the Philippines.''
   Mexico and the Philippines were considered two of the best
candidates for the Brady debt-relief plan. Discussions with two
other leading candidates, Costa Rica and Venezuela, are currently
stalled.
   Private economists said that the Brady initiative was still a
long way from its goal of reducing the pool of commercial bank debt
by 20 percent for the world's 39 most heavily indebted nations.
   ``This is an incremental change rather than an explosive
change,'' said Richard Feinberg, head of the Overseas Development
Council, a research group specializing in developing countries. ``It
would be a mistake to argue that there is great momentum behind debt
relief.''
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said that the
debt relief in the case of both Mexico and the Philippines was
likely to be modest as long as the packages remained voluntary on
the part of the banks.
   ``You need a coordinated effort and some type of enforcement
mechanism that says everybody has to write off a certain portion of
the debt,'' she said. ``If you are just piling new loans on old
loans with little actual debt relief, all you have bought is more
time.''
   David L. Pflug, senior vice president of Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co. and the leader of the bank negotiating team, said that the
options of granting debt relief or providing new lending would
appeal to two separate categories of banks: ``those that wish to
exit from the process as opposed to those that have determined to
maintain their credit relationships in the country.''
   Both sides predicted that a final agreement on all outstanding
issues with the Philippines would be reached in September.

   Dissident Czechoslovak playwright Vaclav
Havel urged his countrymen to refrain from street protests marking
the 1968 Soviet-led invasion because such rallies may spur a harsh
crackdown by authorities.
   Monday is the anniversary of the Aug. 21, 1968, invasion that
crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms that briefly liberalized Czech
society.
   In a statement dated Aug. 14 and released Wednesday by the
London-based emigre publishers Palach Press, Havel said he could
understand that Czechoslovaks might believe street protests are the
only way to vent frustrations.
   But he added, ``I personally believe there is no point in
resorting predominantly or exclusively to this method of protest now
... when authorities are waiting exactly for this type of action in
order to be able to strike hard to paralyze people's democratization
for a long time to come.''
   Havel instead urged citizens to sign the petition known as ``A
Few Sentences,'' which has garnered an estimated 15,000 signatures
since it was first distributed in late June.
   The petition demands democratic reforms and negotiations with
Communist authorities. It has come under fierce attack in the
state-run media and from party leaders who have rejected the sort of
political reforms occurring in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   Protests during last year's anniversary failed to nudge the
government closer to reform but resulted in at least three petitions
for democratic change and an increased activism among dissidents.
   This year, authorities have warned they won't tolerate
disturbances and will do what is necessary to maintain public order.
   Czechslovakia's official Human Rights Committee appealed to
citizens to avert street violence on the anniversary, Prague
newspapers reported Wednesday.
   The committee was established on Dec. 9, 1988, in an apparent
move to offset the rising wave of dissident protest, but activists
say it lacks the courage to speak out against police brutality.
   ``Having the experience of January, we express our anxiety over
the possible manifestations of demagoguery, general nihilism or
violence in the forthcoming days,'' the Human Rights Committee's
appeal warned.
   The statement referred to protests that broke out in January
marking the 20th anniversary of the death of Jan Palach, who set
himself on fire to protest the 1968 invasion.
   Havel was arrested during one such protest and was jailed for
four months. Several dissidents have been harassed in advance of the
anniversary. Dissidents Jan Carnogursky and Miroslav Kusy were
detained in the Slovak capital of Bratislava on Monday, apparently
in connection with the ``Few Sentences'' petition.
   Two weeks ago, Havel was detained twice in two days and warned to
stay out of Prague.
   Last week, six independent Czechoslovak human rights groups
called for two minutes of silence at 5 p.m. on Aug. 21.
   Havel, 52, appeared to encourage his fellow citizens to be
optimistic that change is coming.
   ``I am firmly convinced that a thorough revision of the official
view of the August 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia is irrevocably
drawing near,'' Havel wrote.
   Havel cited Friday's statement by a Hungarian official that the
invasion was ``essentially wrong,'' and a Polish Senate resolution
condemning the Warsaw Pact invasion.
   On Wednesday, Hungary's ruling communists distanced themselves
even further from the 1968 invasion.
   In a statement carried by the official MTI news agency, the
ruling Politburo of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party said the
party's ``present leadership ... does not concur with the 1968
military intervention in Czechoslovakia.''
   The Czechoslovak state news agency criticized the Hungarian
statement as helping ``Czechoslovak and foreign anti-socialist
forces. They, incited by reactionary circles of the West, want, in
contradiction with the historic truth, to misuse the events of 1968
against restructuring and democratization inh Czechoslovakia.''

<HEAD>Small Mining Company Vows to Leave Tuscarora Alone But Continue Mining</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSCARORA, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This 1870 mining boomtown that now is home
to just a few people got something of a reprieve from a company
digging an open pit gold mine that was intended to swallow half the
historic community.
   ``Horizon affirms today that it has no desire to mine its way
through a century of history of Tuscarora,'' John Watson, president
of Horizon Gold Shares, told a public hearing Tuesday.
   Watson said the company, which originally wanted to expand its
open pit into part of Tuscarora, will leave the main town alone,
including three sites for which residents are seeking protected
historic status.
   ``I state publicly that Horizon Gold will not invoke Nevada's
eminent domain statute to mine within the original town site area,''
said Watson, adding that trailers outside of town could be moved,
however.
   Watson's statements came during a public hearing held by the Elko
County Commission to discuss giving historic status to an old
rooming house, a Masonic lodge building and the town cemetery in
this flyspeck on the map 250 miles northeast of Reno.
   The designation is sought by some dozen full-time and another
dozen part-time Tuscarora residents trying to block Horizon's
efforts to expand its 2{-year-old mining operation to get at ore
reserves near and below town.
   Dennis Parks, a town leader who has lived in Tuscarora since 1966
when he started a pottery school in the old rooming house, said he
was wary of the Denver-based mining company's promise to leave town
residents alone.
   He questioned why Horizon still plans to go ahead with its
lawsuit to prove that the company through its century-old mining
claims owns the town and that residents only have surface rights.
   Watson said the lawsuit, filed Friday in Elko County, is needed
to settle once and for all the issue of who owns the land in the
historic town built after gold and silver were discovered in the
late 1860s.
   ``There are 125 years of confusing and often conflicting
transactions that have given Horizon concern as well,'' Watson said.
   Some 80 people attended the 1{-hour-long public hearing in
Tuscarora, and 19 spoke in favor of designating the three historic
sites in the town.
   Only Watson opposed the status, saying the law specifically says
that an historic designation shouldn't be declared just ``to hamper
mining.''
   The commissioners took no immediate action on the issue and set
another meeting for Sept. 20 to discuss the proposal.
   Horizon employs about 50 people to work at the open pit mine 52
miles north of Elko. The company has invested $8 million so far in
working the pit, now about 400-by-800 feet and 150 feet deep.
   At its 1870s peak, Tuscarora had 4,000 residents and a
1,000-strong Chinatown, the largest Chinese population in the West
at the time.

<HEAD>SCLC Leaders Debate: Do Blacks Have A Political Party?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights leaders meeting here had intended to
plan a political action agenda on Wednesday. Instead, they found
themselves debating whether blacks have a single political party
they can call home.
   In a heated two-hour session, members of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference agreed that blacks in America are coming to a
political crossroads prompted by their wariness of Republicans and
their dissatisfaction with Democrats.
   But the SCLC leaders had few answers for voters who say they
don't think either party is sincerely interested in their concerns.
   ``We don't have to sell our souls,'' said Eddie Williams of the
Joint Center for Political Studies. ``But until (the Republican
Party) has those kinds of individuals who look like us and talk like
us and are willing to stand up like us, the black electorate will
not follow Republicans.''
   Blacks have been particularly reluctant to join the Republican
Party because they view it as insensitive to civil rights issues.
They also say the immediate past Republican administration, under
President Ronald Reagan, sought to turn back the clock on civil
rights progress made during the 1950s and 1960s.
   The Republican Party recently has stepped up its efforts to court
black voters, and the Bush administration has been in frequent
communication with civil rights leaders, voicing support for their
cause. Civil rights leaders say they are waiting for action,
particularly after recent Supreme Court decisions against
affirmative action and minority set-aside programs.
   The SCLC, which is convening in Atlanta this week, has lent a
noncommittal ear to the Republican Party's civil rights goals. SCLC
President Joseph Lowery has met with Bush and invited Vice President
Dan Quayle to open the convention.
   Teresa Jeter, who identified herself as a black Republican, said
the Democratic Party has failed to work for the roughly 90 percent
of black voters it represents. She said she feared that could happen
in either party.
   ``I'm no blind fool,'' she said. ``How can we work within the
system when it hasn't worked for us?''
   U.S. Rep. Walter Fauntroy, a Democrat who represents the District
of Columbia, said too much of the two-party system could dilute
black voting strength, ``given our numerical percentage.''
   Portia Scott, co-chair of the National Black Republican Council,
disagreed.
   ``I'm appalled by one-party domination,'' she said. ``It is
incumbent on everybody in this room to check out the Republican
Party.''
   ``I am not opposed to getting people out to vote Republican,''
Fauntroy said. ``You in the Republican Party must have the courage
to say to your party, `This is not a game.'''
   Fauntroy said that party identification is not a key question for
black voters. ``The question will be: `When I was hungry, did you
feed me?''' he said.
   ``I'm not here to say the Republicans have the answer,'' said
Bill Chappell, chairman of the Georgia Black Republicans Council.
``We as blacks should be cognizant of two-party politics. If it can
work for other people in the United States, it can certainly work
for us.''
   Lee Atwater, Republican National Committee chairman, and Ronald
Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, had been
scheduled to participate in the political session, but did not
attend. Quayle spoke on Tuesday.
   Emmanuel Cleaver, vice mayor of Kansas City, Mo., cautioned
Democrats not to assume blacks are satisfied with the party's
treatment of their concerns.
   ``We have been bludgeoned politically by Democrats,'' he said,
adding that it will be ``infinitely easier'' for blacks to progress
in both parties.
   The SCLC convention, which runs through Friday, is being held in
Atlanta for the first time since Lowery took over the leadership in
1977.

<HEAD>U.S. Calls for Release of Nicaraguan Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Wednesday welcomed
the release of 29 political prisoners by Nicaragua but condemned
that nation's government for continuing to imprison more than 6,000
people for their politics.
   ``This step is long overdue,'' said State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher.
   ``We urge the Sandinistas to release all political prisoners,
including the 6,000 political prisoners they still hold, and the
remaining 39 National Guardsmen who have been imprisoned since 1979
in violation of the Sandinistas' commitments ... to free them,'' he
said.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega on Tuesday announced the
release of 29 peasant farmers jailed for alleged
counter-revolutionary activities and said his government would
decide the fates of an additional 1,200 political prisoners by early
September.
   The gesture appeared designed to encourage anti-government
guerrillas to lay down their arms in the wake of an agreement among
Central American presidents to disband U.S.-backed Contra rebels
based in Honduras. The agreement calls for the demobilization this
fall so long as Managua moves toward democratic reform.
   The State Department spokesman said ``the release of political
prisoners is always a welcome development.'' But he said Nicaragua,
by continuing to hold political prisoners, was violating an
agreement reached two years ago among Central American presidents.
   ``The continuing imprisonment of political prisioners in
Nicaragua is a violation of the Esquipulas Agreement, which required
signatories to issue decrees of amnesty, which I quote, `shall
establish all the provisions to guarantee the inviolability of life,
freedom in all its forms, property and the security of the persons
to whom such decrees apply,''' said Boucher.

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Syracuse University basketball coach,
his players and the university community will be the focus of a
six-month Army research project on grief, an official said Wednesday.
   The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington plans to
look into how relatives, friends, fellow students, city and
university leaders reacted and coped following the crash of Pan Am
Flight 103 last December.
   A terrorist bomb exploded in the plane as it flew over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 270 people, including 35 students in Syracuse's
study abroad program. A Clay, N.Y., couple and three other central
New York students also died in the bombing.
   Researchers hope to gather data on how people handle grief and
how best to instruct counselors and others to deal with the bereaved.
   Researchers are especially interested in the emotions of Coach
Jim Boeheim and basketball team members who played in a game against
Western Michigan the night of the crash, said Capt. Paul Bartone, of
the Army's Department of Military Psychiatry. Syracuse won the game,
94-71.
   ``It was a controversial decision, and some observers felt it was
disrespectful,'' Bartone said. ``Others thought it was the best
thing to do. We want to see the impact of the decision on players.
   ``The Army parallels to this because, when a unit suffers major
losses, often there is not a great deal of time for formal mourning
before activities must resume,'' he said.
   The Syracuse project is an extension of a 3-year-old project by
the department in which researchers have studied bereaved family
members and those assigned to help families after a Dec. 12, 1985,
charter airline crash in Gander, Newfoundland, in which 248 soldiers
were killed.
   In Syracuse, researchers also will study the effects on those who
counseled the bereaved.
   ``We want to derive the human psychological lessons from the
experiences, so other communities and individuals will be better
prepared,'' Bartone said.

<HEAD>Skinner Asks Action on Air Accident Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner called
Wednesday for the Senate to move quickly to to ratify a 14-year-old
treaty that would increase compensation for victims of international
air accidents, saying action is long overdue.
   In a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Skinner
said the bombing last December of Pan American World Airways Flight
103 ``serves to highlight the gross injustices that exist'' because
current treaty provisions limit compensation to $75,000.
   The Senate has wrestled with the compensation question for more
than a decade.
   In 1975, the United States signed the so-called Montreal
Protocols to the Warsaw Convention which would allow an increase in
compensation for international air accidents by establishing
supplemental compensation plans.
   While the Foreign Relations Committee twice has recommended the
Montreal Protocols be ratified, the Senate has failed to do so
because critics objected that proposed plans still did not provide
for enough compensation to international air travelers.
   Last year the Transportation Department offered a revised
supplemental compensation plan. It cast aside the proposed maximum
compensation of $317,000 and proposed an essentially unlimited
recovery plan per passenger which would be subject only to an
overall limit of $500 million per accident.
   The awards would come from a special fund established through a
$5 per passenger fee on roundtrip tickets for international air
travel.
   But the Senate never held hearings on the proposal before
adjourning.
   In a letter to Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, Skinner asked that hearings be
scheduled as soon as possible on the revised compensation package
and that the full Senate act swiftly after that to ratify the
protocols.
   ``I urge that your committee take the necessary action to bring
an end to this longstanding inequity for international air
passengers,'' wrote Skinner.
   Congress has recessed until after Labor Day and a secretary in
Pell's office said the senator was not in Washington. Staff aides to
Pell and on the committee could not be reached Wednesday.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders to Hold Opposition Unity Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid leaders said
Wednesday they have scheduled a conference for Oct. 7 to unify
opposition to the government, and asked foreign countries to make
sure it is not banned.
   Organizers include Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of
the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize; Cyril Ramaphosa, leader of the black
miners' union, and Albertina Sisulu, co-president of the banned
United Democratic Front coalition.
   In Durban, the family of an anti-apartheid youth leader released
last week said he was shot dead outside his home. Eric Gumede, 27,
was freed after a prolonged hunger strike in protest of being jailed
without charges.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia said in Lusaka that black
African nations might help arrange peace talks between South
Africa's white authorities and the African National Congress
guerrilla group if the process of Namibian independence goes
smoothly.
   White South African business leaders, back from a three-day trip
to Zambia, said they tried unsuccessfully to persuade the ANC, which
has its headquarters in Lusaka, to abandon violence.
   Organizers of the unity conference said its aim was ``to map out
the most effective, shortest path to the ending of oppression and
exploitation, and the creation of a democratic country.''
   ``We expect the conference to be attended by thousands of
delegates from all walks of life, representing millions of people,''
they said in a statement.
   Last year, South Africa's white authorities banned a similar
conference.
   The organizers, predicting another ban, said: ``We are alerting
the international community to monitor the actions of the regime in
relation to this gathering of the people.''
   Officials of the United States, Soviet Union, Western Europe and
southern African nations have been briefed about the conference,
they said, and ``the current mood of our people is such that we
believe they will defy any attempt by the state to prevent the
conference from going ahead.''
   A nationwide defiance campaign now under way in South Africa is
challenging various racial laws.
   Gumede was a leader of the KwaMashu Youth League, a United
Democratic Front affiliate based in one of Durban's largest black
townships.
   His brother Popo said a car drove up to their home soon after
midnight and someone in it honked the horn. Eric went outside and
was shot in the chest by two blasts from a shotgun, Popo said.
   Kaunda, current chairman of the black ``Frontline States''
adjoining South Africa, said:
   ``We are watching South Africa very carefully on the question of
Namibia. If it fares well we are willing and ready to give South
Africa the benefit of the doubt. We might begin to ... bring South
Africa and the ANC together. The path is well marked out how we are
going to do this.''
   South Africa has agreed to independence for Namibia, also known
as South-West Africa, after U.N.-supervised elections in November.
   Sid Matus, president of the Association of Chambers of Commerce
and Industry, South Africa's largest business organization, visited
Zambia with two colleagues.
   They said before the trip they would confer with Kaunda and
members of his government about political and economic developments
in southern Africa, but told reporters Wednesday they also held
``wide-ranging discussions'' with members of the African National
Congress executive committee.
   ``They said they couldn't denounce violence because then there
would be nothing to fight this country with,'' Matus said. ``We
begged them to compromise their stance on violence, but to no
avail.''

<HEAD>Disrupted Deliberations Resume After Juror's Murder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disrupted deliberations in the ``Night
Stalker'' murder trial resumed Wednesday after the foreman said
jurors had ``put behind them'' the murder of a juror.
   Richard Ramirez, the drifter charged with 13 murders and 30 other
felonies, shouted out an objection when the judge indicated he would
allow the panel to return to its task with an alternate replacing
the dead juror.
   ``I have an objection,'' shouted Ramirez, using an obscenity.
   Defense attorney Ray G. Clark told the judge: ``I believe a cloud
hangs over the jury now, a cloud of sadness.'' He asked that
deliberations be suspended for a week.
   Defense attorneys said outside court they feared that the jurors,
grief-stricken over the killing of Phyllis Singletary by her
boyfriend, who then committed suicide, might vent their anger on
Ramirez.
   ``He's the only target they have,'' Clark said.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan, ignoring Ramirez's outburst,
overruled Clark's motions after interviewing the jury foreman.
   Asked about the atmosphere in the jury room a day after panelists
learned of their colleague's violent death, foreman Felipe Rodriguez
said, ``I feel it's somewhat tranquil. ... Everyone appears to have
put it behind them.''
   The judge then summoned all the jurors and told them to remember
that the killing of Ms. Singletary, found shot on Monday, had no
relation to the trial.
   ``Please understand that none of this had anything to do with
whether Mr. Ramirez is guilty or innocent of these charges,'' he
told the jurors.
   ``We must get on with the task that life has given us,'' he told
them.``No matter how deeply you feel about her death, it is in no
way connected to the case of Richard Ramirez.''
   Ramirez, 29, is charged with 13 counts of murder and 30 other
felonies. Prosecutors allege that Ramirez is the devil-worshipping
``Night Stalker'' who raped, robbed and murdered victims in a 1985
rampage that terrorized Southern California.
   Some jurors wept Tuesday when they were told about the death of
Ms. Singletary, 30, who had sat beside them in the trial for the
past year and had deliberated with them for 13 days.
   The alternate who was chosen to replace the dead juror was
distraught at first. But by Wednesday she appeared calm as she sat
in Ms. Singletary's seat in the jury box.
   Tynan informed jurors that Ms. Singletary's live-in boyfriend,
James Cecil Melton, 51, had committed suicide on Tuesday, leaving a
note admitting he had killed her over a domestic dispute.
   The deliberations have been troubled since last week when another
juror had to be replaced by an alternate for sleeping during
deliberations. That meant the jurors who had been deliberating for
13 days had to start their talks all over again. On Wednesday, they
began for a third time.
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin, told
reporters: ``I'm relieved. I am grateful that we followed the
correct path.''
   No mistrial motion was made, and Clark said he was uncertain
whether there would be one in the future.
   ``I like the jury,'' he said, ``so personally I'm not crazy about
a mistrial.''
   In another development, the judge said he was issuing a bench
warrant for the arrest of a defense attorney in the case, Arturo
Hernandez, who has failed to appear at recent court hearings. Daniel
Hernandez, no relation, said his colleague was recently married and
has been in Europe on his honeymoon.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three computer hackers suspected
of giving the Soviet Union information from military and industrial
computers worldwide were indicted on espionage charges, prosecutors
said Wednesday.
   The West German government called the breakup of the spy ring,
which gave the KGB secret data from 12 countries including the
United States, ``a major blow'' to the Soviets.
   In a four-page statement, chief federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann
said it was the first time his office had prosecuted hackers for
endangering national security.
   The men, identified only by their first names and last initial,
were indicted ``on suspicion of espionage activities for the Soviet
intelligence agency KGB,'' Rebmann said. The defendents were Peter
C. and Markus H. of Hanover, and Dirk B. of West Berlin, he said.
   The men were arrested in March. Peter C. and Dirk B. are in
prison, while Markus H. has been released pending trial, Rebmann
said. There was no indication when the trial would begin.
   The full range of information the Soviets received is not known,
but the espionage activities, first detected by a U.S. computer
specialist, had been in operation since at least September, 1986,
Rebmann said.
   The Soviets paid about $49,000 for the information, he said.
   The hackers gave the Soviets programs and passwords for computer
systems in industrial and military areas. They also gave Moscow a
``Security pack'' designed to prevent unauthorized computer
break-ins, Rebmann said.
   The three men broke into computers in West Germany, the United
States, France, Britain, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Austria, Spain,
the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, and the British colony of Hong Kong,
he said.
   Among the systems to which the hackers gained access was a key
U.S. Defense Department computer known as Optimus, according to West
Germany's ARD television.
   Other computers affected included some used by NASA and defense
researchers, as well as computers tied to nuclear weapons and energy
research in the United States, ARD said.
   The defendant Peter C. delivered his Soviet contact agent
``Serge'' information in about 25 separate meetings over the course
of 2{ years in Communist East Berlin, Rebmann said.

<HEAD>Congressional Agency To Estimate 1990 Deficit of $141 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Congressional Budget Office projects next
year's federal deficit at $141 billion, well above the $110 billion
target in the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law, figures obtained
Wednesday show.
   The budget office, which provides Congress with non-partisan
fiscal information, also estimates that without further action, the
shortfall will stay at about the same level through fiscal 1993 _
the year Gramm-Rudman requires that the budget be brought into
balance.
   The new numbers reflect the recent enactment of the savings and
loan bailout law and passage of the drought bill and another
emergency spending measure.
   The figures are of limited significance because the budget
office's forecasts are not used in the Gramm-Rudman process.
Instead, it is the White House's Office of Management and Budget _
perennially more optimistic than CBO _ whose projections are counted
by the law.
   In addition, when Congress returns from its August recess after
Labor Day, legislators will have nearly four weeks of work to find
additional savings before the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 1990. Among the
measures lawmakers are already working on is one that would produce
about $13 billion in savings from spending cuts and new tax receipts.
   If Gramm-Rudman deficit ceilings are surpassed, automatic
spending reductions in defense and many domestic programs can be
triggered.
   But CBO's figures, which the agency officially releases Thursday,
are noteworthy because they are respected by lawmakers and private
economists, who use them to measure the fiscal effects of programs
and legislative proposals.
   The executive branch plans to release its projections next week.
On Capitol Hill, it is widely expected that OMB will forecast a $116
billion deficit for fiscal 1990.
   The CBO projects a $161 billion deficit for this year, up from
$155 billion in fiscal 1988.
   The budget office is projecting that without any further action,
there would be deficits of $144 billion in fiscal 1991, $141 billion
in 1992, $143 billion in 1993 and $128 billion in 1994.
   The 1991 Gramm-Rudman deficit target is $64 billion.
   Congress enacted a $1.17 trillion budget blueprint for fiscal
1990 last May. CBO estimates that if all the savings contemplated in
the budget were fully achieved, next year's deficit would be $118
billion.
   Many of those savings, however, are not expected to be enacted.
For example, conflicts between Congress and the White House make a
projected $5.7 billion in asset sales extremely unlikely.
   The CBO estimates the savings and loan bailout legislation
President Bush signed into law last week would add $14 billion to
this year's deficit, $4 billion to the 1990 shortfall, and a total
of $10 billion over the following four years.
   OMB's projections of the effect of the savings and loan bill are
expected to be much different. Because the bailout's spending next
year will not count on the budget, OMB is expected to claim a
savings of about $12.5 billion resulting from the measure's passage,
according to the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee.

<HEAD>Iranian Foreign Minster Leaves Damascus, Cancels News Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS FARES</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's foreign minister canceled a news
conference Wednesday, giving no reason, and speculation arose that
he wanted to avoid questions about Westerners held by pro-Iranian
kidnappers in Lebanon.
   In a brief departure statement after three days in Damascus, Ali
Akbar Velayati said his visit was ``very successful and useful.''
   He had a final meeting Wednesday with Farouk al-Sharaa, the
Syrian foreign minister, but there was no immediate indication of
what they discussed.
   Sixteen Western captives are held in Lebanon, half of them
Americans. Most are believed in the hands of Shiite Moslem factions
sponsored by Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is loyal to Iran.
   After meeting with Sharaa on Tuesday, Velayati told reporters
``our talks with our Syrian brothers will not have anything to do
with the hostage issue, since this issue does not concern us.''
   He said the visit to Syria was linked to fighting between
Christian army units and Syrian soldiers in Lebanon, but official
Syrian media had indicated President Hafez Assad was pressing the
Iranians for action on the hostages.
   Syria, Iran's main Arab ally, has been instrumental in past
hostage releases and promised the United States to help resolve the
crisis that began with Israel's abduction July 28 of Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid, a Shiite cleric in south Lebanon.
   In Vienna, President Kurt Waldheim's office said Waldheim had a
message from Assad saying the captors of Joseph Cicippio had assured
him the American hostage's life would not be threatened again.
   Assad also pledged to help obtain the release of all hostages in
the Middle East ``for humanitarian reasons'' and condemned the
killing of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins as a ``crime against
humanity,'' said a statement from the office.
   Kidnappers holding Higgins, a U.S. Marine who was on U.N. duty in
south Lebanon when abducted in February 1988, said they hanged him
July 31, three days after Obeid was kidnapped. Cicippio's life was
threatened, but his captors said they had suspended the death
sentence.
   Velayati delivered a letter to Assad from President Hashemi
Rafsanjani of Iran, who has indicated willingness to discuss the
hostage question with the United States, but the contents were not
disclosed. The foreign minister said his talks in Syria centered on
``regional matters and bilateral cooperation.''
   Israel has offered to trade Obeid and hundreds of other Lebanese
Shiite prisoners for three Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon and all
the Western hostages.
   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Readers Tune Out Woodstock Anniversary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News stories about the airliner crash in Sioux
City, Iowa, were followed closely by more than half of the American
public, but most readers and viewers paid scant attention to the
anniversary of Woodstock, a survey released Wednesday showed.
   The latest in a series of news indexes by the Times Mirror Center
for Press &amp; Public Policy showed that 53 percent of those responding
followed ``very closely'' the news reports about the crash July 19
of the United Airlines DC-10, which killed 111 of the 296 on board.
   By contrast, 9 percent said they followed very closely the
stories about the anniversary of Woodstock, the upstate New York
rock festival that got under way 20 years ago Tuesday and is being
marked as a cultural milestone.
   The latest survey, conducted by the Gallup Organization Inc., was
done over a four-day period ending Sunday.
   The second-ranking story in the survey was the killing of Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins by his Lebanese captors, with 49 percent
saying they followed it very closely.
   Third, with 26 percent, was the passage in Congress of
legislation to bail out failing savings and loan institutions.
   The percentage of readers and viewers who said they were
following very closely the investigations of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development rose from 15 percent a month ago to 21
percent.
   Only 6 percent could identify Samuel Pierce as the Cabinet
officer in charge of the department at the time covered by the
investigations.
   But 17 percent could correctly identify Felix Bloch, the diplomat
under investigation as a suspected Soviet spy.
   Of 55 news stories included in surveys beginning in 1986, only
the explosion of the space shuttle challenger with 80 percent, the
rescue of a little girl who fell into a well in Texas with 69
percent and the U.S. air strike against Libya with 58 percent were
followed very closely by more Americans than was the Sioux City
crash.
   The only news story, of those selected for use in the surveys,
that was followed very closely by fewer viewers than Woodstock was
the coverage in May of the scandal that brought about the
resignation of the Japanese prime minister and other officials. Only
6 percent said they paid very close attention to it.
   Interviewers questioned 1,250 adults, 18 and over, by telephone.
Times-Mirror officals said the reported percentages might be off by
four points or so, as a reflection of the general population,
because of sampling error.

<HEAD>Drug Testing Program At School to Test Band, Debaters as Well as
Athletes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 1,500 high school students involved in
competition _ including athletes, band members, debaters and chess
students _ could soon face drug tests under a proposal adopted by a
suburban school board.
   The proposal approved for Homewood-Flossmoor High by the District
233 School Board on Tuesday night is believed to be one of the first
involving all students in interscholastic competition. Only a
handful of high schools across the country test athletes for drugs.
   ``The feeling of the board is that these kids represent our
school by wearing the uniform and carry our name in a different
arena,'' District 233 Superintendent Ed Rachford said Wednesday.
``There was a firm belief that anyone representing the school has an
obligation to be an example.''
   The proposal originated two months ago with football coach John
Wrenn, who sought permission to test only those members of his team
that he suspected might be using drugs.
   ``I wanted to be able to reach the kids I felt had a problem, but
after all that's gone on, I realize you can't play God and
arbitrarily decide who you test,'' Wrenn said. ``Even so, I didn't
have the slightest idea it was going to wind up like this.''
   Neither did the administration of the school in south suburban
Flossmoor, the lone school in District 233, Rachford concedes.
   ``Coach Wrenn said he was willing to subject his program to this
kind of scrutiny, so the administration researched the legal
questions and decided to expand it to include all athletes,'' he
said.
   The board went even further, amending the proposal to include all
students involved in interscholastic activities. The final package
was approved by a 5-1 vote.
   Board member Katherine Cerone, the lone dissenter, said she
wanted to hear more from parents, teachers, students and others in
the community before approving the policy.
   How the plan will be implemented remains to be worked out by the
board, but the details will be of great interest to school
administrators elsewhere.
   Rachford, however, said he envisions many obstacles. The school
has 2,100 students; 1,500 were in interscholastic activities last
year.
   ``We may be headed for legal challenges. Speaking practically,
who pays _ the public, parents, booster clubs, merchants? Then, in
what order do we do this and how quickly can we afford to do it?
Random testing, or not?
   ``There are a lot of questions to be answered before we bring
this proposal back to the board'' on Sept. 5, when the
administration will submit a detailed plan for final approval, he
said.
   ``It sounds like we rushed into this,'' Rachford said, ``but
there was a lot of frustration that kids are endangering themselves
and we're unable to make a dent. I think the idea is that any tool
we can aquire would be an important step.''
   Drug testing for high school athletes withstood its first legal
challenge late last year, when a federal appeals court ruled
unanimously that a high school near Lafayette, Ind., could use
randomly test athletes.
   Since then, Jake Burton, athletic director at John T. McCutcheon
High School, said he has been deluged with inquiries from coaches
and administrators around the country. ``They all want to know how
we are doing it,'' he said.
   Ben Wolf, a specialist in children's rights for the American
Civil Liberties Union in Chicago, said the Indiana case was very
different from what was being proposed at Homewood-Flossmoor.
   ``In that case there was credible evidence that the athletes had
a serious drug problem,'' he said.
   He also called the suburban school's expanded plan the first step
down the wrong road.
   ``Anything that erodes society's expectations of privacy for
students, I think, is trouble,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A New York distributor of airplane parts and its
president pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal charges that they
conspired to sell doctored airline parts to governments,
manufacturers and airline customers.
   Bruce J. Rice, 42, president of Rice Aircraft Inc. of Hauppauge,
N.Y., pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and two counts of
mail fraud. The company pleaded guilty to one count each of
conspiracy and mail fraud.
   Attorneys on both sides emphasized that no aircraft accidents
were known to have occurred because of the parts, consisting of
altered and falsely certified rivets and other fasteners.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce D. Carter called much of the
problem ``historical,'' saying the parts likely would have failed in
their first few months of use if they were going to fail.
   But while many of the fasteners have been recovered or accounted
for, many are ``in the stream of commerce; they're gone,'' Carter
said.
   The counterfeit fasteners were distributed from 1977 through
1988, mostly in the early 1980s, prosecutors said.
   Court documents indicate the reprocessed parts were sold to the
U.S. government, the Israeli government, Airbus Industrie, British
Aerospace, Grumman, Sikorsky, Martin Marietta, Boeing Helicopters,
Air France, United Airlines, the Brazilian airline Varig, TWA,
American Airlines and Pan AM.
   Some of the parts were purchased for military aircraft including
the F-111, the B-1B bomber and F-14 fighters, prosecutors said.
   Rice and his company were accused of buying surplus parts from
suppliers, and then having them secretly stripped and replated or
relubricated at a facility that Rice's customers had not approved.
   To make the parts traceable, prosecutors said, certification
documents from the original suppliers were simply copied and
submitted as the paperwork for the reworked fasteners.
   ``There's so much trust (in the industry), if somebody gives you
a part and it has a trademark on it, you believe that company did
the work,'' Carter said.
   The Rice case, which grew out of a tip from an anonymous whistle
blower in Rice's company, is the first prosecution produced by a
special federal task force called Northwest Defense Contracting, or
NORDECON.
   The task force, made up of the FBI, IRS and several other
agencies, has been investigating criminal practices in the aircraft
parts and supply business.
   Rice made no comment after entering his pleas. One of his
attorneys, Dan Dubitzky, said Rice ``has never, at any time, done
anything that jeopardizes the safety of the flying public.''
   ``After two years of investigation, the government has yet to
find anything, to prove anything ... is unsafe,'' Dubitzky said.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas S. Zilly set sentencing for Feb. 16,
1990.
   Under plea agreements, Rice faces five years in prison, a
$250,000 fine, $250,000 in court costs, an additional $250,000 fine
at the discretion of the judge and possible restitution of up to $1
million. The company could be fined $25,000 on each count and will
share any burden of restitution with Rice.
   On Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office also filed charges
against Richard Ohlman, 70, a parts broker from Mission Viejo,
Calif., for allegedlly conspiring with Rice and Rice Aircraft to pay
kickbacks in 1982 to Boeing Surplus personnel. The charge alleges
the cash payments were not reported to the IRS.

<HEAD>State Department Declines To Say Why It Barred Cubans From Baseball
Tourney</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Wednesday it had
invoked a 1985 presidential proclamation to bar seven Cubans from
attending a baseball tournament in Puerto Rico.
   In San Juan, the president of Puerto Rico's Olympic committee,
German Rieckeoff Sampayo, protested the decision as an ``abuse'' and
unsportsmanlike.
   The seven, one of whom was listed as a technician, applied as
journalists. Five Cubans who had been granted visas to cover a
boxing tournament in Puerto Rico were permitted to remain. And
another Cuban journalist was approved.
   Cuba's national baseball team is participating in the amateur
tournament known as the Interncontinental Cup along with teams from
the United States, Japan, South Korea, Italy and Taiwan.
   The 1985 proclamation declared all Cubans except diplomats
ineligible for visas. But, a press office statement said, ``as a
matter of practice, the department often grants exceptions to this
prohibition to Cuban sports delegations.''
   Forty-two members of the Cuban national baseball team were
granted visas. No explanation was given for singling out the seven
Cubans who were barred.
   ``After reviewing the applications, the department granted
exceptions to only five of the journalists,'' the statement said.
   A U.S. official said the decision was based on ``facts,'' but he
declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Balk at Mention of Genocide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Khmer Rouge are demanding that references to
genocide be struck from texts in what rivals said Wednesday was a
``semantic battle'' stalling progress at a Cambodian peace
conference.
   Less than two weeks before the close of the international forum,
the Cambodian guerrilla faction has balked over the word
``genocide'' and is insisting that Vietnamese civilians in Cambodia
be viewed as colonizers.
   The subjects are dominating discussions, diplomats say.
   ``Around these two themes they have launched an absurd and
indecent semantic battle,'' Cambodian vice minister of foreign
affairs, Sok An, said. ``They are blocking the work of the
commissions.''
   Working committees, which resumed closed-door negotiations
Wednesday after a four-day break, are to submit conclusions to a
session of foreign ministers that convenes for three days starting
Aug. 28.
   Ministers from 19 nations and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar opened the conference on July 30 in the first concerted
effort to lay the groundwork for peace in Cambodia.
   Vietnam will pull its troops out of Cambodia in late September,
leaving the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh fighting
the guerrilla coalition, unless the peace talks find a solution.
   Pressing conference tasks include setting up an international
control mechanism to monitor vietnam's troop withdrawal, an eventual
cease-fire and an end to foreign aid to the various factions.
   Progress is ``very 50-50,'' said one Western delegate. ``But the
mood, I think, is still fairly optimistic. ... It is a tremendous
task to be accomplished in a month.''
   Discussions are heated and insults have been exchanged between
the four Cambodian parties, said one participant.
   Prime Minister Hun Sen and the resistance, headed by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, remain opposed on all major points.
   The center of the conflict lies in whether the Khmer Rouge should
be allowed a part in a coalition government. Hun Sen argues they
should not, but Sihanouk maintains the Khmer Rouge are less
dangerous as allies than enemies.
   ``The priority now is to liberate Cambodia,'' said Keo Puth
Rasmey, a member of Sihanouk's delegation. ``We know that the Khmer
Rouge is the problem, but let the Cambodian people reject them ...
in general elections.''
   During nearly four years of Khmer Rouge rule, hundreds of
thousands of people were killed. Vietnam invaded in late 1978,
driving out the Khmer Rouge and installing another communist
government.
   Both Hun Sen's government and its Vietnamese sponsors refer to
the Khmer Rouge reign of terror as ``genocide.'' A Khmer Rouge
delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said using the word
``genocide'' in conference texts allows Vietnam to justify its
invasion.
   The resistance claims there also are Vietnamese soldiers
``disguised'' in the Cambodian military and up to 1 million
Vietnamese ``colonizers'' who have settled in Cambodia since Hanoi's
invasion and should be expelled. Hun Sen's regime says there are
less than 100,000.
   Sihanouk is prepared to settle the issue outside the conference,
according to members of his delegation, but the Khmer Rouge want to
deal with it now.
   The issue is ``a bigger problem than it would have appeared a
month ago,'' said the Western delegate, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

   A special runoff election to fill the unexpired

12, Gov. Bill Clements said Wednesday.
   In the special election Saturday for the 12th congressional
district, Republican Dr. Bob Lanier collected 21,978, or 39.39
percent of the vote, and Democrat Pete Geren, won 17,751, or 31.81

   A runoff between the top two vote getters is required because no

   Wright, a Democrat who resigned amid numerous allegations of

   Palestinian activists Wednesday ordered workers
in the Gaza Strip to join West Bank Palestinians in boycotting their
jobs in Israel to protest new rules that restrict movement of Gaza
residents.
   A general strike shut stores, offices and schools in the
territories for the second day, and at least 26 Palestinians were
reported wounded in clashes with Israeli troops.
   The government announced that charges had been filed against an
Israeli man for a traffic accident blamed for sparking the
Palestinian uprising 20 months ago that has claimed 669 Palestinian
and Israeli lives.
   The strike call was made in slogans painted on walls in the Gaza
Strip and signed by the underground leadership of the uprising.
   The 50,000 Gaza Palestinians who hold jobs in Israel were told to
begin a two-week strike Friday, the day Israel begins enforcing a
law that requires Gaza residents to have computerized ID cards to
enter Israel.
   On Tuesday, underground leaders of the uprising ordered the
60,000 West Bank Palestinians to begin a weeklong boycott of their
jobs in Israel to protest the cards.
   The protest could cost many Palestinians their jobs. Israeli
employers have been under pressure from the government to replace
their Arab workers with Israelis for security reasons and to lower
the nation's rising unemployment rate.
   But leaflets ordering the strikes said Palestinians defying the
call would be considered ``betrayers.''
   Israel said Gaza Palestinians who do not have the new
magnetic-strip cards will be turned back at the crossing into Israel
starting Friday.
   However, Brig. Gen. Arye Ramot, head of the military government
in Gaza, said later Wednesday that some cards likely will be issued
after the Friday deadline.
   Israel television report said 55,000 cards have been issued and
estimated that 1,000 have been destroyed by Palestinian activists.
   The government began issuing the computerized cards two months
ago to control the movement of Gaza residents. Cards are denied
anyone with a criminal record or considered a security risk.
   Palestinian activists have urged Gazans not to accept the cards
and have entered towns and refugee camps to collect and destroy many
cards already issued.
   Arab reporters said confrontations between soldiers and
Palestinians on Wednesday were the most violent in recent weeks, but
they gave no explanation for the upsurge.
   In the Askar refugee camp in the West Bank, soldiers opened fire
to disperse masked youths marching with Palestinian flags, the
reporters said.
   In the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, youths barricaded
streets with rocks, burned tires and hurled stones at soldiers, Arab
reporters said.
   Hospital officials said said eight Palestinians were wounded in
Askar, seven in Jabaliya, and 11 elsewhere. The army confirmed five
Palestinians were wounded in the Nablus area and said it was
checking the other reports.
   At least 536 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops and
Jewish settlers since the uprising against Israeli rule in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987. Another 95 Palestinians
have been killed by other Palestinians who accused them of
collaborating with Israeli officials.
   Thirty-eight Israelis have died in the violence.
   Herzl Bokovza, 29 was charged Tuesday with reckless driving and
manslaughter in the deaths of four Gaza Arabs in the incident that
started the rebellion.
   Witnesses said Bokovza's truck collided Dec. 8, 1987, with a car
carrying four Gaza laborers. The four Arabs were killed.
   Rumors spread that the driver had intentionally run over the
workers to avenge the earlier stabbing death of a Jewish man, and
rioting broke out.
   On Dec. 9, thousands of Palestinians took to the streets, burning
tires and throwing stones at soldiers, as they have ever since.
   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshed said the filing of
charges was delayed by a long police investigation and crowded court
calendars.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, campaigning for a Cuban-born
congressional candidate, Wednesday declared that U.S. relations with
Cuba cannot be normalized as long as Fidel Castro ``swims against
the tide'' of political reform in closed societies.
   Making a 2,000-mile political detour on the way to Maine for a
three-week vacation, Bush criticized the communist leader at a
fund-raising luncheon for Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is seeking to win
the seat held for 27 years by the late Rep. Claude Pepper.
   ``As president, I will look for signs that Castro wants to move
away from subverting his neighbors, move toward more openness, more
freedom for his own people. But until I see demonstrable change
there will be no improvement in relations with Cuba,'' Bush
declared, to warm applause. ``It simply cannot be.''
   In a city where anti-Castro sentiment runs high among Cuban
exiles, Bush avoided any mention of a recent Justice Department
action ordering the deportation of a popular Cuban-born pediatrician
accused of involvement in terrorist activities.
   Many local GOP officeholders and politicians, including Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen, have called Orlando Bosch a hero in a war against
Castro.
   Bosch, 62, in custody here as an illegal alien since February
1988, has been linked to terrorist acts aimed at Castro's
government, and to the 1976 bombing of a Cuban jetliner that killed
73 people. However, his supporters argue that he was acquitted of
the plane bombing in Venezuela.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen told reporters she and Bush discussed the Bosch
case on the way to Miami from Washington and he was ``very
well-versed on it.''
   ``It's not really a presidential matter, it's in the hands of
...the federal system,'' she said. However, she added that if a
mid-September court hearing on Bosch's appeal doesn't go his way,
she planned to renew her appeal to Bush to intervene.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would not
comment on the matter because Bosch's case was under an appeal in
federal court.
   The case puts the White House in an awkward position, given GOP
efforts to bring more Cuban-Americans into the Republican fold and
the administration's strong condemnation of terrorism.
   Bush stopped here to campaign for Ms. Ros-Lehtinen _ whose
campaign manager is Bush's son, Jeb Bush _ on a roundabout route to
Maine, where he will spend most of the next three weeks at his
seaside compound in the resort town of Kennebunkport. ``It was right
on the way,'' Bush joked.
   He landed in Maine late in the afternoon and went straight to the
compound.
   The Republican state senator will face Democratic lawyer Gerald
Richman in a special Aug. 29 election to replace the late Rep.
Claude Pepper.
   Bush was warmly received by the predominantly Cuban-American
audience of about 600 people, who paid $1,000-a-couple for the
luncheon.
   Fitzwater, meanwhile, said that Bush, returning to Washington on
Sept. 4, will address the nation on Sept. 5 on his new drug policy.
   It will be the president's first national address and will
probably be an evening speech from the White House, Fitzwater said,
although he said time and location had not been nailed down.
   Bush is scheduled to unveil his plan for fighting drugs earlier
the same day.
   ``The president felt it was a national strategy, an issue of
concern for all Americans and it will call for sacrifices and hard
work and he wanted to discuss it directly with the American
people,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush also discussed the war on drugs in Wednesday's political
speech, saying ``the No. 1 issue in Miami, the No. 1 issue indeed
across America, is drugs and the violent crime they spawn.''
   But Bush saved his sharpest comments for Castro.
   ``With Castro's Cuba just 90 miles away, she (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen)
understands the horrors of totalitarianism,'' Bush said.
   Bush's comments about Castro contrasted with his recent overtures
to leaders in Communist-led countries in Eastern Europe.
   In fact, he told his audience, ``We've seen how democracy is
surging forward around the world and taking roots in outposts like
Poland and Hungary.''
   ``Someday I'd like to see improved _ yes, normalized _ relations
with Cuba,'' Bush said. ``But that cannot and it will not be as long
as Castro violates the human rights of his own people; as long as
he, almost alone in the entire world now, swims against the tide
that is bringing sweeping change, democracy and freedom to closed
societies around the world.''
   Fitzwater said the Republican National Committee picked up the
tab for the political leg of Bush's trip from Washington to Miami
and then to Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, N.H., from where he
was to take a helicopter to his vacation home on the Atlantic coast
   Bush told his audience that ``with any luck and if the weather
holds'' he planned to watch the lunar eclipse Wednesday night with
family members in Kennebunkport.
   Fitzwater, briefing reporters on Air Force One on the way to
Miami, dismissed a new Washington Post-ABC poll showing that 52
percent of those surveyed did not think Vice President Dan Quayle
was qualified to take over as president.
   ``We think the public does have confidence'' in Quayle, the White
House spokesman said. ``We think the vice president is doing a
splendid job.''

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Extend From The Ohio Valley to The Ozarks</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms spread from southern Ohio to southeast Kansas and
eastern Oklahoma and were scattered across the East and Gulf coasts,
dampening the hopes of many Americans for a glimpse of Wednesday
night's lunar eclipse.
   In Oklahoma, the storms dumped up to 3{ inches of rain near
Sasakwa, and flooded many rural roads across Seminole and Pontotoc
counties. Street flooding was reported at Ada.
   Heavy rain also fell in the Wichita, Kan., area, and St. Louis,
Mo., got its first rain of the month. A thunderstorm produced strong
winds and small hail at Falmouth in northern Kentucky.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the East Coast
and Gulf Coast states. A thunderstorm brought .69 inches of rain in
17 minutes at Port Arthur, Texas.
   A tropical storm warning was issued for islands in the eastern
Caribbean as a depression moved westward from the Atlantic.
   The depression, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, was
moving at about 20 mph and some strengthening was expected by
Thursday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center in
Coral Gables, Fla.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.06 inches at Chanute, Kan.; .74 inches at Wichita, Kan.;
.94 inches at Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas; .67 inches at Mineral
Wells, Texas; and .59 inches at St. Louis, Mo.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms also developed in the
afternoon across the Rockies, and were expected over the northern
High Plains.
   Those parts of the nation with a clear eastern sky were expected
to be able to view Wednesday night's lunar eclipse.
   Temperatures were in the 70s and 80s across most of the nation in
the afternoon. Much of the northwestern states from Montana to the
Pacific Northwest had readings in the 60s. Temperatures were in the
lower 90s over portions of the Eastern seaboard, the central Gulf
Coast and Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, to 104 degrees at Needles, Calif.
The low in the nation Wednesday morning was 31 degrees at Truckee,
Calif.
   Thursday's forecast called for numerous showers and thunderstorms
over the central Gulf Coast region, southern Florida, and portions
of Virginia and West Virginia; and scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the middle and south Atlantic Coast states across
the Tennessee Valley and Gulf Coast states to the southern Plains.
Showers and thunderstorms were also expected across the Rockies and
Dakotas to western Minnesota.
   High temperatures were expected in the 70s from the Great Lakes
region and upper Ohio Valley to northern New England, and from
northwest Montana to the Pacific Northwest and along the California
coast; and in the 80s to lower 90s over most of the rest of the
nation. Temperatures were expected to reach near 100 degrees in the
Rio Grande Valley of Texas and over portions of Utah and the
interior valleys of California.

   Stockbrokers who peddle most low-priced but
often risky ``penny stocks'' will have to obtain a new customer's
written approval before buying the stock for him, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said Wednesday.
   The rule comes in response to a dramatic rise in the fraudulent
sale of penny stocks, which are usually not traded on exchanges or
quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation (NASDAQ) System.
   Because most penny stocks, which usually sell for a few cents to
a few dollars per share, are not listed with exchanges or NASDAQ,
information about them is difficult to come by and fraudulent claims
are difficult to dispute.
   Before the commission voted 5-0 to approve the rule, SEC Chairman
David S. Ruder said the problem was of ``great concern'' to the
agency. He and several other members of the commission noted,
however, that most penny stocks and penny stock dealers are
legitimate.
   Two weeks ago, 14 people and two companies were charged in
Chicago with an alleged $10 million penny stock scam in which the
companies' share prices were artificially raised before being sold
at large profits.
   Last fall, Ruder created a Penny Stock Task Force, which found
that a key ingredient in penny stock fraud is the use of
high-pressure sales tactics _ often over the telephone _ on small,
unsophisticated investors.
   The problem, say industry officials, lies with unscrupulous
salesmen who pressure investors to buy the high-risk stocks of new
or small companies or, worse, with crooks peddling the stocks of
sham companies.
   The ``rapidly rising tide of penny stock fraud and abuse'' is
``the No. 1 threat'' facing small investors, according to the North
American Securities Administrators Association, a state-level
investment regulators group.
   In the first half of this fiscal year, the SEC has received 2,462
complaints about penny stock frauds, compared to 1,510 for all of
last year.
   ``This will help us in our investigations,'' James I. Goldstein,
head of the task force, said of the new rule. ``Here's something
that will require writings to be made,'' said Goldstein, who is also
an associate director of enforcement with the SEC.
   The new rule will require brokers and dealers to obtain written
purchase agreements from new customers before completing their first
three transactions in stocks that are neither traded on stock
exchanges nor through the NASDAQ system.
   The rule will apply to stocks selling at $4.99 or less per share
or to stocks issued by companies with less than $2 million in
tangible assets.

   Solidarity members of Parliament
overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution Wednesday night calling for the
first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc, with Lech Walesa
as prime minister.
   Walesa, however, said early Thursday that ``I will not be prime
minister. There are better people than Walesa'' for the job. But he
added it was not his final decision.
   ``The final decision is will be when they nail up my coffin,'' he
told reporters.
   Walesa, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, was applauded loudly
at the caucus of lawmakers from his independent Solidarity movement,
United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party before the vote.
   ``I never assumed that Lech Walesa could be prime minister and I
don't assume so now,'' said the shipyard electrician from Gdansk,
who led the strike that created the independent union in August
1980. The post must be offered by President Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   The two small parties were non-voting guests at the caucus. They
have had a long alliance with the Communists, but agreed earlier in
the day to form a coalition with Solidarity.
   In a show of hands from the Solidarity caucus, the indepedent
movement's 161 Sejm deputies and 98 senators endorsed a government
formed by a coalition under Walesa's leadership. Only the five
negative votes and 17 abstentions were counted.
   In a last-minute amendment, they altered the wording to leave
open the possibility that Walesa could designate someone else to be
prime minister.
   Asked who the coalition will propose for prime minister,
Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek said, ``Walesa
will decide.'' He said it should be known by the end of the week.
   Before the vote, Walesa asked ``for a new coalition which will
counteract monopoly.''
   ``We came here to change Poland. ... I am very grateful to our
elder friends from the Peasant Party and the Democratic Party for
understanding my game. Together we will teach the (Communist Party)
pluralism, freedom and listening to others.''
   The three parties represent 264 parliament votes, a majority in
the 460-member Sejm, and theoretically enough to form a
non-Communist government. Walesa is not a member of Parliament.
   Whether the Communist Party would turn over control of the
government remained a question. In a separate meeting, Communist
lawmakers appointed a group to formulate a stand on the Solidarity
resolution.
   On Tuesday, Jaruzelski proposed a meeting of all the country's
main political leaders to find ``rational solutions'' to the
governing crisis.
   The resolution said, in part:
   ``We think that the parliamentary coalition of the Peasant Party,
the Democratic Party and Solidarity is capable of forming a
government of national responsibility under the leadership of Lech
Walesa in which all political forces of our country could be
represented, all forces which are determined to act in favor of
political and economic reform.''
   Earlier Wednesday, the Peasant Party lawmakers met with their
chairman, Roman Malinowski, and said afterward that they ``fully
support'' the proposal Walesa originally made Aug. 7 for a
Solidarity-led coalition with the Democrats and Peasants.
   The 27-member Democratic Party caucus also met and voted for the
Solidarity-led coalition, said its leader Jan Jankowski.
   Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak on Monday announced in the face
of opposition from Solidarity he was ready to step down and turn
over his unsuccessful attempt to form a government to Malinowski.
Malinowski has not accepted the proposal, and his party's
legislators said they preferred joining with Solidarity.
   The Communist Party chief described his party's situation as
``dangerous.''
   ``We have entered a period of an open fight for power,'' party
First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski told a closed meeting of
Communist Party lawmakers earlier in the day, according to the
state's PAP news service.
   ``The situation is dangerous, but it is not time to put up our
hands'' in surrender, said Rakowski. He alleged that Walesa's power
bid violated the ``round-table'' agreement reached in the spring
between communist authorities and the opposition.
   Addressing the caucus on behalf of Solidarity lawmakers, Deputy
Aleksander Paczynski called for intense reforms and a renegotiation
of the round-table accords to bring about fully free elections in
Poland in two years, instead of the promised four.
   A government headed by Walesa and ``spectacular quick decisions''
such as giving parliament control of state radio and television
would help quell social impatience, Paczynski said.
   In a climate of economic deterioration and public discontent with
the communist leadership, Solidarity has said only an opposition-led
government will have enough support to carry out difficult decisions.
   The proposal has alarmed the Polish Communist Party and the
government of the neighboring Soviet Union, which has said the
attempt to form the government could lead to the destabilization of
Europe and endanger the Warsaw Pact alliance.
   To ease Soviet fears, Walesa promised Tuesday that in a
Solidarity-led government, the Communist Party would retain control
of the ``sensitive'' ministries of defense and interior.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said in Moscow
the Kremlin is ``very concerned'' about events in Poland, but he
lauded as ``sensible'' Walesa's promise not to upset the Warsaw Pact
military alliance.
   Gremitskikh added: ``We don't interfere in the internal affairs
of that country. The Polish people should decide themselves.''
   Polish Communist Party Secretary Slawomir Wiatr told a Warsaw
newspaper, however, the the Communists ``will not take
responsibility for the result'' if Solidarity forms a non-communist
coalition government.
   More than four decades of government leadership by the Communist
Party appeared shaky because of the governing crisis that stems from
its crushing losses in the most democratic elections in the country
since World War II.

<TEXT>
   Horace Fuller, a retired U.S. Marine
Reserve brigadier general and a veteran of the Guadacanal campaign
in World War II, has died after a battle with cancer, a doctor said
Wednesday. He was 81.
   Fuller, a resident of the Spetsai for the past 10 years, died
late Tuesday at the Greek island's health center, according to Dr.
Christos Ressos.
   Fuller had recently traveled to the United States, where he
underwent several operations for cancer, Ressos said. It was not
immediately clear what type of cancer he suffered from.
   Fuller was born in 1908 and was a 1930 graduate of Harvard
University.
   He was one of the few survivors when his regiment hit the beach
at Guadacanal in the South Pacific during World War II. He was
wounded there and evacuated to the United States.
   When he returned to duty, Fuller was assigned to the Office of
Strategic Services, the forerunner to the CIA.
   He served in southern France and was one of three men who
parachuted into the Pyrenees to assist French resistance fighters
against the Nazis in May 1944.
   After the war, Fuller went to Greece to help with the Marshall
Plan and later entered the shipping business there. He retired from
the Marine Corps reserve while in Greece.
   His wife, a Greek, died in 1981.
   He was buried Wednesday on the island.

<TEXT>
   Ariel Sharon, Israel's trade and industry
minister, got an official invitation Wednesday to visit Soviet
Georgia, the national news agency Itim and Israel radio reported.
   The radio said Sharon would travel to the southern Soviet
republic in September or October, becoming the first Israeli
minister to visit the Soviet Union since Moscow broke relations in
1967 over the Arab-Israeli war.
   Itim said the invitation was extended by members of a Soviet
Georgian trade delegation who arrived Tuesday for a 21-day visit
aimed at promoting trade links between the Black Sea republic and
Israel.
   There was no indication whether the Kremlin had a hand in the
invitation, but it presumably has Moscow's approval.
   Sharon's spokesman could not be reached for comment despite
repeated telephone calls.
   Itim said the Georgian delegation included Vazha Gingihadze, the
republic's foreign trade minister, and the head of the Georgian
Chamber of Commerce. It said the delegates were investigating
possibilities of trade in the medical, agriculture and food
processing areas.
   A delegation from Soviet Georgia that visited in April signed a
cultural exchange agreement with Israel.
   There has been widespread speculation that the first minister to
visit the Soviet Union would be Ezer Weizman of the center-leaning
Labor Party, now a Cabinet minister without portfolio.
   Sharon is considered a hawk even in Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc. He was a hero of the 1973 war and,
as defense minister, directed Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
   Weizman is known for dovish views on the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, and agrees with the Soviet position that Israel should
talk with the Palestine Liberation Organization and trade territory
for peace.
   The Soviet Union severed diplomatic ties in 1967 to protest
Israel's occupation of territories belonging to Moscow's Arab
allies. The two nations established interest offices in 1987-88,
however, and cultural and tourism exchanges have expanded since.
   Analysts say Soviet republics appear to have greater flexibility
in contacts with Israel than does the central government in Moscow.
   Israel and the Soviet Union have no direct air links, for
example, but an Israeli jetliner landed in Yerevan, capital of
Soviet Armenia, in June to pick up 61 survivors of the December
earthquake for treatment in Israel. An El Al aircraft landed in
Yerevan again Tuesday, taking them home.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the Labor Party, said
recently that Israel should develop relations with each republic
separately.
   Last week, Israel and the Soviet Union agreed on their first
joint venture, to manufacture medical equipment.
   Israel's Agriculture Ministry and the Soviet Academy of Sciences
signed an agreement Saturday to create a joint agricultural company.
A five-member academy delegation had spent 12 days in Israel
studying Israeli agricultural techniques.

<HEAD>Jewish Group Applauds Pope's Statement on Covenant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish group applauded Pope John Paul II's weekly
talk on religious matters Wednesday, saying it had a different tone
than two speeches earlier this month that the group had condemned.
   Rabbi David Rosen, a Vatican representative of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said the pope addressed the
question of ancient Jews and their covenant with God ``in a manner
that is consonant with post-conciliar documents and that is to be
welcomed.''
   His statement was released by the league office in Rome.
   The group had protested following two general audiences in which
John Paul said the Old Testament showed ``many instances of Israel's
infidelity to God.'' The pope also said that God sent messengers to
convert people and tell them of a new covenant to come.
   The Anti-Defamation League had said those remarks suggested the
new covenant with Christianity had superseded the alliance with
Jews. The organization had said it hoped the ``clock of
Catholic-Jewish relations had not been tragically set back.''
   But Rosen said Wednesday's remarks were in line with the Second
Vatican Council's 1965 document Nostra Aetate (In Our Times), which
officially dropped the accusation that Jews killed Christ.
   Following Wednesday's general audience, Rosen said, ``It would
seem that the pope is trying to clarify classical Christian theology
in a manner that is consonant with post-conciliar documents and that
is to be welcomed.''
   He expressed hope that ``such clarifications may be the
expression of an ongoing dialogue which is only to the advantage of
the church, Jewish people and humankind as a whole.''
   The pope spoke Wednesday about God's choice of Israel as his
people, as expressed in the Old Testament, and the role of the Holy
Spirit in the creation of the Roman Catholic Church.
   The controversy over the pope's remarks came at a time of tense
relations between Catholics and Jews.
   A Polish cardinal recently suspended an agreement to move a
Catholic convent at the Auschwitz death camp, prompting protests
from Jewish officials.
   Jewish groups said the convent and its Christian symbols offend
the memory of the 2.5 million Jews who died there.

<HEAD>China Fines Five Major Companies for Illegal Activities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government fined five state-owned companies
millions of dollars for profiteering and tax evasion and urged
officials to cooperate in its anti-corruption drive, official
reports said Wednesday.
   Newspapers urged state employees engaged in embezzling, bribery
and speculation to take advantage of a grace period that runs
through Oct. 31 to turn themselves in.
   Those who turn over illicit earnings will be treated leniently,
but those who try to conceal them will be severely punished, the
Chinese Communist Party Politburo has decided, major newspapers said.
   It was the latest move in an anti-corruption campaign launched
this summer to counter charges of rampant abuse of official
privilege _ a rallying cry of the pro-democracy movement crushed on
June 3-4.
   After a 10-month audit, the government ordered the companies,
including one linked to snior leader Deng Xiaoping's son, to pay
$13.8 million in back taxes, penalties and restitution of illegally
earned profits, Auditor-General Lu Peijian told the State Council,
China's cabinet.
   Among the audited companies were two conglomerates closed by the
Politburo last month in the crackdown on corruption _ the Kanghua
Development Corp. and the China Incomic Development Corp., the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Kanghua, under the auspices of the China Welfare Fund for the
Handicapped, was one of China's largest foreign trade firms. Deng's
son, Deng Pufang, runs the China Welfare Fund.
   The other audited companies were China International Trust and
Investment Corp., the nation's leading company for attracting
foreign investment, the Everbright Industrial Co., which has
subsidiaries in Hong Kong, and the China Rural Trust and Investment
Corp.
   Lu said officials responsible for illegal activities would be
punished by state supervision and judicial action, according to
Xinhua. The report did not name the individuals and it was unclear
who would be held accountable.
   All state industries will be subject to regular auditing and
supervision from now on, he said.
   The Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao reported that a Kanghua
subsidiary in June 1988 signed a contract with an agency in Jiangsu
province to buy 34,990 barrels of crude oil for $23 a barrel. The
company earned about $74,000 when it resold the crude oil at a
profit, the paper said.
   In another case, an Everbright subsidiary in Beijing purchased
$7.2 million in the Shenzhen special economic zone, across the
border from Hong Kong, at a black market rate of about 6 yuan to the
dollar, according to the paper.
   It then resold the money to the Ningpo City Development Bank and
other organizations at rates as high as 7.25 to $1, almost twice the
official exchange rate, earning $516,000, the report said.
   The official exchange rate is 3.72 yuan to the dollar, but
companies will pay much more for U.S. Dollars, needed for foreign
investment and to buy foreign technology and consumer goods.
   Xinhua said four of the five companies were involved in
unauthorized foreign currency dealings.
   Meanwhile, the government announced Wednesday that Chinese
students, who for decades have enjoyed free schooling, will have to
foot part of the bill for their college education.
   The new regulation, which goes into effect this fall, follows
several new education measures designed to avoid student movements
such as the spring pro-democracy protests. Those ended with the June
military crackdown.
   The government has also cut this year's freshman class by 30,000,
ordered the freshman class at Beijing University to undergo a year
of military training, and ordered graduates to get work experience
before starting graduate degree programs.

<HEAD>Woman Nearly Embalmed Released From Hospital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 87-year-old blind woman who was
mistaken for dead and nearly embalmed was released from a hospital
Wednesday, giving no indication that she recalled the experience.
   As Carrie Stringfellow was transferred to a nursing home, the
Ohio Department of Health, in conjunction with other state and local
agencies, said it had started legal action against the operator of
two unlicensed nursing homes in Springfield, including the one where
Ms. Stringfellow lived.
   Ms. Stringfellow emerged from Mercy Medical Center on a stretcher
carried by two paramedics. She was quickly transported to the IOOF
Odd Fellow-Rebecca Home of Ohio, where she was helped into a bed at
the nursing home.
   Ms. Stringfellow indicated she was unhappy at being moved.
   ``I just don't appreciate going nowhere where I don't know where
I'm going,'' she said. ``I don't feel good about where I'm going.
Nobody told me nothing about it.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Regina Estep said the arrangements had been
made and agreed to by family members, and that Ms. Stringfellow had
been told.
   ``I think this is the shock of having to change and be moved,''
said Ms. Estep.
   Ms. Stringfellow was brought to the hospital Aug. 5 after her
murmurings startled a mortician who had been preparing to embalm her
at the funeral home.
   The mortician, Dennis L. Porter, said he had been called to pick
up Ms. Stringfellow at a boarding home where she had been living at
the time. When he arrived, Porter said, the woman was slumped in a
chair and appeared to be dead.
   He said he placed Ms. Stringfellow in a body pouch, zipped it up,
and took her to his funeral home. As he was preparing to move her to
the embalming table, he said, she uttered a sound and he immediately
called an ambulance.
   Dr. Sajjad Siddiqi said Ms. Stringfellow was stable and fully
alert when she was brought to the hospital.
   ``She really did not know exactly what happened and how she was
brought in,'' he said.
   Siddiqi said medical tests failed to pinpoint what led to the
condition that made Ms. Stringfellow appear to be dead. He said he
believes she may have suffered a temporary heart blockage that
caused her to lose consciousness for several minutes.
   ``Being a blind person, she didn't know where she was. She has no
idea exactly what happened,'' he said.
   Siddiqi said he told Ms. Stringfellow a few days after she was
admitted to the hospital that she had been presumed dead and taken
to a funeral home, but he said she had no real reaction.
   ``She said, `Oh Lord, Oh Lord,' '' Siddiqi recalled. ``(But) she
really had no emotional expression at all.''
   The Health Department said its action followed an investigation
in which complaints were received about the facilities. The agency
conducted unannounced inspections of both homes.
   The department said it:
   _ Asked Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr.'s staff to
seek legal action prohibiting Robbie Caldwell, the operator of the
nursing home where Ms. Stringfellow was found, from operating such

   The Christian commander welcomed a U.N.
call to halt fighting that has cost more than 700 lives, but there
was no word Wednesday from the Syrians, who have ringed Christian
territory with guns and armor.
   Shelling that has ravaged Beirut became intermittent after the
U.N. Security Council issued its cease-fire appeal Tuesday night in
New York, but Syria and allied Moslem militias brought up men, tanks
and artillery to reinforce their siege of the Christian enclave
north and east of Beirut.
   An independent observer said privately the warring factions
appeared to be observing a ``cease-fire of convenience. They are
quietly bolstering their forces.''
   Five months of artillery duels between the Syrians and Gen.
Michel Aoun's force of about 20,000 Christian army troops have
killed 772 people and wounded more than 2,051, nearly all of them
civilians.
   A spokesman for Aoun said Wednesday: ``The general
unconditionally welcomes the U.N. Security Council resolution. The
resolution as we understand it is a package deal that involves not
just a cease-fire, but also lifting of blockades and programming the
Syrian military pullout from Lebanon.''
   Aoun calls Syrian troops an occupation army and has declared a
``war of liberation'' to drive them out. Syria has 40,000 soldiers
in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate granted in 1976, the year
after the sectarian civil war began.
   Syria made no immediate response to the truce resolution, which
the Security Council approved during a meeting called by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Earlier, Syrian President Hafez Assad told Italian Premier Giulio
Andreotti he will try to ``silence the guns'' in Lebanon and promote
a settlement among all factions in the country. Assad did not
elaborate in his reply to a recent message from Andreotti asking the
Syrian leader to act ``in a decisive manner'' to end the fighting,
the premier's officer said in Rome.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher read a
statement that said, in part: ``The senseless bloodshed ... has gone
on for far too long and it must cease. We urge in the strongest
terms that all parties abide by the council's call for a total and
immediate cease-fire.''
   Syrian gunners shelled the Christian enclave Wednesday and the
Christians responded by firing on residential areas of Moslem west
Beirut. Several apartment houses in the Moslem sector were set
ablaze.
   Six people were wounded in Christian territory, police reported,
but they said west Beirut suffered no casualties because ``most of
the targeted apartments were evacuated'' during earlier shelling.
   Moslem security sources said the Moslem allies moved more tanks,
troops and ammunition up to their positions along the 65-mile
confrontation line with Aoun's outnumbered forces.
   One said the Syrians deployed Soviet-designed T-62 tanks on the
northern and eastern flanks of the 310-square-mile Christian zone
and Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt positioned scores of T-54 and
T-55 tanks in the mountains to the south. The Christian area faces
the Mediterranean on the west.
   Israel has informed Syria of ``red lines'' it cannot cross during
any military action, particularly in south Lebanon, without inviting
Israeli retaliation.
   Druse fighters, seen manning jeep-mounted machine guns and
recoilless cannons, were seen in west Beirut for the first time
since Syrian troops moved into the Moslem sector in February 1987 to
stop factional war among militias.
   ``It seems we are heading for a new confrontation despite this
cease-fire call; the militias are back,'' said Talal Hosseini,
watching his janitor fill plastic bags with sand to fortify the
entrance of his apartment house.
   The Lebanese capital, divided into Moslem and Christian sectors,
has taken the brunt of battle. All but 150,000 of its 1.5 million
people have left since the shelling began March 8.
   Adnan Bader, a salesman, left more than a month ago for Shehim
village southeast of the capital. He drove to west Beirut on
Wednesday to check his apartment in the Bourj Abu Haidar district
and found it shattered by a 155mm howitzer shell.
   ``The radio reported that our street was shelled. I came to find
by apartment torn apart,'' Bader said, his eyes brimming with tears.
The shell pierced a bedroom wall, blowing away his children's room
and part of the living room.
   ``I'll move the fridge, the stove, the washing machine and the
rest of the kitchen equipment to Shehim,'' he said. ``It costs
plenty of money to buy these things.''
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, and Sunni
religious leaders also embraced the U.N. truce appeal, which was
broadcast by Beirut radio stations.
   Hoss and Aoun lead competing Moslem and Christian cabinets formed
during a government crisis in September 1988 that also led to a
split of the army into Christian and Moslem commands. The 22,000
poorly equipped Moslem soldiers, under Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib, have
stayed out of the current fighting.
   The artillery war began two days after Aoun's forces blockaded
illegal ports run by Moslem militias that deprived the government of
about $100 million a year in customs revenue.

   The leader of a Montana-based religious
sect that is preparing for nuclear war said Wednesday she never
urged members to purchase weapons, and denied that the church had
been stockpiling assault rifles.
   Elizabeth Clare Prophet, leader of the Church Universal and
Triumphant, told reporters after her 90-minute grand jury appearance
that it is not the sect's policy to purchase or stockpile weapons.
   Mrs. Prophet, her husband, Ed Francis, and two other church
employees appeared before a federal grand jury investigating alleged
illegal weapons purchases by Vernon D. Hamilton, a 15-year staff
member who handled security for the church.
   Mrs. Prophet, known as ``Guru Ma'' or ``mother'' to followers of
her Christian-New Age church, used the occasion to criticize the
lack of a national civil defense policy.
   The church is building a large bomb shelter to house 754 people
at its Corwin Springs, Mont., headquarters and members are required
to build individual shelters beneath or near their homes, said Erin
Lynn Prophet, a church spokeswoman and the sect leader's daughter.
   The shelters are being built on the 12,000-acre Royal Teton Ranch
near Yellowstone National Park in preparation for a possible nuclear
confrontation between the superpowers, Mrs. Prophet said. She
contended the Soviet Union is better prepared than the United States
to defend its citizens and military personnel in the event of a
nuclear attack.
   Even some members disagree with her prophecy predicting the start
of a new period of nuclear tension beginning Oct. 2, the sect leader
said. Church members are praying that such a confrontation will be
avoided, she said.
   Mrs. Prophet declined to discuss her testimony or Hamilton's
case, saying the proceedings were confidential and Hamilton's
attorneys had asked her not to comment on the criminal case.
   ``I trust the legal process,'' she said. ``I want to give it an
opportunity to work.''
   Federal prosecutors said they cannot discuss matters relating to
the grand jury.
   Hamilton, 42, was arrested in Spokane July 7 with documents
concerning the purchases of $100,000 worth of weapons and
ammunition. He was indicted July 25 on four counts of making false
statements in the acquisition of a firearm.
   Church officials Wednesday continued to deny knowledge of the
weapons purchases, which are legal, or Hamilton's alleged use of
fake names to buy them, which would be illegal.
   Documents found in the church-owned car driven by Hamilton
indicated he was the church's chief of security and planned to buy
enough weapons to outfit 200 people, federal authorities have said.
   Hamilton is staying at his parents' Spokane home pending a Sept.
25 trial. A conviction carries a maximum five-year prison sentence
and $250,000 fine.
   Among weapons confiscated by police were seven .50-caliber
Barrett semi-automatic rifles that assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas
Rice characterized as ``capable of taking out an armored personnel
carrier.''
   Other weapons included Korean assault rifles and Austrian sniper
rifles and more than 120,000 rounds of armor-piercing and tracer
ammunition.

<HEAD>Speed Limits Proposed To Curb Florida Boating Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida leads the nation in boating deaths
and unless strict speed limits are set and enforced, the situation
will soon become unmanageable, state officials said Wednesday.
   Department of Natural Resources officials opened three days of
public hearings on proposed new boating regulations with statistics
on Florida's exploding population of boaters and the casualties they
cause among humans and the endangered manatee.
   Boaters killed 105 people in the state last year _ 2.5 times the
national average _ and set a record in known manatee deaths with 29.
That record has already been surpassed this year with 37 manatee
deaths.
   The state has about 1 million registered and non-registered boats
and 3.5 million to 4 million people operating them, he said.
   ``It's very congested out there now, and with 100 boats being
added to the state total every day, we will double the number in the
next 10 years,'' said Don Ellingson, the DNR's director of the
Division of Law Enforcement. ``Unless we find ways to deal with that
congestion, we're going to have problems.''
   A key issue is expected to be the state's proposal of a statewide
speed limit of 30 mph on navigational channels in inland waterways.
This would drop to 20 mph in 12 counties with large numbers of the
sea cows.
   Except for a hodge-podge of local go-slow ordinances, there are
no boating speed limits now.
   Local and county elected officials and regulatory agency staffers
from Dade, Sarasota, Brevard and Suwannee counties expresed support
for the proposed rules, with some reservations and suggestions for
fine-tuning.
   The 12 counties being considered for manatee-protecting speed
limits are Brevard, Broward, Citrus, Collier, Dade, Duval, Indian
River, Lee, Martin, Palm Beach, St. Lucie and Volusia.
   Commissioner Charles Williams of Suwannee County said that while
there was support for the DNR proposals, he suggested a maximum
speed limit of 40 mph because of the importance of water skiing in
the state. Skiers say it is impossible to carry out their maneuvers
at 30 mph.

   The B-2 stealth bomber's
second flight ended prematurely Wednesday when a low oil-pressure
reading forced pilots to land the $530 million plane an hour after
takeoff.
   ``We don't even know if it's a problem yet. We're concerned with
it and will have to check it out,'' said 1st Lt. Anu Sjaardema, an
Air Force spokeswoman.
   The radar-evading aircraft lifted off over the Mojave Desert at
7:29 a.m. for a three- to four-hour flight but returned at 8:36 a.m.
because ``there were some minor concerns with the oil pressure
indicators,'' she said.
   The two men aboard, Air Force Col. Richard S. Couch and Northrop
Corp. chief test pilot Bruce J. Hinds, were never in any danger, but
they ``obviously would have liked to accomplish more,'' she said.
   ``We did achieve some of the things we set out to do, so we can't
say it wasn't a successful flight,'' Sjaardema said.
   The B-2, a tailless flying wing, flew with its landing gear
retracted for the first time, she said.
   Sjaardema also said the plane flew ``a little bit faster and a
little bit higher'' than on the first B-2 flight in July. But Air
Force Maj. Dick Cole at the Pentagon later said the plane ``was
flown to a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet and a maximum air speed
of 180 knots.'' That is the same elevation and speed as during the
July flight.
   The four-engine bomber, built with composite materials, is
intended to carry nuclear bombs and, along with the conventional
B-1, replace the Air Force's aging B-52 fleet. It is under fire in
Congress because of its cost.
   Each of the B-2's four engines has an accessory drive. ``One out
of the four drives indicated low oil pressure,'' Sjaardema said.
   Each accessory drive is like a transmission, connected to each
engine by a shaft. The drives power air turbine starters and
hydraulic systems, Sjaardema said.
   Air turbine starters are used to restart engines. The B-2's
hydraulics apparently control its landing gear, but it isn't known
if they are used to move flaps and other control surfaces, as is the
case on many planes. Tech. Sgt. Donn Clarius said there was no
failure of the hydraulic system.
   The Air Force had planned to fly the plane shortly after dawn
Tuesday, but the test was rescheduled for Wednesday because of
delays caused by wind and a long list of preflight checks, officials
said.
   The Air Force tried to fly the B-2 for the first time on July 15,
but the attempt was aborted by a low fuel pressure reading while the
bomber revved its engines awaiting clearance for takeoff. After the
flight was cancelled, workers checked the aircraft and discovered a
problem in a device called the heat exchanger in the bomber's fuel
system. The problem was fixed, but no details were available.
   During the plane's July 17 maiden flight, Hinds and Couch flew
the B-2 for nearly two hours and reached an altitude of 10,000 feet.
   The government has already invested about $22.4 billion in the
B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule, and Congress has
balked at the thought of paying more than $500 million apiece for
the 132 bombers the military wants.
   Congress imposed limits on the B-2 bomber despite fierce lobbying
efforts by the Bush administration to keep the program intact. House
and Senate members are scheduled to meet in conference in early
September to craft a final version of the defense authorization bill
and settle their differences over B-2 funding.

<TEXT>
   Port owners and longshoremen refused to
unload Canadian toxic waste from a Soviet freighter Wednesday, but
the British government insisted there was no danger.
   ``There is no reason whatsoever why on environmental grounds
these cargoes should not be handled,'' Environment Secretary Chris
Patten said. ``We haven't been and we're not going to be the dustbin
of the world.''
   Canada said later it would temporarily store the polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs, in Quebec province.
   The freighter Nadezhda Obukhova prepared to head back to Canada
on Thursday with a cargo of PCBs, loaded at Montreal. They had been
destined for destruction by a high-temperature incinerator in south
Wales.
   The Mersey Docks and Harbor Co., backing longshore leaders,
refused to handle the cargo after the Greenpeace environmental group
succeeded in blocking another PCB cargo at a Tilbury in south
England port, Tilbury.
   Tilbury turned away the consignment, also from Canada, after
protesters attached a skull and crossbones banner to the freighter
while television crews filmed from launches and helicopters.
   British newspapers have taken up the issue, with mass circulation
dailies carrying such headlines as ``Ship of Shame.''
   London's liberal Observer, usually sympathetic to Greenpeace,
accused it this week of ``going overboard.''
   Greenpeace is trying to block 15 consignments of PCBs from Canada
that the British disposal company Rechem has contracted to handle at
its South Wales plant in coming weeks.
   The company says it will ``defend its position.''
   In Quebec, Canada's environment minister, Lise Bacon, announced
Wednesday evening that will be put in a Hydro-Quebec storage
facility in the province. She said the PCBs will be taken to Manic
2, a power generating station about 20 miles west of Baie-Comeau,
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's hometown.
   ``This is a temporary solution as our goal is to dispose of the
toxic wastes,'' Ms. Bacon told a news conference.
   PCBs, which were used primarily to cool electrical transformers,
have been banned in North America because of links with cancer.
Government officials say Britain has the techniques to dispose of
the cargoes and has strict safety regulations for how they can be
imported.
   Greenpeace spokesman Tim Birch, waiting with 100 protesters when
the freighter docked at Liverpool's Royal Seaforth container
terminal Wednesday, said Britain was ``encouraging the global toxic
waste crisis'' by allowing the imports.
   Canada's only incinerator capable of handling PCBs is in Alberta
and does not accept waste from other provinces. For two years,
Canada has sent PCB waste from various sources to Britain for
destruction at its three licensed toxic-waste incinerators.

   President Bush intends to rally support for his
battle plan against drug abuse on Sept. 5 in his first nationally
televised speech as president, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   Bush, who has said he will announce a broad drug-fighting
strategy on that date, ``wanted to discuss it directly with the
American people,'' said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The White House has not yet approached the television networks
and thus has not set a time for the speech, he said.
   ``The president felt it was a national strategy, an issue of
concern for all Americans and it will call for sacrifices and hard
work for all Americans,'' Fitzwater said aboard Air Force One as the
president flew to Miami.
   Fitzwater said the president, in a meeting Tuesday with his
Domestic Policy Council of Cabinet and senior advisers, signed off
on the broad planks of the strategy. But the spokesman added,
without elaborating, ``There's still some outstanding specifics'' to
be decided.
   Bush has made up his mind on the controversial issue that had
divided his advisers _ whether to withhold federal highway funds,
criminal justice assistance and other aid from states that do not
take steps such as revoking drug offenders' drivers' licenses and
putting in place adequate drug prevention and education programs at
schools, it was learned.
   However, it was not known which way the president had decided on
that point.
   Bush was to make the final decisions during his three-week
vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he headed after leaving
Miami Wednesday.
   The official said the anti-drug strategy envisions expanded use
of the U.S. military to help combat drugs at the source in foreign
countries, when those countries request assistance.
   He said that the price tag for what has been touted as a major
cross-agency program is being closely held by the Office of
Management and Budget.
   Bush said Tuesday that he would not reveal the cost before Sept.
5 and that decisions were still being made on what programs
elsewhere in government would have to be tightened to pay for an
expanded war on drugs. He said his plan would require ``commitment
and sacrifice and understanding '' by Americans.
   Nonetheless, there have been various reports of what the cost
would be. An administation official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday night the cost would be ``roughly a
billion'' dollars more than what Bush set down in his February
budget proposal.
   The Bush budget called for $5.5 billion for anti-drug spending
during the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, which would be a 21 percent
increase from this year's spending. The administration official's
report would imply spending of $6.5 billion, an increase of about 41
percent.
   On Wednesday, at a Miami fund-raising lunch for congressional
candidate Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Bush said, ``The No. 1 issue in
Miami, and the No. 1 issue across America, is drugs and the violent
crime they spawn.''
   ``A strong foreign policy, hopes and plans for our children and
our elderly, all our dreams and best intentions will be for naught
if we cannot win the war against the thunder in the streets and the
evil that men do,'' he said.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican state senator, will face
Democratic lawyer Gerald Richman in a special Aug. 29 election to
replace the late Rep. Claude Pepper.
   Drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett, has called for a
dramatic increase in drug treatment funds for 1990, according to a
draft of his national drug strategy.
   The draft obtained by The Associated Press revealed that Bennett
wanted $925 million for drug treatment next year, a 49 percent
increase over the $621 million in the current budget and a 26
percent increase over the $735 million that Bush had sought in his
budget request earlier this year.
   The draft also called for $1.2 billion for new prisons and the
expansion of federal prison capacity by 85 percent, and for
increases in most law enforcement efforts, including an additional
$200 million for a total of $350 million for state and local
enforcement efforts.
   In addition, Bennett sought $1.2 billion for prevention efforts,
a 28 percent over current spending.
   The draft strategy also called for spending $50 million for the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, $45 million of which
would be used for security improvements.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer decided Wednesday to
spare the life of condemned murderer Ronald Monroe although ``the
evidence is persuasive to me that he is guilty.''
   Monroe, 34, was to have died in the electric chair on Aug. 30 for
the 1977 death of his landlady, Lenora Collins, who was stabbed
repeatedly while her two children watched. They later testified that
Monroe was the killer.
   Monroe, labeled by his attorneys as borderline mentally retarded,
had exhausted all appeals. He has insisted he is innocent for more
than a decade.
   The commutation means that Monroe must serve the rest of his life
in prison without a chance for parole, Roemer said.
   Roemer's decision came after private meetings with defense
attorneys, prosecutors and with one of the victim's children,
Theodise Collins, 24.
   Defense attorneys contended that Lenora Collins was killed by an
ex-boyfriend, George Stinson. They say Stinson admitted the murder
in 1980 to a cellmate in a Michigan prison. Stinson has a history of
stabbing women and of intimidating witnesses, the defense said.
   Defense attorney Douglas Morris said that Stinson intimidated the
Collins children so they would identify Monroe as the killer.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, considering the defense
claims last year, said there was no evidence to back up the
allegations.
   The panel noted that Stinson was given immunity and testified
that while serving time in Michigan for fatally stabbing his
common-law wife he told a cellmate that Lenora Collins died in a
similar fashion ``but he did not say or imply that he personally had
any guilt in her (Collins') death.''
   Roemer talked at length to Theodise Collins Wednesday about
Stinson.
   ``He asked me whether I was positive about the person who killed
my mother,'' she told reporters later. ``My response was, of course,
Ronald Monroe. He asked if I had been mentally, physically or
sexually abused by anyone (in connection with the case), especially
George Stinson. My reply, of course, was no.''
   Roemer said he felt the two juries that tried Monroe were wrong
to give him the death sentence.
   ``The developments in this case have been several, which say that
Ronald Monroe had no evidence of criminal activities, zero,'' Roemer
said. ``Ronald Monroe had lived in that house next door for years
with no violence. ...
   ``While there is guilt for Monroe, in an execution in this
country, the test ought not be reasonable doubt. The test ought to
be is there any doubt. ... He met the test for guilty but not
execution.''
   Collins said if Roemer decided to stop the execution, she would
not be angry, although she felt Monroe should die.
   ``He (Roemer) has a job he has to do,'' she said. ``I don't think
the question is whether Ronald Monroe is guilty or not. I think it's
exactly what are we supposed to do with him now.''

   Police on Wednesday said a West
German free-lance photographer arrested under anti-terrorism laws
has been charged with a weapons offense.
   A spokesman at Belfast police headquarters said the photographer
was charged Wednesday, but the spokesman would not specify the
firearms offense or identify him by name.
   Sporadic rioting broke out in Roman Catholic areas of west
Belfast Wednesday night, police reported. They said supporters of
the Irish Republican Army in isolated attacks threw gasoline bombs
and rocks at security forces but that no injuries or arrests were
reported.
   In Armagh, near the border with the Irish Republic, the IRA blew
up a Protestant-owned gas station with a car packed with explosives
on Tuesday night. It said the bombing was punishment for supplying
police vehicles. No one was injured.
   Earlier Wednesday, Britain deported Martin Galvin, a leading
American supporter of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, who was
arrested in Northern Ireland on Tuesday for defying an order banning
him from British territory.
   Galvin, publicity director for the New York-based Irish Northern
Aid Commiteee, or Noraid, was flown to the United States from a
Royal Air Force base near London.
   News of the photographer's arrest broke amid complaints by
officials that some foreign cameramen are provoking riots.
   Dozens of foreign television crews are in Northern Ireland to
cover this week's 20th anniversiary of the deployment in British
troops in the province, which is torn by Roman Catholic-Protestant
strife.
   A police spokesman said the West German photographer was arrested
early Tuesday in Catholic West Belfast and is being held under
Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act. A British Broadcasting Corp.
television report identified the photographer as Dick Vogel.
   Police refused to comment on British news reports that police
found smoke bombs and other missiles in the trunk of his car.
   The spokesman said a French photographer was also arrested
Tuesday but later released.
   Local news photographers supported charged the presence of
foreign photographers has prolonged relatively routine
stone-throwing in Roman Catholic areas. The British Broadcasting
Corp. said that in some cases cameramen actively encouraging
youngsters to riot for the pictures.
   The Belfast Press Photographers Association said in a statement
that in Northern Ireland, ``news does not need to be manufacturued.''
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in Northern
Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.

<HEAD>Former Prime Minister Begin Hospitalized</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin was
hospitalized for medical tests on Wednesday after complaining of
fatigue, doctors said.
   Begin, who turned 76 on Saturday, was admitted to Shaarei Tzedek
Hospital and will stay for ``a day or two,'' said Dr. Jonathan
Halevy, the hospital's director.
   ``He complained for the last few days about some fatigue, but
nothing specific,'' Halevy said.
   Halevy said initial tests ``were negative, meaning nothing was
found.''
   ``I expect him to be released within a day or two,'' he said.
   Reports of Begin's hospitalization were carried on state
television and radio newscasts. Army radio described him as
``walking around'' and ``in a good mood.''
   Begin was admitted to the same hospital in April 1987 after
complaining of weakness. He was discharged after 10 days of medical
tests.
   Begin, the former leader of Israel's right-wing Likud bloc, came
to power in 1977. He resigned without warning in September 1983 and
since has lived in seclusion in Jerusalem.
   At the time, aides said Begin was depressed about the death of
his wife and about Israel's protracted involvement in Lebanon after
its 1982 invasion of that country.
   Israel was widely criticized for the invasion and three-year
occupation of southern Lebanon.
   Begin suffered several heart attacks while prime minister and
underwent prostate surgery in 1986.
   Begin seldom speaks in public. His last public statement was on
July 9, when he condemned a Palestinian attack on an Israeli
passenger bus that killed 16 people and injured 25. Most victims
were Israelis.

<HEAD>Phone Talks End With No Progress</HEAD>

   Two of the nation's four strikebound Baby Bell companies held
informal talks with telephone workers Wednesday, but both meetings
ended with no progress reported in the 11-day-old walkout.
   The Communications Workers of America and NYNEX met at an
undisclosed location in the New York area for the first time since
picket lines went up Aug. 5in the dispute over wages and company
plans to cut back health benefits.
   Wednesday's meeting ended in part because neither side would
shift its position on whether workers should pay for part of their
health insurance, officials said.
   In Washington, CWA spokesman Bill Bickers said informal talks
occurred between union officials and another regional telephone
company, Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, but there was no progress
to report.
   ``There's a lot of concern that the company has not moved yet,''
Bill Bickers said. ``The union would really like to see some
movement from the company so we can get on with negotiations.''
   Bickers said no further talks were planned.
   The companies affected by the strikes are:
   _NYNEX, which serves about 50 percent of New York state, a small
part of Connecticut and the five other New England states. Its
companies have 60,000 workers on strike. Some 10.3 million customers
are affected.
   _Bell Atlantic, which has subsidiaries serving 12.7 million
customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia,
West Virginia and the District of Columbia. It has 52,000 workers on
strike.
   _San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, whose two subsidiaries
serve 13.2 million customers in parts of California and all of
Nevada. More than 40,000 CWA members are striking.
   _Chicago-based Ameritech, which owns companies serving 12 million
customers in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan. It has
35,000 employees belonging to the CWA on strike. Ameritech
subsidiaries in each state are negotiating separately with the
union. An additional 12,500 employees, members of the IBEW, have
ratified agreements with the companies.
   No talks were scheduled in the Ameritech and Pacific Telesis
strikes.
   Three other so-called Baby Bells _ the regional phone companies
formed out of the breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
Bell System _ have reached settlements with the CWA and the IBEW.
They are Atlanta-based Bell South, Denver-based US West and St.
Louis-based Southwestern Bell.
   NYNEX said in the statement that the company was prepared to
bargain on ``the entire package of wages, benefits and pension and
all other issues.''
   But NYNEX spokesman John Bonomo said NYNEX will not change its
position that the workers must share the cost of their health
insurance.
   Clara Allen, a CWA spokeswoman, said the union was adamantly
against workers sharing the cost of their health benefits.

<HEAD>Reindeer Herders in Soviet Nuclear Test Area Ravaged by Radiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cancer and lung disease, the legacies of Soviet
nuclear tests carried out decades ago, are ravaging the reindeer
herders who live across the Bering Strait from Alaska, a Moscow
weekly reported Wednesday.
   The cancer rate among natives of the Chukotka peninsula is 2-3
times higher than the national average, virtually the entire
population suffers from tuberculosis and 90 percent from chronic
lung disease, Moscow News said.
   It said the general radiation level on the peninsula was at least
twice as high as normal and equal to the average dose received by
people living in areas around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
   In part because of their drastically reduced immunity, the
average lifespan of the natives, known as the Chukchi, is only 45
years, Moscow News reported.
   The article attributed the unusual radiation to nuclear tests
carried out in the 1950s and 1960s.
   ``Peaceful hunters and reindeer herders who in no way
participated in the conflict of the superpowers are now paying the
most for big politics,'' Moscow News said.
   The authors of the article, Dr. Vladimir Lupandin and historian
Yevdokia Gayer, said they visited one village on Chukotka where they
were told virtually every resident had cancer.
   Scientists measured up to 100 times the normal amount of some
radioactive elements in some deer hunters, the article said.
   Infant mortality is also especially high among the natives, with
up to 100 deaths per 1,000 infants, the Moscow News said.
   The Chukchi, a Mongoloid people inhabiting the northeastern-most
portion of Siberia, traditionally settle in small groups and live
off hunting and fishing.
   The article in the Moscow News was one of many to appear in the
Soviet media recently denouncing the conditions in which the peoples
of the Soviet Far North live.

   The state's request for testimony on the
destruction of Exxon oil-spill records has been denied again, and
the attorney general said Wednesday he will not pursue the dispute
further.
   The dispute began in July when Kenneth Davis, a fired computer
operator for Exxon Co. USA in Houston, admitted he had accidentally
destroyed the computerized records. He said his superiors were
negligent in protecting them.
   Attorney General Douglas Baily said then the destruction was
``potentially a loss of devastating proportions'' to the state's
investigation of the nation's worst oil spill.
   A judge last month granted the state a hearing to question Exxon
employees involved in the records destruction, but two days later he
canceled the hearing and ordered Exxon to explain what happened in
affidavits instead.
   Exxon officials said the destroyed records were on obsolete
backup tapes and that other copies existed in computer archives. In
court documents, Exxon said the backup tapes were routinely
``recycled.''
   Davis disputed Exxon's version of the incident in an affidavit.
The state also obtained an affidavit from a contract employee who
had worked on Exxon's computer system. The employee termed Exxon's
affidavits misleading, said Fred Boness, an attorney for the state.
   Baily, dissatisfied with Exxon's explanation, asked the court
again to let the state take testimony from Exxon employees. Superior
Court Judge Brian Shortell denied the request without comment in an
order signed Friday.
   Shortell and Exxon attorneys did not return phone calls for
comment Wednesday.
   Baily said the state could have gained a more thorough
understanding of the records incident if it had been allowed to
question Exxon employees under oath.
   ``I'm still reluctant to accept the representations of Exxon,''
he said.
   The judge's decision effectively ends the dispute for now. The
issue remains alive, however, in a lawsuit Davis filed last month
against Exxon, alleging the oil company wrongfully fired and
slandered him.
   Baily said a pretrial hearing will be held within the next few
weeks in the state's negligence lawsuit filed Tuesday against Exxon
Corp., and about 140 other lawsuits related to the March 24 oil
spill in Prince William Sound.
   With the many lawyers involved, a large degree of cooperation
will be necessary to prevent the process from getting bogged down,
he said. The state's lawsuit, which also names the six other oil
companies that own Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., is expected to
bring in more attorneys.
   The state has had up to 25 lawyers working on its case, Baily
said.

<HEAD>Three Leftists To Stand Trial For Plotting To Overthrow Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three militants of the Marxist
opposition party will stand trial in October for allegedly plotting
a coup earlier this year.
   Senior High Court Magistrate Ramraj Jagnandan ruled Tuesday night
that the three farmers from the country's eastern district of
Demerara conspired to overthrow the government of President Desmond
Hoyte by force.
   The announcement came after six weeks of hearings in which
defense lawyers and the prosecution debated the admissibility of
confession statements allegedly made by Bhokpertap Singh, Karran
Persaud Deokarran and Neville Wordsworth.
   The defense alleged police had kidnapped the men from their homes
in May, tortured them for a week, forced them to confess, then
announced their detention publicly.
   The confession statements were accepted by the court, a decision
criticized from opposition parties.
   The three militants of the Marxist People's Progressive Party are
in prison awaiting trial.
   The government's case rests on allegations that the men conspired
with others to train people to make explosives and use firearms.
   Their arrest in May came just a few days after Hoyte warned of a
plot to topple his government. His People's National Congress has
ruled this South American nation since independence from Britain in
1966. The opposition has regularly accused it of rigging elections.
   In April and May, Guyana was rocked by a six-week strike, food
riots and arson attacks on public buildings. The unrest was
triggered by government austerity measures, including a devaluation
of the Guyana dollar, which prompted a 300 percent increase in food
prices.

   A grenade exploded on a busy street
Wednesday morning, injuring two people, police said. It was the
latest in a series of terrorist attacks over the past two months.
   Bombings on Tuesday night damaged the headquarters of two human
rights organizations.
   No organization has claimed reponsibility for any of the attacks,
which have killed two people and injured dozens of others, but
President Vinicio Cerezo recently blamed rightist forces. Right-wing
political parties reject the assertion.
   David Aguilar, a fire department spokesman, said that
unidentified assailants threw a grenade on a busy street Wednesday
morning, injuring two passers-by.
   Both were hit by flying fragments when the grenade went off,
Aguilar said. He added that both were taken to a hospital for
medical attention.
   The attack came after the headquarters of two human rights groups
were bombed Tuesday night.
   At Brigades for Peace, none of the five people in the building at
the time was injured, said Tomas, who answered the phone at the
office. He did not give his last name.
   Brigades for Peace, which has affiliated groups around the world,
searches for peaceful solutions to conflicts.
   Another organization, Help Group, was bombed Tuesday night. It is
made up of people whose family members have been kidnapped. Help
Group's president, Nineth Montenegro de Garcia, said 15 young people
were in the building when it was bombed, but they were not injured.
   The wave of bombings began June 19, when unidentified attackers
bombed private television station Channel 7, killing a technician.

<HEAD>Abused Gorilla Babies Get Special Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROOKFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keepers at Brookfield Zoo have been
donning gorilla suits and expertly aping simian behavior in an
effort to succor a couple of abused gorilla infants.
   The zoo's gorilla family has been in a turmoil since the reigning
silverback male, Samson, died in March 1988, leaving the clan
leaderless. His offspring, Kwizera, a 16-month-old female, and
Kwisha, a male about the same age, were injured when they were
infants, then rejected by their mothers.
   As a result, keepers at the zoo southwest of Chicago were given
the job of putting on a gorilla suit and spending countless hours
acting as surrogate mothers to the battered infants.
   ``Zoo policy is to leave all babies with their mothers _ to let
their mothers raise them,'' said Dr. Anne Baker, the zoo's curator
of primates.
   ``The past three months, we've been trying to reintroduce our two
infant gorillas to their moms, after we had to take the babies away
for their own safety,'' said Ms. Baker.
   While abuse of the young is not ordinarily a problem in gorilla
society, Kwisha got a broken arm in a tug of war between his mother
and a childless female gorilla who tried to steal the infant.
   After a veterinary surgeon fixed the arm, the keepers tried to
give Kwisha back to his mother.
   ``She picked him up, then put him back down and no longer would
touch him,'' said Ms. Baker. ``We kept trying, but she wouldn't pick
him up.''
   ``She wasn't aggressive toward him. I suspect her refusal had
something to do with his inability to cling. His one arm was
functionless, and gorilla infants stay with their mothers by holding
on very tightly to that fur.''
   With Kwisha abandoned, the zoo staff had no choice but to raise
the infant.
   Kwizera's story was a little different. She was injured somehow,
perhaps by her mother, Babs, rolling over on her while sleeping, and
sustained some slight brain damage.
   The youngster acted neurotic, sitting with her arms clenched to
her chest and her thumbs held tightly in her fists.
   ``And every time her mother touched her, Kwizera screamed,'' said
Ms. Baker.
   Kwizera was taken from her mom and treated for a fever.
   About a week later she was given back to Babs, who then ignored
her.
   Kwizera persisted in trying to cuddle up, but Babs finally had it
and wheeled about and bit her daughter on the face and rump.
   Suddenly the the zoo had two baby gorillas they had to raise. One
keeper suggested buying stuffed gorillas and putting them with the
babies. This idea evolved into the gorilla suit.
   ``We weren't sure what they'd learn from all this,'' Ms. Baker
said. ``But we wanted them to get used to the idea of something very
large, black and hairy.''
   Little by little, however, the young gorillas seem to be
improving and gaining acceptance back with the clan.
   Last week, Kwisha spent his first night alone with his mom. And
then a few days ago, Kwizera felt brave enough to walk into her
mother's cage, the keepers nervously standing by with fire hoses in
case Babs attacked her daughter again.
   But all went well, and the next day Kwizera was seen riding on
her mother's back.

   An Air Force pilot ejected from a fighter
jet moments before it crashed Wednesday in swampland south of
Homestead, Air Force officials said.
   Capt. Randall Harpe, 27, was treated for minor injuries at a
hospital on Homestead Air Force Base, about 25 miles south of Miami.
Air Force officials did not release the Harpe's specific injuries or
the cause of the F-16A crash.
   Air Force officers have interviewed Harpe and viewed the burned
wreckage of the jet, which narrowly missed power lines on its
descent shortly after noon.
   Lt. Terry Bowman said Harpe was preparing to land the $16 million
aircraft when he ejected. Harpe was on a routine training flight,
officials said.
   The jet crashed about 2{ miles from the base and about a mile
from a residental neighborhood and a high school. Harpe was picked
up about a mile west of the crash site by a Homestead police officer.
   Harpe was on a routine training flight, said officials.
   Military police with combat rifles kept civilians from the
wreckage. Television news helicopters were run off by military
aircraft.

   Police fired tear gas Wednesday to
disperse supporters and opponents of Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq who
battled on the eve of the first anniversary of the president's death
in a plane crash.
   Police said no one was injured in the clash at a shopping area of
Rawalpindi, 12 miles south of Islamabad.
   The clash was between supporters of the governing Pakistan
Peoples Party of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and members of the
opposition Islamic Democratic Alliance, which supported Zia, police
said.
   Zia and his top military officials died on Aug. 17, 1988 in an
unexplained air crash that also killed U.S. Ambassador Arnold
Raphel. Investigators blamed the crash on sabotage but never
assigned responsibility.
   Zia's family and the political opposition will mark the
anniversary Thursday with a memorial service at Islamabad's Faisal
Mosque, where Zia is buried. Organizers have said they expect
thousands will attend.
   Hundreds of people were camped near the mosque on Wednesday.
   Faisal Avenue, which leads to the mosque, has been decorated with
large portraits of Zia and banners praising his services to Islam,
Pakistan and the anti-communist war in Afghanistan.
   Portraits of political opposition leader Nawaz Sharif, chief
minister of Punjab, are also displayed along the route.
   Hundreds of policemen and guards have been called to Islamabad
and many parts of the capital have been closed to visiting mourners.
   The government has asked its supporters not to mourn, but rather
to commemorate Aug. 17 as the end of Zia's 11-year military rule.
   Zia overthrew former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir
Bhutto's father, in a 1977 military coup. Bhutto was hanged two
years later after a show trial convicted him of ordering the
assassination of a political rival.

<HEAD>Study Shows Treatment Prolongs Life Of Prostate Cancer Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new treatment can extend by 7.3 months the
average life of victims of prostate cancer, the No. 1 male cancer in
the nation, a University of Colorado study has found.
   ``This (is) not a cure, not a quantum leap forward,'' said Dr. E.
David Crawford, who coordinated the study of 617 patients at health
centers around the nation. It is ``a step in the right direction and
one that we feel is important,'' he said.
   The study was detailed in the Thursday issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   Crawford, an associate director of the University of Colorado
Cancer Center, said the treatment is for what he called ``an ignored
male disease.''
   ``This year it surpassed lung cancer as the No. 1 cancer in
men,'' he said. He said about 103,000 males in the United States
develop prostate cancer each year, and 28,000 die.
   ``We increased survival rates by patients 7.3 months or 27
percent,'' Crawford said. ``We did that without adding any extra
toxicity.'' The current survival rate is about 2{ years.
   He said the cancer is curable if caught early enough, but most
men do not see their physicians for checkups regularly enough to do
so. The treatment in the study is for those who have the more
advanced cancer, which spreads to other parts of the body, usually
bones.
   ``Prostate cancer right now is where breast cancer was 10-15
years ago,'' Crawford said.
   At the advanced stage, it is not curable but is controllable, he
said.
   Crawford said the treatment involves administering two drugs,
both of which work on the level of the male hormone, testosterone,
which is needed by the cancer cells to multiply.
   One drug, leuprolide, lowers the body's overall level of the
hormone, while the second, fultamide, blocks the receptors of the
cancer cells where testosterone connects, Crawford said.
   This was the ``first study in years to show a positive effect on
survival rate,'' he said.

died Tuesday of heart failure. He was 84.
   Genda was a graduate of Japan's naval academy, He was a young
aviation staff officer who was called in to plan for the attack on
the U.S. Pacific fleet in Hawaii that brought the United States into
the war.
   Genda directed much of the secret training in Japanese waters
before the attack and, on Dec. 7, 1941, he was aboard one of the
Japanese carriers that launched the raid on Pearl Harbor.
   In June 1942, Genda was involved with the unsuccessful Japanese
attack on Midway Island.
   After the war, he joined Japan's revived air force in 1954 and
became its chief of staff in 1959. After retiring from the military,
Genda was elected in 1962 to the upper house of Parliament for the
governing Liberal Democratic Party, and was re-elected three times
before he retired in 1986.

   The brother of a man identified by police as a
suspect in the Green River serial murder investigation said
Wednesday he has proof that his brother was on the East Coast when
the first victims disappeared.
   Robert Stevens said his brother, William Jay Stevens II, is
``more a scapegoat than he is a suspect'' in the ``reckless''
investigation by the Green River Task Force.
   ``I believe in my brother's innocence,'' Stevens said at a news
conference he held at a Spokane parish hall one block from his
ailing father's home. He gave reporters a list of credit card
charges and four photographs he said are from a month-long vacation
when William Stevens and his parents visited him and his family in
Connecticut in July 1982, during the time the first Green River
victims disappeared.
   Robert Stevens said he has given the information and photographs
to Green River Task Force investigators, who interviewed him at his
father's home Tuesday.
   William Stevens, 38, has not been charged in any of the 48 deaths
or disappearances of women between 1982 and 1984 linked to the Green
River serial killer. Stevens is completing a jail sentence in
Seattle for a 1979 burglary and 1981 escape from a work release
center.
   ``The task force has been reckless in their investigation and
have done nothing but harass my brother, family and friends,''
Robert Stevens said, complaining that investigators waited more than
seven months after William Stevens' arrest in January to contact him
for information about his brother's whereabouts during 1981-85.
   Task force officials did not return numerous phone calls
Wednesday.
   Police last month searched two Spokane residences where William
Stevens lived while attending Gonzaga University Law School.
Investigators carted away truckloads of materials, including a
collection of police badges, videotapes and other paraphernalia.
   In a lengthy affidavit used to obtain a search warrant,
authorities labeled Stevens ``a viable suspect in the Green River
homicides, and possibly others in the Pacific Northwest.''
   Robert Stevens said he only recently obtained a copy of the
affidavit and spent two weeks compiling the information that he said
clears his brother in the Green River investigation.
   Stevens said his family had decided to hold a news conference
before he was contacted by the task force Tuesday. He said he is
researching more information that will prove his brother was not in
the areas where other Green River victims disappeared at the time of
those crimes.
   His brother also accompanied his parents on a trip to Vancouver,
British Columbia, in late April 1984 around the time of another
Green River disappearance, Stevens said.
   Stevens, 37, a senior chief petty officer at the U.S. Navy's
submarine base at Bangor, is on temporary humanitarian leave to care
for his father, who is recovering from surgery.
   William Stevens walked away from a Seattle work release facility
where he was completing a one-year sentence in 1981 for burglary of
a police equipment store. Since then, Stevens used several aliases
while living at Vancouver, British Columbia, Portland, Ore., and
Spokane, where he was in the fourth and final year of law school
when re-arrested in January.
   His name was one of several that surfaced after the nationally
syndicated show ``Manhunt'' television program aired Dec. 8 on the
Green River slayings.
   Robert Stevens said he knew his brother had been in jail but was
unaware he was a fugitive when he drove his parents to New England
in 1982.
   The Green River investigation takes its name from the river south
of Seattle where the bodies of the first five victims were found in
1982. The killer is believed responsible for the deaths of at least
40 women and is suspected in the disappearances of eight others in
Washington and Oregon from 1982 to 1985.

   About 100 students blocked a street
and hurled rocks and sticks at police Wednesday to protest the
closing of three high schools where pupils demonstrated against Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's government.
   No injuries were reported. Witnesses said they saw armed men
dressed in civilian clothes detain one student during the two-hour
clash on a street between the University of Panama and the Arts and
Trades College.
   Police fired tear gas to try to break up the protest. At least
twice, the students, from 13 to 16 years old, picked up unexploded
cannisters and tossed them back at police. Several policemen were
visibly affected by the gas.
   A torrential rain ended the demonstration.
   Students said they blocked Bolivar Street to protest the
indefinite closing of two high schools in Chiriqui, in the western
part of the country, and one in Colon, 50 miles north of Panama
City, after anti-government demonstrations last week.
   The Education Ministry has warned that it will close any school
where there are disturbances in the weeks before the scheduled
change of government Sept. 1.
   One student died and several others were injured at the
university Aug. 3 when police fired birdshot to break up a
demonstration.
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma's term expires Sept. 1, but
the lack of a successor threatens to create a vacuum in the
government.
   International observers say the opposition defeated the
government presidential candidate by a landslide in May 7 elections,
which the government annulled.
   The opposition is demanding its victory be recognized so it can
take power and that Noriega step down as chief of the Defense
Forces, a post that makes him the country's de facto leader.
   Government and military representatives have refused both
demands, but continued talks with the opposition on Wednesday.
   An Organization of American States mission that has been
mediating the talks is to report on progress on Aug. 23.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida on U.S. drug trafficking and
money laundering charges. He denies the charges.

   Many who lost loved ones in the nation's
second-worst air disaster fear they'll relive the tragedy when
liability suits come to trial in October, said a member of a support
group for relatives of crash victims.
   Northwest Flight 255 crashed at Detroit Metropolitan Airport in
suburban Romulus on the hot, humid night of Aug. 16, 1987, killing
154 people on board and two people on the ground.
   The jet failed to gain altitude during takeoff and slammed into
an overpass on Interstate 94. The sole survivor was Cecelia Cichan,
then 4.
   The little girl is living with her aunt and uncle, Rita and Frank
Lumpkin, in Birmingham, Ala., shielded from media inquiries. She
lost her mother, father and 6-year-old brother in the crash.
   About 300 people, family and friends of the dead, met on a grassy
hillside overlooking Middlebelt Road at Interstate 94, where the
jetliner broke apart in flames moments after takeoff.
   ``As long as some of us can manage to walk up that hill, we will
be here,'' said the Rev. Ron Lund, who heads a survivors' support
group.
   The site has been decorated with wooden carvings of white-painted
doves, each bearing a victim's name and arranged to form the number
``255.'' For a second consecutive year, survivors who met at the
hillside held small flashlights to illuminate the flight number at
8:46 p.m. EDT _ the time of the crash.
   ``All the people here _ they know what you've experienced. They
know how you feel,'' said Nancy Engelhart of Bay City, whose sister,
brother-in-law and two nephews died in the crash.
   The two years haven't erased the pain, she said. ``It's hard to
get used to. You still expect to see them walk through the door,''
she said of Sue Byelich, 48, Don Byelich, 46, and their sons Mike,
16, and Brad, 14.
   ``I would say the first year was a breeze compared to the second
year. It's like reality has set in,'' said Betty Polec, an organizer
of Flight 255: Their Spirit Lives On, a support group for those who
lost relatives and friends in the crash.
   ``We have the memories of our loved ones, but they are so
painful,'' she said. ``And it's getting closer to the trial and
that's going to open up the wounds again.''
   The liability trial is set for Oct. 2 in U.S. District Court in
Detroit. Northwest attorney Carroll Dubuc says it could take four to
five months to settle the 102 suits pending against Northwest and
McDonnell Douglas, which built the MD-80 plane that crashed.
   Forty-six suits have been settled, Dubuc said.
   Officials for Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, say
the company has rebounded from the disaster. A record number of
passengers are expected to fly Northwest this year. Record profits
of $35.5 million were reported in 1988.
   ``The passage of time tends to make an event like that less vivid
in the minds of traveler,'' Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said.
``Most airlines that experience this sort of tragedy note a decline
in passengers immediately after the accident, but normal levels
return shortly thereafter.''
   In May, the nation's fourth-largest airline launched a new
corporate identity program, complete with a new logo, repainted jets
and new uniforms for flight attendants. Gibbons says the changes
were made to spruce up the image of the expanding company and
unrelated to the crash.
   At Detroit Metropolitan Airport, emergency plans have been
altered and fine-tuned as a result of the tragedy.
   Some of the lessons learned two years ago will be used during a
mock disaster drill in September, said Mark Sparks, director of the
Emergency Management Division for the Wayne County Sheriff's
Department.
   The sheriff's department has arranged for a hotel to house
families of passengers in the event of a plane crash, and a corps of
multilingual chaplains of all denominations has been established to
console families.

   The moon plunges into the Earth's shadow
tonight, creating the first total lunar eclipse visible in North
America since 1982, and thousands of telescopes are awaiting a
celestial show of light and color.
   The eclipse will start at 8:23 p.m. EDT when the Earth's shadow
appears to take its first nip from the full moon, and will end about
5{ hours later.
   The last full lunar eclipse visible over North America was in
December 1982, and the next one will not occur until December 1992.
   If the skies are clear, East Coast residents will get the best
view. The moon will be overhead with twilight ending just as the
eclipse begins.

   The Bush administration is engaging the Kremlin
in a mild war of words over attempts by Poland's Solidarity trade
union to form a non-communist government in that Soviet bloc country.
   ``Questions involving the government of Poland are properly an
internal affair,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Tuesday. He was using a diplomatic formula that recalled the flavor
but not the intensity of 1980-81, when Solidarity last challenged
the Polish Communist Party, leading to martial law.
   In Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravda warned that
efforts by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to form a non-communist
government were ``against the principles of parliamentary
democracy'' and ``could lead to a prolonged political crisis.''
   ``The opposition has changed its strategy and has taken the
course of an immediate seizure of power,'' Pravda said. The
commentary noted that fixing the Polish economy required a coalition
of political forces, including the communists.

   The Bush administration, seeking ways to boost
the U.S. savings rate to cure a variety of economic ills, appears to
be inching closer to recommending increased tax incentives for
thrifty Americans.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills added her support to the
idea Tuesday, saying that expanding Individual Retirement Accounts
would make her job of reducing America's huge trade deficits easier.
   Millions of American savers could benefit through expanded IRAs,
which enjoyed great popularity earlier in the decade, but it could
cost the U.S. Treasury billions of dollars in lost tax revenue.
   Hills, in an interview with reporters, stressed that she was not
signaling an imminent administration announcement on IRAs. However,
other officials said a proposed increase in tax incentives for IRAs
is high on the list of options being studied by the administration.

   In an ethnically tense battle to succeed the late
Rep. Claude Pepper, a lawyer won the Democratic nomination using a
theme that he's running for ``an American seat.''
   His Cuban-born Republican opponent called his victory ominous.
   The winner was Gerald Richman, a 47-year-old former Florida Bar
Association president making his first run for office. Richman
gathered much of his strength from a heavy majority of the diverse
district's white non-Hispanic voters in a 61-39 percent victory over
Rosario Kennedy.
   Richman moves on to an Aug. 29 special election against state
Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Cuban-born as is Ms. Kennedy, for the seat
left vacant by Pepper's death May 30 at age 88.

   Newspapers are being flooded with anonymous letters
from an unusual source _ disgruntled gendarmes, the military
corpsmen who make up almost half of France's 200,000 police officers.
   Government officials have replied by saying reforms will be
proposed this fall, and in the meantime the gendarmes should think
about the soldier's duty not to air the military's dirty laundry in
public.
   National and regional newspapers have received dozens of letters,
each purporting to speak for a large number of gendarmes who are
unhappy about pay scales, long hours and poor living conditions in
barracks.
   The 90,000 gendarmes are responsible for police duties on most
French highways and in rural areas, although they also sometimes
patrol in cities. Special squads fight terrorism, monitor river
traffic and patrol airports, among other tasks.

   When Roy Clark first visited this community
nestled in a lush Ozark Mountain valley eight years ago, the country
music entertainer couldn't believe his eyes.
   Vehicles bearing license plates from nearly every state stretched
bumper-to-bumper for miles on the winding main strip, creeping past
miniature golf courses, go-cart rides, water slides and arts and
crafts shops swarming with tourists.
   Clark also noticed long lines of people waiting to get into
country music theaters where local performers sang, put on skits and
told corny jokes in a wholesome, family atmosphere.
   ``I was amazed. I said, `What is this doing here in the middle of
nowhere?''' Clark says.
   The Grammy-winning guitarist and co-host of television's ``Hee
Haw'' had stumbled on what local promoters call the country music
show capital of the world.
   With about 20 glittery theaters lining Missouri 76, better known
as 76 Country Music Boulevard, Branson is also billed as the Las
Vegas of country music _ but with an emphasis on family.
   ``You can see more Nashville stars in Branson than you can in
Nashville or anywhere else,'' boasts Bill Jones, executive manager
of the local chamber of commerce.
   The list of performers appearing in Branson this summer reads
like a Who's Who of country music: Barbara and Louise Mandrell, Mel
Tillis, Ray Stevens, Dolly Parton, Mickey Gilley, Tammy Wynette,
Janie Fricke, Pat Boone, Conway Twitty, Ricky Skaggs, Rodney
Crowell, the Gatlin Brothers, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, Highway 101,
Ronnie Milsap, Tom T. Hall, Porter Waggoner and Moe Bandy.
   City officials estimate that at least 3.25 million people saw
country music shows in Branson last year during the peak June-August
tourist season. Several theater owners say business is even better
this year, and Clark is considering staying open year-round instead
of closing in the winter months.
   ``I found out after I became acquainted with Branson that
everyone else in life knew about it but me,'' Clark said. ``I run
into people in almost every state who say they plan Branson every
year as part of their vacation.''
   Branson has a population of 2,500, but on a typical summer day
tourists swell the southwest Missouri town to 30,000 or more.
   Jones predicts that 5 million people will visit Branson this
year, up 1 million from 1988. That's more people than annually visit
Yellowstone Park or the Grand Canyon.
   Vacationers are drawn by the breathtaking mountain scenery, the
camping, fishing and boating available at several huge lakes nearby,
and two old-time theme parks, Silver Dollar City and Shepherd of the
Hills.
   And, of course, they come to hear country music. From theaters
seating a few hundred people to an outdoor ampitheater with a
capacity of 15,000, Branson offers more than 40,000 seats for
country music shows.
   Clark liked what he saw in Branson and spent $12 million to build
a 1,200-seat theater and a 191-room hotel and convention center
featuring a smaller Las Vegas-style showroom.
   He was the first to regularly feature top-name entertainers. Soon
Freddy Fender, Boxcar Willie and Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass
opened theaters along the heavily developed strip, where land is
scarce and commands more than $2,000 a square foot.
   ``It's no longer possible for anyone to come in and start a
theater on a shoestring,'' Jones says. ``It's now become big
business and big money.''
   Clark, who plays about 30 dates a year in his own club, compares
Branson to the atmosphere that existed in Nashville, the recording
capital of country music, 50 years ago.
   ``Not to take away from Nashville, but Nashville is commercial,''
said Clark, relaxing in his plush travel bus after a matinee
performance at his Roy Clark Celebrity Theatre.
   ``Here, the music industry is treated in its true art form. I've
often said the most fun I've ever had in my life was when I played
for free. You're not performing, you're just playing country music.
That's sort of the attitude of country music in Branson.''
   Several of the shows are family operations. The Mabe family has
run and starred in their Baldknobbers Hillbilly Jamboree for 30
years, initially starting with 25 folding chairs. Today the
Baldknobbers play to packed audiences in a 1,700-seat theater.
   ``There was a lot of worry about the future of these family run
theaters when the big-name stars came to the area,'' said Tommy
Bilyeu, a member of the Baldknobbers' show for the last 20 years.
``But the more shows that come in, the more our business grows.''
   Branson's country music success can be partly attributed to its
central location.
   ``Our major market is the haven of country music, the Midwest and
Southwest,'' Jones said. ``People from Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma and
Louisiana through the ages have been our big drawing cards.''
   In addition, country and bluegrass music have flourished in these
rugged Ozark hills for years. Many country stars got their start on
``Ozarks Jubilee,'' a live nationally televised show in the 1950s
that originated in Springfield.
   If Pat Boone has his way, Branson will step further into the
national country spotlight. Boone says he's working to develop a
television show such as ``Ozark Jubilee'' that would be based in
Branson. His wife, Shirley, was the daughter of ``Jubilee'' host Red
Foley.
   ``I think the time is right for it,'' he said.

<HEAD>City, Rural Budget Tradeoff Highlighted by Airline Subsidy Dispute</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   It's a tradeoff that helps to smooth the
process of governing: while the big money goes to the cities, small
town America gets a piece of the federal budget for its cherished
programs, even when they flunk efficiency formulas.
   That doesn't cost a lot and it can oil the machinery of Congress,
where some of the power brokers of the appropriations process are
veterans who come from rural districts.
   But the traditional bargain is running head-on into the federal
budget crunch these days, with spending caught between an
administration that vows no new taxes and a law that enforces
decreasing ceilings on the federal budget deficit.
   That strain was showing as the House dealt with transportation
appropriations just before its summer recess. The program at hand
was a rural favorite called Essential Air Service, under which
airlines get subsidies for maintaining flights in and out of small
cities.
   It was vital to the 1978 compromise in which Congress voted to
deregulate the airlines, giving them broad leeway to set their own
routes and fares. The program has been extended at least through
1998, but not the money to fund it. Appropriations are handled year
by year, and they have been shrinking.
   Congress voted $25 million in subsidies for the current fiscal
year; the bill approved by the House cuts that by more than half for
the next year.
   The administration wanted to do away with Essential Air Service
subsidies entirely; its budget says that subsidies were costing up
to $500 a passenger on flights in and out of some small airports,
most of them serving only a handful of passengers each day.
   The House bill appropriates $12.4 million for the program in a
bill that was designed to cut the number of communities getting air
passenger subsidies from 110 to 48.
   That was going to be done by setting new rules to limit the
subsidy to no more than $25 per passenger _ matching the estimated
cost of Amtrak rail subsidies _ and by denying air passenger
payments to any community within 100 miles of an airport that does
have service. That covered continental U.S. airports; Alaska would
not be affected.
   ``These criteria are reasonable and fair to rural America,''
argued Rep. William Lehman, D-Fla., chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee that shaped the bill. The new formula made it through
the appropriations committee by only one vote. On the House floor it
was erased by a point of order, because appropriations bills are
supposed to deal only in dollars, not in legislating rules for the
programs involved.
   Lehman said that without the restrictions, the program includes
abuses that make it indefensible. So the debate is sure to come
around again, in the Senate and in final House action.
   ``Over 45 percent, or 50 of the 110 communities in the
continental United States currently receiving subsidies emplane less
than 5 passengers a day under this program,'' said Lehman. ``. ..
Can anyone explain why the taxpayers should be paying $245,000 a
year to fly planes into Parsons, Kan., to haul an average of 0.6
passengers a day. ... Or can anyone justify paying $270,000 per year
to fly planes into Lewiston, Maine, to haul 0.9 passengers a day,
especially when another airport is 35 miles away?''
   But Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb., said the appropriation cut is
devastating to a program that already has been reformed. She said
earlier legislation ``eliminated the worse abuses'' by instituting a
subsidy limit of $300 a passenger.
   Then she offered some numbers that may be even more telling: 39
states have communities getting Essential Air Service subsidies, and
there are 68 congressional districts involved.
   Eleven cities and towns in Nebraska are among them, and Mrs.
Smith said she wants her constituents ``and all rural taxpayers'' to
know she isn't surrendering but will work to get the money restored.
   She said it would take another $19 million or $20 million, which
amounts to .02 percent of the total transportation appropriation, to
finance the rural air service subsidies.
   ``... Rural America, home to more than one-fourth of the
country's population, receives only $1 in federal mass
transportation funds for every $28 in mass transportation funds
spent in urban America,'' she added.

<HEAD>Student Rabbis Serve Isolated Congregations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When rabbinical student Amy Schwartzman began
serving a small Massachusetts congregation at age 23, she felt
handicapped by her youth and inexperience.
   ``A woman came to me for counseling about a career change,'' she
recalled. ``I've never even had a full-time job! And this women is
asking me for advice.''
   But after two years of handling Sabbath services, funerals, bar
mitzvahs and assorted life crises, Schwartzman is accustomed to her
role as spiritual _ albeit youthful _ leader of her Great Barrington
flock.
   She is one of 90 rabbis-in-training from Hebrew Union
College-Jewish Institute of Religion who spend one or two weekends a
month serving small Jewish communities around the nation.
   The only U.S. school for rabbis from the Reform branch of
Judaism, Hebrew Union has campuses in Manhattan, Cincinnati, Los
Angeles and Jerusalem.
   Aside from on-the-job training, the student pulpit program gives
the novice rabbis ``a sense of service to the Reform Judaism
movement. In some of these places, our students are keeping these
congregations alive,'' said Rabbi Norman Cohen, dean of the New York
campus.
   The 35-family Congregation Gates of Prayer in New Iberia, La.,
has been using Hebrew Union students since the 1940s.
   ``It's good for us and it's good for them,'' said Steve Lahasky,
congregation president. ``We give them all the consideration of a
fully ordained rabbi. If we need counseling, a bar or bat mitzvah or
the naming of a new baby, they're our rabbi.''
   Many of the congregations that use student rabbis are too remote
or too poor to attract full-time rabbis, who can earn $45,000 and
up. The students are a bargain at $9,000, plus transportation and
lodging. Some congregations even save on hotels by putting students
up in private homes, an arrangement that lacks privacy but creates
strong bonds.
   ``They want to talk to me about everything Jewish that they've
ever heard of, and I want to be there for them,'' said Schwartzman,
whose stays in congregants' homes have also included non-spiritual
pursuits like helping out with gardening and teaching kids to play
knock-hockey.
   ``The old people think of me almost as a granddaughter,'' she
said. ``The other side of it is I have a great connection with all
the kids.''
   Working in areas away from cities where Yiddish expressions and
Jewish food are part of mainstream culture also gives the students
``a different perspective on Jewish communities and their needs,''
said Cohen.
   Eric Weiss, who was ordained as a rabbi in June after serving the
Louisiana congregation, said ``getting to know Jews of the South''
was one of the best aspects of his Louisiana stint.
   ``They're not a part of a majority Jewish culture at all,'' he
said. ``It's not like being in New York or Los Angeles. They put a
lot of effort into their community because they can't rely on big
Jewish organizations'' to keep the religion alive.
   Peter Shaktman, 27, who served a Jupiter, Fla., congregation,
agreed.
   ``One of the frustrations of the rabbinate in general is working
with people who are apathetic and jaded,'' he said. ``One of the
ironies of these pulpits is that even though they're often small,
they really feel a certain mission about maintaining their
religion.''
   Assisting that mission can seem like an awesome responsibility.
   ``I'm the rabbi for a 25-mile radius and I'm not even a rabbi,''
said Stephen Weisman, 28, who served a 72-family congregation in
Fredericksburg, Va. ``They're coming to me, expecting me to be the
voice of knowledge and wisdom, when I have to learn from them and
all of their traditions.''
   Weisman says he ``fudged'' his first funeral, ``probably very
badly. The blessing of never having a death in my family, probably
was a curse.''
   He added, grinning: ``Then I had to do four funerals in one
month. Now I know how to do it inside out.''

   Four United Methodist Bishops met recently with
President Bush, reviving a custom that began two centuries ago but
which has been absent during recent administrations.
   Bishop Jack M. Tuell of Los Angeles, president of the
denomination's council of bishops, said the audience was sought to
commemorate the 1789 visit to George Washington by early Methodist
Bishops Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke.
   Such calls continued on a more or less regular basis until the
Richard Nixon administration.
   The bishops assured Bush of the prayers of United Methodists and
added in a statement read by Bishop Leroy C. Hodapp of Indianapolis,
``We are grateful for your strong Christian faith and your devotion
to the church.''
   Tuell said Bush, an Episcopalian, spoke of how much the church
means to him, noting he had missed services only two Sundays since
taking office.

   Rejecting the thesis that Jews

International Congress on World Evangelization said Jews need Jesus
``as much as anyone else.''
   In a manifesto, the congress of about 4,000 evangelicals from

   It ``would be a form of anti-Semitism, as well as being disloyal
to Christ, to depart from the New Testament pattern of taking the
Gospel to `the Jew first.'''
   The manifesto, appproved near the close of the 10-day congress
July 20, added, ``We wish to be sensitive to those of other faiths,
and we reject any approach that seeks to force conversion on them.''
   Repentance was expressed for past ``attitudes of ignorance,
arrogance, disrespect and even hostility'' toward those of other
faiths.
   But the manifesto rejects ``both the relativism that regards all
religions and spiritualities as equally valid approaches to God and
the syncretism that tries to mix faith in Christ with other faiths.''
   Asserting the ``uniqueness of Christ,'' the manifesto says,
``There is only one Gospel because there is only one Christ, who
because of his death and resurrection is himself the only way to
salvation.''

   Playwright Neil Simon says tickling the funny
bone is a better way to reflect reality than drama.
   ``I don't think about what I'm trying to reflect of the human
condition,'' said Simon, who is honored on PBS' ``American Masters''
next Monday.
   ``I've found that comedy is the best way for me to reflect my own
feelings. I think comedy can be more realistic than drama. But I do
like the mixture of comedy and drama in a play.''
   Simon, the author of 25 plays, is perhaps the world's most
successful playwright. Only one play, ``Actors and Actresses,'' was
scrubbed in tryouts before it reached Broadway. Many of them have
been made into motion pictures, in addition to the stories he's
written directly for the screen.
   ``Neil Simon: Not Just for Laughs'' examines his style of humor
and offers a portrait of Simon through interviews with actors,
directors and producers and a conversation with the playwright.
   The program includes excerpts from the film versions of such
plays as ``Barefoot in the Park,'' ``The Odd Couple,'' ``Plaza
Suite,'' ``Chapter Two'' and ``The Sunshine Boys.''
   The cameras followed Simon for five or six months: to a tribute
to the playwright at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel; to a comedy class
he taught with his brother, writer Danny Simon; and to theaters
where he put together his latest play, ``Rumors.''
   Many of his plays are inspired by aspects of his own life. Three
plays, ``Brighton Beach Memoirs,'' ``Biloxi Blues'' and ``Broadway
Bound'' tell of an aspiring young playwright named Eugene Jerome.
   ``Some plays deal with myself, some deal with friends of mine and
some are just picked out of the air,'' he said. ``My plays are never
autobiographical; otherwise, I would call the characters Neil Simon.
They're fictionalized experiences you remember.
   ``Eugene Jerome is essentially Neil Simon. Essentially, yes.
There is a catharsis in this. You don't go into it without purpose.
I think the most cathartic one was `Broadway Bound.' It dealt with
my relationship with my family in a more traumatic period. `Brighton
Beach Memoirs' was a sort of idealized version of that family life.''
   His current play on Broadway, ``Rumors,'' is a farce and
fast-paced comedy he wrote as a change of pace. Next up is ``Jake's
Women,'' which he said is a mixture of comedy and drama. He also has
written two movies for Disney, ``The Marrying Man'' and ``Heaven on
Earth.''
   Simon is a graduate of Sid Caesar's 1950s television show, ``Your
Show of Shows,'' a phenomenal breeding ground for comedy that also
produced such writers as Woody Allen, Larry Gelbart, Carl Reiner and
Mel Brooks. Afterward, Simon also wrote for ``Caesar's Hour.''
   ``I was so lucky to be able to work at that time with the best
performers and the best comedy writers,'' he said. ``That's what you
go to college for and I was getting paid for it.''
   Despite his success, or perhaps because of it, Simon has rarely
been taken seriously by the critics. ``I think by and large I've had
my fair shake from the critics,'' he said. ``You have to view it as
a total. I think the very fact that they're doing a program about me
indicates somebody is taking me seriously. When I say the critics
are fair with me that includes the negative reviews because
sometimes I agree with them.''
   Simon moved to Los Angeles in 1975, and since that time all of
his plays except ``Broadway Bound'' have opened on the West Coast
before going to New York. He said West Coast audiences are more
polite and generally arrive on time.
   ``I have an apartment in New York and do move back and forth,''
he said, ``but you reach a point in your life when you don't need
the energy of New York to write. You take it with you in your head.
I've never lost that sense of desire to write. If anything, out here
it's increased.''

<HEAD>American Express Gives Western Union Run For Its Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college student telephones his parents for cash
to cover an overdrawn check. A friend arrested in the dead of night
calls for help in scraping up bail money.
   Within minutes, if you're willing to pay the price, you can wire
financial aid just as corporate dealmakers routinely transfer
billions of dollars halfway around the world.
   Western Union Corp. remains the solid leader in this growing
consumer money-transfer business, although rivals are giving it a
run for the money.
   American Express Co., for example, introduced its MoneyGram
service about 1{ years ago. Smaller companies serve specific regions
or groups ranging from gamblers to truckers.
   Commercial banks also wire money, and even the U.S. Postal
Service is considering a high-speed money order service.
   ``It's the whole idea of speed. Consumers rely more and more on
getting things done faster,'' said Jay Giesen, a vice president of
marketing at the American Express Information Services Co.
subsidiary. ``The consumer market has yet to be fully tapped.''
   Trying to do just that, American Express just began its first
advertising blitz for the service recently. Like the company's pitch
for traveler's checks, the Moneygram ads appeal to people's fears.
   One shows a broke American teen stranded on the steps of a
European church on a cold, stormy night. Another shows an elderly
couple evidently distraught over an unexpected financial hardship. A
third shows a mother and daughter stuck at a remote bus station.
   Western Union, which has been in the money-transfer business
since 1871, is countering with a beefed-up ad campaign that includes
a TV spot showing a succession of mothers complaining about their
children's spending habits. The light-hearted ad includes a new
toll-free number for sending money by phone.
   All that competition could spell good news for harried,
bargain-hunting consumers who need to send or receive cash fast.
   The cheapest and easiest way to gain access to emergency cash is
through the bank automated teller machine network, where fees on
transactions range from 10 cents to $3. Many are free.
   But one major problem with this system is that daily cash
withdrawals usually are limited to $200 to $500. Another drawback is
that not everyone has an automated bank card.
   ``There are still many households in this country that don't even
have checking accounts,'' said Western Union spokesman Warren R.
Bechtel.
   For them, the main way to send fast emergency cash, albeit
expensive, is via the transmission service. Many Western Union and
American Express agents are open 24 hours; their telephone numbers
are available in the Yellow Pages.
   Only Western Union allows customers to send money over the
telephone, although it tacks on an extra finance charge. American
Express says it has no finance charge, but all transactions must be
done in person.
   Western Union has a computerized network of 13,500 agents
nationwide, including many all-night convenience stores,
supermarkets, hardware stores and hotels. American Express has
nearly 7,000 agents.
   Western Union says it wired around $3 billion last year, with the
average transaction at $300. American Express doesn't release these
figures but says its volume has risen steadily.
   Both companies promise money will be available domestically at
the receiving agent within 15 minutes. MoneyGram, however, claims to
offer more flexibility about where the money can be picked up.
   For these conveniences you must pay the price. Western Union and
American Express have graduated fee scales, where the more you send
the less you pay percentage-wise. But be careful: In some cases if
you send a penny over the limit you'll end up in the next bracket
and pay a substantialy higher fee.
   For instance, it costs $12 to send up to $50 via Western Union,
or 24 percent of the principal amount. The fee rises to $14 for
sending $50.01 to $100; to $21 for $101.01 to $200; and to $27 for
$300.01 to $400. The fee levels off at $3,000, costing $105, or 3.5
percent of the principal amount. Above that each additional $500 or
fraction thereof costs $20. Western Union says it doesn't limit the
amount of money that can be sent.
   For the MoneyGram service, fees range from $9 for sending up to
$50, or 18 percent of the principal amount, to $330 for sending a
maximum $10,000.
   Wiring money from bank to bank is often much cheaper, with the
sending bank charging from $10 to $20, but this service is only
available during banking hours.
   All fees are higher when wiring money internationally. It also
takes longer and the pickup spots are more limited.
   At Western Union, which is working to broaden its overseas
network, it can take up to two days. American Express says it can
deliver in a matter of hours but only with traveler's checks.

<HEAD>Stocks Vs. Gambling: The Long-Term View</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As America becomes more involved in betting,
sweepstakes, lotteries and the like, participation in the stock
market shrinks. It is a sign of the times. Make of it what you will.
   In gambling, the odds are overwhelmingly against you. In stocks,
chosen wisely and held for the long term, the chances of winning
rather than losing are heavily in your favor. It has been
demonstrated again and again.
   Nevertheless, the stock market becomes increasingly unpopular,
even as it makes more headlines. Based on the publicity, or
notoriety, many people tend to think of themselves as the only ones
not in the market. It isn't so.
   Since 1968, households have been net sellers of stock in all but
one year. In that time the percentage of household financial assets
held as stocks has fallen to 19.6 percent from 43.4 percent. Those
are Federal Reserve figures.
   Why this should be so isn't clear, but the media's focus on
spectacular, day-to-day price movements, rather than long-term
results, has been cited. Some critics blame the brokerage industry,
saying it fails to inspire trust. Many say the industry, including
stock exchanges, has done a woeful selling job.
   Whatever the reason, a view of the equity market is that of a
game people play, a trading game, a game in which money is made on
tips, a game whose goal is outwitting the system for quick profits _
none of which involves investing.
   But as an investment vehicle, one in which millions of people
have their choice of thousands of quality companies, the stock
market has no equal.
   Ralph Tate, vice president of Aetna Equity Investors, which
handles a $4 billion investment portfolio, concedes that the market
can throw an investor for a short-term loss, but asks that they
consider the long-term results.
   Over the past 15 years, he observes, equities have fluctuated,
quivered and suffered, but when all was said and done a $1,000
investment made at the start of 1974 might have compounded to a
total of $5,622 by the end of 1988.
   That total would have been achieved by a theoretical investment
in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which reflects a spectrum
of the market that involves good performers and poor ones. Smart
investors might have done better.
   What Tate and others with the long-term view try to pound home is
that results take time _ and compounding. Over relatively short
periods of time the market rises and falls. In the long run, almost
without exception, it rises.
   To emphasize that point, Tate took perhaps the worst stock market
period of all time, a 15-year span that encompassed the Great
Depression of the 1930s.
   If you had invested $1,000 a year beginning in 1926 and continued
the program through the grim days of stock market collapse and
depression, your equity account would have grown to $19,700 by the
end of 1940.
   If that doesn't sound impressive you might consider that
thousands of businesses collapsed during that time, unemployment
rose to 25 percent, the economy shrank and fortunes were lost.
   Still not impressed? Then consider that during that time consumer
prices actually declined more than 2 percent a year, meaning those
dollars grew in purchasing power. Most people lost purchasing power
in the Depression; many stock market investors gained power.
   Sure the market strikes out. Babe Ruth did too. He hit only 714
home runs but he struck out 1,330 times.
   Says Tate: ``More Americans should come to recognize the quality
of the stock market's longer term slugging percentage and quit being
so focused on the occasional dramatic strikeout.''
   It would be nice, he said, to see individuals begin to act less
recklessly with their savings and put more of their long-term
investment dollars into equities.
   Stocks beat most other forms of investment, including most bonds,
he says. As for stocks vs. gambling, you cannot even quote odds.
It's no contest.

   For his part, Kolstad said in an interview that he believes
morale is better than it was when he took over. But he added,
``There is a concern that we have people in an acting capacity,
because it suggests that a lot of change that might otherwise occur
can't occur. There is frustration among some staff people. It's in
everyone's interest that the matter be resolved.''
   Supporters of Burnett, speaking anonymously, maintain that while
Bush may favor Burnett, a longtime political supporter and campaign
activist for Bush, some advisers in the White House dislike
Burnett's outspokeness on safety issues.
   These sources maintain that there has been extensive industry
lobbying to keep Kolstad, a former public relations vice president
for Frontier Airlines, as chairman.
   Neither Burnett nor Kolstad has made any secret about wanting the
charmanship.
   Some NTSB staff members praise Kolstad as personable and
competent. Private air safety consultant Charles Miller, once the
NTSB's director of accident investigtions, describes the acting
chairman as a ``fine individual'' who recognizes his limitations.
   Miller, discussing the agency's woes, points to its tight $25.4
million budget and to staff and leadership problems that have
plagued the board since it was separated from the Transportation
Department in 1974.
   While the NTSB has no regulatory power of its own, it is the
government's primary accident investigation agency and makes
recommendations to Congress, other agencies and transportation
industries.
   Board members individually lead staff members in top
investigations and then, in public sessions, vote on the probable
cause and safety recommendations.
   Burnett and Kolstad have sharply different styles and are often
at odds on safety issues. The former chairman is sometimes the only
dissenter on the board; the acting chairman has been low key, rarely
taking strong positions in open meetings.
   The other three NTSB board members, Lee Dickinson, Joseph Nall
and John Lauber, have had no public comments on the standoff between
Kolstad and Burnett.
   ``They're kind of hunkering down,'' said one source who has been
keeping a close watch on the agency.
   Critics of the NTSB's recent actions, or lack of them, cite
several incidents as evidence of problems:
   _The board failed to investigate the complaint this spring of 60
air traffic controllers in Cleveland who signed a petition citing
high-altitude ``air traffic chaos'' and calling for steps to
alleviate the ``hazardous environment.''
   Lloyd Miller, the acting managing director, headed off the
petition before it reached the board, contending it would be a bad
precedent to investigate what might be a labor-management problem.
   _Kolstad was the board member assigned to the Exxon Valdez oil
spill but did not go to Alaska to head the investigation.
   Kolstad answered that charge be saying that he has been very
active in the inquiry and that he decided not to go because other
high government officials were going and he did not see the need for
``sending another big name to the scene.''
   _While imposing a hiring freeze to meet its budget, the board
held a meeting for top personnel in Miami and the acting chairman
made two official trips to Europe.
   Kolstad said that the Miami meeting provided important dialogue
with industry representatives and that the board had gotten ``a good
deal'' on hotel accommodations and other expenses. He said both
European trips were worthwhile and part of his official duties.

   A quarter-century ago, Betty Friedan called the
oppression of American women ``the problem that has no name.'' But
Japan today has a name for Meiri Marimo's problem: She's ``leftover
Christmas cake.''
   Miss Marimo, in other words, has grown a bit stale as a
marriageable commodity _ at least that's what her mother complains.
In Japan, where many marriages are still arranged, a woman is
considered to have a shelf life of about 25 years.
   When Miss Marimo was 28, she left for New York _ alone.
   Sumiko Morikawa sits next to the ``No Smoking'' sign in her
Waldorf-Astoria office and lights a cigarette. At 39, she says she's
looking for a new man. She isn't particular about his background _
as long as he isn't Japanese.
   ``Japanese men and women, they cannot understand how to love,''
says Miss Morikawa, the owner of a translating service. Three years
ago, she ended a 16-year marriage undertaken to please her
tradition-minded brother in Japan. No passion, she says.
   ``Japanese businessmen are very nice, but they are so totally
quality-controlled. They see themselves as company men. And their
wives also, they say, `I'm a Mitsubishi wife.' It kills the
individuality of people.''
   It is 11:30 a.m. Renko Isowa, 42, pauses over a dish of vanilla
ice cream as she cheerily recalls the strict training of her youth
in the traditional female skills.
   ``I learned flower arrangement, tea ceremony and cooking for two
years. I was totally dead,'' says Miss Isowa, vice president of a
television production company here.
   ``I wanted to start working. I wanted to be a member of real
society.''
   Twenty-six years after ``The Feminine Mystique,'' Friedan's
manifesto of women's rights, helped kindle feminism in the West,
only a trickle of women in Japan are able or willing to live out its
creed. But many of those few come to the United States to try.
   The three expatriates above may seem refreshingly liberated, but
in Japan many would consider them wild-eyed radicals. They insist on
standing out in a society where wa, or group harmony, dictates ``the
nail that stands out is hammered down.''
   ``Japanese women haven't been raised to have aspirations,'' says
Jane Condon, author of ``A Half-Step Behind: Japanese Women of the
'80s.'' ``They're still facing boundaries we broke through 20 years
ago.''
   ``To be good American, you have to be an individual. To be a good
Japanese, you'd better damn sight not be,'' says Steven Fochios, a
New York City psychiatrist who counsels many Japanese women.
   ``The women who ... come to the U.S., then get into the machinery
of the country, are able to enjoy the kinds of freedoms they had
never dreamed of,'' he says. ``And these women are tough. They are
tough.''
   Miss Marimo's family frets, to no avail. To her friends, she is
an ``incredible oyahuko,'' a bad daughter. A few years ago, she
moved into her own apartment in Tokyo, watching defiantly as the
social pressures that mold a Japanese woman's life _ a cycle of
temporary employment, marriage and child-raising _ claimed her
schoolmates one by one.
   Her old friends ``spoke to me as if they were accusing me,
criticizing me very severely,'' recalls the lithe, long-haired Miss
Marimo, a free-lance writer.
   ``I didn't care at all. I don't want to be involved in
housekeeping. I smiled a Japanese smile'' _ and left.
   In the United States, disaffected minorities organize, as
American women did in the 1970s. In Japan, it has always been easier
to jump ship than to rock the boat. Until recently.
   Today, the glacial rigidity of Japanese society _ ``otoko no
shakai,'' the man's world _ shows signs of thawing after more than a
century of uneasy integration with the West. Japan's giant
corporations, facing chronic worker shortages as the economy surges,
are beginning to open management jobs to women. Traditionally they
are hired as tea-pouring ``office ladies'' while pursuing their real
vocation: marriage.
   Japanese women are even making an impact on politics. A record 22
women won seats in the July 23 elections for Parliament's upper
house. Female voters had been angered by allegations that Japan's
just-departed prime minister, Sousuke Uno, kept paid mistresses.
   The election also showed, however, that much has not changed.
Many of the victorious female parliamentary candidates had portrayed
themselves not as feminists but as simple housewives immune from
corruption.
   Indeed, apart from the odd individualist who ventures abroad to
live, few Japanese women want change.
   ``If you go to a party here and introduce yourself as a
housewife, people will think you're strange. But in Japan it's OK.
Being a housewife doesn't bother Japanese women, because they have a
social position,'' says Kako Nakagawa, the executive editor of New
York Yomiuri, a newspaper published for Japanese in North America.
   ``I think in the United States you have no secure place for
women,'' she says. ``Here there are opportunities for women, so if
you don't try anthing hard, then you feel guilty. ... But in Japan
there are no opportunities so there's no such struggle. It's easy.''
   ``When I go to Japan, the Japanese women I see are very
content-looking, very happy,'' says Naoko Adams, a researcher for
Sunstar Corp., a Japanese company with offices in New York. When I
come back to America, I notice the women look very unhappy,
frustrated.''
   While women in Japan are largely blocked from positions of power,
they provide a vital temporary worker base that absorbs economic
downturns, allowing large Japanese companies to maintain their
much-vaunted ``lifetime employment system'' for permanent workers.
In addition, they are the linchpin of an economic system that allows
men to spend long hours working and, as is expected, socializing
afterward.
   With the men otherwise occupied, women often control family purse
strings, and so completely control their children's destinies that
surveys have shown the central relationship in a Japanese man's life
is not between him and his wife but between him and his mother.
   So strong is such patterning of Japanese women, in fact, that
leaving it behind sometimes causes deep emotional problems for
expatriates, who must spurn what they have been taught since
childhood and embrace alien values.
   ``Some of them say they feel guilty about being free as an
American,'' says Fochios, the psychiatrist. ``They feel inferior to
a Japanese woman because they don't have the capacity to be a good
Japanese wife.''
   Some expatriate women, however, simply decide to ignore American
values.
   ``Japanese women are better off. I don't think I would like to
marry an American man,'' says Kiyomi Koizumi, a 65-year-old
neurophysiologist who came to the United States in 1949 and married
a Japanese.
   ``I always say my husband is like air _ you would miss it if it's
not there, I can't live without it, but you don't feel it. An
American man might be around me too much.''

   ``Extinction is Forever'' is the
motto at naturalist Gerald Durrell's Jersey Wildlife Preservation
Trust. Its symbol is the dodo, the flightless, turkey-like bird of
Mauritius that became extinct in the 1690s.
   It's goal is to keep more of the world's animals from becoming
extinct.
   The zoo boasts the world's most comprehensive collection of
endangered species. It protects animals by breeding them in
captivity and returning their offspring to the wild.
   On 25 beautifully landscaped acres of Jersey, the main island of
the English Channel archipelago, the zoo tries to recreate natural
settings for its charges.
   The trust also trains interns from all over the world to promote
animal survival in their own countries.
   ``We are not trying to maintain a living museum,'' said Anthony
Allchurch, the zoo's general administrator. ``We have a job to do.
If it happens that the public is interested in what we're doing,
that's great.''
   Founded in 1959, the zoo started out as a place where Durrell
kept the animals he collected during his expeditions. Four years
later, he formed the trust as a registered charity.
   ``The release of animals back into their natural habitat is the
ultimate goal for each of the species that we so carefully
nurture,'' Durrell has said.
   The white-bearded, 64-year-old Briton lives in Les Augres Manor
on the zoo grounds with his American wife Lee but was traveling and
unavailable to talk about his project with a visiting reporter.
   His books have been published in 26 languages. The best known is
``My Family and Other Animals,'' about his childhood on the Greek
island of Corfu. He also has produced numerous television
documentaries about animals. He is the younger brother of the famed
novelist Lawrence Durrell, author of the ``Alexandria Quartet'' and
other works.
   The zoo concentrates on six major geographical areas: northern
India and Nepal, southeastern Brazil, Mexico, the Caribbean,
Madagascar, and the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.
   It works closely with governments, wildlife groups, and other
zoos, including the National Zoo in Washington D.C.
   ``If we didn't work with government support and blessing, we
wouldn't achieve half of what we do,'' Allchurch said.
   The first animals that the zoo returned to a natural habitat were
14 pink pigeons that were placed in a botanical garden in the
Mascarene island of Mauritius in 1984.
   Three years later, the zoo placed pink pigeons in an area of
native forest that hadn't been inhabited by these birds for 10
years. To date, 19 have been returned to the wilderness, and,
significantly, two have been born there.
   ``We don't befriend, socialize, train or handle animals, to
enhance their chance of surviving the wild, if they ever get
there,'' Allchurch said.
   The zoo also sent Jamaican hutias, large brown rodents, back to
their island and is returning kestrels to Mauritius.
   ``A lot of rare animals are dull and brown. But two dull brown
parents with a baby are very exciting,'' Allchurch said.
   The zoo also has been a partner in programs to return golden lion
tamarins to Brazil, Bali starlings to Indonesia and thick-billed
parrots to Arizona.
   In 1978, the trust established its training program, which has
educated some 250 trainees from more than 40 countries. Many already
have had veterinary training, and they spend two to four months at
the zoo.
   ``You learn a lot. It's a great place here,'' said Susana
Ringenbach, a 27-year-old trainee from Tlalpan, Mexico. `You can
learn to educate the children not to go out and hunt.''
   She said she was inspired by Durrell's books and is particularly
interested in helping jaguars and spider monkeys.
   The trust has annual income of $2.2 million, 60 percent of it
from entrance fees. About 340,000 people visited the zoo last year.
   The remainder of the financing comes from private donations.
Along with its sister trusts in the United States and Canada, it has
20,000 members.

   At 23, Terri Lyne Carrington seems too young to
call an album ``Real Life Story.''
   But it's not so unusual when one realizes that the drummer has
been playing with some of the giants in jazz since she was 10 years
old, and her own life story already surpasses many twice her age.
   She's on hiatus from ``The Arsenio Hall Show,'' where she's been
drummer in the band since the late-night talk fest first aired.
She's busy touring the country to promote ``Real Life Story,'' her
debut LP with a major label on Verve-Forecast Records. She composed
all but two songs on the album, co-produced it with Robert Irving
III and sings on three tracks.
   It would seem to be a high point in an already illustrious
career. But for Carrington, it's simply a turning point, part of a
grand plan in which she moves from jazz prodigy to mainstream star.
   ``When I was 11 or 12, one side of me wanted to be a great
drummer and the other side wanted to be Diana Ross,'' she said. Now,
it appears, both dreams may be realized.
   A pretty, serene young woman, Carrington is modest, almost blase,
about her impressive past. She grew up an only child in Medford,
Mass., a working-class city outside Boston, where her father, Sonny
Carrington, a saxophonist, introduced her to the sax when she was 5
years old. ``I asked him if I could play,'' she said.
   Her decision to switch to drums at age 7 was borne of necessity.
   ``My teeth fell out,'' she explained during a recent interview in
Boston.
   By the age of 10, Carrington had begun to sit in with visiting
musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Elvin Jones
and Oscar Peterson. That same year, Clark Terry, impressed with her
ability, took her to the Wichita Jazz Festival. She met drummer
Buddy Rich there, who then accompanied her on the television show
``To Tell the Truth.''
   Two years later, she was awarded a special scholarship to the
Berklee College of Music after the school's director heard her play
with Peterson. During her time at Berklee, she took courses in
piano, drums and vibes, along with harmony and composition.
   In 1981 she recorded an album, ``TLC and Friends,'' with Kenny
Barron, Buster Williams and George Coleman. During this period,
Carrington began to shape her career, shifting from a classical
tradition to one that would bring her eventual commercial success.
   ``When I was 14, I had the potential; I strived to be one of the
greatest drummers, period,'' she said. ``But something happened
between the time I was 14 and 19. I decided I wanted to be an artist
_ a singer, writer, producer.''
   She graduated from high school at 16, and in 1983, moved to New
York and played with a variety of musicians such as Stan Getz, James
Moody, Woody Shaw and Cassandra Wilson.
   Her career, she said, has always snowballed. ``In this business,
you work whenever you can.''
   While in New York, Carrington began to tire of acoustic jazz and
decided to move into more contemporary music. She started playing
with Wayne Shorter, co-founder of Weather Report, and last year
toured with David Sanborn.
   Carrington said she rarely got nervous playing with such
established musicians. Carlos Santana, Patrice Rushen and Grover
Washington Jr. are among the musicians on her new album.
   ``I usually put more pressure on myself than they did,'' she
said. ``I remember Wayne would say, `It's only music, relax.' That
changed my outlook.''
   After five years she began to dislike New York City, and recently
moved to Los Angeles. She lives in the suburb of Glendale. It
reminds her more of the suburban neighborhood where she grew up.
   In Los Angeles, the transformation from journeyman jazz musician
to budding star is in full swing. ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' brought
her national celebrity. Her circle of friends include actresses
Dawnn Lewis of ``A Different World'' and Marsha Warfield of ``Night
Court.''
   Her next album will be mostly vocals, and she plans to try some
acting.
   ``I'm one of those people who likes excitement, a certain kind of
edge,'' she said. ``I like that place in between being in control
and being safe. I like to be daring and take chances.''

<HEAD>Demons, Deaths and Exorcists Romp Through Georgetown</HEAD>

   Fifteen years ago, an adolescent's spinning
head terrified movie audiences throughout the world, as the ghastly
specter of possession chillingly chiseled its way through ``The
Exorcist.''
   Well brace yourselves, horror movie fans, ``The Exorcist: 1990''
is on its way.
   William Peter Blatty, who wrote the original from his novel of
the same name, has written this third sequel, based on his 1983
novel, ``Legion,'' and is directing. Although ``Legion'' does not
concern possession, Blatty has added an exorcism to his script.
   William Kinderman, the rumpled police detective who had a role in
``The Exorcist,'' investigates a series of ritualistic murders in
``The Exorcist: 1990.''
   Blatty shot on location this summer in the Georgetown University
area, where he once went to school and where much of the original
1974 film was also made.
   ``I would like it to be thought as the one and only sequel to
`The Exorcist,''' he said.
   Blatty held all sequel rights to the original but allowed Warner
Bros., which released the first movie starring Linda Blair, Ellen
Burstyn and Max Von Sydow, to do ``Exorcist II: The Heretic.'' The
sequel was written by William Goodhart and directed by John Boorman
and was both a critical and commercial failure.
   Blatty won an Academy Award for ``The Exorcist,'' which also
received six Oscar nominations including best picture and director
(William Friedkin).
   Locations for the new movie have included Holy Trinity Church and
the original Georgetown General Hospital, which will again be a
hospital in the movie, although it is now a dormitory for male and
female Georgetown students.
   Blatty says there will also be a scene on the long stairway where
Father Damien Karras tumbled to his death in one of the most
hair-raising scenes of the original.
   Members of the cast include George C. Scott and Viveca Lindfors,
as well as Georgetown students making their debut as extras and
former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in a cameo appearance as
himself.
   ``I think the occult is playing a larger and larger role in
American society,'' Koop told publicists for the film in a video
interview. ``I think there are some things about it that are hokey,
but there is a very real satanic worshiping group of people in this
country, and I have been involved in public health issues that deal
with that three times in eight years.
   ``I think Shakespeare was right when he said that we don't know
everything in earth and heaven. I'd say we only have a very small
smattering of what's really yet to be known.''
   In the movie, Koop, who left office in July, has coffee with a
priest in The Tombs, a restaurant near the campus.
   The bearded pediatrician said his literary agent called him and
said the filmmakers were ``looking for someone recognizable because
they wanted to authenticate a shot to make it look like Washington
with real people.''
   The shooting came during the break between spring and summer
terms, so disruption on the university campus was held to a minimum,
said Betsy Wittleder of the school's public information office.
   ``Basically, other than when they have some filming going on and
people are requested not to go into that area because of the
filming, life continues as usual,'' she said.
   On one recent afternoon, Blatty, wearing jeans, sneakers and a
Georgetown baseball cap, filmed a scene in which Lindfors, in a
nurse's uniform, walks down the front steps of the hospital with a
worn carpetbag in her hand.
   ``We want it to be an extaordinarily good film, and we want to
scare the pants off the audience,'' he said.
   Blatty thought the debacle of ``Exorcist II'' put a stigma on the
current project. ``But if the film is good, it (the stigma) will
vanish overnight,'' he said.
   The original ``Exorcist'' also received its share of brickbats
from critics.
   Michael Billington of the Illustrated London News said, ``It
exploits the subject of diabolic possession without telling you
anything about it.'' Stanley Kauffmann, said, ```The Exorcist' makes
no sense,'' although he conceded that ``if you want to be shaken, it
will scare the hell out of you.''
   Despite the mixed reviews, the film grossed a reported $160
million worldwide, a record at the time.
   The film told the story of a girl, played in both 1974 and 1977
by Linda Blair, who is possessed by the devil and causes several
violent deaths. Blair, whose career plunged after the ``Exorcist''
movies, is not in the third film. Besides Scott and Lindfors, the
cast also includes Ed Flanders (``St. Elsewhere'') and Sylvia Sidney.
   ``The story that I had constructed just didn't have any place for
her,'' Blatty said. ``Rather than taking a character I had to use
and then trying to build a story around her, I thought the faithful
thing to do was to create a great story and see who fits into it.
Linda did not, unfortunately.''
   Blatty said the sequel will begin where ``The Exorcist'' ended
and will follow the story of ``Legion'' except for ``a totally
different ending.'' The story involves a friendship between a police
lieutenant, played by Scott, and a priest, played by Flanders.
   ``There will be one, I hope breathaking moment at the end of the
film, an effect that has never been seen before,'' the director
said. ``I hope we can do it.''
   But the film will not emphasize the spectacular special effects
that helped make ``The Exorcist'' such a hit.
   ``This one does not rely upon spinning heads for shock,'' he
said. ``The terror is in the shadows in the mind.''
   ``There is almost no act of violence,'' said Scott. ``I think it
goes to a different level than your normal spooky picture.''
   But don't worry. It's going to be scary anyway, said Blatty. ``It
is pure entertainment that uses theology only as it contributes to
the excitement.
   ``I have independently counted 30 shocks, or little jumps out of
the seat, some much higher than others.''

<HEAD>Noodles, Poetry and an Author Named Banana</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An author named Banana, a sentimental vignette about
a bowl of noodles and a slim volume of poems that infuses an ancient
form with a dash of Americana have Japanese readers enthralled.
   With 99 percent literacy and a mostly youthful reading public
that bought 1.6 billion books last year, popular novels and short
story and poetry anthologies can reach sales levels of which
American publishers only dream.
   And in what could be called Japan's version of the American
``literary brat pack,'' a few youthful writers are dominating this
country's best-seller lists.
   ```One Bowl of Soba' Has Whole Nation Buying, Crying'' screamed a
recent headline in a Japanese newspaper about a short story that
traces the struggles of a young widow to feed her two children. It
depicts the three sharing one bowl of soba, or Japanese noodles, as
a New Year celebration.
   For leaving Japanese readers sobbing in their soba, author Ryohei
Kuri's work has prompted scant literary praise but drawn accolades
from other quarters for reawakening a sense of compassion for the
underdog in this affluent country.
   And for exposing spiritual poverty in contemporary Japan, the
story has made Kuri a rich and celebrated man.
   A magazine containing his story sold out 600,000 copies almost
instantly. A book of Kuri's stories, including ``Soba,'' scored
third on a June list of national best sellers, and a movie deal is
in the making.
   Rising literary star Banana Yoshimoto, 25, wrote three of the top
10 works of fiction on the same list, including the novel
``Tsugumi,'' which has been the No. 1 best seller for several weeks,
and ``Kitchen,'' her first novel.
   The self-named daughter of a Marxist literary critic won the
prestigious Kaien prize in 1987 for ``Kitchen,'' a 68-page book
dashed off in three months while Yoshimoto worked as a waitress.
   The young heroine of ``Kitchen'' finds sanctuary at night when
she drags her mattress into her kitchen to be lulled to sleep by the
hum of the refrigerator. Later, she wins a man's heart with a dish
of fried pork and rice.
   Critic Shinichiro Nakamura, who chose Yoshimoto for the Kaien
prize, wrote that the author broke new ground by ``totally ignoring
traditional literary accomplishment and describing feelings and
senses freely.
   ``I felt a new literature came from this defiant attitude of
keeping these things on the page whether or not they fit the old
rules of literature.''
   Another young woman who recently shook the literary establishment
is Machi Tawara, a 27-year-old doe-eyed poet whose ``Salad
Anniversary'' made publishing history by selling nearly 3 million
copies _ more than any other book of modern poetry.
   She startled practitioners of the 1,300-year-old native art of
tanka poetry by using contemporary language, including over 150
borrowed Western words such as McDonalds and valentine. Tawara is
credited with revitalizing the tanka, a five-line poem that follows
a strict 5-7-5-7-7 syllable count.
   ``I am using short poems to write about the small emotional
epiphanies we make every day that usually go unnoticed,'' she said.
``Many people write to tell me they saw their own feelings expressed
in my poetry.''
   Tawara's American translator, Juliet Winters Carpenter, says that
although ``Salad Anniversary'' suggests Emily Dickenson with touches
of Dorothy Parker's humor, many Japanese critics have faulted her
poetry as slight. The book will be published in the United States in
January by Kodansha International Ltd.
   Perhaps the biggest sensation in Japanese publishing in recent
years is Haruki Murakami's novel, ``Norwegian Wood,'' whose title is
taken from the Beatles song. The book, published in two volumes by
Kodansha, has sold more than 4 million copies since its release in
1987, and spent 21 months on best-seller lists.
   ``Norwegian Wood'' is a meandering tale of love and rootlessness
among Japanese youth in the 1960s and '70s, and features a
protagonist in his 20s who hangs out in coffee shops and jazz bars,
reads ``The Great Gatsby'' and listens to Bob Dylan.
   ``It's a kind of love story that Japanese have not been party to
in the past in their popular literature,'' says Kodansha senior
editor Elmer Luke. ``The characters flit in and out of meaningless
relationships, but in the midst of all the wandering there is the
will for affection.''
   An earlier Murakami book, ``Wild Sheep Chase,'' will be published
in the United States by Kodansha in October.
   Many popular authors pump out 10 or more books a year to feed the
appetite of a voracious reading public, and to keep the momentum
going in what publisher Minato Asakawa calls the ``jitenshya
sogyo,'' literally the ``bicycle operation.''
   ``Japanese authors believe that when you stop peddling your
bicycle will fall down. So to keep your life and career at the same
pace you never stop peddling,'' said Asakawa, editorial director at
Kodansha.
   But Asakawa noted Japan's literary ``brat pack'' can afford to
pause on the literary treadmill because their works are selling in
larger numbers than ever before.

<HEAD>Catholic Tactics On Abortion Adjusted After Court Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Roman Catholic bishops see traces of
anti-Catholicism and attempts to shut them up in opposing abortion.
But they say they won't be stilled and are shaping new tactics in
the struggle.
   They've put their present emphasis on short-term, partial
measures, short of a total ban.
   The declaration by their anti-abortion committee came last week,
laying out refashioned church strategies in light of the July 3
Supreme Court decision upholding some Missouri restrictions on
abortion.
   The bishops saw ``cause for hope'' in the decision, saying it
``marks the begining of a new debate'' over the issue, but that
conditions surrounding it remain confused and complicated.
   Some would ``exclude us'' from the debate, claiming ``our
opposition to abortion is motivated soley by religious
convictions,'' the bishops' committee said.
   But ``we do not intend to be ruled out of this or any social
debate by spurious interpretations of the First Amendment. We must
continue to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, our
unborn sisters and brothers.''
   Although not specifying who seeks to muzzle them, the bishops
have been in a long legal battle with Abortion Rights Mobilization,
which seeks removal of church tax exemption, alleging funding of
anti-abortion political campaigns.
   ``We're not trying to silence anybody, although that's the
impression the bishops try to give,'' said ARM's attorney, Marshall
Beil. ``Our suit is not to keep them quiet, but because they've
violated the law by electioneering.''
   However, he conceded the penalty sought _ lifting church tax
exemption _ would, if imposed, would curb church anti-abortion
activity. ``Further efforts would be limited,'' he said.
   With that lawsuit now tied up in a federal appeals court over
whether ARM has standing to pursue it, the bishops sensed sharpened
determination and feelings about abortion itself after the high
court ruling.
   ``Anti-Catholic sentiment has never been entirely absent from the
pro-abortion campaign, but abortion-rights advocates apparently seek
to revivify it now that efforts of Catholics and other pro-life
citizens have begun to bear fruit,'' the statement said.
   Again, the bishops didn't pinpoint any evidence of
anti-Catholicism. But on that matter, Biel said ``we've worked very
hard to remove any trace of anti-Catholicism'' from the suit. He
said some plaintiffs were Catholics.
   The bishops' committee, in the remodeled planning, said the
bishops seek ``protection for the unborn to the maximum degree
possible, '' but short-term objectives were recommended as most
feasible _ a pragmatism repudiated by conservative Catholic critics.
   Although the bishops were early, key players in opposing
abortion, the statement recognized that some Protestant
denominations and others now were allies, and urged cooperation with
them. Some want partial restrictions, not total.
   ``By working together with other concerned Americans we can bring
about a change of heart and a change of policy in our society so
that unborn children will enjoy the law's protection,'' the
statement said.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago headed the bishops'
committee that draw up the 2,000-word statement, called ``An
Opportunity to Defend Life.''
   Declaring that ``opportunities opened'' by the high court
decision ``are limited and complex,'' the statement advocated
legislative steps such as these:
   Limits on government funding of abortion, requirements of
parental notification and consent on abortion for minors; safeguards
against ``hasty or uninformed consent to abortion'' and restrictions
on late-term abortions.
   Apparently because of past keen differences in Catholic ranks
over whether the church should press for partial or total
restrictions on abortion, the bishops' committee urged a united
front on practical possibilities, saying:
   ``Groups and individuals seeking new opportunities for protection
of the unborn will best achieve their goal through mutual respect
and cooperation.
   ``The movement in support of abortion on demand is united in its
agenda; pro-life Americans must not give their adversaries an easy
victory by launching attacks on each other over questions of
political strategy.''
   Urging that the tone be kept gentle and rational, the statement
said:
   ``We must present reasons for our proposals which can be
understood and appreciated by people of good will who may not share
our convictions.
   ``Indeed we see respect for human life, born and unborn, as a
demand which our common humanity makes on all of us, for other human
goods lose their meaning when the value of life itself is demeaned
or diminished.''
   The statement said the ``humanity of the unborn child'' is being
obscured by arguments over privacy and personal autonomy, adding
that Americans have just begun to see that a ``right to life''
precedes fetal viability.
   ``Prior to viability a child depends for survival on the
protection of his or her mother's womb,'' the statement said. ``In
other contexts, however, our society rightly sees dependency upon
others as evidence of a need for more care and concern, not as a
pretext for denying rights to the helpless.''

   Rejecting the thesis that Jews
have their own valid covenant with God, the Lausanne II
International Congress on World Evangelization said Jews need Jesus
``as much as anyone else.''
   In a manifesto, the congress of about 4,000 evangelicals from
around the globe declared:
   It ``would be a form of anti-Semitism, as well as being disloyal
to Christ, to depart from the New Testament pattern of taking the
Gospel to `the Jew first.'''
   The manifesto, appproved near the close of the 10-day congress
July 20, added, ``We wish to be sensitive to those of other faiths,
and we reject any approach that seeks to force conversion on them.''
   Repentance was expressed for past ``attitudes of ignorance,
arrogance, disrespect and even hostility'' toward those of other
faiths.
   But the manifesto rejects ``both the relativism that regards all
religions and spiritualities as equally valid approaches to God and
the syncretism that tries to mix faith in Christ with other faiths.''
   Asserting the ``uniqueness of Christ,'' the manifesto says,
``There is only one Gospel because there is only one Christ, who
because of his death and resurrection is himself the only way to
salvation.''

   By a vote of 1,768 to 1,685, the General
Assembly of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) rejected a
resolution terming the Bible the denomination's ``highest
authority,'' taking precedence over reason, tradition and experience
of the church in determining Christ's will.
   Objected the Rev. John Walker of Bonner Springs, Kan., ``I prefer
not to place the Bible before Jesus Christ.''

   Four United Methodist Bishops met recently with
President Bush, reviving a custom that began two centuries ago but
which has been absent during recent administrations.
   Bishop Jack M. Tuell of Los Angeles, president of the
denomination's council of bishops, said the audience was sought to
commemorate the 1789 visit to George Washington by early Methodist
Bishops Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke.
   Such calls continued on a more or less regular basis until the
Richard Nixon administration.
   The bishops assured Bush of the prayers of United Methodists and
added in a statement read by Bishop Leroy C. Hodapp of Indianapolis,
``We are grateful for your strong Christian faith and your devotion
to the church.''
   Tuell said Bush, an Episcopalian, spoke of how much the church
means to him, noting he had missed services only two Sundays since
taking office.

<HEAD>Mongolia's Ambassador: Herdsman Turned Diplomat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he was young, Gendengun Nyamdoo would
start his day galloping on horseback over the vast plains of Western
Mongolia. These days, he starts his day poring over the real estate
ads in The Washington Post.
   Nyamdoo, Mongolia's first ambassador to the United States, is
looking for an embassy building and residence befitting his ancient
nation, which gave rise to the 13th century warrior Genghis Khan.
   His country, sandwiched between China and the Soviet Union, has
been synonymous with remoteness and isolation for hundreds of years.
   No more. Mongolia is making its debut on Washington's diplomatic
stage with an ambassador who is not your typical, ``stiff upper
lip'' diplomat.
   When he went to present his credentials to President Bush three
months ago, Nyamdoo took along his infant grandson. He and his wife
care for the baby, ``and there was nowhere to leave him,'' Nyamdoo
said in an interview.
   He drives his own car _ a chauffeur is not in the budget yet _
and lives in a Belle Epoque apartment house that has seen better
days. His deputy lives in an adjacent apartment, and the living
quarters are also used as offices.
   But Nyamdoo is sufficiently savvy to have learned one of the
first rules of Washington success: a lobbyist is a virtual must. He
has retained the firm of Van Kloberg and Associates to help him get
settled, introduce him around town and promote investment in
Mongolia.
   His English has the distinct rolling intonation of a Russian
accent, the legacy of five years of university in Moscow where he
studied international law. The subject of his doctoral desertation
was one he knows well: landlocked countries.
   Mongolia, once the seat of a warrior empire that extended to the
shores of the Danube River, established diplomatic relations with
the United States in 1987. ``It was high time,'' Nyamdoo said in an
interview.
   About 100 other countries have diplomatic ties with Mongolia,
which became the world's second communist nation when it declared
independence in 1924, but only about 20 maintain resident
ambassadors there. The U.S. ambassador, Richard Williams, works at
the State Department and occasionally travels to visit several
junior American diplomats who brave the harsh climate and lack of
Western comforts to live and work in Ulan Bator, the capital.
   Nyamdoo and his five brothers and sisters grew up on a farm in
the western part of the country, which spans an area the size of
Western Europe but whose population is only 2 million.
   ``I miss the rural life,'' said the 55-year-old envoy. ``We had
five treasures: horses, cattle, camels, sheep and goats.''
   In those days, it was easy for a bright youth to get a high
school and university education, he said. Mongolia had styled itself
on the Soviet model of centralized economic planning and a free
education for all.
   Nowadays, with 70 percent of the population under the age of 30
and shrinking Soviet aid, competition for university slots is
tougher, Nyamdoo said.
   Mongolia has its version of perestroika and glasnost, the Soviet
policies of economic restructuring and political openness, but in
Ulan Bator it's called ``shinechel'' or renewal.
   ``You can say we have more freedom than in the United States
now,'' Nyamdoo said with a laugh.
   The opening to the United States paralleled improving relations
between Mongolia and its giant neighbor to the south, China.
Relations between Beijing and Ulan Bator were ruptured in the late
1950s when Mongolia sided with the Soviet Union in its split with
China. But the recent thaw in Sino-Soviet relations encompassed the
Mongolians, as well.
   In 1984, Nyamdoo was part of a Mongolian Foreign Ministry team
that drafted an agreement with China to start normalizing relations.
Here in Washington, he meets with his Chinese counterpart as well as
with Ambassador Williams, who is also in charge of the State
Department's China office.
   Nyamdoo would like more U.S. recognition of his country,
specifically through a meeting between his foreign minister and
Secretary of State James Baker. ``The level of diplomatic relations
is too low now,'' he said.
   U.S. officials characterize the relationship as modest but off to
a good start.
   Trade with the United States runs at about $3 million annually,
mostly Mongolian exports of cashmere and wool. Hundreds of American
hunters go on safaris to hunt rams in the frozen wastelands of the
Gobi Desert.
   Nyamdoo would like U.S. investment in Mongolia, possibly in the
form of joint ventures. Already a team representing petroleum
companies visited Mongolia this summer to examine the prospects for
oil exploration in the mineral-rich country, he said.
   But for Nyamdoo, the most pressing need is an embassy building.
His efforts are complicated by a standoff with the State Department
over land for a U.S. chancery in Ulan Bator.
   In accordance with diplomatic practice, Mongolia cannot set up an
embassy here until the United States gets the land for its chancery
in Ulan Bator.
   But the State Department has picked out a lot used by a Mongolian
naturalist society and refuses to settle for another space, Nyamdoo
said. ``I am stubborn, too. We will see,'' he said.

   The mighty Mississippi once carried cargo and cotton and damsels
and dandies up and down the lazy river. Now Iowans are betting these
waters will deliver them another precious commodity _ greenbacks.
   Iowa, known more for hogs than high rollers, is moving to revive
riverboat gambling, hoping the romance of the past will generate
riches for the future _ and it's not alone.
   Across America's heartland, several states are planning or
considering gambling ventures to try to bring dollars, jobs and
tourists into struggling industrial cities and small towns hit hard
this decade by factory closings, the farm depression and the exodus
of jobs and people.
   ``If we were still doing well and had not turned into the great
Rust Belt, you would not see this great influx of gambling in the
guise of economic development,'' said state Sen. Denny Jacobs, a key
supporter of riverboat gambling in Illinois. ``It's a nice stopgap
until we can readjust ourselves and get back on two solid feet.''
   Soon there will be wagers in the land of Wild Bill Hickok, the
gold rush town of Deadwood, S.D. There's gambling talk, too, in
Indiana, Missouri and Wisconsin.
   That's not to suggest there aren't skeptics and critics. Some
argue the stakes are too low to be an economic salvation, the sites
too ho-hum or bleak for tourism.
   Others fear games of chance will erode the American Gothic ethic.
   ``When gambling comes in, all of the other social crimes
increase,'' said Owen Primavera, spokesman for the Iowa Alliance
Against Casino Gambling. ``It increases loan sharking. It increases
drug traffic ... (and) prostitution.''
   Supporters insist they intend to create family entertainment.
   ``Those traditional Midwest heartland values are ... still going
to be there,'' said Larry Reed, executive vice president of the
Davenport Chamber of Commerce in Iowa.
   The only change, proponents say, is the Midwest will being doing
more to strut its stuff.
   ``The Mississippi is well known worldwide,'' said Don Rinehart,
executive vice president of the River City Chamber of Commerce in
Iowa. ``(It's) a gold mine in our backyard and we haven't taken
advantage of it.''
   ``It's all right to be homespun,'' Jacobs said. ``That's part of
the charm of the Midwest. But it may be time we get a little more
sophisticated.''
   And gambling seems a logical step with the increasing popularity
of bingo, lotteries and horse and dog tracks. In North Dakota, for
example, a record $205 million was wagered on games of chance last
year, including pull tabs, blackjack and bingo.
   More than 30 states have lotteries and more than 40 have
parimutuel betting, said William Thompson, a University of
Nevada-Las Vegas management and public administration professor and
co-author of a book on casinos.
   There's more to come:
   _ In Deadwood, S.D., there will be poker, blackjack and slot
machines, probably in October. Voters this spring approved gambling.
City proceeds will go to historic preservation in this once
rip-roaring Black Hills town where Hickok's last poker game ended
with a bullet in his head.
   ``What we're really doing is returning to our past and saying
that's really our future,'' said Bill Walsh, co-owner of a local
hotel.
   _ In Gary, Ind., a struggling steel capital on Lake Michigan,
voters will be asked in a non-binding November referendum whether
they want resort hotels with casino gambling. Supporters of casino
gambling in Lorain, Ohio, say they are not giving up despite failing
to get enough signatures to put the issue on the November ballot. In
1988, Detroit rejected casinos for the third time in 12 years.
   _ In Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri, some lawmakers want to
mimic Iowa and put riverboats and other floating casinos on parts of
the Great Lakes, the Mississippi and other waterways.
   The Illinois House in June rejected such a plan but a task force
has since been formed to study the issue so lawmakers can reconsider
it in the fall.
   Many Illinois officials are eager to put paddlewheelers in the
water before Iowa, which doesn't start riverboat gambling until
April 1991. Iowa requires county referendums before gambling can
begin in each local area.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has proposed creating a regional agency
to monitor riverboat gambling on the states' boundary waters.
   The lure of big tourist bucks is particularly appealing to
Mississippi River towns in both states, which have lost thousands of
manufacturing jobs in the last decade.
   Iowa has estimated gambling on its rivers and lakes could
generate $1.7 billion in spinoffs from tourism and new business.
   There's concern, though, riverboats could cut into the bingo and
racing profits.
   Further, Reed said, ``At some point, you reach a saturation
point. If Iowa has it, Illinois and Wisconsin ... the impact of it
for any individual state is going to be diluted.''
   Some experts say Iowa's riverboat project already is in trouble
because of a $5 limit per bet, $200 cap on nightly losses and 20
percent casino revenue tax that will make it harder to reap a profit.
   Iowa ``has produced an unworkable bill that will probably result
in naught,'' Daniel Lee, senior analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., said in a report.
   He added in a telephone interview: ``They're going to throw a
party no one will go to.''
   Especially, some say, if it's far away.
   ``People from around the country are not going to travel to Iowa
to spend $5 on riverboat gambling,'' said Professor Thompson.
``Everything that is good about it lends itself to being small ...
(But) if it's small it's not going to add much to the economy.''
   But local folks insist they're not expecting miracles.
   ``I don't think anybody has touted riverboat gambling as the
answer to their economic woes,'' Rinehart said. ``It's like chicken
soup. It can't hurt and it looks like it could help. ... It's just
another piece of ammunition to lure people.''
   That's also what Deadwood hopes to do.
   ``There's no other way we could think of to raise money,'' said
Melodee Nelson, head of the Deadwood You Bet Committee. ``Deadwood
is sitting 45 miles from a major airport, 15 miles from the
interstate. No industry is going to come to Deadwood.''
   But big cities that have industry and are looking for gambling to
reverse their fortunes also face obstacles, said John Dombrink,
associate social ecology professor at the University of
California-Irvine and Thompson's co-author.
   ``It's kind of Pollyannish to think a blue-collar industrial city
is somehow tailor-made for ... a tourist industry,'' he said.
```Tourism is not like a nose job, where one day you can wave a
wand. ... It might take a long time for people's perceptions to
change.''
   But some in Gary, Ind., believe the scenic lakefront and
proximity to Chicago will make the city an ideal casino site,
despite its problems with shuttered stores, a bleak downtown and a
shrinking workforce.
   ``I think it's Gary's last shot at an economic development
project that will deliver in the magnitude the steel mills once
delivered on,'' said state Rep. Earline Rogers, a supporter.
``Nothing else we've looked at will revitalize Gary in the same
manner. If casino gambling can't do it, nothing can.''

<HEAD>Dubuque Wants Riverboat Gambling License; So Does Tiny McGregor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   This town, population 945, will try for a
riverboat gambling license. So will Dubuque, with more than 60 times
as many people.
   ``I think there's a possibility of us getting a license, but I
think it's an uphill battle,'' said McGregor Chamber of Commerce
official Charlie Zahn. ``Personally speaking, I think it stinks.''
   The northeast Iowa communities, about 60 miles apart on the
Mississippi River, are two of the Iowa towns that plan to apply for
licenses from the state Racing and Gaming Commission following
approval of riverboat gambling in local referendums last week.
   There is no limit on the number of licenses that could be issued,
but observers expect no more than three _ some say only one _ will
be issued for the first year.
   On paper, Dubuque would appear to have an overwhelming edge. The
city boasts many tourism attractions, highlighted by Mississippi
River boat tours and the first dog track granted a parimutuel
license when gambling was legalized in Iowa four years ago.
   But McGregor officials concede nothing.
   Their own attractions include a 970-acre park named for Zebulon
Pike, a series of 191 preserved prehistoric Indian burial grounds,
and thousands of acres for hunting and camping. Officials felt
confident enough of obtaining a riverboat gambling license to hire a
contractor to build a boat dock for about $500,000.
   McGregor is a half-mile stretch of restaurants, antique shops,
taverns and other stores nestled between forested bluffs overlooking
the river.
   ``Being a smaller community, I think it's only fair that we
should have an opportunity like this, rather than everything going
to the big urban areas,'' said McGregor City Clerk Norm Lincoln.
   Dubuque has a different argument for the gaming commission.
   ``There is a point that's reached where there's too many people
in too small a geographic region all trying to do the same thing. I
think a full-fledged operation like we plan in Dubuque and a
full-bore operation very close to us, such as McGregor, might be a
little bit much,'' said Don Hess, a spokesman for the Dubuque Racing
Association, the non-profit group seeking a license.
   Hess, also director of marketing and communications at Dubuque
Greyhound Park, said five dog tracks are due to open in neighboring
Wisconsin, potentially cutting attendance and revenue in Iowa.
   ``We're hoping to secure a riverboat gambling license to get a
floating casino out on the Mississippi so we can have two major
tourism draws that will allow us to bring back some of these people
that we'll be losing to Wisconsin.''
   A floating casino could mean 300 jobs and an extra $100 million a
year to the local economy, Hess said.
   In McGregor, officials feel the state almost owes them a license
to compensate for lost taxes on thousand of acres around town
purchased by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.
   ``McGregor's never going to land the big industry, and the
economics are such that we'll probably never see a dog track or
horse track,'' Mayor Robyn Denning said. ``We just never seem to get
our fair share of what's going on.''

   Earlier this year, U.S. immigration officials in
Texas cracked down on political asylum applications from Central
Americans, calling most ``frivolous.'' Hundreds of aliens were
swiftly ordered deported. AP correspondent Joel Williams in
Harlingen, Texas, has covered the immigration crush from his post on
the Mexico border. This summer, he accompanied one Salvadoran on the
deportation journey home.

<DATELINE>SAN MIGUEL, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hot, crowded bus stopped at a
dirt road. Jose Joel Martinez, freshly deported from the United
States, stepped down and started walking the final, dusty mile to
his parents' concrete-walled house.
   He didn't know how long it would be safe to stay.
   Martinez, 20, returned to civilian life this spring after four
years in El Salvador's army. But the civil war followed him home,
and guerrillas warned him to leave or his life would be in danger.
   ``I don't know whether it is safe for me to return,'' Martinez
said, looking at the mountain range just to the north, where combat
recently had intensified between government troops and the leftist
guerillas. ``I'll have to see how things are.''
   The journey home is a familiar one lately in El Salvador.
Deportations of Salvadorans from Texas, which increased dramatically
after a U.S. crackdown designed to plug off a flood of Central
Americans, totaled more than 1,100 in the first half of the year.
   On Feb. 21, the Immigration and Naturalization Service abruptly
ended its policy of allowing Central Americans to travel beyond
Texas to other U.S. destinations for temporary residence. By
January, new asylum applicants were pouring into southern Texas at a
rate of 500 a day. The INS began ruling on applications the day they
were filed. Those denied were held in detention camps until
deportation.
   Only six Salvadorans were granted asylum in Texas from Feb. 21 to
the end of July.
   Martinez said he didn't even bother to apply; people told him it
would only mean longer detention before he was deported.
   Martinez's homecoming prompted smiles from neighbors as he passed
on a road lined with barbed wire and dotted with occasional piles of
cattle dung.
   ``Todo tranquilo aqui (everything calm here),'' Maria Emilina
Anderson told Martinez when he asked about any local fighting.
   Chickens scattered minutes later as he turned down a narrow path,
stopped at a cinderblock house and shouted to a smiling woman who
was hanging laundry on a rope. ``Hello. Lito is back, too,''
Martinez told Lito's mother. ``He will visit Sunday,'' after a
reunion with his wife and newborn baby in San Miguel, the provincial
capital.
   Lito, his next-door neighbor and fellow ex-soldier, was deported
on the same TACA International Airlines flight that had carried
Martinez from Houston the day before. Out of work and threatened by
the guerrillas, Lito had left for ``El Norte'' a few weeks before
Martinez made his trip in May.
   He and Martinez found each other at the INS detention camp
northeast of Brownsville, Texas.
   ``The food and the bed were better there (in U.S. detention) than
I have at home, and it is air-conditioned,'' Martinez said. ``But I
was a prisoner. It was my first time ever to be a prisoner.''
   He left for the United States on May 3 and slipped across the Rio
Grande at Brownsville on May 14. Four days later, he was in INS
custody, having made the mistake of presenting himself to the Border
Patrol to ask permission to stay and work in the United States.
   He was held at the crowded INS detention camp six weeks, wearing
the standard orange jumpsuit and blue canvas slippers and playing
soccer and basketball with other detainees.
   Many Salvadorans applying for asylum say they are fleeing ``la
situacion'' _ a combination of civil war and unemployment
exacerbated by war. The nine-year conflict has claimed 70,000 lives,
mostly civilians, and displaced 500,000 to 1 million people.
   Those able to prove they are fleeing persecution get asylum and
permission to work in the United States. But U.S. officials say most
Central Americans come for economic reasons.
   Among Salvadorans in the United States, it is not hard to find
ex-soldiers who say they were threatened by guerillas.
   ``Immigration to the United States has increased much by soldiers
who have completed military service,'' said the Rev. Segundo Montes,
a Jesuit priest and director of the Human Rights Institute at
Central American University in San Salvador. ``They don't want to
return to their houses or their towns because they are afraid.''
   In conflict zones, guerillas might consider ex-soldiers, public
officials and their families to be ``ears'' for the government and
tell them to leave, Montes said.
   ``If they do not leave, there comes a time when they, as they
say, `bring them to justice.' They kill them,'' Montes said.
   That type of justice is still more typical of the army, he added,
``but the guerrillas, I believe, have increased a little this type
of repression against the civilian population.''
   Martinez spent a good part of the flight to El Salvador quiet and
absorbed in violent reports of the civil war in a Salvadoran
newspaper left on the plane. He did not join in the idle clowning of
some of the 59 Central American deportees taking up the rear half of
the airliner, on seats for which the U.S. government paid $288 per
one-way ticket.
   When he arrived at his rural home near the town of Chapeltique,
Martinez' mother, Maria Angela Sorto, was cooking over a wood fire
in the house's tiny, smoke-blackened kitchen. She stepped out to
greet him with a grin of relief.
   ``Thank God, you returned,'' she said. ``It worries me when you
are so far away.''
   He took off his shirt and ate the small plate of eggs, rice and
thick corn tortillas his mother served with a plastic tumbler of
cool water from the well.
   His father, Ernesto Martinez, was bathing in the river down a
hill behind the house. Towel slung over his shoulder, he returned as
Jose Joel ate and warmly greeted his son.
   The house has electricity but no running water. A tree trunk in
the middle of the floor holds up a red clay roof. A hammock is the
principal piece of furniture.
   On one concrete wall, Ernesto Martinez had written in chalk the
date his son left for the United States.
   The father said things had been calm locally, but that the week
before, in a battle 25 miles to the north, four of Jose Joel's army
buddies had been killed. The younger Martinez, stunned, pulled from
a shelf a pile of photographs showing him in battle fatigues with
two of the dead, drinking hot pepper sauce as part of ``toughness''
training.
   An hour later, several soldiers, fingers-on-triggers, marched by
the house on patrol.
   The next morning, Martinez said he would try to get work at the
jute farm where his father earns 10 colones ($2) a day.
   ``If I had been able to work in the United States,'' he said, ``I
could have lived in a place with a bed and a mattress.''
   Later, he added, ``Maybe I will return to the United States.''

   Sales of cars and light trucks rose 8.2 percent in
early August compared with last year, partly because of buying by
consumers seeking to avoid price increases for 1990 model cars, the
companies reported.
   Vehicles assembled by the eight major automakers in the United

   Increased food value, higher yields and disease resistance are

   Soybeans are used in cooking oils and other foods as well as
high-protein livestock feed.
   The agreement won't result in formation of a new venture by

   A surge in early-August car and truck sales may be
an indication that consumers are shying away from waiting for this
fall's 1990 model cars and the higher prices they will be carrying.
   Figures released Tuesday by the eight major automakers with U.S.
assembly plants showed that car and truck sales during the Aug. 1-10
period rose 8.2 percent over the same period last year. Car sales
were up 7.4 percent and truck sales rose 9.4 percent.
   Late 1989 model cars may be looking more attractive to consumers
who have heard recent news of tentative price increases by the Big
Three automakers ranging from 3.4 percent to 5 percent for 1990
models.
   The increased sales also may have been fueled by manufacturers'
incentives, which have been around in some form since early April.
   When asked if he thought some consumers planning to buy a 1990
car had decided to beat the price increases by purchasing a late
1989 model, analyst Ron Glantz said flatly, ``I hope so.
   ``I think in all probability there are people buying a little
earlier than usual, but not many,'' said Glantz of Montgomery
Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   He said that later this month and next month, as the 1989 model
year draws to a close, more people may decide to buy now rather than
wait for later.
   ``We haven't had any dealer advertisements yet saying `Beat the
price increase.' They should start soon,'' he said.
   General Motors Corp. said its tentative prices will be about 3.4
percent above 1898 levels, Ford Motor Co. said its prices will jump
about 4.8 percent and Chrysler Corp.'s 1990 prices will be about 5
percent more than in 1989.
   The companies said some of the increases are due to governmental
requirements that they install passive restraint systems _ air bags
or automatic seat belts _ in 1990 model cars.
   ``Let's face it, the consumer won't pay for safety,'' Glantz said.
   The wild card in late 1989 and early 1990 model year sales
promises to be incentives. Automakers and some dealers would like to
get rid of them, but consumers are used to being told how big a
rebate they'll get if they drive away in a new car now.
   ``They (manufacturers) are filing for pretty big price
increases,'' said analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
in New York. ``But whether they will be real-world (prices) or just
on paper to be superseded with rebates is a good question.
   ``I think they will wait for about 15 minutes, see that sales are
slow and come out with rebates.''
   The incentives are designed to give sales a boost, but they
haven't done the kind of job this year as they have in the past.
   From Jan. 1 through Aug. 10, car and truck sales were 3.6 percent
behind last year's pace, falling to an average daily rate of 38,063
from a rate of 39,500 in the year-ago period. Car sales were off 4.8
percent and truck sales were down 1.5 percent.

<HEAD>Video Retailer Challenges $100 Million Libel Award</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home Shopping Network Inc. pitches
cookware and jewelry to millions of TV viewers, but the video
retailer's more important audience is a judge who will rule on its
appeal of a $100 million libel award.
   The financially ailing company, which could be devastated by such
a large forfeiture, is seeking to reverse or reduce the jury award
granted GTE Corp. earlier this month.
   In an earlier lawsuit of its own, HSN had accused GTE of
installing an inadequate telephone system at the retailer's
Clearwater headquarters, which it blamed for missed calls from
viewers and the loss of millions of dollars worth of sales.
   But the case boomeranged on HSN when GTE successfully
countersued, claiming that its reputation was smeared by HSN's
accusations, which it called false.
   The HSN appeal awaiting state Circuit Judge Howard Rives when he
returns from vacation later this month alleges 336 faults in the
six-week case, ranging from improper evidence to Rives' demeanor,
described as grumpy.
   The Aug. 2 verdict ``was grossly excessive and was the product of
prejudice, passion and gross confusion,'' said HSN in its appeal
motions filed Monday.
   Much of the appeal focuses on Rives' decision to permit GTE's
libel counterclaim to be heard in the same trial as the $1.5 billion
HSN suit. Rives also is accused of prejudicing jurors against HSN
and its attorneys.
   GTE spokeswoman Jan Morris declined to comment on the motions,
but said the Stamford, Conn.-based telecommunications giant would
answer the challenges in court.
   A hearing on the appeal before Rives has been set for Nov. 28.
   ``This promises to go on for months,'' said HSN spokewoman Kathy
Jurado. ``We said all along we'll try to get this overturned.''
   Nonetheless, some people familiar with the case speculate that
GTE may be interested in settling the matter by working out a lower
settlement with HSN, which claimed it lost $500 million in sales
when GTE's telephone system could not handle an increasing volume of
calls in 1986 and 1987.
   GTE executives also were accused of trying to hide the problem
from HSN, which now uses MCI Communications Corp. telephones.
   ``GTE is in a very strong bargaining position,'' said James
Stork, an analyst with the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps
Inc. ``This is really not a large amount of money for a company like
GTE. They might just make some sort of deal to end it.''
   In closing trial arguments, GTE attorney Roy Reardon said the
company only wanted to clear its name and did not want to devastate
HSN with a huge award. ``I didn't come down here to look for
money,'' he told the jury.
   The judgement, one of the highest ever awarded in a libel case,
struck the 7-year-old video retail pioneer at a bad time.
   HSN reported slumping sales and a $5.9 million loss for the
quarter ended May 31. For all of 1988, the company reported a profit
of $18 million on sales of $730 million. Its stock, which surged to
$47 a share in mid-1987, bottomed out at $3 a share hours after the
jury verdict.
   Meanwhile, two of HSN's principal competitors plan to merge next
month. CVN Cos. of Minneapolis and QVC Network of West Chester, Pa.,
say their combined sales will knock HSN from the top spot in video
retailing for the first time.
   Some legal experts said HSN's best option is to aggressively
appeal the libel ruling. Floyd Abrams, a libel-law specialist, said
he believed the facts of the case did not support the huge award.
   ``If there is no evidence that GTE suffered damages as the result
of the libel, it will be difficult for the damage verdict to be
sustained because of its elephantine nature,'' he said.
   However, Abrams noted that the award _ even if knocked down _
could encourge more companies to file libel suits in cases of rumors
or common corporate bad-mouthing in the hope that other juries are
equally generous.
   Earlier this month, American Express Co. admitted its
representatives circulated false stories claiming that international
banker Edmond Safra, an Amex competitor, was tied to money
laundering. American Express opted for an $8 million settlement
rather that risk a possible libel battle in court.

   Texas Air Corp. suffered a $719 million loss last
year, the most of any U.S. airline company. But Chairman Frank
Lorenzo's $1.25 million cash compensation made him one of the
nation's highest-paid airline chief executives.
   Texas Air's annual proxy statement, which is being mailed to
stockholders this week, says Lorenzo received salary and bonuses of
$977,225 and ``relocation'' compensation of $275,000.
   Houston-based Texas Air is the parent company of Eastern
Airlines, which is in bankruptcy reorganization because of a
5-month-old strike by the pilots, Machinists and flight attendants
unions. Texas Air also owns Continental Airlines, which went through
bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 during similar labor strife.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent declined to discuss Lorenzo's salary.
   But Eastern's unions called it is outrageous, especially since he
has constantly demanded concessions from them.
   ``Given the fact that he's put two airlines in bankruptcy and
hasn't done anything for the common stockholders, I think it's
atrocious,'' pilots union spokesman Ron Cole told The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
   By comparison, AMR Corp., parent of industry profit leader
American Airlines, paid its chairman, Robert Crandall, salary and
bonuses of $1 million last year. Highly profitable Delta Air Lines
will not publish its new proxy until next month. But in fiscal 1988,
Delta Chairman Ronald W. Allen earned cash compensation of $456,683.

<HEAD>Integrated To Sell Financial Services, Restructure Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Integrated Resources Inc., the struggling
financial concern, plans to sell its core assets in another
restructuring effort to emerge from under a $1.75 billion mountain
of debt.
   Integrated said Tuesday it was trying to sell key subsidiaries
including its two life insurance companies, its investment products
distributor and its asset management business to prevent the spread
of its financial woes.
   ``We recognized that if we don't do something to take the
insurance companies and some of the other companies away from the
problems of the parent company, we were going to have more
deteriorations,'' Integrated's co-chief executive, Arthur Goldberg,
said in an interview.
   Integrated, which in June halted payments on the short-term
portion of its debt, projected a $600 million loss for the quarter
ended June 30 and said that sales of its investment products have
declined and withdrawals have increased.
   The latest restructuring proposal was greeted with no enthusiasm
on Wall Street, where Integrated stock lost 75 cents to close at $2
and some of the New York firm's bonds fell sharply in New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered Integrated's credit rating
Tuesday, citing the second-quarter loss forecast and the firm's
announcement that it would not be able to pay interest on 12\
percent notes due Aug. 15.
   S&amp;P also cast doubt on the new plan, saying that ``significant
uncertainty exists with regard to the success of any restructuring
plan.'' Some bondholders said the firm's reduced asset base after
the subsidiary sales would lower its earnings ability.
   Integrated said it valued the financial services companies at
$450 million to $525 million and that sale proceeds would be used to
meet obligations to senior debt holders. It said the firm's total
assets were worth $1.17 billion to $1.25 billion, compared with
$1.75 billion in total debt.
   The latest restructuring replaces one announced in late June that
included $300 million in financing from its long-time adviser,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Integrated officials met with bondholders Tuesday to discuss the
latest plan, which emerged after the firm decided it couldn't
support the debt level in the first refinancing.
   Integrated's June default on $955 million in short-term
commercial paper capped a steady demise for the once high-flying
real estate and insurance concern, whose stock nosedived from much
as $40 a share in 1986 and $16 a share in late May.
   After the spinoff of subsidiaries, Integrated's main businesses
would be managementof existing public and private limited
partnerships and real estate investment trusts. It says it won't
sell any new products until at least next year.
   Integrated's other co-chief executive, Stephen Weinroth, on
Monday took a leave of absence from Drexel, where he is managing
director of corporate finance. Weinroth has been on Integrated's
board since 1983 and was elected chairman Aug. 1 and co-chief
executive Saturday.
   Integrated said that if the sale of the subsidiaries falls
through it will spin them off to its senior debt holders.
   The subsidiaries are Integrated Resources Life Insurance Co. of
Des Moines, Iowa; Capitol Life Insurance Co. of Denver; Integrated
Resources Equity Corp. of Englewood, Colo., and New York, its
principal investment products distributor; Integrated Resources
Asset Management Corp.; Resources Trust Co.; and Financial Clearing
Services.

<BYLINE>Choice Of Airline Sometimes Comes Down to Peanuts</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the fare wars and safety fears, sometimes
choosing which airline to fly boils down to the peanuts.
   Airline officials say amenities ranging from snack packs to full
cans of soft drink are a top priority even in this age of cut-rate
tickets and scaled-back service.
   ``If we ever run out of peanuts, they (passengers) are quite
perturbed,'' said Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for American Airlines
in Fort Worth, Texas. ``They expect a little munchie with their
flight.''
   And if the munchies run short?
   ``If they're very mad, the flight attendant may ask another
passenger to voluntarily give their peanuts up,'' Ms. O'Neill said.
   Although airline advertisements in this age of deregulation focus
on low fares and convenient schedules, most fliers still apparently
expect to get their freebies, which of course are not really free.
Most amenities are built into the cost of a ticket.
   Bill Jackman, a spokesman for the Washington-based airline
industry organization Air Transport Association, said major U.S.
carriers expect to spend about $2 billion this year on food service.
He said he was unsure how that would be divided between snacks and
meals.
   The importance of snacks, drinks, magazines, toiletry kits and
toy captain's wings for the kids was underscored earlier this month
in the USAir merger with Piedmont Airlines. Piedmont traditionally
served passengers a full can of soda, while USAir provided only a
cup of the drink.
   The merged airline decided to adopt the full-can practice to
avoid miffed passengers.
   ``Let me put it this way,'' said Edwin I. Colodny, chairman and
president of USAir Group Inc. ``There will be no complaints on the
Coca-Cola service.''
   Jackman said complimentary service dates to the beginning of the
commercial airline industry, when carriers would fill seats with
their own employees to reduce anxiety among passengers afraid of the
then-new form of travel.
   ``In the early days there was widespread fear of flying,''
Jackman said. ``All kinds of inducements were offered.''
   Jackman said efforts to comfort passengers evolved into free
snacks and cocktails and hit its heyday in the 1970s, when airline
regulation standardized fares and the companies had to provide
something to distinguish their service.
   Those were the days of piano bars, complimentary champagne and
platters of roast beef sliced at your seat. Jackman said one airline
hired an aerobics instructor to demonstrate exercises in the aisle.
   ``In the days prior to deregulation, when everything (fares) was
the same, you had to differentiate by on-board service. They'd go to
great lengths to describe their food,'' he said.
   One of the best-known children of deregulation that tried to make
it without freebies, People Express, failed after a few years.
   In-flight goodies vary among airlines and are more extensive as
the passenger class rises. The most common items are soft drinks and
peanuts.
   Pan American's business class passengers get a mixed snack pack
including nuts, pretzels and sesame sticks instead of just peanuts,
said Pamela Hanlon, a spokeswoman in New York. They also receive
complimentary cocktails or wine and an ``amenities kit,'' containing
toothpaste, hand lotion and other toiletries.
   On dinner flights, frequent fliers get to choose meals from a
menu of about nine items, Ms. Hanlon said.
   ``Certainly, in first class or business class that does make a
difference,'' she said of the complimentary items. ``I think it's
part of the decision (of which airline to fly).''
   Advances in technology and changing social customs also have
influenced airline handouts.
   Jim Lundy, spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said many airlines used
to distribute complimentary mini-packs of cigarettes and matches to
passengers. That stopped when smoking became less acceptable.
   In the old days before cabins were pressurized, the airlines gave
passengers a stick of chewing gum to help equalize the pressure in
their ears.
   Those seemingly little things make a strong impression on
consumers, said Naresh Malhotra, professor and coordinator of
marketing and management science at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.
   ``The consumer is buying a bundle of benefits, rather than just
the basic transportation,'' Malhotra said.
   ``There's symbolic value, in that the consumer feels he's being
treated in the right manner. And, on longer flights, it becomes
necessary. You've got to have something to eat. You've got to have
something to drink,'' he said.

   The U.S. dollar declined against the Japanese yen
today after a four-day climb, while stock prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rose for the second day.
   The dollar closed at 141.80, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's close
of 142.20 yen. It opened at 141.70 yen and moved between 141.40 yen
and 141.90 yen. The dollar had risen 3.35 yen in four trading days
before today's decline.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 139.07 points
Tuesday, rose 273.46 points, or 0.79 percent, closing at 35,084.15.
   Dealers said the U.S. currency started lower following
dollar-selling on the Singapore and Sydney foreign exchange markets,
but rose in afternoon trading, which remained light.
   ``Japanese trust banks bought dollars aggressively toward the
close,'' said Minori Takeuchi, a trader at Chemical Bank.
   Minoru Ozawa, a foreign exchange dealer with the Taiyo Kobe Bank,
said dealers were positioning themselves before announcements of
U.S. housing starts and investment utilization rates today.
   The stock market today ``was quite strong, with the advance quite
broad-based,'' said a trader at Kleinwort Benson International, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Trading was light at 550 million shares. Traders said there was a
fair amount of index buying, with people returning from summer
holidays contributing to the advance.
   Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities said stock traders, too,
were awaiting the U.S. announcements, but were optimistic.

   The U.S. dollar was lower in early European trading
today as market participants took profits ahead of a series of U.S.
economic figures to be released later this week, currency dealers
said.
   Gold prices rose.
   Dealers said many in the market chose to cut out before
Washington today releases industrial activity and housing starts
figures for July, the June trade report on Thursday and the consumer
price index on Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 141.80 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 142.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.9435 West German marks, down from 1.9500; 1.6749
Swiss francs, down from 1.6790; 6.5650 French francs, down from
6.5835; 2.1847 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1905; 1,395.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,397.50; and 1.1785 Canadian dollars, down from

   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound. It
cost $1.5751 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5735 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at $368.25 a troy ounce, compared with late
Tuesday's $365.75. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $367.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $367.90, up from $366.25 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.12 to close at $368.84.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.24 a troy ounce, unchanged from
late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Arco Marketing Low-Pollution Fuel in Southern California</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to ADD details of air cleanup plan. NO pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. plans to market a
lead-free gasoline for older cars and trucks that use leaded gas and
said the new fuel could cut pollution from such vehicles by up to 15
percent.
   The gasoline will go on sale next month at 750 Arco stations in
Southern California for about the same price as leaded regular
gasoline, Arco said Tuesday.
   The announcement came the same day the California Air Resources
Board unanimously adopted a sweeping 20-year plan to clean Southern
California's air, the nation's dirtiest. It will transform the way
Californians work and play.
   Arco's new gasoline was created to reduce pollution caused by the
estimated 1.2 million worst-polluting vehicles in the region _ cars
made before 1975 and trucks built before 1980.
   Arco's refinery in Carson will produce the gasoline, which is
called EC-1 for Emission Control-1 and cost about $20 million to
develop.
   ``We're making this heavy investment because we believe the
dominant fuel of the future will be gasoline, rather than the
alternatives you've been hearing about,'' said Lodwrick M. Cook,
Arco chairman and chief executive officer. Those alternatives
include methanol and natural gas.
   ``What we hope to demonstrate today is that we can clean up
gasoline,'' Cook said.
   The fuel has an octane level of 88 and contains methyl tertiary
butyl ether, which Arco spokesman Al Greenstein described as an
oxygenated additive.
   ``The MTBE is what makes up for the loss of octane by eliminating
the lead,'' he said. ``It's something that's on the market that
wasn't available a few years ago.''
   Arco officials said the fuel reduces chemical components that
cause smog by about one-third, and benzene, a cancer-causing
pollutant, by half. The fuel-sulfur content was reduced by 80
percent.
   ``We're pleased that Arco has taken the initiative in developing
a new gasoline that is more environmentally acceptable and which
reflects the direction of the Air Resources Board's future
regulation,'' said board Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless.
   The board Tuesday voted 8-0 to adopt the smog-control plan
despite industry objections the plan will strangle the region's
economy. It will target emissions from everything from motor
vehicles, factories and auto paint to dry cleaners, bakeries,
aerosol cans and backyard grills.
   The plan embraces land-use planning, transportation programs and
stricter industry standards. It was completed in March by the South
Coast Air Quality Management District and the Southern California
Association of Governments.
   Regional air quality officials estimate that the plan will cost
$2.6 billion a year. Business interests say annual costs will reach
$12 billion.
   Enactment was hailed as a ``leap into a `Brave New World''' by
Harriet Wieder, an Orange County supervisor on the nine-member air
resources board.
   The plan was branded ``Texas justice'' by William T. Huston, a
developer leading a coalition of business and labor interests
fighting to revise the plane. ``They're acting as their own judge,
jury and executioner,'' he said.
   Arco is working on another blend that will be sold elsewhere in
the West, the company said. Arco stations are in five Western
states: California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada.
   When asked if Arco was pushed, or jumped, to develop the
alternative to leaded fuel, Cook said, ``A little of both ... but if
there are cleaner fuels to be burned, we'll be producing those too.''

<HEAD>UAL, Pilots' Union, Consider Employee-Ownership Option</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Line Pilots Association has told its
United Airlines members they have difficult choices ahead amid
reports the union and the carrier are considering plans including an
employee-owned stake in the company.
   ALPA Chairman Rick Dubinsky said in a letter to union members
Tuesday that United's parent, UAL Corp. _ which has received a $5.4
billion, $240-a-share takeover proposal from investor Marvin Davis _
undoubtedly will be bought out by somebody.
   ``In fact, whether you like it or not, you and all the other
employees are going to help pay for it,'' Dubinsky said. ``The only
choice is whether we buy it for someone else or ourselves.''
   He said United pilots may have to ``act rapidly, decisively and
conclusively to assure our survival and prosperity,'' noting
acquisition by an outsider likely would mean a leveraged buyout that
could saddle the company with loads of new debt.
   ``We must watch this situation very closely, insuring that we
have all the information we need to make the difficult choices that
are inevitable,'' Dubinsky said.
   UAL stock closed $4.25 lower at $254.25 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Several news reports indicated ALPA and UAL officials met during
the weekend to discuss a plans for either a management-employee
buyout or recapitalization that would put a big enough block of UAL
stock in an employee stock ownership plan to help block any hostile
takeover attempt.
   Spokesmen for UAL and ALPA refused to comment Tuesday on whether
meetings were held during the weekend or on reports of the purported
plans.
   ``There's nothing out there to make me feel tremendously
uncomfortable,'' said John Peterpaul, vice president of the
International Association of Machinists, referring to the reported
discussions on a buyout plan. ``We're sitting here watching it.''
   The Machinists union represents mechanics at United and other
airlines. The third union representing United employees, the
Association of Flight Attendants, did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
   Dubinsky said in his letter that the level of contribution to any
ESOP plan by the pilots would depend on the number of employees and
employee groups participating.
   ``Depending on the declared interest of the other employees, we
may need a great level of participation or a slight level,'' his
letter read. ``It would make good sense for you to be financially
prepared for the worst.''
   United's pilots in the past have expressed an interest in buying
the company, and in 1987 proposed a $4.5 billion plan to buy the
airline from its then-parent Allegis Corp. Last week ALPA officials
said its advisers were being consulted about the Davis bid.
   In addition to Davis, New York-based Pan Am Corp. has expressed
interest in a possible merger with UAL.
   Louis Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.,
said a deal involving UAL management and its employees would
eliminate fears in Congress and the Department of Transportation
that the airline would be stripped of valuable assets, as might
happen with a leveraged buyout.
   A leveraged buyout is an acquisition financed mainly by borrowed
funds that are repaid with the target company's cash flow or the
sale of its assets.
   ``With that kind of plan, you would assure continuation of UAL as
a strong airline,'' he said, referring to a management-labor buyout.
``It would create labor peace, which would be pretty important in
the future.''

<HEAD>Food Distributor May Be Sold To Prevent Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All or part of the Di Giorgio Corp. food
distributor may be sold to prevent a hostile $165 million takeover
by New Jersey investor Arthur Goldberg, the company said.
   Di Giorgio Chairman Peter Scott said Tuesday the company's board
does not believe the $32-per-share offer by Goldberg's DIG
Acquisition Corp. reflects the true value of the firm.
   At a meeting Monday, the company's directors unanimously rejected
Goldberg's offer as inadequate.
   The board said Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. had been hired to
explore the possible sale of part or all of the company, which
distributes fresh and frozen foods and manufactures building
materials.
   Goldberg, who owns 14.1 percent of the company's stock, has
hinted that if he succeeded in his bid, he would keep Di Giorgio's
White Rose food distribution subsidiary but sell off the building
materials business.
   The Di Giorgio board in June rejected a Goldberg bid of $30 a
share, or $153 million.
   Other investors expressing interest in Di Giorgio in recent years
have included New York investor Mario Gabelli, London-based MIM
Ltd., and the Belzberg family of Canada.

   Gaming analysts believe Resorts
International Inc. will have to make a dramatic move to pull out of
its financial slump.
   On Tuesday, one day after Resorts posted a large second-quarter
loss, the conclusions were near unanimous:
   ``They have got to recapitalize in some way, shape or form,''
said Saul Leonard, a Los Angeles-based analyst with Laventhol &amp;
Horwath.
   With two gaming halls, ``selling one might be a very viable
alternative,'' he said.
   Resorts blamed its second-quarter losses on slower casino
business, but analysts said the company must go beyond simply
finding more gamblers.
   At stake in the financial crunch is the casino license of owner
Merv Griffin, the entertainer who purchased the company last year
from developer Donald Trump.
   State gaming regulators will hold hearings next month to consider
whether Resorts has enough financial stability to change Griffin's
interim authorization into a license.
   Resorts, based here, will have to pay more than $130 million in
interest and principal this year, but its operations likely will not
generate enough money to cover that. In 1988, the company's cash
flow was only $60.2 million.
   According to figures issued Monday, Resorts posted a $27.9
million net loss for the second quarter of 1989, compared to a $13.8
million net loss for the same period in 1988.
   For the first six months of 1989, the company reported a net loss
of $46.6 million, compared to a $17.6 million net loss for last
year's first half.
   Resorts' earnings from operations for the second quarter were
reported at $411,000, compared to $8.9 million for the same period
last year. Earnings from operations for the first six months were
$6.1 million, compared to $12.9 million for the 1988 first half.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Resorts
blamed shrinking revenue at its Atlantic City casino on fewer bets
wagered by patrons.
   ``The transitional state of the company's marketing efforts
contributed to this, as did the fact that during the second quarter,
portions of the casino were out of service due to renovations,''
said a statement by a public relations firm for the gaming and real
estate company.
   Resorts also cited lower revenues at its Paradise Island casino
because of a ``significant decrease in the table game hold
percentage'' _ the ratio of casino win to the total amount of chips
purchased.
   Some news about Resorts' future plans will come at a bondholders'
meeting here set for Sept. 19. Company executives said they will
outline a revised business plan, including a possible capital
restructuring.
   In reviewing the Resorts crisis in recent weeks, analysts have
said one option is an exchange offer in which holders of some or all
of the company's $930 million in junk bonds would be offered equity
in return for relinquishing debt.
   Griffin, however, ``is going to have a very hard time
renegotiating his debt simply because he has already taken the
bondholders to the cleaners,'' said Marvin B. Roffman, a gaming
analyst with the Philadelphia investment house of Janney Montgomery
Scott Inc.
   The bondholders, he said, ``could take Merv to court and stick it
to him for misstatements in the offering prospectus.''
   Griffin faces further woes, Roffman said, including ``a declining
market, higher operating costs, eroding market shares caused by
woefully inadequate facilities and potential labor problems with
upcoming union talks.''
   ``And in the middle of all this, that interest rate meter just
doesn't stop ticking,'' he said.
   Griffin will likely have to add more of his own money into
Resorts, Roffman said.
   Leonard was a bit more optimistic. ``There are always options.
The question is whether they are options that Merv Griffin would
prefer,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial production rose a moderate 0.2
percent in July, but the factory operating rate remained flat, the
Federal Reserve Board said today in a report that indicated further
easing of inflationary pressures.
   Factory use held steady at 83.6 percent last month after
declining 0.3 percentage point in June, the central bank said. The
rate hit a 10-year high of 84.3 percent last December. Last month's
operating rate was down from 83.7 percent a year earlier.
   The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the
greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading
to shortages and price increases. Analysts generally consider an
operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of
inflationary pressures.
   The central bank has been straddling a fine line of keeping
interest rates high enough to cool inflationary pressures without
slowing growth so much that the economy slides into a recession. It
began letting rates drop in June as inflation seemed to lessen.
   The Federal Reserve said its industrial production index in July
stood at 141.7 percent of its 1977 base, up from 141.4 percent in
June.
   The 0.2 percent increase last month came after revised 0.1
percent drops in both May and June. Those were the first downturns
since the index fell 0.2 percent in February, which had been the
first drop in a year.
   But the Fed said the July gain mainly reflected a rebound in the
output of raw materials and continued strength in business equipment
excluding autos.
   ``In contract, automoobile and truck production fell sharply, and
output of construction supplies, on balance, remained weak,'' it
said.
   Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and
non-durable goods rose 0.2 percent. Output was up 0.3 percent at
mines and oil wells and 0.8 percent at utilities.
   The factory operating rate dipped 0.1 percentage point to 83.9
percent at manufacturing plants, down from June's revised 84
percent. The rate had peaked at 84.7 percent in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods _ big-ticket items
expected to last more than three years _ fell 0.3 percentage point
from 82.6 percent in June.
   The rate at factories producing nondurable goods rose to 86.2
percent, from 86.1 percent in June.

   The stock market opened broadly higher today,
shaking off its latest doldrums.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 13.28 points to
2,701.06 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 647 issues up, 308 down and 500 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 24.89 million shares.
   Analysts said the market could break out of its recent sluggish
mood after having digested interest-rate worries that helped depress
bond prices lately.
   Wall Street analysts said earlier this week that the markets were
adjusting to the likelihood that the Federal Reserve might not lower
interest rates after government statistics in recent weeks showed a
moderately expanding economy.
   ``The market looks like it wants to move ahead on a fairly broad
front,'' said Lewis Smith, analyst with Bear Stearns Cos.
   A Commerce Department report this morning that new housing starts
rose 0.8 percent last month had little impact on the market so far,
traders said.
   New homes and apartments were built in July at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million units, up from 1.42 million
units in June, the government said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.65 to 192.73.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had gained
1.06 to 380.88.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.86 points to
finish at 2,687.78 in sluggish trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in

<HEAD>K-H Fails To Meet Terms of Varity Merger Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K-H Corp. said it failed to meet the terms
of the merger agreement it expected to complete next month with
Toronto-based Varity Corp.
   K-H, formerly known as Fruehauf Corp., said Tuesday it notified
Varity a day earlier that it had not realized enough money from the
July 14 sale of its trailer and maritime operations to Terex Corp.
to meet the agreement with Varity. Fruehauf agreed in March to sell
the operations to Terex for about $233 million.
   Varity has 15 days to decide whether to go ahead with the merger,
K-H spokesman David Hladik said.
   Varity Chairman Victor Rice wrote Tuesday to K-H, estimating that
K-H's shortfall was $25 million to $30 million and questioning how
its earlier figure ``could be regarded even as a reasonable or good
faith estimate.''
   Rice said Varity would continue studying the matter. ``That's
really all we're going to say, what's in the letter,'' Varity
spokesman J.R. Nowling said today.
   Fruehauf Corp. changed its name Aug. 4 to K-H Corp., after the
sale to Terex. K-H Corp. President Robert Siefert said then the
acquisition of K-H by Varity should be completed next month.
   K-H said Tuesday the sale to Terex contributed to a $18.2 million
loss in the second quarter. The company lost $10.8 million in the
second quarter of 1988.
   The company said its revenue was $333.8 million for the quarter,
up from $286.5 million in the year-earlier period.
   For the first six months of the year, K-H reported a loss of
$259.9 million on revenue of $669.1 million, compared with a loss of
$27.1 million on revenue of $549.4 million in the first half of 1988.
   K-H said $13.5 million of its $18.2 million second-quarter loss
was attributable to sales of the trailer and maritime operations to
Terex Corp.
   Fruehauf had battled heavy indebtedness and weak earnings since
1986 when its managers avoided a hostile takeover by acquiring
control in a debt-financed buyout.
   The sale of the truck-trailer and maritime operations to Terex
left Kelsey-Hayes Co., maker of aluminum wheels and anti-lock
braking systems, as Fruehauf Corp.'s major business.
   The trailer business continues as Fruehauf Trailer Corp., a Terex
subsidiary, while Fruehauf Corp. changed its name to K-H.

<HEAD>Transport Ministry Asks Northwest to Improve Plane Maintenance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Ministry of Transport asked Northwest
Airlines Wednesday to improve its servicing of planes at Tokyo's
Narita airport, a ministry official said.
   The ministry urged Northwest to improve its maintenance because
the airline's planes have been involved in many of the flight
irregularities at Narita in recent months, the official said.
   ``A large number of Northwest flights have had to return to the
airport or be diverted because of technical problems, including
engine malfunctions,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Northwest officials in Tokyo could not be reached for comment
immediately. At the airline's Eagan, Minn., headquarters, spokesman
Kevin Whalen said officials there had not heard anything of the
reported request and therefore could not comment in detail.
   Whalen said he was trying to reach Northwest officials in Japan,
but had been unsuccessful because it was late at night there.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service quoted Narita officials as saying
Northwest planes were involved in 16 of the 43 cases, or 38 percent,
of flight irregularities at the airport so far this year.
   Kyodo said the 16 Northwest irregularities this year included 12
in which planes were forced to return to Narita after takeoff and
four in which planes were diverted, mainly because of engine
problems.
   Whalen said he could not say if those numbers were correct.
   ``But we do have 22 departures a day from Narita, so we're
talking nearly 5,300 departures so far this year and it would be a
fraction of a percentage (involving problems), if those numbers are
right,'' he said.
   United Airlines had five flight irregularities, the second
largest number, Kyodo quoted the officials as saying.
   United spokesman Rob Doughty said he could not immediately
confirm that United had five flight irregularities this year at
Narita. He said that to his knowledge, Japanese transportation
officials had not asked United to improve its servicing of planes at
the airport.

   A new agreement has been reached between the
Philippines and its creditor banks, the second under the
debt-reduction proposals of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, an
international monetary source said today.
   The source said the accord would both reduce the country's $28
billion debt and add new loans to it.
   In last month's agreement on the $108 billion debt of Mexico, a
choice was given to creditor banks: loan reductions, interest
reductions or new loans. Whether Mexico's total debt will be larger
or smaller remains to be worked out.
   The source said the new agreement was reached in New York between
representatives of the Philippine government and a committee of
banks led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
International Monetary Fund last May offered the Philippines about
$206 million in loans that the government of President Corazon
Aquino could use for debt relief. In the present state of the
market, the government can settle old loans for about 50 cents on
the dollar.
   The Washington Post, which first reported the debt agreement,
cited Treasury officials and bankers saying they don't consider the
accord a break with the Brady plan because it envisions that the
Philippines will try to reduce its indebtedness.
   Additional money for debt relief is expected from the World Bank,
the fund's sister organization in Washington.
   The money could also be used to reduce interest rates on the old
loans. The burden of interest payments is the heaviest part of the
Third World's $1.3 trillion debt.
   Recent reports have said that the Philippines was less interested
in reduction of its debts to the commercial banks, than in new loans
from them. Jose Fernandez, head of the Philippines central bank, has
been reported seeking $1.8 to $4 billion.
   Of the $28 billion the Philippines already owes, the bulk is held
by governments and intergovernment bodies like the fund and World
Bank, which have not permitted any reductions.

   Eastern Airlines, trying to recover from a crippling
strike and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings, hopes to win back
passengers by expanding its schedule and cutting fares.
   But a union leader said Tuesday the newly announced fare
reductions by Eastern's competitors, including Trans World Airlines,
Pan American World Airways, United Airlines, American Airlines and
USAir, would hurt Eastern's efforts to rebuild.
   The carrier on Tuesday increased from 350 to 390 its daily
flights by adding 40 flights connecting Atlanta and destinations
mostly in the South and said it would fly 600 daily flights as of
Sept. 7.
   Eastern's rebuilding plan calls for 800 daily flights by year's
end, leaving the airline at about two-thirds its size before its
machinists, pilots and flight attendants walked off the job and the
carrier entered bankruptcy court proceedings in March.
   Eastern also announced discounted fares beginning Sept. 7,
including fares of $79 one-way between New York and Florida and $129
one-way between Atlanta and the West Coast. The airline said the
fares have fewer restrictions than the reduced fares announced this
week by other major carriers and allow full refunds on unused
tickets.
   George Brennan, Eastern's vice president for marketing, said the
airline already planned new discounts before the other carriers and
that Eastern's fall promotion offers tickets that ``are much easier
to use and a much better value in most cases.''
   Eastern will require three- to-seven-day advance purchase and its
rates are available nearly every day and carry no restrictive
penalties.
   The fares are available to all domestic markets, Eastern said.
   While Eastern says it has hired enough pilots and is keeping up
with maintenance despite its strike, it has been leasing five planes
and crews from its affiliated carrier, Continental Airlines. Brennan
said more planes and crews will be temporarily leased from
Continental.
   Eastern and Continental are both subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp.
   Eastern union leaders said the airline's claims to be coming back
are misleading because their low fares make it impossible to make
money.
   Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan said Tuesday
passengers are going to fly on other airlines because ``they are
very reliable, first-line carriers. They're not having phantom
flights and people don't have to worry about losing their money.
   ``If Eastern tries to go even lower than the rest of the
carriers, that's just going to compound their problems. It's going
to doom the rebuilding plan, which was already doomed,'' Bryan said.
   Eastern before the March 4 strike usually had $1 billion in
revenue per quarter. In the second quarter, Eastern reported revenue
of $89.6 million.
   Management hurdled a major barrier to its rebuilding efforts last
week when a split in pilots union ranks resulted in at least 250
more pilots returning to work, boosting to 650 the number of union
members that have crossed picket lines.
   Eastern said that with its own recruitment and training program
it now has the 1,700 pilots needed for its rebuilding plan.

   Stock prices drifted off their early highs as the
market lost some of its momentum.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 7.21 points to
2,694.99 at 11 a.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 13.28 points
an hour earlier.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 3 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 712 issues up, 459 down and 571 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 54.15 million shares.
   Analysts said volume was turning lackluster after a strong start.
   ``The market is starting to give ground. It seems to have hit the
summer doldrums,'' said Larry Wachtel, analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``It avoided it for two months.''
   Traders said the market may need more time to digest recent gains
which took the Dow Jones industrials to near all-time highs last
week.
   Government reports this morning on July U.S. industrial
production and capacity utilization and housing starts appeared to
be in line with expectations and had little impact on the market,
analysts said.
   The Commerce Department reported that new housing starts rose 0.8
percent last month. And industrial production rose a moderate 0.2
percent in July, but the factory operating rate remained flat, the
Federal Reserve Board said.

   Grain futures opened lower and soybean futures
were mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The weak opening caught analysts by surprise because of
expectations that yesterday's rebound in prices would carry over
into today's trading.
   The buying of soybean futures could be restricted because of the
uncertain weather outlook, said Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Earlier this week, forecasts called
for a relatively dry weekend in major crop producing states. Now
more rain is being forecast.
   Wheat futures are expected to be pressured by reports that
Algeria's bid for 250,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat under the export
bonus program has been rejected.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.98\ a bushel; corn was \

   The stock market retraced some earlier gains in
moderate trading today as players remained in a cautious mode.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 6.64 points at
noon EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 7.21 points higher an hour
earlier.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 3 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 759 issues up, 493 down and 577 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 76.48 million shares.
   Analysts said activity had picked up slightly from the previous
two days but buyers remained cautious.
   A lack of strength in some blue-chip stocks, including IBM, was
hindering the market, said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst
for MKI Securities Corp.
   ``The market is still looking for a base of support following the
decline that began last week,'' Jensen said.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 29 points on Friday
after bonds skidded on new government data that showed the economy
was not as weak as previously thought. The report diminished hopes
that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates.
   Government reports this morning on July U.S. industrial
production and capacity utilization and housing starts appeared to
be in line with expectations and had little impact on the market,
analysts said.
   The Commerce Department reported that new housing starts rose 0.8

   Negotiators representing the Philippines and
the country's major bank creditors today announced a tentative
agreement on a package of debt reduction, the second pact to be
reached under the Bush administration's to new initiative.
   Philippine Central Bank Governor Jose B. Fernandez Jr., who led
his country's negotiating team, said the tentative deal met the
guidelines established by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in
March.
   ``There is no question that we must reduce the country's existing
stock of commercial bank debt if we are to sustain the country's
economic growth,'' he said. ``At the same time new commerical bank
financing is critical for our program as the combined effect of our
debt reduction initiatives and our improving economy work to bring
about the end of the debt problem for the Philippines.''
   Officials said the new accord would reduce the Philippines' $28
billion debt and also provide new loans, the two elements the
country's negotiators had considered critical to keeping the
Philippine economy expanding.
   The new debt package was the second agreement achieved under the
Brady debt plan, which is seeking to get commercial banks to forgive
a portion of their Third World loans in exchange for guarantees of
repayment of the remaining debt.
   Last month, Mexico, the developing world's second largest debtor
with $108 billion owed, reach an accord following the Brady plan's
guidelines.
   In the Mexican agreement, creditor banks were given a choice of
loan reductions, interest reductions or providing new money.
   The Philippine agreement was reached in New York between
representatives of the Philippine government and a committee of
banks led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   A source in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said

   The Chicago Board of Trade, stung by the

permanent panel to monitor trading practices at the exchange.
   The Committee on Ethics and Integrity will examine all aspects of
exchange trading practices ``to ensure the utmost of integrity and
ethical conduct,'' the Board of Trade said Tuesday in a statement.
   It said the committee was created by the unanimous vote of the
exchange's board of directors.
   In addition to creating the committee, the board also added its
fourth outside director who is not a member of the exchange. This
will bring the board's membership to 25.
   ``Integrity is the No. 1 priority of this exchange,'' said CBOT
Chairman Karsten Mahlmann. ``We feel that the addition of another
non-member director and the establishment of the Committee on Ethics
and Integrity is a natural outgrowth of this commitment.''
   A federal grand jury has indicted 46 traders at the Board of
Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, accusing them of cheating

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bell Communications Research said Wednesday it
has developed a prototype version of an inexpensive sensor for leaks
from underground fuel tanks.
   Leaking fuel can contaminate wells and reservoirs, and the
Environmental Protection Agency recently required that all
underground fuel storage tanks be monitored for leaks by the end of
1993.
   Bellcore said its sensor is made of a material that stops
conducting electricity when it absorbs fuel. When the electricity
shuts off an alarm is triggered above ground.
   Bellcore, based in Livingston, N.J., is the research arm of the
seven regional Bell telephone companies as well as Cincinnati Bell
and Southern New England Telephone. It developed the sensor for
manholes because fuel leaking into them can endanger workers and
damage cables.
   The EPA estimates there are leaks in more than 10 percent of the
3 million to 5 million underground storage tanks for gasoline,
kerosene, fuel oil and other hydrocarbon fuels across the country.
   Bellcore said it has applied for a patent and plans to license
the technology by the end of the year to other companies, including
ones that could manufacture the sensors.

   The Philips Consumer Electronics Co. has been
awarded a contract valued at more than $150 million to make and
install video hardware needed for Whittle Communications'
advertising-financed daily TV news program that debuts in schools
next spring, the companies announced today.
   The contract calls for Philips to design, manufacture and install
the communications systems needed for delivery of the Channel One
news service and other educational programming that Whittle plans to
make available to schools across the country beginning next March.
   Whittle has ordered about 300,000 television sets, 15,000
videocassette recorders and 8,000 satellite dishes as part of its
contract with Philips.
   Whittle plans to give dozens of sets, two VCRs and a satellite
dish to each school that agrees to run the Channel One news show
with ads every day.
   Philips, which is based in Knoxville, Tenn., where Whittle also
is headquartered, said the order was the largest single order of
satellite broadcasting systems it ever has received.
   Philips, a subsidary of North American Philips Corp., produces
about 2.5 million televisions a year.
   ``We wanted this system to be designed and manufactured by the
best in the business. We've got that,'' said Christopher Whittle,
chairman of Whittle Communications.
   Philips said it plans to start building the 19-inch color
Magnavox TV sets specified in the contract at its Greeneville,
Tenn., plant in late 1989. It expects to add more than 200
manufacturing employees at the facility.
   Philips has contracted with RSI-SatCom Technologies Division of
Duluth, Ga., to manufacture the satellite dishes and install and
service the TV sets, VCRs and satellite systems in the schools.
   Whittle hopes to have 1,000 schools hooked up at the national
launch of Channel One in March 1990 and 8,000 schools by the end of
1990.
   Philips was one of three companies that Whittle previously said
were under consideration for the technology contract.
   The other contenders were Japan's Sony Corp. and Videostar
Connections, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data
Systems Corp.
   Atlanta-based Videostar had supplied, installed and serviced the
hardware for Whittle's seven-week test of the Channel One service in
six schools last spring.
   Awarding the technology contract would enable Whittle to reaffirm
its proposed spring 1990 launch of Channel One even as some
advertising executives privately speculate that Whittle is having
trouble lining up sponsors and schools.
   Whittle executives have insisted their rollout plans are on
schedule and are confident they will have a full lineup of sponsors
and the 1,000 schools signed by the spring startup.
   The media concern plans to pay for producing the Channel One news
show and the equipment for schools by selling two minutes of
advertising time on each 12-minute program.
   Several national educational groups have decried allowing
advertisers to pitch products to students while they are in class.
State education officials in New York have banned Channel One from
public schools and the top education official in California has said
he will reduce state aid to public schools there that air it during
the school day.
   Just this week, Turner Broadcasting System Inc. stepped up the
pressure on Channel One by launching its own daily commercial-free
news show designed for use in the classroom.
   Turner's project, however, does not include the donations of
video gear planned by Channel One.

   But dealers said there was little institutional buying interest,
as many players remained on the sidelines ahead of U.S. and British
economic data to be released Thursday and Friday.
   ``Buying interest was fairly average but the market rose because
there was almost no selling pressure whatsoever,'' one dealer said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed at a
session high of 2,345.8, up 19.6 points, or 0.8 percent.
   Volume came to 449.8 million shares, up from 436.7 million shares
Tuesday.
   At the London close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 6.64
points at 2,694.42.

   Wang Laboratories Inc. will not make certain
principal and interest payments on its institutional debt while
negotiations with its bank lenders continue, company Chairman An
Wang said in a statement issued Wednesday.
   Wang did not provide any further details about the step and
neither he nor company spokesmen could be reached immediately for
comment.
   Wang has been negotiating a restructuring of its debt with its
lenders.
   The computer company recently reported a $424.3 million loss for
the fiscal year that ended June 30 and has been attempting to reach
an agreement to restructure a total of $962 million in short- and
long-term debt.
   Last week, the company and the banks extended existing loans to
Wednesday after failing to reach a restructuring agreement.

<HEAD>Computer Failure Stops Most Stock Trading For Three Hours</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest computer failure in at least 12 years
delayed most trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange for three hours
Wednesday.
   Exchange officials said they suspected the problem originated in
the cables feeding the system rather than a software failure.
   ``All we know at the moment is that right at opening there was no
information on the screens to work with,'' exchange president Pearce
Bunting said in a telephone interview shortly after the failure.
   Trading resumed shortly after 12:30 p.m. EDT.
   Because of a lack of stock price information no floor trading
could take place. Trading was not interrupted on a computerized
system for smaller-company stocks, which account for about 20
percent of the exchange's volume.

<HEAD>IBM Announces Unix-Based Software For Big Mainframes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. said
Wednesday it would have Unix-based operating software available for
its most powerful computers early next year, fulfilling a pledge
made early last year.
   IBM had said in March 1988 that within two years it would have
Unix-based software for its full range of computers.
   Unix is a base layer of software developed by American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co. that theoretically enables many kinds of computers
to run the same programs with little or no modification. That is not
actually possible because Unix has become fragmented into many
versions, but efforts are under way to unify it.
   IBM's version of Unix is called AIX. IBM said its AIX for
mainframe System 370 computers is already installed in 13 customer
test sites.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mixed against other major
currencies in European trading on Wednesday. Gold prices rose $3 an
ounce in London and $2 in Zurich.
   Bullion traders in Zurich said gold was restrained from even
higher rises because of uncertainty ahead of the release Thursday of
U.S. trade data for June.
   A narrower-than-expected trade gap would likely boost the dollar
and depress gold prices by diverting investors from the bullion
market.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $368.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $365.75.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $368.50, compared with $366.25
late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.12 to close at a
bid $368.84.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5725 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5735 late Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 141.80 yen. Its late price in
London was 142.45 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe late Wednesday, compared with
late Tuesday: 1.9470 West German marks, down from 1.9500; 1.6775
Swiss francs, down from 1.6790; 6.5700 French francs, down from
6.5835; 2.1925 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1905; 1,397.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,397.50; 1.1785 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1822.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a late bid price of $5.24 a
troy ounce, unchanged from late Tuesday.

   Housing starts, driven down for four months by
high mortgage rates, rose for the second straight month in July, the
government reported Wednesday, and analysts said single-family
construction should continue at a moderate pace the rest of the year.
   ``The interest rate drops in June definitely have begun to hit
the market,'' said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the
National Association of Realtors, who predicted further interest
rate declines will keep housing activity strong in the months ahead.
   ``The consumer is coming off the sidelines'' as mortgage rates
fall, commented Thomas Holloway, senior economist for the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America.
   The Commerce Department said housing starts were up 0.8 percent
last month, following an 8.5 percent hike in June. New homes and
apartments were started in July at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.43 million, up from 1.42 million in June.
   Starts had fallen for four consecutive months through May as the
Federal Reserve drove up interest rates to slow the economy and curb
inflation. That was the longest string of declines since housing
activity slowed for five months in February-June 1987.
   But as economic growth moderated, the Fed began nudging rates
downward. Fixed-rate 30-year mortgages fell from 11.22 percent in
March to 9.96 percent last Friday, according to a survey by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Despite the overall rebound, analysts saw problems in the
multi-family component of the housing starts report.
   While the single-family sector posted a 6.3 percent increase to
1.04 million units annually in July, apartment starts were off 1.2
percent to 389,000 units.
   Part of the decline in apartment starts was attributed to a heady
32.9 percent increase in June, which chief economist David Berson of
the Federal National Mortgage Association said ``was unsustainable
in view of the high vacancy rates.''
   Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of
Home Builders, said high rents and the elimination of tax incentives
by the 1986 tax reform added to the weak multi-family pace.
   And housing economist Michael Sumichrast said the 15.4 percent
drop in apartment building-permit applications ``tells me that
starts are going to decline sharply in the fall.'' Building permits
are seen as a barometer of future multi-family housing activity.
   Single-family starts had risen 0.2 percent in June after falling
5.1 percent in May and 4.7 percent in April. Apartment starts had
increased 5.4 percent in May after falling 26.6 percent in April.
   The Northeast paced overall housing construction with a 16
percent jump last month as starts rose to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 196,000 units.
   Starts were up 11 percent to 272,000 units in the Midwest but
fell 4.3 percent to 530,000 units in the South and fell 4.2 percent
to 432,000 units in the West.
   Applications for building permits for both single-family houses
and apartments were down 3.1 percent in July, following a drop of
2.9 percent in June. They had risen 1 percent in May and 8.5 percent
in April after three consecutive monthly declines.

   A shipping company and a tanker captain
pleaded guilty today to federal charges of causing a 300,000-gallon
oil spill off Rhode Island on June 23 and agreed to pay fines
totaling $510,000.
   Ballard Shipping Co., a Liberian-registered company operating in
Piraeus, Greece, agreed to pay $500,000 to the state for
environmental research. The captain, Iakovos Georgudis, a
43-year-old Greek citizen, agreed to a $10,000 fine.
   Each pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of the federal
Clean Water Act.
   Nearly 300,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the mouth of
Narragansett Bay off Newport when the tanker World Prodigy ran
aground.
   If convicted, the captain could have received a year in jail and
a penalty equal to twice the amount of damage. The Coast Guard has
estimated the cleanup cost alone at $2 million. The shipping company
was also liable for twice the damage.
   The captain also is under indictment on state charges carrying up
to a year and a month in jail and fines of $20,000.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln Almond said he did not press for harsher
penalties because the spill resulted from simple negligence.
   ``The captain became distracted and was also doing computations
to double check'' estimates involving the unloading of the oil,
Almond said.
   ``We believe it was about a six- or seven-minute lapse and there
was nothing in advance of that that was not done properly.''
   ``He was simply trying to handle more than one person could
handle at one time,'' said Peter DiBiase, Georgudis' attorney.
   Georgudis, who had no comment after today's federal court
hearing, previously told the governor and Coast Guard officials that
he failed to turn the vessel in time to avoid the reef.
   He also admitted no harbor pilot was on board to take the tanker
into port. Officials are investigating whether the vessel had passed
the point at which one was required.
   Almond said he felt it was more appropriate to give the money to
the state, rather than to the federal government, because state
beaches and wildlife sustained the most damage.

   She got caught in a blizzard in the Sierra Nevada
mountains while searching for a rugged outdoorswoman for MJB Coffee
commercials.
   She toured the New York sewer system, sang off-key for strangers
in Portland, Ore., and prowled the docks before dawn at Newport,
R.I. _ all in pursuit of average folks for television commercials.
   Kathy S. Sorkin, 41, is founder and president of Faces and Places
Inc., a New York-based casting agency that finds ``real people'' for
advertising.
   That task often requires the resourcefulness of a detective, the
perseverance of an athlete and a talent for setting strangers at
ease. Twenty people on average are interviewed for every one that
winds up in an ad.
   ``It's a lot of work doing that,'' said Daisy Sinclair, head of
casting for the advertising agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather. ``There is a
special talent to stopping people cold and getting them to talk.''
   Ms. Sorkin said the key is in being a good listener.
   ``You have to listen for that clue to what they are hiding,'' she
said. ``A man comes in saying `I don't know what you are interested
in me for.' To get that person talking and animated is a real
challenge to me.''
   Ms. Sorkin said using such characters adds credibility to the
sales pitch because ``there is a genuine quality to real people that
actors can't give you.''
   She wouldn't discuss what she charges clients for the far-flung
talent hunts, but said the work keeps her on the road most of the
year.
   Even when she's back in New York, Ms. Sorkin said, she's never
really off the job. Take her assignment from the New York State
Lottery, for instance.
   Lottery officials, trying to refute criticism that the game preys
on poor people, wanted advertising that demonstrated it appeals to
rich people too.
   Ms. Sorkin staked out Wall Street and high-brow stores like
Bloomingdale's and came up with dozens of people who got to dream
aloud about what they would do with the money if they were to win
the lottery.
   But walking home one night, she found a uniformed doorman who
wound up in one ad saying that since his father liked to fish, he'd
buy him a lake.
   Asked to find an authority on the perennial ``alligators in the
sewers'' rumors for an ad about a New York radio station, Ms. Sorkin
interviewed sewer workers and said they insisted on showing her
their slimy abode. No alligators showed up.
   But most of her work takes her outside New York.
   She went to Portland, Ore., for instance, in search of people who
would sing a jingle for Kit Kat candy bars. She crooned for some
candidates to set them at ease and see if they could hold a tune.
   Her search for the MJB Coffee woman took her through a blizzard
in the mountain passes in northern California before she found the
right one near Grass Valley, Calif.
   For a Swanson's Fried Chicken dinner commercial, Ms. Sorkin and
her assistants fanned out from San Francisco to Sacramento,
searching the parks, supermarkets, financial districts, restaurants
and movie waiting lines.
   She spent days on the docks before dawn in Newport, R.I., seeking
fishermen heading to sea who used Alka Seltzer Plus for tough colds.
   The Swanson and Alka Seltzer ads featured people saying why they
use a specific brand. The so-called testimonial approach requires
special precautions.
   To protect the credibility of the people chosen for such ads, Ms.
Sorkin makes sure candidates never suspect they are under
consideration for starring in a commercial.
   She and her assistants, describing themselves as market
researchers, often stop people by asking if they would like to
participate in a consumer survey.
   The questions are designed to determine if interviewees use a
specific brand that will be advertised, without letting them know
what the product is or that the admakers are seeking people for a
commercial.
   Those who qualify are invited to another question-and-answer
session, which is videotaped. The tape serves as the legal record
that they volunteered they use a specific brand.
   Television networks, which try to guard against deceptive
advertising, often demand proof that interviewees weren't coached.
   As an added safeguard against deception, Ms. Sorkin said many
people aren't told until after the ad has been shot that they were
filmed for a commercial and will be paid for it. Those who don't
want to participate are dropped.
   Pay varies depending on the role. Ms. Sorkin said people in a
principal role usually get a one-time fee and extra payments based
on how often and how widely the ad runs.
   Faces and Places goes to extraordinary lengths to find credible
people, but it isn't the only agency specializing in seeking
non-professionals for commercial roles.
   Laura Slutsky, for instance, has run the New York-based
PeopleFinders agency for 15 years. Among her recent finds have been
several families for Surf detergent commercials and autoworkers who
describe the pride they feel in their jobs in a Ford Motor Co. ad
campaign.
   She also worked on Alka Seltzer Plus commercials, persuading 30
Montana ranchers to travel up to 100 miles in the dead of winter to
discuss their colds with her on videotape at a Helena hotel. Eight
of them made the commercial.
   But sometimes hard work doesn't pay off.
   Ms. Sorkin said she interviewed 300 people a day for a week in
Bristol, Tenn., for a Slice soft drink commercial, but couldn't find
people who pronounced the drink's name without a Southern lilt. She
said the admaker eventually flew in outsiders to appear in the ads.
   ``It's an exhausting process,'' said Michael Leonard, senior vice
president at Hal Riney &amp; Partners, a San Francisco-based ad agency
that worked with Ms. Sorkin on the MJB Coffee and Swanson's dinner
ads.
   Ms. Sorkin said she figures her work is helping people partly
fulfill artist Andy Warhol's prophecy that everyone will be famous
for 15 minutes. She helps them get there for about 30 seconds.

<HEAD>Customers Lose In Profit Struggle Between Dealers And Wholesalers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The sultry summer is especially sweaty this year for Texaco
station operator Sam Rodar, and it's not from the heat. Because his
supplier is his chief competitor, Rodar says he walks a pricing
tightrope.
   Wholesale gasoline prices have been falling, but Rodar says he
can't pass along the savings to customers because his supplier could
get mad and drive him out of business.
   His predicament illustrates what gasoline market experts call a
nationwide problem that is hurting retail gasoline sellers and
motorists alike. While wholesale prices have dropped as much as 28
cents since mid-May because of an oversupply and sluggish demand,
retail prices have fallen only about 6 cents.
   ``It's a wholesaler's market right now,'' says Tom Kloza, editor
of Oil Price Information Service, an industry newsletter.
``Distributors are wallowing like pigs in slop.''
   Service station dealers blame oil companies and suppliers for
keeping gasoline prices high when they should be lower. Suppliers
claim tighter government regulations and higher insurance rates have
raised costs. Oil companies are reluctant to talk about prices but
say they're set by the market.
   Nonetheless, the market laws of supply and demand don't
necessarily hold in what dealers call the dog-eat-dog world of
peddling gasoline.
   ``The problem here is that some of the dogs are much bigger than
others and some can't bite back,'' says Rodar, who operates a
station outside Sante Fe, N.M.
   In rural areas like that, the distributor _ or middleman between
the refiner and dealer _ often controls prices. In big cities,
dealers often buy directly from the refiner.
   In both situations, dealers claim they don't get the benefit of
cheaper prices because they have little influence over the supply,
controlled by oil companies, their refiners and distribution
networks.
   ``In some cases, they do have a lock on the market,'' concedes
David Morehead, spokesman for the Petroleum Marketers Association,
which represents 10,000 wholesalers and retailers nationwide.
   But Morehead says this year's erratic price shifts are unusual
and don't reflect the broader forces shaping the price of gasoline.
   ``A lot of what they have in inventory they bought at higher
prices and they want to go through that inventory first before they
pass on the prices,'' he says. ``Ultimately competition will
return.''
   Gasoline prices soared after the March 24 Exxon Valdez oil spill
in Alaska due partly to concerns that there wouldn't be enough fuel
to meet the predicted strong summer demand. Refiners rushed to
produce more gasoline and by May wholesale prices were falling
rapidly, but motorists didn't see much change.
   Glenn Nilsson, director of the Lone Star Service Station
Association in Houston, says his dealers face a problem similar to
Rodar's, but in their case the bad guys are the big oil refineries.
   ``The majors have created an artificial profit by keeping prices
high to the dealer,'' Nilsson says. ``They got prices up there and
they left them up there.''
   Most major oil companies decline to comment on pricing practices.
Exxon Corp. spokesman Les Rogers said, ``We monitor our markets
daily closely and we set our prices to be competitive. So it's
purely and simply a response to market conditions.''
   Rodar says his biggest complaint is that his supplier can control
prices and make big profits at the same time.
   The supplier, for example, buys unleaded gasoline for 93.5 cents
a gallon from the refiner, sells it to Rodar for $1.05 and charges
$1.21 at his own pump, the same as Rodar. That means the supplier
makes 27.5 cents a gallon in profit vs. 16 cents for Rodar.
   ``I hate to lead the market in any direction because he has the
ability to price discipline me,'' says Rodar. ``He could sell it for
what I pay for it and literally drive me out of the market.''
   Rodar's supplier, Chester Berridge, president of Berridge
Distributing Co. Inc. of Santa Fe, says he is ``not in business as a
charitable organization.''
   Berridge defends his prices by saying the costs of business have
rocketed because of new pollution regulations requiring station
owners to upgrade equipment and increase insurance coverage.
   Berridge, who supplies 17 New Mexico dealers including himself,
says his insurance premiums have soared to $204,000 a year from
$12,000 and his cost of installing new equipment is about $135,000
per station.
   ``If you think we can stay in this business and make a profit
then you don't know this business,'' Berridge says.
   Prices elsewhere show the evident disadvantage dealers face in
competing with oil company refiners and suppliers that also sell
directly to the public.
   In Houston, for example, the gap between what refiners charge
suppliers and what they charge dealers was 16.35 cents as of early
this month, the biggest gap this year, Nilsson says. The normal gap
is 1{ to 4 cents.
   In San Francisco, the average cost to wholesalers was 59.6 cents
a gallon vs. 77.6 cents to dealers in late July, and in Atlanta it
was 56 cents to wholesalers vs. 69.5 cents to dealers, Oil Price
Information Service figures show.
   Rodar claims he can't go elsewhere to get gasoline because other
Texaco distributors won't sell to him.
   ``We have people who want to go to these (suppliers) and buy for
less but the refiner in most cases has put pressure on the
wholesaler to not sell to so-called captive customers,'' says
Nilsson.
   A few states, including Maryland and Connecticut, have attempted
to deal with the problem by banning oil companies from selling
gasoline at the retail level, says Wayne Konitshek, a Denver-based
dealer lobbyist.
   Konitshek says he believes pricing practices by refiners and
distributors have helped drive dealers out of business. The number
of dealers has fallen from 330,000 in 1972 to 108,000 today, he says.
   Houston dealers several years ago sued major oil companies under
antitrust laws, Nilsson says.
   ``Prices dropped dramatically practically overnight'' and the
dealers dropped the suit, he says.
   A lawsuit filed in state district court in Houston last April
against Exxon by 19 Exxon dealers accuses the oil company of 15
violations of Texas anti-trust and deceptive trade practice laws.
The counts include profiteering from dealers, saddling consumers
with high fuel costs and interfering with their ability to buy
cheaper gasoline elsewhere.
   The suit, which seeks more than $5 million in damages, is pending.
   Five similar suits are pending in other states, Konitshek says.

cordoba's new value will be 20,600 per dollar after the 3 percent
devaluation, down from 20,000.
   In announcing the move, Vice President Sergio Ramirez said it was
to ``avoid distortions in prices and stimulate exports.''
   The unofficial parallel rate is 25,500 cordobas per dollar in the
exchange houses.
   After consumer price increases of 36,000 percent last year, the
government began in January a rigorous anti-inflation plan that
includes regular devaluations and a severe cut in public spending.
   Ramirez said the government's goal was to bring inflation down to
the 900-1,000 percent range this year. Monthly inflation last month
was registered at 8.5 percent, the government reported.

   The stock market was drifting in moderate
afternoon trading today after getting off to a strong start.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.32 points to
2,693.10. at 3 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was 8.16 points
higher an hour earlier after bouncing off 2,700 early in the day.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 11 to 8 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 826 issues up, 603 down and 519 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 125.45 million shares.
   Analysts said the market was drifting as buyers remained cautious
ahead of more economic data due out later this week on merchandise
trade and consumer prices.
   Technology stocks, including IBM, lagged during most of the
session but cyclical stocks, including autos, was giving the market
some spark, said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI
Securities Corp.
   ``The market is still looking for a base of support following the
decline that began last week,'' Jensen said.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 29 points on Friday
after bonds skidded on new government data that showed the economy
was not as weak as thought. The report diminished hopes that the
Federal Reserve would lower interest rates.
   Government reports this morning on July U.S. industrial
production and capacity utilization and housing starts appeared to
be in line with expectations and had little impact on the market,
analysts said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.45 at 192.53.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had gained
0.03 to 379.85.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, General Motors was up ]

<HEAD>Pillsbury to Sell Bumble Bee to Thai Company Affiliate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. moved to drop another subsidiary
as it announced plans Wednesday to sell Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. to
an affiliate of Unicord Co. Ltd. of Thailand for $269 million in
cash.
   The deal is unusual in that the buyer is from Thailand, a poor
Southeast Asian nation that is trying to catch up with the surging
Four Tigers of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong.
   ``The acquisition of Bumble Bee marks the first time that a Thai
company has purchased an American concern of this magnitude,'' said
Dumri Konuntakiet, Unicord's chief executive officer and controlling
shareholder.
   ``We are particularly pleased to be acquiring a company as
well-managed as Bumble Bee, with a strong brand name in the
important U.S. market,'' he said. ``We plan to continue to expand
our company's food-related activities on a global scale.''
   Pillsbury bought Bumble Bee, then privately held, for $242
million in July 1988. But officials said Wednesday that holding on
to Bumble Bee doesn't fit with the long-term strategies of
Pillsbury, which has been streamlining since its $5.7 billion
acquisition by Grand Metropolitan PLC of Great Britain in January.
   Just last week, Pillsbury announced that it will sell its Van de
Kamp's frozen seafoods division to Chicago-based Whitman Corp. for
about $140 million in cash.
   ``Bumble Bee, like Van de Kamp's, is an exceptionally strong
company. However, it does not fit with Pillsbury's long-range
strategy for its core businesses,'' Ian A. Martin, chairman and
chief executive officer of Pillsbury, said in a statement.
   The sale of Bumble Bee and its Santa Fe Springs, Calif.,
manufacturing facility to the newly formed Uni Group Inc., a
U.S.-based affiliate of Unicord, is expected to be completed in
September, the companies said.
   Unicord is a leading Thai seafood processing and exporting
company.
   The San Diego, Calif.-based Bumble Bee markets products including
white meat and light meat tuna, salmon, oysters, and Figaro pet
food. It had annual sales of about $284 million last year.
   Pillsbury had fiscal 1988 sales of $6.2 billion. Its leading
brands include Green Giant Vegetables, Haagen Dazs ice cream and
Totino's pizza, and it owns Burger King.
   Since the Grand Met acquisition, Pillsbury has also sold or made
plans to sell units including five food processing facilities in
Latin America; the Azteca Mexican Foods business and the S&amp;A
Restaurant Corp., as well as Bumble Bee and Van de Kamps.
   In addition, Grand Met has shut down a pizza plant in Joplin,
Mo., a sweet potato plant in Turkey, N.C., and a potato side dish
plant in Grand Forks, N.D. More than 500 employees at Pillsbury's
Minneapolis headquarters and an equal number of non-restaurant
workers in the company's Burger King system have been laid off since
January.

   An airplane parts distributor and its president
pleaded guilty today to selling thousands of used nuts and bolts as
new to several airlines and aerospace contractors.
   Rice Aircraft Inc. of Hauppauge, N.Y. and its president, Bruce J.
Rice, 42, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and mail fraud.
   The fasteners hold together everything from wings to engines and
were distributed widely in the aerospace industry from 1977 through
1988, mostly in the early 1980s, authorities said.
   U.S. Attorney Gene Wilson said federal investigators have not
directly linked the parts to any aircraft crashes.
   Wilson said Rice Aircraft had the parts secretly stripped and
replated or relubricated, and then sold them as new.
   Rice could receive up to five years in prison, fines of $500,000
and court costs of $250,000 at sentencing Feb. 16. The company faces
fines up to $50,000 and will share with Rice in possible restitution
up to $1 million.
   The guilty pleas came as the government charged three more
defendants with paying kickbacks and conspiring to underbid on
airplane parts contracts.
   Court documents indicate the recycled parts were sold to the U.S.
government, the Israeli government, Airbus, British Aerospace,
Grumman, Sikorsky, Martin Marietta, Boeing Helicopters, Air France,
United Airlines, the Brazilian airline Varig, TWA, American Airlines
and Pan Am.
   Some parts were purchased for military aircraft, including the
F-111, the B-1B bomber and F-14 fighters, Wilson said.
   The U.S. Attorney's also office filed charges against Richard K.
Ohlman, 70, of Mission Viejo, Calif., accusing him of acting as a
middleman who conspired with Rice and Rice Aircraft to pay kickbacks
in 1982 to Boeing Surplus personnel.
   The kickbacks were paid to help Rice Aircraft sell the recycled
parts to Boeing Surplus, a unit of the Boeing Co., authorities said.
In exchange for the kickbacks, Wilson said, Ohlman was given the
``last look'' at competitors' secret bids.
   Unrelated charges also were filed against former Boeing Surplus
employees John J. Rockwood, 49, of Bellevue, Wash., and Richard K.
Watson, 66, of Los Angeles.
   They were accused of conspiring with Southeast Connectors Inc. of
Miami, Fla., to provide Southeast with the ``last look'' at
competitors' bids submitted to Boeing Surplus.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Manager Charged With Stealing $3.47 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former San Francisco savings and loan
branch manager has been charged with embezzling $3.47 million from
customers' deposits over more than four years, authorities said
Wednesday.
   Richard A. Mariucci, 30, was arrested by the FBI Tuesday at his
home in the Riverside County community of Rancho, said U.S. Attorney
Joseph Russoniello. He released a 29-count indictment against
Mariucci that was returned Friday by a federal grand jury.
   Mariucci managed a San Francisco branch of Gibraltar Savings and
Loan from 1985 to April 1989, when he was fired for reasons
unrelated to the embezzlement investigation, the FBI said.
   He could be sentenced to 145 years in prison and fined $7.25
million if convicted of all charges, Russoniello said.
   The problem came to light two days after Mariucci was fired, when
a customer asked about the $100,000 certificate of deposit she had
taken out with Gibraltar the previous September and was told there
was no record of her account, said FBI Agent Kathryn Reeve in a
sworn statement.
   She said an investigation showed that Mariucci took certificate
of deposit checks that were placed with him and put much of the
money in a personal account, while setting aside the rest to repay
earlier depositors and avoid discovery.
   Reeve's statement listed eight customers who were verified as
having deposited money that was not in their accounts and another
six who had been identified by Gibraltar, and said the list may
grow. The indictment states 29 instances of embezzlement, of amounts
ranging up to $400,000, between February 1985 and April 1989.
   Agents seized over $639,000 from accounts controlled by Mariucci
at seven institutions on May 9, Reeve said.
   Court documents did not mention the recovery of any of the other
allegedly embezzled funds. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Zanides said
Mariucci may have put some of the money into real estate.

   The stock market rose in lackluster trading today
but closed below session peaks.
   The market opened strong, bounced off the 2,700 mark then drifted
sideways during most of the session.
   A brief spark in the bond market late in the day pushed stocks
higher in the final hour of trading before settling back again.
   Analysts said investors were remaining cautious after the
market's recent rally.
   ``It's summer caution,'' said Carter Randall, an equities analyst
with the Randall Co. ``As the market goes up there's selling
pressure and it keeps the market weak.''
   Technology stocks, including IBM, lagged during most of the
session but cyclical stocks such as autos kept that sector firm,
said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.
   ``The market is still looking for a base of support following the
decline that began last week,'' Jensen said.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 29 points on Friday

<DATELINE>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has approved a $12.1 million
settlement for job applicants at The Federated retail electronics
stores who were required to take lie-detector tests.
   The settlement was reached just before a trial was to begin on a
suit by four employees who said the tests violated the right to
privacy and a state law forbidding mandatory polygraph testing by
private employers. A recent federal law also bans the practice.
   It is the nation's largest settlement in a lie-detector case,
said Brad Seligman, a lawyer for the employees.
   Under the agreement approved Tuesday by Alameda County Superior
Court Judge Demetrios Agretelis, the four plaintiffs will get
$22,500 each, and about $11 million will be put into a fund for job
applicants at Federated stores in California from 1983 to November
1987, when the suit was filed.
   Federated must also pay for a campaign to reach the 8,000 or more
job applicants and employees at its stores who are potentially
eligible for payments.
   Federated, based in the City of Commerce near Los Angeles, has
been bought by Atari Corp.

   A man who posed as a financial consultant and
immigration lawyer avoided prison Wednesday by agreeing to a plea
deal to repay more than $80,000 he admitted stealing from clients.
   Ira Ratner, 44, of Easton, Conn., pleaded guilty to 19 counts of
an indictment that charged him with grand larceny, forgery, scheme
to defraud and criminal possession of stolen property.
   Assistant District Attorney Edward Hamlin said Ratner bilked at
least 13 people between December 1985 and July 1988 by promising
services such as getting mortgages and loans, buying and leasing
office space, and investing.
   Hamlin said Ratner also posed as an immigration lawyer and told
illegal aliens he could help them get ``green cards'' _ permanent
residency cards. He admitted in court that he is not a lawyer.
   When he was arrested in January, Manhattan District Atorney
Robert Morgenthau said a two-year investigation ``showed that Mr.
Ratner never performed a legitimate business transaction for any of
these clients, and the only investment made was in his own personal
bank account.''
   In one case, Hamlin said, Ratner took $140,000 in checks and
negotiable bonds from a woman who requested his help after her
husband had a stroke.
   According to the plea deal, if Ratner repays the $80,950.75 that
he kept, he will not go jail. There was no mention of probation or
community service. Ratner could have gotten up to 15 years in prison
on the top count, second-degree grand larceny.

<HEAD>HBJ Cuts List of Possible Buyers; Anheuser-Busch a Front-Runner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The list of potential buyers for six theme
parks owned by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. has been narrowed to
six, and analysts expect a selection may come within a month,
according to a published report Wednesday.
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the St. Louis-based beer-maker and
owner of Busch Gardens theme parks, including one in Tampa, is the
front-runner and most likely buyer, a source close to the
negotiations told The Orlando Sentinel. Others on the list
reportedly include Walt Disney Co., based in Burbank, Calif.
   Potential buyers are being escorted this week and next through
the theme parks and have received a detailed package of financial
information, the Sentinel reported.
   ``I think they are getting much closer to making a transaction on
the parks,'' said Joe Frazzano, an analyst who follows HBJ for
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., a New York brokerage, told the newspaper. ``I
think they will certainly have an announcement within a month or
so.''
   A call for comment on the report was placed to HBJ but it was not
returned.
   But Robert Evanson, HBJ's executive vice president for parks, has
previously said the sale would be announced by Sept. 30, the end of
HBJ's third fiscal quarter.
   Spokesmen for Anheueser-Busch and Disney each said they do not
comment on speculation about acquisitions.
   Orlando-based HBJ announced in June the parks would be sold to
pay down some of the debt incurred two years ago defending itself
against a hostile takeover attempt by British publisher Robert
Maxwell. Industry analysts estimate the parks will garner at least
$1.3 billion.
   The Sea World parks being sold are in Orlando; San Diego; San
Antonio, Texas, and Aurora, Ohio. Also on the block are venerable
Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven and Boardwalk and Baseball near
Haines City.
   Nearly 25 prospective buyers were sent an initial packet of
financial information and projections about six weeks ago. Another
packet was distributed in the past two weeks to prospective buyers
with adequate financial backing and that HBJ considers ``serious.''
   Three former Sea World executives _ George Millay, Jan Schultz
and Robert Hillebrecht _ last month said they would make a bid for
the parks.
   Florida Leisure Acquisition Corp., which owns the Silver Springs
and Weeki Wachee attractions in Florida, said last week it's also
interested. The former Sea World group and Florida Leisure would not
say how much they had bid.

<HEAD>Farm Credit Second-Quarter Earnings Drop 6.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System on Wednesday reported its
second-quarter net income was down 6.5 percent from the same period
last year and warned that .
   The system, the nation's biggest lender to agriculture, said it
earned $159 million for the quarter ended June 30 compared with $170
million in the 1988 period.
   For the first six months of the year, the system showed profits
of $317 million, down 5.7 percent from $336 million in the first
half of 1988.
   Although overall net income declined during the quarter, net
interest income rose by $42 million to $256 million. The improvement
stemmed from continued improvement in the system's loan credit
quality and its interest margin, the difference between its
borrowing costs and interest on loans it makes, said Alan D. Fass,
president and chief executive officer of the Federal Farm Credit
Banks Funding Corp., the credit system's financing arm.
   ``The system's second-quarter results indicate a continued
strengthening of the system's overall financial condition,'' said
Fass.
   For the first half, net interest income was $496 million, up from
$360 million in 1988.
   Fass also said the system was aided by repurchases by some system
banks of portions of their higher-cost debt and retirement of some
other higher-cost debt that matured in the last year.
   But the system said in a statement that ``certain system banks
remain in a weakened financial condition'' and that drought
conditions persist in scattered regions. It said it believes
adequate allowances for loan losses are being maintained to cover
credit risks from possible drought-related losses.
   Fass said Department of Agriculture projections for the system's
net cash income for 1989 remain just slightly under last year's
levels.
   ``This should mean stronger financial positions for system
borrowers, resulting in continued improvement in the credit quality
of the system's loan portfolio,'' he said.
   Nonaccrual loans declined to $2.87 billion as of June 30 from
$3.3 billion on Dec. 31, 1988. Loans considered ``high-risk,''
excluding non-accruing loans, rose to $4.58 billion as of June 30
from $4.56 billion six months earlier, mainly due to a $194 million
increase in the amount of restructured loans.
   The allowance for loan losses was $1.72 billion as of June 30, up
from $1.86 billion at year-end 1988. During the second quarter, the
system took an $80 million negative provision for loan losses,
compared with $181 million in the 1988 quarter.
   The Farm Credit System is a nationwide system of federally
chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural
economy and cooperatively owned by their borrowers.
   The system took several steps last year to streamline its
structure following 1987 bailout legislation that included the
issuance of up to $4 billion in government-backed, low-interest
loans.

<HEAD>Eds: Precedes LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar drifted mostly lower Wednesday against
major foreign currencies after a mixed performance overseas.
   Gold prices also fell in domestic trading but made strong gains
in Europe and Asia.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed off $2.50 at $368.20 a troy ounce. Republic National
Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $366.50 an ounce,
down from $368.50 Monday.
   Currency traders said the dollar started out strong but slipped
on rumors of dollar-selling by the Federal Reserve and on internal
market influences.
   ``A lot of people were squaring their positions ahead of
Thursday's trade report,'' said Gary Lutnick, a trader for Banco di
Sicilia in New York.
   The Commerce Department is scheduled to release figures on the
merchandise trade deficit for June, and some traders are predicting
a shortfall of around $9.5 billion. They said the dollar is likely
to rally if the gap falls below $9 billion but decline should it
exceed $10 billion.
   A low trade deficit is seen as positive for the dollar because it
means the currency probably won't have to decline any further to
help improve the U.S. trade picture. A weak dollar makes U.S.
exports more attractive.
   Meanwhile, Lutnick said the currency market largely ignored the
economic figures released Wednesday, showing industrial production
rising for the first time in three months during July and housing
starts continuing to rebound that month.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.40 yen to a closing 141.80 yen. It traded at
142.45 yen late in London, and at 142.185 yen in New York, up from
142.15 yen Tuesday.
   The dollar rose against the British pound in Europe and fell in
New York. It cost $1.5725 to buy one pound in London, cheaper than
$1.5735 late Tuesday. Sterling fetched $1.5805 in New York, up from
$1.5768.
   Other dollar rates at Wednesday's close compared with late
Tuesday, included: 1.9420 West German marks, up from 1.9437; 1.67155
Swiss francs, down from 1.6748; 1.17775 Canadian dollars, down from
1.18025; 6.5615 French francs, down from 6.5780; and 1,395.00
Italian lire, down from 1,395.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday: 1.9470 West
German marks, down from 1.9500; 1.6775 Swiss francs, down from
1.6790; 6.5700 French francs, down from 6.5835; 2.1925 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1905; 1.1785 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1822;
and 1,397.75 Italian lire, up from 1,397.50.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $368.75 an ounce from
Tuesday's $365.75. In Zurich, gold closed at $368.50 an ounce, up
from $366.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.12 to close at $368.84 an
ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.186 a troy ounce from $5.242 late
Tuesday. Silver settled in London at $5.24 an ounce, unchanged.

<HEAD>Reports: Disney Negotiating Purchase of `Muppets' Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. and Henson Associates
Inc. declined comment Wednesday on reports that Disney is
negotiating to buy the group of companies controlled by Jim Henson,
who created ``The Muppet Show.''
   The proposed deal for Henson Associates Inc. calls for Henson to
operate a production company in Los Angeles under the Disney
umbrella, The Hollywood Reporter said.
   The entertainment trade daily quoted an unidentified source
Monday as saying the value of the deal could exceed $100 million.
The Wall Street Journal carried a similar story Wednesday but said
it had been unable to determine a price.
   Disney spokesman Erwin Okun and Henson spokeswoman Susan Berry
declined to comment, but analysts said the Henson characters Miss
Piggy, Kermit the Frog and the other Muppets, stars of several
movies as well as TV, would fit in perfectly with Disney's Mickey
Mouse and his cohorts.
   The Muppets are probably second only to Disney's characters in
worldwide recognition, said Jeff Logsdon of the Crowell Weedon &amp; Co.
brokerage in Los Angeles.
   ``Obviously it's a franchise that extends Disney's already deep
penetration into the children's market, if it turns out to be
true,'' Logsdon said.
   ``It makes a lot of sense in terms of both companies,'' said
Harold Vogel, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York.
   ``Disney could use the extra characters and could merchandise
them more effectively than anyone else, and Henson has a lot of
overhead,'' Vogel said. ``Disney's distribution network would be
especially helpful for them.''
   Henson Associates, based in New York, includes Henson
International Television, which controls rights to ``The Muppet
Show,'' a videocassette label, and merchandising, licensing and
publishing divisions.
   Besides ``The Muppet Show,'' the company has produced and
distributed such programs as ``Fraggle Rock,'' ``The Storyteller''
and ``Muppet Babies,'' all successful internationally.
   Henson has distributed such shows as ``The Adventures of Teddy
Ruxpin'' on behalf of others, and last year, ``The Jim Henson Hour''
was broadcast briefly on NBC-TV, but was pulled before the end of
its run.
   The Muppets would join quite a menagerie of characters Disney has
introduced over the past two years: Roger Rabbit and the fall
release ``The Little Mermaid'' in animated movies; the top-rated
``Duck Tales'' and coming out this fall, ``Chip &amp; Dale Rescue
Rangers'' on afternoon TV.
   There's all kinds of combinations you could extend,'' Logsdon
mused. ``The Little Mermaid dates Kermit the Frog. ... They get
saved by Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers ...''

<HEAD>Lower Petroleum Stock Send Prices Higher</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices advanced modestly on the New York
Mercantile Exchange following the release of American Petroleum
Institute figures showing a drop in petroleum stocks.
   On other markets, soybean futures dropped sharply and grain
futures were mixed, precious metals prices retreated, copper
continued its advances, and livestock and pork futures were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 17 cents to 39 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in September at $18.97 a
barrel; heating oil was .44 cent to .95 cent higher with September
at 51.15 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .84 cent to 90 cent
higher with September at 52.93 cents a gallon.
   The API weekly data indicated that gasoline stocks declined 3.5
million barrels in the latest week, while crude oil stocks were down
2.75 million barrels.
   Traders looked upon the data as slightly bullish, prompting the
run-up in prices.
   ``The figures indicate lower-than-anticipated stocks,'' said Jim
Ritterbusch, an analyst with Carson Petroleum Co., a Chicago area
oil distributor. ``The street was looking for only a 1 million
barrel drop in supplies.''
   The strength in demand for oil products in the United States and
market strength in Europe also helped boost energy futures, analysts
said.
   Soybean futures were off sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade
because of an uncertain weather outlook, analysts said.
   Earlier this week, forecasts called for a relatively dry weekend,
but updated forecasts now call for moderate rain over wide areas of
the Midwest, which triggered commercial selling, said Frank Kouba,
an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn futures ended the day higher despite forecasts of weekend
precipitation. Giving support to the market were reports that Mexico
will bid this week for 400,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and South
Korea will bid for 150,000 metric tons.
   Wheat futures, which closed mixed, were pressured by reports that
Algeria's bid for 250,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat under the export
bonus program was rejected. Algeria rebid for 100,000 metric tons of
wheat.
   Wheat was \ cent lower to 4} cents higher with September at
$3.99\ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1{ cent higher with
September at $2.35 a bushel; oats were } cent to 2 cents lower with
September at $1.38 a bushel; soybeans were 13\ cents lower to 1 cent
higher with August at $6.23{ a bushel.
   Copper prices edged up on New York's Commodity Exchange despite
reports the miner's strike in Peru appears to be losing steam.
   The continuing strike at Canada's Highland Valley Copper mine and
the shutdown of mines in Papua New Guinea helped to support the
market.
   Copper was .35 cent to 1.10 cent higher with August at $1.222 a
pound.
   Precious metals prices fell on the Comex, losing all the gains
made in Tuesday's trading.
   ``This was another in a series of failed rallies,'' said William
O'Neill, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York. ``There
was little impact on the market by outside fundamentals. The
market's movement was mostly technically oriented.''
   O'Neill said the weakness in precious metal prices continues to
be based on the strong dollar and weak. A weak dollar and strong
inflation draws investors to gold and silver.
   O'Neill also noted that stocks of gold and silver remain high.
   Gold settled $2.50 to $3.20 lower with August at $368.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to 6.1 cent lower with August at $5.186
a troy ounce.
   Livestock futures were lower and pork futures higher in trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork futures were supported by indications that prices in the
cash market will firm, said Paul Georgy, an analyst with Allendale
Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill. Technical factors also supported the
market, as the rise in prices triggered additional buying by
commission houses.
   Livestock futures were pushed lower by Department of Agriculture
reports of lower prices in the cash market.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .55 cent lower with August at 74.07
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .23 cent higher
with August at 84.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .52
cent higher with August at 47.15 a pound; frozen pork bellies were
1.92 cents to 2 cents higher with August at 26.82 cents a pound.

   Stocks faltered Wednesday after a strong opening
rally fizzled, but the market still finished with a small gain.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.51 points to close
at 2,693.29 after bouncing over the 2,700 mark shortly after the
opening bell.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
819 issues up, 662 down and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 150.06 million
shares, up from 148.77 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 179.47 million shares.
   The market opened strong in what some Wall Street analysts
predicted would be the launching pad for a new rally. But the market
failed to sustain the momentum and began to drift.
   ``I'm perplexed about the action; the action is odd,'' said John
Burnett, senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
``You know in the movies how they say `it's too quiet?' I expected
more activity.''
   New government reports on July U.S. industrial production and
capacity utilization and housing starts were in line with
expectations and had little impact on the market, analysts said.
   Nevertheless, the reports helped ease some market concerns that
the economy is starting to heat up again, said Hugh Johnson, senior
vice president for First Albany Corp.
   The Commerce Department reported that new housing starts rose 0.8
percent last month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.43 million
units from 1.42 million units in June.
   Industrial production rose a moderate 0.2 percent in July, but
the operating rate for the nation's factories remained flat, the
Federal Reserve Board said, suggesting a further easing of inflation.
   Technology stocks slumped after Intel Corp. announced that it
expected a decline in third-quarter earnings due to a `change in the
company's product mix.' Intel dropped 1] to 28~ on the
over-the-counter market.
   But analysts predicted the market could improve later this week
with the release of the June merchandise trade and July consumer
price reports on Thursday and Friday.
   ``Technically, the stock market is in a positive mode. The upturn
is still intact,'' said A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus
Research.
   The market is expecting a narrowing in the trade deficit to about
$9.4 billion from $10.24 billion in June and a moderate gain of 0.2
percent in consumer prices, Moore said.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market advanced $9.036 billion, or 0.27
percent, in value from Tuesday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.56 to 192.64.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, General Motors rose \
to 45}, Ford Motor gained ~ to 51~ and Tandem advanced 1[ to 23\.
   IBM closed at 115\, down 1, Johnson and Johnson lost { to 51 and
Exxon fell } to 44].
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.02 to 395.73, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index gained 0.67 to 321.81.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.12 to 460.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 379.60, down 0.22.

<HEAD>Wang Says It Will Suspend Some Debt Payments While Negotiations Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. said Wednesday it
will suspend payments on $208.6 million in institutional debts, an
apparent step to give it a stronger hand in negotiations with its
bank lenders.
   The cash-short computer giant has been trying to negotiate a new
line of credit with a group of eight banks, led by Bank of Boston,
to replace a $300 million credit line that expires Sept. 30.
   By suspending payments on the $208.6 million in commercial paper
and bank notes, it is putting more pressure on the eight bank
lenders, since those banks also hold some of the securities in
question.
   ``I think it's fairly straightforward that they're calling the
bluff of their banks, playing hardball,'' said John W. Adams,
chairman of Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston.
   Wang reported a $424.3 million loss for the fiscal year that
ended June 30, and had speeded up plans to lay off more than 2,200
workers by Sept. 30.
   An Wang, the founder, chief executive and chairman, has recently
undergone treatment for cancer. Last week, in an unexpected move,
his son and heir apparent, Frederick Wang, stepped down as president
and chief operating officer.
   Wang has $962 million in short- and long-term debt altogether and
is trying to restructure all of it.
   Wang stock fell 50 cents a share to $6 a share on the American
Stock Exchange.
   Company Chairman An Wang said in a terse statement that the
company would suspend principal and interest payments on certain
institutional debts.
   Paul Henning, director of investor relations, said later the
freeze would apply to $125 million of commercial paper, as well as
$83.6 million in notes payable to banks.
   Henning said the negotiations had been ``long and difficult and
arduous and complex.''
   ``When you're dealing with a consortium of eight banks ...
getting nine parties to come to an agreement gets complex,'' he said.
   Henning stressed that the move applied only to institutional
debts, and said the company intended to remain current on all other
obligations, including trade credits, operating costs, vendor bills,
customer service, and overseas operations, while negotiations
continue.
   Adams said despite those woes Wang's balance sheet at year-end
was ``a fairly strong one.''
   ``That, particularly as modern balance sheets go, is a pretty
bankable situation,'' he said. ``It doesn't reflect tremendously
well on the banking group if, with that balance sheet, they can't
put together a lending agreement and a loan.''
   Adams added, ``They sure have cast down the gauntlet.''
   Another analyst said Wang's action was unusual but not
unprecedented.
   ``They're saying well, we don't like the new terms and we don't
have the funds to pay you under the old terms,'' said Fred Pastore,
vice president with Moody's Investors Service in New York. But he
added, ``Certainly if a company can't pay its bills and meet the
terms of its original obligation to the banks, that doesn't look
good.''

   Oil futures prices rose Wednesday in light
trading, boosted by new industry statistics showing a sharp
reduction in U.S. gasoline supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded regular gasoline
for September delivery jumped 0.87 cent to 52.93 cents a gallon.
Most contracts for later delivery showed similar increases.
   The September-delivery contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, closed 29 cents higher at $18.97
per 42-gallon barrel. Contract months for later delivery posted
smaller advances.
   Heating oil futures, which led the market higher last week, also
posted gains. The September contract rose 0.87 cent to finish at
51.15 cents a gallon.
   Market participants said prices were lifted by the American
Petroleum Institute's latest weekly report, released Tuesday after
the close of trading. The report showed a drop in U.S. gasoline
stocks of around 3.5 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 11, to
222.93 million barrels. A reduction in supplies of gasoline has the
effect of raising prices.
   ``Gasoline was perceived as being bullish,'' said Chris
McCormack, a futures trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
``Gasoline led the market higher.''

<HEAD>Report: Jets Have Experienced 16 Serious Engine Failures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some airline safety experts say they're surprised
at figures showing that wide-body jets have experienced at least 288
instances of engine trouble in the past six years, including 16
serious incidents that could have led to a crash.
   The figures were obtained from Federal Aviation Administration
records and reported in an article in Wednesday's editions of the
St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch.
   ``It's certainly of concern,'' said Richard Livingston of the
110,000-member International Airline Passengers Association.
``Obviously any time you have an uncontained engine explosion,
you've opened the door to catastrophe.''
   John Nance, a pilot and air safety analyst who generally defends
the safety of airlines, said, ``It is higher than I would have
expected.''
   The 16 serious incidents occurred when engine parts tore into the
engine casing or hurtled out of the engine, according to the FAA
records.
   It is believed that debris thrown from a failed engine severed
hydraulic lines on the United Airlines DC-10 that crashed in Sioux
City, Iowa, on July 19. The crash, which killed more than 100
people, remains under investigation.
   The FAA numbers are based on the agency's service difficulty
reports since 1983 for the General Electric CF6 and Pratt &amp; Whitney
JT9 engines, the ones used on the most U.S. wide-body jets. The
figures exclude smaller aircraft that are far more numerous in
airline fleets.
   The number of incidents detailed in the FAA records is surprising
to some, the newspaper said, because after the Sioux City crash the
National Transportation Safety Board said there have been only 12
other ``uncontained'' engine failures on any type of commercial
jetliner since 1982.
   But that counts only incidents in which there was injury, death
or what the agency regards as an immediate threat to safety.
   Engine makers and airlines, as well as the FAA and the National
Transportation Safety Board, stress that serious engine breakups are
still rare. Blades and other parts breaking away from engines are a
fact of life, since the blades often spin at over 10,000 revolutions
per minute and are weakened by birds, stress and ice.
   But such incidents rarely result in accidents because the parts
usually are contained in the engine casing or spit out in the
engine's exhaust.
   Engine designs use the best available technology, said Bob Hall,
an engineer for the Air Line Pilots Association, ``but just like
anything else in this world, there are times when all that doesn't
come to fruition.''
   Said Nance: ``The problem is not that the engines are going to
come apart. The problem is trying to contain them when they do.''
   Of the 288 instances of engine trouble on wide-body jets, at
least 94 occurred when blades broke from compressors and turbines
and seriously damaged engines but didn't spew parts out of the
engine casing.
   In 58 more cases, records aren't conclusive on whether the blades
simply cracked or broke off, but they indicate the engines often
were seriously damaged.
   The FAA records often aren't clear about the severity of the
damage in the 16 cases of ``engine case penetration.'' Reports in
four of the incidents note the case was violated but don't detail
the damage. Two say parts protruded from or were embedded in the
casing.

<TEXT>
   A computer equipment failure at the Toronto Stock
Exchange halted most trading for three hours Wednesday, making it
the exchange's longest technically related halt since computers went
into use 26 years ago.
   The shortened trading day didn't harm the market. The exchange's
composite index rose 11.27 points to close at 4,013.36 in a
moderately active trading of 32.5 million shares.
   Trading stopped 11 minutes after the market opened at 9:30 a.m.
and didn't resume again until 12:31 p.m. It closed at its usual time
of 4 p.m.
   Trading continued on the exchange's CATS system _ computer
assisted trading system _ where the exchange's smaller companies are
handled. But only about 20 per cent of the exchange's trading occurs
on CATS.

   ``It's one of those things you have to accept if you're going to
enjoy the benefits of the computer's assistance in trading,'' said
Fred Ketchen, senior vice-president of Scotia McLeod and chairman of
the exchange's market functions committee.
   Most securities firms were able to circumvent the problem by
routing their trading through other stock markets, he said.
   The exchange attributed the problem to a ``double hardware
failure'' in the trading system, said Revell.
   The primary information-storing computer disk system and its
backup both failed, Revell said.

<HEAD>U.S. Reports Barriers to Investment Down in Some Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some countries are lowering barriers to foreign
ownership of their oil and other resources, but many governments
hold on to restrictions that give their own citizens an advantage,
the U.S. International Trade Commission reported Wednesday.
   ``To the extent that a local industry has raw material or other
production cost advantages due to a government program, the products
of the industry obtain an advantage in world markets,'' it said.
   It found that Venezuela has a 94 percent price advantage for
natural gas and 91 percent for fuel oil, Saudi Arabia 83 percent for
gas and 72 percent for fuel oil, Indonesia a 50 percent advantage
for gas and none for fuel oil.
   In Mexico, production costs are as much as 19.25 percent lower
than in the United States due to savings from lower priced resources.
   The report added that U.S. imports increased because of these
price advantages.
   The report, made at the request of Congress, concentrated on
investment in the oil industry.
   It found wide variation in the effects of other governments'
policies on foreigners.
   Indonesia, for example, has recently permitted companies to be
treated like those locally owned as long as 51 percent of the stock
is held by Indonesian nationals. But foreigners are still limited to
a minority interest. Until recently, only companies completely owned
by Indonesian citizens were allowed to distribute goods.
   Though the Soviet Union is now permitting foreigners to hold a
majority of the stock in some joint ventures, they are limited to a
minority holding in energy and the major industries that consume it.
   The Communist government of China started encouraging foreign
investors much earlier than the Soviets but still subjects them to a
long bureaucratic approval process, the report said.
   A new law in Mexico this year automatically approves companies
owned by foreigners if the investment is less than $100 million. But
the foreign share in a telecommunications firm is stil limited to 49
percent and needs the approval of the National Foreign Investment
Commission.
   The Mexican government continues to hold exclusive rights to
explore and develop oil and natural gas, and to produce basic
petrochemicals, radioactive material and energy.
   Canada insists on 50 percent ownership by its nationals before
issuing licenses to exploit natural resources in frontier areas.
   Saudi Arabia keeps exclusive control of minerals, except for oil
and natural gas.
   Venezuela controls the domestic oil industry through the
state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela.
   Most members of the Organization of Petroleum Expoprting
Countries (OPEC) control their domestic energy industries.

   Stock brokers who deal in low-priced, often
risky securities known as ``penny stocks'' must obtain a new
customer's written approval before completing a sale, under a rule
adopted Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The new rule comes in response to a dramatic rise in the
fraudulent sale of penny stocks, which are usually not traded on
exchanges or quoted on the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) System, commonly known as the
national over-the-counter market.
   The new rule will take effect Jan. 1, 1990.
   In other matters, the SEC voted to seek comment on: revised rule
proposals for disclosure of securities trades by corporate officers
and other insiders; a proposal to raise the minimum net capital
required of registered broker dealers to as much as $250,000
depending on the ther method of computing net capital.
   The SEC also was supposed to consider new rules on information to
be disclosed during takeover battles, but those proposals have been
shelved until early September to give the SEC more time to consider
the issue.
   Because most penny stocks, usually selling for a few cents to a
few dollars per share, are not listed nationally information about
them is hard to come by and fraudulent claims are difficult to
dispute.
   Before the commission voted unanimously 5-to-0 to approve the
rule, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder said the problem was of ``great
concern'' to the agency. But he and several other members of the
commission also noted most penny stocks and penny stock dealers are
legitimate.
   Commissioner Charles C. Cox said he was distressed that because
of bad publicity, ``penny stock is almost becoming synonymous with
fraud and manipulative practices.''
   Two weeks ago, 14 people and two companies were charged in
Chicago with an alleged $10 million penny stock scam in which the
companies' share prices were artificially raised and the shares then
sold at large profits.
   Last fall, Ruder created a Penny Stock Task Force that found a
key element of penny stock fraud was high-pressure sales tactics _
often over the telephone _ on small, unsophisticated investors.
   Industry officials say the problem lies with unscrupulous
salesmen who pressure investors to buy the high-risk stocks of new
or small companies, or with crooks peddling the stocks of sham
companies.
   The ``rapidly rising tide of penny stock fraud and abuse'' is
``the No. 1 threat'' facing small investors, according to the North
American Securities Administrators Association, a state-level
investment regulators group.
   In the first half of the current fiscal year, the SEC has
received 2,462 complaints about penny stock fraud compared to 1,510
for all of last year.
   ``This will help us in our investigations,'' James I. Goldstein,
head of the task force, said of the new rule. ``Here's something
that will require writings to be made,'' said Goldstein, who is also
an associate director of enforcement with the SEC.
   The new rule, first proposed in February, will require brokers
and dealers to obtain written purchase agreements from new customers
before completing their first three transactions in stocks that are
neither traded on stock exchanges nor through the NASDAQ system.
   The rule would apply to stocks selling at $4.99 or less per share
or to stocks issued by companies with less than $2 million in
tangible assets.
   Broker-dealers also would have to obtain financial information
from the customer such as income, investment experience and
investment objectives; determine whether the transaction is suitable
for the customer's needs and write down the basis for that
determination.
   Securities issued by some companies and sales to certain
investors would be exempt from the `put it in writing' requirements.

   Those exceptions include initial public offerings that are
scheduled to be listed with NASDAQ or a stock exchange and customers
who have dealt with the broker previously.

   Stanley Works, the worldwide toolmaker,
announced Wednesday it has completed its purchase of Parker Group, a
manufacturer of fastening products.
   Parker, based in Northboro, Mass., employs about 400 people at
plants in Worcester, Northboro and Southbridge, Mass., and in West
Greenwich, R.I.
   The company makes glue guns, stapling products, riveting tools
and soldering tools.
   Stanley did not release the terms of the purchase.
   ``Parker has developed a leading position in the design,

   Stanley Group Vice President David M. Hadlow described Parker as
a ``good strategic fit'' with other Stanley businesses.
   Stanley, based in New Britain, had sales of $1.9 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Exchange Takes No Action Against Archer-Daniels-Midland Exec</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade has refused to take
action against the chairman of a major grain company in response to
member complaints that his comments about the CBOT have damaged the
exchange, officials said Wednesday.
   CBOT Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said in a notice to members that
to punish Dwayne Andreas for his comments about the exchange would
be inappropriate because Andreas is not a Board of Trade member.
   Last month, Andreas, chairman of Decatur, Ill.-based
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., criticized the Board of Trade after the
exchange ordered traders to reduce their holdings in the July
soybean futures contract to 1 million bushels.
   The July 11 order was apparently made to break up an alleged
attempt by the Italian grain merchant Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA to
corner the U.S. soybean market. Ferruzzi has denied making such an
attempt.
   After the order was issued, Andreas said the CBOT has exposed
itself to cornering attempts because it has fallen behind the times.
He said the CBOT had become ``more of a gambling institution than a
hedging center.''
   A petition circulated by members of the CBOT contended that
Andreas' comments constitute actions detrimental to the welfare of
the CBOT. The petition, signed by more than 100 members, asked the
exchange's board of directors to suspend the clearing privileges of
ADM Investor Services Inc., Archer-Daniels-Midland's CBOT clearing
affiliate.
   In a letter dated Aug. 14, Mahlmann reminded Andreas that as
chairman of a member firm, Andreas is obligated to present
information to the exchange on any member in violation of the
exchange's rules.
   ``Accordingly, the Chicago Board of Trade remains open to
receiving any information which your firm wishes to provide in
evidence of possible rule violations under the Exchange's purview,''
Mahlmann wrote.
   A woman who said she was Andreas' secretary said Wednesday he was
unavailable for comment on the letter.

<TEXT>
   American-owned assembly plants refuse to
sign with a ``corrupt'' union leader in order to end a 23-day-old
labor dispute because giving in would be ``like spreading a cancer''
throughout the industry, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``Nobody is understanding the real issue here; the obvious and
blatant corruption in Mexico,'' said Arnold Kezsbom, president of
the New York-based Service Manufacturing Corp., which manufactures
soft luggage.
   The corporation's assembly plant in this northern border city is
one of 15 companies involved in a union power struggle with a local
leader of the Mexican Labor Federation, or CTM.
   The CTM's Rafael Morales put up strike flags and closed the gates
of the plants July 25 after Abel Hernandez, the union leader
representing the workers, withdrew from the CTM.
   The strike is costing the plants about $500,000 a day in lost
production and at least two have threatened to pull out of Mexico.
   Morales argued that because the plants had no CTM union leader,
he had the right to declare himself in charge, said managers who
have spoken to him.
   The CTM is the most powerful labor union in Tamaulipas state and
few dare to challenge its authority.
   So it was a rare show of force when about 900 out of some 2,000
plant workers affected by the strike ripped down CTM strike flags
Tuesday, locked themselves in their plants and returned to work.
   The workers have vowed to remain inside the plants until the
dispute is solved.
   ``The important thing is that we're at our jobs. We don't want
these plants to close,'' said Gustin Villanueva, a worker at
Invamex, a subsidiary of the Elyria, Ohio-based Invacare Corp.
wheelchair manufacturer.
   The strike flags were replaced early Wednesday by the local labor
arbitration board and Reynosa Mayor Ernesto Gomez Lira.
   Groups of about a dozen of Morales' men stood outside the plants
with orders ``not to let anybody in or out,'' said Juan Olivo, a
laborer at a plant unionized under Morales.
   The labor board, controlled by the CTM, has authorized Morales as
union leader but the plants are arguing against that decision in
federal court and with top federal authorities.
   Kezsbom said in an interview in McAllen, Texas, just north of
Reynosa, that the companies have decided to stand firm against
Morales because he is known as a ``corrupt individual.''
   He said that giving in would be ``like spreading a cancer''
throughout the industry.
   Kezsbom said Morales forces companies to allow his union to
control trucking contracts, transportation of waste and even food
coupons so that workers have to buy food from stores he controls.
   There is no way to control business costs when dealing with a
union head whose demands escalate each day, he said.
   Reporters have been unable to locate Morales for several days at
his headquarters, his home or the places he is known to frequent.
   Kezbom, meanwhile, denounced Gomez Lira's ``gangster-type
tactics'' in dealing with workers in the middle of the night.
   Gomez Lira toured most of the plants about 1 a.m. and told
workers locked inside that they should leave peacefully or the
police would take them out, workers interviewed said.
   Gomez Lira told the Associated Press that he recommended the
workers leave to ``prevent confrontations'' that might occurr.
   But Don King, manager of the West Bend, Wis.-based West Bend
plant, said Gomez Lira ``harassed employees and intimidated them try
to get them to leave.''
   The workers say they have no obligation under Mexican labor law
to sign with the CTM and, in fact, are happy with Hernandez no
matter whom he represents.

   The president and chief operating officer
of Vestron Inc., Strauss Zelnick, has left the ailing film maker and
distributor to head the Fox Film Corp., a division of Fox Inc.,
Vestron said Wednesday.
   Austin O. Furst Jr., Vestron's chairman and chief executive
officer, will assume Zelnick's responsibilities at the
Stamford-based company, which produced ``Dirty Dancing,'' Vestron
said in a statement.
   Zelnick, who is to become president and chief operating officer
of Fox Film, could not be reached for comment.
   In June, Vestron laid off about 140 employees, effectively
shutting down its film production and distribution businesses.
   Officials at the 8-year-old company said the layoffs were
necessitated by a cash shortage brought on by Vestron's loss of a
$100 million line of credit.

<HEAD>Marvin Davis Ups Bid for UAL to $275 a Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Marvin Davis on Wednesday increased his
bid for UAL Corp. to $6.2 billion and set the stage for a proxy
battle for the parent of United Airlines.
   A spokesman for Davis said the price could go higher after a
review of the company's internal data.
   Davis offered $240 a share, or $5.4 billion, earlier this month,
revitalizing interest in buying Chicago-based UAL. His latest offer
is $275 a share.
   The stock closed Wednesday at $251.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange, down $2.50. Davis' new bid was revealed after the market
closed.
   Last weekend, UAL officials reportedly met with leaders of the
Air Line Pilots Association to discuss a possible
management-employee buyout or recapitalization to put a large chunk
of shares into an employee stock ownership plan as a means of
blocking any hostile takeover.
   Davis emphasized that he does not want to be regarded as an
unfriendly suitor.
   ``Our continuing desire (is) to proceed on a friendly basis,''
said spokesman James N. Fingeroth.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, UAL said it had been served with a
stockholder consent form from Davis asking shareholders to remove
all members of the company's board of directors except Chairman
Stephen M. Wolf, reduce the board's membership to five from 16 and
elect a new slate headed by Davis.
   The Davis spokesman said the document is intended only to
establish a time frame _ Aug. 16 to Oct. 15 _ for determining which
shareholders would be eligible to vote on the measures should there
be a proxy battle.
   ``This is not to be interpreted as a change in Mr. Davis'
policy,'' said Fingeroth, adding that Davis does not now intend to
exercise the option to solicit votes against the current board.
   UAL had no response to Davis' action, said spokeswoman Sara
Dornacker.
   She said the UAL board will meet Thursday, but would not say if
it is a special meeting held in response to the latest Davis moves.
   Jim Damron, spokesman for United's pilots union, also refused to
comment on the developments.

<HEAD>Eastern Settles Pension Payment Suit With Pilots Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines agreed Wednesday to pay more than
$32 million into the pension fund of striking pilots to settle a
2-year-old suit against the financially troubled carrier.
   A statement from the Air Line Pilots Association in Washington,
D.C., predicted the payment will be approved in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, which has supervised Eastern's finances since the carrier
filed for Chapter 11 protection five days after the March 4 strike
by pilots, flight attendants and machinists.
   The settlement sets a Sept. 15 deadline for the payment of the
$32 million, which represents regular company payments into the fund
and interest from 1985 to 1988, ALPA said.
   A 1987 ALPA suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington,
claimed Eastern violated federal law by failing to make scheduled
pension payments. If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland does not
approve the settlement, ALPA said it would file another suit.
   Eastern, which was reportedly losing $1 million a day before the
strike, was granted two waivers by the Internal Revenue Service
since 1985 to withhold some pension payments, said Robin Matell, a
spokesman for the Miami-based carrier.
   Since the strike, Eastern has attempted to rebound as a smaller
airline. The company has stated its goal of rebuilding to two-thirds
of its 1,040 pre-strike flight schedule.
   Matell said Eastern, a division of Texas Air Corp., owes a total
of about $98 million in outstanding payments and interest to its
seven employee pension funds. He was unaware of any other employee
legal action similar to the ALPA suit.
   Part of the carrier's plan to emerge from Chapter 11 include
on-time payment to its pension plans. Eastern announced in June it
plans to pay about $100 million into various pension plans by Sept.
15.
   On June 1, Eastern reached an agreement with the U.S. Labor
Department to pay $3.1 million to several benefit plans to settle a
case in which the government alleged the carrier illegally tapped
employee funds to pay corporate expenses.
   Eastern entered into the agreement without admitting or denying
it violated federal pension laws.

   An aviation industry task force said Wednesday it
gave the Federal Aviation Administration guidelines for a program to
prevent and repair corrosion on Boeing commercial airplanes.
   The 10-month study examined corrosion data from airline reports,
FAA records and a Boeing fleet survey on Boeing 707, 727, 737 and
747 jetliners.
   The task force recommended a corrosion protection, inspection and
repair program for each section of the aircraft studied.
   The task force included Boeing structural specialists, airline
maintenance experts and observers from the FAA and from foreign
regulatory agencies. It grew out of studies that government and
industry groups made after a 1988 accident in which the roof of an
Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 peeled off over Hawaii, sweeping one
flight attending to her death.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the task force's
recommendations were drawn up to be used as a basis for the first
industrywide standards on corrosion.
   The FAA will study the recommendations and is expected to propose
a mandatory anti-corrosion program for U.S. airlines. The task force
said foreign agencies were expected to adopt the program for
carriers registered in their countries.

<TEXT>
   Marshall Field's adds Ohio to the short
list of states in which it operates with the opening this week of a
$25 million store that Chairman Philip B. Miller said mirrors
renovation underway at Field's flagship outlet.
   Miller said Hambrecht, Terrell International, the New York
architectural firm that designed the Columbus store, also has been
working on a renovation of 1 million square feet at Field's landmark
store in Chicago.
   ``It's the largest renovation that has been done in the history
of retailing. And a lot of elements that you will see in this (Ohio)
building ... recall the significant, historic architectural features
of our State Street store (in Chicago),'' Miller said Wednesday.
   The $110 million Chicago project is to be completed in 1992.
   Field's, which operates 15 stores in Illinois, four in Wisconsin,
and four in Texas, opens its first store in Ohio on Friday, a
200,000-square-foot anchor of a $200 million shopping mall built to
revitalize a section of the capital city's downtown.
   An open atrium is the focal point of the three-level Field's
store, which includes a replica of the unique clock that is a
landmark at the State Street store.
   It is the first new department store in almost three years for
Field's, a division of BAT Industries PLC, a British
tobacco-insurance-retailing conglomerate. The last one opened in San
Antonio, Texas, in October 1986.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was trading higher against the
Japanese yen Thursday morning on expectations of an improved U.S.
trade deficit, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
back.
   The dollar opened at 142.25 yen, up 0.45 yen from Wednesday's
close of 141.80 yen. In New York overnight it had closed at 142.20
yen.
   During the morning trading session, the dollar moved in a range
of 142.20 to 142.45 yen, closing the session at 142.26 yen.
   An exchange dealer at Mitsui Bank said Wednesday's announcements
of U.S. housing starts and industrial capacity utilization rates had
little effect on the market.
   ``The upper end (of this morning's range) is restrained by
central bank intervention, and at the lower end buyers appear,'' the
dealer added, speaking anonymously.
   The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that housing starts had
increased 0.8 percent in July, while the Federal Reserve announced
that factory capacity utilization had risen marginally to 83.6
percent.
   Rather than concentrating on these figures, dealers were
anticipating an improvement in the U.S. merchandise trade statistics
for June, to be announced later Thursday by the Department of
Commerce, the dealer said.
   Other dealers said the market lacked direction as it waited for
the trade figures. But most participants expected the U.S. trade
deficit for June to show an improvement.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which
reached a record-high Wednesday by gaining 273.46 points, lost 79.65
points, or 0.22 percent, to close the morning session at 35,004.50.
   Traders reported a shift of buying interest from high-priced
issues, which were mainly purchased for quick profit-taking, to
shares with lower price-earnings ratios.
