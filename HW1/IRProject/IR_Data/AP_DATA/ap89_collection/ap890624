<HEAD>Jury: Joey Heatherton Did Not Assault Clerk</HEAD>

   A jury ruled Friday that Joey Heatherton was
negligent but did not assault or beat a passport clerk who claimed
the entertainer attacked her in 1985, and both women said they were
pleased with the verdict.
   The jury refused to award any money for pain and suffering,
emotional distress or punitive damages, but it assessed Miss
Heatherton $20,500 for the year's salary the clerk lost and her
medical bills.
   Mary Polik sued Miss Heatherton, 44, for $6 million, claiming
that the entertainer ripped out her hair, slapped her and ``banged
and bashed'' her head on a counter top after she told her she had
the wrong photos for a passport and that she needed the $35 fee in
exact change.
   ``I'm very happy,'' Heatherton said. ``I've been vindicated and
I'm glad the situation has been resolved.''
   ``Ms. Polik was looking for a $6 million gold mine and instead
she's back to where she was in 1985 _ working for a living like
everybody else,'' added Heatherton's attorney, William Kunstler.
   Polik also said she was pleased with the verdict. ``No human
being has the right to beat up on another,'' she said.
   Polik's lawyer, Marie Ng, said she considered the verdict a
victory for Polik. ``I am thrilled,'' she said. ``The jury found Ms.
Heatherton negligent. They said that intentionally or
unintentionally she did what she was accused of and ordered her to
pay for medical expenses and loss of earnings.''
   Polik, 27, said she suffered pinched neck nerves, headaches,
dizziness and nausea following the July 8, 1985, attack.

<HEAD>Opposition Unites on Single Candidate for Presidential Election</HEAD>

   Socialist parties have agreed to back
Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin to form a united front for
Chile's opposition in presidential elections set for December.
   President Augusto Pinochet, the general whose military government
has ruled this South American nation since a 1973 coup, has said he
will not run for the presidency but will remain as commander of the
army.
   The army on Friday threatened ``the use of legitimate force'' if
needed to keep Pinochet as its commander after the elections.
   Leaders of the pro-socialist Party for Democracy and two major
factions of the divided Socialist Party held ceremonies Friday to
announce their support of Aylwin, 70.
   ``It's not just a president we are going to elect,'' said Ricardo
Lagos, head of the Party for Democracy. ``We are going to elect the
man who will rebuild a democratic system trampled by a
dictatorship.''
   Aylwin, a lawyer and former Senate president, predicted victory
in the Dec. 14 election. His centrist Christian Democrats form
Chile's largest political party.
   ``I'm sure we will triumph,'' he said in a speech accepting the
socialists' support. ``I'm sure we will have a government of
democratic reconstruction.''
   Pinochet had been expected to run for president, but legal
experts said the constitution, written by his military government,
barred him because of a clause prohibiting a president from seeking
re-election.
   Last Tuesday, Pinochet publicly declared he would not be a
candidate, but he also said he would not relinquish command of the
powerful army.
   Conservative and pro-Pinochet groups are split over possible
candidates. The main contenders are Sergio Jarpa, leader of the
center-right National Renovation Party, and former Finance Minister
Hernan Buchi, who is Pinochet's choice but has not agreed to run.
   The Christian Democrats, Socialists and Party for Democragy are
the major forces in a 17-party opposition coalition. A coalition
leader, Claudio Vazquez, said Aylwin would be formally nominated on
July 4.
   Leaders of the Communist Party and other far-left parties that
are outside the coalition have said they will not present an
opponent to Aylwin but will run their own candidates for Congress.
   Coalition members have been negotiating on a single slate of
candidates for the Senate and House of Deputies.
   Aylwin said his platform will include the prosecution of those
responsible for human rights violations during the years of military
rule. He called rights abuses ``an open wound that will not heal
until the truth is discovered.''
   Pinochet scheduled the election after voters, in a referendum
last October, overwhelmingly rejected a military proposal that the
general remain in power until 1997. The elected government is to be
installed March 11, 1990, with the president serving a four-year
term.
   The constitution bars the new president from replacing any of the
existing armed forces commanders for up to eight years.
   A statement by the army command in Santiago said Friday it has
the ``mission of safeguarding the constitutional order, either
through representations or, in their absence, through the use of
legitimate force.''

   The People's Liberation Army, which crushed
China's pro-democracy movement, is expected to play an increasingly
important role in civilian politics.
   It was lack of army support that doomed Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang when he challenged senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's condemnation of student protesters for a freer society.
   Now that at least 150,000 soldiers are stationed in and around
Beijing to enforce martial law, cultivating the army will be a
necessity for any replacement for Zhao and prospective successor to
the 84-year-old Deng.
   Which way the army will throw its support and whether it will
stand united behind one candidate have become key questions, but
most foreign diplomats and military experts say they can do little
more than guess.
   One problem is that normal diplomatic and military contacts have
been interrupted by the fighting in Beijing. Outsiders have been
reduced to watching which generals appear on television and reading
between the lines in their speeches.
   Another is that the military stands outside the political
dichotomy of liberals and conservatives defined by their stands on
the speed of economic reform and degree of cultural freedom. The
military has its own priorities, including stability and maintaining
a political atmosphere in which the army has high status.
   Political initiatives are unlikely to come from the rank and
file, many of whom are illiterate and subjected to heavy propaganda.
Young officers with relatively liberal educations might support
reformers such as Zhao but have little power.
   The key players will be senior officers in their 50s and 60s who
owe their positions to Deng and are desirous of promotion and
national stability.
   By and large, the conservatives seem to meet their interests best
right now, although long-term stability under a leadership that
continues to repress the citizenry is dubious.
   In the latest move, army propaganda chief Shao Huaze took over as
editor in chief of the party's official newspaper, the People's
Daily. The paper said today that Shao replaced Tan Wenrui, who
resigned for health reasons.
   Zhao's problems with the military began well before weeks of
student protests for which he expressed sympathy threw the party
leadership into crisis.
   Zhao was part of China's rising ``young'' generation of leaders
in their 50s and 60s who, unlike Deng and those in their 80s, were
not army officers in the pre-1949 civil war and World War II. Their
rise was interpreted as part of a natural evolution from the heavily
ideological politics of a revolutionary leadeship toward a more
pragmatic and even technocratic government style.
   But the status and budget of the military eroded steadily under
the new leaders as funds were shifted from defense to economic
development. Deng approved the shift, but it appears Zhao took the
blame.
   Deng's personal power base was in the Red Army, in which he
served as political commissar during the 1930s and 1940s when it
fought the Nationalist government and Japanese invaders. He made
Zhao a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which he
heads and which sets military policy.
   The army reportedly remained lukewarm toward Zhao, who was more
comfortable meeting diplomats and playing golf than visiting the
troops. When Zhao cast his vote against a crackdown on the
protesters and publicly blamed the growing chaos on Deng, not one
army official rose to Zhao's support, according to foreign diplomats.
   There clearly was opposition to orders to shoot the crowd
protecting the students. Some units sat on the sidelines throughout
the battling and never joined in. There were reports, never
confirmed, of individual soldiers or small groups firing on other
soldiers who shot civilians.
   But there were no reports of units opposing the political shakeup
or contemplating an anti-Deng coup.
   Clues in the official media indicate Deng's candidate to succeed
Zhao is Qiao Shi, a member of the party's top decision-making group.
He also lacks a military background, but he may have an alternative
acceptable to the senior officers: he is believed in charge of
China's internal secret service, and at one point was reported to
oversee the people's armed police, which has links to the army.
   There are no indications the army is preparing to throw up its
own candidate. The military has not put forward a political
candidate since Marshal Lin Piao fell from grace as Mao Tse-tung's
prospective heir in 1971 after allegedly plotting a coup.
   One lesson may be drawn from the army's performance of the past
few weeks. Even in the face of the hardest choice many soldiers
probably have ever had to make _ to disobey orders or to shoot at
people who had been giving them drinks and food for days as they sat
parked in trucks around Beijing _ discipline and unity prevailed.
   When it comes time to rally behind a successor to Deng, the army
likely will act as one.

<HEAD>Memo Stirs Flap over City Councilman's Overalls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHWOOD, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of worn, faded overalls has caused
a flap at City Hall where the mayor wants a councilman to pay more
attention to his appearance.
   After Councilman Andrew Jackson McKnight showed up recently at a
City Council workshop in overalls, Mayor David Head issued a memo
asking councilmen to dress properly when representing Richwood, a
small town about 50 miles south of Houston.
   The memo mentions no names, but Head said it was directed at
McKnight. His memo does not ban jeans but asks that they be clean
and in good shape.
   ``While I'm sure that faded overalls and T-shirts are
comfortable, I feel that they have no place in the council
chambers,'' Head wrote.
   ``Hell will freeze over before I let anyone tell me how to
dress,'' McKnight said. ``It's nobody's business how a person
dresses. If someone wants to come down there in rags, that's his
business.''
   He intends to wear his overalls to the July 11 council meeting.
   McKnight, 54, said he has only worn overalls once since being
elected in May, and that was because he didn't have time to change
after taking care of some goats at his farm.
   But Head said McKnight has shown up at City Hall wearing T-shirts
with holes around the neck, and cares little about his appearance
when representing the city.
   McKnight lost an election to Head in 1988 but won a council post
by a slim margin as a write-in candidate in May. Head, 50, stepped
down from his council post to run unopposed for mayor in May.

   Congressional leaders say newly declassified
Pentagon figures on the cost of the B-2 stealth bomber bolster their
argument against spending for the costly program.
   ``The Department of Defense has produced a B-2 program that won't
fly financially,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, said Friday after the estimates were
released.
   ``Members of Congress are balking at spending $4.1 billion this
year for SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative),'' he said.
   ``It is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much per
year on a plane.''
   According to the Pentagon, the radar-evading plane will cost
about $24 billion over a three-year peak spending period. The
estimated cost for the bomber in fiscal 1990 is $4.7 billion,
including $2 billion in research, development, testing and
evaluation and $2.7 billion in production.
   Estimated costs in fiscal 1991 total $5.3 billion with costs in
peak years of fiscal 1992 at $7.8 billion, fiscal 1993 at $8.4
billion and fiscal 1994 at $7.7 billion.
   Recent estimates have shown the aircraft will cost between $500
million and $650 million a copy. The figures released Friday showed
the Pentagon has invested about $22.4 billion in the program and
total cost to complete the project would be about $70 billion.
   The Defense Department plans to purchase 132 of the planes,
including three in fiscal 1990, five in fiscal 1991, 10 in fiscal
1992, 21 in fiscal 1993 and 24 in fiscal 1994.
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., a member of the House panel who had
called for the Pentagon to publicly release the cost figures on the
aircraft, said publication of the figures means will make Congress
take an even closer look.
   ``I was shocked at the amount of money,'' Bennett said. ``This
early on we will look at it with more care and more scrutiny.''
   The full House Armed Services Committee meets Tuesday and will
take up the 1990 National Defense Authorization Act.
   Opposition to the aircraft has grown in Congress with lawmakers
arguing that production should be suspended because the bomber has
yet to undergo flight testing.
   In an appeal to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, a former astronaut and test pilot, said pursuing production
of the bomber violates the rule ``fly before buy.''
   The bomber program has been ``buy it, and then we'll see how it
flies,'' Glenn said in a letter to Cheney.
   The defense secretary, at a hearing Thursday, indicated initial
tests of the aircraft would be conducted by the end of the summer.
In his fiscal 1990 budget, Cheney had proposed pushing back
production of the B-2 a year to 1993.
   In response to Glenn's criticism, Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams said this week that Cheney is ``thinks the B-2's long-range
capabilities and its stealth capacities make it an important
strategic asset to the United States.''
   ``So, he plans to continue right on with that and he reaffirmed
his strong support for the B-2 program,'' Williams said.

   A disgruntled customer has been accused of
staging a one-man demolition derby at a suburban Pittsburgh car
dealership.
   Police said Albert H. ``Pete'' Ruff, 72, drove a 1989 Toyota
through the glass doors of Krebs Toyota's showroom in Shaler
Township on June 15 and crashed into five vehicles, including a
police cruiser called to the scene.
   He caused about $5,000 damage, authorities said.
   The dispute was related to a car Ruff had leased from Krebs,
according to Mary Kay Condie, District Justice James Bowen's
secretary.
   ``He apparently found out that he could have got a better deal by
buying the car,'' she said after the retiree's arraignment Wednesday.
   Ruff has been charged with reckless endangerment, criminal
mischief, simple assault, terroristic threats and resisting arrest.
The criminal complaint against Ruff alleges he threatened dealership
salesmen ``with bodily harm.''

<TEXT>
   Senate passage of an unprecedented child-care
package sends the debate to the House, where Republicans and the
Bush administration promise to fight anew for a plan without the
billion-dollar subsidies being pushed by Democrats.
   ``We've made a significant step toward providing affordable, safe
care for American children and equal economic opportunity for
American women,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
said Friday just before the measure passed on a voice vote.
   With $1.75 billion in direct subsidies for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 and more than $2 billion a year in tax credits, the
Senate package represents the greatest government effort ever to
address child-care needs of working parents and its first major
effort since an emergency plan adopted during World War II.
   Action on child care is expected to accelerate in the House next
week, and Republicans vowed to fight for legislation far different
from the Senate's plan.
   ``This is just a first step and a very short step,'' said Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``I'm going to encourage the
administration not to view what happened in the Senate as final.''
   With the White House raising the possibility of a veto, Democrats
too said they hoped to strike a compromise, although they are not
willing to abandon the subsidy approach.
   ``We are quite willing to hear the administration, to listen to
their suggestions and their recommendations,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
   It appeared early Friday that partisan bickering would threaten a
two-week Senate recess. But Republicans, after losing several
attempts to significantly change the Democratic bill, relented and
struck a deal with majority Democrats on a timetable to end the
debate.
   Only a handful of senators remained when the measure passed. The
leadership had agreed to the voice vote so those lawmakers who had
to catch flights out of Washington would not be recorded as absent
for the vote.
   Democrats characterized the legislation as historic and a
long-overdue effort to support low-income parents who must work but
cannot find affordable child care.
   ``The real winners, the children, are closer to a safer, more
effective and affordable child-care program,'' said Kennedy.
   The measure was the product of an unusual alliance between
liberal Democrat Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Utah Republican
Orrin Hatch, whose conservative credentials helped Democrats brush
aside many Republican attacks on the plan.
   ``This is a monumental achievement,'' Hatch said.
   Despite changes designed to accommodate Bush, Dole said the
measure contained ``nothing for the president of the United States.''
   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater added that despite the addition
of provisions Bush favored, the bill remained ``a candidate for a
veto.''
   In addition to the $1.75 billion authorization for child-care
subsidies, the measure includes three tax-relief provisions designed
to help low- and moderate-income families pay for child care and
health insurance for their children.
   One would supplement the existing Earned Income Tax Credit to
provide up to $750 more for parents whose annual incomes are less
than $10,000 and have two or more children under age 5. Parents
could receive a $500 credit for one eligible child.
   The second tax-related provision allows those who qualify for the
existing Dependent Care Tax Credit to get 90 percent of their credit
up front, a move designed to give cash to families who are eligible
for the credit but cannot take advantage of it because they don't
make enough to owe federal taxes.
   The third provision, which Republicans vigorously opposed, would
provide parents with annual incomes of less than $12,000 with a tax
credit of to $500 to pay 50 percent of the cost of buying health
insurance for their children.

<HEAD>Top HUD Officials Solicited Donations From Those They Regulated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two top officials in the New York regional office
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development regularly
solicited charitable donations from the people they regulated, The
New York Times reported in its Saturday editions.
   Some of the builders, housing managers, architects, lawyers and
local housing authority directors approached by Joseph D.
Monticciolo, the previous New York HUD administrator, and Geraldine
McGann, the current one, told the Times they felt that agreeing to
requests to buy tickets or make donations would improve their
chances when it came to securing HUD financing.
   ``Does it help you? I'd say yes,'' said Joseph Barry, a builder
in Hoboken, N.J., with several HUD projects who has given generously.
   ``It's perceived as the cost of doing business with HUD in the
current political climate,'' said Robert McKay, director of the
Council of Large Public Housing Authorities.
   It is a violation of the federal ethics code to use ``public
office or official title for private gain,'' even if the money goes
to charity, according to Mary Brunette, a spokeswoman for HUD
Secretary Jack F. Kemp.
   No one has suggested that the money raised at the charity
testimonials was misused.
   But Brunette said, ``HUD employees should not use their positions
to solicit contributions, even for a charity, from the business and
governmental community that they're working with.'' Violations can
result in dismissal.
   Monticciolo, who ran the department's office that includes New
York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from 1981 to
1988, and Mrs. McGann, the administrator since June 1988, did not
respond to telephone messages left at their homes, the Times said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Erotic Department Store remains open for
business today, its supposedly ``sizzling'' saleswomen talking sex
by phone under no less an authority than the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Their tape-recorded portrayals of sexual encounters _ part of a
multibillion-dollar business known as dial-a-porn _ were ruled
constitutional, within some restrictions, by a unanimous high court
Friday.
   The decision, based on the First Amendment guarantee of free
speech, rejected a federal law that sought to ban telephone
pornography outright. Obscene messages can be banned, the court
said, but simply ``indecent'' ones cannot.
   ``It's fantastic. The First Amendment will not be put down,''
said Gloria Leonard, publisher of the sex magazine High Society and
a leading dial-a-porn entrepreneur. ``We feel very triumphant.''
   But telephone pornography opponents claimed victory, too.
   ``Many, many of these messages are obscene,'' said Len Munsil,
lawyer for the Children's Legal Campaign in Phoenix.
   As such, he said, they fall under the remaining ban.
   The debate began in 1983, when the court-ordered breakup of the
telephone company gave independent companies the right to operate
information services. Callers pay the fee, usually up to a few
dollars, on their phone bill. In exchange, they can hear women, or
men, make suggestive comments.
   The problem: Curious children were calling the numbers umpteen
times, racking up enormous phone bills.
   Parents were not amused. Neither were organizations such as
Munsil's, which has been mounting lobbying and courtroom campaigns
to have dial-a-porn banned as a corrupting influence on minors.
   ``There's no way to discriminate between adults and children in
the listening audience,'' said Munsil. ``And it's quite clear that
these messages are harmful to children.''
   Beyond citing protections of free speech, Ms. Leonard pointed to
dial-a-porn's financial success as evidence that it meets community
standards of acceptability. ``At its peak, a number of years ago, we
were getting half a million calls a day,'' she said.
   While Ms. Leonard said her business is off dramatically _ down to
perhaps 5,000 calls a day _ she attributes that to a proliferation
of competitors, not any lessened interest in sex talk.
   ``There are dozens if not hundreds of these numbers in every
city,'' she said. ``This stuff has really taken off, on a
mom-and-pop basis.''
   But a source in the Justice Department speaking on condition of
anonymity said many of the dial-a-porn services appear to have
corporate links.
   The opportunity for profit is great; all that's required is a
contract with the local phone company for an information service
number _ often given under the ``976'' exchange _ a switchboard
capable of handling many calls at once, and women and men willing to
be recorded making suggestive words and noises.
   Some of the services provide live telephone contacts.
   Although complete figures haven't been compiled, court records
say 180 million dial-a-porn calls were placed in New York in 1984.
California has 204 separate dial-a-porn services, making up 25
percent of its information service numbers.
   Nationwide, the industry did an estimated $2 billion in business
last year.
   Congress asked the Federal Communications Commission to look into
restricting dial-a-porn in 1983, and last year the federal lawmakers
decided to ban the services outright.
   Although the court rejected the ban on messages that are only
``indecent,'' other restrictions are possible.
   Diane Killory, the FCC's general counsel, said the commission
likely will revive a plan to require access codes, scrambled
messages or credit card payment for dial-a-porn. The principle is
that children, lacking the codes, unscramblers or credit cards,
could not make the calls.
   Other steps are possible. In California, for example, Pacific
Bell will cut off 976 access to customers who request it, and
800,000 have done so.
   And the ban on obscene messages remains in effect, although the
difference between obscenity and indecency can be a difficult one to
draw.
   ``I don't believe that what we do is obscene,'' Ms. Leonard said.
``And if it is, it's yet to be proven.''

<TEXT>
   Inquiries about the sale of the
Malayan Railway for 37 cents continue to pour in from abroad, the
transport ministry said today.
   The minister, Ling Liong Sik, told reporters no decision has been
made on a buyer of the railway because the government Economic
Planning Unit was still evaluating recommendations by Bumiputra
Merchant Bank on the privatization of the railway. There are no
private railways in Malaysia.
   Officials said Japanese, Canadians and Americans were among those
who were serious about buying the railway, which has about 1,000
miles of track and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets,

   White House aides gave broad assurances
Congress was receiving relevant documents in the Iran-Contra affair,
even though the White House had little involvement in reviewing the
material, says a Senate Intelligence Committee report.
   The report issued Friday says lawyer John Nields didn't learn
until August 1987 that White House counsel hadn't been involved in
reviewing for relevancy the National Security Council files of
Oliver North.
   Instead, the White House counsel's office had relied entirely on
the FBI.
   `He expressed his outrage at this, since he did not view this as
sufficient compliance'' with Congress' requests, said the report.
``The White House representatives repeated their contention that the
Committees had, in fact, been given all the relevant documents in
North' office.''
   The 51-page study concludes that `White House aides made repeated
and broad assurances ... that they were receiving all White House
documents that were relevant. ... The White House staff, in fact,
had no way of knowing if other documents'' Congress needed weren't
being selected.
   The intelligence panel issued the report after looking into the
handling of documents after six important memos were produced at the
trial of North which the investigators had either not seen or seen
in different versions.
   The process of getting documents was ``very, very haphazard'' and
``fairly chaotic,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine.
   ``We have a situation where there's a lot of fault to go around
on all sides,'' said Cohen, R-Maine, vice chairman of the
intelligence committee. He was a member of the congressional panel
which investigated the Iran-Contra scandal in 1987.
   The committee found no evidence to suggest that the documents,
relating to an arrangement under which Honduras would support the
Nicaraguan Contras in exchange for expedited U.S. aid, had been
``deliberately and systematically withheld by the White House.''
   But David Boren, D-Okla., the committee chairman, said he could
``never rule out completely'' the possibility that someone could
have removed documents from certain files to prevent finding them in
any of several searches.
   One key memo, a Feb. 19, 1985, message to President Reagan from
then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane missed during
document searches, turned up last month in a box of papers at the
Reagan library in California. The memo recommends a letter be sent
to Honduran President Roberto Suazo stating the United States'
``deep conviction'' to support the Contras along with a promise to
defend Honduras against any incursion from Nicaragua.
   The memo strongly suggests the kind of ``quid pro quo''
arrangement with Honduras that has been denied by President Bush. It
was not turned up during two searches of NSC files, but was found in
an informal ``heads of state'' file at the presidential library that
has never been searched by investigators, the report said.

   The battered tanker Exxon Valdez was pulled
cautiously toward California today, leaving behind stained
shorelines and angry feelings from the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``I must say we're not sorry to see it go,'' Gov. Steve Cowper
said at a news conference in Juneau.
   The 987-foot vessel was stopped briefly for a scheduled look at
its hull, and video cameras were used to ensure that the punctured
hull was sound before the damaged ship was towed into the often
stormy Gulf of Alaska en route to a San Diego drydock and more than
$25 million in repairs.
   The 2,500-mile trip is expected to take about 20 days.
   The Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24, dumping almost 11
million gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into the waters of
Prince William Sound. After the accident, authorities pumped the
remaining oil from the ship into other tankers.
   The spill killed thousands of birds and sea mammals and spoiled
hundreds of miles of coastline. It also dealt a severe blow to
Alaska's $2 billion fishing industry, forcing officials to ban,
postpone or restrict fishing.
   The vessel unceremoniously lifted anchor Friday and came under
tow behind two 7,000-horsepower ocean-going tugboats.
   A third tug was attached to the tanker's stern. A salvage boat
trailed not far behind.
   Two escort vessels loaded with 9,000 feet of containment boom and
each carrying an oil skimming vessel with 4,000 barrels' capacity
brought up the rear.
   Al Kapp, skipper of the Journeyman out of California, posted a
hand-lettered sign on the side of his boat as he ushered the Exxon
Valdez away. ``Thanks a lot Exxon,'' the sign said.
   Speaking by radio to a nearby media vessel, Kapp said fishing
closures have hurt: ``It's disrupted my life; it's disrupted our
industry.''
   Progress initially was slow, and the tanker moved only about two
miles in the first two hours, said Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard.
   The speed is expected to increase to about 5 mph.
   Coast Guard spokeswoman Brenda Toledo said a light film of oil
was reported on the water near the tanker as it got under way. The
source of the sheen was unclear, she said, adding not much oil is
necessary to make a sheen. ``We're talking pints, not gallons,'' she
said.
   Seven Exxon officers and four salvage experts were aboard for the
trip to San Diego, officials said.
   The skeleton crew will monitor air pressure in the vessel's cargo
tanks, conduct inspections and be ready to help with the ship's
engines should the vessel run into trouble.
   Exxon and the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. have been criticized
for their slow handling of the spill during its first few days.
   Today, oil with a sludge-like consistency can be found 700 miles
from the reef.
   The tanker's former captain, Joseph Hazelwood, has pleaded
innocent to three felony counts of criminal mischief and
misdemeanors, including negligent discharge of pollutants and
operating a vessel while drunk. He is free on $50,000 bail.

<HEAD>Outgoing Social Security Chief Says Public Confidence Restored</HEAD>

   Dorcas R. Hardy says she is stepping down as
head of Social Security satisfied the agency she modernized and
streamlined, sometimes in the face of sharp congressional criticism,
is in good shape.
   But she warns that while overall public confidence in the program
is justifiably high, policies using Social Security Trust Funds to
underwrite other government programs and reduce the federal budget
deficit are ``fueling a lack of confidence'' in the program by
younger workers.
   ``Social Security continues to be misunderstood, by
beneficiaries, taxpayers and elected officials alike, and most
younger workers do not trust that the government will preserve
Social Security for their `Golden Years,''' she said in her letter
of resignation to President Bush on Friday.
   Hardy said she has confidence in the future of the Social
Security program, ``but that's not to say everybody does.''
   And, she said, many workers are ``discouraged'' by a provision
covering the working elderly that withholds $1 for every $2 they
earn over $8,880 a year, a provision she has worked to repeal.
   Hardy, 42, had sought to remain in the Social Security post she
has held for three years, but told The Associated Press the Bush
administration indicated to her she would be replaced.
   The administration is expected to nominate Gwendolyn King, a
former legislative aide to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., who later headed
the office of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh when he was governor
of Pennsylvania, according to sources who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Hardy said she will leave July 31, and plans to host a weekly,
syndicated television program about finances and explore other
options in the private sector.
   Hardy's tenure was marked by efforts to streamline and modernize
the agency despite declines in staffing, but critics on Capitol Hill
said service at the agency has deteriorated.
   Among the criticisms against her was that new services she
introduced have been implemented poorly and resulted in worse
service to the public. For example, a toll-free telephone service to
provide information to individuals on their benefits has come under
fire for a high rate of busy signals and inaccurate information is
given to callers.
   A Senate committee earlier this year asked whether Social
Security was violating privacy rights through its practice, since
halted, of verifying millions of Social Security numbers for private
companies engaged in checking credit ratings.
   And a House Government Operations subcommittee in March began an
inquiry into whether Hardy combined business trips with vacations
and political campaigning for members of Congress.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Special Senate
Committee on Aging and one of Hardy's harshest critics in Congress,
said he hoped new leadership ``can recapture the original spirit of
the agency to provide compassionate service to our most vulnerable
citizens.''
   But Hardy said the agency now has a plan that will lead a solvent
trust fund into the next century, and ``the vast majority of the
public is very pleased with the service Social Security provides.''
   A trust fund that was considered shaky before she took office now
has enough money to pay benefits until at least the middle of the
next century, according to a Social Security Administration report
in April.
   She takes credit for modernizing the agency's massive computer
operations, launching the 800 telephone service and providing to all
workers Social Security benefit estimates upon request.
   ``All this has been accomplished despite an imposed 20 percent
decrease in staffing,'' in which 63,000 jobs were eliminated through
attrition, she said.
   When she was named to head Social Security by President Reagan in
1986, she became the first woman to head the agency.
   She worked for Reagan on welfare issues when he was governor of
California, and she was an assistant secretary at the Department of
Health and Human Services during his first presidential term before
being named to the Social Security post.

   Some senators are impatient with what they see
as slow progress toward peace in El Salvador and believe a cut in
U.S. military aid could promote a settlement with leftist guerrillas.
   But the State Department's top official for Latin America,
Bernard Aronson, says a sharp aid reduction would play into the
hands of extremists and increase violence.
   Aronson testified Friday before the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations, making his congressional debut
as assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   Most senators at the hearing expressed opposition to
administration policy, asserting that $5 billion in U.S. aid to El
Salvador in less than a decade had produced minimal progress. They
noted the civil war in El Salvador continues and argued the
activities of rightist death squads are on the increase.
   Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said they
would seek legislation requiring that 50 percent of the $85 million
military aid planned for El Salvador be withheld for six months.
   The money will be released only if the administration certified
the Salvadoran government is making progress toward a settlement
with leftist guerrillas.
   Harkin said a number of Salvadorans identified with death squad
activities who had lowered their profile for a time are now back in
the ``good graces'' of the rightist ARENA party, which took over the
government three weeks ago after its electoral victory in March.
   Subcommittee chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., described U.S. policy
toward Central America as a ``costly, bloody failure'' and said a
new policy for El Salvador in particular is needed.
   But Aronson warned against suspending aid to El Salvador because
it would cost the U.S. influence with the government. At least twice
during the hearing he cited the precedent of Guatemala, recalling
that after U.S. military ties to that nation were suspended in 1977
under President Jimmy Carter there was a marked increase in the
number of political killings.
   In the absence of a restraining U.S. influence, he said, the
Guatemalan military ``killed everybody in sight.''
   Aronson, a Democrat with a conservative foreign policy outlook,
was treated more respectfully by the subcommittee than his
predecessor, Elliott Abrams, who alienated many lawmakers with his
combative approach.
   But Aronson took strong exception to a statement by Harkin that
the administration ``closes its eyes and ears to the threat from the
right'' in El Salvador.
   Aronson said admonitions to Salvadoran leaders for improvement in
the protection of human rights are carried frequently by
administration officials.
   He challenged assertions by Democrats on the panel that
administration policy has produced no gains in El Salvador. He noted
that despite the lack of a democratic tradition in El Salvador, five
national elections have been held since 1982 and that politically
motivated killings have dropped sharply over the years.

<HEAD>NHTSA Releases New Crash-Test Results</HEAD>

   Federal engineers say crash tests of 19 cars
show drivers of the Chevrolet Astro Van have the greatest chance of
head injury in an accident.
   The van's manufacturer, General Motors Corp., said the federal
tests aren't a valid indicator of crash-worthiness.
   The Astro Van was among 12 vehicles listed in the third round of
crash-test results released Friday by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. The vehicles were tested under NHTSA's
program to provide consumers a guide to the safety of 1989 vehicles.
   Results of seven other vehicles had been released previously.
   GM said the federal test results ``do not reflect the actual
safety performance of these vehicles on the road'' because the test
is done on only one vehicle.
   The vehicles were smashed at 35 mph into a fixed barrier, and the
stresses that resulted were measured by sensors on human-shaped
dummies protected by seat belts or other crash-protection devices.
   NHTSA engineers reported stresses on the head as an index called
the head injury criterion. The higher the index, the greater the
likelihood of injury.
   The Astro Van crash test produced a head injury criterion of
1,849 for the driver-side dummy in the Astro Van, NHTSA said. The
figure was more than double the head injury criterion recorded in a
test of the Mitsubishi van, the only other van tested this year.
   The Mitsubishi had a head injury criterion of 805, NHTSA said.
   Federal regulations require cars on the market to produce a head
injury criterion no greater than 1,000 in tests conducted by the
automakers. The public tests done by NHTSA and the mandatory tests
to meet safety regulations are not considered comparable because the
automakers' tests are done at 30 mph.
   Other new test results by weight class produced these driver head
injury criteria:
   _Subcompact cars: Mercury Tracer 4-door hatchback, 940.
   _Compact cars: Ford Probe 2-door hatchback, 970.
   _Large and mid-size cars: Chevrolet Caprice 4-door sedan, 1,328;
Chrysler Fifth Avenue 4-door sedan, 786; Eagle Premier 4-door sedan,
877; Lincoln Continental 4-door sedan, 863; and Plymouth Acclaim
4-door sedan, 663.
   _Trucks, vans and multi-purpose vehicles: Chevrolet S-10 Blazer,
834; Ford Bronco II, 994; and Jeep Cherokee, 968.
   NHTSA said small differences in test results aren't considered
significant.
   Previously released test results, by weight class, were:
   _Subcompact: Dodge Daytona 2-door hatchback, 399; Honda Civic CRX
2-door hatchback, 750; Mitsubishi Mirage 4-door sedan, 960.
   _Compact: Mitsubishi Galant 4-door sedan, 971.
   _Large and mid-size: Dodge Spirit 4-door sedan, 1,421; Eagle
Medallion 4-door sedan, 745; Ford Thunderbird 2-door, 541.

   Congressional leaders are pressing President
Bush for tough action against China but the White House is appealing
for patience, saying it will be a long time before Washington and
Beijing return to normal relations.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush, in a
meeting with senators Friday, asked for ``their understanding that
he was trying to do the best job possible to express the concerns of
the United States government, the outrage of American people in
terms of what they had seen there, and at the same time, to preserve
our relations as best we could.''
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del, said Bush ``asked for our patience and
forbearance.''
   Chinese authorities this week executed 27 people charged with
taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations.
   On Capitol Hill, calls continued for a stronger White House
response. Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said: ``I believe the
president must take tough action and block trade with and new
investments in China right now.'' He added that ``there are some
values which take precedence over commerce.''
   ``The stark barbarism of the communist regime is unforgivable to
all civilized people,'' Byrd said.
   ``The dust has settled on the blood of peaceful demonstrators,
and the regime wantonly spills fresh blood on top of old. It
executes its young on the altar of old men's egos and fears. America
cannot possibly be in the position of rewarding, appearing to
reward, or in any way countenance these acts,'' Byrd added.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who has called
on Bush to be more forceful in denouncing the Chinese government's
actions, attended the White House meeting but did not speak to
reporters afterwards.
   At the White House, Biden said Bush did not suggest lawmakers
should mute their criticism of his policy, and ``he made it very
clear that he believed that it was appalling what was happening in
China in terms of human rights.''
   He quoted Bush as saying ``there was a long road that was going
to have to be traveled in that relationship and that we shouldn't
move precipitously.''
   Fitzwater said Bush, in referring to ``a long road,'' was talking
about ``the events that have taken place there, and the amount of
time that anyone can foresee before we would have a return to a
normalcy or anything like we had before.''
   Unlike some of his congressional colleagues, Biden withheld
criticism or suggestions about Bush's policy.
   `I don't believe that we should suggest to the president
precisely what he should do,'' Biden said. ``I think what we should
do is make it clear to the president and make it clear to the
Chinese that there isn't any option that is beyond consideration.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said, ``I think the president was
saying that it's very simple to take a precipitous action, break
relations with China, but the long-range interests of the United
States require delicate, appropriate, judgmental handling of the
situation.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the acts of the Chinese government
against its own citizens ``must be met by an unrelenting and
unmistakable willingness to change immediately and significantly the
status quo of our relationship.''
   ``The bullets aimed at pro-democracy students, workers and
teachers are also aimed at us,'' Kerry said. ``Each shot that takes
a life, when met by silence, indifference or sense of impotence,
also takes with it a piece of who we are and what we are supposed to
stand for.''

   A 12-foot bronze sculpture of a Blackfoot
Indian chief with outstretched arms welcomes visitors to the
Eiteljorg Museum of American Indian and Western Art. He carries no
weapon, only a feather in his right hand.
   Harrison Eiteljorg would not have it any other way.
   ``In this museum you will not see one battle scene,'' said
Eiteljorg, whose voluminous private collection becomes public when
the museum opens today.
   ``The Indians had a beautiful art or religion, whatever you want
to call it. They worshiped the sun, the rain, their crops and
fields. They never killed except for their own needs. I wanted the
museum to show that. It has a romantic feeling about the western
Indians and their life.''
   The museum's collection of primarily 20th century paintings and
bronzes chronicles the westward movement of American settlers and
the Indians' way of life.
   Eiteljorg's collection is among the best displays of Southwestern
art in the nation, said Dean Krakel, former director of the Cowboy
Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City.
   ``He bought early and he bought well, before the boom in
prices,'' he said.
   The best of the Eiteljorg collection centers on the Taos Ten, a
colony of artists founded by Joseph Henry Sharp that settled in
Taos, N.M.
   From Sharp's colorful oil ``Taos Indians'' to Victor Higgins'
``The Blue Shawl,'' each is a memento of Eiteljorg's many visits to
Taos and the Southwest.
   The collection also includes works by more well-known Western
artists such as Charles M. Russell, Frederic S. Remington and
Georgia O'Keeffe.
   Other artists featured in the museum are Thomas Moran, whose
watercolors were used to lobby Congress to create Yellowstone
National Park, and Alfred Jacob Miller, the earliest known artist to
paint the American fur traders during their heyday.
   Eiteljorg, who studied art at Indiana University and whose
German-born mother was an artist, married the daughter of a southern
Indiana coal company owner and later took over the business.
   The fortune he amassed in coal and real estate allowed him and
his second wife, Sonja, to acquire their vast art holdings. It
includes an impressive collection of African art and costumes, which
will go on permanent display at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in
1990.
   His Western art, however, was too significant to place within
another museum's walls.
   City and state leaders invited Eiteljorg four years ago to build
a museum on the outskirts of White River State Park just west of
downtown Indianapolis. A $12.5 million grant from Lilly Endowment
and $1.5 million from Eiteljorg financed its development and
construction.
   The 25,000 square feet of gallery space house a rotating exhibit
of Eiteljorg's 240 Western paintings, 149 bronzes and 740 Indian
artifacts, mostly from the Southwest, Plains and the Northwest Coast
Indian cultures.
   Michael Duty, the museum's executive director, said his goals
include developing the museum into a repository and research
facility for Woodlands Indians, who once roamed Indiana and
surrounding states.
   ``We must also become spokespersons for trying to protect Indian
burial sites, trying to afford them the kind of respect that I think
they have not always gotten,'' he said.
   Perhaps the museum's most significant contribution is the respect
it demands of Western paintings and sculptures, long considered the
backwater of American art, Duty said.
   ``Western imagery is so pervasive in advertising, movies and
television that people find it hard not to get the two confused,''
he said. ``Western art has a real place in American art.''

   The Supreme Court has left separate messages
for Congress and sexually oriented telephone services. To Congress:
You can't kill dial-a-porn. To the multibillion-dollar industry:
Clean up your act.
   The court's unanimous decision Friday said Congress went too far
last year when it passed a law banning all sexually oriented phone
message services.
   Only obscene messages, not messages that merely are ``indecent,''
may be outlawed, the court said. It said a blanket ban would violate
free-speech rights.
   A phone conversation, like an explicit movie or centerfold in an
adult magazine, may or may not be obscene. That's for a jury to
decide, on a case-by-case basis.
   Material deemed to be indecent, rather than obscene, is protected
under the Constitution.
   The court acknowledged that Congress has a legitimate interest in
preventing children from being exposed to even indecent messages.
But the justices said they are unpersuaded nothing less than a total
ban will prevent kids from gaining access to such messages.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled 5-4 in a Virginia case that states are not obligated to
provide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost an initial round
of appeals.
   _Said, by an 8-1 vote, the Justice Department has a legal
obligation under the Freedom of Information Act to supply a weekly
tax magazine with copies of all federal trial court opinions and
orders in tax cases.
   _Made it more difficult, by a 7-2 vote in an Ohio case, for older
workers to prove their employers are guilty of illegal age bias in
the handling of pensions and other fringe benefits.
   In the dial-a-porn case, the court said the Federal
Communications Commission's effort to use technology to restrict
dial-a-porn messages to adults might work, resulting in ``only a few
of the most enterprising and disobedient young people'' gaining
access to such messages.
   Paul Maurer, a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based National
Coalition Against Pornography, urged people to pressure telephone
companies to drop dial-a-porn services.
   The ruling, Maurer said, ``gives citizens a chance to really
speak out whether they want this stuff in their community.''
   The ruling does not directly affect any state's regulation of the
dial-a-porn business. But state laws deemed too similar to the
federal law could be challenged on the same constitutional grounds.
   The court rejected industry arguments that the disputed law
impermissibly imposes a national standard for what is obscene, based
on ``the least tolerant community.''
   The argument is that a phone message originating in a city such
as New York, which tolerates numerous sexually explicit businesses,
could be prosecuted and judged under the community standards of a
small town in rural America.
   The court said that's a problem with which the dial-a-porn
industry itself must wrestle.
   The court's three most liberal justices in freedom-of-expression
cases _ William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens
_ voted to strike down the federal law even as it applies to obscene
material.
   Dial-a-porn companies make their services available to callers
through 976 exchanges.
   The telephone company typically charges callers according to
per-call rates, retaining a portion of the charges and giving the
rest to the dial-a-porn company.
   The same 976 exchanges also are used for other, non-controversial

<HEAD>Activists Vow New Fight For Civil Rights Legislation</HEAD>

   Activists commemorated the murders 25 years ago
of three young civil rights workers by vowing to fight in their
spirit to strengthen voter registration and reverse the effects of
Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action.
   But relatives of the slain workers said they were disappointed
President Bush did not commit himself to new civil rights
legislation.
   Bush told family members of Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman,
both white New Yorkers, and James Chaney, a black Mississippian,
that the men killed by Ku Klux Klansmen in Philadelphia, Miss., were
``heroes.''
   ``We can erect no greater monument to their memory than to ensure
that the arrogance and bigotry that took their lives never again
exists in America,'' Bush said in a statement released at the White
House.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president is
waiting for a Justice Department review of the new Supreme Court
rulings before making any commitment to action.
   The families were on a bus caravan from Philadelphia, Miss., to
Washington and New York to commemorate the June 21, 1964
disappearance of the men, who had been conducting a black voter
registration drive in Neshoba County.
   Their bullet-riddled bodies were found buried in an earthen dam
near Philadelphia, Miss., and the FBI found that the Ku Klux Klan
had killed them.
   Rita Schwerner-Bender, who was married to Schwerner, told
reporters she was disappointed Bush was noncommittal when they asked
him to back bipartisan legislation ``to deal with the Supreme Court
cases that have so badly eroded civil rights in this country.''
   At a ceremony at the Capitol, she charged the Justice Department,
the Supreme Court and Congress stand in the way of ``a suitable and
fitting memorial'' to those who participated in the civil rights
struggle.
   ``So long as the Justice Department argues before the Supreme
Court for a narrowing of the laws ... so long as the Congress and
the president fail to commit themselves to the needs of the poor,
housing, education, medical assistance there is no honor shown to
the civil rights participants,'' she said.
   Ben Chaney, brother of the slain James Chaney, told about 300
people in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, ``We have to remember they
didn't volunteer to die.''
   ``We need immediate passage of federal legislation that
eliminates all the barriers to voting,'' Chaney said.
   ``This present majority on the Supreme Court is far more
dangerous than Bull Connor with a fire hose,'' said Benjamin Hooks,
executive director of the NAACP, referring to the Birmingham, Ala.,
city official's actions against civil rights demonstrators.
   Hooks also vowed legislative remedies to reverse Supreme Court
rulings. Or, ``we'll have demonstrations that'll make what happen in
China look like child's play,'' he said, raising the threat of
thousands of protestors converging on the capital.

   Actor Kevin Bacon, star of the movie ``She's
Having A Baby,'' has a real-life baby of his own.
   His wife had a healthy 8-pound, 5-ounce boy on Friday.
   Actress Kyra Sedgwick gave birth to Travis Sedg Bacon at 2 a.m.
at an unidentified hospital, said Bacon's spokeswoman, Heidi
Schaeffer.
   Travis is the couple's first child.
   Bacon and Miss Sedgwick were married in September 1988 after
meeting about a year earlier on the set of ``Lemon Sky,'' an
American Playhouse production on PBS.
   Besides ``She's Having A Baby,'' Bacon stars in the recently
released `Criminal Law.'' He also appeared in ``Footloose'' and will

   Attorneys for actor Rob Lowe will ask a federal
judge Monday to dismiss a lawsuit stemming from a sexual videotape
he allegedly made of a teen-age girl in Atlanta.
   Lena Arlene Wilson sued Lowe, contending he enticed her daughter,
Jan Parsons, then 16, into a videotaped encounter with another
woman. The incident occurred last summer, when the Brat Pack star
was in town for the Democratic National Convention.
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.
   U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell scheduled a hearing Monday
on a motion by Lowe's attorneys to dismiss the lawsuit. They also
are seeking to recover court costs from Ms. Wilson and her attorney.
   A motion by Lowe's attorneys denies that he ``has committed any
wrongful acts giving rise to liability.''
   According to published reports and court documents, Miss Parsons
and a friend met Lowe, star of films including ``About Last Night''
and ``St. Elmo's Fire,'' at downtown Atlanta's Rio nightclub during
the convention last July. The reports say they returned to his hotel
suite, where they had sex with him and each other as Lowe taped the
encounter.

   Burghers are going to the polls
this weekend to decide whether Dutch brewery tycoon Alfred H.
Heineken can tear down a 70-year-old villa surrounding his
multimillion-dollar pied-a-terre at this luxury resort.
   Results are expected Sunday.
   The yellow, 71-year-old Villa Boehler has been a thorn in
Heineken's side since he bought a hillside residence in St. Moritz
decades ago. He paid a reported $2.7 million in 1983 to buy the
villa and its grounds.
   But a storm of protest erupted when he asked local authorities to
allow him to tear down the villa and replace it with an annex to his
own place.
   Heineken has said in various interviews that the villa, built for
an Austrian industrialist by renowned German architect Heinrich
Tessenow in 1917, is a ``bunker'' and a ``revolting yellow
monstrosity.''
   Hans Rutishauser, chief curator of monuments of Grisons, the
canton that includes St. Moritz, has said the villa is ``unique and
original'' and should come under official protection.

   Joey Heatherton said she was ``vindicated'' by a
jury ruling that she was negligent, but did not assault or beat a
passport clerk who claimed the entertainer attacked her in 1985.
   The jury Friday assessed Miss Heatherton $20,500 for the year's
salary the clerk lost and her medical bills. The jury refused to
award any money for pain and suffering, emotional distress or
punitive damages.
   Mary Polik sued Miss Heatherton, 44, for $6 million, claiming
that the entertainer ripped out her hair, slapped her and ``banged
and bashed'' her head on a counter top after she told her she had
the wrong photos for a passport and that she needed the $35 fee in
exact change.
   ``I'm very happy,'' Heatherton said. ``I've been vindicated and
I'm glad the situation has been resolved.''
   Polik, 27, also said she was pleased with the verdict. ``No human
being has the right to beat up on another,'' she said.
   Polik said she suffered pinched neck nerves, headaches, dizziness
and nausea following the July 8, 1985, attack.

   An oil tanker hit an offshore rock Friday
afternoon and leaked about 1 million gallons of heating oil into the
Atlantic Ocean, the Coast Guard said.
   The 560-foot tanker World Prodigy, carrying 7.6 million gallons
of No. 2 heating oil, struck a rock at Brenton Reef, immediately
south of Newport, at 4:40 p.m., said Petty Officer Ellen Harrington
of the Coast Guard office in Boston.
   The ship, bound for Providence, was pulled off the rock almost
immediately and anchored nearby. The leak was stopped at about 9:10
p.m., after about 1 million gallons of oil had leaked, Harrington
said.
   The Navy began replacing booms around the ship, which sails under
a Greek flag, with a containment curtain shortly after 10 p.m.
``They'll determine overnight what the immediate environmental
concerns are and place booms around those areas,'' she said.
   Like a boom, the plastic curtain is deployed around the spill,
with its bottom weighted to keep it under water and its top
suspended by buoys to contain the oil.
   Some of the oil was washing up on Castle Hill beaches early
Saturday, said Gov. Edward D. DiPrete.
   He said the ship's captain told him he had made a mistake in not
having a pilot on board and also in plotting the course.
   President Bush sent Environmental Protection Agency Administrator
William Reilly, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and other White
House advisers to the scene early Saturday, and they met DiPrete
shortly after midnight and planned to tour the affected area.
   Arthur Markos, DiPrete's chief of staff, said state officials are
considering legal action, but plan no criminal charges. ``Our bay is
very important to us. We're a very small state,'' he said.
   Michael A. Annarummo, deputy director of the state Department of
Environmental Management, said Coast Guard divers had reported
finding two huge holes in the ship.
   ``There's a long 150-foot knifelike gash and divers are now
talking about a wider gash lower on the ship,'' Annarummo said.
   Annarummo said state officials were confident they had enough
booms to contain the spill, and said it was a lucky that the spill
was heating oil.
   ``It's a light fuel oil,'' Annarummo said. ``The plus of that is
you don't get the heavy staining or coating or adhesion. It breaks
up easier and evaporates.''
   Harrington said the slick was moving east, parallel to the shore
and away from the mouth of Narragansett Bay, but Annarummo said
sensitive wildlife areas in the bay could be in danger by morning.
``That tide's going to change on us,'' he said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or harm to wildlife.
   The Coast Guard said the ship is owned by Ballard Shipping, but
did not know who owns the cargo.
   Brenton Reef, a nautical landmark where America's Cup yacht races
were held for many years, is within sight of the shore and of the
main shipping route into Narragansett Bay. The cause of the accident
was not known, she said.
   Coast Guard Lt. Alan Brown said the spill should be a lot easier
to contain than the crude oil spill that devastated Alaska's Prince
William Sound last winter when the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a rock
near the port of Valdez.
   ``With any luck at all, the seas are calm enough that we'll be
able to boom all around it,'' Brown said. ``Nothing like Alaska
where it got out of hand before anyone was there.''
   Because the site is in the populous Northeast, it will take much
less time to get booms and cleanup equipment into place, he said.
   The odor of the spilled oil wafted through this affluent resort
city. ``Boy, it's enough to knock you off your feet,'' said Rhode
Island Secretary of State Kathleen S. Connell, who lives near the
shore in suburban Middletown.
   The Alaska spill occurred March 23, when the tanker Exxon Valdez
ran aground on Bligh Reef, a well-marked navigation hazard about 25
miles south of Valdez. The 987-foot tanker had just picked up a full
load of 11.3 million gallons of oil at Valdez, the northernmost
ice-free port in the United States and the southern terminus of
Alaska pipeline.
   At one point, the tanker was spilling 20,000 gallons of oil per
hour into pristine Prince William Sound.
   Exxon later fired the tanker's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, after
tests revealed his blood alcohol level was above legal limits more
than nine hours after the accident. He faces criminal charges,
including reckless endangerment, and operating a vessel while drunk.
   Exxon later was criticized because no containment booms were put
around the tanker until more than 11 hours after the wreck.
   Bush initially rejected requests by Alaska officials to
federalize the clean-up efforts, insisting that Exxon could do the
job. But on April 7, he ordered the military to join the clean-up
effort.

<HEAD>U.S.-Japan Agree on Monitoring Pacific Fish Catch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drift-net fishing agreement between the
United States and Japan averted a U.S. embargo of Japanese fishery
imports but sparked criticism in Congress.
   The Commerce Department announced the one-year agreement Friday,
days before a June 29 deadline.
   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., called the pact disappointing. Sen.
Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he had ``serious doubts'' about the
agreement.
   ``It certainly isn't the agreement we were looking for,'' said
Unsoeld, a member of the House Marine and Fisheries Committee. ``I
think our fishermen had hoped for a lot more.''
   ``Piracy of our fish will continue,'' said Rep. John Miller,
R-Wash., also a member of the fisheries panel, pointing to
``evidence of past behavior.''
   The Japanese use the nets for squid. Drift nets are small-mesh
nets that can stretch more than 30 miles long, hanging in the water
and snaring virtually any mammal, bird or fish that comes in
contact. Officials said that on any given day, the nets can cover
more than 30,000 miles of ocean.
   The Commerce Department has said the nets poses a threat to the
marine environment and the West Coast U.S. fishing industry.
   The one-year agreement, confirmed in an exchange of letters
between Commerce and State Department negotiators and the Japan
Fishing Agency, calls for some monitoring of the Japanese fishing
fleet in the North Pacific.
   But Japan is not required to make any commitment about revising
or curtailing its use of drift nets.
   ``This agreement achieves a real commitment, rather than a vague
promise, that major advances in Japanese fleet monitoring and
enforcement will take place on a multi-year basis,'' Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher said in a statement.
   ``If this progress is reflected in results, we will have achieved
an important balance between our fishing trading relationship and
our environmental responsibilities.''
   Greenpeace spokesman Alan Reichman said from Seattle that the
environmental group was concerned that ``this deal simply isn't
going to go far enough in setting the level of observer
participation and other measures that would set a foundation for a
ban in the future.''
   Brian Gorman, spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, said Japan, as recently as last month, was unwilling
to accept any proposal. He said the settlement was hastened by the
threat of trade sanctions against Japan, along with South Korea and
Taiwan, on fishery products imported into the United States.
   The Drift net Act of 1987 gave the commerce secretary until June
29 to reach an agreement.
   Under the agreement, up to four research fishing vessels will be
allowed to accompany Japanese fishing fleets, which consist of about
460 vessels.
   The research vessels _ three from Japan and one from Canada _
will be equipped with transmitters so data can be collected to
determine ``who catches what and where,'' Gorman said.
   Japanese and American observers also will be placed on Japanese
vessels so the location of the vessels can be determined.

passed Friday by the Senate. Changes are likely when the House takes
up the bill.

<BYLINE>SUBSIDIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislation authorizes $1.75 billion in federal subsidies for
child care in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, money that still
must be appropriated. Seventy percent of the money would have to be
used to help parents pay for child care. Twenty-two percent is
earmarked for state programs such as grants to and training of
child-care providers. The remaining 8 percent would be used for
states to administer the programs. States which certified that
availability of child care was more of a problem than affordability
could reduce to 65 percent the amount for parents and increase to 27
percent the amount used on state programs.

<BYLINE>TAX CREDITS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   There are three tax breaks for low-income and moderate-income
families:
   _Child Health Credit. Parents with annual incomes of less than
$12,000 could receive a tax credit of up to $500 to help pay the
cost of health insurance for their children. Families with annual
incomes of $12,000 to $18,000 would get a smaller credit. This
credit would first be available in 1991.
   _Refundable Dependent Care Credit. Beginning in 1992, families
who now are eligible for the existing Dependent Care Tax Credit
could receive 90 percent of their credit up front through monthly
installments in their paychecks. ``Refundable'' means the measure is
designed to provide the money to families who are eligible but do
not get to take advantage of the credit currently because they do
not make enough to owe any federal income taxes against which the
credit would be applied.
   _Supplemental Earned Income Tax Credit. The existing credit would
provide families with annual incomes of less than $10,000 with a
$500 credit for a child under the age of 5 and a $750 credit if they
have two or more eligible children. The credit, available beginning
in 1991, would be phased out for families with annual incomes in the
$10,000-$15,000 range.

   States are encouraged to adopt health and safety standards in
line with guidelines included in the measure. These include
first-aid and other training of child-care providers and inspections
of institutional child-care settings. Immediate family members of

training requirements. Also, Social Security recipients would have
any child-care earnings exempted from outside earnings limitations.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is taking
action to stop airline manufacturers from placing exit doors too far
apart.
   The Association of Flight Attendants praised Friday's order,
which limits doors to within 60 feet apart, saying it will stop
Boeing plans to remove middle doors over the wings of future jumbo
jets.
   But a Boeing spokesman in Seattle, David Jimenez, said the
aircraft builder already has abandoned any plans that would put exit
doors in its planes further than 60 feet apart.
   The FAA said its order will ``hold the line'' on the growth of
distances between airliner exit doors, noting that one unidentified
model was planned with exits more than 80 feet apart.
   The new regulations published in Friday's edition of the Federal
Register take effect in 30 days and apply to ``all newly
manufactured airplanes of older type designs after Oct. 16, 1987,''
when the rule was first proposed, the FAA said.
   The rule also will prevent any modification of existing designs
that would increase the distance between doors beyond 60 feet and
prohibit U.S. airlines from using foreign airplanes that have exit
distances exceeding the new standard, the agency said.
   The FAA said it is forming an advisory committee to set standards
based on how quickly passengers can exit from the doors rather than
on arbitrary distances between doors. The committee is to make
recommendations by July 1991.
   The flight attendants group, in a prepared statement, said
Boeing's plans would have created a 72-foot distance between some of
the plane's exit doors.
   The association had urged Congress to save 747 exits over the
wing, saying ``passengers in many crashes have been unable to reach
exits in post-crash fires.''
   Jimenez said Boeing had planned to remove two of the 10 exit
doors on new 747s but abandoned the plan prior to the FAA order. He
said the new order would not affect any Boeing model.
   Previous FAA rules have required require at least one exit door
for every 55 seats.
   The FAA said all narrow-body airplanes and most wide-body planes
already conform to the new distance limit.

Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A ball bearing manufacturer has agreed to pay
the government $14.3 million to settle claims the company
overcharged the Pentagon, and the Connecticut man who initiated the
charges will get a more than $1 million slice of the settlement.
   The Justice Department said Friday that George G. Butenkoff, a
former regional salesman for Industrial Tectonics Inc. of Dexter,
Mich., will receive $1,427,952.40.
   Under a provision of the False Claims Act, individuals can bring
fraud suits on behalf of themselves and the government and are
entitled to a percentage of any money the government receives.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said Butenkoff's
settlement award is the largest of its type since the law was
revamped in 1986.
   Butenkoff, of East Windsor, Conn., did not return repeated
telephone messages Friday.
   Butenkoff filed suit in November 1985 in U.S. District Court in
Hartford, Conn., accusing Industrial Tectonics of overcharging Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft for ball bearings delivered to the Air Force and
overcharged Westinghouse for bearings used in nuclear reactors by
the Navy. The military received the hardware between 1979 and 1985,
the Justice Department said.
   The government joined the suit in January 1986, and
investigations by Defense Contract Audit Agency supported the
claims, the department said.
   Robert L. Way, a spokesman for Axel Johnson Inc., a New York
company that purchased Industrial Tectonics in December 1982, said
most of the alleged overcharges occurred before the company was sold
and all came before Axel Johnson changed management at the Michigan
plant.
   Way said Butenkoff filed the suit after he was fired, but he
declined to discuss the circumstances around the dismissal.
   Way also said the settlement ``in large part'' comes from the
former owner, whom he declined to identify.
   The Justice Department said other claims against Industrial
Tectonics remain and will be resolved in administrative proceedings.
The department said those claims are expected to bring the
government more than $6 million.
   Way said the company denies the remaining claims.

<HEAD>US Concerned, Cautious On Iran-Moscow Moves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will continue with its
cautious approach towards Iran despite concern about the improvement
in relations between the Moslem fundamentalist nation and the Soviet
Union.
   ``We and others will find it difficult to understand efforts to
move close to a regime that continues to support international
terrorism and hostage-taking,'' State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said.
   ``We are watching closely the evolution of the Soviet
relationship (with Iran),'' she said.
   Iran and the Soviet Union ended almost a decade of chilly
relations by signing a long-term cooperation pact Friday, with the
possibility that an arms deal may follow.
   The pact was signed at the end of a visit to Moscow by the
speaker of Iran's parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani. A communique
issued by both sides said the two nations agreed ``to build and
develop good neighborly relations on the principles of equality.''
   Rafsanjani, the acting commander of Iran's armed forces, is the
highest ranking Iranian official to visit Moscow since the 1979
revolution that crushed the Iranian Communist Party and sent mobs
into the streets shouting ``Death to America, Death to Russia!''
   A senior U.S. official told journalists Friday he thought the
Soviets were ``reverting to type'' in their dealings with Iran.
   The official, who refused to allow his name or title to be used,
explained he believes the Soviet moves harkened back to a tendency
``to try to take advantage of Western governments.''
   The United States severed relations with Iran in 1980, five
months after militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. President
Bush has said Iran must renounce terrorism and help free Americans
held hostage in Lebanon before relations can be resumed.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the House Foreign
Affairs Committee this week the United States is ``concerned about
the possibility of weapons transfers.''
   ``We indicated our concern across the whole spectrum of questions
involving proliferation of missiles and chemical technology,'' Baker
said about his meeting in Moscow last month with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   He said U.S. policy toward Iran would be guided by developments
in that nation, not by Iran's relationship with the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Unisys Suspension Lifted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Unisys Corp. will have to enforce ethical
standards for employees and improve contracting procedures under
terms of a deal with the Navy that caused the service to lift its
suspensions of three units of the defense contractor.
   The lifting of the suspension was announced Friday by the Navy
and involves the bidding rights of Unisys' Shipboard and Ground
Systems Group, the Computer Systems Division and the Communications
Systems Division.
   The Navy issued a statement which said, ``at the time of the
suspension, Unisys had initiated vigorous actions to ensure that
known individuals responsible for the misconduct were removed from
the company and that a disciplined program of self-governance was
put into place to guard against such abuses in the future.''
   ``The company had conducted an internal investigation; had
disciplined a number of individuals; and had adopted new procedures
and controls,'' the service said.
   Unisys was created three years ago by the merger of Sperry Corp.
and Burroughs Corp, a pair of firms whose chief products were
computers.
   Peter Hynes, a Unisys spokesman in Blue Bell, Pa., said the
company is pleased with the decision while discussions relating to
its involvement in the ``Operation Ill Wind'' defense procurement
investigation ``are in progress with the Department of Justice and
the company remains committed to reaching speedy resolution of all
issues relating to that investigation.''
   The ``Ill Wind'' probe includes allegations that private
consultants, hired by defense contractors, bribed Pentagon officials
to obtain inside information that gave companies an edge in securing
contracts.
   Unisys, the nation's 15th largest defense contractor, received
$1.4 billion worth of contracts last year from the Pentagon.
   Charles F. Gardner, former general manager for Unisys'
surveillance and fire control division on Long Island, is awaiting
sentencing next month on his guilty plea to bribery. Gardner has
been cooperating with the investigation.
   Robert D. Barrett, a Washington-based representative, also
pleaded guilty to concealing illegal political donations to former
Rep. Bill Chappell of Florida. Chappell, who died earlier this year,
was never charged.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill Aimed At Circumventing Flag Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, angered over this week's Supreme
Court ruling that burning the American flag is constitutionally
protected free speech, passed legislation aimed at making
desecration of the flag unlawful.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., had the measure tacked onto an
unrelated child care bill late Friday.
   ``I'm confident it's constitutional,'' Biden, chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee and a leading congressional liberal, told
his colleagues.
   The move in the Senate came as several lawmakers introduced
constitutional amendments in the House following the Supreme Court
decision. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said such attempts
should be taken cautiously and that it would ``be extraordinarily
slow to amend the First Amendment to the Constitution,'' which is
``at the heart of our constitutional liberties and freedom.''
   Biden said his simple legislation could accomplish the same aim
as a constitutional amendment.
   The bill reads: ``Whoever knowingly and publicly mutilates,
defaces, burns, displays on the floor or ground, or tramples upon
any flag of the United States shall be fined not more than $1,000 or
imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.''
   Biden's bill is identical to the federal statute on flag
desecration except it removes the words ``cast contempt.''
   The majority Supreme Court opinion reasoned that a Texas statute
on flag desecration violated the First Amendment because it was
aimed at protecting against acts toward the flag which would be
offensive to others. Biden's measure would treat desecration as an
act of vandalism without considering whether anyone was offended by
the act, presumably answering the court's First Amendment concerns.
   The House may consider next week a resolution similar to the one
passed by the Senate this week expressing opposition to the view of
the court.
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, a senior Republican on the House
Judiciary Committee, said he was also exploring ways of getting
around the decision without a constitutional amendment, possibly by
taking away from the Supreme Court jurisdiction over lawsuits on
flag desecration.
   ``I think the mood of the House is to do something effective and
not just pass resolutions condemning the burning of the flag,'' he
said. A new law would be simpler than a constitutional amendment, he
said.

<HEAD>Propaganda Specialist Takes Over China's Leading Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army propaganda specialist has taken over as
editor in chief at the official daily of the Communist Party in a
reshuffling of the newspaper's management, authorities announced
today.
   The replacements at The People's Daily came as the party stepped
up its propaganda campaign to defend the harsh suppression of
pro-democracy activists during a June 3-4 military operation in
which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died.
   The People's Daily is distributed to all offices and work units
throughout China. Its editorials, generally carried in other major
dailies, are regarded as party gospel in this, the world's most
populous country.
   During the past two days, the official press has also announced
arrests of 13 people the government describes as agents of Taiwan
with a mission to stir up anti-Communist sentiments.
   The foreign affairs office of the People's Daily said Shao Huaze,
director of the Propaganda Department of the People's Liberation
Army, had replaced Tan Wenrui as chief editor of China's leading
paper.
   The office also said Qian Liren, director at the daily, had left
his post. He was replaced by Gao Di, a senior official at the
Central Party School of the party Central Committee.
   Bot Qian and Tan resigned because of health reasons, the office
said without elaborating.
   The party has been increasing efforts to brand the activists as
``counterrevolutionaries'' and defend the recent arrests and
executions.
   More than 1,700 people have been arrested and 27 executed since
the nationwide crackdown began almost three weeks ago.
   Hundreds of journalists from all the major national dailies and
broadcasting stations participated in the pro-democracy rallies that
led to the crackdown. For a brief time in late May, the official
press was more independent than it had ever been in history.
   The press quickly reverted to acting as an unquestioning organ
for government and party propaganda after the military drive in
Beijing to quash the democracy movement.
   The Xinhua News Agency has said nearly 100 soldiers and police
died and that thousands were injured in that violence, while about
100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese witnesses
and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been
as high as 3,000.
   In other arrests, evening radio and television broadcasts said
Liu Xiaobo, an instructor at Beijing Normal University who recently
returned from six months in the United States, published
anti-Communist essays overseas and advocated abolition of the
Communists' one-party rule.
   China has denounced the United States for cutting off military
aid in protest of the crackdown.
   Congress has pressured President Bush to take stronger action,
but Bush's limited sanctions won praise from former President
Richard Nixon.
   ``If in our anger we drive China back into the shadows of the
Soviet Union and the oppressive economic system (senior leader) Deng
Xiaoping has tried to reform, those who have died for freedom in
China will truly have died in vain,'' Nixon said in an article
written for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate.
   As president, Nixon reopened the door to China with a visit in
1972.
   In China, the arrests of three more student and worker leaders
were also reported today.
   Authorities in the northeastern city of Jinan also arrested 40
people for joining in protests that rocked the city after the
military assault in Beijing, the People's Daily said.
   A Chinese source in Beijing said night-shift workers were ordered
to carry their identification papers in anticipation of more police
searches for activists. The report suggested police were preparing
another major sweep of arrests.
   There were reports, meanwhile, that the party Central Committee
was in session to formally oust party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang
and Hu Qili, another member of the powerful five-man Politburo
Standing Committee. However, they were impossible to confirm.
   One European diplomat said the meeting had taken place or was
about to convene, and results would be announced on Sunday. Other
sources said senior officials from the provinces were being flown
into a military airport in southern Beijing.
   Zhao has not been seen in public since May 19. It is believed he
opposed Deng's decision to impose martial law in Beijing and use
military force to crush the student demonstrations.
   Hu, who had directed party propaganda, is also believed to have
been pushed out because of his moderate stand.

<HEAD>River Water, Not Champagne Will Christen USS Jefferson City</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The submarine USS Jefferson City will be
christened next year with a bottle of water from the Missouri River
instead of the usual bottle of champagne.
   ``The Missouri River is strong and determined in its course; the
USS Jefferson City will be sent on its course with the strength and
determination symbolized by the Missouri River water,'' Susie
Skelton, wife of Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who will christen the
submarine at its launching next year, said in a statement issued
Friday.
   The Defense Department says no regulations govern what is used to
christen ships, but champagne is most common because of the splash
and foam when the bottle breaks. Government historians told
Skelton's office that river water was used in 1858, when a bottle of
Connecticut River water was smashed over the bow of the steam sloop
USS Hartford.
   The launching of the submarine Jefferson City, tentatively set
for June 1990, will take place in Newport News, Va., where it is
being built.

   Eleven senators will visit Geneva and Vienna
next week to observe US-Soviet arms control negotiations on nuclear,
chemical and conventional weapons.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who is leading the delegation, said
Friday the delegation intends to remind Soviet negotiators in Geneva
and Vienna ``that the Senate will need to be confident that we can
prevent cheating in any successful treaty.''
   Lugar is co-chairman of the U.S. Senate Arms Control Observer
Group, which has monitored arms control negotiations since 1985. The
delegation was planning to leave as early as today, depending on
when the Senate could finish its business.
   The delegation will discuss strategic nuclear weapons at the
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks and examine prospects for eliminating
chemical weapons at the Conference on Disarmament, both in Geneva.
They will then spend two days at the conventional weapons talks in
Vienna before returning to Washington on June 30.
   Members of the observer group are Lugar, and Sens. Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee;
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.;
Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.; Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md.; John Warner,

<TEXT>
   The Navy improperly restricted competition on a
$30 million computer contract by setting specifications that only
allowed International Business Machines Corp. to bid, says a
congressional watchdog agency.
   The General Accounting Office found that the service, in a rush
to meet a December 1988 deadline, violated federal regulations when
it specified IBM hardware and related equipment in soliciting for a
payroll computer system.
   The Competition in Contracting Act and the Federal Acquisition
Regulation require that procurement specifications state only the
government's actual needs and promote open competition.
   The GAO also found that the Navy received a system design that
did not meet its payroll needs.
   Lt. Greg Smith, a Navy spokesman, said the service would reserve
comment on the report until it saw a copy.

   As Chinese students mounted pro-democracy
protests in Beijing this spring, a government spokesman called a New
York group an instigator of the movement.
   ``The student demonstrations have two backstage directors: Fang
Lizhi and China Spring,'' State Council spokesman Yuan Mu was quoted
as saying in the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily.
   Both ``directors'' are doing little directing now, though.
   Fang, China's best-known dissident, has taken refuge in the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing. And China Spring, the U.S.-based exile group at
the forefront of the Chinese democracy movement the last six years,
has been racked by internal strife.
   The turmoil, in fact, climaxed this spring, blunting its impact
during the crucial moment in Chinese history.
   Since January, China Spring has taken its founder, Wang
Bingzhang, to court over bank transactions. The rift has kept China
Spring on the sidelines during the student protests that culminated
June 3-4 in Tiananmen Square.
   Founded by Wang in 1983, the group has been dogged by controversy
throughout its existence. Members of the Standing Committee often
change, and critics frequently accuse it of accepting funds from
Taiwan's ruling party, the Kuomintang.
   Yet, China Spring used an underground network of supporters in
China to smuggle out manuscripts by Fang and some of China's leading
political prisoners, giving the group stature. At its zenith, China
Spring claimed 50 branches on five continents.
   China Spring favors non-violent means to ``promote democracy and
improve human rights conditions in China with the ultimate goal of
transforming the totalitarian system into a democratic one,'' Wang
wrote in the group's magazine.
   Even supporters-turned-opponents credit Wang with having the
foresight to envision a grass-roots democracy movement in China.
   ``Wang is history. I give him credit for starting the movement,
but I think he finished his mission,'' says Feng Shengping, a new
leader of China Spring. Wang was expelled from the Standing
Committee last January. In a statement, China Spring said he
``seriously mixed up his public and private financial affairs.''
   In February, Wang struck back, taking out a full-page ad in World
Journal, the New York-based, Chinese-language newspaper. He denied
financial wrongdoing, and labeled two China Spring leaders as
``secret Chinese Communist Party members and Ministry of State
Security agents.'' Both men denied the accusation.
   China Spring won a temporary restraining order in March barring
Wang from withdrawing $73,000 he had moved from the group's savings
account to a separate account.
   In April, Wang's supporters broke away, forming a new faction
called the Chinese Democratic Party.
   Wang hopes relations can be improved among members.
   China Spring is holding a convention in Los Angeles, and more
than a hundred people are expected to attend. Wang left New York
Friday to attend the convention and said he hopes the convention
will lead toward reconciliation.

<HEAD>Cardinal Manning Dead at 79 of Spinal Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH COTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Timothy Manning, a champion of the
poor and oppressed during his 15 years as Roman Catholic archbishop
of Los Angeles, has died of spinal cancer at 79.
   He died Friday at the Norris Cancer Hospital of the University of
Southern California, said A.J. Antczak, managing editor of The
Tidings, the diocesan newspaper.
   Manning's successor, Archbishop Roger Mahony, was at Manning's
side when he died. ``We were praying the litany of saints when he
peacefully slipped away,'' Mahony said.
   Mahony, who compared Manning's life to that of Father Junipero
Serra, the 18th century priest who founded the missions in
California, said it was as if ``we were just adding his name to that
long list of heroic and saintly men and women to whom we commended
his spirit.''
   A native of Ireland, Manning arrived in the United States in
1928. Although he retired as archbishop in 1985, he observed the
55th anniversary of his ordination as a priest on Friday, Antczak
said.
   Manning was ``a man of great strength, courage and compassion,''
former President Reagan said in a statement. ``He enriched the life
of thousands who are better because of his good work.''
   Mayor Tom Bradley ordered flags at city buildings flown at
half-staff in Manning's honor.
   Manning, after serving two years as a bishop in Fresno, became
archbishop in 1970, taking over from Cardinal James Francis
McIntyre, whose final years in Los Angeles were filled with discord.
   In 1970, minority Catholics complained of alienation weekly
during protests in front of St. Basil's Catholic Church.
   Young priests and nuns often found themselves at odds with the
hierarchy and quietly referred to the chancery as ``the fortress.''
   Manning moved his residence to St. Vibiana's Church in the skid
row section of Los Angeles. He established ministries for blacks and
Hispanics and began a Priests' Senate to give the clergy greater
say. An Inter-Parochial Council extended the participation to the
parish level.
   Manning also visited with local Protestant and Jewish
congregations.
   He assured Vietnam war protesters they could declare themselves
conscientious objectors and often spoke against the nuclear arms
race, saying in 1981: ``The cry of the poor for bread has been
answered by warheads.''
   In 1983, he petitioned then Secretary of State George Shultz to
halt the deportation of Salvadoran refugees.
   His social liberalism was matched by a theological conservatism.
He denounced abortion as murder and announced that any Catholic who
cooperated in an abortion would be excommunicated from the church.
   Bishop John Ward, who served as Manning's auxiliary bishop, said
of Manning: ``He was an outstanding, princely gentleman, the perfect
priest who was devoted to his work with priests and people alike.''
   After ordination in 1934, he went to Rome for postgraduate
studies at the Gregorian Institute in Rome. He received a doctor of
canon law degree in 1938.
   He was named an auxiliary bishop in 1946 and consecrated a full
bishop the same year. Two years later he was made chancellor in Los
Angeles and in 1955 he was made vicar general. In 1967 he was
appointed bishop of Fresno.
   In 1973, Pope Paul VI elevated Manning to the College of
Cardinals.
   A Mass of Christian burial will be celebrated Wednesday morning
and throughout the day his remains will lie in state.
   More than 100 bishops from around the globe were expected to
gather Thursday morning for another Mass of Christian burial and
burial will follow.

   The Seabrook nuclear power plant has
suspended low-power testing indefinitely after federal regulators
shut down the reactor because of a malfunctioning valve.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., a leading Seabrook opponent, said
Friday that top Nuclear Regulatory Commission regional officials
told him an NRC official had to grab a control room operator to get
him to shut down the reactor Thursday.
   ``What we have here is a situation where the Seabrook reactor
operators were not able to follow their own procedures, and an NRC
official in the control room, first having given a verbal
instruction, had to physically grab one of the Seabrook operators to
ensure that procedures would be followed to shut the plant down
immediately,'' Markey said in a telephone interview.
   ``That didn't happen,'' Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams said.
   Williams said operators already were aware of the problem when
the NRC official spoke up, and three minutes later decided to shut
down the reactor. No one was grabbed, he said.
   The commission believes operators waited ``several minutes'' too
long before shutting down the reactor at 12:36 p.m. Thursday, plant
executive Edward Brown said in a statement.
   ``We did not strictly adhere to our test procedures'' in response
to temperature and pressure changes in various systems, Brown said.
   ``At no time was there a risk to plant systems or the general
public,'' Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said.
   NRC spokesman Frank Ingram said Seabrook's low-level testing
license is not affected by the incident, and the commission ``won't
say (operators) made a mistake.''
   Ingram said Brown agreed that the plant will delay resumption of
low-power tests until operators pinpoint why the valve malfunctioned
in the non-nuclear area, make any necessary repairs, and review the
actions with NRC staff.
   Ingram said he had no idea how long the process would take.
   A decade behind schedule, the bitterly contested plant won
permission to conduct low-power tests earlier this month. The tests
began June 13 and had been running smoothly.
   Dianne Dunfey, a member of the anti-Seabrook Clamshell Alliance,
said her group thinks the situation is more serious than Seabrook or
federal officials have said.
   ``Our feeling is that for the NRC, characteristically
irresponsible in their handling of problems of this nature, to take
this step ... indicates a very serious breach by operators,'' Dunfey
said.
   Gov. Judd Gregg said he was undisturbed by the situation.
   ``It is also reassuring to know that the NRC is taking the
necessary steps to ensure safe operations if appropriate procedures
at the plant were not followed,'' he said.

   A jury has sentenced a woman convicted of
killing a couple to steal their 9-day-old son to life in prison
without probation or parole.
   Joyce Lynch dropped her head and cried Friday when the verdict
was read.
   Mrs. Lynch, who could have been sentenced to death, was convicted
of killing Joseph and Beverly Gibson, snatching their infant son,
Matthew, and trying to pass him off as her own.
   The Kent County Superior Court jury deliberated less than an hour
before reaching the verdict.
   Mrs. Lynch, 36, and her husband, Richard, 27, named the infant
Richard Lynch III and showed him off to friends and family like
proud, new parents, according to the prosecution.
   Lynch also is charged in the 1987 slayings and is scheduled for
trial in September. The Lynches have accused each other in the
crimes.
   Mrs. Lynch, convicted Thursday, will not be formally sentenced
until her husband's trial is over, according to Deputy Attorney
General Ferris Wharton. The state had sought the death penalty for
Mrs. Lynch.
   ``I didn't feel as if she got what she deserved. I think she
should have gotten the death sentence,'' said Barbara Staats, Mrs.
Gibson's aunt.
   The Rev. Kenneth Valentine, spokesman for Mrs. Gibson's parents,
said the family was disappointed in the jury's decision.
   In arguing for Mrs. Lynch's life, public defender Duane Werb told
the jury that if they sentenced her to prison, ``she will be in a
place where she can harm no one.''

   Gunmen shot and killed a Roman
Catholic bartender early today after smashing down the front door of
his home with sledgehammers, police said.
   At least three gunmen took part in the attack in Lisburn, 8 miles
southwest of Belfast, said police Sgt. Margaret Breakey. They
tracked down Liam McKee in an upstairs bedroom and one of them
fatally shot the 36-year-old in the chest, she said.
   The victim's mother and brother, who also were in the house, were
not injured, police said.
   The attackers escaped in a car that was later found abandoned a
mile away in the village of Ballinderry, she said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, which authorities
said bore the hllmarks of a sectarian attack by militant Protestants.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in 20 years of political
and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Protestants outnumber
Catholics by a 3-to-2 margin in the British province.

Teen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Ku Klux Klansman has been sentenced
to life in prison for the slaying of a black teen-ager who was
abducted at random and tortured.
   Circuit Judge Michael Zoghby gave Benjamin Franklin Cox Jr. the
maximum prison sentence Friday, calling the 1981 beating and hanging
death of a 19-year-old Michael Donald, ``a heinous, senseless
killing.''
   ``The punishment should fit the crime,'' he said.
   Cox, a 28-year-old truck driver, was convicted of murder May 18
as an accomplice in the Donald killing. Another Klansman was
convicted of murder earlier and sentenced to death; a third pleaded
guilty to federal civil rights charges and became a prosecution
witness. A fourth awaits trial.
   A lawsuit stemming from Donald's death resulted in a landmark
judgment that bankrupted one Klan organization, the United Klans of
America. The $7 million judgment was assessed by a federal court
jury in a lawsuit filed by Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald. She
died last year.
   Donald was chosen at random from a city street and slain in a KKK
revenge plot on March 21, 1981, according to testimony.
   Cox was charged with providing the rope, giving permission to
another Klansman to provide the .22-caliber pistol used in Donald's
abduction and then later viewing the body in a car trunk.
   At Friday's hearing, defense attorneys presented 15 character
witnesses, including the defendant's parents.
   ``I'll never believe he was involved in the death of Michael
Donald,'' Cox's mother, Sarah Cox, said in an appeal for mercy.
   The defendant buried his face in a handkerchief and wept during
much of the testimony from friends, family and his neighbors in
Wilmer, a small community outside Mobile.
   Defense attorney Neil Hanley said he would appeal the conviction
and sentence. He told the judge Cox was a ``model father, a model
citizen, who has led an exemplary life.''
   Although Cox did not participate in the killing and had no prior
criminal convictions, District Attorney Chris Galanos said to place
him on probation ``would be a sham, and a slap in the face of every
black human being in this country.''
   Zoghby said he understood that Cox's role was ``limited,'' but,
he said: ``The whole incident itself was a heinous, senseless crime
that bespeaks of a page in history best to be put behind us, never
to be repeated again.''
   In a final bid for mercy, Cox told the judge, ``Sir, I'd just
like to say I'm not guilty of murder.''
   Handcuffed and led away by deputies, Cox kissed his wife, Gail.
His mother collapsed in her husband's arms, crying, ``Oh, God.''
   According to testimony, the killing was the result of a KKK
meeting on March 18, 1981, where killing a black was suggested.
Local Klansmen were angered over a mistrial in the case of a black
man charged in the slaying of a white Birmingham police sergeant.

<HEAD>Sales of Trigger Locks Soar In Anticipation Of New Gun Law</HEAD>

   Gun shop operators are having trouble keeping gun
locks and safety boxes in stock following passage of a bill that
could send adults to jail for leaving guns within children's reach.
   The Florida Legislature was called into special session this week
after a string of accidental shootings left three children dead. The
shootings reversed long-standing opposition to toughening the
state's liberal gun laws.
   ``We used to sell maybe four or five trigger locks for every 100
guns,'' said Ray Ribas, assistant manager at Tamiami Gun and Range
Shops in Miami. ``Now it seems everyone wants one.''
   Gun locks work by immobilizing the trigger. Some consist only of
plastic straps, while lock-and-key units sell for $8 to $12. Some
gun owners are opting for more costly vaults with a key or
combination lock.
   ``There's a whole new awareness about guns, and that can only
lead to less accidents,'' said Ribas.
   WJNO-AM in West Palm Beach distributed more than 500 gun locks
free last week at two shopping malls.
   ``People have been calling the station asking where they can get
more,'' said WJNO producer Rebecca Wynne. ``People are very aware of
the new law.''
   Southern Gun and Tackle, a Florida-based nationwide gun
distributor, said gun lock orders have more than doubled in the past
month.
   ``We've proposed to the dealers that they offer the lock with
every gun they sell,'' said Al Russell, manager of the company's
purchasing department.
   Under the statute, gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons
in homes or businesses could face a third-degree felony charge if a
child 15 years old or younger shoots someone. The charge carries a
maximum prison sentence of five years and a $5,000 fine.
   Lesser penalties would apply if the child brandishes the gun in
public or threatens others with the weapon.
   The bill was drafted with the help of the National Rifle
Association and would take effect Oct. 1 once signed by Gov. Bob
Martinez. Police officers and military personnel are exempted as are
cases in which the guns were obtained illegally, such as a burglary.
   A call for similar gun-control action was made Friday by
Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Scott McCallum following shootings involving
children in that state.
   Master Lock Co., one of the nation's largest gun lock makers,
distributes 220,000 to 250,000 locks each year, said spokesman Tom
Campbell at the company's Milwaukee headquarters. He said sales were
increasing.
   ``Unfortunately, sales increases often follow catastrophes such
as accidental shootings,'' he said.
   ``I've always encouraged my customers to buy trigger locks. It
took killings to convince some people they are really needed,'' said
Buddy Cook, manager of Gunrunner Inc. in Tallahassee.
   At Wain Roberts Firearms in St. Petersburg, clerk Darin Paulton
said a case of 24 trigger locks used to last about six months.
   ``We've sold four cases since word of the law first came out,''
he said. ``These things sold very sparingly before. Now, they are
really moving.''

   Singer Hibari Misora, who symbolized Japan's postwar
recovery to millions of Japanese, died of heart failure this morning
after a lengthy illness. She was 52.
   The death of the woman some compared to the famed French singer
Edith Piaf topped the morning news, and television broadcasts were
filled with pictures of weeping fans and hundreds of reporters
crowding around her house.
   National television networks made plans to interrupt normal
programming this evening to broadcast special retrospective shows.
Within hours of her death, producers and critics dressed in black
funeral wear solemnly discussed her career on talk shows.
   ``It's a party's over kind of feeling,'' said music critic Toyo
Nakamura in a four-page special on Ms. Misora in the Asahi Shimbun
newspaper.
   Ms. Misora was a source of strength for many Japanese hopeless
and depressed after Japan's disastrous defeat in World War II, Masao
Yamaguchi, a professor at Tokyo Foreign Language University, told
Kyodo News Service.
   From her days as a child performer, her songs and popular image
cheered people and helped prompt Japan's recovery and economic
growth in the postwar era, he said.
   She had lost popularity in recent years as Japan's became a world
power, and people no longer seemed to need her, Yamaguchi said.
   Ms. Misora, a Yokohama fishmonger's daughter, made her singing
debut at age 11 in 1948. She was later celebrated for her renditions
of melancholy ballads such as ``Kanashii Sake'' (Sad Rice Wine) and
``Ringo Oiwake'' (Song of Apples).
   The Mainichi Shimbun newspaper said she was ``the queen of
singers until the end of her life,'' and that ``nothing else but her
death could be so shocking to many Japanese hearts.''
   Ms. Misora was born as Kazue Kato. Her stage name means ``skylark
beautiful sky.''
   She performed in the United States, including Hawaii, in 1950,
when she was 13. She ended her 40-year career with a 10-hour live
radio show by Nippon Broadcasting Co. on March 21, shortly before
she was hospitalized at Juntendo.
   Ms. Misora released 1,200 songs and sold 68 million records,
including 45 million singles. She received numerous musical awards
and was also known as an actress in many Japanese musical movies and
plays.
   She married actor Akira Kobayashi in 1962, but they divorced two
years later.
   Two years ago, she was hospitalized for four months in Fukuoka to
treat chronic hepatitis and a hip bone ailment.
   Since March, she had been hospitalized at Juntendo University
Hospital in Tokyo, where pneumonia contributed to her heart failure.
   A private funeral is scheduled for Monday, according to Columbia
Records, her record label. The public funeral will be held July 22.

<HEAD>Pittston Rejects Mediation Offer to Mediate Coal Miners' Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Pittston Coal Group Inc. has
rejected an offer by the governor to mediate negotiations in an
attempt to end the 2{-month-old United Mine Workers strike.
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton issued the invitation Friday
to UMW President Richard Trumka and Paul Douglas, head of Pittston
Coal Group's parent company, to mediate the strike talks.
   The UMW accepted the offer within hours of Caperton's speech at a
National Coal Association meeting, but Douglas declined the
invitation Friday night, asking the governor instead to urge UMW
leaders to halt the strike.
   Douglas said Pittston could not accept a condition Caperton had
set for the talks at his mansion. The governor had asked coal
companies to promise not to ship coal for Pittston while it is
engaged in the negotiations.
   ``Such interference with business relationships can play no
constructive role in any attempt to resolve the dispute, and is, in
fact, counterproductive,'' Douglas said.
   Douglas also said collective bargaining mediated by the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service, from which the UMW withdrew June
7, was the proper forum for resolving the strike.
   Caperton set three other conditions for the talks _ that both
sides negotiate in good faith, that more than 44,000 miners in 10
states end wildcat strikes and that legal action against the union
be dropped.
   ``The UMWA welcomes Gov. Caperton's offer to play a positive role
in ending this dispute,'' Trumka said. ``As I have repeatedly said,
I am ready to go anywhere at any time to meet with Paul Douglas and
his management team to negotiate a mutually beneficial end to the
union's dispute with Pittston.''
   About 1,900 UMW workers in Virginia and West Virginia went on
strike against Pittston on April 5 when the company imposed a
contract after 14 months of fruitless negotiations. It requires
overtime and Sunday work and cuts medical benefits to retirees.
   After a June 11 rally at the West Virginia Capitol, which
Caperton attended, wildcat strikes began spreading through coal
country, idling 44,000 workers in 10 states.
   The walkout continued mostly unabated Friday, despite several
companies winning back-to-work court orders against UMW members
whose contracts forbid sympathy strikes.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp in Charleston postponed separate
hearings for five companies who asked that the UMW and its members
be held in contempt for ignoring back-to-work orders.
   Union lawyer Chuck Donnelly said the judge suggested the
postponement because of the logistical problems of 18 separate
hearings in one day and indicated he wanted to give the UMW and
Pittston time to consider Caperton's proposal.
   A federal court in Virginia's Western District issued an order
Friday finding UMW members at Island Creek operations there in
contempt for defying a back-to-work order. Any union member who
ignores the court's order and fails to report to work beginning
Monday will be fined $100 a day.
   A federal judge in Indiana signed an order Friday directing UMW
leaders to appear at a hearing next week to answer contempt charges
for refusing an order to return to work.
   Back-to-work orders also are being sought by companies in Alabama
and Pennsylvania, and Consolidation Coal Co. has said it plans to
seek similar legal action in Illinois and Ohio.
   About 100 miners returned to work in St. Clairsville, Ohio, and
no new walkouts were reported Friday.
   In Johnstown, Pa., roving pickets turned away about 600 United
Steelworkers members at a Bethlehem Steel Corp. plant that makes
railroad coal cars, the company said. Bethlehem Steel owns
BethEnergy Mines.
   The estimated number of miners involved in unauthorized walkouts,
according to union and industry officials, are: West Virginia
16,000; Illinois, 8,500; Pennsylvania, 6,900; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio,
2,560; Kentucky, 2,325; Indiana, 1,750; Virginia, 755; Missouri,
350; and Tennessee, 200.

   Michel Aflaq, the founding leader of Iraq's ruling
Baath party, has died in a Paris hospital. He was 79.
   Aflaq died Friday night after heart surgery on June 10, the Iraqi
Embassy said.
   A statement issued by the Arab Baath Socialist Party in Iraq said
Aflaq, who was born a Greek Orthodox in Syria, had converted to
Islam but did not want it known until after his death.
   Iraqi radio cut its regular programs and started broadcasting
Koranic verses after the announcement of his death was made in
Baghdad.
   He founded the party in 1947 with the late Salah Bitar as a
secular party advocating Arab unity and non-communist socialism.
   Aflaq was in and out of jail in the early 1950's as the party
struggled for influence in Syria. It took control there in 1963 in a
bloody coup.
   Factional fighting forced Aflaq to go underground in 1966 and
flee Syria. However, the party seized power the same year in Iraq,
and Aflaq was appointed secretary general. He worked out of Beirut,
Lebanon, but moved to Baghdad after civil war in Lebanon broke out
in 1975.
   He is expected to be succeeded by President Saddam Hussein as
general secretary.
   The Iraqi Baath party is now a bitter rival of the Syrian party.
   The party statement said Aflaq's body will be flown to Baghdad
for burial Monday. He is survived by a daughter and three sons.

   Immigration officials will let 78
Vietnamese refugees stay temporarily in South Korea after they
burned their vessel at sea to force authorities to take them ashore,
news reports said.
   The officials initially said the Vietnamese would be given a new
boat and towed back out to sea, the reports said Friday. But they
later decided the 45 men and 33 women could stay on Sangdo Island
off the south coast until their burned boat is repaired, the reports
said.
   The boat people burned their boat at sea on June 17.
   South Korea says its only refugee camp is already overcrowded and
the boat people cannot stay. The government said 1,057 Vietnamese
boat people have been resettled in third countries since the 1975
communist takeover in Vietnam. But 219 are awaiting resettlement.
   Local villagers have also objected to the presence of the
newcomers. About 100 villagers in 16 fishing vessels blocked patrol
boats carrying the refugees for five hours Thursday in an effort to
prevent them from landing, according to Yonhap, the South Korean
news agency.
   It said the villagers called off the protest after immigration
officials promised the Vietnamese stay would be limited to 30 days.
   The refugees were given five tents, 10 boxes of instant noodles,
rice, medicine, T-shirts, pants, towels and soap, Yonhap said.

   The Who, one of rock's most popular and enduring
groups, played before 48,000 fans in unusually humid Canadian
weather in its first stadium appearance since 1985.
   The three-hour show Friday at CNE Stadium came two days after the
group began its North American summer tour at an arena in Glens
Falls, N.Y. Among the songs best received by the audience Friday
night was ``My Generation'' and ``Substitute.''
   The current Who tour is billed as a 25th anniversary celebration
for the group. Tickets for their Toronto show _ there was no opening
act _ were $30, and souvenir Who sweatshirts were hawked for $40.
   Friday's appearance began on a playful note, with singer Roger
Daltrey and guitarist Pete Townshend galloping on stage to the theme
song from the TV series ``Bonanza.'' It ended with the group's
rendition of ``Summertime Blues.''
   Later Who shows are scheduled again tonight in Toronto, in August
in Vancouver and throughout this summer in the United States.

   Senate passage of an unprecedented child-care
package sends the debate to the House, where Republicans and the
Bush administration promise to fight anew for a plan without the
billion-dollar subsidies being pushed by Democrats.
   ``We've made a significant step toward providing affordable, safe
care for American children and equal economic opportunity for
American women,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
said Friday just before the measure passed on a voice vote.
   With $1.75 billion in direct subsidies for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 and more than $2 billion a year in tax credits, the
Senate package represents the greatest government effort ever to
address child-care needs of working parents and its first major
effort since an emergency plan adopted during World War II.
   Action on child care is expected to accelerate in the House next
week, and Republicans vowed to fight for legislation far different
from the Senate's plan.

   The Erotic Department Store remains open for
business today, its supposedly ``sizzling'' saleswomen talking sex
by phone under no less an authority than the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Their tape-recorded portrayals of sexual encounters _ part of a
multibillion-dollar business known as dial-a-porn _ were ruled
constitutional, within some restrictions, by a unanimous high court
Friday.
   The decision, based on the First Amendment guarantee of free
speech, rejected a federal law that sought to ban telephone
pornography outright. Obscene messages can be banned, the court
said, but simply ``indecent'' ones cannot.
   ``It's fantastic. The First Amendment will not be put down,''
said Gloria Leonard, publisher of the sex magazine High Society and
a leading dial-a-porn entrepreneur. ``We feel very triumphant.''

   But she warns that while overall public confidence in the program
is justifiably high, policies using Social Security Trust Funds to
underwrite other government programs and reduce the federal budget
deficit are ``fueling a lack of confidence'' in the program by
younger workers.
   ``Social Security continues to be misunderstood, by

   Congressional leaders say newly declassified
Pentagon figures on the cost of the B-2 stealth bomber bolster their
argument against spending for the costly program.
   ``The Department of Defense has produced a B-2 program that won't
fly financially,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, said Friday after the estimates were
released.
   ``Members of Congress are balking at spending $4.1 billion this
year for SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative),'' he said.
   ``It is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much per
year on a plane.''
   According to the Pentagon, the radar-evading plane will cost
about $24 billion over a three-year peak spending period. The
estimated cost for the bomber in fiscal 1990 is $4.7 billion,
including $2 billion in research, development, testing and
evaluation and $2.7 billion in production.

<HEAD>Quincy, Mass., Halves Dropout Rate by Tailoring School to Students'
Needs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The dropout rate was halved after this
Boston suburb's officials lavished attention on potential dropouts,
offering day-care centers, vocational training for the disabled and
night classes for working teens.
   ``The secret is, a kid can't drop out without going through a
long program of help-providers,'' said Schools Superintendent Robert
Ricci on Friday. ``It's nothing that hasn't been done. But most
districts aren't that flexible. There's a blueprint here for urban
districts.''
   Ricci calculated the dropout rate by following a group of
students from ninth grade through the day they should graduate. The
traditional method is to compare senior classes from year to year.
By tracking ninth-graders, the schools can more accurately assess
whether programs are working, experts said.
   In Quincy, they apparently work.
   The 1987-88 class graduating lost 19.7 percent of its students.
This year's graduating class was down by just 10.9 percent, a loss
of 70 students out of 643 potential graduates.
   The success in retaining students came from a simple formula.
Said Ricci: ``They get a lot of attention and a lot of
alternatives.''
   Any eighth-graders thought to be potential dropouts receive
special counseling to help them make the transition to high school.
This is followed up through their ninth grade school year.
   Potential dropouts are usually a year or more older than their
classmates; behind in basic skill levels; or from families that are
poorly educated, school officials said.
   Quincy offers schooling for teen-age mothers by providing day
care for their babies, and vocational training for the disabled.
   The school schedule can be adjusted to the student's needs,
including part-time work combined with courses for credit at a
junior college or in Cambridge at the Harvard University extension
program.
   Students can work during the day and study for a general
equivalency diploma, or a GED, at night.
   If these inducements don't work, and a student is determined to
drop out, he is encouraged to take the GED exam. If he passes, he
can receive his diploma on graduation day. If not, he can take
courses to help him pass.
   Quincy is a largely blue-collar city of 89,000 people just south
of Boston. Its public schools serve 8,000 youngsters. The district
consists of two high schools and one vocational school. The program
was developed through policy changes and some reorginzation,
resulting in no significant budget increase.
   The Quincy results drew applause Friday from others concerned
with dropout prevention.
   Brandeis University professor Andrew Hahn, a labor market
specialist concerned with the problems of urban education, praised
the Quincy program.
   ``The dropout problem is something a lot of people are dealing
with. When you lose half your ninth-grade class in some of our
nation's largest cities, your community is going to suffer,'' Hahn
said. ``The best drop-out prevention program has the top
administrators involved. What is so notable (about Quincy) is that
the superintendent is so passionate about it.''
   In major cities the attrition rate can be 40 percent to 60
percent, school officials said.
   Halving a dropout rate is impressive, said Michele Cahill of the
Academy for Educational Development, an international educational
consulting firm in New York City that works with more than 40 urban
school districts on dropout prevention.
   ``What it seems like they're doing, that they've put in a really
good exit intervention,'' Ms. Cahill said.
   She said researchers are finding that it's the ``comprehensive''
programs that work.

   Showers and thunderstorms dampened much of the East and South
today, causing flood warnings or watches to be posted in various
areas.
   Flood warnings because of recent heavy rainfall were posted in
parts of western New York, and a break in a beaver dam caused part
of a road to be washed out at Otsego, N.Y.
   Threats of locally heavy rain from thunderstorms associated with
a weak tropical disturbance led to flood watches in southeast Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms lingered this morning in southern New
England, eastern New York, eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Maryland, central Arkansas, Florida and the Louisiana and Texas
coasts.
   North-central Oklahoma, south-central Kansas, northwest Colorado,
Wyoming and parts of Montana also were dampened by showers and
thunderstorms.
   In Alabama, Dallas County officials were preparing for the
possible evacuation of 100 families today with the expected cresting
of the Alabama River after more than a week of steady rainfall. The
river was expected to crest this afternoon at 49 feet, four feet
above flood stage.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in the central Appalachians, the middle and southern Atlantic Coast,
much of the Gulf Coast and the southern Plains; and showers and
thunderstorms in northern parts of the Rockies and Plains and the
upper Mississippi and lower Missouri valleys.
   Predicted highs: 50s and 60s in the northern Rockies and western
parts of the northern Plains; 90s in the eastern half of the Gulf
Coast, the Tennessee Valley, southwest Texas, the southern Plains
and the interior valleys of California; 100s in the desert
Southwest; and 70s and 80s elsewhere.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 38 degrees at
Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to 90 at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Zhao Ziyang Pushed for Reforms, Brought Style to Chinese Leadership</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zhao Ziyang moved into the political spotlight as
a disciple of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, successfully installing
economic reforms in Sichuan Province and bringing a progressive
style to the Chinese leadership.
   But with his ouster today as general secretary of the Communist
Party, Zhao ended up with the same fate as his predecessor _
stripped of power and disgraced for sympathizing with students
seeking democratic reforms.
   In his tailored Western suits, Zhao once represented the
emergence of a new brand of leader in China, a change from the
revolutionary heroes who founded the communist state in 1949 to a
new generation showing more interest in economic results than
Marxist ideology.
   Zhao, 69, took over as acting Communist Party chief in January
1987 after the ouster of Hu Yaobang, who also was considered too
sympathetic to student protesters calling for political reforms.
Nine months later, Zhao formally was named party chief.
   Hu's death on April 15 set off the student demonstrations in
Beijing. Now Zhao too has fallen from favor after showing support
for some of the demands of students and opposing the decision to
declare martial law in the capital. Zhao has not been seen in public
since May 19, a day before martial law was imposed.
   While tens of thousands of students occupied Tiananmen Square
last month, Zhao told visiting Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that
Chinese people could enjoy ``genuine democracy'' under the 47
million-member Communist Party. He also said political and economic
reform should proceed at an equal pace.
   Like Deng, Zhao was purged during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, accused of being a capitalist sympathizer. In 1967 he
was dragged from his home in the southern city of Canton (Guangzhou)
and paraded through the streets with a dunce cap on his head.
   But he came out of the internal exile that followed to
energetically carry out Deng's market-oriented reforms, measures
designed to rebuild and modernize a country that had fallen apart
during the extreme leftism and repression of the Cultural Revolution.
   In 1975, Zhao became governor of Sichuan, the country's most
populous province. He dismantled communes and allowed peasants to
till private plots.
   The reforms ended food shortages that had people at the brink of
starvation. Under Zhao, the central province harvested bumper yields.
   Deng brought Zhao to Beijing in 1980 as a member of the party's
policy-making Politburo and vice premier. Six months later be became
premier and served in that post until picked to head the Communist
Party.
   He traveled widely throughout the world and earned a reputation
as an urbane and self-assured Chinese leader who was tough at the
negotiating table.
   Zhao was born in October 1919, the son of a wealthy landowner in
central China's Henan province. As with most Chinese leaders, few
details of his family life are known.
   He has been married twice and has four sons and a daughter, Zhao
Liang, who studied in Hawaii in 1981-83. He told reporters that he
worked 10 hours a day, jogged in the morning and argued with his
family at the dinner table. He also regularly played golf, a sport
once condemned in China as a luxury.
   Zhao joined the Communist Youth League in 1932 and became a full
party member in 1936, 13 years before the communists came to power
after chasing the Chinese Nationalists from the mainland. He headed
the Communist Party in his native county for most of the 1937-45 war
between China and Japan.
   While serving as a regional party official in the 1950's, he
orchestrated a purge in southern Guangdong province against cadres
accused of corruption, ties to Nationalist Taiwan and opposition to
land reform.
   In 1957, Zhao oversaw a ``rectification'' campaign in which
80,000 officials were banished to the countryside, where they worked
and faced criticism for their past actions.
   Zhao disappeared for four years after being purged at the start
of the Cultural Revolution, finally re-emerging as party secretary
in Inner Mongolia in 1971.
   Duing those chaotic years, he appeared opportunistic. At one
point, he called for exposure of Deng's alleged crimes in an
apparent act of self-preservation not uncommon in China's tumultuous
politics.
   By the time Deng reappeared and consolidated power in 1978, Zhao
was firmly tied to the reformers.
   ``We must not bind ourselves as silkworms do within cocoons,'' he
said in a 1979 speech. ``All economic patterns and conventions which
hold back the development of productive forces should be abolished.''

   Communist officials have turned to a multilingual
engineer with a flare for economics to shepherd China and their 47
million party members out of the political crisis stemming from the
pro-democracy movement.
   Shanghai party chief Jiang Zemin, named today to replace Zhao
Ziyang as party general secretary, is a university graduate who
speaks English and Russian.
   More importantly, Jiang, 62, is credited by hard-liners for
moving swiftly to end large protests that broke out in Shanghai
following the June 3-4 military assault on pro-democracy protesters
in Beijing.
   Last week, three men were executed in Shanghai for participating
in riots. They were the first in China to die in protest-related
incidents. A total of 27 have been executed since the nationwide
crackdown began three weeks ago.
   Jiang entered the 17-member ruling Politburo as a collegue of
Zhao's in November 1987. Last year, he gave up his post as mayor of
Shanghai, China's largest city with a population of 12 million, to
become party secretary of the city.
   Like conservative Premier Li Peng, Jiang represents the new breed
of Chinese leader, a technocrat loyal to the party and to senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's policies of economic pragmatism.
   As mayor of Shanghai, he aggressively promoted the city as a
financial center and an attractive location for foreign investment.
   Also like Li, Jiang spent time in the Soviet Union, working as a
trainee in a car factory around 1955.
   Jiang was born July 1926 in Yangzhou City, near Shanghai. He
joined the Communist Party in 1946.
   He graduated from the Electrical Machinery Department of Jiaotong
University in Shanghai in 1947.
   After returning from the Soviet Union, he was a deputy chief
engineer at an automobile plant in northeastern China and deputy
director of the Shanghai Electrical Equipment Research Institute.
   Jiang, like most bureaucrats of his generation, was apparently
purged from office during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. In 1980,
he re-emerged as a senior official in the State Administration
Commission on Import and Export Affairs and the State Administration
Commission on Foreign Investment.
   He went on to be named minister of the electronics industry and
in 1985 returned to Shanghai as mayor and deputy secretary of the
party committee.
   In 1986, during student demonstrations in Shanghai, he went to
his alma mater and, seeing a poster with Chinese-language excerpts
from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, surprised students by reciting in
English from the speech.
   He told students they knew the words but not the essence of the
U.S. president's speech and later criticized them for
``superficial'' knowledge of the West.
   According to official profiles, Jiang also reads Romanian, French
and Japanese. He is said to be fond of music and literature.
   He is reportedly the son-in-law of Li Xiannian, China's former
president. Li is one of the old-guard conservatives who supported
Deng in the current suppression of dissent.

<HEAD>Many Fans Boo Skimpy Outfits for Cheerleaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new owner of the Dallas Cowboys football team
isn't getting many cheers for a plan to outfit the team's
cheerleaders in skimpier uniforms.
   Several of the team's cheerleaders say they had learned they
might be required to wear Spandex cycling shorts and halter tops.
They said that they also were asked to act as hostesses at parties,
fraternize with the team and appear in beer commercials.
   More than a third have walked off the squad in protest, but
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Friday the furor is a
misunderstanding and he hasn't changed any rules or policies.
   He said violations of the cheerleading squad policies that
prohibited drinking in uniform and fraternizing with players would
no longer result in automatic expulsion.
   ``Let's count on the judgment of these wonderful people,'' said
the Arkansas oilman, who bought the team earlier this year. ``Let's
not depend on rules.''
   But he did concede that a change was being considered in the
cheerleaders' familiar uniforms of white hot pants, go-go boots,
blue shirts tied at the midriff and fringed vests.
   The Dallas Times Herald asked its readers to call in their
opinion of new outfits for the cheerleaders. The question was:
``Should Jerry Jones change the cheerleaders' uniforms and make them
fraternize with the team?''
   More than 93 percent said no.
   Only 208 callers sided with the Cowboys owner, while 2,808 called
in to say he should leave the uniforms alone.
   ``As far as the Cowboys Cheerleaders are concerned, they are the
best in the United States and the rest are some of the cheapest,''
said Lee Daniels, 65, of Dallas. ``I hope they keep the uniforms and
morals up, and keep it just like it's been for years.''
   Cornell Hill, 37 of Dallas, took exception to the cheerleaders'
current look.
   ``The uniforms look like a private school, or something,'' he
said.
   Cheerleader director Debbie Bond has resigned and 14 veterans
said they would leave with her. The 23 new members have until Monday
to decide whether to stay.
   Several Cowboys Cheerleaders said conditions had become too lax
since Jones bought the team in February, firing longtime coach Tom
Landry the same day. Under former owner H.R. ``Bum'' Bright, squad
members were not allowed to drink or even be photographed with
someone holding a drink while in uniform.

   Esther Williams says women who are used to
wearing swimsuits without high heels should have a foot up on their
competition in a Texas beauty pageant.
   The aquatics and cinema legend, now 60, came to San Antonio for a
midnight swim and a peek at how her idea for a barefoot beauty
stroll works.
   Contestants in the Miss Texas USA 1990 Pageant will stroll down
the walkway in swimsuit competition, but won't have the assistance
of high heels to improve the shapeliness of their calves.
   Pageant co-producer Richard Guy says borrowed the idea from Ms.
Williams, who refuses to let any models presenting her swimsuit line
to wear shoes.
   ``Un-classy ladies are the only ones I've seen in heels and
swimsuits,'' said Guy, who has helped develop five consecutive Miss
USA winners.
   Ms. Williams said she was usually pictured barefoot in her 27
movies, ``because I was always about to go into the water.''
   The pageant producers ``thought it was the funniest thing in the
world that all my girls were barefoot,'' she said. ``But I told them
you can't swim in shoes. And those suits I make aren't called
walking-around suits.''
   The barefoot contestants will wear Esther Williams-designed
swimsuits during the competition in Saturday's preliminaries and in
Monday night's finals.

   Super-absorbent diapers, Velcro and the Jarvik
artificial heart have two things in common: All were developed
through research in space, and they're among 100 items at the
largest-ever exhibit of ``space spinoffs.''
   Other spinoffs on display at the Museum of Science and Industry
are a teflon frying pan, heated ski boots and a bag of potato chips.
   But for several little boys at a museum ceremony Friday, the
spinoffs weren't what really caught their imaginations.
   They had their eyes on a flag.
   Astronaut Jerry Ross visited the unusual exhibit and donated an
official Museum of Science and Industry flag that he took into space
on the 1988 Atlantis space shuttle mission.
   ``Even though we put a little over 1.8 million miles on that flag
in four days,'' it's still in good shape, Ross said.
   Ross, 41, a native of nearby Crown Point, Ind., used to visit the
museum as a boy, and wanted to take along on the Atlantis mission a
reminder of a place that helped spark his interest in space.
   The flag was stored in a vacuum-sealed container underneath the
floor of the spacecraft during the December flight, Ross said. It
will be displayed permanently at the museum.

   Hundreds of supporters of opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi violated martial law by taking to the
streets of Burma's capital a day after she was criticized by the
government, sources said today.
   Friday's gathering was one of the largest assemblies by
opposition supporters since military commander Gen. Saw Maung seized
power last September and his troops crushed dissent by killing
hundreds of people.
   Hundreds of thousands of people protested nationwide last year to
demand an end to a quarter century of military control of the
government.
   One Burmese witness reached in Rangoon said hundreds of
supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi clogged an entire street block near
the central market Friday after hearing rumors she would make a
speech there.
   She was instead campaigning outside the capital, and the people
dispersed after security personnel arrived, the witness said on
condition of anonymity.
   A Western diplomat, giving a slightly different account, said
thousands of people waited for the opposition leader near the
Rangoon General Hospital, and some chanted slogans. He said the
crowd dispersed after the arrival of security personnel and a
monsoon downpour.
   Saw Maung has allowed the formation of opposition parties and
pledged a general election next year.
   But he is apparently worried about the popular following of Aung
San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, the diplomat
said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On Thursday, government spokesman Kyaw Sann accused her and her
party of defying martial law and organizing anti-government
demonstrations. He said the party ``must bear the consequences of
irresponsible and illegal acts.''
   A day earlier, a man was killed when hundreds of people gathered
in northern Rangoon in a memorial to those who died at the hands of
government forces last year.
   The government's Radio Rangoon said a member of the security
forces opened fire when the crowd charged.
   Western witnesses said today that government security personnel
kicked women at the gathering and hit other people with rifle butts.

   China's Communist Party today ousted party chief
Zhao Ziyang, blaming him for the turmoil caused by the pro-democracy
movement and for dividing the party.
   Zhao, 69, an architect of a decade of economic reform, was
replaced by Jiang Zemin, the Shanghai party leader who cracked down
on demonstrations in his city. Jiang is also considered an advocate
of economic modernization.
   The replacement of Zhao as general secretary of the 47-million
member party was announced in a communique by the official Xinhua
News Agency. A change in party leadership had been rumored since the
military assault in Beijing on June 3-4 left hundreds and perhaps
thousands of pro-democracy supporters dead.
   Jiang has taken a hard line in dealing with the protests since
then. He moved swiftly to end large protests that broke out in
Shanghai, and three men were executed last week in Shanghai for
participating in riots. A total of 27 people have been executed
nationwide.
   Zhao is believed to have been purged for opposing senior leader
Deng Xiaoping's use of troops to quell student protests in Beijing.
Zhao has not been seen in public since May 19, and his whereabouts
were unknown today.
   The communique, issued after a plenary session of 276 regular and
alternate members of the party's Central Committee, said Zhao had
``unshirkable responsibilities'' for the recent political turmoil
stemming from huge pro-democracy demonstrations in the capital and
many other Chinese cities.
   It accused Zhao of supporting the turmoil and ``splitting the
party.'' It said Zhao caused ``serious losses to the cause of the
party.''
   The report on Zhao was read by Premier Li Peng, the conservative
who triumphed over Zhao in a party power struggle stemming from the
protests.
   The communique said Zhao was dismissed as general secretary, from
his post in the 17-member ruling Politburo and its Standing
Committee, from membership in the 175-member policymaking Central
Committee, and first vice chairman of the Central Military
Commission. He had served as premier before he was named party chief
in January 1987.
   Jiang, 62, served as mayor of Shanghai, China's largest city,
from 1985 to 1988, when he moved over to head the Communist Party in
the city. He entered the Politburo, where he was a collegue of
Zhao's, in November 1987.
   The communique said nothing about filing criminal charges against
Zhao, who has been accused of supporting a ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
   The communique acknowledged that Zhao ``did something beneficial
to the reform, the opening of China to the outside world and
economic work.'' It said the party will ``look further into his
case.''
   The Central Committee also decided to remove Hu Qili, 60, from
the Politburo Standing Committee. Hu is considered a moderate who
also opposed the introduction of martial law in Beijing.
   Jiang is a technocrat who speaks Russian and English. In
Shanghai, he has actively worked to restore the city's reputation as
a financial center and to attract foreign investment to revive its
industrial base.
   Some earlier reports had suggested that Qiao Shi, a Politburo
member in change of internal security, would be named to replace
Zhao.
   The party also expanded the Politburo Standing Committee from
five to six members, replacing Zhao and Hu with Jiang, Tianjin Mayor
Li Ruihuan and economist Song Ping, head of the party Organization
Department.
   It also announced a reshuffling in the party's four-member
Secretariat, removing Zhao allies Rui Xingwen and Yan Mingfu and
replacing them with Li Ruihuan and Politburo alternate Ding Guangen.
The Secretariat is responsible for day-to-day operations.
   The new Standing Committee members are all regarded as strong
advocates of China's open-door economic policies with the outside
world. They are also likely to back Deng's attempt to unify the
party behind his hard-line stance toward activists and other critics.
   The communique said the Politburo met from Monday through
Wednesday and the Central Committee, which must make all formal
decisions on leadership positions, held its session on Friday and
today.
   The leadership changes have been expected since May, when the
pro-democracy student demonstrations split the party leadership and
triggered a power struggle between moderates and hard-liners.
   Deng, 84, came down on the side of the hard-liners, deciding to
declare martial law in Beijing on May 20 and ordering the military
attack on the city.
   Earlier today, authorities announced an army propaganda
specialist has taken over as editor in chief at the official daily
of the Communist Party in a reshuffling of the newspaper's
management.
   The foreign affairs office of the People's Daily said Shao Huaze,
director of the Propaganda Department of the People's Liberation
Army, had replaced Tan Wenrui as chief editor of China's leading
paper.
   The office also said Qian Liren, director at the daily, had left
his post. He was replaced by Gao Di, a senior official at the
Central Party School of the party Central Committee.
   Both Qian and Tan resigned because of health reasons, the office
said without elaborating.
   The replacements at The People's Daily came as the party stepped
up its propaganda campaign to defend the suppression of
pro-democracy activists.

<TEXT>
   A cease-fire went into effect today in
Angola, ending 14 years of civil war that killed tens of thousands
of people and entangled the world's superpowers as well as Cuba and
South Africa.
   However, the Marxist government and the U.S-backed rebels must
still carry out difficult talks to make the pact a permanent peace.
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and Moscow-trained President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos of Angola signed the truce and sealed it with a
handshake late Thursday at an African summit in Zaire.
   Savimbi, who left for home Friday to tell his forces to prepare
for peace, said before departing, ``I was not born to make war at
all cost.''
   Savimbi's army has controlled most of southeastern Angola for
years, administering schools and hospitals in rural areas occupied
by up to 3 million of the country's 9 million people.
   Savimbi, son of a part-time Protestant preacher, told the Zairian
news agency he was prepared to work ``without preconditions'' with
dos Santos' government.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, a Savimbi ally credited with
a prominent role in the reconciliation, will mediate future
negotiations. The conservative Mobutu is to meet President Bush in
Washington on Thursday to discuss peace in southern Africa, said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The summit of 20 African leaders in Zaire was the first meeting
between dos Santos, 47, and Savimbi since the former allies in a
struggle for black rule went to war in 1975 as Portuguese colonizers
left Angola.
   Their agreement took many people by surprise. As recently as
Monday, Angolan Foreign Minister Afonso van Dunem said his
government would not negotiate with the rebels.
   Savimbi, born in 1934, leads the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), a socialist group backed by China,
South Africa and Washington. It has fought to share power with dos
Santos' Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, which
is backed by Cuban forces and receives arms mainly from the Soviet
Union.
   Despite thousands of foreign troops having supported both sides,
neither the government nor the rebels came close to delivering a
knockout blow in the war.
   The cease-fire follows a U.S.-brokered regional peace accord
signed in New York in December. Under that earlier pact, South
Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia, Angola's southern
neighbor, and halt aid to Savimbi's guerrillas in exchange for
withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops backing dos Santos'
government. However, Savimbi was not party to that agreement.
   His future role in Angola was not clear.
   The Portugese news agency Lusa said today that Savimbi could
become Angola's representative to the United States for a period of
two years. The agency quoted unidentified Angolan officials as
saying Savimbi could be named ``special counselor'' to Washington.
   Angola has been pushing for diplomatic recoginition by the United
States. There was no indication Savimbi's possible appointment would
lead to recognition, and there was no independent confirmation of
the Lusa report.
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said Savimbi will go into exile
under terms of the new pact but did not provide details. Reports in
Zaire said Savimbi's exile would be temporary.
   Rebel sources in Washington, however, said Savimbi would stay in
Angola.
   Mobutu said Savimbi ``reaffirmed that he had no intention of
participating in the next government.''
   The accord calls for reintegration of rebel forces into Angolan
society and the creation of a national reconciliation commission
under Mobutu's chairmanship. However, it set no time or place for
the commission to begin its work and did not specify who would
represent the rival Angolan parties.
   The Portuguese news agency LUSA reported Friday that the two
sides would meet in the next few days in Zimbabwe. It gave no
details.

<HEAD>Hu Qili Urged People Throughout Country to Help Change China</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hu Qili rose quickly to the pinnacle of China's
leadership under the wings of former Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang, a man he once was expected to succeed.
   But Hu was purged from the party today in disgrace along with
party chief Zhao Ziyang, both branded as too lenient on the
student-led democracy movement the government crushed earlier this
month.
   Two years ago, at the relatively young age of 58, Hu was promoted
to the Communist Party Politburo's Standing Committee, an elite
group of five to six people who make up the most powerful
decision-making body in China.
   Hu gained prominence in the mid-1980s for championing the
economic reforms initiated by senior leader Deng Xiaoping and
traveling throughout the country urging people to help change China.
   ``We should be bold enough to break with some specific
conclusions already proved through practice to be outdated or partly
incorrect,'' he said in a speech in April 1986. ``Only by doing so
can we uphold and develop Marxism, and push forward the Socialist
cause.''
   Starting in 1985, as he worked his way up from the party's
Central Committee to the Politburo, Hu began making public
appearances and joined some important missions abroad. He also began
standing in for senior leaders in dealings with visiting foreign
dignitaries.
   Hu visited Yugoslavia and West Germany, and he joined Hu Yaobang,
Communist Party chief at the time, on a tour of five South Pacific
nations. The two men are not related.
   As the reform movement gained momentum, Hu solidified his
standing under the tutelage of Hu Yaobang, prompting speculation
that he might succeed his mentor as party general secretary.
   Then came the student unrest that led to Hu Yaobang's ouster in
1987 and criticism that he appeared too sympathetic to protesters
demanding political reforms. Hu Qili distanced himself from Hu
Yaobang and later in the year became a member of the Politburo's
Standing Committee. But he had lost the prominence he gained as a
champion of Deng's fast-paced reforms.
   Branded a capitalist follower during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, Hu was exiled to the countryside. His political comeback
began in 1972 when he reappeared as a party functionary in Ningxia.
   When Deng came to power in 1978, Hu was summoned to Beijing as
Communist Youth League secretary and vice president of the
prestigious Qinghua University. In 1980 Hu was elected mayor of
Tianjin, China's third-largest city, and served as director of the
party's general office in 1982-84.
   He joined the party's Central Committee and the Secretariat in
1982.
   An engineer and graduate of Qinghua, Hu is married with two
children. He was born in 1929 in the central province of Shaanxi.
   In addition to pushing for reforms, Hu supported China's efforts
to open itself to the outside world.
   Referring to party debate over the open-door policy, he said in a
1985 interview: ``I think it is very necessary for us to try to
identify problems and overcome them in a timely fashion. We need
fine-tuning from time to time.''

<HEAD>Revenge of the Lawn: Neighbors in Court Over Heels in Sod</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOLIHULL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman accused of walking her dog in a
sly and vindictive manner across her neighbors' lawn has agreed to
pay compensation.
   ``This is what could be described as a neighbors' dispute that
had got out of hand,'' John McCann, the prosecuting counsel, told
magistrates on Friday.
   The court in Solihull, a suburb of Birmingham, heard that
Winifred Burrows, 71, and Lillian Priddy, 74, had discovered holes
in the lawn bordering their prize-winning garden.
   Seeking confirmation of their suspicions, they staked out the
yard one February night and said they saw Judith Abercrombie, 48,
strutting across their grass in high-heeled shoes.
   When confronted, McCann said, ``Mrs. Abercrombie said to her dog:
`Come on, let's go back and do it again.'''
   Mrs. Priddy and Mrs. Burrows called the police, who came to Mrs.
Abercrombie's home and asked her to come to the station. ``No
chance,'' she allegedly responded and was arrested.
   ``The prosecution case is that it was an act of intent, it was
not an accident or recklessness, and there have been ongoing
problems between the two parties,'' McCann said.
   A charge of causing damage was dismissed when Mrs. Abercrombie
agreed to pay 50 pounds ($78) compensation to the sisters and to
post a bond of 200 pounds ($310) to keep the peace for two years.
   ``I accept there was a confrontation on the night of Feb. 8, but
I have always denied, and maintain my denial, that I committed any
criminal offense,'' she said afterward.
   Mrs. Burrows and Mrs. Priddy donated the damages to the Police
Benevolent Fund in gratitude for the support of the police.
   ``We hope this will be the end of the matter,'' Mrs. Priddy said.
``Quite frankly, we feel sorry for her.''

<HEAD>Official Newspaper Says Khomeini's Son Should Lead Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran should be governed by a three-member
advisory board chaired by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's son, Ahmad,
an editorial in a government-run newspaper said today.
   The governing board also should include President Ali Khamenei
and Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, said the Tehran Times
editorial, which was carried by the state-run Islamic Republic News
Agency.
   The editorial said Ahmad Khomeini should be chairman of the board
because he was close to his father, the architect of Iran's 1979
Islamic revolution, and familiar with his thinking.
   ``This will surely enable the leader Ayatollah Khamenei, who
himself has been a very close aide and disciple of the imam, not to
lose sight ever of the late imam's trend of thought and action,''
the English-language editorial said. Iranians referred to Khomeini
as the imam, or supreme spiritual leader.
   Khamenei, 49, was chosen to succeed Khomeini as the country's
supreme leader a day after Khomeini, 86, died of a heart attack June
3. Khamenei's second term as president expires in October and the
constitution bars him from running again.
   Rafsanjani, the 55-year-old parliament speaker and commander of
the armed forces, is the only announced candidate in the July 28
presidential elections.
   The younger Khomeini, 43, had no formal political role but served
as his father's chief assistant.
   The Iranian news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the editorial
referred to economic and other unspecified problems the country
faces.
   ``With the experienced aides in different areas, the leadership
can most definitely speed up the realization of the divine goals of
the Islamic revolution,'' the paper said.
   There was speculation before Khomeini died that the council he
set up to choose his successor would appoint a committee in his
place, but the majority selected Khamenei.

   Here is an excerpt from the Communist Party
Central Committee statement issued Saturday about the ouster of
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang:
   The session held that at the critical juncture involving the
destiny of the party and the state, Comrade Zhao Ziyang made the
mistake of supporting the turmoils and splitting the party and he
had unshirkable responsibilities for the shaping-up of the turmoils.
   The nature and consequences of his mistake are very serious.
Although he did something beneficial to the reform, the opening of
China to the outside world and the economic work when he held
principal leading posts in the party and government, he obviously
erred in guidelines in the party and practical work.
   Especially after taking charge of the work of the Central
Committee, he took a passive approach to the adherence to the four
cardinal principles and opposition to bourgeois liberalization, and
gravely neglected party building, cultural and ethical development
and ideological and political work, causing serious losses to the
cause of the party.
   In view of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's serious mistakes listed above,
the session decided to dismiss him as general secretary of the
Central Committee, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee, member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee, member of the Central Committee and first
vice chairman of the Military Commission of the Communist Party of
China's Central Committee, and decided to look further into his case.

<HEAD>22 Convicted of Trying to Overthrow Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait's state security court today convicted 22
people of trying to overthrow the government and sentenced them to
prison terms ranging from five to 15 years.
   Another 11 defendants, including a British national of Lebanese
descent, were acquitted.
   Most of the defendants belong to the minority Shiite Moslem sect
in predominantly Sunni Moslem Kuwait.
   The case was first reported when the indictment was released in
March, but authorities never said when the defendants tried to
overthrow the government.
   They include 18 Kuwaitis believed to be of Iranian descent, two
Iranians, nine Iraqis, two Lebanese, the Briton and one person whose
country of origin was unknown. The defendants included engineers,
teachers, computer specialists, electricians, laborers and a former
police officer.
   They were charged with belonging to illegal groups that sought
``to demolish the social and economic fabric of the country,''
spread ``destructive ideologies'' and defame the emir, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
   The indictment said they used public statements and ``writings,
sketches and pictures'' in their activities.
   Only 20 of the defendants appeared before the court during the
trial, which began on May 13.
   Court Chairman Mohammed al-Bannai sentenced them during a public
session attended by relatives of the defendants. The defendants
present smiled broadly but made no comment.
   Kuwait was a repeated target of terrorist attacks during the
eight-year Iraq-Iran war. The attacks were blamed on Iran,
predominately Shiite and opposed to Kuwait for backing Iraq.
   One case involved an attempt on the life of the emir in May 1985
when a booby-trapped car rammed into his motorcade and exploded. He
escaped with minor injuries, but five people were killed.
   Relations between Kuwait and Iran have improved since a
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war went into effect in August. But the
latest case underscored Kuwait's determination to keep monitoring
the Shiite minority.

   Crews worked today to contain 1 million
gallons of heating oil that spilled from a tanker and created a
five-mile slick that began washing up on the Rhode Island coast.
   White House officials arrived just hours after the
Providence-bound tanker World Prodigy, carrying 7.6 million gallons
of heating oil, struck a rock at Brenton Reef in Rhode Island Sound
about 4:30 p.m. Friday.
   Just a few hours later, oil spilled in a collision of an oil
tanker and a tugboat at the mouth of the Houston Ship Channel at
Galveston Bay, Texas. The accidents came three months after nearly
11 million gallons of heavy crude oil gushed into Alaskan waters
from the tanker Exxon Valdez, causing the nation's worst oil spill.
   Army helicopters surveying the Rhode Island shore this morning
confirmed that oil was washing ashore near Jamestown, said Robert L.
Bendick Jr., director of the state Department of Environmental
Management.
   Bendick said curiosity seekers in Jamestown who were hampering
cleanup efforts were removed from the town's picturesque beach,
across the harbor from Newport.
   The spill occurred one mile south of Newport and by today it was
five miles long. No harm to wildlife was immediately reported, but
all of the state's beaches were closed today.
   The Department of Environmental Management said they would remain
off-limits until the oil had been cleaned up.
   Boaters also were asked to stay in port. ``We don't want boats
churning up the oil slick,'' said Stephen G. Morin, chief of the
department's emergency response team. But the organizers said the
Salem Pro Sail Series will continue as scheduled today at the
Newport Yachting Center. The competition began June 21 and is set to
continue until Sunday.
   Vice Adm. Clyde T. Lusk Jr. of the Coast Guard said a team from
Mobile, Ala., and special skimmer ships were brought in to combat
the spill.
   Nine of the ship's 27 tanks were damaged, said Coast Guard Capt.
Eric Williams of the Marine Safety office in Providence.
   Tim Morgan, a diver who surveyed the hull of the 530-foot tanker,
said there is a 200-foot-long gash, as wide as five feet, along one
side. There are about 150 feet of dents and smaller holes on the
other side, he said.
   ``The damage is so extreme it's impossible to seal the vessel off
with any kind of soft patches,'' Morgan said.
   The Coast Guard began unloading the World Prodigy about 2:20
a.m., and Williams said the work could take up to a week.
   Cleanup crews initially strung booms around the slick and later
replaced them with booms with deeper skirts to pool the oil, said
Lusk.
   The White House, criticized for its response to the Alaskan
spill, reacted swiftly to the Rhode Island accident. President Bush
dispatched Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and William Reilly, head
of the Environmental Protection Agency, to the scene.
   ``It's a big spill and in a very important place,'' Reilly said
at a news conference about 2 a.m. after federal officials met with
Gov. Edward DiPrete. ``Narragansett Bay is one of the crown jewels
of the country's ocean resources.''
   Richard Dreedan, a Bush assistant at the scene, said the
president has determined to ``do everything possible to respond to
this situation,'' adding, ``We've obviously learned something from
that situation'' in Alaska.
   The Providence port, where the ship sailing under a Greek flag
was heading, is about 25 miles from Newport via Narragansett Bay,
which feeds into the Providence River.
   John Civic, who lives near Narragansett Bay, witnessed the
accident.
   ``I'm looking and this guy was barrelling along and boom; he just
stopped dead in the water. He was moving pretty good, faster than
most,'' he said.
   Officials said the magnitude was far less than the Valdez
disaster in March. The amount was less, and No. 2 heating oil is
lighter and easier to recover than the crude oil that poured into
Prince William Sound.
   ``There still will be a mess on the beach, it still will have to
be sucked up with absorbent pads, but at least it's not like Valdez,
where you have to sandblast it, steam it off the rocks,'' said Morin.
   The odor of the spilled oil wafted through this tony seaside
resort, where the shoreline is dotted with mansions.
   ``Boy, it's enough to knock you off your feet,'' said Rhode
Island Secretary of State Kathleen S. Connell, who lives near the
shore.
   The ship's master was identified as Iakovas Georgudis by Chief
Warrant Officer Jerry Alfred of the Coast Guard in Newport.
   DiPrete said the skipper told him no pilot was aboard the tanker
at the time of the crash. He said the captain also said he made a
mistake in plotting the ship's course.
   Marine Safety Office officials said the ship had not come quite
close enough to the bay to require a pilot, but that the ship so
close that it was unwise of the captain to operate without one.
   ``It's kind of a gray area out there,'' said Chief Warrant
Officer Jerry Alfred, a Marine Safety investigator.
   The governor said the state planned legal action, although he
said it was too soon to talk about criminal charges.
   ``There was plenty of ocean there. There was no reason this
terrible tragedy had to happen,'' DiPrete said.
   Brenton Reef is a nautical landmark where America's Cup yacht
races were held for many years.
   The tanker began its journey in Bourgas, Bulgaria, on the Black
Sea, according to Lloyds of London. The Coast Guard said the ship is
owned by the Greek-based Ballard Shipping Co., but did not know who
owns the cargo.

<HEAD>Protest Denounces Expulsion of Ethnic Turks From Bulgaria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VEDAT ERDAMAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 150,000 demonstrators today
demanded Bulgaria end oppression that has led thousands of ethnic
Turks to flee Bulgaria.
   The protest in Taksim Square was organized by the governing
Motherland Party and the opposition Social Democrat and True Path
Parties.
   Organizers said thousands of ethnic Turks who immigrated to
Turkey from Bulgaria traveled to Istanbul from many western and
Thracian cities to attend the rally, which was broadcast live
nationally on the state-run television.
   There were hundreds of red-and-white Turkish flags in the square,
and banners hung from surrounding buildings denounced Bulgaria and
its leader, Todor Zhivkov. Protesters carried banners saying, ``End
Bulgarian Cruelty,'' ``Freedom for Turks in Bulgaria,'' and ``The
New Hitler Zhivkov.''
   Political leaders addressing the rally protested the expulsion of
ethnic Turks by Bulgaria. The crowd chanted slogans such as
``Murderer Zhivkov, army to Sofia!'' and ``We want guns against
Bulgaria!''
   In 1984, Bulgaria began forcing ethnic Turks to adopt Bulgarian
names and forbidding them to speak their language or practice their
religion.
   Thousands of Turks began leaving Bulgaria after Zhivkov said May
29 that any Bulgarian citizen, including the 1-million-strong
Turkish minority, could leave the country. Three weeks later,
250,000 Turks had applied for passports, and 150,000 of them
reportedly received them immediately.
   In Istanbul today, Mumin Gencoglu, the head of the Federation of
the Association of Immigrants from Bulgaria, and Sevket Yilmaz,
chairman of Turkey's largest labor federation, condemned the
Bulgarian oppression and expressed solidarity with ethnic Turks.
   They said Turkey was ready to accept all ethnic Turks who wanted
to come, and they called on the international commnuity for support.
   More than 60,000 ethnic Turks have crossed into Turkey over the
past month, bringing whatever belongings they could carry.
   Bulgarian officials say seven people died in violent clashes with
security forces in May. But Western diplomats in Sofia estimate at
least 30 ethnic Turks were killed and up to 5,000 expelled
immediately after the clashes.
   Premier Turgut Ozal has called on Bulgaria and the United Nations
to guarantee that ethnic Turks who want to leave Bulgaria can do so
in peace. But Sofia rejects a U.N. discussion of its Turkish
minority, insisting that such an ethnic group no longer exists in
Bulgaria.

   At Q Soft, Inc., in Tyson's Corner, Va., plans
for selling software in China are on the back burner.
   At an Agriculture Department laboratory in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
a scheduled research trip to China by an aquatic weed specialist has
been put on hold.
   But in Foxboro, Mass., executives of the Foxboro Co. are in
nightly touch by telephone and fax machine with Chinese colleagues
at the company's electronics plant in Shanghai.
   In Shenzhen, China, six employes of the San Francisco-based
Bechtel Group supervise construction of a 28-story Intercontinental
Hotel within walking distance of the Hong Kong border.
   At the Sackler Gallery for Asian Art in Washington and at the
Columbus, Ohio, Museum of Art, people are lining up to view Chinese
art exhibits, and plans for more such exhibitions are under way.
   And in New York, the National Council of Churches has begun
orientation sessions for 19 new teachers to teach English in Chinese
schools.
   The warming of U.S. Chinese relations, which began with pingpong
diplomacy, has blossomed into a patchwork of cultural and scientific
ties, about $14 billion a year in two-way trade, and investment of
some $3.4 billion in China by about 300 companies. An estimated
300,000 Americans visited China last year and more than 50,000
Chinese came to the United States. Approximately 62,500 Chinese
students have enrolled in American schools since the beginning of
the thaw in the early 1970's.
   President Bush is being criticized by some in Congress for not
acting more forcefully against the repressive tactics of Beijing,
and was quoted by a senator Friday as saying ``there was a long road
that was going to have to be traveled in that relationship and that
we shouldn't move precipitously.''
   Roger Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business Council,
supported the president's go-slow approach, but said trade relations
between the two countries will nevertheless ``be cut back
considerably.''
   ``He's not cutting the ties, but the Chinese are doing it
themselves, very clearly,'' Sullivan said in an interview.
   China and the United States, at odds since the Communist takeover
of the mainland in 1949, began their rapprochement with an exchange
of table tennis teams in 1971. President Nixon followed up with a
visit to Beijing in 1972 and diplomatic relations between the two
countries were restored in 1979.
   ``The effort that has been done since Nixon's time till now is
just going down the drain,'' said South Kousoum, deputy director of
the Asian-Pacific American Chamber of Commerce.
   Q Soft, the Virginia computer software firm, had reportedly been
exploring the possibility of selling its services to the Chinese
national transportation system.
   ``Because of what happened in China in the last few weeks, that
definitely puts China on the back burner for us,'' said Rawlein
Soberano, director of program development for the company. ``We are
not going to pursue it more actively until the political stability
there is firmly established and things improve that would encourage
us to pursue a viable business activity with that country.''
   Gerald Gleason, a Foxboro vice president, said its Shanghai
factory, employing about 500 people to make control systems for oil
refineries and power plants, had turned a profit every year but the
first since it opened six years ago as a joint venture with a
Chinese company.
   ``Everything was normal right up until a few weeks ago,'' he
said. The week after the shootings in Tiananmen square, the company
withdrew the American executive who is deputy general manager of the
plant. The other American employe on the scene, the chief engineer,
was already back in Foxboro on an assignment connected with his work
for the Chinese plant. The men's families were also brought out.
They are still in Foxboro.
   ``But they are in communication with the plant every night by
telephone, fax or telex and are participating in decisions and what
have you and the plant is running in a more or less normal phase,''
Gleason said.
   Gleason said he anticipated a good chance of normal operation,
although ``everything is problematical.''
   ``There is certainly a continuing risk that some sort of
sanctions could develop that would make it difficult for us to
operate, because of the pressure both from the left and the right in
the Congress on the president,'' he said. ``The president's present
position would not seem to threaten ventures such as ours.''
   From San Francisco, Larry Miller, a spokesman for Bechtel, said
its two major projects in China had not been affected. One is a
nuclear power plant at Daya Bay, about 50 miles up the coast from
Hong Kong, for which it is providing management services during
construction. The other is the $640 million hotel it is building in
Shanzhen. The company transferred the four Americans in its Beijing
office to Shanzhen after the disturbances, and Miller said a
decision is planned during the coming week on whether to send them
back. Meanwhile, a Chinese company in a joint venture with Bechtel
is keeping the Beijing office open.
   The United States and China opened a research laboratory in
Beijing in December to help find natural enemies of insects and
weeds that threaten crops in the two countries. Officials said the
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences was expected to send
scientists to the Fort Lauderdale lab this year.
   ``Everything as far as I know is on hold until we receive word,''
Ted Center, a research entomologist at Fort Lauderdale who is the
lead scientist for biological control projects on aquatic weeds,
said. ``We had planned to have one of our scientists over there in
July, and that trip has been canceled pending further developments.
Nobody really knows what is going to happen.''
   Other joint U.S.-Chinese scientific projects include research on
rangeland weeds that are common in both countries, and an
arrangement by the Energy Department and the Chinese Academy of
Sciences to study the greenhouse effect.
   In Columbus, more than 300,000 people have viewed the ``Sons of
Heaven'' exhibition of more than 225 national treasures from 22
Chinese museums since it opened March 1.
   A show of brush-and-ink paintings by Wang Yani, a 14-year-old
Chinese prodigy, opens Sunday at Washington's Sackler Gallery, and
spokeswoman Susan Bliss said, ``We expect that the public will be
very interested and will be coming.'' The child artist appeared at a
preview at the gallery June 21.
   Marc Wilson, director of the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City,
Mo., who organized the exhibition, said planners feared that the
disorder in China might affect it, ``but so far there is no sign of
it.''
   ``If they had wished to stop her from coming over they could
have, but they didn't,'' Wilson said. ``She left well after the
trouble.''
   ``We are working with China on other projects, and we are
proceeding,'' he said. ``We are not getting cold feet. If something
happens to the projects, if they are postponed, canceled, put on the
shelf, whatever, it will be on the Chinese side, not our side.''
   At the National Council of Churches, Cynthia McLean, a specialist
in the council's China program, said orientation began Friday for
the group of new teachers for the English teaching program the
council has been conducting jointly with Amity, its counterpart
group in China, since 1985.
   ``We plan to send them in August,'' she said. ``Everyone has
complete freedom along along the way to decide that they don't want
to go, but we haven't yet had any pullouts.''

spokeswoman said.
   Two temblors, each measuring 4.1 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, struck five miles north of the town of Jackson, said Pat
Jorgenson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden,
Colo.
   ``Well it really shook. I mean, you know, the windows rattled and
you could just feel it,'' said Joanne Cross, who works at the Wort
Hotel in Jackson. ``I thought, is somebody having a fight upstairs
and breaking the furniture or are we having an earthquake? It was
just a little hard to really tell.''
   The first jolt hit at 3:25 a.m. MDT and the second temblor shook
the area at 4:25 a.m. MDT, Ms. Jorgenson said.
   It was not immediately known whether the second shaker was an
aftershock of the first quake, she said.
   A fault system has not yet been identified in the area of the
temblors, although there have been earthquakes there in the past,
she said.
   ``It has been some time since they have had any of this
magnitude,'' Ms. Jorgenson said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage.

<TEXT>
   Each day, hundreds of trucks,
buses and cars are in line at this border checkpoint, filled with
ethnic Turks leaving this communist country in hopes of finding
civil and religious freedom.
   ``I have left all my wealth behind, my house, my cattle,
everything,'' said a farmer from the southeastern town of Haskovo,
spreading his arms in despair as he waited with thousands of others
to cross into Turkey.
   Many may face unemployment, deprivation and an uncertain future
in Turkey, which has millions of citizens working in western Europe
because they cannot make a living at home.
   But the Turks are leaving Bulgaria anyway, driven by centuries of
mutual suspicion, an assimilation campaign, and fears that arose
after violent clashes with security forces in May killed at least
seven ethnic Turks.
   Foreign observers in Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, say the
emigration of the Moslem Turks could be disastrous for both
countries and a serious challenge to the 35-year rule of Bulgarian
leader Todor Zhivkov.
   Entire villages have been vacated, some factories have no workers
and crops are left in the ground, causing enormous damage to the
Bulgarian economy, according to a government adviser who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The exodus began after Zhivkov announced May 29 that all
Bulgarian citizens, including the 1 million Turks, could leave the
country.
   Three weeks later, a quarter of a million Turks had applied for
passports, and 150,000 of them had received one, according to Deputy
Foreign Minister Ivan Ganev.
   The rush to the passport office followed last month's clashes
between security forces and ethnic Turks protesting the assimilation
campaign, which began in 1984. The campaign forced all Turks to
adopt Bulgarian-sounding names, banned their language in public, and
restricted their rights to practice the Moslem religion.
   The Bulgarians say seven people died in the unrest. Western
diplomats in Sofia estimate at least 30 ethnic Turks were killed.
   There always has been a mutual suspicion between Bulgarians and
Turks rooted in 500 years of Ottoman rule in Bulgaria. Yet despite
their lingering resentment of Turks, many ethnic Bulgarians
privately concede that the campaign to force Turks to adopt
Bulgarian-sounding names was a mistake.
   Emotions are inflamed by a diplomatic war of words in which
Bulgaria and Turkey have blamed each other for starting the current
problems.
   ``They whipped up a mass psychosis,'' Ganev said of the Turkish
government. Western diplomats in Sofia, while strongly critical of
Bulgaria's actions, concede that Turkish radio broadcasts urging the
ethnic Turks to put up ``moral and spiritual resistance'' to the
Bulgarians' campaign do little to ease tensions.
   In public, both Bulgaria and Turkey have voiced willingness to
hold talks. But Sofia rejects any agenda that includes discussion of
a ``Turkish minority'' it insists no longer exists in Bulgaria.
   By June 22, 55,000 ethnic Turks had crossed into Turkey on their
new passports, clutching any belongings they could carry.
   Hundreds of trucks, buses, cars and trolleys loaded with
everything from household equipment to bedding and furniture jammed
the Kapitan Andreevo border post in recent days, with passengers
waiting up to three days to cross.
   Bulgarian drivers who refuse to drive across forced families out
of the vehicles, making them walk into Turkey with their belongings.
   A couple searched desperately for their son in the confusion. A
frail, white-haired woman lay limp on a makeshift sickbed in the
back of a car.
   In a small town en route to Kapitan Andreevo, about 200 people
waited outside a bank to withdraw money. ``They are buying whatever
they can because they are allowed to take along only a limited sum''
when crossing into Turkey, a Bulgarian explained.
   Why leave in such haste for an uncertain future?
   ``Above all, the names,'' said a Turkish woman. ``They don't
allow us to use our language and they are destroying our mosques,''
she added, refusing to give her name.
   She said she knew of people in her native area of Kardzhali, an
ethnic Turkish region in southeastern Bulgaria, who were fined for
using the Turkish language.
   ``I was given only three days to leave my home,'' said a gaunt
man from the northern Shumen area.
   An old woman carrying an oil lamp told a Bulgarian reporter
nearby, ``I'm sure there won't be any electricity at the place in
Turkey where I will go.''
   Several emigrants interviewed in the presence of Bulgarian
reporters apparently feared reprisals when talking to a Westerner.
Some said they were leaving only on ``an excursion.''
   But the amount of luggage indicated they did not plan to return.

<HEAD>Plant Shutdown is Blow to Industry, but Chain Reaction Seen Unlikely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shutdown of the Rancho Seco nuclear plant
in California _ the first forced by a voter initiative _ is adding
to the industry's ills, but analysts doubt it will set off a chain
reaction of plant closures.
   Rancho Seco began shutting down just hours after residents in the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District voted June 6 to pull the plug
on a 15-year-old plant that suffered a history of expensive
breakdowns and poor management.
   Anti-nuclear groups hailed the ballot result, and some suggested
it could prove a catalyst for citizen initiatives against other
nuclear plants. But early indications are that the fallout will be
much less dramatic.
   ``The circumstances with Rancho Seco were unique to Rancho Seco,
so we're not going to have a domino effect,'' said Scott Denman,
director of the Safe Energy Communication Council, a
Washington-based group opposed to nuclear power.
   He added, however, that because it focused on the economics of
nuclear power, the Rancho Seco campaign may lead to broader interest
in alternative sources of energy, such as solar power, and efforts
to make more efficient use of all energy supplies.
   Thus in the longer run, he said, the Rancho Seco vote may prove
to be a milestone.
   ``We tend to think it's the last flapping of the tail after the
fish has been pulled from the water,'' he said.
   Industry supporters say Rancho Seco was an aberration, noting
that 15 other citizen initiatives against nuclear power prior to the
Rancho Seco case failed. They see no indication that the public
wants to throw out nuclear power.
   ``We think that Rancho Seco was not a vote against nuclear power,
but a vote against the way that plant was run by upper management,''
said Scott Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Council for Energy
Awareness, a pro-nuclear group.
   The nuclear industry has been stagnating for more than a decade,
partly because of public wariness about safety and partly because of
economic problems. No utility has ordered a new nuclear plant since
1978 and many nuclear supporters agree with critics that no orders
are likely before the turn of the century.
   ``I don't know of a single chief executive officer in our
industry that would bet his company on a nuclear plant,'' said
William McCollam Jr., president of the Edison Electric Institute, a
trade group of privately owned utilities.
   He called the Rancho Seco vote ``not good for the public
perception of nuclear power.''
   Many nuclear plants are run efficiently, but those that are not
have blackened the industry's image.
   Rancho Seco had a poor record, producing less than 40 percent of
the electricity that would have resulted from unfailing year-round
operation _ far below the industry average. The utility district had
to double its rates over the past four years to pay for plant
improvements that cost more than the reactor itself.
   John Ahearne, a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, said he didn't expect the Rancho Seco vote to trigger a
rash of citizen moves against nuclear power. He said the shutdown
exposed an important weakness in the industry: the inability or
unwillingness to force a poor-performing plant to change its ways.
   ``The industry knew very well that this was a terrible plant,''
he said, yet it turned a blind eye and in effect allowed nuclear
critics to strengthen their hand.
   Several other U.S. nuclear plants are suffering from poor
performance, and the NRC, which regulates the nation's 109 operating
reactors, says it's losing patience with some of the laggards.
   Earlier this month, the NRC raised the possibility of taking the
extraordinary step of closing down two reactors at the Turkey Point
power station in Florida because of poor performance. The reactors
have been on the commission's list of worst-run nuclear stations
since it began the rating system in 1986.
   In Maryland, the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant has fallen into a
rapid decline. Less than two years ago it was given rave reviews by
an international inspection team. Now it is listed by the NRC as
among the worst-run U.S. plants. The plant shut down its two
reactors in May because of mechanical problems, creating a revenue
drain and prospects of power shortages in the Baltimore area.
   Despite these and other problems, the nuclear industry faces a
less vocal public opposition than in the immediate aftermath of the
1979 reactor accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, which
was the most severe in U.S. history.
   There is relatively little organized campaigning, for example, to
close Turkey Point or Calvert Cliffs. Even the Peach Bottom nuclear
plant in Pennsylvania, which was closed down for about two years by
the NRC after control room operators were discovered sleeping on the
job in 1987, faces little local opposition.

<HEAD>Loss Of Sleep Can Destroy Learning, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students who study hard Monday through Friday
and then party all night on weekends may lose much of what they
learned during the week, according to a sleep researcher.
   Carlyle Smith, a professor of psychology at Trent University in
Peterborough, Ontario, said that retaining of new, complex knowledge
is a fragile thing that can be disrupted even by mild sleep
deprivation during critical nights just after learning the
information.
   ``It appears skewing the sleep cycle by just two hours can have
this effect,'' said Smith. This means that the sleep periods
following a class or a study period can be as important to learning
as the book work itself, he said.
   ``Watching a long, late movie the night following a class and
then sleeping in the next morning will make it so you're not
learning what you thought,'' he said. ``You'll not lose it all _
just about 30 percent.''
   In a paper prepared for presentation Saturday at the annual
meeting of the Association of Professional Sleep Societies, Smith
said he researched the effects of sleep deprivation on learning by
controlling the sleep of four groups of students after they had all
been taught a complex logic game and a list of paired words.
   One group was deprived totally of sleep for the night after
learning the task. That same night, another group was awakened
whenever they slipped into the deep phase of slumber called rapid
eye movement sleep, or REM. Another group was awakened during sleep
periods that were not REM, and the fourth group was allowed to sleep
normally.
   When tested a week later on the paired words, there was no
learning deficit among any of the groups. But when tested on the
complex logic game, the groups deprived of all sleep or of REM sleep
all showed a learning deficit of 30 percent when compared to the
other two groups.
   Smith, in an interview, said that his earlier studies have shown
that this same experiment conducted on the sleep cycle the third
night after learning a task gives about the same results. Sleep
deprivation the second night after learning, however, seems to have
no effect.
   This means, he said, that the students who party all night on
Friday after a tough week in school will lose 30 percent of the
learning they acquired on Wednesday and on Friday. If they also lose
sleep on Saturday, then Thursday's learning is also affected.
   ``There's a vulnerable time period (after learning),'' said
Smith. ``It has something to do with processing the material.''
   He said studies monitoring REM sleep have shown steep increases
in the length of such sleep on the first and third nights after
learning a major task. The brain, he said, apparently needs these
periods of rest to properly sort and store the information for later
recall. If the brain is deprived of these rest periods, then about a
third of the knowledge is lost forever.
   Complex tasks that require logical application of rules to new
situations are the most critically affected. He said this would take
in such subjects as math, physics, chemistry and foreign language.
Word-based learning seemed little affected, Smith said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people marched through a shopping
district to the unofficial Chinese Embassy on Saturday to deliver a
petition protesting the crackdown on dissent in China.
   The two-hour rally and march by at least 5,000 people was the
latest expression of anger by this British colony over Communist
China's suppression of the pro-democracy movement.
   The crackdown, which has included arrests and some executions,
has intensified fears over the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule
in 1997.
   Hong Kong protesters began their demonstration at Victoria Park,
where they gathered around a 33-foot-high replica of the ``Goddess
of Democracy'' statue, which stood in Beijing's Tiananmen Square
before the military moved in June 3-4 to disperse pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   After speeches decrying the arrests and executions in China, the
crowd marched through the Causeway Bay shopping district to the
local Xinhua News Agency office, which is Beijing's representative
in the colony.
   The marchers carried banners that read ``Support the Beijing
students' long-term struggle,'' ``Down with fascism,'' and ``Down
with Li Peng, Long live people power.''
   Li Peng, premier of China, is one of the hard-line conservatives
behind the suppression of the democracy movement.
   Leading pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong handed a petition
calling for the release of all those detained in the crackdown to a
Xinhua official. The crowd in front of the news agency's building
chanted, ``Protest! Protest!''
   Several marchers stopped and bowed in front of wreaths placed
across the street from the Xinhua building in honor of Chinese who
have died in the pro-democracy movement.

   A tranquil world away from the bloody violence
in her native China, 14-year-old artist Wang Yani squatted barefoot
on the Smithsonian gallery floor and demonstrated with lightning
brush and ink strokes why she is called ``a very rare phenomenon
anywhere in the world.''
   It took the slight, muscular girl in jean shorts slightly more
than a half-hour to fill her 8-foot-by-4-foot sheet of paper with
pigments and ink, which she dripped, poured, smeared, dabbed and
delicately brushed as she danced back and forth.
   ``In Yani's hands, the brush sings and the ink dances,'' said one
observer.
   Yani created a scene of two playful black monkeys _ her favorite
animals _ gathering pears under the gaze of flitting songbirds and
plump, dour hens.
   She called it ``The Happy Partners In the Orchard,'' stamped it
with her name seals in red and shyly smiled for the first time, as
the hushed crowd surrounding her in the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery
burst into applause.
   ``I'm finished,'' she said through an interpreter. ``I'm very
happy.''
   Her display of extraordinary artistic talent took place at a
press briefing last week before a collection of 69 of her paintings
goes on display Sunday for a four-month engagement at the Sackler, a
Smithsonian museum of Asian art.
   The show, ``Yani: the Brush of Innocence,'' will appear at the
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., from Dec. 16 to
Jan. 28 and will be seen at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco
next March 7 through April 29.
   The exhibition was organized by the Nelson-Atkins museum and is
sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Culture. The Chinese
government's violent crackdown on pro-democracy student
demonstrators in the past three weeks did not disrupt plans for the
show, as some Sackler officials had feared. Yani and her father flew
here from Beijing without incident.
   ``I have not felt there is going to be any effect on Yani in the
future,'' said her father, artist Wang Shiqiang, 44.
   Museum director Milo Beach said Yani is ``a true prodigy'' whose
fresh, spontaneous paintings of childlike humor and grace ``have an
ability to communicate that is not limited by geography or age.''
   She is the youngest artist to be honored with a one-person show
in Smithsonian history, Beach said.
   Jan Stuart, a Chinese art expert at the Sackler, said a prodigy
of Yani's gifts in the visual arts is ``a very rare phenomenon
anywhere in the world.''
   Born in a small village in rural Guiangxi province in southern
China, Yani started painting when she was 2. Her works were
exhibited in three Chinese cities when she was 4, and since have
been displayed in Japan, West Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong, London
and St. Petersburg, Fla.
   She has turned out an estimated 10,000 paintings, but never had
formal art training. She said she once took art classes in school,
but ``my work was disagreeable to my teacher, so I stopped going.''
   Her father, who is an oil painter, has refused to coach Yani and
even abandoned his own painting a few years ago to make sure she was
not influenced by his own style of Western realism. ``Teaching may
spoil her innate creativity,'' he said.
   ``Nature was her teacher,'' said Ms. Stuart. Yani said she was
intrigued by the animals at the local zoo, especially ``the monkeys
who are like children playing in kindergarten'' in the mountains and
gardens near her home.
   The exhibition starts with her brush-and-ink portrait of a
kitten, done at age 3, and includes a 35-foot handscroll titled ``A
Hundred Monkeys'' which she painted at age 9. As she grew older,
Yani's subjects have broadened to include her friends (``Yani's
Party''), flowers (``The Lotus Flowers Are So Pretty'') and
landscapes. Later, more complex works include ``Last Night I Dreamt
I Saw the Racing Egrets.''
   Most of Yani's paintings are stored in her home and none has been
sold privately, although 44 of the works that her family gave to the
Chinese government were sold to collectors, most of them in West
Germany, for an undetermined sum.
   Yani's father says he was told that four small Yani paintings
given to the Chinese postal service for a postage stamp design in
1983 were sold to an unknown stamp collector for $13,000.
   Yani will return to the Sackler in September to give painting
demonstrations for art teachers and school children. She will take
her paintings back to China, but may leave an original with the
Sackler, a museum spokeswoman said.

   A maid at an exclusive hotel won
her fight to work with unshaven legs and without pantyhose, the
Wellington Hotel Workers' Union said Saturday.
   Union secretary Peter Cullen said the unidentified maid at
Wellington's ritzy James Cook Hotel was threatened with suspension
unless she complied with new rules that appeared in a memo at the
same time new uniforms were issued.
   In the memo, the hotel said it insisted ``on regular leg
grooming. If you do not wish to groom your legs you will be required
to wear pantyhose.''
   The maid did not want to shave her legs or have to pay for
pantyhose, Cullen said.
   The union and hotel negotiated an agreement, and the maid will be
allowed to work without shaving her legs or wearing pantyhose, the
union said.
   James Cook duty manager Olivia Martin said staff were asked to
wear pantyhose but no action was to be taken against those who
refused.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anthony M. Kennedy, in his first full term as a
Supreme Court justice, is providing a consistent, crucial fifth vote
to what has become a muscular conservative majority.
   ``He's the tie-breaking vote in almost every important issue in
which the Supreme Court finds itself split,'' said a delighted
Daniel Popeo of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation.
   Patricia Ireland of the National Organization for Women said,
``What we feared has borne out. Justice Kennedy so far has proved a
disaster.''
   The court's 1988-89 term is entering its final week, and several
important decisions are pending. Two will give Kennedy a chance to
cast his first votes on the issues of abortion and church-state
relations. The court is closely divided on both.
   But Kennedy's voting pattern already is established, and it
offers some surprises.
   Perhaps most remarkable is that Kennedy statistically is a more
faithful voting ally of the court's conservative leader, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, than is Antonin Scalia, a fellow
appointee of former President Reagan.
   Scalia's judicial philosophy has been viewed as being far more
ideologically conservative than Kennedy's.
   But of this term's signed decisions not reached by a unanimous
court, Kennedy and Rehnquist voted together in 90 percent; Scalia
and Rehnquist were together in 86 percent.
   The number of 5-4 decisions to date this term is 27, down from
the 41 recorded during the 1986-87 term when Kennedy's seat was
occupied by the now-retired Lewis F. Powell.
   But of 33 key decisions tracked by The Associated Press, 14 have
come on 5-4 votes.
   The court's most difficult and important decisions often come as
its term winds down in June, and this year has been no different.
   Of 15 key decisions announced this month, the court has split 5-4
in 12 of them. Kennedy joined or led the majority in 10 of the 12.
   In those, the court:
   _Made it more difficult for minorities and women to prove
on-the-job bias by using statistics.
   _Expanded the power of white men to challenge court-approved
affirmative action plans helping minorities and women as unlawful
``reverse discrimination'' against them.
   _Shielded states and state officials from some civil rights
lawsuits.
   _Made it more difficult to sue cities when their employees
violate someone's civil rights.
   _Limited the scope of a key civil rights law, ruling that it does
not apply to racial or sexual harassment in employment.
   _Ruled that states may not be sued under a federal law aimed at
bettering the educational opportunities of handicapped people.
   _Said federal prosecutors may seize the assets of suspected
criminal defendants even if those assets were going to be used to
hire a lawyer.
   _Ruled that states are not obligated to provide free lawyers to
death row inmates who lose their initial round of appeals.
   In two of June's 5-4 decisions, Kennedy joined the court's
liberal wing to rule that burning the American flag is a
constitutionally protected form of political protest and that states
may be sued in federal courts for monetary damages in some
environmental cases.
   Scalia also was a member of the majority in the flag-burning
decision but the usually liberal-voting John Paul Stevens joined
Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor in
dissent.
   In most of the June 5-4 votes, the majority consisted of Kennedy,
Rehnquist, Scalia, White and O'Connor.
   The flag-burning vote aside, Popeo said, ``Kennedy is all that we
would have expected from Bork, and more.''
   Reagan's nomination of conservative Robert H. Bork to the Supreme
Court was rejected by the Senate in 1987. The president's second
choice, Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, had his nomination withdrawn
after news reports that he smoked marijuana while a law professor at
Harvard.
   ``Because of his demeanor, Kennedy might accomplish much more
than Bork,'' Popeo said. ``He is quietly effective, a builder of
coalitions.''
   Ms. Ireland of NOW agreed, saying Kennedy ``is a Bork with a
better style.''
   ``The term `red neck justice meted out with country club style'
seems to fit,'' she said.

   A large chunk of spacecraft has been
found in a remote section of northeastern Australia, and authorities
said Saturday it may be part of a French satellite.
   The debris was discovered on a remote farm about 1,100 miles
northwest of Brisbane. A police spokesman in the nearby town of
Conclurry said a helicopter would retrieve the wreckage, which was
found Friday.
   ``It is definitely of French origin,'' said the spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He would not disclose the size but said a nearby resident who had
seen it described the object as very large with two attached
cyclinders and two parachutes.
   A Brisbane police spokesman was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press as saying the ``French space junk'' was from
``Operation Globus,'' but refused to elaborate.
   France is heavily involved in the production of the Arianne
rocket and is part of a European space consortium that has captured
almost half the world's commercial satellite business.

factory north of the capital on Saturday, killing nine people and
injuring four, officials said.
   The cause of the blaze in Havelian, 40 miles north of Islamabad,
was not known and a high-level inquiry was ordered, Nawaz Gil,
chairman of the Pakistan Ordnance Factories Board, said.

   A gas pipeline ruptured in eastern
Pakistan and blew up, killing at least 12 people and injuring
hundreds, according to local news reports.
   Many of the dead from Friday's blast were believed to be
children, Pakistan's official news agency reported.
   Hundreds of people were injured and several houses razed in the
historical capital of Pakistan's populous Punjab province, the
Associated Press of Pakistan new agency said.
   It reported that witnesses heard a loud explosion and saw flames
engulf several houses, trapping sleeping occupants.
   The government-controlled Pakistan Times said gas continued to
feed the fire for 30 minutes before it was shut off. The newspaper
also said firefighters did not reach the scene for about half an
hour.

   An oil tanker from Uruguay carrying 19
million gallons of fuel ran aground early this morning in the
Delaware River just south of here, spilling an undetermined amount
of fuel, the Coast Guard said.
   ``At this point, we don't know what caused the ship to run
aground and we don't know how much oil has spilled,'' said Petty
Officer Tom Welch, with the Coast Guard's marine safety office in
Philadelphia.
   ``We're just trying to concentrate on getting as much oil as we
can pumped out of the ship and onto barges to prevent more oil from
leaking out,'' he said.
   Lt. Lewis Corcoran, also with the marine safety office, said
authorities received a report shortly before 5 a.m. that the tanker
Presidente Rivera, which was en route to Marcus Hook, Pa., had run
aground about a mile off shore.
   The vessel was carrying 19 million gallons, or more than 400,000
barrels, of No. 6 oil, which Corcoran described as a medium to heavy
fuel.
   ``Right now we're just trying to contain the oil with booms,''
Welch said. ``We haven't been able to determine this morning how
much oil has already spilled.''

<HEAD>Justice Investigates Kansas Company Accused of Stealing Oil From
Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is conducting a criminal
investigation of a Kansas-based company accused of stealing oil from
Indian-owned wells, a Senate committee spokesman says.
   The probe stems from information about Koch Industries Inc.
gathered by a special investigating committee of the Senate Select
Committee on Indian Affairs, spokesman Sam Hirsch said Friday.
   ``This has been referred to the U.S. attorney,'' confirmed Koch
spokesman George Pearson.
   He said, however, that Koch officials and representatives of the
U.S. attorney in Oklahoma City, Okla., would meet before a formal
investigation begins.
   ``They (the U.S. attorney's office) will have to make a decision
on whether to prosecute,'' said Pearson, director of public
relations for Koch.
   He said they may drop the probe after hearing Koch's side of the
story. He said no date had been set yet for the meeting.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Jones, in Oklahoma City, said her
office could ``neither confirm nor deny the existence of an ongoing
investigation.''
   The special Senate committee focused on Koch, the country's
largest independent oil purchaser, at a May 10 hearing in which
witnesses said Koch employees purposefully mismeasured oil from
wells on Indian lands.
   In a 57-page statement issued June 8, Koch said the committee
``unjustly defamed Koch and caused severe damage to its reputation
and business.''
   The lengthy document reviewed, point by point, the accusations
against the 49-year-old oil company, which is based in Wichita.
   It said the figures the committee used in its allegations were
inaccurate, and that comparisons with other companies were based on
noncomparable statistics.
   ``The committee stands firmly behind the findings released in its
May hearings,'' Hirsch said. ``The committee's investigators caught
Koch employees in the act of stealing oil on six separate occasions.
   ``Koch gaugers and supervisors also admitted to committee
investigators that it was company policy to mismeasure oil,'' he
said.
   Hirsch said documents the committee subpoenaed from Koch and
almost 30 other companies corroborated the committee's findings.
   He said Koch executives were presented the findings during closed
depositions and their responses were cited in the public hearings.
   ``Koch was also given the opportunity to testify in our public
hearings, but they would have been subject, of course, to cross
examination by the attorneys who conducted our investigation,'' said
Hirsch. Company representatives did not testify at the public
hearings.
   Hirsch said the committee would review Koch's June 8 statement
before making its final report, sometime this fall.
   The special committee has been investigating all areas of Indian
affairs and came upon the Koch case while probing federal agencies
assigned to protecting Indian lands.
   Pearson said the company ``never received a formal, informal,
verbal or written invitation'' to testify.
   When asked if the company requested an opportunity to speak,
Pearson said Koch did not feel it would be in its best interest to
appear at the hearing because of its format.
   ``We can be hurt at a hearing,'' he said. ``They (the committee)
can't be.''
   In congressional hearings, witnesses usually submit lengthy
written statements for the record and then are asked to summarize
their comments, followed by questioning from the members of Congress
and staff.
   Pearson said that, unlike in a court of law, those being
questioned have limited means to defend themselves and could be
greatly damaged if the hearing were televised.
   In its June 8 statement, Koch said the committee used ``anecdotal
evidence which was misleading at best and false at worst'' at the
hearing.
   Of witness Mary Limpy, a homeless Cheyenne-Arapaho, Koch said,
``Her problems obviously lie elsewhere and to suggest to this poor
lady that Koch is at fault is the height of demagoguery.''
   The woman claimed her financial problems stemmed from infrequent,
low royalty payments and that the leases on the wells in which she
had part interest were sold to Koch.
   ``We heard that the well had been capped for two years, but that
someone was stealing our oil because people saw trucks coming and
going from the allotment,'' Limpy said in her testimony.
   Pearson said Tenneco owned the leases and Koch bought the oil
from Tenneco. He said the wells were never capped.
   He also pointed out that many people had interests in the wells
and Limpy's share was a small fraction of the amount Tenneco paid
out to those people, explaining her small payments.
   Two other witnesses, Thurmon Parton and Arnita Parton Gonzalez
testified their royalty checks dropped from $3,000 to $1,000 a month
when Koch became involved with their leases. According to the
company's statement, the brother and sister saw an increase in their
payments.
   Koch officials blamed a dissident family member, William I. Koch,
for the trouble, saying he had a ``vendetta against Koch
Industries.''
   One of the witnesses who testified was an investigator who had
worked for William Koch, but a spokesman for William Koch said the
Senate committee made the first contact.
   ``In their zeal to get an oil company, and particularly one that
was politically unimportant, the staff obviously seized upon the
distorted information provided by William I. Koch, embellished it
with incorrect numbers, and, by withholding or ignoring evidence
favorable to Koch, produced a totally unfair and one-sided
hearing,'' Koch asserted in its statement.

<HEAD>Former President Praises Bush's Handling of China</HEAD>
<HEAD>By WALTER MEARS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Nixon has praised President Bush's
``measured response'' to the deadly crackdown on democracy
demonstrators in Beijing, urging the White House to stand firm
against ``a strange coalition of China-bashers'' who want harsh U.S.
action.
   Nixon, who as president reopened the door to China in 1972, said
punitive policies would be popular politically and satisfying
emotionally, but would have no impact on China's hard line Communist
leaders and would dash prospects for economic progress and eventual
political reform.
   ``If in our anger we drive China back into the shadows of the
Soviet Union and the oppressive economic system Deng Xiaoping has
tried to reform, those who have died for freedom in China will truly
have died in vain,'' Nixon said in an article written for the Los
Angeles Times Syndicate and distributed by his office.
   Nixon said his journey to China in 1972 was denounced by both the
right and the left, and Bush now faces criticism on both sides, too.
``Those on the far right who oppose any relations with China will
demand economic and diplomatic sanctions,'' he said. ``So will the
human rights lobby, which calls for punishing every regime that does
not live up to our standards regardless of our interests or those of
the millions living under those regimes, whom sanctions would hurt
the most.
   ``The Bush administration should continue to ignore these
extremist voices and stay the prudent course it has already set,''
he said.
   Bush has suspended military aid and limited contacts with the
Chinese government, but has resisted demands in Congress for more
stringent sanctions. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a
House committee that Bush is taking targeted steps, avoiding
inflammatory rhetoric and preserving options for future action.
   Nixon said that is the correct course. ``The Chinese got along
without the West for a quarter century and they could do so again,''
he said. ``If we force them back into their angry isolation from the
West, we risk prompting a potentially disastrous entente between the
two great Communist powers.''
   The ex-president said that would serve Moscow's interests, but no
others. He said Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev knows well that a
freeze between Washington and Beijing would hasten the thaw he seeks
with China.
   ``Whatever happens in the future, it is imperative that
Sino-American relations remain strong so the United States can help
maintain the balance among China, Japan and the Soviet Union,''
Nixon said.
   He said some Americans have gone overboard on China, seeing
rapprochement as a romance.
   ``China has a limitless capacity to fascinate,'' he said. ``But
it is not Disneyland. It is, as it has been since 1949, a Communist
dictatorship held together by brute force.
   ``No one who knows China should be surprised when its leaders
turn to violence to pursue their political goals,'' Nixon said.
``They have done far worse before Tiananmen Square.''

<HEAD>Senate Finance Committee To Consider Cutting Tax; Making Program
Optional</HEAD>

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said Saturday he will
propose cutting the surtax Medicare-eligible Americans pay for the
new catastrophic illness insurance, and said the Senate Finance
Committee also will consider making the program voluntary.
   Despite opposition from the Bush administration, Bentsen says
he's backing a ``substantial cut'' in the Medicare catastrophic
so-called supplemental premium that is based on income.
   The Finance chairman raised the possibility of cutting the tax
several months ago if projections of large surpluses in the
catastrophic fund were borne out. However, he previously had stopped
short of saying he actually would propose a rollback.
   Enacted less than a year ago, the catastrophic tax has been under
heavy fire from many older Americans in upper-income ranges and
those who receive catastrophic insurance protection paid by the
current or former employers.
   Bentsen said the panel will meet in July to consider reducing the
tax as well as making catastrophic health care coverage voluntary by
linking it to Part B of Medicare _ the physician payment program
that is financed 75 percent with general federal tax money.
   Since enacted this year, the catastrophic tax is estimated to
produce a surplus of $2 billion to $4 billion, Bentsen said.
   ``I just don't think that the government ought to be making a
profit off of the patients or the beneficiaries of this program, or
to use that surplus to try to balance the budget,'' said the Texas
Democrat.
   ``So I've set a hearing for July that will cover these points and
to decide whether it should be made voluntary again, and, in turn,
I'll be recommending a substantial cut in the premium,'' Bentsen
said.
   Under the Senate's original plan, beneficiaries would have been
able to drop Medicare coverage of physician fees and catastrophic
insurance. But by the time the bill was finally approved, the
catastrophic coverage was mandatory.
   Bentsen has yet to announce his position on the issue of making
catastrophic coverage optional.
   The surtax this year is 15 percent of a Medicare beneficiary's
federal income tax of $150 or more.
   It is currently estimated that 59 percent of all beneficiaries
will pay no supplemental premium in 1989, above the $4 basic fee,
Bentsen's office said.
   Only 5.6 percent will pay the maximum surtax, set this year at
$800, Bentsen's office said.
   The surtax is scheduled to be phased in through 1993; by then, it
could reach 28 percent of a beneficiary's federal income tax of $150
or more.
   During the five years ending in 1993, the Congressional Budget
Office now estimates, the surtax is likely to bring in about $10
billion more than is expected to be paid for catastrophic benefits.
   But administration officials have cautioned that the surplus may
never exist, because the new program of catastrophic drug benefits
starting in 1991 could cost far more than previously estimated.

   On the surface it is life as usual in Beijing.
Beneath the surface there is fear _ of sudden arrest, of the knock
on the door that means imprisonment or worse. Here is a report on
Beijing by an AP correspondent who reported on the pro-democracy
demonstrations and the army crackdown.

   Tiananmen Square has been scrubbed clean of the
blood and ashes that stained it the night of June 3-4, when
thousands of soldiers crushed student-led protests for a freer
society.
   The only signs of the violence are watchful soldiers brandishing
automatic rifles, bullet holes in walls and scars left in the road
by marauding army tanks.
   The burned-out hulks of hundreds of public buses and army trucks
have been towed away. New flower beds and freshly painted traffic
dividers and garbage bins adorn the 100-acre square, still closed to
the public.
   Many Chinese say it's only window dressing.
   ``On the surface it's calm, but below that it's very tense,''
said a college student in Beijing who participated in the
demonstrations at Tiananmen. ``Many people are worried they might be
arrested, like me.''
   More than 1,600 have been arrested since the crackdown began, and
27 people have been executed.
   The government has demonstrated an ability for surveillance never
so chillingly revealed in 40 years of communist rule. Television
news has shown secretly shot videotapes of people authorities say
spied for Taiwan, China's longtime enemy.
   Most scenes were of Tiananmen Square, where the accused were
shown watching marches along with hundreds of thousands of other
people.
   The message seemed to be that anybody could be on those tapes,
and anybody could be charged with being a counterrevolutionary.
   Resignation and sullen indifference have replaced the grass-roots
fervor that initially stopped the tanks of the People's Liberation
Army from advancing on Beijing.
   Many businesses still are running at half-pace, and much of
Beijing's usual ``floating population'' of 1 million peddlers and
outsiders looking for work has retreated to the countryside.
   ``Only about half the normal number of people are here,'' said a
sales clerk at the Dongan Market on the normally jammed Wangfujing
shopping street. ``Nobody is coming in from the provinces.''
   Tibetan merchants who once hawked monkey skulls, tiger and bear
paws and other animal parts for medicinal uses outside a foreigner's
compound have disappeared.
   Scarlet banners calling for people to support the Communist Party
and respect the army flutter from hotels, construction cranes and
overpasses.
   A month ago, Westerners in Beijing were symbols of freedom and
hope.
   ``America is great,'' people would say heartily, flashing
thumbs-up signs. ``Your democracy is the best in the world.''
   Crowds would part to let foreign journalists see insulting
caricatures of Chinese leaders or photograph corpses after the June
3-4 violence, which official Chinese reports say killed 200 to 300
people, including many soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as
3,000.
   An AP reporter who was chased and shot at by two soldiers for
photographing marching troops was cheered by a crowd when he emerged
from a parking lot where he had been hiding behind a van.
   Now foreigners are shunned.
   Commuters wheeling their bicycles past memorials for two soldiers
killed in the crackdown edged away uneasily when an American
approached. Large signs tell how the two soldiers were thrown off
bridges and, when they didn't die, set on fire by angry mobs.
   Witnesses said one soldier had shot to death a child and the
other had shot unarmed adults.
   ``Please don't sit here,'' a customer at an all-night restaurant
asked a Westerner. ``They see us talking to you and they'll haul us
in.''
   The proprietor of a nearby restaurant was bolder, inviting an
American to sit down and chat. Moments later, a platoon of soldiers
marched by and its officer said, ``Get these tables off the
sidewalk. They'd better be gone when we come back.''
   ``Let them come back, what do we care,'' said the manager. But he
moved the tables.
   Most people have become accustomed to the soldiers, who stare
blankly out from under their helmets as they stand guard at street
corners or patrol boulevards and back alleys.
   ``I'm just eating, I don't care about them,'' said a young man at
a restaurant on Changan Avenue, Beijing's main thoroughfare. ``They
mind their business and I mind mine.''
   Newscasts continue to show army officers, workers and even
students denouncing the pro-democracy movement, and there are signs
the propaganda campaign is working.
   ``There were a certain number of bad elements on the streets,''
said a 67-year-old man who has been repairing shoes on sidewalks for
50 years. ``The soldiers aren't after me, they're not after you.
They're after the evildoers.''
   But non-believers are legion.
   ``Not a single shot was fired in the square, and not one person
died there,'' said a hired driver, reciting the government line.
``That's all we're allowed to say.''
   Those who were on the streets or within earshot of the thunderous
rifle reports of June 3-4 say they will never forget.
   ``This used to be our square of democracy,'' a college student
said, looking across Tiananmen toward the Great Hall of the People.
``Now it's their square of dictatorship.''

<TEXT>
   A U.S. military court on Saturday
sentenced an Army soldier to 30 years in prison for passing
sophisticated defense secrets to communist East Germany.
   Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri had pleaded guilty to espionage charges
during his court-martial and could have received a maximum sentence
of life in prison.
   The judge, Col. Craig C. Jacobsen, said during sentencing that
under a pretrial agreement, Peri's term would be reduced to 25 years
for good behavior during the first three years of confinement.
   Peri, 22, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., showed no emotion as Jacobsen
read the sentence. The soldier's parents, Fred and Winnie Peri,
bowed their heads.
   After the sentencing, Peri was led in shackles to a van that
whisked him away. Officials said he would be taken to a detention
center in Mannheim.
   The case automatically goes to a review panel and must be
approved by the U.S. Army's 5th Corps, which has clemency power and
can reduce the sentence.
   The court-martial also stripped Peri of his rank, ordered that
all pay and benefits be forfeited and gave him a dishonorable
discharge.
   Peri had also pleaded guilty to several lesser charges, including
being absent without leave and entering a restricted zone without
permission.
   In final arguments Saturday, chief prosecutor Maj. Michael D.
Graham said Peri ``just flat sold out his country.''
   ``He kissed off his friends, he kissed off his family, he kissed
off his unit and then he kissed off his country,'' Graham said.
   Peri's civilian defense lawyer, Michael Christensen, countered:
``He had courage to come back to face a life sentence and is
probably as courageous as any soldier in battle.''
   In testimony Friday, Peri broke down in tears and pleaded for
forgiveness. He said he received no money from the East Germans.
   When his court-martial opened Wednesday, Peri pleaded guilty to
charges he gave crucial information on U.S. electronic defense
capabilities to East Germany.
   Peri worked as an electronic signal interceptor in the S-2
intelligence section of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda,
part of the U.S. Army's V Corps. He disappeared from his unit Feb.
20 and crossed the border into East Germany with a small computer
and discs containing classified information.
   Peri voluntarily returned March 4 and was arrested.
   In court Friday, Peri said he came back ``because I couldn't
handle leaving my parents behind, my friends behind. Taking what I
had coming was better.''
   Under questioning from his military attorney, Maj. William G.
Stokes, Peri cited job pressures and a lack of privacy in Army life
as the reasons for his actions. Stokes declined to comment on the
sentencing after Saturday's hearing.
   Peri said that during his stay in East Germany, communist
security officials in civilian clothes interrogated him at a house
north of East Berlin.
   Just before leaving East Germany, Peri said he asked communist
officials to return the computer and discs, and they complied.
   U.S. military prosecutors say it appears the East Germans copied
the discs.

<TEXT>
   A stringent air cleanup plan considered by
some a model for the nation has been shelved at least temporarily by
state officials who fear it won't work unless it gains wider support.
   The state Air Resources Board, citing mistrust between regional
air quality officials and business and environmentalist leaders,
voted 6-1 Friday to postpone action on the plan for 60 days.
   ``I'm troubled by the perceptions of this plan I continue to hear
from business and local government,'' said Jananne Sharpless, the
board's chairwoman.
   The plan would cut emissions from vehicles, businesses and
residences about 80 percent in an effort to make the air in Southern
California healthy again by 2007. It would also place restrictions
on the use of such consumer products as aerosol sprays and barbecue
lighter fluids.
   Officials of the South Coast Air Quality Management District,
which encompasses Los Angeles County and three counties to the south
and west, have estimated the plan would cost $2.6 billion a year.
Business estimates have placed the cost as high as $12 billion.
   In delaying a vote, the board ordered the district to outline how
it plans to account for the costs businesses will face. The board
also wants to know how cities and counties will be persuaded to
cooperate in enforcement.
   ``We have to ensure this plan can be implemented,'' Ms. Sharpless
said. ``We want a plan that works.''
   If adopted by the state board, appointed by Gov. George
Deukmejian, the plan also would require approval from the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Ms. Sharpless, who is Deukmejian's environmental affairs
secretary, said the governor did not advise her to reject the plan,
but said he wanted the concerns of business better addressed.
   ``The governor is concerned about the impact on the economy,''
she said.

   Residents of Denver's northern suburbs are
co-existing a little more uneasily with Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant these days, but say an investigation at the facility is cause
for concern, not hysteria.
   ``We're all concerned, naturally,'' said Omar Joseph, who has
lived and worked in Arvada for 23 years. ``What are you going to do?
As a citizen you just hold your breath and hope for the best.''
   ``We're not panicky by any means,'' said Earl McGuire of
Broomfield. ``We are mad for the simple reason that I think we're
being lied to.''
   The investigation was made public June 6 when 75 FBI and
Environmental Protection Agency agents raided the plant 16 miles
northwest of Denver. The on-scene inquiry wound up last week.
Authorities have said it will take at least six months to analyze
the evidence collected during the two-week search.
   An affidavit filed in Denver U.S. District Court alleges that
hazardous wastes were burned illegally in a plant incinerator and
were dumped late last year into creeks feeding into water supplies
for Broomfield, Westminster, Thornton and Northglenn.
   A group of 16 anti-nuclear and peace organizations has demanded
that Gov. Roy Romer close the plant. Other groups, such as the
Denver Medical Society, supported Romer's successful effort to give
the state authority to more strictly monitor the plant, which is
under federal contract.
   The probe has had little visible effect on day-to-day life in the
nearby suburbs of Broomfield, Westminster and Arvada, where 155,000
of metropolitan Denver's roughly 1.6 million residents live.
   But people in those suburbs are concerned, particularly about the
safety of their water, city leaders and residents say. Sales of
bottled and distilled water systems are up.
   ``My gut feeling is that the people in Broomfield have accepted
it and the city has been very responsive,'' said Marty Miller,
editor of the weekly Broomfield Enterprise newspaper. ``I'm getting
more letters over an animal impound issue we have here than over
Rocky Flats.''
   ``We've been in Broomfield since 1964 and we've known Rocky Flats
has been there all along,'' said resident Larry Cooper. ``Our water
supply is always in jeopardy because we are so close to it.
   ``I really expected a lot more panic,'' he said. ``Everybody is
concerned; everybody knows Rocky Flats is there. Let's make sure we
know what they're doing there and let's clean it up.''
   ``I think there's a group that certainly is concerned about the
overall environmental safety, taking a wait-and-see attitude to see
what the investigation will produce,'' said Westminster City Manager
Bill Christopher. ``There also is a silent element that is not
expressing concern, not jumping up and down, not demanding the
closure of the plant, not very concerned with what's been in the
media.
   ``There also is a very small vociferous group that is demanding
the closure of the plant, and we've heard from those people for the
last few years,'' he said.
   Established in the early 1950s, the plant _ a large complex of
buildings surrounded by a buffer zone, the whole site covering 11
square miles _ manufactures triggers for nuclear weapons. It has
been a source of controversy in the metropolitan area for two
decades.
   Whenever public safety concerns surfaced, the federal government
reassured the public that the facility posed no health threat. A
wave of concern erupted in 1957, when a fire and explosion in a
plutonium-reprocessing building released an undetermined amount of
plutonium into the atmosphere; and again in 1969 when a fire caused
about $70 million in damage.
   In the 1970s, then-Jefferson County Health Director Dr. Carl
Johnson began studies of the plant's impact. He later published
papers in which he claimed the cancer rate among nearby residents
shot up in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Today, about 5,000 people work at the plant, and many live in the
nearby towns, which were established primarily as bedroom
communities. Recently, the towns have taken steps to attract
business and industry and diversify their economic base. The plant
is managed by Rockwell International Corp. for the Department of
Energy.
   The news of the latest investigation initially triggered hundreds
of calls to the Broomfield city offices, which opened a hotline to
reassure citizens that tests proved the water was safe. But a week
or so later, no one addressed the issue during a city council
meeting.
   McGuire said he purchased bottled water after learning of the
alleged contamination, but his family is returning to tap water
because of uncertainty over what type of elements are in bottled
water.
   Laurie Kappler, who has lived in Broomfield for five years, and
has drunk tap water during that time, said, ``It's not going to make
a difference to buy bottled water now.''
   ``As far as what has happened, we will probably go on living our
lives the same way as before,'' said David Smith, president of the
Broomfield Chamber of Commerce. ``As far as business and economic
development is concerned, the damage has been done.
   ``We're not born with four arms out here,'' he said. ``This is
not a war zone.''

   China's Communist Party fired its moderate leader,
Zhao Ziyang, on Saturday and replaced him with a Shanghai party boss
who moved swiftly to quell pro-democracy protests in his city.
   The new general secretary of the 47-million-member party is Jiang
Zemin, 62, a university-educated technocrat who has served as mayor
and party secretary of Shanghai, China's largest city.
   The first three executions following the crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement occurred in Shanghai.
   The party also purged Hu Qili, who shared the 69-year-old Zhao's
sympathy for the student-led movement for a freer society and served
with him on the Politburo Standing Committee, the nation's
highest-ranking political body.
   Zhao's status had been in limbo for more than a month. He was
last seen in public when he met with student protesters, whose
7-week-old movement was crushed in a crackdown that began June 3.
   The party's 276-member Central Committee also removed Zhao from
the 17-member ruling Politburo and its Standing Committee, from the
175-member policy-making Central Committee, and from the Central
Military Commission.
   He apparently was allowed to keep his party membership.
   A party communique, released by the official Xinhua News Agency,
said ``that at a critical juncture involving the destiny of the
party and the state, comrade Zhao Ziyang made the mistake of
supporting the turmoils and splitting the party, and he had
unshirkable responsibilities for the shaping-up of the turmoils.''
   The party said it will maintain its policies of reform and
greater openness with the rest of the world. It also pledged to work
for greater democracy and an end to corruption, the main demands of
the student protesters.
   The report on Zhao's ouster was read by his rival, Premier Li
Peng, who joined with senior leader Deng Xiaoping to consolidate the
power of hard-liners determined to use force to crush the
pro-democracy movement.
   Zhao reportedly was stripped of power after opposing Deng's
decision to declare martial law in Beijing on May 20. Zhao was last
seen in public the day before, when he made a dramatic, tearful
visit to students on a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square.
   The party's communique said he took a ``passive approach'' to
opposing bourgeois liberalization, or support of Western ideas, and
``gravely neglected party building.''
   It acknowledged, however, that Zhao ``did something beneficial to
the reform, the opening of China to the outside world.''
   The communique did not accuse him of being a
counterrevolutionary, a charge leveled at many of the 1,800
civilians arrested since the crackdown began. The government has
executed 27 of them.
   Zhao gained national acclaim with his rural reforms in Sichuan
province in the late 1970s. He became a Deng protege and was named
premier in 1980. He was appointed party general secretary in 1987,
succeeding the late Hu Yaobang.
   Hu, another Deng protege, was purged following accusations that
he was soft on student demonstrations. Hu's death April 15 triggered
the latest round of demonstrations.
   Jiang, a university graduate who spent time in the Soviet Union
in the 1950s and speaks Russian and English, served as electronics
industry minister and in various other technical posts before being
named mayor of Shanghai in 1985. He relinquished that position to
become Shanghai party secretary last year.
   Like Zhao, he is comfortable around foreigners and has backed
China's open-door policy by working to attract foreign investment to
help revitalize Shanghai's antiquated industrial base.
   Politically, however, he is considered a hard-liner.
   During the student protests he tried to censor Shanghai's World
Economic Herald, then China's most liberal newspaper, and he moved
quickly to stifle unrest in Shanghai that followed the military
crackdown in Beijing.
   Jiang is believed to be the son-in-law of Li Xiannian, a former
president and one of the Old Guard hard-liners who rallied behind
Deng's decision to suppress the student movement with force.
   Jiang also joined the Politburo Standing Committee, which was
expanded from five to six members.
   Replacing Zhao and Hu Qili were Jiang, Tianjin Mayor Li Ruihuan
and economist Song Ping, who heads the party Organization Department.
   The other members of the Standing Committee are Qiao Shi, the
party security man who had been widely pegged to succeed Zhao,
conservative economist Yao Yilin and Premier Li.
   The party shakeup was not expected to have any immediate effect
on its policy of promoting foreign investment and expanding China's
economic relations with other countries.
   The Central Committee's communique said China ``must not return
to the old closed-door path.''
   While it said the party must work for democratic and legal
reforms, it demanded loyalty to conservative ideals. The party must
``carry out education in patriotism, socialism, independence and
self-reliance, plain living and hard work, and oppose bourgeois
liberalization in real earnest,'' the committee said.
   The communique said the Politburo met from Monday through
Wednesday and the Central Committee, which makes all decisions on
leadership positions, met on Friday and Saturday.

<HEAD>Before Killing Himself, Boy Called Shooting `a Nightmare'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before turning the gun on himself, a
14-year-old boy wrote a note to his mother saying that shooting his
12-year-old brother to death was ``a nightmare,'' authorities say.
   ``Mom, I accidentally shot Clay. It's a nightmare, so I killed
myself,'' read the note that Damien Bienash left on the back of a
cash register receipt on the dining room table.
   The one-line statement was found when the boys' mother, Judy
Bienash, 36, returned home Thursday afternoon and found the bodies
of her sons Damien and Clay.
   Police and Rock County's chief deputy coroner, Richard Messner,
concluded that the deaths were a murder-suicide although friends and
relatives of the victims disputed the notion.
   Authorities said a quarrel over baseball cards may have led
Damien to shoot his younger brother with a gun that had been a gift
to the older boy from his father.
   ``There are only two people who could tell us why it happened,
and they are both dead,'' Police Lt. Larry Loveland said.
   But Christine Dunham, an aunt, said Friday that the incident
``was an accident, a total accident. It is not like them at all.
They loved each other too dearly. They always looked out for each
other.''
   According to police reports, Clay was shot ``basically square in
the face,'' indicating the shot from Damien may have been aimed. A
knife was found near Clay's right hand, and there were signs,
including a large fan that was tipped over, that indicated there may
have been a struggle, Messner said.
   A number of baseball cards were found on the floor near Clay's
feet.
   Police said the boys were quarreling over baseball cards before
their mother left earlier in the day.
   ``Clay, apparently, was an avid baseball card collector,''
Loveland said, ``and Damien grabbed a handful of them. That may not
have been the cause (of the shooting), but that's the last thing the
mother saw.''
   ``Apparently they had had altercations off and on,'' Messner
said. ``I think they were awfully good kids, but had altercations a
little more often than normal.''
   Messner said a single-shot, 20-gauge shotgun, a gift to Damien
from his father, was used in the shootings. The parents are
divorced. The boys' aunt said the boy had taken a hunter safety
course.
   The deaths, coupled with a shooting in Milwaukee on Thursday
evening in which a boy critically wounded a friend while playing
with a gun, led to renewed calls at the state Capitol for a
Florida-style gun law.
   The law passed last week in Florida after a spate of child
shootings there imposes penalties on adults who allow loaded weapons
to come into the hands of children and allows authorities to
prosecute the adult for a felony if a child's play with a weapon
results in death or injury.

<UNK>Gorbachev Protege, Minister Candidates, Rejected by Soviet Legislature</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislative committee rejected the nomination of
a protege of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to head the government's
food program, Radio Moscow reported Saturday.
   The rejection is the latest indication that the recently
reorganized Supreme Soviet was breaking from its traditional role of
automatically approving decisions of the ruling elite.
   Radio Moscow said Vladimir I. Kalashnikov failed to win a Supreme
Soviet committee's endorsement as first deputy premier. Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov nominated Kalashnikov on June 10, saying he had
vast experience in agriculture and should head a new government
Commission on Food and Purchases.
   Kalashnikov began his Communist Party career under Gorbachev in
Stavropol, serving as agriculture chief in the region while
Gorbachev was party chief there.
   His most recent jobs have been party chief in Volgograd and
member of a party agriculture commission.
   Radio Moscow did not say why or when the committee rejected
Kalashnikov but noted the full legislature still could approve him.
   The committees began hearings on Monday on 13 Ryzhkov aides and
more than 50 ministers in an exercise of the new powers they gained
under Gorbachev's political reforms.
   The 542-member Supreme Soviet is to meet for 40 days to confirm
the appointees and begin drafting legislation.
   Legislative committees also turned down the nomination of Polad
A. Polad-Zade, who was recommended for promotion from first deputy
to minister of land reclamation and water resources, Radio Moscow
said.
   Committees also rejected Vladimir G. Gribov, who was to move from
his post as a department chief in the state planning agency,
Gosplan, to chairman of the board of the state bank.
   Also rejected was the nomination of Vasily G. Zakharov to
continue as culture minister, a post he has held for nearly three
years, Radio Moscow reported.
   Also Saturday, the Tass news agency released a resolution adopted
by the Soviet parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, that
calls for major improvements in the economy. The resolution was
adopted during the Congress' inaugural sesssion from May 25 to June
9.
   The resolution, outlined for the first time on Saturday, demands
improvements in housing, food and consumer goods.
   The Congress is a bicameral part-time legislature that was
created as part of the Gorbachev's social reforms. Elections earlier
this year included opposition candidates and represented the first
contested elections under communist rule.
   The Supreme Soviet is a standing legislature made up of Congress
members that was given broader powers by Gorbachev.

   Syrian and Christian gunners on Saturday
fought their fiercest artillery duels in a month around Beirut and
the surrounding mountains. Police said three people were wounded.
   A police spokesman said the shelling declined after daybreak into
intermittent mortar exchanges across the capital's dividing Green
Line.
   He said two men and a woman were wounded before dawn in Christian
east Beirut, which was hammered all night by Syrian gunners deployed
in the city's western Moslem sector.
   The casualty toll from the 14-week confrontation between
Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's units and the Syrians
stood at 373 people killed and 1,460 wounded.
   The coastline north of Beirut took the brunt of the Syrian
barrage, which was aimed at maintaining a blockade of the
310-square-mile Christian heartland.
   A police spokesman said Aoun's gunners fired back at Syrian
artillery emplacements along west Beirut's seaside boulevard.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with police rules,
said about 520 shells and rockets exploded in Beirut's two sectors
and the Christian coastline in a 12-hour period.
   It was a sharp escalation of the daily shelling that has marked
the Syrian-Christian confrontation since an Arab summit called for a
cease-fire on May 26.
   The fierce clashes followed Aoun's call Friday for international
pressure on Syria to lift its siege of the Christian enclave.
   The Syrians began battering the area March 14, eight days after
Aoun ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by Syrian-backed
militias south of Beirut.
   Syria keeps 40,000 troops stationed across 70 percent of the
country under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Moslem and Christian governments have been competing for power in
Lebanon since September, when outgoing President Amin Gemayel named
Aoun head of an interim Christian cabinet.
   Moslems and leftists refused to accept Aoun's appointment and
pledged allegiance to acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni
Moslem who governed during Gemayel's presidency.
   Meanwhile, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said it
lost five ``martyrs'' in a confrontation with Israeli troops and
allied militiamen of the South Lebanon Army in the Bekaa valley on
Friday.
   The party said four of its fighters were wounded and four others
were missing.
   About 1,500 Hezbollah members chanting ``Death to America, death
to Israel,'' took part in a funeral procession in the Bekaa valley
town of Mashgara for the slain guerrillas.
   The Moslem cabinet in Lebanon's dual government said in a
statement it instructed Lebanon's U.N. envoy, Rachid Fakhoury, to
lodge a complaint with the U.N. Security Council about the ``Israeli
aggression.''
   Lebanese police said about 300 Israeli soldiers and South Lebanon
Army militiamen in 35 armored personnel carriers launched the sweep
of Hezbollah strongholds.
   Israeli military officials said Friday four guerrillas were
killed and one Israeli was slightly wounded in the clash.

   Here are brief sketches of the six members of the
Standing Committee of the Communist Party Politburo, the
highest-ranking political body in the nation.
   _Li Peng, 60. Promoted to premier from vice premier in 1987, the
hard-line Li and senior leader Deng Xiaoping were behind the
decisions to impose martial law in Beijing and send in troops to
suppress pro-democracy demonstrators. A Soviet-trained technocrat,
Li spent most of his career in power and engineering fields. He
served as minister of the power industry and joined the party's
Central Committee in 1982 and the Politburo in 1985. He is the
adopted son of former Premier Chou En-lai and his widow, Deng
Yingchao.
   _Jiang Zemin, 62. Named Saturday to replace ousted Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang, Jiang is a former mayor of Shanghai,
China's largest city, and Shanghai's party chief since 1988. He took
a firm stance against the pro-democracy protests that spread to
Shanghai, where the first death sentences during the uprising were
meted out. He generally is aligned with the economic moderates who
support the open-door policy toward foreign investment and
revitalizing industry. Jiang is reportedly a son-in-law of former
President Li Xiannian, who backed the martial law order and
subsequent suppression of the democracy movement.
   _Qiao Shi, 65. He was considered the front-runner to take Zhao's
place as party chief because of his prominent role in party and
government functions after the June 3-4 crackdown on the protesters.
Head of the party's security apparatus and other powerful party
departments, little is known of his political leanings, though he is
believed to be a political conservative and neutral on economic
reform. He has been a party member since he was 16. Like many
Chinese officials, Qiao was purged during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution. He re-emerged to head the party's International Liaison
Department in 1981. He was elected to the Politburo in 1985, became
a vice premier in 1986 and joined the Standing Committee in 1987.
   _Yao Yilin, 72. The senior vice premier, Yao is considered a
pragmatist on economic reform though he is associated with the
political conservatives. A specialist in trade and commerce, Yao was
a pro-communist student activist at prestigious Qinghua University.
He was a regional party official during the 1937-45 war with Japan
and later joined the trade ministry. He was named minister of
commerce in 1960, purged during the Cultural Revolution, and renamed
to the post after that decade of revolutionary turmoil. He was named
a vice premier in 1979 and was minister of the State Planning
Commission from 1980-83.
   _Song Ping, 72. Having studied agriculture at Beijing and Qinghua
Universities, Song was among the better educated of the early
revolutionaries. He held a variety of ideological and bureaucratic
posts and moved to the State Planning Commission in 1952, the Gansu
provincial military command area in the 1970s and returned to
Beijing to be vice minister of the planning commission in 1981.
Responsible for economic planning in the 1980s, he presented
economic reports to the National People's Congress four times. Most
recently he was head of the party's Organization Department.
   _Li Ruihuan, 54. An ex-carpenter and model worker, Li has been
Tianjin's mayor since 1982. He spent much of his career in
construction- and timber-related fields. He joined the Politburo in
1987 and has since been regarded as one of China's rising new
leaders. In 1980 Li was appointed secretary of the Communist Youth
League, and in 1982 he became vice mayor of Tianjin. As mayor he has
actively promoted foreign investment and increased foreign trade
through Tianjin, a major port city. His carpentry background has
earned him the nickname ``Luban,'' a demigod who protected
construction workers in Confucian times.

   A volunteer firefighter says he and a
friend firebombed a small chemical plant with gasoline they got from
the fire station because they believed the plant was harming the
environment.
   He said in a police affidavit that he did not intend for the
blaze to get ``out of hand.''
   Michael A. Legge, 19, a probationary volunteer for the Bethany
fire department, was in jail Saturday unable to post $40,000 bail.
His friend, Brian S. Golembowski, 22, a self-employed landscaper
also of Bethany, was free after posting $30,000 bond following their
arraignment Friday on charges of first-degree arson, conspiracy to
commit first-degree arson and first-degree reckless endangerment. If
convicted, they could face maximum prison terms of from 12 to 46
years and fines of $21,000 each.
   Neither man has yet entered a plea. Golembowski has denied parts
of Legge's version given to police.
   The fire early Monday at Carbolabs Inc. in rural Bethany spewed a
cloud of noxious smoke that forced the evacuation of as many as 200
people and sickened 14 firefighters, who were treated for
respiratory complaints. One firefighter was hospitalized.
   The arsonists ``did more environmental damage in one hour than we
did in 22 years'' of business, said Dr. Philip Pivawer, a Carbolabs
owner.
   Legge, who lives three-quarters of a mile from Carbolabs, said in
the affidavit that he telephoned state police to report the fire as
soon as he got home early Monday morning because he did not want the
fire ``to get out of hand.''
   Legge was questioned by state police after the resident trooper
in Bethany identified his voice on the tape recording of the call
made to report the fire. The trooper recently had arrested Legge for
an unspecified offense.
   Golembowski told police he was with Legge when he prepared
several homemade bombs known as Molotov cocktails. But he said he
refused to take part in the firebombing or to even drive Legge to
the laboratory, as Legge said occurred.
   Attorney Steven Ecker, who represented Golembowski at his
arraignment, told the court that what ``might have begun as a game
or a prank indeed escalated into something serious.''
   Legge said in the affidavit that before making the Molotov
cocktails, they went to the fire station to pick up a two-gallon can
of gas used to run emergency generators. A search of Legge's home
turned up two red gas cans marked BVFD, for the Bethany Volunteer
Fire Department.

   The United States must step up its attention to
such environmental issues as drought management, infrastructure
repair, global warming and solid waste disposal to mitigate the
pollution that threatens its people, an administration report says.
   ``We must do better,'' President Bush said, putting in a plug for
recycling of wastes in a message accompanying a report by the White
House advisory Council on Environmental Quality.
   The 420-page report urged movement on the controversial issue of
global warming, on which some in the administration have cited
differing scientific opinions and shown reluctance to accept dire
predictions regarding the so-called greenhouse effect.
   The report, put together over a two-year period and forwarded to
Congress late Friday, states that the government might find it
necessary to plan ``future projects considering climate change even
before all the uncertainties are known.''
   Bush said significant strides have been made by the federal and
local governments as well as the private sector ``to address
pollution and environmental degradation'' with such steps as auto
emissions standards.
   ``But we can do better,'' he wrote in a message to Congress.
``That is why we are committed to cleaner air in the nation's
cities,'' he said, noting that he has proposed a clean air package
to deal with acid rain, airborne toxics and auto-produced smog.
   In addition, he said, ``This country must make every effort to
stem the rising tide of garbage and industrial waste through a more
aggressive use of waste minimization and recycling practices.''
   Bush said recycling should start with separation of garbage in
homes and in local communities.
   The report, an assessment of the nation's environmental status
for the years 1987-88 drawn from a variety of agency and military
studies and scientific reports, makes clear the Bush administration
will not assume the full burden of environmental protection. It
calls on state and local governments as well as business to share
the responsibility.
   For instance, more than half the nation's municipal landfills
``make no attempt to control water pollution resulting from the
runoff of rain water from their sites,'' the report says. ``Less
than half impose restrictions on receipt of bulk liquid wastes.
These and other practices suggest that a large portion of landfilled
municipal solid waste ends up in places where it might contaminate
ground water.''
   It notes further that the country has thousands of old dumping
sites in the middle of residential areas, and that the federal
government's Superfund cleanup program will share responsibility for
only a handful of them.
   Regarding the nation's infrastructure, the report says such
facilities as navigation channels and ports, flood control works,
mass transit systems, water supply, wastewater and solid waste
facilities are ``barely adequate to fulfill current requirements and
insufficient to meet the demands of future economic growth and
development.''
   Given the experience of the 1988 drought, in which extensive
dredging and water control management was required to keep inland
waterways open for commerce, the report notes that ``formal, planned
drought management has not been a major federal focus,'' and that it
will be an important water resources issue in the future.
   The report takes a cautious approach to the greenhouse effect, in
which carbon dioxide and other gases in the earth's atmosphere trap
radiant heat near the planet's surface. In addition to natural
buildup, the gases have increased dramatically because of burning
coal, oil, and gas, as well as the destruction of tropical rain
forests.
   In light of the massive economic upheaval that would be caused if
the government found it necessary to declare war on the greenhouse
effect, the administration has taken the position that evidence is
inconclusive on whether the trend is as serious as some analysts
have found.
   Noting the disagreements, the CEQ report says the scientific
evidence is ``evolving'' on the extend of global warming and its
potential impact on weather patterns.
   ``It may be necessary, however, to plan future projects
considering climate change even before all the uncertainties are
known,'' the report said. ``In the interim, support of necessary new
research and thorough evaluation of ongoing and completed research
is needed.''
   The three-member Council on Environmental Quality was established
in 1970 to advise the president on environmental matters and has few
statutory powers. One of President Reagan's first acts was to slash
its staff, and the council did little during his presidency.
   Bush so far has not shown an inclination to raise the council's
profile. However, environmentalists were heartened when the
president tapped Michael R. Deland, to be its new chairman. He was
the Boston area administrator for the Environmental Protection
Agency and is known as a strong environmentalist.

<HEAD>At Least 31 Die, 50 Hurt as Highway Collapses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 31 people died Saturday
and 50 were seriously hurt when a rural highway caved in and two
crowded buses tumbled into a 100-foot hole, rescue officials said.
   The accident occurred at 2:30 a.m. near the rural town of
Estancia, about 1,150 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro. Estancia is
in the state of Sergipe.
   The buses, each jammed with 48 travelers, were making the
56-hour, 2,030-mile trek from the southeastern city of Sao Paulo to
Natal, federal police officer Luis Fernando Borges Santos told The
Associated Press by telephone from Estancia.
   ``They were riding along a high ridge when the road simply gave
way beneath them,'' said Borges Santos, who assisted rescue workers
at the scene. ``A hole the diameter of two buses opened up and
sucked them down the drop. It's pitch black out on that highway _
the drivers probably never saw a thing.''
   ``It's a miracle anyone survived at all,'' he said.
   One driver was killed, and the other was pulled from the wreckage
by rescue workers, Santos said.
   A rescue team of 50 civil and federal police and firefighters was
digging through the mud in search of bodies and possible survivors.
   ``We've pulled 31 mutilated corpses from the mud and we think
there must be dozens more buried underneath,'' said Santos. He said
no foreigners were on board the buses.
   TV film footage on Globo TV, the nation's largest commercial
network, showed helmeted rescue workers with spades and hoes hacking
through earth and pulling mud-covered bodies from the wrecks.
   Firefighter Carlos Enrique de Oliveira told the AP that heavy
rains in the region over the past week probably caused the highway
to fall away.
   ``That region is hilly and the earth beneath on both sides of the
drop that runs alongside the highway was already loose and
crumbling,'' said de Oliveira. ``The rains turned the ground into
putty.''

<HEAD>Who Killed Bruce Bailey? Plenty of Suspects, No Answers</HEAD>

   In 20 years of running roughshod through New York
as a tenants' rights activist, Bruce Bailey turned landlords into
enemies. He turned drug dealers into enemies. But he also turned
friends into enemies.
   One of his enemies murdered and dismembered Bailey on June 14.
Police are still trying to determine which one.
   ``We know there are a lot of people who don't like him,'' said
Detective Chief Joseph G. DeMartino, who is heading the
investigation into the slaying that ended Bailey's two-decade tenure
as an Upper West Side gadfly.
   Bailey, 54, was on his way to a tenants organization meeting when
he disappeared. Parts of his body were found a day later in several
garbage bags in the Bronx, with his limbs and head severed. Police,
acting on a tip, searched a Staten Island landfill Saturday for the
head.
   ``One fact is crystal clear to those who knew Bruce's life and
work: This is no random act of violence,'' said a statement issued
by his wife, Nellie Hester, and their two children. ``This was a
deliberate political murder, no different from the acts of a death
squad in El Salvador.
   ``We strongly believe that some real estate thug found, as all
the others have, that Bruce couldn't be bought, couldn't be
frightened, couldn't be discouraged. But he could, of course, be
killed.''
   His slaying produced an outpouring of grief and support from some
of the people he assisted. A bouquet of five roses was left outside
the door of the Columbia Tenants Union, which Bailey headed. ``5
Roses from Apt. 5E'' read the card.
   ``He saved our building and many others. The building was a
disaster before he came in, and he helped us put it back together,''
said Esther Bishop of the 125th Street tenants group that Bailey was
scheduled to meet the night he was killed.
   While Bailey was praised by many, others suggested his pro-tenant
work was just a way of exploiting an issue for personal gain.
   Bailey has been in New York since his college years, when he
transferred to Columbia University after a year at Ohio State
University. He joined the Columbia Tenants Union in Manhattan a
short time later; at the time of his death, he was its chairman and
only paid staff member.
   When Bailey first became active in tenants rights, ``you could
count on Bruce to show up with the troops,'' recalled former state
assemblywoman Marie Runyon, a one-time Bailey associate who wound up
at odds with him.
   He soon gained a reputation as someone willing to take on a
fight, organizing rent strikes, filing lawsuits and ripping
landlords as ``vicious and treacherous'' as they battled
head-to-head.
   But there was a darker side to Bailey. He was accused of
anti-Semitism by Holocaust survivor and fellow Columbia Union member
John Ranz, who was later shoved down a staircase by two men at
Bailey's order. Bailey was convicted of the crime and given a
six-month sentence, which he never served.
   Bailey was also the target of a probe by the state attorney
general's office after tenant union members alleged that he was
misusing funds of the not-for-profit organization. No charges were
ever filed.
   While his work initially focused on Columbia University-owned
buildings, Bailey had expanded his efforts to include buildings in
drug-ravaged sections of the city: Harlem and Washington Heights
were also included.
   Bailey began infuriating drug dealers used to operating without
any interference. The day he disappeared, Bailey had been in
suburban Scarsdale, trying to persuade a landlord to evict drug
dealers from a Manhattan building.
   It wasn't surprising to anyone who knew Bailey that he took them
on the same way he handled everyone else.
   ``Bruce was not well-liked by anyone _ except the tenants he was
working for,'' said attorney Douglas Kellner, who represented
tenants in six Bailey-organized buildings.
   And Kellner, like the Bailey family, believes his friend's life
work might have led to his death. When he was informed about
Bailey's disappearance, Kellner immediately thought the worst.
   ``I was very concerned, because we were working on several
projects where landlords were capable of using violence,'' he said.

<HEAD>Partisanship Marks Mayors Conference for First Time in Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>EDS: SUBS 8th graf pvs, Koch, arriving..., to restore first reference
to New York City mayor. ^By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   William Althaus, the Republican mayor of
York, Pa., spoke too soon when he explained last week why city
leaders of both parties agreed on the need for higher federal taxes,
and why their annual meetings had become such dull, bipartisan
affairs.
   ``There's always a little'' partisanship, he said, ``but not as
much as there used to be. ... The cuts in federal programs for
cities over the past seven or eight years have pulled us together.''
   By the conclusion of the annual U.S. Conference of Mayors a few
days later in this historic seaport, they still agreed on taxes and
urban spending. But partisanship had flared openly in a way not seen
among the local leaders since the early years of the Reagan
administration.
   The leading Republican mayors didn't bother to show up for a
closing news conference. They were licking their wounds from a
bruising battle over electing future leaders for the group that saw
Althaus the loser of an unprecedented party-lines vote.
   And their meeting seemed to demonstrate that political bitterness
after the upheaval in House leadership will spread to other levels.
   The mayors' meeting had slid into partisan argument with the
arrival of Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater, who said he had
targeted the New York mayoral race as a way to establish a
``political beachhead'' in the cities.
   Even some Republican mayors were left complaining about its
partisan tone and that it was the kind of speech appropriate for GOP
workers _ not a gathering of mayors where the majority was
Democratic.
   New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch, arriving the next day, hadn't
sat down yet when he unleashed a bitter assault on Atwater, calling
him a ``amoral,'' ``pathological'' and engineer of ``vile'' tactics.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown followed with an attack on
Atwater as purveyor of ``oil spill'' tactics, taking politics ``to
its worst extreme.''
   But Democratic mayors were left with a dispute among themselves,
too, and it cut to the heart of how they want to be advocates for
the nation's urban problems in the Bush administration.
   The incoming president of the conference, Kathryn Whitmire of
Houston, used the meeting to voice optimism about the Bush
administration being more attentive to urban problems than the
mayors feel Reagan was. She said of the Bush administration
officials who spoke, ``After hearing from them, we are optimistic
that our issues will be on their agenda.''
   But the mayors, who select their president two years in advance,
pushed aside Althaus's Republican candidacy to be future president
of the group and elected Boston's Ray Flynn _ who is among the
sharpest critics of the Bush administration among the mayors.
   That there was a contested election at all was unprecedented in
the long history of big-city mayors meetings. Flynn immediately made
clear he didn't think Whitmire would be a tough enough critic of the
administration, and that the debate had been over how agressive
big-city mayors want to be in pressing their case with Washington.
   Where Whitmire had praise for the Bush officials, Flynn said
pointedly: ``I didn't think they had much to say about anything. We
can't sit back and applaud that kind of rhetoric. ... There's too
much of `one big happy family.'''
   Lost in the mayors' meeting was any real airing of the scandals
plaguing the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the agency
that handles most federal urban spending and which is engulfed in
allegations of political favoritism, fraud and embezzlement from the
previous administration.
   Whitmire, who is in a tough re-election battle in Bush's home
town, said she wasn't interested in debating any past abuses and
would look to the future.
   Flynn said revelations that the limited money for housing may
have been squandered ``just leave everybody depressed.'' There was
also much concern voiced privately that the investigative trails
would lead into other HUD programs popular with mayors.
   Former Secretary Sam Pierce, who directed HUD throughout the
Reagan administration, has never been popular with mayors, and he
had no defenders at this meeting.
   ``HUD has not been very sensitive to America's cities,'' Flynn
said. ``Anybody tht says HUD has been in the corner of America's
cities for the last eight or nine years doesn't know what they're
talking about.''

   Local residents can hardly wait for the
next visit of ``Batman'' star Kim Basinger, the movie actress who
recently bought up a big part of their town.
   The actress is planning an appearance in a couple of months for a
ceremony marking her $20 million purchase. Most residents missed her
when she quietly popped in and out of town about two months ago.
   Miss Basinger's Mud Pie Enterprises is buying from the town's
dominant family, the Braseltons, almost all of the downtown
buildings and residential property, plus a mostly undeveloped
700-acre industrial park.
   ``Braselton is the type of town that's ripe for opportunity,''
said Jeff Forrester, who owns Dado's restaurant.
   ``The general attitude of people is that they're glad something
is happening,'' he said. ``It's been pretty stagnant around here for
a lot of years.''
   A spokesman said she plans to renovate some of the typically
small-town and old-time businesses, such as the Braseltons' former
blacksmith shop, the corn and flour mill and cotton gin.
   Residents hope Miss Basinger, a native of Athens, will help bring
in new industries and businesses that will capture tourists' dollars
for the town of 500.

   Annivory Calvert, who filed a successful paternity
claim against Mayor Coleman Young, has asked the FBI to investigate
allegations of wrongdoing by a secret Detroit police unit probing
her personal life.
   Calvert's attorney made the request, said Hal Helteroff, special
agent in charge of the Detroit FBI office.
   ``There are reports about what appears to be some abuses by the
Detroit Police Department that may affect the constitutional rights
of my client,'' said the attorney, Noel Keane.
   ``I'm going to review it and discuss the matter with the U.S.
attorney's office and then we'll go from there,'' Helteroff said
Friday.
   Calvert, 34, a former city official now working as director of
public works in Fontana, Calif., filed a complaint last week with
the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office concerning the allegations.
   Richard Padzieski, chief of operations for the prosecutor's
office, said a federal investigation would not pose a conflict with
his office.
   Attorneys for Young and Calvert reached a settlement Wednesday
calling for Young to provide $200 a week in child support for
6-year-old Joel Loving.

great affection for her. But because it has become a matter of

   Ricky Van Shelton says it's the emotion and
sincerity he puts into his traditional country singing _ not sex
appeal _ that so excites his fans.
   He was stampeded by fans at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.
In Midland, Texas, his tour bus was rocked back and forth until his
crew came to the rescue. Women in Louisiana threw their bras at him
with their phone numbers pinned inside.
   The singer's ``Wild-Eyed Dream'' debut album sold more than a
million copies.
   As he prepares for a series of concerts at state fairs, he told
People magazine for its June 26 issue that he's ``happy and alive
when I walk up on that stage.''
   Wife Bettye doesn't mind the adulation. ``I understand the reason
the ladies act like they do, what makes them swoon when he's on
stage,'' she said ``I think if they knew Ricky as well as I do,
they'd be even 10 times crazier about him.''
   Shelton says his parents didn't allow any rock 'n' roll or
country music at home. He sang at the Pentecostal Holiness Church
where he met Bettye Witt. All through high school, he daydreamed
about singing country music.
   It wasn't until 1987 when Bettye got a co-worker's husband to
give a demonstration tape to a record executive in Nashville that
Shelton's dream came true.

<HEAD>Applications Triple For Second Gator Hunt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's second annual alligator
hunt has drawn more than 20,000 applicants, or about three times
what last year's hunt drew.
   ``We were a little bit surprised. I estimated we would get
double, but not triple,'' last year's applications said Dennis
David, alligator program coordinator for the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission.
   David said 20,361 people applied before the June 15 deadline,
leaving about 80 hopefuls for every permit to be granted.
   The commission brought back gator hunting, in limited numbers,
after a 25-year ban when alligators were counted as an endangered
species. They now number over a million and have become a nuisance
in some areas.
   About 250 to 300 trappers will be randomly selected by a
computerized lottery for the 30-day hunt in September.
   Last year, a computer sorted through 5,800 applications to select
the 238 trappers that were given hunt permits.
   Hunters are allowed 15 gators each. Florida residents selected in
the lottery must pay a hunt license fee of $250. The fee for
out-of-state residents is $1,000.
   Last year's trappers bagged 2,988 alligators, 582 alligators
short of the hunt's allotted amount.
   The game commission made one significant rule change for the
second hunt after receiving complaints of brutality toward
alligators: Trappers are now required to kill their captured quarry
immediately, instead of binding live alligators until they are
delivered to a meat processor.

<HEAD>Boeing's Billing Practices, Health Record Under Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is investigating the
billing practices of The Boeing Co. on research and development
costs for government contracts, the company said.
   Meanwile, a separate investigation by state and federal
inspectors is focused on health and safty concerns at top-security
Boeing facilities.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder declined to provide details of the
billing practices probe, but he did confirm Friday that an
investigation is under way.
   ``We have supplied documents and we are cooperating in the
investigation,'' he said.
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported in Saturday's editions
that it has obtained internal Boeing memos that say the company is
under subpoena from the Defense Department to preserve certain
documents between Jan. 1, 1979, and Aug. 31, 1988.
   ``The subpoena is currently so broad that virtually all Boeing
Aerospace and Electronics contracts, proposals, associated files,
technical documentation, working files, notes, etc. can be subject
to being requested by the government,'' the memo said.
   It was dated June 7 and distributed to key employees telling them
that none of the documents in question should be destroyed or
removed.
   A memo dated June 13 named the target as the Sea Lance program,
an anti-submarine weapon Boeing is developing for the U.S. Navy, the
Post-Intelligencer reported.
   Both memos referred to the probe as a criminal investigation by
the Defense Department.
   This year Boeing was awarded $85 million for research and
development of the Sea Lance, a conventional warhead being developed
to attack submarines at long range from surface ships and other
submarines.
   The six-year contract, potentially worth hundreds of millions of
dollars, was first signed in 1986.
   Boeing, which receives billions of dollars' from the federal
government for defense contracts annually, is routinely audited by
the department's Defense Contract Audit Agency. If irregularities
are found in any procedures, the agency can refer the matter to its
own investigative branch or to the appropriate armed service.
   Scott Reedal, agent in charge of the Defense Department's Defense
Criminal Investigative Service in Seattle, declined to answer
questions regarding the investigation.
   Bill Whitlow, an analyst with Dain Bosworth in Seattle, said
Boeing is considered an ethical defense contractor. But, he said,
that doesn't mean the company would be immune from improper billing.
   ``There's always a risk that somewhere in the many programs they
have and the thousands of people involved that someone is going to
slip up,'' he said.
   In another development, a Seattle official in the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said the health and
safety investigation has been under way since May 18.
   Richard Terrill, assistant regional administrator for OSHA,
declined to say what prompted the investigation at the Boeing
Developmental Center. Binder, the Boeing spokesman, said the company
strives to have a good health and safety program.
   ``It's almost a given that they're going to find something wrong.
... They don't come in to tell us what's right,'' he said.
   Steve Valandra, spokesman for the state's Industrial Safety and
Health Division, said OSHA was asked to help perform the safety and
health review with state officials because state officials have had
trouble getting security clearance in the past.

<TEXT>
   Jiang Zemin, the new leader of the world's largest
Communist Party, has been a leader in efforts to open China's
economy to the world, but he opposes political reform.
   Jiang, 62, on Saturday was named general secretary of the
47-million-member Communist Party of China. He replaces Zhao Ziyang,
who was ousted in disgrace for expressing sympathy for the
pro-democracy movement.
   Jiang's selection to the nation's most powerful post came as a
surprise to many China watchers. Although he has the experience and
the right political stance for the job, he lacks a power base.
   ``His base is his popularity, but in China that's not enough,''
said one Chinese source in Hong Kong who is familiar with Jiang's
family. ``He has no organizations behind him, like the military or
the state security organs.
   ``If the senior leaders want him to do something, he'll have no
choice.''
   Jiang has been party secretary of Shanghai, China's largest city,
and a member of the 17-member Politburo, the party's top
decision-making body.
   From 1985 until last year he was mayor of Shanghai, aggressively
promoting it as a financial and foreign investment center and
tackling the daunting transportation and housing problems of the
city of 12 million.
   ``Jiang is politically hard-line and economically liberal,'' said
the Chinese source.
   ``He likes good food and dresses well, too. He is very smooth,
very suave, a likable man.''
   Among the joint ventures Jiang has brought to his city are the
Shanghai Hilton, one of China's most luxurious hotels. He has also
worked with Prescott Bush, brother of President Bush, to establish a
golf course in Shanghai, the source said.
   Jiang made an impressive showing last month when he played host
to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during Gorbachev's visit to
the city. The two talked about economic reforms.
   ``He has a combination of suaveness but also a history of
managing difficult situations that undoubtedly recommended him for
this job,'' said Lynn White, an instructor at Princeton University
and visiting scholar at the University of Hong Kong, who spent the
second half of 1988 in Shanghai.
   White said Jiang lost some popularity among Shanghai citizens for
``representing Beijing at least as well as he represented them,''
and for his recent moves against the World Economic Herald, China's
most liberal newspaper before it was shut down in May.
   Jiang moved swiftly to arrest protesters and quell demonstrations
that broke out in Shanghai after the military crackdown in Beijing
on June 3-4. The first Chinese condemned for participating in the
protest movement were three Shanghai men who were executed Wednesday.
   The Chinese source said Jiang was supported by his two relatively
liberal predecessors, Zhao and the late Hu Yaobang, and has always
had a good relationship with intellectuals.
   His ties with Zhao and intellectuals were strained, however,
after Jiang moved to censor the World Economic Herald and its editor
Qin Benli, the source said.
   Jiang was born in July 1926 in Yangzhou City, near Shanghai, and
joined the Communist Party in 1946.
   A year later he graduated from the Electrical Machinery
Department of Jiaotong University in Shanghai.
   He worked as a trainee at an automobile factory in the Soviet
Union in 1955, then returned to China the next year to become deputy
chief engineer for dynamic mechanics at a plant in northeastern
China and deputy director of the Shanghai Electrical Equipment
Research Institute.
   Jiang, like most bureaucrats of his generation, apparently was
purged from office during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He
reappeared in 1980 as a senior official in the State Administration
Commission on Import and Export Affairs and the State Administration
Commission on Foreign Investment.
   He went on to be named minister of electronics industry and in
1985 returned to Shanghai as mayor and deputy secretary of the party
committee.
   In 1986, during student demonstrations in Shanghai, he went to
his alma mater and, seeing a poster with Chinese-language excerpts
from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, surprised students by reciting in
English from the speech.
   But he also told students they only knew the words and not the
essence of the American president's speech, and later criticized
students for their ``superficial'' knowledge of the West.
   The source in Hong Kong said Jiang has limited understanding of
Russian. According to official profiles, he reads Romanian, French
and Japanese, and is fond of music and literature.
   He is said to be the son-in-law of Li Xiannian, China's former
president and one of the Old Guard hard-liners who have supported
senior leader Deng Xiaoping in the suppression of dissent.

   Riot troopers backed by fire trucks
raided a university campus before dawn Saturday and arrested 21
students accused of organizing violent anti-government protests,
police said.
   Police said about 3,500 riot police searched two buildings at
Hanyang University in eastern Seoul for student leaders.
   At least 21 students were arrested, but many more escaped before
police arrived, police said. Police said hundreds of firebombs and
clubs were seized.
   Radical students, a powerful minority on campuses, have used the
Hanyang campus as a stronghold of anti-government protests.
   Also Saturday, in the southern provincial capital of Kwangju,
news reports said about 400 radical students armed with firebombs
and steel bars attacked prosecutors' offices, burning two cars and
injuring five policemen.
   The attackers briefly occupied the compound of a three-story
building housing prosecutors' offices and fled after shattering
windows of the building and 16 cars, the reports said.
   Police arrested three students. One student was seriously injured
when he jumped off the top of the building, shouting slogans
denouncing the government, said Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Police have raided university campuses in recent weeks to arrest
radical students leaders. About 500 dissidents and radicals have
been arrested and sent to jail so far this year.
   The dissidents are demanding the fall of the government of
President Roh Tae-woo and the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops
in South Korea. They say the American presence hampers
reconciliation with communist North Korea.

<HEAD>Colombia Raises Gas Prices, Citing Pipeline Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAROLD OLMOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government raised gasoline prices 10
percent Saturday and blamed the increase on Marxist guerrillas whose
two-year sabotage campaign has cost the oil industry $375 million in
lost export revenues.
   Union leaders said the move would increase inflation. One
opposition politician said the government should halt terrorism, not
raise prices.
   The increase boosted the average price of regular gasoline from
195 pesos (52 cents) to 215 pesos (57 cents) a gallon, and premium
gas from 243 pesos (65 cents) to 267 pesos (75 cents). The minimum
wage is 32,000 pesos ($85) a month.
   ``There was no other alternative left to avoid depriving the
government of the resources needed to pay for social programs,''
Energy Minister Oscar Mejia Vallejo said in a nationwide television
broadcast announcing the increase.
   Colombia's rich eastern oil fields are jointly operated by the
state-owned conglomerate Ecopetrol, which holds 50 percent of the
shares, and Occidental and Dutch Shell, which control 25 percent
each.
   Since the guerrillas of the National Liberation Army began their
sabotage campaign, the oil industry has reported 104 terrorist
attacks.
   The guerrillas want the government to nationalize the assets of
Occidental and Dutch Shell and have said the attacks on oil
pipelines will continue until the government allows a public debate
on nationalization.
   Earlier this week, Comptroller General Rodolfo Gonzalez said he
favored a dialogue with the guerrillas that would include ways of
improving the revenues Colombia receives from its partnership with
Occidental and Dutch Shell.
   Mejia Vallejo estimated export revenue losses at $375 million
since the guerrilla attacks began two years ago, just as Colombia
began exporting oil.
   The latest and most devastating dynamite attack knocked out the
pump station at Covenas port on June 16, halting daily exports of
200,000 barrels.
   Repairs are not expected to be completed until at least mid-July.
   Most of the guerrilla attacks have occurred on the 487-mile
pipeline between oil fields in Cano Limon, near the Venezuela
border, and Covenas port.
   About 420,000 barrels of oil have spilled over the mountainous
region since the guerrilla attacks began, according to Mejia Vallejo.
   Several union leaders said Saturday the increase in gasoline
prices will worsen inflation, already running at an annual rate of
13.6 percent.
   Another critic was Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana, of the
opposition Conservative Party. ``Impotent before terrorism, the
government has decided to pass on to the Colombian people the cost
of this madness,'' he said.

   At age 81 she may have thought she had
seen everything, but Dale Granzeau ran into something new when she
encountered a squirrel swimming in her toilet.
   The animal apparently ended a fall down a plumbing vent Friday by
swimming through a waste pipe and bobbing up in the toilet bowl
about the same time Mrs. Granzeau was stirring from a night's sleep.
   ``I screamed and ran out and shut the door,'' she said. ``I had
hysterics. I'm still shaking about it.''
   When all other explanations for finding a squirrel in the toilet
were exhausted, police concluded the animal fell into the roof vent
pipe, said Sgt. James Kubath.
   ``Sometimes I don't even open my eyes when I get up in the
morning. Can you imagine finding this?'' asked Eileen Butler, a
manager at Bruesewitz, a local plumbing contractor where workers
said they had heard of such mishaps before.
   Marvin McCray said he'd never seen anything like it. The 22-year
veteran of the Racine County Humane Society was called to net the
3-month-old squirrel, which he released outside.
   ``I don't think he'll be trying that again,'' McCray said.
   McCray said he's seen just about every animal come down a
fireplace, including ducks, hawks, raccoons and squirrels, but an
animal swimming up the toilet was a new one for him.
   Mrs. Granzeau said she already had contacted a plumber to put a
screen over the vent pipe.
   ``I hope I never see this again,'' she said. ``What a bad start
for the day.''

   When a dolphin appeared in Manhattan's East
River, the locals, understandably, got concerned.
   ``I think it's going to die,'' fretted Vincent Perez, 15, as he
stared down into the murky waters. ``The only thing you see in here
is garbage ... cars and shopping carts.''
   The shoreline at East 96th Street was filled Friday with police,
journalists and concerned citizens, all peering off-shore.
   ``I called 911,'' said John Soto, 41, who lives nearby. ``I'd
hate to see a dolphin get killed by these speedboats and Circle Line
boats.''
   Those who know say the dolphin seemed to be doing just fine.
   One expert said the visitor can easily dodge boats as long as its
sonar is working. And Louis Garibaldi, director of the New York
Aquarium, figures the dolphin is contentedly feasting on marine
munchies such as black bass and herring, which also (yes, it's true)
live in the waterway.
   Garibaldi said a staff member came to the area Wednesday when the
dolphin was first reported sighted.
   ``It looks like it's most likely a whitesided dolphin,'' he said.
``It appears in good health and has no trouble swimming.''
   His staff advised police and others to leave the dolphin alone,
and he noted that harassment of a marine mammal is against federal
law.
   A woman who answered the phone at the aquarium Saturday said that
officials there are monitoring the dolphin, but she wasn't sure if
they had seen it Saturday.

   Czechoslovakia's leading rock star

   ``This nation is at a crossroads ... we are more than ever
responsible for what happens now, we must work hard but also demand

said during an impromptu interview Friday night after being
presented with an award in the city of Decin, 80 miles north of
Prague.
   ``I'd like to remind everyone of an old Czech saying that `every
nation gets the government it deserves,''' he added.
   Knowledgeable Czechoslovaks said it was the first time in recent
years such a statement was carried by state television.
   The brief speech drew enthusiastic applause from several thousand
spectators.
   Czechoslovakia has taken one of the hardest lines against dissent
and has been reluctant to emulate many of the political and economic
reforms introduced in the Soviet Union.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat on Saturday
offered to mediate a political solution to the civil war in
neighboring Afghanistan, a guerrilla leader said.
   After a 30-minute meeting with Arafat at Islamabad International
Airport, guerrilla leader Gulbadin Hekmatyar said the provisional
government established by the insurgents will vote on Arafat's offer.
   Hekmatyar is foreign minister of the government, which the
U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas plan to install in Afghanistan if they
oust the Marxist government.
   Arafat later told Pakistan's National Assembly, ``I have
discussed with all the parties to this conflict our own
initiative.'' He did not elaborate.
   A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization said
earlier that Arafat supported a neutral government made up of
technocrats and independent of the communists or the Moslem
insurgents.
   In the past, guerrilla leaders have rejected the neutral
government proposal.
   But the PLO representative in Pakistan, Ahmad Abdul Razzaq Al
Salman, said: ``It is very important that they change their views.''
   The guerrillas began fighting in 1978 after the communists took
over in a coup. Soviet forces entered Afghanistan a year later to
bolster the communist government and stayed for nine years.
   Moscow completed the withdrawal of its troops in February.
   ``The Soviets are gone,'' said Ahmed Abdul Karim Elhih,
Palestinian consul general in Pakistan. ``The reason to fight is
over.''
   However, the guerrillas, who have headquarters in Pakistan and
Iran, say the war will continue until they oust the Afghan
government.
   They have refused to negotiate with President Najib and his
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   In a release issued late Saturday by the guerrilla-controlled
Afghan News Agency, Hekmatyar said he told Arafat the Soviets should
stop supporting Najib and sending weapons to his forces.
   ``I also told him that the mujahedeen do not accept the idea of
sharing power with Najib,'' Hekmatyar said.
   But Elhih said the insurgents should relent. ``Why not talk to
your enemies? If you have courage to fight, you should have courage
to talk,'' he said.
   He said both sides had approached Arafat about mediating and that
the PLO leader met earlier with representatives of Najib and the
guerrillas.
   Arafat, who was welcomed at the airport by Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, previously visited Pakistan in March. Then, he laid the
cornerstone for a Palestinian Embassy and met with guerrilla leaders.
   Guerrilla sources said at the time that the meeting accomplished
little. Arafat urged the insurgents to push for a political solution
to the war instead of a military one.
   The guerrillas rejected the idea.
   During this Pakistani visit, Arafat also discussed the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, telling the National Assembly it will end only after Israeli
troops withdraw.
   He called on the United States to press for an international
peace conference, with the PLO as a full partner in negotiations.
Israel has rejected such a proposal.
   Ms. Bhutto said following Arafat's speech, ``It is clearly not
the Palestinian people who want to see the conflict continue, but it
is those who do not believe in freedom and peace, who have used arms
to terrorize.''
   A PLO official said Ms. Bhutto made a ``personal'' donation of
$50,000 to the uprising in April.

<TEXT>
   The damaged tanker Exxon Valdez was towed
Saturday through the often stormy Gulf of Alaska, but there was no
sign of stress at critical points and no significant dribbling of
residual oil near the ship.
   The 897-foot tanker ran aground three months ago on Bligh Reef,
ripping large gashes in its hull and releasing nearly 11 million
gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound,
causing the nation's worst oil spill.
   The vessel was refloated two weeks after the accident and towed
25 miles to an already soiled anchorage near Naked Island. There,
divers and salvage crews made it seaworthy for the 2,500-mile trip
to a San Diego shipyard where it is scheduled for $25 million in
repairs. Two ocean-going tugs began towing the huge tanker out of
Alaska waters early Friday.
   The procession was halted about four hours Friday night for a
final Coast Guard inspection before leaving the Hinchinbrook
Entrance and proceeding into open water, officials said.
   ``The strain gauges aboard the vessel showed no stress,'' Joe
Tucker, an Exxon spokesman in Valdez, said Saturday. ``There was no
trace of oil on or near the boat.''
   Observers who earlier had watched the procession lift anchor
under gray and gloomy skies reported a light film of oil trailing
the virtually empty tanker. But the Coast Guard released a statement
prepared by Exxon that generally discounted the seriousness of those
observations.
   A light sheen was observed coming off the Exxon Valdez ``for a
few minutes after the ship's departure,'' said Coast Guard
spokeswoman Brenda Toledo, who quoted from the statement.
   It was believed that most of that sheen was a ``bio-mass,''
microorganisms or algae, ``plus an insignificant'' amount of oil
that washed out of the open tanks during turbulence as the vessel
got under way, the statement said.
   The sheen was very thin _ too thin for skimmer boats to pick up,
officials said. Some of it was recovered by absorbant pads,
officials said.
   ``The Coast Guard has said this was not considered serious and
not unexpected,'' Toledo read.
   ``All discharge has stopped,'' she said. ``There has been none
since the initial startup.''
   The vessels have been moving at about 6 knots and were to slow to
an average speed of 5 knots as they continue toward Southern
California, officials said.

   A tiny rotating blade device was inserted
surgically and used to slice away plaque to unclog a patient's heart
artery in a first-of-its-kind procedure, a doctor at St. Luke
Medical Center said.
   Cardiologist Frank Cummins said Lawrence Alfson, 58, was the
first patient in medical history to undergo an atherectomy, in which
an experimental blade device is used to clear plaque from a blocked
heart artery.
   Cummins said he inserted the tiny blade device, which was
attached to a long tube, into an artery in the patient's leg and
maneuvered it carefully to the heart.
   The rotating blade sliced away the plaque, which was then sucked
out of the artery by a vacuum attached to the device. The procedure
successfully restored blood flow to Alfson's heart, Cummins said.
   ``The hope is that if you actually remove the plaque from the
artery, it won't narrow down again,'' Cummins said.
   Alfson said he had bypass surgery 10 years ago and a vein from
his leg was grafted to the heart. Since then he has twice undergone
angioplasty _ the use of a balloon to open the clogged blood vessel.
   Alfson said the experimental atherectomy took about two hours
Friday and was relatively painless. He remained hospitalized
Saturday, but the St. Luke's declined to release a condition report.

<TEXT>
   Last year, southern Africa was
ablaze with wars in Angola, Mozambique and Namibia that all seemed
to defy a solution. Today, Namibia is on the road to independence,
Angola has a cease-fire, and there are moves afoot to begin peace
talks in Mozambique.
   Each conflict has been fueled by separate forces, but a common
ingredient for the improved regional climate has been South Africa's
campaign to mend relations with its long-hostile neighbors in black
Africa.
   Since August, South Africa has:
   _Withdrawn its troops from Angola, where they fought
intermittently since 1975 alongside the rebels of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. The rebels and the
Marxist Angolan government reached a cease-fire agreement last week
that took effect Saturday.
   _Begun implementing a U.N.-supervised independence plan in
Namibia, the territory South Africa has ruled for 74 years.
   _Held a series of top-level meetings with Mozambique and offered
financial assistance to help repair the country's war-devastated
economy.
   Black-ruled nations remain skeptical of South Africa, saying the
country's policy of apartheid at home and its destabilization
campaign abroad caused the regional turmoil.
   But there has been a sharp reversal in the political tides since
the middle of 1988, when conflicts dating to the 1960s and 1970s
appeared ready to escalate again.
   ``Those who were part of the problem yesterday are now part of
the solution,'' Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said Friday
night after returning from an African summit in Zaire, where the
Angolan cease-fire was announced.
   ``To make myself clear, I don't think the South Africans will go
back on their word'' in Angola or Namibia, Chissano was quoted as
saying by the national news agency AIM.
   In May 1988, the heaviest fighting in the Angolan war was
reported around the southeastern city of Cuito Cuanavale. Angolan
government troops, backed by Cuban soldiers, fought the combined
UNITA-South African forces to an apparent standoff.
   The Cuban troop strength in Angola had surpassed 50,000 and South
Africa acknowledged 3,000 soldiers more-or-less based in Angola.
   Faced with an expensive, open-ended conflict and mounting white
casualties, South Africa apparently decided to leave Angola. Peace
talks between South Africa, Angola and Cuba _ but not UNITA _ began
in late May 1988.
   South Africa completed its withdrawal from Angola in August. In
December, the three countries signed a regional peace accord that
called for South Africa to halt aid to UNITA and to grant
independence to Namibia. In return, Cuba has agreed to a phased
troop withdrawal.
   UNITA, meanwhile, continued to fight for a power-sharing
agreement until the cease-fire was announced. Zambia's President
Kenneth Kaunda called the agreement ``a great moment for Africa.''
   The rival Angolan parties still face difficult negotiations, but
a commission elected at the summit plans to oversee the integration
of UNITA into the current one-party state.
   In Namibia, a 23-year bush war waged by the South-West Africa
People's Organization, or SWAPO, against South African rule appears
over.
   An estimated 10,000 SWAPO supporters celebrated the accord on
Saturday with a rally, and SWAPO leaders said that ``we must now
wage peace.''
   South Africa announced Saturday it was down to 1,500 troops in
Namibia, a week ahead of the U.N. deadline under the territory's
independence plan. South Africa had an estimated 50,000 soliders in
Namibia before the independence plan took effect April 1.
   The independence plan almost fell apart the day it began when
more than 1,000 SWAPO guerrillas crossed into northern Namibia in
violation of the regional peace agreement.
   More than 300 guerrillas and 27 security-force members were
killed, but the fighting has stopped and pre-independence elections
are planned for November. Independence is expected to come early
next year.
   Zambia's Kaunda, one of South Africa's harshest critics in the
past, said black African states would consider strengthening ties
with South Africa if Namibian independence goes smoothly.
   With tangible successes in Angola and Namibia, southern African
leaders have turned their sights toward the region's most active
conflict, Mozambique, where the Marxist government has fought the
rebel Mozambique National Resistance since 1977.
   Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, whose troops support
Mozambican government forces, said the plan to end the Angolan war
could have parallels for Mozambique.
   Although the two wars differ in some ways, ``the (Angolan peace
talk) principles deserve the attention of the Mozambicans,'' he was
quoted as saying Friday by Zimbabwe's ZIANA news agency. ``I am sure
something will unfold soon.''
   Mozambique's Chissano said he hoped the Angolan agreement would
encourage the rebels to take up an amnesty offer in effect since
January 1988.
   More than 3,000 rebels, out of a force estimated at 12,000 to
22,000, already have accepted the offer, according to government
figures.
   On Saturday, Chissano said President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire
had agreed to act as a mediator between the government and the
guerrillas, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
   Chissano has refused to negotiate with the rebels, but his
government has quietly encouraged unpublicized talks between local
church leaders and the rebels, according to sources in Mozambique.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Cuba Arrests Appear Linked to Miami Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arrest of high-ranking military officers inside
Cuba appear to be linked to a recent drug case here, a federal
prosecutor said.
   Meanwhile, the Bush administration is considering lodging a
formal request with Cuba to interview Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, one of the
officers charged in that country, The Miami Herald reported Saturday.
   Cuba says Ochoa and 10 other officers and government officials
worked with the Colombia-based Medellin drug cartel, taking money
from traffickers to allow them to use the island as a way station
for smuggling into the United States.
   U.S. prosecutors say the names of some of the officers now in
custody in Cuba surfaced in a 1987 probe of a smuggling ring that
culminated in two indictments and a 1988 trial.
   ``It is clear that these (Cuban) arrests are substantially
connected to information generated at this trial,'' said U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen. He refused to identify the officers.
   One of the Miami cases involved Hugo Ceballos, a Venezuelan, who
was convicted on a 10-count indictment last year that accused him of
bringing cocaine through Cuba to the Florida Keys.
   In March, Reinaldo Ruiz and three others pleaded guilty to a
related 27-count indictment. They are awaiting sentencing. Ruiz
allegedly headed a Caribbean-based smuggling ring that involved
Cuban military officials.
   The only Cuban official publicly named in the Ruiz case was
``Fidel'' _ an apparent reference to Castro _ who Ruiz, on a
secretly recorded videotape, claimed was pocketing bribes from
smugglers to use Cuban territory.
   ``The money went right in Fidel's drawer,'' Ruiz boasted to an
undercover agent on the tape. He also said he landed at military
airports and had drug-laden boats escorted through Cuban waters by
military torpedo boats.
   The information revealed by Ruiz's guilty plea may have had
reprecussions inside Cuba, Lehtinen said.
   ``That information was quite good, and probably embarrassed the
Cuban government,'' Lehtinen said. ``They have arrested some of the
people identified in that case.''
   During the investigation, an undercover agent flew into Cuba's
Varadero air base escorted by Cuban MiG's, and used Cuban military
frequencies, according to federal authorities.
   The Miami Herald reported Saturday that the Bush administration
is considering a request to Cuba to allow U.S. investigators to
question Ochoa.
   Quoting unidentified U.S. officials, the Herald said Justice
Department and Drug Enforcement Administration investigators are
interested in matching the Cuban information with their own files.

   The communist leadership chose prominent
reformer Rezsoe Nyers as party chairman on Saturday and appointed
him to a new four-man ruling body that is dominated by advocates of
democratic change.
   The action by the policy-making Central Committee erodes the
power of party General Secretary Karoly Grosz, who sought a middle
ground between hard-liners and reformers.
   The Central Committee created a four-member Presidium comprised
of Nyers, Grosz and two other prominent reformers _ Politburo member
Imre Pozsgay and Premier Miklos Nemeth, spokesman Laszlo Major said
in a statement relayed on radio, television and the state news
agency MTI.
   The four will lead the party on a provisional basis until a
crucial party Congress set for Oct. 7, when communists will choose
who will lead the party as Hungary prepares for its first free and
competitive elections next year.
   The choice of a leader at the congress is considered crucial to
the party's attempts to hold power when the elections are held.
   The promotion of Nyers to the largely symbolic party chairmanship
_ and the inclusion of Nyers, Pozsgay and Nemeth in the Presidium _
indicate reformers won a protracted internal battle with
conservative communists.
   Nyers, an economist, inherits the chairmanship from Janos Kadar,
who was named honorary party chairman when Grosz took over as
general secretary just 13 months ago. Kadar, 77, leader of Hungary's
communists for 32 years, was stripped of the chairmanship last month.
   Grosz has lost standing recently as the split between reformers
and hard-liners left him little middle ground. Several party reform
groups called publicly for his ouster.
   But only four of the 92 speakers at the closed-door Central
Committee session demanded Grosz step down, Major said, and he
retained his title of general secretary.
   His inclusion in the new leadership suggested the reformers had
been forced to compromise with disgruntled conservatives who are
still powerful in the party.
   The first act of the new leadership late Saturday was to revamp
the nine-man party Politburo, expanding its membership to 21 and
renaming it the Political Executive Committee, MTI said.
   The makeup of the new Politburo also struck a balance between
reformers and conservatives, including all nine members of the old
body along with important reformers such as Foreign Minister Gyula
Horn.
   Reformers showed their strength in achieving the ouster of Janos
Berecz, a former chief ideologist who lost his Politburo seat in
April, from the influential rank of Central Committee secretary.
   Berecz will head a new party ideological institute, Major said.
   Saturday's changes seemed designed to prevent an open party split
before the Oct. 7 party congress.
   The reformers believe that only the communists' most democratic
policies give the party hope of emerging as the strongest force in
next year's elections. A split now could ruin the party's chances at
the polls against opposition groups.
   Hungary also is trying to boost its image in the West as a stable
economic partner before President Bush visits next month.
   The communists are negotiating a timetable and regulations for
the elections with the opposition and promised last week that the
opposition would be able to review proposed election laws before
they are considered by the communist-dominated Parliament.
   Nyers was also named to head the party's delegation to the talks.
Pozsgay and two moderates make up the rest of the delegation, MTI
said.
   The promotion of Nyers, 66, seals a stunning comeback in East
bloc politics. After pioneering economic reforms in the late 1960s,
Nyers was ousted from the Politburo in 1973 after apparently pushing
too hard for more changes.
   Nyers made it back to the Politburo when Grosz took over in May
1988 at the head of a revamped leadership that also gave Pozsgay a
Politburo seat.
   It was not immediately clear how much power Nyers will have as
party chairman. He told the independent daily Mai Nap on Friday that
he would not want to be a mere ``symbolic figure'' if given the post.

<TEXT>
   A man who swallowed about $1 million worth of
heroin in at least 74 packages was detained at Houston
Intercontinental Airport after agreeing to be X-rayed, U.S. Customs
officials said.
   Enemuo C. Akwali, 41, of Nigeria passed from his digestive tract
more than 1{ pounds of heroin in the balloon-like packages, Candace
Vice, chief customs inspector at the airport, said Friday.
   Officials at Northwest Medical Center Hospital, where Akwali was
X-rayed, said Saturday he had been released to federal authorites.
   Akwali is charged with possession with intent to distribute more
than 100 grams of heroin, which carries a maximum punishment of life
in prison and a $4 million fine. Federal prosecutors will ask a
judge at a hearing Monday to detain Akwali without bond, said
assistant U.S. attorney Charley Davidson.
   Akwali was stopped by customs agents because he appeared nervous
and was coming from Nigeria, a country that is an established source
of illegal drugs, Vice said.
   Two other Nigerian men arrested under similar circumstances in
the last week of May had even more balloon-like heroin packages in
their bodies. But Akwali was carrying a significantly larger amount
of the drug, Vice said.
   Officials said they do not know if the ``swallowers,'' as Vice
called them, are part of the same drug ring.

   Hundreds of people lined the shore on
Saturday, clutching binoculars to see if their fears of an
environmental disaster in Rhode Island Sound had been realized.
   What they saw _ a wounded oil tanker barely a mile offshore,
listing and ringed with Coast Guard boats _ left many with feelings
of resignation or anger.
   Diane Collins sat on a lonely rock outcrop, alternately staring
at the World Prodigy, which leaked more than 1 million gallons of
heating fuel when it struck a reef Friday, and scanning the water,
hoping not to see any of the fuel washing ashore.
   ``I'm pretty devastated myself, because if something hurts the
earth, it hurts me, too. I worried about the Alaska one, too, but
this is right on our doorstep,'' she said.
   At a nearby state park, spectators were lined along the road by 5
a.m., watching the process of unloading the tanker's remaining oil.
   ``If the oil comes in on our beaches, there goes the beaches,''
said Joanne Burns.
   Her husband, Bryan, who said he could remember three or four
tankers running aground during the past 50 years, was resigned to
it, ``as long as you're going to have an economy.''
   ``But that's a little close,'' his wife said, pointing to the
ship.
   Word that the Greek captain had failed to pick up a harbor pilot
before navigating the treacherous entrance to Narragansett Bay
sparked some anger.
   ``Guys like that ought to hang. I have no mercy for people like
that,'' said Steve Ellis of Newport.
   The ship was not inland far enough to require a pilot, but some
officials said it was unwise of the captain to operate without one.
   ``It's kind of a gray area out there,'' said Chief Warrant
Officer Jerry Alfred, a Coast Guard marine safety investigator.
   ``When the Valdez happened, I said to myself it's a wonder it
doesn't happen around here with all the traffic that comes up and
down the bay,'' Ellis said. ``But it's probably going to happen
again some day with this coastline the way it is and the amount of
traffic. ...
   ``I think they learned a lot from the Valdez that it's not wise
to sit around and wait for the company to clean it up.''
   ``The water is literally orange in some places where the waves
are breaking,'' said Chip Young, a spokesman for the environmental
group Save the Bay.

   A major offshore oil spill forced beaches
to close but failed to keep determined tourists away from Newport's
famous mansions, restaurants, and even its oil-besmirched harbor on
Saturday.
   While officials were busy trying to reduce the potential of an
oil spill of up to 1.5 million gallons, visitors shopped, went out
in tour boats and waited in line at restaurants.
   ``It's like it never happened,'' said Walter Andrews, manager of
the Newport Marriott.
   ``The people are just walking around shopping, they have their
maps, they have their brochures. It's a typical day,'' said Robert
Rosenberg, executive director of the Newport County Convention and
Visitors' Bureau.
   As many as 20,000 sunbathers were left stranded when the state
closed beaches in Newport and nearby Narragansett, but the dedicated
found other amusements to pass the time.
   Despite a request by the state Department of Environmental
Management that boaters stay off the water, the Salem Pro Sail
Series continued as scheduled with only a slight delay.
   Stephen G. Morin, chief of the DEM's emergency response team, had
said ``We don't want boats churning up the oil slick.''
Nevertheless, harbor tours continued to run.
   ``Today seems to be a business as usual day,'' said Rosenberg.
   ``A lot of people don't even know (the spill) is around here,''
he said. ``They're on vacation, either they've been out all morning
and haven't listened to the news, haven't picked up a paper, or
maybe they aren't as concerned about this as we would like to think
they are.''
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said he thought the effects of the spill
on tourism would be temporary.
   ``By and large it should not affect tourism,'' he said.
   The Marriott and the Sheraton Islander, both located in downtown
Newport, were fully booked, manangers said.
   A noxious smell that had permeated the area late Friday had
lessened, they said. Lance LaFleur, night manager at the Newport
Marriott, said the odor had been so foul it woke him up Friday
evening.
   At the Inn at Castle Hill at Brenton Point, the site where the
World Prodigy struck a rock Friday afternoon, visitors were lined up
to get into the dining room, said a reservation agent who would not
give her name.
   ``Our dining room is booked full to capacity. We are turning
people away,'' she said, adding that such heavy business was normal
this time of year. The slick was not visible from the dining room,
she said.
   On Friday, some Newporters had expressed concern the five-mile
slick would impact on the Ocean State's lucrative tourist industry.
   Tourists spent about $1.1 billion in Rhode Island in 1987, a 15
percent increase over 1986, according to the University of Rhode
Island. In Newport, tourism is the largest industry.
   ``No one's going to want to come down here,'' said Brett
Wagenbach, 18, a waitress at the Black Pearl, a popular oceanfront
restaurant in Newport. ``I think it's going to affect the whole
summer, depending on how big it is.'' She said business was slower
than usual Friday night.
   But Rosenberg said visitors were just choosing other options. A
group of scuba divers were a little disturbed they couldn't go, but
then cheered up when they decided to tour the mansions instead.
   The coastal road near the spill and Bellevue Avenue, the seaside
street dotted with castle-like mansions, were rerouted to one-way
traffic, but Rosenberg said it was flowing without problem.
   The traffic was changed in an attempt to deter curious onlookers,
who had caused traffic jams Friday as they drove by the spill, said
Newport Police Officer Michael McKenna.

   Hundreds of Moslem demonstrators
carrying placards and shouting slogans marched through the capital
Saturday in a second day of protest against slippers that reputedly
blaspheme Islam, police said.
   The government banned the sale of the slippers and seized unsold
stocks on Friday, the same day angry Moslems attacked shops owned by
the manufacturer, the Canadian-based Beta Shoe Co.
   Some Moslems consider the rubber slippers offensive to Islam
because they bear a logo resembling the Arabic characters for Allah.
   Clashes with police Friday in Dhaka and Mymensigh, a town 70
miles to the north, left at least 30 people injured, police said on
condition of anonymity.
   On Saturday, riot police guarded the 10 shops owned by Beta and
about 2,000 protesters called for a worldwide boycott of the
Canadian company. Riot police were stationed at strategic points of
the city but no clashes were reported.
   Islam is the state religion of Bangladesh, and 90 percent of the
country's 110 million people are Moslem.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's only law requiring AIDS
testing for a marriage license needs only Gov. James R. Thompson's
signature to be off the books.
   The Legislature sent a repeal measure to Thompson's desk on a
33-23 Senate vote late Friday.
   A spokesman for Thompson said the governor had not decided
whether to sign the bill, which was approved in the House last month
on a 65-48 vote.
   Sen. William Marovitz, the bill's sponsor, said that Louisiana,
the only other state to have adopted such a law, already had
repealed its statute. He also noted that such groups as the Illinois
State Medical Society were opposed to the testing requirement.
   ``This is a low-risk population,'' Marovitz said, referring to
couples applying for marriage licenses.
   The state Department of Public Health said that through mid-June,
44 people had tested positive for exposure to the AIDS-causing virus
out of an estimated 221,000 marriage-license applicants who have
been tested since the requirement started in January 1988.
   ``This is not good public health policy,'' Marovitz said. ``The
key to this disease is education, getting people to come in
voluntarily and be tested.''
   ``There's nothing in the law, should we pass this bill, that will
bar someone from having an AIDS test,'' he said.
   Critics countered that the premarital tests help monitor the
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and reduce the chance
of children getting the disease even though those testing positive
for the AIDS virus can still marry.
   ``That child is an innocent and we have a right to protect the
children,'' said Sen. Adeline Geo-Karis.
   ``You eliminate the testing program, you eliminate public
awareness,'' said Sen. Jack Schaffer. ``I think we ought to keep the
test going. Frankly, I hope it never shows up a lot of positives.''
   The measure would also repeal the requirement that couples be
tested for syphilis before getting married.
   A study by public health officials estimated that the cost that
engaged couples had to pay for testing and associated doctors'
visits was about $2.5 million over six months last year, or $312,000
for each of the eight cases of infection identified during that
period.
   The authors of the study also noted that the state was losing
thousands of dollars in revenue becauses Illinois couples were
traveling to neighboring states to get married to avoid paying for
the AIDS tests.

   A black Washington priest who announced plans
to form a separate black Catholic church said Saturday he has been
forbidden to celebrate Mass or other church rites.
   Rev. George Stallings said he also was fired from his job as
Washington archdiocesan evangelist. Stallings said the notice was
contained in letters from Cardinal James Hickey of the District of
Columbia Archdiocese.
   Stallings said Hickey told him, ``I must urge you in the
strongest possible terms to turn away from this fatal course.''
   Stallings said he expected harsh criticism from Hickey and other
church officials, because the move represents a schism with the
organized Roman Catholic diocese. Stallings said Hickey's letters
labeled the move ``a significant step toward separating yourself
from the Catholic Church.''
   Stallings has not received any communication directly from the
Vatican, said an associate who asked not to be identified. Stallings
said, however, he was surprised by the wording of Hickey's letters.
   ``This is strong language,'' he said. ``It is not the language of
a man who claims to be the personal representative of the Pope...
and the representative of Christ.''
   Charging the church with ignoring the ``spiritual and cultural
needs'' of black parishioners, Stallings last week announced plans
to form a new black congregation.
   Stallings said Saturday he still plans to hold the first services
of the new church July 2. ``We will consider it a Catholic
service,'' he said.
   Stallings also said he plans to hire a bodyguard although he has
received no specific threat. ``I have no other choice but to think
my life is in jeopardy,'' he said.

   Much of the nation was soggy Saturday as a tropical depression
hovering off Texas brought heavy rain _ Houston got 5 inches _ and
an area of New York got 2{ inches in 45 minutes.
   A cluster of showers and thunderstorms over the northwestern Gulf
of Mexico turned into a tropical depression Saturday. Its center was
off the lower coast of Texas, and it showed little movement.
   Heavy rain drenched the coastal areas of Texas and southwestern
Louisiana. In Texas, up to 5 inches of rain soaked the Houston area,
and, to the south, Matagorda received more than 4 inches of rain
with some street flooding reported.
   A flood watch and a flash flood watch were in effect for the
coastal areas of Texas. A coastal flood watch was in effect for the
middle and upper coast of Texas.
   Flood warnings were issued early Saturday for counties in
northwest and northeast New Jersey as small streams rose out of
their banks.
   Elsewhere, a warm front in the central Plains and an upper level
weather disturbance crossing the Dakotas combined to produce showers
and thunderstorms in the central United States, from Kansas to South
Dakota.
   A stationary front brought showers and thunderstorms in the
northeastern part of the nation, scattering showers from New York to
the middle Atlantic Coast on Saturday afternoon.
   In New York, thunderstorms around Binghamton produced 2{ inches
of rain in 45 minutes, and wind gusted to 67 mph at Syracuse. Flood
warnings were posted Saturday for three western New York waterways.
   Showers and thunderstorms were numerous across the Florida
peninsula.
   The rest of the United States, however, enjoyed fair to partly
cloudy skies.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 96 degrees at
Phoenix, Tucson, and Yuma, Ariz.
   Sunday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
through much of the southeast quarter of the nation; numerous
showers and thunderstorms across the Florida peninsula and over
south central and eastern Texas; widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms over the upper Ohio Valley, the mid Atlantic Coast
states and the lower Great Lakes region; showers and thunderstorms
also will be scattered from the northern Rocky Mountain region to
the upper Mississippi Valley, with showers and thunderstorms most
numerous from northeastern Montana to the upper Mississippi Valley;
and fair to partly cloudy throughout the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were forecast above 90 degrees across the southern
tier of nation, above 100 degrees in the southwestern deserts; 90
degrees in northern California and southwestern Oregon; in the 70s
from the northern and central Rockies to upper Michigan and across
New England; and in the 80s elsewhere.

   Israeli authorities claimed Saturday that a U.S.
relief worker kidnapped in the Gaza Strip cooperated with his
captors, and a news report said officials were considering taking
action against him.
   Chris George, 35, co-director of the Save the Children
Foundation, was freed Friday about 30 hours after he was seized by
gunmen. He strongly criticized his captors.
   Repeated phone calls to George's home and office went unanswered
Saturday.
   A close associate of George's at Save the Children, who requested
anonymity, said George was away for the weekend and unavailable for
comment on the Israeli claims.
   The associate said the government allegations and news
organizations' requests for comment had been relayed to George, who
was ``aware that a statement is expected from him.''
   Reports that George was being investigated were broadcast
throughout the day on government-run radio.
   ``It is clear that George did not stage the kidnapping itself,
but he apparently cooperated with the abductors from the moment he
was taken,'' a senior Israeli security official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The official said George named one of his abductors but declined
to provide descriptions of the two others.
   George told reporters after his release that he knew only one of
his captors.
   Israel television's Arabic-language broadcast said security
authorities were considering taking unspecified ``measures'' against
George, whom the radio described as being ``hostile toward Israel.''
   Leonard L. Lefkow, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said he was unaware
of the investigation and added: ``This would be an Israeli matter, a
matter for the Israeli government.''
   George said he was lured outside his organization's Gaza field
office by three Palestinian gunmen and taken away in a car.
   George, who spoke to reporters outside his home in the West Bank
town of Ramallah after his release Friday, denounced the kidnapping
as ``not only immoral but also a criminal act.''
   He said the kidnappers told him he was taken because he was ``a
well-known and important American,'' and kept him locked in a room
during the kidnapping, but did not abuse him.
   George, whose group works with Palestinian refugees, identified
one of his kidnappers as Mohammed Abu Nasr.
   ``He has come to the office for the last two years. He wanted
help in building a playground in the Jabaliya (refugee) camp and we
have considered the project. But the work that he had done on the
playground was stopped by the Israeli authorities so the project did
not get anywhere,'' George said.
   An Israeli army statement blamed the kidnapping on ``terrorists
linked to the PLO.'' The Palestine Liberation Organization denied it
was involved and had urged his release.
   Israeli security officials claimed George cooperated with his
captors' efforts to seek the release of jailed Palestinian activists.
   George said earlier his captors were demanding that Israel
release seven senior Palestinian activists.
   Before releasing George, the abductors gave him a 13-page letter
saying they carried out the abduction to draw world attention to the
plight of the Palestinian people and urging President Bush to meet
with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   It was signed by Abu Nasr, described as a 39-year-old Palestinian
who was released from an Israeli jail in 1985 in a prisoner swap. In
Gaza, Palestinians said he is not known to be affiliated with any
political faction.
   Israeli television, in a report Saturday night, quoted security
officials as saying they were checking the possibility George
``assisted his abductors in presenting their demands and even
expressed identification with their stand.''

   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton says
he will continue his efforts to end a 2{-month-old strike of the
Pittston Coal Group, despite the company's decision to reject his
offer to help.
   Caperton on Friday offered to mediate negotiations between United
Mine Workers President Richard Trumka and Pittston Co. chairman Paul
Douglas.
   Douglas declined, saying federal mediators would be better suited
to handle negotiations. Federal mediators had been meeting with both
sides before the union dropped out of the talks on June 7.
   ``I'm deeply disappointed that Pittston Coal has decided not to
accept our offer to assist in seeking a solution to the coal
strike,'' Caperton said in a statement issued late Friday.
   ``But I am not ready to discontinue my efforts to end the
conflict between Pittston and the Unite Mine Workers. It has too
far-reaching an effect on too many families and communities for me
to give up.''
   Trumka had agreed to the meeting before Douglas turned down the
offer.
   Union miners went on strike at Pittston operations in Virginia
and West Virginia on April 5. Last week, the UMW also began a strike
at the company's Kentucky holdings.
   At issue are wages and benefits the 1,900 striking miners contend
are unfair.
   Pittston is one of the relatively few mining companies that does
not currently have a UMW contract.
   Caperton's offer also was aimed at ending wildcat walkouts by
44,000 miners in 10 states, at companies that do have UMW contracts.
Those strikes, which the union says it has not sanctioned, have
spurred sporadic incidents of violence though the situation Saturday
was generally calm.
   Many mining companies shut down for two weeks in the summer as
part of their contract with workers. One vacation period began
Saturday morning and ends July 9. Two other vacation periods are to
follow. Companies chose one of the three periods.
   Vacation shutdowns mean wildcat strikers will get a break, since
``there won't be anyone working at the mines to picket,'' said
District 17 field representative Harold Porter.
   Pittston has staggered vacations, so its mines continue running,
he said.
   The estimated number of miners involved in wildcat strikes,
according to union and industry officials, are: West Virginia,
16,000; Illinois, 8,500; Pennsylvania, 6,900; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio,
2,560; Kentucky, 2,325; Indiana, 1,750; Virginia, 755; Missouri,
350; and Tennessee, 200.

   Coast Guard and cleanup crews battled
strong wind and rough water Saturday to survey and try to contain a
250,000-gallon oil spill from a barge ruptured in a collision in the
Houston Ship Channel.
   The winds of more than 15 mph with higher gusts prevented workers
from surrounding the barge with containment booms until late
morning, Chief Petty Officer Mark Kennedy said.
   He said the Panamanian-registered motor vessel Rachel-B collided
around 6:20 p.m. Friday with one of three barges being driven by a
tugboat owned by Coastal Towing. Investigators have not determined
who was at fault for the accident.
   The collision ruptured and emptied three of 12 tanks on one of
the barges, and each tank was holding about 2,000 barrels or 84,000
gallons of heavy crude oil, Kennedy said.
   The first major oil spill in eight years in the ship channel came
just a few hours after 1 million gallons of heating oil spilled from
a tanker off Rhode Island.
   After the remaining oil was pumped out of the damaged barge and
it was towed away Saturday, authorities reopened eight miles of the
channel they had closed from the area where it begins running inland
to Houston from upper Galveston Bay. The 40-foot-deep channel
continues through the bay southeast to Galveston, on the Gulf of
Mexico.
   The accident occurred in the bay where the ship channel
intersects with the Bayport Channel, as the tug headed inland and
the other vessel, a tanker whose cargo was not determined, headed
outbound, officials said.
   The tug operator, fearing a worse spill if the barge overturned,
maneuvered it after the accident out of the deep channel until it
was grounded in shallow water, official said.
   When the weather finally allowed a Coast Guard helicopter flight
late Saturday morning, the aerial look showed the slick stretching
two miles to the Galveston Bay shoreline between Red Bluff and the
Bayport Channel, Kennedy said. It was nearly continuous and about a
mile wide at its widest point, he said.
   The barge owner hired a contractor, Garner Environmental, to
contain and clean up the spill, Kennedy said. Workers laid booms
around the barge and also to direct the flow of the spill away from
shore and into the Bayport Channel.
   ``It looks pretty good at this point. If we can get it contained
within Bayport Channel, it should be fairly easy to clean up,''
Kennedy said. ``Some of the slick is already being driven into that
area by the winds and rains, so they're just trying to funnel it all
in.''
   Kennedy said there had been no reports of damage to fish and
wildlife.
   ``Fortunately this is an area of the bay where there are not many
environmentally sensitive areas,'' he said, adding that the flow of
the spill apparently did not endanger shrimp grounds or oyster beds
in the bay.
   The last major spill in Galveston Bay occurred in 1981 when the
Olympic Gloria dumped about 7,000 barrels of oil after a collision
with a tanker.

   Ribbons of heating oil drifted at least 20
miles and washed onto Rhode Island shores Saturday from a tanker
that grounded in one of three accidents that together spilled as
much as 3.35 million gallons of oil.
   In the Delaware River near Wilmington, Del., a Uruguayan oil
tanker carrying 28 million gallons of industrial heating oil ran
aground Saturday morning, and its crew reported the spill as 1.6
million gallons.
   Todd Nelson, a Coast Guard spokesman, said there was no way to
know exactly how much spilled because a significant amount of oil
may have sunk. ``We are going to go with that because we want to be
ready to respond to a worst-case scenario.''
   In the Houston Ship Channel at Galveston Bay, Texas, about
250,000 gallons of heavy crude oil spilled from a tug-driven barge
damaged in a collision with a cargo vessel Friday evening.
   The Rhode Island accident spilled 1 million to 1.5 million
gallons of fuel, authorities said.
   Together, the accidents were the worst setback for the oil
shipping industry since nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oil
gushed into Alaskan waters from the tanker Exxon Valdez, causing the
nation's worst oil spill.
   As workers began the delicate task of unloading the damaged
tanker at the mouth of Narragansett Bay, officials closed beaches
and shellfishing beds and promised a criminal investigation.
   ``I'm real angry,'' said Gov. Edward DiPrete, who called out
National Guardsmen and prison inmates to help with the cleanup.
``This amounts to gross negligence, no question about it.'' He said
the Greek tanker's captain admitted making a mistake in plotting the
530-foot ship's course before hitting well-marked Brenton Reef in
Rhode Island Sound on Friday afternoon.
   The fuel that leaked from the tanker World Prodigy off Newport's
southern tip ranged from a light film to a thicker coating that
turned the surf orange.
   The oil, which spread primarily north and west, formed ``ribbons
... here and there'' that were difficult to track and contain, said
Capt. Eric Williams of the Coast Guard's Providence marine safety
office. Some had been found in Greenwich Bay, an inlet about 20
miles north along Narragansett Bay.
   The oil washed onto a sandy beach at Beaver Tail State Park and
rocky shores south of Jamestown, across from Newport, said Chip
Young of the environmental group Save the Bay.
   Authorities closed several beaches along the bay and Atlantic
Ocean coasts and banned shellfishing, fishing and swimming in the
bay because the light oil was potentially toxic, said Robert L.
Bendick Jr., director of the state Department of Environmental
Management.
   Cleanup crews strung absorbent booms at sensitive coves and
inlets, extending a containment effort that began Friday when booms
were dropped around the ship. The light, refined oil dispersed
rapidly, which hastened evaporation but meant ``more booms, more
people; it's a logistical nightmare,'' said George Wilson, vice
president of Clean Harbors, a cleanup company.
   DiPrete called out 200 National Guardsmen and 120 state prison
inmates to help.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, part of a team sent by President
Bush to tour the area and assess the spill's impact, said,
``technology is just not up to the job.''
   ``It could have been a lot worse than it was,'' Lujan said in a
telephone interview upon his return to Washington. ``It was a big
spill. But I'm very pleased overall. We do learn things. And what we
learned from the Alaska spill was that a quick response is the best
response.
   ``Things are very much under control now,'' he said. ``We've got
it contained. The ship's not leaking anymore.''
   Crews began unloading onto barges the estimated 5.5 million
gallons of oil still on board the World Prodigy. Pumping raised the
ship's bow from about 18 inches above the water to 8 or 9 feet,
Coast Guard officials said.
   Workers hoped to have the oil pumped out of the tanker in three
days, Williams said.
   ``It's a very delicate balance right now. You don't know what
other internal damage has been done to the tanks,'' said Lt. Phillip
Biedenbender, an off-loading specialist with the Coast Guard.
   Thomas Connell, a spokesman for state Attorney General James
O'Neil, said his office was preparing search warrants for the ship,
which was under federal control, and would start a grand jury
investigation Monday.
   DiPrete said lawsuits were more likely than criminal charges.
   ``The result may have been criminal but the evidence that is
there would point toward civil'' action, he said.
   In Delaware, Nelson said the most immediate problem was that the
oil has sunk.
   ``We believe that there's a significant amount of oil that is
below the surface. This is so close to the weight of water that it
may travel several miles before it surfaces.
   ``There's just no possible way to contain that oil,'' he said.
   Nelson said clean-up crews on the Delaware will have to track the
oil's path as best they can and attack it when it surfaces.
   Containment booms were placed along creeks, tributaries and bird
sanctuaries around the spill in Delaware, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. Officials expressed relief that the oil was refined
and therefore not as toxic as it could be.
   Lujan also toured the Delaware spill at President Bush's request.
   ``That was supposed to be as big as the one in Rhode Island. We
flew over the whole river by helicopter, but it didn't seem that
extensive,'' he said. ``There is a lot of speculation that perhaps
it is not even 200,000 gallons. It's not a terrible one.''
   In Texas, the response to the Friday night spill in the upper
portion of Galveston Bay was hampered by high winds and seas spawned
by numerous thunderstorms, officials said.
   But Chief Petty Officer Mark Kennedy said the choppy conditions
spawned by a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico were actually
helping the cleanup efforts by Saturday afternoon.
   Coast Guard officials got their first aerial view of the
mile-wide spill late Saturday morning when winds receded enough to
allow helicopter travel. Gusty winds and choppy water returned later
in the day.
   Workers constructed a boom around the mouth of Bayport Channel in
an effort to capture most of the slick, which stretched two miles to
the shoreline, Kennedy said.

   Exiled musicians from South Africa, a Zulu choir
and Paul Simon brought thousands of Soviets to their feet for two
hours Saturday as Simon's ``Graceland'' tour opened in Moscow.
   Some 5,000 people, including many foreigners, gathered on a warm
evening in Gorky Park for the concert. The musicians included the
10-man Zulu choir, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and South African exiles
Miriam Makeba, a singer, and Hugh Masekela, a trumpeter.
   It was the first Soviet appearance by the 47-year-old Simon, and
the official Tass news agency indicated it was the first time black
South African musicians have performed in Moscow. The Soviet Union
and South Africa do not have diplomatic relations.
   For the $9 admission price, spectators were treated to the
hymn-like a cappella harmonies of the Zulu choir, Masekela's ballad
about trains bringing blacks to work in South African mines, and
songs by Simon, who sang works ranging from ``Graceland'' to ``The
Sound of Silence.''
   By Western standards Soviet audiences are usually sedate, but
when Simon took the stage hundreds of spectators crowded before him
to dance and sing. Thousands more stood on benches, clapping and
tapping their feet to the beat.
   The tour is based on Simon's Grammy Award-winning record
``Graceland,'' a fusion of American pop and black South African
music. A second concert was scheduled Sunday in Gorky Park before
the tour leaves for West Germany.
   The tour began in Brussels on June 15.
   Before Simon arrived in Moscow, Tass quoted him as saying, ``the
place I was most curious to play was Russia.
   ``Now, with the political tensions relaxing, I know from the
point of view of Americans that there's just a great feeling of
relief and interest in Russians and Russian culture,'' Simon was
quoted as saying.

   Wynton Marsalis woke his band up early Saturday,
even though they had played a late show the night before to help
kick off this year's JVC Jazz Festival.
   Marsalis had an important piece of business to take care of
Saturday afternoon. He was passing on the tradition.
   In a delightful program called ``Cooling It With Snoopy,''
Marsalis used his trumpet to entertain a theater full of children,
giving both the kids and their parents plenty to enjoy.
   Marsalis has won wide acclaim for his jazz recordings and
performances. He has carved out a second career as a classical
artist. All the time he has maintained yet another career, less
celebrated but perhaps likely to have as much or more impact as his
performances.
   That's Wynton Marsalis the teacher. He devotes much of his time
to clinics for student musicians at all levels.
   Saturday he looked out at an audience whose members were mostly
too young to have begun music lessons. His job was to give them the
bug _ get them interested.
   Snoopy paraded down the center aisle of New York's Town Hall
theater as Marsalis, members of his regular group and a few friends
played the familiar theme from the Peanuts television specials.
   Then Marsalis explained to Snoopy how a jazz band was put
together. The bass walks. ``The drums in a jazz band are like the
motor in a car,'' he said. ``It gives it the energy, the drive.''
   The saxophone, trumpet, trombone and clarinet can be mournful,
happy, wild and restrained, Marsalis explained _ and the musicians
demonstrated.
   Marsalis had the audience counting the four beats in a jazz
shuffle, the three beats of a waltz and the 12 measures in the blues.
   One of the highlights was the performance of 13-year-old Amani
A.W. Murray on alto sax and 12-year-old Jason Marsalis, Wynton's
brother, on drums. ``I want you to hear how kids play jazz,'' Wynton
said. In the case of these two, kids play jazz amazingly well.
   Judging by the audience's reaction to Marsalis, Snoopy and host
Murray Horwitz, director of cultural affairs programming at National
Public Radio, the concert was a whopping success.

   Benjamin Spencer, grandson of the late
philanthropist John D. Rockefeller III, committed suicide in a motel
room, a medical investigator said.
   Spencer, 24, left notes for his family and friends, and several
empty drug bottles were found in the room Thursday, police said.
   The cause of death appeared to be an overdose of prescription
drugs, said Dr. Kris Sperry, of the Office of the Medical
Investigator, who performed an autopsy Friday. Sperry added,
however, that test results were not yet available.
   Spencer's body was found by a housekeeper at the Howard Johnson
Plaza, police said.
   A neighbor who asked not to be identified said Spencer had
appeared unhappy recently.
   ``I knew him enough to say that this doesn't come as a complete
surprise,'' the neighbor said. ``I know he wasn't sleeping; he was
up at three or four in the morning. And when he would come down to
visit, even to get him to smile _ the easiest social things _ was
hard.''
   Spencer's mother, Hope Aldrich, is the daughter of Rockefeller,
who died in 1978. She lives in Santa Fe and publishes a weekly
newspaper.
   Besides his mother, Spencer is survived his father, John Spencer
of Vermont; and two brothers, David and Theo.
   Rockefeller was the grandson and namesake of the founder of the
Standard Oil Co.

   The season's second tropical depression formed off
Texas and could hit parts of the Gulf Coast with 10 inches of rain,
the National Hurricane Center reported Saturday.
   Winds reached 35 mph around the poorly defined center of the
system southeast of Corpus Christi, and were expected to push tides
3 feet above normal along the Texas and Louisiana shores.
   Rainfall in excess of 10 inches is possible in that area, said
forecaster Miles Lawrence.
   The system was drifting slowly northward and little change is
indicated, he said.
   The tropical depression would be upgraded to the season's first
storm and named Allison if sustained winds reach 39 mph. The 1989
Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 and ends Nov. 30.

   Rock-throwing youths battled with police
Saturday after rallies by a minority workers' group and the
right-wing British National Party. Two officers were injured and 79
demonstrators were arrested, authorities said.
   Police, anticipating clashes between the groups, deployed more
than 700 officers and the government banned marches that were to
have followed the rallies that drew a total of about 400 people.
   Police ringed the rally sites of the National Party and a local
organization of workers from the Indian and Pakistani community in
this city 180 miles northwest of London. Mounted officers, dog
handlers and riot squads carrying shields and wearing helmets stood
by.
   The clashes occurred after the rallies when police moved in to
clear the town center of demonstrators. A police statement reported
no fights between the groups but that youths broke windows and
severely vandalized a pub.
   Police estimated 250 people attended the workers' rally. The
British National Party supporters, estimated by police at 150, held
a half-hour meeting and most left town in buses. The National Party
is a small, white neo-Nazi organization.
   A police spokesman said that after the rallies, groups of young
people in the town center threw rocks and other objects at police.
Officers carrying shields were sent into the area.
   Youths set off a smoke bomb and attempted to barricade one road,
police said. Nineteen cases of vandalism were reported, they said.

   Israeli soldiers raided villages in the occupied
West Bank on Saturday to arrest suspected participants in the
Palestinian uprising and wounded at least six Arabs, according to
the army and Arab reports.
   They also said a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with
Israel was killed at a detention center in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Israeli authorities said a U.S. relief worker, kidnapped in the
Gaza Strip and released Friday after being held for 30 hours,
apparently cooperated with his Palestinian captors. Israeli radio
described the victim, Chris George, 35, as ``hostile toward Israel''
and Israeli television said security authorities were considering
taking unspecified measure against him.
   The army said ``many suspects'' were arrested in the raids on
several West Bank villages.
   Arab reporters said that four women ages 19 to 46 were shot and
wounded in the arms and legs during a raid on the village of Jaba.
   They said women rushed to the streets and protested when soldiers
ordered males ages 12 to 45 to the village school's courtyard.
Troops then beat some of the men, the reporters said.
   An army spokesman said soldiers encountered ``a violent
resistance by Jaba residents'' and wounded three Palestinians in
clashes.
   The army command confirmed a total of six wounded in the raids.
Arab hospital officials said at least seven were wounded.
   At the Ketziot detention center in the Gaza Strip, a 23-year-old
Palestinian carried the body of Mohammed Faraj Abu Jadalla out of a
tent, threw it in front of a guard and said he strangled Jadalla
because the man collaborated with Israeli authorities, the news
agency Itim said.
   Palestinian reporters said the 22-year-old detainee was beaten
and strangled.
   At least 65 suspected collaborators are among the 531
Palestinians killed in the 18{-month uprising against Israeli rule
of the occupied lands. Twenty-three Israelis also have died.
   Palestinians in the territories heeded calls from the Moslem
fundamentalist Hamas movement and staged a general strike on
Saturday to protest the desecration of the Holy Koran by Israeli
soldiers.
   A soldier recently used pages of a Koran as toilet paper. He
later said he could not read Arabic and apologized publicly.
   In scattered clashes in Gaza, soldiers shot and wounded at least
four Palestinians, Arab hospital officials reported. The army said
it was checking the reports.
   George, co-director of the Save the Children Foundation, was
kidnapped Thursday by three men. After his release, he said his
abduction was ``not only immoral but also a criminal act.''
   A senior Israeli security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``It is clear that George did not stage the
kidnapping itself, but he apparently cooperated with the abductors
from the moment he was taken.''
   Israel television's Arabic-language broadcast said security
authorities were considering taking measures against George but it
did not elaborate.
   George was not available for comment Saturday.

<TEXT>
   The military announced Saturday it will shoot
down private planes violating Cuban air space on grounds they
probably are engaged in drug smuggling.
   An armed forces announcement also said a military honor tribunal
was scheduled to convene Sunday in the case of Division Gen. Arnaldo
Ochoa Sanchez, a decorated combat veteran accused of having links
with a Colombian cocaine cartel.
   Both announcements were published in Granma, the official
newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.
   Earlier this week Granma published a lengthy report of a drug
scandal that led to the arrests of Ochoa, a brigadier general, two
colonels, a lieutenant colonel, a captain and a major.
   The report on aircraft said Cuba has been hospitable to Caribbean
air traffic but it now must act to stop drug-smuggling planes from
using its airspace.
   ``Private aircraft often violate Cuban airspace and refuse to
land despite repeated warnings,'' the statement said. ``Such
irregular flights ... can only be explained as drug trafficking
activity.
   ``We will be obliged to shoot, however disagreeable it might be,
at whatever aircraft ... refuses to obey orders to land for
inspection,'' it added.
   U.S. Federal Aviation Administraton officials in Miami said Cuba
has been granting overflight permission almost automatically to
commercial and private planes. It also has allowed unauthorized
flights to pass through its airspace for a variety of reasons,
including weather and emergencies.
   Ochoa will go before a 47-member military tribunal, accused of
disgracing the nation by allegedly collaborating with Colombia's
Medellin cartel in smuggling cocaine to the United States.
   He was arrested June 12. Cuba reported after his arrest that 10
other military officers and government officials were accused of
accepting bribes from drug traffickers.
   U.S. prosecutors have said the names of some of the officers
became known during an investigation in Miami of a Cuban smuggling
ring that led to two indictments and a trial in Florida in 1988.
   ``It is clear that these arrests (of the Cuban officers) are
substantially connected to information generated at this trial,''
U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen told The Associated Press in Miami.
   He did not identify the other officers. The Miami Herald said the
Bush administration may ask Cuba for permission to interview Ochoa.
   Ochoa and the other defendants are accused of letting smugglers
use military airports and of escorting drug-laden boats through
Cuban waters.
   U.S. authorities said an undercover agent in the 1987
investigation flew into Cuba's Varadero air base escorted by Cuban
MiGs and used Cuban military frequencies.
   Granma acknowledged on Thursday that President Fidel Castro
ordered the investigation that led to Ochoa's arrest after the U.S.
charges that Cuba was being used as a transshipment point for
cocaine.
   The scandal, the first public admission that Cuba has been
touched by the drug trade, created an uproar in Havana. People
mobbed news vendors Saturday buying copies of Granma before they
could even reach the newsstands.
   Ochoa, 57, is a veteran of the Cuban revolution and was a field
commander in Angola in 1987 and 1988. He is one of only five
officers to receive the medal of the Hero of the Republic of Cuba.
   Granma, in its report Saturday, portrayed him as a man obsessed
with money and said, ``A true revolution will never permit impunity.
We shall wash in an exemplary manner outrages like this one.''
   Granma did not say if the military tribunal would meet in public
session, but an official of the Foreign Ministry said ``it must be
in a large place, because of the great interest this has generated.''
   The newspaper said among the members of the honor tribunal are
four division generals, 31 brigadier generals, a vice admiral and a
rear admiral.
   The tribunal, to be headed by Division Gen. Ulises Rosales de
Toro, will make recommendations regarding Ochoa to the Communist
Party and the government, Granma said.
   One of the Miami cases involved Hugo Ceballos, a Venezuelan
convicted on a 10-count indictment last year that accused him of
bringing cocaine through Cuba to the Florida Keys.
   In March, Reinaldo Ruiz and three others pleaded guilty to a
related 27-count indictment and are awaiting sentencing. Ruiz
allegedly headed a Caribbean-based smuggling ring that involved
Cuban military officials.
   The only Cuban official publicly named in the Ruiz case was
``Fidel'' _ a possible reference to Castro _ who Ruiz, on a secretly
recorded videotape, claimed was pocketing bribes from smugglers
using Cuban territory.
   ``The money went right in Fidel's drawer,'' Ruiz boasted to an
undercover agent on the tape. He also said he landed at military
airports and had drug-smuggling boats escorted through Cuban waters
by military torpedo boats.

<TEXT>
   Two commanders in the intelligence division of
the capital's police department were arrested Saturday on charges
they took part in the 1984 slaying of investigative reporter Manuel
Buendia.
   Officers Juventio Prado Hurtado and Raul Perez Carmona are being
held at the Northern Penitentiary, officials reported.
   A source at the Mexico City police department said three agents
in the intelligence division also were arrested. The source,
speaking on condition of anonymity, did not elaborate.
   The police department announced it will restructure the
scandal-tainted intelligence division. Critics compare it to the
Federal Security Administration that was disbanded in 1985 because
of corruption.
   Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez, director of the Federal Security
Administration at the time it was closed, has been indicted on
charges of being the mastermind of the the killing of Buendia on May
30, 1984.
   Francisco Villa, a spokesman for the Mexico City police
department, said Prado and Carmona were subdirectors in the
disbanded federal agency, which was similar to the FBI. Villa said
they are now commanders in the intelligence division.
   Several members of the Federal District Assembly, or city
council, have accused the intelligence division of human rights
violations and said it also should be disbanded.
   Villa said the division will be restructured but details have not
been worked out.
   Zorrilla, 47, is accused of having Buendia slain, allegedly
because of fear the columnist would report links to prominent drug
traffickers.
   Buendia, in his column in the newspaper Excelsior and in books,
exposed wrongdoing in high places and wrote about other politically
sensitive subjects.
   His murder galvanized the Mexican press and it has pressed two
successive federal administrations to solve the case. A year ago the
Mexico City district attorney publicly mentioned Zorrilla as a
suspect.
   On the fifth anniversary of Buendia's death the news media again
raised questions about the investigation and Zorrilla, a former
congressman.
   Shortly afterward, Zorrilla was arrested and charged with murder.

   Authorities raised gasoline and diesel-fuel
prices Sunday by at least 40 percent, the latest in a series of
sharp price increases.
   The official PAP news agency said the increases are needed to
help control the demand for automotive fuel. Long lines have formed
outside many service stations in recent weeks and some stations have
closed early because of a lack of gasoline.
   Price increases, listed according to the equivalent in U.S.
gallons and dollars are: High-octane gasoline raised from $1.13 per
gallon to $1.58. Low octane from 90 cents to $1.35. Diesel fuel from
59 cents to $1.04.
   The average monthly income in Poland is about $117.
   It was the third increase in gasoline prices since Jan. 1. Prices
for sugar and washing machines were raised last week.
   Inflation in 1989 is running at an annual rate of more than 100
percent.

   Two pieces of 18th century furniture
brought $180,000 on Saturday as descendants auctioned the estate of
Declaration of Independence signer Josiah Bartlett.
   ``Oh, my gosh!'' exclaimed Ruth Ready, Bartlett's
great-great-great-great granddaughter, as a representative of the
state made the winning bid of $100,000 for a maple highboy. ``I
didn't think they were going to bid for that.''
   Massachusetts antique dealer Wayne Pratt of Marlborough won an
apothecary chest used by Bartlett, founder of the New Hampshire
Medical Society, for $80,000. Bartlett's handwritten labels are
still on the drawers.
   ``It was probably the best example of that kind of thing I've
ever seen in my life,'' said Pratt, who runs antique stores in
Marlborough and on Nantucket. ``It's a fantastic piece of
furniture.''
   D. Byers, an associate of auctioneer Martin Willis, received some
bids by telephone. Willis said the $100,000 bid for the highboy, a
tall chest of drawers, was the most ever paid for such a piece.
   Winning bidders also had to pay an extra 10 percent of their bids
for the auctioneer's commission.
   The extensive collection of letters, papers, clothing and
furniture was auctioned under huge tents in a field adjacent to the
1774 Bartlett homestead. About 500 people attended.
   In addition to signing the Declaration, Bartlett served as
president of New Hampshire and later as its governor, as well as a
judge.
   He signed the Articles of Confederation, by which the nation was
governed before the Constitution, and played a role in New
Hampshire's decisive ratification of the U.S. Constitution in June
1788.
   Bartlett's papers included a 1743 copy book from his school days
in Amesbury, Mass., where he was born in 1729; official
correspondence; a 1748 receipt for payments to the families of two
soldiers and an Indian killed near Concord, N.H., during the French
and Indian War; Bartlett's charter for the New Hampshire Medical
Society; and a copy of a handwritten biography of Josiah Bartlett by
his son Levi.
   The New Hampshire Historical Society spent an estimated $55,000
at the auction, paying $13,500 for a printed version of the original
charter of the New Hamsphsire Medical Society.
   There also was a 1765 agreement, believed to be one of the first
of its kind in the colonies, making Dr. Amos Gale an apprentice in
Bartlett's medical practice.
   Only a handful of the estates of the signers of the Declaration
of Independence remain with their descendants, according to state
archivist Frank Mevers.
   Ready, 38, owns the home with her aunt, Janet Donahue of New
Rochelle, N.Y., who wanted to settle the rest of the estate.
   Ready said they had a choice between dividing everything and
selling it item by item or having an auction. She hopes to buy her
aunt's half of the house with her proceeds from the auction.
   Donahue, 71, said she regretted parting with family heirlooms,
but felt she needed to because of financial reasons. But she was
pleased to see some of the articles stay in the public domain.
   ``I would like to see the whole country get to know Josiah and
what he did,'' she said.

   Environmentalists and timber industry
officials were unable to reach an agreement Saturday over the
conflicting needs of loggers and spotted owls.
   Members of Oregon's congressional delegation and Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt spent the day questioning representatives from both
sides. Environmentalists and loggers are battling over the future of
Oregon's old growth forests, where the dwindling population of
Northern spotted owls nest.
   Meanwhile, at the state Capitol a few blocks away, hundreds of
loggers, millworkers and their families rallied in support of the
timber industry.
   Many wore yellow ribbons, symbolizing their view that the
industry is being held hostage by environmental lawsuits over the
spotted owl.
   ``As far as they're concerned, if we turned the whole damned
state into a park that would be dandy,'' said state Rep. Peg Jolin,
whose husband works in sawmill.
   Estimated to number fewer than 6,000 in the Northwest, the owl
hunts and nests almost exclusively in the old growth forests that
produce the logs most prized by the timber industry. Proposals are
being considered that would designate the spotted owl a threatened
species.
   At the owl summit, the timber industry found an ally in
Goldschmidt when he called for legislation to prohibit legal
challenges in court once the administrative process was exhausted
over national forest planning.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., opposed the idea, saying the massive
Exxon Valdez oil spill might have been averted if environmental
groups hadn't been barred from court challenges over the Alaska oil
pipeline.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, chairman of the meeting, was unable to get
the two sides to agree about how much old growth is remaining. The
timber industry maintains there are 7.5 million acres of old growth
in Oregon and Washington; the Wilderness Society says it is more
like 2.1 million acres.
   ``Is there any way we can get these groups together to stipulate
with some kind of consistency?'' Hatfield asked.
   During the meeting, Larry Tuttle, Oregon director of the
Wilderness Society, agreed to closely examine millions of acres of
timberlands that lie between the old growth estimates in an effort
to help free up some timber for immediate use.
   Goldschmidt challenged whether environmentalists were truly
willing to compromise.
   ``Is it really possible for you folks to engage in a serious
discussion of timber supply?'' Goldschmidt asked. ``You keep taking
away from the base.''
   The meeting was called by Goldschmidt, Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore.,
and Hatfield, R-Ore. The wood products industry is the biggest
single industry in Oregon.

   Thousands of people marched through London Saturday
in support of homosexual rights.
   Scotland Yard police headquarters said an estimated 13,000 people
participated in the peaceful march led by members of the Lesbian and
Gay Pride organization.
   The procession began in Hyde Park, passed through Parliament
Square, crossed Westminster Bridge and ended with a rally in
Kennington Park.
   Actor Ian McKellen addressed the crowd and urged more homosexual
men and women to make public their sexuality by ``coming out.''
   ``Why are there not more actors who are out in this country, more
teachers, more lawyers, more members of the royal family?'' he asked.
   Labor Party legislator Chris Smith also spoke at the rally and he
said he wanted to see a society where everyone was ``proud and open
about their sexuality and what they do.''
   In New York City about 600 people marched from Greenwich Village
to Central Park for a rally marking Lesbian and Gay Pride Weekend.
Organizers expected more than 200,000 people for a parade Sunday
down New York's Fifth Avenue in the main event of the weekend.
   The events wind up a month of activities commemorating the 20th
anniversary of the Stonewall Rebellion on June 27, 1969, when
homosexual patrons fought back during a police raid on the Stonewall
Inn in Greenwich Village.

<TEXT>
   Communist Yugoslavia's first
independent political group called for democratic reform at a
congress in the liberal republic of Slovenia Saturday, the state
news agency Tanjug said.
   Addressing some 200 delegates of the Slovenian Democratic Union,
leader Dimitrij Rupel said the group will strive to compete with the
League of Communists, the only legal party in Yugoslavia since World
War II.
   In January, Rupel said at his organization's constituent assembly
in Ljubljana that the group will work toward parliamentary
democracy, free elections and the free exchange of ideas.
   Representatives of the Slovenian Socialist Alliance, a
communist-run umbrella organization, and the Slovenian Communist
Party, also addressed the congress, the union's first, Tanjug said.
   Yugoslavia, a loose federation of six republics and two provinces
containing various nationalities and religions is passing through
its worst economic and political crisis. Annual inflation exceeds
600 percent, Europe's highest, unemployment is widespread and there
has been an alarming increase in social and ethnic tension.
   Northern Slovenia is the nation's most developed and most liberal
republic. The republic's communist leadership advocates regional
autonomy, closer ties with the West and has indicated an openness to
democratic elections.
   The Democratic Union is the first of several political
associations that have been formally constituted in Slovenia.
   Slovenian liberalism has been viewed with misgivings by communist
leaders in the country's other republics, particualarly in Serbia,
Yugoslavia's government center. There, orthodox communists oppose
reforms as a step toward restoration of the Western-style democracy
that Yugoslavia had before the war, favoring greater central control
and a stronger federal government.
   The clash between the two republics, characterized by official
media as a propaganda campaign between two countries at war, has
generated Serbian and Slovenian nationalist feelings.

   Government and rebel forces honored the
first day of a truce Saturday in the 14-year-old war between the
Marxist government and Western-backed rebels, a government official
said.
   ``Hostilities have ceased, but it is necessary to keep vigilance
and be ready for combat so that the peace that has been launched
becomes real and lasting,'' Interior Minister Francisco Magalhaes
Paiva said.
   Angolans crowded around newspaper stands in Luanda, the capital,
looking for more details of the cease-fire accord that went into
effect Saturday, two days after it was signed by President Eduardo
dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it
was difficult to tell if the cease-fire was holding because most
fighting has been concentrated near the Namibian border, about 600
miles south of Luanda.
   The rebel radio carried an announcement that the cease-fire was
in place, and Angola's state radio broadcast an appeal to troops to
put down their weapons.
   The peace accord was reached Thursday in Gbadolite, Zaire, during
a summit of 20 African leaders.
   Vice Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura told Luanda's diplomatic
corps on Saturday that Savimbi had ``tacitly accepted'' in Gbadolite
to ``voluntarily and temporarily'' withdraw his forces from Angola,
diplomats said.
   One diplomat also said de Moura told them that Savimbi ``wants to
be a special counselor to the U.S. government.''
   The Portugese news agency Lusa on Saturday quoted unnamed Angolan
officials as saying Savimbi could become Angola's representative to
the United States for a period of two years.
   Angola has been pushing for diplomatic recognition by the United
States. There was no indication the appointment of Savimbi, whose
guerrilla movement was backed by the United States, would lead to
recognition.
   Media coverage of the Gbadolite summit here was sparse and most
Angolans were unaware of the terms of the pact, which calls for
integration of rebel forces into Angolan society and the creation of
a national reconciliation commission headed by President Mobutu Sese
Seko of Zaire.
   Zairean Vice Premier Nimy Mayabika delivered a message to dos
Santos on Saturday and said he was in Luanda ``to accelerate the
implementation of the principles agreed on at Gbadolite.''
   The guerrilla movement, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, controls areas in southeastern Angola
occupied by up to 3 million of the country's 9 million people. The
group is known by its Portugese acronym, UNITA.
   In reports on state-controlled radio and television, Savimbi was
referred to Saturday as ``UNITA president.'' In the past he was
referred to as ``traitor,'' ``Judas,'' or ``bandit leader.''
   The Gbadolite summit was the first meeting between dos Santos and
Savimbi since the battle for power broke out in 1975 shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal.
   Mobutu, long a Savimbi ally and credited with a prominent role in
the truce, is to meet President Bush in Washington on Thursday to
discuss peace in southern Africa, said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   UNITA, backed by South Africa and the United States, has been
fighting to share power with dos Santos' Marxist Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola, which is supported by Cuban forces and
Soviet arms.
   The cease-fire follows U.S.-brokered regional peace accords
Angola signed in New York in December with Cuba and South Africa.
   Under the accords, South Africa agreed to allow Angola's southern
neighbor, Namibia, to gain independence under a U.N. plan and halt
aid to Savimbi's guerrillas. In exchange, Cuba agreed to a phased
withdrawal of its estimated 50,000 troops backing dos Santos'
government. UNITA was not party to the agreement.

   The U.S. Air Line Pilots Association says Canadian
investigators relied on fabricated and erroneous evidence when they
probed the 1985 Gander crash that killed 256 Americans.
   The charge is contained in a letter sent this week to the
Canadian Aviation Safety Board, which investigated the crash of the
Arrow Air DC-8 carrying U.S. troops home for Christmas from a
peacekeeping mission in the Middle East.
   Canadian investigators used a computer simulation to reconstruct
the plane's flight path, which gave crucial support to the
investigators' theory that wing ice caused the aircraft to stall and
crash after takeoff on Dec. 12, 1985.
   But Harold Marthinsen, director of accident investigation for the
U.S. association said in the nine-page letter that he suspected the
simulator used manufactured data.
   ``It should be clear they simply conjured up their trajectory
with faulty, or perhaps more to the point, fabricated data,''
Marthinsen said. ``This (simulation) ... represents technical
dishonesty at its highest.''
   In Washington, officials of the pilot's association were
unavailable for comment Saturday.
   The letter comes at a critical point in the saga of the worst
aviation disaster in Canada.
   The Canadian federal government is to receive a report within the
next week from an independent investigator, former Supreme Court
justice Willard Estey. Appointed in March, Estey will appraise the
probe and suggest whether a judicial inquiry is warranted.
   A majority of five Canadian investigating board members concurred
with a final report issued in December, but four dissenters said the
plane did not stall and concluded an on-board explosion was probably
at fault.
   In his letter, Marthinsen wrote: ``We have over 20 years of
experience reading out hundreds of metal foil flight recorder
tapes.''
   In all these years, we have not seen such abuse of data as in
this investigation,'' the letter said. ``The flight recorder was put
in airplanes as a tool to assist accident investigators to arrive at
the true causes of accidents. They were not intended to allow
conjecture which suddenly changes to factual conclusions.''
   The crash killed all eight crewmembers and 248 U.S. military
personnel on their way to Ft. Campbell, Ky.

   President Daniel Ortega Saturday
defended the expropriation of three major sugar production
facilities, saying they planned to halt production.
   The expropriations have been sharply criticized by the private
sector.
   The Superior Council of Private Business has accused the leftist
Sandinista government of forcing Nicaragua into ``total
radicalization'' and the Nicaraguan Union of Agricultural Producers
formally broke ties with all government-sanctioned unions and
government agencies.
   The government seized the sugar concerns Wednesday, saying they
had adopted ``irresponsible attitudes in the face of the economic
crisis confronting the country.''
   Ortega Saturday accused the business council and the sugar
concerns of planning to halt production and said they were
``agents'' of ``the terrorist policies of the United States
government.''
   On June 22, the government also took over three coffee
plantations owned by its critics. Ortega accused the growers of
trying to sabotage an economic austerity plan to reduce inflation,
which last year topped 20,000 percent.
   As part of the plan, the Sandinista government earlier this week
ordered a 110 percent devaluation of the cordoba currency, which
sent prices of consumer goods and services skyrocketing.
   At a meeting Sunday in Matagalpa, 80 miles north of the capital,
coffee growers unanimously decided to withdraw from the National
Coffee Commission. They said the panel, made up of government and
private representatives, had ruined the industry.
   Coffee, like sugar, is one of Nicaragua's main export items and a
principal dollar-earner.
   In June 1988, the Sandinista government confiscated the San
Antonio sugar plantation and mills, one of Nicaragua's largest
industries.

   An oil tanker from Uruguay ran aground
early Saturday, spilling as much as 1.6 million gallons of heavy
industrial heating oil in the Delaware River just south of here, the
Coast Guard said.
   ``The ship has told us 1.6 million (gallons),'' said Todd Nelson,
a Coast Guard spokesman. ``We are going to go with that because we
want to be ready to respond to a worst-case scenario.''
   Nelson said there is no way to know exactly how much has spilled
because ``a significant'' amount of oil may have sunk. The ship was
carrying 28 million gallons.
   Earlier the Coast Guard had estimated between 100,000 and 200,000
gallons of refined No. 6 industrial heating oil had leaked from the
Presidente Rivera.
   Claymont is just upriver from Wilmington, the most populated city
in Delaware. Wilmington does not get its drinking water from the
Delaware River.
   Blobs of oil roughly 1 feet to 10 feet in diameter were beginning
to surface Saturday night as far as 6 miles upriver and 7 miles
downriver from the spill, Nelson said.
   The first priority was to unload the ship's cargo so that it
could be floated back into the river's channel with the high tide
Sunday morning, Nelson said. Workers could not unload the ship fast
enough to meet the 7 p.m. high tide Saturday.
   After floating the ship, workers can then concentrate on the
clean-up, he said.
   ``The oil is not particularly toxic and we were told by our
environmental people to be at least as mindful of doing physical
damage to the marshes when placing the booms as being worried about
any long-term damage from the oil,'' said Capt. Larry Murdock, who
supervised the cleanup.
   Containment booms were placed along creeks, tributaries and bird
sanctuaries around the spill. Murdock said officials started with
marshes on the New Jersey side of the river because they thought the
tide would take the oil in that direction.
   The oil was already collecting on the Delaware side of the
shoreline, Nelson predicted it could pose a serious threat to birds.
   ``We're afraid it's just a matter of time'' until birds are
affected, Nelson said.
   Murdock said the cause of the accident was under investigation.
Coast Guard officials had not determined whether the leak had
stopped.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan got an aerial tour of the spill
and said it didn't appear as extensive as he had been told. But the
head of the Environmental Protection Agency, William Reilly, also
toured the site and said the reason it didn't look so bad was likely
because most of the oil had sunk.
   ``It's maddening and it's frustrating,'' said Andrew Altman, who
was among about 100 people who gathered to look at the dirty water.
``America is drunk on oil and the government is asleep at the
wheel.''
   The grounding at 4:45 a.m. ripped open two tanks that contained a
total of 5 million gallons on the bottom of the ship, Murdock said.
   The remaining oil in the two tanks was being transferred to a
barge alongside the vessel.
   Murdock said the ship was carrying 28 million gallons to Sun Co.
at Marcus Hook, Pa., south of Philadelphia. Claymont, Del., is just
south of the Pennsylvania-Delaware border, and across the river from
New Jersey.
   Although the ship was headed upstream, Murdock said it was
pointed downstream after the accident. The bow turned after running
aground, leaving the entire ship wedged on a sandbar.
   Coast Guard Lt. Jim Weakley said the captain of the ship is Raul
de Barrat. Weakly said a local river pilot was on board, but he had
no information on who was piloting the ship at the time of the
accident.
   Weakley said Sun Oil hired a pollution cleanup contractor about
5:40 a.m., and that a Coast Guard pollution investigative team
arrived at 6:30 a.m. The Coast Guard boat arrived at 6:50 a.m.
   ``It is a typical response time,'' Weakley said.
   Murdock said any crew members subject to the investigation would
be investigated for drug or alcohol use.

   For the second time in little more than a
year a sailor has died in a training pool at the Pensacola Naval Air
Station, and an investigation has been ordered, Navy officials said
Saturday.
   A naval aviation reserve officer candidate collapsed and died
Friday in shallow water after completing an abandon-ship drill, said
Navy spokeswoman Maggie Malick.
   Michael J. Fedie, 22, of Altoona, Wis., was participating in a
drill that requires students to jump off a tower and swim a short
distance underwater while holding their breath.
   ``He had completed an abandon-ship drill and was walking out of
the pool when he collpsed,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Robert Tyler.
   After he fell back into the water, safety officers pulled the
trainee from the pool and administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation
before an ambulance took him to the off-base Pensacola Naval
Hospital, Tyler said. Doctors pronounced him dead about 4:15 p.m.
   ``An investigation has been ordered by the chief of naval air
training at the base to determine the circumstances of the death,''
Tyler said.
   Preliminary autopsy results indicated the cause of death was
acute cerebral edema, said Kay Esty, a spokeswoman for the Naval
Education and Training Command. Edema is an abnormal accumulation of
fluid. She said a final autopsy to confirm the cause of death would
not be completed for several weeks.
   Fedie's father, Felix, described his son Saturday as an
``excellent swimmer.''
   Fedie, from Altoona, Wis., said based on his information from the
Navy, it did not appear foul play was involved in his son's death.
   After the March 2, 1988, drowning of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki,
19, of Appleton, Wis., five instructors were disciplined, the
commander of the Naval Aviation Schools Command, Capt. C.L.
Lavinder, was officially reprimanded prior to his retirement and
four other supervisors were given warning letters.
   The death of Mirecki during rescue-swimmer training triggered a
Navy-wide review of hazardous training and resulted in changes in
procedures at the Navy Rescue Swimmer School, including a ban
against touching students by instructors.
   A pathologist concluded that Mirecki had a phobia about being
dragged underwater, which triggered heart failure before he drowned.
   Felix Fedie, father of the sailor who died Friday, called his son
``an excellent swimmer.''
   ``He was a great, great kid,'' Fedie said Saturday from his home
in Altoona, Wis. ``He was smart and outgoing.''
   He said his son planned to return to Wisconsin after the swimming
program to complete an engineering degree at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, and then planned to resume flight training.
   In the Mirecki case, Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, 28,
of Tempe, Ariz., lost a stripe and was sentenced to 90 days in the
brig after being found guilty of negligent homicide at a
court-martial for holding Mirecki's head under water.
   The other four instructors received administrative penalties of
fines or rank reductions, but the officer in charge of the rescue
school, Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, was exonerated at another
court-martial.
   The other instructors had been accused of forcing Mirecki back
into the pool after he had panicked and climbed out, ordering other
students to turn away and sing the national anthem while Combe
dunked him.
   Mirecki's family has filed a $20 million claim against the Navy.

   Residents who served as models for
Norman Rockwell's paintings of small-town life paraded down Main
Street on floats and in convertibles Saturday to celebrate
Stockbridge's 250th anniversary.
   In the background were the familiar backdrops from Rockwell's
Saturday Evening Post covers _the Red Lion Inn, the pharmacy, the
town hall and the fire station.
   In one convertible was former Police Chief William Obanhein, the
``Officer Obie'' made famous by Arlo Guthrie's ballad ``Alice's
Restaurant'' and the movie based on it.
   Next to the chief was Dr. Donald E. Campbell, the general
practitioner who made housecalls for more than 30 years before
retiring this year. Rockwell immortalized him as he patiently held a
hypodermic needle while a bare-bottomed boy checked the medical
degrees hung on his office wall.
   Police said 5,000 to 7,000 people jammed the town for the
festivities, roughly tripling its year-round population.

   Poor visibility and rough currents on
Saturday forced organizers of the first human-powered submarine
races to scrub much of the day's events.
   Race spokeswoman Deb Cronin said the original 1-kilometer loop
course was abandoned after most of the 18 submarines had difficulty
maneuvering their crafts underwater. She also said judges and timers
had problems locating the subs in the rough seas off Riviera Beach,
about 40 miles north of Fort Lauderdale.
   ``We're keeping in mind that no one's ever done this before,''
said Liz Kay, spokeswoman for the Highham, Mass.-based H.A. Perry
Foundation, which organized the event along with Florida Atlantic
University of Boca Raton.
   On Saturday, nine submarines completed the straight 100-yard
course.
   The submarine from California Polytechnic State University in San
Luis Obispo, Calif., beat the sub from the U.S. Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Md., by about eight seconds. Applied Physics Laboratory
of the University of Washington came in third. The California
Polytechnic's sub finished the 100-yard course in 1:16.16.
   Organizers planned more races for Sunday.
   All the subs are ``wet'' designs that fill up with water and
require racers to wear scuba gear. Those propelling the subs say the
biggest challenge is to maintain a steady pace and not breathe too
quickly, which could lead to light-headedness or blackouts due to
oxygen deficiency.
   The awards ceremony is scheduled for Sunday.

   Chuckie Haney was never prouder than when he
was wearing the police uniform officers had made for him. Next week,
the 14-year-old who suffered from a rare brain disease will be
buried in it.
   ``He'd put that uniform on and he'd just think there was nobody
better,'' his mother, Susan Haney, said Friday. ``Being a cop gave
him the chance, in his mind, to be able to help people. That's when
he was at his proudest.''
   Chuckie, whose gallant fight for life won the hearts of former
President Reagan, actor Michael Landon and scores of others, died
Friday at his suburban Los Angeles home.
   ``He had such spirit and courage,'' said Capt. Joe Santoro of the
Monterey Park Police Department, which had the uniform made. ``He
was really and truly a fighter. Everybody here admired him for
that.''
   The youth suffered from adrenoleukodystrophy, an incurable
illness that attacks the brain and nervous system. He had lapsed
into a coma last month.
   Near the bed where he spent his last days were an autographed
baseball from the California Angels and a football from the Chicago
Bears. The White House sent along a wooden Easter egg and police
departments from all over the country sent badges.
   Reagan, while still in office, made Chuckie an honorary member of
the Secret Service. Landon gave the boy's family $2,000.

   A Cuban immigrant protesting his
conviction on drug charges has been on a hunger strike since March 3.
   Rene Acuna, 37, of Detroit, stopped eating after a Macomb County
Circuit Court jury convicted him of conspiracy and delivery of 2
pounds of cocaine. His sentence is life in prison without parole.
   ``I've got honor. I've got dignity. I will be on a hunger strike
until I see justice in my case,'' he said in a telephone interview
from Duane L. Waters Hospital at the State Prison of Southern
Michigan at Jackson.
   Living only on water and coffee with sugar, Acuna, who once
carried 180 pounds on his 5-foot, 5-inch frame, had lost 64 pounds
by Friday.
   Acuna says he was convicted by an all-white jury solely because
he was a Hispanic in a white neighborhood of Warren when an
undercover agent bought cocaine from another Hispanic Aug. 12.
   The prosecution argued Acuna was a lookout.
   The Department of Corrections will go to court to get the
authority to force feed Acuna if his condition worsens, said Deputy
Director Leo Lalonde.

   Caretaker Premier Andreas Papandreou,
hospitalized with pneumonia, experienced heart and kidney
complications early Sunday, hospital officials said.
   The 70-year-old socialist leader, defeated in elections last
Sunday, faces a Tuesday deadline to form a new government. He
received the mandate Friday from President Christos Sartzetakis
after conservatives, who made election gains, failed to form a
governing coalition.
   Papandreou was admitted to the cardiac section of the hospital
Thursday night for treatment of a ``respiratory infection,'' eight
months after he underwent open heart surgery in London.
   In a statement released at 2 a.m. Sunday (7 p.m. EDT Saturday),
the General State Hospital said the premier experienced heart and
kidney problems but did not elaborate. The statement said he
apparently was responding to treatment for pneumonia.
   Papandreou's ex-wife, Margaret, rushed to the hospital, where she
was joined by their four adult children. Mrs. Papandreou left after
an hour and declined to comment.
   Papandreou's 35-year-old live-in girlfriend, former airline
hostess Dimitra Liani, was also at the hospital.
   Papandreou divorced his wife of 38 years just days before the
June 18 general election in which his Panhellenic Socialist Movement
or PASOK, was defeated in its bid for a third consecutive term.
   No one party received an absolute majority in the 300-member
unicameral chamber. PASOK, with 125 seats, finished a distant second
to New Democracy, which won 145.
   President Sartzetakis had asked Papandreou to remain as caretaker
premier until a new government was formed.
   Officials at Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement or
PASOK, said no political consultations on forming a new government
were scheduled during the weekend. Papandreou had been scheduled to
confer with the head of the left-wing coalition, Harilaos Florakis,
to see whether a common ground could be found. Papandreou's support
eroded after his government was linked to a $200 million financial
scandal that forced two Cabinet ministers to step down.
   A leftist coalition, an alliance of the Greek Communist Party and
the Eurocommunists, rejected Mitsotakis' proposal to form a
temporary coalition government to bring socialist officials accused
of wrongdoing to trial before calling new elections.
   In a power-broker's position after receiving 28 parliamentary
places, leftist coalition leaders said they would also turn down
Papandreou's overtures.
   The constitution calls for mandates to be given to all three
leading parties. If they fail to receive Parliament's approval, an
attempt is made by the president to form a national unity government
composed of nonpolitical personalities acceptable to all political
parties.
   If no solution is found by July 3 when the newly elected
Parliament is scheduled to convene, then it is dissolved and a
caretaker regime takes over to lead the country to general elections.

   Unitarian Universalists will create an
underground network to help women get safe abortions if the U.S.
Supreme Court overturns the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, church
officials say.
   ``Let it be known here and now that if Roe versus Wade is
overturned, Unitarian Universalists will do all we can to see that
women still have access to safe abortions,'' Rev. William F. Schulz
said Friday at the Unitarian Universalist Association's annual
assembly.
   There are about 180,000 members of the association, which
includes 1,010 Unitarian and Universalist churches.
   The Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision soon in a
Missouri abortion case that could be used to overturn the Roe vs.
Wade decision that legalized abortions in 1973.
   The Missouri law at issue, passed in 1986, declares that human
life begins at conception. It restricts abortion by banning the
procedure in publicly financed hospitals and by forbidding the use
of public funds.

   The Sunday Express reported Iran might help win the
release of British hostages held in Lebanon if Britain promises to
restore diplomatic relations with the Tehran government and make a
humanitarian gesture.
   The London newspaper quoted a Lebanese-born French citizen, who
helped negotiate the release of French hostages, as saying Iran
holds the key to the release of foreign hostages and that Iranian
leaders want contacts with the West.
   ``All that is required is for Mrs. (Prime Minister Margaret)
Thatcher to send people to Tehran to tell the Iranian leaders: `If
you release our hostages, we will start talks about reopening
diplomatic relations,' the paper quoted Dr. Razah Raad as saying.
   ``This should be followed up by a humanitarian gesture, such as
sending a ship with medical supplies and nursing volunteers to
relieve the terrible suffering of Iranian victims of the war,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   A cease-fire last August brought an end to the fighting between
Iran and Iraq that began in September 1980 over border conflicts.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Anglican envoy Terry Waite,
journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan. Keenan, a native
of Belfast, Northern Ireland, has dual British and Irish nationality.
   A fourth Briton, Jack Mann, a 75-year-old former pilot,
disappeared in Beirut on May 12. A terrorist group, the Cells of
Armed Struggle, claimed in a statement the same day that they
kidnapped a Briton but gave no name.
   Nine Americans are among at least 14 foreign hostages kidnapped
in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, Has been held the longest. He was abducted March
6, 1985.
   The Sunday Express, who called Raad a ``leading hostage
negotiator,'' did not say when it interviewed him.
   Raad has been credited by French authorities as helping win
freedom for some French hostages. The French Foreign Ministry first
sent him to Lebanon in November 1985 to try to negotiate the
captives' release.

   A mile of Orange County coastline was
closed to swimmers after an aging pipeline ruptured and poured
900,000 gallons of raw sewage into a creek that flows into the
ocean, authorities said.
   The stretch of Aliso Beach, closed Friday, could remain off
limits to swimmers for up to a week, health officials said.
   ``Based on the magnitude of the spill, we expect at least part of
the area will remain closed until at least next Friday,'' said
Michael Wehner, chief of the Orange County Health Care Agency's
water quality program. ``This is one of the largest spills we've had
in a while.''
   The spill began when a 40-year-old sewer pipe broke late Thursday
night, said Linda Jones, assistant general manager for the South
Coast Water District.
   Health officials said bacteria in the water could make people ill
if they swim there.
   The spill was the third of the year in the area, about 50 miles
south of Los Angeles. About 100,000 gallons of raw sewage flowed
into the creek last month when stream erosion caused a sewer line to
collapse. Another 175,000 gallons poured into the creek in January
when another line broke.

<TEXT>
   The Mail on Sunday newspaper apologized to its
readers, saying it misled them to think it published the first
interview with author Salman Rushdie since he went into hiding.
   It said it had made a serious omission last week by failing to
say the interview took place weeks before the late Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini urged Moslems to kill Rushdie for his
novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie went into hiding after Khomeini on Feb. 14 accused him of
blaspheming Islam with his novel and ordered him killed. Khomeini
died in a Tehran hospital June 3 after a lengthy illness.
   ``In publishing an interview with Salman Rushdie, we
unquestionably misled some of our readers into believing that it had
been obtained in recent weeks,'' the newspaper said in what it
called an opinion piece in its editions. ``That error _ and it was
serious _ we acknowledge and apologize for.''
   But the newspaper said it was proud of publishing the interview,
which it reported was a reprint of an interview with an American
journalist.
   It called the interview ``a compelling insight of a man on the
edge of the most hideous literary controversy of our time.''
   In printing the interview June 18, The Mail on Sunday did not say
when it had taken place but it did say it occurred ``while
journalists throughout the world have been trying to track down
Rushdie.''
   It said the interview took place in London with Ameena Meer, a
writer for U.S. and Indian literary magazines.
   Rushdie denied giving a new interview and called The Mail on
Sunday article a ``lurid and sensationalized account'' of the
earlier interview.
   Rushdie, 41, is an Indian-born Moslem who is a British citizen.
