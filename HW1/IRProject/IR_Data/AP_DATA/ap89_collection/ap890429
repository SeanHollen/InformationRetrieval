   The producer-director of the miniseries ``War
and Remembrance'' has denied an ``Entertainment Tonight'' report
that an orphan was mistreated during filming in Yugoslavia of the
ABC television movie.
   ``It's an insane allegation,'' Dan Curtis said in a telephone
interview Friday. ``We spent five years telling the story of the
Holocaust and they are trivializing it.''
   ``Entertainment Tonight'' reported Thursday that a 3-year-old
hired from an orphanage in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, was mistreated by
repeatedly being held upside down.
   An unidentified technician with a crew that was filming a
documentary at the same time said, ``The impression we had was that
they didn't want us to shoot the scene because they were possibly
abusing the child. It would be viewed by some as abusing the
child.''
   ABC is investigating the allegations, said Jim Brochu, manager
of business information for ABC.
   The final five parts of the 30-hour miniseries will be telecast
beginning Sunday, May 7.
   The technician said the child screamed during the filming. He
said the crew was asked to leave so that they could not see what
was happening.
   But Curtis said they were asked to leave because the room was
small and the second camera was confusing the child.
   The scene called for Jane Seymour, as Natalie Jastrow Henry, to
be brought to the basement of the SS headquarters with her son,
Louis. The SS officers order her to stop her agitation against the
Nazis and hold her son upside down and threaten to rip him apart.
   Curtis acknowledged that the child had screamed, but said he
began screaming long before the filming began.
   When he was held upside-down he was quiet because stuntmen had
worked with him for a week to make it a game, Curtis said. He said
the child was held upside-down twice for several seconds each time
and not repeatedly as the entertainment program alleged.
   He said it quickly became apparent that the child could not take
direction. Curtis replaced him and reshot the scene with an
American child actor, Hunter Schlesinger.
   ``Entertainment Tonight'' said it had also obtained a memo to
Curtis signed by 70 members of the crew on Feb. 14, 1986, accusing
Curtis of ``exercising power that does not differ greatly from the
method depicted in our film.''
   Curtis said he was unable to read most of the signatures on the
memo.
   ``I went to those whose names I could read,'' he said. ``No one
could answer me why they did it and why they didn't say anything at
the time on the set. I was very angry. It's not true.''
   The director said he told ``Entertainment Tonight'' Friday that
he had made a mistake in trying to use an untrained child as an
actor, but again denied any mistreatment of the child.
   ``I refused to go on `Entertainment Tonight' and defend this
insane allegation,'' Curtis said. ``Why wasn't it brought up at the
time it happened? Why did it suddenly surface a week before we go
on the air?''

   An American television production company has
obtained broadcast rights to the ``Miss U.S.S.R.'' beauty pageant,
which will showcase ``extraordinarily beautiful and fashionable
women,'' a spokesman says.
   Global American Television Inc., an independent producer based
in Colrain, Mass., said Friday it had reached agreement with
Venetz, the official Soviet body governing contests and
entertainment, to acquire tapes of the May 19-21 event in Moscow.
   Global spokesman David Nussbaum said the company was trying to
sell the program to a broadcast outlet but no deal had yet been
made. Terms of the arrangement with the Soviets were not released.
   ``I think we're ready to discard the old images of Russian women
as dowdy, industrial, manual-laboring peasants in shapeless gray
dresses,'' Nussbaum said.
   ``They will be extraordinarily beautiful and fashionable women.
Obviously their population expands and includes so many
nationalities that there's going to be a marvelous variety of women
to appreciate,'' he said.
   Nussbaum said 36 finalists from the Soviet Union's republics
would participate in the pageant, which will include competition in
native costumes, evening gowns, winter clothing and bathing suits.
   The winner of the contest is to be chosen by telephone voting by
Soviet television viewers, he said.
   Global has had a production agreement with the Soviet state
television Gostelradio since 1982 and has broadcast events
including a ``spacebridge'' that was hosted by television
personality Phil Donahue.
   The firm also organized a project last year in which American
television commercials were broadcast on Soviet television for the
first time ever. The ads were dubbed in Russian and included one
for Pepsi-Cola featuring Michael Jackson.

   Magellan, America's first
interplanetary probe in 11 years, is named for a Portuguese
explorer who 467 years ago led the expedition that was the first to
sail around the world.
   After it is deployed in orbit by the space shuttle, the Magellan
probe will travel to Venus in 15 months. The 800-million-mile
voyage will last less than half as long as it took a 16th-century
expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan to sail around the world.
   Magellan, who chose to sail under the Spanish flag, was
commander of a five-ship flotilla that left Seville, Spain on Sept.
20, 1519 to search for a route to the so-called Spice Islands in
the south Pacific.
   The fleet reached South America in December and then sailed
around the southern tip of that continent through what came to be
called the Straits of Magellan.
   After following the west coast of South America, Magellan
directed his fleet across the Pacific Ocean. The ships made
landfall at Guam on March 6, 1521, and then went on to what became
the Philippine Islands.
   The Spanish sailors got into a fight with natives on Mactan
Island on April 27, 1521, and Magellan was killed. The anniversary
of his death fell on Thursday.
   Magellan's fleet continued its voyage, with Juan Sebastian
Elcano in command, but one ship after another was lost until only
the Victoria was left. The vessel returned to Spain on Sept. 8,
1522. Only 17 men, of an original crew of 270, survived the
three-year voyage.
   Though Magellan died before the trip ended, he is generally
credited with the first circumnavigation of the Earth.
   Stargazing sailors on the voyage are credited with discovery of
two star galaxies, called the Magellanic Clouds, which are visible
only from the southern hemisphere.

   Two weeks ago, Zarina Khatoon sold
her aluminum cooking pot to buy food for her four hungry children.
   ``The cooking pot was the last asset I could sell. My children
were going without food for two days. They had nothing but water,''
Zarina said, wearing a ragged sari and sitting on the ground in
front of her mud-and-straw house.
   Her plight is common among the families of 65 million landless
day laborers in this poverty-stricken nation of 110 million people.
When there are no fields to tend, there is no money to earn.
   Two months of drought have aggravated the situation. The rain
that brought a measure of relief on Wednesday may not be enough to
save the crops in the ground.
   In yet another of the deadly caprices nature so often unleashes
on Bangladesh, the rains were accompanied by tornadoes that killed
at least 600 people. It was the latest in a series of natural
calamities that have struck the nation.
   Floods last summer killed more than 1,400 people, submerged
four-fifths of the country and left 25 million people homeless.
Barely two months after the water receded, cyclones struck in late
November, claiming another 1,100 lives.
   The Jamalpur district, 90 miles north of Dhaka, was ravaged by
last summer's monsoon-spawned floods. Now it suffers from drought.
But so far the main problem is not availability of food, relief
workers say. It's the shortage of work.
   The sowing season is over. For landless day laborers, there will
be no more work until the rice crop now in the ground is harvested
in early June _ if the paddies survive the drought.
   Zarina Khatoon's husband, Mokbul Ahmad, left home two weeks ago
to look for work. He has not yet returned to Palashtala, 12 miles
south of Jamalpur.
   Shortly after he left, Zarina sold her cooking pot for 15 takas,
about 46 cents. She promptly spent 31 cents on 2.2 pounds of flour,
which saw her family through two meals.
   The 25-year-old woman said her situation had improved slightly
since she found work digging a pond for 15 takas a day.
   ``Still, I cannot buy rice for my family,'' she said. ``Rice is
out of my reach.''
   Two weeks ago, low-quality rice, the staple of the Bangladeshi
diet, sold for 28 cents a pound. The government pumped some reserve
stocks into the area, and the price fell a little _ to 25 cents a
pound.
   ``It's not the question of availability of rice. The problem is
the poor people have no money to buy food. They have no jobs,''
said Fakhrul Ahsan, a local worker for the privately run Bangladesh
Rural Development Committee.
   He said the committee is working with 56,000 people living in 47
villages in the Jamalpur region, doing post-flood rehabilitation
work and trying to provide jobs such as building roads and making
handicrafts.
   ``Almost 30 percent of the people we cover are living in extreme
conditions,'' Ahsan said. ``They take flour and boil it with water.
They can't make bread from wheat as that fails to feed all the
members of the family.
   ``This is a lean period for agriculture workers. There is no
work in the fields until the next harvest comes. The poor, landless
people eat on days they can work. On workless days they go without
food,'' he added.
   ``We have no report of anyone dying for lack of food, but the
situation is pretty bad,'' said Debabrata Das, another worker from
the Bangladesh Rural Development Committee.
   Abdul Hamid, who lives in Narayanpur near Palashtala, said he
earned 15 takas a day working for wealthy farmers.
   ``The money I earn cannot buy rice for me and my family,'' the
35-year-old father of three said. ``Rice has become a luxury item
for us.''
   Bangladesh, where the per capita annual income is $160, needs
18.5 million tons of rice and wheat a year to feed its people. In
good years, it produces 17 million tons. It tries to import an
additional 2 million tons to cover the shortfall and provide an
emergency reserve.
   Last year, the floods wiped out 2.5 million tons that were in
the fields and paddies when the deluge struck.
   The spring rice crop now in the ground was expected to produce
about 5.6 million tons, but agriculture officials in Dhaka fear at
least half will be lost to the drought.

   In his fight for political change in China,
student leader Wu'er Kaixi has lost his voice and 10 pounds, but
the 21-year-old from remote Xinjiang province shows no sign of
giving up.
   The freshman has been at the forefront of demonstrations for
democracy and a free press since April 20 when he singlehandedly
organized a sit-in near the gates of the Communist Party
headquarters.
   With no microphone, Wu'er shouted down about 1,000 unruly
students, making them sit quietly for several hours in protest.
Hundreds of security forces then massed and charged the protesters,
beating some and sending others fleeing.
   ``There's nothing I can do about it, I've always wanted to do
what other people were afraid of,'' said the cocky young man from
Beijing Normal University, cracking a dimpled smile.
   Last week, after he appointed himself president of Beijing
Normal's student association, the students approved his decision in
one of the first student elections in a country that has always
appointed its student representatives.
   He also is a member of the independent all-city student
association which has organized the protests. The communist
government has called the organizations illegal. Wu'er said they
represent the will of the students.
   ``I've been leading students since I started school,'' he said
in a recent interview in a cramped student dormitory room at his
school. ``In high school I didn't think twice about standing up on
the table and shouting if we needed more light bulbs or an official
hit a student,''
   But now instead of light bulbs, Wu'er is calling for democracy.
   ``People are beginning to discover that I'm a dangerous man,''
he said with obvious relish. ``That is a good thing.''
   Early in the protest, his school recognized that fact and had
his father sent thousands of miles from Xinjiang to Beijing to urge
him to stop his work.
   ``Putting pressure on my father was sick and disgusting,'' he
said. ``It won't work.''
   The demonstrations have taken their toll on his health.
   ``I haven't been eating much. When we spent the night at
Tiananmen Square on Friday I didn't eat at all. My throat hurts
from screaming but my spirit is good.''
   Wu'er hails from China's remote northwest. Both his parents are
of Turkish escent, belonging to the Uigur people, who dominated
Central Asia between the 8th and the 12th centuries.
   ``I look at my status as a minority in this country of Han
people as a bonus,'' he said. ``We have an expression in Chinese:
`The onlooker sees the game best.' I think I see the problems of
the Han better because my blood is different.''
   Wu'er said he is little impressed with political thinkers from
the West or China.
   ``I've always thought I had to go my own way,'' he said. ``Some
of my classmates worship America's system but I think it's like the
story about the king who asked his subjects to blow on their gold
horns if they supported democracy. None of them had gold horns.''
   However, his personality, he said, resembles that of an American.
   ``I'm not conservative and I'm ready to say what's on my mind,''
he said. ``The rest of my countrymen trouble me. So many won't dare
to raise their heads.''
   This tendency, he said, has hurt China.
   Wu'er said his country is like an ``ancient boat, a junk, with
holes in its sails and maybe a leak or two.''
   ``The boat might founder, it might even sink. But the student
movement _ we're just like the guys with the straps on their
shoulders pulling the boat up the river. We've used a lot of
strength, a lot of sweat, even blood, but the boat hasn't moved
much. But we've got to pull anyway.''
   Wu'er said he doesn't expect the movement to win concrete
results.
   ``But we're part of a process in China. The weight of 1.1
billion people is a heavy one and you can't budge it in a day.''
   On Thursday, Wu'er led his university as it marched 20 miles
through the streets of Beijing with 150,000 students and other
supporters in the biggest march in Commuunist China's history.
   ``Finally, we are victorious,'' he said as he trudged home from
a long day of stand-offs with police. ``Finally.''
   He admits to being afraid for the future.
   ``Maybe this idea is a little strange, but if they arrest me I
don't want to be sent to jail for a traffic violation during a
protest. If I'm going to jail I want to be a political prisoner.''

<HEAD>Poland To Suspend Plans To Build Second Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland will suspend plans to build its
second nuclear power plant because of the ``doubts and fears
expressed by society,'' state radio said.
   According to the report, Industry Minister Mieczyslaw Wilczek
met with provincial governors from western Poland whose provinces
are near the Klempicz plant and told them he favored a
``comprehensive review of the development program of the nuclear
power industry in Poland.''
   Wilczek told the governors of the Pila, Poznan and Gorzow
Wielkopolska provinces that ``decisions about the fate of the
project will be made on the basis of a comprehensive and thorough
analysis of the fuel-energy situation up to the year 2000,'' the
report said.
   The state news agency PAP early today said it had no word about
such a decision.
   The plans to construct the nuclear plant in the Pila province
town of Klempicz has aroused protests in western Poland. The plant,
to be finished by the year 2000, would be about 30 miles north of
Poznan, a city of 585,000 people 110 miles from the East German
border.
   Marches protesting the plant have become frequent events since
the plans to build were announced in 1987. Kemplicz would be the
second Polish nuclear plant after one in Zarnowiec, on the Baltic
coast, where construction has begun. That plant is scheduled to
begin producing power in 1991.
   The plants are based on Soviet designs. Concerns about possible
nuclear accidents have become much more acute among Poles since the
1986 accident at Chernobyl in the Soviet Ukraine, which borders
Poland.

   In the tradition of Willie Nelson's Farm
Aid concerts, a Georgia businessman is lining up country western
entertainers to make a music video and record to benefit
financially pressed farmers.
   Chad Kramer of Atlanta said Friday he had been in touch with
Nelson's office because ``I felt a strong desire to keep things
going.''
   The project also is reminiscent of the ``We Are the World''
video and record in 1985, which raised money for African hunger
relief.
   Kramer said he has commitments from 20 recording artists who
plan to gather in Nashville June 6 to do a video of the song ``Lean
On Me,'' a 1972 hit by pop singer Bill Withers.
   Kramer said the participants include Tom Wopat, Tom T. Hall,
Eddy Raven, Jerry Jeff Walker, Johnny Rodriguez, Michael Johnson,
Skip Ewing, Larry Boone, Cristy Lane, Judy Rodman and Terri Gibbs.
Withers also will participate, Kramer said.
   Kramer projected proceeds at up to $4 million.

   Protests from anti-abortion activists and
the Roman Catholic Church forced the organizers of a medical
conference co-sponsored by a Catholic hospital to cancel an
appearance by Dr. Ruth Westheimer.
   The diminutive human sexuality expert was to discuss ``Sexuality
and the Medical Profession'' next week, but the address was
canceled after Saint Anthony Medical Center, a co-sponsor of the
event, received mail and phone calls protesting her appearance.
   The outspoken Westheimer, known as Dr. Ruth, is an author,
counselor, TV and radio talk show host, and a staunch advocate of
sex education.
   ``I think that she perhaps offended the sensibilities of members
of the Catholic Church with her stands on certain sexual topics,''
said Dr. Paul Maxwell, director of Continuing Medical Education at
Saint Anthony and head of a committee that chose speakers for the
conference. ``The problem seemed to be her public stance on
abortion, the use of condoms and other sensitive issues.''
   A spokesman for Westheimer said Friday that she believes people
who do not wish to hear her views should turn the dial.

   Jane Goodall, who comes out of Africa each year
to lecture and raise money for conservation research, says she is
concerned for the chimpanzees she has observed in Tanzania for 29
years.
   ``I feel a sense of growing urgency,'' Goodall said in an
address sponsored by the San Diego Zoological Society Thursday.
``The plight of the chimps in Africa is truly horrendous.''
   At the turn of the century, chimpanzees could be found in 25
African countries and numbered in the millions, she said. Today,
they are extinct in four of those countries and on the brink of
extinction in five others, said Goodall, 55.
   She said if chimpanzees are to survive in the wild there must be
fundamental changes, including an all-out effort to discourage
private ownership as pets as well as encouraging medical science to
seek alternative methods of research.

   Convicted murderer Jean Harris must turn over
$90,000 in profits from her autobiography to a board that dispenses
cash to crime victims.
   The state Crime Victims Board argued successfully that under
state law, profits from the book, ``Stranger in Two Worlds,''
should benefit survivors of Dr. Herman Tarnower, the man Mrs.
Harris killed.
   Mrs. Harris sought to donate the money to a fund for the
children of inmates at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility,
where she is serving a 15-year-to-life sentence for the March 1979
murder of the creator of the Scarsdale diet.
   The prison charity argued in a lawsuit that garnishing the money
would violate Mrs. Harris's constitutional rights. But state court
Justice Israel Rubin disagreed, ruling Thursday in the board's
favor.
   The money will be placed in escrow for up to five years. Under
the law, survivors of Tarnower must obtain a civil judgment in
order to obtain the money. If none comes forward, it will be
returned to Mrs. Harris.
   Mrs. Harris, 65, has written another book about her prison
experiences, ``They Always Call Us Ladies,'' which is not covered
by the state law because it does not discuss the murder of
Tarnower, her longtime lover.

   In one race, Cassini's horse broke stride for a while and
another won easily. The second horse he jockeyed rallied from

   ``He could not catch up to the leaders, but I was very happy to

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old student can't take a
35-year-old married woman to his high school prom tonight, a judge
ruled.
   Judge Lynne Brady said Friday that Alburnett High School has the
right to set codes of conduct for its functions unless the rules
are ``so unreasonable and arbitrary that they're illegal.''
   Jayme Wessels had argued that he should be able to take anyone
to the prom, including Delores Washburn, a mother of four he
described as a family friend.
   ``They said the community wouldn't like it,'' Wessels said
following the school board's decision last week. ``I said the
community isn't going to the prom. The juniors pay for it. It's
their night.''
   Mrs. Washburn said she was disappointed in the ruling and that
the school board shouldn't have the right to ``pick and choose''
who should date whom. ``I would think it would be the family's
discretion. Who knows the children better than the family?''
   Alburnett Principal Raymond Cull said Mrs. Washburn could have
come as a chaperone but not as a date.
   ``Age has nothing to do with it,'' he said. ``Our thing was we
don't feel it is appropriate for a 17-year-old to date a married
person.''
   Wessels could not be reached following the decision. There was
no answer at his home telephone.
   He has said he and Mrs. Washburn have been friends about two
years and that he often joins her family, including four children
and husband of 19 years, Don, on social outings.
   ``She treats me as a friend and I treat her as a mother,'' he
explained. Wessels' parents are divorced. He lives with his father,
and his mother lives in San Diego.

   A woman who stopped for a late-night car
wash got trapped in the building overnight and suffered carbon
monoxide poisoning because the engine was running the whole time.
   Jamie Denise Stewart, 23, was unconscious when an attendant
opened the car wash at a gas station Friday, police said. She
apparently had tried to ram the door with her automobile, they said.
   Ms. Stewart was in guarded condition Friday night at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center, hospital officials said.
   Tests found Ms. Stewart had drugs and alcohol in her system,
police said.
   ``At some point she may have become unconscious before the doors
closed,'' Lt. Tommy Jacobs said.
   Ms. Stewart went to the station for cigarettes and a car wash
between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. Friday, police said.
   An attendant later closed the automatic car wash doors by remote
control, believing the woman had already left.
   Police said Ms. Stewart was trapped in the building for three to
four hours.

a student who can smell a winner has come up with a scent that
could have all America turning its nose up at Peoria.
   ``Essence of Peoria'' is being promoted as the Midwest's
``finest industrial fragrance,'' a potion that reeks of the ethanol
plants that permeate this city.
   ``It's the smell of very old beer _ kind of an egg sulfur smell.
When the wind is just right, it's the smell you get all over
Peoria,'' said David Cook, the Bradley University student who
developed the formula with the help of chemists.
   Cook packaged 1,000 bottles of his fragrance and got several
area hotels and novelty stores to sell it as a gag, but the
response has been far from comical.
   ``It's a gag that's going crazy,'' Cook said. ``I've already
sold out half my stock, about 300 bottles, in just one week on the
market. ... I broke even on my investment three days ago. I'll
definitely be producing more.''
   ``I don't know if people in Peoria will buy it because all they
have to do is open their windows. But it's going to do real well
with visitors,'' said D.J. Shadid, owner of gift shops in three
hotels.
   But city officials who hired a public relations firm in 1987 to
polish the city's image would like to get rid of the stink over
``Essence.''
   ``I admit it's a clever idea but it disappoints me because I
don't want to see someone making fun of our city,'' Mayor Jim
Maloof said. ``We've tried so hard the last few years to change our
image. Hopefully this product, and the smell, will fade away.''

   The decision by Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins to wait until 1990 to resume production of a gas needed for
nuclear warheads shows clearly that supplies of the gas are not as
tight as the government once claimed, critics say.
   The Pentagon asserted last fall that unless production resumed
by this summer the nuclear weapons factories would face a shortage
of tritium, a scarce, highly radioactive gas used to boost the
explosive power of nuclear warheads.
   But critics have said they believe the earlier warnings about a
tritium crisis were aimed at galvanizing congressional support for
the Energy Department's proposal to spend $6.8 billion to build two
new tritium-producing reactors.
   ``That whole scenario was orchestrated for political purposes by
certain people in the Pentagon,'' Chris Paine, an aide to Sen.
Edward Kennedy on nuclear defense issues, said in an interview
Friday. ``It's not as serious as they suggested.''
   Watkins told Congress and the Pentagon this week that he had
decided the department's tritium-producing reactors in South
Carolina would not be restarted until early next year, at the
earliest.
   Watkins said he wanted more time to assess safety conditions at
the Savannah River Site, where the three reactors have been sitting
idle since last spring. They were shut down for mechanical repairs
and to address safety problems.
   The reactors are the nation's only source of tritium, which
decays relatively quickly, so replacement supplies are needed to
maintain the nuclear arsenal. One hundred grams of tritium becomes
50 grams after 12 years _ a far faster rate of decay than
plutonium, another vital material used to make nuclear weapons.
   The tritium hiatus has had no immediate affect on weapons
production, since the arms factories can dip into a tritium
reserve. The size of that reserve is classified, and the government
has not said exactly how long the surplus will last.
   Several times earlier this year, the Energy Department's chief
of defense programs, Troy Wade, testified at congressional hearings
that the problem had become ``critical.''
   ``If a reactor is not restarted this year, then the supply of
tritium could be reduced to such an extent that the nuclear
stockpile may be affected,'' Wade told a Senate Armed Services
subcommittee in early February.
   Private analysts who monitor the government's weapons program
have been saying for months that the Energy Department and the
Pentagon have overstated the supply problem.
   Dan Reicher, an attorney for Natural Resources Defense Council,
an environmental group that has sued the Energy Department to block
restart of the Savannah River reactors, said Friday that Watkins'
decision undercuts the idea of a looming crisis.
   ``The longer we go without production the more we see there is
no tritium crisis,'' he said in an interview. ``Again the Pentagon
and DOE have cried wolf.''
   Last week, 11 prominent U.S. scientists issued a joint statement
urging the Energy Department to hold off on restart of the Savannah
River reactors until the Soviet Union has been sounded about
possible negotiated cuts in nuclear materials.
   ``It is our considered view that there is no critical shortage
of tritium today and that claims of an imminent `crisis' distort
the true situation,'' the scientists said.
   They said enough tritium exists today to sustain a fully
adequate weapons stockpile for at least five years without new
production if better management techniques were used. Among these
would be the use of tritium from weapons scheduled for retirement
or held in storage.
   Watkins said in a letter to congressional committees last week
that he had ordered changes in the department's management of
tritium inventories, but he gave no details.

   Miss France has been disqualified from
participating in next month's Miss Universe contest because she is
too young, the Excelsior news service reported.
   Excelsior quoted Martin Kip, vice-president of the U.S.-based
organization Miss Universe Inc., as saying Peggy Zlotkowski would
have had to have been 17 years old in February to participate in
the contest.
   She turned 17 on March 30, the news service said late Friday.
   Excelsior said Ms. Zlotkowski was ``humiliated'' by the ruling
that she was too young to participate in the contest, which will be
aired by CBS-TV to an estimated 900 million viewers on May 23.
   She reportedly said she had not been informed of the age
requirement and didn't learn of her disqualification until after
she traveled from Paris to this Caribbean resort in southeastern
Mexico.
   Excelsior said another woman would be named to represent France.
   Seventy-seven women from around the world are to participate in
the contest.

<HEAD>Prices Received Higher than Last Year, But Net Income to Fall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are getting more for their grain,
livestock and other commodities than they did last year, but their
net income is expected to drop from last year's record, according
to the Agricuture Department.
   Prices measured by a USDA index dropped 2 percent from March to
April but were still 12 percent higher than a year ago, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Friday in its
preliminary report.
   Lower prices for cattle, eggs, hogs, soybeans and lettuce were
mostly responsible for the decrease from the March average, while
higher prices for tomatoes, oranges and potatoes offset part of the
decline for the other commodities.
   New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet
expenses were up 1.1 percent from January and averaged 5.4 percent
more than in April 1988.
   ``Higher prices for fuels, fertilizers, seeds, autos and trucks,
tractors and other machinery contibuted most to the increase in the
index since January,'' the report said. ``Lower prices for feed,
and feeder cattle and calves were partially offsetting.''
   And department economists say net cash income of farmers is
expected to fall 12 percent to 16 percent this year to a range of
$48 billion to $52 billion from the record 1988 level of $58
billion.
   Net cash income is the amount farmers have at their disposal
during the year and represents the difference between gross cash
income and cash expenses. Cash income rose last year despite the
drought partly because of higher market prices and crops farmers
had stored from previous harvests.
   The decline this year is expected to stem from farmers' larger
cash expenses as they boost plantings, and also because of lower
federal subsidies.
   Consumer food prices are still forecast by USDA to rise an
average of 3 percent to 5 percent this year, following a 4.1
percent increase in 1988. However, department economists say it is
likely that the 1989 forecast will be revised upward, depending on
how current conditions shape up.
   In another report, the department said the Soviet Union has
bought an additional 1.05 million metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement.
   Officials said the latest corn sales by unidentified private
exporters pushed the total grain bought by the Soviets this year to
almost 18.3 million tons, close to the record 18.6 million tons
Moscow purchased from the United States in 1984-85. Corn makes up
about 14.3 million tons and wheat 4 million.
   The corn is scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the
sixth year of a long-term grain supply agreement between the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1.05 million tons
of corn would be about 41 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.53 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of more than $100
million.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three groups opposed to the government's plan
to build a new plutonium-production factory in Idaho are suing to
block initial work on the $1.2 billion facility.
   A suit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington said the
Energy Department should not be allowed to go ahead with
preparatory work planned for later this year until a fuller
assessment is made of the plant's environmental impact.
   The object of the suit is the Special Isotope Separation plant,
which the Energy Department plans to build on federal land near
Idaho Falls. The facility would use a new technique to produce
weapon-grade plutonium for nuclear weapons.
   The parties to the suit _ the Natural Resources Defense Council,
the Snake River Alliance and the Palouse-Clearwater Hanford Watch _
contend the department also should be required to give further
study to alternatives to building the plant.
   ``DOE simply has not lived up to its obligation to look before
it leaps into a potentially unnecessary and dangerous plant,'' said
Dan W. Reicher, an attorney for Natural Resources.
   A department spokesman, Will Callicott, said there would be no
official comment on the suit.
   The plant, to be built at the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory by 1995, would use laser technologies to make
weapon-grade plutonium out of reactor-grade plutonium that is
recovered from commercial nuclear power plants, the suit alleges.
   The technology is under development at the government's Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in California.
   Some private analysts of the government's nuclear weapons
program contend there is no demonstrated need for the Idaho
facility because there already is more than enough plutonium to
last for the foreseeable future. The size of the nation's plutonium
inventories is classified.
   ``In light of the plutonium surplus, SIS appears to be a $3
billion pork-barrel project,'' Paul Leventhal, president of the
Nuclear Control Institute, said in a letter to congressional
leaders last month. He was referring to the estimated $1.2 billion
construction cost and $1.9 billion operating cost.
   The Energy Department, in a report earlier this year on plans
for modernizing its nuclear weapons complex, labeled the Idaho
project ``time-critical and essential'' and ranked it among its top
defense program priorities.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, who is reassessing the Reagan
administration's long-range plans for the weapons program, has told
Congress he strongly supports building the Idaho plant.
   ``The Special Isotope Separation facility in Idaho should be
constructed to provide flexibility and technological diversity to a
production complex burdened by reactor operating constraints,'' he
told a House panel earlier this month.

<HEAD>US Reportedly Plans Trade Sanctions Against Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has decided to
retaliate against Japan on grounds it has violated an agreement to
allow U.S.-made cellular phones and mobile radios to compete in its
telecommunications market, it was reported today.
   The Washington Post and The New York Times reported the decision
was made Friday by President Bush's Economic Policy Council. The
decision could result in imposing penalty tariffs on similar
Japanese products under the new trade law passed by Congress last
year, the papers said.
   The decision came as U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
charged that 34 countries are erecting unfair barriers to U.S.
products, in a move that could eventually lead to 100 percent
tariffs against some imports.
   The trade representative office's general counsel, Joshua
Bolten, and spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, could not be reached at
home Friday night to confirm the reports on sanctions against
Japan. Such sanctions would be the first ordered since 1987, when
the Reagan administration accused Japan of failing to keep an
agreement to buy more U.S. semiconductors.
   The Times quoted Hills as saying that public hearings will be
held sometime in May to determine what Japanese products and
services might be subject to retaliation.
   Hills' report on the trade barriers took 18 pages to list the
complaints against Japan, the most for any country. The 12-nation
European Community and South Korea were next, each with nine pages
of complaints.
   The accusations of trade barriers covered a wide range of
products from shipments of autos to Argentina to the sales of
American cigarettes in Yugoslavia.
   In addition to the 34 nations, two trading organizations are
named. Those are the EC and the Gulf Cooperation Council, which
includes Saudi Arabia.
   The report is the first step in drawing up a ``hit list'' of
priority countries the administration will target for intensive
negotiations aimed at getting the trade barriers eliminated. That
priority list, drawn from the countries mentioned Friday, is due on
May 30.
   The United States must initiate negotiations with the countries
on the priority list with a deadline of achieving results within 18
months. The countries then would have three years to live up to the
agreements and remove the trade barriers America finds offensive.
   Should the negotiations prove unfruitful or a country fail to
implement the agreement, the trade law gives the administration the
power to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on selected imports.
   The procedure set up by the Omnibus Trade Act was the most
controversial section of the 1988 law, which Congress passed in an
effort to force the executive branch to take a tougher stance to
whittle down the country's huge trade deficits.
   Many economists said at the time the legislation was debated
that the effort could backfire and set off a global trade war in
which U.S. attempts to punish unfair trade practices are met by
counter-retaliation against American goods.
   Foreign governments, concerned by the tight deadlines for
negotiations to be completed, have already begun intensive lobbying
efforts to keep from being placed on the priority list.
   While the law provides various loopholes a president could use
to avoid imposing retaliatory tariffs, a failure to act would have
to be explained to Congress.
   American companies have filed petitions with Hills' office
recommending that close to 50 countries be placed on the priority
negotiating list. South Korea has the most complaints filed against
it by U.S. businesses followed by Japan, India, Taiwan, Brazil and
the European Community.
   Officials from those nations have mounted their own
counterattack, dispatching their top trade officials to Washington
for meetings with top administration officials to press their case
that their countries should not be singled out.
   The debate has been particularly intense with regard to Japan.
Some in the administration have expressed concerns about applying
further trade pressure on Japan at a time the country is facing
internal turmoil with the announced resignation of Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   But Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the trade subcommittee
of the Senate Finance Committee, said last week the administration
would be ``cutting the heart out of'' the new trade law if it
didn't target Japan.
   In Friday's report, the countries named were Argentina,
Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, West
Germany, Finland, France, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan,
South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway,
Pakistan, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.

   West German officials say NATO nations
are starting to line up against the U.S. and British views in a
major disarmament dispute within the Western alliance.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's call for superpower negotiations on
short-range nuclear weapons has placed him in a battle of wills
against both President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Kohl are scheduled to meet Sunday in West
Germany to discuss the issue.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher spent part of Friday
talking about the dispute, one of the most divisive in recent years
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with U.S. Ambassador
Vernon A. Walters.
   A Foreign Ministry statement said ``both sides expressed their
belief that the alliance will jointly resolve the still-open
question of a formulation of a comprehensive (disarmament)
concept.''
   But there were no indications that would happen soon.
   Genscher's spokesman said seven of the 16 NATO members,
including West Germany, support Kohl.
   West Germany wants the United States to agree to talks with the
Soviet Union on the short-range weapons and notes that NATO decided
in favor of such negotiations in 1987.
   Most of NATO's short-range nuclear weapons are based in West
Germany and would be used exclusively on German soil in the event
of war.
   Washington rejects the West German insistence on negotiations,
saying talks on tactical nuclear arsenals should not begin as long
as the Warsaw Pact alliance has a superiority in conventional
forces.
   West German polls show that the electorate favors such talks.
The military reductions announced by Mikhail S. Gorbachev has made
the Soviet leader a popular figure in Western Europe.
   The dispute has led to lobbying efforts by both sides among the
NATO members.
   Genscher told Parliament on Friday, ``We can see that we are
finding more and more understanding for this position (for
negotiations) within the whole alliance.''
   Juergen Chrobog, Genscher's chief spokesman, told reporters six
other NATO countries are backing West Germany.
   Denmark, Belgium, Norway and Italy have announced their support
of Kohl and Chrobog said Greece and Spain also back him.
   France has not given a clear signal where it stands, but French
President Francois Mitterrand said last week: ``Nothing should be
done that will compromise the movement toward disarmament.''
   The Netherlands has offered to mediate between the feuding NATO
members, and Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers plans to travel to Bonn on
Wednesday.
   Kohl is slated to travel to Rome on Tuesday for discussions with
Italy's leaders on the dispute, and Genscher will have talks in
Paris the same day with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   One West German official, speaking with the condition he not be
identified, said the government would stand firm.
   ``In past years the German point of view wasn't always put that
strongly in alliance matters, but right now German interests are at
stake,'' he said.
   With a growing mood for increased demilitarization, NATO is
hoping to present a showing of solidarity at its Brussels summit on
May 29-30.
   West Germany's pressure for negotiations on short-range nuclear
weapons comes as Kohl tries to improve his image. There have been
predictions he could lose next year's elections to the left-leaning
Social Democrats.

<TEXT>
   Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R.
Ford have been invited by authorities in Panama to monitor upcoming
national elections in that country, a Panamanian official said.
   Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said at a news
conference Friday evening that he informed a Carter emissary on
Wednesday the two former presidents would be welcome for the May 7
balloting.
   Ritter said Carter is held in high esteem by Panamanians because
of his role in negotiating the canal treaties that will revert the
waterway to Panamanian control at the end of the century.
   ``We are prepared to give him the warmest welcome,'' Ritter said.
   Spokesmen for Carter and Ford were unavailable for comment
Friday night.
   Ritter said Panamanian authorities are not eager to have foreign
observers in ``overwhelming numbers.'' He said the reason is that
the country lacks facilities to accommodate them and their presence
could impair the electoral process.
   The Bush administration has said that the Panamanian government,
led by the Defense Forces commander Manuel Antonio Noriega, is
preparing fraud on a massive scale to ensure victory in the
elections.
   The principal contest in the balloting matches the official
candidate, Carlos Duque, against Guillermo David Endara, who is
running on an anti-goverment coalition ticket.
   The election controversy was taken up Friday morning at a U.N.
Security Council session called at Panama's request.
   Ritter told the session the United States has supplied millions
of dollars to opposition candidates and has sent commandos, special
weapons and helicopters to Panama as well.
   He accused the United States of trying to subvert democratic
elections, set up a puppet, pro-Washington government and undermine
the canal treaties.
   ``U.S. plans of interfering in the Panamanian electoral process
have entered a phase of direct participation,'' Ritter told the
15-member council.
   ``The objective is undermining public order, causing chaos,
promoting widespread destabilization in the country around election
time and creating a pretext for military intervention in Panama.''
   In reply, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering accused Panama's
government of blatantly interfering in the election process;
manipulating voters' lists; muzzling the opposition, press and TV;
and restricting access by impartial foreign monitors and
journalists.
   ``The moral bankruptcy of the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega for
which Mr. Ritter speaks is well known,'' Pickering said.
   The United States does not recognize the Noriega-led government,
insisting that former President Eric Arturo Delvalle was ousted
illegally in February 1988 and continues to be the country's
legitimate authority.

   President Bush says he wants to go ahead with
a controversial deal with Japan for joint development and
production of the new FSX jetfighter, despite congressional concern
over loss of American jobs and technology.
   Bush, announcing on Friday the agreement to make an advanced
version of the U.S. F-16 for deployment by Japan in the late 1990s,
declared that the deal was ``in the strategic and commercial
interests of the United States.''
   ``And we weighed this matter from the standpoint of trade, of
our industrial growth and technology transfer, as well as strategic
and foreign policy considerations,'' the president said.
   The announcement was made the same day the Office of Trade
Representative released a report listing Japan as one of the worst
users of trade barriers and, according to published reports,
recommended sanctions for refusing to open its markets to U.S.-made
cellular phones and mobile radios.
   Congressional critics were quick to respond to Bush's
announcement.
   ``President Bush claims that this giveaway will not cost the
American people a cent,'' said Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo.,
chairman of the FSX Task Force and a House leader on trade issues.
``What's he going to tell the thousands of aerospace workers who
will lose their jobs as a result of this deal?''
   Gephardt's St. Louis district is the home of General Dynamics,
the American partner with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in
developing the aircraft.
   Bush told reporters at the White House the United States ``will
have a 40 percent work share in the initial development stage of
this aircraft, and we will have a similar share when the aircraft
goes into production.''
   Development of the FSX is expected to cost about $1.2 billion,
while the production run is estimated to cost about $5 billion for
130 planes.
   ``There will be no cost to the American taxpayer and at the same
time the Japanese will improve their ability to carry their share
of the defense burden,'' Bush said.
   Addressing concerns over U.S. technology, Bush said: ``Sensitive
source codes for the aircraft's computer will be strictly
controlled. Access will be granted to only those codes that are
essential to complete the project.''
   Three administration officials who briefed reporters said that
for instance, the codes for the new F-16 digital flight control
computer, which just came out last year, will not be released to
the Japanese.
   Any new technology developed by the Japanese during the FSX
program will be available to U.S. firms, but Japan will be banned
from transferring to third countries or firms any technology
derived from the U.S.-built F-16 plane, the officials said.
   Congress has 30 days to review the agreement, signed Friday by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Japan's Ambassador Nobuo
Matsunaga.
   The House and Senate can reject it by a joint resolution of
disapproval. But if such a resolution is passed, a two-thirds
majority of both houses would be required to override a likely Bush
veto.
   Initial Capitol Hill reaction to the announcement was dominated
by critics of the FSX.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said he will mount a campaign to
scrap the plan because Japan could best help reduce the trade
deficit with the United States by purchasing U.S.-built F-16s ``off
the shelf.''
   Also speaking out against the decision was Rep. James J. Florio,
D-N.J., who said that ``we are giving our strongest competitor in
the world marketplace the expertise it lacks to directly challenge
America's leadership in international civil and military aircraft
sales.''
   Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said he favors going ahead with the
deal.
   ``I'm encouraged by the agreement between the United States and
the Japanese, particularly on the work share, the (computer) source
codes and technology flowback,'' he said. ``And I hope that this
will ease congressional concerns about the FSX.''

Inspection Service, said Friday. The skinned breast and drumstick
parts were shipped Wednesday from a ConAgra Inc. plant in
Gainesville, Ga., but company officials did not know their
destination.
   But a national union official insisted Friday on a recall.
``Once these small slivers of glass get in birds, there's no way to
tell it until you eat it or prick your finger with it,'' said
Delmer Jones, president of the National Council of Food Inspection
Locals of the American Federation of Government Employees.
   According to Ms. Stuck, a government inspector at the plant
originally had ordered the chickens in the vat condemned. The
company then appealed, proposing a salvage plan that was approved
by the same inspector and his two immediate supervisors, she said.
   Ms. Stuck said officials in Washington have reviewed all the
actions in the case and are satisfied with the approval of the
salvage plan, which involved skinning the chickens and discarding
the abdominal fats and back pieces.
   Walt Casey, a spokesman for ConAgra, said the company ``has a
very high comfort level that our product is safe.'' He accused
Jones of ``blowing smoke'' because of union problems with local
USDA officials.
   When the fluorescent light shattered into the vat, Casey said,
``We stopped the line and removed all the chickens that were
involved.
   ``We went through the skinning and deboning procedure, which is
not unusual in this type of circumstance, and we had the approval
and involvement of the USDA inspector there, and also approval from
his supervisor.''
   Casey said he did not know where the chicken parts involved in
the accident were shipped but added that he would not disclose the
destination if he did know.
   ``I'm not sure that's relevant,'' he said.

<HEAD>First Black Cadet To Graduate From West Point Finally Recognized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THOMASVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first black to graduate from West
Point was honored by Georgia more than a century after his historic
achievement.
   A marker at the grave of Henry Flipper was unveiled Thursday by
Attorney General Michael Bowers, who called Flipper a hero and said
it was time ``we righted this great wrong.''
   For the descendants of Flipper, it wasn't the first time they
have waited for recognition.
   Flipper graduated from the academy 112 years ago. He was
court-martialed 108 years ago, but the Army overturned the
conviction 12 years ago and named part of the West Point library
after Flipper.
   Gwinnett County teacher Ray MacColl battled for 18 years to win
the recognition, and Flipper's niece, Irsle King of Valdosta, tried
to help her uncle gain a hearing during the last years of his life.
   Ms. King said she was pleased by the ceremony but wished the
honors had come while he was alive.
   Flipper was born into slavery in Thomasville. He moved with his
family and its owners to Atlanta, and after the Civil War attended
Atlanta University before winning nomination to West Point.
   Flipper was graduated from the academy in 1877, commanded an
all-black cavalry regiment in Oklahoma and then was put in charge
of the Fort Sill commissary. In 1881, he was charged with
embezzling $3,791 and with conduct unbecoming an officer.
   At a court-martial MacColl said was plagued with ``racism and
irregularities,'' Flipper was acquitted of theft but convicted of
unbecoming conduct.
   After Flipper was exonerated in 1977, West Point dedicated a
bust of him at the academy and named a portion of the library in
his honor. The academy also established an annual award in his name
for the cadet who has survived the greatest hardship.
   In 1978, Flipper's body was removed from an unmarked grave in
Atlanta, where he died in 1940 at the age of 84, and was reburied
near his parents' graves in Thomasville with full military honors.

   An aspiring magician wants to use some of
his claim in a record $115 million lottery to fix up Harry
Houdini's grave, while his father's celebration began when he ``lit
a cigarette with a dollar bill.''
   Eight of the 14 winners in Wednesday's Pennsylvania Super 7
lottery had put in claims by Friday. Officials said two other
claimants had contacted them, and four winning tickets still were
unaccounted for.
   For the lucky ones, it was a time to dream.
   Paul Rosen, 23, his brother Jay, 25; sister Deborah, 20; and
their father Arthur and mother Judy said they held one of the
winning tickets. They planned to split their $8.3 million portion,
which will be paid in installments over 26 years.
   Paul Rosen, a former magician who is now a restaurant manager in
Lawrenceville, N.J., said he now will have time to perfect his
magic tricks. He said he also wants to spend some of his claim on
the New York City grave of Houdini, the magician-escape artist who
died in 1926.
   ``I've had a dream for a long time to refurbish his grave and
fix it up,'' he said.
   The East Windsor, N.J., family celebrated at a motel with
champagne and hamburgers. Arthur Rosen, 50, even lit a cigarette
with a dollar bill.
   Mary Jane Hicks, 74, of Lebanon, Pa., said she talked to her dog
when she learned she held a winning ticket. ``He smiled,'' she said.
   Pressed by reporters on how she would spend the money, she said,
``I love Rehoboth Beach (Del.).'' When a reporter suggested a beach
house, she said: ``It's a really good idea.''
   Rose White, 41, of Wesleyville, near Erie, Pa., had to be
convinced by her husband, John, that their lives were about to
change.
   Mrs. White was at her $6-an-hour, second-shift job at a plastics
plant when White called.
   ``Walk out, quit. You're done,'' he urged. But she finished her
shift. By the time she got home, her husband had given away her
1979 Ford.
   ``Who'd you give it to?'' she asked at the lottery news
conference. ``Some guy at work,'' he replied.
   Mrs. White then said she wanted a new car. White said he wanted
a new car, too _ and a house and a boat.
   If their ticket is validated, the Whites will split their
winnings with Charles Davis, 34, of McKean Township. Davis said he
would buy a boat.
   Lottery Executive Director Jim Scroggins said the individual
ticket validation will take until next week and the first checks
will be presented then.
   The 14 jackpot tickets, each with seven winning numbers, are
each worth $317,524.67 a year before taxes. Tickets with six
winning numbers pay $4,842.50 and five winning numbers, $274.50.
Tickets with four winning numbers pay $7.
   At $115 million, the Pennsylvania jackpot eclipsed the previous
U.S. record jackpot, $69.9 million, for which four winning tickets
were held April 15 in Illinois. The world's largest lottery
jackpot, $159 million, was split by hundreds of people in December
in Spain.
   The other potential jackpot winners who filed claims Friday were:
   _James and Jalinda Whittle Jr. of New Brighton, Beaver County.
``It will give us more to play with,'' said James Whittle, a
59-year-old chiropractor.
   _Sylvia Trapuzzano, 35, of Washington, Pa. Trapuzzano stayed in
a Harrisburg area motel Thursday to think things over; she said
Friday she was still thinking how she would spend the money.
   _James Evans, 40; John Gardner, 38; and Lionel Herndon, 40; and
his wife Connie, 39, all of Morgantown, W.Va. Herndon said he had
learned a lesson: ``Gambling pays off.''
   _A group of 14 brick factory workers from Windham, Ohio, and
three members of a family from Cambria County, Pa., and Fort
Montgomery, N.Y., placed claims Thursday.

<HEAD>Jackson Says ``No'' to Reports He Wants Mayor's Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sources close to Jesse Jackson say he is
``strongly considering'' foregoing a third race for the presidency
in 1992 to run for mayor of the District of Columbia.
   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday that
Jackson would consider the 1990 mayoral bid if embattled Mayor
Marion S. Barry Jr. decides against seeking a fourth term.
   Jackson denied Friday night that he is seeking to replace Barry,
a longtime ally, although he said in interviews published in two
newspapers today that has not ruled out running for the office if
Barry steps aside.
   ``I have not yet made a determination to run here,'' Jackson
told The Washington Post.
   Asked by a reporter at a hotel banquet here Friday night if he
was considering a race for mayor, Jackson said ``No.'' He also said
he has not talked to Barry about whether the mayor, who has been
dogged by reports about the city's skyrocketing murder rate and
friendship with a former city official convicted of cocaine
trafficking, will run.
   ``I've always supported the mayor,'' said Jackson, who last year
lost the Democratic presidential nomination to Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
   The two men, however, have talked about Jackson running for the
job if Barry does not seek a fourth four-year term, the source
close to Jackson, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that Jackson
said he would ``never run against Marion Barry.''
   But Jackson said, ``If he were not running, that's a different
story.''
   Jackson lives in Chicago, but The Washington Post report said is
speeding up plans to remodel a house he owns in Washington and
could move in by November. ``My family has not made that decision,
but we can't move before the house is finished,'' Jackson told the
Post.
   Jackson has repeatedly said that ``under no condition'' would he
run against Barry. The two men have been close friends and
political allies since their civil rights activities together in
the early 1960s.
   Barry, who has not said whether he will seek re-election, could
not be reached Friday night. The mayor's spokesman also was
unreachable.
   An effort to organize a mayoral campaign on behalf of Jackson
was launched two months ago by a member of the city school board
and a leader of the district's Statehood Party.
   Ann Lewis, a Democratic political strategist and an adviser to
Jackson in his presidential campaign, said Friday that comments
Jackson has made to political confidants indicate ``he does not
immediately reject'' running for mayor.
   ``I know he's been under a lot of pressure about this,'' Ms.
Lewis said. ``It's clear that they have reached him,'' she said,
referring to the draft-Jackson effort organized by school board
member R. Calvin Lockridge and Statehood Party leader Tom Chorlton.
   The two men had hoped to gather signatures from 100,000 of the
city's 300,000 registered voters on a petition supporting Jackson
for mayor, but Chorlton said the effort has been slowed by a lack
of volunteers.
   Jackson, who has never held elective office, could qualify for
the 1990 mayor's race by switching his voter registration from
Chicago to the district by November of this year.

   Three suspects in the gang rape and beating of a
Central Park jogger were denied bail Friday during a raucous
hearing at which an angry judge almost ejected a defense lawyer for
a suspect in a related attack.
   A grand jury, meanwhile, indicted a sixth teen-ager in the
jogger's attack, and city officials announced a beefing up of
security in the area near the attack.
   ``This crime was an outrage which shocked every New Yorker,''
said Parks Commissioner Henry Stern at a Central Park news
conference.
   The new protection plan will include mounted police patrols,
increased police car surveillance and the use of police decoys,
officials said.
   ``Every once in a while something happens that is so shocking
and terrible that it brings about a tremendous counterattack,''
said Stern. ``I think that's what happened here.''
   On Friday afternoon, a grand jury indicted 14-year-old Kevin
Richardson, the only suspect who admitted raping the woman in his
statement to police. Six teen-agers are now charged as members of
the wolf pack who brutalized the woman during a night of
``wilding.''
   Richardson was charged with rape, attempted murder, assault,
sodomy, robbery and riot. He was held without bail pending a May 10
hearing.
   While Stern detailed the security changes, a confrontation
erupted at state Supreme Court between spectators and court
officers Friday morning when acting Justice Carol Berkman ordered
defense attorney Alton H. Maddox Jr. removed from court.
   Maddox had repeatedly refused to follow the judge's instructions
to sit down and remain silent during the hearing.
   As spectators stood and screamed at the officers to leave Maddox
alone, Berkman left the bench, and court officers entered the
courtroom with billy clubs and riot helmets. When the judge
returned five minutes later, Maddox and co-counsel Joseph Mack
turned and walked out.
   They returned 45 minutes later and the judge denied bail for
their client, 17-year-old Michael Briscoe, after an exchange with
Mack over his conduct. Briscoe is one of two teens being held for
an attack on a male jogger that same night.
   Earlier, Berkman refused to set bail immediately for three other
defendants _ Kharey Wise, 16; Antron McCray, 15; and Steve Lopez,
15 _ and told their attorneys to submit their bail applications in
writing.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer, arguing against
bail, called the April 19 assault on the Wall Street investment
banker ``the most vicious and brutal crime in New York to date.''
   ``As a result of their rampage, a 28-year-old woman is lying
unconscious in Metropolitan Hospital,'' said Lederer. ``She was
raped, sodomized and brutally beaten, and then left bleeding for
hours in the thickest woods.''
   The victim, a native of suburban Pittsburgh, remained comatose
and on life-support systems Friday.
   In an effort to defuse any racial tensions caused by the attack,
Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins met Friday with about 60
community and religious leaders and said they would hold a
``massive assembly and march'' in the neighborhood where the rape
took place. It was tentatively set for May 7.

<HEAD>Miami Vice Wraps Up; Debate Continues Over Effects On City</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Miami Vice,'' the fashion-conscious cop show that
once dominated television's Top 10, filmed its last episode this
week, and city leaders were unsure whether Vice has been a virtue.
   Most city officials would agree that the program brought a new
sense of excitement to Miami's tattered image, but some fear the
program's obsession with drug smugglers and violent crime may have
scared off tourists and outsiders.
   The final scenes were shot Thursday night at a luxurious house
in Miami Beach, and some of the cast and production crew held a
farewell party Friday night.
   The program is widely recognized for its influence on men's
fashion, television-filming techniques and rock-music scores for
television.
   As its popularity grew, life imitated art, and both Miami and
Miami Beach saw a boom in bright pastels and a glorification of art
deco.
   The producers of Miami Vice decided this season would be the
last season, saying the five-year show had run its course. Once one
of TV's most watched shows, A.C. Nielsen Co.'s end-of-the-year
ratings recently ranked the NBC show in 65th place.
   Television writer Anthony Yerkovich said in an interview that
his idea for the show came out of visits in the early 1980s, when
the area faced race riots, drug shootouts and waves of new
immigrants.
   ``It seemed to be a real border town, an American Casablanca _
with all the hopes and dreams that implies,'' Yerkovich said. ``The
city inspired the show in the sense that we had a vision of Miami
that wasn't connected to the reality of the town.''
   Sidney Levin, a founding member of the Beacon Council, which
promotes the city's business climate, said Friday that the
television show gave Miami ``the feeling of a new city, a city that
a lot of tourists had never seen.
   ``It made a fashion trend ... a Miami style. There hadn't been a
Miami style since the 1940s and '50s,'' Levin said.
   Some civic leaders said they winced when they heard the show's
title.
   ``Here came a show to be called `Miami Vice,' a shoot'em-up,''
Levin said. ``I think if you could have taken a vote that day, they
would have voted the show out of town.''
   He said many people who promote the city will be relieved to see
the show go because of its emphasis on violence and drugs.
   ``We were trying to combat an image problem,'' said former Dade
County manager Merrett Stierheim. ``We were always a target for
various publications that take a delight in beating on Miami.
   ``I want to say kind things,'' he said, ``but the jury is out as
to the total impact on Greater Miami.''
   The plot of the last show is strikingly similar to the first
one, aired Sept. 16, 1984. The main characters _ Sonny Crockett,
played by Don Johnson, and Rico Tubbs, played by Philip Michael
Thomas _ are sent to the fictional South American country of Costa
Morado to bring back a corrupt dictator to testify against
international drug traffickers. The ending is secret.
   The final show is scheduled to be shown May 21.
   Johnson and Thomas say they'll keep their ties to the community.
Johnson said he may open a restaurant and race powerboats, while
Thomas plans to open a theater for young actors.
   ``I'm not leaving Miami,'' Thomas said. ``This is home for me.''

<TEXT>
   Colt Firearms, maker of the gun that won
the West, has been placed on the auction block.
   A 3-year-old strike by hundreds of Colt workers and the recent
loss of its contract to make M-16 rifles for the military _ its
main business _ have hampered the company. But officials at parent
company Colt Industries said those problems didn't force a sale.
   ``It's a going business and it's profitable, and, of course, it
has a history of quality products,'' company spokesman Michael G.
Dunn said Friday.
   New York-based Colt Industries is selling the firearms division
so it can concentrate on its aerospace, automotive and industrial
service operations, Dunn said.
   The Colt company was founded in Hartford in 1836 by Samuel Colt,
the inventor of the first successful repeating pistol.
   After the entrepreneur's death in 1862, his company manufactured
the six-shooter that every cowboy carried in his holster and that
was said to have won the West.
   About 800 workers at Colt Firearms' Connecticut plants have been
on strike since January 1986 in a dispute over wages and benefits.
   ``I think (the sale) might be a good omen,'' said Robert Madore,
president of United Auto Workers Local 376, which represents the
strikers. ``I think maybe a new face, a new owner might turn it
around.''
   Colt had produced the M-16 rifle for the Army since 1964. But
last October, the Army announced it was dropping Colt after it was
underbid for a contract to produce about 1 million rifles.
   Colt also makes the Colt 45 handgun, the King Cobra magnum
revolver.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S.-Japan agreement to jointly produce 130 new
FSX fighter jets for Japan will promote defense and technological
cooperation between the nations, officials said today.
   Defense Agency chief Kichiro Tazawa said in a statement that the
countries had reached a better understanding of each other through
their talks on the FSX craft, which is a new, more sophisticated
version of the American F-16 jet.
   President Bush announced in Washington Friday that the United
States will produce the FSX _ or fighter support experimental _
with Japan despite congressional concern over loss of U.S. jobs and
technology.
   ``The joint development of the aircraft will be extremely
important for defense cooperation between the United States and
Japan,'' Tazawa said in the statement.
   The Defense Agency late Friday decided to give the United States
a 40 percent share of the development and production of the jet.
   It also agreed to allow the United States to protect the
computer codes used to help fly and control the plane, which will
be a joint project of General Dynamics and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries.
   Mitsubishi told Kyodo News Service it expects the project, to
begin at the end of June, to cost about $7.2 billion.
   An unidentified Japanese diplomat said Japan expects the
agreement to become a ``model of technology sharing'' between Tokyo
and Washington.
   Bush told reporters Friday that he had agreed to go ahead with
the project because he was convinced that ``co-development of this
aircraft is in the strategic and commercial interests of the United
States.''
   Congress has 30 days to review the agreement, and the House and
Senate can reject it with a joint resolution.

<TEXT>
   The wife of the USS Vincennes skipper, who lost
her teaching job after a suspected terrorist bombing, handed in her
resignation in exchange for $135,000 and said the school bowed to
terrorism.
   Officials at La Jolla Country Day School said they had to put
the safety of students and faculty first, and they felt Sharon
Rogers' presence on campus posed a risk to the safety of others
that could not be ignored.
   After weeks of negotiations over her future at the school, the
severance settlement was announced Friday.
   The resignation is effective Aug. 31, when her contract expires.
The school also agreed to pay $5,000 to her lawyer.
   Mrs. Rogers, 50, escaped injury March 10 when a pipe bomb
exploded beneath her van as she drove alone to school. The attack
is under investigation as possible retaliation for the Vincennes'
mistaken downing last July 3 of an Iranian airliner in the Persian
Gulf. All 290 people aboard the airplane died.
   ``Many people have asked me if I am angry at the way I have been
treated by the school. I may say that over the past weeks I have
felt many different emotions, but today I am simply just
disappointed. More disappointed than I can possibly express,'' she
said, choking back tears.
   Asked if she felt some school officials and parents had
capitulated to terrorism she replied: ``I have a feeling some of
them have, yes.''
   ``I feel very sad for our country,'' Mrs. Rogers told a news
conference also attended by her husband, USS Vincennes skipper Will
C. Rogers III, and guarded by a dozen plainclothes security agents.
It was their first public appearance since the van bombing.
   ``The school believed, and continues to believe, that Sharon's
presence on campus would pose an unreasonable risk to the children
at school,'' said Bernie Fipp, president of the school's board of
trustees.
   Many parents at the 700-pupil school said they supported her
desire to remain as a teacher, but others threatened to pull their
children out of classes.
   Mrs. Rogers taught for nearly half of her 25-year teaching
career at the school and was paid about $32,000 last year. She said
she would try to find another job.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer's tax revision plan,
heralded by proponents as a break with Louisiana's past and
condemned by opponents as a windfall for big business, fell into
the hands of the voters today.
   The controversial plan would overturn decades of populist
tradition by raising taxes and cutting the load on businesses.
   Roemer has pushed for a radical restructuring of the tax system,
saying it is vital in order to create jobs in the state with the
nation's highest unemployment rate, which is higher than 11 percent.
   ``Jobs now,'' the governor said of his plan.
   But opponents led by Rep. David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan
leader who won a special election in February, criticized the plan
as harmful to individual taxpayers.
   The referendum is on a proposed constitutional amendment
authorizing the Legislature to make basic changes in the tax system.
   A new tax code approved by legislators during a special session
in late February and early March would take effect if the amendment
passes. Among other things, the new code would increase individual
income taxes and give businesses incentives to move into the state
and expand.
   The package also would raise the gasoline tax by 4 cents a
gallon to fund a $1.4 billion in improvements on highways, airports
and shipping ports.
   If the referendum is defeated, the Legislature would have to cut
more than $600 million from an already tight budget, which Roemer
has said is impossible.
   Oil companies have footed much of the state's bills for decades,
but the recession in the industry has cut tax revenues drastically
in recent years and cast the state into a series of budget crises.
   Through a blitz of radio and television spots financed by more
than $1.2 million from backers, Roemer has touted the plan as a way
of creating jobs and ending Louisiana's dependence on the petroleum
industry.
   But opponents say most of the tax breaks will be enjoyed by the
state's 1,000 largest corporations, many of which are not
labor-intensive, and that new jobs will not be created.
   ``It's bad for business, it's bad for the consumer,'' said Duke.
``You don't raise taxes in a recession.''
   Secretary of State Fox McKeithen said he expected more than 40
percent of the state's 2 million registered voters to cast ballots.
   The plan would cost an extra $126 million over the current tax
load. But opponents point out that as of July 1, the tax load
increase would be $526 million.
   Last summer, the Legislature approved a one-year sales tax
increase of $500 million to keep the government solvent. That
increase was scheduled to expire on July 1, but Roemer's package
would make about $400 million of that tax permanent.

<HEAD>Labor Unions Honor Those Who Died On The Job</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the first observance of Workers Memorial Day, the
government's record on worker safety was criticized, a bugler
played ``Taps,'' and roll calls were read of the hundreds of people
who died on the job in the United States last year.
   From northern Maine to southern California and Honolulu, workers
paused Friday to remember those killed in job-related accidents.
The events were organized by labor unions to highlight workplace
safety.
   The unions chose Friday because it is the 19th anniversary of
the founding of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   An estimated 10,000 people are killed each year on the job. The
jobs that carry the highest risk of fatal injury, according to the
government, are in mining, transportation, construction and
agriculture.
   Many decried unsafe working conditions.
   ``Working men and women of America will not tolerate that type
of exploitation,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said at a
gathering of 500 people in Kansas City, Mo. ``We will fight until
the day of the spilling of workers' blood in the workplace is but a
memory.''
   In Philadelphia, members of six unions gathered at noon to read
the names of the 252 workers killed in the state last year from
industrial accidents. As a bagpiper played ``Amazing Grace,'' 252
red carnations were dropped into the Delaware River.
   Elsewhere in Pennsylvania, union members, some wearing black
armbands, gathered at the Capitol in Harrisburg to mourn co-workers
who died on the job. In Pittsburgh, United Steelworkers officials
read the names of 23 other workers killed at work in the last two
years.
   ``The body count alone is a call to action,'' said Julius
Uehlein, president of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO.
   In Texas, politicians and union officials condemned the state's
No. 1 rank in job-related deaths.
   U.S. Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, said much of the ``annual
carnage'' in the workplace could be avoided and criticized the
Reagan administration for cutting the OSHA budget by 25 percent
since 1980.
   Bryant said President Bush seeks further cuts. Texas leads the
nation with an average of 781 deaths per year, said Joe Gunn,
secretary-treasurer of the Texas AFL-CIO.
   A moment of silence was called for in New Jersey to remember
those who died or were injured in job-related accidents.
   ``The purpose of this is to commemorate the lives of those
individuals and to support new efforts for new safety efforts on
the job,'' said Rick Engler, spokesman for the New Jersey
Industrial Union Council, AFL-CIO.
   In Utah, a bugler played ``Taps'' and the flag outside the Salt
Lake Union Labor Center was lowered to half-staff as about 50
people gathered for the memorial.
   And in Honolulu, a memorial service was held to honor flight
attendant Clarabelle ``C.B.'' Lansing, the only person to die when
the roof of Aloha Air Flight 243 ripped open exactly one year
earlier.

   Thunderstorms drenched much of the nation today, while snow fell
in Minnesota and Colorado.
   Showers and thunderstorms this morning extended from
northeastern Texas and southeastern Oklahoma across much of
Arkansas. Thunderstorms also extended from east-central Missouri to
southern Ohio and northern West Virginia.
   Elsewhere, scattered showers and thunderstorms also dampened
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, while light rain
fell on the upper Mississippi Valley and the central Plains.
   Snow was falling over Duluth, Minn., and Trinidad, Colo.
   Heavier rainfall for the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT included
1{ inches in Cincinnati and nearly an inch in Belleville, Ill., and
Columbus, Ohio.
   On Friday, a severe thunderstorm in west-central Indiana spawned
a tornado at Oaktown. Thunderstorms also produced more than 2
inches of rain in Fairfield, Ohio, and dropped baseball size-hail
on Arlington, Texas, and golf ball-size hail at Valley Station, Ky.
Strong thunderstorm winds downed power lines around Grady, Ark.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from southeast Texas across the Gulf Coast and over the Tennessee
and Ohio valleys to the middle and south Atlantic Coast; rain
showers from Iowa across the Great Lakes region to New York and New
Jersey; and a mixture of rain and snow from Minnesota across the
northern Plains to the northern and central Rockies.
   Highs were expected to be in the 40s and 50s over most of New
England and from the northern and central Rockies across the
northern half of the Great Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley
to Michigan; in the 80s from California to southern New Mexico and
from Texas across the Gulf Coast and Tennessee Valley to the
southern Atlantic Coast; in the 90s in Florida and the desert
Southwest; and in the 60s and 70s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 18
degrees at Yellowstone Park in Wyoming to 79 degrees at Key West,
Fla.

   An enlisted man who earned a
Distinguished Service Cross in World War II has finally received
it, thanks to the prodding of a now-deceased Air Force colonel.
   ``It was 45 years ago they signed me up for that medal, but I
never received it _ until (a week ago) Wednesday,'' said Jim Bird,
67, a retired machinist.
   Retired Air Force Col. Fred Witzgall was researching Bird's Army
division and found Bird never received the medal he was awarded for
helping capture about 20 German soldiers on Dec. 26, 1944, in
Luxembourg.
   Witzgall sent Bird the necessary applications two years ago, and
Bird sent them on to the Army. By the time the medal arrived in the
mail, Bird couldn't thank the retired colonel. Witzgall died March
15.
   Bird said he doesn't reflect much on his service days.
   ``All that stuff tends to weigh you down after a while,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of Exxon and Alaska's
governor stepped up their feud over the cleanup of oil from the
Exxon Valdez, and a mountain climber scaled the company's Anchorage
office to protest the spill.
   Meanwhile, high seas and stiff winds sidelined thousands of
cleanup workers tackling the nation's largest spill on Friday, but
officials said nature was helping the effort some by washing oil
off beaches and back into Prince William Sound.
   Gov. Steve Cowper accused Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl of
misleading the public and shirking the blame for responding slowly
to the March 24 spill, which poured more than 10 million gallons of
Alaskan crude into the sound.
   Rawl has blamed the state and the Coast Guard for delaying the
use of dispersants to control the oil slick.
   ``If an untrue statement continues to be repeated time after
time after time after time, and you don't make an effort to refute
that statement, then people will believe it like it was gospel,''
Cowper said in a letter to Rawl on Friday.
   Rawl shot back with his own letter, which was shared with The
Associated Press, accusing Cowper of spreading a fantasy.
   ``Unfortunately for all concerned, your letter of April 28 does
not set the record straight,'' Rawl wrote. ``In fact, it
perpetuates a good many wrong assertions.''
   Cowper said the Coast Guard approved tests of dispersants to
control the spill the day it occurred. The state asked for
restrictions only after Exxon sprayed the dispersant carelessly,
hitting Coast Guard and oil company workers, he said.
   Rawl said that barring state restrictions, there was enough
dispersant on hand and en route to the scene control the entire
spill. He said the chemical was safe for the environment and marine
wildlife.
   Because of the slow start, quick sea currents carried the oil
down Alaska's southern coast, where it has claimed the lives of
thousands of sea birds and hundreds of otters.
   On Friday, thousands of workers were sidelined in the sound and
the Gulf of Alaska for a third straight day.
   ``The weather was too rough to get people onto the beaches,''
said Coast Guard spokeswoman Kathleen Donohoe.
   Low clouds over the gulf kept sheen-spotting planes and the oil
skimmers they serve at bay, Donohoe said. The Vaidogubsky, a giant
Soviet skimmer counted on for big help, turned toward the port of
Homer for fuel and supplies.
   Nevertheless, one official said choppy seas had washed some oil
off the beaches and back into the sound. And oil concentrations in
the sound are much lighter than they were two weeks ago, said Jerry
Galt of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``We're seeing sheens that are almost solely associated with
rewashing,'' Galt said. ``Compared to what we were seeing two weeks
ago, three weeks ago, it's quite light.''
   In Anchorage, Michael A. Tumey climbed out onto the roof of
Exxon's office and rapelled halfway down the eight-story building
before attaching a sign that read: ``Oil Spilled, Exxon Kills,
Remember The Sound.''
   ``The environment comes first. If you can't make a dollar and
spare the environment, then get out of the business,'' said Tumey,
34, a parks system caretaker who was arrested for trespassing when
he got to the ground.

<HEAD>Tornado Victims Face Food, Medical Shortages, Toll 700</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HASAN SAEED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of tornado victims
face severe food and medicine shortages, the government said today
as the death toll from this week's storm surpassed 700.
   Relief Ministry officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
said rescue workers searching the debris of buildings in the
villages of Saturia and Hargoz found 40 more bodies overnight.
   About 12,000 people were injured when the tornado struck central
Bangladesh on Wednesday and severely damaged more than 20 small
villages.
   The death toll was expected to rise further because about 400
people listed as missing are now believed dead, the officials said,
and bodies still were being recovered from the rubble of destroyed
homes.
   The daily Bangladesh Observer said at least 5,000 people were
missing and 20,000 others injured, many of them in critical
condition in hospitals in Dhaka and neighboring districts leveled
by the storm.
   Doctors at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, considered the
country's most modern hospital, said no deaths were reported today.
However, they said they faced an acute shortage of medicine and
blood.
   About 400 of the injured were at the hospital, said one doctor.
The government appealed to people to give blood.
   The storm ravaged about 45 square miles of the Manikganj
district, 25 miles northwest of Dhaka.
   The tornado was accompanied by hail and showers, and came hours
after President Hussain Muhammad Ershad led nationwide prayers for
rains to ease a two-month drought. In Dhaka alone, more than 75,000
people joined Ershad in a service.
   The drought has threatened to destroy half of the nation's
spring rice crop. Most of Bangladesh's 110 million people rely on
agriculture for their livelihoods.
   The daily Sangbad reported today that 100,000 people in the
Manikganj district faced starvation because of the tornado.
   ``There is no shelter for the affected people, no food and no
water,'' the independent daily said.
   An official of the Red Crescent, the Moslem equivalent of the
Red Cross, said a lack of medicine and shelter also were problems.
   ``Many of those who survived face starvation and have not eaten
since Wednesday,'' Mohammed Rashid, a Red Crescent official in
Saturia, told The Associated Press. ``It is our estimate that more
than 30,000 houses have been demolished by the tornado.''
   Red Crescent officials said delays in the delivery of government
relief supplies had caused resentment among tornado victims.
   Relief Ministry officials said they had rushed 90 tons of
supplies to ravaged areas and planned to send more, including
medicine, clothing and rice and biscuits.
   Volunteer groups helped the Red Crescent in relief work,
including digging mass graves. Arshed Ali Chowdhury, a school
teacher at Saturia, said volunteers had buried more than 100 bodies.
   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with an annual
per capita income of $160, is repeatedly afflicted by floods and
drought.
   Summer floods last year left four-fifths of the country under
water and killed at least 1,400 people. In November, cyclones
claimed another 1,100 lives.

<HEAD>Yale, Brookhaven Tests Fail To Confirm Cold Fusion Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yale University and Brookhaven National
Laboratory scientists say three weeks of tests failed to produce
room-temperature fusion and that they are skeptical of findings
announced by Utah researchers.
   No emissions of neutrons or gamma rays, which would be evidence
of atomic fusion, were detected in excess of normal background
radiation, according to preliminary results from the Yale
experiments.
   Yale physics professor Moshe Gai said Friday the tests conducted
at the Arthur W. Wright Nuclear Structure Laboratory failed to
confirm the findings of scientists from the University of Utah and
Brigham Young University.
   But Gai also emphasized that he and his collaborators cannot say
they have disproved the fusion findings at the University of Utah.
Physicists said they were hampered by a lack of details about the
Utah experiments.
   He also said scientists did not try to test all claims.
   But he said the data from the Yale tests are extremely clean and
``from what I see, I have good reason to be skeptical.''
   The Utah researchers shocked physicists last month by claiming
to have produced cold fusion using simple lab equipment, a process
that could provide a source of abundant, clean energy.
   The two groups said they obtained fusion by dunking palladium or
platinum electrodes in solutions of heavy water and passing
electricity through them. Heavy water contains deuterium, a form of
hydrogen with one extra neutron.
   Until last month, scientists assumed that the fusion of hydrogen
atoms, which power the sun, stars and hydrogen bombs, occurs only
at extremely high temperatures and pressures.
   The scientists at both Utah and Brigham Young reported their
tests produced emission of neutrons, evidence of fusion.
   Yale and Brookhaven scientists will present their findings at an
American Physical Society meeting in Baltimore on Monday.
   Gai said the team tried to reproduce as many of the previously
done experiments as possible.
   Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also
have failed to reproduce the Utah experiments and are working on
new theories to explain the puzzling Utah results.
   Georgia Tech and Texas A&amp;M announced they had reproduced parts
of the experiments but then withdrew their claims after realizing
their measuring equipment might be flawed.

   Pope John Paul II donated $50,000
today to a local archdiocese to show the Roman Catholic church's
desire to help the poor on this impoverished island.
   ``I would like ... in particular to express my affection for
those of you are suffering ... those who are bearing the weight of
loneliness and poverty,'' the pontiff said during an open air Mass
near the airport of this northern port.
   He spoke of the role of missionaries who ``meet the poor as well
as the rich, the powerful and the humble, the sick as well as the
healthy. They have given much energy and love to health care and
education.''
   Upon his arrival Friday night for the start of his fifth African
tour, the pope promised the church would do all it could to help
the poor.
   The pontiff also said he was willing to meet with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, but that obstacles prevent him from making a
papal tour of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev is to travel to Italy in November, and a visit to the
Vatican would be the first ever between a pope and a Soviet
Communist chief.
   The pope said he would meet Gorbachev ``with great respect as
the head of state, the head of a system.''
   But, the pontiff added, he would be unable to visit the Soviet
Union because of continuing problems between the Roman Catholic
church and state that dates from the repression of Ukrainian
Catholics in 1946 by the late dictator Josep Stalin.
   Today, Ukrainian Catholics form the largest underground church
in the Soviet Union.
   ``This is really a very difficult problem,'' the pope said. The
Vatican and Soviet Orthodox Church leaders are discussing the issue
but no early breakthrough is expected.
   Madagascar is the pope's first stop on a nine-day tour that also
includes visits to the French island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean
and the African nations of Zambia and Malawi.
   Malagasy, as citizens of Madagascar are known, gathered at the
airport and waved flags and banners when the pope arrived.
   The pope kissed the ground upon arrival and said the Catholic
Church would do all it could to help the impoverished nation. ``The
bishops of this country have called on all their brothers to work
with determination to rehabilitate the economy,'' he added.
   Like many African countries, the government has abandoned
socialist policies to gain needed Western aid and improve a
moribund economy.
   President Didier Ratsiraka used the occasion to criticize
opposition parties, which blame his government for the nation's
protracted economic problems and accuse him of rigging last month's
presidential elections.
   The opposition declared a ``papal truce'' and halted six days of
anti-government riots that claimed six lives.
   Roman Catholic clergymen also have been highly critical of
Ratsiraka's government, and a committee of Catholic and Protestant
clergymen who observed the March 12 presidential election said
there were widespread irregularities.
   Ratsiraka won by 63 percent of the vote. Western diplomats say
any irregularities likely did not significantly affect the outcome.
   A Vatican official said the pope was expected to address the
issue of political ethics during his visit.
   Later today, the pope was to meet with youths in a soccer
stadium in Antananarivo, the capital, and in the evening meet with
Catholic and Protestant clergymen.
   About 40 percent of the population of the former French colony
is Christian and the rest animist. Half the Christians are Roman
Catholic.

   Inaugurations have changed a bit since George
Washington became America's first president 200 years ago, as this
weekend's anniversary celebration of his swearing in will
demonstrate.
   An estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people witnessed the 1789
celebration, but more than 2 million people are expected to turn
out for the staged re-enactment of the inauguration, a fireworks
display, a 63-ship flotilla, a speech by President Bush and other
events Saturday and Sunday.
   Certainly the price tag has gone up. City officials estimate
police overtime and other costs to taxpayers will reach $3.5
million for the two days.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said it was the biggest event to be held in
New York since the 1986 Statue of Liberty centennial.
   A parade of ships will kick off ceremonies Saturday afternoon.
Police Chief Robert J. Johnston Jr. estimated at least 2 million
people would line New York shorelines to see the vessels sail up
the Hudson River. A similar turnout is expected for the Saturday
night fireworks.
   The flotilla will include the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal,
which will exchange 13-gun salutes with Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn
just before noon. Then the USS Ticonderoga will lead the ships
through New York Harbor and up the Hudson to the George Washington
Bridge.
   Thirteen Navy ships will represent the 13 original Colonies.
They will be accompanied by 50 civilian ships representing the 50
states.
   The 22-minute pyrotechnics Saturday night will be choreographed
to the tune of ``Hail to the Chief.'' The fireworks will be set off
at 8:45 p.m. on the East River at the foot of Wall Street, where
Washington landed before his inauguration. The music and a
narration by Walter Cronkite will be broadcast over two local radio
stations.
   Sunday's events in lower Manhattan begin with an ecumenical
service at St. Paul's Chapel, where Washington prayed after his
swearing in. Afterward, Bush will participate in the dedication of
the new Museum of Constitutional Government in Federal Hall.
   Next comes the inauguration re-enactment at the hall, where
Washington took the oath of office on April 30, 1789, followed by
speech to the nation by Bush. Festivities conclude with a parade up
lower Broadway that repeats a procession of 200 years ago.
   Koch said in addition to the $3.5 million the city expects to
spend on police overtime, sanitation and other costs, another $2.6
million was raised by the private sector to pay for various
production expenses.

   Three young Chinese women lured to San
Francisco with a promise of dance lessons were kept in an apartment
and forced to perform domestic labor, authorities said.
   ``Basically, they were used to do domestic chores around the
residence. They could come and go, but it was a very structured
type of come and go,'' District Attorney chief investigator John
Majka said Friday, one day after authorities freed the women.
   The women _ ages 14, 19 and 20 _ had no money and no place to
go. They were placed in protective custody pending the outcome of
an the investigation, Majka said.
   One of the women had lived in the apartment for nearly a year.
   Police seized a large number of documents and other records at
the apartment and workplace of the homeowner, who police identified
only as a Chinese man. The documents were written in various
Chinese dialects and may take some time to evaluate, Majka said.
   No charges have been filed yet.
   The women were apparently lured from China with a promise of
studying dance at a fictitious school called the San Francisco
College of Music and Theater Arts.
   ``All of the girls appeared to be in generally good physical
condition. They were very happy and they thanked the investigators
for taking them out,'' Majka said. ``We believe they may have been
held against their will there.''
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said they were
unsure of the women's immigration status and were investigating it.
   The District Attorney's office received a letter earlier this
month suggesting they investigate the women's living situation.

   ``It'll be George to George that day,'' said Wayne Baruch of
Radio City Music Hall Productions, which is producing the weekend's
events.
   ``Two centuries of the presidency is one of the great success
stories in human history. What we're celebrating is the enduring
strength and leadership of the presidency.''
   Today's celebration was to begin with a flotilla of ships up the
harbor.
   The fireworks display will be the city's second largest ever
after the Statue of Liberty show of 1986, but will outshine even
that show in some regards, organizers said.
   ``It should be more exciting than Liberty Weekend because people
will see a lot of special effects,'' said Donna Grucci, vice
president of Fireworks by Grucci, which is handling the
pyrotechnics.
   Ms. Grucci said the show will include the Grucci Split Comet,
``a golden weeping willow that crosses and crackles at the tips,''
magnesium blasts ``which will turn the night into day,'' and
humbler multi-colored low-level fountains ``like they had 200 years
ago.''
   The fireworks will be timed to coincide with band music and the
mellifluous tones of Walter Cronkite, who will be narrating the
show called ``Hail to the Chief.''
   On Sunday, the celebration becomes more serious as the incumbent
presidential George joins a George Washington stand-in for a
reenactment of the first inauguration.
   The reenactment at Federal Hall in lower Manhattan will resemble
the 1789 original, if you ignore the large-screen TV alongside the
platform. It will be followed by a parade through town with modern
military bands and 18th century-style fife and drum corps.
   The Designated George is William Sommerfield, a gray-haired
Philadelphian who looks and acts the part of Washington.
   ``People don't realize that every 50 years there's been a huge
celebration of the inauguration in New York City,'' said Wayne
Baruch of Radio City Music Hall Productions, which is producing the
weekend's events. ``This is the fourth one.''
   On Friday, there was a smattering of events up and down
Manhattan, from a scholarly symposium on Washington at the Fraunces
Tavern Museum downtown to a ceremony on the 100-year-old Washington
Bridge over the Harlem River.

   Senior government officials met today with
student activists seeking democratic reforms but failed to resolve
issues that have caused almost two weeks of large-scale protests
against China's political system.
   State Council spokesman Yuan Mu and State Education Minister He
Dongchang met for 3{ hours with both student activists and
representatives of officially sanctioned student unions.
   It was the first government contact with the student activists.
The government has declared their organizations illegal.
   The appearance of Yuan, believed to be part of the inner circle
of the nation's top decision-makers, was an indication of how
serious the government regards the recent student unrest.
   The Chinese government criticized a U.S. statement on the recent
demonstrations, calling it inappropriate because the demonstrations
are ``purely China's internal affair.'' In Washington, the State
Department had said that all peoples should have the right of
peaceful assembly, ``including peaceful protest and freedom of
expression.''
   The meeting took place in offices of the All-China Youth
Federation, a government body encompassing various youth groups.
   Wu'er Kaixi, the president of the United Association of Beijing
Universities, a group newly formed by student activists, was
invited to the meeting but not allowed to attend after he refused
to give up a plan to openly denounce the government's position that
the association is illegal.
   Zhou Yongjun, another representative of the independent student
group who attended the meeting, said it was a failure because the
government side refused to recognize the legitimacy of the
association.
   He said State Education Minister repeated the government
argument that the association was illegal, but ``he couldn't say
which law we've broken. That to me was a victory.''
   After the protests began, students at 41 Beijing colleges ousted
their school-appointed student federations and set up their own
student committees. Each of the committees in turn chose
representatives to the United Association of Beijing Universities.
   Zhou said the weeklong class boycott in force in most Beijing
universities would continue. The students are demanding freedoms of
press and speech and an end to official corruption.
   Zhou said the student side raised questions of bureaucracy and
corruption in the meeting. He said Yuan sought to placate the
students by saying that a shrill editorial in the Communist Party
mouthpiece People's Daily last week was directed at only a minority
of the students.
   The editorial accused the students of being unpatriotic and said
they were involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the Communist Party
and the government.
   Students reacted to the editorial by staging a 15-hour march
through the streets of Beijing on Thursday. Up to 150,000 marchers
were cheered on by tens of thousands of citizens along the way in
one of the boldest challenges ever to the Communist Party
leadership.
   Zhou complained that the government side did not treat the
student leaders as equals. He said there were no plans for further
meetings with the government.
   Of the 40 students at the meeting, about half were from the
newly formed student-chosen activist groups and the other half from
the official student unions which the activists have rejected.
   One activist leader said many from the official student unions
supported their cause.
   The campuses were quiet today, with classrooms empty and many
students outside enjoying the spring weather.
   At Beijing Normal University scattered groups of students said
in one classroom building quietly studying, but no classes were in
session.
   Student leaders have said the strike will go on until Thursday,
the 70th anniversary of China's first student demonstrations for
democracy.

   The nation's 130,000 police were on
top alert today, and officers arrested workers and students trying
to take part in rallies to celebrate the May Day labor holiday.
   News reports said police in provincial cities set up
round-the-clock checkpoints and blocked workers from going to Seoul
for labor marches on Sunday. The international labor holiday
actually is on Monday.
   In Seoul, 5,000 riot police accompanied by armored vans carrying
tear gas launchers surrounded Yonsei University and nearby streets.
State radio said police arrested 1,400 workers and students who
tried to enter the sprawling campus. But another 2,000 students and
workers shouting ``Down with Roh Tae-woo,'' Korea's president, held
a rally at the school.
   Bands of students brandishing iron bars and firebombs clashed
sporadically with police outside the campus to protest the blockade.
   Opposition parties urged the government to permit the May Day
rallies in Seoul. But the government refused, saying they would
threaten public safety.
   Radical students, whose anti-government protests have not won
wide public support, are trying to build an alliance with workers
to topple the government.
   Government officials said more than 20,000 police will be
stationed in Seoul on Sunday to quell any protests, but dissidents
and militant workers vowed to go ahead with their plans.
   Government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrest and
increasingly violent strikes for more pay and better working
conditions.
   The governing party chairman, Park Jyun-kyu, said on Friday that
if the strikes do not end, ``declaration of a presidential
emergency decree should be seriously considered.''
   Opposition parties today called for parliamentary investigations
into alleged police torture of workers arrested in the labor
protests.
   They contended a dozen union leaders were tortured by electric
cattle prods, triggering violent protests this week by striking
workers in the southeastern industrial city of Changwon and nearby
Masan.
   Police denied the charge, and about 4,000 officers resigned en
masse on Friday and today to protest an alleged assault on the
police superintendent by an opposition lawmaker in Changwon.
   National Assemblyman Sim Wan-koo reportedly slapped the
suprintendent in the face on Thursday when he visited Changwon to
look into labor unrest.
   National Police Director Jo Chong-suk appealed for restraint and
refused to accept the resignations.
   Reports said Sim and four other opposition lawmakers were
infuriated when police arrested a union leader who was with them.
The man had been sought by police for unlawful labor activity.

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of
Japan arrived in Thailand today to begin a nine-day trip through
Southeast Asia while his political party tried to select his
successor back home.
   Takeshita, who says he will resign soon because of his
involvement in a stock-profiteering scandal, was greeted at
Bangkok's International Airport by his Thai counterpart, Chatichai
Choonhavan.
   Takeshita also is to visit Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and
the Philippines, which together with Thailand and Brunei form the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Japan has strong ties to
the group.
   ``On this current trip, I hope to further deepen and broaden
Japan's relations with ASEAN as well as our bilateral relations
with the individual ASEAN countries,'' Takeshita said in an arrival
statement. He said cooperative relations between Japan and Thailand
had grown by ``leaps and bounds.''
   Back home, Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party continued
to work on finding a successor for Takeshita, who announced Tuesday
he would resign.
   News reports suggest the party may name former Foreign Minister
Masayoshi Ito, 75, as the new prime minister. Ito has said his age
and health problems with diabetes should disqualify him, but many
believe he would accept if asked.
   Takeshita said he was going ahead with the trip to Asia to
``maintain continuity'' in Japan's foreign policy. Developing
countries in Southeast Asia have been pressing Japan for economic
aid.
   The daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun said today that Takeshita and
his Cabinet probably would resign around May 20, a week before the
deadline for the upper house of parliament to approve the nation's
1989 budget.
   The governing party forced the $445 billion spending plan
through the powerful lower house Friday without bothering to try to
reach a consensus, a move condemned by the opposition, which has
boycotted parliament.
   In 35 years of unbroken rule, the Liberal Democrats had never
completely ignored the opposition in voting on the budget despite
its majority.
   A newspaper poll published today indicated that for the first
time in nine years more Japanese support the opposition parties
than the Liberal Democratic Party. In the poll, conducted by Asahi
Shimbun, 44 percent of 2,403 respondents said they supported one of
Japan's five main opposition parties or other minor parties, while
42 percent said they supported the Liberal Democrats.
   The poll was taken after Takeshita announced his resignation
plans. His popularity had dropped sharply as details of the stock
scandal surfaced.
   In the scandal, Recruit Co., an information services
conglomerate, sold unlisted stocks at low prices to about 160
prominent people, including politicians and businessmen. Many of
the recipients sold their shares after they were listed publicly
and rose sharply in value.
   Takeshita has admitted receiving more than $1 million in
political donations from Recruit in 1985-87.

<TEXT>
   An Indian supertanker that ran aground in
the Red Sea was refloated today after it spilled nearly 1 million
gallons of oil, sources said. An expert warned the oil could harm
fragile coral reefs and turtle breeding areas.
   Oil industry sources in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, said leakage
from the tanker Kanchenjunga apparently was less than had been
previously reported. A 50-mile long oil slick was breaking up, the
British Broadcasting Corp. said.
   The Saudi-based sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said an estimated 949,000 gallons of oil flowed from ruptured tanks
of the Kanchenjunga after it struck a reef near the port of Jiddah
on Wednesday.
   That spill was about 2 percent of the oil aboard the 276,744-ton
tanker, and about 8 percent of the 10 million gallons lost in the
Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska last month. Earlier, Lloyds
Shipping Intelligence Unit in London reported that 1.5 million
gallons had spilled in the Red Sea incident.
   While fears of a major pollution threat to the Red Sea eased,
one environmental expert warned that even a limited spillage could
be dangerous to the waterway's environment.
   ``The Red Sea is especially vulnerable because it has many
beautiful coral reefs, and there are some turtle breeding islands
in the area,'' said Walter Vreeland, an American advisor to the
Bahrain government on environmental problems. Vreeland also said
light crude oil, such as that carried by the Kanchenjunga, is more
toxic to marine life than heavier grades.
   Salvage industry sources said the state-owned Kanchenjunga,
believed to be India's biggest tanker, was refloated after some
cargo was pumped into another vessel, and later was taken to a
port. The cargo was to be reloaded later.
   The ship loaded about 1 million barrels of Iraqi ``Basra light''
crude at Saudi Arabia's Yanbu terminal and was bound for Bombay
when it hit the reef six miles off Jiddah. There were no injuries
reported among the crew of about 70.
   Jiddah port officials, Saudi Aramco, the national oil company,
and the Meterorological and Environmental Protection Authority, a
government agency, were jointly handling the case.
   In New Delhi, officials at the Shipping Corporation of India,
which owns the tanker, could not be reached for comment. Today was
a government holiday.
   Lloyds, which monitors shipping activities around the world,
reported on Friday that three of the ship's tanks, containing
nearly 200,000 barrels of oil, had been damaged.
   The Kanchenjunga has previously encountered trouble in the
Middle East as one of the first ships attacked in the Persian
Gulf's ``tanker war'' between Iraq and Iran. The bridge was wrecked
and two crew members were wounded in an attack by Iranian warplanes
in the Persian Gulf on Christmas Day, 1984.

<TEXT>
   Moslem gunners today lobbed shells into
Lebanon's Christian enclave in violation of a cease-fire called by
the Arab League.
   Six howitzer shells slammed into the Christian-controlled
coastal strip north of Beirut over five hours, a police spokesman
said. There was no response from army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's
Christian gunners, he said.
   Police said no casualties were reported from the sporadic
shelling.
   At least 273 people have died and 993 have been wounded in six
weeks of fierce fighting, the latest outbreak of Lebanon's 14-year
civil war.
   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said the intermittent
shelling underscored differences over terms of the cease-fire,
which took effect Friday.
   He predicted the Syrians and their Druse allies would continue
fighting until Aoun lifts a blockade of ports they have been
operating illegally.
   If the shelling continues, the spokesman said, ``It could lead
to an exchange of fire and, consequently, it would shatter the
truce.''
   After Aoun imposed the blockades, the Syrians and their allies
laid siege to the 310-square mile enclave where 1 million
Christians live.
   Although he agreed to the cease-fire, Aoun disagrees with a
provision of the cease-fire that calls for ``lifting the blockades
imposed on all sea, air and land facilities.'' Aoun, who also heads
the Christian cabinet in Lebanon's dual government, interpreted the
clause to mean that a Moslem blockade of two ports in the Christian
enclave should be raised.
   Arab League Secretary General Chedli Klibi, in cables sent late
Friday to Aoun and his Sunni Moslem rival, clarified that the
accord covered ``all sea ports irrespective of their status.''
   But the Christian leader cabled back that his blockade of the
militia-run ports was enforced ``in implementation of Lebanese
laws.''
   The half-dozen illegal ports along Lebanon's Mediterranean
coastline were stripping the state treasury of $100 million a year
in uncollected taxes.

   U.S. flags flew at half staff and 14
American war veterans bowed their heads in memory of 749 comrades
killed by German torpedo boats as they trained for the D-Day
invasion.
   The service, which took place next to a Sherman tank salvaged
from the shallows off Slapton Sands in Devon, ended a day of
tribute Friday to the American servicemen who died on April 28,
1944.
   The soldiers had been preparing amphibious landings as training
for the June 6 D-Day invasion of Normandy that summer.
   However, the training exercise turned into real battle when nine
enemy vessels chanced upon the 30,000 American troops in the
English Channel and torpedoed three of their landing craft.
   Earlier Friday, the 14 U.S. veterans boarded the British
destroyer HMS Bristol to lay a wreath on the sea off the southwest
coast of England. Many wept, hugging their wives, as they paid
their respects.
   The massacre was hushed up at the time to preserve morale in the
tense weeks before D-Day. After the war, it remained secret until
Ken Small, a local innkeeper, began investigating why so many
American servicemen's possessions kept washing up on the beach.
   Small recovered the Sherman tank in 1984 and persuaded local
authorities to turn it into a permanent memorial. His efforts led
to the dead Americans finally being officially honored at a
ceremony in 1987.
   As the wreath was thrown to the waves, a guard of honor stood to
attention on the destroyer's deck and two buglers of the Royal
Marines played ``Taps.''
   John Doyle, 72, of Missoula, Mont., who was captain of Landing
Ship Tank-515 which picked up many of the survivors, said he was
touched by the ceremony.
   ``We picked up about 100 survivors in the morning and of course
there was a lot of confusion, but this ceremony means a lot to all
of us 45 years on. I feel the people who died can now properly be
laid to rest,'' he said.
   His thoughts were echoed by other veterans who survived the
disaster.
   John Fedyszyn, 62, of Dunkirk, N.Y., was on LST-507 when a huge
explosion rocked the ship.
   ``I was in these waters for six hours until we were spotted and
picked up and I was only 17 at the time,'' he said. ``It is great
to be back but it's very emotional and I am a little tearful. It's
something I will never forget.''
   For 64-year-old Kenneth Bloch of Hicksville, N.Y., the day
marked the end of a long quest.
   ``When I was rescued from the sea, the first thing I noticed was
seeing my shipmates lying on the deck dead. For me, this is my way
of paying my tribute to all my friends,'' he said.

   Nearly 20 years after man landed on the
moon, the U.S. space program lacks clear long-range goals and
public commitment, former astronauts and NASA officials said.
   ``We need a consistent government policy,'' former space agency
administrator James M. Beggs said Friday.
   Andrew J. Stofan, a vice president of Martin Marietta's
Astronautics Group and former NASA official, said the agency should
have a strategic plan to colonize the planet Mars over the next 100
years. A manned space station would be a first step toward that
end, he said.
   Beggs and Stofan were among a panel of experts who discussed the
space program at an annual news conference of the Aviation-Space
Writers Association.
   Also at the meeting, the head of a national project to build a
spacecraft that can take off and land like an airplane, said the
plan was making great progress but proposed cuts in defense
spending were endangering it.
   ``We look at it as the opening of a new era, the era of
hypersonics,'' said Robert Barthelemy, head of the National
Aero-Space Plane project.
   The craft would be capable of horizontal takeoff and landing
from Earth to orbit, traveling at speeds of up to 17,000 miles per
hour.
   Japan, West Germany, France, the Soviet Union and Great Britain
all are working on their own hypersonic programs, Barthelemy said.
``Maybe you need a world consortium to do this,'' he added.
   Beggs said those countries also are looking at a manned space
station and eventually exploring Mars.
   ``But our leadership is no longer guaranteed. We must earn it,''
he said.
   Former astronaut Charles ``Pete'' Conrad Jr. said the
administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
should have Cabinet-level status as a secretary of space.
   Stofan said a lack of direction, long-range vision and firm
budgets have led the space agency to waste billions of dollars on
projects planned, then cut back, then planned again with nothing
accomplished.
   Another former astronaut, Joseph Allen, said several space
accomplishments were imminent. He noted the launch of the Magellan
space probe to the planet Venus from the shuttle Atlantis, which
was delayed Friday at least until next week, and the planned launch
of a Mars probe from the shuttle late this year.
   But he said it is increasingly apparent that many projects, and
particularly a manned space station, have proceeded too slowly
because of ``a lack of focused leadership.''
   `In many ways, we're not being honest to the generations to come
because of this lack of commitment and lack of a strategic plan,''
said Allen.
   Conrad said that the Apollo Applications Group recommended more
than 20 years ago that a manned space station be built and followed
by a mission to Mars. But successive presidents shot the
recommendations down.
   They were among a set of recommendations made again last year by
the National Commission on Space.
   ``It's now 1989 and the space station is about seven years
away,'' said Allen.

<HEAD>Troops Leave Bases in Namibia To Verify Withdrawal of Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African-led security forces left
their bases at dawn today to begin tracking any black nationalist
guerrillas left in the territory, a broadcast report said.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. reported that
``verification patrols of the police and territory force units are
now being deployed in Ovambo'' in northern Namibia.
   The troops had been confined to their bases since Wednesday to
give South-West Africa People's Organization guerrillas time to
follow the orders of their commanders and retreat to Angola.
   Neil van Heerden, South African foreign affairs
director-general, said troops and paramilitary police have been
urged to exercise restraint. But he acknowledged that clashes could
occur if guerrillas are found heading south, rather than north
toward Angola.
   South Africa has agreed to end its 74-year control of the
territory under a a U.N. peace plan. But South Africa claimed the
Namibian rebels, who have bases in Angola, violated the accord by
entering Nambia on April 1.
   Under the agreement, guerrillas were to stay at their bases
outside Namibia until mid-May, when they are to return as unarmed
refugees to participate in November elections provided for by the
U.N. plan.
   The South African forces were dispatched from their bases to
fight the guerrilla incursion at that time and in the next two
weeks 305 guerrillas and 27 security force members were killed,
according to the South Africans.
   Van Heerden said Angola, Cuba and South Africa agreed earlier
this week to allow another two weeks to verify whether the
guerrillas had left Namibia. He said if the South African-led
forces verify the guerrillas' departure by May 13, the peace plan
would resume.
   The three nations were the main parties in the U.N. accord that
also calls for the withdrawal of Cuban troops aiding the Marxist
government in Angola against South African- and U.S.-backed rebels.

   A passenger train derailed and plunged

   Rescue workers pulled victims from the twisted wreckage of the
Kenya Railways train in Londiani, 150 miles northwest of Nairobi,

   The train, on a run from Nairobi to western Kisumu, was carrying
772 passengers when it jumped tracks and tumbled over a cliff at
dawn, the agency said.
   Londiani is on the western escarpment of the Rift Valley and the
train was beginning an ascent of several thousand feet when it
derailed, the agency said.
   The news agency quoted doctors and nurses at Londiani hospital
as saying many of the injured were in serious condition.
   It was the second major derailment of a Kenya Railways train in
less than a month. On April 5, a train carrying 672 passengers to
Malaba, near the Kenya-Uganda border, derailed and killed four
people.

   At least 13 people died in two bus crashes
Saturday during the May 1 holiday exodus, which was complicated by
a 72-hour national train strike, a transportation official said.
   Nine passengers died and 16 were seriously injured in a
bus-truck collision in Antequera, near the southern coastal city of
Malaga, said Pedro Fernandez, a spokesman for the Interior
Ministry's traffic department.
   He said a second accident bus-car crash near the south-central
city of Toledo killed four car passengers.
   A strike for higher pay by more than 50,000 employees of the
national rail system entered its third and final day Saturday,
forcing thousands of tourists to drive or take buses.
   Fernandez said the strike increased already intense traffic on
the six major national highways that extend from the capital to the
coastal regions.
   Railroad service was limited to long-distance trains between
Madrid and seven coastal cities and a single international train
between Barcelona and Geneva, Switzerland.

<HEAD>Police Arrests 2,200 in Bid to Block Labor Rally</HEAD>

   Police arrested about 2,200 workers
and students Saturday to block a planned labor rally, and the
government warned it may take emergency measures to end a wave of
strikes and labor unrest.
   About 20,000 riot police were deployed in Seoul to try to
prevent Sunday's rally, which was called by militant labor groups
to push for workers' rights and denounce the government of
President Roh Tae-woo. The government has declared the rally
illegal.
   About 2,000 radical students and workers gathered Saturday at
Yonsei University in eastern Seoul to prepare for the rally. Some
hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police, who responded with tear
gas grenades.
   In the southeastern port of Masan, about 2,000 strikers battled
riot police in the third straight day of street clashes, according
to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Police officials, who refused to be named, said about 2,200
workers and students were detained in Seoul to block Sunday's rally.
   Labor and dissident groups vowed to go ahead with the rally,
called to mark the May 1 international labor holiday. They claimed
up to 100,000 workers would take part, and trade union leaders
vowed the rally would be peaceful.
   Students and workers at Yonsei rallied throughout the day,
denouncing the Roh government and calling for creation of a new
government led by workers and peasants.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Free labor rights!'' protesters
yelled.
   The two main opposition parties, the Party for Peace and
Democracy and the Reunification Democratic Party, urged the
government to let workers hold rallies.
   The Reunification Democratic Party alleged that police had used
electric cattle prods to torture arrested strike leaders and
demanded a full investigation. Police denied the charge and
demanded an apology from the party.
   The government has warned that nationwide wave of strikes and
labor unrest are disrupting the economy and fomenting political
unrest. Senior officials said Saturday the government was studying
tough new measures to end the strikes, but the official refused to
give details.
   The chairman of the governing Democratic Justice Party, Park
Jyun-kyu, said the government may have to consider an emergency
decree giving Roh the power to take any necessary measures to end
unrest.
   ``If the problems are still not settled, declaration of a
presidential emergency decree should be seriously considered,'' he
said Friday.
   Many South Korean workers receive subsistence wages for very
long workweeks. A growing number are demanding wage increases,
better working conditions and a share in South Korea's growing
economic prosperity.
   The government says strikes have cost the country more than $3
billion in lost production this year. It is concerned about efforts
by radical students and dissidents to build a political alliance
with striking workers to challenge the Roh government.
   Roh has introduced broad reforms since he took office in
February 1988, but dissidents associate him with the authoritarian
regime of his predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan.
   In addition to Roh's ouster, radicals are demanding the
withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact. They say the troops prevent reunification with
communist North Korea.

   In the Mexican countryside, where land means
everything, there is constant tension over land rights and land
reform. Disputes and seizures frequently end in violence, as this
one did.

<TEXT>
   To peasants living in the folds of
Mexico's southern mountains, Sebastian Perez Nunez was a hero, the
leader of their struggle for a piece of land.
   To Roberto Zenteno Rojas, who wanted to build a ranching empire,
Perez was a bandit.
   As the sun dropped low on the Thursday after last Christmas,
their confict came to a violent end.
   Zenteno saw Perez in an old maroon pickup on the other side of
the pump at the only gas station in town, got out of his white
pickup-camper and fired at least 13 bullets into his enemy,
authorities say.
   Investigators said someone in the pickup fired back, but missed.
Perez died. Zenteno went into hiding.
   ``The struggle that flooded from one and the sick rage of the
other are accumulated expressions of the failure to find a solution
to the problems,'' said Gov. Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido of Chiapas
state, who knew both men.
   In remote southern Mexico, problems are rooted in land reform
and justice, which have routes as circuitous as the curling
mountain roads.
   Zenteno, 49, and Perez, 38, were born on farms in Bochil county
_ Zenteno on land his grandfather owned and Perez on the big Llano
Grande ranch where his father worked.
   Perez grew up speaking Tzotzil, an Indian language. After
finishing sixth grade in Bochil town, a two-hour walk from home, he
became a bilingual teacher.
   He looked for ways to help his fellow peasants, and the
foundation of his struggle became the land reform acts that emerged
from Mexico's revolution in 1910-1920.
   Those acts outlaw such large holdings as Llano Grande, and
peasants can petition the government to give the land to them.
   If the petition is granted, a peasant receives a grant called an
ejido. The land it covers can be used and passed on to children,
but not sold or rented out.
   Entangled as it is in bureaucracy, the process takes years, even
lifetimes.
   Investigations of old deeds, challenges by owners, and
conflicting previous decisions conspire with inefficiency to create
a legal labyrinth in the agrarian reform system. The cases are not
handled by courts.
   ``He started to see all the applications for ejidos that were
20, 30, 40 years old,'' said Perez's wife, Manuela, 34, who lived
with him since she was 14. ``The ones who first made the
application had already died.''
   ``He began to see that the government said there was no more
land, because land doesn't stretch ... but he saw there was still
land in the hands of caciques. They passed themselves off as small
property owners but they had a great deal of land.''
   The peasants saw Zenteno as a cacique, or rural boss _ a man
with land, wealth and clout.
   Zenteno had run the family ranch since he dropped out of school
in the sixth grade when his father fell ill. He raised cattle and
sold smaller tracts of land to buy bigger, better ones like the
Santo Domingo ranch, putting some in the names of his children.
   He had houses on Santo Domingo, in Bochil, where he served a
term as mayor, and in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state capital.
   Perez started working for the peasants in 1980. About 35 tracts
of 250-750 acres were turned into ejidos through his efforts.
   Posters from his unsuccessful campaign for a federal Senate seat
on the Socialist Party ticket last summer show him with a droopy
mustache and beard. He had just finished a term in the state
legislature.
   Perez spent his last year on an ejido called Las Granjas with
Manuela and their three daughters. They lived in a rundown
two-story main house whose columned porch, now-dry swimming pool
and palm-lined drive recall more opulent days.
   Zenteno and Perez came to grips in 1986 when peasants petitioned
for Santo Domingo, the Zenteno family's prize holding, and two
other tracts totaling about 1,000 acres.
   Gonzalez, the governor, says the holdings were within legal
limits, which vary depending on land use, availability of water and
other factors.
   The peasants disagreed and conducted a ``recovery,'' putting up
shacks and planting crops while they awaited a decision. Zenteno
and other ranchers called it an invasion.
   ``They looted, they stole what they found and left,'' said the
eldest of Zenteno's five children, Roberto. ``We had to be ready
for this every week or two.''
   Another son, Eduardo, was wounded two years ago in an ambush the
family blames on Perez.
   At the time of his death, Perez was named in 27 warrants on
robbery and other charges stemming from takeovers. Gov. Gonzalez
said landowners often fabricate charges against peasant leaders.
   On Dec. 11, the younger Roberto Zenteno said, peasants took
corn, some fighting cocks and sheep. Four bulls disappeared and
squatters invaded the main house.
   ``We exhausted all the resources,'' said his brother Marco
Antonio, a lawyer. ``We knocked door to door on the government
offices. We felt impotent.''
   Authorities ran campesinos off the ranch twice, and the Zentenos
sometimes did it themselves.
   Manuela Perez remembers sadness at Christmas. An anonymous
letter had wished her husband and other peasant leaders ``A Bitter
Christmas and Sad New Year.''
   On Thursday, Dec. 29, station attendants told authorities,
Zenteno was getting gas when Perez arrived in the pickup with his
wife and two other people. An attendant began filling the maroon
truck, they said, and Zenteno started shooting.
   An autopsy revealed 13 bullets in her husband's body, fired from
close range.
   Investigators said three shots came from the pickup. Paraffin
tests indicated Perez had fired a weapon, but none was found.
   A small, gray wooden cross marks the grave, the name lettered in
black by hand.
   Zenteno is wanted for homicide. Maybe he thought he could get
away with it.
   ``Tradition in Chiapas has been that a crime is committed and in
six months is forgotten or you have the guarantee justice isn't
going to function,'' Gonzalez observed in an interview. He said he
is changing that.

   As the Soviet Union and China prepare for their
first summit in 30 years, Mikhail Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping could
look to their border for lessons in getting along. A frontier
region that once bristled with soldiers now bustles with trade.

<TEXT>
   It began with 200 tons of
watermelons the Chinese feared would rot. They ran a white flag up
a watchtower and invited Soviet soldiers on the other bank of the
blue-gray Amur River to a meeting.
   The KGB border guards went, then reported back to officials in
this Siberian city 3,500 miles east of Moscow that the Chinese
wanted to deal.
   After some discussion, Blagoveshchensk authorities dispatched a
barge to pick up the melons, giving the Chinese a load of
fertilizer in exchange.
   That modest barter arrangement in 1987 began trade between the
Soviet Union's Amur Region and the neighboring Chinese province of
Heilongjiang that grew to the equivalent of $81 million last year.
   Russians in Blagoveshchensk, a boom town of the 19th century
gold rush, once worried about the Chinese coming. Now they want
them to.
   In the 1960s, when ideological and border disputes poisoned
Soviet-Chinese relations, huge portraits of Mao Tse-tung sprouted
on the shore in Heihe, the city half a mile away across the Amur.
   Chinese tanks and military vehicles maneuvered on the ice-bound
river and Mao's frontier troops even bared their buttocks to mock
Soviet soldiers, recalled Capt. Alexander M. Kirushin, commander of
the 50 border guards in Blagoveshchensk.
   ``We were frightened and ready to evacuate,'' said Irina
Alexandreyeva, 62, then a nurse in this city of 210,000. ``We were
prepared for anything. The Chinese could have crossed.''
   Now, government and business leaders in Blagoveshchensk court
workers, investors and potential trading partners on the other side
of the Amur in an effort to end chronic shortages of goods and spur
the local economy.
   Vladimir Vechinkin said: ``In our region, there's no way to
avoid external economic relations. We border on our great neighbor,
the People's Republic of China.''
   He is first deputy chairman of government in the Amur Region, an
area the size of Montana where slightly more than 1 million people
live.
   As the May 15 summit approaches, Soviet officials describe
Blagoveshchensk as a showcase for the advantages of better
relations.
   It is an atypical example.
   Border trade totaled $146 million last year, according to the
Soviet Foreign Trade Ministry. That means trade in this area
accounted for more than half the commerce along the 5,000-mile
frontier.
   Changes wrought by it are graphic in Blagoveshchensk, where the
Chinese have arrived and more are on the way.
   On the fifth floor of what someday will be the Tourist Hotel,
Chinese workers slather mortar onto tiles. It's part of a $12
million contract for painting, tiling and performing other work on
three building sites awarded last year to a Heihe construction firm.
   When the Tourist Hotel opens, Blagoveshchensk will have its
first Chinese restaurant.
   ``We need to increase construction threefold by the year 2000
and build 64 new enterprises, but we have a shortage of building
trade specialists,'' said Anatoly S. Lagutin, chief of the regional
construction organization Amurstroi. ``The Chinese have the
specialists and a talent for manual work.''
   They also come cheap: each of the 100 Chinese working in
Blagoveshchensk earns the equivalent of $4.50 a day, about
one-fourth the average Soviet industrial wage. They also get free
housing in an Amurstroi dormitory and are fed by a Chinese chef at
Soviet expense.
   Classrooms at Middle School No. 14 are filled with the voices of
Russian children singing songs or reciting verse in Mandarin.
   It is a modest demonstration of interest in Chinese culture when
compared with instruction in other foreign languages _ English is
taught in hundreds of Blagoveshchensk schools _ but Principal
Albina N. Dimnich expects to hire two more Chinese teachers this
year.
   ``All parents of my pupils tell their kids: Study hard, and
maybe in the future you'll become a specialist in Chinese and help
develop relations between our countries,'' said Alexander Trukhin,
a language teacher at School No. 14.
   The school also provides a lesson in how difficult
Soviet-Chinese relations have been. A hallway poster exhorts Soviet
youngsters to vigilance, proclaiming: ``Remember, the border is
next door.''
   For consumers in Blagoveshchensk, better relations have meant
the availability of cigarette lighters, video and audio cassettes,
umbrellas, thermos bottles and other Chinese-made goods. Supplies
are erratic, however, and prices can be high.
   Trukhin, 22, paid $250, nearly a month's salary, to buy a denim
jacket from a Chinese construction worker.
   Generally, the feeling is optimistic.
   ``We're at the very beginning in developing our trade with
China,'' said Vechinkin, the government official. He expects the
summit to improve Soviet-Chinese relations and the climate for
trade.
   The Soviets have offered to sell 100 million kilowatt hours of
electricity to the Chinese starting next year, and officials from
both countries have agreed to build a hydroelectric station on the
Amur.
   In May, a 30-channel radiotelephone will go into service,
enabling people in Blagoveshchensk and Heihe to talk to each other.
   ``It's very difficult to have commercial ties if you can't talk
to your partners,'' Vechinkin said.

   A British Boeing 737 carrying 103
people made an emergency landing in Goteborg after a warning light
indicated one of its engines caught fire shortly after takeoff, an
airport official said today.
   After the plane landed safely, the crew discovered the warning
light had malfunctioned and there was no fire in one of the right
engines.
   The pilot of the Air UK Leisure Ltd. airliner reported the fire
moments after departing from Helsinki, Finland, for London, said Bo
Hansson, an official at the airport in Goteborg, 280 miles
southwest of Stockholm.
   The crew activated fire extinguishers in the engine, but the
warning light remained on, Hansson said.
   ``The pilot demanded permission to land at the nearest airfield,
which was Landvetter in Goteborg,'' he said. ``The landing was
successful and the passengers were never exposed to any danger.''
   Mechanics found nothing wrong with the aircraft's engine,
refilled its fire extinguishers, and the aircraft later resumed its
flight to London with its 95 passengers and eight-member crew,
Hansson said.

   Representatives of the flight attendants' unions denounced the

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle marked
his first 100 days in office Saturday in Australia, clearly
enjoying his role as roving ambassador for the Bush administration.
   U.S. Ambassador Bill Lane said the vice president has a lot in
common with the Australian people: He's likeable and he's outgoing.
   And, he's crazy about sports, particularly golf. Quayle squeezed
in a last-minute round at this lush resort in the country's
northeast quarter Saturday.
   Whether sipping beer at a pub in Sydney, batting balls at the
Australian National Tennis Center in Melbourne, or climbing up to a
giant NASA satellite dish near Canberra, Quayle clearly was
enjoying himself Down Under.
   What he admired about the Australians, Quayle said, was their
``directness,'' their ``candor,'' and the fact they called him
``Dan.''
   After 100 days in office, the vice president says one of the
best things about his new job is the foreign travel.
   But he might have to scale back on overseas trips this summer,
he said, because of pressing business in Congress.
   ``I do enjoy the foreign travel. And I do enjoy carrying
messages for the president; gaining information from the people and
the countries that I'll be visiting because it will be very
valuable information as we contemplate the policies that will be
enacted during the Bush administration,'' Quayle told an audience
of mainly Australian reporters at a press conference in Canberra.
   For Quayle and his staff, the real test here was whether he
could negotiate his second foreign trip without committing blunders
that might recall the uncertainties about his qualifications that
were raised by opponents in last fall's presidential campaign.
   Quayle, who has taken to making self-deprecating jokes about
himself to defuse criticism in a way that Ronald Reagan used to
make fun of his age, realized the challenge, even on this
relatively risk-free diplomatic mission.
   ``I appreciate the introduction and also the lunch, particularly
the quail eggs,'' he said at his first press conference.
   ``You have your story already written; `The Press had Quayle for
lunch,''' he joked.
   With the exception of a couple of gaffes _ he once referred to
Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, where he stopped over
briefly, as ``Pogo Pogo,'' and a diplomatic spat over grain exports
_ Quayle's trip is going according to the script.
   Asked Saturday by one Australian reporter about what he had
accomplished on his trip, Quayle said he had some ``tough, candid''
talks with Australian leaders.
   More importantly, he said he learned about the issues facing
Australia and established a rapport with many of the country's
younger politicians.
   Officially, Quayle was President Bush's representative at the
Australian-American Friendship Week, which commemorates the Allied
cooperation in World War II and the battle of Coral Sea.
   While Bush was a decorated fighter pilot shot down in the
Pacific theater, Quayle wasn't even born until two years after the
war ended, a fact he addressed several times.
   But the 42-year-old Quayle said, ``I believe that this
generation _ my generation _ is very dedicated and understands the
importance of maintaining freedom and maintaining a posture of
peace.''
   From the Australians' point of view, the big news was Quayle's
insistence that U.S. subsidies on wheat exports are not detrimental
to Australian wheat exports abroad.
   Rick Farley, executive director of the National Farmers'
Federation, called that view an insult to his countrymen.
   Australians claim their share of the overseas markets have been
hurt by price supports.
   Quayle said he was ready for the Australians' reaction, but a
top aide, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the vice
president and his aides were surprised by the sharpness of the
attacks.
   But those attacks may have been good preparation for Quayle, who
has said there are some thorny diplomatic issues he'll confront
when he visits Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand on the next leg of
his 12-day journey.

   Soviet citizens are increasingly fleeing the farms
for a better life in the already strapped cities, a troublesome
trend that threatens to worsen the country's economic problems,
officials said Saturday.
   The Soviet population climbed 9.3 percent during the past decade
and now stands at 286.7 million, with the largest increases in the
central Asian regions, according to census figures published
Saturday.
   A top Soviet statistician expressed concern the population had
not increased faster _ which he said was necessary to ensure
greater economic development _ and that growth rates were low in
European regions.
   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, devoted an entire page to
preliminary results of the nationwide census conducted in January,
the country's first since 1979.
   The demographic center of the Soviet Union is gradually shifting
from the European Slavic heartland _ the Russian federation, the
Ukraine and Byelorussia _ to Central Asia, according to data from
the State Committee on Statistics.
   Those numbers represent troublesome trends for the Soviet
leadership, which has been trying to keep the country's peasantry
on the farm and has acknowledged it cannot create jobs fast enough
in Central Asia to keep pace with population growth.
   The total number of Soviets grew by 24.3 million in the past 10
years and stood at 286.7 million Jan. 12. That represents a growth
of 9.3 percent since 1979.
   Four traditionally Moslem republics in Soviet Central Asia
registered the greatest population increases: a 34 percent rise in
Tadzhikistan, 29 percent in Uzbekistan, 28 percent in Turkmenia and
22 percent in Kirghizia.
   Azerbaijan, the only predominantly Moslem republic in the Soviet
Caucasus, had a 17 percent increase in population, and in the fifth
Central Asian republic, Kazakhstan, the number of people rose 13
percent.
   Population growth in the rest of the country did not exceed 10
percent.
   ``The scope of the development of the Soviet economy and the
need for additional manpower resources to develop economically
promising areas call for greater population growth,'' Nikolai
Belov, State Statistics Committee deputy chairman, told the
official Tass news agency. ``This especially concerns some regions,
above all in the European part of the country and in the Far East.''
   The Russian federation, the largest of the 15 constituent Soviet
republics, remains the most populated with 147.4 million
inhabitants, but its population grew by only 7 percent.
   The Ukraine remains second with 51.7 million people, but the
increase only was 4 percent. In Byelorussia, the population rose 7
percent.
   In the past decade, the Soviet rural population dropped 38
percent, to 34 percent of the total.
   However, Tass said, high population growth rates were registered
in Central Asia's rural regions, ``as a result of which there
emerged the problem of the able-bodied population's employment in
the countryside.''
   A total of 10.6 million Soviets migrated from villages to
cities, and the country's urban population grew by 25.2 million, or
15 percent, Tass said in a dispatch summarizing census results.
   That would aggravate an already serious housing problem. One of
every five urban residents in the Soviet Union lives in dormitories
or in communal apartments with common kitchens, bathrooms and other
facilities.
   As a result of the flight from the countryside to the cities,
there are now ``far more men'' aged 18-29 than women living in the
rural regions of most Soviet republics, Tass said. ``Given such a
ratio, not all men can marry,'' it said.

<HEAD>Japanese Prime Minister Begins Asian Tour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of
Japan arrived in Thailand on Saturday to begin a nine-day southeast
Asian tour, likely to be his last as Japan's premier.
   Takeshita, who has said he will resign soon because of an
influence-peddling scandal that has tainted his government, was
greeted by his Thai counterpart, Chatichai Choonhavan.
   Takeshita said he went ahead with the trip, despite his imminent
departure, to ``maintain continuity'' in Japan's foreign policy.
Japan is responding to mounting calls for economic assistance from
developing countries in Southeast Asia.
   Takeshita also will visit Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Philippines, which together with Thailand and Brunei form the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, with which Japan has strong
ties.
   ``On this current trip, I hope to further deepen and broaden
Japan's relations with ASEAN as well as our bilateral relations
with the individual ASEAN countries,'' Takeshita said in an arrival
statement. He said cooperative relations between Japan and Thailand
had grown by ``leaps and bounds.''
   The Japanese leader is scheduled to hold talks with Chatichai
and meet with King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thailand's constitutional
monarch, on Monday. On Sunday he is scheduled to meet with visiting
Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk. He leaves for
Malaysia on Tuesday.
   Sihanouk heads a three-party coalition fighting the
Vietnamese-backed government in Phnom Penh.
   The conflict in Cambodia, Thailand's mounting trade deficit with
Japan, and lack of Thai access to the Japanese market are expected
to be discussed here.
   Takeshita announced Tuesday he would resign to take
responsibility for a scandal involving the Recruit Co., an
information and publishing conglomerate that prosecutors say sold
unlisted stocks at bargain prices to scores of political and
business figures.
   The buyers profited handsomely when the stock went public,
authorities say.
   The scandal has dominated Japanese politics for months.
Takeshita said he would step down after Japan's new budget takes
effect.
   The governing party forced the budget through the lower house of
Parliament on Friday. If the less powerful upper house does not
reject it, the budget takes effect May 27.

<HEAD>A Year Later, Wright's Fortunes Falling, Gingrich's Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a year ago, House Speaker Jim Wright
confidently asked the ethics committee to quickly dispose of a list
of charges hurled by a pesky conservative, Rep. Newt Gingrich.
   The process has been anything but quick. Wright's fortunes have
fallen as Gingrich's have risen, and the speaker's supporters now
find themselves attacking the same investigators they once
encouraged.
   Since filing the ethics charges, Gingrich has been elevated to
minority whip, the No. 2 GOP leadership post in the House.
   Soon, probably within the month, Wright, the nation's highest
elected Democrat, is likely to go on trial before the ethics
committee. There, Wright will have his first chance to publicly lay
out his defense against charges that he violated House rules 69
times over the past decade.
   A tough Chicago lawyer, Richard Phelan, will act as the
prosecutor. It was Phelan who led the ethics committee's long, $1.5
million investigation that turned over virtually every stone in
Wright's 40-year political career.
   Wright's defense will rely on a team of lawyers, likely to be
announced this week, who will seek to pick apart the legal ground
on which Phelan has built his case and cut down witnesses called to
testify against Wright.
   In addition to Wright's current lawyer, William Oldaker, the
team may include such symbols of respect as Democratic patriarch
Clark Clifford, and perhaps a hard-nosed trial lawyer like Richard
Ben-Veniste, who was an assistant prosecutor in the Watergate case.
   But in another sense, the defense already has begun. Wright's
supporters, chiefly members of the Texas congressional delegation,
have surrounded the speaker and are playing hardball politics with
anyone seen as an enemy.
   Asked what he would advise two ethics committee Democrats _ Chet
Atkins of Massachusetts and Bernard Dwyer of New Jersey, who voted
against Wright on a key issue in committee _ Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas, replied, ``Pray.''
   ``They are rumps in and horns out,'' said Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., alluding to what she termed a different sort of
behavioral standard shared by Texans. ``Being from Texas means
never having to say you're sorry.''
   While it will give him an opportunity to mount a point-by-point
defense, the trial also is likely to be politically painful to the
speaker. Ethics committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the
proceeding probably would be open to the public, and the major
television networks are pressing for a waiver of committee rules to
open the event to cameras _ something Wright's supporters fear.
   ``We think it's in the public interest,'' said Barbara Cohen,
chief of the CBS News Washington bureau and head of a network
``pool'' that handles matters of mutual concern to the
broadcasters. ``We certainly would be doing stories on the nightly
news, and would like to use the speaker's own words.''
   Wright's strategy with his colleagues is to align himself with
them and the institution, admitting personal flaws but appealing to
the pressures all lawmakers feel: conflicts between friendships and
public responsibilities, financial constraints, loyalty to the
House.
   At the same time, Wright and his lieutenants have sought to
paint Phelan as an overzealous outsider who is trying to
single-handedly rewrite the institution's own rules and who has
somehow conned the ethics committee into agreeing with him. Brooks
referred to Phelan in a television interview as ``an assassin.''
   But some members in both parties view the effort to isolate
Phelan as risky and with the potential to backfire. One Midwestern
Democrat notes that Wright himself publicly welcomed the
appointment of Phelan, an active Democrat, last July.
   Others, both Democrats and Republicans, say the ethics committee
enjoys a high level of credibility in the House and that lawmakers
will probably accept whatever verdict the committee returns.
   ``The defense the speaker has put together is absolutely
reprehensible,'' says Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., a close ally of
Gingrich and a leading GOP spokesman on the Wright case.
   ``It will not serve them well and it doesn't reflect well on the
people around him. Their strategy is basically to commit Democratic
members to his exoneration before they have seen the evidence, and
to attempt to discredit and intimidate the ethics committee.''
   Noting comments like Brooks' advice to the ethics committee
Democrats who voted against Wright, Weber added, ``These are not
random, off-the-cuff remarks. These are top-level, powerful
Democrats who are close to the speaker. These are threats from the
speaker of the House.''
   Between now and Wright's trial, there also is the likelihood of
continued revelations about his business dealings. The ethics
committee is scheduled to interview a group of Texas businessmen on
Wednesday and Thursday who were participants in a gas well venture
that yielded huge profits for Wright's blind trust last year.
   And last week it was revealed that Wright failed for four years
to pay $8,000 owed for a corporate jet he and others used in 1985
for political fund-raising. The bill was paid Tuesday, only after
the plane's owner got wind that a reporter for the Wall Street
Journal had found out about the incident, which would have amounted
to an illegal and unreported campaign contribution.

   NASA said today it will not try to
launch space shuttle Atlantis and the robot probe targeted for
Venus until a fuel pump problem and leaking fuel line are corrected
on the space shuttle and ``we don't know when we can go.''
   Sources close to the program reported earlier that the
postponement could be at least 10 days, but later said that was
based on a preliminary assessment. They said the delay will be
several days and possibly could stretch to a week or more if
technicians have to replace both the pump and the fuel line.
   NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone said NASA officials are evaluating
the problems today and have assigned committees to study each
element. She reports from those committees will be made on Sunday.
   ``We don't know when we can go,'' said Malone. ``It depends on
where the troubleshooting takes us.''
   A launch countdown was stopped Friday with just 31 seconds left
after controllers detected an electrical power surge in a main
engine fuel pump. Later, engineers found leak in a hydrogen fuel
line.
   Atlantis is to carry into space a robot probe called Magellan
which is to fly to the planet Venus in a resumption of America's
exploration of the solar system after an 11-year gap.
   Earlier, Robert Sieck, the Kennedy Space Center launch director,
said technicians would remove panels of the engine compartment to
get at the pump.
   The leaky hydrogen line, which spewed a cloud of vapor toward
the end of the countdown, also must be repaired, Sieck said.
Engineers believe the vapor escaped through a pinhole in a fitting.
   The technicians worked through the night to drain a half million
gallons of oxygen and hydrogen rocket fuel from Atlantis. They then
planned to install scaffolding at the base of the spacecraft and
remove panels covering the engine compartment.
   NASA spokesman George Diller said engineers should be able to
examine the faulty pump by tonight. Only then can it be determined
how the problem will be corrected. The experts looked at the leaky
hydrogen line this morning, but were still undecided on what
repairs were needed for that problem, he said.
   If either the pump or the hydrogen line have to be replaced, the
launch could be postponed until ``well into next week,'' Sieck said.
   Atlantis couldn't be launched before Monday at the earliest
because of the two problems, he said.
   ``Both of them would have to fall into a quick fix and it would
be optimistic to expect that,'' Sieck said.
   Among tens of thousands who had gathered for the planned rare
afternoon liftoff were prominent planetary scientists who have been
waiting to resume solar system exploration since 1978, when
Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last U.S. planetary expedition.
   ``We have waited a number of years for this flight, and a few
extra days won't matter,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief
scientist. ``The window is a month long. Having the shuttle ready
on the first day is ample time to solve the problem and get us on
our way to Venus.''
   ``That's just the way it is,'' said James Head, a geologist from
Brown University.
   The space agency must send the Magellan probe on its way by May
28 to take advantage of the proper alignment between Earth and
Venus. If NASA can't meet that deadline, officials would have to
wait two years before the two planets again are in the desired
position.
   After the scrub was announced, the astronauts climbed out of the
spaceship in their bright orange launch suits and were taken back
to the crew quarters for a late lunch.
   The crew includes commander David Walker, along with pilot
Ronald J. Grabe, Mary L. Cleave, Norman E. Thagard and Mark C. Lee.
   Sieck said the preparations seemed ``picture perfect'' until 20
minutes before launch.
   A computer malfunction was quickly fixed and the count resumed
after a six-minute delay. Then, with fewer than 50 seconds left on
the clock, an engineer in the launch control room told Sieck,
``Possible problem with an engine 1 recirculation pump ...
recommend hold at T-minus 31.''
   The countdown was stopped.
   ``It just wasn't our day,'' Sieck said. He fretted out loud that
the weather, perfect on Friday, would likely be less ideal next
week.
   After it is released from Atlantis' cargo bay, Magellan will
rocket itself onto a 15-month, 806 million-mile path toward Venus,
the Earth's nearest planetary neighbor.
   The explorer craft will spend eight months orbiting Venus and
mapping about 90 percent of the planet surface using a
sophisticated radar system.
   Venus is a cloud-shrouded world that has always intrigued
scientists because it is about the size of Earth, but lacks any of
the conditions that make life on this planet possible.

<HEAD>Drug Cult Killings Cast Pall of Fear, Superstition Over Rio Grande
Valley</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attendance has soared at this city's
Roman Catholic cathedral as unease and superstition haunt the
border valley where authorities say 15 people were ritually
murdered by a drug smuggling cult.
   Parents here and across the Rio Grande in Brownsville, Texas,
keep closer watch on their children. An ecumenical prayer service
scheduled for Sunday in Brownsville is billed in fliers as intended
to ``heal our land.''
   And police, in a puzzling action most witnesses refused to
discuss, burned down the blood-splattered shack at a ranch where
four suspects say the gang practiced human sacrifice in hopes of
protecting their drug trafficking.
   ``Now, people are saying, yes, evil exists,'' said the Rev.
Ruperto Ayala Espinoza, a priest at Our Lady of Refuge, the
Catholic cathedral that towers over Matamoros' main plaza.
   The priest said there has been a marked increase in attendance
at services, communion and confession since the first 12 bodies
were exhumed at Santa Elena ranch April 11.
   ``People who may have been indifferent toward the church have
moved closer to the church,'' he said.
   He said many parents no longer leave their children unattended
or let them walk to and from school, out of fear of the
``narcosatanicos'' _ a term coined by Mexican newspapers to
describe the cult members.
   Investigators believe that only a few of the victims were
sacrifices and that the others were killed in retaliation for
soured drug deals.
   The prevalence of traditional Mexican mystic healers and herb
shops selling magic paraphernalia moved the population to take
seriously the threat of occult sacrifices, said the priest.
   ``Here, there's a lot of belief in witchcraft, spells,
superstition,'' said Ayala, whose church denounces such practices.
   At Texas Southmost College in Brownsville last week, three days
of seminars on the occult and Satanism _ scheduled before the 15
bodies were discovered _ had to be moved to larger rooms because of
overflow attendance.
   Investigators say the ranch sacrifice did not involve Satanism
but a deviant form of the Afro-Cuban religion Palo Mayombe, known
for using human body parts in its rituals.
   Nelda San Roman, 27, of Brownsville, who attended one of the
seminars, said it does not matter what name the evil practices go
by.
   ``They all add up to the same thing,'' she said. ``The devil is
behind it, no matter what you call it.''
   At the Santa Elena ranch last Sunday, Mexican and U.S. police
watched the incineration of the wooden shack where the cult held
bloody rituals.
   Nearly two weeks after the first bodies were exhumed in a field
next to the shack, police had photographed the area but left in
place evidence including cauldrons of human brains, blood, sticks,
goats' heads and a mutilated rooster.
   Police would not discuss reasons for the shack burning. The only
U.S. journalist present was Frank Ordonez, a Brownsville Herald
photographer. Upon arriving, he said, he saw a man circling the
shack. He said Sheriff's Lt. George Gavito of Brownsville told him
the man was performing an exorcism.
   The man went inside the shack and made some hand gestures before
his face, then the sign of the cross, before torching the building,
Ordonez said.
   ``While it was burning, he threw bags of white powder on the
fire,'' he said.
   Gavito said Wednesday there was no purification exercise. He
said a man ``threw something, but I don't know what it was. It
might have been something for the smell.''
   One witness, who would not be identified, said the powder was
salt. In ``white magic,'' salt often is used to drive out evil,
Ayala Espinoza said.
   Tony Zavaleta, an anthropologist at the college who specializes
in Mexican folk beliefs, videotaped the burning but refused to
discuss what took place.
   ``When I stepped on that ranch last week for the first time ...
to me in my mind, there was a feeling of evil,'' Zavaleta said. ``I
could just feel it. After it was burned, I felt better about it.''
   Zavaleta, who also is a Brownsville city commissioner, said two
of the suspects had taken his classes.
   ``I asked myself if there are any other mass-murderers in my
classes,'' he said. ``I'm a little bit paranoid whether I should
speak frankly about these things with the students or worry about
finding someone waiting for me out in the parking lot.''

<HEAD>Voters May Decide Death Penalty Abolition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers on this popular resort island
have decided to keep the death penalty for now, but residents
eventually may have the final say.
   The House of Assenbly voted 19-19 to retain capital punishment
for premeditated murder, with the speaker of the house casting the
deciding vote in favor.
   Despite the vote, the governing United Bermuda Party of Premier
John Swan is still considering whether to put the matter to a
national referendum. Britain, of which Bermuda is a colony,
abolished the death penalty in 1965.
   ``We will now discuss the matter in the party caucus,'' Swan
said after Friday's vote. ``We feel the public should have a say
before any moves for abolition.''
   Swan raised the possibility of a referendum on March 31, 10 days
after Bermuda's governor, Sir Desmond Langley, stayed the hanging
of Troy Dean Shorter.
   Shorter was convicted of first-degree murder in the slaying of
shopkeeper Roger Redman. He had exhausted all appeals when Langley
exercised his right to commute death sentences to terms of life
imprisonment.
   The stay of execution was strongly protested.
   The legislative debate over capital punishment also has delayed
the opening of another murder trial, that of 29-year-old
businessman Leroy Alvin Dunlop. Dunlop is accused of the July 10
slayings of his girlfriend and her two daughters.
   Bermuda uses hanging to execute murderers. The last time the
gallows were used was Dec. 2, 1977, when murderers Larry Tacklyn
and Buck Burrows were hanged.
   The double hanging led to widespread civil unrest and the
arrival of British troops to quell riots.

   ``Remember May Fourth'' has become the rallying
cry of Beijing students who have swept past police barricades to
march for democracy and clean government the past two weeks.
   The date is as emotionally stirring to intellectual Chinese as
1776 is to Americans or Bastille Day to the French.
   It is the day in 1919 that Beijing University students launched
a campaign for science and democracy, showing intellectuals for the
first time their power to lead the masses and affect policy.
   Even before the April 15 death of a reformist official triggered
the new protests, students were counting the days to celebrate the
70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement.
   Now, after having marched repeatedly on central Beijing's
Tiananmen Square and staged the largest protests in 40 years of
communist rule, many students are studying the history of the
movement to learn from its strategy.
   ``It was China's Enlightenment,'' said one student marcher,
referring to the 18th century science and democracy movement in the
West that gave rise to the American and French revolutions.
   ``May Fourth divided Chinese history into two parts _ what came
before and everything afterward,'' the student said. ``What we are
doing now is a continuation of May Fourth.''
   The May Fourth Movement began with student anger over the
Versailles Treaty that ended World War I. China's warlord
government agreed to treaty clauses that endorsed Japan's seizure
of parts of China during the war.
   More than 3,000 students from 13 Beijing schools, led by China's
most prestigious school, Beijing University, gathered May 4, 1919,
at the Tiananmen gate to the former imperial palace.
   They signed a manifesto denouncing the treaty, burned the house
of a government official and beat another as a ``traitor.''
   Protests spread to other cities and were supported by
newspapers, worker strikes and boycotts of Japanese-made goods. The
government quickly backed down and rejected the Versailles Treaty,
but the protests did not stop.
   Galvanized by their new sense of power, the students then
demanded sweeping democratic reforms and adoption of Western
scientific thinking. China's traditional culture made it weak and
ripe for foreign invasion, the students argued.
   The movement trained a generation of intellectuals in political
activism. Many went on to support the communists in the civil war
that ended in 1949 with communist victory.
   ``But for the May Fourth Movement, there would have been no
Chinese revolution,'' He Xin, a scholar, said at one of a series of
symposiums being held in China to commemorate the anniversary.
   The official symposiums have been careful to stress that
protests may have been appropriate then, but not now.
   However, student protesters and older intellectuals say they are
angry that so little progress toward establishing a democratic,
scientific system has been made.
   ``Seventy Years,'' lamented one banner carried in Thursday's
march by 150,000 students and supporters on Tiananmen, the symbolic
seat of power in China and rallying place for protesters.
   ``We haven't yet achieved the society we hoped for,'' said
88-year-old Bing Xin, one of modern China's leading writers and a
participant in the original May Fourth Movement.
   ``We can speak out, but our words have little effect. We are not
yet satisfied,'' she said in a rare interview. ``The rule of man is
still more important than rule of law.''
   Bing Xin said the 1919 movement won widespread support because
it had a popular goal _ opposing Japanese imperialism _ as well as
the vaguer slogans of science and democracy. ``Those were new words
in China, and many people didn't know what they meant,'' she said.
   In a country where one-quarter of the population is illiterate,
many people today still don't understand the student calls for
science and democracy.
   But they understand the students' protests of official
privilege, nepotism and profiteering. Thousands of workers joined
Thursday's march, and many cited corruption as the reason.
   Officials ``turn public funds into their own private wealth,''
fumed one taxi driver. ``Of course I support the students.''
   Out-of-uniform soldiers and police also have expressed sympathy,
and some have sent letters of support to Beijing University
students.
   However, today's students are finding it harder than in 1919 to
turn this silent support into action, in part because of government
control over jobs, housing and other necessities.
   ``I can't just find another job, and I depend on my work unit
for housing and my child's education,'' said one worker.
   Older intellectuals also are fearful of showing support. Many
have been jailed, criticized or sent to the countryside during past
leftist campaigns.
   But perhaps the strongest factor discouraging protests from
spreading to all sectors of society, as in 1919, is a deep yearning
among most Chinese for peace.
   Memories are vivid of the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural
Revolution, Mao Tse-tung's final effort to perpetuate class
struggle. Thousands of people were killed and tens of thousands
suffered.
   One university teacher who applauded the students said it is
this memory that keeps him from marching. ``In my heart, I don't
want another Cultural Revolution.''

<HEAD>Mourners Sing ``You'll Never Walk Alone'' For 95 Soccer Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of mourners sang the
Liverpool soccer team's anthem, ``You'll Never Walk Alone,'' and
lit 95 candles during a memorial service Saturday for fans who died
in Britain's worst sporting tragedy.
   Liverpool's Anglican cathedral was decorated with a huge
Liverpool banner and wreaths in the team's red and white colors as
this soccer-mad city paid its final tribute to the 95 fans trampled
or crushed to death at an April 15 match. Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, the Duke and Duchess of Kent, politicians, soccer
officials and Liverpool players joined members of bereaved families
and 450 injured fans at the hour-long service, attended by about
2,000 people.
   Outside the cathedral, about 800 people watched on a giant TV
screen. Millions watched the nationally televised service at home.
   A choir of young boys sang as white candles were lit for each of
the 95 victims who died at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield during
a Football Association Cup semifinal. A red remembrance book with
their names was placed on the altar.
   ``They went to see a match on a bright spring day, never
dreaming they were to enter the valley of the shadow of death,''
the Rev. Dr. John Newton said in the sermon.
   He pleaded for greater safety for soccer fans.
   ``Please God, a new pattern of football, safe for all
spectators, will be part of their memorial too,'' he said.
   There were prayers and blessings from Liverpool clergy,
Archbishop of York John Habgood and finally Cardinal Basil Hume,
the Archbishop of Westminster, after which the congregation fell
silent.
   The silence was broken by the soprano voice of 12-year-old
Martin Polglaise, a Liverpool fan and choirboy, singing ``You'll
Never Walk Alone,'' which Liverpool supporters have sung for three
decades to inspire the players to victory.
   The congregation rose, joining in the refrain, many wiping tears
from their eyes.
   The dignitaries then filed outside where the Dean of Liverpool,
the Very Rev. Derrick Walters, hallowed the Hillsborough Memorial
Stone, set in the pavement just in front of the cathedral. Made of
red sandstone, its gold inscription reads: ``Hillsborough, April
15, 1989, You'll Never Walk Alone.''
   Wreaths were laid by the prime minister, the Duke and Duchess of
Kent, and other political and civic leaders. Queen Elizabeth II,
who was criticized by some local officials for not attending, sent
a wreath and a message of sympathy that was printed inside the
service program.

<HEAD>Chemical Union Sues to Stop Mobil Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The black chemical workers
union has filed suit to stop the sale of Mobil Corp. assets in
South Africa until it negotiates a disinvestment procedure, the
union said Saturday.
   The suit was filed Friday but a hearing was postponed until May
9, said Taffy Adler, a spokesman for the Chemical Workers
Industrial Union, which represents 1,200 of Mobil's 1,500 South
African black workers.
   Mobil Corp., which has done business in South Africa for 90
years, announced Friday it was leaving the racially-divided nation.
   The oil giant said it was selling operations once valued at more
than $400 million to General Mining Union Corp. Ltd. for more than
$155 million in cash and $10 million that was expected to be the
operation's 1989 profit.
   ``Far from being moral or politically progressive, Mobil has
seriously disadvantaged its work force by selling to one of the
most notoriously anti-union South African corporations,'' the union
communique said.
   The union said company officials earlier told them they had no
intention of selling South African operations and promised to
discuss withdrawal procedures with the union ``if it becomes an
issue.''
   ``The most recent refusal by Mobil to negotiate because
`disinvestment is not an issue' is in a letter dated Feb. 13
1989,'' the union said. ``It is inconceivable that Mobil had not
begun the process which would lead to disinvestment from South
Africa.''
   Recently, the union approached foreign companies, including
Mobil, with demands in the event of a sellout.
   Among the requests were a 12-month advance notice and guarantees
of job security. In the Mobil case, the union has also said it
wants details of the sale agreement and has insisted future profits
from licensing and franchising the company name in South Africa go
into a union trust, Adler said.
   The chief executive of Mobil's South Africa operation, Robert
Angel, said Friday there would be no immediate change in employment
policies or benefits when the company is turned over to the General
Mining Union Corp., a South African conglomerate.
   He and General Mining officials have said all existing
agreements with the union would be honored and Mobil would
continue, until at least 1994, to fund a foundation that supports
community development programs in South Africa.

   One man wanted to sprinkle powdered
cheese on the nation's worst oil spill in hopes it would make the
oil congeal and easier to pick up.
   Another would have dropped feathers on the slick, either making
the sludge easier to pick up or tarring and feathering Alaska's
coast.
   Ideas on how to clean up the 10.1 million gallons of oil spilled
in Prince William Sound began pouring in before the Exxon Valdez
tanker wreck was 24 hours old.
   A Japanese company sent a box of equipment. The problem was the
directions also were in Japanese.
   It is a big challenge figuring out who is trying to unload a
warehouse of some product and who has an answer to Alaska's
problems, said Jeff Mach, coordinator for the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation.
   ``We've gotten hundreds of offers,'' Mach said. ``Some of them
come across as a little bit of salesman and a little bit of a
do-gooder.''
   Exxon, too, has been deluged with inventions.
   ``They range from the sublime to the ridiculous,'' said Exxon
spokesman Dennis Stanczuk. ``The one thing about all of them,
though, is it's people trying to help.''
   Tens of thousands of towels have been sent to Valdez to help
with the mop-up.
   One of the most successful strategies has been to do what nature
does to cleanse itself _ shower the rocky beaches with water.
   ``This high-volume flushing of the beach ... it's nature's
way,'' said Erich Gundlach, a specialist in oil contamination of
beaches and a consulting geologist for the state.
   ``They're speeding up the natural processes,'' Gundlach said,
adding that ``too many people expect a toothbrush out there.''
   Most of the ideas being used are established practices taken
from past oil-spill fights.
   Alaska fishermen gave a twist to a tried-and-true method by
sewing absorbent pads into the nets they normally use to catch
herring, salmon and other fish in Alaska's rich waters.
   Most products presented to state biologists and
environmentalists are turned over to the Coast Guard, which sends
them to the service's research center in Connecticut.
   ``It's easy to test your product in a bathtub,'' said the DEC's
Mach. ``They want to test it in a real field situation.''
   Art Cecala of Costa Mesa, Calif., brought a drum of Sanifoam, a
product made in Florence, S.C., under the auspices of 3M. Cecala's
problem was getting anyone to stop long enough to arrange a test of
his product.
   ``It's a real Catch-22,'' Cecala said. ``If you go to one agency
they'll say you've got to have the other's approval first.
Everybody uses everybody else as a scapegoat for not using the
product.''
   Cecala described his foam as 96 percent air, 3 percent water and
1 percent urea formaldehyde, and said it has a bacterial reaction
as opposed to a chemical reaction _ making it safe for the
environment.
   ``You can just spray it on, and over an extended period of time
the oil will be eaten away. It takes a while. A couple, three
years,'' he said.
   Spotting oil sheens has been a problem, Cecala noted. ``Once
they threw this on it, it wouldn't be a problem,'' he said. ``It
would look like giant popcorn.''
   Some oil spill solutions are too secret even to discuss, as Mach
found out when a group from Hawaii called offering a product but
refused to say what was in it.
   Cleanup officials dare not reject out of hand the well-meaning
suggestions lest they overlook a possible solution.
   The state was similarly besieged with ideas from around the
country in October when three Calfornia gray whales were trapped in
ice near Barrow.
   Two Minnesotans, who were given a polite brush-off when they
offered their services, refused to take no for an answer. Rick
Skluzacek and Greg Ferrian loaded their equipment on an airliner
and flew to Barrow at their own expense.
   Their device, known as a ``bubbler,'' proved invaluable in
keeping the whales' breathing holes ice-free and freeing the
animals.

<HEAD>Heated Capitol Hill Debate Ahead For Bush Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ President Bush's decision to go ahead with the $7
billion FSX fighter deal sets the stage for a heated congressional
debate over U.S.-Japanese defense ties, trade friction and
America's high-technology future.
   In announcing the agreement for joint development and production
of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter, Bush sought to allay
concerns voiced on Capitol Hill _ as well as within his own
administration _ over the economic and technological impact of the
deal.
   Bush told reporters Friday that the United States will have a 40
percent share in the development work and a ``similar share'' of
the production run for the 130 planes which Japan wants to deploy
in the late 1990s.
   Addressing technology issues, the president said that
``sensitive source codes for the aircraft's computer will be
strictly controlled. Access will be granted to only those codes
that are essential to complete the project.''
   Bush said he was convinced that the agreement ``is in the
strategic and commercial interests of the United States.''
   However, several members of Congress said they were still
dissatisfied with the terms of the deal and would strive to block
it when the agreement is sent up to Capitol Hill for a 30-day
review period.
   Congress could try to halt the deal by passing a joint
resolution of disapproval, but a two-thirds majority of both houses
would be required to override a likely Bush veto of such a
resolution.
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., chairman of the House FSX Task
Force, declared that ``I will lead an effort to ensure that this
giveaway of American technology never sees the light of day.''
   ``Once again, the administration has allowed political and
foreign policy factors to dominate a decision having a fundamental
impact on our economic future,'' said Gephardt, who last year ran
for president on a trade protectionism platform.
   Gephardt's St. Louis district is the home of General Dynamics,
which is slated to work with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in
co-developing and co-producing the FSX.
   The Missouri Democrat and other critics of the deal contend that
Japan instead should buy American-made F-16s ``off the shelf,'' to
help ease this country's $55 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   The FSX announcement came the same day as the Office of the
Trade Representative released a study listing Japan as one of the
worst users of trade barriers. According to published reports, the
agency recommended sanctions for refusing to open its markets to
U.S.-made cellular phones and mobiles radios.
   Proponents of the FSX have argued that the deal will give U.S.
industry access to valuable technology _ particularly in the areas
of composite wing construction and advanced radar systems _
developed by the Japanese.
   However, a congressional source said a classified report sent to
Capitol Hill Friday by the General Accounting Office, an
investigative arm of Congress, indicates that the United States
actually may gain little or nothing from such Japanese technology.
   ``We don't know ... as to what advanced technologies they (the
Japanese) might have. So it's pure guesswork. From what they've
been able to estimate from open-source stuff, the U.S. is far
advanced in wing composites and is even further advanced in the
radar technology,'' said the source, who spoke on condition he not
be identified.
   The source said GAO officials also were expected to testify at
hearings on the FSX that when the deal was initially negotiated
during the Reagan administration, U.S. officials ``did not consider
any commercial or economic implications. They did not bring in any
agencies that do that. ... They did it solely for security reasons,
and security was narrowly defined.''
   After the Bush administration took office, concern over the
deal's broader economic implication was voiced at White House
meetings by Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills. This prompted Bush to send the draft
agreement back to Tokyo for ``clarifications.''
   Another point that is expected to be raised by FSX critics on
Capitol Hill is use of so-called side letters to handle provisions
on the U.S. production work share and protection of computer source
codes, rather than stipulating these provisions in the
U.S.-Japanese ``memorandum of understanding'' that is the heart of
the deal.
   This goes to the issue of trust in Japanese willingness to fully
live up such agreements. In the past, Tokyo has been accused of
failing to adhere strictly to provisions of other side-letter
agreements, including in the area of semiconductors.
   Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., commented about the Japanese, ``I
don't trust them. I think they'll promise you anything, and then do
what they want.''
   D'Amato said he likely will join in a resolution of disapproval
on the FSX, even though he doubts the move will be successful in
blocking the deal.
   Congressional critics also are expected to argue in coming weeks
that the FSX deal will provide technology that may help propel
Japan's aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the
United States.
   ``We are giving our strongest competitor in the world
marketplace the expertise it lacks to directly challenge America's
leadership in international civil and military aircraft sales,''
said Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J.

<HEAD>Moslems Fire On Christian Heartland, Violating Truce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem forces fired howitzer shells into
the Christian heartland on Saturday, violating the latest truce
called by the Arab League.
   Police said Syrian and allied Druse gunners fired a half dozen
shells into the coastal strip of the 310-square-mile enclave north
of Beirut. No casualties were reported.
   A police spokesman said the forces of Gen. Michel Aoun,
commander of the Christian army brigades, did not retaliate.
   The sporadic shelling came during growing differences betweeen
Aoun and the Arab League over the interpretation of a key provision
in the truce accord that went into effect at noon Friday.
   The truce is the fourth effort by the Arab League in less than a
month to contain six weeks of hostilities that have killed 273
people and wounded nearly 1,000.
   A provision in the agreement calls for ``lifting the blockades
imposed on all sea, land and air facilities...''
   Aoun, who also heads the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, insists that the clause covers only the ports of Beirut
and Jounieh in the Christian enclave. They are besieged by the
Syrians and allied forces.
   Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi sent cables to Aoun
and his Sunni Moslem rival, Salim Hoss, saying the provision in
question covered ``all sea ports.''
   Aoun responded to Klibi in a cable saying his blockade of
militia-run ports was ``in implementation of Lebanese laws and
therefore are not to be described as blockades.''
   ``Lebanon has sought the support of the Arab League to help it
implement its laws and extend its authority on all its territory
and not to give a legitimate status with an Arab cover to
illegitimate situations (ports) that violate local and
international laws,'' Aoun's cable added.
   The Syrians and their allies besieged the Christian enclave in
retaliation for a blockade by Aoun's forces of militia-run ports.
   Aoun, on March 6, ordered the blockade to stop the illegal ports
from collecting customs fees that instead would go to the state
treasury.
   Aoun has charged that three ports run by Syrian-backed militias
along the Mediterranean coast south of Beirut were used to
``smuggle drugs and terrorism to the world.''
   Hoss sent a cable to Klibi declaring support for his
interpretation of the controversial provision and saying the
majority of the Lebanese people did not regard Aoun as their
legitimate prime minister.
   An aide to Hoss, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
dispute might ``block implementation of the truce'' which was
announced late Thursday after an emergency meeting of the Arab
foreign ministers in Tunisia.
   Aoun had welcomed the Arab League's decision to send Arab
military observers to oversee implementation of the truce, calling
it ``a shy step in the right direction of lifting the Syrian
hegemony off Lebanon.''
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing
to achieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League by
siding with the Moslems against the Christians in the civil strife.
   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive Syria's
40,000 troops from eastern and northern Lebanon as well as from
west and south Beirut.

<HEAD>Tanker Spills Nearly 1 Million Gallons Of Oil In Red Sea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A supertanker that ran aground in the Red
Sea was refloated Saturday, but sources said it leaked nearly 1
million gallons of oil that could damage coral reefs and turtle
breeding grounds.
   Salvage crews were breaking up a 50-mile oil slick the Indian
tanker left after it ran aground off Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. The
accident ruptured three of the ship's tanks and sent about 2
percent of its cargo into the water, according to the company that
owns the vessel, Shipping Corp. of India.
   The tanker was taken Saturday to the Saudi port of Jiddah after
part of its cargo was pumped into another vessel so the tanker
could be refloated.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London reported earlier
that 1.5 million gallons had leaked, but Saudi-based sources who
requested anonymity said Saturday that about 924,000 gallons
spilled.
   The Exxon Valdez spilled about 10 million gallons of oil into
the water off Alaska last month.
   S. K. Sood, joint managing director of the Shipping Corp. of
India, said the 276,744-ton Kanchenjunga supertanker had 71 people
on board when the accident occurred six miles off Jiddah. There
were no reports of injuries.
   His statement _ issued by the government-run company in Bombay,
India _ did not give the cause of the accident, which occurred
after the tanker picked up a load of light crude and headed back
toward Bombay.
   Although earlier fears of a major pollution threat to the Red
Sea eased Saturday, one environmental expert warned that even a
relatively small spill could endanger the waterway's environment.
   ``The Red Sea is especially vulnerable because it has many
beautiful coral reefs, and there are some turtle breeding islands
in the area,'' said Walter Vreeland, an American advisor to Bahrain
on environmental problems. Vreeland also said light crude oil is
more toxic to marine life than heavier grades.
   The Kanchenjunga was one of the first ships attacked in the
Persian Gulf during the ``tanker war'' that once raged between Iraq
and Iran.
   The ship's bridge was wrecked and two crew members were wounded
in an attack by Iranian warplanes in the gulf on Christmas Day,
1984.

   The jury in the Oliver North trial ended
deliberations for the weekend shortly after noon today after
considering the case for about three hours.
   Earlier in the morning, the trial judge had cut off contact with
the press corps because 10 news organizations have gone to court to
seek public disclosure of a piece of evidence in the case.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has been keeping in touch
with the news media through a press corps emissary.
   ``Hereafter no information will emanate from my chambers,''
Gesell said in a letter to Carl Stern of NBC News, the news media
liaison with the judge. ``Please advise the press to call'' a court
telephone number which is updated periodically to keep up to date
with court proceedings.
   Stern said the judge was taking the step because the press is
now an adversary in a court proceeding before Gesell. The
Associated Press and nine other news organizations want public
disclosure of a stipulation summarizing intelligence intercepts of
a CIA-assisted November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   More than 20 news organizations that were not parties to the
proceeding wrote a letter to Gesell saying that ``each of us ...
requests permission to maintain contact with the Court or its
chambers regarding developments in the North matter.''
   North's lawyers referred in closing arguments to the
stipulation, but the court refused to release the document publicly.
   It shows that top U.S. officials knew at the time of the
November 1985 shipment that Hawk missiles were aboard the craft.
   North is charged with creating a false chronology that says no
one knew until January 1986 that Hawks were aboard. Part of his
defense is to show that CIA director William Casey and national
security adviser John Poindexter knew from the intercepts what was
aboard, yet agreed to the story that no one knew.
   On April 22, Gesell rejected the disclosure motion by the news
organizations to release the stipulation, saying it ``is a
classified document.''
   The news organizations appealed and the appeals court Friday
sent the matter back to Gesell, calling for a hearing on national
security issues involved, saying it cannot make a decision without
having such a record.
   Today, the judge set a conference for Monday when a schedule can
be set for compiling a record on the national security issues.
   North is accused of lying to Congress to cover up his role in
secretly assisting the Contras and lying to the attorney general
about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from the
Iran arms sales. He also faces charges that he accepted a $13,800
home security system and converted $4,300 in traveler's checks from
a Contra leader to his own use.

   Soviet Jewish immigrants living in Israel have
submitted a record number of invitations for their relatives to
come from the Soviet Union, Israel radio reported Saturday.
   It said that about 79,000 invitations were submitted to Soviet
authorities last year, the highest annual figure since the
beginning of the mass Soviet Jewish emigration in the late 1960s.
   An invitation from relatives living abroad is a necessary step
for a person wishing to emigrate from the Soviet Union.
   Uri Gordon, head of the Jewish Agency's immigration department,
was quoted by the radio as estimating that Soviet Jewish emigration
would reach 50,000 this year.
   But the radio quoted Gordon as saying that 90 percent of the
emigrants are likely to choose the United States and other Western
countries instead of Israel.
   Last year, the Soviets allowed about 20,000 Jews to emigrate.
Only about 2,200 chose to settle in the Jewish state.
   In the first three months of 1989, 9,461 Jews were permitted to
leave, according to the Washington-based National Conference for
Soviet Jewry.

   A day before the deadline, Isabel Cedillo walked
into a federal office at a shopping center, hoping to end seven
years of skirting the law as an illegal alien.
   Now the Mexican woman and her seven children are learning
English and civics and are on their way to becoming American
citizens, along with some 1.7 million others granted temporary
residency under the amnesty program that ended a year ago this week.
   The program is operating without major flaws, said Richard Rios,
director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service office in
Houston.
   Under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, people
seeking amnesty from prosecution and deportation as illegal aliens
had to prove they had been living in the United States continuously
since Jan. 1, 1982, and apply for temporary residency between May
5, 1987, and May 4, 1988.
   The Houston amnesty center became the busiest in the nation,
taking 137,000 applications during the year-long period.
   Residency was denied only to those who couldn't prove they had
been in the United States since January 1982 or who had a felony or
three misdemeanor convictions or had been deported before, said
Jean Christiansen, an INS spokeswoman in Dallas.
   ``Nationwide, the amnesty program had a 94 percent approval
rate,'' Rios said.
   Those approved for temporary residency begin the process of
applying for permanent residency. Already, 12,300 aliens have been
granted permanent residency in Houston, Rios said. The national
figure was not immediately available.
   It will take an additional five years before the new permanent
residents can become American citizens. During that time, most
amnesty applicants must pass an English-language civics test.
   Exemptions from the test are granted to people under 16 or over
70, and those who have attended a year of high school, college or
graduate school or have completed 40 hours of a course like the one
Mrs. Cedillo is taking.
   ``I like to learn, so I've been coming here to learn,'' she said
in Spanish, after attending a class at a neighborhood center.
   For two hours, she and about a dozen other students listened to
Juan Vasquez explain about the 13 original colonies, the American
flag and the three branches of government.
   Vasquez interjected questions in Spanish and English.
   ``Who is the president of the United States?'' Vasquez asked.
   ``Reagan,'' shouted Mrs. Cedillo.
   ``No, it's George Bush,'' piped up Maria Juana Martinez, 30.
   Vasquez then explained the two-term limit for presidents and
went on to ask how many years someone can be president.
   ``Here it's four years per term, but in Mexico it's six years,''
said Mrs. Martinez, who came to Houston nine years ago from Mexico.
   The class meets four hours a week for 10 weeks.
   Mrs. Cedillo has managed a 10-unit apartment complex for eight
years. Her children range in age from 11 to 23.
   ``I tell them to talk to me in English when they come home from
school so I can learn more. A lot of times I'll say something and
my youngest will say, `Mommy, that's not right. It's like this,'''
Mrs. Cedillo said in Spanish.
   Mrs. Cedillo, who came to the United States eight years ago,
said she has no regrets about leaving her husband and home in
Mexico so her children could have a better life.
   ``Here, they can go to school for free and get books for free,''
she said. ``In Mexico you have to pay and it's hard to get the
children in good schools. I just tell my kids to apply themselves
and appreciate what's available.''
   Mrs. Martinez and others in the class say they cleaned offices
or worked in other places where English wasn't required.
   ``I just fixed salads and stuff like that at a cafeteria,'' said
Mrs. Martinez. ``My family got along fine. I never needed any help
like welfare or anything. That's why I never applied for residency.
   ``But with the amnesty program I decided to take advantage of
it.''

   Clouds of brown butterflies have shrouded
the roads and sidewalks and made driving difficult in an Iranian
border town, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Saturday.
   Scientists have no immediate explanation why the butterflies
were drawn to Dargaz, 420 miles northeast of the Iranian capital of
Tehran, said the agency, monitored in Nicosia. But some experts
speculated the invasion followed a drop in rainfall, the agency
said.
   The butterflies swirl around street lamps, decreasing visibility
for drivers at night. In addition, the heat from the lamps kills
them and increases work for street sweepers, IRNA said.

   The first person to win a new
trophy in jazz dubbed an ``Ella'' to honor lifetime achievement was
the award's namesake, Ella Fitzgerald.
   Miss Fitzgerald was honored at a black-tie party Friday night to
celebrate her 71st birthday, which was Tuesday. The gala was a
fund-raiser for the Society of Singers, an organization that helps
needy singers.
   Bill Cosby was chosen to serve as master of ceremonies and among
those who had planned to attend were Dionne Warwick, the Pointer
Sisters, Mel Torme, the Manhattan Transfer and Carol Burnett.
   Saxophonist Benny Carter, who discovered Fitzgerald when she was
15, was scheduled to lead a jazz session.

   Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
International Olympic Committee, landed in the hospital with a
bleeding ulcer after four days of meetings concerning the 1992
Barcelona Summer Olympic Games.
   A spokeswoman for the Quiron Clinic said Saturday that his
condition was good.
   Samaranch, 68, ``enjoyed a quiet, uneventful night and was

   For her ``Just Say No'' drug campaign, former
first lady Nancy Reagan was given the ``Pioneer of the Year'' award
by a U.S.-Soviet organization that fights drug abuse.
   ``This award recognizes Mrs. Reagan's invaluable global
contribution to substance abuse recovery and prevention,'' the Rev.
J.W. Canty said Friday.
   Canty, who presented the award to Mrs. Reagan in a closed
ceremony at her Century City office, is chairman of the Soviet-U.S.
Joint Conference on Alcoholism, Drug Addiction and Peace. The
Episcopal priest established the first Alcoholics Anonymous group
in Moscow, where he still works.
   Three Soviet members of the Moscow AA group told Mrs. Reagan
about their battle with alcoholism.
   The award, shaped in a structure of building blocks, symbolizes
the process of recovery from drug abuse, Canty said. He added that
Mrs. Reagan hoped to pay another visit to Moscow to aid in the
effort to combat alcohol and drug abuse.

   Variety is the spice of an actor's life, says
Peter Boyle, whose easy transition from slapstick comedy to
hard-core drama has made him one of Hollywood's busier character
actors.
   ``It's fun to do a great number of roles _ doing the same thing
can get extremely boring,'' Boyle said last week.
   In the film comedy ``The Dream Team,'' Boyle plays an
advertising executive whose belief that he's really Jesus Christ
lands him in a psychiatric hospital. He also stars opposite John
Candy in the just-released car-chase film ``Speed Zone.''
   Boyle will be seen this week on television in the dramatic
miniseries ``Guts and Glory,'' about former White House aide Oliver
North's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. Boyle plays former
national security adviser John Poindexter in the two-part show,
which begins Sunday.

   Dolly Parton is launching a two-year,
$10 million expansion of her country theme park here in the
mountainous region where she was born.
   The plan will allow Dollywood to operate on a year-round basis
beginning in the spring of 1990, the entertainer announced Friday.
   The expansion includes shops, restaurants, a celebrity theater
and a new museum that's nearly double the size of the current one.
   Parton, 43, opened the park in 1986 near the Smoky Mountain
National Park in East Tennessee. The flamboyant singer grew up in
nearby Sevierville in a two-room mountain shack.
   ``I think it would be great for the business community here if
we could help make the Smokies a year-round resort area by doing
special things in the wintertime, because winter in the Smokies is
gorgeous and really pretty mild in terms of weather,'' she said in
a statement.
   Parton is celebrating her 25th year as an entertainer. She has
starred in several movies including the hit ``9 to 5,'' was host of
a television series, and recently released her 50th album, ``White
Limozeen.''

<HEAD>Report Says South African Soldiers Helped Guerrillas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of a border town said South
African soldiers helped guerrillas in a vicious rampage that killed
seven people, the national news agency reported Saturday. South
Africa denied the report.
   In a dispatch from the town of Ressano Garcia, reporter Cassimo
Ginabay of the AIM news agency said, ``Townspeople unanimously
agree that there was South African involvement in the attack.''
   The rampage, which included looting, burning of cars and killing
of livestock, began at 10:30 p.m. Thursday and ended nearly five
hours later, AIM said.
   The town is across the border from Komatipoort, South Africa,
where Mozambique and South Africa signed a pact in 1984 agreeing
not to support guerrillas operating in each other's territory.
   Both sides have claimed violations, but relations between the
two countries have improved over the past few months. South Africa
has even given aid to help the Mozambican army protect the
country's power pylons from attack by the rebel Mozambican National
Resistance.
   The Resistance has been fighting since 1977 to topple the
Marxist-oriented government. It denies reports that it attacks
Mozambican civilians.
   South African government officials say no official support now
goes to the guerrillas. But AIM continues to carry reports that
South African military equipment and soldiers are used to supply
the guerrillas or to aid them in operations.
   AIM quoted Lucas Chirute, owner of a local disco, as saying that
the attackers were unloaded from a South African army vehicle. ``I
saw at least 15 bandits get out of the vehicle,'' he said.
   The AIM report quoted another witness, who was not identified,
as saying that during the attack, South African soldiers shone huge
searchlights on a supermarket being looted.
   ``They lit up the area around the Foreign Exchange Store, from
which the bandits stole most of the food,'' the person was quoted
as saying. AIM said the same source reported that South African
soldiers shot at people who were running toward the South African
side of the border. It said at least 200 residents fled into South
Africa.
   A spokesman for South Africa's military said 147 refugees fled
into Mozambique late Thurdsay and early Friday after heavy gunfire
was heard coming from the direction of Mozambique.
   ``These facts obviously make nonsense of AIM's claims'' that
South African forces participated in the attack, the spokesman said.
   AIM quoted local administrator Domingos Durbeque as saying 250
guerrillas, divided into three groups, attacked the town, mainly
targeting the military headquarters, the border guard post and the
Foreign Exchange Store.
   AIM said six miners, returning to visit their families after
working in South Africa, were killed, as well as a woman.
   AIM said the guerrillas stole or burned the belongings of more
than 20 miners waiting to catch a train; dynamited and set fire to
four locomotives valued at $6 million; burned seven vehicles;
destroyed the town's immigration post; shot cattle in a corral; and
kidnapped an unknown number of people who were forced to carry away
the looted food and clothing.

   Reporter Bill Dedman and five editors of The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution were named winners Saturday of the
1988 Worth Bingham Prize for ``The Color of Money,'' a series on
racial discrimination in lending practices of Atlanta banks and
savings and loan institutions.
   Dedman was designated recipient of the $2,500 cash award, but
the three judges said the honor would be shared by the team of
editors who, ``in the face of opposition and denials, put the
series in the paper.'' The prize was announced at the annual White
House Correspondents Association dinner.
   Among the editors cited were copy editor Sharon Bailey,
assistant city editor Hyde Post, and assistant managing editors
Dwight Morris and Wendell Rawls Jr. The judges also named Bill
Kovach, editor of the Atlanta papers when the series ran last year.
They said that Kovach, ``during the 22 months he was there, created
an environment where tough, probing journalism like `The Color of
Money' could be practiced, making the Atlanta newspapers worthy of
the legacy of Ralph McGill and Eugene C. Patterson.''
   Dedman, who now works for The Washington Post, ``reported the
series with determination and wrote it with accuracy and style,''
according to judges Howell Raines of The New York Times, Bob
Woodward of The Washington Post and Barbara Matusow of
Washingtonian magazine.
   The Worth Bingham prize, created after the death, in 1966, of
the 34-year-old scion of the Bingham newspaper family in
Louisville, Ky., honors newspaper or magazine reporting that
investigates situations of national significance where the public
interest is being ill-served.

<HEAD>Government Claims 422 Rebels Surrender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Saturday that 422
Moslem guerrillas have agreed to stop fighting and give up their
weapons, bringing to 3,000 the number of rebels it claims have
surrendered.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani refused to name
the groups or individuals who surrendered but said their numbers
have increased since Feb. 15, when the Soviet Union withdrew its
remaining troops from Afghanistan.
   ``We are expecting more in the future, maybe a major one very
soon,'' Amani said. He did not say when the 422 guerrillas
surrendered or what happened to them.
   The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting since April 1978 to
overthrow the Marxist government of President Najib. There are no
reliable estimates on how many total guerrillas there are.
   The government also said it recently reached agreements with a
number of village leaders along the Salang Highway, the key supply
route between the capital and the Soviet border to the north.
   The agreements offered each village much-needed food and fuel,
provided that government vehicles were allowed to travel unmolested
on the highway. Rebels have consistently attacked government
vehicles on the road.
   The government said the offer, which was repeated in the
national press, was accepted by nearly every village. Only the
village of Mirbackhat was singled out for refusing.
   Amani also reported fighting had occurred in the provinces of
Nangahar, Kandahar, Herat and Paktia since Friday night.
   The spokesman said rebels fired rockets into the eastern city of
Jalalabad, the capital of Nangahar province. The city has been
under siege since March 6.
   Amani said 7,000 rebels have died in the Jalalabad assault,
while only 300 soldiers and civilians have been killed. Other
diplomats have put the government death toll at about 2,500.
   They say casualties among the civilians in Jalalabad have been
high, but they have not provided estimates.
   Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul, once had a population of
64,000 but tens of thousands of people have fled to Kabul or into
Pakistan.
   Amani said three civilians were killed in the latest attack and
five were wounded. He said the Afghan armed forces fired heavy
artillery at the rebels, killing 117 and wounding 113.
   The Soviet news agency Tass also reported heavy shelling and
rocket attacks in Kabul, and said that four civilians were killed
and three wounded. It said Afghan aircraft and artillery
retaliated, ``putting out of action 230 rebels.'' It did not
elaborate.
   Tass also said that government forces found a ``considerable
amount'' of explosives at various locations in Kabul ``which
extremists intended to use against civilians.''
   In the town of Sarobi, between Kabul and Jalalabad, 16 rebels
were killed and 15 were injured others injured, Amani said.
   One civilian each died in Herat, Kandahar and Paktia provinces,
he said.

   A United Mine Workers strike against the
Pittston Coal Group has led to more than 1,180 criminal charges,
mostly resulting from civil disobedience tactics reminiscent of the
'60s civil rights movement.
   The 3{-week-old UMW strike against Pittston operations in
Virginia and West Virginia grew increasingly bitter last week as a
daylong rally shut down this mountain town where coal trucks
regularly rumble down the main street.
   Miners' families joined in getting arrested and more than 200
high school students walked out to support the union.
   ``We're not wanting to violate the law,'' said UMW strike
coordinator Marty Hudson. ``We just want people to know what
Pittston Coal has done.''
   Union officials say Pittston, the nation's 15th largest coal
company and second largest coal exporter, has violated labor laws
and refused to bargain in good faith.
   Pittston dropped out of the industry's main bargaining group,
the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, before talks started on
a new contract last year, opting to work out its own agreement with
the UMW.
   The rest of the major coal producers have reached agreements
with the union. But 15 months of negotiations have resulted in no
contract for Pittston.
   The company canceled health insurance for 1,500 UMW retirees
when the old contract expired Jan. 31, 1988. One strike deadline
passed earlier this year when the union agreed to a 60-day cooling
off period requested by the governors of Virginia, West Virginia
and Kentucky.
   Both sides agreed that wages are not a major issue in the
contract dispute. The sticking points are job security, employee
responsibility for paying for health insurance, and Sunday work
days.
   The UMW finally called a strike April 5, affecting about 1,700
workers in Virginia and West Virginia. It did not strike Pittston
operations in Kentucky, citing ``strategic reasons'' it will not
explain.
   The uses forms of civil disobedience such as the sit-in to draw
attention to its cause, but has updated them with new technology.
Union officials carry beepers on the picket lines, and some have
car phones. Both sides videotape everything, sometimes aerially,
for possible use in court. At times, security guards film pickets
filming guards.
   Union members wear camouflage on the picket line, presumably to
make it more difficult to identify individual miners on videotape.
   The campaign began April 18, when 37 wives and widows of UMW
members staged a 30-hour sit-in at Pittston's headquarters in
Lebanon, in western Virginia.
   By Friday, State Police reported arrests on 122 felony charges,
mostly throwing rocks at non-union coal trucks, and 1,060
misdemeanors, mostly sitting in roads and blocking entrances to
Pittston mines and coal preparation plants.
   Authorities did not know how many people were arrested because
some were charged more than once.
   Arrests Monday sparked a rally at the Dickenson County
Courthouse in this community just southeast of the Kentucky state
line that was attended by hundreds of sign-toting relatives and
supporters of UMW members.
   The next day saw a walkout by students at three high schools who
staged their own rally at the courthouse. On Thursday, 70 student
walked out at Lebanon High School and staged a rally outside
Pittston headquarters.
   ``We have said all along, since when they announced they would
use civil disobedience, that it is merely a predetermined excuse to
break the law,'' said Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland.
   She said the UMW has ignored a Dickenson County circuit judge's
order barring mass demonstrations at 17 Pittston operations.
   ``They're just putting themselves above the law,'' she said.
   Hudson says the civil disobedience, by keeping union members
occupied, has prevented violence.
   The union also has urged Pittston shareholders to ask at the
company's May 9 annual meeting how long Pittston can operate during
a strike, even with replacement workers in some mines.
   Union officials say their strike fund totals $100 million and
can be boosted at any time by increasing assessments on dues.
Striking miners are paid $200 a week from that fund, and the union
is providing low-cost hospitalization insurance for those left
without benefits.

   The archbishop of Canterbury said
Saturday that the people holding Terry Waite hostage in Lebanon
would benefit more from his freedom than from his captivity.
   The Most Rev. Robert Runcie, head of the Church of England and
spiritual leader of the Anglican church, said the chances of
freeing his emissary are ``very difficult in the short term.''
   ``But in the long term I remain optimistic,'' said Runcie, who
was in Larnaca for a meeting of the 27 Anglican archbishops.
   Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while he was on a
mission to try to secure the release of foreign hostages believed
held in Lebanon.
   ``It is poignant to be so close to Lebanon. I haven't been so
close to Lebanon since Terry disappeared,'' Runcie said during a
news conference in a Larnaca hotel, less than 125 miles from
Lebanon.
   Asked if he had any message for Waite's captors, Runcie said:
``Terry Waite always spoke up for the suffering people of Lebanon.
If Terry were free, he would be your best ambassador for securing a
better and more hopeful future for all the people of Lebanon.''
   Runcie reiterated that ``we will not enter into any deal over
the hostages, we will not pay any ransom, yet we remain alert if
any opportunity offers itself.''
   Fifteen hostages are believed held in Lebanon by Shiite Moslem
groups loyal to Iran. They include nine Americans. Longest held is
Terry Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril broke up a mutinous military unit by transferring most of the
soldiers to provincial garrisons, independent Radio Metropole
reported Saturday.
   The powerful Dessalines Barracks Battalion rebelled April 2
after Avril discharged four of its officers who were implicated in
drug trafficking.
   Loyal troops put down the uprising, and unofficial reports say
at least 30 soldiers and civilians were killed and 75 wounded in
the fighting.
   About 590 of the Dessalines Barracks' 613 enlisted men who have
reported for duty in recent weeks boarded buses in front of army
headquarters and were driven to new military posts scattered across
the impoverished Caribbean nation, Radio Metropole said.
   The army high command has accepted the resignations of an
unspecified number of Dessalines soldiers, Radio Metropole said,
quoting army sources.
   Avril has forced out around 140 officers in his realignment of
the undisciplined 7,000-man army since he took power after
noncommissioned officers in the Presidential Guard overthrew Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17, 1988.
   Many of the discharged officers were suspected of being involved
in the shipment of cocaine from Colombia to the United States.
   Washington has made a crackdown on drug trafficking a condition
for restoring $70 million in Haitian aid. The aid was cut off after
elections planned for November 1987 were halted by gunmen aligned
with the ousted Duvalier dictatorship.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday
urged 20,000 youths at a soccer stadium to reject violence and
embrace forgiveness and reconciliation in this troubled African
island nation.
   On the first full day of his nine-day African tour, the pope
made frequent reference to the social and economic problems that
contributed to recent anti-government riots in Madagascar in which
six people were killed.
   After flying to the port of Antsiranana on the northern tip of
the island for a outdoor Mass, the pope returned to the capital to
address youths at the Alarobia stadium, a soccer ground cut into a
red hillside.
   ``Whoever you are, whatever your difficulties, you have to be
intransigent in the defense of rights and justice,'' John Paul
said, speaking in French while standing on a raised platform.
``Reject violence, reject contempt, reject lies and dishonesty.
Take risks if it's necessary, but ... know how to forgive and
reconcile.''
   In a speech to the country's 21 bishops later, the pope praised
their recent document proposing natural family planning to control
the country's 3 percent annual population growth.
   ``You refuse `contraceptive imperialism' and even more abortion,
which is against Malagasy wisdom and civil law,'' the pope said.
``I strongly encourage you to continue to educate consciences on
this essential point.''
   Only one in 100 married women in Madagascar uses contraception,
according to the World Watch Institute. The population of 11
million is projected to approach 17 million by 2000.
   In the meeting with youths, the pope cited the concerns of
students and laborers who can't find jobs or salaries that allow
them to raise a family. He singled out rural workers who ``often
are subjected to a climate of insecurity and violent actions,'' an
apparent reference to the widespread banditry in the countryside.
   One student asked the pope if he had any remedies for the
country's ``critical situation of decay.''
   ``Let's say clearly that it is not my position to analyze all
the aspects, nor to propose solutions. First and foremost because
it's you, the Malagasy people, who have to act,'' the pope said.
   The Roman Catholic Church in Madagascar has often spoken out
against the policies of President Didier Ratsiraka, saying the
country has slipped into moral, social and economic decay.
   Ratsiraka, who took power in 1975, was re-elected last month to
a third seven-year term. Opposition leaders charged the elections
were rigged.
   Opposition parties have suspended their protests during the
pope's visit, declaring a ``papal truce.'' Two main opposition
leaders have asked to meet with the pope, but Vatican officials
said a meeting was uncertain.
   The youths clapped, waved banners and swayed to the rhythm of
Polynesian-flavored music reflecting the diverse ethnic makeup of
the country. Young girls on a platform held up cards forming words
in Malagasy, including the slogan ``Everyone must work together to
improve our country.''
   The pope urged the youths to reject drugs, alcohol and casual
sex, saying, ``Casual encounters are but a caricature of love.''
   In Antisaranana, the pope celebrated Mass for about 20,000
people gathered on a dirt and sand field next to the airport.
   The pope leaves Monday for the tiny French Indian Ocean island
of Reunion, then travels to Zambia and Malawi before returning to
Rome on May 6.

   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan is engaged in an intense, behind-the-scenes effort to name
an Oklahoma state official to a top agency job, threatening trouble
with anti-abortion forces.
   ``I can't think of anything in the short-term more likely to
cause a real uproar,'' said Gary Bauer, president of the Family
Research Council and a former aide in the Reagan White House.
   Sullivan's choice to head the Family Services Administration,
which manages major welfare programs, is Oklahoma state Secretary
of Social Services Robert Fulton.
   Resistance to Fulton marks the first clash between Sullivan and
anti-abortion forces since a truce in the first days of the Bush
administration that assured pro-lifers they would get top agency
posts. They in turn vowed not to oppose Sullivan's confirmation.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said that while ``the
administration has shown compete good faith'' on the earlier
appointments, the controversy around Fulton adds ``a whole new
element.''
   Even though Fulton would be heading a non-medical agency, he
would be ``dealing with family matters,'' Humphrey said last week.
   Sullivan first upset anti-abortion activists with a newspaper
interview indicating he personally opposed abortion but favored
women's right to choose.
   In the fray that followed, Sullivan assured his critics that he
shared Bush's opposition to abortion except in cases of rape,
incest or danger to the mother's life.
   Humphrey and other conservatives in Congress sought assurances
from the White House that several top HHS jobs sensitive to
abortion policy would go to people who actively shared Bush's
anti-abortion views.
   The positions for which they sought assurances were
undersecretary, assistant secretary for health and assistant
secretary for public affairs, Humphrey said, and the lawmakers
suggested names for Sullivan to consider.
   One of the first people Sullivan recommended for an HHS position
was among those suggested. James O. Mason, formerly director of the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, has been confirmed by the
Senate as assistant secretary for health, a position that will have
policy dealings on the abortion issue.
   Two others Sullivan recommended early on also were applauded by
the conservative Republican lawmakers: Constance Horner, director
of the Office of Personnel Management, whose nomination to be
undersecretary is awaiting Senate confirmation; and Kay James,
former spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee, as
assistant secretary for public affairs.
   Despite the latest controversy, Sullivan has persisted in
support of Fulton. And Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon has lobbied on
Fulton's behalf at the White House, according to sources who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
   Sullivan is to meet with White House officials to discuss his
recommendation this week, said Chase Untermeyer, assistant to the
president for personnel. Untermeyer said that while Fulton is
Sullivan's choice, ``there are also other candidates we are looking
at.''
   ``That would be a very controversial nomination if they went
forward with it,'' said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of
the National Right to Life Committee.
   In a letter to the White House, Humphrey said he was concerned
about allegations in a lawsuit suggesting that from 1977 to 1983 a
number of babies born with spina bifida _ a severe spinal defect _
were denied needed surgery in a state-operated hospital in Oklahoma.
   Fulton, who in 1983 became director a state agency with
authority over the hospital, strongly denies any suggestion that he
condoned such practices. He recently was dropped as a defendant in
the lawsuit.
   ``It's certainly not true that we sat around and let the
challenged practices continue,'' he said in an interview. ``There
isn't any question we took appropriate action.''
   The lawsuit was filed in October 1985 after Fulton refused to
sign a consent decree, which he said would have been tantamount to
an admission of guilt on the state's part to things he knew not to
be true.
   He said that while he served in the two top state health
offices, only one spina bifida infant died and that child died of
complications from multiple birth defects.
   Humphrey said, however, that he remains concerned about the
``very serious allegations, which if true would certainly seem to
rule him out from a place in Health and Human Services since his
point of view would be directly in conflict with that of the
president in the area of right to life.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, one of the conservative senators who
initially expressed concern about Sullivan, said in a recent
interview that the secretary and President Bush have been sensitive
to abortion opponents' concerns.
   Hatch said he is satisfied with those Sullivan has recommended
to top HHS positions, adding, ``but I don't think the abortion
issue should drive everything. I think it's also important that you
get the best people you can get and I think they're moving in that
direction.''

<HEAD>Sunken Robot Raised, Breathing New Life Into $7 Million Science Project</HEAD>

   The errant underwater robot Jason was raised from
the deep Saturday, breathing new life into a $7 million
international satellite science project whose submersible star had
unceremoniously sunk.
   ``The crew had prepared an understudy for the project, but now
the show can go on,'' said Paul Fontaine of Boston's Museum of
Science. ``Jason is back.''
   The 7-foot-long, remote-control robot will be on center stage
Monday as the first of 250,000 students in 13 cities across the
United States and Canada hook up via a two-way satellite with
marine explorers in the Mediterranean Sea.
   About 2,000 museum officials, teachers and technicians were
testing the system last week when Jason, a propeller-driven
submersible equipped with video camera and maneuverable arms,
disappeared overboard.
   Dr. Robert Ballard's rubber-booted assistants were easing the
million-dollar robot overboard off the coast of Italy when the
cable snapped and the younger brother of the robot that first nosed
among the Titanic's ruins sank 2,100 feet to the soft, silty ocean
floor.
   ``Everybody felt very badly about it,'' said Fontaine, one of
dozens of museums officials nationwide who have worked nearly two
years to coordinate the project.
   ``Jason's as much a member of the crew as anybody. He was on the
frontline, though, and everyone knows it's the frontline person who
takes the biggest risks,'' Fontaine said. ``It was particularly sad
because he hadn't even had the chance to show off his stuff.''
   But Shelley Lauzon, a spokeswoman for Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution on Cape Cod, said it was not immediately clear whether
Jason would be used in this week's explorations.
   ``But we're hopeful,'' she said. ``Everything seems to be fine.
But they'll be looking it all over before making a final decision.''
   Fontaine said his colleagues and school teachers nationwide
would be ``ecstatic'' to hear the good news about Jason, who has
been the focus of lesson plans in grade school classrooms around
the country.
   Lauzon said the support ship Star Hercules weighed anchor
Saturday and started steaming about 120 northeast to the spot where
Jason and his mobile garage, Argo, were to explore and broadcast
during the science project's first week.
   The May 1-14 project, whose sponsors include Woods Hole, Turner
Broadcasting System, the National Geographic Society and Electronic
Data Systems, will return to broadcast live during its second week
from the scene of Jason's unexpected brush with extinction.
   The participating museums are The Boston Museum of Science; the
Museum of Natural History in Denver; the Detroit Science Center;
the Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the Museum of Science and
Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.)
Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; the
Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center; Mote Marine Laboratory
in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic Society Grosvenor Auditorium
in Washington and Dallas; and the Royal British Columbia Museum in
Victoria, British Columbia.

   Not a day passes now in the McMartin
Pre-School molestation trial without the judge reminding
participants of its marathon status as one of the longest criminal
trials in U.S. history.
   ``I don't want to hear the history of bad faith in this case,''
Superior Court Judge William Pounders chided attorneys who were
sniping at each other in a recent session. ``That doesn't interest
me. What I'm interested in is current events. ... We've got to move
on.''
   The trial of Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin
Buckey, 62, hit the two-years-and-four-days mark Thursday,
surpassing by one day the Hillside Strangler trial of Angelo Buono.
But the McMartin trial is months from conclusion, and attorneys say
it is unlikely to end before 1990.
   Testimony from 99 witnesses has filled 50,000 transcript pages,
and Los Angeles County says the proceedings have cost about $15
million.
   Buckey spent more than four years in jail before he recently was
able to post bail.
   The mother and son, accused in 65 combined counts of conspiracy
and child molestation, are the only remaining defendants in a case
that began five years ago with seven people charged. Charges
against the other five were dismissed after the district attorney's
office concluded there was insufficient evidence.
   The case drew national attention when it broke with allegations
of nursery school children being raped, sodomized, then terrorized
into silence by satanic rites and animal mutilations by teachers.
   But as the case was pared down, doubts were raised about whether
the children had been coaxed into describing events that hadn't
happened, to please their adult interviewers.
   A preliminary hearing took 18 months. At trial, the prosecution
spent more than 14 months presenting testimony from 61 witnesses
including nine children who claimed they were raped, sodomized or
forced to have oral copulation.
   The defense is in the sixth month of its presentation, which has
featured testimony from former teachers and students who testified
they never saw children molested at the school.
   The judge, whose temper has flared repeatedly in recent weeks,
took drastic action to cut down testimony after jurors began
dropping out of the case and some appeared to be nodding off during
testimony.
   Two weeks ago, he slashed eight witnesses from the defense case
and warned that he would do whatever is necessary to ensure that
the trial reaches a verdict.
   ``I have an obligation to see that it's a fair trial and that it
gets to a jury that's still there,'' Pounders said. ``I am
desperately concerned that we are not going to have a jury to
complete this case, the most illogical case that's ever gone to a
jury.''
   Over the years of testimony four of the six alternate jurors
have been excused, two for medical reasons, one who was ruled
inattentive to testimony and one who had career difficulties
because of the trial's duration.
   Another juror recently reported that the company that has been
paying his salary may go out of business, which would force him to
leave the jury and look for work. Pounders was so disturbed at the
prospect he said he might consider asking the county to pay the
juror's salary for the rest of the trial.
   Although the strain of the long proceedings has taken its toll
on all participants, Pounders has been the most visibly distraught,
lashing out at attorneys and others. At a session last week, the
owner of a service that he accused of delaying delivery of
transcripts became the brunt of his anger.
   Pounders frequently blames defense attorney Davis for delays, to
which Davis recently responded outside court: ``If you get a judge
who goes bonkers you can lose the case, too.''
   For jurors, the highlight of recent weeks was a chance to leave
the stuffy courthouse and travel 25 miles to the seaside suburb of
Manhattan Beach where they visited the little school where
molestations allegedly occurred.
   The jurors strolled through the school grounds, paced off
distances from one room to another and did their own sound tests to
see if voices could be heard between classrooms.
   The next day, they came to court with an enormous cake to mark
the trial's two-year anniversary.
   ``I thank you,'' the judge said, ``for enduring with us.''

<HEAD>Officials Meet Students, But Protest Leaders Vow to Continue Campaign</HEAD>

   In a major concession to a student movement for
democracy, senior officials met Saturday with student leaders to
discuss their demands. Protest leaders, however, denounced the
meeting as a government plot to destroy their campaign.
   They said 41 universities in Beijing would continue their
week-old class boycott until the government accepts their newly
formed student union as the true representative of students. The
government has declared the group illegal.
   Despite the complaints, the meeting was an unprecedented event
in a country where the people and their leaders have little contact.
   Radio and television stations carried a lengthy broadcast of the
meeting, providing some of China's most eloquent citizens with a
rare platform to criticize the government.
   ``Does Premier Li Peng really fear the people?'' asked one of
the 45 students present. ``If not, why won't he talk with us?``
   ``Most people I know don't believe the Chinese press. It should
be allowed to tell the truth and not used by the party,'' said
another.
   The 3{-hour meeting, with State Council spokesman Yuan Mu, State
Education Minister He Dongchang and high-ranking officials from the
Beijing city goverment, marked the first time government officials
have met with student activists since protests began two weeks ago.
   Government officials, speaking on behalf of Premier Li, called
on the students to return to class. They made no promises to change
state policy but acknowledged student complaints and implied that
further meetings would be possible.
   The appearance of Yuan, believed to be part of the inner circle
of the nation's top decision-makers, was an indication of how
seriously the government regards the recent unrest.
   The meeting was part of a series of concessions and defeats the
government has suffered since the protests began.
   On April 22, for example, the government was unable to put into
effect an order closing Tiananmen Square because 150,000 students
and their supporters occupied it to commemorate the death of ousted
Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang. It was his death April 15 that
sparked the first demonstrations for political reforms and free
press.
   On Thursday, tens of thousands of students marched through lines
of police, defying threats of a government crackdown, in the
biggest demonstration in Communist China's 40-year history.
   Both Yuan and He cracked jokes and laughed throughout the
meeting as they sought to adopt a conciliatory attitude toward the
student movement.
   At one point, Yuan said the government ``understood the
patriotic fervor, the desire to push democracy and deepen the
reforms expressed by the students in their marches.''
   The statement indicated a radical change from the shrill tone of
an editorial last week in the People's Daily, accusing the students
of plotting to overthrow the socialist system. An editorial in the
Saturday editions of the People's Daily also expressed sympathy for
the students' goals.
   The government apparently hopes it can split most of Beijing's
students from the leaders of the independent student association
that has organized the protest. The government has said the group,
the United Association of Beijing Universities, is illegal.
   If the government succeeds in its goal, it is unclear what
awaits the association's leaders. Several fear arrest.
   Most participants at Saturday's meeting came from the officially
appointed unions. Only two came from the independent association's
leadership, although other participants said they were sympathetic
to the association's goals.
   Wu'er Kaixi, the president of the association, was invited to
the meeting but not allowed to attend after he refused to give up a
plan to openly denounce the government's position that the
association was illegal.
   ``We will by no means acknowledge that this meeting was a
dialogue,'' Wu'er said at a hastily called news conference. ``This
is a plot to co-opt our movement. Our minimum condition is that
they accept us as a legal organization.''
   At Beijing University, several hundred students crowded around a
loudspeaker, hooting derisively at the broadcast.
   ``Shut up!'' they yelled as Yuan explained that the government
``had achieved grand success in fighting corruption.''
   Many students believe that corruption has so infected the
government that it is beyond saving.
   Other barnyard noises followed when he claimed that Hu had left
the party of his own accord in 1987.
   Hu was purged after he was accused of not cracking down hard
enough on pro-democracy demonstrations in 1986-87.
   Students at Beijing University published the first edition of a
student-run paper, the News Journal, a four-page mimeographed
pamphlet with articles supporting the strike and the student
movement.
   The Chinese government, meanwhile, criticized a U.S. statement
on the recent demonstrations, calling it inappropriate because the
demonstration ``is purely China's internal affair.''
   In Washington, the State Department said that all people should
have the right of peaceful assembly, ``including peaceful protest
and freedom of expression.''
   Student leaders have said the class boycott will go on until
Thursday, the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, China's
first student demonstrations for democracy.

   Police stopped a car on a highway near Milan
on Saturday, seized $10 million worth of cocaine and heroin, and
arrested the driver, authorities said.
   Investigators said the drugs, 22 pounds of cocaine and seven
pounds of heroin, probably were intended for distribution in
southern Italy by the Camorra, an underworld organization in Naples.
   Milan police, who had the driver under surveillance, said they
followed the car 20 miles before they stopped it on the
Milan-Bologna highway at a point where the exits were controlled to
prevent escape.
   The driver, 37-year-old Antonio Arena of Naples, was arrested
and charged with drug trafficking, police said.

   Commercial salmon fishing in oil-tainted
Prince William Sound will begin next month on schedule, but 30
percent of what should have been a record $50 million catch may be
lost, officials said Saturday.
   Fishing boats will be barred from many areas of the sound when
the season starts May 15, said state biologist James Brady.
   At one time, officials had considered canceling the season
altogether, just as they had canceled the $12 million herring
fishing season and smaller seasons in the sound for shrimp and
sablefish after the Exxon Valdez ran aground and spilled more than
10 million gallons of oil March 24.
   Instead, fishermen will be crowded into a smaller area in
efforts to keep their nets clear of oil that would contaminate
whatever salmon are caught.
   ``I feel confident that we will be able to proceed with our
salmon fisheries,'' said Brady, a biologist with the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game. ``But we will have to sacrifice some
harvest.''
   State officials will test whatever salmon is brought in by the
760 fishermen, and pledge that no contaminated fish will reach the
market. Spotting and smelling fish tainted by crude oil is easy,
biologists say.
   Also Saturday, skies cleared and the seas were calm, allowing
the cleanup to resume after several days of waiting out blustery
weather.
   Pilots in oil-hunting spotter planes and slicker-garbed crews
aboard skimmer boats coordinated their collection efforts as the
tar-like residue floated just off or coated shorelines on the Kenai
Peninsula.
   About 300 people using the USS Juneau as a floating hotel rode
landing craft to Smith Island where crews are trying to hose down
rocky beaches before pregnant harbor seals haul out to have their
pups.
   Teams from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
and from the state Department of Fish and Game toured Sugarloaf and
Marmot islands off the Kenai Peninsula. Those may be next on the
list to be cleaned for seals, the Coast Guard said.
   The sections of Prince William Sound most likely to be closed
for the May salmon season include prime fishing grounds along the
outer edge where pink salmon arrive still a bright silver after
months at sea, Brady said.
   The 6 million salmon expected to return to the Sawmill Bay
Hatchery probably will be off-limits to fishing ships because of
the oil, although hatchery managers may be allowed to take fish
inside the bay in order to recover expenses.
   Other closures may include the western and southwest corner of
the sound where non-hatchery salmon gather before making their runs
up freshwater streams.
   ``A lot of the bigger slicks have moved out of the sound, or are
hard on the beach,'' Brady said. ``But there's still a lot of oil
on the water.''
   There is some concern that fishing boats helping in the cleanup
will be contaminated by the clinging goo. ``We have to make sure we
don't have oily boats carrying clean fish,'' Alaska environmental
commissioner Dennis Kelso said.
   Exxon vice president Ulyesse LeGrange promised the oil company
would stockpile extra nets in case fishermen's nets get
contaminated, but state biologist Brady predicted, ``If fishermen
hit oil, we will run out of gear.''
   Fishermen are preparing for an unusual salmon season.
   ``We've heard a lot of politicians and even James Brady speak of
a fishery as normal, and that concerns us,'' Mike Schomer of the
Copper River Fishermen's Cooperative said.
   ``I don't think we're ging to have by any means a normal
fishery.''

   Shortly before the jury in the Oliver North
trial wound up its eighth day of deliberation without a verdict
Saturday, the judge in the case cut off direct communications with
reporters covering the case.
   ``Hereafter, no information will emanate from my chambers,''
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said in a letter to Carl
Stern of NBC News who has been acting as a news media liaison with
the court since the trial began.
   The judge said a lawsuit filed last week by 10 news
organizations for public release of a document has made the press
corps a party to the case and therefore put reporters in an
adversary position.
   Since the trial began three months ago, a copy of most documents
introduced in court have been made available to the press and news
organizations banded together to reproduce them.
   During the jury deliberations, reporters have remained in a
press room two floors above the court and relied on Stern's contact
with Gesell for information about the progress of the
deliberations, including notice when a verdict is reached.
   For the first time since the jurors retired to consider the
case, reporters were not allowed to wait on the second floor where
they spend their day.
   Gesell refused to release the paper, a stipulation summarizing
intelligence intercepts, on grounds that it ``is a classified
document.'' The intercepts, as described in court, were a
step-by-step tracking of a shipment of Hawk missiles sent by Israel
to Iran in November 1985 with CIA assistance.
   The news organizations petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals
after Gesell's refusal and that court ordered the judge to hold a
hearing at which a record can be made.
   Parties to the news media petition were The Associated Press;
Cable News Network, Inc.; Capital Cities@ABC, Inc.; CBS, Inc.; Dow
Jones &amp; Company, Inc.; National Broadcasting Company, Inc.;
National Public Radio; The New York Times Company; The Times Mirror
Company, and The Washington Post.
   Reporters from more than 20 other organizations on Saturday
wrote to Gesell asking that they be excluded from his new rule.
   ``The press organizations which have sent reporters to cover the
North matter are independent of each other, and are not a
monolithic `press corps' in any sense in which that phrase may be
understood or interpreted,'' the letter said.
   It was signed by representatives of the Cleveland Plain
Dealer@Newhouse News Service, Reuters, Congressional Quarterly,
Washington Times, United Press International, Boston Globe, UPI
Radio, Chicago Sun-Times, United Stations Radio Network, New York
Post,
   USA Today@Gannett, WUSA-TV (Washington, D.C.), Cox Newspapers,
Conus-TV, Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Gillett Broadcasting, New York
Daily News, WJLA-TV (Washington, D.C.), Pacifica Radio, Time
Magazine, Voice of America, and Independent News Network.
   Not long after Gesell issued his notice, a courthouse official
notified the press room that the jury had wound up its work after
deliberating three hours and was leaving for another weekend
sequestered in a downtown hotel. That raised total deliberation
time to 40{ hours.
   North is accused of lying to Congress to cover up his role in
secretly assisting the Contras and lying to the attorney general
about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from the
Iran arms sales. He also faces charges that he accepted a $13,800
home security system and converted $4,300 in traveler's checks from
a Contra leader to his own use.

   Chandelle Summer, an attorney who
concentrates on criminal defense law, wants to go up in court
against her husband, an assistant prosecutor.
   Her husband's boss doesn't want that to happen, she said, so
she's taking him to court.
   Mrs. Summer said Andy Fuller, district attorney for the
Northeastern Circuit Superior Court, told her he will not let her
husband, Assistant District Attorney Dan Summer, represent the
state in cases in which she represents the defendant.
   In a petition filed with the U.S. District Court in Gainesville,
Mrs. Summer said Fuller's ``vacillating policy'' regarding the
couple's professional dealings ``has caused confusion and delay.''
   She claims that Fuller's action violates her rights to due
process and equal protection guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.
Fuller declined to comment on the petition.
   Mrs. Summer said she is not seeking monetary damages. She simply
wants a ruling by a federal judge that will allow her to deal with
her husband as she deals with other district attorneys.
   ``I just want to be treated just like everyone else who is
practicing law and does criminal defense law. I don't want to have
any advantages or disadvantages,'' she said.
   Said her husband: ``It's a free country.''

   The principal of Cerritos Elementary
School is serious about higher education. That's why Jeannie Flint
spent a day on the roof.
   Mrs. Flint, 43, made good on a wager with her students. If all
400 read for 500,000 minutes at home, she would become the
educator-on-the-roof.
   The pupils did it, averaging 1,250 minutes of reading or more
than 20 hours each. So as students serenaded her Friday with ``Up
On The Roof,'' the principal climbed two ladders and perched on the
roof complete with parasol, balloon-bedecked chair, desk, cordless
phone and books.
   She is not the first to pull such a stunt. A San Gabriel school
principal donned a monkey costume and spent the day on the
cafeteria for 1 million minutes of outside reading. A South
Pasadena principal was ``roofed'' twice for good reading quotas.
   At Cerritos Elementary School, parents were asked to keep track
of their children's reading or to read to the kids themselves.
Another incentive came from the local Kiwanis Club, which promised
a $50 U.S. savings bond to one student from each grade who read the
most.
   ``I want to encourage them to read and make reading a lifelong
habit,'' Mrs. Flint said as a lunch prepared by students was
hoisted up to her on the flat-topped roof. ``I knew they could do
it. I just didn't think they could do it so soon.''

   Academy Award-winning animation
director Clyde ``Gerry'' Geronimi, who worked on such classic Walt
Disney films as ``Cinderella'' and ``Sleeping Beauty,'' died at age
87.
   Geronimi, who died Monday at home, brought to life Mickey Mouse,
Pluto and other Disney characters in a 28-year career at the studio
that spanned both movies and television.
   Before joining Disney in 1931, Geronimi worked at Hearst studios
transferring comic strip characters such as ``The Katzenjammer
Kids'' onto film.
   He became a director in 1938 and won his first Academy Award the
following year for the cartoon short ``The Ugly Duckling.'' He
captured his second Oscar in 1942 for another short, ``Lend a Paw.''
   Geronimi also worked as a segment director on such Disney films
as ``The Three Caballeros,'' and ``Peter Pan,'' and was supervising
director on ``101 Dalmatians.''
   His one-time Hearst colleague, Walter Lantz, the creator of
Woody Woodpecker, presented him with an Annie award in 1977 on
behalf of the Hollywood chapter of the International Animation
Society.
   He is survived by two sons, three grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.

   Engineers on Saturday studied two
mechanical problems that halted the launch of space shuttle
Atlantis and its robot Venus probe, and a NASA spokeswoman said
it's anybody's guess when the mission will take place.
   The space agency said the flight will not be attempted before
late this week at the earliest and that it will be at least Monday
before a new launch date will be set.
   Sources said the delay, which began with the last-minute
cancellation of the flight Friday, could stretch to a week or more
if technicians have to replace both a faulty fuel pump and a
leaking fuel line.
   NASA said it will replace the line but would not know about the
pump until engineers inspect it Sunday.
   ``We don't know when we can go; it depends on where the
trouble-shooting takes us,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   She said NASA and industry officials evaluated the problems
Saturday and assigned committees to study each element. She said
those committees would make preliminary reports Sunday.
   Three of the five astronauts _ Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman
Thagard _ returned to their training base in Houston Saturday, an
indication NASA doesn't expect to launch soon. Commander David
Walker and pilot Ronald Grabe planned to leave here Sunday after
flying practice runs in a jet plane equipped to handle like the
shuttle.
   The delay squeezes valuable time out of a 32-day launch
opportunity ``window'' for dispatching the Magellan spacecraft
toward Venus.
   If the shuttle can't get off the ground by May 28, the mission
will have to be put off for two years, at a cost of more than $100
million, until Earth and Venus are again in proper alignment.
   ``Even with this current issue we've run up against, I'm
convinced we're still in a very favorable position to launch
Atlantis during the Magellan window,'' shuttle chief Richard Truly
said Saturday.
   The countdown was halted Friday with just 31 seconds left after
controllers noted a power surge in a pump. The pump recirculates
liquid hydrogen through fuel lines serving engine No. 1, keeping
the lines cool and in proper condition for ignition.
   After the launch was called off, engineers examining TV tapes
noticed a second problem, a vapor cloud spewing from a line that
carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the shuttle.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said the problems posed no danger to
the five astronauts because there are so many safeguards the
engines would not have started.
   After the scrub, the space agency tentatively set Monday as a
new launch target.
   The need to drain half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and
liquid oxygen propellant from Atlantis' fuel tank delayed access to
the orbiter until Saturday.
   NASA said engineers probably would not be able to inspect the
faulty fuel pump until Sunday. About the size of a baseball, it is
one of three such pumps in a package. Each pump serves one of the
three main engines.
   ``Shuttle managers ... will need additional information about
whether or not the recirculation pump or pumps need to be replaced
before making a decision about a next launch attempt,'' a space
agency statement said.
   NASA also said ``it is highly likely that the line will have to
be replaced.''
   The Magellan probe is to be released from Atlantis' cargo bay
and propelled by a rocket on a 450-day journey to Venus. It will
orbit the planet and map its cloud-veiled surface with
high-resolution radar.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is at loggerheads
with major European allies over retaining short-range nuclear
missiles, and some say the issue that has split NATO could cause
permanent damage to the alliance.
   West Germany wants the United States and Soviet Union to begin
talks on reducing the missiles, most of which are in West Germany.
But Mrs. Thatcher, supported by Washington, has said they should
not be removed while the Warsaw Pact has superiority in
conventional forces and chemical weapons.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Chancellor Helmut Kohl are to meet Sunday in
West Germany, but neither leader is expected to budge.
   ``It's a very serious problem for NATO,'' said Hans Binnendijk,
deputy director of the London-based International Institute of
Strategic Studies.
   In Bonn, Alfred Dregger, the parliamentary leader of the West
German ruling coalition parties, said: ``At present, there is less
danger of Soviet aggression than a situation in which disagreements
within the alliance could eventually lead to a loss of the trust
that is essential for its existence.''
   The major beneficiary might be Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, observers say.
   Mrs. Thatcher has said Kohl's call for weapons talks is
principally an election ploy. West German polls show a majority
support getting rid of short-range missiles.
   ``Kohl has a very difficult political situation, and that is
creating the problem,'' said a Thatcher aide who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``We're not insensitive to this. But getting rid of
short-range nuclear missiles is exactly what the Russians want.''
   Some observers say the confrontation marks the first time West
Germany has asserted its nationhood since the end of World War II.
The country is the base for 320,000 American and 60,000 British
troops.
   ``Kohl has publicly asserted ... that German national interests
must take precedence over those of the United States and Britain,''
the respected Guardian newspaper said in an editorial.
   West European leaders are working to defuse the crisis. Italian
and Dutch leaders are to meet with West German officials after
separate talks with Mrs. Thatcher, and West German authorities are
going to France.
   West Germany claims it has outright support from nearly half the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries: Denmark, Belgium,
Norway, Italy, Greece and Spain. Britain's leader has Washington
behind her.
   Mrs. Thatcher will have a chance to sway West European opinion
in a May 29-30 NATO summit, the first gathering of alliance leaders
attended by President Bush. The meeting is not, however, expected
to generate a unified West European position on the issue and many
say NATO will avoid action until after the 1990 West German
elections.
   ``It's a crisis for NATO,'' said Mark Fielder, an analyst at the
Royal United Services Institute, a London research center on
international relations.
   ``There will probably be a fudged communique,'' Fielder said.
``That will leave Gorbachev to make another arms control initiative
and NATO won't be able to respond.''
   Fielder said arms control initiatives by the Soviet president
have already created the image that ``Gorbachev is the man with
ideas.''
   In Bonn, Wolf Graf Baudissin, a West German disarmament expert
said Saturday that the current Nato disagreements showed NATO was
not equipped to handle friction over controversial issues.
   ``Previously, consensus was achieved more easily because of a
common feeling of the Soviet military threat,'' Baudissin said.
``But now, as this threat is perceived to dwindle, disagreements
are erupting as national interests common to the forefront.''

<TEXT>
   Six winning ticket holders for the $115.5
million jackpot still had not come forward when Super 7 officials
closed their offices for the weekend. The missing numbers are worth
$8.3 million each.
   Eight of 14 possible winning tickets from Wednesday's
headline-grabbing jackpot had been turned in. The thrill of instant
wealth attracted interest from as far away as New Zealand, lottery
officials said Friday.
   ``Ticket sales were spread around,'' said George Andersen,
lottery deputy executive director. ``We hope everyone checks their
tickets and we get a full set of winners.''
   Each of the 14 jackpot-winning tickets is worth $8.3 million
over the next 26 years. The annual payment, before any taxes, is
$317,524.67 for each ticket. The first payments will be handed out
in two weeks, at the local retail outlets where the tickets were
purchased and after completion of an extensive computerized
validation process, said lottery spokesman Terry Murphy.
   Consolation winners learned Friday night that matching six
numbers in the April 26 drawing paid $4,842.50 and five numbers
paid $275.36. Jackpot tickets matched seven of the 11 numbers drawn.
   Winners have a year from the date of the drawing to turn in
their tickets, or the money returns to the Lottery Fund and is lost
to the winner. About 1 percent of all the big prizes go unclaimed,
lottery officials said.
   Winners are given an extensive counseling session, with advice
on financial planning, consulting an attorney, estate planning,
explanation of the annuity from which the prize is drawn over the
26-year payout, and how to handle the media.
   ``We tell them to face the media, tell the truth, be as open as
they wish and if they don't wish to answer a personal question,
they need not do it,'' Andersen said. ``Typically, they're real
good at it.
   ``Because many of them are in a whirlwind of shock and surprise,
we have all this prepared in a folder and hand it to them,''
Andersen said.
   On the list of the initial eight claimants were 14 workers from
a Windham, Ohio, brick factory; a mother and two grown children
from the Johnstown, Pa., and Fort Montgomery, N.Y. areas; two Erie,
Pa., men who work at a General Electric plant; two couples and a
man from Morgantown, W.Va., where the three men work at West
Virginia University in the maintenance department; a woman from
Washington, Pa., who is a sales representative for an industrial
company; a five-member family from East Windsor, N.J.; a
74-year-old widow from Lebanon, Pa.; and a chiropractor and his
wife from New Brighton, Pa.

   About 2,000 people, representing a hodgepodge
of causes ranging from Korean reunification to gay rights, marched
from the Capitol to the White House on Saturday to protest Bush
administration policies.
   Organizers of the ``Campaign for a People's Fightback,''
sponsored by more than 500 separate organizations, had predicted a
far greater turnout, but a steady rain muddied their small tent
city, established Friday on the Capitol grounds, and doubtlessly
thinned the ranks.
   As the marchers passed the U.S. Courthouse where the Iran-Contra
trial of former presidential aide Oliver L. North awaits a verdict
from the jury, many chanted: ``North, North. Guilty, guilty,
guilty.''
   Part of the group was protesting U.S. policy in Central America.
Others were promoting more federal assistance to the homeless,
restoration of student grants and loans, more AIDs research,
cutbacks in weapons spending and a variety of other issues.
   Overall, said Sahu Barron, a principal organizer of the
coalition, the group was seeking the establishment of a ``people's
fund'' of $150 billion, the same amount proposed for a federal
rescue of failing savings and loans institutions, ``to bail out the
homeless, the hungry, and the jobless.''
   Sponsors included many labor and church groups, as well as
organizations as diverse as the Committee for Nuclear Disarmament
and Self-Determination in Korea, the Committee of Outraged
Lesbians, and the Communist Party of Northern California.

<TEXT>
   Senegalese ignored a state of emergency
Saturday and pillaged the few Mauritanian shops not damaged in
earlier violence that left at least 20 Mauritanians dead.
   Senegal was expected to begin airlifting about 20,000
Mauritanian refugees this weekend to their neighboring homeland
following the deadly rampage Friday.
   Police used tear gas to disperse crowds after declaring a state
of emergency Friday night and imposing a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew,
which brought relative calm to the capital overnight.
   But bands of Senegalese moved through the center of Dakar on
Saturday afternoon looking for Mauritanian-owned shops that were
not already damaged.
   The state of emergency, to be in effect for at least six days,
followed a rampage by Senegalese seeking out Mauritanians for
revenge attacks after the reported killing of an estimated 200
Senegalese in neighboring Mauritania last week.
   Press reports Saturday said at least 35 Mauritanians were killed
in the violence Friday in Dakar. Officials said Friday at least 20
people were killed.
   Police have been rounding up Mauritanians and giving them refuge
in a fairground outside Dakar. An estimated 20,000 Mauritanians had
been brought there by Saturday, according to Agence France-Presse,
the French news agency.
   France, the former colonial ruler of Senegal, announced Saturday
in Paris that it was furnishing five planes to airlift the
Mauritanians to their home and return to Dakar Senegalese hiding
out in the Mauritanian capital of Nouakchott.
   Spain on Saturday dispatched an air force transport jet loaded
with medicine, blankets and tents to Senegal and Mauritania.
   The violence began in a dispute April 9 between Mauritanian
shepherds and Senegalese peasants over grazing land at the border
of the two countries. Two Senegalese were killed in the incident.
   A week of scattered violence in Dakar erupted into a killing
rampage Monday and Tuesday in Nouakchott, in which as many as 200
people were reported killed. According to reports, most of the
corpses brought home had been decapitated, while some of the
injured returned to Dakar reportedly had their sex organs or limbs
mutilated.
   Word of the nature of the injuries and deaths spread through
Dakar, enraging the crowds who on Friday hunted down Mauritanians.

<HEAD>White House To Name Election Observer Team</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush this week will name an official
observer team to monitor Panama's elections as he weighs a series
of pre- and post-election actions in case of fraud, administration
officials said Saturday.
   The team of observers representing the administration will
consist of Congress members, administration officials and private
sector leaders, but would be distinct from other privately
organized efforts to monitor Sunday's balloting, said the sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The membership of the administration's group is not firm yet.
   In addition to the team that will represent the administration,
the government is encouraging private observer missions in hopes of
turning a bright spotlight on what U.S. officials have flatly
predicted will be an election rigged by Panama's ruler, Gen. Manuel
Noriega.
   Recent days have seen a flurry of policy meetings among White
House, State Department and military officials to determine what
actions should be taken before the election and what stance the
administration should adopt toward Panama afterward, sources said.
   ``All of the options are ones that involve high costs,'' in the
sense of political and international impact, said one official who
declined to specify the options.
   The deliberations come as officials continue to refuse comment
on a U.S. News &amp; World Report article last week that said Bush
signed a secret order authorizing the CIA to funnel $10 million in
assistance to Noriega's political opposition.
   Officials said only that pre-election actions have been
discussed.
   But with the administration predicting Noriega will steal the
election for his presidential candidate, Carlos Alberto Duque, the
focus is increasingly on how Bush should react after the balloting.
   Bush has said he will not accommodate Noriega, who was indicted
in February 1988 by a Miami grand jury on drug trafficking charges.
   The president last week accused Noriega of trying to commit
``systemic fraud'' in the election and said the United States would
not recognize his fraudulent election results.
   U.N. Ambassador Thomas Pickering on Friday accused Panama's
government of blatantly manipulating voter lists; muzzling the
opposition, press and TV; and restricting access by impartial
foreign monitors and journalists.
   Panama says the United States is meddling in its elections and
funnelling millions of dollars to the opposition campaigns.
   Noriega's staying power raises questions about how the United
States will act to protect the thousands of military and civilian
Americans who live in the Canal Zone, whether it will step up
pressure on allies to isolate Noriega, and how it will move forward
on the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties.
   Under the treaties, the United States is to turn over the
American-built canal to Panamanian control on Dec. 31, 1999.
   A closer issue will be choosing a Panamanian director of the
canal. Panama's president can make a recommendation, but Bush and
Congress are charged with actually appointing the individual by
next January.
   For Sunday's elections, the State Department is helping organize
a range of U.S. and foreign observer efforts besides the official
U.S. government team.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III himself telephoned former
Presidents Carter and Ford and urged them to be observers, sources
said.
   Carter will lead a group organized by the non-profit National
Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and Ford has been
invited to join them, said Ken Wollack, the group's executive vice
president. The team is co-sponsored by the National Republican
Institute for International Affairs, and will consist of U.S. and
foreign leaders, Wollack said. The observer mission received
$100,000 in funding from Congress.
   In addition, the Washington-based Center for Democracy office,
which monitored the 1986 Philippines elections, has organizers in
Panama arranging for another observer team of political leaders and
Congress members.
   The U.S. government recognizes the exiled Eric Arturo Delvalle,
who had tried to oust Noriega, as the legitimate president of
Panama.
   Bush has extended a trade ban the Reagan administration imposed
against Panama.

   The Coast Guard wasn't the only one to
respond quickly when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground in Prince
William Sound and set off the nation's worst oil spill.
   Souvenir shops sent out their own calls to artists, T-shirt
makers and suppliers. Five days later, spill-related merchandise
began appearing in stores, and the dark-humored items have been
enjoying a modest success ever since.
   Ann Derifield has run a souvenir shop in Valdez for 12 years.
When the Exxon Valdez got stuck on March 24, it was just a matter
of altering an old design. She already sold T-shirts with designs
of every tanker calling on the Alaska pipeline's marine terminal
across the harbor from her store.
   By March 28, she was selling baseball caps and shirts showing a
tanker cocked sideways on a reef, carrying the logo: ``Exxon Valdez
On The Rocks.''
   ``I would have had them earlier, but it was Easter weekend and
it took a while to track down my printer in Anchorage,'' she said.
   Derifield was one of the first to capitalize on the ecological
disaster, but she's far from alone.
   Another popular shirt being sold is the ``Tanker from Hell,''
illustrated by Ray Troll of Ketchikan. The shirt features a
shark-toothed tanker flying a skull and crossbones and gushing oil
as fish, birds and otters struggle to flee.
   On the deck a figure holds a bottle in his hand, an apparent
reference to the charges filed against Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph
Hazelwood, accusing him of being intoxicated while operating the
ship.
   Sales are benefiting a fishermen's union.
   ``It's just my way of doing my part as an Alaskan that's
concerned, and concnerned about the livelihood of fishermen in
particular,'' Troll said.
   Another shirt on sale shows a figure pulling a fish out of the
sea. ``I like my fish cooked in oil, not swimming in it,'' the logo
reads.
   Songwriters as well wasted little time in taking aim at the
Exxon Valdez.
   Mayf Nutter, an actor, singer and songwriter, was on stage at
the Anchorage Sheraton April 1 when he asked for audience ideas in
writing a song.
   When the audience was asked for a noun, someone called out
``drunk sea captain.'' The eventual ditty included a line about
``the world's worst human litterbug, the man we'd love to throttle.
He spilled 10 million gallons, from a one-quart whiskey bottle.''

<TEXT>
   A federal requirement that shrimp fishermen
use devices aimed at helping preserve endangered sea turtles has
bitterly divided environmentalists and shrimpers who claim it will
ruin their industry.
   ``If this law isn't changed, it will mean that the entire
shrimping industry is out of business,'' Tee John Mialjevich,
president of Concerned Shrimpers, said Saturday.
   ``It's not that we don't want to save turtles, it's that we want
to feed our families,'' he said.
   Concerned Shrimpers, which Mialjevich said represents 2,000
shrimpers from North Carolina to Texas, was formed to fight the
turtle excluder devices, commonly called TEDs.
   U.S. District Judge Patrick Carr held a rare telephone hearing
Friday afternoon after Louisiana Attorney General William Guste
asked for a temporary restraining order blocking the requirement.
Carr said he would rule Monday.
   Already, shrimp fishermen have won a 60-day reprieve from hefty
fines that were to go into effect Monday for boats that aren't
equipped with the TEDs, to free endangered sea turtles entangled in
their trawls.
   Last week, under congressional pressure not to strictly enforce
the special net requirements, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
said he was ordering the Coast Guard to issue only warnings through
June 30 _ instead of fines of up to $10,000 _ to violators along
the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.
   Environmentalists maintain that the TEDs will help save the
endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle from extinction, and
Mosbacher's decision drew criticism from a federal biologist.
   ``The shrimpers think that the sky's going to open up and God
will save them again,'' said Jack Woody, national sea turtle
coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``In this case,
God is the secretary of commerce. I'm totally frustrated at this
point.''
   Shrimpers disclaim responsibility for most of the 11,000 turtle
deaths estimated by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration each year.
   ``In 21 years of shrimping I've caught six Kemp's ridley sea
turtles and they all went right back into the water alive,''
Mialjevich said.
   ``I don't know of but about a dozen shrimpers that have TEDs,''
Ted Shepard, director of the 400 member Louisiana Shrimpers
Association, said Saturday. ``I don't think most of them will tow
them. They're having a hard enough time making a living now.''
   TEDs fit into the mouth of shrimp trawls and have trap doors
that let turtles escape.
   Fishermen maintain the devices are dangerous to pull and clog
easily, are expensive and reduce their harvests. The contention is
disputed by researchers who say fishermen who learn to use devices
correctly show no signs of loss. The ones based off Louisiana also
argue that the endangered turtles are not found in the waters where
they fish.
   ``This is an unbelievable horror story. There's just no way this
should be placed on the Gulf fishermen,'' Shepard said. ``You don't
get the Kemp's turtles in the areas we shrimp in. They're in the
Atlantic and off the coast of Florida.''
   Shrimpers have proposed alternatives, Mialjevich said, including
a $25 fee on shrimping licenses each year dedicated to hatching and
growing the turtles.
   The two-month delay in enforcement approved by Mosbacher comes
at the beginning of the sea turtle nesting season when thousands of
the seagoing creatures come ashore to dig their nests on sandy
beaches across the Southeast.
   Previous studies have shown that more than 11,000 sea turtles
drown in shrimp nets each year in the United States, incuding about
3,000 in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``We don't need to wait for another study to find out if they're
endangered,'' Woody said. ``They can call me and I'll tell them for
free. I've been putting little turtles in the ocean for 12 years
and watching them disappear.''

<HEAD>Brazilian Dockworkers End Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of dockworkers in seven
states in Brazil went back to work Saturday, ending a three-day
strike for higher pay, union officials said.
   Luis Carlos Silva Soares, a union official at Rio's port, said,
``All workers have returned to their jobs and the port slowly began
to resume normal operation today as of 7 a.m.''
   He said the Rio workers received pay increases of 50 percent.
They had been seeking 180 percent increases and a standardized pay
scale at all of the country's ports.
   The Union of Sea Navigation Agencies in Santos, which
coordinates and administers work by longshoremen, said the average
salary for a dockworker was about $600 per month.
   Inflation has been running at more than 1,000 percent a year.
The government froze most salaries in January but has allowed some
price increases.
   Silva Soares said dockworkers in the states of Rio Grande do
Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana, Espiritu Santo, Bahia and Pernambuco
also returned to work Saturday morning and were ``starting to
unload certain cargo, such as wheat shipments.''
   More than a third of 9,000 striking longshoreman in Santos, near
the industrial city of Sao Paulo and Brazil's busiest port, ended
their strike that began April 10, according to Jairo de Galvao, a
union leader in Santos.
   But he said much of the port, which normally handles 72,000 tons
of cargo per day and 35 percent of Brazil's exports, remained idle.
   ``About 5,500 mechanics, unloaders and inspectors are still to
vote on the offer and probably won't return to work until Monday,''
he said.
   The Sao Paulo State Dock Company was reporting losses of $1
million per day in uncollected loading and unloading fees.
   Company officials said 39 ships were docked in Santos waiting to
be unloaded and another 42 were anchored outside the port waiting
to enter.
   The strike did not affect oil shipments. The state oil monopoly
Petrobras has its own loading terminals and workers whose union did
not join the strike.

   The Foreign Ministry is investigating
reports that Costa Rica's ambassador participated in plans to
discredit the Sandinista government, the Sandinistas' newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The Barricada newspaper quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Jose Leon
Talavera as saying the ministry ``is evaluating with extreme
caution'' information that Costa Rican Ambassador Farid Ayales
engaged in activities ``outside his diplomatic functions.''
   The pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario reported Friday
that Ayales had met with Nicaraguan opposition leaders and a U.S.
Embassy official ``to prepare a foreign campaign of accusations''
against the leftist government.
   El Nuevo Diario said the campaign would seek to discredit
electoral law changes approved April 18 by the legislature for the
general election next February.
   The newspaper attributed its information to opposition party
sources, whom it did not name. It did not identify the U.S. Embassy
official allegedly involved.
   Nicaragua's opposition parties have denounced the new electoral
rules, saying they give the Sandinista party control over the
Supreme Elections Council that will supervise the balloting.
   Talavera told Barricada there are no restrictions on foreign
diplomats meeting with opposition figures but it was ``intolerable
under international laws'' for diplomats to ``become activists or
directors of local political organizations.''
   Talaveres also said Nicaraguan officials had ``made some
observations'' to Ayales several months ago about his conduct in
Nicaragua.
   Costa Rican officials have declined to comment on the El Nuevo
Diario report.
   Also Saturday, a Costa Rican newspaper reported that a
Nicaraguan air force flight engineer had defected to Costa Rica and
asked authorities for political asylum.
   The San Jose newspaper La Republica identified the flight
engineer as Jesus Ferrey Alvarado, 40, and said he sailed a small
boat to Costa Rica's Playa Rajada and asked for asylum. It said
Ferrey Alvarado is a specialist in Soviet-built MI-17 troop
transport helicopters.
   Costa Rican civil guard and immigration authorities could not be
reached for comment.
   On April 21 Sandinista air force Capt. Reinaldo Aranda Guido
defected to Costa Rica, piloting a small plane owned by a freight
company from Nicaragua's Corn Island to Puerto Limon on Costa
Rica's Atlantic coast.

<BYLINE>Iranian Newspaper Calls For Expulsion of West German Diplomats

   An Iranian newspaper on Saturday called
for the explusion of West German diplomats from Tehran, calling
them ``spies disguised as diplomats'' and part of an American
espionage network.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency carried excerpts from
the editorial in the daily Kayhan, which said the ouster of German
diplomats was the best response to ``the mischief of the Bonn
government.''
   Spokesmen for the West German Foreign Ministry in Bonn were not
immediately available for comment Saturday night.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi claimed Tuesday that some
agents of an alleged U.S. spy network in Iran were communicating
with the Americans through West German embassies in Europe.
   In addition, Information Minister Mohammad Mohammadi-Rayshahri
said Wednesday the agents all were linked to the CIA base at
Weisbaden, near Frankfurt in West Germany.
   The widely read Kayhan said Rayshahri's information was based on
intelligence reports and confessions by those arrested. Iran did
not say how many people had been rounded up in connection with the
affair.
   The liberal daily said the news of German involvement was
sufficient cause to sever relations with West Germany, said IRNA.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Kayhan as describing
the West German capital as being a haven for Iranian opposition
members, who use it to launch ``hostile operations against Iranian
interests.''
   The newspaper's call comes five days after the Iranian Foreign
Ministry threatened to reduce trade relations with West Germany,
accusing it of helping archenemy Iraq manufacture missiles and
internationally banned chemical weapons.
   West Germany is one of 14 countries that recalled their envoys
from Tehran in February to protest the death threat against British
novelist Salman Rushdie by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. Khomeini said Rushdie blasphemed Islam in his novel,
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Kayhan said West Germany always takes similar stands to those
taken by the United States when it comes to ``adopting a position
with respect to Iran ... this year the German government took sides
with Salman Rushdie.''
   Kayhan also accused the Bonn government of being ``insincere''
in its friendship, despite Iran's goodwill shown in the release of
two West German hostages who were held with pro-Iranian Shiite
extemists in Lebanon.

<HEAD>Shower of Meteorites Killed Off Dinosaurs, Scientist Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge asteroid skipping off Earth at a
low angle may have kicked thousands of giant boulders into orbit,
creating a shower of meteorites that gradually killed off the
dinosaurs, a scientist says.
   Brown University geologist Peter Schultz's research seeks to
answer a key objection to the theory that dinosaurs and many other
species 66 million years ago died out because a large object struck
the planet, raising a dust cloud that blocked sunlight and wiped
out food sources.
   Fossil experts have pointed out that the dinosaurs died over
hundreds of thousands of years, not all at once.
   Advocates of the theory responded by suggesting that a series of
asteroids, comets or meteorites hit the planet. The new theory by
Schultz and colleague Donald Gault of the Murphys Center of
Planetology in Murphys, Calif., explains how that might have
happened.
   In experiments using BB pellets and dry ice, the pair observed
that a projectile hitting a surface at an angle breaks into as many
as a dozen major pieces and thousands of smaller ones, which then
continue along the same trajectory at roughly half the original
velocity.
   Schultz suggests an object hit Earth, then ``literally skipped
off the surface'' and fragmented. ``They would continue to go
perhaps halfway around the Earth, (causing) thousands of other
devastating impacts,'' he said in an interview last week.
   An oblique impact would also kick up a tremendous amount of
debris. ``We found from doing these experiments that we produced an
incredible vapor cloud,'' Schultz said.
   The scientists tested their theory by firing BBs into pits of
dry ice to test sand trajectory paths and vapor formation.
   They concluded that a meteor striking the Earth at an angle
would spew out debris with enough speed to place it in orbit,
allowing it to remain in space long enough to cause large-scale
destruction, Schultz said.
   He said that within 100 years the cloud of debris would collapse
into a Saturn-like ring which would put part of the Earth in
darkness.
   ``The ring would last anywhere from 100,000 years to 10 million
years,'' said Schultz.
   Schultz, who presented his theory in March at the annual
international Lunar Planetary Science Conference in Houston, has
submitted it for publication. He plans to use his research to
examine the effects of the impact on Earth's climate.
   William Clemens, a professor of paleontology at the University
of California at Berkeley, said he still believes the mass
extinction was caused by a climatic change, rather than a collision.
   ``I would argue against any hypothesis that calls for long
periods of darkness and great cooling,'' he said. Some animals
survived through the period and he said that can be explained only
by a decrease in temperature of no more than 1 degree or 2. Other
scientists support alternate extinction theories, including
volcanic destruction.
   But Schultz said his theory is ``the link'' to the impact theory
first proposed by Luis and Walter Alvarez in 1980.
   Under Schultz's theory, as the ring decayed, debris would again
pummel the Earth. ``Every day we have a meteor shower,'' he said.
   He said the theory addresses the evidence of an extended
extinction; non-uniform dispersal of meteoritic matter; the absence
of a crater of sufficient size for a single devastating impact and
evidence of massive, intensive fires.
   ``Schultz and Gault are world-class experts on impact mechanics
and anything they come up with will certainly be looked at with
respect and interest by others involved in the work,'' said Walter
Alvarez. He declined to comment on the theory in detail.
   Schultz, an associate professor of planetary geology, said
studies of impacts on other planets suggest collisions generally
occur at angles.
   Angular collisions leave craters with very distinctive shapes.
``We can compare the rate at which oblique impacts occur on the
moon with what we expect theoretically and it fits,'' he said.

<HEAD>Saudis Say Iran Must Abide By Hajj Quota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia said Saturday that Iran
must comply with the quota system for sending people to the holy
cities of Mecca and Madina during the Hajj pilgrimage in July.
   At the 1987 Hajj, thousands of Iranians organized political
demonstrations in Mecca and 402 people were killed in clashes with
Saudi police. Iran boycotted the 1988 Hajj because of Saudi
restrictions.
   Iran's Shiite Moslem leaders have claimed that Saudi Arabia's
Sunni Moslem monarchs are unworthy guardians of Islam's holiest
shrines.
   Abdel-Wahab Abdel-Wasei, the Saudi minister of religious
affairs, issued a statement Saturday stressing that ``all Islamic
states including Iran (must) abide by the special arrangements for
organizing and defining the numbers coming to the holy sites to
perform the Hajj rites.''
   He referred to the decision adopted by the foreign ministers of
the 46-nation Organization of Islamic Conference meeting in Jordan
in March 1988. They approved the Saudi proposal to restrict the
number of pilgrims until the completion of renovations and
expansion of facilities in the holy cities.
   The quota was set at 1,000 pilgrims per million of the
population from each Islamic country.
   Iran had been sending about 150,000 people annually to the Hajj,
but the quota system reduced that number to 45,000.
   The Saudi minister was responding to Iranian complaints that the
quota blocked thousands of Iranians from performing the rites.
   The Islamic faith requires that all Moslems who can afford it
make the pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime.
   Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties with Iran in April 1988,
saying Iran was trying to destabilize the region. The relations
have not been restored.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Iran's Parliament, denounced
Saudi Arabia and the quota system earlier this year.
   He said the Hajj pilgrimage ``must cease to be a hollow worship
and should be turned into an active ... assembly for the Islamic
world to raise its issues and problems.''

<HEAD>300 University Students Rout South African Consul</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 300 chanting students at Temple
University forced a representative of the South African government
to flee the campus shortly after he was trapped in an elevator
facing an angry crowd.
   As campus and city police led John A. Davies, the South African
consul in New York, off the school's campus Friday, protesters
formed a gantlet and yelled, ``Don't come back!'' and ``Racist!''
   Students drummed their fists on the city police car that took
Davies away, breaking windows on the vehicle but causing no
injuries, detectives said.
   Davies was on campus to give a speech, but the demonstration
forced him to cancel his appearance.
   Davies, escorted by guards, had walked into the elevator before
the talk, but was stalled there with the elevator's doors open for
more than 20 minutes in front of hundreds of angry demonstrators.
Security guards and police stood between Davies and the protesters.
   Davies appeared upset by the experience, said Kostas Markou, a
Temple senior and native of Greece who was also in the elevator.
   ``He was shaking,'' Markou said. ``I said to him, `You must
know, I am Greek and the whole world does not like your
government.'''
   Police and school officials said it was not clear whether the
elevator was not working or whether protesters had sabotaged it.
   Students said they were pleased that Davies' talk was canceled.
   ``Why should we allow him to speak when our brothers and sisters
are not allowed to walk into another town (in South Africa)?'' said
Taneshia Nash, a black protester.
   Davies said later he had planned to discuss the need for
stability in South Africa so reform efforts could work. He said
blacks would lose their jobs and progress would be slowed if
economic sanctions were put into effect.
   ``I am frustrated,'' Davies said. ``I had been misled into
thinking there would not be any trouble.''
   University administrators said they were surprised at the
protest, occurring on the final day of spring semester classes.
   H. Patrick Swygert, vice president for administration, denounced
the protest of Davies' talk, which was arranged by the chairman of
the university's department of political science.
   ``It is the right of the professor to invite anyone who he
thinks is representative of a point of view,'' Swygert said. ``It
would be a terrible precedent for this or any other university to
censor that access.''
   Davies was in Philadelphia for a meeting of the American Academy
of Political and Social Science. He said he had spoken at Lehigh
and Princeton universities and that his speeches there were
delivered without protests, although his views were challenged.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Provisional President Andres Rodriguez
and his rivals joined hands with thousands of other Paraguayans
Saturday in a show of solidarity at the end of a campaign for
elections to restore democracy.
   ``After long years of falseness, the Paraguayan people will
elect for the first time, freely and responsibly, those who in
their names will administer and promote the common good,'' said the
Rev. Ismael Rolon, the capital's Roman Catholic Archbishop.
   Elections are set for Monday to choose a government to replace
the deposed regime of President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, who was
toppled Feb. 3 in a coup led by Rodriguez. The coup ended a
dictatorship in power since 1954.
   Voters will elect a president, 36 senators, and 72 national
deputies.
   As the throng of several thousand people left the national
cathedral in downtown Asuncion for a walk through the city
Saturday, marchers also reached out to traffic police and held
their hands aloft.
   ``We're here to reflect and pray that God helps us construct
democracy in Paraguay,'' said 19-year-old Shirley Villalba, a
medical student.
   U.S. Ambassador Timothy Towell stood at the rear of the crowd.
He watched as political rivals, former exiles, government
officials, and Paraguayans rich and poor held hands in what they
called a ``chain of hope.''
   ``This has never happened before,'' Towell said. ``That song
(Beloved Country) was banned under Stroessner. Now the government
candidate sings it and the people hold hands with the police.''
   Independent polls indicate Rodriguez, who is running for the
governing Colorado Party, will win up to 70 percent of the vote.
The surveys say Domingo Laino, presidential candidate of the
Authentic Radical Liberal Party, will gain 17 percent, with six
other candidates trailing far behind.
   The Colorado slate of legislative candidates is projected to
tally about 60 percent of the vote and thus gain an automatic
two-thirds control of congress.
   The party has controlled the government since 1947.
   Since taking power, Rodriguez has lifted restrictions on
political parties, restored civil liberties, accused former
government officials of corruption and torture, and allowed exiles
to return. Laino says, however, that farmers are still clamoring
for land, workers want enforcement of labor laws, politicians
expect constitutional reform, and women demand equal rights.

   The estranged wife of a man arrested in
connection with four stabbing deaths told police she watched her
husband commit two of the slayings, officials said.
   Ricky Lee Green, 28, of Azle was being held Saturday on $1.25
million bail on charges of murder and capital murder in the
slayings, which occurred in 1985 and 1986. Officers arrested Green
at his home Thursday morning after obtaining a statement from
Sharon Green.
   Wise County Sheriff Leroy Burch said Mrs. Green told police that
in both of the slayings she allegedly witnessed, her husband
brought a woman home, attacked her with a hammer and sexually
assaulted her in the bathroom.
   Mrs. Green said her husband would then call her into the room
and tell her to watch while he stabbed the woman repeatedly, Burch
said.
   Police said Green has confessed to the four slayings, but he
said that his wife helped him kill the two women; Mrs. Green
maintains she only watched the slayings, Burch said.
   Police Lt. Tommy Swan said Mrs. Green, 28, is not a suspect ``at
this time'' in any of the slayings. Green had been considered a
suspect in one of the slayings for some time, police said.
   The victims were a television advertising executive, a
16-year-old boy, a 27-year old Fort Worth woman and an unidentified
woman, police said.
   Mrs. Green told police she had kept her husband's secrets for
several years because she was afraid of him, Fort Worth Detective
Roger SoRelle said.
   Tarrant County Jail officials were monitoring Green's cell and
activities closely after he tried to hang himself with a T-shirt
Thursday night.
   Swan identified the victims as Steven Fefferman, 28, an
advertising executive from KXAS-TV; Jeffrey L. Davis, 16, of Fort
Worth; Sandra Lorraine Bailey, 27, of Fort Worth; and a woman
identified only as ``Betty Jo.''
   The two males died of multiple stab wounds, police said.

   Spring snow fell Saturday across northeast Minnesota and
northwest Wisconsin, thunderstorms caused hail in Texas and floods
occurred in West Virginia and Ohio.
   In Duluth, Minn., 5 inches of snow fell Saturday morning, and
almost half of it melted by noon.
   Southwest Wyoming had snow showers.
   The Texas thunderstorms produced hail as big as three-fourths of
an inch, as well as a quarter-inch of rain in one hour, in
Galveston.
   Similar size hail fell in Indianapolis.
   Parts of West Virginia had flooding due to heavy rains. Around
Middlebourne, in the part of the state bordering Ohio, several
roads were closed and many were covered with debris.
   A flood warning continued over the Scioto River, which was
expected to crest at Piketon, Ohio, around noon Sunday at 3{ feet
above flood stage.
   A flood warning also was posted for the Miami River which was to

   Residents in the Soviet republic of Georgia have
beaten family members of army soldiers because they unfairly blame
the troops for bloody clashes with pro-independence demonstrators,
an army general said Saturday.
   At least 20 people died in the unrest earlier this month in
Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. Georgians say the troops attacked a
peaceful demonstration with shovels, clubs and harmful gases.
   Gen. I.N. Rodionov, commander of the Caucasus military district,
said Tbilisi residents are blaming Red Army soldiers for the clash,
and he strongly implied that troops of the Interior Ministry were
to blame.
   Rodionov, speaking on the evening news show Vremya, said wives
and children of Red Army soldiers have been beaten and their
apartments stoned in retaliation for the crackdown. He gave no
other details.
   He said Interior Ministry troops should have handled the
demonstration without the aid of Red Army soldiers and suggested
that ministry troops wear special uniforms so they can be
distinguished from the Red Army.
   He said the ministry troops also used the harmful gas that
dissidents claimed was nerve gas.
   The Georgian health minister said last week that troops used an
unidentified chemical that caused at least two of the deaths and
several serious injuries.
   Rodionov, like other Soviet officials, maintained the substance
used against demonstrators was tear gas. He also said he personally
opposed the use of troops to crush the demonstrations.
   Meanwhile, in other parts of the Caucasus region, plans for May
Day celebrations were canceled in Soviet Armenia for fear they
could turn into pro-independence demonstrations.
   The military commander of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, issued
a call for calm Saturday, asking residents not to allow themselves
to be incited into a confrontation with authorities, said Rafael
Popoyan, a newsman for the official radio station in Yerevan.
   Yerevan has been under curfew for more than six months to curb
ethnic conflicts that killed more than 90 people in Armenia and
neighboring Azerbaijan in 1988. Armenians are seeking to be
reunited with Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian region of
Azerbaijan.
   Leon Azruyan, of the official radio station in Yerevan, said
officials also cited the grim feelings left by the Armenian
earthquake for the cancellation of a May Day parade. An estimated
25,000 died in the December quake.
   In Azerbaijan, the official news agency Azerinform denied rumors
of new violence in the enclave of Nakhichevan, which borders
Armenia. Azerinform said the rumors were spread by people upset
about a border dispute over an orchard that surveyors determined
belongs to Armenia rather than Azerbaijan.
   The dispatch indicated that passions rose in the village of
Tsadarak, which lost the orchard, but there were no deaths or
injuries.

   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least 18
Palestinians Saturday in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab hospital
officials said, and a 14-year-old boy who Arabs said was shot by
Jewish settlers died, according to Israeli and Arab reports.
   The Israeli military command said a report from Gaza listed only
three wounded. It reported another two wounded in stone-throwing
clashes in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Tulkarem.
   Also Saturday, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens accused the PLO of
``trying to impose a rule of terror'' to sabotage an Israeli
proposal for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In the West Bank town of El Bireh, Palestinian assailants tried
to set fire to the house of the Israeli-appointed Arab mayor,
Hassan Tawil, and slightly damaged a door, the army command said.
   The PLO-linked underground leaders of the uprising have called
for the resignation of Israeli-appointed mayors. It was the second
attack on Tawil. On June 7, 1988, he was stabbed in the chest.
   In the West Bank town of Jericho, attackers firebombed and
burned a restaurant belonging to a Palestinian suspected of being a
pro-Israeli collaborator, the national news agency Itim said.
   Palestinians in the Gaza Strip defied an army curfew and
protested casualties in the seaside strip, home to 650,000
Palestinians.
   Merchants in Gaza shut their stores in a commercial strike to
commemorate the ``martyrs,'' or Palestinians killed by army
gunfire, Arab reports said.
   An Arab reporter in Gaza City said youths erected roadblocks,
burned tires and hung at least 20 Palestinian flags from electric
wires. The army clamped a curfew on several neighborhoods in the
city and on three refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, forcing 80,000
residents to stay inside their homes.
   But the curfew failed to prevent sporadic stone-throwing
clashes. In Gaza City's Sabra neighborhood, 100 people rushed to
the street, ``shouting the names of martyrs until the army
dispersed them with tear gas,'' a witness said.
   Hospital officials said they treated at least 18 Palestinians
who were wounded by troops during clashes in seven Gaza areas,
including a 9-year-old boy from the Jabaliya refugee camp who was
shot in the leg.
   At Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital, 14-year-old Nader Naim Dana
died of two gunshot wounds to the head suffered Friday during a
clash in the West Bank town of Hebron, Israel radio and Arab
reports said.
   Arab reports from Hebron said at the time that the boy was shot
by Jewish settlers. The army said it was investigating the shooting.
   Itim said police detained a 52-year-old Jewish settler for
questioning Saturday night on suspicion of involvement in the
shooting.
   It said the settler, a resident of Kiryat Arba near Hebron,
allegedly opened fire with his Uzi submachine gun after Palestinian
youths stoned his car in Hebron. His name was not given.
   Arens, speaking on Israel radio, said Palestinians themselves
were to blame for casualties among children and teen-agers.
   ``You have here not only a clash between two peoples ... but
also a clash between two civilizations. Facing us you find people
who have been raised with a tradition of fanaticism, brutality, of
lack of regard for human life _ I'd say lack of regard for their
own life,'' Arens said.
   Arens accused the Palestine Liberation Organization of trying to
sabotage an Israeli proposal for elections in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip by attacking Palestinians suspected of collaborating
with Israeli authorities.
   At least 40 suspected collaborators have been killed since the
December 1987 start of the anti-Israeli uprising. The rebellion has
claimed the lives of 456 Palestinians and 18 Israelis.
   ``People are being hacked to death by axes ....'' Arens said.
``A woman in Nablus was raped for three days, and after that her
arms were broken. People are burned alive, people are knifed,
people are being shot and the PLO is trying to impose a rule of
terror.''
   The election idea, put forward by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
during a visit to Washington this month, suggests negotiations with
elected Palestinian representatives on a period of limited
self-rule for the territories.
   Palestinian leaders in the occupied lands and the PLO reject the
proposal, saying elections can only be held after Israeli withdraws
from the territories.

<HEAD>Walesa Opens Opposition Campaign for June Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Saturday
opened the opposition's campaign for June 4 elections at a rally
outside the Lenin Shipyard attended by more than 200 candidates.
   ``In our country something must change and you must be the
ones'' to make those changes, Walesa told the candidates at the
rally in Gdansk, the birthplace of his newly-legalized labor
movement.
   He noted there is only five weeks before the election and urged
the candidates to begin campaigning immediately.
   The elections will the the first in Poland with opposition
candidates participating since 1947. Runoff elections are set for
June 18.
   A political bargain reached with the ruling Communist Party on
April 5 again legalized Solidarity and allowed the opposition to
run for 161 seats in the 460-member Sejm, or parliament.
   The agreement also creates a new 100-member Senate with
opposition candidates permitted to run for all the seats.
   Almost all of the 261 opposition candidates traveled to Gdansk
for the opening rally at the Lenin Shipyard. The shipyard became
the birthplace of Solidarity during nationwide strikes in the fall
of 1980.
   Solidarity was suspended in December 1981 and subsequently
outlawed by parliament.
   On the train carrying many of the candidates on the 3{-hour
journey from Warsaw to the port city of Gdansk, candidates and
their advisers huddled in the compartments and exchanged notes with
other groups.
   In one compartment, Adam Michnik, a historian and candidate for
the Sejm from Katowice, laughed at an article in the Communist
Party newspaper Trybuna Ludu that characterized him as an
``extemist element'' in the opposition.
   ``They are making my campaign for me,'' he said.
   The candidates were approved last week at a meeting in Warsaw by
the Solidarity-led national Citizens Committee, which is
coordinating the campaign.
   Communist Party candidates are to be announced after a party
conference Thursday and Friday.

<HEAD>Western Union Sells Pentagon Hotline To Swiss Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hot line, the link set up
between Washington and Moscow more than 25 years ago to reduce the
risk of an accidental war, has fallen into foreign hands.
   The hot line was part of a division Western Union Corp. sold
last week to Swiss-owned Tele-Columbus USA of New York for $56
million as part of a reorganization, Western Union said.
   In a deal approved by the Federal Communications Commission,
Tele-Columbus acquired the private-line service of ITT World
Communications, a company acquired 16 months ago by Western Union.
   Western Union, which is based in this northern New Jersey city,
kept the division's telex and international cablegram businesses.
   Tele-Columbus is owned by Motor-Columbus AG, a
telecommunications and cable television company based in Baden,
Switzerland, Western Union spokesman Warren Bechtel said Saturday.
   The line, which consists of satellite connections and ground
lines, is secure because messages are encoded as they travel
between the United States and the Soviet Union, Navy Lt. Cmdr.
James Cudla, a Navy spokesman, was quoted as saying in Saturday
editions of the Star-Ledger of Newark.
   Contrary to popular belief, the hot line is not a red phone
sitting on the president's desk, Pentagon spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi
said Saturday.
   Hot-line messages are transmitted from a small room in the
Pentagon housing computer terminals. They instantly appear on
Soviet screens, and can be printed out at the rate of 1,800 words a
minute. Five years ago, the ability to send facsimiles was added.
   Voice conversations are considered more likely to be
misunderstood or mistranslated, Ms. Bodanyi said.
   ITT Corp. set up the hot line in 1963 after President Kennedy
expressed concern after the Cuban missile crisis about the amount
of time it took to contact Soviet leaders.
   U.S. and Soviet officials send test messages in their own
languages, alternating each hour, to make sure the line operates.
The tests are culled from literature and encyclopedias.
   The sale drew criticism from Rep. Matthew Rinaldo of New Jersey,
the ranking Republican on the House telecommunications subcommittee.
   Rinaldo said he was concerned that the link, ``which could make
the difference between war and peace, is controlled by a third
party.'' He said he would call for a hearing on the issue.
   ``It's time we began taking a hard look at how foreign ownership
of vital services affects our national security,'' Rinaldo said.

   Federal agents seized more than a ton of cocaine
flown here in 40 cardboard boxes loaded on a Brazilian jet, and
arrested two men, officials said Saturday.
   The boxes were discovered during a routine check of the Varig
Brazilian Airlines jet's cargo following its arrival Friday at
Miami International Airport from Rio de Janeiro, said Customs
Service spokeswoman Cliff Stallings.
   Agents allowed the 2,200-pound cocaine cargo to be transferred
from a Varig warehouse to a rented truck, then followed it to the
Miami suburb of Kendall, where they seized the truck and arrested
the driver, Jose Machado, 55, of Uruguay, officials said. Warly
Dasilva, 47, of Brazil was arrested later.
   Dasilva and Machado were held on charges of drug conspiracy and
importation, Stallings said.
   The 40 cardboard cartons contained wooden crates that in turn
were stuffed with cocaine, Stallings said. There were no marks or
numbers on the cargo, which was not listed on the flight manifest.
   Customs seized the Varig DC-10 and held it until the airline
posted a letter of credit Friday night, Stallings said.
   The airline was assessed a penalty of $37 million, roughly
$1,000 an ounce. However, Varig has the right to appeal and the
dollar figure frequently is cut to a fraction of the original fine.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three British chains took the two top-selling
brands of baby food off their shelves Saturday as police
investigated more than 300 reports of contamination.
   In northern England, a new report of food tampering surfaced
when a family was taken to a hospital for treatment after eating
hamburgers contaminated with mercury, police said.
   Tesco, a supermarket chain with more than 375 stores, and Boots,
a drugstore chain with more than 1,000 stores nationwide, said they
would halt sales of baby food made by H.J. Heinz Co. and Cow and
Gate Ltd.
   ``We decided to take action now rather than wait, in the
interests of consumer safety,' said John Eyre, Boots director for
corporate affairs.
   The Asda food chain also said it was withdrawing all baby food
from the two companies that was packaged in glass jars.
   Police said most of the reports of contamination were hoaxes or
false alarms. Scotland Yard said several arrests have been made.
   Only two cases apparently were the work of an extortionist, who
demanded up to $1.7 million from the Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz
Co., police said.
   The family that ate the tainted hamburgers needed hospital
treatment but suffered only ``mild ill effects,'' said a police
spokesman on condition of anonymity. The family is from Heswall
near Liverpool.
   Police said they believed the hamburgers may have been tampered
with.
   Local authorities said they were beginning an urgent search to
find who purchased 11 other packages of the frozen hamburgers from
the same store in the past two weeks.
   Reports of taintings with glass shards, pieces of razor blades
and caustic soda began April 7. Most reports involved Heinz or Cow
and Gate baby products, but several were in other brands of baby
food.
   In Springfield, Ill., three grocery stores operated by
Shop-N-Save removed Heinz baby food products from their shelves
after a woman reported finding straight pins in jars of the food.
   Police said Saturday it could be a ``copycat'' incident of the
tampering cases in Britain.
   ``It could be related,'' said Springfield Police Cmdr. Kirk
Robinson. ``We're not ruling anything out.''
   ``There is no reason to think this (Springfield case) is
anything but an isolated incident,'' said Harry Carroll, a
spokesman for Heinz.
   Cow and Gate, owned by Nutricia of the Netherlands, said
Saturday it would follow Heinz in introducing new packaging for
baby food in the coming weeks. The two companies share 80 percent
of Britain's baby food market.
   A 14-month-old boy, Matthew Cookson, was the latest casualty of
the potentially deadly contamination. He was hospitalized in
Manchester with glass in his stomach after eating a jar of baby
yogurt that was found to contain glass.
   In three earlier cases, two mothers cut their fingers on glass
found in baby food and a 9-month-old girl cut her mouth when she
bit a piece of razor blade in yogurt.

   A three-year contract calling for a 12
percent increase in minimum wages and residuals for television and
theatrical work was overwhelmingly ratified by the Screen Actors
Guild, officials reported.
   The pact, calling for annual raises of 4 percent, was approved
by the union's members 97 percent to 3 percent, the guild and the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists said in a joint
statement released Friday.
   With 32,371 valid ballots returned by the April 28 voting
deadline, 31,365 members voted in favor of the contract and 1,006
were opposed.
   The new contract, which takes effect July 1, also includes what
officials called a significant increase in producers' contributions
to the guild's health plan, a new minimum scale for ``top of the
show'' TV series guest stars, and increases in residuals for free
TV shows released to basic cable and foreign distribution.
   The settlement came a month before contract negotiations
normally begin, SAG and AFTRA officials said.
   Both sides put together a contract proposal early to avoid long
and contentious negotiating efforts that normally occur before a
contract expires, officials said.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Protesters Arrested in Noisy Confrontations at Clinics</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to UPDATE arrest total, ADD Virginia.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of hymn-singing anti-abortion protesters were arrested
Saturday as they and slogan-chanting counterdemonstrators vied for
attention at entrances to clinics around the country.
   Police reported a total of at least 1,396 arrests in Arizona,
Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Texas and Virginia. California also had a large protest.
   No violence was reported, but a woman driving up to a San
Antonio abortion clinic struck a Baptist preacher who was leading
prayers in the driveway, police said. Police ticketed the
18-year-old woman for reckless driving and the preacher was taken
to a hospital, where his condition was reported only as stable.
   Anti-abortion demonstrations were planned in 65 cities from
Anchorage, Alaska, to Gulfport, Miss., said Operation Rescue
spokesman Bob Nolte, whose group coordinated the protests, said in
New York.
   In the group's widest previous protests on Oct. 29, Nolte said,
2,600 people were arrested for blocking the entrances to clinics in
32 cities.
   On Friday, 334 anti-abortion demonstrators had been arrested in
six states, Nolte said.
   In suburban Detroit, Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women, appeared Saturday at an abortion clinic to
denounce activists who were blocking doors.
   ``We call it Operation Bully, because they bully women,'' Yard
said.
   Patricia Ireland, national vice president of NOW, said she
coordinated the effort to get counterdemonstrators to Operation
Rescue's protest sites, then went to one herself in College Park,
Md. She said anti-abortion protesters tried to break into a human
corridor the abortion rights forces formed at a clinic entrance,
but it was ``no more rough than a game of Red Rover.''
   ``We all learned it as children. The way to stop bullying is to
stand up to it. That is what we've done and will do all across the
country every time these anti-abortion extremists attempt to take
away the rights of women,'' she said.
   Operation Rescue protesters said they hope to persuade the U.S.
Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision
legalizing abortion. The court heard arguments last week on a
Missouri case the Bush administration has said should be used to
overturn the landmark decision, but the justices have not yet ruled.
   Outside a clinic in the Boston suburb of Brookline, one of
hundreds of pro-choice advocates who outnumbered Operation Rescue
members attributed her side's good turnout to publicity given to
the Supreme Court hearing.
   ``People who have sat home ... said to themselves `My God, we
worked for this stuff 20 years ago to stop the deaths of young
women,''' Kathy Ayres said.
   Anti-abortion protesters sang hymns, held pictures of fetuses
aloft and, in some cases, clutched rosaries while kneeling to pray.
The pro-choice contingent shouted such slogans as ``OK, hear our
voice, Massachusetts is pro-choice.''
   In Columbus, Ohio, at least 10 abortion protesters were charged
with disorderly conduct, including four who temporarily chained
themselves by the neck to a 55-gallon barrel filled with concrete
and rolled into the doorway of a clinic.
   Outside the Planned Parenthood clinic in Shrewsbury, N.J., where
police reported at least 100 arrests, executive director Phyllis
Kinsler said the protesters ``just absolutely shoved video cameras
in people's faces'' as the patients came in for their appointments.
   Bob Pawson, a spokesman for the protesters, said the videotapes
would not be released for privacy reasons, but were necessary to
counter claims by pro-choice advocates that Operation Rescue
protests are ineffective.
   In Boulder, Colo., where Operation Rescue kept secret the
location of its protest until Saturday morning, about 300
anti-abortion protesters and 30 counterdemonstrators turned out at
the Boulder Valley Women's Health Center.

   Two young Soviets seeking political
asylum in the United States say they began scheming two years ago
to defect, and forged documents that enabled them to travel to
Little Diomede Island in the Bering Strait last weekend.
   ``It was not possible to make it in a legal way,'' said Anatoly
Tkachenko, a 24-year-old journalist from Moscow.
   ``We are very sorry that we kind of marred and soured the
ceremony at Little Diomede, but there was no other way,'' Tkachenko
added.
   Tkachenko and Alexander Genkin, also 24 and from Moscow,
defected last Sunday while they were on Little Diomede for the
signing of a protocol designed to ease travel restrictions between
Alaska and Siberia.
   Both men worked for a monthly Moscow newspaper that serves the
government's international affairs ministry and the Moscow state
college for international affairs.
   When they learned a Soviet delegation would be traveling to
Little Diomede for the signing ceremony, they forged papers
authorizing them to cover the event for the newspaper, Tkachenko
said at a news conference Friday.
   The pair typed an application, obtained a special stamp to
verify it had been authorized, and took it to the headquarters of
the Bering Bridge Expedition.
   The expedition is a team of Soviet and American adventurers
skiing and dog-sledding its way along the Siberian and Alaskan
coasts. The signing ceremony coincided with their arrival at the
international dateline in the Bering Strait between Little Diomede
Island and the Soviet island of Big Diomede about three miles away.
   ``We were very anxious and apprehensive about our even taking
part in this delegation'' because of the forged permission,
Tkachenko said. If the two had been found out, ``I think we would
have been in prison for three or four years,'' he said.
   Both men called in sick to explain their absence while traveling
to Alaska, he said.
   Tkachenko, who speaks English fluently, did most of the talking
at the news conference and translated for Genkin, who speaks very
little English.
   Tkachenko said he doubts the defections will affect U.S.-Soviet
relations or hamper efforts to open the Alaska-Siberia border.
   He said neither man told relatives or anyone else about the plan
to defect, and said he didn't think Soviet authorities would
retaliate against their parents.
   Tkachenko said both men would like to continue working as
journaists if their requests for asylum are approved.
   ``I am very interested in this field, especially in American TV
journalism,'' Tkachenko said. ``It was my idea for a very long time
to be somehow involved in this field, you know. Maybe I can get a
job at any company or channel as an expert in Soviet affairs
because I studied international affairs.''
   He said Genkin wants to work in print journalism once he learns
English.
   Tkachenko said the absence of censorship in the United States
was a bigger attraction than money.
   ``There is still a one-party system of censorhip and an
unequivocal belief in Lenin's ideas, even with Gorbachev,'' he said.
   ``I think if you are a journalist and you wish to work in
freedom ... to be creative in your job, that's the most important
thing for you,'' Tkachenko said. ``Not just the money or the
possibility to live in a big house. It's not the main thing for me,
and I think for Alexander too.''
   Tkachenko said he ultimately wants to live in New York or
Washington.
   Gary Johnson, regional director of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said it will be several weeks before a
decision is made on their requests for asylum.

<TEXT>
   Earl Hamrick, the law in Twiggs
County for 48 years, was compared Saturday with Marshal Matt Dillon
of ``Gunsmoke'' in a ceremony honoring him as the nation's
longest-serving sheriff.
   A marble marker was unveiled on the courthouse lawn as part of
the tribute to Hamrick in this central Georgia town of about 9,300
people. The marker features a bas relief of Hamrick's face and a
brief history of his career.
   Hamrick, who retired Dec. 31 and is believed to be 86 years old,
thanked the people of Twiggs County for electing him over the years.
   ``I also want to thank every law enforcement agency in Georgia
and in the United States,'' he said. ``I worked with all of them,
and I had the best relationship with everybody.
   ``I go to conventions and Yankees ask me how come I keep getting
elected,'' he said. ``I tell them, `Just being a dang good sheriff
is all I know!'''
   U.S. District Judge Duross Fitzpatrick had high praise for
Hamrick.
   ``He was capable of doing the job, he liked to do the job, he
had good humor and he was utterly fearless,'' Fitzpatrick said.
   ``Earl represents the best of politics in America,'' Fitzpatrick
said, adding that Hamrick's retirement was like Dodge City's Dillon
riding off into the sunset.
   Upson County Sheriff Merrill Greathouse, an official with the
National Sheriff's Association, said he couldn't find another
sheriff who had served 48 years. He said the next highest was a
sheriff who served 36 years.
   Hamrick was appointed sheriff emeritus for the state of Georgia
by Gov. Joe Frank Harris.
   Former U.S. Sen. Herman Talmadge, D-Ga., a longtime friend of
the Hamrick family, said that during Hamrick's 48 years of service
there was not one murder that went unsolved.
   ``I doubt there's another sheriff in the country who can say
that,'' Talmadge said.

   A woman who battled cancer long enough to
watch her son perform with his high school marching band at Walt
Disney World has died.
   Mary Jane Whitman, 50, died Friday at the Hospice of St. John in
Lakewood.
   A former president of the booster club of the Highlands Ranch
High School marching band, Whitman fulfilled her dream of watching
the 90-member group perform at Disney World's Epcot Center on April
16. A son, Shane Whitman, plays tenor saxophone in the band.
   Whitman had planned to chaperone the band on the trip to
Orlando, Fla., but her health deteriorated seriously in December
and she entered the hospice in Lakewood.
   But band members arranged through developer Mission Viejo and
the hospice for Whitman to make the challenging trip.
   Realizing the end of her battle with cancer was near, the
students on Monday tucked a pink teddy bear under her arm and said
goodbye.
   Whitman left a husband, two sons, a daughter and a grandson.

   Eric ``Big Daddy'' Nord, known as the
``king of the beat generation'' and whose hungry i nightspot in San
Francisco showcased Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl, has died after
several years of failing health. He was 69.
   ``Nord was a poet and a philosopher who constantly sought an
audience willing to hear his message,'' said Telemachos A. Greanias
of Los Gatos, a friend who wrote a tribute to Nord after his death
Wednesday at the Skyline Convalescent Home.
   ``His words were angry, but his tone and meaning were reform in
the interest of humanity.''
   Born Harry Pastor to a German industrialist and his American
wife, Nord's family came to California and he quickly became
involved in the beat culture.
   In 1950, Nord opened the hungry i, a music and comedy club that
featured rebellious satirists like Bruce and Sahl. He later left
San Francisco, blaming his move on cigarette smoke at the
nightclub, drugs and misguided beat generation leaders.
   After an abortive attempt to set up a vegetarian commune in
Guatemala, Nord opened a string of coffee houses in California.
   Dubbed ``Big Daddy'' because of his 6-foot-8, 400-pound frame,
Nord spent his later years in Los Gatos, just south of San Jose.
His death followed several years of illness related to his weight
as well as heart and kidney disease, Greanias said.
   Nord is survived by three children, three brothers, six
grandchildren and a nephew.

   Donald Deskey, an innovative industrial
designer whose credits range from the interiors of New York's Radio
City Music Hall to packaging for a variety of household products,
died Saturday. He was 94.
   Deskey died of pneumonia at Indian River Memorial Hospital, said
Barbara Smith, a night supervisor at the hospital.
   ``Donald Deskey was among the leading figures to introduce
modern design in the United States in the late 1920s,'' said David
A. Hanks, who with Jennifer Tober wrote ``Donald Deskey: Decorative
Designs and Interiors.''
   Deskey, whose career spanned more than half a century, was
associated with the Procter and Gamble Co. for 20 years. His
package design for the company's Crest toothpaste has not changed
since its introduction in the 1950s.
   An adept interior designer as well, he created apartments for
such prominent clients as Adam Gimbel in 1927, Abby Aldrich
Rockefeller in 1929 and Helena Rubinstein in 1930.
   His 1932 design for the interiors of Radio City are widely
hailed as an Art Deco masterpiece.
   Born in Blue Earth, Minn., Deskey had homes in Scotland, Jamaica
and Florida as well as an apartment in Manhattan. He retired to
Vero Beach in 1975.
   He is survived by his wife, Katherine, two sons and two
grandchildren.

of ships steaming into New York harbor Saturday, heralding the
start of weekend celebrations marking the 200th anniversary of
George Washington's inauguration.
   Thousands of people lined the shores of Governors Island,
Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey and Battery Park, standing
eight to 10 deep, despite a chill in the air and the threat of rain.
   ``I wouldn't miss this _ it's for our first president,'' said
George James, 72, of the Bronx. ``I was in the Navy, the WPA and
worked for the post office. That's my whole life for this country.
Everything is right here today.''
   At night, a 20-minute firework display lit up a cloudy, gray
sky. A drizzle stopped right before the pyrotechnics began. And, as
if on cue, right after the fireworks ended, the rain started again.
   At South Street Seaport, 4,000 to 5,000 spectators watched the
fireworks display with brilliant colors that reflected off the East
River and the glass towers of Wall Street.
   Earlier in the day, 13 military ships representing the 13
original states entered the harbor from the south under the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. From the north, down the Hudson River,
came 50 commercial and civilian ships, each with a state flag.
   Cannons in Battery Park exchanged 13-gun salutes with the ships
entering the harbor.
   The show of force was punctuated by a solemn moment when 47
white balloons were set aloft to honor the 47 sailors who died
earlier this month aboard the battleship USS Iowa in a gun turret
explosion and fire April 19.
   ``We feel profound grief,'' said Mayor Edward Koch, who said the
day's ceremony was dedicated to the sailors.
   Members of the environmental group Greenpeace and a group called
the Coalition for a Nuclear-Free Harbor launched a ``peace fleet''
to protest the Navy's plan for a port on Staten Island that could
be used by nuclear-armed ships.
   The protesters' fleet consisted of the 106-foot sloop
Clearwater, a 19-foot Greenpeace boat and five motorized dinghies.
They were emblazoned with anti-nuclear banners with such messages
as ``No Nuke Port,'' ``You Can't Evacuate NYC'' and ``Just Say
No.'' Authorities kept protesters' boats away from the larger ships.
   ``The bicentennial ought to be celebrated with fireworks, not
the nuclear firepower carried aboard these ships,'' said Michael
Immerso of the coalition.
   Spectators said they had other things on their minds.
   ``We came to see the Statue of Liberty but you can't get in,''
said Dan Baker, 28, of Dunellen, N.J. ``Now, we've got to watch
these big boats, which isn't too bad. The only thing that caught us
off guard was $5 for two small hot dogs and a Coke.''
   Saturday's fireworks were a prelude to Sunday's main event, a
re-enactment of the 1789 inauguration, starring two Georges _ a man
from Philadelphia acting the part of Washington, and President Bush.
   The re-enactment will be followed by a parade through lower
Manhattan, including elements of the original 1789 procession and
the centennial parade of 1889.
   This weekend is the culmination of a string of celebrations that
began 13 years ago with the bicentennial of the Declaration of
Independence.
   Since then, there have been bicentennials of all major
Revolutionary battles, the surrender at Yorktown, the Treaty of
Paris, the writing and passing of the Constitution, and other
smaller celebrations.
   Saturday's parade of ships _ the biggest in New York since the
Statue of Liberty's centennial in 1986 _ took place under
battleship-gray skies, with a crowd in Battery Park peering out
into the harbor while listening to patriotic songs played by an
Army band.
   Sunday's festivities will begin with a thanksgiving service at
St. Paul's Chapel of the Parish of Trinity Church, which was built
in 1766.
   George Washington prayed at the church following his
inauguration, then worshiped there for the next two years while New
York was the nation's temporary capital. President Bush was to
attend Sunday morning's service.
   A special platform and large-screen television were erected for
the noon re-enactment at Federal Hall in lower Manhattan.
   Washington's stand-in, William Sommerfield, will take the oath
of office using the same Bible that Washington used, which Bush
used in his inauguration Jan. 21.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Package of Oil-Spill Legislation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A package of bills aimed at protecting
Alaska from another devastating oil spill like the one that fouled
Prince William Sound was passed by the state Senate with little
trouble Saturday.
   Reacting to the largest oil spill in the nation's history, the
Republican-led Senate acted with unusual speed to move the six
bills through the chamber and to the House.
   However, it appeared unlikely that the Democrat-controlled House
would approve the entire package before adjournment, which is
scheduled for May 9.
   The Senate action came five weeks after the tanker Exxon Valdez
struck a reef, spewing more than 10 million gallons of crude oil
into the fish- and wildlife-rich sound.
   The Senate bills would increase civil fines for spill damage;
impose a surcharge on oil producers to boost the state's
spill-response fund; prevent oil companies from deducting spill
costs from their oil-production taxes; require the state to create
spill contingency plans; establish a spill-response office and
cleanup corps; and create a commission to investigate the Exxon
Valdez spill.
   More than a dozen other spill-related bills are still pending in
both chambers. House Speaker Sam Cotten, a Democrat, said House
members have been studying the bills and will decide early this
week which ones will get top priority.
   ``It isn't like we've been waiting around to see what the Senate
did,'' he said.
   Sen. John Binkley, a Republican, voted against all the bills
passed Saturday, except for the investigation commission measure.
``I think that we're acting too hastily on these issues,'' he said.
   Gov. Steve Cowper said Friday that he, too, favors a slower
approach to oil-spill legislation.
   ``I don't think that we need major legislation in this session,
aside from the funding mechanisms and aside from the body that will
be investigating this incident on the part of the state,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Tawana Brawley on Saturday denied a newspaper
report that her claims of abduction and rape by a gang of white men
were a fabrication.
   The black teen-ager's claims made national headlines and her
family's advisers kept Miss Brawley and her mother from appearing
before a grand jury, claiming the state investigation was a coverup
to protect the rapists.
   But the grand jury concluded last year that Miss Brawley had
faked being raped.
   Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28, 1987, in a plastic garbage bag,
smeared with feces and with racial epithets scrawled on her body.
At the time, she was 15.
   Newsday reported Thursday that Miss Brawley had admitted to her
boyfriend that she and her mother made up the story to keep the
mother's lover from beating the teen-ager.
   But Miss Brawley told a news conference, ``My father has never
beaten me,'' referring to her mother's live-in boyfriend.
   ``I am not afraid of him,'' she said. ``I love him with all of
my heart.''
   The newspaper said Miss Brawley made the admission two weeks ago
to Daryl T. Rodriguez, 19, who became her boyfriend a few weeks
before the events of late November.
   Miss Brawley would not answer questions about the newspaper
report but said of Rodriguez, ``I was really shocked he would say
something like this.''

<HEAD>Bush Pokes Fun at Self at White House Correspondents' Dinner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush celebrated his 100th day in
office Saturday by bringing along comedian Garry Shandling to help
poke fun at himself at the White House Correspondents' Association
dinner.
   ``I'll tell you how nifty, how swell _ gosh, what fun it is to
be president,'' Bush joked in a speech to the reporters, editors
and their guests.
   Shandling said Bush had pulled him from a line at a White House
tour earlier in the day and asked him to perform at the dinner. ``I
thought he was joking because I'd really never taken him seriously
before,'' the comedian said.
   Bush promised the reporters some hard news: ``My first nominee
to the Supreme Court _ John Tower. What we need is a little
justice,'' he said, referring to the diminutive former Texas
senator who was rejected as secretary of defense.
   The president drew his biggest laugh by telling the audience he
was relieved that ``there won't be time tonight for my slide shows
of the trip to Honduras.'' Bush has refused recently to comment on
his trip to Honduras as vice president during a time when,
according to documents released during Oliver North's Iran-Contra
trial, the Reagan administration was seeking aid for the Nicaraguan
rebels from other countries at a time U.S. aid was outlawed by
Congress.
   The president said he was growing accustomed to being tagged
``Barbara's husband.''
   Noting some reporters have said his rigorous public schedule was
keeping them busier than former President Reagan did, Bush said,
``That's the first time that I have ever been accused of keeping
anybody awake.''
   And he joked that at least the incoming president of the
correspondents' group, Johanna Neuman of USA Today, ``can blame her
troubles on her predecessor.'' Some Bush aides were chastised
recently for comparing his work habits too favorably with Reagan's.
   Shandling said he had told Bush he was happy to appear, but ``I
hope you won't ask me to do that State of the Union thing.''
   Four White House correspondents were honored at the dinner.
Jeremiah O'Leary of the Washington Times and the outgoing president
of the group, was given the Merriman Smith Memorial Award for
reporting under deadline pressure.
   Owen Ullmann of Knight-Ridder received the Aldo Beckman Memorial
Award for journalistic excellence.
   Christopher Drew of the Chicago Tribune received the Edgar Allan
Poe Award for fairness and objectivity in reporting on subjects of
national or regional importance. Jim Angle of National Public
Radio, treasurer of the correspondents' group, was given honorable
mention for the award.

<TEXT>
   Firefighters retreated from
a wall of flames about 80 feet high Saturday as they battled a
forest fire that has charred 10,500 acres, forestry officials said.
   ``There are times that the flames are so high that they are
pulling back and can't work the fire directly because it's so
dangerous,'' said Cheryl Summers, spokeswoman for the Florida
Division of Forestry in Tallahassee.
   The fire was headed east but switched Saturday to a northernly
direction, forcing the 165 firefighters to redraw their battle
lines, said Bill Scaramellino, forestry spokesman.
   ``The fire more or less blew up,'' Scaramellino said.
   The wall of 80-foot flames was a half mile long and within a
half mile of State Road 2, which is two miles south of the
Florida-Georgia border.
   Firefighters were trying to control the fire by dropping water
on it from aircraft. The strategy wasn't very effective because the
flames were so high, Ms. Summers said.
   Firefighters from Georgia and Arkansas have joined the battle.
   The fire, reported Wednesday, apparently started when the
transmisson in a logging vehicle broke down and sent off sparks
that started the fire in land adjacent to the Osceola National
Forest, Ms. Summers said.
   No structures have been threatened by the fire and no one has
been seriously hurt, Scaramellino said.

   U.S. senators on Saturday encouraged
Mexico to continue efforts to combat drug trafficking and modernize
the economy during bilateral talks on debt, drugs and democracy.
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., praised President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's anti-drug campaign. In return, he said, the
United States would support Mexico's efforts to cut payments on its
$107.4 billion foreign debt.
   ``It is a seamless garment when you start talking about
confidence in a government,'' Dodd said in an interview.
   The delegations issued a communique after the two-day meeting of
U.S. and Mexican lawmakers ended Saturday night.
   They said they were prepared to ``promote the establishment of a
Mexico-U.S. intergovernmental consultive commission for the control
of narcotic and psychotropic substance abuse.''
   The sides also ``urged their respective governments to support
an international drug summit of the presidents of the Western
Hemisphere.''
   Mexico's delegation called for urgent measures to help Mexico
cut its debt payments and the U.S. group suggested Mexico broaden
the alternatives it is presenting to bankers in debt negotiations.
   On Friday, the opening day of the 28th annual meeting, Dodd read
a letter to Salinas signed by 68 U.S. senators praising the Mexican
president for his commitment to fight drug trafficking.
   The U.S. Senate votes in May over whether Mexico is adequately
fighting the illicit narcotics trade. Both Dodd and Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, said they expected a positive vote.
   Dodd said many U.S. lawmakers were impressed with Salinas'
efforts to streamline the Mexican economy and liberalize its
foreign trade.
   ``He is moving at a pace that's impressive. There is this very
strong feeling about his government,'' Dodd said.
   Gramm was more skeptical.
   ``I want to be shown. I've heard all the good words before,'' he
said in an interview.
   But Gramm added he would give Salinas ``the benefit of the
doubt.''
   Mexico is negotiating with foreign creditor banks to slice its
annual debt servicing bill by at least $7 billion. The country paid
$9 billion in interest and $5 billion in principal in 1988 and
servicing will reach an anticipated $16 billion this year.
   At this Pacific seaside resort, the American delegation
encountered Mexican lawmakers representing opposition parties,
which are amply represented in Mexico's Congress for the first time.
   Opposition delegates buttonholed their U.S. counterparts to
lodge complaints that democracy has yet to develop south of the
border.
   ``We have to start a genuine dialogue among real
parliamentarians, among people speaking for the people, '' said
Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a leftist opposition senator.
   Salinas, the keynote speaker Friday, took note of the new
opposition presence in Mexican politics. Nearly a third of Mexico's
36-person delegation came from opposition parties.
   But Teresa Otono Gurca, a federal deputy from the conservative
National Action Party, or PAN, said the U.S. delegation was more
interested in encouraging Salinas, especially on waging the war
against drugs, than in listening to opposition challenges to the
legitimacy of Salinas' election last July.
   ``They think that without the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, there is no stability in Mexico,'' Otono said of the
American lawmakers.
   Delegates from both countries characterized the meeting as open
and frank.

   Voters on Saturday rejected a plan to
overhaul Louisiana's tax system that had been heralded by Gov.
Buddy Roemer as a chance to end the state's lengthy recession.
   ``We won't quit. That's my final message to everybody out there
tonight. It's worth fighting for. Let's keep fighting,'' Roemer
said after the votes were counted.
   With 3,181 of the state's 3,285 precincts reporting, about 97
percent, the proposed constitutional amendment to authorize the
Legislature to change the tax system was rejected 531,392, or 55
percent, to 432,483, or 45 percent.
   About 45 percent of the state's registered voters turned out,
said Darrell Glasscock, a spokesman for the secretary of state.
   The plan had been condemned by opponents as a huge tax hike.
   Under Roemer's package, the tax base would have been shifted by
putting more of a load on individuals through the income tax,
cutting sales taxes and giving businesses incentive to move to the
state and expand.
   The plan also included a $1.4 billion program to improve
highways, airports and shipping ports that would be funded by a
gasoline tax increase of 4 cents a gallon.
   Defeat of the plan means the Legislature will have to cut more
than $600 million from an already tight budget, which Roemer has
said is impossible.
   After conceding the plan had lost, Roemer said he would meet
with legislative leaders to determine the next step for the budget.
He said earlier that he would meet with Louisiana's business
leaders no matter what the outcome.
   State Rep. David Duke, an outspoken critic of the plan, said,
``This is going to make a real change in Louisiana.''
   Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader elected to the House in
February on an anti-tax plank, said the state should reduce waste,
tighten spending and make major changes in its social programs
instead of revising its tax system.
   ``After fighting tremendous odds, after fighting tremendous
money, after fighting tremendous political influence and power,
finally, ladies and gentlemen, you did it again,'' Duke told
supporters in his Metairie district.
   Jefferson Parish Assessor Lawrence Chehardy, another opponent,
said voters rejected the package because they did not believe that
state government ``has its house in order.''
   Chehardy said the vote had negative political implications for
the governor. ``I certainly think up to this point it was a
referendum on Buddy Roemer. The governor made it that way,''
Chehardy said.
   Roemer pushed the plan in a blitz of radio and television spots
financed by more than $1.2 million from backers. The governor
touted it as a way to create jobs in a state that has the nation's
highest unemployment rate and to end Louisiana's dependence on the
oil industry.
   Backers said the state puts too much of its tax burden on
business, driving away potential new industries and forcing
cutbacks and shutdowns among existing businesses.
   But opponents said most of the tax breaks would be enjoyed by
the state's 1,000 largest corporations, many of which are not
labor-intensive, and contended new jobs would not be created.
   The plan would cost an extra $126 million over the current tax
load. But opponents pointed out that as of July 1, the increase in
the tax load would be $526 million.
   The Legislature approved a one-year sales tax increase of $500
million last summer to avoid government bankruptcy. The increase,
which was achieved by canceling longtime exemptions on purchases of
food and utilities, expires July 1.
   Roemer's plan kept about $400 million of that tax on a permanent
basis.

   President Bush says he wants to go ahead with
a controversial deal with Japan for joint development and
production of the new FSX jetfighter, despite congressional concern
over loss of American jobs and technology.
   Bush, announcing on Friday the agreement to make an advanced
version of the U.S. F-16 for deployment by Japan in the late 1990s,
declared that the deal was ``in the strategic and commercial
interests of the United States.''
   ``And we weighed this matter from the standpoint of trade, of
our industrial growth and technology transfer, as well as strategic
and foreign policy considerations,'' the president said.
   The announcement was made the same day the Office of Trade
Representative released a report listing Japan as one of the worst
users of trade barriers and, according to published reports,
recommended sanctions for refusing to open its markets to U.S.-made
cellular phones and mobile radios.

   Pope John Paul II opened his
fifth visit to Africa by saying he was willing to meet with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but that obstacles prevent him from
making a papal tour of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev is to travel to Italy in November, and a visit to the
Vatican would be the first ever between a pope and a Soviet
Communist chief.
   En route Friday to this island nation off southeast Africa, the
pope said he would meet Gorbachev ``with great respect as the head
of state, the head of a system.''
   But, the pontiff added, he would be unable to visit the Soviet
Union because of continuing problems between the Roman Catholic
church and state that dates from the repression of Ukrainian
Catholics in 1946 by the late dictator Joseph Stalin.

   The decision by Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins to wait until 1990 to resume production of a gas needed for
nuclear warheads shows clearly that supplies of the gas are not as
tight as the government once claimed, critics say.
   The Pentagon asserted last fall that unless production resumed
by this summer the nuclear weapons factories would face a shortage
of tritium, a scarce, highly radioactive gas used to boost the
explosive power of nuclear warheads.
   But critics have said they believe the earlier warnings about a
tritium crisis were aimed at galvanizing congressional support for
the Energy Department's proposal to spend $6.8 billion to build two
new tritium-producing reactors.
   ``That whole scenario was orchestrated for political purposes by
certain people in the Pentagon,'' Chris Paine, an aide to Sen.
Edward Kennedy on nuclear defense issues, said in an interview
Friday. ``It's not as serious as they suggested.''

   On the first observance of Workers Memorial Day, the
government's record on worker safety was criticized, a bugler
played ``Taps,'' and roll calls were read of the hundreds of people
who died on the job in the United States last year.
   From northern Maine to southern California and Honolulu, workers
paused Friday to remember those killed in job-related accidents.
The events were organized by labor unions to highlight workplace
safety.
   The unions chose Friday because it is the 19th anniversary of
the founding of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
   An estimated 10,000 people are killed each year on the job. The
jobs that carry the highest risk of fatal injury, according to the
government, are in mining, transportation, construction and
agriculture.

   In a major concession to a student movement for
democracy, senior officials met Saturday with student leaders to
discuss their demands. Protest leaders, however, denounced the
meeting as a government plot to destroy their campaign.
   They said 41 universities in Beijing would continue their
week-old class boycott until the government accepts their newly
formed student union as the true representative of students. The
government has declared the group illegal.
   Despite the complaints, the meeting was an unprecedented event
in a country where the people and their leaders have little contact.
   Radio and television stations carried a lengthy broadcast of the
meeting, providing some of China's most eloquent citizens with a
rare platform to criticize the government.
   ``Does Premier Li Peng really fear the people?'' asked one of
the 45 students present. ``If not, why won't he talk with us?''
   The 3{-hour meeting, with State Council spokesman Yuan Mu, State
Education Minister He Dongchang and high-ranking officials from the
Beijing city goverment, marked the first time government officials
have met with student activists since protests began two weeks ago.
   Government officials, speaking on behalf of Premier Li, called
on the students to return to class. They made no promises to change
state policy but acknowledged student complaints and implied that
further meetings would be possible.

   Engineers on Saturday studied two
mechanical problems that halted the launch of space shuttle
Atlantis and its robot Venus probe, and a NASA spokeswoman said
it's anybody's guess when the mission will take place.
   The space agency said the flight will not be attempted before
late this week at the earliest and that it will be at least Monday
before a new launch date will be set.
   Sources said the delay, which began with the last-minute
cancellation of the flight Friday, could stretch to a week or more
if technicians have to replace both a faulty fuel pump and a
leaking fuel line.
   NASA said it will replace the line but would not know about the
pump until engineers inspect it Sunday.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said NASA and industry officials
evaluated the problems Saturday and assigned committees to study
each element. She said those committees would make preliminary
reports Sunday.

   WASHINGTON _ President Bush's decision to go ahead with the $7
billion FSX fighter deal sets the stage for a heated congressional
debate over U.S.-Japanese defense ties, trade friction and
America's high-technology future.
   In announcing the agreement for joint development and production
of an advanced version of the F-16 fighter, Bush sought to allay
concerns voiced on Capitol Hill _ as well as within his own
administration _ over the economic and technological impact of the
deal.
   Bush told reporters Friday that the United States will have a 40
percent share in the development work and a ``similar share'' of
the production run for the 130 planes which Japan wants to deploy
in the late 1990s.
   Addressing technology issues, the president said that
``sensitive source codes for the aircraft's computer will be
strictly controlled. Access will be granted to only those codes
that are essential to complete the project.''
   Bush said he was convinced that the agreement ``is in the
strategic and commercial interests of the United States.''
   However, several members of Congress said they were still
dissatisfied with the terms of the deal and would strive to block
it when the agreement is sent up to Capitol Hill for a 30-day
review period.

   Commercial salmon fishing in oil-tainted
Prince William Sound will begin next month on schedule, but 30
percent of what should have been a record $50 million catch may be
lost, officials said Saturday.
   Fishing boats will be barred from many areas of the sound when
the season starts May 15, said state biologist James Brady.
   At one time, officials had considered canceling the season
altogether, just as they had canceled the $12 million herring
fishing season and smaller seasons in the sound for shrimp and
sablefish after the Exxon Valdez ran aground and spilled more than
10 million gallons of oil March 24.
   Instead, fishermen will be crowded into a smaller area in
efforts to keep their nets clear of oil that would contaminate
whatever salmon are caught.

<HEAD>Turncoat's Tomb Found in Desert Near Cairo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABUSIR, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He was an ancient Egyptian turncoat,
backbone of the pharaoh's government one day and strong right arm
of the conquering Persians the next.
   Most of what the world knows of Udjahorresnet comes from
inscriptions on his statue in the Vatican collection, which boast
of his calculated opportunism and the power his treachery won him.
   But it's a tale without an end _ the finale missing, the last
lines obscured.
   Now, in the depths of a desert burial maze, Czechoslavak
scientists are finding clues to the fate of one of pharaonic
Egypt's dastardly personalities.
   Almost 60 feet down, at the foot of a central shaft cut through
soft petrified clay and filled with sand, the team discovered a
burial chamber.
   ``What a shock to see his name, Udjahorresnet, in such an
unexpected place, away from his home'' in the Nile delta, ``away
from his Persian connections,'' said Miroslav Verner, head of
Egyptology at Charles University in Prague.
   ``It was thrilling,'' Verner said. ``His name is what all
Egyptologists learn first when they study the Persian takeover of
Egypt. ... He was a dark personage, a man known for his betrayal.''
   Verner has been field director since 1976 of a Czechoslavak
archaeological mission in Abusir, an ancient burial and religious
center 18 miles southwest of Cairo.
   Mission scientists discovered a series of rubble-filled shafts
in 1981 on a site misidentified 150 years earlier as a pyramid
ruin. Verner's 10-man team and colleagues from the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization began excavating last November.
   Udjahorresnet took few chances in life and fewer in death. The
maze of shafts he commissioned used a traditional method for
repelling robbers by filling shafts with sand, and was more
intricate than others found in Egypt.
   He was a trusted official of the 26th-dynasty Pharaoh Psamtik
III, then turned up as colonial administrator after Cambyses of
Persia conquered Egypt in 525 B.C.
   Little is known of Udjahorresnet's later life.
   ``The last we knew of him, he was leading an Egyptian army to
help the Persians under Darius I, Cambyses' son, put down internal
strife,'' Verner said. ``Then he disappeared from history. The
final lines on his statue are damaged unreadably and no tomb was
ever found.''
   That obscurity may be about to end.
   In the limestone chamber at the bottom of the Abusir shaft,
excavators found a megalith-sized sarcophagus sheltering an inner
coffin with decorated sides. They bore the name Udjahorresnet.
   The chamber held neither a mummy nor major funerary articles,
but Verner said team members found five small statuettes with the
names of Udjahorresnet and his parents, and a list of his titles.
   Since the 1960s, the pyramid-domed sands of Abusir have yielded
several major finds to Czech archaeologists: the oldest papyri
found in Egypt, the oldest hall with standing columns and several
spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty, more than 4,000
years ago.
   Once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor, the Giza
Plateau, Abusir became one of Egypt's most exciting archaeological
sites.
   Because of his important titles _ Egypt's chief physician and
overseer of the royal navy and Greek mercenaries _ Udjahorresnet
would have been ``a man in the know when the Persian invasion
came,'' Verner said.
   ``History doesn't record his exact role,'' the archaeologist
said, ``but the next thing we know after Egypt's defeat is that
this man was part of the Persian regime, close to Cambyses: his man
in Egypt, you might say, highly rewarded for his new loyalty.
   ``Udjahorresnet even boasts ... that he put together Egyptian
titles for the new Persian ruler. He was a 100 percent quisling, an
opportunist.''
   His statue, obtained by the Vatican collection 200 years ago, is
thought to have left Egypt with the Roman Emperor Hadrian early in
the second century.
   Hadrian was a restless traveler and protector of the arts who
appropriated the beautiful and strange to adorn the imperial villa
at Tivoli near Rome.
   The architect of Udjahorresnet's tomb used sand, in an
hour-glass effect, first to lower the massive sarcophagus and then
to seal the passages, Verner said. The burial chamber's roof
contained holes with clay pots beneath, which the last worker broke
one-by-one as he left through a side shaft so sand would flow in
from a shaft above, the archaeologist said.
   At least four grave-robbing forays were made into the shaft, the
latest in medieval tims. Verner said robbers finally tunneled
through the soft rock and penetrated the basalt coffin by using
fire and water alternately to weaken it.
   ``During their robberies, the thieves lived in the shafts,'' he
said. ``We know all about them from rubbish they left'' and the
soot from their fires.

<HEAD>Professor Turns To Baseball For First Novel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growing up in New Jersey and dreaming of playing
major league baseball, Bill Littlefield hoped Willie Mays would
move next door and teach him all he needed to know.
   ``Then when he retired, I'd just move in,'' he said.
   But Mays and the New York Giants moved to San Francisco, and
Littlefield became a college professor and radio commentator.
   That didn't end his love of baseball, as is clear in his first
novel, ``Prospect,'' which was published by Houghton Mifflin Co. on
April 3, the opening day of the major league baseball season.
   Not that the book is just about baseball. It's also about being
old and caring and sharing.
   Littlefield didn't know where his writing would lead when he
began his book. ``I got to several parts where I wanted to know
what hppened next myself,'' he said in an interview. ``I certainly
didn't know what was going to happen when I started it.''
   The story, interestingly, is told in two first-person accounts.
   One narrator, Pete Estey, is a retired baseball scout whose
playing career never got beyond the minor leagues. He lives in a
Flordia nursing home, listening to games on a radio and telling
baseball stories to Louise Brown, the other narrator. An avid
baseball fan from the Jackie Robinson days, she is religious,
strong and determined. She takes special care of patients at the
nursing home to keep them from slipping into the wards of oblivion.
   She also has a baseball-playing grandnephew, Jack, and she wants
to get him a shot at the big leagues.
   Littlefield didn't know Louise was going to be a character when
he started the book.
   ``I had a wonderful idea to have an old scout tell baseball
stories,'' he said. Estey was the sole narrator at first. ``Later
on Louise appeared ..., and I found I liked writing her very much.''
   Two old ballplayers, signed to their first contracts by Estey,
also figure in the book, and there is a woman in the nursing home
whose three dead daughters, Jackie Robinson and Babe Ruth visit her
from the clouds by sliding down the flagpole.
   The 40-year-old Littlefield is an associate professor of English
at Curry College in Milton, Mass. He also is sports commentator for
national public radio stations, including WBUR, a baseball throw
from the Boston Red Sox' Fenway Park.
   His commentaries sometimes take an off-beat approach. ``I think
that's the delight in being in sports; you can do a lot of things
you can't do (in other fields),'' he said.
   ``I take baseball very seriously. It fills a big aspect of my
life. I try not to be solemn about it. I try to recognize it as
fun.''
   His baseball career included Little League and summer camp teams
and intramural games at Yale University, where he also studied
under Robert Penn Warren. Now Littlefield plays on a fast-pitch
softball team in the Cambridge municipal league.
   It was through his radio work that he met Lennie Merullo, a
former player for the Chicago Cubs who lives in Reading and works
for the Major League Scouting Bureau in New England.
   Littlefield said he was impressed by Merullo's enthusiasm and
turned to him when he was developing the novel to bounce ideas off
him _ ``Could this happen? Would it be possible?'
   His knowledge insight into the way the elderly think came from
visiting his two grandmothers in nursing homes in New Jersey.
   ``I did have the idea of conveying to peole some of the pathos I
found in the two places,'' he said. ``As I went along, I found I
remembered far more than I thought.''
   He began writing ``Prospect'' in the summer of 1985 and
continued while on a sabbatical that fall. He finished last fall.
He did not work on it when Curry College was in session.
   ``What I discovered, I think, in the end was ... the discovery
that Pete makes that we are blessed with closeness when we don't
expect it,'' he said.

<HEAD>A Sizzling ``Scandal'' Ignites London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decades-old sex caper is making headlines again
in Britain as the movie ``Scandal'' turns bygone political wounds
into the stuff of popular cinema.
   The film offers that peculiar blend of politics and sex which
has always caught on in Britain, where such scandals are regularly
recycled.
   ``Scandal'' tells of the liaison between former Cabinet Minister
John Profumo, secretary of war, with English showgirl Christine
Keeler, a relationship that exposed a Soviet connection and led to
a sensational trial and the suicide of osteopath Stephen Ward,
Keeler's social-climbing mentor.
   The ``Profumo Affair,'' as it came to be known, forced the war
minister to resign in 1963 when it was revealed that he was sharing
Keeler with a Soviet naval attache. The affair helped Profumo's
Conservative Party lose the general election a year later.
   John Hurt plays Ward and Joanne Whalley-Kilmer portrays Keeler.
Ian McKellen, who won a 1981 Tony for ``Amadeus,'' co-stars as
Profumo. American actress Bridget Fonda braves a London accent as
Keeler's sidekick, Mandy Rice-Davies.
   Critical response in England has ranged from praise for the
filmmakers' daring, to disapproval that a seamy story is being
dredged up again, especially after Profumo's prolonged penance as a
charity worker in the slums of London.
   Adam Mars-Jones in The Independent called the film ``a loving
and highly enjoyable portrait of the early 1960s'' with a
first-rate cast.
   But Peter McKay in The Evening Standard wrote: ``The whole,
boring morass is a quarter of a century old and it meant nothing at
the time, let alone now.''
   McKellen retorts: ``The themes brought out were in the end more
important than the comfort and privacy of one man's life.''
   The film is controversial in suggesting that Ward, far from
being an amoral cad, was duped into helping the secret service to
sexually compromise the Soviet attache.
   Borrowing from new reports, ``Scandal'' suggests that Ward was
abandoned by his spymasters and turned into a scapegoat to protect
the establishment from humiliation. This provoked an angry reply
from Anthony Hartley in the conservative Sunday Telegraph. He said
all the evidence showed that MI5, the domestic secret service,
believed Ward was indiscreet, unreliable and best avoided.
   ``Conspiracy theories are always a misleading approach to
history,'' wrote Hartley, ``and this one is no exception.''
   But producer Stephen Woolley says, ``We didn't make this up.
This happened. It has the same lack of logic that life has.''
   ``Scandal'' has done good box office in Britain, grossing over 3
million pounds ($5.1 million) since its March 3 release.
   In the United States, the film generated advance publicity when
a brief orgy scene earned it an X rating. The two-minute scene was
altered and the rating was changed to an R.
   Co-executive producer Harvey Weinstein, of Miramax Pictures in
New York, said ``Scandal'' was basically a fabulous love story.
   ``For men in my age group, Christine was like Bridget Bardot,
except she was involved in an international sex scandal,'' he said.
   Director Michael Caton-Jones said his movie was a call for
tolerance.
   ``Because Britain is so class-conscious, people always take much
more stock of what politicians say than anyone else,'' he said.
``Stephen and Christine were reprehensible types at the time,
(because) they were not ministers of state.''
   Caton-Jones, a Scot making his first feature movie, said
``Scandal'' made no claims towards documentary fact.
   ``There are so many different facets to it that you can't tell
the true story,'' he said. ``We wanted a focus that would allow us
to get as much in as possible, and it became obvious that the way
to do that was to concentrate on two characters, Stephen and
Christine, who directly affected it.''

<HEAD>Memories of Better Days Give Former Dictator Edge in Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former dictator Hugo Banzer has
demonstrated a lasting, broadly based popularity in his campaign to
win election Sunday to the presidency he once took by force.
   The 62-year-old retired army general is playing to enthusiastic
audiences from all social levels of this poor, largely Indian
nation of 6 million.
   His popularity is a curious phenomenon at a time when
dictatorsip is on the decline in Latin America and democracy on the
rise. He explained it this way in a speech: ``The people have an
instinct that the political hacks have yet to discover. The people
remember the good things as well as the bad.''
   When Banzer was in power from 1971 to 1978, prices for tin, oil
and other exports were high, Bolivia enjoyed economic growth and
its people were working. After his departure came slumping prices,
rising debt, unemployment and rampant inflation.
   During a tour of slums at Santa Cruz, a tropical city that is
Bolivia's second largest, packs of ragged youngsters shouting
``Viva Banzer!'' chased his open car through the unpaved streets.
   He was dressed casually in a sport shirt and waved to cheering
crowds. Mothers held up babies to be kissed.
   The evening before, he attended a crowded fund-raising dinner in
a La Paz luxury hotel, where an organization of doctors, lawyers
and other professionals gave the former general a gold medal
designating him ``Leader of Bolivian Democracy.''
   Nearly every poll shows him leading the field of 10 candidates.
   Banzer finished first four years ago with 28.6 percent of the
vote, but lack of a majority left the decision to Congress. It
chose Victor Paz Estenssoro, who was second with 26.4 percent.
   No candidate is expected to get a majority this time either, but
Banzer hopes to build a large enough plurality to make him the only
possible choice for Congress.
   ``A great economic and social development'' occurred under his
military government, Banzer says.
   After he was forced out of office by popular pressure for a
return to democracy, an economic crisis descended on Latin America
and the good times ended.
   Inflation eventually soared to 20,000 percent a year. Paz
Estenssoro had to adopt drastic austerity measures, including the
dismissal of 22,000 employees of state-owned tin mines.
   Authorities say the austerity program is working, restoring
stability and allowing some real economic growth, but it also has
meant painfully hard times for many working-class Bolivians.
   Nationalist Democratic Action, Banzer's party, promises in its
slogan a return to ``Order, Peace and Work.''
   Opponents and some human rights groups dwell on the former
dictator's tactics while in power. The Bolivian Permanent Assembly
for Human Rights says at least 33 people disappeared and hundreds
were arrested, tortured or forced into exile in a crackdown on
leftists, labor and dissident journalists.
   ``Banzer kept the people subjected, violating the most basic
human and civil rights,'' Rolando Villena, a Roman Catholic bishop
and president of the assembly's executive committee, said in an
interview.
   ``The people are losing their historical memory,'' Villena said
of the public support. The Banzer slogan, he said, ``means order
imposed from above on those below.''
   In campaign speeches, Banzer points out that he did not seize
power from an elected government.
   His coup in 1971 ousted a leftist military government that had
installed a People's Assembly and planned other communist-style
changes. Many civilians, including Paz Estenssoro, supported the
coup.
   Villena said Banzer relinquished power only when forced to do so
by popular resistance, hunger strikes and labor actions.
   ``Democracy isn't a gift of this dictator,'' he said. ``It was
won by the people against his wishes.''
   To such arguments, Banzer responds: ``We aren't trying to
convince our adversaries of today, who only want to listen to
themselves, that we are democrats. ... We know that would be like
plowing the sea.''
   Banzer claims democratic credentials on the basis of peaceful
participation in the process since forming his party a decade ago
and his acceptance of the decision by Congress to deny him the
presidency in 1985.
   His main opponents this time are Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada of
the governing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement and Jaime Paz
Zamora of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left.
   He challenged both to pledge their support to the top
vote-getter, whoever that is. They refused, saying Congress must
retain its constitutional authority.
   A new Congress also is to be elected Sunday.

<TEXT>
   It will be a picture-perfect battle of corporate
tigers: Polaroid, having just fought off a hostile raider, is going
for the jugular of Kodak, cornered by the Japanese and poised to
fight for its life.
   The two photo giants go into court Monday to determine how many
hundreds of millions of dollars Eastman Kodak Co. will have to pay
for violating seven of Polaroid Corp.'s patents on instant film and
cameras.
   Legions of high-priced lawyers are expected to present evidence
for four to six months before Judge A. David Mazzone reaches a
decision in U.S. District Court here. But the stakes are so high
that neither side is trying to pinch mere millions in legal fees.
   Whether Kodak illegally copied Polaroid's technology is no
longer an issue. A judge ruled in October 1985 that it had _ and
booted Kodak out of the instant photography business, saddling it
with $600 million of losses and an estimated $200 million worth of
useless manufacturing equipment.
   The only issue in the trial that starts Monday is how much Kodak
must pay its rival.
   Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak argues that the most Polaroid should
get is $177 million, representing a 5 percent royalty on all the
instant film and cameras that Kodak sold from 1976 to 1986.
   But Cambridge-based Polaroid is asking for $3.48 billion to
$3.96 billion for lost profits and missed business opportunities,
plus punitive damages and interest, for a total of $11.88 billion.
   If Polaroid gets anything close to that amount, it will be the
largest patent infringement award in history and a devastating blow
to Kodak, which had operating profits of $3 billion on sales of $17
billion last year.
   A multibillion dollar verdict could force Kodak to make layoffs,
take on huge debt and sell subsidiaries to raise cash. It could
leave the company unable to make the investments it needs to
compete with Japanese film brands like Fuji and Ilford.
   If the award is near the top of the possible range, it could
even force Kodak into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, just as Texaco was
forced to reorganize when a jury ordered it to pay $10.3 billion to
Pennzoil four years ago.
   But securities analysts say that is unlikely. Most Wall Street
brokerage houses are predicting an award of about $1 billion, and
traders say the stock prices of both companies already reflect that
expectation.
   ``We're not going to see another Texaco here,'' said Peter
Enderlin, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Polaroid, which recently spent $1.1 billion to buy back stock
and fend off a hostile takeover by Shamrock Holdings Inc., is
expected to use part of any award to lower its corporate debt.
   In addition, Polaroid made the lawsuit a bargaining chip in the
takeover fray, promising in its March 27 settlement with Shamrock
that stockholders would get part of any award over $750 million
after taxes.
   That payout, to be made through dividends or stock repurchases,
would be on a sliding scale: at least a quarter of any post-tax
award from $750 million to $1.2 billion, a third of the amount from
$1.2 billion to $2.4 billion, and half of everything above $2.4
billion.
   But Polaroid's stockholders are not the only ones who would gain
from a big verdict. Its 11,000 employees would, too. Their
profit-sharing plan entitles them to about 10 percent of any award
for lost profits, and their employee stock ownership plan means
they gain from any rise in share prices.
   If the verdict comes in below the expected range, however,
Polaroid's employees and stockholders could get hurt.
   Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Bache Securities
Inc., said that ``as a rough rule of thumb,'' Polaroid's stock
price probably will rise or fall about $1 for every $100 million of
the award that is above or below Wall Street's expectations.
   That means a $400 million verdict could knock $5 or $6 off the
stock's current price of about $38 per share, while a $2 billion
award could add $10.
   Kodak has had two years to prepare for an adverse judgment and
already has weathered a lot of the instant photography storm. Last
year, for example, it gave $150 million in cash and merchandise as
compensation to owners of its instant cameras, for which film is no
longer available.
   Polaroid, meanwhile, emerged from its takeover battle in
fighting trim, with 1,900 fewer employees, lower overhead and
several new products _ including conventional film, a foray into
Kodak's terrain that seems an appropriate tit-for-tat.
   Now it remains to be seen who will prevail in court.

<HEAD>For Holly Hunter, `Roe vs. Wade' is More than a Movie</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``Roe vs. Wade'' airs on NBC on May 15</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holly Hunter, who was nominated for an Oscar
for the film ``Broadcast News,'' doesn't care much for television.
``I watch TV and I don't know what I'm seeing,'' she said. ``I'm
bored.''
   So why's she starring in ``Roe vs. Wade,'' NBC's dramatization
of the Supreme Court's decision to legalize abortion?
   It has more to do with an actor's convictions than with the
limits of an entertainment medium.
   ``I was interested in Roe vs. Wade. Well, I wasn't just
interested in it. I was active in it,'' Hunter said.
   An outspoken pro-choice advocate in real life, Hunter, 30,
played the pregnant plaintiff in ``Roe vs. Wade'' partly because
she feels a woman's right to a legal abortion is now in jeopardy.
The Supreme Court is weighing arguments in a Missouri case that
challenges Roe vs. Wade.
   ``I think what's going on says something about how women are
still riding shotgun,'' Hunter said. ``The fact that this case is
coming up again in the Supreme Court is kind of indicative of the
fact that the administration for the past eight years has really
taken a toll on civil rights in general, not excluding women's
rights.''
   In ``Roe vs. Wade,'' Hunter is Ellen Russell, a character based
on the real Roe plaintiff, Norma McCorvey. Russell is an unmarried,
unemployed Texas carnival barker. Her efforts to obtain an abortion
in a state where it was then illegal leads her to Sarah Weddington,
a lawyer eager to challenge the law.
   Weddington, played by Amy Madigan, argues the case all the way
to the Supreme Court, resulting in the landmark decision legalizing
abortion in 1973.
   Although ``Roe vs. Wade,'' shot under two phony names to avoid
protests, will almost certainly draw complaints from the
anti-abortion lobby, Hunter believes the movie is fair to both
sides of the debate. (Indeed, NBC insisted on more than 17 scripts
from ``Roe vs. Wade'' screenwriter Alison Cross to ensure the movie
didn't play favorites.)
   ``I think that the results of Jane Roe's efforts are heroic,''
Hunter said. ``It was a precedent that needed to be set real
desperately. Abortion needed to be made legal. But (Jane Roe) is
not a heroine at all. She's got glaring weaknesses and she's
extremely raw. ... And I thought that it was interesting to see
those two things.
   ``But I'm really happy Jane Roe didn't back out of it.''
   Both the pro-choice and anti-abortion forces in ``Roe vs.
Wade,'' Hunter said, ``are fully realized characters. And it didn't
have to be that way. But that absolutely gives it more credibility.
...
   ``I'm really glad it's not going to be a hammer-over-the-head
movie. I don't think there's any sentimentality in it. Most movies,
even features, if they're talking about issues, they make them so
black and white.''
   Hunter is confident that rather than being seen as a polemic,
``Roe vs. Wade'' will be viewed as educational and
thought-provoking.
   ``I think, actually, very few people know much of the story of
this case,'' Hunter said, including the fact that Jane Roe was
unable to have an abortion before the case was decided, and she
gave her baby up for adoption.
   ``(The movie) made my feeling about adoption more than
intellectual,'' Hunter said. ``Before, it was certainly something
that I believed in. But now that I've done Jane Roe, it just nailed
it in a little more securely: Adoption is just as personal a choice
as abortion.
   ``The response from so many people is that adoption is the
answer for any woman who wants to have an abortion. ... But the
fact is, adoption is a haphazardly, incompetently handled
institution. ...
   ``What if the mother is 23 years old, and she's been a hooker
for the past eight years, she has absolutely no money, she's got
six kids already and her husband _ or one of her tricks _ left her?
Who's going to want that baby? Who's going to adopt it? Like
nobody.''
   Even though ``Roe vs. Wade'' clearly represents a personal
project for Hunter, it does not mark any profound change in her
career. Her role in the upcoming film ``Miss Firecracker,'' now
playing in a few cities, is that of a wanna-be beauty queen, not a
partisan crusader.
   And the character she played so capably in ``Broadcast News'' _
a professionally gifted but emotionally crippled television news
producer _ was not out to change the world.
   ``Every movie I do I'm sure won't have political connotations,''
Hunter said. ``That's like me saying I'll never do a movie just for
the money. Are you kiddin', man?
   ``Yeah, I can do `Roe vs. Wade,' which I think is a fine
socially upstanding statement, and then maybe in five years, I'll
want to buy 300 acres of property somewhere. And say, `Well, this
project looks like it'd be fun, and they're offering me just a
(ton) of money. So I think I'll do it,''' Hunter said.
   ``Where I think the deceit lies is not in doing something for
money, but in doing it for money and not realizing that's why you
are.''

<HEAD>Do Short-Term Statistics Mean Anything?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The eyes of many investment managers, inflation
worriers, and economic forecasters are watching still another
statistic, just as they've been doing every day for several weeks.
   They are scrutinizing digits, percentages and even decimal
points of the latest monthly business activity report from the
National Association of Purchasing Management, seeking in it signs
about the immediate future.
   Last week it was the report on consumer spending, after-tax
income and the savings rate. Later this week the microscope will be
turned on new-home sales, factory inventories, nonfarm payrolls,
consumer debt and similar reports.
   All this activity creates great excitement, ranging from terror
to elation. Pontificators orate. Portfolio managers change
investments. Learned academics comment sagely. The White House
often has something to say as well.
   But when all is said and done, the question remains: Do the
statistics of one month or one week mean very much, if anything?
Probably not, and the reasons are obvious and numerous.
   To begin with, there are seasonal and other aberrations that
cause short-term reports to deviate from the longer-term trend. As
more information comes in, revisions and adjustments often follow,
and corrections too.
   It is not at all uncommon, either, for one month's statistics to
signify something entirely different from the month before or the
one that follows. Moreover, opinions of the same statistics vary
from month to month.
   It is for reasons such as these that wise users of statistics
wait for confirmation, which doesn't occur until statistics for a
couple of months, at least, show the same configuration or until
related data offer support.
   Knowledge of this doesn't, of course, deter anyone. In an
economic world in which insight into the future can be turned into
megadollars, an entire industry exists on grabbing and analyzing
any numbers that float by.
   Among them are stock market analysts, academics with or seeking
a popular following, investors, the media, economists seeking to
prove that their theses are correct, and worry warts of various
stripes and spots.
   Worriers, and those who feed them, proliferate in an economy
that is seen these days as being on the edge of a precipice. Any
piece of statistical dust thus can be the weight that tips the
precarious balance.
   However, in a field of economics in which the most basic of
premises may be incorrect, how can a speck of dust be that
important? If doubts exist about the causes of inflation, for
example, can one month's statistics be that important?
   At the moment, one of the most widely held theories about the
current economy is that the budget deficits and federal debt are
likely to cause a catastrophe. It is probably the least
controversial of all current economic issues.
   However, some of the sharpest brains in American economics
disagree.
   Prof. Robert Heilbroner and Peter Bernstein, authors of ``The
Debt and the Deficit,'' state the national debt will not, as is
widely thought, impoverish our grandchildren, that only a small
percentage of it is owed to foreigners, and that the national debt
and deficit are not large by historic standards.
   They are not alone. Prof. Robert Eisner of Harvard, former
president of the American Economic Association, contends that the
true deficit is much smaller than thought, and that everyone would
know it with proper accounting methods.
   If such an enormous disagreement exists about such a fundamental
concept of American life, why should one vagrant grain of
statistical dust have an important and even enormous impact on the
present and future?
   It is something to think about this week when you read the
reports about construction spending and installment credit and
factory inventories and nonfarm payrolls.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Activists Score in U.S. Divestment Crusade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foes of South Africa's apartheid race-separation
system are elated over what they see as the impressive number of
votes that divestment resolutions received from shareholders at two
giant U.S. corporations, International Business Machines Corp. and
Unisys Corp.
   But their biggest victory this past week came as a surprise _
the announced pullout from South Africa of Mobil Corp., a diehard
opponent of the divestment crusade and the biggest U.S. operation
in that country. Mobil's move raised speculation that other
companies would leave at an accelerated pace.
   ``This was a difficult decision because we continue to believe
that our presence and our actions have contributed greatly to
economic and social progress for non whites in South Africa,''
Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said in announcing the end of nine
decades of company operations in South Africa.
   ``We are proud of what Mobil people have accomplished in South
Africa,'' he said. ``But we had to weigh business considerations
including the impact of recently enacted and proposed U.S.
legislation and regulations which have made it more and more
difficult for us to be fully competitive there.''
   Murray's announcement marked a stunning reversal for New
York-based Mobil, the nation's sixth-largest industrial corporation
and second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon Corp., which
vacated South Africa three years ago. Mobil had vowed it would
never capitulate to pressure to leave.
   The Mobil news came a day after nearly a quarter of Unisys
shareholders voted to sever business ties with South Africa at the
company's annual meeting and four days after 14.5 percent of IBM
shareholders did likewise.
   Although those resolutions were defeated, the tallies reflected
the growing strength of the South Africa divestment movement among
shareholders. A few years ago, such resolutions generally won
little more than a 3 percent vote.
   Like many of the 170 American companies that have vacated South
Africa over the past four years, Mobil said its primary reason for
department was economic, not political.
   But anti-apartheid activists noted Mobil's announcement came
less than two weeks before its annual meeting. Activist
shareholders had placed two South African divestment resolutions on
the agenda.
   ``There's no question it was partly designed to deflect the
efforts of those shareholders,'' said Ibrahim Gassama, legislative
director of Trans-Africa, a Washington-based lobby concern that
advocates severing U.S. ties with South Africa.
   Anti-apartheid activists also said they believed Mobil's move
was partly a delayed reaction to a tax change passed by Congress in
1987. That reform, introduced by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
eliminated corporate deductions for income taxes paid to South
Africa.
   Some activists believe the Rangel reform has removed what they
call an excuse many U.S. companies use for justifying their
presence in South Africa: they do more good there battling racial
injustice than they would by leaving.
   As Mobil's departure shows, Gassama contended, ``We realize now
they were not there for South Africans. They were there for the
money. Rangel must be congratulated because he flushed out this
facade.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Government figures suggested the economy is slowing. The March
index of leading indicators fell 0.7 percent; consumer spending
rose only 0.2 percent the same month and durable goods orders from
factories rose only 0.8 percent, mostly from aircraft orders that
fluctuate sharply from month to month. Financial markets rallied on
the numbers because they were interpreted as a sign the Federal
Reserve won't raise interest rates further to slow the economy and
curb inflation.
   _Several major companies reported sharp first-quarter earnings
increases. Airline giants UAL Corp., Delta Air Lines and USAir
Group Inc. enjoyed a surge in earnings due to higher fares; Boeing
Co. reported an 18 percent jump that underscored its record orders
for new planes; Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. showed a 56 percent rise that
signaled a possible turnaround at the nation's biggest retailer;
Ford Motor Co.'s record first-quarter earnings reflected better
results at its overseas operations.
   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. sold half its retail brokerage
network to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., part of a previously
announced restructuring plan in the aftermath of Drexel's
securities-fraud settlement pact with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Another scandal-tainted securities firm, Matthews &amp;
Wright Group Inc., settled fraud charges with the SEC by
surrendering its bond-peddling license.

<HEAD>Stocks Sprang Ahead in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market turned in a strong showing in
April, thwarting the skeptics who thought its winter-long rally
couldn't last.
   Now, many analysts say, comes the tricky part.
   As Wall Street heads toward midyear, the economic slowdown so
many market participants have been hoping for appears to have
begun. Interest rates have shown some tentative signs of turning
downward.
   Economic statistics over the next couple of months will go a
long way toward determining whether those expectations will be
fulfilled.
   The Federal Reserve will be watching the data closely to try to
gauge the impact on business activity of a long period of
credit-tightening from early 1988 through most of the first quarter
of this year.
   The Fed, and many stock and bond traders, would like to see
signs that economic growth has indeed slackened and, more
important, that the pace of inflation is abating as well.
   That would provide evidence that the effort to restrain
inflation was producing some results, without the need to push the
economy further toward the brink of a recession.
   ``At last the cup seems half full again instead of half empty,''
said Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``What seemed to be generating this optimism was the likelihood
that the economy would slow, allowing a reduction in interest rates
at both the long and short end, and indicating that although
profits might bend, they are unlikely to break.
   ``The ability of the market to trade at new post-crash highs
shows that investors now interpret the environment as bullish. If
the economy continues to slow, we will in all likelihood have a
further fall in rates and a further rise in stock prices.''
   The more positive mood of the marketplace, brokers warn, also
leaves additional room for potential disappointments.
   If events conspire to force the Fed into taking more restrictive
steps, they say, both stocks and bonds could well suffer a big
letdown.
   And if economic activity starts dropping off too rapidly,
recession fears could weigh on stock prices even as interest rates
declined. ``What's good for bonds is not necessarily good for
stocks,'' observed Abby Joseph Cohen and Burton Siegel in their
latest investment strategy report for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The stock market overcame such concerns to post a small gain in
the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.34 to
2,418.80 to extend its gain for April to 155.18 points.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up .23 at 173.13; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market up 3.79 at 427.55; and the American
Stock Exchange market value index up 2.51 at 345.08.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 160.64 million shares a day,
down from 178.40 million the week before.
   In recent years, the market has been able to avert a historical
pattern that Yale Hirsch, who publishes the annual Stock Trader's
Almanac, calls ``the May-June disaster area.''
   From 1965 through 1984, the Dow Jones industrial average gained
ground through this two-month period only three times.
   In each of the past four years, however, the average has
recorded a net gain through May and June of at least 5 percent.
   The ``jinx'' apparently is off. Now all stocks need is a little
help from the inflation statistics and the Federal Reserve.
