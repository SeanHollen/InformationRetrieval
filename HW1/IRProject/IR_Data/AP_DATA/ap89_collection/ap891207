   Soldiers at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo,
Cuba, fired two shots Thursday at Cuban sentry posts, breaking
glass but causing no injuries, the official news agency Prensa
Latina said.
   The news agency quoted a ministry statement as saying one shot
was fired at 10 a.m. EST at sentry post 17, and a second at 1 p.m.
at post 18.
   Lt. Cmdr. Ken Satterfield, a spokesman in Washington for the
Pentagon, said, ``We received no reports of any such incident.''
   Both shots shattered glass in the posts, the agency said in the
dispatch, monitored in Mexico. The direction indicated the shots
were fired from American post 13, the agency quoted the note as
saying.
   ``These actions are even more serious and of unpredictable
consequences because the two shots hit the guardposts and could
have wounded and even assassinated any of the soldiers who were on
guard duty,'' the agency quoted the note as saying.
   The note said the last similar incident was Aug. 21, 1987, when
shots were fired from American post 18 on a Cuban observation post.
   It noted the incident occurred as the country was holding
funerals for more than 2,000 Cuban soldiers and civilian
technicians killed in Angola and other foreign conflicts the past
14 years.
   The ministry said it was not an accident that ``these vulgar and
dangerous provocations by Yankee soldiers occurred precisely
today.''

   State game officials are no dummies,
but the same can't be said for the deer they used to nab poachers.
   For the second straight year, officers from the state's Division
of Natural Resources used fake deer against hunters who stop along
highways to shoot at deer illegally.
   Last year, one bogus buck in Braxton County bamboozled 30
would-be hunters into taking potshots. This year, conservation
officers caught 82 shooters at two locations.
   ``We were hoping that the publicity would act as a deterrent to
those hunters who like to cruise the roads looking for deer,'' said
Maj. Bill Daniel of the agency's law enforcement division. ``I
think it worked. I'm sure it saved some real deer.''
   Most of the arrests were for shooting from the road or for
trespassing on private property.
   Daniel said one decoy was set up in a privately owned field
marked with ``No Hunting'' signs.
   ``We had some guys who would jump out of their cars, run over to
the fence and use the signs as gun rests,'' Daniel said.
   Such antics often left conservation officers laughing so hard
that they had to pause to compose themselves before moving in to
make arrests. Daniel still chuckles about one incident.
   ``One car pulled up and four guys came rolling out of it with
their guns,'' he said. ``Three of them took up positions outside
the fence while the other one sneaked in toward the decoy.
   ``Finally, the guy got within 30 yards or so of the deer, stood
up and fired. He looked at the decoy, still just standing there,
and I think he began to get the idea that something was wrong.
   ``He walked over to the decoy and just reached out and touched
it. About that time, we hit the siren and moved in. You've never
seen a more dejected or more hang-dog expression on anyone in your
life. His buddies were laughing their brains out.''

   Your run-of-the-mill lounge lizard will
still be roaming bars, but the Coggon City Council intends to
decide whether an undersized alligator can frequent a tavern.
   A hearing will be held next month to discuss whether Crosby the
alligator can be the mascot of Crosby's Cove, a tavern recently
purchased by Crosby's best friend and feeder, Jim Schebler of Cedar
Rapids.
   Tuesday night, Schebler lobbied the City Council to amend the
city's dangerous animal ordinance, which prohibits bobcats, polar
bears, alligators and other wild critters within the city limits.
   Council discussion showed a general reluctance to amend the
ordinance to allow alligators less than 3{ feet long if in a
secured container.
   But Councilman Richard Foye supported the change, agreeing with
Schebler that dogs could be more dangerous than a locked-up
alligator.
   ``I'm not worried about his alligator snipping off my kids'
toes,'' Foye said. ``They shouldn't be in the tavern anyway.''
   Mayor Bob Trumbull encouraged drafting the amendment and having
a hearing Jan. 2.
   Schebler wants to keep the alligator, now 2 feet long, in the
bar to attract customers.

<HEAD>Study: Even Tiny Amount of Cocaine Cuts Blood Flow to Heart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even minuscule amounts of cocaine can constrict
the arteries and reduce the flow of blood to the heart, and this
may explain how larger doses trigger heart attacks and death,
researchers report today.
   Young, seemingly healthy cocaine abusers sometimes suffer chest
pain or heart attacks even though their heart arteries appear to be
perfectly normal. Doctors have speculated that the drug causes
spasms in blood vessels and temporarily chokes off the flow of
blood to heart muscle.
   ``The importance of our findings was showing that this indeed
happens,'' said Dr. L. David Hillis. ``No one has shown it in man
before.''
   Cotton strips soaked in a cocaine solution are routinely used as
a local anesthetic in an estimated 185,000 medical procedures in
the United States each year. It is especially common during minor
nose operations, since it limits bleeding as well as deadens pain.
   In their experiment on 45 people, doctors tested cocaine's
effects on the heart when volunteers received doses that were about
two-thirds the amount used for anesthesia. They got between 150 and
180 milligrams of cocaine. By contrast, people who abuse cocaine
typically take one gram, or six times this much.
   ``Even that small dose caused coronary blood flow to fall by
about 15 to 20 percent,'' said Hillis. ``One can extrapolate from
that to say that in all probability a much larger dose would in
some people cause a very profound fall in blood flow.''
   The study, conducted by Hillis and colleagues at the University
of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, was published in
the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Hillis said that despite the finding, the medical use of cocaine
as a painkiller is safe. The volunteers showed no sign in their
hearts of ischemia, or oxygen starvation.
   Hillis said that some people's heart arteries respond much more
dramatically than others' to the potential hazards of cocaine. In
his study, he said, the reduction in blood flow ranged from 5
percent to about 40 percent.
   He said these individual differences may explain why some people
have heart attacks or die from cocaine abuse, while most do not.
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Jeffrey M. Isner and Saurabh
K. Chokshi of St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston noted that during
the past year, the number of emergency room visits for
cocaine-related problems has increased fivefold.
   ``While laboratory studies offer increase insight into the
fundamental effects of cocaine,'' they wrote, ``the history of this
ancient drug grows progressively more depressing.''
   They said that at least 58 cases of cocaine-related heart
attacks have been described in medical journals. Among highly
publicized cases was the 1986 death of college basketball star Len
Bias.
   Hillis said cocaine stimulates the body's production of
adrenaline and other hormones. These trigger the blood vessels to
narrow so that less oxygen-carrying blood can get through. At the
same time, the drug increases the heart's need for oxygen by
boosting the heart rate.

<UNK>Ten Percent Of Publishers To Be Closed</UNK>

<TEXT>
   China plans to shut down 10 percent of its
newspapers and publishing houses, targeting for closure those
printing pornography or material critical of the Communist Party,
the official Xinhua news agency said today.
   The agency quoted the current issue of China Cultural News as
saying newspaper and magazine offices that publish pornographic
stories or articles running counter to the party line will lose
their licenses.
   The Press and Publications Administration will also merge
newspapers and periodicals that are similar in content, it said.
   The report said China has 1,600 newspapers, 3,000 social science
periodicals and 500 publishing houses. Many are similar in nature
and have few readers.
   In the past year, particularly after Communist leaders used
troops to crush the pro-democracy movement in June, the government
has moved to consolidate and exert greater control over the
publishing industry.
   Millions of publications have been confiscated and destroyed in
a nationwide anti-pornography campaign and a number of publications
that sympathized with the pro-democracy movement, such as
Shanghai's World Economic Herald, have been shut down or revamped.
   Li Ruihuan, the Politburo Standing Committee member in charge of
propaganda and cultural affairs, said recently that many
publications were being turned out that advocated ``bourgeois
liberalization'', or Western ideas.
   He said such publications were ``full of seductive and poisonous
material especially harmful to young people'' and ``it was high
time to solve all these problems.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Higher Cancer Risk With Infrequent Pap Smears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cervical cancer risks increase dramatically
for women who fail to get Pap smear tests at least every two years,
University of Washington scientists report in a study released
today.
   Women who get Pap smears only every three years run a risk that
is 3.9 times greater that cervical cancer will go undetected than
women who have the test annually, according to the study published
in the professional journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.
   The study said the risks increase as the between-test interval
increases and that for women who have no Pap tests for 10 years or
longer, the risk increases by 12.3 times.
   ``The study shows that women should get Pap smears more
frequently than every three years,'' said Dr. Joseph Chu, one of
five physicians who conducted the study at the University of
Washington. ``The risk of having advanced disease goes way down if
the tests are conducted every two years or less.''
   Chu said that the more frequent Pap tests lower the cancer risk
for all women, no matter what other risk factors, such as smoking
or multiple sexual partners, they have in their life.
   The Pap smear is used in gynecological screening to detect the
presence of squamous cell cancer, the most common form of cervical
cancer. It can also detect changes in cells that could lead to
invasive cancer if not treated _ thus the test can result in
therapy that prevents the cancer from developing.
   To perform a Pap test, doctors collect cells from the mucous
membrane of the cervix during a pelvic examination. The cells are
stained for laboratory analysis. The procedure, known formally as
the Papanicolaou stain test, is named for George Nicolas
Papanicolaou, the physician who developed it.
   Just how frequently such tests should be performed to afford
maximum protection has long been a matter of controversy. Some
studies have found that significantly elevated risks for cancer
occur at test intervals of four years or more.
   But the Washington State researchers said in their study that
they found three years seemed to be the critical interval.
   ``Women with three-year screening intervals had over three times
the risk of squamous cells cervical cancer at did other women with
annual screening intervals.''
   It noted, however, that there was little risk difference between
annual and biannual Pap tests.
   ``We found no difference in the risk of cervical cancer between
women screened every year and those screened every two years,
suggesting that two-year screening intervals offer the same
protection as annual smears,'' said Dr. Kirk Shy, lead author of
the study.
   The findings are based on interviews and medical histories of 92
women with advanced cervical cancer, compared with similar data
from 178 women without cancer and selected randomly. The ages
ranged from 31 to 75.
   Annual Pap tests are recommended by the American Cancer Society
and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for
women ages 18 and over who are sexually active. After three
consecutive tests with normal findings, however, the test often is
done at the discretion of the physician.
   ``There are really no firm guidelines,'' Chu said. ``Our study,
though, shows that three years is certainly not the right number of
years'' between tests.
   The study showed that although the Pap test frequency, along
with appropriate follow-up treatment, can reduce the risk of
squamous cell cancer, the test interval had no effect on other
types of cervical cancer. Squamous cell, however, accounts for
about 85 percent of all cervical cancers, Chu said.
   Other researchers conducting the study were Drs. Margaret
Mandelson, Benjamin Greer and David Figge.
   Obstetrics and Gynecology is the professional journal of the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

<HEAD>Tougher Soviet Stance Could Delay Arms Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
toughened stance on submarine-launched cruise missiles could delay
completion of a strategic weapons treaty past the summit planned
for June, says a senior U.S. official.
   Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
appeared at the Malta summit last weekend to ``walk back'' from a
concession they made in September concerning the submarine-launched
cruise missiles, or SLCMs, said a second official. Both sources
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At a September meeting in Wyoming with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, Shevardnadze withdrew Soviet demands that SLCM limits
be included in the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
Shevardnadze said the Soviets would settle for a separate deal, but
did not specify whether it must be signed at the same time as the
START treaty.
   At Malta, however, the Soviets spelled out new, more stringent
conditions for the proposed SLCM accord, and they have been
indicating that they want the two deals concluded simultaneously,
said the sources.
   ``In September, they said SLCMs could be dealt with outside the
START treaty. But Gorbachev said `how can we agree to all these
kinds of reductions when SLCMs are out there running free?''' said
the official.
   Gorbachev also pressed President Bush to hold naval arms control
talks to ban short-range nuclear weapons in the superpower navies,
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush rejected Gorbachev's suggestion as ``unacceptable to us
because the United States is a naval power. We depend upon the seas
for contact with all of our allies and with other continents of the
world,'' Fitzwater said.
   Gorbachev concentrated on the issue of tactical nuclear weapons,
while Shevardnadze dealt in greater detail with the SLCM question
in a separate meeting with Baker, said one of the sources.
   The senior U.S. official said that as a result of the
conflicting signals from Wyoming and Malta: ``I don't know where we
are. But SLCMs is a major issue.''
   The new Soviet position helps explain the sudden pessimism of
U.S. officials who went to Malta hoping to conclude START in time
for the summit scheduled for the last two weeks of June in the
United States, but left the Mediterranean saying it could take
longer.
   Both leaders said before the summit that a START deal was
possible by September, and at Malta they announced that Baker would
travel to the Soviet Union next month to continue work on the
treaty, which would cut long-range superpower arsenals by 30
percent to 50 percent, to 6,000 warheads apiece.
   So far, the Soviets have not put forward a comprehensive
proposal linking SLCMs and tactical nuclear weapons, or spelling
out the scope of the issues they want covered in naval arms control
talks.
   But at Malta, Shevardnadze told Baker the Soviets wanted the
SLCM issue included in a naval arms control treaty, that they
wanted tough verification rules and they wanted to curb
conventional and nuclear warheads, said one source.
   The Soviets have been pushing similar conditions at the START
talks in Geneva, and also have given ``indications that they want
START and a naval treaty at the same time. They didn't say that
specifically at Malta,'' said the source.
   One official described Shevardnadze's statements at Malta as a
``hardening of the Soviet position.'' Another called it a ``walk
back.''
   Gorbachev illustrated his concern over the American Navy by
giving Bush a map of U.S. naval bases, deployments and maneuvers
around the Soviet Union.
   In rejecting Gorbachev's argument, Fitzwater said, Bush
maintained that ``the Soviet Union is a land-based power. But the
navy is crucial to us in terms of maintaining all of our
commitments around the world, maintaining open sea lanes and
commercial lanes around the world.''
   In Pentagon and other assessments, the U.S. Navy is considered
to be mightier than its Soviet counterpart, having for example more
aircraft carriers.
   At the joint presidential news conference concluding the summit,
Bush and Gorbachev staked out their basic positions on naval arms
control, although neither went into detail.
   ``The time has come when we should begin discussing naval
forces,'' Gorbachev said.
   Bush replied, ``I'm disinclined to think that this is an area
where we will have immediate progress.''

<HEAD>Cold War Drying Up Conservative Coffers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the Cold War thaw, the Republican Party's
right wing is having a tougher time attracting troops and money to
its conservative causes _ prompting a search for new issues to
replace the Soviet menace.
   ``Saber rattling and the sort of hard-line anti-communism that
have held our coalition together are not going to be as convincing
arguments with the voters, not when you have a majority of the
voters thinking the Soviet Union merely seeks peace like we do,''
said Roger Stone, a Republican political consultant.
   Richard Viguerie, who built a political and financial empire
based on mail-order fund-raising among conservatives, says he's
replacing anti-communism with attacks on Congress as the
centerpiece of his new appeals for dollars.
   ``I plan to make the imperial Congress my No. 1 issue for the
foreseeable future,'' Viguerie said. ``Whether it's going to catch
on as the No. 1 issue, I don't know.''
   Not all conservatives have begun such wholesale rethinking,
however.
   Most prominent among them was Vice President Dan Quayle, who
offered a highly skeptical assessment of the Soviets in an
interview published after last weekend's summit between President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I don't think they've changed much in foreign policy,'' Quayle
told The Washington Post. In a subsequent interview with
Knight-Ridder newspaper editors, Quayle tempered his earlier
comments by saying he should have referred to the Soviet Union as
an authoritarian rather than totalitarian state.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft rejected suggestions
there was a marked difference in the views of Bush and Quayle.
   He said that there may be a ``difference of perspective, but
there's no difference in the substance of the policies we're
pursuing.''
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., a leading Senate hawk, disputed the
notion that Gorbachev's ``perestroika'' reforms and the moves
toward democracy in the Soviet bloc nations of Europe have resulted
in a lessening of Cold War concerns by American voters.
   ``I don't think the millennia has arrived, and I don't think the
polls show the public thinks the millennia has arrived,'' Wallop
said.
   He is a leader of conservative efforts to oppose defense cuts
attributable to the lessening of superpower tensions. He is
opposing Bush administration acceptance of modest cuts in defense
spending.
   But Wallop acknowledges that in the wake of changes in Europe
and the Malta summit, ``it's going to require some leadership to
maintain some perspective in the public mind'' in support of the
conservative agenda.
   The opening of the Berlin Wall and other rapid, revolutionary
changes in Eastern Europe are only the latest blows to
conservatives' ability to rally around Cold War worries.
   As conservatives have seen their presidential candidates win
three consecutive elections and much of their agenda enacted by
Congress, some of their leading organizations have faced a decline
in fund-raising and dues-paying membership. As they succeed, some
of the fire goes out of the fight.
   ``Our members came on because of defense and foreign policy
issues _ anti-communism issues,'' said Dan Casey, executive
director of the American Conservative Union.
   ``The fear and loathing is just not at the same level of
intensity it was in recent years. ... You don't expand your
membership pool by just declaring victory.''
   Most of the conservative leaders say they believe there is still
a good case to be made for maintaining tough defense and
anti-communism positions. Their problem is most voters aren't as
concerned as before.
   ``I find this all a very sorry state of affairs,'' laments Stone.
   The ACU illustrates the problem encountered by many conservative
groups.
   Its donor list has fallen from a high of 750,000 donors a decade
ago to about 60,000 today. Others, such as the American Security
Council, have sold assets and cut back programs.
   David Keene, chairman of the ACU, said his group is ``in an
assessment phase,'' and considering other issues.
   And conservative leaders say there are many other ones,
including opposing ``Latin communism,'' as Casey calls it, in
Central America, and even that favorite from 11 years ago,
maintaining control of the Panama Canal.
   ``I don't see any perestroika south of the border,'' Casey said.
   Other potential fighting issues eyed by conservative
fund-raisers are opposing abortion, pushing conservative social
issues before the Supreme Court, fighting taxes, and opposing
liberals on the spending at home of any savings accruing from peace
abroad.
   ``The center of gravity of the conservative movement will
shift,'' said Casey. ``I think the tax issue is a critical issue,
and the disposition of the `peace dividend' will ignite the usual
liberal-conservative fight.''
   Wallop, while insisting the Cold War causes will still work,
acknowledges that rapid changes in the face of communism will force
conservatives _ and liberals _ to change their methods.
   ``It's made it different. It's made it different for the other
side, too,'' Wallop said. ``The will begin to find ways to spend
the defense savings. They've got a pile of new thinking to do also.
All of us do.''

   Another mystery has been solved.
   Angela Lansbury has agreed to return for a seventh season in
CBS's highest-rated entertainment show ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   Miss Lansbury had not planned to return for 1990-91, but CBS
reached an agreement for next season, said Howard Stringer,
president of the CBS Broadcast Group.
   ``Murder, She Wrote,'' in which Miss Lansbury plays a mystery
novelist who keeps happening upon murders, is CBS' only hit
entertainment show. Usually, Miss Lansbury's show and ``60
Minutes'' are the only CBS shows to make the 20 top shows in the
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   Her return is so important to CBS that the network has granted
her enormous concessions. The agreement calls for Miss Lansbury's
production company to develop a series for next season that she
would not appear in.
   To get her to return for the current season, CBS financed the
establishment of her production company and said she only had to
appear in 13 episodes. She makes brief appearances in nine other
episodes, which are essentially pilots for other series.
   That contract also calls for her company to produce several TV
movies and 13 episodes of a half-hour series starring Miss Lansbury
after ``Murder, She Wrote'' ends its network run.

   Maurizio Gucci, chairman of the Italian
luxury goods company Guccio Gucci SPA, has been found innocent of
attempted fraud by a Milan appeals court.
   In November 1988, Gucci was given a one-year suspended prison
term and a fine of $760 after being convicted of tax fraud. He also
was ordered to pay inheritance tax on shares of Gucci he had
received from his father, Rodolfo.
   The Milan court had ruled that Maurizio Gucci arranged the
forgery of his father's signature on the documents giving him the
shares, to make it appear that the transfer took place before
Rodolfo Gucci's death in 1983. The lower court said Gucci was
trying to evade inheritance taxes.
   But the appeals court ruled Wednesday that Gucci and six others
accused with him didn't commit the crime.
   Gucci was named company chairman in May after the lower court
had handed back his 50 percent shareholding despite his conviction.
He is the great-grandson of Guccio Gucci, who founded the company
in 1922.

for 16 years with his high-flying dunk shots, has notified league
Commissioner David Stern that if a franchise becomes available, he
would like to be considered for ownership.
   Erving and business partner Bruce Llewellyn purchased a
Coca-Cola bottling plant in Philadelphia shortly after Erving
retired from the 76ers. The two have several other business
interests.
   ``I would be interested in being part of a good situation,''
Erving said in Dallas at an athletic forum Tuesday. ``My partner
and I are interested in owning a basketball team, but the timing
has to be right, and the deal has to be right. ...
   ``I never intended to coach or be the general manager or work
for an owner. Not that there are bad owners in the league. But I
would rather be in the position to hire rather than be hired.''

<HEAD>Gene for Brain Protein Found, Could Lead to Better Stroke Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

   Scientists reported today they have discovered a
gene for a protein that helps govern brain cell communication, a
potential step toward new treatments for stroke and severe head
injury.
   Further work also may help explain how the brain learns and
remembers, scientists said.
   ``This discovery is extremely important,'' commented Charles
Stevens of Yale Medical School, whose editorial appears with the
study in the British journal Nature.
   The work is the first finding of a gene that tells brain cells
how to make a protein called a glutamate receptor. When this
receptor senses a natural substance called glutamate outside a
brain cell, it makes the cell more prone to fire off messages to
neighboring brain cells.
   In this way, the receptor acts as a fundamental regulator of
brain cell communication.
   The newfound gene is for one type of glutamate receptor, but it
can be used to find genes for the other types, said study co-author
Stephen Heinemann. Finding the gene is a first step toward studying
a receptor's structure and behavior.
   Eventually, glutamate receptor studies may lead to development
of drugs that limit brain damage from strokes, head injury or
repeated seizures, and to new understanding about learning and
memory, the scientists said.
   Heinemann and colleagues at the Salk Institute for Biological
Studies in San Diego report that they isolated key portions of a
rat glutamate receptor gene.
   The same issue of Nature carries reports of similar findings in
frogs and chicks by scientists at Salk, the National Institutes of
Health in Bethesda, Md., and the Weizmann Institute of Science in
Rehovot, Israel.
   In a telephone interview, Heinemann said his group went on to
isolate the entire gene. Finding the human counterparts of rat
glutamate receptor genes for further research should be relatively
easy, he said.
   He said he hopes the work will lead to finding the gene for
another type of glutamate receptor, called the NMDA receptor
because it binds to a man-made chemical called N-methyl-D-aspartate.
   The NMDA receptor plays a role in a phenomenon called
excitotoxicity, in which brain cells are fatally overstimulated
after a stroke, repeated epileptic seizures or a severe blow to the
head, Stevens said. By analyzing and experimenting with the NMDA
receptor, researchers may be able to develop drugs that block the
process and so limit brain damage, he said.
   The NMDA receptor also triggers a process called long-term
potentiation, a strengthening of communication links between
certain brain cells that is thought to underlie some forms of
memory and learning. So studying the receptor may illuminate brain
function in those tasks, Stevens said.
   Such studies might one day lead to treatments for people with
learning or memory disorders, Heinemann speculated.
   Scientists have been unable to study details of the NMDA
receptor because, until now, they had not found any glutamate
receptor gene to guide the search for the NMDA receptor gene,
Stevens said.
   The new work ``gives us the right gene family, we think,'' he
said.
   Carl Cotman of the University of California, Irvine, cautioned
that the study does not guarantee discovery of a gene for the NMDA
receptor, although it probably increases the chances.

<TEXT>
   Sometimes overlooked in the excitement of
the political upheaval in Eastern Europe is an increase in
nationalism and racism along with the new climate of freedom.
   In the Soviet Union, East Germany, Hungary and Poland, there are
signs of nationalism and anti-Semitism that suggest the four
decades of Communist rule suppressed traditional hatreds instead of
eradicating them.
   Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed more openess and lifted iron
controls on dissent, ethnic and racial hatreds have resurfaced in
Moslem Central Asia and in the Caucasus republics of the Soviet
Union. Ethnic violence there has killed more than 300 people.
   Azerbaijan and Armenia are in conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh
region and the Baltic republics are gripped by growing nationalist
sentiment.
   Writing in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, Zbigniew
Brzezinski says that although communism ``proclaimed itself to be a
doctrine of internationalism, communism in fact intensified popular
nationalist passions.''
   The former U.S. national security adviser noted that while
Poland and Hungary are the most ethnically cohesive countries in
Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia are diverse societies
and both Romania and Bulgaria have substantial national minorities.
   ``Moreover, all these states have borders that are potentially
subject to revisionist aspirations on the part of their
neighbors,'' he wrote.
   In the Soviet Union, activity by Pamyat, a nationalist Russian
society, also has picked up in this new era. Pamyat, with its
extremist, xenophobic outlook, is operating openly in a number of
major Russian cities.
   In Vienna, Soviet artist Tanya Loskutova said in a recent
interview that Gorbachev's campaign of openness had succeeded in
unearthing hatreds that had lurked under the surface for decades.
   ``Anti-Semitism has become much more obvious, because there is
now a great opportunity to spit out the dirt that people had
inside,'' said Ms. Loskutova, a Jew who emigrated in October and
hopes to settle in the United States.
   The sudden removal of constraints on freedom of expression has
permitted organizations like Pamyat to step up anti-Jewish
campaigns.
   In Hungary too, overt anti-Semitism appears to be more
pronounced since the country initiated reforms about two years ago
that are meant to transform it into a full democracy.
   But representatives of Hungary's Jewish community of 60,000 seem
to feel the racist sentiment _ expressed through the desecration of
synagogues and in anti-Semitic outbursts at soccer matches _ is not
on the rise.
   They say it's just becoming more visible.
   ``Anti-Semitism has been with us all these four decades, but it
was forbidden to discuss it openly,'' Chief Rabbvi Alfred Schoener
said in an interview.
   More worrying to Jews is that political reforms have been
accompanied by the kind of growing nationalism that in the past has
been linked to the persecution of Jews.
   The popularity of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, a main
opposition party that has gained support by exploiting tensions
with Romania over Transylvania and the fate of ethnic Hungarians in
the Romanian territory, is therefore a cause of worry for some Jews.
   Gyoergy Konrad, a writer of Jewish origin, likes to relate how
his mother once told him: ``My boy, be careful, because once they
start talking about Transylvania, they'll be deporting Jews soon.''
   Government figures and the Hungarian media have also raised
nationalist themes in an attempt to gain popularity. The result is
embarassing some members of Hungarian minority groups living in
neighboring countries.
   ``The media in Budapest are hurting us here with false reports
of a mass autonomy movement in Slovakia,'' Andras Szemere, a member
of Czechoslovakia's 500,000-strong Hungarian minority told a
Western visitor to Bratislava recently. ``Sure, we have our
problems _ all minorities do everywhere _ but right now we're more
interested in working with the Czechs and Slovaks and getting rid
of the Communists.''
   In Poland, there have been scattered incidents of anti-Semitism
preceding elections that gave the country its first government in
four decades not dominated by the Communists.
   People scribbled the word ``Jew'' on campaign posters of
Solidarity activist Jacek Kuron, who is not Jewish.
   There are also reports that prominent Solidarity activist and
intellectural Bronislaw Geremek was passed over for the Polish
premiership because he is Jewish.
   In East Germany, where decades of isolation have fallen away
with the opening of the Berlin Wall, fears focus on the importation
of racist sentiments.
   At a meeting with Jewish community leaders Nov. 27, East German
security officials contended that leaflets distributed by West
Germany's ultra-rightist Republican Party have appeared with
increasing frequence in East Germany since border controls were
loosened Nov. 9.
   ``Since the opening of the borders to the West, a rise in
activities of neo-Nazi groups in the direction of East Germany can
be noticed,'' the official ADN news agency said in a report on the
meeting.
   Even Romania, the last bastion of Stalinism in the Soviet bloc,
is exploiting some of the unsolved ethnic problems.
   In an apparent attempt to deflect attention from his own
country's economic and human rights record, President Nicolae
Ceausescu recently suggested the return of the former Bessarabia,
now Soviet Moldavia, which Romania lost during World War II.

<HEAD>World Beef Trade Undergoing Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's beef trade is undergoing rapid
changes as production declines in 1989 and production falters in
some major countries.
   One result, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday, is that
the United States is edging ahead of New Zealand as a world-class
beef exporter.
   U.S. exports are estimated at 450,000 metric tons, up from
313,000 tons in 1988, the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
reported. Exports are expected to rise to about 508,000 tons in
1990.
   Most of the increase is the result of larger sales to Japan
under last year's trade liberalization by Tokyo to open the door to
more beef and citrus.
   New Zealand's total beef and veal exports, meanwhile, are
estimated at 439,000 tons in 1989 and 368,000 tons in 1990.
Production rose this year as drought forced more cattle to
slaughter.
   U.S. imports of beef, which reached 1.1 million tons in 1988,
are expected to decline this year to around 990,000 tons, the
report said. The decrease is the result of smaller shipments from
Australia, where production is down and more meat was diverted to
the lucrative Japanese market.
   The report said U.S. beef imports in 1990 are likely to decline
slightly, to around 970,000 tons, as Australia continues exporting
to Japan.
   ``U.S. beef exports grew at a faster rate than those of the
other five countries during the 1980s, rising from sixth to fourth
position by 1988,'' the report said. ``In 1989, it is expected that
the United States will surpass New Zealand to become the third
largest beef exporter in the world.''
   The top six beef exporters in 1989 are: Australia, 823,000 tons;
the 12-nation European Economic Community, 759,000; United States,
450,000; New Zealand, 439,000; Brazil, 370,000; and Argentina,
350,000.
   Overall, global beef and veal production is expected to decline
this year to about 45.2 million metric tons from 45.3 million tons
in 1988, the report said. Much of the decease occurred in the EEC,
Argentina, Brazil and Australia.
   The situation in the major beef producing countries is watched
closely by USDA trade analysts and livestock producers,
particularly conditions in Australia and New Zealand.
   Cattle herds are expected to increase in Australia to about 25.3
million head by 1991 from 24.3 million at the beginning of 1989,
the report said.
   ``Dampening a more rapid increase in the herd size is an
attractive wool market and expansion in the sheep industry,'' the
report said. ``Without this competition for resources, total cattle
numbers could increase more rapidly.''
   In New Zealand, drought forced cattle slaughter to about 3.3
million head this year from 3.1 million in 1988. But slaughter may
decline to around 2.8 million head in 1990, the report said.

   The Agriculture Department says it will soon
pay wheat and barley producers about $175 million in ``deficiency''
payments for participating in the government's 1989 acreage program.
   Keith Bjerke, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said Wednesday that the payments to wheat
and barley farmers will be made in cash through local offices of
the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Wheat payments will total about $168 million and barley $7
million. No payments will be made for 1989 oats. The payments will
include a deduction for advance payments earlier this year.
   Deficiency payments are made to help make up the difference
between a target price and the higher of the price support loan
rate or a five-month market price average.
   For example, the target price for wheat this year is $4.10 per
bushel and the basic loan rate is $2.57 per bushel. The market
price average for five months was $3.78 per bushel.
   Thus, the deficiency payment rate would be 32 cents per bushel,
the difference between the target and the market price. An advance
of 25 cents per bushel was made, so farmers will get 7 cents per
bushel at final settlement.

   A reduction in the use of wheat as animal feed
is partly responsible for a sharp jump in global corn trade, says
the Agriculture Department.
   In the last four years, world corn shipments have increased an
estimated 28 percent, the largest increase since the late 1970s,
the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said Wednesday in a
report.
   ``There has been some worldwide step-up in animal feeding,
particularly in the (Soviet Union) and major East Asian markets,''
the report said. ``But, in the last two years, an additional reason
for the sharp expansion ... is the reduced use of wheat for feed,
caused by relatively low global wheat supplies.''
   As a result, wheat has become more expensive in relation to the
livestock feeding value of corn.
   Further, the report said, U.S. corn exports have nearly doubled
in the last few years, while exports of other foreign suppliers
have dropped by one-third, due to ``shifts to more profitable crops
like oilseeds, increased domestic utilization'' and poor crops.
   ``The net result is that the U.S. now provides nearly 80 percent
of the world's corn export needs, up dramatically from just a few
years ago,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Actor Says Mother's Attempt to Control His Estate is Vindictive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Coleman called his mother's attempt to
wrest control of his estate vindictive, and his lawyer said
allegations in her court request may damage the actor's career.
   Coleman, 21, and attorney Charles Wake responded Wednesday to
Edmonia Sue Coleman's statements in court documents asserting her
son was incapable of handling his $6 million fortune.
   ``My mother's latest legal action obviously stems from her
frustration at not being able to control my life,'' said Coleman,
star of the old ``Diff'rent Strokes'' TV series.
   Mrs. Coleman's conservatorship petition, filed Monday, said his
deteriorating physical and mental condition puts him at
``significant risk of financial exploitation.''
   ``The allegations upon which Sue Coleman's petition is based are
simply not true,'' said Wake. ``This sort of tactic will only
backfire because it will expose Gary's parents to additional
liability for malicious prosecution.
   ``The potential damage to Gary's career is enormous, and this
sort of accusation can be extremely harmful even though it has no
foundation whatsoever.''
   Mrs. Coleman asked that a conservator be appointed for her son
and that U.S. Trust Co. of California be placed in control of
assets that include $6 million in property and annual income of
$750,000.
   A Superior Court hearing on the request was scheduled for Jan. 3.
   It was latest action in the continuing legal wrangle between
Coleman and his parents.
   In February, Coleman filed suit in Santa Monica against his
parents and former business adviser Anita DeThomas, alleging they
improperly profited from his financial success.
   The lawsuit alleges the Colemans and DeThomas diverted his
profits and assets to themselves. Coleman said in his suit that he
felt his parents were unduly influenced by DeThomas.
   ``I was very hurt by the vindictive response it caused,''
Coleman said Wednesday.
   Coleman was born with an atrophied right kidney and has
undergone two transplants during a childhood that required frequent
dialysis and medications, the court documents said.
   Mrs. Coleman said she was concerned about her son's business
manager, Dion Mial, whom she described as a 25-year-old unemployed
Michael Jackson impersonator.
   Coleman was 10 when ``Diff'rent Strokes'' made it debut in
November 1978 and his character Arnold Jackson, opposite co-star
Todd Bridges, became a hit with young viewers. His twinkling eyes,
pudgy cheeks and flawless timing helped make the TV situation
comedy a ratings winner.

<HEAD>How Canada's Worst Mass Murder Unfolded</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Canada-Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first call from the University of Montreal
came into the city's emergency 911 phone line in late afternoon.
   ``There is a hostage-taking, there is gunfire and there are lots
of people wounded,'' police quoted the caller as saying.
   It was the beginning of what may be the worst mass shooting in
Canadian history. When it was over, 14 women had been killed, the
gunman had committed suicide, and a dozen other people had been
rushed to hospital operating rooms.
   Based on police and eyewitness accounts, the drama began as
students were ending their last classes of the term.
   About 4:30 p.m., a man thought to be in his twenties and dressed
in hunting garb entered the cafeteria on the first floor of the
university's engineering building and opened fire with what police
believe was a .22-caliber rifle, killing three women.
   The gunman then went up to the second floor and walked into a
packed classroom, where he ordered the men into one corner of the
room and the women into another.
   Several of the students, who had been making oral presentations
on the final day of classes before exams, said later they thought
it was a joke.
   But the gunman fired a shot into the wall, and they quickly
followed his instructions.
   He told the men to leave. They did so, and police said the
gunman screamed before opening fire on the women: ``You're all a
bunch of feminists.''
   Six slain women were later found in the classroom.
   On the same floor, he killed a woman in an administration office.
   Then he climbed to the third floor, where he shot four more
women in the corridor. ``It was a human hunt and we were the
quarry,'' said one witness quoted by Canadian Press.
   ``He was clearly gunning for the women,'' said another student.
   He continued up to the fourth and fifth floors, shooting and
wounding both men and women.
   Then, police say, he returned to the third floor and turned the
gun on himself.
   One police officer who was called to the scene discovered his
daughter was among the dead.

<TEXT>
   T. David Franklin wants the world know
he's broke. But appeals for money, like the one containing pieces
of the Berlin Wall, keep streaming in.
   The package was delivered even though it was addressed to ``The
Millionaire David Franklin'' in ``Portland, Maine U.S.A.''
   It came from a young West Berlin woman who had read news reports
about the 32-year-old benefactor's efforts to help residents in his
adopted city of Portland start their own businesses.
   ``As a sign that a new time begins, I send you a little part of
the original Berlin Wall _ a sign that people should come together
and help each other in peace, love and harmony,'' the woman wrote
in asking Franklin to finance her health-related studies.
   Appeals have poured in by the thousands, said Franklin. He says
his life has changed dramatically in the six weeks since he placed
a classified ad in local newspapers offering to bankroll first-time
entrepreneurs and provide them with office space and business
advice.
   Enthusiasm and hard work were the traits the community college
dropout from a blue-collar Baltimore suburb sought in examining the
flood of applicants before selecting 15 beneficiaries of his
interest-free loans.
   ``These were people who didn't need a push,'' he said. ``They
had the enthusiasm. They just needed the guidance.''
   After writing checks totaling more than $220,000 and wondering
aloud how he will pay his next mortgage payment on the apartment
house where he lives and works, Franklin has a standard reply to
the unending pleas:
   ``I'm broke. I'm out of money.''
   Undaunted, applicants often ask Franklin to put their names on a
waiting list for any future largesse.
   Franklin acknowledged that, though he may be strapped for cash,
he probably remains a millionaire on paper. That's because of the
appreciation in value of real estate he accumulated in Baltimore,
New Hampshire and Maine as his career as a computer salesman
blossomed.
   He resigned his lucrative sales job last spring out of boredom
and invested in a computer company in Portland. He then looked at
job possibilities in the area, found nothing of interest, and
decided to use his business talents to help others.
   Franklin insists he was ``just an average guy'' before his
newspaper ad made him an international celebrity and propelled him
into 16-hour workdays.
   Recipients of Franklin's seed money include several welfare
recipients, a recently discharged serviceman and an ex-convict
trying to earn a living as an artist.
   The start-up money has ranged from as little as $200 for
supplies and equipment to help a young woman begin a cleaning
business to $100,000 to publish the comic book artist's work.
   Form months, 23-year-old Bonnie Robinson wanted to open the
cleaning business to get off welfare, but couldn't afford a vacuum
cleaner or other supplies.
   So she answered Franklin's ad and he helped her buy the
equipment.
   But she admits to being leery after first reading the ad: ``I
thought maybe it was a guy who wanted to kidnap people and sell
children, so I made sure not to bring my daughter.''
   Franklin, who embarked on the project three months after his
arrival in Portland, said the role of benefactor is a weighty
burden.
   ``A lot of people don't realize this but it's a big
responsibility when you're dealing with people's dreams,'' he said.
``They're looking up to you as an answer. It's frightening.''
   Diane Branscomb, associate director of the Small Business
Development Center at the University of Southern Maine, said people
applying to Franklin should be cautious because they are vulnerable
when they start a business, even if it is with someone else's money.
   ``They could put in the time and effort and blood, sweat and
tears and lose the whole kit and caboodle,'' she said.

   The first family's Christmas tree, a
Pennsylvania-grown Fraser Fir, is at the White House, arriving in a
carriage drawn by two Clydesdale horses.
   The 18-foot tree will sit in the Blue Room, decorated with
``soft sculptures depicting well-known characters from
literature,'' Jean Becker, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said
Wednesday.
   The tree's theme is family literacy, Becker said, adding that it
will be decorated by Monday.
   With first lady Barbara Bush looking on, the tree was hauled
from the White House gate to the North Portico in a wreath-adorned
carriage pulled by Clydesdales.
   Mrs. Bush stroked the tree admiringly, but the horses made
Millie, the Bush family dog, nervous.
   ``Stay right where you are,'' Mrs. Bush said in a commanding
tone to the horses as Millie cowered nearby.
   Finally, the first lady scooped up Millie in her arms as
photographers frantically maneuvered to get the shot.
   ``It's just because she's never seen a horse before,'' Mrs. Bush
said. ``Millie cannot steal this show, please.''
   Growers Duane, Meade and Bradley Berkey of Spartansburg, Pa.,
won a contest sponsored by the National Christmas Tree Association
for the right to have one of their trees displayed at the nation's
most prominent residence.
   A White House delegation traveled to the family's 140-acre farm,
selecting a 21-foot tree sturdy enough to support 100 dolls. The
tree will be cut down to 18 feet.
   Bradley Berkey brought his two children, Melissa, 4, and Jaime,
6, to Wednesday's ceremony, and they were invited to sit in the
carriage as it rolled past reporters and guests.
   The growers wondered how the tree would fit through the White
House door.
   ``Miracles happen every year here. Don't worry, it'll get in,''
Mrs. Bush said.
   The White House tree is different from the National Christmas
Tree, a 35-foot blue spruce, also from Pennsylvania, transplanted
here in 1977 to be the centerpiece of an annual holiday pageant.
   That tree, which sits on the grassy Ellipse south of the White
House, will be lighted at a Dec. 14 ceremony.

remains under subpoena and may be called back for additional
testimony, the panel's chairman says.
   Steven Gobie, who claims to have run a male prostitution ring
out of Frank's Capitol Hill apartment, testified for four hours
Wednesday at a closed meeting of the ethics committee.
   In past comments, Gobie had suggested that he had information
embarrassing to other members of Congress besides Frank, D-Mass.
But after the hearing, the ethics panel's chairman, Rep. Julian
Dixon, D-Calif., said Gobie's testimony did not expand the scope of
the investigation.
   Dixon said Gobie may be called back for additional testimony,
but that the investigation ``isn't any broader'' as a result of the
information he provided Wednesday.
   Frank has said he had a brief sexual relationship with Gobie
after meeting him and paying him $80 for sex in 1985. He said he
later hired Gobie with personal funds to serve as a housekeeper and
driver from July 1985 through August 1987.
   Frank has acknowledged that he intervened with Virginia
probation authorities on Gobie's behalf. But he denies other
allegations by Gobie, including that he knew Gobie was running a
prostitution ring from his apartment, and that Gobie evidently took
advantage of him.
   Frank had acknowledged his homosexuality before Gobie's
allegations were made.
   Leaving the session, Gobie said he was not out to destroy
Frank's reputation and career.
   ``I think he's a very fine person. I always have and I always
will. I think he's one of the best people up on the hill,'' Gobie
said.
   Frank has not yet testified to the committee. Neither Frank nor
his attorney, Stephen Sachs, attended Wednesday's session.
   Dixon said the committee will continue its investigation through
the current congressional recess, which is scheduled to end Jan. 23.

   Cuba, ending a prolonged silence, says 2,016
military and other Cuban personnel have died in Angola since
President Fidel Castro began his commitment there 14 years ago.
   Angel Pino, a spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission here,
gave that figure Wednesday in announcing that the remains of all
Cubans who died carrying out international missions in Angola and
elsewhere have been returned to Cuba in recent days.
   The Cuban casualty toll had never before been discussed
officially.
   The dead were being honored at a ceremony today outside Havana
at which Castro was due to participate along with Angolan President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Ethiopian Vice President Fisseha Desta.
   Pino said 2,289 Cubans, including troops and civilian technical
advisers, have died abroad over the years. More than 400,000 have
participated in such missions, mostly in Africa.
   Pino said 160 Cubans died in Ethiopia, where thousands of Cuban
troops were sent in 1977, two years after Cuba's involvement in
Angola began.
   The number of Cuban dead in Angola has been the subject of
considerable speculation over the years, but Cuba has always
regarded the figure as a state secret. Three years ago, Angolan
anti-communist rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, whose forces have been
fighting the Cuban-backed government for years, put the Cuban death
toll at more than 6,000.
   Of the 2,289 casualties, Pino said 863 were killed in combat,
595 died of illness and 829 were accident fatalities. The remains
of 36 Cubans could not be recovered; several others disappeared.
   The remains were returned to Cuba between Nov. 27 and Dec. 4 and
have been sent to their hometowns. Over the years, some families
have complained that the remains of relatives who died while
serving the revolution abroad had not been brought back to Cuba for
burial.
   At its peak, Cuban involvement in Angola reached 50,000
personnel but Castro agreed last December to withdraw all its
forces by early 1991 as part of an accord brokered by U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker.
   Cuba's troop commitment to Ethiopia declined over the years,
ending several months ago.
   Cuba also has been involved in internationalist missions of
either a civilian or military nature in a number of other
countries, including Equatorial Guinea and Mozambique, and in the
Middle East and Asia as well.

   Joe Cruzan has watched with anguish for nearly
seven years as his daughter lies unconscious in a Missouri hospital
and he says listening to the Supreme Court consider her fate was
yet another sad event.
   It ``certainly was a very painful thing to sit through,'' Cruzan
said after the the justices heard arguments on whether his
daughter's feeding tube should be removed.
   ``I would like to be able to express my feelings to them why we
are very comfortable with our decision, why we feel that we are
doing what Nancy would want us to do,'' he said.
   Cruzan, a 55-year-old sheet metal worker from southwestern
Missouri, and his wife, want the nation's highest court to grant
their request for removal of a feeding tube sustaining their
brain-damaged daughter, Nancy.
   On Wednesday, justices for the first time took up the
``right-to-die'' issue as they heard oral arguments by attorneys in
the case of the 32-year-old woman, who has been in what doctors
call a persistent vegetative state since a 1983 automobile
accident. The Missouri Supreme Court has ruled that doctors cannot
remove the tube that supplies food and water keeping Ms. Cruzan
alive.
   The family's attorney, William Colby, told the justices that if
Ms. Cruzan were ``lucid for a moment and could come before this
court,'' she would ``choose liberty'' and ask for removal of the
feeding tube. But she will never recover to do that, he said.
   Assistant Attorney General Robert Presson of Missouri maintained
that Ms. Cruzan's parents have no right to permit their daughter's
death, especially without ``clear and convincing evidence'' she
would choose to die.
   Letting her die ``goes against the state's interest in
preventing suicide,'' he said.
   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the Bush administration's top
courtroom lawyer, supported the state's position.
   A ruling by the court is expected by July. The justices recently
have been reluctant to expand individual rights, but they gave no
clear sign on the outcome of the case as they questioned the
lawyers during arguments.
   Colby said after the case that he didn't expect the court to
issue a broad ruling on the the right-to-die question. An estimated
10,000 people in this country are being kept alive in a manner
similar to that used for Ms. Cruzan. Legal and medical officials
say the court's ruling could set a precedent in determining the
limits of life-sustaining care.
   Doctors say Ms. Cruzan could live for 30 years or more in her
current condition unless the feeding tube is removed. Her body is
rigid, her hands and feet constricted and bent into claw shapes.
She can breathe on her own and at times her eyes are open and move
randomly.
   Cruzan and his wife, Joyce, an older daughter and two
grandchildren watched the Supreme Court proceedings.
   Afterward, he expressed concerns about the possible effects on
other families if the high court denies his daughter a right to
die. He contended it would force people to consider initially not
ordering life-sustaining treatment for fear that it could not later
be stopped.
   ``This puts families in a terrible situation of being faced with
making a decision about life support when there is still hope, when
it still might do some good,'' he said.
   Asked how he thought the oral arguments played out to the
justices, Cruzan replied, ``I have no idea. I'm not an attorney.
I'm just a spectator.''

   Lawyers for a man convicted of operating a
drug ring that took in $2 million a week in the nation's capital
say they will appeal the verdict, while U.S. Attorney Jay B.
Stephens says the convicted dealer will now face other charges.
   Rayful Edmond III, 24, was convicted Wednesday of operating a
cocaine distribution network that prosecutors said was responsible
for up to 30 percent of the cocaine sold in the District of
Columbia.
   A 12-member U.S. District Court jury found Edmond guilty of all
seven charges against him after more than four days of
deliberations, capping a 12-week trial held amid extremely tight
security. The verdict means Edmond faces a mandatory life prison
sentence. Ten other defendants were convicted of assisting him.
   ``Everyone on the defense team is upset by the verdict,'' said
William Murphy, one of Edmond's attorneys. ``We had the cards
stacked against us from the beginning ... and we are going to
appeal.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Charles Richey has not yet set a
sentencing date for Edmond or his associates.
   Edmond faces additional charges, including three counts of
first-degree murder and conspiracy. Stephens said he plans to try
Edmond on those charges, despite the mandatory life sentence in the
drug distribution case.
   ``Our immediate plan is to proceed,'' Stephens said. ``The
primary goal ... is to bring this organization to a halt.''
   Prosecutors had described Edmond's drug network as a blend of
family members and close friends who conducted their operations
with a sophisticated _ and deadly _ entrepreneurial flare.
   The charges against Edmond included conspiracy to violate drug
laws, employing minors to possess and distribute cocaine, traveling
across state lines to sell drugs and using a telephone to set up
illegal drug deals.
   Convictions on those counts satisfy a definition of a continuing
criminal enterprise, a crime that carries a mandatory life sentence.
   Edmond's 10 co-defendants, including an aunt, a sister, a
brother and several close friends, were found guilty of conspiracy
to deal drugs. That crime carries a penalty of 10 years to life in
prison.
   At its peak last summer, the prosecutors charged, the Edmond
network was pumping up to 440 pounds of cocaine per week into the
streets of Washington.
   ``The message should be clear _ if you deal death and
destruction, you will pay with your life,'' Stephens said. After
noting that Edmond had been perceived by some friends and neighbors
as a hero for his ability to make money, the prosecutor said Edmond
should be seen instead as a ``purveyor of human destruction.''
   The trial featured extremely strict security measures. At the
outset, Richey ruled that jurors' names be kept secret even from
himself and lawyers to protect the jury from reprisals. The home of
one witness' mother was firebombed during the trial and an
informant was shot after his name was accidentally divulged by the
prosecution.
   Defense lawyer James Robertson suggested that the unusual
security provisions _ including a 1{-inch bullet-proof shield
around the courtroom _ made it impossible for the defendants to
receive a fair trial.
   ``No matter what happened in that courtroom, it was going to
make it very difficult to give Mr. Edmond the benefit of the
doubt,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poll: More Americans See Communism on the Wane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half of all Americans believe communism is
dying, twice the number who thought so nine months ago, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   The survey found views of communism shifting radically as reform
sweeps Eastern Europe, with far fewer Americans now seeing the
Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies as a threat.
   But more Americans feel threatened by China, where authorities
in June suppressed pro-democracy demonstrators. And the poll found
no change in the relatively high level of concern about communism
in Latin America.
   The survey tracked opinion by repeating questions that first
were asked in a Media General-Associated Press poll in March, a few
months before the democratic reform movement gained full force in
Eastern Europe.
   The change in opinion was striking. Then, for example, only 19
percent said communism was on the decline around the world. In the
new poll, 54 percent said communism was declining worldwide _ a
nearly threefold increase.
   Similarly, 52 percent regarded communism in Eastern Europe as
less of a threat to U.S. security now than in the past; in March,
just 28 percent held that view. And 51 percent in the new poll saw
Soviet communism as less of a threat to the United States, up from
38 percent nine months ago.
   In one of their broadest measures, the surveys asked
respondents: ``In your view, is communism dying, or not?'' In
March, 25 percent said yes. In the new poll, 52 percent said yes.
   The new survey was conducted Nov. 17-25, as many of the changes
reshaping Eastern Europe were still evolving. The changes, some of
which culminated after the poll was done, include establishment of
a partially non-communist government in Poland and the fall of
Communist leaderships in East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   Optimism was the greatest for East Germany, where on Nov. 9 the
Berlin Wall was opened after 28 years of division from the West.
Sixty percent in the survey expected that within their lifetimes
East Germans will enjoy the same freedoms Americans have now.
   By contrast, only 26 percent expected American-style freedoms to
come within their lifetimes to residents of the Soviet Union, where
reforms are progressing more slowly and the Communist party retains
supremacy. And only 14 percent expected such freedoms in China,
where soldiers staged a bloody crackdown on dissidents near
Tiananmen Square on June 3-4.
   Indeed, during the past nine months more Americans have come to
see China as an increasing threat to the United States, while those
seeing China as less of a threat fell from 34 percent in March to
20 percent now.
   While fewer Americans now believe China is moving away from
communist political and economic systems, the opposite was true for
Eastern Europe and for the Soviet Union.
   Seventy-five percent believed some of the Eastern European
countries are moving away from communist economies, up from 47
percent in March. And 70 percent believed some of Eastern Europe
was dropping the communist system, more than double the number in
March.
   The movement of opinion about the Soviet Union, like the change
there, was less abrupt. Sixty-seven percent believed the Soviets
are leaving their communist economic system, up from 58 percent;
and 48 percent believed the Soviets are changing their political
structure, up from 31 percent.
   As in the earlier poll, concern was greatest about communism in
Latin America: Forty-six percent called it an increasing threat to
the United States, virtually unchanged from March.
   Men and more highly educated respondents in the new poll were
likeliest to believe that communism is declining or even dying, and
that the threat to the United States posed by the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe is decreasing.
   The survey, conducted by telephone, had a margin of sampling
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Stocks Hit Another New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
Thursday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange set
another new high.
   The dollar closed at 144.13 yen, up 0.38 yen from Wednesday's
close of 143.75 yen. After opening at 143.95 yen, the U.S. currency
ranged between 143.94 and 144.33 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which rose 160.12 points for a record closing of 37,654.29
Wednesday, added another 203.82 points, or 0.54 percent, to close
at 37,858.11, another new high.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's bullish opening in Tokyo was
largely due to the currency's gains on overseas markets overnight.
   The dollar-buying was triggered by warnings issued by the East
German military that it would not tolerate attempts by citizens to
seize munitions from security installations, according to dealers.
A fleeting fear that the military might take action to block the
country's reform movement led some to sell the West German currency
for dollars, they said.
   The dollar's decline against the mark in New York was
accelerated overnight by comments from U.S. Undersecretary of the
Treasury David Mulford, who said the United States was ``not
alarmed'' about the dollar's recent steep 10 percent decline
against the mark.
   He also noted the dollar has only slipped 2 percent against the
yen.
   The New York market took Mulford's comments to mean that the
U.S. central bank has not been intervening to shore up the sagging
dollar, as many had thought.
   Securities dealers said the Nikkei index rose as market players
were reassured by an Economic Planning Agency announcement of 2.9
percent growth in Japan's real gross national product in the
July-September quarter over the previous quarter.
   The rise in inflation-adjusted GNP was equivalent to an annual
12.2 percent growth, the largest since 1973, according to the
agency.
   ``Trading is becoming more active and broader,'' said a dealer
at Nikko Securities Co., requesting anonymity. ``I expect the
bullish trend to continue for some time.''

<TEXT>
   A father whose entire family was among
the 27 people killed in a fiery bus crash cast a stern gaze from
the witness stand at the man accused in the nation's deadliest
alcohol-related traffic accident.
   ``I just wanted to see if the man sitting over there being tried
for the murder of my three girls would have enough compassion to
look my way as I looked his way,'' Army 1st Sgt. Lee Williams said
after testifying Wednesday in Larry Mahoney's murder and
drunken-driving trial.
   ``And I didn't see it.''
   From the witness stand in Carroll Circuit Court, Williams glared
at Mahoney as he told of losing his wife, Marilyn Joy, 34, and
daughters Kristen, 14 and Robin, 10.
   Williams was the last in a series of parents and spouses who
testified about the 24 youths and three adults who died in the May
14, 1988, crash.
   Authorities said the crash occurred when Mahoney drove his
pickup truck in the wrong lanes of Interstate 71 south of this Ohio
River town and plowed into the bus owned by the First Assembly of
God Church in Radcliff.
   In July, Williams married the widow of another crash victim,
Dotty Pearman Williams, who also testified about her loss.
   Her husband, bus driver John Pearman, and a niece were killed.
Her daughter, Christy, survived with severe burns.
   ``Christy returned and was severely injured,'' Mrs. Williams
said. ``John was brought back in a cold, black body bag.''
   In other testimony, two witnesses said Mahoney was drunk the
night of the crash.
   Kerry Cantrell, a laboratory supervisor from Humana
Hospital-University of Louisville, testified a blood sample drawn
from Mahoney after the crash showed a blood alcohol level of 0.24.
   Terry Comstock, a state police chemist, said he tested the same
blood sample drawn four days after the crash. His tests showed
blood alcohol levels of 0.18 and 0.20.
   In Kentucky, a person is considered intoxicated if their blood
alcohol level is at least 0.10.
   Defense attorney Russell Baldani attacked the discrepancy among
the three tests.
   Mahoney, 36, is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of
wanton endangerment, 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken
driving.
   Testimony of the parents and spouses was brief because a
Kentucky Supreme Court decision limits questioning of homicide
victims' family members to basic biographical information about the
deceased, said Assistant Attorney General Paul Richwalsky Jr.
   But Williams said even a short time on the stand was painful.
   ``When the lawyer says, `When was the last time you saw your
family?' ... for a second or two, I honestly saw Kristen walk down
the hall to the bedroom, and I remember putting my arms around her
and I remember kissing her goodbye and telling her I loved her,''
Williams told reporters later.
   He spoke at length and in heart-breaking detail about his
experiences during the trial.
   ``This is the second Christmas I'm going without my two
daughters,'' Williams said. ``And I miss them every day.''
   Williams viewed Mahoney's three emotional outbursts in court
last month as an expression of guilt but not sorrow.
   ``But for his three times, I have broken down three thousand
times,'' Williams said.

<HEAD>Navy Defends Billion Dollar Destroyer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is defending its new $1.2 billion
destroyer in the wake of fresh charges that the ship could be
detected by Soviet airborne radar despite Pentagon attempts to make
it radar-evading.
   ``With the Arleigh Burke class, this is the best warship the
world has seen,'' Navy spokesman Lt. Bruce Cole said in response to
allegations from one lawmaker that the destroyer program is fraught
with technical and financial problems.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who last September called the $33
billion destroyer program a ``procurement nightmare'' of cost
overruns and schedule delays, contended Wednesday that the Navy was
forced to bail out the destroyer's manufacturer _ Bath Iron Works
Corp. of Maine.
   In a letter to Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla., Dingell said
Bath Iron Works faced serious financial problems and the Navy spent
between $75 million to $90 million to save the company. The
Michigan Democrat also said the money came from unspecified
Pentagon accounts and questioned whether ``slush funds'' were
common at the Defense Department.
   ``Clearly, I think the Navy and the contractors are attempting
to hoodwink both of us,'' Dingell said in a three-page letter to
Bennett, chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on
seapower and strategic and critical materials.
   The letter, dated Dec. 4, was obtained by The Associated Press.
   Duane D. Fitzgerald, president and chief operating officer of
Bath Iron Works, called the bailout suggestion ``laughable.'' He
said the Navy and the company did agree on contract adjustments,
but they totaled $35 million.
   The Navy denied that a bailout took place and stressed that the
ships, hailed as the most advanced combat ships ever, will be built
within budget.
   Bennett, in a two-paragraph statement released late Wednesday,
said he received Dingell's letter, which ``makes many assertions
and raises many questions of fact.''
   ``The Navy tells me today that some of this information is
incorrect, and that some of the letter's conclusions are
unjustified,'' said Bennett, who cautioned against jumping to
conclusions but promised a subcommittee inquiry into the destroyer
program when Congress returns in January.
   The DDG-51 destroyer, named after Arleigh Burke, World War II
naval hero and former chief of naval operations, is designed with a
more expensive all-steel superstructure instead of one that was
part aluminum and more prone to splintering and fire damage.
   The first destroyer, which is scheduled to be delivered to the
Navy in February 1991, will be equipped with sophisticated Aegis
computers and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
   The Navy has tried to reduce the destroyer's radar
cross-section, which is the enemy's ability to discern the type of
ship showing up on radar, and give it some of the characteristics
of the Air Force's B-2 stealth bomber.
   The steps taken by the Navy to reduce the radar cross-section of
the new destroyer include ``more rounded edges and less 90-degree
angles. ... A reduction in cross-section means an enemy has to get
in closer,'' Cole said. The same approach was taken with the B-2.
   Dingell contends that incorporating stealth characteristics on
an 8,315-ton all-steel ship became an overwhelming design and
engineering problem for Bath Iron Works that led to the contract
increases.
   Dingell also said that ``according to experts, an airborne radar
at an altitude of 50,000 feet would detect it easily at over 300
miles.''
   Complicating the situation is the number of Soviet
anti-radiation missiles that can be air-launched, ship-launched or
submarine-launched, said Dingell, who cited a secret report by the
Defense Intelligence Agency and Central Intelligence Agency titled,
``Special Assessment on the Anti-Radiation Missile Threat.''
   Fitzgerald questioned the appropriateness of Dingell's
references to a classified issue such as naval radar capability.
   ``The whole business of radar signature still has same
classifications. Congressman Dingell can choose to violate his
security clearance. I don't choose to violate mine,'' Fitzgerald
said.
   ``Suffice it to say we think he's wrong,'' the executive added.

<TEXT>
   A man with a long history of juvenile
offenses was executed by injection early Thursday for the
robbery-murder of a woman whose pleas for mercy were recorded by a
police dispatcher.
   Carlos DeLuna, 27, was pronounced dead at 12:24 a.m. He was
condemned to death for the 1983 robbery-slaying of Wanda Jean
Lopez, 24, a service station clerk in Corpus Christi.
   ``I want to say I hold no grudges,'' DeLuna said in a brief
final statement. ``I hate nobody. I want my family to know I love
them. I want to tell everyone on death row to keep the faith up _
to keep going. Everything will be all right.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court rejected by a 7-2 vote a request to halt
the execution until a new appeal could be filed on his behalf. The
5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to block it Tuesday.
   DeLuna was the fourth person executed this year in Texas,
bringing to 33 the number of executions in the state since the
Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976. The
total is the highest of any state. Nationwide, 120 people have been
put to death.
   Ms. Lopez, alerted by customers that a man with a knife was
outside the station, was on the phone with police when DeLuna came
in for a pack of cigarettes Feb. 4, 1983.
   ``On the tape, she's talking to the cops. ... And then you heard
that scream,'' said Steve Schiwetz, the assistant district attorney
who prosecuted DeLuna. ``He was just real belligerent. This was
totally uncalled for. There was just no reason to kill this girl.
He didn't know her.
   ``The last thing she was saying was, `I'll give the money.' But
he just wanted to stick her with the knife. It's really a bad
deal.''
   DeLuna, on parole for about six weeks after serving part of a
three-year sentence for attempted rape and car theft, was arrested
after he was found hiding under a truck near the slaying. Witnesses
identified him at trial.
   He had insisted another person committed the crime but has
refused to elaborate.
   ``I'm not going to talk about it,'' he said. ``I took the stand.
The jury didn't believe me.''
   The high school dropout blamed his problems on alcohol and drug
abuse, plus getting mixed up with ``the wrong crowd.''
   Schiwetz said DeLuna's juvenile record included numerous thefts.
``This guy stole every car in Corpus Christi before he was 18.''
   DeLuna said in his last interview a week ago that he was afraid
of dying.
   ``I don't think anybody can prepare yourself for dying,'' he
said. ``I can't imagine myself lying down on that gurney. I try to
but I can't.''

<HEAD>Newly Empowered Citizen Investigators Turn Tables on Secret Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With PM-East Germany, Bjt ^By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>

   A nervous Hans Jurich gestured toward the
rain-soaked grounds of the secret police institute he directs, a
place where workers crack codes and build eavesdropping devices.
   ``As you can see there are no helicopters or tanks here now,''
he offered.
   In an odd switch that only could have come during these heady
days of the East German uprising, it was the secret police who were
getting the third degree.
   Jurich's interrogators were reform activists from a new citizens
committee that has taken it upon itself to probe official
corruption.
   Three activists from the organization, which is quartered above
a religious bookstore on Sophienstrasse, jumped into a
mud-encrusted Volkswagen Golf on Wednesday after getting a call
from colleagues with a hot tip.
   ``All we know is that witnesses in the area have reported that
helicopters and tanks were moving around yesterday and trucks were
seen hauling away material,'' Gabriela Kleiner of the New Forum
pro-democracy group explained as the car careened through East
Berlin's muddy central streets.
   ``This could be dangerous. That's why we are taking along the
press, as protection.''
   A carload of journalists from the Communist-run Berliner Zeitung
followed behind the speeding graftbusters.
   The ``Independent Investigative Committee'' was formed by reform
movement activists on Sunday after word spread that ousted
Communist leaders accused of corruption were having incriminating
evidence removed from their offices.
   Angry citizens began standing watch around official buildings on
Monday and Tuesday until police could set up a security cordon to
prevent losses.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow has ordered police units to
cooperate with the citizens' committee, but officials are still
considering whether it should have access to information collected
by a government panel probing corruption.
   East German television on Tuesday disclosed the group's
existence and gave out its address and telephone number for those
with information to relay.
   At least 200 calls were fielded overnight and early Wednesday at
the committee office.
   ``This is our second special action,'' explained Matthias
Etzold, driver of the Golf. ``But last time, on Monday, we arrived
too late and everything was gone.''
   Asked what they planned to do should they encounter the reported
tanks or helicopters, Ms. Kleiner said they would call the police.
   After 30 minutes of negotiating rutted roads, the car screeched
to a halt in front of a gated and guarded compound on
Kopenickstrasse.
   ``We're from the Independent Investigative Committee and we want
to talk to responsible officials,'' Etzold shouted through the
narrow opening of a clouded plexiglass window at an entrance
security booth.
   The whole entourage was invited in to meet with federal minister
for science and research, Peter-Klaus Budig, who hadn't noticed
tanks or air actions in recent days.
   ``But this is all necessary. I'm all for it,'' the smiling
official offered eagerly, commenting on the ambush visit. ``It's
necessary to clear the air and have a fresh start.''
   Maybe it was the compound next door, where the federal Ministry
for State Security operates a research institute, he offered.
   ``Yes, we were told you were coming,'' confessed the gate guard
at the secret police's Institute for Technical Research. ``Our
director will be here to talk with you in a moment.''
   Jurich, a portly, crew-cut bureaucrat sweating profusely despite
the damp December cold, had likely already been having a bad day,
since the entire leadership of the secret police resigned Tuesday
night under pressure.
   Reform groups had assailed the ministry's leadership for
allowing agents to do what they had done with impunity for years _
harass and beat protesters.
   Told of reports alleging removal of evidence from the premises,
Jurich laughed nervously and pointed out that there was no military
hardware in evidence.
   ``Mind if we have a look around?'' Etzold queried.
   First the answer was no, as the compound was a sensitive ``point
of manufacture of electronic warfare materials, which you can use
your imagination to calculate the use of,'' Jurich said.
   Then he offered a short tour of the metal-littered grounds in
consolation.
   ``We have nothing to hide,'' the director contended.
   The group was able to see nothing more complicated than rusting
pipes and palettes of what looked like mailboxes piled outside
factory doors.
   No, the investigators could not talk to workers. This was, after
all, a matter of state security.
   ``We've wasted our time,'' bemoaned Ms. Kleiner. ``The problem
is that we are so naive. This is a Mafia we are dealing with.''

<HEAD>Navy: Soviets Launch Aircraft From New Carrier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union can now launch ground-attack
jets from its first full-scale aircraft carrier, a naval aviation
advance that the U.S. Navy says holds the potential for offensive
use.
   The development came only days before Mikhail S. Gorbachev
pressed President Bush on naval arms control issues at the Malta
summit.
   The U.S. Navy confirmed on Wednesday that the 65,000-ton Tbilisi
aircraft carrier had launched and recovered three fighter jets
during trials in the Black Sea _ the MiG-29 Fulcrum, a SU-27
Flanker and the SU-25 Frogfoot ground attack aircraft.
   The Tbilisi's capabilities are a marked advance over the much
smaller Kiev-class carrier, which is capable of transporting only
helicopters and jump-jets.
   While the Tbilisi's sea trials are not unexpected, Navy
officials pointed to the type of aircraft used on the carrier as
interesting _ as well as the timing of the event.
   ``They are way ahead of schedule,'' said one Navy officer, who
spoke on condition he not be identified by name.
   Use of an aircraft carrier vastly improves Soviet tactical
aviation capabilities, allowing fighter jets to be launched far
beyond the range of Soviet borders.
   The Tbilisi is the first of its class, while two others are
under construction.
   The ship uses a ``ski jump'' bow to launch aircraft and not the
high-powered catapults that hurl jets from U.S. carriers. But the
Soviets do use the arresting wires that stop planes as they land on
the deck, just as the American carriers do.
   The Navy, in a statement pointing to the ship's offensive
capabilities, said:
   ``The Soviets have insisted that the Tbilisi ... (is) intended
for defensive purposes only. ... Nonetheless, the demonstrated
capability of the Tbilisi to accommodate a variant of one of the
Soviet Union's principal ground-attack aircraft, the Frogfoot,
shows a potential for offensive operations.''
   While Pentagon officials said the trials took place in
mid-November, the Navy confirmed them several days after Gorbachev
sought to ban short-range nuclear weapons aboard the superpowers'
ships, according to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Gorbachev illustrated his concern over the wide-ranging U.S.
Navy, giving Bush a map of U.S. naval bases, deployments and
maneuvers around the Soviet Union.
   In rejecting Gorbachev's argument, said Fitzwater, Bush
maintained that
   ``the Soviet Union is a land-based power. But the navy is
crucial to us in terms of maintaining all of our commitments around
the world, maintaining open sea lanes and commercial lanes around
the world.''
   Another defense official said the definition of the Soviet
warship as an aircraft carrier is of some importance to the region.
   ``The Soviets continue to tell Turkey that this is not an
aircraft carrier,'' he said, adding that the Soviets contend it is
a ``heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser.''
   Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey could bar the
movement of such a warship through the Dardanelles, which is the
passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the official
said.
   The convention put the control of the water passage in Turkish
hands, and it allows the nation to close the straits to warships of
other nations in time of war.
   The Soviets have stated that the Tbilisi will join the Northern
Fleet and operate out of the Kola Peninsula, the Navy said.

<HEAD>Baker Clears First Hurdle to Mideast Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III still
faces tough problems in getting Mideast peace talks started, even
with the conditional acceptance by the Palestine Liberation
Organization of a first round of negotiations.
   Baker will be able to convene talks in Washington early next
year with the foreign ministers of Egypt and Israel. However, going
beyond that stage will take slick maneuvering by Baker as well as
concessions from all sides.
   The PLO, speaking through Egypt, agreed Wednesday to the
session. The Israeli Cabinet agreed last month.
   But U.S. officials made it clear that the PLO and Israel still
have reservations about what happens next, and Baker will have to
find a way to ease their concerns to keep going.
   Basically, Yasser Arafat's group is clinging to its claim to
represent Palestinians everywhere. It wants to play a role in
selecting the Palestinian delegation that would meet with Israel in
Cairo as the next step in a drawn-out peace process.
   Israel, on the other hand, wants to exclude the PLO even from a
behind-the-scenes role. Baker's five-point program guarantees that
Israel will go to Cairo only ``after a satisfactory list of
Palestinians has been worked out.''
   But another provision of the Baker plan specifies that Egypt
cannot substitute itself for the Palestinians and that it ``will
consult with Palestinians on all aspects of the dialogue.''
   That could mean the PLO will be able to play an influential role
even if it's not at the table.
   Despite the problems, though, Baker achieved a breakthrough of
sorts after three months of dickering with Foreign Ministers Moshe
Arens of Israel and Esmat Abdel Meguid of Egypt.
   They will continue the bargaining at the Washington meeting,
which State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said would be
held in January, at the earliest.
   The U.S. goal is to carry out a proposal by Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir for elections among the 1.4 million
Palestinians who live on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The elected Palestinians would negotiate with Israel an
arrangement for limited self-rule. After the five-year experiment,
Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Palestinians would hold talks on an
overall settlement.
   The PLO has repeatedly denounced the Israeli scenario as a
scheme to undercut Palestinian aspirations for statehood.
   Baker telephoned Arens with the news of the PLO's conditional
acceptance. Arens told him the Israeli government would study the
response, said Ruth Yaron, spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy.
   A senior U.S. official, declining to be identified, said that
now that Baker has qualified acceptance from the PLO and Israel
``he can get down to work on dealing with their views.''
   Baker three months ago began an arduous diplomatic effort to
bridge the gap between the PLO and Israel. His plan includes the
Washington meeting with Arens and Meguid.
   Another provision of his five-point program, released by Ms.
Tutwiler, is that ``the United States understands that Israel will
attend the dialogue only after a satisfactory list of Palestinians
has been worked out.''
   A third provision guarantees that Egypt will consult with
Palestinians ``on all aspects of the dialogue.''
   A fourth assures the Palestinians that those who meet with
Israel ``would be free to raise issues that relate to their
opinions on how to make elections and the negotiating process
succeed.''
   This could be a vehicle for Palestinians to assert statehood
aspirations and also to register demands extending beyond the
limited self-rule Shamir envisions for five years on the West Bank
and in Gaza.
   For the past two years, Palestinians in the territories have
clashed with Israeli authorities. At least 626 have died in the
process, while 155 other Palestinians were killed by Arabs on
suspicion of cooperating with Israel. Also, 43 Israeli soldiers and
civilians died in the rebellion.
   The Baker formula makes no direct reference to the PLO, with
which the United States opened talks a year ago after Arafat
publicly renounced terrorism and said he accepted the existence of
Israel.
   Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, has been
meeting with PLO officials while Baker conducted negotiations
through Meguid.
   Ms. Tutwiler called the Egyptian reply a ``step forward'' for
the peace process. Last week, in Baker's behalf, she had ruled out
any U.S. action on the PLO's reservations until it first accepted
his formula.
   ``We have now received from the government of Egypt a positive
response to Secretary Baker's five-point framework,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   ``We will be working with the parties on steps needed to get to
a trilateral meeting in Washington as part of a process for
launching an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.''

<TEXT>
   A man who blamed his life of crime on
drugs and alcohol was put to death by injection early today for the
murder of a woman whose final cries of terror were recorded by a
police dispatcher.
   Carlos DeLuna became the 33rd murderer executed in Texas since
the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 decision to allow resumption of
capital punishment. The total is the highest of any state.
Nationwide, 120 people have been put to death.
   The high court cleared the way for the execution late Wednesday
by rejecting a request for a delay.
   DeLuna, 27, was pronounced dead at 12:24 a.m., 10 minutes after
corrections officials began injecting the lethal drugs into his arm.
   ``I want to say I hold no grudges, I hate nobody,'' he said
while strapped to a gurney in the death chamber. ``I want my family
to know I love them. I want to tell everyone on death row to keep
the faith up, to keep going. Everything will be all right.''
   He took three deep breaths and stopped moving.
   DeLuna was executed for the Feb. 4, 1983, robbery-slaying of
Wanda Jean Lopez, a 24-year-old service station clerk in Corpus
Christi.
   Ms. Lopez had called police for help after customers told her
they had seen a man with a knife outside the convenience store-gas
station where she worked.
   DeLuna came in for a pack of cigarettes, authorities said.
   ``On the tape, she's talking to the cops. ... And then you heard
that scream,'' said Steve Schiwetz, who prosecuted DeLuna.
   ``The last thing she was saying was, `I'll give the money.' But
he just wanted to stick her with the knife. It's really a bad
deal.''
   DeLuna, on parole for about six weeks after serving part of a
three-year sentence for attempted rape and car theft, was arrested
after he was found hiding under a truck near the slaying. Witnesses
identified him at trial.
   He had insisted another person committed the crime but refused
to elaborate.
   ``I'm not going to talk about it,'' he said. ``I took the stand.
The jury didn't believe me.''
   The high school dropout blamed his problems on alcohol and drug
abuse, plus getting mixed up with ``the wrong crowd.''
   Schiwetz said DeLuna's juvenile record included numerous thefts.
``This guy stole every car in Corpus Christi before he was 18.''
   DeLuna had come with 12 hours of execution in 1986 before a
federal judge halted the execution.
   In an interview last week, he said he was afraid of being
executed.
   ``I don't think anybody can prepare yourself for dying,'' he
said. ``I can't imagine myself lying down on that gurney. I try to
but I can't.''
   When told about the execution, Ms. Lopez' mother, Mary Vargas,
said, ``I'm glad this is over with.''

<HEAD>Quayle Says Foreigners Like Gorbachev Better Than Soviets Do</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle says the United
States should not get too hung up on Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's charming manner, while pointing out that foreigners
like him more than his own countrymen do.
   ``The personality can help bring about these reforms and we
should encourage that,'' Quayle said in a televised interview
Wednesday on the Cable News Network's ``Larry King Live'' show.
   ``The president wants to encourage that and he wants to offer
help to Chairman Gorbachev to have these reforms,'' the vice
president said. ``But instead of getting caught up in the magnetic
personality of Chairman Gorbachev, we've got to look beyond that
and see if there are true lasting reforms taking place.''
   Following President Bush's meetings at Malta with Gorbachev last
week, Quayle expressed skepticism about Soviet foreign policy,
saying in a published interview Monday that the Kremlin still wants
to ``create instability'' in other nations.
   While that view seemed to contrast with the friendly nature of
the talks between Bush and Gorbachev, White House officials moved
quickly to say there was no disagreement between the president and
the vice president.
   Before the vice president's televised remarks Wednesday, Soviet
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Quayle's views on Soviet
foreign policy ``sounded strange.''
   Quayle has consistently taken a tougher view of the Soviet Union
than other administration officials, and while he spoke well of
Gorbachev during Wednesday's interview, he said relations should
not be based on one man.
   ``We want him to succeed in perestroika, we want him to succeed
in glasnost,'' Quayle said.
   ``But sometime, Gorbachev will not, sometime down the road, will
not be the leader of the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   ``His popularity is probably greater outside the Soviet Union
than in the Soviet Union,'' Quayle said.
   Recent polls in the United States, West Germany and the Soviet
Union support Quayle's observations on Gorbachev's popularity, the
first time a high U.S. official has said such things.
   A survey for the West German magazine Der Spiegel last summer
found 82 percent of 2,000 voters polled were convinced that
Gorbachev's reform policies in the Soviet Union will succeed. A
parallel survey of 1,000 Moscow citizens conducted for the magazine
by the Soviet Academy of Sciences found that 59 percent thought
perestroika will succeed.
   In sheer popularity, Der Spiegel found that Gorbachev rated
higher than West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In the United
States, a Media General-Associated Press poll last month found that
Bush and Gorbachev have roughly equal popularity in this country.

   A young rifleman invaded the University of
Montreal engineering school on Wednesday and singled out females
for his targets, killing 14 women and wounding 12 people before
committing suicide, police said.
   Montreal Police Director Claude St. Laurent said the killer,
clad in a hunting outfit, rushed into a packed classroom at one
point during his murderouls rampage and yelled in French, ``You're
all a bunch of feminists!''
   A police officer who arrived on the scene found that his
daughter was among the dead in what may be the worst mass shooting
in Canadian history.
   Police did not identify the gunman, who was described as being
in his 20s and used what looked like a .22 caliber rifle as he
moved up the first three floors of the building, systematically
singling out women and shooting them.
   The gunman's first name was Marc _ no other name was released at
a late-night news conference by police _ and a three-page letter,
expressing his hatred for feminists, was found in his possession.
   The handwritten letter blamed unspecified failures in the
gunman's life on unidentified women and said he was going to kill
some women in revenge, said Jacques Duscheneau, a Montreal police
senior investigator.
   The man began the rampage in a first-floor cafeteria, where he
killed three women, St. Laurent said.
   The gunman then went up to the second floor and walked into a
packed classroom, ordering the men into one corner of the room and
the women into another, police said.
   He told the men to leave. They did so, and police said the
gunman screamed before opening fire on the women: ``You're all a
bunch of feminists.''
   Six slain women were later found in the classroom. On the same
floor, he killed a woman in an administration office.
   Then he climbed to the third floor, where he shot four more
women in the corridor. ``It was a human hunt and we were the
quarry,'' said one witness.
   He continued up to the fourth and fifth floors, shooting and
wounding both men and women.
   Then, police say, he returned to the third floor and turned the
gun on himself.
   St. Laurent at one point told reporters police were looking for
two accomplices but said later he was mistaken and the man acted
alone.
   ``I saw the bodies of the people who were slain _ they were all
women,'' said Louis Courville, director of the engineering school,
his voice shaking.
   One student said a bullet passed his leg and he brought his
hands up in a pleading gesture. The gunman left him alone.
   ``He was clearly gunning for the women,'' the student said.
   ``All I know is that a crazy guy came in here and began shooting
at anything that moved,'' said Dominique Berube, 22, one of scores
of terrified students who ran from the building.
   ``It's our friends who have been killed.''
   She said some people threw themselves on the floor while others
stood paralyzed.
   The injured, several in critical condition, were taken to four
hospitals.
   Frenzied parents rushed to the university and were told to
gather at a central location.
   ``I saw death close up and I shook,'' said student Vanthona Ouy,
22.
   Witnesses told police the gunman entered the classroom at about
5:20 p.m. EST.
   Students said the man emerged from the classroom, fired three or
four shots at a group of people and ran up a flight of stairs.
   Student Francois Bordeleau said he had to drag people by the
collar to keep them from going in the man's direction.
   He said he heard 20 to 30 shots and the man appeared to be
aiming mainly at women.
   ``I heard the gunman say: `I want the women,''' said Bordeleau.
   Several other witnesses confirmed that the gunman said that.
   Student Eric Chavarie said the gunman ``told us to stop
everything. And then when we looked at him we thought it was a
joke, but he fired a shot in the air and separated us into two
groups, the guys in one corner and the girls in (another) corner.
   ``When that was done he asked the guys to leave, he left the
girls in there. We got outside in the hallway and for a couple of
minutes he stayed in there and after when he got out he leveled his
gun at a group of people who were there and he shot three or four
shots.
   ``I saw some people fall.''
   Lucien Justin, who was in the computer room, said the assailant
first aimed at the wall there and then ran out.
   ``Somebody locked the door but he shot off the lock and then
left a second time,'' he said.
   ``I was terribly afraid, I ran like hell.''
   ``Who could have thought that something like this could happen
in a peaceful student world,'' said Ba Madou, 35, an engineering
student.
   ``People thought it was a joke,'' said Stephane Meunier, an
engineering student. ``People were in a state of shock.''
   At the Montreal General Hospital, Doug Lemm, assistant director
of security, said staff were at a Christmas party in the cafeteria
when victims began to arrive.
   He said the timing could not have been more fortunate.
   ``The party was scheduled from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. and there was no
booze. We called all the doctors and nurses to the operating room.''

<HEAD>Owners of Missing Lobster Boat Accused of Negligence in Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal lawsuit against the owners of
a missing lobster boat alleges that the vessel was unseaworthy and
its crew inadequately trained.
   The suit was brought in U.S. District Court in New Haven by the
parents, brother and sister of 22-year-old Michael Hare, one of the
five men aboard the missing Heidi Marie. It seeks unspecified
damages.
   Hare, of Pawcatuck, also had been a crewman on the Sophie G.,
another lobster boat owned by Garbo Enterprises Inc. of Stonington,
when it sank in 1988 without loss of life.
   The Coast Guard called off its search for the Heidi Marie on
Friday after spending 11 days searching more than 100,000 square
miles of ocean for the 72-foot lobster boat. The vessel was last
heard from Nov. 21 and was believed to have gone down in the North
Atlantic.
   The lawsuit, filed Monday, charged that the presumed death of
Hare was a result of negligence by the vessel's owners and
operators, BFD Fisheries Inc., Garbo Enterprises Inc., James Garbo
Sr., James Garbo Jr. and David Garbo.
   A woman who would only identify herself as the office manager at
Garbo Enterprises said Wednesday the Garbos would be unavailable to
comment on the lawsuit. ``It's a very tragic situation. They are
really not able to cope with any interviews at this point,'' she
said.
   According to the lawsuit, the owners and operators of the Heidi
Marie ordered the boat to sail either without getting available
weather information, or after ignoring weather information.
   Extremely poor weather hampered the search and presumably caused
the loss of the vessel.
   The lawsuit charges that the boat lacked adequate safety and
navigational equipment; the crew lacked adequate training, and the
vessel was not a safe place to work.
   Filing the suit were Hare's parents, Lewis and Roberta Hare;
brother, Alan M. Hare, and sister, Jennifer R. Lensis.

   The United States should press for additional

pact to reduce those weapons by as much as half, a former U.S. arms
negotiator says.
   ``Certainly we can afford to be more ambitious in our arms
control proposals,'' former arms negotiator Paul Warnke said
Wednesday in a speech to the Arms Control Association, a private
research group.
   Under the START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreement now
being negotiated, U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers, missiles and
submarines would be cut by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Warnke said that agreement could be completed and signed at the
summit President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
plan to hold in Washington next June, a meeting the two leaders
agreed to at the Malta Summit last week.
   ``There is no reason at all we can't go ahead with a START 2
treaty,'' Warnke said.
   Such a second treaty should aim at banning missiles with
multiple warheads, Warnke said.
   Warnke argued that Soviet troop withdrawals from Eastern Europe
and the political changes sweeping the Warsaw Pact countries mean
fewer nuclear weapons are needed to defend the West.
   He said the major obstacle in the strategic arms reduction talks
in Geneva was the U.S. program to devise a space shield against
ballistic missile attack.
   ``But that idea left town with Mr. Reagan,'' Warnke said of the
U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative championed by the former
president but viewed with skepticism by many in Congress and most
arms control experts.
   A ban on missiles with multiple warheads would eliminate the
threat of a nuclear first strike by either side, Warnke suggested.
   Such an attack would require so many single-warhead missiles the
aggressor would be unable to defend against nuclear retaliation _
and therefore would not launch an attack, he argued.
   But Warnke, who was former President Carter's chief negotiator,
stressed the two sides should complete the current START treaty
first before making deeper cuts in their strategic weapons.
   Congress has approved a Bush administration plan to extend the
U.S. arsenal of land-based missiles armed with multiple warheads
that could reach all targets within the Soviet Union by putting
some on rail cars that could move around in a crisis, making them
harder for the Soviets to destroy.
   Warnke said that ``probably was a lousy idea'' and would
escalate nuclear tensions.

<HEAD>`Bear Man of Pack Creek' Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stan Price, who became a symbol of
peaceful coexistence between humans and brown bears, has died of
cancer. He was 90.
   Price, known as the ``bear man of Pack Creek,'' died Tuesday at
the home of his great-nephew, Gary Lingle of Juneau, where he had
been living since October.
   He lived for 40 years along the shores of Pack Creek on
Admiralty Island, which attracts thousands of visitors to see the
world's largest concentration of brown bears.
   But Price himself also was an attraction _ a small, white-haired
man who casually strolled among the fearsome-looking bruins, which
can weigh more than 1,000 pounds, with nothing more than a walking
stick for protection.
   A native of Missouri, Price arrived in southeast Alaska in 1927
in a sailboat he had built in Seattle. In 1928, he set up a mining
and logging operation at Windham Bay not far from Pack Creek, 30
miles south of Juneau. He also worked as a mechanic, fisherman and
fox farmer.
   In the 20 years that he regularly visited his great-uncle,
Lingle said he always felt safe walking with Price because of the
special relationship he had with the bears.
   ``He always said if you're friends with the bears, the bears
will be friends with you,'' Lingle said. ``He had a mutual respect
with the bears and the proof is that he lived there for 40 years
with only one incident.''
   That occurred on a narrow path between Price's woodshed and his
house on a beach. Price and a brown bear surprised each other and a
face off began with neither backing down. The big brownie finally
swatted Price, breaking his collarbone.
   Despite living in close quarters with about 25 brown bears that
roam the Pack Creek area, Price never carried a rifle. A quick bop
on the nose with his walking stick was usually sufficient if a bear
got testy.
   As word of Price's special relationship with the bears spread,
films, television shows and magazines told his story. During the
1980s, the number of visitors to Pack Creek increased dramatically.
   ``He had a gentleness and a special way of communicating with
the bears,'' said Joel Bennett, a Juneau wildlife filmmaker and
Alaska Board of Game member. ``He didn't subscribe to the theory
that they were marauding killers lurking behind every tree.''
   Bennett said Price would walk to within 6 feet of the animals
and talk to them.
   ``This is the passing of a grand old man that represents a
unique part of the heritage of Alaska,'' Bennett said. ``His legacy
is that people can coexist with wildlife peacefully if we try. He
taught that by example.''
   Survivors include Price's second wife, Esther, who lives in
Arkansas and has Alzheimer's disease, Lingle said. His first wife
died of cancer.

   The use of U.S. fighter jets to
support President Corazon Aquino during the attempted coup has
triggered nationalist outrage and added a new element to talks on
U.S. bases negotiations.
   While rebels made threatening statements toward the
approximately 100,000 U.S. citizens in the Philippines in response
to Washington's decision, they took no action against Americans
trapped in rebel-held hotels.
   Indeed, public indignation largely has focused on Mrs. Aquino's
reliance on U.S. military help in crushing the coup, the most
serious since she took office in February 1986.
   ``When push came to shove, this government ... yelled for the
Yanks. I for one am ashamed,'' wrote respected political
commentator Max V. Soliven in the Philippine Daily Star.
   ``When a government cannot overcome a rebellion without
`outside' help, I hope that this does not make it a colony, a
satrap, or a banana republic all over again,'' said Soliven,
recalling the half-century when the Philippines was a U.S. colony.
   ``How the nation's so-called leaders could possibly justify ...
our complete dependence and subservience to a former colonial
master truly blows the mind,'' chimed in columnist Noel C. Cabrera
in The Manila Times.
   U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover Friday for loyalist forces.
The jets did not fire on the rebels but prevented them from
continuing air strikes targeting the presidential palace and
military camps.
   Mrs. Aquino had requested military assistance in a telephone
call to President Bush during the first hours of the coup, when the
survival of her government appeared in doubt.
   The air support has been widely viewed as the turning point.
   The jets took off from Clark Air Base, about 50 miles north of
Manila. It is one of six U.S. military bases in the Philippines
with leases expiring in 1991.
   The future of the strategic bases is one of the hotest political
topics in the Philippines, and the debate has intensified with the
U.S. intervention in the attempted coup.
   Base supporters have argued that the installations give the
economy a needed shot in the arm and provide strategic protection
from foreign aggression.
   Opponents have claimed the bases, although technically under
Philippine control, are U.S.-run and therefore an affront on
national sovereignty.
   Mrs. Aquino's use of Phantoms from Clark, however, has added a
new element to the debate _ the bases as ultimate guarantor of
democracy in the Philippines.
   A resolution drafted Wednesday by the opposition Nacionalista
Party of Vice President Salvador Laurel says the bases ``are not
designed to promote mutual security but to perpetrate U.S. hegemony
in the Philippines.''
   It calls for non-renewal of the bases treaties and abrogation of
the bilateral mutual security treaty.
   But House Speaker Ramon Mitra said the U.S. assistance ``was
just to show the enemy of the people that there is another force
which will support President Aquino at a time when our democracy is
endangered. It is a nice feeling to have, when you need assistance
it is there. What would have happened if it did not come?''
   Although Mrs. Aquino has not expressed a clear position on the
bases, she has been willing to negotiate new leases, which would be
subject to Senate approval.
   Talks that were expected to begin this month may now be delayed
until 1990 because of the coup attempt.
   A senior official at the U.S. Embassy, speaking on condition he
not be further identified, said there was ``nothing magic'' about a
December start to negotiations and said a timetable would depend on
the Philippine side.
   He said he did not believe U.S. involvement would make the talks
more difficult, claiming that a ``large number of people ... were
very happy the support came when it (did).''
   There has been no sign of widespread anti-American sentiment in
the wake of the coup attempt. This archipelago nation benefits from
much American aid and investment and has absorbed much of popular
U.S. culture.
   In fact, when Filipinos were asked to temporarily house
foreigners escaping the heavy fighting in the Makati financial
district over the weekend, several people specifically asked for
Americans to be their guests.
   Even rebels refused to move against U.S. citizens they held in
Makati hotels, saying ``these American tourists are not our enemy.''
   But a statement issued in the name of a rebel leader advised the
U.S. government to evacuate its nationals and urged Americans to
pressure Washington ``to refrain from pursuing any policy or action
which may trigger a new Philippine-American war.''

<TEXT>
   Hanko Dewitz raced up on his
bicycle for his four-hour watch at secret police headquarters. His
mission: prevent Communist officials from destroying evidence in a
widening weapons scandal.
   The excited young supporter of the opposition New Forum group
had to wait until classes were out Wednesday before he pedaled
through this Baltic port to take up watch.
   Across East Germany, there are similar strange scenes. Angry
citizens have this week surrounded and, in some cases, stormed
local headquarters of the once-dreaded secret police.
   ``We check all material coming in and going out of this
building. We are here to make sure the police don't burn the
papers. We control this building,'' said Dewitz, a 24-year-old
medical student.
   Supporters of New Forum, the largest opposition group in East
Germany, occupied the building Monday upon hearing reports that
Communist officials were involved in illegal weapons export from a
nearby factory.
   There were also reports of the burning of documents.
   The focus of anger is the IMES factory at Kavelstorf, a village
on a rolling plain about 10 miles south of Rostock. New Forum says
it discovered cases of weapons among piles of household goods that
the plant normally produces.
   The plant is now occupied by police, and a representative of New
Forum is present at all times.
   A hand-lettered sign on the fence says ``New Forum Kavelstorf,''
and an East German flag with a white dove stitched on calls for
demilitarization.
   The group charges that the weapons were exported for hard
currency. The head of the firm has been arrested and Alexander
Schalck-Golodkowski, the government official who oversaw the
operation, has turned himself to authorities in West Germany, where
he had fled.
   A secretary in the mayor's office of Kavelstorf had this comment
on the affair: ``Disgusting!''
   Said a local mechanic: ``Everybody from the top party boss to
the little local party leader was corrupt.''
   The case has been turned over to the state prosecutor's office,
which has put five lawyers on it. The people are being represented
by New Forum.
   The scandal is the talk of the town, and by afternoon the local
OstZee Zeitung newspaper is now sold out. Once a Communist party
mouthpiece, the daily now prints full reports of opposition
activities and even lists planned demonstrations.
   Throughout East Germany, the opposition has set itself a tall
order to make sure that 40 years of incriminating documents do not
vanish.
   In addition to its 24-hour guard inside the secret police
building, New Forum has taken over a garage that serviced cars
belonging to the police.
   The activists are allowing no information to be radioed out, and
they say they have halted the burning of documents likely to
incriminate secret police.

<HEAD>Witness: Defense Contractor Employees Swapped Classified Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The swapping of classified Pentagon
budget documents by employees of nine major defense contractors was
``endemic,'' according to a witness at the federal trial of a
former Boeing Co. employee.
   The informal network of document trading existed in the late
1970s and early 1980s, government witnesses said Wednesday. It was
the third day of the trial of Richard Lee Fowler, a former Boeing
worker accused of illegally obtaining secret Defense Department
documents.
   Fowler has pleaded innocent to 39 counts, including conspiracy,
illegal conveyance of classified documents and mail fraud. Boeing
earlier pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents and will
pay a $5.2 million fine.
   Among the companies implicated in the document trading network
besides Boeing were Honeywell, Bendix, IBM, RCA, Grumman, Raytheon,
Rockwell and Martin Marietta.
   ``I would describe it as endemic,'' Linda Coutre, a Bendix
employee from 1972 to 1984, said of the document swaps.
   Ms. Coutre said everyone seemed to have the so-called
``planning, programming and budget system'' documents and she
exchanged documents with Fowler and employees of other defense
companies.
   The documents were never entered in Bendix's classified document
log, Ms. Coutre said, adding that she kept the documents in a file
cabinet or a safe and when they became outdated she would shred
them or burn them in her fireplace.
   Ms. Coutre said she never asked Fowler or others where they got
the documents.
   ``It was an unspoken agreement that no one asked that
question,'' she said. ``We didn't want to get people in trouble.''
   Ms. Coutre, who was granted immunity from prosecution by U.S.
attorneys, said the documents gave defense contractors some
indication of how serious the Pentagon was about pursuing various
projects.
   ``They were used primarily to support business decisions,'' she
said. ``We had to look at the opportunities from the Department of
Defense and make decisions on whether to invest money. We wanted to
make sure the government was serious about the opportunities before
we went forward.''
   Philip Jackson, an RCA employee from 1979 to 1984, said he also
swapped documents, but the top source of supply was Fowler.
   Jackson said Fowler's supply of documents ``seemed to be
continuous and quick'' and on at least two occasions Fowler handed
him documents from the trunk of his car parked in the garage at
Boeing's Rosslyn, Va., office.
   ``It was my sense that every major contractor had them,''
Jackson said.
   Jackson, who was also granted immunity from prosecution, said he
``never asked anyone what their source was. It was just not done.
It was not the gentlemanly way to do things.''
   But Jackson said he had the ``distinct impression'' that Fowler
got the documents from the Pentagon and he thought Fowler was
encouraging others in the network to develop Pentagon sources.
   Max Franklin, who worked both for Martin Marietta and IBM, said
that he too swapped documents with Fowler and others.
   Franklin, who was called as a defense witness, said he didn't
feel that exchanging the classified documents was illegal and that
defense contractors had a legitimate right to know what was in the
documents.
   Franklin said Fowler was described by others as the ``best in
the business'' in terms of getting the documents, but denied that
he had heard Fowler described as the ``mother lode.''
   In earlier testimony Wednesday, a retired Honeywell employee
said he and other company employees were under pressure to get the
secret budget documents.
   Frank Lozito said when he was asked by his supervisor to get
classified Air Force budget documents he turned to Fowler, an old
friend, for help.
   Lozito, who also was granted immunity, said he got documents
from Fowler five or 10 times a year, from 1979 to early 1984.

   A judge who grew up in the same neighborhood
as the defendant sentenced him to life in prison without parole for
possessing 5{ ounces of crack.
   ``I don't feel any pity for him because he set the agenda for
himself,'' U.S. District Judge David W. Williams said Wednesday in
sentencing Richard Van Winrow.
   Winrow, 22, was sentenced under a 1988 federal narcotics
trafficking statute that provides for severe mandatory penalties
for people with multiple drug offenses.
   Winrow was arrested in December 1988 in a raid on his mother's
home. He was convicted in August of possession with intent to
distribute 5{ ounces of crack, the potent, highly addictive,
smokeable form of cocaine.
   He had three prior convictions for cocaine possession and was on
probation when he was arrested. Under the Anti-Drug Abuse
Amendments Act of 1988, Winrow faced a minimum of 20 years in
prison and a maximum of life without parole. Williams chose the
maximum.
   ``We have one or two things in common,'' the 79-year-old judge
told Winrow. ``We are the same race and we come from the same
neighborhood.''
   The judge, who is black, noted he grew up about a mile from
Winrow's mother's home in south-central Los Angeles.
   ``I know that neighborhood, and I know how it's changed,''
Williams continued. ``The man is making it one of the neighborhoods
you can't live in, can't walk down the streets on. My people are
the victims.''
   Winrow's attorney, David Chesnoff, argued against the sentence.
He contended the federal statute violates the Constitution by
representing cruel and unusual punishment, taking discretion away
from judges and failing to match the severity of the crime.
   But Williams said the sentence, though harsh, was constitutional.
   ``Congress has gone out to battle the drug war and this man is
one of the enemies,'' the judge said.

<HEAD>Debate Rages on Prospects for Global Warming</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite popular opinion that global warming
will disrupt Earth's climate, scientists are still debating whether
the ``greenhouse effect'' has started and how bad it will get.
   ``The scientific community is by no means unanimous,''
Massachusetts Institute of Technology meteorologist Dick Lindzen
said Wednesday.
   Because of uncertainty that automobile and industrial pollutants
are heating up Earth's climate, ``I would be loathe to tell Detroit
they can't build big cars any more or tell Exxon to cut oil
production,'' said climate researcher Tim Barnett, of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla.
   Debate over global warming took place at the American
Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
   The ``greenhouse effect'' theory says that carbon dioxide and
other gases emitted by burning industrial and automobile fuel is
accumulating in Earth's atmosphere, acting like greenhouse glass to
trap heat from sunlight.
   Computer simulations suggest that by the middle of the next
century, Earth's average temperature may rise 4 to 9 degrees
Fahrenheit, possibly altering storm patterns, triggering droughts
and crop failures and raising sea levels to flood low-lying coastal
areas.
   If humans keep burning fossil fuels at present rates, adding
more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, ``by the year 2050 we're
going to have tremendous climate changes far outside what man has
ever experienced,'' said James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard
Institute for Space Studies.
   Lindzen countered: ``It's equally easy to support scenarios
where nothing happens.''
   He argued that a warming of Earth's surface spurs creation of
more cumulus clouds and makes them rise higher, which in turn
blocks enough sunlight to counteract greenhouse heating.
   Barnett said the greenhouse effect's ``potential consequences
are scary as hell.'' But he and others question whether computer
forecasts of climatological doom are valid.
   That's because so far they have been unable to find evidence to
link greenhouse gases to the one-half-degree warming observed
during the past century.
   Analysis of warming since 1881 shows that most of that increase
in global temperature happened before 1919 _ before the more
recent, sharp rise in the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, said Thomas Karl, of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center in
Asheville, N.C.
   While global climate warmed overall since 1881, it actually
cooled during the period from 1921 to 1979 before warming again,
Karl said.
   ``In spite of all the well-publicized concern about global
warming, you must understand that there is still considerable
uncertainty among scientific experts about a number of critical
factors which determine global warming,'' NOAA administrator John
Knauss said in a statement.
   The researchers agreed they need to stop arguing and do better
research to learn if the greenhouse effect is under way and will be
as severe as Hansen and others believe.
   Hansen spurred controversy when he told a U.S. Senate committee
hearing during the hot, dry summer of 1988 that he was almost
certain greenhouse warming already had begun.
   Other scientists at Wednesday's news conference said that if
that's true, they can't detect such warming since it is so small
compared to temperature variations caused by changes in solar heat
output and other natural factors.
   Hansen said that to reduce the prospects for radical climate
change, there many things that can be done without great cost.
   Such steps include phasing out chlorofluorocarbon gases _ which
harm Earth's protective ozone shield and warm the atmosphere _
improving energy efficiency to reduce fuel burning, and recycling
newspapers to save trees that consume carbon dioxide, he said.

   Growing evidence shows a monstrous
earthquake could wallop the woefully unprepared Pacific Northwest,
followed by tidal waves that would swamp coastal areas of Oregon
and Washington, scientists say.
   ``The chances are very high that a great earthquake will occur,
yet seismic building codes are notoriously out of date,'' said
University of Oregon geophysicist Paul Vincent.
   Craig Weaver, a U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist in Seattle,
called the region's ability to prevent death and damage from
earthquakes ``abysmal.''
   ``We're not prepared in the Pacific Northwest,'' he said.
   While some scientists remain skeptical, evidence accumulated
during the last five years indicates six quakes with magnitudes of
8 to 9 rocked the region during the past 3,500 years, making
coastal areas suddenly drop so that tsunamis, or seismic tidal
waves, inundated the shoreline. The last such quake was about 300
years ago.
   More studies showing such quakes have occurred and are likely to
strike again were released Wednesday during the American
Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
   Residents of the Northwest ``should be ready for an earthquake
at any time,'' although no one knows how soon, Weaver said.
   One study found the Oregon coast near Tillamook has been rising
and tilting eastward much more quickly during the past 50 years
than it has on average in 80,000 to 100,000 years.
   That indicates that stress is building underground, and will be
released in a quake measuring 8 to 9 on the Richter scale any time
within the next 150 years, according to scientists from the
University of California, Berkeley.
   The study was conducted by Vincent and Ray Weldon at the
University of Oregon, and Mark Richards at Berkeley.
   Dozens of dead western cedar trees along Washington's southern
coast were studied by David Yamaguchi, a forester at the University
of Colorado at Boulder. Yamaguchi said that by dating the trees'
rings, he determined they all died suddenly about 300 years ago,
when coastal land suddenly dropped during a major quake and
tsunamis submerged the trees.
   Yamaguchi said the trees were found along a 60-mile coastal
stretch, suggesting the quake measured 8 on the Richter scale.
   Mary Reinhart of the University of Washington presented a study
showing 300-year-old peat buried by sand has been found along at
least a 120-mile stretch of the Oregon-Washington coast. She said
it indicates a 40-foot-high tsunami dumped sand on coastal
estuaries in a big quake three centuries ago.
   Richards said Oregon is severely unprepared for the ``great
seismic hazard.'' The lack of recent big quakes lulled Oregonians
into a false sense of security, and the state has made little
progress updating building codes to take large quakes into account,
he added.
   Weaver said Washington state is slightly better prepared because
building standards were improved after a magnitude-7.1 quake in
Olympia in 1949 and a magnitude-6.5 quake near Seattle in 1965. The
two quakes killed 17 people.
   Geological Survey geologist Bob Buckham found new evidence that
one and possibly two quakes measuring about 7 rocked Seattle at
least 1,200 years ago.
   He found that land on Bainbridge Island west of Seattle was
suddenly uplifted by as much as 23 feet at the time. A
magnitude-7.3 quake in Algeria several years ago raised land there
by about 16 feet.
   Two large plates of Earth's crust collide off the Pacific
Northwest. The Juan de Fuca plate, which is under the seafloor, is
diving eastward under the North American plate beneath Oregon and
Washington in a process is called subduction.
   Quakes can happen in subduction zones when one plate sticks to
the other until so much stress builds up they snap apart in a giant
temblor.
   That caused the 1985 Mexico earthquakes, which killed about
10,000 people, and the two largest quakes ever recorded: the 1960
Chile quake that killed about 5,000 people and measured 9.5, and
the 1964 Alaska quake that claimed 131 lives and measured 9.2.
   Lynn Sykes, of Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Geological
Observatory, said other scientists ``have too quickly jumped on the
big earthquake scenario'' for the Northwest.
   He believes the Juan de Fuca plate is warmer and softer than the
plates off Alaska, Mexico and Chile. In that case, the plate could
dive smoothly under North America without sticking and snapping.
   But Richards said if that were true, the Northwest would have
``the only major subduction zone which does not cause substantial
earthquakes.''

<HEAD>House Members Want Some Health Benefits Revived</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two House members are trying to save some of
the Medicare catastrophic health insurance benefits that Congress
recently voted to repeal.
   Reps. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., and Willis Gradison,
R-Ohio, on Wednesday asked fellow lawmakers to back legislation
that would provide limited Medicare coverage of mammography
screening, expanded home health services, respite care and hospice
care.
   The four benefits were lesser provisions included in the
year-old Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, which Congress last
month voted to repeal in response to senior citizens' complaints
that the program was too expensive.
   President Bush is expected to sign the repeal legislation.
   The catastrophic package was designed to protect 33 million
elderly and disabled people against financial ruin from prolonged
illnesses.

<HEAD>Move to Hold Hearing on Texas Bus Crash Rejected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board will
complete its investigation of Texas' worst school bus accident
without a public hearing that had been sought by the lead on-site
investigator.
   NTSB member Lee V. Dickinson said a hearing would call attention
to several national safety issues involved in the September
accident near Alton that killed 21 teen-agers, but the move failed
on a 2-2 vote.
   Dickinson said a hearing would spotlight such issues as
continued problems with deficient brakes in the trucking industry,
whether school buses have adequate escape hatches and whether
students are sufficiently drilled on emergency escape routes.
   Nineteen students aboard the bus drowned when it collided with a
soft-drink delivery truck, careened into a water-filled pit and
quickly submerged. Two others died later.

<HEAD>Former Allies Now Foes in Election for Leland's Congressional Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former allies on Mickey Leland's ``People's
Five'' slate of young, black legislative candidates have become
political foes in the race to succeed the congressman who died in a
plane crash.
   State Sen. Craig Washington and City Councilman Anthony Hall
face eachother in Saturday's non-partisan runoff election for
Leland's 18th Congressional District seat. Leland was killed Aug. 7
during a famine relief mission to Ethiopia.
   In the early 1970s, all three men worked for civil rights, fair
housing, health care for the poor, food for the hungry and other
social concerns. They were the only successful candidates from the
Democratic ``People's Five'' slate, who sought to represent Houston
in the state House.
   Now Washington and Hall have spent weeks trying to establish
their political differences and prove their interest in
representing a district said to be among the nation's poorest.
   ``My campaign is a movement,'' said Washington. ``It's an
opportunity for people to get involved in politics again.''
   An attorney and a former law school instructor, Washington, 48,
has been state senator since 1983 after serving 10 years in the
House.
   He captured 41 percent of the vote in the Nov. 7 election,
compared with 34 percent for Hall. The two topped a field of 11
candidates seeking to succeed Leland.
   The term expires in 1990.
   ``I won in the black community and the white community and the
Hispanic community,'' Washington said. ``And I intend to do exactly
the same thing on Dec. 9.''
   A poll published Monday by KPRC-TV showed the race is nearly
deadlocked. The KPRC poll said 41 percent of voters favor Hall,
while 38 percent were for Washington. Twenty-one percent said they
were undecided, and the poll had a 5 point margin of error.
   Hall, 45, has a more buttoned-down style. Also an attorney, he
gained early notice as a decorated Vietnam veteran who returned to
Houston questioning discriminatory practices in housing and
employment. More recently, he has worked to set up 50 ``Just Say
No'' anti-drug programs for 1,300 students.
   ``I have a vision that indeed we can do better than we do now at
solving the problems that we face as a community,'' said Hall, a
three-term legislator who has served as councilman since 1979.
   Hall, who had been a high school friend of Leland's, lost a
bitter battle to him for the congressional seat in 1978, when the
two fought to succeed Barbara Jordan.
   Hall had to give up his re-election bid for the council to run
for Congress. Mayor Kathy Whitmire has endorsed his bid for
Congress and helped him raise money.
   Washington and Hall agree many issues: both favor increased
funding to battle drug trafficking and abuse, and for health care
to the poor and elderly and military cutbacks in Central America.
   ``What differences there are largely is a matter of style,''
says Franklin Jones, a political scientist at Texas Southern
University. ``Washington comes off as the more grassroots kinds of
campaigner _ more of the people's candidate. While Hall has the
more polished image, as the sort of professional candidate. But
both of them are extremely professional and long-term political
people.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Intentional Injuries Common Among Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One in every 130 children require hospital care
each year for injuries resulting from fights, suicide attempts and
other intentional acts of violence, according to a study published
today.
   Intentional injuries are now recognized as a major cause of
death among children and teen-agers in the United States. The
latest research was intended to see how often violence results in
significant but non-fatal injuries.
   The study, based on Massachusetts data gathered a decade ago,
found that such harm is relatively common, especially among city
dwellers and poor people.
   It found that intentional injuries made up 3 percent of all
injuries to children and teen-agers. They led to 10 percent of all
hospitalizations and 16 percent of all injury-related deaths.
   Overall, 85 percent of the intentional injuries resulted from
assaults, such as fights, rape and child battering.
   The analysis was conducted by Dr. Bernard Guyer and colleagues
from the Harvard School of Public Health and Boston University
School of Medicine. It was conducted between 1979 and 1982 in 14
Massachusetts communities and published in the New England Journal
of Medicine.
   Among the findings:
   _One in 42 adolescent boys was treated annually for an
assault-related injury, usually resulting from a fight.
   _Boys were almost twice as likely as girls to seek care for
intentional injuries.
   _One exception was suicide attempts, which were nearly twice as
frequent among girls. One in every 303 adolescent girls needed
hospital care for a self-inflicted injury each year.
   _Nearly one-quarter of the rapes occured in girls under age 10.
   _Assault-related injuries were three times as common in cities
as in suburbs.

<HEAD>Success of Right Prompts New Immigration Task Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stung by electoral successes of the extreme right
and fierce debate over rights for Moslems, the government has
appointed a trouble-shooter to formulate new policy for integrating
immigrants into French society.
   Premier Michel Rocard on Wednesday named Hubert Prevot as
permanent secretary of a government committee that will grapple
with what has become the leading issue in domestic politics.
   ``The economic situation of France no longer permits us to be a
land of immigration,'' government spokesman Louis Le Pensec said
after the appointment was announced at the weekly Cabinet meeting.
   ``It's now a question of integrating foreigners who have come to
make their homes here and wish to live here permanently,'' Le
Pensec said.
   Prevot, 61, will head a task force of 13 ministers to grapple
with the issues of integrating Moslems into the secular school
system, the definition of a political refugee, illegal workers and
immigrant housing.
   The panel will submit conclusions to the government sometime
after Jan. 31.
   The creation of the task force represents a victory for the
extreme-right National Front headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has
fulfilled a long-held goal of putting immigration high on the
government's agenda.
   It comes the same day Marie-France Stirbois took the party's
first seat in the National Assembly since electoral reforms in
1988. Mrs. Stirbois won the seat for suburban Dreux in a runoff
election Sunday.
   Immigration exploded into a front-page issue in October after
three girls with North African origins insisted on wearing Islamic
scarves to their junior high school.
   French law dating to the turn of the century separates church
and state. All forms of proselytizing and wearing of religious
symbols are prohibited in the secular school system.
   Though two of the girls removed their scarves and returned to
class on Saturday, they ignited fresh debate over whether some
immigrants can be absorbed into French culture.
   Le Pen has pushed the issue for years, arguing that social
payments to immigrants cut into benefits for native French
citizens. His party fares well in areas like Dreux that have a high
population of non-European immigrants.
   In an interview published in Wednesday's edition of the
conservative newspaper Le Figaro, Le Pen urged the government to
expel all foreigners who arrived in France after 1974.
   Le Pen says a law passed that year that restricted immigration
to political asylum or reuniting families is widely flouted.
   ``Wisdom would dictate reducing the number of foreigners in
France and reversing the flood,'' Le Pen was quoted as saying. ``In
10 years there will be 100 million people living in North Africa.
What is their hope? To come to France.''
   He continued: ``Is that the solution? Of course not. The
solution is the development of the underdeveloped countries.'' The
National Front has won 9 to 14.5 percent of the vote nationwide
vote in recent elections.
   The debate over immigration almost never mentions immigrants
from North America or Europe, but focuses instead on Arab North
Africa and black West Africa, where many countries are former
French colonies or protectorates.
   A survey of 926 people conducted by the polling service BVA
showed 68 percent of the French think the level of tolerance has
been reached for immigration, and 50 percent oppose the
construction of new mosques.
   The last national census, taken in 1982, showed 3.6 million
immigrants living in France. The Ministry of the Interior puts the
current figure at 4.5 million, or about 8 percent of a total
population of 55 million.
   The ministry's last breakdown, in 1985, showed Portuguese as the
most numerous immigrant population at 846,488, followed by
Algerians at 725,049, Moroccans at 558,799, Italians at 378,339,
Spaniards at 353,232, Tunisians at 225,730 and Turks at 160,140.

<TEXT>
   Actor John Payne, Kris Kringle's lawyer
who proved that Santa Claus exists in the 1947 Christmas film
classic ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' has died. He was 77.
   Payne, a leading man in Hollywood musicals and dramas during the
1940s and 1950s, died his home here Wednesday, said Robert Palmer,
a longtime friend and former publicist. He suffered from heart
problems.
   Payne's third wife, actress Alexandra ``Sandy'' Crowell Curtis,
and his three children from previous marriages were with him when
he died, Palmer said.
   ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' which won three Oscars and has
become a Christmas TV tradition, also starred Maureen O'Hara,
Edmund Gwenn and an 8-year-old Natalie Wood as a girl who didn't
believe in Santa Claus.
   Payne's character is called upon to defend Kringle, the
department store Santa who faces court proceedings because of his
insistence he is really Santa Claus.
   The lawyer wins by getting postal officials to deliver to
Kringle in court thousands of children's letters for Santa Claus.
The judge decides not to refute a government agency and frees the
kindly old man in time to make his Christmas Eve rounds.
   Payne took personal credit for getting the movie.
   He spotted the Valentine Davies story in a magazine and overcame
objections from 20th Century Fox studios to making a simple
Christmas story in an era of extravagant productions.
   It was broadcast on local TV station Tuesday.
   ``He was very proud of that film,'' said Palmer. ``In fact, the
night before he died _ he was unconscious in bed _ a television in
the corner was playing that film. It was strange looking at him in
bed like that.''
   Payne was born in Roanoke, Va., the son of a gentleman farmer
who lost much of his wealth in the stock market crash of 1929. His
mother was an opera singer.
   Payne studied drama and voice at Juilliard and Columbia
University, supporting himself with roles in low-budget Shubert
shows.
   He once had his own radio program on WNEW in New York.
   Payne first made his mark in film as a leading man in several
20th Century Fox musicals in the 1940s, often starring opposite
Alice Faye or Betty Grable.
   His films include ``Tin Pan Alley,'' ``Sun Valley Serenade,''
``Hello Frisco Hello,'' ``Springtime in the Rockies,'' ``The Dolly
Sisters,'' ``The Razor's Edge'' and ``Sentimental Journey.''
   In the 1950s, Payne switched to Westerns and action pictures,
including ``Passage West,'' ``Raiders of the Seven Seas,'' and
``Santa Fe Passage.''
   Payne retired in the 1960s, but went back to the stage with Miss
Faye in the 1973 national revival of ``Good News.''
   Payne said of his acting career in 1974: ``I could never quite
take it seriously.''
   ``It was all kind of fun.... It was a remunerative profession. I
certainly couldn't have earned that much money any other way that I
can think of,'' he said.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Saturday at St. Aidan's
Episcopal Church in Malibu.

<HEAD>New York Survey: Almost All Supermarket Scanners Overcharge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customers of supermarkets with automatic
checkout scanners were overcharged in 32 of the 33 stores checked
by New York state inspectors this year, officials said.
   The 32 stores, which include all of the major supermarket
chains, were fined a total of $5,015 for the violations, said
Joseph Ferrara, assistant director of food inspection services for
the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.
   More than 5 percent of the items in a typical store are
mispriced in favor of the supermarket, Ferrara said.
   Nonetheless, state officials were unable to say Wednesday
whether the customers at the 32 stores ended up net winners or
losers because of the scanners. Industry officials noted that the
scanners might also be undercharging customers on some of the many
items checked in each supermarket.
   ``I think they (consumers) have to pay careful attention to the
prices marked as opposed to the prices on the scanners,'' Ferrara
said. ``It's not uncommon for them to be overcharged for items in
stores that use scanners. I guess `buyer beware' would probably be
good advice.''
   Michael Rosen, director of government relations for the state
Food Merchants Association, said mistakes are made that both
benefit and hurt consumers.
   So while 32 of the 33 stores were found to be overcharging on
some items, they may have been undercharging on many others, said
the lobbyist.
   ``People aren't going to knowingly cheat their customers because
they'll lose them,'' Rosen said. ``You might fool someone once or
twice, but if you lose that person and they never come back, you're
not going to be in business for very long.''
   Ferrara said inspectors, posing as customers, would go into
stores and buy about 150 items or more, comparing prices on the
product with the receipt after checking out. Stores where
discrepancies were found that hurt the consumers were fined.
   Many of the mistakes came in items that were advertised as on
sale, but the sale price hadn't been entered into the computer
scanner, he said.

   Rebel troops chanting ``no surrender,
the fight goes on'' left the city's financial district and returned
to their barracks today, ending for the moment their bid to topple
President Corazon Aquino.
   But in Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila, about 400 rebels were
not budging from Mactan Air Base, refusing to surrender unless new
elections are called to replace Mrs. Aquino, whose term expires in
June 1992.
   Civic and religious leaders negotiated with holdouts at Mactan,
the last known stronghold of mutineers who launched the coup
attempt on Friday.
   ``This is unconditional surrender,'' said Brig. Gen. Arturo
Enrile, head of the Philippine Military Academy who led
negotiations throughout the night with rebel leaders in the
financial district. ``The problem is already finished.''
   But rebels who marched the 1\ miles back to Fort Bonifacio were
singing and chanting ``No surrender, the fight goes on!'' Troops at
the army base unfurled a white sheet at the gate saying, ``Welcome
Home.''
   As the mutineers marched past the exclusive Forbes Park
neighborhood, where U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt lives, some
residents stood on the street and cheered.
   ``We have won some victories,'' said rebel Capt. Danilo Lim.
``We have made a very strong statement.''
   At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 others
wounded in the coup attempt. It was the bloodiest of the six
attempts to overthrow Mrs. Aquino, who took power in the February
1986 civilian-military uprising that toppled the late President
Ferdinand E. Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino, who faced the gravest crisis of her administration,
said she was relieved the siege was over.
   ``We must now all join hands and consolidate our resources to
rebuild what has been destroyed,'' she said in a written statement.
   At Mactan Air Base, rebel leader Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador
threatened to blow up all military aircraft unless his demands were
met.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa begged Commendador
in a television statement to spare the aircraft, saying they were
needed for the fight against Communist insurgents.
   But as representatives of the two sides watched the telecast in
Cebu, a rebel officer turned off the set before de Villa appeared.
   Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, Roman Catholic archbishop of Manila and
the country's leading cleric, called on todayu his followers to
join a mass rally Friday in support of democracy.
   ``The future of the nation is in your hands,'' Sin said. In
1986, hundreds of thousands joined Sin's call to turn out in the
streets to support soldiers who had mutinied against Marcos.
   That triggered the ``people power revolution'' Mrs. Aquino rode
to power. But much of her public support has now eroded amid
charges of incompetence and corruption.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino declared a national state of emergency
to deal with the crisis. Her staff was expected to send Congress a
list of new powers requested under the emergency decree.
   Rebels abandoned Makati a day after about 1,800 foreigners,
among them roughly 250 Americans, were evacuated from rebel-held
luxury hotels there.
   As they left the skyscrapers and hotels, seized on Saturday, the
mutineers sang the theme song of their Scout Ranger regiment.
Rifles, bazookas, machine guns and bandoleers of ammunition were
slung over their shoulders.
   ``We will not surrender, even if it takes forever,'' said Cpl.
Roy Bantung. ``The government must change.''
   Rebels have accused Mrs. Aquino of failing to stamp out
corruption, reorganize the armed forces and deliver on promises of
social justice.
   The rebels seized hotels and buildings in Makati on Saturday.
The military said about 300 rebels surrendered today, but the
number appeared to be more than 500.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos estimated that about 3,000 rebels
joined the mutiny at its high-point.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Aquino ruled out negotiations with the rebels
and warned them ``surrender or die.'' But in the end she relented
and stepped aside to allow loyal military commanders to resolve the
crisis peacefully.
   Most rebel officers in past coup attempts have simply been
confined to barracks, and many enlisted men were sent back into the
ranks.
   Enrile said the rebels' political demands, which included the
resignation of Mrs. Aquino, ``were non-negotiable.'' The rebels
were believed to favor a civilian-military junta that would pave
the way for new elections.
   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalist
forces, preventing the insurgents from continuing air strikes from
Villamor Air Base, which the rebels seized in the coup's first
hours.
   The U.S. warplanes did not fire on the rebels.
   Public confidence has been shaken far more than by the other
coup attempts.
   Jose Fernandez, governor of the Central Bank, said Wednesday
that $91 million had been withdrawn in runs on Manila banks. Many
parts of the archipelago had cash shortages because domestic air
service had been suspended.

<HEAD>Casino Commission Imposes $250,000 Fine On Caesars In Discrimination
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State gaming regulators have fined a
casino $250,000 for removing black and women employees from a table
at the request of a big-stakes player.
   The penalty approved unanimously by the Casino Control
Commission on Wednesday stopped short of the closure suggested by
the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, which did not propose any
length to a shutdown.
   However, it exceeded an administrative law judge's
recommendation that the casino be fined $15,600, the amount lost by
Robert LiButti, the player in question.
   The fine was the second largest in New Jersey's 11-year casino
history. The largest was a $257,000 penalty issued against Caesars
for allowing a patron to play from inside the pit, among other
charges.
   In 1985, the gaming hall became the only casino to be closed for
a day when it allowed a patron to lose more than $7 million without
checking his source of credit.
   ``A suspension of the operation certificate is not warranted in
this instance,'' said commission Chairman Walter N. Read. ``But the
evidence also establishes sufficiently aggravating circumstances to
warrant nothing less than maximum penalties.''
   Read cited ``the inherently abhorrent nature of race- and
sex-based discrimination'' and the gaming hall's catering to high
rollers. The commission decision also requires Caesars to conduct a
training program emphasizing how to deal with high-rollers.
   LiButti, a 57-year-old thoroughbred horse consultant from Saddle
River, has said through his attorney that he never asked for the
removal of dealers.
   He is suing Caesars and the Division of Gaming Enforcement for
making the allegations.
   The gaming division's discrimination complaint against Caesars
charges that on two occasions in May 1988, Caesars removed black
and women craps workers to accommodate LiButti.
   Although the ruling was unanimous, W. David Waters, the lone
black member of the five-person commission, questioned its impact
on Caesars.
   ``It is obvious that organizational or corporate penalties
represent nothing more than the cost of doing business,'' Waters
said. ``If violations of this sort occur in the future, I think
this commission must consider assessing penalties against top
management in order to hold them personally accountable.''
   Caesars attorney Gregory Parliman said he was ``pleased that the
commission decided not to accept the recommendation to suspend the
license.''
   The casino collects about $851,000 a day from patrons before
expenses.
   Joel Respes, the black floorperson who was replaced, also said
he was satisfied by the ruling.
   ``I'm happier with this decision than a $15,000 fine,'' Respes
said.
   Respes, 36, said he still works for Caesars, but added it has
not been easy.
   ``I was vey humiliated,'' he said. ``My pride was hurt. I
couldn't believe the company would do such a thing.''

<HEAD>Smuggler Says He Gave $300,000 Gift to Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government witness in a drug smuggling
trial claimed he once gave Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega a
$300,000 present, and implicated the manager of rock star Bon Jovi.
   Steven Michael Kalish, 37, faced cross-examination today at the
U.S. District Court trial of 23 men accused of an enormous
smuggling conspiracy.
   In testimony Tuesday, Kalish said the Panamanian government
helped him get in and out of Panama, once warning him that the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency was watching his jet so he could arrange
for another.
   Kalish said he met Noriega in the fall 1983 through Cesar
Rodriguez and Enrique Pretel, the Panamanian strongman's partners
in the firm of Servicios Touristicos.
   Kalish, the 70th witness to testify in a trial which began in
late October, said he told Rodriguez and Pretel that he expected to
have $100 million and needed adequate banking protection for the
money.
   Soon afterward, he met Noriega. The day after that, he said, he
was taken to Noriega's home and gave the general a $300,000 gift.
   ``I am rather impressed that I am in this man's house,'' said
Kalish, who often spoke of the past in the present tense.
   He said Noriega agreed to help with banking channels in Panama,
and Noriega, Rodriguez and Pretel divided a 5 percent commission on
$2.5 million sent to deposit in Panama's Bank of Commerce Credit
International.
   Kalish also testified Tuesday that Harold ``Doc'' McGhee,
manager of the rock groups Bon Jovi, Skid Row and the Scorpions,
was the link between the smugglers and a Colombian drug supplier.
   At a meeting in Miami, Kalish testified, McGhee was told to ask
one of his associates _ Paul Vargas of Baranquilla, Colombia _ to
supply a boat loaded with 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of marijuana for
shipment to North Carolina in November 1982.
   The Colombian Navy seized the boat and towed it to Cartegena,
Colombia, he said. But, Kalish testified, a $100,000 bribe from
Vargas _ paid with the assurance that McGhee would repay Vargas in
Miami _ persuaded the Colombian crew to let the drug boat free and
help load it.
   McGhee, who got a suspended sentence after pleading guilty to
marijuana importation charges in U.S. District Court in North
Carolina, faces more charges in Lafayette, where he is among about
two dozen defendants to be tried later.
   Kalish described their marijuana enterprise as a
multimillion-dollar business with so much cash that banks couldn't
handle it. At one point, he said, the organization had ``$40
million and no place to put it.''
   Organization members are accused of smuggling about 48,000
pounds of marijuana into North Carolina in 1982, nearly 300,000
pounds into Louisiana in 1983 and plotting to bring one million
pounds into Missouri in 1984.
   The 1984 operation never materialized, however, because Kalish
was arrested for racketeering. He subsequently pleaded guilty to
continual criminal enterprise and was sentenced to 14 years in
prison.
   The prison term later was reduced to 10 years after Kalish began
cooperating with federal authorities.
   In testimony about another defendant, Michael Lyons, Kalish
testified that he visited an Ohio farm soon after the delivery of
280,000 pounds of marijuana to a shipyard near Abbeville, La. He
said some of the marijuana had been taken to the farm for
distribution.
   A problem developed, he said, when it was discovered the people
who owned the farm were selling their own marijuana crop.
   ``One of the kids at the farm is selling bags of marijuana to
the kids in town,'' Kalish said. ``We have 45,000 pounds of
marijuana in this barn and here's this kid selling little Baggies
of marijuana and causing a security problem.''

   The last day of class before final exams. A
bustling university building filled with holiday decorations and
serious students chasing those elusive engineering degrees.
   Abruptly, a man enters the modern, six-story school structure,
ammunition belts criss-crossing his chest, a semi-automatic assault
rifle in his hands.
   Shots, screams echo through the halls. For a second, Jean-Robert
Cadieux thinks it is only a pre-exam prank.
   ``One of my friends said, `If it's a gag, it's a good one.
There's a bloody corpse by the photocopy machine,''' said the
23-year-old student.
   By the time the unidentified gunman was through stalking the
classrooms and corridors Wednesday of the engineering school at the
University of Montreal, 14 women were dead, nine women and four men
were wounded.
   The gunman, a brown-haired, blue-eyed man clad in blue jeans,
work boots and a green-and-black sweater, killed himself on the
third floor of the building.
   Frantic parents rushed to the school as pandemonium erupted.
Stunned students walked trance-like on the snow-covered campus of
the sprawling university that rests on a hill overlooking the city.
   ``I saw death close up and I shook,'' said Vanthona Ouy, 22, one
of scores of horrified students who streamed out of the building
after the carnage. ``It's our friends who have been killed.''
   ``It was just like Rambo,'' said student Robert Leclerc. ``He
had at least two ammunition belts across his chest.''
   Roger Tiffault, 23, a student, said the gunman walked into a
third-floor classroom and said, ``Everybody out!'' When no one
left, the gunman began shooting. Thiffault said a friend, who was
standing close by, was shot, as was another woman crouched between
desks.
   Asked why he hadn't been killed, Thiffault kept repeating, ``I
don't know.''
   The gunman entered a cafeteria first, killing three women, then
moved up to a second-floor classroom, where he ordered the men out
and fired on a group of frightened young women, killing six.
   ``He came in quietly,'' said student Eric Chavarie, who was
among the men ordered out of that classroom. ``And he told us to
stop what we were doing. Everyone thought it was a joke.
   ``He was smiling at us. He was very calm.''
   No one moved, Chavarie said.
   ``Then he fired a shot, right by my ear.''
   Pierre Robert, 25, who was also in the classroom, said ``I
thought it was a blank. I didn't see anything on the wall. But it
made a very loud noise.
   ``When he came in he was really calm but after the first shot
his voice became nervous.''
   Distraught, horrified parents frantically sought information
about their children. The university turned into a temporary
morgue. School officials urged students to let their parents know
they were safe.
   Students and professors, their voices trembling from fear and
shock, stood by the building in the cold Montreal evening.
   One of the first police officers on the scene learned first-hand
that his daughter was among the victims, according to a university
spokesman.
   Pierre Leclair, the police's head of public relations, found his
daughter, Maryse, dead on the floor, university spokesman Richard
Doin said.
   ``She was a really nice girl, very clever. She was a brilliant
student,'' Doin said.
   Some parents went to an auditorium at the school waiting to
learn if their children were among the dead. Some were in tears,
others waited with their heads in their hands.
   As many as 200 police officers were on the scene, including a
heavily armed SWAT team that arrived in the first, most confused
moments.
   The university is the largest in Quebec, Canada's majority
French-speaking province, with some 50,000 students in 13 faculties
and about 60 departments.

   Congressional investigators are turning up
evidence of possibly widespread security problems at the Energy
Department's nuclear weapons plants, which already are under the
gun for extensive safety and environmental flaws.
   Little has been documented of security lapses, mainly because
details about protection of plutonium and other nuclear materials
are classified. As a result of congressional inquiries, however,
once-secret information is trickling out.
   Some members of Congress and private experts say the emerging
evidence points to an unnerving vulnerability to diversion of
bomb-grade plutonium to terrorists.
   ``The questions of diversion and the pathways of diversion are
extremely numerous,'' said Milton Hoenig, scientific director of
the Nuclear Control Institute, a private group that advocates
measures to control the spread of nuclear weapons.
   Despite the government's devotion to secrecy in matters of
nuclear weapon production, it appears some federal nuclear
facilities have run the risk in recent years of allowing the theft
of enough plutonium to build a nuclear bomb.
   Government documents also suggest that some Energy Department
officials have played down protection problems. Other officials
complain that budget constraints have prevented the department from
filling security posts with adequately trained people.
   Among security slips disclosed this week by a House
investigations subcommittee:
   _Argonne National Laboratory-West, near Idaho Falls, Idaho,
violated rules last year on controlling access to portable
plutonium at a nuclear reactor site at the lab.
   Details of the incident are classified, but a senior Energy
Department official told a closed hearing of the House Energy
investigations subcommittee that the violation ``revealed a
deficiency and vulnerability'' to diversion of bomb materials to
terrorists.
   Portions of the hearing transcript were declassified earlier
this week.
   The official, Hilary J. Rauch, manager of the regional Energy
Department office that manages the Idaho facility, did not dispute
a suggestion by Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., that the incident
meant ``people could be carting plutonium out of the place.'' Rauch
stressed that the problem has since been corrected.
   _Quantities of plutonium large enough to make a nuclear bomb
were left unattended in rooms without alarms at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California last spring.
   A previously secret inspection report on Livermore also said
large quantities of plutonium ``were often left, between process
steps, with only one person or unattended'' during normal business
hours. Department officials acknowledged to the House subcommittee
that this was a serious lapse of security.
   _A senior department official, Brig. Gen. Paul F. Kavanaugh,
expressed concern in an internal memorandum last April at the
frequency of ``marginal and unsatisfactory ratings'' of nuclear
material security by federal inspectors of weapons plants.
   ``If, within the DOE, we cannot articulate and enforce effective
security practices at our most sensitive facilities, we will
deserve the comments of our most vocal critics,'' wrote Kavanaugh,
who left the department shortly after sending his memo.
   Kavanaugh also drafted a tough-worded message that he suggested
be sent to managers of key weapons plants requiring immediate
action to improve nuclear materials security. A few weeks later, a
brief version of his proposed message was sent offering thanks for
previous efforts but making scant mention of the problems.
   The subcommittee is investigating why the draft Kavanaugh
message was watered down by his superiors.
   Security questions also have arisen at the Oak Ridge weapons
complex in Tennessee. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., expressed alarm
that responsibility for granting security clearances was taken away
from Oak Ridge's security officials and given to the personnel
office.
   Also, a laboratory at Oak Ridge was unsure for more than a year,
starting in August 1988, whether a substantial amount of tritium _
a gas used to make nuclear warheads _ had been stolen from a
loading facility. The department said last week that it was
confident that none had been lost, but some members of Congress say
doubts remain about Oak Ridge's ability to protect tritium supplies.

<HEAD>President Cuts Mandatory Military Service Period In Half</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAVID CRARY</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk
announced a major defense cutback today, including a reduction from
two years to one year of the mandatory period of initial military
service for white men.
   He said certain military units would be eliminated and
facilities closed, with details to be disclosed next year.
   The announcement came two weeks after South Africa completed the
withdrawal of its troops from Namibia, where since 1966 they had
fought a bush war against pro-independence guerrillas.
   A year ago, South Africa signed a treaty that cleared the way
for Namibia's independence and also halted South African
involvement in the civil war in Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.
   These diplomatic developments have prompted speculation that a
major cut in military spending is imminent.
   De Klerk, opening a new headquarters for the state arms
manufacturing corporation, indicated that conscripts already in the
military would have their terms of service shortened.
   He said details about this would be disclosed Friday.
   The president said it was possible that career military
personnel and employees of Armscor, the weapons company, might lose
their jobs as part of the cutback. He said efforts would be made to
find new jobs for these people.
   It was the second time in 10 days that the president had
announced steps which reduce the scope of military operations and
influence. On Nov. 28, he scrapped a nationwide security network
which critics had denounced as an unaccountable shadow government.
   De Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha, had been criticized for
giving the security forces too large a role in policy-making. Botha
quit in August after losing a power struggle with de Klerk.
   Under the current conscription system, all able-bodied white
males in South African are required to serve two years of initial
military duty and then are eligible for call-up camps that could
amount to two more years of service spread out over 20 or more
years. Military service for blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race
is voluntary.
   In September, 780 white men vowed not to perform military
service, the largest defiance ever of conscription laws.
   Draft resisters face prison terms of up to six years, or 1{
times the amount of unfulfilled service. Three men currently are
serving six-year terms _ the youngest, 19-year-old Charles Bester,
completed a full year of his sentence on Tuesday.
   The government does not release information on the manpower of
the armed forces. However, at any given time in recent years, there
have been as estimated 68,000 conscripts on active duty and about
325,000 men in the reserves out of the roughly 2.4 million white
males of all ages in South Africa.

   Former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
said in videotaped testimony that his government collected
information on dissident activities in America.
   Marcos, who died in Hawaii Sept. 28, said in a video deposition
he became fearful of anti-Marcos protests in the United States by
1984, when ``massive, black propaganda'' was mounted against his
regime.
   Asked whether four Philippine agencies, including the military
and the Presidential Security Command, would have been involved in
collecting intelligence in the United States, Marcos replied:
``Among other things, most probably, yes.''
   Shown in U.S. District Court on Wednesday, the videotape was
made in Hawaii in July 1986, five months after Marcos was
overthrown in a popular revolt.
   The late Marcos, his widow, Imelda, and others are being sued
for $30 million by the families of Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes,
union reformers and anti-Marcos activists who were fatally shot in
June 1981 in the Seattle offices of the Alaska Cannery Workers
Union.
   The suit claims Marcos' government ordered the killings based on
an intelligence network in the United States that monitored
anti-Marcos activists, including Domingo and Viernes.
   Local prosecutors contended the killings involved an internal
union dispute. Three men were convicted of the murders in a 1981
criminal trial.
   Philippine intelligence in the United States would have been the
same as any other country's, Marcos said in the video.
   ``Every embassy, including the American embassy ... have reports
of this nature of those who are against the government in either a
benign way or a vicious way,'' he said. ``I never heard of any
serious effort of infiltrating any anti-Marcos organizations in the
United States.''
   Shortly before their deaths, Viernes had carried money to the
Philippines and met with anti-Marcos labor union officials there,
and he and Domingo supported a resolution at a labor convention in
Hawaii calling for an investigation of labor conditions in the
Philippines.
   But Marcos said he wasn't very concerned about opponents in the
United States until years after the killings.
   ``This fear probably reached ... what you would call an
attention level about '84, not before that, because of the massive,
black propaganda directed at me personally,'' Marcos said.
   He said he doubted a U.S. Senate committee report of the late
1970s that said Philippine agents had operated in the United States
since 1973, keeping track of Marcos opponents.
   ``That's a surprise to me,'' Marcos said.
   Among the documents taken out of the Philippines after Marcos'
overthrow was one that plaintiffs claim shows a ``slush fund''
account in San Francisco that was used to funnel money to the
United States for intelligence work.
   Plaintiffs claim one $15,000 entry on that account was used to
pay for the murders of Domingo and Viernes.
   Marcos was not asked about that document in the video shown
Wednesday. But he said the Philippines intelligence apparatus
contained ``funds that are considered held at the discretion of
some of the officers.''

   New Prime Minister V.P. Singh visited
Sikhism's holiest shrine today and told an estimated 20,000 Sikhs
to help him stop the sectarian violence that has cost thousands of
lives.
   ``Too much bloodshed has taken place in Punjab,'' Singh told the
Sikhs gathered inside the sacred Golden Temple.
   Singh's visit to Punjab was the first by a prime minister since
Indira Gandhi traveled to Amritsar in June 1984, when she ordered a
bloody crackdown on Sikh extremists.
   Four months later, she was assassinated by two of her Sikh
guards.
   Singh's visit is part of his new government's initiative to
solve the Sikh separatist campaign.
   More than 7,500 people have died in the 8-year-old campaign for
the homeland that Sikh extremists propose to carve out of Punjab, a
rich farming state bordering Pakistan.
   Singh, a Hindu, traveled in an open jeep. ``Your love to me is
my security,'' he told the Sikhs who lined up the 2-mile route and
cheered him. He gave autographs to Sikh children and shook hands.
   ``My government will move fast to bring peace and prosperity in
Punjab,'' Singh, 58, told the Sikhs gathered in the 14th century
Golden Temple.
   ``I have not come here for any political or governmental
purposes,'' Singh said. ``I have come to perform prayer in the holy
shrine so that peace and normalcy can be restored in the state once
again.''
   The shrine was the scene of a fierce battle when it was attacked
by Indian troops to flush out Sikh militants entrenched inside.
More than 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, were killed in the 1984 army
operation that precipitated the revenge slaying of Mrs. Gandhi.
   Sikhs, whose religion is rooted in both Islam and Hinduism,
comprise just 2 percent of India's 880 million people but have a
slight majority in Punjab. Sikh militants claim the government in
the predominantly Hindu nation discriminates against them socially
and politically.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of the population.
   Sikh took office last month after elections that ended the
tenure of Rajiv Gandhi, Mrs. Gandhi's son and immediate successor.
   The new government issued formal orders Dec. 2 to free top Sikh
leaders from jails, including a new member of Parliament who was
accused of plotting the 1984 assassination of Mrs. Gandhi.
   Simranjit Singh Mann, a former police officer accused of
conspiracy, was released from jail after the government withdrew
cases against him. Mann was elected to the lower house of
Parliament from Punjab by an overwhelming majority in last month's
national elections.
   Other leaders released were Gurcharan Singh Tohra, chief of the
Sikh temple management committee, and Prakash Singh Badal, a former
chief minister of Punjab.
   Mann, 44, who has been jailed for the past five years on
sedition charges, was charged with conspiracy when the
assassination case was re-opened in April.

   France has cut off aid to the
Comorro Republic until a French mercenary who led a successful coup
that claimed the president's life leaves the Indian Ocean
archipelago.
   In the capital today, soldiers used tear gas and clubs to
disperse about 1,000 high school students who marched through the
streets to demand that he and the other mercenaries involved in the
Nov. 26 takeover leave.
   The students, carrying placards reading ``mercenaries out'' and
``assassins, assassins,'' gathered in front of the French Embassy.
   They marched to the beachfront, where they were confronted by
dozens of members of the Comoran presidential guard, founded by
French mercenary Bob Denard and led by about 30 French and Belgian
soldiers of fortune.
   The guardsmen were supported by vehicles equipped with heavy
machine-guns. Many students threw themselves into the water when
the troops arrived. Others fled. Most later regrouped before the
Ministry of the Interior in the city center, where the guardsmen
launched tear-gas grenades and charged with clubs.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   Several photographers and journalists covering the march had
their film and notebooks seized.
   The demonstration came as France cut off its $25 million in
annual aid to the Comoro Republic over the coup.
   French government sources in Paris said Wednesday that the aid
will not be renewed until Denard leaves the islands.
   Various diplomatic sources have said President Ahmed Abdallah
Abderrahmane died in an attack carried out or directed by Denard,
commander of the 500-man guard that diplomats say now controls the
island. The guard has reportedly disarmed the 500-man regular army.
   Denard, who ousted and later returned Abdallah to the presidency
in coups during the 1970s, has denied involvement in the
assassination.
   Students jeered the 60-year-old Frenchman, a convert to Islam
married to a Comoro woman, on Tuesday with taunts of ``assassin''
after he left a mosque after saying prayers.
   France and South Africa are the main sources of foreign
investment in the archipelago, located midway between Mozambique
and Madagascar.
   South Africa demanded an end to the mercenary presence Monday,
and both countries are reported to be trying to make a deal with
Denard and his men to leave. Denard said Tuesday he has not been
approached by French officials with such an offer.

<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning composer Sammy Fain, whose
classic love ballads included ``Love is a Many Splendored Thing''
and ``I'll be Seeing You,'' has died of a heart attack. He was 87.
   Fain, who was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won two, died
Wednesday at the UCLA Medical Center, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of America's most memorable
pop hits.
   Many Fain titles bring instant recognition: ``Secret Love,''
``Let A Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up
That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night'' among them.
   `` `I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
ASCAP President Morton Gould said of the World War II song. ``It's
hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He was such a
sweet person, such a gentle person.''
   Sammy Cahn, a decades-long colleague and collaborator, said his
friend leaves ``not just a few but a staggering medley of hits,
songs that are readily identifiable to everyone.''
   He added: ``You know, old songwriters never really die because
their songs keep them alive forever.''
   Fain's collaborators included lyricists Cahn, Irving Kahal, Bob
Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis Webster, Mitchell
Parish, E.Y. Harburg, and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful
standard melodies,'' said Parish in a telephone interview from New
York.
   The two men wrote ``You're So Indifferent'' for Lena Horne and
another tune, ``In a Little French Cafe.''
   ``When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he
didn't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. ``We wrote
songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and
dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets.
   ``Workmen, whatever they were doing, would be singing strains of
our songs ... That explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain won Oscars for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love Is
a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from the
Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York on June 17, 1902, Fain was a
piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until teaming
with Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows What A Red-Headed
Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then
returned to Broadway and wrote songs for the smash 1938 review
``Hellzapoppin.''
   Two songs from a failed Fain musical that year, ``I'll Be Seeing
You'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I,'' later became wartime classics.
The latter was recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Back in Hollywood after the war, Fain and Hilliard wrote the
songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune
``I'm Late.''
   He also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's ``Peter
Pan,'' which included the tune ``Second Star to the Right,'' and
wrote music for Disney's ``The Rescuers'' in 1977.
   Fain is survived by a son, Frank, of New York.

<HEAD>Alabama NAACP President Begins Four-Year Prison Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Alabama NAACP has
begun serving a four-year sentence for a federal bribery conviction.
   Thomas Reed, 61, a former Alabama House member, surrendered at
11:30 a.m. Wednesday to a minimum-security prison in Pensacola, Fla.
   Donna Stratman, assistant superintendent at the 300-inmate
Staufley Field prison, said Reed was fingerprinted, photographed
and assigned a standard prison uniform.
   She said the prison, which has no fences, is located on Navy
property and inmates have work assignments in the facility or on
the Navy base.
   Reed, who in 1970 became one of the first two blacks to serve in
the Alabama Legislature since Reconstruction, was ousted from his
seat after he was convicted in September 1988 of accepting $10,000
as a bribe to help obtain an early release for a convicted
murderer, Anthony Chesser.
   The parole board denied the parole after Reed's involvement
became known. Chesser was released earlier this year.
   Reed was re-elected president of the Alabama chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in
August, and said last week he has no plans to resign.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta recently
upheld the conviction, but Reed's attorneys plan to take the case
to the Supreme Court.
   His attorneys say Reed, who predicts he will be vindicated,
should get a new trial because a jury heard about his attempts to
remove the Confederate flag from the Alabama Capitol.

<TEXT>
   The state House has passed a bill
requiring parental consent for unmarried girls under age 18 to have
an abortion in Michigan.
   The bill passed 65-39 Wednesday after the house rejected nearly
50 amendments, including one to require boys to wear condoms to
prevent teen-age pregnancy.
   It now goes to the Senate, which has passed a similar measure
and is expected to take action before lawmakers leave for the
winter holidays next week.
   That sets up a promised veto by Gov. James Blanchard, who has
pledged to strike down any measure restricting abortion rights.
   Opponents of the bill say it is merely intended to make it more
difficult for girls to get an abortion. Planned Parenthood
officials said at least 70 percent of pregnant minors in Michigan
already bring at least one parent to an abortion clinic with them.
   ``This bill is meant to put the squeeze on teen-agers with no
regard to the horrible alternatives they may seek,'' said Rep.
Maxine Berman, a Democrat. ``Can any of you live with yourself if a
woman resorts to a back-alley abortion, or to crack cocaine to
induce abortion, or to suicide? I don't want any more young people
to die.''
   Under the legislation, a pregnant girl could petition a probate
court to have an abortion if she believes she can't tell a parent
or if the parent refuses to let her have an abortion. Permission
would be required from just one of the parents.
   ``We're talking about the very bedrock of our society _
family,'' said Democratic Rep. Michael Griffin, the bill's sponsor.
``We recognize there are families in trouble, that's why we put the
judicial bypass in there.''
   William Kandler, spokesman for Blanchard, said the Democratic
governor wouldn't change his mind despite a poll by The Detroit
News that said 68 percent of state residents favor a parental
consent requirement.
   ``I'm hopeful the governor will think about parents and not his
own personal beliefs,'' said Barbara Listing, president of Right to
Life of Michigan.
   Margy Long, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Michigan, said
she was encouraged by at least 40 signatures collected on the House
floor asking the governor to veto the bill.
   That is more than enough to sustain a veto in the 109-member
House, although supporters of the bill say they have enough votes
for an override in the Senate.
   Meanwhile, the state Department of Public Health reported
Wednesday that the number of abortions in Michigan during the third
quarter of 1989 fell 23 percent from the same period last year.
   The drop comes on the heels of similar declines reported
beginning in late 1988 with the implementation of a ban on
state-funded Medicaid abortions for poor women.
   The 8,696 abortions between July 1 and Sept. 30 compared with
11,358 in the same months in 1988.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Parliament Votes to End Communist Party Supremacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lithuanian parliament voted today to abolish
the Communist Party's constitutionally guaranteed supremacy and to
legalize multiple political parties in the Baltic republic,
activists said.
   The move made Lithuania the first Soviet republic to reject the
Communist Party's legal lock on power. It also presented a bold
challenge to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has said that
demands for more autonomy in some of the 15 republics are
endangering his economic reform program.
   Gorbachev also has been trying to crack down on the autonomy
movements to reassure orthodox Soviet Communists who have been
alarmed by challenges to the Communist Party at home and in several
Eastern bloc countries.
   Eduardas Potashinskas, a Lithuanian activist who has been
monitoring the Supreme Soviet's legislative sessions, said the vote
today was 243-1, with 39 abstentions. A vote on the same proposal
Wednesday fell nine votes short of the two-thirds majority required
to pass it. The lawmakers decided to vote again today, in part
because 84 deputies were absent and 30 abstained on Wednesday.
   ``During the session (today) of the Supreme Soviet of Lithuania,
the 6th article of the constitution of the L.S.S.R. was abolished
and changed into the new formula which declares a multiparty
system,'' the information department of the Lithuanian political
movement Sajudis said in a telex statement.
   Sajudis spokesmen said new language recognizes that political
parties and movements are within the legal framework of the
Lithuanian Constitution.
   Article 6, which became part of the basic law of the Soviet
Union with the Brezhnev Constitution of 1977, makes the Communist
Party the ``leading and guiding force of Soviet society.''
Eliminating it could help reduce the party's grip on on all spheres
of life.
   The Lithuanian action only affects that republic, and is likely
to face a stiff challenge from Moscow. A similar proposal in the
Armenia republic failed Wednesday when the legislature failed to
draw a quorum.
   The Lithuanian party is moving toward a showdown with the
Kremlin over its plans to separate from the Soviet Communist Party.
Gorbachev has spoken out sharply against that. The Lithuanians have
scheduled a Dec. 19 party congress to decide on the issue.
   Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and Hungary all recently
dropped similar provisions in their constitutions granting special
status to their Communist parties to satisfy pro-democracy
movements in their societies.
   In Moscow, green photocopied cards have appeared in metro
stations and main streets calling for a two-hour general strike on
Monday to ask the Congress of People's Deputies to rescind the same
provision in the national constitution.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and five fellow members
of the Soviet parliament signed the appeal.
   Sakharov and his fellow deputies are calling for the brief
general strike from 10 a.m. to noon on Monday to pressure the
national Congress into voting to rescind Article 6 and on draft
laws on land, property and business enterprises. The Congress
starts its second semi-annual session Tuesday.
   ``It is of great importance that Article 6 of the Constitution
be abandoned,'' Sakharov was quoted as saying by the Soviet news
bulletin Interfax published today. ``We cannot afford to bob in the
wake of changes that are taking place in Eastern Europe.''
   In Czechoslovakia, the parliamentary action was preceded by a
similar symbolic strike. Czechoslovak strike organizers publicized
their plan through massive demonstrations, wall posters, and direct
organizing at factories.
   Sakharov was quoted by Interfax as saying that dropping the
provision from the Soviet constitution ``is extremely important in
checking the crisis of confidence in the country.''
   The Supreme Soviet, a full-time working legislature, is supposed
to hammer out new laws, but its parent body, the Congress, must
approve any changes in the Constitution. The Supreme Soviet voted
on a proposal in early November to place consideration of Article 6
on the Congressional agenda, but the proposal defeated by a narrow
margin.
   The Congress is the centerpiece of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's political reforms. Its 2,250 deputies were elected last
March in the country's first competitive elections in more than 70
years.

   Bells tolled and mournful chants
filled the streets today as Armenia marked the one-year anniversary
of the earthquake that killed at least 25,000 people.
   In this mountain city hit hardest by the quake, officials
stopped the big town clock forever at 11:41, the minute disaster
struck Dec. 7, 1988.
   ``If only it could all have been a dream, and we could wake up
and have everyone here again,'' Armenian poet Maro Marzarian told a
crowd of several hundred gathered to dedicate a memorial to
Leninakan's victims.
   In a cemetery just outside town, hundreds of families gathered
at gravesites, some openly sobbing, others in stony silence. Among
the many graves of the earthquake victims were plots for the
remains of unidentifiable corpses, with markers reading only ``238
woman'' or ``453 child.''
   ``Your soul hurts so much you just can't express it,'' said
Lilia Stepanian, 25, whose brother, Zillik, and his family were
crushed to death in their Leninakan apartment.
   ``You remember that on this day, at this time, they were already
gone,'' she said. ``At this time one year ago I was standing by our
house, only it wasn't a house any more.''
   She said Zillik's 3-year-old daughter could be heard crying from
the ruins of the house but rescuers could not reach her.
   ``And the people left alive have such a hard time,'' Ms.
Stepanian said. She and her mother have moved to the Armenian
capital, Yerevan, until Leninakan housing can be built for them.
They don't expect that anytime soon.
   The earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale killed at
least 25,000 people and left 500,000 people homeless.
   A year after the earthquake, 20,000 people are still missing,
according to the relief agency Search.
   The destruction was massive. The town of Spitak was leveled.
Kirovakan and some 300 villages were shattered.
   In Leninakan alone _ then Armenia's second-largest city with
235,000 people _ the quake destroyed 99 nine-story apartment
buildings, 10 schools, and every factory, officials said.
   The Soviet leadership promised after the quake that Leninakan
and the other demolished communities would be rebuilt within two
years.

<TEXT>
   The National Commission on AIDS says it
submitted its first report to the White House eight months early
because the crisis has become too urgent to wait.
   ``We have heard what people were telling us _ that a crisis
situation does exist,'' said Dr. David Rogers, vice chairman of the
commission that began its work in August.
   The commission Wednesday released the six-page report it sent to
President Bush, calling for ``a national voice'' to repair a health
care system that is in danger of crumbling under the weight of a
worsening AIDS epidemic.
   ``The public health care system in this country is not working
well and nowhere is that more evident than for people with'' AIDs
and people infected with the HIV virus, the cause of AIDS.
   ``While AIDS is not the cause of the health care system's
disarray, it may well be the crisis that could pressure responsible
national action to correct its serious shortfalls,'' the report
said.
   Among the problems it cites are lack of training support for
primary care physicians to treat people with HIV infection and AIDS
and low reimbursement rates that discourage physicians from
treating Medicaid patients with AIDS.
   Also, many AIDS patients have no public or private health
insurance, which limits their access to life-prolonging drugs, the
report said.
   The commission was required to draft its first report by August
1990. But commissioners told Bush in a letter that testimony they
heard during four days of hearings ``was so compelling we felt it
is vital to write to you now.''
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, who as secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services is a non-voting member of the commission, did
not participate in writing the report and his press office was not
aware of the document until asked about it by reporters.
   James Brown, a spokesman for Sullivan, said the secretary has
expressed concern about some of the same issues addressed by the
report. However, Brown took issue with the proposition contained in
the report that national leadership is lacking.
   ``There has been leadership from this department and there will
continue to be,'' Brown said, citing the department's work on AIDS
education programs, drug research at the National Institutes of
Health and federal funds underMedicaid to treat people with AIDS.
   But the commission said more needs to be done.
   ``To date, there is no national policy or plan, and no national
voice,'' the report said.
   What's needed, the commission said, is ``frank recognition that
a crisis exists in many cities that will require extraordinary
measures to overcome.''
   The panel recommended creation of a ``flexible, patient-oriented
comprehensive system of care,'' and possible creation of a network
of regional centers to provide back-up and consultation to primary
care physicians treating AIDS patients.
   It also called for creation of units to treat of HIV patients
who are intravenous drug addicts. AIDS is spreading rapidly through
needle sharing among drug users, who are passing it to their sexual
partners and their children.
   The advisory commission was created as the follow-on to a Reagan
administration panel chaired by retired Adm. James D. Watkins that
called for a major escalation of federal efforts to prevent, treat
and cure AIDS and for enactment of legislation barring
discrimination against victims of the disease.
   Federal health officials say 112,241 people have been found with
AIDS in the United States since June 1981, and 66,493 of them have
died.
   More than 1 million Americans are believed to be infected with
HIV. The commission said that over the next four years AIDS is
likely to claim 200,000 lives.
   The report estimated that direct medical care for people with
AIDS in 1991 will cost from $2.5 billion to $15.1 billion. It notes
the range is from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of total
health care spending in the nation.
   ``We simply must be prepared to make these expenditures,'' the
report said.

   A man who police say has threatened
``Tonight Show'' host Johnny Carson for more than two years was
arrested in the lobby of the KNBC-TV studios where the program is
videotaped.
   Ken Orville Gause, 36, of Milwaukee was booked Wednesday for
investigation of making terrorist threats, attempted extortion and
carrying a concealed weapon, police Sgt. Don Goldberg said. He was
scheduled for arraignment Friday.
   Studio security guards notified police when Gause showed up at
the huge NBC complex and began ``making demands and threats,''
Goldberg said.
   He was carrying a ``slug,'' a sock weighted with a heavy
granular substance, when he was arrested, Goldberg said.
   Gause never got close to the talk-show host, Goldberg said.
   He had been under investigation for two years following threats
allegedly made against Carson in letters and tape-recorded messages
that also named other celebrities, detectives said.
   Carson spokesman Charlie Barrett declined to comment, and police
would not disclose which other celebrities were threatened.

<HEAD>Communist Program Calls for Elections Soon</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with new party program calling for free

<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist Party published a
new program today that calls for free elections as soon as possible
and broad cooperation with the opposition in an effort to salvage
its diminishing power.
   The program was announced as representatives of the Communists
and opposition opened talks on the country's future.
   The Communists held a monopoly on power in East Germany for 40
years, but two months of political upheaval have resulted in the
loss of its guaranteed leadership role.
   On Wednesday, former party leader Egon Krenz stepped down from
his last official post, the presidency, and was replaced by a
non-Communist, Manfred Gerlach, for the first time in the country's
40-year history. Gerlach will be president until Parliament chooses
a permanent replacement.
   Krenz's Politburo and Central Committee resigned Sunday and were
replaced by a 25-member panel of party reformers, who drew up the
new program to be discussed at an emergency party congress Friday.
   ``We support free and secret elections as early as possible, at
a time to be set jointly by all political forces,'' said the party
program, which was published by the official ADN news agency. It
did not suggest a date for elections.
   The program proposed that all ``newly formed democratic
political movements and forces'' work together until the elections.
That was a reference to opposition movements such as New Forum that
have sprung up in recent weeks.
   The program also called for a new consitution and new penal and
administrative codes.
   The party newspaper Neues Deutschland has indicated that the
Communists' traditional leadership hierarchy _ the Politburo and
Central Committee _ will be abolished at the congress. Several East
German officials have said the Communists plan to change the
party's name to the Socialist Party, as was done in Hungary
recently.
   The 25-member panel conceded the party is ``responsible for the
deepest crisis in the history of the German Democratic Republic''
and accused ``a certain circle of party functionaries'' of taking
part in criminal and unregulated actions,'' according to ADN.
   ``Only a radical break with (the party's) Stalinist basic
structures can create a new political home for those in our party
who favor a free, just and solidarity-oriented society,'' the panel
said.
   The talks today involved Communist officials and representatives
of the main opposition group New Forum and four small political
parties that had been Communist allies but broke with the party in
recent days.
   About 300 demonstrators gathered outside the church where the
talks were going on, demanding the talks be broadened to include
other groups.
   A trade union representative complained that labor leaders had
not been invited to the talks.
   Krenz took power Oct. 18 after hard-line leader Erich Honecker
was forced to resign amid rising calls for reforms. Krenz opened
the country's borders and promised sweeping reforms, but his
long-time association with the Honecker government and growing
pressure from the opposition and party ranks finally forced him out.
   The upheaval set into motion investigations into abuses of power
by the ousted Communist elite, whose members allegedly exploited
their high position to rob public coffers and live lavish
lifestyles.
   Honecker and others are under house arrest, and criminal probes
are under way. Three former Politburo members, including former
economics czar Guenter Mittag, have been arrested.
   Early today, West Berlin police spokesman Helmut Hinz announced
that Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, a former leading East German
trade official, was in a West Berlin prison following an
international manhunt. Schalck-Golodkowski is accused of pocketing
millions of dollars in illegal arms sales.
   Groups of demonstrators have been surrounding secret police
stations in recent days to prevent former officials from spiriting
away incriminating documents that may be used for investigations of
former leaders.
   On Wednesday, the government appealed for ``calm and restraint''
after reports of pro-reform activists seizing secret police
facilities in the cities of Leipzig and Gera.
   A recently formed citizens action group headquartered in East
Berlin claims numerous officials under probe by an official
investigative committee have managed to destroy evidence that could
be used against them.
   ADN reported late Wednesday the suicide of an official who had
been caught trying to leave a government building in East Berlin on
Monday with two suitcases stuffed with state funds.
   The news agency said the man was arrested after trying to remove
funds stashed by Schalck-Golodkowski.

   Two deputies have been charged with
conspiring to delay the court-ordered seizure of property from a
financially troubled company, after Mayor W. Wilson Goode called
the sheriff on behalf of the company's owner.
   The delay last January gave the businessman time to avoid the
seizure by declaring bankruptcy.
   Goode says he did nothing wrong by referring the businessman to
the sheriff and said the grand jury report describing the man as a
friend of his was wrong.
   The two deputies surrendered Wednesday to face charges they
conspired to delay the seizure of $160,000 worth of machinery from
Elijah Medley's business.
   A grand jury presentment released Wednesday said Medley faced
the seizure after defaulting on about $500,000 in loans. The grand
jury also raised questions about the involvement of city officials.
   In Pennsylvania, grand juries may issue a presentment
recommending that a prosecutor charge someone, instead of issuing
an indictment bringing the charge itself.
   ``We are concerned that city officials knowingly abused the
power of their office to unfairly benefit one citizen at the
expense of other citizens to impede the orderly administration of
justice,'' the presentment said.
   ``We will continue our investigation to determine if there was a
systemic abuse of power and to determine whether any other public
officials were involved in such conduct.''
   The prosecutor is District Attorney Ronald Castille, a
Republican considered to be a mayoral prospect in 1991.
   Goode and Sheriff John Green, both Democrats, denied any
wrongdoing.
   ``I did not intervene,'' the mayor told reporters. ``I simply
referred a businessman, who is not my friend, to someone who could
help him. ... I can assure you that Ron Castille knows deep down in
his soul that I did nothing wrong.''
   ``I don't do wrong things, and I resent anyone implying that.''
   Green also denied wrongdoing, and said he was confident that
Chief Deputy Joseph Graves Jr., 56, and Lt. Robert Armstrong, 41,
would be exonerated of what he called ``weak charges that have
obvious political implications.''
   The defendants are accused of ``purposely failing to execute a
court-ordered seizure of equipment from Medley Tool and Model
Co.,'' Castille said. The seizure was supposed to have been made
Jan. 30, but it was delayed and the company filed for bankruptcy
Feb. 1.
   Charges against Graves and Armstrong include criminal conspiracy
and tampering with public records or official information, each a
felony punishable by up to seven years in prison.
   Neither Goode nor Green denied the mayor had made a telephone
call on behalf of Medley shortly before the seizure was to have
been made.
   Goode said Medley called him _ the grand jury presentment
described the businessman as the mayor's friend, which Goode said
was inaccurate _ and asked for help about a ``sheriff's sale''
problem for which he needed more time. Goode said he then called
Green at home.
   The sheriff declined to discuss details of the case, but said he
felt it was political. He also said parts of the presentment were
inaccurate.
   Castille, just elected to a second term, said both the mayor and
sheriff appeared to have ``played an integral part'' in the case.
   The presentment said that after the writ was delayed ``Sheriff
Green asked Chief Graves, `Has the mayor's job been taken care of?'
(and) Graves said that it had.''
   The mayor summoned reporters to his City Hall office and denied
he had done anything wrong, insisting the phone call from a
businessman was normal and that all he did was refer it to the
sheriff.
   Medley couldn't be reached by telephone for reaction. His
company, though in bankruptcy, is still in business, but telephone
calls are taken by an answering service.

<HEAD>Bush Accepts Wall's `Unselfish' Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a letter released today,
accepted the resignation of M. Danny Wall as overseer of the
nation's savings and loan institutions and praised the embattled
regulator for his ``unselfish'' decision to quit.
   ``As the first director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, you
served during the important organizational phase of the new
agency,'' Bush told Wall in a four-paragraph letter dated Wednesday.
   ``I thank you for your hard work in that position, and for your
unselfish recognition that the job of revitalizing the industry
demands the complete and undistracted attention of the agency's
entire leadership and staff,'' the president wrote.
   Wall announced his resignation on Monday, bowing to demands in
Congress that he quit because of his handling of the S&amp;L crisis.
   Wall took over as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
in July 1987. Last August, he became director of the thrift office
when the bank board was dismantled under S&amp;L bailout legislation.
   Wall was the focus of six weeks of hearings by the House Banking
Committee, which was investigating his handling of the failure of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif. It is expected
to be the nation's biggest thrift failure at a cost to taxpayers of
$2 billion.
   Wall told reporters Monday that he was resigning because
continuing the fight with the committee would distract the agency
from conducting its work.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, accused the administration of
``not having any guts'' for failing to support Wall. Garn, who
brought Wall to Washington in 1975 as his chief aide, made his
remarks in an interview with the Deseret News of Salt Lake City.
   Wall is continuing to serve as thrift office director for an
unspecified transitional period. His successor has not been
selected.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco blamed a truck
bombing that killed 52 people in the capital on drug traffickers
and pledged not to allow Colombian democracy to succumb to their
``bloody tyranny.''
   Barco went on national television Wednesday night after 1,100
pounds of dynamite were detonated in front of the offices of the
secret police in Bogota, gouging out a 20-foot-deep crater and
wounding hundreds of people.
   It was one of the worst terrorist attacks in Colombian history.
   ``In the last few days, the criminal organization of drug
traffickers has begun a vile assault that has cost the lives of
many innocent Colombians,'' Barco told his countrymen.
   Three more bombs exploded in the cocaine-trafficking center of
Medellin just before the speech was transmitted from Tokyo, where
Barco was on a state visit. The bombs, targeting a Mormon temple,
an evangelical church and an electronics shop, caused only slight
damage and no injuries, police said.
   Today, a bomb exploded on a road in the northern coastal city of
Cartagena, killing two policemen in a car, radio reports said. But
pamphlets found at the scene suggested the attack was carried out
by the National Liberation Army, the most active of Colombia's six
leftist guerrilla groups.
   Barco said the bombing at federal intelligence police
headquarters was part of a string of attacks by drug gangs intended
to force the government to stop extraditing to the United States
traffickers indicted by U.S. authorities.
   He said traffickers also were responsible for the Nov. 27
bombing of a Colombian jetliner that killed all 107 people aboard,
as well as for Tuesday's assassination of a Medellin judge.
   He said the country's resolve to battle traffickers would not
waver as a result of their terrorist onslaught.
   ``They will not succeed in defeating us,'' he said. ``We are
fighting and will continue to fight. The war is against all
Colombia, against democracy. We will not allow ourselves to fall to
the bloody tyranny of the narcoterrorists.''
   The Extraditables, a group linked to the powerful Medellin
cocaine cartel, claimed responsibility for the truck bombing at
intellegence police heaquarters. The claim came in a written
communique received Tuesday by half a dozen newspapers and radio
stations in Medellin.
   The morning rush hour explosion killed at least 52 people and
wounded about 1,000. Aerial photographs showed extensive damage to
buildings in a nearly two square mile area.
   The explosion, felt more than three miles away, caused $23
million worth of damage to about 1,500 houses and buildings,
including nearby Justice Ministry offices.
   The Extraditables said in their message that they would continue
the terrorist campaign until the Senate approves a national
referendum on the country's extradition policy.
   The Barco administration has sent nine drug suspects to the
United States since decreeing the policy in August, when it
declared all-out war on traffickers after they were blamed for the
assassination of a popular presidential candidate.
   However, none of the 12 leading cocaine bosses wanted for
extradition to the United States have been caught.
   On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed a bill that
would allow the public to decide in a plebiscite whether the policy
should continue.
   The administration has vehemently opposed the bill, maintaining
it would lead to more terrorist violence as traffickers try to
intimidate Colombians into rejecting extradition.
   Today, the head of the governing Liberal Party, former President
Julio Cesar Turbay, said he would resign if the Colombian congress
approves the bill allowing the referendum on extraditions. Turbay
made the announcement in a statement published in Bogota dailies.
   In his speech, Barco said the latest terrorist attacks prove the
prediction's validity.
   ``These incidents show what these criminals would do to make
sure that the referendum results are in their favor,'' Barco said.
   There is still no indication on which way the Senate might vote
on the referendum. But the bombings of the intelligence police
offices and the Avianca Airlines Boeing 727 are likely to
strengthen support for the administration's opposition the
referendum.
   ``I was for a dialogue (with traffickers) before the bombings,
but now, no way,'' said one man interviewed on the news program
``24 Hours.''
   Traffickers have since August been bombing public places,
including banks, supermarkets and theaters, in an effort to
pressure the government into reversing its decision to extradite.
   But most of the the 201 previous bombings had been at night and
consequently caused relatively few civilian casualties. The
campaign had killed 29 people before the latest phase of
indiscriminate slaughter began with the bomb aboard the jetliner.
   The intelligence police chief, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, said
Wednesday's truck bomb was an example of the worst type of crime.
Maza was in the building at the time of the attack and he said that
although he was the main target, the bombing was aimed at all
Colombians.
   ``It was an indiscriminate act against the country, against
everything,'' he said in a radio interview late Wednesday with the
RCN network.

<UNK>Mitchell Heirs Pleased With Ruling in French Plaigiarism Suit</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for Margaret Mitchell's heirs said he
was pleased with a Paris court's ruling that a French best-seller
plagiarized the classic ``Gone With the Wind,'' but said he plans
to appeal for more damages.
   The French court ruled Wednesday that Regine Deforges must pay
the Mitchell estate $333,000 in damages and interest because her
best-sellr ``The Blue Bicycle'' illegally pirated the Atlanta
author's book. The Mitchell heirs had sought $833,000 from Ms.
Deforges and her publisher.
   ``We are exceedingly pleased with the findings of the court as
to piracy,'' said Atlanta attorney Hal Clark, a former law partner
of Miss Mitchell's late brother, Stephens Mitchell, and an executor
of the ``Gone With the Wind'' estate.
   ``We are somewhat disappointed in the award of damages,
however,'' he added, saying he plans to appeal.
   Stephens Mitchell's son, Joe, accepted the news calmly.
   ``It sounds all right. We seem to have won the case,'' he said.
   Franck Spengler, president of the company that published Ms.
Deforges' book, said he and the author also would appeal. The
novelist was in West Germany and unavailable for comment, he said.
   ``We feel we're innocent,'' Spengler said Wednesday.
   ``The books are both great novels but they are very different.
... `The Blue Bicycle' is a historical novel smattered with
psychology and emotion while `Gone With the Wind' is a
psychological novel cloaked with history,'' he said.
   In a judgment issued by Judge Nicole Antoine, the court
concluded ``The Blue Bicycle'' constituted an ``illicit
reproduction'' of ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``Based on a comparative study of the two works, it is clear
that what Regine Deforges borrowed from Margaret Mitchell's work
and incorporated into `The Blue Bicycle' is perfectly identifiable
and relates to the most important elements of Ms. Mitchell's
novel,'' the statement said.
   ``The Blue Bicycle,'' which has sold millions of copies since it
was published in 1983 as the first part of a trilogy, is set during
the Nazi occupation of France.
   Its heroine, Lea Delmas, is the beautiful, headstrong daughter
of a southern vintner. Like Scarlett O'Hara, the beautiful,
headstrong daughter of a southern planter, she finds her carefree
youth interrupted by the horrors of war.
   Like Scarlett, Lea wants the one man she cannot have. Laurent
d'Argilat has married the sweet, fragile and morally upright
Camille, a character similar to Melanie Wilkes, wife of Scarlett's
unrequited love, Ashley Wilkes.
   Ms. Deforges' French-style Rhett Butler _ Francois Tavernier _
is a swarthy, cigar-smoking rogue who miraculously turns up
whenever Lea needs him.
   The case has been long and complicated because there are few
precedents. French law forbids plagiarism, but it does allow
pastiche, a centuries-old literary form defined as a ``humorous''
take-off or remake of a recognizable original text.
   Ms. Deforges repeatedly asserted that her novel was meant as a
pastiche, but the court rejected her argument, saying the
differences between the two works were ``undeniably secondary and
inoperative given the extent of their similarities.''

   Former President Reagan is trying to quash a
subpoena for his notes and diaries by onetime national security
adviser John Poindexter, saying it encroaches on the office of the
presidency.
   Poindexter, facing trial Jan. 22, contends that notes and
diaries compiled by Reagan will show the ex-president authorized
the activities for which Poindexter has been accused of crimes.
   In a court filing Wednesday, Reagan said Poindexter's subpoena
was a ``broad-gauge discovery device masquerading as a trial
subpoena'' and that it seeks a ``laundry list'' of documents on 67
different subjects.
   The subpoena raises constitutional concerns about the
president's prerogative to ``maintain a purely personal and private
record of his thoughts and reflections,'' said Reagan's lawyers.
   ``Nothing could be closer to the core of the presidency and more
private than the intimate and confidential communications by the
president with himself,'' the lawyers argued.
   Reagan and the Justice Department suggested in separate filings
that President Bush might become involved in the battle over the
records from Reagan's presidency.
   Reagan suggested a review of a limited number of diary excerpts
by U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene, who is handling the
Poindexter case.
   ``Only then should the former president and, if appropriate, the
incumbent president be forced to assert or waive executive
privilege,'' Reagan said in the court papers.
   The Justice Department urged the court to consider Bush's views
before taking the ``extremely serious step'' of forcing public
disclosure of Reagan's diaries.
   The Justice Department proposed a procedure under which it would
review a sealed filing that Poindexter made to the court outlining
``what he believes are in the diaries and why he needs them.''
   The department noted that this procedure would not compromise
the secrecy of Poindexter's defense because the office of
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, not the Justice Department, is
prosecuting the case.
   After reviewing Poindexter's filing, the Justice Department said
it would prepare a response. The court could then inspect excerpts
of the diaries, the Justice Department said.
   The department moved to quash a similar subpoena for Reagan
papers served by Poindexter on the National Archives and Records
Administration. The material sought from the Archives has already
been turned over to Iran-Contra prosecutors, the Justice Department
said.
   Reagan's lawyers said any diary entry must be found by the judge
to be ``central'' to Poindexter's case and ``essential to justice''
before it can be disclosed.
   Earlier Wednesday, the judge rejected a request by Poindexter to
subpoena records from 65 U.S. senators and representatives.
   Greene also denied as overly broad Poindexter's request to issue
subpoenas to a number of congressional committees, the office of
White House counsel and the National Security Agency. The judge did
not disclose how many committees Poindexter wanted to subpoena.
   The judge said the only apparent basis for the proposed
subpoenas to the members of Congress is that they ``at one time or
other met with Oliver North.''
   North, a former National Security Council staff member, was
involved in the secret Contra resupply network and the
administration's arms sales to Iran. He was convicted of three
felonies in the Iran-Contra affair and is appealing.
   Poindexter has said that Reagan ``formulated'' or tacitly
approved ``the administration's position'' on matters for which
Poindexter now faces trial.
   He has said his communications with Reagan included discussion
of a White House chronology that falsely said no one in the U.S.
government knew at the time that a 1985 shipment to Iran contained
Hawk missiles.
   Another subject Poindexter says he discussed with Reagan is the
administration's view of a proposed House resolution of inquiry
into North's secret Contra resupply network. Poindexter is accused
of obstructing Congress by endorsing earlier denials that the
National Security Council staff was soliciting funds or
coordinating military efforts for the Contras.

   A 14-year-old who was with two boys shot
to death by a police officer after a car chase has been found in
contempt of court for refusing to testify before a grand jury.
   The boy, whose name has not been released because he is a
juvenile, was sentenced Wednesday by Dakota County District Judge
George Hoey to 90 days in the Ramsey County Juvenile Detention
Center. Hoey said he would release the boy if he decides to testify
before the grand jury adjourns, which is expected Friday.
   The grand jury is investigating the Nov. 15 shooting.
   According to court documents, three boys ran from a stolen car
they had driven into a ditch as police chased them. The 14-year-old
ran in a different direction from Thai Yang and Ba See Lor, both
13. Lor and Yang were killed by a shotgun blast to their backs
fired by Kenneth Murphy, an Inver Grove Heights police officer,
according to court documents.
   Murphy said one of the boys pointed a screwdriver, and he
mistook it for a gun.
   The boy refused to testify Wednesday even after a special state
prosecutor assured the boy's attorney he would not be indicted.
   Villaume maintained that the grand jury is independent of the
prosecutor and it could indict the boy on a charge of murder.
People can be charged with murder when deaths occur during the
commission of a felony, in this case the car theft.
   The killings angered Minnesota's substantial community of
Southeast Asian refugees. The boys' parents, who live in St. Paul,
are Hmong immigrants.

   Iraq said today it launched a rocket
capable of carrying satellites into space, a development that would
have profound implications for the military balance in the Middle
East.
   Hussein Kamel, minister of industry and military
industrialization, said on state-run Baghdad radio that the
three-stage rocket was launched at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday from the
Al-Anbar space research center.
   He also claimed that Iraq has developed two other
surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 1,240 miles. If true,
this would double the reach of Iraq's missile arsenal.
   The heaviest missile the Iraqis are believed to have developed
is the al-Hussain weapon with a range of around 560 miles.
   There was no independent confirmation of the launch.
   The report did not specify the missile's flight path or say
where the research center is located. Kamel said the 48-ton rocket
will be used to launch a satellite for scientific research. He said
it used a 70-ton first-stage launch vehicle, far bigger than
anything the Iraqis were believed to possess.
   He said the launch was the first stage of an Iraqi space
research program.
   Oil-rich Iraq is the only Arab country to have claimed it has
the capability of launching satellites into space. If true, this
could enable it to develop a military satellite to spy on Israel
and Iraq's rivals in the region.
   Israel is the only Middle East country known to have satellite
capability.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has been driving to develop an
aerospace industry for some time and has spent billions of dollars
on missile development.
   The most ambitious part of the program was developing a
multi-stage ballistic missile with Egypt and Argentina based on
Argentina's Condor missile.
   The radio report quoted Kamel as telling Saddam in a telegram
announcing the launch that the rocket was built at Iraqi
military-industrial research centers. But intelligence officials
and diplomats have been skeptical for some time about such claims.
   Israel launched the Ofek-1 satellite Sept. 19, 1988, from a
military base south of Tel Aviv. It said Ofek-1 was designed for
scientific research, but Arab governments fear it will be used as a
spy satellite.
   Israel has said it is working on an Ofek-2 satellite. The Soviet
news agency Tass reported that the Israelis launched a ballistic
missile Sept. 14.
   Israel denied it, but Western intelligence agencies believe the
reported firing could have been an abortive effort to launch Ofek-2
into orbit.
   If the Iraqis have acquired the potential to put a satellite
into space, the Iranians and Syrians would be concerned.
   Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war that was halted by a
cease-fire last year, but peace talks have deadlocked and both
sides are rearming.
   Syria is Saddam's archrival in the Arab world and was allied
with Iran against Iraq during the war.
   A spy satellite capability would greatly enhance Saddam's
military might and would erode Israel's long-held technological
superiority, already threatened by the buildup of long-range,
surface-to-surface missiles by Iraq, Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia.
Libya too is seeking a missile arsenal.

   After two years of protests, strikes and
bloodshed, the Palestinian uprising has lost its way, failing to
deliver a Palestinian state or even negotiations with Israel.
   At the same time, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
government, which refuses to talk with Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization, is increasingly frustrated over its
inability to restore calm either through diplomacy or force of arms.
   Divisions on both sides have blocked compromises that could have
started negotiations.
   Unless peace efforts gain momentum, the prospects are for even
meaner streets with radical Palestinians gaining influence and
calling for the use of guns, not words, to solve the problem.
   The toll from the ``intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ is
already fearful.
   By Associated Press count, 626 Palestinians have been killed by
Israelis. U.N. figures show 39,000 Arabs wounded and 40,000 jailed,
9,000 of whom were denied a trial. Also, 363 Arab houses have been
demolished or sealed, and 60 activists deported.
   On the other side, 43 Israelis have died and 2,438 civilians and
1,635 soldiers were wounded in more than 60,000 incidents of
unrest. Israel's economy suffered about $800 million in lost
production and tourism as well as increased military costs,
including two months a year of reserve duty for most men.
   Despite the high cost, Palestinians have scored gains:
   They succeeded in defining the territory in the West Bank, Gaza
Strip and east Jerusalem that they want for an independent state.
Except for soldiers, most Israelis rarely venture into these areas
now.
   The underground, pro-PLO Unified National Leadership of the
Uprising has also demonstrated unity and determination with
once-a-week general strikes and the closure of stores and
businesses every afternoon.
   But the strikes and rock-throwing have become routine, almost
mechanical gestures that, despite the ongoing bloodshed, no longer
carry the political punch needed to arouse international concern
and pressure on Israel.
   ``I believe over the last few months we have lost the
initiative, and there has been a vacuum of strategy. We haven't had
any renewed strategic plan to put into the intefadeh,'' said Sari
Nusseibeh, a leading Palestinian intellectual.
   Nusseibeh, a philosphy professor considered by Israelis to be a
senior pro-PLO activist, said Palestinians should use ``positive
energy'' to create a provisional government.
   He proposed health, education, welfare and other organizations
be united into area-wide PLO-run institutions that could serve as
the basis for ministries in a future government.
   Israel's government launched an initiative to start the peace
process with elections in the occupied lands to chose a Palestinian
delegation for talks. But the Cabinet is deeply divided and unable
to deliver compromises to satisfy Palestinian demands that the PLO
have a public role.
   Two prominent Israeli intellectuals, journalists Ehud Yaari and
Zeev Shiff, proposed that Israel stage an ``administrative
withdrawal'' from occupied lands as an interim step until elections
can be arranged.
   They suggested turning over some government functions to
moderate Palestinians who would be likely to win elections if they
were held.
   ``Thus some of the burden of occupation would be removed and
friction between the inhabitants and the Israeli army will be
reduced,'' they wrote.
   Ephraim Sneh, a retired general who once headed the West Bank
military government, told a seminar at Hebrew University that the
PLO, in seeking to influence international opinion, had failed to
persuade average Israelis that it had really wanted peace.
   Sneh called for Palestinians to shift focus and ``understand in
the coming year that their real opportunity is not in gaining the
sympathy of the world but the confidence of Israelis.''
   ``Israeli society is a traumatized society,'' he said, alluding
to the Jews' experience with the Nazi Holocaust and repeated wars
with the Arabs.
   ``It is difficult for the Israelis to believe that after 22
years, the PLO really abandoned terrorism,'' he said.
   In recent months, there has been increasing concern about the
rise of Palestinian radicals who oppose negotiations and advocate
armed struggle.
   Splits in Palestinian ranks are already clear with small
extremist groups taking over neighborhoods or towns and, according
to underground leaflets, operating independently.
   Inter-Palestinian violence has increased. Palestinians have
killed 154 of their fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of informing
for Israel.
   Groups calling themselves the Black Panthers and Red Eagles
controlled the Casbah quarter of the West Bank's largest city of
Nablus, killing 25 suspected collaborators and shooting at Israeli
outposts.
   The army claimed to have neutralized the two groups, killing or
capturing their leaders in recent weeks, but there is ongoing
concern such groups will proliferate as frustrations grow over a
lack of progress toward peace talks.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the Arabic daily Al Fajr in Jerusalem,
said peace prospects appeared bleak but that the Palestinian
leadership was trying to maintain its no-guns policy.
   ``Palestinians are trying in every way to keep this a
non-violent resistance movement in order to positively affect
Israel public opinion,'' he said, calling for increased
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.

<HEAD>AMA Supports AIDS Notification; Attacks Tobacco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Medical Association policymakers have
recommended that communities set up systems to find and notify
unsuspecting sexual or needle-sharing partners of people infected
with the AIDS virus.
   The AMA's House of Delegates on Wednesday also broadened its
attack on drug abuse to include tobacco-related diseases.
   The delegates approved the AIDS notification policy by voice
vote as part of a resolution that encourages state legislatures to
establish laws for reporting and following up on serious
communicable diseases including AIDS.
   The resolution says communities and prisons should have systems
to notify people who are at risk of AIDS because they have sexual
partners or share drug needles with infected people.
   Dr. David Johnson of Arkansas said concern for patient privacy
should be secondary in light of the number of AIDS deaths in the
United States. As of the end of October, the federal health
authorities had recorded 112,241 cases of AIDS in the United
States, with 66,493 deaths.
   However, former military physician J. William Cox of San Diego
protested, saying devising a system to keep track of sexual or
drug-use partners would ``waste incredible amounts of money'' and
drive people infected with the AIDS virus underground.
   In other business, the association resisted an attempt to remove
tobacco from a resolution naming substance abuse its top health
priority.
   The resolution included the endorsement of a routine screening
program for all pregnant women and those of childbearing age for
evidence of substance abuse.
   Before ending its three-day meeting Wednesday, the AMA delegates
also ordered the restructuring of the group's internal organization
and restricted the authority of its executive vice president.
   That action came after AMA Executive Vice President James H.
Sammons approved two financial deals with executives that failed
and caused thousands of dollars in losses.
   Sammons accepted full responsibility for the deals and a call
for his immediate resignation failed, with more than two-thirds of
the 435 delegates supporting him. Sammons is due to retire at the
end of next year.
   The organization's 280,000 members account for about half the
doctors in the United States.

<HEAD>Government Cholesterol Program Faulted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's massive cholesterol education
program places too much emphasis on drug treatments that may do
more harm than good, a congressional panel was told today.
   But a federal official defended the National Cholesterol
Education Program, saying its guidelines will improve the health of
Americans and reduce the risk of heart attacks _ the nation's
leading killer.
   Thomas J. Moore, an investigative reporter whose article in the
September issue of The Atlantic magazine inflamed the controversy
over cholesterol monitoring, said he questions the value of what he
says is aggressive treatment recommended by the federal program.
   ``This is a very serious and expensive mistake in public
policy,'' he told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
health.
   The program's cholesterol guidelines recommend diet as the
treatment of choice, but says that failing that, patients with high
levels of cholesterol should seek treatment with drugs.
   An estimated 60 million Americans are believed to have high
blood cholesterol, a fatty substance that can clog arteries and
contribute to heart disease and heart attacks.
   Besides cholesterol, other factors that have been identified as
factors in heart disease are high blood pressure, obesity, smoking
and lack of exercise.
   Moore said he agrees with advice in the program's guidelines
that Americans should have their cholesterol levels checked and
make their diets healthier by eating less fat, fewer calories and
more fiber.
   He also said there is evidence that high cholesterol levels in
middle-aged men makes them more vulnerable to heart disease,
although he said the evidence of a link is much weaker for men over
65 and women of all ages who have no history of heart disease.
   ``But the central question is do we have effective medical
treatment that justifies putting 60 million people under long-term
care of their doctor,'' Moore said.
   He said the evidence he has found shows that diet does little to
lower cholesterol levels in the blood, and that while drug
treatments show more benefit, they have not demonstrated
significant ability to ward off fatal heart attacks.
   Moore said his complaint with the cholesterol program of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute is that with evidence that
diet isn't a significant factor in lowering cholesterol levels,
many who follow the program's guidelines will turn to drug
treatments that can have side effects including liver damage,
cataracts and digestive difficulties.
   ``When people become frustrated with diet, there will be an
expansion of drug treatment beyond what the architects of the
program expected,'' he said.
   Claude Lenfant, director of the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,
part of the National Institutes of Health, disputed Moore and said
clinical trials have shown that lowering cholesterol levels by diet
or drugs decreases the incidence of heart disease.
   ``Most people with high blood cholesterol will be able to lower
their levels with diet alone, and only a small minority will have
to resort to drugs,'' he said.
   Lenfant also noted that when the first Surgeon General's Report
on Smoking and Health was released in the mid 1960s, critics
started talking about the ``tobacco myth.''
   ``It has taken a long time for the ripples to subside and for
near unanimity to emerge that the risks of smoking are no myth,''
he said.
   ``Much the same is true for cholesterol. It may take a while
before there is universal agreement about cholesterol-lowering, but
cholesterol is also no myth.''

<TEXT>
   Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec
resigned today after failing to form a coalition government
acceptable to opposition groups, and he was replaced by the deputy
premier.
   Adamec quit after meeting with leaders of allied non-Communist
parties to discuss changes in the government, according to Bohuslav
Kucera, head of one of those parties, the Socialists.
   Kucera said in an interview that Adamec wanted a new person to
head the next coalition government and to reach the compromises
necessary to carry out reforms being sought by the tumultuous
pro-democracy movement.
   Several hours later, President Gustav Husak asked Deputy Premier
Marian Calfa to replace Adamec, the state news agency CTK reported.
   Calfa, who was promoted to the deputy premiership from minister
without portfolio on Sunday, participated in most of Adamec's talks
with the opposition on forming a new government to resolve
Czechoslovakia's political crisis.
   Calfa, 43, studied at Prague's Charles University Law Faculty.
He had served as minister without portfolio since April 1988. It
was not immediately known how his promotion would affect the talks
with the opposition.
   Adamec had negotiated with opposition leaders in recent weeks
and on Sunday introduced a new 21-member Cabinet that included only
five non-Communists and left Communists in control of key
ministries.
   The opposition demanded more power for non-Communists and
another new government by Dec. 10.
   Adamec threatened Wednesday to resign if the opposition did not
stop delivering him ``ultimatums.''
   His resignation leaves the 21-member Cabinet, which was the
subject of huge street protests, in charge of the nation.
   Earlier today, the opposition submitted Adamec with a list of
seven names for consideration in a new government.
   The Civic Forum opposition movement, and its Slovak counterpart,
Public Against Violence, have threatened a nationwide general
strike Dec. 11 if non-Communists are not given more power.
   A general strike Nov. 27 was observed by millions and led to
Adamec's promise to create a new government with non-Communists.
   The seven names given Adamec were not released, but opposition
sources said leading Slovak dissident Jan Carnogursky was on the
list. Carnogursky was released from prison just 12 days ago after
being held since August.
   The struggle over the composition of the government comes after
several weeks of whirlwind political changes.
   In the weeks since a harsh police crackdown Nov. 17 on a
peaceful demonstration in Prague, the energized pro-democracy
movement has forced the Communists to relinquish their 41-year
monopoly on power and to reverse 21 years of hard-line policy on
the failed Prague Spring reforms of 1968.
   Hard-line leaders tied to the crackdown after 1968 have been
sacked, except Husak, whose resignation the opposition has demanded.
   The opposition today denied it had intentionally put Adamec
under pressure to change the Cabinet.
   ``The crisis was caused by the current government, not by us,''
the opposition said in a statement. ``We are not trying to force
our demands through, and we are not trying to force anybody to
accept them in a hurry or under pressure.''
   In addition to Adamec, Communist Party leader Karel Urbanek and
several other members of the ruling Politburo were at today's
meeting.
   The shape of the new Cabinet was expected to hinge on the
outcome of the negotiations and on resolution of internal debates
within the opposition and other groups.
   Adamec said in his Wednesday television address that it was
difficult to get professionals the opposition wants in the
government to join such a Cabinet. The public mood ``changes from
day to day and hour to hour,'' he said.
   He said he would have no choice but to quit if the new Cabinet
failed towin public confidence and the leadership crisis were not
resolved.
   The announcement was an obvious appeal to citizens to trust him
to lead reforms that have ended the Communists' guaranteed monopoly
on power in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany.

   President Bush praised savings and loan
regulator M. Danny Wall in a letter released Thursday, but a
prominent Republican senator criticized the administration for not
defending Wall who announced his resignation Monday under fire.
   While Bush saluted Wall for ``unselfish recognition'' that he
could best help the industry by quitting, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah,
the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, accused the
administration of ``not having any guts'' and failing to support
the regulator.
   Wall was a focus of six weeks of hearings by the House Banking
Committee, which was investigating his handling of the failure of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif. Lincoln is
expected to be the nation's biggest thrift failure at a cost to
taxpayers of $2 billion.
   ``I am disappointed'' in the administration's dealing with Wall,
Garn said in an interview with the Deseret News in Salt Lake City,
Utah. ``If it had been their nominee, their appointment, they
would'' have supported Wall, who earlier served 12 years as the
senator's top aide, he said.
   Garn said, ``Dan was a Reagan appointee and they certainly in no
way came to his defense.''
   Bush, in a ``Dear Danny'' letter dated Wednesday, commended Wall
for hard work as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision and
for his ``unselfish recognition that the job of revitalizing the
industry demands the complete and undistracted attention of the
agency's entire leadership and staff.''
   Calls for Wall's resignation had come from Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Banking Committee; several major newspapers
and citizens groups. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray was also
reported to be seeking his oustr, and Bush and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady failed to come to his defense in public.
   Wall took over as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
in July 1987. In August of this year, he became director of the
thrift office when the bank board was dismantled under S&amp;L bailout
legislation.
   He told a news conference he was resigning because continuing
the fight with the committee would distract the agency from
conducting its work. He is continuing to serve as thrift office
director for an unspecified transitional period.

   Leftist guerrillas renewed
their assault on the Salvadoran capital today, setting up positions
in at least seven neighborhoods and battling government soldiers.
   The rebels claimed they shot down a military helicopter, but the
government said it suffered a mechanical problem and crashed.
   A statement by the armed forces press office said columns of
rebels infiltrated the metropolitan area from the north, east and
west during the night, including the upper-class Escalon and San
Benito districts.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties, a military
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity for security
reasons.
   Planes and helicopter gunships flew over the city during the
night, dropping flares and strafing suspected rebel positions,
while troops on the ground opened up with automatic weapons fire.
   But the new outbreak was much smaller than the fighting that
began when guerrillas launched an urban offensive on Nov. 11 as
part of their decade-old struggle for power against a succession of
U.S.-backed governments.
   Fighting had subsided to a few scarce shots since Friday after
the rebels withdrew from an incursion in Escalon and San Benito.
   Also reported under attack were the working-class neighborhoods
of Aytuxtepeque, San Ramon and Soyapango, north and east of the
city, and the small town of Apopa, to the north, the military said.
   The military spokesman said a U.S.-made helicopter crashed
during the night because ``of mechanical failure,'' but the rebels'
clandestine Radio Venceremos claimed it was shot down by guerrilla
fire.
   In the broadcast, the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front also announced they were renewing their sabotage
campaign against electric power installations and other economic
targets.
   Rebel groups destroyed two city buses, and five private
automobiles were destroyed by guerrillas in Santa Ana, 25 miles
west of the capital, and a burlap bag factory in San Miguel, 85
miles east of San Salvador.
   The rebels also were reported to have dynamited a bridge on the
Litoral Highway near the city of Usulutan, 70 miles east of the
capital.
   In an unrelated development, the government allowed three U.S.
Episcopalian bishops to enter the country to check on several
Episcopalians who were imprisoned during the recent offensive by
leftist guerrillas.
   Bishops William Frey of the diocese of Colorado, David Reed of
Kentucky, and William Swing of California arrived Wednesday on a
commercial flight from Miami and went through immigration
proceedings with no problems.
   The first two had come on Tuesday and were told by immigration
authorities their visas were invalid. They were put on a flight
back to Miami, where they spent the night before making the second
attempt to enter.
   Frey said President Alfredo Cristiani sent a letter by telefax
apologizing for the previous day's problems.

   Communist Party members involved in prostitution
will be expelled from the party, according to new regulations
announced Thursday.
   The party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said
any party member who sells sexual favors, patronizes a prostitute
or forces or instigates others to do so will lose his or her party
membership.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the rules also stipulate
that any member who harbors a prostitute, shields related actions
or obstructs the investigation or punishment of a prostitution case
will receive punishment more severe than removal from party posts.
   Prostitution is one of the ``six evils'' that have become the
target of a nationwide anti-crime campaign. The others are
gambling, drugs, the selling of women and children, pornography and
superstition.
   The ``evils'' have been linked to the Western tendencies the
current hard-line leadership has sought to eradicate since
suppressing the pro-democracy movement in the spring.
   Prostitution is believed to be most prevalent in Canton and
other free-wheeling southern China cities and in other cities such
as Shanghai, where contacts with foreigners are on the increase.

<TEXT>
   China said Thursday the Cold War will continue as
long as a ``few countries'' _ apparently the United States and the
Soviet Union _ continue to try to influence events in other
countries.
   ``The practice of power politics will eventually jeopardize the
relaxation of the international situation and only lead to a
continued Cold War,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said at
a weekly news briefing.
   Jin was responding to a question on whether the Malta summit
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
signaled an end to the Cold War.
   ``The international situation is undergoing major changes at
present,'' Jin said. ``Hegemonism is finding its going tougher and
tougher. However, power politics hasn't entirely resigned itself
from the historical arena.''
   He added: ``In the international relations its still easy to see
attempts made to interfere in other's internal affairs by means of
one sort or another, violating the norms governing international
relations.''
   The Chinese government's only previous comment on the summit was
that it hoped the results ``will genuinely help relax and stabilize
the world situation and will not harm the interests of any third
party.''
   Asked which superpower was more responsible for prolonging the
Cold War, Jin said only: ``In this world of today there are very
few countries that are in a position to practice power politics. We
are against whomever practices power politics.''
   Through much of the 1970s and 1980s China claimed that Soviet
``hegemonism'' was the biggest threat to world peace. However,
Moscow and Beijing this year normalized relations after three
decades of animosity, while Beijing's relations with Washington
have plummeted following the military crackdown of the
pro-democracy movement this spring.
   China repeatedly has accused the United States of ``power
politics'' for imposing economic sanctions on China to protest the
Chinese government's harsh suppression of dissent.
   Jin on Thursday again blasted the United States for taking
measures to make it easier for Chinese students worried about
persecution at home to extend their stays in the United States.
   ``The sending of Chinese personnel to study abroad, their
management, and assignment upon their return are all China's
internal affairs in which no foreign government or parliament has
the right to interfere,'' Jin said.
   The U.S. action ``is bound to do serious damage to the Sino-U.S.
educational exchanges and the responsibility for it lies with the
U.S. side.''
   Jin said China had ``taken note'' of Bush's veto of a
congressional bill on the visa status of Chinese students, but
expressed regret that Bush had taken administrative actions similar
to those called for in the bill and said allegations that Chinese
students face persecution upon their return are ``utterly
groundless.''

attempt Dec. 1.
   The crocodile was a pet of Col. Adam Jimenez and had been placed
in the waterway just hours earlier as part of the camp's defense
against rebel forces, the news agency reported.

observed a minute of silence today after a man who said feminists
``spoiled my life'' stormed into the University of Montreal
engineering school and shot 14 women to death.
   The man, identified only as ``Marc,'' turned the gun on himself
after the worst massacre in Canadian history. Nine women and four
men were injured, and two were in critical condition. Most of the
victims were female engineering students.
   The killer, clutching a semi-automatic rifle and wearing
ammunition belts across his chest, stalked five floors of the
six-story building Wednesday evening and at one point ordered all
the men out of a crowded classroom, police said.
   ``You're all a bunch of feminists,'' he screamed before opening
fire on the young women who remained.
   The Montreal police department's public relations officer
arrived on the scene and found the body of his daughter, a student,
among the dead.
   ``I heard the gunman say: `I want the women,''' said student
Francois Bordeleau. ``It was a human hunt.''
   Police said the man left a three-page letter in which he blamed
women for his failures and said he was going to kill some in
revenge. It was signed only ``Marc,'' and was found on the gunman's
body.
   Police would not give the exact wording of the statement or
release a copy to reporters but they displayed the gunman's weapon
_ a .223-caliber semi-automatic rifle with bloody fingerprints on
the stock.
   Police director Andre Tessier told a news conference today that
the letter contained a passing reference to Canadian Forces Cpl.
Denis Lortie, who killed three people May 8, 1984, with a
submachine gun in the Quebec legislature. He said the letter was
dated Wednesday.
   Police investigator Jacques Duscheneau said the gunman
identified himself as a student but did not specify a school. He
said 35 to 37 shots were fired.
   Authorities also said the man carried a buck knife.
   ``All of Quebec is in mourning,'' Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa
told the provincial legislature today before it observed a minute
of silence.
   Bourassa declared a three-day period of official mourning during
which flags on all government buildings will fly at half-staff.
   Monique Gagnon-Tremblay, the Quebec minister who was responsible
for the status of women until October, called the killings an
isolated incident carried out by somebody who was ``obviously
disturbed.''
   Asked about possible new gun-control measures, Ms.
Gagnon-Tremblay, now immigration minister, said: ``Measures might
be good, but I don't think you can avoid the kind of thing that was
done yesterday.'' The rifle used in the shooting is illegal in
Canada.
   Police and witnesses said the gunman, believed to be in his 20s,
entered the school about 4:30 p.m. EST as the building was crowded
with students on the last day of classes before exams.
   He walked into the first-floor cafeteria and fatally shot three
women, Montreal Police director Claude St. Laurent said.
   He then went to the second floor and at about 5:20 p.m. walked
into a classroom containing 60 students, ordering the men into one
corner and the women into another, police said.
   He told the men to leave, then screamed in French before opening
fire on the women: ``You're all a bunch of feminists,'' St. Laurent
said. Six women died in the classroom.
   ``It was just like Rambo. He had at least two ammunition belts
across his chest,'' said engineering student Robert Leclerc, who
was in the classroom.
   Leclerc, 23, said about 15 women remained in the classroom while
the men stood in the corridor outside.
   ``He told them, `You're women, you're going to be engineers.
You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists!,''' Leclerc
said. ``My friend Nathalie said, `No, it's not true. We're not
feminists.' He fired into the group.''
   ``He came in quietly,'' said student Eric Chavarie. ``And he
told us to stop what we were doing. Everyone thought it was a joke.
   ``He was smiling at us. He was very calm.''
   ``Then he fired a shot, right by my ear.''
   A woman in an administration office was killed on the same floor.
   The gunman then climbed to the third floor, where he killed four
more women in the corridor, police said. He continued up to the
fourth and fifth floors, shooting and wounding men and women.
   Police say he then returned to the third floor and turned the
gun on himself.
   As word spread of the rampage, distraught, tearful parents came
to the university seeking their children. The university, which
sits on a hill overlooks the city, is the largest in
French-speaking Quebec, with about 50,000 students.
   Pierre Leclair, the Montreal police's head of public relations,
arrived and found his daughter, Maryse, dead on the floor,
according to university spokesman Richard Doin.
   A temporary morgue was set up inside.
   ``Who could have thought that something like this could happen
in a peaceful student world?'' said Ba Madou, 35, an engineering
student.

   Frances Bavier, the Emmy Award-winning
actress remembered by millions of TV viewers as the lovable Aunt
Bee on ``The Andy Griffith Show'' in the 1960s, has died at age 86.
   Miss Bavier died at home Wednesday, said Leslie Fletcher of
Smith and Buckner Funeral Home.
   She had been released Monday from a hospital, where she had been
treated for almost two weeks in the coronary care unit.
   Dick Linke, manager for Andy Griffith, who played Sheriff Andy
Taylor in the series, said Griffith wanted people to know that Miss
Bavier ``was a fine woman, a wonderful actress and most of all, a
brilliant character actress. Even though she was from New York
City, she played Aunt Bee so perfectly that everyone believed she
was Aunt Bee and from North Carolina.
   ``We who knew her and worked with her will always remember her.
We say goodbye with a great deal of sadness,'' said Linke.
   Actor-singer Jim Nabors, when notified of her death at his
Hawaii home, recalled that Miss Bavier ``was very, very good to me
when I first started out and I was totally inexperienced in the
business.''
   ``She was always one of my favorite people,'' said Nabors, who
played gas station attendant Gomer Pyle in the series. ``I am a
better person for having known her.''
   He said she taught him a lot about ``personal kindness,''
adding: ``During my free time she taught me about antique
shopping.''
   Miss Bavier, a New York City native who would have turned 87
this month, attended Columbia University and was a graduate of the
American Academy of the Arts.
   She had more than 20 years of stage experience, including stints
in vaudeville and on Broadway, where she appeared in such
productions as ``Kiss and Tell,'' ``Point of No Return'' and ``The
Lady Says No.''
   She became famous for her role in the popular show starring
Griffith as a North Carolina sheriff. She portrayed the devoted
aunt, who was known for her Southern cooking and who helped raise
the widower Taylor's son, Opie, portrayed by Ron Howard.
   She continued in the role in the short-lived series ``Mayberry
RFD.'' She won an Emmy for the role in 1967.
   ``The Andy Griffith Show'' was in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings
top 10 during its entire run, from October 1960 to September 1968,
culminating in a No. 1 ranking in its final season.
   ``Many episodes focused on her and she was essential to the
success of the show,'' said John Meroney, founder of the Andy
Griffith Show Appreciation Society. ``When she started on the show
she was 57 and had more experience going in than any of the other
cast members.
   ``She was the only one from a large city and the fact that she
could portray Aunt Bee showed the depth of her talent.''
   Although she was born in New York and lived in Hollywood during
her acting days, Miss Bavier, as Aunt Bee, often spoke of ``going
shopping in Siler City.''
   She had visited the mill town of 5,000 in 1963 while dieting at
Duke Medical Center. She retired here in 1972 when she left
Hollywood. She made a cameo appearance in the 1974 movie ``Benji.''
   ``I fell in love with North Carolina,'' she said in a 1981
interview. ``All the pretty roads and the trees. I, like a child,
came here looking for a fairyland.''
   It wasn't quite like the ficticious Mayberry _ fans continually
rang her door bell _ but she adjusted to her new home and never
left Siler City.
   ``Sometimes people just gawk and gape,'' she said in a 1972
interview, ``and sometimes they're utterly charming and sweet.''
   In the 1981 interview, she said: ``I know how people saw me as
Aunt Bee. I'm still a compassionate person. That's how I want them
to remember me.''
   During her recent hospital stay, Miss Bavier received many
cards, letters and flowers from fans.
   She had refused media requests for interviews for some time.

   President Bush, likening the U.S. war against
drugs to people's quest for freedom in Eastern Europe, today lauded
a poor black community that united to drive drug dealers out of a
public park.
   ``As with the new freedom in Eastern Europe, freedom from drugs
isn't something the government can give you,'' Bush said in remarks
prepared for an anti-drug rally at Winzer Park in his adopted
hometown.
   ``You've got to take a stand. You've got to take back the
streets,'' he urged.
   He lauded the tenants and community activists from the Acres
Homes War on Drugs Committee, who helped sweep drug dealers out of
Winzer Park last year and organized neighborhood crime-watches to
keep them out.
   He said that like those demanding freedom to travel and vote in
Eastern Europe, the Acres Homes residents ``have used `people
power' to fight for another kind of freedom: freedom from fear;
freedom from crime; freedom from drugs.''
   Bush said Acres Home was once ``the embodiment of the American
dream,'' the largest unincorporated black community in the South.
   ``But in recent years, the dream on Main Street has become the
nightmare on Elm Street, a twisted, backwards world where our
children and our playgrounds are taken away by an evil menace
called cocaine, often in broad daylight,'' he said.
   By 1987, 25 to 30 drug dealers were operating in Winzer Park,
and a circular drive was so clogged with cars of drug-buyers ``that
police called it `crack-in-the-box,''' Bush said.
   But since 1,000 community activists joined with police to drive
the dealers out on April 9, 1988, ``they haven't come back. And
they better not.'' He said the local residents had taken a stand
against ``evil.''
   ``Efforts like yours are a critical part of America's
battleplan'' against drugs, said Bush, who unveiled his $8 billion
strategy three months ago. He said parents, teachers and other
community leaders must teach children right from wrong and instill
a sense of personal accountability.
   ``Only you can cultivate character and a sense of value in our
kids. It is not a federal problem for which there is a simple
federal solution,'' he said. ``We can't do it by looking to the
government alone.''
   He named the Acres Home War On Drugs group as a recipient of one
of his Presidential Points of Light _ a daily honor highlighting
outstanding volunteers.
   Bush was attending a fund-raiser dinner in the Astrodome tonight
for Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, before journeying to Colorado and
Iowa on Friday.
   He will spend the night in Houston, his adoptive home, before
heading to Denver for another anti-drug rally and a campaign
luncheon for Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., a U.S. Senate candidate.
   Bush's national drug policy coordinator, William Bennett, also
visited Winzer Park recently.
   On Friday, Bush will take part in an anti-drug rally with
members of the Denver Broncos football team, then fly to Des Moines
to address a fund-raising dinner for Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa. Tauke
plans to run for the Senate seat of Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin.
   Bush's trip on behalf of domestic anti-drug efforts comes a day
after more violence rocked the drug-producing nation of Colombia. A
truck bomb exploded outside police headquarters in Bogota, killing
dozens and wounding hundreds during morning rush hour.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Colombia is
still being considered as a site for the February drug summit that
Bush will attend with the leaders of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia,
the chief drug-producing nations.
   However, he said, other sites outside of Colombia are also being
considered.
   ``Wherever we hold it, we will do so with the assurance that we
can provide security for the president,'' he told reporters.
   Speaking about another Latin American trouble spot, Fitzwater
said the Nicaraguan Contra rebels had ``no alternative'' but to
stay intact as a fighting force despite a regional peace accord
requiring them to disband Dec. 5.
   Fitzwater contended that Nicaragua's ruling Sandinista
government has not lived up to its commitments under the August
agreement to promote democratic reforms and encourage repatriation
of the Contras.

   The world's population is expected to grow by
about a billion people in each of the next three decades but won't
be increasing as rapidly as it has been, the Census Bureau said
Thursday.
   Currently at 5.2 billion people, the world's population is
expected to grow to 6.3 billion by the year 2000, 7.3 billion by
2010 and 8.3 billion by 2020.
   More than nine out of 10 new arrivals will be in developing
countries, the bureau said.
   Even with the addition of a billion people every 10 years the
planet's overall growth rate will fall to lower levels than at
present, the agency said.
   Worldwide population growth was 1.7 percent in the 1980s and is
expected to be 1.8 percent in the 1990s, then to fall to 1.4
percent between 2000 and 2010 and to 1.3 percent from 2010 to 2020.

   The Bush administration is voicing deep
skepticism about Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to repair the
Soviet Union's ailing economy, saying his ideas are simplistic and
``just far from the real world.''
   The gloomy assessment arises from Gorbachev's weekend talks with
President Bush during a two-day summit off the Mediterranean island
of Malta.
   A senior administration official, intimately acquainted with the
two leaders' discussions, said Gorbachev demonstrated he has ``less
than a realistic economic notion of how to deal with his economic
problems.''
   Referring to Gorbachev's ideas, the official said, ``They're
simplistic.''
   The official discussed the summit with a small group of
reporters at the White House under assurances of remaining
anonymous.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking with reporters
today aboard Air Force One as Bush flew to Houston, said, ``We
wouldn't use that word.''
   Fitzwater said that the Soviets do have ``a lack of knowledge
about how free enterprise systems work and how market economies
work. And that was reflected in the conversation'' between Bush and
Gorbachev at Malta.
   He said ``simplistic'' was ``not a very good word to use. But
there is going to be a problem in introducing free market economies
to these (Marxist) countries.''
   The Soviet Union is suffering from widespread shortages of food,
fuel and consumer goods despite Gorbachev's program of economic
reform, known as perestroika.
   The problems are expected to worsen during the bitter Soviet
winter, raising fears of civil unrest.
   ``A lot of his economic definitions and ideas and so on come out
of a kind of Marxist mold and they're just far from the real
world,'' the official said.
   In particular, the official mentioned Gorbachev's views on
converting the ruble to a hard currency, his lack of information
about the benefits of a central bank comparable to the U.S. Federal
Reserve and his ideas about long-term leasing of land and factories
to Soviet farmers and workers.
   ``The other side of it was, here is a man of great
self-confidence,'' the official said. ``There was no hint of
self-doubt given the immensity of the problems he faces, which he
acknowledges, but (he was) very, very self-assured.''
   Bush and Gorbachev held eight hours of talks in their first
superpower summit.
   The official said Gorbachev was ``more self-controlled'' than in
his five earlier summit meetings with President Reagan.
   ``Clearly he wanted to establish a relationship with the
president, and wanted this to be good,'' the official said.
   During the summit, Bush offered an array of economic concessions
to help Gorbachev deal with his economic problems.
   The president proposed completion of a U.S.-Soviet trade
agreement by June 1990, granting ``most favored nation'' status to
Moscow, giving it the lowest possible tariffs for its exports.
   The most favored nation status would be linked with the waiver
of a 1974 law that imposed trade sanctions against Moscow in
retaliation for restrictions on emigration by Soviet Jews.
   Bush also proposed giving Moscow observer status at a world
organization that sets international trading rules, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Until now, the United States had
strongly opposed Soviet participation.
   ``I think he needs a lot more sophistiction,'' the official said
about Gorbachev. ``One of the things that will help him get the
sophistication is something like observer status at GATT, so he can
have a look at how the world economy really works.
   ``I'm not sure where he wants to go with economic reforms,'' the
official added.
   While welcoming Bush's economic package, Gorbachev ``was not at
all in a posture of saying, `We want your help,''' the official
said.
   ``What they don't want is the notion that the United States is
going to come in to bail them out. We're not going to do it,
anyway.''
   On another subject, the official said Gorbachev suggested some
flexibility toward ethnic unrest in the Baltic states.
   The official said the Soviet leader said he was prepared ``to
look on all kinds of autonomy,'' but that he would ``draw the line
at independence.'' The official quoted Gorbachev as saying, ```We
need to look for new structures to meet new circumstances.'''
   The official added, ``He seemed quite open to experimentation.''

   A banner on the outskirts says,
``With Soviet Union Forever,'' but the people of this Bohemian
village want to sell their 20-foot statue of Josef Stalin for
Western currency.
   ``Everyone in town is with the revolution against the Communists
except one guy, and he's in the secret police,'' said butcher
Vaclav Jicha.
   ``Well, maybe 10 percent of Komarov opposes these changes, but
all of the rest are happy,'' said elementary school teacher, Jiri
Beran.
   Whatever the numbers, a glance outside Prague shows that the
students' November revolution is firmly implanted in smaller cities
and rural areas.
   In Plzen, an industrial city 50 miles west of Prague,
anti-Communist posters are less evident than in the capital. But
attitudes are clear. During last week's strike, even the fabled
Urquell Pilsener beer stopped flowing.
   ``No one hesitated when we asked them to stop,'' said Jan
Kylbergr, strike organizer at Prazdroj Brewery. Workers left even
before he got a chance to read his manifesto.
   ``We won't have to disband Communist groups here,'' added
Kylbergr, 27. ``They'll destroy themselves.''
   If any place in Czechoslovakia exemplifies the new mood, it is
Komarov, a village of 2,200 people about 30 miles southwest of
Prague.
   Komarov makes machine parts _ no one likes to be more specific _
and the factory put up an immense stone statue of Stalin in the
1950s. It's still there on the square, one of the last Stalin
monuments left in Europe.
   Reformers were about to smash it into gravel when a visiting
professor mentioned someone in Britain collected Stalin
memorabilia. Komarov townsfolk, in need of an old-age home, figured
Stalin might be of some use to them after all.
   That was a few days ago. The plan, in its earliest stages, has
not yet reached the proper channels for approval.
   At first glance, Komarov looks like a party town. Walls are
festooned with red stars, the odd hammer and sickle, and
standard-issue Marxist-Leninist poster art.
   A bulletin board announced a party youth march. And there was
Stalin's statue, identifying him as, ``The Greater Teacher of
Working People, Liberator of our Country.''
   Asked about it, Beran advised: ``Don't pay any attention to that
garbage. Look over there.'' He pointed to glass double doors to the
little shopping mall, plastered with leaflets from the opposition
Civic Forum.
   Inside, in a well-stocked store offering everything from bidets
to bicycles, saleswoman Iva Bartipanova explained how the pamphlets
got there.
   ``We didn't know anything about what was happening in Prague
until these things appeared on the doors,'' she said. ``During the
night, someone ripped them off. But then they appeared again.''
   When demonstrations began in Prague, volunteer taxi drivers took
students and actors from town to town to spread the word. They
found willing ears in Komarov.
   ``Anyone who lived through the 1968 invasion must support what
the Civic Forum is doing,'' Mrs. Bartipanova said. In 1968, she was
just bringing her infant son home from the hospital when she ran
into Soviet troops headquartered just up the road.
   Down a country road from Komarov, Josef Prochazka, 65, lives
alone on isolated farm the state decided to return to him last year
after keeping it for four decades. He knows all about the uprising.
   Prochazka could hardly believe it. Back in the 1950s, he watched
the Communist militia shoot two men who mocked the idea of
collective farms. He spent years in a forced labor camp because his
father would not join a collective. He suffered later when a nephew
defected.
   Now he makes a meager living sawing logs in the farm's small
mill, which the state still owns.
   Despite it all, he has swung right back into political
kibitzing, in Czechoslovakia's democratic tradition.
   ``The opposition is doing the wrong thing,'' he said. ``We need
two strong parties, the Peoples Party and the Socialists.''
   In sharp contrast to the immediate past, almost everyone was
happy to talk. Mothers pushing babies in prams carefully spelled
out their names. Young soldiers described their enthusiasm, and
their officers' misgivings.
   For Frantisek Sojka, a 85-year-old pensioner in a moth-eaten fur
hat, the biggest surprise of the revolution was seeing an American
reporter and English photographer wandering around loose.
   Sojka would just as soon keep the Stalin statue _ it is art, he
says, _ but he wants to see it accompanied by a monument to Tomas
Masaryk, Czechoslovakia's first president.

   The battleship USS Iowa, its No. 2 turret
still sealed after an April explosion that killed 47 sailors,
arrived today to cheers from the crew's family and friends after a
six-month deployment in the Mediterranean.
   The crew lined the rail, bundled in pea coats to protect against
cold, blustery winds, as the Iowa docked at its home port shortly
after 1 p.m.
   A cheer went up from more than 1,000 family members and friends
when the ship appeared on the horizon, then they waited patiently
for it to dock.
   Navy officials kept reporters about 500 yards away from the
crowd. During normal homecomings, the crew, families and media
representatives are free to mix after the ship ties up.
   ``We're doing this to protect the privacy of the crewmen and
their families,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a Navy spokesman.
   Adm. J.D. Williams, the 6th Fleet commander in the
Mediterranean, laid the groundwork for a festive welcome by telling
crew families in a letter, ``Pull out all the stops for the Iowa's
homecoming.''
   In contrast, the Iowa's return to Norfolk Naval Base four days
after the April 19 gun turret explosion was somber and silent.
   Then, the 1,500 crewmen in their white uniforms lined the
battleship's rails. Each crewman wore a black armband. As tugs
nudged the 887-foot warship was nudged toward the pier, the several
thousand people on shore stood silent.
   The Navy's controversial report on the explosion was released in
September while the Iowa was at sea. It found the blast most likely
was caused by a disgruntled gunner's mate who sabotaged the huge
gun and died in the explosion.
   That report is being challenged by many of the families of the
47 victims who believe the Navy is covering up equipment and
training failures aboard the World War II-era battleship.
   Congressional committees will hear testimony next week from Navy
officials and FBI experts. Navy investigators found that sabotage
was the only explanation for the explosion, but the FBI has
declined to endorse that conclusion because its tests and
investigation failed to duplicate the Navy's findings.

Aquino, despite her apparent success in quelling the latest coup
against her government.
   ``It appears that the immediate threat to Mrs. Aquino's
government has been removed, but it's troubling that some of the
rebel military elements (are) among the most professional and
proficient Philippine military,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley
told reporters outside the White House after a meeting with
President Bush.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the coup raises concerns about
U.S. aid for the Philippines, especially as the two nations enter
negotiations for the future of the major U.S. bases there.
   ``We're obviously concerned about what that money's going to be
spent on, what the government's going to be there,'' said Leahy.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said this was the best organized coup
to date. ``Our intelligence shows us if they keep stepping it up
grade by grade, she will be in deep trouble,'' he said.
   Simpson noted that Congress has been considering aid of up to
$1.6 billion, including benefits for Philippine war veterans, as
part of the price of renewing base leases.
   A senior adminstration official said Wedneday that despite
putting down the coup, Mrs. Aquino's political future appears
uncertain.
   ``She's been hurt, there's no question about it,'' said the
official, adding that Mrs. Aquino should ``take seriously what
happened.''
   Asked about those comments today, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``On the record, we would not speculate on'' Mrs.
Aquino's future. He acknowledged that the United States has
concerns about the situation and certain Philippine policies, ``but
that does not diminish the fact that we support her and her
government and we hope that they're successful.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said ``Mrs.
Aquino's government has shown incredible resilience in this
situation,'' and he restated ``our very strong support for her.''
   Setting a more optimistic tone than the senior official, Boucher
said pessimism surrounded a coup attempt in 1987, but that the
Phillipines rebounded rapidly and continued its economic growth.
   The United States now expects ``that the Philippine people can
pull together under President Aquino's leadership'' to achieve a
similar recovery from the latest unrest, he said.
   The official, briefing a small group of reporters Wednesday on
the condition that he not be identified further, apparently was
seeking to send a clear message to Mrs. Aquino's U.S.-backed
government to become more responsive to criticism within her
country.
   Mrs. Aquino's future may depend on her ability to ``eliminate
the sources of discontent,'' the official said.
   Uneasiness among the Philippine population in general, and
within the military in particular, is a sure sign of trouble ``and
as a political leader she has to deal with it,'' the official said.
   Asked if Mrs. Aquino could survive politically, the official
said: ``That's a tough one.''
   He spoke as the coup attempt _ the sixth since she took office
in 1986 _ seemed to be running out of steam. Rebel forces who had
fortified themselves in Manila's Makati business district returned
voluntarily to their barracks Thursday.
   However, it remained unclear whether the announcement marked the
end of the coup.
   At least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 wounded
since Friday.
   Earlier, U.S. officials praised as ``careful and effective'' a
Philippine evacuation that freed 280 Americans and other foreign
citizens from the Manila hotels where they had been trapped by
gunfire in the 7-day-old rebellion.
   ``We commend the Aquino government for organizing and carrying
out this operation,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler, applauding the ``careful and effective manner in which it
dealt with the situation in the Makati commercial district and the
efforts it took to safeguard American citizens and others who were
in the area.''
   The senior administration official said that, with U.S. military
help, Mrs. Aquino had appeared to survive ``an almost-successful
coup,'' correcting himself to say ``a serious attempted coup.''
   In any event, he said, ``I think that if she takes seriously
what happened and tries to eliminate the sources of discontent
which helped lead to the coup, it may come out'' all right for her.
   ``We really have to reassess what all this means.''
   Asked to elaborate, he said: ``We have to assess what this has
done and the American assistance in terms of the situation. People
will use the fact that she called on America against her.''
   President Bush heeded Mrs. Aquino's plea for help last Friday,
sending F-4 fighter jets from Clark Air Base screaming over two air
fields held by rebels, preventing the insurgents from using those
fields to launch additional attacks.
   The United States gave $650 million to the Aquino government
this year, the third largest foreign aid package, behind only
Israel and Egypt. The United States maintains two bases in the
Philippines, Clark and the sprawling Subic Bay naval base.
   U.S. leases on both bases expire in 1991, and the attempted coup
seriously complicates efforts to renegotiate those leases. For the
time being, lease talks have been put on hold.

<HEAD>Entertainer Asks Case Against NBC Be Upheld</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Wayne Newton has asked a
federal appeals court to uphold the record $5.3 million damage
award in his suit against NBC News over reports that he was linked
to organized crime figures.
   Newton's attorney has filed a 120-page brief with the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, saying that overturning
the award would have ``dire consequences to the public.''
   Lawyer Morton Galane said in the brief filed Nov. 17 that if the
verdict is overturned, ``victims of malicious defamation by the
mass media will have no effective remedy and the media will not be
deterred from disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods.
   ``The cost of litigating against a media giant like NBC will
often exceed any compensatory award the victim could hope to
receive.''
   If upheld, Newton's award would be the largest on record arising
from a news report.
   Newton sued the network in 1981, claiming that a series of
broadcasts in 1980 defamed him. The broadcasts, entitled ``Wayne
Newton and the Law,'' linked Newton to alleged crime figures and
centered on his purchase of the Aladdin Hotel here.
   The series was presented by NBC reporter Brian Ross and producer
Ira Silverman.
   A jury awarded Newton $19.2 million in damages in 1986.
   The following year, U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker cut the
award to $5.3 million _ $5 million of that is punitive damages _
but upheld the jury's libel findings.
   NBC appealed to the 9th Circuit after Newton announced he would
accept the reduced award.

<HEAD>Israel Agrees to Peace Meeting on Eve of Uprising Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of the Palestinian uprising's second
anniversary, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir accepted a U.S. call for
talks by Egyptian, American and Israeli officials as a step toward
peace, a spokesman said Thursday.
   Shamir called a meeting Friday of the four top Cabinet ministers
to approve sending Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to the talks,
Israel TV reported.
   The ``forum of four'' includes Shamir and Arens of the
right-wing Likud bloc and well as two left-leaning Labor Party
members, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
   The moves came as the Israeli army clamped an indefinite curfew
on 750,000 Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip and was expected
to limit movement by about 1 million people in the West Bank to
block protests linked to Friday's anniversary.
   In the West Bank, reinforced army units patrolled Ramallah and
Bethlehem, and police increased patrols in Arab east Jerusalem. In
Gaza, soldiers announced through loudspeakers that the seaside
strip was under curfew.
   PLO-backed uprising leaders ordered a three-day work stoppage
starting Thursday throughout the occupied lands to mark the
anniversary of the ``intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ in
addition to a general strike Saturday.
   Palestinian protests were subdued by rain Thursday, but police
detained three people in a stone-throwing protest near Jerusalem's
Old City, and four protesters were reported shot and wounded in the
West Bank and Gaza.
   Israel radio broadcast a police alert urging citizens to watch
out for suspicious objects after two small bombs were found
Thursday atop bottled gas canisters in a neighborhood of Jerusalem.
Both were defused by police.
   Police reported that a grenade was thrown at a house in the
Jewish quarter of the Old City but did not explode.
   Also in Gaza, the army demolished three houses in the Khan Yunis
refugee camp overnight, saying the residents were jailed on
suspicion of killing alleged pro-Israeli informers and belonging to
uprising shock committees.
   In Tel Aviv, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron told a seminar
on the uprising that he would like to see ``harsher punishment for
parents of stone-throwers ... and much harsher punishment for
(suspects) with repeated offenses.''
   The army says 40,000 Palestinians have been imprisoned since the
start of the uprising and 9,142 are currently in jail.
   At least 626 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire in
the revolt, and 155 other Palestinians were slain by fellow Arabs
as suspected collaborators. Forty-three Israelis also have been
killed.
   Shomron said the army could serve as ``an instrument of the
political level'' but could not end the Palestinian rebellion by
itself.
   ``There is no military solution to the uprising (but)...we can
prevent the violence of the uprising from dictating political
moves,'' he said.
   In Jerusalem, Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir gave the prime
minister's response to the proposed meeting in Washington after
U.S. officials announced Egypt had agreed to the meeting.
   ``If the Americans believe it is a full response and want to see
where we go from here, we'll go in January to the meeting of the
three foreign ministers,'' Ahimeir said in an interview.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged the three-way
meeting to pave the way for Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo on
Israel's initiative for elections in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Ahimeir said that Israel still had not seen the full text of
Egypt's reply and hoped the Washington meeting could answer
questions about Cairo's stance.
   ``It will be important to determine what Egypt's intentions are,
and the ability to advance the peace initiative as Israel has
proposed, to hold elections,'' he said.
   Under Israel's plan, adopted in May, Palestinians would be
elected to negotiate with Israel on a period of interim self-rule
for the occupied lands.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has criticized the
proposal since it is designed to bypass the PLO and fails to
guarantee eventual Palestinian independence, the main aim of the
uprising.
   Israel views the PLO as a terrorist organization and accepted
the Baker plan on condition the group would be excluded from the
peace process.
   Israeli officials said Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens
worked out a ``positive stand'' to Baker's plan after receiving
U.S. assurances that Egypt's reply was its own and not that of the
PLO.
   ``The U.S. made it clear to Egypt that it could not accept that
Egypt would act as a postman for the PLO, and Egypt made it very
clear that it is not acting as such and would not do so,'' a senior
Israeli diplomat said.
   Shamir's coalition partners in the left-leaning Labor party
praised Egypt's reply, and Vice Premier and Labor leader Shimon
Peres declared: ``If it's positive, it's enough.''

<HEAD>Lithuanian Parliament Votes to End Communist Party Supremacy</HEAD>

   The Communist Party suffered a major defeat in the
Soviet Union on Thursday when the republic of Lithuania abolished
the constitutional guarantee of Communist supremacy and legalized a
multiparty system.
   Similar action has been taken in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and East Germany as part of the wave of political upheaval and
reform that is diminishing the role of the Communist Part in those
nations.
   Lithuania's parliament defied Moscow with a resounding 243-1
vote to end the party's total dominance of all political and social
organizations within the Baltic republic. Another 98 deputies
abstained or stayed away from the session.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has resolutely opposed a
multiparty system for the Soviet Union. The challenge to the
Communist power structure comes at a time when he faces a crippled
economy, growing nationalism and demands from conservative
communists for more order.
   The move in Lithuania, one of 15 Soviet republics, thrilled
other Soviet activists who are organizing a two-hour general strike
Monday to call for similar action by the national parliament.
   ``Wonderfully done!'' said activist Yelena Bonner on hearing of
the Lithuanian action. ``You cannot restrain the movement today.
This is a good example for the other republics,'' said Bonner, wife
of Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov, one of a group of
national parliamentarians calling for the general strike.
   Estonia's parliament voted Wednesday to delay voting on a
similar switch to a multiparty system until next week, to allow
time for public discussion. Armenia's parliament was forced into a
postponement Wednesday for lack of a quorum.
   The Lithuanian action rescinds Article 6 of the republic's
constitution, which says the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is
the ``leading and guiding force of Soviet society, the nucleus of
its political system, government and social organizations,''
according to Tass.
   In practice, it meant that Communists dominated every sphere of
life and every organization in the country. Until Gorbachev's
reforms began to loosen the iron custom, ambitious Soviets were
forced to join the party and follow its orders to rise in any
profession.
   Similar articles are found in the national constitution of the
Soviet Union and those of the other 14 republics.
   Word of the call for a general strike to demand a parliamentary
vote on the national version of Article 6 began to percolate
through Soviet society Thursday, after it was reported by Western
radio stations.
   On Thursday, the newspaper Izvestia published the first mention
of the strike call in a generally circulated Soviet publication.
The article was highly critical of the strike call but nevertheless
spread the word to the newspaper's 9.5 million readers nationwide.
   It accompanied a letter from parliamentarian Yuri Chernichenko
saying he supported the call for a vote on the Communist Party's
supremacy, but not the plan for a strike. Chernichenko's name was
among the supporters listed on announcements of the strike.
   Sakharov and his fellow deputies called the strike to pressure
the national Congress of People's Deputies into voting to rescind
Article 6 and on draft laws on land, property and business
enterprises. The Congress starts its second semi-annual session
Tuesday.
   In Latvia, the People's Front is scheduled to meet with factory
and labor leaders to respond to the call for a general strike.
Janis Krumins, deputy editor of the Latvian People's Front
newspaper Atmoda, said the Latvians are likely to strongly support
the strike, but for just 15 minutes, not two hours.
   Eduardas Potashinskas, an activist who watched a live TV feed of
the parliamentary session in the capital of Vilnius, said the
Supreme Soviet directed that a new law governing the actions of
political parties in the republic be prepared in the next 45 days.
   Potashinkas said Lithuanian Party First Secretary Algirdas
Brazauskas and other party leaders voted for the change. He said
that in debate Tuesday, Brazauskas had termed the decision
``difficult, but correct.''
   A first try Tuesday fell nine votes short of the two-thirds
majority of 228 necessary for approval of a constitutional
amendment because so many members were absent or abstaining.
   The Lithuanian Communist Party is due for a showdown with the
Kremlin on Dec. 19, when its party congress is to vote on a plan to
separate from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and on a
program that includes support for Lithuanian independence.
Gorbachev has spoken out sharply against both moves, but Lithuanian
Communist leaders say they must change or face certain defeat in
upcoming elections.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh visited
Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple, on Thursday in a major
initiative by his government to end the lingering secessionist
campaign by Sikh militants.
   It was the first visit by a prime minister to the Golden Temple
in more than five years, since shortly after a bloody army raid
that led to the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   ``Too much bloodshed has taken place,'' the Hindu prime minister
told about 20,000 Sikhs inside the 14th century shrine. ``The time
has come to win the hearts of the people.''
   In New Delhi, a judge formally dropped charges against four
Sikhs accused of participating in the Oct. 31, 1984, assassination
of Mrs. Gandhi.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed by two Sikh bodyguards angered
by the army attack she ordered on the Golden Temple in June 1984 to
drive out Sikh militants using it as a base.
   One assassin was shot and killed by security men. The other was
convicted along with an accomplice and both were hanged in January.
   Conspiracy charges were later filed against four other Sikhs.
Last week, the government said it would withdraw the charges in a
conciliatory move toward the Sikh community.
   ``One does wonder why the move was not made earlier,'' said
Judge Jaspal Singh, himself a Sikh, in ordering the charges dropped.
   All Sikhs and many Hindus use the name Singh, which means lion.
   Two of the Sikhs accused of conspiracy were elected to
Parliament in last month's general elections, in which V.P. Singh
and his National Front coalition prevented Rajiv Gandhi, Mrs.
Gandhi's son and successor, from returning to power.
   Singh was sworn in as prime minister Saturday and said solving
the Sikh dispute in the northern state of Punjab would be one of
his top priorities.
   On Wednesday, he made an effort to heal rifts between Hindus and
Moslems by by appointing a Moslem, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, to the
key job of minister of home affairs. Religious riots this fall left
at least 300 people dead.
   His visit to the Golden Temple was noticeable for the almost
total lack of bodyguards, who surrounded Gandhi during his public
appearances. Singh traveled in an open jeep from Amritsar's Raja
Sansi airport to the temple after refusing to sit in a bulletproof
sedan.
   ``Your love to me is my security,'' the prime minister told the
gathering at the gold-domed temple. ``I have not come here for any
political or governmental purposes. I have come to perform prayers
in the holy shrine so that peace and normalcy can be restored.''
   Mrs. Gandhi was the last prime minister to visit the temple. She
came a week after the army raid.
   The Sikh secessionist campaign was launched by a small group of
radicals in 1982 and exacerbated by the raid on the Golden Temple
and by anti-Sikh riots in northern India after Mrs. Gandhi's
assassination.
   At least 1,200 people died in the army raid, and the temple
suffered heavy damage, turning even moderate Sikhs against the
government. At least 3,000 Sikhs were killed in ensuing riots.
   Sikhs, easily identifiable by the their long hair, flowing
beards and colorful turbans, form only 2 percent of India's 880
million people but are a majority in Punjab. Sikh militants say
their community is discriminated against by the Hindus, who make up
about 80 percent of the population.
   Officials say at least 7,500 people have been killed in Punjab
since the Sikh campaign began.
   Punjab Governor Sidhartha Shankar Ray resigned Thursday and was
replaced by Nirmal Kumar Mukarji, an appointee of the new
government. The state is ruled by the federal government in the
absence of an elected legislative assembly, and the governor is the
top administrator.

<HEAD>Federal Election Panel Probing Keating's Political Gifts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission said Thursday
it is investigating political contributions by Charles H. Keating
Jr., the main figure in the nation's largest savings and loan
failure, who arranged for $1.3 million in donations to the
campaigns and causes of five senators.
   The investigation initially is focusing on contributions by
Keating, family members and corporate associates to Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who requested the probe, the FEC said.
   But the investigation could spread to four Democratic senators
who _ along with McCain _ intervened with banking regulators on
Keating's behalf if the FEC feels that ``there are other problems
or other violations under the Federal Electon Campaign Act,''
commission spokesman Scott Moxley said.
   The meetings with regulators began in 1987 when Keating's
Lincoln Savings and Loan was collapsing.
   The Senate ethics committee is now conducting a fact-finding
inquiry into the case, which has enormous political consequences
for McCain, a rising GOP star, and for the Democrats: Majority Whip
Alan Cranston of California, Banking Committee Chairman Donald W.
Riegle Jr. of Michigan, Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman
John Glenn of Ohio and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona. All deny
wrongdoing.
   Meanwhile, federal regulators asked a judge Thursday to dismiss
a suit against them by Keating who contends his S&amp;L was being
operated soundly calls the government takeover ``capricious and
arbitrary.''
   Keating, whose bank failure could cost taxpayers a record $2
billion or more to protect depositors, also contributed to other
senators and House members, and those donations also could come
under FEC scrutiny. Keating, once asked if his financial support of
politicians would influence them to take up his causes replied: ``I
want to say in the most forceful way I can, I certainly hope so.''
   Moxley, the FEC spokesman, said the commission _ which
administers the nation's campaign finance laws _ began its
investigation after receiving a letter from McCain Oct. 30 seeking
the probe.
   A spokesmen for Keating was not immediately available for
comment.
   Contributions to the five senators, made during the mid-1980s,
came from Keating, his immediate family members and from officials
of his companies that included Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif.; its
parent Phoenix-based company, American Continental Corp., and other
subsidiaries of American Continental. Spouses of these corporate
officials also gave donations.
   Federal law limits contributions to campaigns to $1,000 per
individual for each election. Many of the contributions from
Keating and his associates were given on the same day in separate
$1,000 donations.
   For instance, when The Associated Press requested an FEC check
of campaign contributions made on a particular day, the agency's
computer found nearly three dozen separate $1,000 donations from
Keating associates or family members to then-Sen. Chic Hecht,
R-Nev. Keating himself was not on the list on the day checked, Nov.
18, 1988.
   The law prohibits anyone from making a donation on behalf of
someone else. For instance, Keating could not have his corporate
officers give $1,000 each under their names and reimburse them
later to skirt the donation limit.
   Moxley said, however, the law is unclear on whether someone
could ask his associates to contribute without reimbursing them.
   McCain said in his request to the FEC that representatives of
his 1982 and 1984 House campaigns, and his Senate campaign of 1986,
``assure me that on their face those contributions comply with
federal election law.''
   ``If these contributions resulted from illegal activities of the
corporations who employed these contributors, it is not evident in
the committees' records or on publicly available information,'' he
said.
   But McCain expressed concern that any ``potentially illegal
action by corporations and contributors be reviewed as rapidly as
possible.''
   McCain received $112,000 in campaign contributions from Keating
and associates, and promised to ``promptly refund'' any money given
improperly. He previously announced he was reimbursing American
Continental $13,433 for flights he and his family took aboard
Keating's corporate plane to and from the Bahamas in 1984-86.
   DeConcini received $48,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign but
announced he was returning the money.
   Cranston, the No. 2 Senate Democrat as majority whip, received
$39,000 in campaign money. He solicited from Keating $850,000 for
three voter education projects in California and $85,000 for the
California Democratic Party. The FEC has jurisdiction only over
contributions for federal campaigns.
   Glenn received $34,000 in direct contributions and a political
action committee associated with him was given $200,000.
   Riegle received $76,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign but
announced he was returning the money.

   Reeling from voters' overwhelming
rejection of three tax increases, the governor is proposing $98
million in budget cuts that could signal major changes for his
economically strapped state.
   ``It's difficult to get people to look at the complexity of an
issue like this,'' Democratic Gov. George Sinner said Wednesday.
``I tried hard. But I don't think I achieved the message. I really
don't.''
   He spent weeks campaigning on behalf of higher state income,
sales and gasoline taxes, a year after he easily won re-election
against a Republican opponent who ran on an anti-tax platform.
   But North Dakotans thronged to the polls Tuesday to defeat those
tax measures as well as five other issues proposing mandatory seat
belts, video gambling, sex education for schools, legislative
pensions and the reorganization of state government.
   ``People were in the mood to vote no, and once they started
voting no, they just kept going,'' said former state House Speaker
Tish Kelly.
   Turnout was unofficially counted at 253,429, or 53 percent of
the state's estimated voting population, a record turnout for a
special election.
   Of the three defeated tax measures, a proposal to raise the
state sales tax from 5 percent to 6 percent fared best. It lost by
53-47 percent. Increases in income and gasoline taxes were rejected
by 60-40 percent.
   Sinner's proposed cuts, which are subject to legislative
approval, would hit public schools hardest. Elementary and
secondary education would lose $34 million, according to state
Office of Management and Budget documents.
   The state's higher education system faces a possible $24 million
cut and state human services a $21 million reduction.
   North Dakota's general fund budget totals $1.12 billion during
the current two-year budgeting period, which ends June 30, 1991.
   Sinner may call lawmakers into special session early next year,
but he plans to consult legislative leaders before making his
decision.
   The state is celebrating its centennial year, but its past
decade has been bittersweet. The economy relies heavily on farming
and energy production and has suffered from drought and low prices
for oil and wheat. North Dakota farmers got more than $400 million
in drought aid last year.
   The latest campaign was the governor's second in three years to
raise taxes. In 1987, he took a leading role in persuading voters
to endorse an income tax increase, which was approved while the
Legislature was in session.
   But Wednesday, he said his latest effort may have been a waste.
   ``It's easy to see why this budget is so extremely tight, and
yet the people never really seem to perceive that,'' Sinner said.
   He contended tax increases are needed to maintain existing
services. Sinner, who has talked of running for a third term,
shrugged off questions about the political damage from his tax
campaign.
   ``It's way too early for me to think about that,'' said Sinner,
whose four-year term ends at the end of 1992. He added, ``I didn't
take the job because I wanted to perpetuate myself in office.''
   Opponents of the tax increases said the governor has failed to
pare spending enough, and that farmers and businesses cannot afford
a heavier tax burden.
   ``Governor Sinner needs to put more of his energy into economic
development,'' said Kent French, a Bismarck businessman who led
opposition to the taxes. ``Instead, he's spent his time trying to
raise taxes.''
   Legislators sensed anger in the vote.
   ``There seems to be a bitterness,'' said Democratic state Sen.
Geraldine Meyer. ``North Dakota people are short of money and
hurting, and to me (the election) was almost a striking out.''
   Voters have had it with taxes and government, said Sen. Bryce
Streibel, a Republican.
   ``Government is no longer a servant of the people,'' he said.
``It's become a monster.''

<HEAD>Taxpayers Pay Insurance for Lawmakers Considering Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A safe driving record and living in a
low-crime area are two ways to get lower auto insurance rates, but
being elected to the Legislature might be more effective.
   Pennsylvania and California are the only two states that
reimburse legislators for the lease and insurance on their cars.
   A vote on a compromise insurance reform bill is expected next
week in the Pennsylvania Legislature, where the Senate in June
voted down a proposal that would have cut rates by about 25 percent.
   Philadelphia's rates are among the highest in the nation, fueled
in part, The Philadelphia Inquirer said, by legislation that was
drafted by lobbyists for the insurance industry and trial lawyers,
who benefit from personal-injury lawsuits.
   Two state senators are not reimbursed for car insurance. One
doesn't have a driver's license or car and the other is Sen. James
C. Greenwood. All 48 other senators have the taxpayers cover most
of their insurance premiums.
   ``I think to the extent that every time my insurance goes up I
feel the pain too _ that makes me like the people I represent,''
Greenwood said.
   Sen. Chakka Fattah, who paid $184 to insure his 1989 Lincoln
Continental last year, said it is unfair to say that legislators
don't care about the insurance issue because their car insurance is
paid by the state.
   ``That's just like saying because we have jobs we wouldn't be
concerned about unemployment,'' Fattah said.
   State Insurance Commissioner Constance B. Foster said the
state's reimbursement policy could make it more difficult for
legislators to adopt reform legislation.
   ``If a person is isolated from the problem, it's very easy to
minimize it _ even if they have teen-age sons and daughters,'' she
said. Foster was one of the key proponents of the insurance-reform
bill defeated by the Senate in June.
   Foster has the use of a state-owned and -insured 1989 Buick
Century.
   State records show that many Pennsylvania lawmakers lease
late-model Cadillacs, Lincolns and other luxury cars. The insurance
on those cars runs from several hundred dollars a year for rural
legislators to thousands for Philadelphia lawmakers.
   Under House rules, representatives can be reimbursed for up to
100 percent for their car insurance. Senators can be reimbursed up
to 95 percent.
   Many legislators said that such a benefit is normal in business
and that it helps them perform their jobs better. They also
disputed that the practice insulates them from the high cost of
insurance because they still have to pay for insurance on personal
and family cars.

<TEXT>
   A jailed East German official accused of
embezzling will fight extradition back to the Communist country,
saying the growing turmoil makes a fair trial unlikely, his lawyer
said Thursday.
   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski fled the country after prosecutors
disclosed he was operating a weapons ring selling arms to countries
in South America, Africa and the Middle East.
   The growing scandal already has led to one suicide and the
arrest of Schalck-Golodkowski's deputy for allegedly taking $110
million in West German marks out of East Germany.
   Such allegations are particularly embarrassing for East Germany,
which for years has claimed that it needs more Western currency to
support its economy.
   Schalck-Golodkowski had supervised the various government-owned
businesses that brought in the badly needed Western money.
   He disappeared while on an official visit to West Germany on
Saturday, quickly becoming the target of an international manhunt
that added even more damaging publicity to the deeply troubled
nation.
   East Germany's Christian Democrats, a small party that recently
broke with the Communists, said the allegations made the country
look like a ``banana republic.''
   Schalck-Golodkowski turned himself in to West Berlin authorities
Wednesday night and immediately promised to repay $31 million to
East Germany from Swiss bank accounts. That is only a small part of
what East Germany's official news media claim he embezzled.
   In an interview with a West Berlin TV station, the former
official's lawyer, Peter Danckert, said his client would resist
being returned to East Germany for trial.
   Danckert said that ``the uncertainty that we have seen
everywhere in East Berlin'' made a fair trial unlikely. The
national frenzy aimed at punishing past corruption has led Lutheran
Church officials to warn that calls for ``revenge against the
guilty'' were sparking widespread fears.
   Danckert said Schalck-Golodkowski would appeal to the West
German Supreme Court if necessary to avoid an extradition.
   On Thursday, West Berlin prosecutor Dietrich Schultz said
Schalck-Golodkowski would stay in jail indefinitely and that the
former East German official ``feels that he is not guilty.''
   The West Berlin prosecutor added that an extradition to East
Germany is still possible based on the Communist nation's arrest
warrant for embezzlement. The charge carries a maximum of 10 years
in prison.
   However, Schultz said his office had not turned over anyone to
East Germany for prosecution in 20 years and that it was possible
he would be set free.
   Schultz said that Schalck-Golodkowski could be tried on the
allegations in West Germany, if the East Germans can prove he
committed the crimes.
   On Wednesday, the official East German news agency ADN reported
the suicide of an official caught two days earlier trying to leave
a government building with two suitcases stuffed with East German
and West German money. ADN did not give his name, but said he was
connected to the Schalck-Golodkowski case.
   Manfred Seidel, who served as Schalck-Golodkowski's deputy, was
arrested on suspicion of having smuggled $110 million in West
Germank marks out of the country.

   Tom Stanesa is as comfortable flying
cross-country as most people are driving to work. He should be;
he's racked up more than 1 million miles in the air on business
trips for Caterpillar Inc.
   ``Flying planes was all I ever wanted to do,'' he said.
   He started out to be a pilot, but an accident during Navy flight
training affected his vision. So he's flown as a passenger, and
logged every run.
   About a year after he joined Peoria-based Caterpillar in 1967,
Stanesa took a 140-mile business flight to St. Louis and jotted the
mileage and a few flight details in a notebook.
   Two decades later, Stanesa's weathered notebook is crammed with
37 single-spaced pages of notes documenting 1,403 flights for the
world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment.
   His total so far is 1,008,752 miles.
   ``I know there are others in the million-mile category'' at the
company, said Caterpillar spokesman Mark Polzin. ``But Tom's
probably the only one who can prove it.''
   His work has taken him to 26 countries on 42 different types of
airplanes. He has traveled on 29 domestic airlines and 30 foreign
carriers, and made 62 Atlantic crossings.
   Bad weather and risky landings have not soured Stanesa on
flying, but he does have a complaint.
   ``It's not very fun to fly anymore,'' he said. ``There's so much
lost luggage and incredible damage being done to luggage. And the
airports are extremely overcrowded.''
   No, Stanesa hasn't taken gotten any free flights _ Caterpillar
collects his frequent flier bonuses.

   ``Lobzilla,'' a gigantic lobster spared a
date with a boiling pot after a wave of public sympathy, was flown
from North Carolina to Maine by an animal rights group Thursday to
be returned to the ocean.
   But the group didn't get to make the release. State marine
patrol agents confiscated the illegally oversized crustacean _ and
then released it themselves.
   The 21-pound lobster almost got cooked and served Nov. 30 in
Shucker's Oyster Bar in Charlotte, N.C. But after some publicity
from an animal rights group, manager Kurt Larkins decided to give
Lobzilla to the group, gratis.
   Larkins said the lobster measured more than 3 feet when
stretched out.
   ``Oh, he's so beautiful,'' said Cam MacQueen, of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, who accompanied the lobster which
traveled in an icebox labeled: ``Eat beans, not beings.''
   ``He is truly majestic, incredible to look at,'' said Ms.
MacQueen, who estimated his age at 150 years.
   Carol L. Burnett of the Washington-based animal rights group
said the group picked Maine for Lobzilla's release because state
law does not permit the taking of lobsters whose shells measure
more than 5 inches, in order to preserve large ones for breeding.
   Because that law also prohibits possession of oversize lobsters,
marine patrol agents confiscated Lobzilla on arrival, then went
ahead and released it.

   A thousand people gathered at two
sites today to remember the ``day of infamy'' that killed more than
2,000 servicemen and brought the United States into World War II.
   Ceremonies on the 48th anniversary of the Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor included a moment of silence and a 21-gun
salute.
   Simultaneous ceremonies were held by the U.S. Navy aboard the
aboard the USS Arizona Memorial, where about 100 guests attended,
and onshore at the Arizona Memorial Visitors Center.
   The shore ceremony, open to the public and sponsored by the
National Park Service, which runs the center, attracted about 900
people.
   Adm. Huntington Hardisty, commander of U.S. forces in the
Pacific, spoke at the Navy ceremony, alluding to the new peace
initiatives between the East and West blocs.
   ``As the opportunity arises to reduce tensions and the potential
for open conflict, we should seize it and support it,'' he said.
But he said Americans also ``must continue to speak out'' against
perceived threats to the nation's security.
   The speaker at the public ceremony was retired Rear Adm. Victor
Dybdal, who was a gunnery officer aboard the USS Helm during the
attack.
   In all, 19 ships were sunk or damaged and some 2,300 men died on
the day President Franklin Roosevelt said would ``live in infamy.''
The sunken Arizona is the final resting place for 1,102 Navy men
and Marines.
   The memorial spans the hull of the Ariozona battleship, which
still flies the U.S. flag. It is the only Navy ship not in
commission that is allowed to do so.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Long-Range Missiles, Rocket With Satellite Capability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iraq claimed Thursday it has test-fired
two long-range missiles and successfully launched a rocket able to
carry satellites into space, developments that could affect the
Middle East's military balance.
   Hussein Kamel, minister of industry and military
industrialization, said the three-stage rocket was launched Tuesday
from the Al-Anbar space research center 50 miles west of Baghdad.
   He also claimed in a statement broadcast by state-run Baghdad
Radio that Iraq has test-fired two surface-to-surface missiles with
a range of 1,240 miles.
   That is enough to reach Cairo to the west, Athens and Istanbul
to the northwest, all of Iran to the east, and the southern Soviet
Union to the north.
   Iraq's other main foes, Israel and Syria, are already within
range of missiles reported in Iraq's armory.
   If the Iraqi claims are true, the developments will heighten
Soviet and U.S. fears of a new arms race in the Middle East.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he had heard
reports Iraq had developed intercontinental ballistic missile but
knew nothing about their validity.
   Kamel gave no details of the surface-to-surface missiles and did
not say when the test-firings occurred.
   The heaviest missile the Iraqis are believed to have developed
is the al-Hussain, with a range of about 560 miles.
   There was no independent confirmation of Tuesday's reported
rocket launch, but Iraqi TV showed what it said was footage of it.
   Kamel said the rocket weighed 48 tons, bigger than anything the
Iraqis were believed to possess.
   The U.S. Polaris nuclear missile weighs only 13 tons.
   ``It's a big leap,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a Middle East
analyst with London's International Institute for Strategic
Studies. ``The Iraqis are known to have been working on some big
projects and we must assume this was one of them.''
   ``What we must anticipate now, if this report proves to be
correct, is how Iraq's neighbors will react.''
   Israeli officials refused comment and there was no immediate
reaction from other Middle East capitals.
   Kamel said the rocket will be used to launch a satellite for
scientific research at an unspecified date.
   He said the launch was the first stage of an Iraqi space
research program and called it ``the springboard for further
achievements in space technology.''
   But it also would enable Baghdad to spy on Israel and Iraq's
main rivals in the region, Syria and Iran.
   Iraq fought an eight-year war with Iran that was halted by a
cease-fire last year. Syria, Iraq's archrival in the Arab world,
was allied with Iran during the war.
   Iraq is the only Arab country to claim the capability of
launching satellites. Israel is the only Middle East country known
to have satellite capability.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has been driving to develop an
aerospace industry for some time and has spent billions of dollars
on missile development.
   The most ambitious part of the program was development of a
two-stage ballistic missile with Egypt and Argentina based on
Argentina's Condor missile.
   Intelligence sources have said Iraq is negotiating with Brazil's
space agency and the French to help it acquire a surveillance
satellite.
   Israel launched the Ofek-1 satellite Sept. 19, 1988. It said
Ofek-1 was designed for scientific research, but Arab governments
fear it will be used as a spy satellite.
   Israel has said it is working on an Ofek-2 satellite. The
official Soviet news agency Tass reported the Israelis launched a
ballistic missile Sept. 14.
   The Israelis denied it, but Western intelligence believes the
reported firing could have been an abortive effort to launch Ofek-2.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite militias fought in Moslem
west Beirut on Thursday during a general strike to protest alleged
attempts by Michel Aoun, the rebellious Christian general, to
partition Lebanon.
   Police said no casualty reports were available on the battle
between the the pro-Iranian Hezbollah and Amal, a more moderate
militia supported by Syria.
   ``Luckily this clash broke out on a day of general strike, which
decreases casualties among civilians,'' said a police spokesman,
whose name was withheld in keeping with regulations.
   Amal and Hezbollah fighters started shooting at midday in the
densely populated Basta and Khandaq al-Ghamiq districts of the
Moslem sector, which is patrolled by Syrian soldiers, the spokesman
reported.
   He said tension was ``gradually spreading'' despite efforts by
the Syrians to contain the trouble. The Syrian command sent
hundreds of its soldiers to districts bordering Basta and Khandaq
al-Ghamiq.
   Automatic weapons fire and the thud of exploding
rocket-propelled grenades could be heard across west Beirut, and
radio stations interrupted regular programming with reports on the
violence.
   The police spokesman said the confrontation ``could spread
quickly.''
   Fighting broke out in Beirut two days after Hezbollah drove Amal
from the western part of the Syrian-occupied Bekaa Valley in east
Beirut, destroying the five major Amal bases in Sohmor, Yohmor and
Mashgara villages.
   Police gave casualties in the Bekaa confrontation as 17
combatants killed _ 16 from Amal and one from Hezbollah _ and 42
wounded.
   The two factions have fought since May 1987 for supremacy among
the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect. Police say 552
people have been killed and 1,532 wounded.
   Leaders of the National Front alliance of pro-Syrian leftist and
Moslem groups called the strike in Moslem areas to ``denounce
attempts to partition the nation.''
   President Elias Hrawi, a Christian like Aoun, presided over a
meeting of his government at an army barracks in Syrian-policed
east Lebanon, and issued a statement saying ``several decisions
were adopted regarding ways of ending the partition scheme.'' No
details were given.
   The government urged ``all concerned to join the unifying policy
of the legal authority to abort the partition scheme.''
   Moderate Christian leaders have joined Moslems in supporting
Hrawi, who was elected by Parliament on Nov. 23 with a mandate to
implement a peace agreement designed to end the 14-year-old civil
war.
   Aoun rejected Hrawi's election and opposes the peace accord
because it does not include a timetable for withdrawal of Syria's
40,000 troops from Lebanon. He commands 20,000 Christian troops
from a bunker beneath the presidential palace in the Christian
suburb of Baabda, and refuses to leave.
   Syria has ringed the 310-square-mile Christian enclave east and
north of Beirut with tanks, artillery and thousands of soldiers.
Hrawi has given mediators two weeks to convince Aoun to leave the
palace peacefully.

   A jury today found a Hispanic police officer guilty
of manslaughter in the deaths of two black men that led to three
days of inner-city rioting.
   Miami officer William Lozano, 31, was charged with two counts of
manslaughter in the Jan. 16 deaths Clement Lloyd,
23, and his passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24. The two counts carry a
total maximum sentence of 45 years.
   Lozof motorcyclist ano showed no emotion as the verdicts were read
and the
jurors were polled. Later, he issued a statement promising to
appeal and saying: ``I was not given a fair trial from the
beginning. There was a lot of evidence denied and quashed.''
   Prosecutors say Lozano fired unnecessarily as Lloyd's motorcycle
fled a squad car after a traffic violation. Lloyd died of gunshot
wounds while Blanchard died of injuries suffered in the resulting
crash.
   Lozano said he fired in self-defense when the motorcyclist tried
to run him down.
   The January riot left one man dead and 11 others wounded with
gunshots. Thirteen buildings were set afire, others were looted,
and 372 persons were arrested.
   Announcement of the verdic the verdict.''
   The sequestered jury began deliberations Wednesday after seven
weeks of testimony and hearings. They worked for about six hours
Wednesday and reconvened this morning, deliberating for an
additional 1{ hours before notifing the judge they were finished.
   Circuit Judge Joseph Farina did not formally endorse the verdict
today, but defense attorney Ray Black said that was just a
technicality. The judge ordered the parties to return Jan. 24, but
did not indicate whether sentencing would take place at that time.
Lozano remained free on $10,000 bond.
   He faces up to 30 years in the death of Lloyd, where the charge
was manslaughter using a firearm, and 15 years in the death of
Blanchard, where the charge was manslaughter not using a firearm.
   Lozano's wife left the court in tears.
   Officials had prepared for violence if the Colombian-born Lozano
had been acquitted, but also stressed their hopes for calm in the
hours before the verdict was announced.
   ``We're really concerned about the media coverage and
implications that this is something that would be almost expected
from a community,'' Mayor Xavier Suarez said today on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   ``I think the community is ready to accept the verdict. All the
leaders have called for tranquility and serenity in all the
communities in our city. I'm very pleased to see that approach
being taken.''
   The Dade County Community Relations Board called a last-minute
conference with social workers before they were sent out speak with
residents, said assistant director Lloyd Major.
   Forty-five police cars had formed a perimeter around Overtown,
Liberty City and black sections of Coconut Grove, and officers have
been issued riot equipment as a precautionary measure.
   ``We don't want to have storm troopers out there and have 400
policemen running around the city,'' police spokesman David Rivero
said Wednesday. ``We have just our normal patrols out there in the
city right now, but as soon as anything starts, we are going to go
in and arrest people.''
   Anderson, who is black, on Wednesday walked the streets of
Overtown, the neighborhood where the shooting occurred.
   ``Will we have justice this time?'' one resident asked the chief.
   ``I think so,'' Anderson replied, patting the man on the
shoulder.
   The rumors of a verdict had grown so strong Wednesday afternoon
that downtown workers reportedly left their jobs early, and Dade
County's Chief Circuit Judge Gerald Wetherington went on the air to
assure the public that the jury had reached no decision.

   An appeals court on Thursday upheld the acquittal of
director Martin Scorsese, who was charged with contempt of religion
for his film ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
   Scorsese and Biennale Festival director Paolo Portoghesi were
cleared of violating Italian laws on obscenity and blasphemy in the
showing of the movie at the Venice Film Festival.
   Judges initially decided to take no action against Scorsese or
the festival organizer. But an appeals court in Rome ruled the case
should be considered by a Venice criminal court, which found
Scorsese and Portoghesi innocent.
   The Rome court's upholding of the acquittal is final, because
the Supreme Court has declined to accept the case.
   Protesters who prompted the criminal case in fall 1988 said the
movie was sacrilegious, particularly a scene in which Jesus
hallucinates on the cross about abandoning his role as redeemer,
making love to Mary Magdalene and raising a family with her.

   A judge ruled that an
air-conditioner repairman who believes his father is doo-wop singer
Dion DiMucci cannot bring a paternity lawsuit.
   Dion Ambrogio, 32, is 10 years too late in suing, Palm Beach
Circuit Judge Walter Colbath said Wednesday, citing a state law
that bars a paternity action once the child reaches age 22.
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Ambrogio. ``Dion wantign contributions made
on a particular day, the agency's
computer found nearly three dozen separate $1,000 donations from
Keating associates or family members to then-Sen. Chic Hecht,
R-Nev. Keating himself was not on the list on the day checked, Nov.
18, 1988.
   The law prohibits anyone from making a donation on behalf of
someone else. For instance, Keating could not have his corporate
officers give $1,000 each under their names and reimburse them
later to skirt the donation limit.
   Moxley said, however, the law is unclear on whether someone
could ask his associates to contribute without reimbursing them.
   McCain said in his request to the FEC that representatives of
his 1982 and 1984 House campaigns, and his Senate campaign of 1986,
``assure me that on their face those contributions comply with
federal election law.''
   ``If these contributions resulted from illegal activities of the
corporations who employed these contributors, it is not evident in
the committees' records or on publicly available information,'' he
said.
   But McCain expressed concern that any ``potentially illegal
action by corporations and contributors be reviewed as rapidly as
possible.''
   McCain received $112,000 in campaign contributions from Keating
and associates, and promised to ``promptly refund'' any money given
improperly. He previously announced he was reimbursing American
Continental $13,433 for flights he and his family took aboard
Keating's corporate plane to and from the Bahamas in 1984-86.
   DeConcini received $48,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign but
announced he was returning the money.
   Cranston, the No. 2 Senate Democrat as majority whip, received
$39,000 in campaign money. He solicited from Keating $850,000 for
three voter education projects in California and $85,000 for the
California Democratic Party. The FEC has jurisdiction only over
contributions for federal campaigns.
   Glenn received $34,000 in direct contributions and a political
action committee associated with him was given $200,000.
   Riegle received $76,100 for his 1988 re-election campaign but
announced he was returning the money.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Bill Expanding Federal Damage Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislation Thursday
giving the attorney general the authority to settle claims of up to
$50,000 for injuries or damage caused by FBI agents executing their
duties.
   The measure amends a 1936 statute that had limited such damage
payments to $500.
   It also expands the settlement authority to cover other federal
law enforcement agencies, including the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the
U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Prisons.
   The expanded settlement authority is intended to cover incidents
ranging from broken walls and doors to personal injury or deaths
resulting from properly executed law enforcement activities by the
FBI and other federal agencies.
   If negligence were involved, the victims already had a right to
sue the government for much larger damages than $500 under the
Federal Tort Claims Act.
   Bush also signed legislation allowing disabled Vietnam veterans
to receive Agent Orange settlement payments without jeopardizing
their eligibility for other federal disability or welfare aid.
   That measure excludes the Agent Orange payments from
consideration of the veterans' assets for means-tested federal
programs.
   Veterans who suffered health problems linked to the herbicide
sprayed as a defoliant during the Vietnam War can receive up to
$12,800 from a $180 million Agent Orange settlement fund.
   Bush signed a raft of other measures before departing the White
House on a two-day trip to Houston, Denver and Des Moines.
   Among them were:
   _A new four-year authorization for ACTION, the 25-year-old
domestic version of the Peace Corps. It includes a $15 increase in
the $75-a-month stipend for the 2,600 volunteers, who have not a
raise since 1976. The stipend will also go from $90 to $95 in
fiscal 1991. It also boosts the hourly stipend for foster
grandparents to $2.35 from $2.20.
   _Authorization levels in 1990 of $1.2 billion for the U.S.
Customs Service, $39 million for the International Trade Commission
and $21 million for the U.S. Trade Representative.
   _Allowing the Department of Agriculture to donate to charities
or public agencies confiscated meat and poultry, so long as the
products are wholesome and unadulterated, such as meat seized as
mislabeled.
   _Revising the terms under which the National Consumer
Cooperative Bank must begin repaying $184 million in loans from the
Treasury at the end of next year.
   _Designation of 1990 as the ``International Year of Bible
Reading,'' as proposed by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., and 57 other
sponsors.
   _Creating a new post of president of the $20 million James
Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation, which will award
fellowships of up to $12,000 a year to study the Constitution.
   _Appointment of Robert James Woolsey Jr., the U.S. ambassador to
conventional arms talks in Europe, and physics educator Homer
Alfred Neal to the board of regents of the Smithsonian Institution.
   _Permission for the U.S. Information Agency to distribute within
the United States a film, ``A Tribute to Mickey Leland,'' honoring
the efforts of the late Houston congressman to alleviate world
hunger. Leland was killed Aug. 7 in the crash of a mercy mission
flight in Ethiopia.
   _A green light for the Agriculture Department to pay food stamp
benefits in cash to families participating in the Minnesota Family
Investment Plan, a welfare experiment.
   _Renaming a post office on Hylan Boulevard in New York's Staten
Island as the Walter Edward Grady U.S. Post Office Building in
memory of a letter carrier who worked the same route in Staten
Island for 25 years.

<HEAD>Major Defense Cutback Announced in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk
announced a major defense cutback Thursday, cutting mandatory
military service in half and promising to close some military units
and facilities.
   He also suggested that some career military men and employees of
the national arms manufacturing company may lose their jobs.
   The announcement came two weeks after South Africa completed the
withdrawal of its troops from Namibia, where they had fought a bush
war against pro-independence guerrillas since 1966. A year ago,
South Africa signed a treaty that cleared the way for Namibia's
independence and also halted South African involvement in the civil
war in Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.
   De Klerk's announcement marked the second time in 10 days he has
taken action counter to standing policies of the security
establishment that held strong influence under his predecessor,
P.W. Botha. On Nov. 28, de Klerk scrapped a nationwide security
network that was denounced as an unaccountable shadow government.
   When the Namibian and South African-Angolan wars ended, Defense
Force chiefs and the Defense Minsiter Magnus Malan had said there
would be no cutbacks or service reductions because the government
still had to defend its borders against guerrilla infiltration from
surrounding countries.
   Last week, Malan reversed himself, saying it was no longer
necessary for South African forces to stage cross-border raids or
support anti-government groups in neighboring countries. The
military units de Klerk has suggested eliminating may be those
involved in such clandestine actions. He said details would be
given next year.
   Zach de Beer, a leader of the anti-apartheid Democratic Party,
said de Klerk's action was ``an indication that the relationship
between ourselves and our neighbors in southern Africa have
improved and we look forward to a more peaceful time.''
   ``The Conservative Party is ... concerned that the state
president's unilateral and over-hasty decision will be detrimental
to state security,'' said Koos van der Merwe, defense spokesman for
the largest white opposition party. He warned against creation of a
``peace pscyhosis,'' when, he said, the outlawed African National
Congress was continuing its guerrilla actions.
   Van der Merwe suggested that rather than reducing the strength
of the Defense Force, the extra soldiers be assigned to the
undermanned police force, and that black, Indian and mixed-race men
also be subject to conscription. Now, only white men can be
conscripted. Military service for other races is voluntary.
   De Beer, as well as several business organizations, said the
reduction in military service would help the economy by slowing the
``brain drain'' of young men who leave the country rather than
serve, diminish disruption of careers and allow more educated men
to enter the workforce earlier.
   De Klerk, opening a new headquarters for the state arms
manufacturing corporation, indicated that conscripts already in the
military would have their terms of service shortened, new draftees
would serve one year instead of two, and the number of recalls to
temporary service would be reduced.
   The End Conscription Campaign, a restricted organization that
wants young men to be given a choice between military and community
service, said, ``This reduction does not remove the huge dilemma
facing conscripts who still have to choose whether to serve in an
apartheid army.''
   In September, 780 white men vowed not to perform military
service, the largest defiance ever of conscription laws.
   Draft resisters face prison terms of up to six years, or 1{
times the amount of unfulfilled service. Three men are serving
six-year terms.
   The government does not release information on the manpower of
the armed forces. However, at any given time in recent years, there
have been as estimated 68,000 conscripts on active duty and about
325,000 men in the reserves out of the roughly 2.4 million white
males of all ages in South Africa.
   The president said efforts would be made to find new jobs for
career military personnel and employees of Armscor, the
government-owned weapons company, who might lose their jobs as part
of the cutback.

   A senior State Department official said
Thursday that Nicaragua's government has embarked on ``a clear
pattern of abuses'' designed to intimidate opposition political
activists and voters before February's national elections.
   John Bolton, assistant secretary of state for international
organization affairs, said the political opposition has grown to
represent a real threat to continued Sandinista power in Nicaragua,
and the government has responded with ``tactics designed to
discredit, confuse and intimidate the opposition and its
supporters.''
   Bolton also released a letter he had sent this week to Elliot
Richardson, the chief U.N. observer of Nicaragua's elections,
detailing more than a dozen attacks and threats aimed at opposition
political figures and their supporters in recent weeks.
   Bolton said the incidents would make it difficult for
Richardson, a former attorney general, to certify following the
Feb. 25 voting that the elections were free and fair in accordance
with a regional peace agreement signed by the leftist Sandinista
regime and its four Central American neighbors.
   In a speech at the State Department, Bolton said that Virgilio
Godoy, the vice presidential candidate of the opposition coalition
UNO, had been stopped by soldiers on Nov. 26 in the town of
Pantasma. When Godoy complained that two of his supporters had been
beaten and detained by the army, the soldiers responded that the
opposition had been throwing rocks and then threatened to fire on
the candidate and his party.
   That and other incidents ``present a clear pattern of abuses
designed to interfere with the open, free and fair electoral
process that the Sandinistas are pledged to uphold,'' Bolton said.
   Bolton, in a letter to Richardson, also cited the Nicaraguan
government's refusal to provide visas for a 20-member U.S.
congressional election observer group appointed by President Bush.
   In rejecting the visa requests last week, Nicaragua said the
United States could not claim objectivity because it was providing
$9 million in support to the electoral process to enhance UNO's
chances and was continuing to funnel support to the anti-Sandinista
Contra rebels, many of whom have re-infiltrated into Nicaragua.
   Bolton dismissed those arguments, noting that ``humanitarian''
aid to the rebels is permitted in the regional peace accord and
that Nicaraguan law permits outside financial aid to political
parties.

<HEAD>68 Human Rights Monitors Killed in Last Year, Group Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty-eight human rights monitors were killed
worldwide in the last year, double the number in the previous 12
months, an international human rights monitoring organization said
Thursday.
   Human Rights Watch said 63 of the killings were in countries
usually considered to be democratic, but added in its annual report
that ``the danger in democratic countries ... is, of course, not an
argument in favor of dictatorships of the right or of the left.''
   The organization said it had little or no information on
persecutions of human rights monitors in Albania, Iran, Iraq, North
Korea, Romania or Saudi Arabia because it is virtually impossible
for citizens in those countries to monitor government activities.
   Nevertheless, the report said, ``the dangers that attend efforts
to monitor and defend human rights in some `democracies' should
give pause to those who have celebrated the democratic tide that
has swept across the world in the 1980s.''
   ``At least in a number of Latin American and East Asian
countries, the advent of electoral democracy has not meant great
advances in respect for human rights.''
   ``It is when a certain degree of openness prevails but when the
rule of law has not been established that the perils are
greatest,'' the organization said.
   In Colombia, where the group said a history of human rights
violations has been exacerbated by the violence associated with the
drug trade, 24 human rights monitors were killed, more than in any
other country.
   Brazil was second with 14 and ``many of the cases reflect the
intense struggle over land distribution in rural areas,'' Human
Rights Watch said.
   The 345-page report discussed 1,200 cases of persecution of
human rights monitors in 72 countries, including arrest,
imprisonment and torture of people who gather and disseminate
information on their own governments' human rights abuses.
   Aryeh Neier, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said
Czechoslovakia, where a new reformist government has come to power,
was second only to South Africa in the total number of cases. But
he said many of those listed had been released about two weeks
before the report was issued.
   ``Not all the people we care about in Czechoslovakia have yet
been released, so there is a way to go,'' Neier added.
   South Africa takes up 36 pages in the report and Czechoslovakia
23.
   The report devoted only six pages to China, but said some of the
thousands arrested after the June 3-4 disturbances in Tiananmen
Square were known to have been signers of statements and petitions
on human rights issues.
   In addition to the 68 killings, 10 more human rights monitors
``disappeared'' after being taken into custody, the organization
said.
   Human Rights Watch is made up of five regional committees:
Africa Watch, Americas Watch, Asia Watch, Helsinki Watch and Middle
East Watch. It is headquartered in New York.

   Reported cases of a rare blood disorder linked to
the nutritional supplement L-tryptophan have risen to 730, federal
officials said Thursday.
   The painful disorder, known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome,
has been reported in 48 states, the Centers for Disease Control
said. Earlier this week, the case count stood at 720.
   The CDC has reported a link between the syndrome and
L-tryptophan, an amino acid taken in pill form to treat
sleeplessness, depression and other ailments. The Food and Drug
Administration has issued a nationwide recall of L-tryptophan
tablets, capsules and caplets.
   One death has been linked to the substance, and three others are
being investigated.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's

   A doctor accused of soliciting college
students to have sex with his wife in a phony research project was
found dead Thursday in an apparent suicide, police said.
   Police were called to the home of Rodney Thorp Wood, 60, at
about 1 p.m., Southampton village police Sgt. Lars King said. King
said Wood was found dead in an apparent suicide but did not reveal
other information.
   Wood and his wife, Nancy Steffen Wood, 44, were arrested in
September in Eugene, Ore., after allegedly conducting a phony
research project that included a sex tour of West Coast college
campuses.
   Each pleaded guilty to prostitution Oct. 23 and was fined $2,500.
   The couple allegedly visited the University of Oregon campus,
telling male students they were ``evaluating the sexual potential
of the mature female'' and would pay participants for taking part
in research sessions, police said.
   Mrs. Wood distributed ``letters of introduction'' to young men
on campus, Gilliam said. Men were promised $10, Eugene police Sgt.
Rick Gilliam said.
   Police were tipped by two students, and an officer, posing as a
student, contacted the couple at their hotel. They were charged
Sept. 16.

   Police captured two suspected leftist

   Authorities declined to provide any details except to confirm
that the two suspects were arrested in Husum, near this port city

   An officer at the Kiel police headquarters said the suspects
were a man and a woman. He said two police helicopters were
involved in the capture.
   Herrhausen, the powerful chairman of Deutsche Bank, was killed
one week ago when his armored car was blown up by a bomb in Bad
Homburg, near Frankfurt.
   The leftist Red Army Faction claimed responsibility for the
attack.
   Police launched a massive hunt for the suspects and offered a
reward of up to $2.2 million. Police have named three suspects in
Herrhausen's murder.

   Strict new financial standards effective
Thursday will force more than a third of the nation's savings
institutions to shrink or shut down if they can't raise new capital.
   Only 1,800 of 2,900 S&amp;Ls have enough capital to satisfy the
requirement, prompting industry analysts to nickname the deadline
``Pearl Harbor Day'' because it coincides with the 48th anniversary
of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
   ``It's a good analogy, except in one respect,'' said economist
Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
``This wasn't a sneak attack. (S&amp;Ls) should have known this was
coming a long time ago.''
   The new rules were required under S&amp;L bailout legislation
enacted Aug. 9 and are considered the cornerstone reform of the
bill. The Office of Thrift Supervision published them Nov. 6.
   Advocates of forcing S&amp;L owners to back their lending with more
of their own money say the measure will encourage institutions to
avoid risky investments that could run up big losses for the
government deposit insurance fund.
   Of the 1,100 institutions falling short of the standard, about
300 are already insolvent and due to be transferred to the
Resolution Trust Corp. for liquidation.
   Of the 800 remaining, about 270 likely will be able to shrink or
raise capital on their own and about 230 likely won't be able to do
it before mandatory growth restrictions take effect on Jan. 1,
1991, M. Danny Wall, director of the thrift office, said Thursday.
   ``Then 300 in the middle are candidates for the matchmaker
program, blind dates, arranged marriages, however you want to put
it,'' Wall told the Association of Government Accountants Thursday
in a reference to a thrift office program aimed at matching weak
S&amp;Ls with merger partners.
   Private analysts, however, are skeptical about the prospects for
capital-deficient institutions.
   ``There are very good reasons to question whether the guys in
the middle will survive, certainly in their present form,'' Litan
said. ```The most likely strategy will be shrinkage because they
will not be successful in attracting new capital. There's a pall
hanging over the entire thrift industry, which makes investors
nervous.''
   Anticipating the rules, S&amp;Ls have been shrinking, shedding a
record $15.2 billion in assets in September and $13.3 billion in
August, according to the latest report available.
   Litan and another economist, Paul Getman of the Wefa Group in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said another provision in the thrift bill
requiring S&amp;Ls to concentrate 70 percent of their assets on housing
loans, up from 60 percent, is discouraging investors and virtually
forcing the shrinkage.
   ``Congress is saying to thrifts, `Put all your eggs in one
basket,' and that basket is looking real shaky,'' Getman said,
noting weakening real estate markets in the Northeast on top of
already soft markets in the Southwest.
   ``This is setting up the industry for what will be a knockout
punch in the early 1990s,'' he said, predicting that the Southeast
will be the next region with real estate problems.
   ``The right analogy to draw for these 800 thrifts is they are
like prisoners on death row. They have another 15 years to live,''
Getman said.

<HEAD>Government Says Monument Demonstrations Cannot Be Tolerated</HEAD>

   The Solidarity-led government said
Thursday it won't tolerate more demonstrations at monument to Lenin
where anti-Soviet protesters trying to destroy the statue have
twice clashed with police.
   Protesters chanting ``Soviets go home!'' hurled paint, gasoline
and explosives at the monument and fueled the fire with park
benches in a demonstration that lasted until midnight Wednesday.
   Police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the
demonstrators after they marched to a militia headquarters, pelted
officers with stones and tossed Molotov cocktails, the official PAP
news agency reported.
   Twenty people were injured _ 13 of them police, PAP said. Damage
was estimated at $6,000, including a jewelry store looted after its
windows were smashed.
   Another demonstration turned violent Nov. 29 at the statue to
the founder of the Soviet state that dominates a square in the
Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta, built in the 1950s as a model socialist
industrial city.
   ``The problem of the location of the monument should be decided
by inhabitants of this district of Krakow in legal forums,'' the
government statement said.
   ``Vandalism and hooliganism are something else. Such activities
cannot be tolerated,'' it continued. ``The forces of order, acting
in accordance with the law, will be forced to take firmer steps in
order to prevent such dangerous excesses.''
   The youthful demonstrators, gathered by a radical group known as
Movement for an Alternative Society, have been an embarrassment for
the government of Prime Minister Taduesz Mazowiecki, formed of
former opposition forces who now must maintain relations with the
Soviet Union.
   The police action Nov. 29 was apparently the first large-scale
use of force against demonstrators since Solidarity took over the
government in August.
   The Solidarity committee for the southern Poland region has
adopted a resolution asking local authorities to remove the Lenin
monument to prevent further disturbances, PAP reported Thursday.
   ``Our resolution is not dictated by political reasons but by
concern over security and order in the city,'' it said, according
to PAP.
   ``If a decision manifesting the will of society is not made
immediately, stability will be threatened and district and
municipal authorities will be to blame,'' it said.
   Not freely elected, the people's councils that form local
governments have yet not been subject to the reform sweeping
through the central government and are still dominated by communist
party members.
   Stanislaw Suchonski, a member of the Krakow council, told PAP
two possible solutions were being considered: ``Either to prevent
such further events or, having heard the opinion of Nowa Huta
inhabitants, to move the monument to a different place.''
   Edward Nowak, a Solidarity parliament deputy serving as a
mediator in the monument dispute, said Thursday that only removal
of the statue can end the demonstrations, PAP reported.

   The Soviet Union has bought 410,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery in 1989-90,
the seventh year of a long-term grain supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said shipments are scheduled in
January and February.
   The wheat was sold under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, which provides subsidies to exporters selling U.S.
commodities to designated foreign markets.
   Dickerson said only 14,200 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation of 1.5 million tons announced May 2.
   It was the second U.S. wheat sale since the seventh year of the
long-term grain agreement began Oct. 1, although more than 10.3
million tons of corn have been sold for 1989-90 delivery, along
with soybeans and soybean meal. A sale of 215,000 tons was reported
on Monday.
   The pact runs through Dec. 31, 1990, and a new agreement is
currently being negotiated.
   In 1988-89, the sixth year of the current agreement, the Soviet
Union bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3
million tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of
wheat. The 410,000 tons are equal to more than 15 million bushels
worth around $57 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $16.81 per
ton, or about 46 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Dickerson said the wheat was sold by Alfred C. Toepfer
International Inc., 150,000 tons; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 135,000;
Cargill Inc., 50,000; Continental Grain Co., 25,000; J. Aron &amp; Co.,
25,000; and Mitsubishi International Corp., 25,000.
   Since EEP began in 1985, more than $2.6 billion in subsidies
have been paid to exporters to ship a variety of commodities to
overseas customers. As of Nov. 30, sales totaled 87.2 million tons
of grain, including 64.4 million tons of wheat.
   The Soviet Union, the largest EEP beneficiary, has bought more
than 17.5 million tons of wheat. China is second at 13.2 million
tons of wheat, plus 185 head of cattle.

   Opening night of the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater's season became a tribute in words and dance to the founder
of the troupe.
   The program was changed to include only dances choreographed by
Ailey and ended with his early masterpiece, ``Revelations.'' The
evening concluded with dancers, former dancers and crew members
embracing on stage and piling flowers under a photograph of Ailey
in his dancing years.
   Ailey died Friday of a blood disorder. He was 58.
   Carmen De Lavallade, who danced with Ailey, said during
Wednesday's program that Ailey's dream may have started in high
school, or before.
   ``I have been privileged to watch that dream grow from a tiny
seed of a company at the 92nd Street Y to this wonderful,
incredible company you see here tonight,'' she said.
   ``For the Y, he composed a dance about a man who fell in love
with the moon and decided to catch it. Alvin was the man and I was
the moon. After I was carried around through the air and out, a
silver sliver of a moon slid down a wire from my side to the stage
to his. He caught the moon. That's what he caught _ his dream.''
   Ailey started his troupe with seven members in 1958, dedicating
it to the preservation and enrichment of the American modern dance
heritage and the uniqueness of black cultural expression. Today the
troupe numbers 28, many of them graduates of the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Center.
   First as a dancer, than as a choreographer, Ailey was known for
his jazz-oriented modern dance innovations that combined black and
contemporary American cultural themes including jazz, blues,
gospel, folk heroes and politics.
   Harold Levine, chairman of the dance company's board, said the
board will ``continue the great legacy of Alvin Ailey. We will
build on his 31 years of creativity and see that his dreams are
realized.
   ``Generations to come will be thrilled and inspired by the Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater.''
   George Faison, a former Ailey dancer, now a choreographer, spoke
after Marilyn Banks danced to ``My Soul Is a Witness for My Lord.''
   He said, ``We have seen Alvin Ailey's glorification of the Lord
and we have all been witnesses of Alvin Ailey's human spirit.''
   The evening began with Roberta Flack singing ``Always.''
``Revelations,'' the audience's favorite Ailey creation, was danced
in its entirety, to hymns sung by Brother John Sellers, other
soloists and a choir.
   The evening ended with the audience leaving as Sellers sang
``Rocka My Soul in the Bosom of Abraham.''

   Thousands of children and grownups jammed a park
where George Bush once coached girls' softball to show the
president Thursday how they reclaimed the playground from drug
dealers.
   Bush said he was proud of the neighborhood for joining together
on what they call Independence Day, April 9, 1988, when 1,000
people went out to take Andrew Winzer Park back from drug dealers.
   ``Thank you not only for standing up to greet me, but also for
standing up for Houston every day,'' said Bush, noting that at one
time the park had been so clogged with drug dealers even Houston
police called it ``Crack In The Box.''
   Bands, drill teams, cheerleaders, choirs, school mascots _ even
a few children skipping school _ lined up hours before the
president arrived in northeast Houston to review the results of the
Acres Homes War on Drugs.
   Joining Bush for the 20-minute ceremony were federal drug czar
William Bennett, who visited the park in July, and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady. The visit was part of the president's
two-day trip to Texas, Iowa and Colorado to spotlight anti-drug
efforts and boost Republican candidates.
   In his remarks, Bush referred jocularly to the time he coached
softball at the park during his congressional service in the 1960s.
   ``It was a great bunch of girls. They almost won state,'' said
Bush. ``In fact, I think I see our third baseman over there,'' he
said, drawing a laugh from the crowd.
   The festive atmosphere Thursday was in stark contrast to the
situation in the area two years ago, when drug dealers dominated
the neighborhood.
   ``It was sad,'' said John Phillips, a former high school
football coach. ``I used to drive by here at lunch. There would be
25 cars lined up there for four or five guys selling whatever you
wanted. Families just stopped coming here. People were afraid.''
   The neighbors banded together, got their children involved, and
started an aggressive neighborhood watch program that included
writing down license numbers and turning alleged drug dealers into
police.
   Bush drew applause when he quoted Erma Scales, president of the
Acres Homes War on Drugs, as saying, ``We need to teach our system
of values, parents ... need to spend more time with their kids and
... go back to being parents, not just being buddies,'' he said.
   Kenneth Scott, 34, came out Thursday with his 3-year-old
daughter, Keandra.
   ``It's nice and peaceful now, but it was a lot of drug dealers
and drug addicts here. It was just in turmoil. I couldn't bring my
kid out here. They would run out to every passing car and ask every
passing car to buy drugs.
   ``But now that's all changed. I love it here.''
   But police said the job is not finished.
   As crews worked Wednesday to ready the park for the president's
visit, undercover police officers made three arrests in an hour for
the sale of crack cocaine within a mile of the park.

<HEAD>Opposition Says Kohl's Plan For Large Military Cuts Not Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's political
foes on Thursday complained that the government's tentative plans
to shrink its military forces by nearly one-fifth do not go far
enough.
   A day earlier, the government announced it intended to cut its
forces from 480,000 members to 400,000 by the mid-1990s, but only
if current East-West talks on reducing conventional forces in
Europe are successful.
   It would be the biggest reduction in West Germany's armed forces
ever.
   But Andreas von Buelow, a federal lawmaker with the opposition
Social Democratic Party, said Defense Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg's plan doesn't do enough to encourage disarmament and
to help overcome divisions within Europe.
   ``Why don't you (Stoltenberg) work toward a structure that
allows you to actively hurry along the demilitarization of the
East-West conflict that would still protect our security?'' Buelow
asked Stoltenberg at a heated parliamentary debate.
   The Social Democrats demanded that compulsory military service
be cut from 15 months to 12 months.
   Buelow also said West Germany and NATO should be thinking of
possible ways to alter the character of the armed forces so there
weren't so many offense-oriented elements.
   But Stoltenberg said his plan foresaw the ``most significant
new-ordering in the history of the Federal Republic's (West
Germany's) armed forces.''
   Pointing out that West Germany remained NATO's front-line state,
Stoltenberg said the country's armed forces are an ``essential
factor for stability in Europe'' and that this must not be
jeopardized.
   ``It would be disastrous to put into question the alliance's and
the (West German) army's roles as key elements for peace,''
Stoltenberg said.
   In announcing its plan Wednesday, the government said it was
taking the tentative steps to cut down on costs, because of West
Germany's low birth rate which means there will be fewer men for
the armed forces, and because of the changing political situation
in Europe.
   The demise of Communist governments in Eastern Europe has
triggered a new debate in West Germany about what kinds of changes
are possible within the country's own armed forces and within NATO
as a whole.
   The Social Democrats and the leftist Greens party have been
leading the calls for far-reaching changes, saying the threat from
the East bloc has decreased dramatically.
   Kohl's government says it wants quicker progress in arms control
and disarmament, But it has also pledged West Germany will remain a
NATO member even if events in Europe eventually permit unification
of the two German nations.
   Some liberal members of Kohl's government have strayed from
official government pronouncements on military matters.
   Education Minister Juergen Moellemann, a member of the Free
Democrat Party, junior partner in Kohl's coalition government, has
said he thought 350,000 soldiers in the country's armed forces and
a 12-month military service term would be sufficient.

   A car bomb planted by the IRA
exploded in a suburban shopping district Thursday, injuring 21
people and heavily damaging surrounding stores, police said.
   Police had evacuated the crowded shopping precinct in Lisburn,
following an Irish Republican Army warning telephoned to a radio
station 20 minutes before the blast, the Royal Ulster Constabulary
said.
   Lisburn, seven miles south of Belfast, is the headquarters for
the British army in Northern Ireland.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said the IRA
released a statement in Dublin, Ireland, saying the attack was
intended ``to embarrass the British government and its crown
forces, who have endeavored to throw a security blanket around this
garrison town to prevent IRA operations.''
   The Eastern Health Board said most of the injured police and
civilians had minor cuts and were suffering from shock. Three
people were admitted for surgery.
   A police spokesman said the bomb, packed into a Volkswagen van
parked near the Market Square shopping center, caused widespread
damage. Police estimated the size of the bomb at 500 pounds.
   ``I saw a number of shops wrecked, windows blown out of the
Presbyterian church and a number of fires,'' said the Rev. William
Beattie, a local lawmaker.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant
province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

   The local Salvation Army commander has
put his holiday bellringers on a $60 quota on daily donations in
their Christmas kettles, contending he's just practicing good
business.
   ``Our business practice requires that our costs should not
exceed 50 percent of what we bring in,'' Capt. Ron Gilden said in
justifying recent written warnings sent to two minimum-wage
bellringers.
   The wife of one disgruntled bellringer, who said her husband was
told he would lose his job if his collections did not pick up,
claimed Gilden's policy has prompted some bellringers to quit.
   Gilden acknowledged that one person quit, but others have had no
trouble meeting the quota. He said the complaining worker, who was
not identified, takes too many breaks, leaving his station
unattended.
   ``I've placed him at various sites and his collections are
always less than what was taken in the day before or the day after
he was at the site,'' Gilden said.
   Gliden said this year's Christmas drive is targeted to raise
$30,000, about 10 percent more than last year. The money is used
throughout the year.

   A ``substantially higher'' number of Hispanic
Americans are overweight when compared to the rest of the nation,
federal researchers reported Thursday.
   A survey of Mexican Americans in the West, Cuban Americans in
Miami and Puerto Ricans in metropolitan New York found overweight
problems to be ``substantially higher than those reported for
non-Hispanic Americans,'' the national Centers for Disease Control
reported.
   Among Mexican Americans, 30 percent of men and 39 percent of
women were overweight, the CDC said. Among Cuban Americans, 29
percent of men and 34 percent of women were overweight. And among
Puerto Ricans, 25 percent of men and 37 percent of women were
overweight.
   Among non-Hispanics in another survey, overweight men accounted
for 24 percent of whites and 25 percent of blacks. Among women, it
was 25 percent of whites and 44 percent of blacks.
   The three Hispanic groups chosen account for about three-fourths
of the Hispanic population in the United States, the CDC said.
While the survey was not nationwide, it was a scientifically based
sample in those three areas, said Michael Rowland, a researcher
with the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.
   The reasons for a trend toward overweight among Hispanic
Americans are ``pure conjecture,'' said Dr. David F. Williamson of
the CDC.
   He noted that Hispanic Americans, in general, have lower income
and education status than do white Americans, ``and people at the
lower end of socioeconomics are at greater risk of being overweight
_ this is an especially strong pattern among women.'' Why that is,
he said, is again up for debate.
   The surveys were conducted as part of the statistics center's
Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1982-84.
   The term overweight in the survey was used for anyone whose
``body mass index'' _ a measurement of height and weight _ was in
the top 15 percent of men or women in their 20s.
   ``Severely overweight'' indicated the top 5 percent. That
designation applied to between 8 to 10 percent of Hispanic-American
men and 8 to 16 percent of Hispanic-American women, compared with
generally lower levels for non-Hispanics, the CDC said.

<TEXT>
   The citrus canker scare that led to the
burning of 20 million fruit trees in the mid-1980s reached the
state's highest court Thursday, with growers arguing that a
compensation plan violates their rights.
   Attorneys for citrus growers and nursery owners told the Florida
Supreme Court that a law passed by the Legislature last spring
providing a $30 million compensation fund and setting up an
administrative hearing procedure denied them the right to have
their day in court.
   Claims pending before the state list damages of at least $200
million.
   Jim Moody, one of three citrus industry attorneys, said the plan
was wrong because the Legislature also made the decisions leading
to the burning of the trees. Under basic separation of powers
protections, he said, the courts are the correct forum for settling
on payment for losses.
   ``The Constitution is what protects us from our own
government,'' Moody said. ``Are we going to let those taking the
property determine the compensation for the property? The answer is
no.''
   Millions of citrus trees, mostly seedlings, were destroyed
beginning in 1984 to halt the spread of canker, a disease that can
lead to premature fruit drop and loss of the crop.
   Scientists have since concluded that most of the trees diagnosed
with canker were suffering from a relatively harmless leaf-spotting
disease, and most regulations aimed at preventing the spread of
canker have been dropped.
   Lower courts supported the state's authority to destroy the
trees because of fears that a serious disease was threatening the
state's $1 billion citrus industry. But courts also have ruled that
full compensation for destroyed trees is required.
   Attorney General Bob Butterworth said there are about 1,100
claims stemming from the canker eradication program. If those
claims were taken to court, Butterworth said, it could cost the
state at least $200 million.
   Seventy-six canker compensation cases have been filed in courts
around the state, but the law passed last spring freezes them and
directs they also go through an administrative process.
   A Hillsborough County judge ruled the law unconstitutional one
day after it was signed by Gov. Bob Martinez, and the state
appealed.
   Robert Shevin, a former state attorney general representing the
Legislature, said the compensation program gives growers a way to
press their claims in a reasonable way.
   ``We admit liability. We pay these folks,'' Shevin said. ``We
believe we've provided an adequate alternative remedy that has
adequate safeguards to ensure just compensation.''
   Another government attorney, Parker Thomson, said the system
keeps intact growers' constitutional rights to a hearing.
   ``I submit that there is no substantive right diminished, much
less taken away by this statute,'' said Thomson, representing
Butterworth.
   Moody and Steven Turner, another citrus industry attorney, said
the Florida Constitution protects a property owner's right to
compensation when property is seized by government, but more
importantly mandates that such a decision be made in a court.
   Turner also said the law should not be applied retroactively to
claims that already had been filed in state courts.
   The justices did not indicate when they would rule.

   America should seize and support
opportunities to reduce international tensions, the commander of
U.S. forces in the Pacific said Thursday in commemorating the 48th
anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. ``But when we perceive a
threat against the interests and security of the nation, we must
continue to speak out, even if the tide of public opinion is
running the other way,'' said Adm. Huntington Hardisty during a
Navy ceremony aboard the USS Arizona Memorial.
   Hardisty noted that an 18-year-old sailor lost in the Dec. 7,
1941, attack by Japan would now be 66.
   That sailor would be pleased to see that the Pacific command is
waging peace, Hardisty told about 100 invited guests.
   ``He would be pleased to see that our nation's security posture
in the Pacific is in good shape,'' Hardisty said. ``But I also
think the sailor would sound a warning that peace requires strong,
credible forces, and constant vigilence.''
   A minute of silence was observed at 7:55 a.m., the time the air
raid began. The minute ended with a flyover by Hawaii Air National
Guard jets in the ``missing man'' formation.
   Representatives of veterans, civic and patriotic organizations
presented wreaths during the ceremony, which also included prayers
and a 21-gun salute.
   Among those attending were U.S. Reps. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii,
Martin Lancaster, D-N.C., Marvin Leath, D-Texas, and David O'B.
Martin, R-N.Y.; Hawaii Gov. John Waihee; and other Pacific military
commanders.
   About 900 people attended a public service held simultaneously
at the Arizona Memorial Visitor Center.
   Retired Rear Adm. Victor A. Dybdal, who was a gunnery officer
aboard the USS Helm at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, was the
keynote speaker.
   He gave a personal account, paid tribute to those who died, and
said America must remain strong, even with recent developments in
Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``We should support the movements toward democracy and freedom,
but remember that the huge military strength of the Soviet Union is
still there,'' he said.
   The National Park Service ceremony included prayers by the World
Federation Japan Religious Committee.
   Some Pearl Harbor survivors scattered across the country
attended commemorations without returning to Hawaii.
   In Harrisburg, Pa., for example, Gov. Robert P. Casey told about
50 Pearl Harbor survivors they were in ``the front line'' of the
fight for freedom that is taking place in eastern Europe.
   ``You stand for peace and freedom, the peace and freedom that we
all enjoy, that others strive for and that can never be taken for
granted. You are living reminders of where we have been, of our
goals and of our aspirations.''

   The House Armed Services Committee chairman
charged Thursday that the Bush administration bungled the
announcement of future cuts in defense spending by failing to spell
out a military strategy.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
directed the services to come up with ways to slash $180 billion
from Pentagon spending during fiscal 1992 to fiscal 1994 but
provided no policy guidance.
   Without a strategy, the administration faces the likelihood of
the defense budget being crafted by lawmakers concerned with
parochial interests instead of by the administration, Aspin said.
   ``In the last couple of weeks the administration has fumbled the
defense budget ball big time,'' Aspin said in a speech to the
National Security Industrial Association.
   The Wisconsin Democrat said ``the budget exercise asked the
services where they would cut. It didn't tell them what threats to
assume, what roles to emphasize or what missions to minimize.''
   Complicating the situation was Cheney's decision to discuss the
cuts in published reports and television interviews, Aspin said.
   The cuts, according to the lawmaker, will come from unrealistic
budget totals envisioned by the Pentagon and in the long run will
amount to substantial, but no massive, reductions.
   ``If we compare it to the five-year defense plan that they are
now working with in the Pentagon, a cut of $180 billion in 1992,
1993 and 1994 would mean a reduction of about 4.5 percent per year
in each of those years. That's in real terms, after accounting for
inflation,'' Aspin said.
   The problems stemming from the administration's handling of the
issue will be worse if it falters in producing a strategy for the
budget cuts, Aspin said.
   ``When your defense budget is not supported by a military
strategy, it will be patched together with a pork strategy,'' Aspin
said. ``Of course, even if you have a military strategy it is hard
to fend off a pork strategy, but if you have no military strategy,
you have no chance.''
   Aspin said the administration faces allegations that it will be
fashioning a strategy to fit the budget.
   Nevertheless, the administration must reopen the debate over
Soviet military capabilities and intentions in a time of
fast-moving events in Eastern Europe.
   The administration then must outline a strategy to ensure that
the United States gets the most for its reduced defense dollars,
Aspin said.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,500 East Germans marched through the
city center late Thursday shouting slogans against the Communist
Party and the country's once-feared secret police.
   Hundreds of the demonstators blew shrill, ear-piercing whistles
and shouted for the secret police to stop meddling in citizens'
affairs.
   ``Imprison the Communists!'' the marchers demanded, referring to
disgraced former leaders accused of having misused their offices or
made off with state funds during four decades of Communist rule in
East Germany.
   The rally, which started at East Berlin's sprawling
Alexanderplatz, followed the broad Marx-Engels-Forum Boulevard and
passed city hall, included demonstrators who hoisted signs calling
for free elections next year.
   ``We Demand Quick Free Elections'' and ``The Communists Must Now
Pay for the Mistakes of Misery,'' placards read. ``We Have Had
Enough of Election Fraud.''
   Former Communist Party chief Egon Krenz was forced to resign
from his posts as party leader and president this week following
accusations that he allowed approval of falsified April election
results.
   Two demonstrators carried a sign showing a caricature of a man
shredding polling records.
   Another sign denounced Krenz and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, who has offered a plan for German reunification.
   ``We need neither Krenz nor Kohl _ we'll only feel well when we
govern ourselves,'' the sign read.
   There had been reports the demonstrators would march on the
secret police headquarters in East Berlin, but the demonstrators
never passed the building.
   About 200 demonstrators broke off from the main column at the
Communist Party headquarters, where they shouted ``Come Out, Come
Out, We Are Peaceful!''
   Police presence as the march wound through the city was
negligible.
   At one point, a policeman using the megaphone of a patrol car
shouted, ``Attention, attention, this is the people's police,
please use the sidewalks, you are disrupting traffic.''
   The marchers ignored the order, booing and jeering. The police
did nothing.
   People in a hotel along the route cheered on the marchers, who
waved back.
   At about the same time, about 30 demonstrators from West Berlin
pushed their way to the front of the column of marchers and shouted
anti-Nazi slogans.
   Part of the procession marched by the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer
building, where negotiations between the Communists, other
recognized political parties and opposition groups were under way.
   The marchers joined a chorus of calls there for free elections
and other democratic reforms in a Communist nation under siege by
its own people.
   About 90 minutes later, the marchers dispersed peacefully.

   A long-term Cuban political prisoner was near
death Thursday following 30 days on a hunger strike, a senior State
Department official said.
   Alfredo Mustelier, who was being fed intravenously against his
will in a Cuban military hospital, was ``close to death,'' said
Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights.
``He clearly poses no threat to the Cuban government and has
already served a long and harsh sentence,'' Schifter said.
   Schifter, in a speech commemmorating the 41st anniversary of
United Nations adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, repeated U.S. urgings that Mustelier be released
immediately on humanitarian grounds, along with two others who have
served more than 20 years in prison, Ernesto Diaz Rodriguez and
Mario Chanes de Armes.

   Viewers in Warsaw and Cracow soon may begin
watching CNN, ESPN and MTV, a Connecticut company said Thursday in
announcing it will build Poland's first cable television system.
   Chase Enterprises of Hartford, Conn., said it will have a 70
percent stake in Polska Telewizja Kablowa, or PTK, a cable
television system it will build and operate along with Poltelkab
SA, a partnership comprising the Polish Postal Service, Telephone
and Telegraph Co., Polish Radio and Television Productions Co., and
the governments of Warsaw and Cracow. Poltelkab will have the
remaining 30 percent interest.
   Company Chairman David Chase, a Pole who fled the Auschwitz Nazi
concentration camp at age 14 during World War II, said it is the
first communications-related joint venture established under
Poland's December 1988 joint venture law.
   ``We view this as only the first of many projects will will
undertake with Poland and in other economically emerging Eastern
European countries,'' Chase said in a statement.
   The announcement was another indication of the new business
opportunities that are opening up in Eastern Europe for Western
telecommunications businesses. Just this week:
   _Denver-based US West International announced it will build and
operate Eastern Europe's first cellular telephone system in Hungary
in a joint venture with Magyar Posta, the Hungarian postal,
telegraph and telecommunications organization.
   _US West also said it plans a joint venture to build a
fiber-optic cable telecommunications line across the Soviet Union
to link the Soviets with Japan and Europe. Other principals in the
project are the Soviet Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications;
Kokusai Denshin Denwa of Japan; Societa Finanziaria Telefonica of
Italy; British Telecom; OTC of Australia; Denmark's Great Nordic
Telegraph Co. and Telecom Denmark; and the Deutsche Bundespost
Telekom of West Germany.
   _San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis will have a 26 percent
interest in the Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH consortium that will
build and operate a second national cellular telephone system in
West Germany. The West German government operates the other.
Pacific will be partners with Mannesmann AG; Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank; Cable and Wireless PLC; Lyonnaise des Eaux;
and the National Associations of Electrical and Automobile Trades.
   Chase Enterprises' 20-year, $900 million joint venture will
provide cable TV service to 8 million homes in Poland, with
construction to begin within months in Warsaw and Cracow on an
18-channel system that will reach 1.8 million homes, Chase said.
   The programming for the Polish system still is under
negotiation, but is expected to include a number of
satellite-delivered services, including CNN, ESPN and MTV, as well
as movie, drama and sports channels, Chase said.
   He said Poland currently has two television channels, each
broadcasting a portion of the day. He said about 90 percent of
Polish households have TV sets.
   Polish Ambassador Jan Kinast called the agreement ``yet another
proof that Poland, which has embarked on a new road of profound
political and economic change, is fully open to cooperation abroad.
The development of this specific investment is an important
reflection of the increasingly dynamic and expanding
Polish-American relationship.''
   Chase is a retail@shopping center developer whose interests also
include radio and TV stations, cellular telephone and cable TV
systems, insurance and financial services.

<TEXT>
   Premier Ladislav Adamec resigned
Thursday while still bargaining with the powerful opposition, which
has told the Communists to form an acceptable government or face
another general strike.
   Adamec, 63, announced his resignation at a meeting with
non-Communist party officials about changes in the government, said
Bohuslav Kucera of the Socialist Party. He quoted Adamec as saying
a new, younger leader was needed to achieve a compromise.
   President Gustav Husak asked Deputy Premier Marian Calfa, 43, to
take over and continue searching for a solution, the official CTK
news agency reported.
   Calfa, a Communist, has attended most of Adamec's recent
meetings with opposition leaders, who rejected the Cabinet he
formed last Sunday.
   Adamec had been expected to name a new government Friday that
would involve some form of power sharing with the opposition, which
in a few weeks has become strong enough to break the Communist
Party's 41-year monopoly on power.
   The Civic Forum opposition movement and its Slovak counterpart,
Public Against Violence, have threatened a nationwide general
strike for Monday if a satisfactory government has not been formed.
   Civic Forum leader Vaclav Havel, a playwright whose works have
been banned in Czechoslovakia, was asked whether he would accept
the state presidency if it was offered. His reply:
   ``I have repeatedly said that my occupation is a writer and that
I have no political ambitions. I don't feel myself to be a
professional politician, but have always put the public interest
ahead of my own.
   ``And, if God help us, the situation should develop in such a
way that the only service I could render my country would be to do
this, then, of course, I would do it.''
   Havel added later that no one was promoting his candidacy and he
would accept it only if there was no other way out of the political
crisis.
   Leaders of Civic Forum appeared on the main evening newscast
with a list of names they gave Adamec as possible Cabinet members
only hours before he resigned.
   Zdenek Jicinsky said one proposal was that Slovak dissident Jan
Carnogursky be made first deputy premier and other deputy premiers
be named from the Socialist Party and the People's Party.
Carnogursky had been imprisoned since August and was freed 12 days
ago.
   Civic Forum also proposed its current spokesman, Jiri
Dienstbier, as foreign minister and economist Vaclav Klaus, a
member, as finance minister.
   Jicinsky said Petr Miller, a worker at the CKD industrial plant
in Prague and senior Civic Forum representative, was suggested as
social affairs minister.
   There was no official reaction to the proposals.
   Adamec's resignation was the latest capitulation to a
pro-democracy movement that, in less than a month, has forced the
Communists to relinquish their monopoly and dismiss leaders
associated with the crushing of the Prague Spring reforms of 1968.
   The ruling Politburo stripped former party chief Milos Jakes and
Miroslav Stepan, the former Prague party boss, of party membership
Thursday, accusing them of ``grave political mistakes in resolving
social tensions.''
   Mentioned specifically was the brutal police action against
peaceful protesters Nov. 17, which started the mass protest that
brought the party down. Action against those responsible for the
brutality has been a key opposition demand.
   Also at the Thursday meeting, the Politburo established a
commission to ``investigate serious cases of abuse of office by
certain party officials'' and said a special party congress would
be moved up from January to Dec. 20-21.
   Kucera said his Socialist Party, formally allied with the
Communists but increasingly independent, hoped to have at least two
ministers in the new government.
   The Peoples' Party, another former Communist ally now asserting
independence, has said it wants Calfa to form a government with
half the ministries run by people who have no aparty affiliation.
   It wants the other 50 percent divided among the Communists,
itself, the Socialists and two small officially recognized parties
in Slovakia, CTK reported.
   Adamec left halfway through the two-hour meeting with other
parties Thrusday, striding grimly toward his official sedan in
silence.
   He became premier in October 1988, and said last week that
Communist Party leaders often had frustrated his plans for reform.
   Party chief Karel Urbanek and several members of the ruling
Politburo were present at the meeting in which Adamec resigned.
   In a televised address Wednesday, Adamec had said he would quit
if the opposition did not stop presenting ``ultimatums.''
   On Thursday, opposition leaders rejected charges that it had put
Adamec under pressure to change the Communist-dominated Cabinet
sworn in last Sunday, which they rejected because it included only
five non-Communists.
   They want a new interim government to build the legal basis for
parliamentary democracy and hold free elections by July.
   On Monday, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in
Prague and Bratislava, Czechoslovakia's two largest cities, against
Adamec's new Cabinet. He reopened negotations with the opposition
Tuesday.

   The wild pig population feeding on garbage
at the Seminole County landfill had multiplied to about 1,500, and
the county decided it was time to do something.
   Enter Daniel Godwin, 23-year-old professional trapper.
   He pays the county $52 apiece to round up the hogs and truck
them away to sell to a slaughter house.
   ``People think catching hogs is fun, but it's a job,'' Godwin
said Tuesday after several days of trapping and muscling squealing
hogs _ which weighed up to 350 pounds _ into a truck.
   Godwin arrived at the 1,200-acre landfill early Saturday with
three helpers and began their routine: Set traps by day, sleep in
their vehicles at night while the hogs get trapped, and the next
day haul the hogs to Myakka City, a three-hour drive.
   It's tough work, he said.
   ``They get mean. They ain't no pets, you know. They'll catch you
if you let them,'' Godwin said.
   Now landfill workers say they will miss the porkers.
   ``They have gotten used to seeing them run around out there. You
look at the little ones, they're kind of cute,'' said Fred
Blakeley, the county's solid waste manager. ``But, you've got to do
what you've got to do.''

   Hurricane Hugo victims will be getting
1,000 Christmas trees and the trimmings to go with them.
   Organizers said the trees, relatively expensive in the South
because they must be shipped from colder climates, might be a
luxury beyond the means of many victims of the hurricane that swept
through South Carolina in September.
   Allegan County residents, tree growers and two companies teamed
up to send two truckloads of trees to Charleston, S.C., on Sunday.
   ``Allegan County, being such a big Christmas tree county, they
planned to raise money to buy trees to send,'' Mayor Craig van
Melle said.
   But tree growers donated the trees, and Frito Lay and L. Perrigo
Co. offered to handle the trucking. So residents provided
decorations.
   Marine Corps Reserve members will coordinate distribution in
Charleston.

   Here is a list of some of the worst one-day murder sprees in
recent history in the United States and Canada:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JULY 18, 1984 _ Twenty-one people are fatally shot in a
McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro, Calif., by James Oliver
Huberty, an out-of-work security guard. Huberty himself was killed
by a police sharpshooter.
   DECEMBER 1987 _ Sixteen people including 14 members of one

<HEAD>Marcos Took Fifth Amendment When Asked About Alleged Slush Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RORY MARSHALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a videotape played Thursday, former Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked
about a slush fund allegedly used to pay for the murders of two
anti-Marcos activists in Seattle.
   The deposition from the late Philippine ruler was played in a
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the families of Silme Domingo and
Gene Viernes, who were shot in offices of the Alaska Cannery
Workers Union here in June 1981.
   Three men were convicted of the murders on the theory that the
victims were working to eliminate gang influence on work
assignments and gambling in Alaska fish canneries.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit, however, claims the murder plot
actually was hatched in Manila because of Domingo's and Viernes'
anti-Marcos activism.
   The plaintiffs claim $15,000 was paid for the murders from an
intelligence slush fund that was administered by a company, the
Mabuhay Corp. of San Francisco, which was run by Dr. Leonilo
Malabed.
   Marcos has admitted Malabed was a friend, but invoked his Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on all questions
regarding intelligence funding and the Mabuhay company.
   He gave his deposition during two sessions in 1986 and 1987,
after he fled to Hawaii following the February 1986 overthrow of
his government. Marcos died last September.
   Marcos, his wife, Imelda, the Philippine government and others
are defendants in the suit, which seeks $30 million in damages.
   The questions Marcos would not answer were:
   _Whether the Philippines National Bank was used to channel money
to the United States for intelligence operations in the late 1970s
and 1980s.
   _Whether he authorized the use of up to $1 million in PNB money
to create the Mabuhay Corp.
   _Whether PNB money went to Mabuhay and was used ``to conduct
acts of physical violence against the anti-Marcos opposition ...
including and up to the use of murder, political assassination and
summary execution.''
   _Whether he was aware of Malabed's effort to buy a radio
station, the purpose for which Mabuhay allegedly was established.
   Marcos also refused to answer when asked directly whether
Mabuhay was used as an ``intelligence slush fund'' that provided
$15,000 on May 17, 1981, for the Domingo and Viernes murders. That
exchange was disallowed by U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein
and edited out of the video, but included in the full transcript of
the deposition.
   Among the key documents in the trial is one that plaintiffs
claim is an Mabuhay account sheet for the slush fund. Under a
heading for ``security projects'' is a May 17 entry for $15,000.
   Plaintiffs claim former cannery-union president Constantine
Baruso, whose gun was used in the killings, was in San Francisco on
that date to pick up the money. Baruso, who was never criminally
charged in the murders, also invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 times
during his testimony earlier in the lawsuit trial.
   In testimony shown Wednesday for a 1986 deposition session,
Marcos admitted four Philippine intelligence agencies operated in
the United States during his martial-law regime, but he denied they
would have used strong-arm tactics. He said he didn't become
concerned about anti-Marcos opposition in the United States until
about 1984.

nomination had been languishing.
   Bush announced, in Houston for several speaking engagements,
said he would give Barbara Everitt Byrant a ``recess appointment.''
   Under the Constitution, an individual appointed by the president
while the Senate is on an extended recess can serve until the end
of the following year without requiring Senate confirmation.
   Since the every-ten-years census is to be conducted next year,
Bush's action would allow Ms. Bryant to serve through the end of
the 1990 census year with no further action by the Senate.
   Ms. Bryant, 63, of Ann Arbor, Mich., was nominated by Bush last
Sept. 22. But when Congress quit for the year last month, her
nomination still had not been acted on.
   She succeeds John G. Keane as Census director.
   Ms. Bryant for the past 12 years has been senior vice president
of Market Opinion Research of Detroit, the polling company founded
by former Bush campaign adviser Robert Teeter.

   Federal regulators asked a judge Thursday to
dismiss a suit against them by the former owner of Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association, saying they can show Phoenix millionaire
Charles H. Keating Jr. was operating the thrift in violation of the
law.
   Deals that the hearing is focusing on are ``literally just the
tip of the iceberg,'' James P. Murphy, an attorney for the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, told U.S. District Court
Judge Stanley Sporkin.
   Under an arrangement approved by attorneys for both sides, a
sample of four deals _ two land transactions, a tax-sharing
arrangement between Lincoln and its holding company and a deal
involving stock _ will occupy the two days of hearings that began
Thursday.
   ``I assume you picked the worst ones,'' Sporkin, a former chief
enforcement officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission,
said to Murphy. The judge ordered the hearing on the government's
motion to dismiss Keating's suit in what regulators say will end up
as the costliest S&amp;L collapse in history.
   Last May, a month after regulators seized Keating's Irvine,
Calif., thrift, he filed the suit seeking to nullify the
government's action. Regulators contended the S&amp;L had lost between
$1 billion and $2.5 billion in federally insured deposits through
fraud, risky investments and sham real estate transactions.
   The government has summoned Keating to appear as a witness.
   The target of a federal grand jury investigation in Los Angeles,
Keating invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and refused to answer questions in a subpoenaed
appearance last month before the House Banking Committee.
   In his suit, Keating and his attorneys allege that Lincoln was
being operated soundly, met federal capital requirements and was
making a profit, and that its takeover by the government was
``capricious and arbitrary.''
   Before hearing testimony, Sporkin denied efforts by Keating's
attorneys to quash as evidence four letters from one of Lincoln's
attorneys prior to the takeover last April 14.
   Charles M. Stern, a Los Angeles attorney representing Keating,
said allowing the government to use the letters would violate his
client's attorney-client privilege. ``We should not be forced to
have our own lawyers used against us,'' he said.
   However, attorneys for the thrift regulators said the letters
effectively became government property once the government seized
Lincoln.
   Sporkin granted Keating's request for government records dating
back to 1985 on tax-sharing agreements between hundreds of thrifts
around the country and their holding companies.
   A key element of the government's case is its contention that
Lincoln and its holding company, American Continental Corp. of
Phoenix, abused a tax-sharing agreement to effectively siphon off
nearly $95 million in federally insured deposits.
   Keating is chairman of American Continental, which filed for a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization one day before the government
placed Lincoln into conservatorship.
   Government regulators in 1986 had approved the tax-sharing
arrangement, under which American was supposed to collect taxes
from Lincoln and forward the money to the Internal Revenue Service.
   But Murphy said Lincoln and American Continental fraudulently
misused the accord to effectively allow the holding company to use
the tax collections as a no-interest loan from Lincoln.
   Federal thrift regulations prohibit savings and loan
institutions from lending money to their holding companies.
   In a related development, Sen. Alan Cranston's complaint about a
leak of information that the FBI was investigating a voter
registration project operated by his son, Kim, was referred to the
Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsiblity.
   FBI Director William S. Sessions told reporters he referred the
matter to the Justice Department's internal investigations office.
Cranston, D-Calif., is one of five senators who intervened on
Keating's behalf with federal regulators.
   The FBI is investigating whether whether Cranston and the other
senators violated any laws by taking campaign donations from
Keating and lobbying federal regulators.

   Bells tolled, thousands wept in the
graveyards and plaintive chants filled the streets Thursday as
Armenia marked the first anniversary of the earthquake that killed
25,000 of its people.
   In this mountain city, officials stopped the town clock forever
at 11:41, the minute disaster struck, and held a moment of silence.
   Only muffled sobs broke the stillness.
   ``If only it could all have been a dream, and we could wake up
and have everyone here again,'' Armenian poet Maro Marzarian told a
crowd of several hundred gathered to dedicate a memorial to
Leninakan's thousands of dead.
   In a snowy cemetery just outside of town, women sobbed at the
gravesites, some of them caressing photographs etched on the
tombstones and men stood stony eyed and silent. Many graves held
unidentified corpses, with markers reading only ``238, woman'' or
``453, child.''
   ``Your soul hurts so much you just can't express it,'' said
Lilia Stepanian, 25, whose brother, Zillik, and his family were
crushed to death in their Leninakan apartment.
   ``You remember that on this day, at this time, they were already
gone,'' she said. ``At this time one year ago I was standing by our
house, only it wasn't a house any more.
   She said Zillik's 3-year-old daughter could be heard crying from
the ruins of the house but rescuers could not get to her in time.
Stepanian's mother, Rima, said Zillik's wife had been due to give
birth to a second child three weeks later.
   ``And the people left alive have such a hard time,'' Lilia
Stepanian said. She and her mother moved to Armenian capital of
Yerevan until Leninakan housing could be built for them _ which
they don't expect any time soon.
   The earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale killed at
least 25,000 people, left 20,000 missing and destroyed the homes of
500,000 more.
   In the nearby village of Spitak, where the quake destroyed
virtually every house, residents dedicated a new church of
galvanized steel. Standing above a hillside crowded with graves, it
shone in the sun under Thursday's bright blue sky.
   Armenians stopped work Thursday to honor the dead, and Armenian
TV broadcast a program on earthquake damage and reconstruction.
   After the quake rocked Armenia with such devastating force, the
Soviet Union opened its borders to foreign assistance for the first
time, accepting the help of thousands of experts, including rescue
teams, doctors and construction specialists.
   More than a half-billion dollars in assistance poured into the
disaster area from overseas, altering the course of East-West
relations as generosity and mercy overcame years of Soviet
propaganda depicting Westerners as greedy and hate-filled.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Thursday that
foreign assistance as of mid-October totaled $586 million. The most
generous donors were Italy with $95 million; West Germany with
$84.5 million; the United States with $42 million; Britain with $38
million; Czechoslovakia with $34.5 million; East Germany with $30
million; and France with $28 million.
   On Thursday, the Vatican announced Pope John Paul II sent
$100,000 to Armenian Christians, saying he wanted to give ``a new
sign of his affection for those peoples and of his active
participation in the difficult test they have been subjected to.''
   Vatican officials gave the gift to Vasken I, the chief leader of
the Armenian Church, which broke from the Roman Catholic Church in
the 6th century but maintains good ties with the Holy See.

   A Sumter, S.C., processor is voluntarily
recalling a single 240-pound shipment of luncheon meat distributed
to nearby stores because some of the product may be contaminated by
food poisoning bacteria, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Harvin Choice Meats Inc. sold the product _ ``Harvin Sliced
Luncheon Meat'' packed in 6-ounce vacuum packages _ exclusively to
grocery and convenience stores in a 20-mile radius of Sumter,
officials said.
   The possible contamination involves Listeria monocytogenes,
bacteria that can cause severe illness, said Lester M. Crawford,
head of the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
Consumers should return the packages where purchased. No other
product of the company is involved in the recall. k
   Crawford said no illnesses have been reported as a result of
eating the suspected product. Cartons containing the packages carry
the production code, 0318. And each carton and package bears a USDA
inspection seal with ``Est. 6592'' inside the seal.
   Food contaminated with the bacteria can cause listeriosis,
described as a rare but potentially serious disease, particularly
for those with weakend immune systems _ infants, the elderly and
the chronically ill.
   Symptoms are flu-like and include fever chills, headache,
backache and sometimes abdominal pain and diarrhea.
   Consumers with questions about the recall can phone the
toll-free USDA meat and poultry hotline at 1-800-535-4555 from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday. Callers in Washington,
D.C., metropolitan area lshould call 447-3333.

   President F.W. de Klerk said
Friday he would not order an independent inquiry into allegations
of police death squads because justice officials could do the job
faster and just as well.
   Several police officers, serving and retired, will be
investigated and five have requested suspension from duty until
investigations or legal proceedings are completed, de Klerk and
Adriaan Vlok, the law and order minister, said in statements
released at 12:01 a.m.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said two former security
policemen whose allegations prompted the inquiry would be
prosecuted. One awaits execution for a non-political murder and the
other has fled the country.
   ``The government has full confidence that the tried and
respected prosecution mechanisms of the state will be sufficient to
bring the accused before the court, impartially and objectively,''
de Klerk in response to demands that the investigation be conducted
outside the law enforcement establishment.
   ``A judicial inquiry can take months, if not years, to reach its
final conclusions,'' he said. ``In the meanwhile, a climate of
suspicion and distrust could develop, something the country can ill
afford at this stage in its history.''
   South Africa's national police have been criticized for failing
to solve dozens of killings of anti-government activists since
1978. Anti-apartheid leaders say many people believe security
personnel help plan, participate in, or cover up such actions.
   Three former security policemen have said in recent newspaper
interviews or sworn affidavits that they participated in death
squad operations on orders of superiors, many of whom still occupy
high positions in the police.
   The former policemen, two black and one white, said they were
involved in bombings, arson, kidnapping, robbery and murder in
South Africa and neighboring countries.
   One, Almond Nofomela, is awaiting execution. The others have
fled, but one is reported held by authorities in Botswana.
   Vlok's statement about what would be investigated mentioned only
Nofomela's allegations. He said ``a team of senior detectives''
would work with the attorneys general of Natal and Transvaal
provinces.
   The South African Council of Churches demanded access Thursday
to camps where police say former African National Congress
guerrillas are held when they agree to join the police.
   One former policemen who fled, ex-Capt. Dirk Coetzee, said the
death squads recruited such former guerrillas.
   Police identified five Afrikaner men Thursday who were arrested
in connection with an alleged far-right group suspected of planning
attacks on anti-apartheid activists. The men, all from the
Johannesburg area, range in age from 24 to 41, and were arrested
Tuesday.
   Police say the men are believed to be part of a group that broke
with the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   A report in the Citizen newspaper said police were investigating
the possibility that extremists had murdered black civilians as
practice for future attacks on political targets.
   It said all five men were former members of the paramilitary
bodyguard that protected Eugene TerreBlanche, leader of the
Afrikaner Resistance Movement, and he was on a ``hit list'' found
when they were arrested.
   Police are said to be investigating possible connections between
the five men and two other cases.
   In one, two former policemen are held in Johannesburg for
questioning about the assassinations of university academic David
Webster and Namibian lawyer Anton Lubowski.
   In the other, three men escaped this week from police custody
while being transported from a Namibian court, where they faced
murder charges for a grenade attack on an office of the U.N.
observers monitoring the territory's transition to independence.

<HEAD>Transportation Secretary Promises `Reasonable' Approach To Drug Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
assured private transportation operators Thursday that his
department will be ``reasonable and understanding'' in enforcing
drug testing rules that take effect this month.
   ``You don't have to be worried during the implementation stage
that enforcers will show up at your doorstep with subpoenas,''
Skinner told an industry seminar on the new program.
   Drug testing programs, including random testing, will have to go
into effect for mariners and transit and aviation workers this
month. Testing for railroad workers starts in January and for
pipeline workers in April. A federal court injunction has stalled
random and some post-accident testing in the trucking industry.
   Companies with fewer than 50 employees will have another year to
begin testing programs. Twenty-two court challenges have been filed
against the program by various transportation groups, but Skinner
said it will take effect on schedule except where courts intervene.
   ``While we want the rules enforced and expect them to be
implemented, we understand it will be an evolutionary process,''
Skinner said. ``Rest assured, we will be reasonable and
understanding.''
   Skinner said safety-related jobs must be drug-free for the
nation's transportation systems to remain safe. The department
eventually expects about half of the nation's 4 million
transportation employees to be tested at least once a year both as
a means of detecting drug use and as a deterent.
   Skinner noted that 25,349 random drug tests conducted on
department employees resulted in only 141 positive tests, a rate of
about 0.5 percent. But he told reporters earlier this week that he
expects the tests to show an ``alarming amount of drug usage'' in
mass transit and other private transportation industries.

   Police and community leaders expected little
violent reaction Thursday to the guilty verdicts against a police
officer in the killing of two black men, but police stayed on alert
in the ethnically tense city.
   Police had made extraordinary preparations in case an inocent
verdict in the trial of Hispanic officer William Lozano set off
violence in black neighborhoods. Instead, the verdict left
bitterness among some Hispanics.
   ``We'll maintain a high visibility tonight and possibly
downscale our activities tomorrow,'' Police Chief Perry Anderson
said.
   The police department put all 1,100 officers on call, bought 700
gas masks and arranged for two armored personnel carriers to be
available for riot duty.
   The city has been wracked by riots four times this decade, most
recently in January when Lozano's fatal shooting of a black
motorcyclist triggered three days of violence in the week before
Miami held the Super Bowl. The motorcyclist's passenger also died.
   Near the shooting site in the impoverished, mostly black
Overtown section, some 100 blacks went ahead with a march Thursday
despite the verdict. But they said the event was turned from a
protest to a celebration.
   ``The verdict means relief, but there's still an element in the
police department that thinks justice lies at the end of your
arm,'' said march organizer Michael Umoja Imani.
   ``Everyone has been following this from day one,'' said
participant Judy Wallace, 22, who lives in an apartment building
across the street from the shooting site. ``When the verdict was
announced, everyone was relieved and very happy.''
   Some marchers criticized police officials' decision to post
riot-ready units in black neighborhoods and ignore mostly Hispanic
areas.
   Among Hispanics, who outnumber Dade County blacks more than
2-to-1, the mood seemed mostly concerned but not hostile.
   ``Yes, there will be people in the Hispanic community that will
think it's unfair, but that has to be settled,'' said Tere Gavalda
of the Spanish-American League Against Discrimination. ``It's
unfortunate the case turned out to be a black against Hispanic
issue. We have to put that to rest.''
   Mayor Xavier Suarez said he received nearly a dozen telephone
calls from people angered by the verdict, but there was no
indication of violence.
   Suarez, who last summer was denounced by some fellow
Cuban-Americans for supporting a black woman over a Cuban for a
city commission seat, said there was no way of knowing if the
verdict would raise tensions between blacks and Hispanics.
   ``I don't think the Hispanic community is going to respond in
any monolithic way,'' Suarez said.
   Suarez, who took office in 1985 with a promise to improve
Miami's inner-city neighborhoods, hoped the verdict might ease some
of the alienation among blacks there who feel the justice system is
against them.
   ``There has been a succession of cases that led to outcomes that
have not been successful to the black community,'' Suarez said.
``This was at least a departure from a trend.''
   Community leaders who had been ready to go into the streets to
talk against violence said they would try to ease any ethnic
reactions by Hispanics.
   ``We definitely have not reached Utopia,'' said Willie Sims of
the Dade County Community Relations Board. ``We're not going to
drop everything. We were focusing on a not guilty verdict (and
black reaction) and now the emphasis shifts on the Hispanic group.''
   At Spanish-language radio station WQBA, caller were shocked and
angry, said Fernando Checa, a technical director. ``Mostly, they
feel the judgment was done for the black community,'' Checa said.
   Some police advocates predicted the verdict would harm efforts
to recruit for Miami's police force.
   ``I hope this won't discourage people from being police
officers, but that's my concern. Being a cop in Miami is tough
enough,'' said David Nevel, attorney for a police group that
supports stronger penalties for criminals and also president of
Miami Beach Fraternal Order of Police Associates.

   The Communist Party got together with the
opposition Thursday, after 40 years of ruling East Germany with
Stalinist orthodoxy, and they agreed to rewrite the constitution
and hold free elections in May.
   The first talks between party and opposition delegations were
held after publication of the new Communist program, and produced
agreement to recommend that Parliament schedule elections May 6.
   They also agreed on the need for a new constitution, but no
details were released.
   About 2,500 people marched to the site of the talks in a
Lutheran Church building and chanted, ``Free elections! Free
elections!''
   Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, chief of state security, said angry
citizens had stormed secret police facilities in four cities,
inflicting ``numerous slight injuries to our colleagues.''
   He said the situation was at ``the threshold of escalation,''
and aggressive acts against his forces could ``have unforeseeable
consequences for the country.''
   The government has warned against growing violence, but few
cases have been documented. Opposition leaders in Suhl claimed
police dispersed angry citizens with tear gas.
   In an interview on state television, Communist Premier Hans
Modrow appealed for calm while sympathizing with people angered by
reports of ousted officials thwarting investigations of alleged
corruption.
   Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer of Dresden, representing the Communists
at the talks, joined other officials in calling on citizens to act
responsibly.
   ``I understand the motivation, but such a process can get out of
control,'' he said.
   Berghofer expressed concern about short, politically motivated
strikes occurring at state enterprises. The West German newspaper
Bild quoted him as saying there was a ``potential for violence on
both sides.''
   East German news media reported riots in some prisons by inmates
demanding amnesty.
   Rudolf Seiters, chief aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany, spoke to reporters in Bonn of ``tendencies toward
increasing aggression'' in East Germany. Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader
of the opposition Social Democrats, expressed similar concern.
   In what may have been intended as a preventative measure, the
East Berlin secret police force invited activists from several
pro-democracy groups for a tour of their headquarters and talks
with security officials.
   East Germany has undergone a virtual revolution in less than two
months, ousting the old leaders, then the replacements, and opening
its borders. Some former leaders have been charged with corruption.
   As in the the rest of Eastern Europe at a time of rapid change,
the future political course is unclear.
   The Communist Party opens an emergency congress Friday to revamp
its structure and shed the last vestiges o Stalinism.
   Markus Meckel, a spokesman for the newly formed Social
Democratic Party, told reporters Thursday the Communists planned to
change their name to the Socialist Party, as the Hungarians did in
October.
   In its new program, published Thursday by the official news
agency ADN, the party calls for ``alternative democratic
socialism'' and accepts blame for the current political and
economic turmoil.
   It advocates closer cooperation with West Germany, but warns
against reunification as a threat to stability.
   ``We support free and secret elections as early as possible, at
a time to be set jointly by all political forces,'' the program
says, but does not suggest an election date.
   All ``newly formed democratic political movements and forces''
work together until the elections, the program says, in a reference
to New Forum and other opposition movements that have sprung up in
recent weeks.
   Since the leadership resigned en masse on Sunday, the party has
been guided by a committee of 25 reformers, who devised the new
program.
   Many topics raised at the first party-opposition meeting
Thursday also are likely to be addressed at the Communist Party
congress.
   Modrow had been expected attend the talks with 13 other parties
and social groups. His absence may indicate reluctance to take a
prominent role in party affairs, since Modrow has more popular
support than other ranking party members.
   Long debates over who could take part and what would be on the
agenda left little time for negotiating at the session.
   Manfred Gerlach, the country's interim president, urged the
gathering to propose a new voting law and suggested May or June for
free elections. Gerlach, a non-Communist who leads the Liberal
Democratic Party, was named president Wednesday to replace Egon
Krenz.
   Groups represented in the forum, including a half-dozen
pro-reform groups that still lack official recognition, agreed in
advance that it had no power to make national policy but could make
proposals to the legislature.
   Pro-democracy rallies that swelled to hundreds of thousands
after the Oct. 7 celebration of East Germany's 40th year forced
Honecker to step down as party chief Oct. 18. He was replaced by
Krenz, a long-time associate who in turn was hounded into
resignation Sunday.
   Successes scored by pro-democracy activists have emboldened many
citizen organizations pressing for further change. New committees
have been formed to make sure authorities prevent those accused of
corruption from absconding with incriminating evidence or state
property.
   Citizens have occupied state security facilities in at least six
cities, and authorities claimed Wednesday there were indications of
assaults being planned on military facilities.
   Activists in Leipzig, Gera, Dresden, Cottbus, Suhl and Rostock
have taken over secret police facilities, angered by reports that
some officials suspected of graft and corruption have destroyed
files or made off with valuables.

   The Plains got a blast of winter Thursday as a storm left more
than a foot of snow in places, while a second winter storm warning
was posted for the mid-Atlantic states.
   Snowfall was heaviest in the West. Colorado snow cover included
17 inches at Rye, with 8 inches at Beulah, West Cliff and
Walsenburg. Story, Wyo., had 11 inches of snow and 5 inches fell at
Sheridan, Wyo.
   Roads over the Texas Panhandle were ice-covered Thursday
morning. At least three inches of snow fell on Amarillo, Texas, and
up to two inches of snow accumulated in parts of Nebraska.
   Mild temperatures melted much of the snow and turned it into
freezing rain. ``It's melting about as fast as it's falling,'' said
Bill Wyatt, a spokesman for the city of Woodward, Okla., which
received about 3 inches of snow.
   During the day snow fell over the southwestern third of North
Dakota, much of South Dakota, north-central through western
Nebraska, northeast Colorado, much of Kansas into southwest
Missouri, northern and western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and
northwest Texas.
   In the East, a winter storm warning was posted for Friday over
the southern and western half of Virginia, northeast Tennessee,
southeast Kentucky and much of western North Carolina.
   Snow showers fell Thursday across central and western New York
state, northwest Pennsylvania and northeast Ohio. Snow extended
over upper Michigan and western lower Michigan.
   Rain reached across Arkansas, eastern Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, northern Georgia and South Carolina.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included an inch at Jackson, Miss., .72 of an inch at Lafayette,
La., and .70 of an inch at McComb, Miss.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from zero
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 85 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.The
low temperature for the nation Thursday morning was 15 degrees
below zero at Warroad, Minn.

   The Presidential Guard used tear
gas and clubs to disperse about 1,000 students Thursday during the
largest protest yet against European mercenaries who seized control
of this island nation.
   Witnesses said several of the high-school students were beaten.
   The violence came as France cut off its $18 million in annual
aid to the Comoros, off the east coast of Africa. Diplomatic
sources said the assistance would not be resumed until the head of
the new ruling group, French mercenary Bob Denard, leaves the
island.
   South Africa, another large donor to this impoverished nation
with a population of about 430,000, took the same action Monday. It
also cut off support for the Presidential Guard.
   President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane died Nov. 26 in an attack
blamed by diplomatic sources on Denard, commander of the 500-member
Presidential Guard. That force disarmed the regular army and now
controls the four-island archipelago between Mozambique and the
island of Madagascar.
   The students shouted ``The mercenaries must go!'' and ``Denard
is an assassin!'' as they marched from the French Embassy to the
beachfront Thursday morning.
   They were confronted there by members of the guard, which is led
by about 30 French and Belgian mercenaries.
   The guardsmen, supported by jeeps equipped with heavy machine
guns, drove through the capital in the biggest show of force since
Abdallah was killed. Denard has denied involvement in the
assassination, but sources said Thursday the two men had quarreled
recently over several issues, including funding of the Presidential
Guard.
   Many students dashed into the water when the guardsmen arrived,
and others fled through side streets. Most later regrouped at the
Ministry of the Interior in the city center, where dozens of
guardsmen launched tear-gas grenades and charged with clubs.
   Youths forced a suspected spy for the Presidential Guard from
his civilian car, then overturned the vehicle and burned it on one
of the main streets of Moroni, the capital.
   Witnesses said several students were clubbed or otherwise
beaten, but there was no official injury toll.
   Guardsmen patrolled working-class areas of the city throughout
the day, dispersing smaller gatherings with tear gas and clubs, the
witnesses said.
   Throughout the day, hundreds of young men jeered and shouted at
Guard vehicles as they sped through the capital and outlying
villages.
   ``The people have always opposed the mercenaries, but they were
silent until the president was killed,'' said Abdul Mohammed, a
Moroni resident. ``Now the people are angry and say the mercenaries
must leave.''
   Several photographers and reporters had their film and notebooks
seized as they covered the morning demonstration. Ten journalists
were later ordered to leave the islands by Thursday evening, and
five other journalists were told to remain in their hotel.
   The French Foreign Ministry said the suspended aid includes
direct assistance, as well as 150 technical and 13 military
advisers. The islands gained independence from France in 1975.
   Denard, 60, ousted and later returned Abdallah to the presidency
in coups during the 1970s. Although Denard held no official title,
he maintained strong influence in security and political matters.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia descended into political chaos
Thursday under threats from drug traffickers of further terrorism,
leading one newspaper to demand cancellation of next year's
presidential elections.
   All 10 presidential candidates for party nomination should
withdraw, the influential El Espectador newspaper said in an
editorial.
   The capital's half-dozen dailies all ran banner headlines about
Wednesday's 1,100-pound dynamite bomb explosion that destroyed a
block of downtown Bogota, killing 52 people and wounding about
1,000.
   The blast outside federal investigative police headquarters came
one day after a government report blamed terrorists for the Nov. 27
explosion of a Colombian jet that killed all 107 people aboard.
   ``Drug Traffickers Turn Bogota into Beirut,'' said El Tiempo's
headline.
   El Tiempo and El Espectador said the situation was so grave
President Virgilio Barco should ask all parties to forget their
differences and form a common front against traffickers.
   El Espectador said the crisis extends beyond the traffickers'
terrorist campaign to encompass a political system on the verge of
collapse.
   Barco told the nation late Wednesday traffickers were
endangering the country's democracy, but would fail.
   ``We are fighting and will continue to fight. The war is against
all Colombia, against democracy,'' he said in a speech transmitted
by satellite from Tokyo, where he is on a state visit.
   Barco is cutting his visit short by one day and returning to
Colombia Friday night.
   In Tokyo on Thursday, the president promised to take swift,
stern action against cocaine cartels and the terrorists.
   U.S. House Speaker Thomas Foley cited the drug violence Thursday
in Washington when he said President Bush ``ought to think
carefully about a visit to Colombia under these circumstances.'' He
commented after meeting with Bush at the White House on the Malta
summit.
   White House advance teams have scouted Colombia's northern
coastal city of Cartagena as a possible site for the upcoming drug
summit Bush has agreed to attend with leaders of Colombia, Bolivia
and Peru.
   Meanwhile a bomb exploded Thursday on a road in Cartagena,
killing two policemen in a car, radio reports said. Pamphlets left
at the site, however, indicated the attack was the work of the
leftist guerrilla National Liberation Army.
   The immediate threat to this South American nation's stability
is traffickers' insistence that the people be allowed to vote on
the administration's extradition policy.
   The Extraditables, a group linked to the Medellin cocaine
cartel, took responsibility for the Wednesday bomb hours after the
devastating explosion. It earlier pledged in a communique to keep
up the terrorist campaign until the extradition referendum is
approved by Congress.
   Colombia's House of Representatives passed a bill Tuesday night
calling for such a referendum and the Senate is to vote on the
measure before its current session ends on Dec. 15.
   Congress has long been the butt of jokes by Colombians as being
corrupt and receiving payments from drug dealers.
   In an editorial headlined ``Faced with Crime, Terror and Moral
Corruption,'' El Espectador said the country's constitutional
system no longer exists because it has been so damaged by
traffickers' influence.
   Traffickers bombed El Espectador on Sept. 2 as part of a terror
campaign to try to pressure the government into ending extradition.
   Barco suggested in his speech that drug barons were intimidating
legislators into following their demands.
   ``It is unacceptable from every point of view that drug
traffickers are trying to subdue our legislators so that they make
a decision that will only bring more death and destruction,'' he
said.
   His administration has sent nine Colombian drug suspects to the
United States under a tough extradition policy, part of an
anti-narcotics war decreed last August after traffickers
assassinated a leading presidential candidate.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rules Boston University Must Grant Woman Professor
Tenure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. appeals court has upheld a federal judge's
1987 ruling that Boston University must pay $215,000 in damages and
grant tenure to a female professor who sued the university for sex
discrimination.
   The case was believed to be the first time a woman suing under
the federal anti-discrimination law was reinstated with full tenure
by an appeals court.
   Julia Prewitt Brown, 41, was a member of BU's English Department
from 1974 until she was denied tenure in 1981. At one point,
university president John Silber termed the department ``a damn
matriarchy'' although only only six out of 20 members of the
department at the time were female, according to court testimony.
   In a 68-page decision, the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously agreed with a jury verdict and subsequent judgment by
Judge Walter J. Skinner after a three-week trial in July 1987. The
ruling was issued Dec. 1 but Brown's attorney said she chose not to
publicize it until Thursday.
   BU spokesman Thomas Cashman said the university will ask the
court for a rehearing.
   ``Boston University does not discriminate against anyone,''
Cashman said in a prepared statement. ``This case involves issues
of academic freedom. We believe that it is wrong for courts to
substitute their opinions or the opinions of the jury for the
scholarly judgment of the university in determining who shall
teach.''
   BU's official reason for not granting tenure was Brown's alleged
``lack of academic excellence.'' But Brown was unanimously
recommended for tenure by her BU colleagues both inside and outside
the department, according to the appellate decision.
   ``I think it's going to be a real shot in the arm for women as
well as minorities,'' said Barbara Lee, an attorney on the faculty
at Rutgers University and the author of ``Academics in Court.''
   ``It's extremely difficult to win these cases,'' she said.
``Most times the judge accepts the universities' arguments.''
   The decision, written by Chief Judge Levin Campbell, touched on
remarks made by Silber in tenure reviews of other female faculty
members.
   According to the ruling, Silber told one female professor that a
person with her credentials would do well ``and anyway ... your
husband is a parachute, so why are you worried?''
   Campbell wrote that ``(Silber's) comments reflected a
patronizing attitude toward women.''
   Brown, who spent 10 years fighting her case, called the decision
``a victory for all of us.''
   ``I am only one among many women at Boston University and in the
academy at large who have been held to a higher standard than male
colleagues,'' she said in a prepared statement Thursday.
   Ann H. Franke, an attorney with the American Association of
University Professors who filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the
appellate court, said the ruling ``means there's a powerful remedy
through the courts now for sex discrimination.''
   Franke and Lee both said the appeals decision was the first to
their knowledge in which a professor's full tenure was reinstated
under the anti-discrimination law.

<HEAD>Sixteen S&amp;Ls Allowed to Sell Debt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sixteen savings and loans were permitted to
sell $3 billion in uninsured debt to their customers, the same
practice that cost many depositors at Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association their life savings, thrift regulators said Thursday.
   Despite the Lincoln debacle, the Office of Thrift Supervision
this year allowed seven S&amp;Ls to begin selling debt to retail
customers and another nine institutions to continue sales approved
earlier, according to a two-page summary released by the office.
   Such sales are attracting heavy scrutiny because some 22,000
investors, many of them elderly pensioners and widows, lost an
estimated $250 million by purchasing subordinated debt in American
Continental Corp., the parent company of the Irvine, Calif.-based
Lincoln, in 1987 and 1988.
   In sometimes tearful testimony, Lincoln customers told the House
Banking Committee last month they were misled into believing the
debt certificates were federally insured.
   The Lincoln debt was sold in the branch offices of the S&amp;L and
offered in amounts as small as $1,000, a feature that appealed to
unsophisticated investors.
   The thrift office said the approved debt sales, in addition to
Lincoln, totaled $3.017 billion. In some instances denominations as
low as $1,000 were offered.
   Thrift office rules required that S&amp;Ls offering debt meet
capital standards at the time of the approval. However, according
to Sheshunoff Information Services of Austin, Texas, two of the 16
S&amp;Ls as of June 30 had no tangible capital. They are Security First
Federal Savings and Loan Assocation of Daytona, Beach, Fla., and
Centrust Savings Bank, Miami.
   Two others fall short of new standards effective Thursday which
require S&amp;Ls to hold capital amounting to 1.5 percent of their
assets, the firm said. They are Cenlar Federal Savings Bank,
Princeton, N.J., and TCF Bank Savings, Minneapolis.
   Centrust was allowed to offer $50 million in notes in minimum
denominations of $2,000, while Cenlar was permitted $20 million in
$1,000 denominations. TCF and Security first sold their debt in
minimums of $10,000.
   However, not all of the debt sales are suspect. Alex Sheshunoff,
the owner of the information firm, said the $1 billion offering in
$100,000 minimums by World Savings and Loan Association, Oakland,
Calif., considered one of the best S&amp;Ls in the nation, is probably
an excellent investment.
   Sheshunoff said S&amp;Ls should be permitted to offer their debt
without going through an underwriter, but he said they should
screen out unsophisticated buyers by offering the debt in large
denominations and should clearly disclose that the debt is
uninsured.
   The release of the information by the thrift office, which
followed a story on the subject in Thursday editions of The
Washington Post, drew criticism of the sales from a House Banking
subcommittee chairman.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the financial
institutions panel, called on Wall in a letter to revoke his
agency's permission for the debt sales.
   ``There is no need for me to recite the damage that this kind of
sale caused to thousands of purchasers in the Lincoln ...
situation,'' Annunzio wrote.
   Wall, in a talk to the Association of Government Accountants,
said his agency was obligated to approve the debt sales under
existing laws and rules.
   ``There was no regulation that had been promulgated to prohibit
it. So we could not have disapproved it other than for good and
other kinds of economic reasons,'' he said.
   The thrift agency is planning within weeks to adopt regulations
sharply limiting future subordinated debt sales by S&amp;Ls because
``we've learned from our experiences,'' Wall said.
   Bills restricting the sale of S&amp;L debt have been introduced in
the House by Reps. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Thomas McMillen,
D-Md.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karl R. Bauman, a longtime newsman with The
Associated Press whom President Johnson once said was ``as much a
part of the White House as the press room itself,'' died Thursday
at the age of 87.
   Bauman died of complications from cancer at Holy Cross Hospital,
where he had been hospitalized since Nov. 27, said a nephew, Joseph
J. Madigan of Chicago.
   Bauman, a 38-year AP employee, worked for 32 years in the news
service's Washington, D.C., bureau, covering major federal trials
and the U.S. Supreme Court before moving on to the White House,
where he covered the Kennedy administration and Johnson's 1964
campaign.
   LBJ sent Bauman a letter on his retirement, noting his
three-decade career in the nation's capital.
   ``Since President Roosevelt you have been as much a part of the
White House as the press office itself,'' Johnson wrote on June 27,
1967.
   ``You have outlasted four presidents, and I thought you would
outlast me. The White House seemed a little less colorful today
because of your absence.''
   Bauman's departure from the press corps was marked with ``the
biggest retirement party of anyone in Washington I ever knew in the
news business,'' recalled Frank Cormier, a former AP White House
correspondent who joined Bauman at the White House in 1962.
   Cormier said Bauman ``could be very crusty. He had a
curmudgeonly side on occasion.''
   During a trip with President Kennedy, Cormier recalled, Bauman
found the White House staff had registered him at a hotel as
``Mouk'' Bauman _ Mean Old Uncle Karl.
   ``He was known as Mouk for years,'' Cormier said.
   Bauman was raised in northeastern Kansas and entered the news
business in 1921, when he went to work for The Daily Times of
Leavenworth, Kan., Madigan said.
   In 1923, he moved on to the St. Louis News Press, joining the AP
in St. Louis in 1929. From 1930-35, he worked for the news service
in both St. Louis and the Missouri capital of Jefferson City.
   He was transfered to Washington in May 1935 and worked there
until his retirement, when he and his wife, Frances Lauf of Taos,
Mo., settled in nearby Arlington, Va. Mrs. Bauman died in 1984.
   Bauman moved to a retirement home in Palos Park, Ill., last May
to be near his sister, Elizabeth Ann Bauman, a nun at St. Mary's
College at Notre Dame, Ind., and his nieces and nephews, said
Madigan.

   Vaclav Havel, who only a month ago
was reviled by the official press, said Thursday he would accept
the presidency if necessary to help resolve the country's crisis.
   Appearing at a crowded news conference in the Laterna Magika
theater, the playwright seemed tired but elated by his speedy
transfer from the dramatic to the political stage.
   Thousands of supporters of Czechoslovakia's Civic Forum
opposition movement, which Havel heads, are now sporting
Hungarian-made buttons declaring ``Havel for President.''
   With characteristic humor, Havel told reporters, ``I don't wear
that badge.'' He said he had nothing to do with its manufacture
because ``my connections do not extend as far as Hungary.''
   A shy man, he has repeatedly declined offers to seek political
office. But, when asked Thursday if he would accept the presidency
if offered, he said he would do so under certain circumstances.
   ``I have repeatedly said that my occupation is a writer and that
I have no political ambitions. I don't feel myself to be a
professional politician but have always put the public interest
ahead of my own.
   ``And, if God help us, the situation should develop in such a
way that the only service I could render my country would be to do
this, then, of course, I would do it,'' Havel said.
   He stressed that there is no organized group promoting his
candidacy.
   ``The more democratic and more normal the condition in our
country, the less my role will be,'' the mustachioed writer said.
   Havel has avoided interviews the past two hectic weeks during a
mass pro-democracy movement that forced the Communists to
relinquish their 41-year monopoly on power, ousted most hard-line
leaders and paved the way for a coalition government that could
restore democracy.
   With characteristic caution Thursday, he ducked a question about
when he began to believe that the opposition could triumph.
   ``We have a saying in Czech, `You should not praise the day
before the evening,''' Havel said, smiling.
   As a founding member of Charter 77, eastern Europe's oldest
human rights movement, Havel has spent most of the last 13 years
under police surveillance and served 4{ years in jail for his
outspoken criticism of what he calls ``totalitarian Communism.''
   Asked what he had learned from those years, Havel echoed the
creed of one of his best-known essays chronicling the moral
deformations of Stalinism, ``Living In Truth.''
   ``I have learned that when a person behaves in accordance with
his conscience, and when he tries to speak the truth, behave as a
citizen even when citizenship as such is degraded. It may not lead
to anything _ but it might,'' he said quietly.

   Angolan rebels Thursday objected to a
summit of eight African leaders scheduled to discuss plans for
ending the southwest African nation's 14-year civil war.
   ``The mediation of endless and inconclusive summits by the group
of eight has already proved disastrous to the process of peace in
Angola,'' the rebels said in a statement distributed in Lisbon. It
was signed by rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, leader of the U.S.-backed
UNITA rebels.
   Angola's state news agency, ANGOP, reported Tuesday that the
government would present its latest cease-fire plan to leaders from
Congo, Gabon, Mozambique, Sao Tome e Principe, Zaire, Zambia and
Zimbabwe later this month at their fifth summit on Angolan peace
prospects.
   Angolan government sources said Thursday the summit would be
held in the Angolan capital of Luanda on Dec. 27, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported from Luanda.
   Earlier reports said the leaders might meet Dec. 21 in the
Gabonese capital of Libreville.
   Savimbi's statement from the rebels' southeast Angolan bush
stronghold of Jamba called for direct rebel negotations with the
government. It also restated the guerrillas' confidence in Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko as the only mediator in the conflict.
   Mobutu mediated a cease-fire agreement between Savimbi and
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos June 22 in Gbadolite,
Zaire, but the truce collapsed soon afterward. Later talks ended in
deadlock with renewed fighting.
   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has been fighting to share power with the Cuban-supported
government in Luanda since Angola gained independence from Portugal
in 1975.

<TEXT>
   In a defeat for organized labor, a federal
judge ruled Thursday in favor of a Labor Department regulation that
allows working at home in five apparel-related industries.
   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell's ruling rescinds a ban
on home work in the five industries. He said the Justice Department
regulation represents a ``reasoned'' approach requiring firms
seeking to institute home work to come forward and seek
certification from the government. They also would be subjected to
monitoring by department inspectors.
   The International Ladies Garment Workers' union and two other
unions sued the secretary of labor last January, saying tens of
thousands of workers, mostly immigrant women, would be exploited by
the rule and that the working standards of other workers would be
threatened.
   The five industries affected by the department rule are those
making gloves and mittens, handkerchiefs, buttons and buckles, some
types of jewelry and embroideries. The department this past year
held several public hearings on its proposed rule and has yet to
issue a final version.
   Gesell said the concerns of labor unions about workers being
exploited by home work ``are no doubt valid.'' A ban on home work
in seven industries _ including the five affected by the department
rule _ was adopted by the Labor Department in the early 1940s. Home
workers in those industries are normally paid by piece rate rather
than hourly wages.
   ``The evidence is strong that the conditions present in the
1940s regarding the exploitation of home workers have not
disappeared,'' said Gesell.
   But the judge said the ``sole issue'' before the court is
whether the Labor Department ``provided a reasoned basis'' for
concluding that a certification system is a better means of
enforcing federal labor law than a total home work ban.
   He said the department formulated the rule after nearly a decade
of analysis.
   ``The AFL-CIO is deeply disappointed'' by the court decision,
said Lorrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for the 14.1-million-member labor
federation. ``Removing the ban on home work opens up new doors to
exploitation of workers, doors that were closed over 40 years ago
because abuse ran rampant.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in a statement she was most
pleased. The department's rule, she said, ``is a step in the right
direction toward reconciling some of the demands of work and
family.''
   The labor unions contend the rule contains inadequate safeguards
to prevent violations of laws governing minimum wage, child labor,
maximum work hours, workplace safety and other issues.
   The rule ``may well encourage home workers and their employers
to come forward and comply'' with the Fair Labor Standards Act,
said the judge.
   Gesell said states that disagree with the department's
conclusion remain free to ban home work in those industries.
   The unions have pointed to evidence that the department has
failed to vigorously enforce the total home work ban. The
department attributes that to scarce resources and maintains that a
certification system would be superior to a total home work ban.
   Gesell questioned the possible motives of both sides, saying
that the department's decision to lift the ban may be motivated by
``its sympathy for certain constituences or a certain political
philosophy.'' He said the unions may be motivated by concerns of
its members about the ``threat of economic competition from home
workers and firms employing them.''
   But Gesell said his role is ``not to referee this dispute or to
speculate on how it has shaded'' the debate between the unions and
the government.

<HEAD>Poland Says Any German Reunification Must Be Gradual</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday allowed for the
possibility of a reunified Germany, but said such a state must be
formed gradually and respect Poland's borders.
   In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on the
issue, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told Parliament the
two German states could be joined as part of the process of uniting
Europe.
   He said German reunification ``cannot go ahead'' of the
reunification of Europe.
   ``A reunited Germany will not be created tomorrow or the day
after tomorrow,'' Skubiszewski said. ``Fears and concerns appearing
every now and then, including in Poland, are unjustified, although
alertness is recommended.''
   Asked about German reunification at a news conference in Gdansk,
Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa said he prefers ``no political
changes in Europe, but there should be all kinds of economic
integrations.''
   Western European countries have agreed to form an economic union
by the end of 1992.
   Sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in East Germany in
the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests,
spurring talk of reuniting the two German states divided at the end
of World War II. West Germany has proposed a plan for greater
unity, but East German leaders reject reunification.
   The specter of a powerful, reunited Germany has troubed many
Poles, especially the older ones who recall the 1939 Nazi invasion
of Poland that began World War II.
   A reported surge in anti-Polish sentiment in East Germany in
recent weeks has heightened Polish anxieties.
   Skubiszewski's speech seemed designed to reassure Poles that the
government does not see unification in the near future and will
insist on Poland's current borders.
   Skubiszewski faulted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
program for gradual German reunification, offered last week, for
not making clear that reunification would respect the existing
border between Poland and East Germany.
   Some right-wing West German politicians have called for
recovering the 40,000 square miles of territory that Germany lost
to Poland at the end of World War II. The territory is about
one-third of present-day Poland.
   East Germany and West Germany each separately has recognized the
border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified
Germany would also acknowledge the border.
   ``One can only unite within established borders and without
territorial arguments,'' said Skubiszewski.
   He also said German reunification is unlikely as long as West
Germany belongs to NATO and East Germany to the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact military alliance.

   More than half of the Japanese don't have much
or any admiration for the United States, its economic success or
its people, according to a Business Week poll released Thursday.
   A majority of 1,000 Japanese polled last month also said the
United States is unfairly pressuring Japan on trade issues, but
they added that their country should loosen barriers to trade.
   Forty-two percent of those polled said one of America's biggest
economic problems is that the nation has too many minorities, while
35 percent cited a lazy work force.
   The poll was conducted in Japan Nov. 10-14 by Louis Harris &amp;
Associates for Business Week. The magazine said the results should
be accurate to within 4 percentage points.
   Among the findings, 57 percent said America is unfairly trying
to pressure Japan on trade issues, but 62 percent said Japan could
be more flexible on trade.
   A total of 54 percent said they believe the United States has
had trouble selling products in Japan because its products are not
as good as those made in Japan, 55 percent said Japan was imposing
unfair trade barriers and 52 percent said U.S. companies aren't
trying hard enough.
   Forty-three percent of those polled said they believe Japan
eventually will take America's place as the world's leading
economic and political power.
   A total of 54 percent said they have little or no admiration for
America as a nation, 56 percent have little or no admiration for
its economic success and 63 percent for its people.

<HEAD>Ex-FBI Man Says His Affair With Soviet Woman Stupid, But He No Spy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Miller, the only FBI agent ever
convicted of espionage, said Thursday his affair with a Soviet
woman was ``the stupidest thing I've done in my life'' but declared
he never was a spy.
   ``I love my country,'' Miller said. ``I'm a patriotic kind of
guy. ... I know in my heart I'm not a traitor.''
   The 52-year-old Miller was released from prison last month after
his conviction was overturned on appeal. While awaiting a third
trial he agreed to be interviewed by a group of reporters.
   In the wide-ranging, two-hour interview, the portly former agent
was alternately serious and wise-cracking as he discussed his five
years in prison, his lackluster 20-year career with the FBI, his
extramarital affair with Svetlana Ogorodnikov and his devout return
to the teachings of his Mormon faith.
   ``I am absolutely innocent of any and all of the charges the
government put before me,'' he said, ``specifically that I never
gave that young lady any kind of document and that is the truth of
the matter.''
   Miller's lawyers, Stanley Greenberg and Joel Levine, stood by to
veto questions on the exact facts of the case, but he eagerly
answered most queries.
   Miller was convicted of trading a secret FBI reporting guide for
money, sex and gold. His attorneys claimed he was no spy but a
bumbler who was trying to redeem his lackluster career by
infiltrating the KGB through Mrs. Ogorodnikov, a Soviet emigre.
   Asked during the interview whether he was a good FBI agent, he
said, ``A lot of the time I was a good FBI agent. One of the
exceptions was the stupid, idiotic thing I tried to do with
Svetlana. It was one of the stupidest things I've done. In fact, it
was the stupidest thing I've done in my life.''
   He added, ``I was not a good FBI agent in the sense that I
didn't have sense enough to protect myself. I try to be an open,
honest person and that honesty and openness was misconstrued as a
confession.''
   He declined to blame the FBI for his problems. ``I still have in
my heart some loyalty to the FBI,'' he said, later adding, ``I do
feel I've been mistreated by a handful of people in the FBI.''
   But he insisted, ``I don't have any bitter feelings against
anybody.''
   After two trials, Miller was convicted in 1986 of passing
secrets to Mrs. Ogorodnikov and her husband, Nickolay. His first
trial ended with a deadlocked jury. The Ogorodnikovs pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to commit espionage and are serving prison terms.
   In April, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned
Miller's conviction on grounds that the jury should not have been
told that Miller failed lie detector tests.
   ``I feel I didn't get a fair trial,'' said Miller. ``I got the
impression that the prosecution as well as the judge were not so
much interested in a fair trial or the truth of the matter as to
get a conviction.''
   He refers to his upcoming trial in May as ``Miller three _ it
makes me feel like Rambo.''
   He conceded that his sexual indiscretions with Mrs. Ogorodnikov
and other women brought on his career downfall and the end of his
marriage.
   ``I probably have more guilt over that than any single thing,''
he said. ``I've always tried to be a very moral person and having
five affairs in two years is not very moral. ... I guess I got
caught up in the sexual revolution of the '80s. It could have
partially been mid-life crisis.''
   Miller was excommunicated by the Mormon church for his
extramarital affairs. But he said his faith is stronger now than
ever and it helped him endure five years in federal prison which he
called ``devastating.''

   A 6-year-old survivor of the Nimitz
Freeway collapse during the Oct. 17 earthquake has been fitted with
an artificial leg and ``is in high spirits,'' a therapist says.
   Julio Berumen was given the replacement for his right leg
Wednesday at Children's Hospital, where he has been since he was
freed from the flattened wreckage of his mother's car. His mother
was killed and his 9-year-old sister, Cathy, left the hospital two
weeks ago after treatment for head injuries.
   ``He's going to hate us before it's over, but we're going to
make him walk, walk, walk,'' said physical therapist Debbie Wong.
   Wong described him as ``tough and in high spirits. He is
bouncing right back.'' Julio's crushed leg had to be amputated to
remove him from the wreckage.
   Forty-two people were killed when an elevated section of the
freeway collapsed onto a lower roadway. A total of of 67 people
were killed throughout Northern California in the 7.1-magnitude
quake.
   Julio's father, Pastor Berumen of Richmond, has taken a leave of
absence from his construction job and is camped out on a sofa in
Julio's hospital room until the boy walks out.
   Doctors said Julio may be home for Christmas and should be able
to return to school early next year. He probably will eventually be
able to ride the bicycle he won in a raffle a few weeks before the
quake.
   A special fund to help pay for his medical bills and education
has reached more than $160,000.

   A math teacher who was fired for
refusing to wear a necktie will return to the classroom next week,
school officials said Thursday.
   ``I'll be wearing a good pair of jeans, a cotton denim shirt and
my boots,'' Bill Webb said Thursday.
   For most of his 20 years in teaching, Webb has worn jeans and a
work shirt. The school board instituted a new dress code during the
1988-89 school year calling for a tie and dress pants.
   Webb refused, saying he had signed his contract before the dress
code was in effect. He also contended that the school board
shouldn't be able to regulate a teacher's choice of clothes.
   Webb was suspended several times and then dismissed in December
of 1988 for refusing to conform.
   The reinstatement came after the state Supreme Court said Webb
had to be given his job back while the Mason County Board of
Education appeals a lower-court decision that overturned the firing.
   Rick Powell, Mason County superintendent of schools, said the
reinstatement won't halt the board's appeal to the state Supreme
Court.
   ``One way or another, whether Mr. Webb prevails or we prevail
... my goal is to get the system back to normalcy,'' Powell said.
``And the system is about educating young people.''
   Webb predicts it will take some time to get back into the swing
of things.
   ``I think it will be a little awkward both for me and the
students,'' he said. ``They've had a different teacher this year.
... It's unfortunate that they've had to go this type of thing for
two years in a row.''
   The board is to meet with Webb on Friday, Powell said. Attorneys
for the board and Webb are to discuss back pay, which Webb contends
he is owed for his time off the job.
   Since his firing, Webb has been farming at his home in
Gallipolis, Ohio, and running an auto body shop. Gallipolis is just
across the Ohio River from Point Pleasant, about 50 miles northwest
of Charleston.

   The city's Armenian community gave an ancient
tradition a modern twist, laying on a special meal for the homeless
to honor victims of the Soviet republic's killer earthquake one
year ago Thursday.
   ``We wanted to show our gratitude for all those who helped us,''
said Margaret Zahigian, member of St. Gregory of Narek Armenian
Apostolic Church. She referred to those in the community who
contributed time and aid to victims of the Dec. 7, 1988, disaster.
   ``Feeding the poor is a good place to start,'' she said after
helping serve the first of two meals at the City Mission. She
estimated nearly 200 people would sit down to a turkey dinner.
   ``Forty days after a death, we have a requiem service and a
dinner in honor of the deceased,'' said Florence Karoghlanian,
church council president. Although the dinner is not 40 days after
the deaths _ the biblical time period between the Resurrection of
Jesus and the Ascension _ the meal stems from that tradition, she
said.
   The church in suburban Richmond Heights collected $134,000 in
cash for victims of the quake, which killed more than 25,000
people. The donations will be used as seed money to build a city in
Armenia, church treasurer Harold Zahigian said.
   ``The Cleveland community was very generous in making
contributions, not only money but also clothing and medicine,''
said Matthew J. Hatchadorian, local president of the Armenian
General Benevolent Union. He estimated that there are 1,000 people
of Armenian descent in the area.
   ``We wanted to express our appreciation to all the people in
this community for their response to a horrible tragedy,'' he said.
   Church members prepared turkey, candied sweet potatoes,
Armenian-style rice pilaf, green beans and pumpkin pie for
Thursday's meal. A dozen members volunteered to serve the dinners
to 130 men at the City Mission downtown.
   ``They're expressing their appreciation to the community and
we're thankful,'' said Tony Lewis, who supervises the homeless men
who work at the mission and receive shelter in return.
   The church sent 26 teen-agers to Armenia over the summer to
build a prefabricated house, the first new residence in the
quake-damaged community of Stephanovan.
   The church also was host to five children who were treated at
hospitals in Cleveland and Akron for injuries suffered in the
earthquake. All have returned home, Mrs. Karoghlanian said.
   The quake's one-year anniversary was also commemorated in other
regions of the country. In the Los Angeles area, several Armenian
groups Thursday held candlelight vigils, memorial church services
and fund-raising walk-a-thons for the victims of the earthquake.
   The observances will extend through the weekend with a blood
drive and memorial services at the several Armenian Apostolic
churches throughout the Southern California.
   In New York, the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra closed its
first ever tour of the United States with a special benefit concert
Thursday night at Carnegie Hall in New York City.
   The orchestra, along with American pianist Andre Watts, has
already appeared in Boston and Washington. Proceeds of the tour
will be used for specific projects in the earthquake zones.

<HEAD>General Assembly Votes 91-2 Against U.S. Funding of Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly voted overwhelmingly
in favor of a resolution Thursday that calls on the United States
to stop financing Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   The assembly passed by a 91-2 margin the Nicaraguan-sponsored
resolution against the U.S-backed Contras, who were to be disbanded
this week under a regional peace plan. It asked Washington to obey
a 1986 judgment by the International Court of Justice ordering it
to halt support for the Contras.
   Only the United States and Israel voted against the measure. The
41 abstentions included most of the U.S. allies in Europe and the
Caribbean. Honduras, where an estimated 11,000 Contra forces are
headquartered in jungle camps along the Nicaraguan border, also
abstained.
   In a separate action, the General Assembly decided by consensus
to approve spending up to $40.8 million over six months to send a
650-member border patrol force to Central America.
   The peacekeeping force is intended to deter cross-border raids
by the Contras or any other insurgents and to cut off
weapons-smuggling.
   The United States accuses Nicaragua and Cuba of shipping weapons
to leftist rebels battling El Salvador's government, and the
Contras have acknowledged they are selling weapons to the
Salvadoran rebels.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told the assembly that the
World Court's ruling was one-sided, ignoring U.S. support for the
Central American peace process.
   The United States had said it not believe the world court, based
in the Netherlands and serving as the U.N.'s judicial arm, could
rule on national security issues.
   The court's 15 judges ruled Washington had disobeyed
international law by interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs
with its support for the Contras. The court has no power to enforce
its judgments, however.
   U.S. military aid to the Contras ended two years ago, Pickering
said, and only non-lethal aid is sent to the rebels.
   By contrast, he said, ``Nicaragua's military assistance to the
El Salvador insurgents has again been revealed in the recent plane
crash at El Transito in El Salvador, which revealed weapons
destined for the El Salvador guerrillas.''
   Two dozen Soviet-made SAM-7 anti-aircraft missile launchers were
found in the wreckage of that light plane, which crashed Nov. 25.
   Nicaraguan Ambassador Alejandro Serrano Caldera said U.S.
``aggression'' against Nicaragua continues today. He said U.S.
non-lethal aid to the Contras is actually logistical help in the
war.
   In addition, Serrano Caldera said U.S. meddling in Nicaragua's
internal affairs continued when the U.S. Congress appropriated $9
million for the opposition in national elections set for Feb. 25.
   Under an agreement signed by Central American presidents, the
Contras were to be dismantled voluntarily by last Tuesday. However,
neither the rebels nor the United States were part of that accord.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has proposed extending the
deadline to the end of the month. The region's presidents are
meeting again Sunday in Costa Rica to take up the issue.

<HEAD>Foley Says Defense Budget Cuts `Inevitable'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley,
said Thursday that improvements in U.S.-Soviet relations make cuts
in the Pentagon's budget ``inevitable.''
   Foley's comment came as he and other congressional leaders
praised President Bush's actions at last weekend's meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Malta.
   Bush briefed lawmakers on his talks with Gorbachev and on events
in Eastern Europe and the Philippines.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said afterward that Bush ``probably
heard the most praise he'll hear from Democrats in a long time.
We're all proud of the fact he did a very good job in Malta.''
   Foley called Bush's actions at Malta ``wise.''
   As for the defense budget, the speaker said he does not
anticipate a ``huge, immediate ... peace dividend'' from the
lessening of East-West tensions. ``But, undoubtedly, the defense
budget is going to go in a downward course relative to the gross
national product and relative to government expenditure,'' said
Foley.
   Congress expects that and ``I think it's inevitable,'' Foley
said.
   ``The United States for 40 years has faced a strategic situation
in which the Soviet Union ... posed a threat, as we saw it, to the
security of western Europe and to U.S. interests around the
world,'' he said. ``That hasn't totally disappeared, but it has
(been) so largely altered by events of recent months and the last
couple of years that to maintain a defense posture ... based on
that would be foolish.''
   The Associated Press learned Thursday that Bush has decided to
seek a $292 billion defense budget next year. This year's Pentagon
budget is $286 million; a $6 billion increase would not keep pace
with inflation.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said, ``The president did an excellent job in
converting what was just goiing to be a meeting, a rendezvous, into
an actual summit with substantive discussions.''
   Leahy said Bush and Gorbachev should ``meet every year, with or
without an agenda,'' just as the president meets annually in an
economic summit with leaders of the seven major industrialized
democracies.

   President Bush voiced strong no-strings support
Thursday for Philippine President Corazon Aquino, but congressional
leaders expressed concern about the depth of opposition to her.
   During a speech at a political fund-raiser, the president
departed from his text to praise Mrs. Aquino.
   ``Just last week democracy was challenged in the Philippines,''
Bush said. ``And we stood with President Aquino and we continue to
stand with her and with democracy now. We must not let the
democratic process be overthrown by revolution and by military
takeover.''
   Earlier, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with the
president on a three-state trip to underline anti-drug efforts and
boost Republican candidates, said the administration also has
concerns about Mrs. Aquino and certain of her government's policies.
   ``But that does not diminish the fact that we support her and
her government and we hope they're successful. We support her
government without reservations and do not put strings on that
support,'' Fitzwater said.
   He was asked about comments the day before by a senior
administration official suggesting that Mrs. Aquino's political
future was in doubt _ and that she should be more attentive to
eliminating sources of discontent in her country.
   ``There are a lot of people who are willing to speculate to that
effect in private. But, on the record we would not speculate on
that. She's a democratically elected leader and we want her to
succeed,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   Leases on the two U.S. bases in the Philippines _ Clark Air Base
and the Subic Bay naval installation _ expire in 1991.
   Before leaving Washington, Bush met at the White House with
several congressional leaders who commented afterward.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said, ``It appears that the
immediate threat to Mrs. Aquino's government has been removed, but
it's troubling that some of the rebel military elements (are) among
the most professional and proficient Philippine military.''
   Another Democrat, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said the coup
attempt raised concerns about U.S. aid for the Philippines,
especially regarding the future of the U.S. bases there.
   ``We're obviously concerned about what that money's going to be
spent on, what the government's going to be there,'' said Leahy.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said the coup effort was the
strongest so far and ``our intelligence shows us if they keep
stepping it up grade by grade, she will be in deep trouble.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher set a more
optimistic tone, saying the Aquino government ``has shown
incredible resilience in this situation.''
   U.S. officials expect ``that the Philippine people can pull
together under President Aquino's leadership,'' he said.
   In Houston, Bush concentrated on the anti-drug fight, standing
in a park once overrun by drug dealers and likening domestic
battles against addiction and crime to the struggles for freedom
sweeping Eastern Europe.
   ``As with the new freedom in Eastern Europe, freedom from drugs
isn't something the government can give you. You've got to take a
stand. You've got to take back the streets. And that's exactly what
you did, right here,'' Bush said.
   He spoke to a civic association at Winzer Park and praised the
community for driving drug dealers out of the park.
   ``In recent years, the dream on Main Street became the nightmare
on Elm Street,'' Bush said.
   ``One thousand people swept into the park. One thousand people
swept the drug dealers out. They haven't come back.'' Bush said.
``You were united, you were determined, you were angry and you were
right.''
   On the trip, Fitzwater also was asked about the senior
official's comments on Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called Gorbachev's
economic views ``simplistic'' and said he displayed a lack of
sophistication in his meeting at Malta last weekend with Bush.
   Fitzwater said the official should probably have not used the
word simplistic and that ``we wouldn't use that word.'' At the same
time, Fitzwater said, ``there is a lack of knowledge'' on
Gorbachev's part ``about how free enterprise systems work and how
market economies work.''
   Later, Bush told a Republican fundraising dinner for Sen. Phil
Gramm of Texas that his summit last week with Gorbachev ``was a
success, a chance to improve an important relationship.''
   ``Tensions have been reduced. But there was one area where I had
to speak firmly and frankly and that was on Central America. There
can be no misunderstanding here,'' Bush said. Bush has repeatedly
accused the Soviets' allies in Central America, Cuba and Nicaragua,
of funneling East bloc-built arms to the rebels in El Salvador.
   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, who flew
aboard Air Force One with Bush, said that the event was expected to
yield $2.8 million, which he said would make it the biggest
political fund-raiser in history.
   Fitzwater said Bush decided to mix anti-drug speeches with GOP
fund-raising appearances, here and then on Friday in Denver ``to
dramatize the efforts of the president in that area and keep the
momentum going.''
   Conducting such official business also will reduce the
percentage of the cost of the trip that must be picked up by the
Republican National Committee.
   Bush, who claims Houston as his voting residence, told his
Wenzer Park audience, ``It's always great to be back in Texas. And
especially after that little storm in Malta _ it's great to be back
on dry land.''
   ``The talks in Malta remind us all that we live in dramatic and

   ``That's true not only in Eastern Europe, where people are
seeking freedom to travel and freedom to vote _ but right here in
the U.S.A., where brave men and women have used people power to
fight for another kind of freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from
crime. Freedom from drugs.''

   A Hispanic policeman was found guilty of
manslaughter Thursday in the deaths of two black men, and black
leaders praised the verdict as a just response to the shooting that
set off three days of racial violence.
   Miami Officer William Lozano, 31, showed no emotion when he
heard the verdict in the Jan. 16 deaths of motorcyclist Clement
Lloyd, 23, and passenger Allan Blanchard, 24. The two counts carry
a total maximum sentence of 45 years.
   Circuit Judge Joseph Farina deferred adjudication on the jury's
findings, an administrative formality to allow a pre-sentencing
investigation. He ordered everyone involved to return to court Jan.
24. Lozano remained free on $10,000 bond and had to surrender his
passport.
   The televised verdict by the six-member, multi-ethnic jury
brought relief to an inner-city black community that feared the
trial would spark another round of racial unrest.
   ``It just shows that our system works if people will give it a
chance to work and that there are other ways of impacting the
system than through violence,'' said Willie Sims, a black community
leader who is a member of Dade County's community relations board.
   When the verdict was announced, people in the Overtown
neighborhood where the shooting took place erupted with cheering,
horn-honking and hand-slapping. Men and women broke into impromptu
solo dances.
   By 9 p.m., the downtown area was calm. A report of a man wounded
in the leg in Overtown was possibly drug-related, but not related
to the trial, said Miami police spokesman Armando Villorin.
   About 100 blacks who had met at the shooting site for a march on
the courthouse turned the event into a celebration.
   ``Everyone has been following this from day one,'' said Judy
Wallace, 22, who lives in an apartment building across the street
from spot of the shooting. ``When the verdict was announced,
everyone was relieved and very happy.''
   Miami has been racked by racial unrest four times this decade,
including riots in 1980 and 1984 sparked by acquittals of police
charged in the deaths of blacks.
   But community leaders praised the presence of two black jurors
and the almost gavel-to-gavel live broadcast coverage of the trial
as reassuring the community the trial would be fair.
   ``We were relieved that justice has been served,'' said George
Lubrin, Blanchard's brother-in-law.
   ``We are very satisfied that the verdict came back guilty on
both counts, and that the trial itself was very fair,'' said Barry
Greff, attorney for the Lloyd family.
   Some police were dismayed, feeling Lozano was defending himself.
   ``Most of my members are in shock. We all felt William Lozano
was justified,'' said Richard Kinne, head of the Fraternal Order of
Police, which represents most of the city's officers.
   Asked what the average officer thinks, Kinne replied: ``He's
seriously thinking what he's going to do in a life-threatening
situation. They could become concerned and hesitant out in the
street.''
   The jury had deliberated six hours Wednesday and reconvened
Thursday, deliberating for an additional 1{ hours.
   Defense attorneys and Lozano's family did not offer comment, but
left the courtroom quickly, his wife in tears.
   Lozano, who remains suspended with full pay, talked about his
case later at his attorney's office.
   ``I was not given a fair trial from the beginning. There was a
lot of evidence denied and quashed,'' he said. ``We're going to
look for a new appeal based on the circumstances.'' He would not
elaborate.
   Defense attorney Roy Black said: ``From the beginning, every
major ruling was against us. To even refuse us the right to present
witnesses is bizarre. It was critical for the jury to know the
motivation of Clement Lloyd and why he didn't want to stop and why
he tried to run over this officer. The jury got a false impression
of this case.''
   Prosecutors said Lozano fired unnecessarily at Lloyd, who was
fleeing a police car after a traffic violation. Lloyd died of
gunshot wounds and Blanchard died of injuries suffered in the
resulting crash. Lozano, a native of Colombia, said he fired in
self-defense when the motorcyclist tried to run him down.
   The reaction from Colombians in Miami was immediate.
Colombian-oriented radio station WOCN-AM received 200 calls in the
hour after the verdict, said afternoon news coordinator Fernando
Escobar.
   ``They were unanimous, not one call was against Lozano. People
were expressing their sadness, some were even crying,'' he said.
   But he said there was no talk of demonstrations or any violent
reaction.
   ``The jury returned what we thought was a just verdict. It was a
jury that represents all segments of our society,'' said Assistant
State Attorney John Hogan, the lead prosecutor.
   The January riot left one man dead and 11 others wounded.
Thirteen buildings were set afire, others were looted, and 372
people were arrested.
   Announcement of Thursday's verdict was withheld for about two
hours while police, social workers and community relations
officials fanned out through the city's black neighborhoods. The
courthouse was even evacuated of non-essential personnel.
   Tension was high in Miami until the verdict was announced.
   Rumors of a verdict had grown so strong by Wednesday afternoon
that anxious downtown workers reportedly left their jobs early, and
Dade County Chief Circuit Judge Gerald Wetherington went on the air
to reassure people.
   For police, there were mixed emotions.
   ``This is a highly charged and emotional time,'' said Police
Chief Perry Anderson. ``It's only natural to have personal
feelings, but as a law enforcement agency we have to abide by state
law.''
   He said police will continue their vigil.
   ``We don't anticipate problems,'' Anderson said. ``We will
remain on alert. We'll maintain a high visibility tonight and
possibly down-scale our activities tomorrow.''

U.S. involvement in World War II the next day.
   A career Navy officer, he retired in the early 1960s and devoted

<HEAD>Consumer Advocates Skeptical About New Auto Insurance Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance companies no longer will be
allowed to weight their rates on where a driver lives, according to
new state regulations which already are drawing a skeptical
reaction from consumer groups.
   California's insurance commissioner announced a ban Tuesday on
territorial rating, a move she said will lower rates for urban
drivers and raise rates slightly for rural and suburban drivers.
   The changes stem from Proposition 103, which was approved by
voters in 1988 and requires auto insurance rates based primarily on
a driver's safety record, experience and miles driven.
   The ballot initiative allowed the insurance commissioner to
specify other factors an insurance company could consider. That
left Commissioner Roxani Gillespie to decide whether to allow
companies to continue to take a driver's residence into account, a
factor that has led to much higher rates for inner-city residents.
   ``The commissioner is promising what we want, but her
regulations may deliver exactly what we don't want and thus may be
a fraud and an outright violation of Proposition 103,'' said Walter
Zelman, former executive director of Common Cause and a candidate
for the insurance commissioner's job when it becomes an elected
position in 1990.
   Gillespie, who said she will not run for the post next year,
allowed insurers to rely on many other factors that consumer
advocates said will play the same role as territorial rating. Those
factors include repair costs, health costs and population density.
   She also limited any driver's annual rate increase to the
percentage rise in the national Consumer Price Index and prohibited
auto insurance rate discrimination based on sex or marital status.
   ``The net effect will be decreases for urban (drivers) and small
increases for rural and suburban,'' Gillespie said.
   Drivers with no more than one moving violation in three years
will be guaranteed rates at least 20 percent below those of other
drivers, Gillespie told reporters.
   She said that while a wide range of experts recognize territory
as ``a valid rating factor,'' reliance on area of residence under
her new system would be ``a little softened from what it is now.''
   Jack Murgia of Voter Revolt, sponsor of Proposition 103, said
the regulations are ``ninety percent of what we wanted.'' The
outstanding question, he said, is how great a role a driver's place
of residence will continue to play in rate-setting.
   Harry Snyder of Consumers' Union said Gillespie's rules would
let geographically based rates continue almost unabated.
   The regulations take effect within 90 days unless blocked in
court. A freeze on auto insurance rates will continue until the new
rules are implemented, Gillespie said.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of Continental Airlines has
written to Gov. Cecil Andrus and Boise's mayor apologizing for an
advertisement run in Great Britain belittling the city.
   The Houston-based airlines also has changed its advertising
policy to prevent a similar incident, Continental officials said
Tuesday.
   Marc Johnson, Andrus' press secretary, said an apology was the
least Continental Chairman Frank Lorenzo could do. Lorenzo also is
chairman of Texas Air Corp., Continental's parent company.
   The governor took exception to a jibe in the ads that asked how
often someone would need to go to Boise. Andrus called it a ``cheap
shot'' in light of the 1987 Denver crash of a Boise-bound
Continental flight that killed 28 people, 14 of them Idahoans.
   Mayor Dirk Kempthorne said he appreciated the apology but still
wanted follow-up advertisements in Great Britain aimed at boosting
Boise's stock as a destination for air travelers.
   The advertisement, since yanked from publication, pitched
2-for-1 tickets from London to Denver and other destinations. The
ad admitted there are a few places in the United States that
Continental does not serve, but asked, ``But be honest, how often
do you really need to go to Boise, Idaho?''
   Continental pulled out of Boise and seven other Western U.S.
cities in September 1988, saying it would focus on more profitable
routes.
   Lorenzo wrote in the letter to Andrus and Kempthorne, sent by
fax machine late Monday, that ``my view of advertising does not
include poking fun at any city.
   ``Furthermore, a copywriter could not have chosen a more
unsuitable target for his weak pun. I was appalled to see the
effect of these coinciding mistakes,'' Lorenzo wrote.
   ``Both Idaho and Continental share many unhappy memories brought
on by the Denver accident. I want to continue to do everything
possible to mend the wounds that resulted from the tragedy,'' he
wrote.
   Continental has maintained that the ad prepared by a British
advertising firm was conceived by people who had no knowledge of
the Denver crash and was not reviewed at corporate headquarters
until after publication.
   Art Kent, Continental vice president of corporate communication,
said a new policy has been adopted.
   ``All advertising done overseas has to be approved and cleared
before publication here at the Houston headquarters,'' Kent said.

   Half of all Americans believe communism is
dying, twice the number who thought so nine months ago, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   The survey found views of communism shifting radically as reform
sweeps Eastern Europe, with far fewer Americans now seeing the
Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies as a threat.
   But more Americans feel threatened by China, where authorities
in June suppressed pro-democracy demonstrators. And the poll found
no change in the relatively high level of concern about communism
in Latin America.
   The survey tracked opinion by repeating questions that first
were asked in a Media General-Associated Press poll in March, a few
months before the democratic reform movement gained full force in
Eastern Europe.

   With the Cold War thaw, the Republican Party's
right wing is having a tougher time attracting troops and money to
its conservative causes _ prompting a search for new issues to
replace the Soviet menace.
   ``Saber rattling and the sort of hard-line anti-communism that
have held our coalition together are not going to be as convincing
arguments with the voters, not when you have a majority of the
voters thinking the Soviet Union merely seeks peace like we do,''
said Roger Stone, a Republican political consultant.
   Richard Viguerie, who built a political and financial empire
based on mail-order fund-raising among conservatives, says he's
replacing anti-communism with attacks on Congress as the
centerpiece of his new appeals for dollars.
   ``I plan to make the imperial Congress my No. 1 issue for the
foreseeable future,'' Viguerie said. ``Whether it's going to catch
on as the No. 1 issue, I don't know.''

   Cervical cancer risks increase dramatically
for women who fail to get Pap smear tests at least every two years,
University of Washington scientists report in a study released
today.
   Women who get Pap smears only every three years run a risk that
is 3.9 times greater that cervical cancer will go undetected than
women who have the test annually, according to the study published
in the professional journal Obstetrics and Gynecology.
   The study said the risks increase as the between-test interval
increases and that for women who have no Pap tests for 10 years or
longer, the risk increases by 12.3 times.
   ``The study shows that women should get Pap smears more
frequently than every three years,'' said Dr. Joseph Chu, one of
five physicians who conducted the study at the University of
Washington. ``The risk of having advanced disease goes way down if
the tests are conducted every two years or less.''

<HEAD>IBM Restructuring the Rule, Not the Exception</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When IBM announced a multibillion restructuring
this week it was doing nothing unusual, since almost all the
largest corporations have realigned their forces in this decade
alone.
   It was the third strategy shift in the 1980s for the big
computer company, formally known as International Business Machines
Corp. Almost a third of big industrial companies have changed three
times in the decade, and 50 percent twice.
   In IBM's case, it went after high costs with a plan to save $1
billion a year by eliminating 10,000 jobs and consolidating
manufacturing facilities. It sought to support IBM stock with a
buyback of up to $4 billion in shares.
   Rather than indicating that companies have lost their way, such
moves illustrate the vast technological, strategic, financial and
other forces that are making and remaking marketplaces.
   The latest spate of restructurings began in 1986 and is far more
complex than any that preceded it, according to Prof. Eugene
Jennings, who has studied corporate changes for 35 years and
advised executives on how to handle them.
   In strategic planning today, he says, four elements serve as a
planning matrix. Two of them, market forces and share value, are
externally oriented; two, core technology-expertise and financial
resources are internal.
   These four strategical planning elements, he states, are most
commonly found in today's restructurings, since all play vital
roles in refocusing efforts on the new and developing realities of
the marketplace.
   1. Marketing. The big change is that corporations are finding
they must give equal attention to three growing markets: America,
Europe and Asia. It creates a need to balance operating assets
around three markets, not one.
   2. Share Value. Corporations are realizing that discounted cash
flow _ what's left over at the end of the year after paying
expenses _ is more important than officially reported earnings in
attracting investor attention.
   In Jennings' opinion, the investing public is aware that
earnings are too easily manipulated to disguise weaknesses in a
company. Cash flow, discounted for the cost of capital, is
considered a more reliable indicator of health.
   Companies are, of course, concerned about the price of their
shares. A higher than average price for shares provides a financial
advantage over the competition.
   3. Core Technology and Expertise. These, says Jennings, ``must
be preserved at all costs.'' Preserving them is not easy, since the
hardnosed competitive atmosphere and changing markets mean they are
constantly under attack.
   A common situation today, for example:
   A company whose core technology and expertise is to supply
widgets doesn't have the luxury of continuing to make only widgets
when the marketplace demands widgets encased in a larger system. It
must learn to make the system.
   Among manufacturers, subsystems of several components are
``in.'' For one thing, they may be easier to assemble, service, and
replace. The widget-maker and supplier must protect his widget
expertise by encasing it in a system.
   4. Financial Resources. This concerns the extent to which a
company has access to debt financing and equity capital and at what
cost. The lower the better, of course.
   Among other things, this places a premium on maintaining the
share price of stock. Buybacks of outstanding shares is one way to
do it. Even before its latest buyback, IBM had set aside $6.4
billion for such purposes since 1986.
   Jennings, a Michigan State University professor of business and
adviser to top corporate managers, sees these four elements in a
restless mix that makes strategic planning good for only two to
four years.
   The message is a harsh one for companies accustomed to a slower
pace, but he sees no escape from the rapid rate of change.
Companies simply cannot stay put in their thinking; their
environment is not static. They must restructure.
   An illustration of this can be found in the experience of the 40
``excellent'' companies chosen early in the decade by author Tom
Peters for his book, ``In Search of Excellence.''
   All but eight of the 40, according to Jennings' count, have been
through two restructurings since they were deemed excellent.

   It's 10 p.m. _ curfew
time. Police in camouflage fatigues tell diners sipping coffee at
the Pivoli Gardens they must leave the restaurant.
   Nobody complains.
   ``I don't mind at all,'' said Omi Rahim. ``It keeps all the
troublemakers off the streets.''
   Like others in St. Croix, Ms. Rahim vividly remembers the three
chaotic days after Hurricane Hugo devastated the island Sept. 17
when hundreds of looters plundered stores of everything from food
and clothes to VCRs and jewelry. The authorities say some police
officers and members of the National Guard took part in the looting.
   The turmoil prompted President Bush on Sept. 21 to send 1,100
Army troops, most of them military police, along with 170 FBI
agents and federal marshals, to restore order in the U.S. territory.
   With most stores cleaned out, the looting had stopped by the
time the troops arrived.
   More than two months after the storm, 80 percent of St. Croix
still lacks electricity, water and telephone service. But the
troops were ordered home before Thanksgiving and were replaced by
146 National Guard MPs from Washington, D.C.
   Many of St. Croix's 55,000 residents say it was too early to
pull the troops out.
   ``There's no electricity and there are no phones and we have no
way to call police,'' said waiter Javier Ureta, 31. ``The island is
not ready to have people move around like normal days.''
   Maj. Doug Foster, a U.S. Army spokesman, said that before
leaving the Army set up 14 citizens band stations equipped with
telephones for emergencies. A curfew is to remain in effect until
power and communications are restored.
   St. Croix, 40 miles east of Puerto Rico, was among the islands
hardest hit by Hurricane Hugo as it swept up the Caribbean before
hitting the Carolinas.
   The territorial government has estimated damage at $1 billion in
St. Croix and its sister islands, St. Thomas and St. John. While
the other two islands are bouncing back quickly, officials say
recovery could take years in St. Croix, where the storm's 200-mph
winds damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the houses and buildings.
   Tourism, St. Croix' lifeblood, is a writeoff this season for the
most part. And, despite a construction boom, there are fears of
soaring unemployment because scores of businesses were wiped out.
   St. Croix Hospital, with 250 beds, remains closed and doctors
are seeing patients in tents behind the building.
   Thousands live in roofless homes under temporary blue plastic
roofs or in Red Cross tents as they wait for the relief checks from
insurance companies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   In Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas, the top floor of Bishop Sean
O'Malley's house was blown off, but a box containing his miters
remained in place. In St. Croix, workmen had to retile the roof of
the Cormorant Beach Club, a hotel and condominium complex, and it
has been able to reopen for the winter season.
   Hundreds have fled the island, perhaps permanently. For those
who have stayed to rebuild, life can be a struggle.
   ``When you go without electricity day after day, for weeks, and
you don't have water and you don't have a roof over your head and
there are no phones and you can't communicate with the outside
world ... well, there's a lot of stress,'' said commercial
photographer Carol Lee.
   About 400 linesmen from a dozen states, Guam and Puerto Rico are
repairing lines of 15,000 downed electricity poles. The Virgin
Islands Water and Power Authority has said it could be spring
before electricity is fully restored. Meanwhile, the utility is
investigating reports of some workers charging homeowners up to
$500 to turn power on.
   But children have returned to school, shelters for victims have
closed, and many stores and restaurants along with a few hotels are
back in business, using generators for power.
   Some Crucians, as residents are known, complain that accounts
after the hurricane made the looting appear to be an uprising among
blacks, who make up 85 percent of the population, against the
wealthier whites. They scoff at reports of machete-wielding black
gangs roaming the streets.
   ``I didn't see any white people attacked, but I sensed fear
among the white people,'' said Rena Brodhurst-Knight, publisher of
the St. Croix Avis newspaper, who is black. She said machetes,
commonly used in the Caribbean as tools, were probably mistaken by
outsiders as weapons.
   The U.S. attorney's office has filed charges against 15 alleged
looters, including Adelbert Bryan, commander of the Fredericksted
police who was a gubernatorial candidate and a former St. Croix
senator.

   It is a solemn moment in the show. Hodding
Carter III, a top official during the Carter administration, is
puzzled why the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House
won't comment on Santa Claus.
   When he was in the State Department, he adds, ``not once did I
hear somebody say, or did I read anything, suggesting that Santa
Claus did not exist.''
   But then, the show, anchored and narrated by former NBC
correspondent Jack Perkins, is about Santa Claus, a syndicated
one-hour special called ``There Really Is a Santa Claus.''
   Airing on various nights this month on stations in 123 cities,
it's a light-hearted ``documentary'' about various facets of the
man in the red suit and white whiskers, all of it an effort to
prove he exists.
   Celebrities like Edward James Olmos, Mickey Mantle and Loretta
Lynn are participants, as are men of learning, one of whom believes
in the possibility of flying reindeer.
   Even police in Fairbanks, Alaska, get in the act. One,
responding to a call, asks a homeowner, deadpan: ``He actually was
on your roof? In a sleigh?''
   And, of course, kids periodically get a say in all this.
   The men of learning include a Dartmouth University professor,
John Rassias, a Santa Claus expert, and a Santa's helper, Dr. Carl
Anderson, a psychologist who wrote his University of Texas
dissertation on Santa Claus.
   The reason he did that, Anderson explains, is that ``I was
struck by the intensity of the children's belief and the joy and
excitement that they experienced when they visited Santa.''
   Conceived and produced by David Lowe Jr., a former ``60
Minutes'' staffer, the show examines the matter of Santa from all
angles _ his origins, his flying reindeer, how he knows if you've
been naughty or nice, and so forth.
   In a section dealing with how Christmas toys get to less
fortunate kids, it also slips in a gentle plug for the Marine Corps
Reserve's Toys for Tots campaign, founded 42 years ago by retired
reserve Col. Williams Hendricks.
   The show has its faults, mainly that it gets a bit too cutesy
now and then. But on balance it's a pretty good holiday special,
particularly for tykes, who may find its findings reassuring in a
world that sometimes seems populated by Grinches with souls of
garlic.
   As Anderson, quoting a little boy, puts it: ``That there's
somebody somewhere in this cruel world who loves children and cares
about them _ that's what Santa's all about.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BAH, HUMBUG TO ADS _ Home Box Office subscribers facing a
barrage of Yuletide appeals from urchins to buy those toys the
little ones see advertised on TV might have them watch a half-hour
HBO special, ``Buy Me That!''
   Produced by Consumer Reports, and airing Monday and four other
nights, it takes an on-the-mark look at those deftly edited ads
that exaggerate what you actually get when you buy toys that the
ads suggest fly or talk. It also gives the gimlet eye to ads in
which the announcer furtively mumbles ``parts sold separately,'' or
worse, ``some assembly required.''
   The show does a very mean thing. It gets kids to try some toys
advertised on TV. That some emerge disillusioned is indicated by
one girl who, having grappled with a some-assembly-required toy,
says, ``You have to be some kind of architect or professional
engineer to know how to put these things together ... it's really
confusing.''

<HEAD>`Catch 22' Trap Claimed in School Bible Club Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Some call it a ``Catch-22'' snare, zapped if they do, and zapped
if they don't. That's the predicament claimed for some students at
Westside High School in Omaha, Neb., who want an off-hours Bible
club.
   The problem has surfaced at numerous public schools across the
country.
   Federal courts have issued conflicting opinions about it, and
although Congress has passed a special law allowing for such clubs,
the issue is now before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Several church groups, supporting student rights to form such
groups, contend Westside put a double-nix on it, barring the club
for lack of school sponsorship, although such sponsorship would
make the club unconstitutional.
   Either way, it's out, according to the school board's position,
amounting to a ``self-imposed Catch-22'' for the students, the
church groups say in a brief supporting the students' appeal to the
Supreme Court.
   Efforts at organizing such clubs, strictly by student initiative
and without official school involvement, has had a rocky and
litigious course in many communities throughout this decade.
   Trying to dispel the confusion, Congress adopted the Equal
Access Act in 1984, guaranteeing student religious groups the same
rights to meet in off-class hours as other non-academic,
extracurricular groups.
   The law was based on rights of free speech _ that schools with a
``limited open forum'' allowing students to organize clubs about
politics, dancing, archery, bridge or whatever also must allow
clubs that talk religion.
   But schools have remained skittish about any religious inklings
on campus ever since the 1962-63 high court decisions banning
sponsored prayer or Bible readings.
   ``Some educators have come to believe that all religious speech
must be extirpated from the schools,'' the churches' brief says,
but such a view fails to distinguish between officially sponsored
speech and individual rights.
   Congress sought to end discrimination against student religious
speech but the brief says ``this case shows that at least some
local school officials fundamentally reject each and every premise
on which Congress acted.''
   On the other hand, the American Jewish Committee, which opposes
the act, has filed a brief contending that to allow a school
religious club would ``open the door to organized religious
activities in public schools.''
   In a dispute at the Wiliamport, Pa., high school, the Supreme
Court in 1986 affirmed the right of students to meet for Bible and
prayer outside classtime, but the case was decided on a technical
point not generally applicable.
   Early this year, a federal appeals court ruled against a student
religious group at a Renton, Wash., high school, giving the school
discretion to allow clubs considered even remotely related to
education, but not if religious.
   In the dispute at Westside high school, a federal district court
upheld the school board's refusal to allow a religious club while
permitting about 30 other other clubs, such as for chess and scuba
diving.
   But a federal appeals court overturned that decision, rejecting
the school's position that the various clubs were
curriculum-related.
   That claim, the court said, would allow a school administration
simply to choose whatever clubs it wished for vague reasons, but
then to ``discriminate against particular student groups'' because
of religious speech.
   ``It would be tragic if the court allows a school board to
eviscerate'' the Equal Acess Act ``by declaring all clubs except
relgious ones to be `curriculum-related','' says Oliver Thomas,
general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs.
   Other groups joining in the brief were the Christian Legal
Scoiety, the National Association of Evangelicals, the Presbyterian
Church (USA) and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   U.S. Catholic Bishops have filed their own brief, affirming
rights of students to form voluntary Bible clubs.
   The brief says the action of the school officials, instead of
upholding the Constitution, have created a constitutional problem
``by inhibiting religious activity and conveying a message of
disapproval of religious activity to both the students involved and
the community at large.''
   Oral arguments before the Supreme Court are expected to be heard
this month or early next year, with a decision by next summer.
   Meanwhile, Bridget Megens, who with friends initiated attempts
for a Bible club at Westside High School in 1984 and is now married
and the mother of a young daughter, says: ``I was afraid there
might not be anybody to carry the torch.''
   However, she says about 15 students still are pushing the
effort. ``There are even some kids who are not Christians who are
interested,'' she told the monthly Church and State.
   She says she hopes the dispute will be resolved so her daughter
can belong to a Bible study group at her high school when she grows
up.

   An informal survey by Americans United for the
Separation of Church and State finds 107 church-state conflicts
smoldering in 38 states, mostly about religion and public schools
or aid to church-run schools.
   A variety of other disputes also are were found, such as over
teaching creationism in science courses, prayers at sports events
and taxing of church property, the report says.
   The Rev. Robert L. Maddox, executive of the group, says recent
opinion polls find a large proportion of people backing religious
elements in public institutions.
   He says that while majorities profess support for a ``high wall
of separation'' between church and state in theory, polls indicate
they have difficulty accepting such a wall in practice.

   In the Fatima apperances, Mary predicted Russia's conversion and
a period of world peace, Fox says, and on March 25, 1984, Pope John

   ``Never have we seen such dramatic and rapid changes'' as those

<HEAD>With BC-Cashing In on Drought II, b0389</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   This is a summary of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 and
procedures farmers followed to collect aid.
   The program originally was written to provide cash to farmers
who suffered crop losses of more than 35 percent ``due to drought,
hail, excessive moisture or related condition in 1988.''
   Farmers who lost more than 65 percent of their normal harvest
were required to protect themselves with federal crop insurance
this year.
   The bill covered all crops in all states, not just drought
areas. As its regulations moved from the halls of Congress to the
county offices where the checks were written, the list of weather
conditions eligible for aid grew. It eventually included _
depending on the individual county _ insects, sandstorms, fungus,
high winds and cold.
   The bill required farmers to state their acreage, whether it was
irrigated and-or insured, the normal yield and the actual
production on that acreage. They also had to state the cause for
their loss, and in what manner the land had been farmed.
   Their applications for aid were approved or denied by
three-member committees of locally elected farmers serving as the
government's agents.
   Regulations require only 5 percent of aid applications to be
verified for accurate information, although many offices said they
routinely checked 15 percent. As with other farm payment programs,
paperwork remained at the county offices; no regulation requires
data on individual farms to be routinely forwarded to state or
federal headquarters.
   The relief act stated that payments were limited to $100,000 per
farmer and that no producer with gross revenues in excess of $2
million was eligible for aid.
   Checks were written at the county office. Only county totals of
aid, not individual summaries, were fed into national computers.
Federal agriculture officials have not yet compiled figures on the
amount of aid disbursed based on the crops damaged or on the
specific weather problems cited for crop losses.

   The 1988 drought assistance bill for U.S.
farmers set a record for disaster programs, totaling $3.9 billion
in payments when all applications had been processed.
   This year, with the drought area reduced and the severity
lessened, Congress tightened eligibility requirements and pulled
the purse strings tighter, authorizing less than 25 percent of the
money released in 1988.
   Here are details of the two relief programs:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Money</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Congress authorized $3.9 billion in cash payments to farmers
who could prove crop losses in 1988; the 1989 authorization is $897
million.
   _Both programs set a $100,000 limit per producer on combined
payments for crop losses and livestock relief.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Eligibility Requirements</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Under each program, an applicant could not have a gross annual
income greater than $2 million.
   _Growers had to absorb crop losses if they totaled less than 35
percent of normal production. The programs differed for losses
above 35 percent.
   The 1988 bill encompassed all crops, from such ``program crops''
as corn, wheat and cotton that the government supports with price
subsidies to riskier crops like kiwi fruit or endive.
   The 1989 bill pays on losses of 35 percent to 50 percent only
for program crops. Farmers of non-program crops are paid only if
losses totaled more than 50 percent of a normal harvest. Whether
producers receive aid also depends on whether they participated in
federal commodity programs and bought crop insurance.
   _The 1988 bill provided two tiers of payment. Farmers received
65 percent of a pre-established payment rate _ based on such
factors as market prices and subsidies _ for losses of 35 percent
to 75 percent of normal production; they got 90 percent of the
payment rate if losses topped 75 percent.
   In 1989, the highest payment for any loss was 65 percent of the
payment rate.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Crop Insurance</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Both programs required farmers with losses greater than 65
percent to buy federal crop insurance the subsequent year. Each
bill permitted some instances in which crop insurance could be
waived.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Replanting Penalty</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _The 1988 bill permitted farmers to receive aid on the early
loss of crops such as winter wheat or cotton, even if they
replanted the same acres with different crops and had normal
harvests.
   To prevent such ``double dipping,'' the 1989 law sharply reduced
benefits to farmers who chose to plant replacement crops due to
drought or other weather conditions. Critics said this penalized
farmers who were simply trying to help themselves, and the law was
modified in October to be more generous.
   As modified, aid payments on damaged crops will be reduced only
if the value of the replacement crop is more than half of the
county's average yield, and then only by the value above the 50
percent threshold.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Livestock Provisions</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _Both programs provided help for livestock producers, expanding
existing feed and water programs to relieve drought-related
shortages for herds. Eligible livestock include cattle, sheep,
goats, swine, poultry, horses and mules, and fish raised in
commercial ponds.

   The drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper
Midwest _ perhaps nowhere harder than in North Dakota. More
disaster relief aid went there than to any other state. The third
story in a four-part series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,''
examines how the $3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmers
most in need.

   Carl Grindberg survived the drought with
a $45,000 dose of federal aid. But for this farmer and others, it
was a give-and-take bailout: take the money with one hand, give it
away with the other.
   ``The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' Grindberg
said. ``The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and
chemicals and tires, they got paid. What I'm saying is, the farmer
got the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.''
   The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 million
into North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent
state. The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many
say it also kept the state afloat.
   ``It's what carried us through in 1988,'' said Cass County
extension agent Duane Hauck. ``If it hadn't been for drought aid,
the economic situation all through North Dakota would have been
disastrous. It was the major source of income for most farmers.''
   ``I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought
Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area,'' Grindberg added.
   A study of the $3.9 billion disaster relief program, conducted
by The Associated Press over seven months, found that outside the
Midwest drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousands
of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious
than the normal trials of nature.
   But money did reach areas Congress most intended to aid,
including North Dakota, where it kept some farmers on their land
and may have prevented some business closures.
   ``You might say it kept the state alive,'' said Fred Selberg,
another farmer in this Red River Valley county. ``Everyone in North
Dakota in some way or another was helped.''
   North Dakota, where the drought evoked memories of Dust Bowl
days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received the
most disaster dollars. More than 49,000 producers shared $410.2
million _ about 10.5 percent of the total package. Almost all was
for crop loss.
   The state, the No. 1 producer of hard-red spring wheat, lost
two-thirds of its 1988 crop; millions of normally golden acres
withered to pathetic rows of shriveled brown stumps. But drought
aid cut farmers' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a North
Dakota State University study found.
   Disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banks
and households from $3.4 billion to $2.1 billion, the study said.
Each farm dollar triples as it travels down Main Street into the
economy.
   Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without
drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been
just $6,300. Drought payments added $15,000.
   Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other
drought-ravaged states, including Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and
Wisconsin. The five states together received nearly half the
assistance allocated nationwide.
   Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into
Iowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said.
   ``There was no question it was needed to stave off a major new
wave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Belt
producers,'' said Mark Edelman, a university economist.
   ``Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short
of bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but it
provided a safety net,'' he said.
   It was the same in North Dakota, which has struggled with an
exodus of young, educated people, declining revenues, fading small
towns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade.
   ``From '81 through '86, the bottom pretty much fell out of
everything,'' said Greg Schulz, who farms about five miles from
Grindberg. Good crops the next two years started to reverse the
trend, but drought stalled the recovery.
   ``It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' said
Dwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist. ``Financial aid helps
to alleviate that. The last thing North Dakota needed is more
negatives to push us down.''
   Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the
state still needs ``a good year to get back on our feet,'' Hauck
said. ``We didn't get that in '89,'' he added, referring to
continuing drought in North Dakota's west and south-central
sections.
   In fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12
months ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988's estimated $530
million, Aakre said. Two reasons why: more acres of wheat were
planted this year, and farmers don't have grain reserves to sell at
high prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden.
   Cass County also had a better 1989 crop but expects higher
losses in crop dollars. And while virtually all farmers here
received government aid in 1988, far fewer will be eligible a
second time.
   About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms
in Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres. Wheat, corn,
barley, soybeans, sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grown
here. Last year, production was 60 percent to 70 percent below
normal.
   For Larry Richard, a 36-year-old father of three who farms 1,000
acres near the town of Horace, $39,000 in aid, even coupled with
$55,000 in crop insurance, amounted to ``just enough to break even.
We were able to cover all our bills. That's all I had really hoped
for.''
   If that seems like a lot, Richard, who grows wheat, soybeans and
barley, notes it costs him $150,000 for rent, interest, seed,
fertilizer, equipment and other necessities.
   ``You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is
going to be,'' he said. ``Our investment in farming is tremendous
compared to the average businessman. At least they have a commodity
to sell. We might not.''
   Schulz, who farms 6,000 acres, said that without his $100,000
maximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or lay
off help.
   Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, he
said, ``I was able to mark time in '88. ... Last year we had a
break-even type of year. This year it was break-even. Next year,
we're going to have to start coming around to a profit.''
   Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley,
was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance. His
1989 crop was better but still below normal; he expects to get only
$3,000 in relief payments.
   Grindberg, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mail
part-time, thinks the government last year ``pushed the panic
button on this disaster thing and went too far. In '89, they went
too far the other way I think.''
   ``Disaster aid is political,'' he said. ``Depending on when you
have the disaster depends on whether they sweeten the pot or not.
If it's an election year ... they all get on the bandwagon.''
   But Grindberg will persist.
   ``As long as the banker says go on,'' he said, ``next year's
always the best year.''

   Not all who collected aid from the 1988 drought program were
Midwestern farmers faced with ruin. Cotton farmers in New Mexico,
lettuce growers in New Jersey, a Texas company that raised
potatoes, all collected federal dollars _ completely legally _ even
though, by their own admission, they could have weathered last
year's drought.
   Here are some stories of aid that spilled beyond the boundaries
of the 1988 drought:

   Last year wasn't so bad for Conowingo, Md., dairyman Robert
Dempsey. Good rains in July rescued his feed corn from six weeks of
no rain, and milk prices were up.
   But when he heard about the disaster program, he went over his
records with county officials. Two hours of paperwork and he was
told he qualified for $1,200.
   ``Six hundred dollars an hour,'' Dempsey said with a grin as he
milked his 140 Guernseys in his long, open barn. ``That's not bad
pay. About the same as a lawyer.''
   Dempsey makes no apologies about taking the money. ``It was
there and I took advantage of it,'' he said. But he doesn't favor a
repeat of the program.
   ``It would make people say, I can put crops in the ground and if
it doesn't grow, I'll collect,'' he said.

   Chester Lathem and his family are what you might call
diversified farmers. They run a real estate company; grow wheat,
corn and milo; raise cattle; and own three oil wells that Exxon
operates on their Texas Panhandle land.
   To participate in federal price support programs for their main
crops of wheat, corn and milo, they have to set aside some acres.
In 1988, they planted potatoes on 125 of those acres _ and saw hail
wipe out the crop. Other crops did well.
   But the Lathem family was far from being knocked out of farming
by hail on potatoes planted on excess acres.
   Their farm, formally named the Lico Partnership, received
$134,087 under the drought program, legally exceeding the $100,000
single-farmer aid limit because the partnership is owned by four
family members.
   The potatoes were insured and were expected to gross $223,600
for Lico, according to Lico's file at the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service. Insurance plus the disaster
aid brought $214,153 _ without the expense of harvest, which Lathem
said would have been two-thirds the cost of raising the potatoes.
   Still, he said he only broke even on the potato acreage.
   ``You bet it was necessary,'' Lathem said. ``We wouldn't have
lost the farm over it, but we probably would have had to do some
things differently. It would have been much tougher to go back and
plant crops for the new year. I think it was a good program.''

   The 1987 growing year, plagued by heavy rain and high winds, was
horrible for Ted White, a Chaves County, N.M., cotton grower, but
no disaster payment program existed to help him then.
   White got luckier in 1988, because of the record-setting drought
in the Midwest. Although he had a better crop in 1988, he was able
to collect disaster aid.
   ``I had a cold, cold, cold rain and then that wind that comes
down like on a runway and just cuts the cotton,'' said White. About
half his cotton was wiped out last year, although his irrigated
fields still yielded a healthy 355 pounds per acre and he made
about two-thirds of his normal gross, based on government payment
rates.
   Insurance paid $8,959, and drought aid approved by the local
ASCS office paid $18,285 _ even though the disaster law included
neither cold weather nor high winds.

   Last year was not the luckiest for Carl Race Jr., who grows
apples and corn in Blairstown, N.J. A well that fed a special
trickle irrigation system for some of his orchards dried up. A pump
that watered his corn failed at the height of the dry weather.
   Yet Race weathered the drought well; good production on other
acres eased his losses. So he went to the county office with some
trepidation to inquire about the 1988 drought relief program.
   He learned he was entitled to a payment, but he felt
uncomfortable with government programs.
   ``It's kind of a personal pride thing. You think you're asking
for welfare,'' he said. ``I was thinking some low interest loans of
4.5 percent, that would be great.''
   Instead, he got cash, nearly $12,000.
   ``I sat and wondered, `What am I going to do with $12,000?''' he
said. ``I decided the best way to spend the money was to buy an
irrigation pump.''
   He spent $13,000 for a pump. Then came 1989 and its endless
rains. ``It's been sitting out there, rusting ever since,'' Race,
laughing, said of his new pump.

   Noel Hicks grows winter wheat in the harsh, arrid, wind-swept
Oklahoma Panhandle, the heart of what was once the Dust Bowl. In
early 1988, the weather was dry in Guymon, Okla., although nothing
really out of the ordinary.
   Winds he estimated at 80-90 mph damaged 147.5 acres of irrigated
wheat in February 1988. By harvest time, nothing was worth cutting,
so he just plowed it up, he said. He didn't have insurance.
   Months later, unexpected help arrived in the form of the drought
relief bill _ a program that hadn't even been considered when the
winds took his wheat.
   He collected $11,499.
   ``If the wheat had been good, we would have made twice that
much,'' Hicks said. ``I'd rather have a big wheat crop than take a
check from the government anytime.''

   When drought parched 1988 crops, a relief
program was already in place. But that program, federally
subsidized crop insurance, has been a shambles for years. The final
story in a series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,'' shows even
critics believe Congress must rely on a stronger insurance network
to eliminate big bailouts that follow natural disasters.

<TEXT>
   In 1980, Congress expanded its 42-year-old federal crop
insurance program. The goal was simple: farmers would better cover
themselves against the vagaries of nature and taxpayers would be
spared costly disaster payments to farmers.
   It hasn't turned out that way.
   Sales of crop insurance are well below expected levels. The
program is billions deep in red ink and under scrutiny after years
of alleged mismanagement. Congress still bails out farmers with
huge relief programs like the 1988 drought bill.
   ``Farmers are just the same as Wall Street; they'll take a
gamble if it means money,'' said Ed Jones, a farmer and former
Tennessee congressman who sponsored the 1980 bill. ``They don't
care about insurance if they think they are going to get a disaster
payment.''
   Last year was perfect illustration. With only 13 percent of the
nation's estimated 3.3 million farmers relying on
government-subsidized insurance, they collected $3.9 billion in
direct aid and an additional $1.1 billion in crop insurance
payments.
   An Associated Press study of the 1988 disaster program found
farmers who said they were ``made whole'' by both programs, earning
as much or more in insurance claims and disaster payments as they
would have with normal harvests.
   ``While Congress passed a law for crop insurance to be the
single source of aid in a time of disaster, that never happened
because Congress refused to let it happen,'' said Cliff Fowler, an
assistant director at the General Accounting Office, which issued
20 reports on problems with crop insurance over the last nine years.
   ``Congress would come in with disaster payments _ a free bailout
_ any time there was a disaster,'' said Fowler. ``If you were a
farmer, why would you buy insurance if Congress is going to bail
you out for free?''
   Farmers, wise to the ways of politics, agree.
   ``You'd be crazy to buy insurance if you can count on a disaster
program,'' said M. Donald Clifton II, a Milton, Del., farmer who
received a $100,000 disaster payment for peas and lima beans lost
to drought last year.
   Clifton also collected insurance on some losses, but he is no
fan. ``You could hit it close if you bought insurance on odd number
years and didn't on election years when you're more likely to get
aid,'' he said.
   Yet crop insurance is still considered the best protection for
farmers. A September GAO report said insurance ``is a more
equitable and efficient way to provide disaster assistance than
emergency loan and direct payment programs.''
   Until this decade, crop insurance, begun in 1938, was limited to
26 crops on 10 percent of the nation's farmland.
   That changed with the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980, a bill
to make insurance all farmers' first line of defense against losses
from drought, flood, insects and blight.
   Congress envisioned a self-sustaining program. Farmers would buy
insurance to cover losses, just like any other business enterprise.
Government clerks would be replaced by private agents, selling
policies amid corn rows and wheat fields.
   Most importantly, disaster payments would be phased out.
Banishing these expensive programs, essentially free insurance for
farmers, would trim the budget and make growers more responsible.
   ``There were abuses ... examples of people planting even when
there was no soil moisture and they knew there would be no
harvest,'' said James Johnson, a former staff member with the House
Agriculture Committee. ``Farmers used bad management knowing there
was this entitlement at the end of the crop year.''
   Crop insurance coverage grew slowly over the decade. Last year
only 25 percent of the nation's farm fields were insured, well
under the 50 percent targeted by Congress.
   The figure hit 40 percent this year, but only because farmers
who were paid for losses greater than 65 percent last year had to
buy insurance for 1989.
   The Federal Crop Insurance Corp. has lost money every year since
1980, a total of more than $4 billion. Losses in 1988 alone
amounted to $579 million.
   As the federal tab for crop insurance went up, so did the cost
of the special disaster programs the insurance was to eliminate.
From 1974 to 1980 farmers received $3 billion in disaster payments.
The cost has soared beyond $7 billion this decade.
   Insurance rates are based on the risk insurance companies run of
paying a claim. Car insurance rates, for example, are based on
actuarial study of losses to accidents and theft, the amount of
money the insurer is likely to pay, and the amount of premium money
the company is likely to collect and invest.
   But the FCIC, without a certified actuary until 1986, made
optimistic forecasts that didn't match experience. One example:
premium income grew by only 10 percent from 1982 through 1986,
never exceeding $440 million a year. Yet the FCIC predicted premium
income of $700 million in 1987. It collected little more than half
that.
   ``The program is actuarily unsound,'' acknowledged John
Marshall, FCIC manager since 1988. ``To some extent our problems
are the result of expanding too rapidly. We didn't get our rates,
policies and procedures in place based on good research.''
   Jackie King, a Rehoboth, Del., insurance agent, recalls a policy
that lumped lima beans and snap beans together, even though they
have different growing seasons and risks.
   ``When I called to talk to the man who wrote the policy, he
said, `I didn't know there was a difference between a lima bean and
a snap bean,''' she said. ``I told them I was going to put the
policy under my desk. I wasn't going to insult these farmers.''
   The corporation has been criticized for not keeping a tight rein
on the private insurers who sell and service crop insurance. A 1987
GAO study found farmers were overpaid an average of 31 percent on
claims.
   At present, farmers can insure 50, 65 or 75 percent of their
crop, in the way a car owner chooses a deductible on auto
insurance. Farmers also choose what percentage of market price to
be compensated for. The FCIC subsidizes 15 percent to 30 percent of
premium costs depending on coverage. But rates and regulations
change yearly.
   ``If you're going to insure a 1981 Bronco, you get a quote and
it's done,'' said Ms. King. ``With crop insurance you have
different levels of coverage and different price selections. It can
get really confusing.''
   With all its problems, even critics believe crop insurance is
improving. A recent GAO study found the overpayment rate had
dropped to 16 percent. The FCIC is studying decades of weather and
crop reports to bring premiums in line with the actual cost of
insuring a crop.
   ``We are seeing some bright spots,'' said Marshall.
   But concern remains that the crop insurance program can't
succeed if farmers believe they will be protected by special
disaster programs.
   ``You either have a permanent disaster payment program or you
never do it again and have insurance,'' said Johnson, the former
staff member with the House Agriculture Committee.
   ``You have to do that before people will believe in one system
or the other.''

   To hear Agriculture Department economists tell
it, the nation's farmers, as a group, haven't had it so good in
years.
   That would seem to go against all evidence in plain sight. The
money crunches of the middle 1980s and the droughts of the last two
years were painful, sometimes terminal, for thousands of farm
families.
   No one is sure how many farmers had to leave the land. Annual
estimates by the Agriculture Department indicate that about 267,000
farms ``disappeared'' in the 1980s, a decrease from 2.44 million in
1980 to about 2.17 million in 1989. Of those, 40,000 have dropped
out since 1987.
   But not all of those left farming due to failure, bankruptcy,
foreclosure or drought; each decade realizes some attrition.
Compare the 267,000 dropouts in the 1980s with 516,000 in the
1970s, 1 million in the 1960s and 1.7 million in the 1950s.
   Drought in 1988 hurt vast areas, particularly the Midwest and
upper Great Plains. And in places, the land remains parched, with
too little moisture soaking below the surface.
   But most farmers profited as the 1988 drought reduced crop
yields and drove up prices. This fall, bigger corn yields have
driven down prices of feed grains, making it cheaper to feed
cattle, hogs and chickens but hurting the grain farmers.
   The 1989 corn harvest is up 54 percent from last year's
drought-shriveled crop. Wheat is up 13 percent, and the soybean
crop is 25 percent larger.
   In 1987, according to the department's Economic Research
Service, farmers' net cash income rose to a record $57.7 billion
from $51.8 billion in 1986 and $46.7 billion in 1985.
   The climb marked a turnaround in farm fortunes after falling
land values, high interest rates and heavy debts squeezed hard in
the early 1980s.
   In 1988, net cash income rose further, to $59.9 billion,
reflecting higher crop prices because of the drought, near-record
government payments and sales of stored surpluses.
   This year, with government payments declining, surpluses running
out and farmers spending more to expand crop acreage, net cash
income is expected to decline to $53 billion. In 1990, according to
the latest projections, net cash income may rise to almost $55
billion.
   Net cash income, as defined by the Economic Research Service, is
the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses in a
calendar year. It's money left over that can buy new equipment,
retire debt and support the farm family.
   Another measurement is called net farm income. This includes the
value of farm inventories of grain, cattle, hogs and other
production in a calendar year, along with allowances for other
``non-money'' items such as the value of home-grown food and
xisting dwellings.
   By that reckoning, net farm income rose to $32.4 billion in
1985, $38 billion in 1986 and $47.1 billion in 1987. Last year,
according to this method, net farm income declined to $45.7 billion
_ still the second highest on record.
   Net farm income this year is forecast at about $48 billion, and
it may be in the range of $44 billion to $49 billion in 1990.
   These are national figures, and agency analysts are quick to
acknowledge that many farmers are suffering financially, even when
farmers as a group are enjoying the best of times.
   But even some state statistics show farmers have fared better in
recent years than many would have believed likely in the early '80s.
   For example, net cash income increased in 33 states in 1988
despite the drought, even in some of the states that were hardest
hit.
   On the basis of net farm income, which take farmer-held
inventories into account, 27 states showed increases from 1987.
   ``Overall, the country's farm financial performance continued to
improve in 1988, as it had in 1986 and 1987,'' said USDA economist
Mitch Morehart.
   Morehart noted that direct government payments to farmers, which
peaked at $16.7 billion in 1987, dropped 13 percent to $14.5
billion in 1988. The latest estimates put direct payments at $11
billion in 1989 and $8 billion to 11 billion in 1990.
   Annual records kept by the Agriculture Department indicate that
total farm assets, mostly land, have been increasing since they
dropped to $787.1 billion in 1986. The record high was more than
$1.1 trillion in 1981. This year's assets are forecast at $849
billion and may grow to as much as $890 billion in 1990.
   Total farm debt by 1988 was $138 billion and may drop to $136
billion in 1989. In the early and mid-1980s, U.S. farm debt was as
high as $206.5 billion, including family household debt.

<TEXT>
   Federal bureaucrats and private insurers are
scrambling to rework health insurance benefits, adjust premiums and
spread the word that the end is near for Medicare's year-old
catastrophic health care program.
   In addition, millions of senior citizens are refiguring their
expected 1989 tax bills, the Internal Revenue Service is scrapping
Form 8808 before it hits the printing press, and states are trying
to figure out how they will cover an extra $300 million to $400
million in health care expenses for the poor.
   The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act _ expected to cost $48
billion in its first five years _ was enacted with fanfare in 1988
to protect 33 million elderly and disabled people against financial
ruin from the staggering costs of prolonged illness.
   But even before most of the benefits took effect, Congress voted
last month to dismantle the program because of a firestorm of
protest from senior citizens who complained it cost them too much.
President Bush has promised to sign the repeal measure.
   Under repeal, the Health Care Financing Administration must take
back the extended hospitalization and nursing home coverage it has
offered Medicare beneficiaries for the past year and scrap plans to
provide expanded coverage of drug and doctor bills and other
medical expenses.
   Louis B. Hays, the acting HCFA administrator, said a top
priority for the agency is to get notices out to Medicare
beneficiaries explaining the new limits on their hospital and
nursing home benefits.
   ``We want to make sure that there isn't confusion,'' Hays said.
   The agency also can forget about providing additional medical
benefits that ``we had invested enormous energy and time in
preparing to implement,'' he said.
   The IRS and the Social Security Administration, meanwhile, have
the tasks of rolling back the income tax surcharge on the elderly
and the extra Medicare premium that financed the catastrophic
program. The surtax was canceled completely; the extra premium will
be scrapped at the end of the year.
   IRS spokesman Henry Holmes said taxpayers will be instructed to
ignore two lines on this year's 1040 tax forms _ lines 54 and 55 _
which refer senior citizens to the elusive Form 8808 that never got
beyond the prototype stage.
   Higher-income senior citizens would have used 8808 to calculate
their added income tax liability for the Medicare benefits. Senior
citizens who paid extra amounts in quarterly income tax payments or
through wage withholding to cover the Medicare surtax will get any
overpayments back as part of their income tax refund, Holmes said.
   About 40 percent of the elderly would have paid some surtax _
$22.50 for every $150 of federal income tax liability _ with about
6 percent paying the maximum amount of $800 per person this year.
   Scrapping the tax is the type of last-minute change it is easy
to spring on taxpayers, Holmes said.
   ``Everybody enjoys hearing news that they don't have to pay a
tax that was on the books,'' he said.
   The Social Security Administration, meanwhile, is complaining
that Congress did not give the agency enough lead time to stop
withholding extra Medicare premiums that helped finance the
catastrophic benefits. It may be April or May before extra payments
of about $5.30 a month no longer are deducted from Social Security
checks, with the overpayments to be refunded later. The premiums of
$4 a month during 1989 will not be refunded.
   ``The bottom line is that Social Security will unscramble this
egg, but we did not lay it,'' said Social Security Commissioner
Gwendolyn King.
   The repeal also is causing last-minute maneuvering among private
insurers who will pick up some of the benefits being canned by the
government. About 70 percent of elderly Americans purchase private
``medigap'' insurance to fill the gaps in their Medicare coverage.
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has until
Dec. 15 to draft transition regulations for medigap policies, and
private insurers have until Jan. 30 to revise their policies and
premiums and notify policyholders of the changes. Any changes,
however, will be retroactive to Jan. 1, when the government
benefits expire.
   ``Insurance companies are doing their best, they're just
grumbling about how long it took Congress to make up their mind,''
said Alan Richards of the Health Insurance Association of America.
``It's kind of a `We'll muddle through' situation. We just hope
Congress doesn't change their mind again next year.''
   The association has estimated medigap premiums will rise 20
percent to 25 percent next year due to the combined effects of
rising medical costs and the repeal of the catastrophic package.
   Fallout from the repeal also is reaching state governments. The
repeal legislation left in place expanded Medicaid costs for the
states, while scrapping provisions that would have offset some of
the new expenses, said Alicia Pelrine of the National Governors'
Association.
   ``Grumbling is probably a tame word to describe what is going on
out there,'' Ms. Pelrine said. ``States are already so maxed out on
their ability to accommodate various (federal) mandates ... that a
lot are saying, `We don't know how we're going to pay for this.' ''
   Gerald Miller, executive director of the National Association of
State Budget Officers, said the original catastrophic legislation
would have cost states $900 million, but the repeal bill boosts
those costs by an additional $300 million to $400 million.

   The decade of the 1980s produced a familiar chronicle of wars _
from the savage Iran-Iraq War, which broke out in 1980 and dragged
on for eight years, to the short, bloody fight between Britain and
Argentina over the Falklands Islands, a conflict that blew up like
a South Atlantic storm in 1982.
   Lebanon was ripped apart by civil war and ended the decade as it
started it, in a welter of Moslem and Christian blood. Wars
scourged Africa from the sands of the Sahara rim to the bush of
southern Africa. The dead often went uncounted, and the living
often lived on in the misery of famine and flight.
   Here is a brief look at some major conflicts of the decade:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>IRAN-IRAQ</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The eight-year war was the decade's longest conventional
military confrontation. Casualty estimates vary widely and as high
as 1 million dead on both sides, two-thirds of them Iranian.

<TEXT>
   Continuing civil war between Soviet-backed government and
U.S.-supported insurgents. Moscow withdrew Soviet troops in 1989.
The United Nations estimates that 1.5 million Afghans have died.
Moscow says 13,310 Red Army soldiers died.

Israeli war dead. Almost 300 U.S. and French peacekeeping soldiers
were killed in 1983 bombings.

<HEAD>Superpower Detente Won't Stop Rise in Japan's Defense Outlays</HEAD>

   Japan is not letting its military guard down
despite the easing of East-West tensions in Europe.
   Even after the sessions between President Bush and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev off Malta, officials here say Japan's defense budget will
continue the decade-long upward momentum that has made this country
one of the world's top military spenders.
   ``Our own efforts for improving our self-defense are not
expected to change at the moment,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Taizo Watanabe said at a news conference when asked if the
Bush-Gorbachev meetings would affect Japan's military spending.
   Seiki Nishihiro, vice minister of defense, said recent movements
in Eastern Europe and developments in U.S.-Soviet relations would
be considered. But he told reporters Japan must continue its policy
to reach the minimum standards of military preparedness set out in
1976; Japan and the Soviet Union have yet to sign a treaty to
formally end World War II.
   ``There may have been a change in the Soviets' mood with the
recent detente, but we haven't seen any practical reduction in
force,'' said a Defense Agency official, who requested anonymity.
``We can't start cutting our forces just because they say they plan
to cut theirs.''
   Washington agrees with Japan about Soviet forces in Northeast
Asia but is talking about cutting its own defense outlays. The U.S.
Congress, meanwhile, is calling on Japan to spend more to help make
U.S. reductions possible.
   Under heavy pressure from Capitol Hill, President Bush has
signed a defense bill that urges Japan to increase its military
spending and requires the U.S. executive to negotiate an agreement
for Japan to completely offset the costs of maintaining the 50,000
American servicemen and women stationed here.
   Japan currently shoulders about $2.8 billion, or 45 percent, of
the annual expenses for the Americans in Japan. The Japanese
government has refused official comment on the bill signed by Bush.
   Because of sensitivities caused by Japan's defeat in World War
II, Japan generally has observed a self-imposed ceiling of 1
percent of gross national product on its defense spending.
   Although that mark has been surpassed slightly each year since
1985, critics in the United States call the ceiling artificially
low, and compare it to the annual U.S. defense budget of $300
billion, or roughly 6 percent of GNP. Western estimates put Soviet
military spending at roughly 15 percent to 25 percent of GNP.
   Tokyo has increased expenditures to support its 274,000 military
personnel by about 5 percent in real terms every year since 1980,
and its current defense outlays are roughly equal to those of
Britain, West Germany or France.
   Expenditures under Japan's current five-year plan will total
$76.5 billion, and next year's budget is expected to top 4 trillion
yen ($27.8 billion).
   The increases have helped Japan create a sophisticated
anti-submarine network in straits vital to the Soviet navy in the
northwest Pacific and build up an impressive number of advanced
fighter jets, which by 1990 will reach roughly 300 _ about the same
number deployed by the U.S. Air Force to defend the continental
United States.
   The buildup, however, risks alienating Asian countries that
harbor bitter memories of Japanese invasions before and during
World War II.
   At the same time, anti-military sentiment in Japan, coupled with
a Constitution that bans the use of military force, has restricted
the operations of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, making it
difficult for Japanese politicians to meet U.S. demands or their
own goals to expand the military.
   Katsuyoshi Kimura, head of the opposition Democratic Socialist
Party's Policy Deliberation Committee, said in an interview that
Japanese troops should be allowed to take part in United Nations
cease-fire missions, emergency rescues after natural disasters and
other non-lethal tasks abroad.
   ``All we are suggesting is that Japan do what is common sense
for other nations,'' Kimura said. ``Some people abroad say that
Japan is willing to put out the money, but not the sweat.''
   After an unprecedented victory in Diet elections last summer,
the leading opposition Socialist Party called for declaring Japan a
nuclear-free zone and conducting strict searches to ensure U.S.
Navy ships entering Japanese ports do not carry nuclear weapons.
   The U.S. 7th Fleet is based in Yokosuka, just south of Tokyo,
and a nuclear-free zone would challenge U.S. policy of not
revealing the location of the Navy's nuclear arms.
   Like a wall between Soviet Asia and the Pacific Ocean, Japan is
both a first line of defense against the Soviet military and a
crucial U.S. ally should war break out.
   About 60 percent of all Soviet ground and air force divisions
and 90 percent of the bombers in the Far East are deployed near
Japan, according to ``Defense of Japan 1989,'' a Defense Agency
report. The Soviet Pacific Fleet, the largest in the Soviet navy,
has its home port in Vladivostok.
   The Soviets also have about 10,000 soldiers on the southern
Kurils, several small islands off Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost
island, the report said.
   Japan claims the islands, known as the Northern Territories,
which were occupied by the Soviets after World War II, and the
territorial dispute has kept Japan and the Soviet Union from
signing a treaty officially ending their World War II hostilities.
   U.S. Ambassador Michael H. Armacost, in a recent interview, said
Soviet forces in the region ``far exceed any defensive
requirements,'' and meaningful reductions have not been made.
   ``To date, the reductions they have foreshadowed do not have
much effect on the forces that are located in the Northeast Asian
region,'' he said.
   Even so, Karl Jackson, Bush's assistant National Security
Council adviser, said ``no one but a fool'' would risk waging war
with the U.S.-Japan alliance in the northern Pacific.
   ``If the two largest economies in the world can maintain
relative harmony, all other potential adversaries must, of
necessity, come to our table,'' he said in a recent speech in
Washington.

   China's decade-long shopping spree is over for
now, squelched by a government austerity program that has pushed
the nation precariously close to recession.
   Color televisions, an item the Chinese once needed patience and
good connections to obtain, are piling up by the millions in
warehouses.
   The nation's top refrigerator maker, Wanbao, has slashed prices
by up to 30 percent in some places because of poor sales.
   In Shanghai, the nation's industrial hub, sales of televisions,
washing machines and cameras were all down more than 50 percent in
October compared with a year earlier.
   Retail sales totaled 607 billion yuan, or roughly $164 billion,
in the first three quarters of the year, down 8.2 percent from the
same period in 1988 if inflation is taken into account.
   Never before in the 10 years of China's market-oriented reforms
have sales declined so sharply. On the contrary, the enormous
demand for consumer goods in China had led to sales leaps over most
of the past decade.
   Sales of televisions, for example, went from 1.8 million in 1979
to 26.6 million last year, a reflection of how consumerism has been
an important element in the Communist Party's economic
restructuring. But now it seems spending money is almost the
exception, not the rule.
   ``People are saving their money because the economy is getting
worse and they see hard times ahead,'' said a woman office worker
in Beijing.
   She said the bonuses she receives on top of her salary have been
sharply cut since the ``chaos'' _ the military crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement last June _ and that many workers were now
receiving no bonuses.
   Western economists say consumers have been reluctant to spend
money for a couple of reasons. First, they have been hit with
mandatory purchases of government bonds, imposed by the state to
finance rising deficits. Second, banks are offering attractive
interest rates to depositors to keep money out of circulation and
help restrain inflation.
   Urban incomes were down 4 percent in October from a year earlier
due to inflation and disappearing bonuses, state statistics show.
   The conservative leadership that has gained dominance since June
also has imposed new ``luxury taxes'' on some consumer goods to
dull the nation's appetite for items no longer deemed appropriate
for plain-living socialists.
   A 20-inch color TV now sells for 3,000 yuan, or about $810,
double a factory worker's annual income. The cost includes a new
600-yuan consumer tax and a 300-yuan tax to cover imported parts.
   Outwardly, the government is complacent about the decline in
retail sales, saying it is a sacrifice that must be made to cool
the economy and bring down inflation.
   The government's spending slashes and tight money policy begun a
year ago have reduced inflation from 30 percent to less than 10
percent.
   Gong Zhaorong, a senior official in the Light Industry Ministry,
told the Chinese press recently that sales of durable goods are
down because people are ``no longer worried about inflation and
many people have already made major purchases during last year's
panic buying'' that accompanied the rapid rise in prices.
   Bank deposits nearly doubled in the first three quarters to 100
billion yuan, or about $27 billion, another sign that the
government had reined in the wild spending habits of 1988.
   But economic retrenchment has come at a heavy price. Industrial
output fell 2.1 percent in October, the first decline in the past
decade of reforms. Tens of thousands of smaller factories, lacking
credit to pay debts or buy raw materials, have stopped production.
   Major machinery and electronics businesses alone accrued losses
of 769 million yuan, or about $208 million, in the first nine
months of the year, and built up stockpiles worth 23.8 billion
yuan, or about $6.4 billion, up 68.9 percent from a year earlier.
   Many factories, committed to rigid state plans that oblige them
to meet certain quotas, have gone on producing and piling up
inventories.
   Refrigerator production was up 13.4 percent through October even
though sales were down at least 16 percent. Factories produced 7.5
million color TVs, up 5.8 percent, even though 2 million sets sat
in warehouses.
   One Western economist said the current credit squeeze and
suppression of consumer demand could have the desirable effect of
driving producers of shoddy, low-quality goods out of business.
   But the economist said China should use its current economic
breathing space to restructure outmoded, inefficient industries.
``We don't see any concrete things happening,'' she said.
   The official China Daily said Chinese analysts are concerned
that the huge buildup in savings represents a formidable purchasing
potential. That could deluge the market again in a panic buying
spree if consumers felt prices might start rising sharply.
   Despite the current lull in buying, China still faces a
voracious consumer market of 1.1 billion people where vast numbers
of people still do not own two of the hottest ``desirables'' _ a
television and a washing machine.
   Slackened demand already has brought down prices on many
consumer goods. The price of a washing machine in Beijing's
bustling Wangfujing shopping district, for example, now is about
920 yuan, or $248, vs. 1,000 yuan in May.
   A saleswoman at one supermarket said a bottle of Maotai, a
much-prized sorghum liquor, was marked at only 92 yuan, or $25,
down from 200 yuan a few months ago.
   ``Since the `chaos,' people are unhappy at heart, so they are
unwilling to spend so much,'' she said.

   After a remarkably peaceful campaign,
Chileans will choose a president Thursday for the first time in 16
years.
   The door then will open for the departure from the presidency of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who has ruled since the armed forces
overthrew the government of Marxist Salvador Allende in 1973.
   But it does not necessarily mean the 74-year-old general will
fade away.
   The election is seen as a vote on the Pinochet legacy, and
virtually all polls give the opposition a substantial lead over a
right-wing candidate. But even Pinochet's critics are accepting
some of the many profound changes brought by the military leader.
   Three men are bidding to succeed Pinochet:
   _Patricio Aylwin, a 71-year-old law professor and former Senate
president, supported by a coalition of 17 moderate and leftist
opposition parties.
   _Hernan Buchi, 40, a former finance minister under Pinochet
backed by right-wing forces.
   _Francisco Javier Errazuriz, 47, a wealthy, conservative
businessman.
   Voters also will pick 38 senators and 120 members of Congress'
lower House of Deputies, a decisive step in the long road back to
democracy.
   If no one wins the presidential race by more than 50 percent of
the vote, a runoff will be held in January or February for the two
front-runners.
   Aylwin has been given a commanding lead in virtually all
pre-election surveys, and his two opponents acknowledge they are in
a race against each other for the second runoff slot should Aylwin
fail to win half the total vote.
   The new government is scheduled to take office March 11.
   Although the election is certain to bring radical changes to the
political life of Chile's 12 million people, much of the
free-market economic program crafted by Pinochet's administration
is expected to remain intact.
   ``So far, our transition to democracy is the most peaceful, less
traumatic in Latin America, and that's the result of a stable
economy,'' said Jaime Ravinet, a close aide and spokesmen for
Aylwin.
   ``That's why the platforms of all three candidates emphasize the
need for political changes to rebuild democracy, while, despite
some differences, agreeing on the need of maintaining an open
economy,'' he said in an interview.
   Chileans pitched themselves enthusiastically into the first
presidential campaign since 1970, when Allende won by a slim margin.
   Pinochet toppled the Allende government in a bloody coup Sept.
11, 1973, during a period of social and political disorder.
   In the current campaign, street vendors in the main cities have
been doing a brisk business selling lapel pins, cigarette lighters,
pens, stickers, match boxes and other objects with the names and
photos of the candidates.
   Noisy motorcades have toured the streets, especially on
weekends, with thousands of followers, mostly young people, waving
party flags and promoting their candidates.
   Hundreds of campaign rallies have been held throughout the
country. A spokesman for the Aylwin campaign said the candidate
made as many as 15 speeches in a single day. Buchi ended his
campaign with a marathon, 11-stop tour up and down the
2,800-mile-long country.
   Radio stations enjoyed a financial bonanza broadcasting the
candidates paid political advertising. Television time was limited
to 20 free minutes daily divided among the three presidential
candidates, and the same amount for congressional contenders.
   Authorities have reported only very sporadic and minor incidents
of violence. There was little of the open tension that was evident
when voters in an October 1988 referendum rejected a military
proposal to extend Pinochet's presidential term to 1997. That
defeat forced Pinochet to call this presidential election.
   The first years of Pinochet's rule were marked by harsh
repression of leftists. Many were tortured and killed, and
thousands were forced into exile. Human rights groups here and
abroad say they have documented about 750 cases of dissidents who
disappeared after being arrested by secutity agents.
   Dealing with the emotional demands for justice for human rights
violations during the Pinochet years will be one of the most
sensitive problems facing the future government.
   Pinochet has warned he will not allow trials of the military and
that ``if one of my men is touched, the state of law will be
broken.''
   Aylwin has said he would deal with the problem ``combining the
virtues of justice and prudence,'' and ``we will not seek revenge,
but truth and justice.''
   Even after handing over the presidency, Pinochet will retain
considerable power. He has vowed to remain as commander of the
country's 60,000-man army until 1998, which is permitted by the
constitution written by his government in 1980. The opposition, and
even some moderate rightists and retired military officers, have
called on Pinochet to retire.
   Under Pinochet's instruction, the army command across the street
from the presidential palace is being refurbished, and Pinochet's
opponents fear it will be just one of several power bases he will
continue to control.
   His administration has been pushing through a series of
last-minute laws that would limit the powers of the future
government.
   ``As do all dictators, Pinochet is trying to leave essential
matters firmly tied up after his departure,'' said Ricardo Lagos, a
socialist and a leading opposition figure.
   One new law gives the Central Bank autonomy in setting monetary
and credit policies. Pinochet, however, agreed to include two
opposition economists in the bank's five-member council.
   Another law allowed Pinochet to create a National Television
Council to control the issuing of TV broadcasting licenses.
   Yet to be passed is controversial legislation giving the
military virtual independence. It prevents the government from
cutting the defense budget, limits the presidenti's power to
appoint commanders-in-chief and strips the Senate of any right to
approve the promotions of generals and admirals.
   The opposition has said it will work in the new Congress to
repeal or change those laws.
   Ravinet, Aylwin's spokesman, said one of the ``basic tasks'' of
the new government will be ``to work in Congress along with
democratic forces, even right-wing ones, to change that
legislation.''
   Pre-election surveys give Aylwin 47 percent to 57 percent of the
total vote. His principal threat comes from Buchi, who is shown in
the polls with 27 percent to 37 percent of the vote. The polls
indicate Errazuriz has only a remote chance of capturing more than
about 15 percent of the vote.
   Buchi is credited with the economic policies that have produced
five years of growth, stability and low inflation and has won
praise among bankers and businessmen at home and abroad.
   However, the economic bonanza does not seem to be helping his
campaign, in which he tried to stress his independence from
Pinochet after 12 years in his administration.

   Here are brief sketches of the candidates
in Chile's presidential election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PATRICIO AYLWIN _ An ex-senador and former president of the
Christian Democratic Party, the country's largest, Aylwin was
nominated by an opposition alliance of 17 leftist and centrist
political groups. Virtually every opinion poll gives him a
commanding lead over his two opponents.
   At 71, he is the oldest candidate and was already a prominent
politician when Gen. Augusto Pinochet seized power in a 1973 coup.
   Considered somewhat right-of-center, Aylwin initially supported
the military takeover, but became disillusioned with Pinochet's
strong-arm tactics and reluctance to hand power back to civilians.
He gradually joined the ranks of the government's outspoken critics.
   He is known as an able negotiator with a low-key, conciliatory
style, and he was the official spokesman for the opposition
alliance when it successfully campaigned for the ``no'' vote in a
referendum in October 1988, on a proposal that Pinochet remain
president until 1997. That defeat forced Pinochet to call elections
to pick a successor.
   In the campaign Aylwin has pledged to re-establish full respect
for human rights and civil liberties and to increase spending on
social programs. He has said he plans no major changes in Chile's
free-market economic program.

<TEXT>
   HERNAN BUCHI _ Pinochet's finance minister from 1985 until last
May, Buchi is considered the principal architect of a free-market
economy that has produced five years of steady growth and low
inflation.
   Buchi, 40, is an all-around athlete who runs several miles
daily, climbs mountains and jumps horses. With a master's degree
from Columbia University's business school, he joined the Pinochet
adminstration in 1975 as an Economy Ministry aide and rapidly
ascended the bureaucratic ladder.
   He is considered highly intelligent but slightly eccentric. His
trademark is a roughly trimmed page-boy haircut that once prompted
Pinochet to dub him ``my Prince Valiant.'' One of the slogans of
his campaign has been ``Buchi is different.''
   Despite an international reputation as an able technocrat, he
entered the race as a political novice. Indeed, he withdrew for
several weeks in May and June, declaring he was too shy to be a
candidate. He returned, he said, because of a sense of patriotic
duty.
   Backed by conservative businessmen and rightist political
groups, he has campaigned as the ``can-do'' candidate. He has
promised a million new jobs during the next four years and said he
will spend more on health and education.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FRANCISCO ERAZZURIZ _ From a prominent Chilean family that has
produced several presidents, Errazuriz has dedicated most of his
adult life to amassing wealth.
   The 47-year-old entrepreneur has built a commercial empire that
consists of some 30 businesses including mining and fishing
interests, automobile concessions, a fruit exporting company and a
supermarket chain. All told, he employs about 8,000 workers.
   Characterized by his opponents as a populist, he has promised
free health care and education to all Chileans. He is backed by a
few small political groups.
   He describes himself as a ``centrist-centrist'' and says his
candidacy offers Chileans an alternative to the traditional choice
between leftist and rightist candidates.
   His nickname is ``Fra-Fra.'' One of his principal campaign
slogans is ``No more bla-bla. Vote for Fra-Fra.''

<HEAD>Andrew Young Candidacy To Put New Formula to Test</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Looking back, black political analysts see two
threads linking the major victories of 1989 _ seasoned candidates
who came up the Democratic ladder the methodical, old-fashioned
way, and campaign themes that de-emphasized race in favor of
broader, mainstream issues.
   Looking ahead, they see Andrew Young.
   The two-term mayor of Atlanta will test that strategy next year,
a black candidate in quest of white votes to become governor of
Georgia.
   A month after the elections in which Virginia chose a black
governor, and black mayors were elected for the first time in New
York and three other cities with white voter majorities, the Joint
Center for Political Studies sponsored a forum on what those
contests may tell future candidates.
   ``The next test is going to be Andy Young,'' said political
scientist Joseph P. McCormick II of Howard University.
   Young's style and strategy reflect some of the winning ways
shown by L. Douglas Wilder in Virginia and David Dinkins in New
York this year. But political campaigns are not portable, and there
are major differences, too. Young plays down the comparison, saying
that except for the fact that all three of them went to Howard,
``and we all happen to have the same skin color, there isn't a lot
we have in common.''
   One thing they have in common is a record to run on, political
apprenticeships the Joint Center analysts saw as vital ingredients
in the black victories of 1989. Wilder has been in Virginia
politics for 19 years; Dinkins has a 23-year record in New York.
Among other black mayors elected last month, two were incumbents,
two were state senators, two had long experience on city councils.
   ``In their political experience and their coalition approach,
Wilder and Dinkins represent a growing trend among black
politicians,'' said Dr. Cheryl Miller, a visiting scholar at the
Joint Center. ``An increasing number of them are becoming viable
candidates for top positions by climbing the conventional political
ladder.''
   Young came to politics from the civil rights movement after
serving as an aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. He was
elected to Congress, became U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
and has served two terms as mayor of Atlanta.
   Another thread is the course the analysts called
``de-racialization,'' playing down what are seen as black issues in
favor of themes that appeal to a broader constituency.
   Dr. Charles Jones of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va.,
said the Wilder campaign was designed around issues without racial
implications. He ran as a centrist, gaining vital votes for his
support of abortion rights while at the same time advocating a
balanced budget, supporting the death penalty and backing
Virginia's right to work law.
   For Dinkins, the issues were different but the style was
similar, campaign aide Hulbert James said.
   Both candidates kept their distance from Jesse Jackson during
the fall campaign, although James said the political structure and
cadre built for Jackson's 1988 presidential primary campaign was
essential to the Dinkins organization.
   James, who also worked for Jackson, counseled against
de-emphasizing the black vote in the process of reaching out to
white voters.
   That's a challenge for any politician trying to broaden his base
by reaching out for new supporters without ignoring or offending
old ones, especially for a black candidate seeking a breakthrough
to white voters.
   In his effort to turn out black voters in Virginia, Wilder
appeared each Sunday in seven to 10 black churches, campaign visits
he made with as little fanfare as possible, Jones said.
   As Young begins his race for governor of Georgia, there are
parallels in both issues and strategy. Race obviously will be a
factor, but it won't be an issue in the Young campaign; he is
telling voters he can bring to Georgia the kind of progress in
economic development Atlanta has seen in the past eight years. His
emphasis is on experience, qualifications and his record in office.
   Young boasts of his support in the Atlanta business community.
His campaign chairman is Griffin Bell, the former attorney general,
a white, conservative Democrat. Hobby Stripling, the former mayor
of Vienna, Ga., once president of the Georgia Municipal
Association, is to manage his campaign.
   Young promises to go anywhere and talk to anyone to get his
message across. As if to demonstrate, he dined one night last month
at a redneck cafe in Marietta; for the occasion, the owner _ a
supporter _ took two racist records off the jukebox.
   Young's recognition and approval ratings give him an early edge
in what is likely to be a five-way Democratic primary next year.
But he faces a major obstacle that did not confront Wilder, the
likelihood of a runoff primary.
   Just under a quarter of Georgia's voting age population is
black. Young is a skilled and attractive campaigner. There's a good
chance he will get more votes than any other Democrat in the
primary, but the crowded ballot would make it unlikely any
candidate could gain the 50 percent-plus that is needed for
nomination without a runoff. And in a two-way Deep South race
against a white candidate, the odds would be tougher. Win that, and
he'd have to do it again next November against a white Republican.
   And if a centrist black candidate loses next time?
   Howard University's McCormick had an answer.
   ``One thing that's going to happen is Jesse Jackson's going to
say `I told you so.'''

   As the 1980s dawned, communism was on the march
again, this time on the backs of Soviet soldiers entering
Afghanistan. Andrei D. Sakharov was on his way to exile for saying
it was wrong.
   As the decade closes, the red tide that Lenin dreamed would
cover the world appeared to be receding. Some even said that 72
years after the Bolshevik Revolution, the dream already had died,
despite the determined efforts of a peasant's son from southern
Russia to remake it for the 1990s.
   In the 1980s, years of official lies, brutality, empty store
shelves and mind-boggling inefficiency caught up with the Soviet
Union and then with its allies. Promising paradise for the laboring
masses, Soviet-style socialism could not save three out of four
potatoes from rotting before they reached the plate. Meanwhile, the
West prospered.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's selection as Soviet Communist Party chief
on March 11, 1985, divided the decade between the cozy downward
spiral of Leonid I. Brezhnev and his proteges, and a revolution in
the revolution.
   Gorbachev exorcised from Soviet hearts the terror of the
midnight knock on the door. He declared Afghanistan  and materialism, the
ideology could not exploit that world view for the good of the
working man.
   Lenin's revolution, said Boris Pestov, a 23-year-old Moscow
worker, ``was just a seizure of power by one party, the Bolsheviks,
and nobody else needed it.''
   A East German man watched police beat people trying to jump
aboard a train to West Germany. ``I saw them beat children,'' he
said. ``That was when my wife and I decided to leave.''
   British communist Martin Jacques said the system that regarded
itself as the deepest expression of the laws of history had been
``overtaken by history.''
   Defenders of the system claimed that it could be reformed. ``I
don't think socialism is kaput,'' said Egon Krenz, named in
mid-October 1989 to reform East Germany. ``I think the
disfigurements of socialism are kaput.''
   But several weeks later, Krenz himself was kaput, swept away by
the party on the same day it expelled Honecker.
   Alexander Dubcek, the Czechoslovak communist leader whose
reforms were crushed by Soviet tanks in 1968, could stand before a
half-million people on Prague's Wenceslas Square 21 years later and
proclaim, ``The ideals of democracy, freedom and humanity live on.''
   Gorbachev acknowledged the events of the 1980s as the fruit of
communism's stormy history.
   ``Our past defies a simple, straightforward interpretation,''
the Soviet leader said. But he conceded, ``This country has failed
to create for its people the conditions of life which are natural
for a civilized state.''
   A few Soviet politicians proposed the heretical _ to remove
Lenin's body from its Red Square mausoelum and bury it. But
Gorbachev kept faith in the dynamism of Leninism to direct the
world on a new path of using the scientific revolution for the
benefit of all.
   ``The idea of socialism as we understand it today is, above all,
the idea of freedom,'' he said.
   His foreign minister and close adviser, Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
said the era of worldwide struggle with capitalism was over.
   ``As for the question of which of the two existing social
systems will ... prove to be the best in giving people greater
freedom and well-being,'' he said, ``let us leave that for future
generations to decide.''

   The Earth shook, erupted, collapsed, caught fire and spawned
vicious storms with regularity through the 1980s, killing tens of
thousands of people around the world. But the decade's cataclysms
also included new forms of man-made tragedy.

<HEAD>A Mounting Toll: Victims of a Plague</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It was the great untold story of the 1980s. Or was it in the
newspaper every day?
   Suddenly, an unusual number of people in their prime were dying
_ ``after a long illness,'' their obituaries often said.
   Though frequently written with respect for personal or family
wishes, the vague death notices deflected early public attention
from a toll that would mount to almost 70,000 Americans, victims of
a virus, discovered only in 1983, that infected an estimated 6
million to 8 million people worldwide by the end of the '80s.
   Halfway through the decade, the death of movie star Rock Hudson
personalized for many Americans what had been a faceless plague,
seemingly limited to ``risk groups'' of homosexual men,
hemophiliacs and intravenous drug users.
   By then, the infections and cancers that could drastically
shorten the lives of those infected with the virus had a name,
acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ AIDS.
   Quickly, other well-known names in the arts and public life were
drawn into the patchwork of torn lives symbolized by an immense
quilt spread in front of the Washington Monument.
   Just as the quilt has grown too large to be shipped around the
country for display, the roster of the dead can only be represented
symbolically by this short list:

<HEAD>Scientific Camps Still Sorting Out Cholesterol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Americans wend their way through the season of
holiday goodies and then decide what diet to choose for the New
Year, they face a smorgasbord of scientific updates and debate over
cholesterol.
   A 2-year-old government campaign to get people interested in
knowing how much of the fatty substance is in their arteries has
made cholesterol a popular topic from cocktail parties to
medical-screening booths in shopping malls.
   Researchers are releasing new studies detailing how excess
cholesterol _ an essential building block of cell membranes, sex
hormones and Vitamin D _ in the blood clogs vessels and causes
heart attacks.
   Food manufacturers are devising new products to capitalize on
the findings, splashing ``cholesterol-free'' banners across items
ranging from cupcakes to peanut butter, which never contained
cholesterol anyway.
   News media have kept the public's curiosity piqued with the
views of a small but vocal group of critics, including scientists.
They say the public is being frightened needlessly, many people
won't benefit from the low-cholesterol diets, and money is wasted
to try to get America to change the way it eats.
   How bad is cholesterol? How hard should people work to avoid it?
And how much will that help increase their chances of living longer?
   Researchers have spent hundreds of millions of federal dollars
trying to answer those questions; many top scientists are convinced
of the results.
   ``The evidence linking elevated blood cholesterol to coronary
heart disease is overwhelming,'' a group of them said recently in a
statement by the American Heart Association and the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute.
   Population studies, clinical trials, genetic tests and animal
experiments show that high levels of blood cholesterol clog
arteries and increase the risk of heart disease, they said, adding
clinical trials show lowering cholesterol levels by diet or drugs
decreases subsequent occurrence of heart disease.
   ``The direct evidence ... is strongest in middle-aged men with
high initial cholesterol levels,'' but also strongly suggests
cutting cholesterol is likely ``to decrease coronary heart disease
incidence in younger and older men, in women, and in persons with
more moderate cholesterol levels,'' they said.
   Two of the largest studies to date suggest that a 1 percent
reduction in blood cholesterol translates into a 2 percent
reduction in the risk of developing coronary heart disease, they
added.
   Those studies _ the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, involving
more than 3,800 middle-aged men, and the Framingham Heart Study of
over 5,000 women and men _ have been supported by others suggesting
greater benefit, they said.
   However, critics of the anti-cholesterol campaign contend it has
misled people by excluding mention of other major contributors to
heart disease, America's No. 1 killer, which claims more than
500,000 lives a year.
   One critic, Dr. Robert E. Olson, professor of medicine and
pharmacological science at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook, says only about 20 percent of a person's heart-disease
risk is attributable to blood cholesterol.
   An estimated 40 percent is hereditary and the rest is due to
other causes, chiefly smoking and high blood pressure, he said.
``We think there's too much hype in the marketplace and even in
these educational agencies. Everybody's sort of afraid of their
food and afraid of their cholesterol, often without medical
surveillance.''
   Dr. Fredrick J. Stare, Harvard nutrition professor emeritus and
co-author of ``Balanced Nutrition: Beyond the Cholesterol Scare,''
agrees. ``We don't think the National Cholesterol Education Program
gives enough attention to other risk factors that are more
important _ smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, lack
of a reasonable amount of activity and stress.''
   Dr. Eliot Corday of Los Angeles, past president of the American
College of Cardiology, said he objects to cholesterol-lowering
efforts for people over 65.
   ``Over 65, there's no proof there's any benefit,'' said Corday,
formerly a member of the advisory council to the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute, where he felt ``very, very outnumbered''
by ardent cholesterol opponents.
   Elderly patients ``try very hard not to touch a bit of
cholesterol,'' Corday said, even though ``it's a damn fool thing to
stop eating eggs and meat when they need the nutrition. They get
anemic.''
   The British Royal College of Physicians recommended in February
that checking family histories for heart attacks is more important
than cholesterol testing, said Victor Herbert, professor of
medicine at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital. ``I agree with them.
If a lot of people in the family didn't have heart attacks, you're
not going to have one.''
   Cholesterol testing becomes appropriate if the family history
suggests a genetic tendency to heart attack, he said.
Cholesterol-modifying efforts should begin only if blood levels are
high for so-called ``bad cholesterol'' _ LDL, or low-density
lipoprotein _ and low for so-called ``good cholesterol'' _ HDL, or
high-density lipoprotein.
   Olson, Corday and Herbert were on a panel assembled in September
by the Council on Science and Health, a consumer education group
partly funded by the food industry, to offset what they call the
cholesterol ``scare.''
   Part of their message was that only 15 percent of the population
have blood-cholesterol levels putting them clearly at greater risk
for heart attacks.
   That level is generally agreed to be 240 milligrams per
deciliter of blood, and people testing that high ``should be seeing
a physician... They should not be self-medicating themselves'' with
diet changes, said Elizabeth M. Whelan, the council's president.
Besides, lowering cholesterol dietarily is difficult at best and
impossible for many; not everyone responds the same way.
   Confusion also prevails about what to modify in the diet, with
undue emphasis placed on cholesterol, Herbert said. ``We make three
times as much cholesterol from dietary fat as from dietary
cholesterol. Too much (dietary) cholesterol is not the culprit. Too
much saturated fat is the culprit.''
   Dr. John C. LaRosa, chairman of the task force on cholesterol
issues for the American Heart Association, says critics ``are not
really saying anything different'' from the government scientists.
   Their guidelines are unchanged since being introduced two years
ago as part of the National Cholesterol Education Program, which
recommends that all adults learn their blood-cholesterol level and
aim for a level below 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Those
with levels of 200-239 are considered borderline high, not
requiring treatment unless they have two other traits that increase
their risk for heart disease, including hereditary tendency and
being male.
   People who head for shopping malls or other public places to get
their cholesterol checked should be wary, though. The Department of
Health and Human Services said last month that such screenings can
be inaccurate, pose health risks and frequently fail to provide
counseling or physician referral.
   Those with confirmed levels of 240 or above are at high risk and
should get HDL and LDL testing. If warranted, treatment should
begin with diet and exercise, and should proceed to drugs only if
that approach fails.
   The scientific basis for the guidelines ``is probably more solid
than for any public health venture that I know of,'' said Dr.
Daniel Steinberg, a professor of medicine at the University of
California at San Diego.
   Steinberg was chairman of the federal 1984 Concensus Development
Conference panel that gave rise to the assault on cholesterol.
   ``It has been tremendously effective in bringing in people who
have been previously unwilling to listen to lifestyle
modifications,'' said Dr. Nancy Dickey, of Richmond, Texas, an
American Medical Association board member.
   Seventeen European nations in 1987 reached the same conclusions
as the U.S. panel, and the Canadians did so later, Steinberg said.
``This is not sort of an off-the-wall conclusion by Americans who
are gung-ho against cholesterol.''

<HEAD>Restoration Ecology: Turning Back the Clock on Nature</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaving nature to repair itself won't
counter the damage caused by people, say park managers hoping to
restore the grassy marshes and hardwood hammocks of the Everglades
to their turn-of-the-century condition.
   If nature were allowed to take its course in Everglades National
Park, the hardy melaleuca tree, an Australian invader, could take
over and displace every native plant _ already the condition in
some tracts near the park's borders.
   Proponents of restoration ecology call it the park management
philosophy of the future, and say park managers abdicated their
responsibility when they left Yellowstone National Park, for
example, to recover from fires that damaged more than two-fifths of
the 2.2 million-acre park.
   ``Basically they're doing nothing,'' said Thomas Bonnicksen, a
Texas A&amp;M professor who recently lectured to a group of Everglades
scientists. ``By and large, they're standing back and proclaiming
every little blade of grass that comes up a masterpiece of God's
work.''
   ``Restoration is nothing more than looking back at what we had
when we set the areas aside,'' he said. ``In many cases,
particularly in North America, the national parks resemble very
little what they were when they were set aside.
   ``Our goal is to replace and increase the biological diversity
on this planet that we've lost, and we are convinced that simply
declaring places as reserves, putting fences around them and
standing back and watching them is going to lead to a reduction in
biological diversity because the areas around the preserve are
ignored and the areas in the preserve are degraded.''
   The National Park Service sees ``a lot of value in some of the
principles'' of ecological restoration, said spokesman Duncan
Morrow in Washington.
   For example, the agency is trying to eject some unwanted,
non-native animals _ notably burros in the Grand Canyon and Death
Valley and European wild boar in the Great Smoky Mountains, Morrow
said. ``Some of the major intrusions which seem to be susceptible
to management we have already undertaken to remove. Others we are
looking at finding ways that might work.
   ``You'd have to temper what seem to be desirable goals with some
sense of what can, in fact, be accomplished.''
   Restoration ecology is practiced most commonly on a small scale,
on grasslands, wetlands, lakes and forest tracts. But the Canadian
park service adopted the concept for its sprawling Banff National
Park, said Bonnicksen, a director of the 1,200-member, 18-month-old
Society for Ecological Restoration.
   In choosing a target date as a guide to what a restored park
should look like, 1900 has been a common reference point for the
Everglades.
   ``What is it that we really want to do? Until we can put this
down straight in our minds, we're going to flounder,'' said George
Gann-Matzen, who grew up on the edge of the Everglades, worked in
the park and now is a consulting restoration ecologist.
   Tree ring studies, soil chemistry, old photographs, historic
land surveys, an analysis of pollen and charcoal fragments in pond
sediment and other methods offer clues to the type and prevalence
of vegetation at a given point in time.
   Restoration work can involve anything from planting vegetation
that was known to be in a disturbed area at the benchmark date to
managing lightning fires to leave a historic blend of trees.
   At the Everglades, hydrologists tinkering with water delivery
for 10 years have been trying to re-create a natural
rainfall-driven system they hope will bring wading birds,
alligators, panthers, deer and fish to old haunts.
   ``It's a tradeoff. The alligator prefers deeper water conditions
than the wading bird,'' said Bob Johnson, the park's hydrologic
program manager. ``The idea is to come up with some range of
hydrologic conditions.''
   The Nature Conservancy estimates a minimum $10 per acre for
minor restoration, Gann-Matzen said. His firm charges $100 per
acre, and highly disturbed areas cost $10,000 to $15,000 an acre to
reach a maintenance condition, which then requires regular followup.
   Restoration may be more attractive in the Everglades than other
parks because the signs of trouble _ a stunning drop in wading
birds and threats to numerous animal and plant species _ are
obvious, Bonnicksen said. ``The changes that take place in the
forest are not as easily seen by the untrained eye as the changes
that take place in a place like the Everglades.''
   If restoration ecology is pursued in the Everglades, he said,
``It may in fact turn out to be the first national park that
actually is managed to restore its historic integrity, and it may
serve as a model for other national parks.''

<HEAD>Federal Lab Develops Devices to Track Bees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Behind the security gates at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, researchers are quietly preparing for an
invasion. They've come up with one device to tell friend from foe
and another to track the enemy.
   The invaders began their advance about 40 years ago and now are
massing in Mexico for a final assault expected some time next year.
   No need to hustle down to the gun shop _ these invaders are
aggressive Africanized bees, sometimes known as ``killer bees''
because they have killed animals and people. They've also disrupted
honeybee colonies.
   Researchers at the federal laboratory here have developed a
hand-held sensor that can distinguish between the tamer domestic
honeybees and their more aggressive cousins, and a prototype of a
device to track the Africanized bees using a solar-powered,
infared-pulsating, microchip bee backpack.
   Neither device falls directly into the work done by the nuclear
engineers and electronics specialists at the U.S. Department of
Energy lab. But they were intrigued by parallels with their work in
connection with radiation monitoring.
   The $339 noise sensor, dubbed a ``Buzz Buster,'' is ready for
market, said engineer Howard Kerr, who developed it largely in his
spare time. ``I've been to Venezuela twice and Mexico once with
this thing and it works like a top.''
   Kerr, an amateur beekeeper, got started a few years ago when
told by a federal agricultural official that for some unexplained
reason the Africanized bees that were released from a Brazilian lab
make a louder sound in flight.
   The resulting Buzz Buster allows monitoring of a bee colony from
a distance to determine whether there are any Africanized bees
buzzing inside.
   While working on the Buzz Buster, Ker called in Chip Taylor, a
University of Kansas bee expert, who said what researchers needed
was a way to track bees, particularly during mating. That sparked
the idea for the microchip backpack.
   After a year of research and $100,000 in seed money from the
lab, Gary Alley's team has developed a transmitter about one-fourth
the size of a postage stamp that sends an infrared beam more than a
1 kilometer. An 8-inch telescope with a special sensor detects the
beam, which can't be seen by the naked eye.
   Alley allows that the transmitter, at about 65 milligrams, is
still 15 milligrams too heavy for a bee to carry, and work on a
computerized tracking system hasn't even begun. But ``I think we
have proven the concept,'' he said. ``There are certainly some
refinements that need to be made. But I think the concept is
feasible.
   ``Today, I couldn't give you a field demonstration of putting
one on a bee. But several major hurdles have been crossed.''
   But he said the hardest work has already been done, and the main
job now is to get more funding to carry on.
   ``We've gotten interest from a broad spectrum of agencies, none
of whom are interested in honeybees,'' Kerr lamented. ``There's a
lot of things that people would like to be able to track with a
very inconspicuous transmitter attached to it.''
   NASA thinks the transmitters might be used for equipment
inventories aboard spacecraft, and there have been inquiries from
people who would like to use the microchip to track animals, birds
and insects, Alley said.
   There also has been interest from the Defense Department and
``how would you characterize it? _ the FBI,'' he said.
   Even if the transmitter isn't ready by the time the Africanized
bees reach the United States, Taylor said, it will be developed
eventually because of the number of possible applications. ``This
is a technology that has to come along. If it doesn't come along
right now, it's got to come along in the future.''

<HEAD>Scientist Develops Process To Clear Up Blurry Pictures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computerized process to sharpen blurry
photos by breaking them into millions of pieces and reassembling
them could be a boon not only to family albums but also to police
who use photographs to solve crimes.
   State police used A. Murat Tekalp's process when they
investigated the death of a 7-year-old boy who was struck by a
vehicle while he was camping out on a hill behind his home. The
only evidence was a faint trace of tire marks on the boy's tent.
Police clarified the photographs and concluded that the boy was
struck by his father's pickup truck. The case has not gone to
trial, but state police Investigator James Booth said the process
was essential.
   There are ``dozens of scenarios'' in which it could be used,
such as photographs of license plates, documents and vehicles, said
Gerald B. Richards, chief of the FBI's special photographic unit in
Washington. ``If you've got one big case it works on, it's
golden,'' he said.
   Tekalp, a University of Rochester electrical engineering
professor, has only developed the process for still photographs,
but he said moving pictures are his next subject. The computer
process uses a high-resolution scanner to divide a negative into
more than 2 million pixels. Calculations then are made about what
caused the blur, the computer sorts the information and produces a
clearer image, and then a new negative is made.

<HEAD>Scientists Show How Acid Rain Kills Red Spruces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nitric and sulfuric acids in rain are
killing mountain forests in the East by damaging the foliage _
crippling photosynthesis _ and by upsetting trees' nutritional
balance, a researcher says.
   ``This finding is a surprise because sulfuric acid from acid
rain was shown in previous studies to be harmless to crop plants,''
said Jay S. Jacobson, who based his findings on five years of field
and greenhouse experiments.
   ``We have demonstrated that sulfuric acid at concentrations
similar to those found in acidic mist and cloud-water seriously
weakens the foliage, thus impairing the tree's photosynthetic
process. At high concentrations, it kills the needles outright,''
said Jacobson, a plant physiologist at Cornell University's Boyce
Thompson Institute for Plant Research.
   While sulfuric acid destroyed the foliage, nitric acid _ a form
of nitrogen fertilizer _ upset the trees' balance of nutrients, he
said. ``All plants need nutrients from the soil to grow. If we give
them too much of one nutrient such as nitrogen fertilizer from the
atmosphere and not enough of others the trees would develop chronic
nutritional deficiencies, a factor detrimental to the health of the
affected tree in the long run.''
   Scientists have long suspected that acid precipitation has been
the cause of mountain forest decline. Red spruce, which grow at
high elevations across the Northeast, are important for the pulp
and paper industries.
   Sulfuric acid is formed in the atmosphere when sulfur oxides
from the combustion of coal and oil undergo chemical reactions.
Nitric acid is produced by internal combustion engines and from the
combustion of oil and coal.
   Jacobson's findings will be published next year in the Canadian
Journal of Forest Research, the Water, Air and Soil Pollution
Journal, and Physiologia Plantarum in Sweden.

   When Charles Wagner pulled a whopper
rainbow trout from the Elkhorn River last summer, his state-record
catch spawned an idea.
   Officials marveled that the 11-pound, 3-ounce beauty thrived in
springwater fed in part by an abandoned coal mine, and want to make
it a fish hatchery.
   ``Trout are extremely fragile,'' said Ed Hamrick, director of
the state Department of Natural Resources. ``They need so many
factors in order for them to perpetuate themselves naturally.''
   ``Most people, when they think of a coal mine, don't think of a
hatchery,'' said Don Phares, state assistant chief of cold water
fisheries.
   Good sites for trout hatcheries are hard to find because many
count on natural springs for water, Phares said. He and U.S. Rep.
Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., chairman of the House mining and natural
resources subcommittee, insist water conditions at some old coal
mines are just right to produce the big ones.
   Water draining from coal mines is usually very acid because of
the residue of high-sulfur coal. The mine that feeds the Elkhorn
was always low in sulfur.
   Phares and Rahall refused to name the mine or give its location
until it can be purchased. Congress will take up the project next
year; it must approve $2.5 million to buy the mine and build the
hatchery.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state Department of
Natural Resources would build the hatchery, with a series of
concrete runways eight feet wide by 100 long to produce up to
200,000 fish a year, Phares said. The mine drainage would be
recirculated, with some outside water added for volume.
   The prototype hatchery could spawn new life for many old mines,
said Jim Zoia, staff director of the House subcommittee. ``There's
a lot of potential in the Appalachian area.''
   Ed Hayne Jr. of Charleston, vice president of West Virginia's
southern chapter of Trout Unlimited, said there are high hopes for
the hatchery. ``Being a big trout fisherman, I think it's needed
and it could very well turn out to be a big economic boost to
McDowell County.''

<HEAD>Conference Board: Consumer Confidence Off in November</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Consumer confidence in the economy fell in
November but remains relatively strong, the Conference Board said.
   A survey of 5,000 households nationwide showed that buying plans
for houses and cars are soft and that Americans are slightly less
optimistic about their expectations for the economy in the coming
months.
   The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, released
Wednesday, registered 114.4 for November, the lowest since November
1988.
   Twenty-six percent of survey participants said current business
conditions are good, down from 28 percent in October and the lowest
level in more than a year. But the percentage who thought the
economy was bad also fell, to 15.3 percent from 16.9 percent.
   Respondents' outlook for economic conditions six months from now
showed 17.4 percent thought conditions would improve, the lowest
since April.
   In a separate report, the Conference Board said the volume of
help-wanted advertising in 51 major newspapers increased in
October. The group said want-ad volume was rising in 69 percent of
the newspapers, compared with 55 percent in September and 35
percent in August 1988, but down from 84 percent a year ago.
   The board's help-wanted advertising index rose to 150 from 148
in September, but was down sharply from 161 a year ago.
   ``There is no question that labor market activity is slowing
down, as is the economy in general,'' Conference Board economist
Ken Goldstein said. ``The data on want-ad volume suggests that
while the labor market is cooling off we are not on the verge of a
recession.''
   The Conference Board is a non-profit business organization that
conducts economic research and provides forums for businesses to
exchange information.

<HEAD>Campeau Seeks to Reassure Suppliers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. has sharply criticized a major credit-rating
company for reportedly telling wholesalers to stop shipping
merchandise to Campeau's department stores _ an action that could
do severe damage to the chains.
   The criticism came in a letter Wednesday from Campeau executive
Russell S. Davis to Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive officer, Charles Moritz. A copy of the letter, which was
dispatched in response to a New York Times article, was made public
by Toronto-based Campeau.
   The New York Times reported in Wednesday editions that Dun &amp;
Bradstreet had informed its clients that it no longer was advising
them to ship goods to retailers owned by the Canadian retail and
property company.
   The newspaper quoted Dun &amp; Bradstreet spokesman Bill Doscher as
saying the company ``is no longer providing guidelines on shipments
to the Campeau stores to our clients.'' He declined to elaborate,
the Times said.
   Calls late Wednesday seeking comment from Dun &amp; Bradstreet
weren't immediately returned.
   Goods for the peak holiday shopping season are already stocked
in Campeau's 140 stores around the country, including
Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Goldsmiths's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus and
Rich's.
   But if manufacturers hold back on further shipments of clothing,
home furnishings and other items, Campeau-owned stores could be
short of spring merchandise.
   Previously, Dun &amp; Bradstreet advised manufacturers that they
could sell each of Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. divisions as much as $250,000 worth of
merchandise at wholesale cost.
   But the Times said Dun &amp; Bradstreet informed manufacturers by
telephone on Tuesday that Campeau's financial situation looked
bleak because it hadn't received any formal bids for
Bloomingdale's, the 17-store upscale chain that Campeau has put up
for sale to generate much-needed cash.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet also reportedly mentioned the interest payments
Campeau owes early next year on its heavy debts as a reason for
concern.
   Davis, chief financial officer of Federated and Allied, said Dun
&amp; Bradstreet's advisory was based on ``wholly inaccurate and
misleading information _ information that ... has the potential for
doing considerable harm to our business.''
   He said Dun &amp; Bradstreet should have contacted Campeau to get
the facts before altering its position.
   Davis said Campeau suppliers so far have been very supportive
despite a ``preponderance of market rumors and the uncertainty
created by the spread of misinformation ...''
   The actions reportedly taken by Dun &amp; Bradstreet are
``professionally irresponsible and entirely inexcusable,'' he said.
   Plans for the sale of Bloomingdale's are on schedule, he said.
Friday is the deadline by which initial bids must be submitted and
Davis said Campeau has received expressions of interest from
numerous parties.
   ``In fact, the process for the sale of Bloomingdale's is moving
along exactly on schedule,'' Davis said in the letter.
   ``Further, we have every reason to believe that the sale of
Bloomingdale's will be concluded satisfactorily, and within the
publicly stated timeframe, which anticipates definitive action in
the early part of next year,'' he said.
   The head of Bloomingdale's, Marvin S. Traub, has said he would
like to lead a buyout of the chain but there hasn't been any
indication that he has secured adequate financial support for his
plan.
   Traub traveled to Tokyo last week and said he had ``serious,
constructive conversations with parties'' that may join in a
possible buyout.
   Another party that has publicly disclosed an interest in
Bloomingdale's is Crown American Corp., a privately held company
that is one of the country's major shopping mall developers and
owns the Hess's department store chain.

<HEAD>Fed Sold Dollars Heavily In August-October Period</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States spent nearly $6 billion from
August through October to stem the dollar's rise and keep the
currency in the trading range set with other major industrialized
nations, the Federal Reserve reported.
   The quarterly foreign-exchange report released Wednesday by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed the Fed and the Treasury
sold $5.871 billion in exchange for West German marks and Japanese
yen during the three months ended Oct. 31.
   The New York Fed said the government sold a total of $3.289
billion for Japanese yen and $2.582 billion for West German marks.
   The move, the government's second-largest unloading of dollars
ever in a three-month period, comes on the heels of the
record-setting sale of $11.92 billion in the quarter ended July 31.
   The dollar initially got a boost during the August-October
quarter from a spate of favorable economic data. Because of the
figures, which indicated the economy was not as sluggish as
previously believed, the Federal Reserve was not inclined to push
interest rates lower _ which kept returns relatively attractive on
dollar-denominated securities.
   Gains in retail sales and employment and a better-than-expected
trade report helped boost the dollar to its high during the period
of 2.00 West German marks and 148.98 Japanese yen on Sept. 15.
   But a meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations in
Washington later that month produced a sharply worded statement
criticizing the dollar's rise. The group _ which includes the
United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and
France _ favors a relatively weaker dollar, which is seen as
helping reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit.
   The Group of Seven called the dollar's rise inconsistent with
long-run fundamentals'' and said a further rise could ``adversely
affect prospects for the world economy.''
   The bulk of the Fed's intervention, which was coordinated with
other leading central banks, occurred in the weeks leading up to
the G-7 meeting and in several weeks following the gathering.
   ``Activities after the (G-7 meeting) were forceful,'' said Sam
Y. Cross, a New York Fed executive vice president who presented the
report to reporters. ``We did act quite forcefully to reinforce the
policy statement'' of the group.
   ``Since that time the dollar has trended downward,'' Cross said.
   By early October the dollar had plunged to 1.8650 West German
marks and 138.60 Japanese yen.
   By mid-October, the upward pressure on the dollar had fully
eased. Interest rates in Europe and in Japan _ traditionally far
lower than U.S. rates _ were higher, thereby shrinking the
advantage the United States had in terms of return to investors and
reducing demand for dollars.
   Furthermore, more recent reports indicated sluggishness in the
U.S. economy that raised speculation the Federal Reserve might ease
credit to help prevent a recession.
   The spotlight shifted to foreign currencies, particularly the
mark, which was bolstered by West Germany's bright economic
prospects and the beginnings of a massive reform movement in
Eastern Europe.
   The dollar now is trading at about 1.76-1.77 marks and 143-144
yen.
   Currency traders are often keenly aware of the activities of
central banks in the open markets, but the Fed's policy is to
comment only well after the fact. The Fed does not provide any data
on intervention by foreign central banks.

   A Florida company is recalling a
non-prescription eye wash because of bacterial contamination that
could cause serious infection, the Food and Drug Administration
said.
   The product, made by the Dansol Division of Ocumed Inc. in
Sarasota, Fla., is Valumed brand irrigating eye wash sterile
solution in four-ounce plastic bottles carrying lot number N4209.
   The lot number is stamped in ink on the bottom of the bottle.
The eye wash is labeled as being manufactured for Moore Medical
Corp. of New Britain, Conn.
   About 1,400 bottles were distributed, the FDA said.
   The contaminated solutions could cause infection in a scratched
or damaged eye. But the FDA said Wednesday that no injuries have
been reported.
   The product had been used on nine corneas awaiting
transplantation at an unidentified Seattle, Wash., eye bank, but
the corneas were discarded, the FDA said.
   The agency said it collected and analyzed samples of the eye
wash after it received a complaint. The samples were found to
contain Pseudomonas cepacia, a bacterium that could cause serious
eye infection in eyes that have undergone surgery or that are dry
or irritated.
   Consumers should return the product to the place of purchase,
the FDA said. Ocumed is alerting Moore Medical's clients that the
product should be returned to Ocumed.

   Publishing and information services giant
McGraw-Hill Inc. is trimming more than 1,000 jobs, or 7 percent of
its full-time positions, and taking a big charge against its
earnings in a cost-cutting realignment.
   But Wall Streeters sent the company's stock lower Wednesday in
what analysts said reflected disappointment with the company's
earnings projections for 1990 despite the cutbacks.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, McGraw-Hill closed down $2 a
share at $61.50.
   Chairman Joseph L. Dionne said next year's earnings, excluding
non-recurring gains, would be within a range of $3.50 to $4 a share
even after the the job eliminations and $152 million in charges
after taxes in the fourth quarter. Last year, McGraw-Hill earned
$3.83 a share.
   Bruce Thorp, a media analyst for Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia, called the cost-cutting move ``one of the more
decisive things'' McGraw-Hill has done. But he said the earnings
projection surprised analysts.
   ``It's a sign that business isn't really good,'' he said.
   Bert Boksen, who follows McGraw-Hill for Raymond James &amp;
Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., said, ``The outlook was a lot
worse than anybody expected. ``It indicates a softer-than-expected
outlook for the school publishing business and a general slowing of
the economy,'' he said.
   The company did not specify where the job eliminations would be,
but indicated many would be corporate positions rather than in
operating units, which include Business Week magazine and Standard
&amp; Poor's debt rating service.
   ``The effort to improve productivity and make the organization
leaner is a step in the right direction,'' said Peter Appert, a
media analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. But he said
the company should do more.
   ``Operating margins in some of their units are low by industry
standards,'' Appert said, citing TV station operations and some
information services units.
   He said the stock market's negative reaction to the announcement
would do nothing to discourage speculation that the company may be
a takeover target.
   McGraw-Hill said it would deduct $220 million from its pre-tax
earnings, or $152 million after taxes, in the fourth quarter for
writing down the value of assets, including those at its
DRI-McGraw-Hill economic forecasting unit. The charge also reflects
the closing of a unit that publishes general-interest books and the
establishment of a reserve for employee severance payments.
   Several publishing companies recently have taken writedowns,
including Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. and Paramount
Communications Inc., which owns Simon &amp; Schuster.
   In addition, Time Warner Inc. recently agreed to sell its Scott
Foresman &amp; Co. textbook division for less than it paid for it three
years ago and expects to take a pretax charge of $175 million on
the deal.
   McGraw-Hill said it would scrap its current internal structure
of three operating companies _ publishing, financial services and
information services _ and have all operations report to two new
corporate executive vice presidents responsible to Dionne.
   One new executive vice president is Harold W. McGraw III,
great-grandson of the company's founder. McGraw is in charge of
overseeing the financial services, Business Week and broadcasting
groups and the aerospace and defense information units. He had been
head of financial services.
   The other, Walter D. Serwatka, will be responsible for divisions
that provide information on the construction industry, education,
law, computers and communications. He also will oversee the
professional publishing group. He had headed information services.
   ``Adopting this streamlined corporate structure eliminates an
entire layer of staffing and related expenses associated with the
three operating companies,'' Dionne said in a statement.
   The rest of the jobs being eliminated will result from
previously disclosed plans to automate delivery of the F.W. Dodge
Group reports on the construction industry and from corporate staff
reductions, spokesman Stewart Trisler said.
   McGraw-Hill employs about 13,700 people, meaning the reductions
would amount to a 7 percent cut in staffing.
   The company earned $54.97 million, or $1.13 a share, on revenue
of $507.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1988. It earned $185.5
million, or $3.83 a share, on revenue of $1.82 billion for all of
1988.

<HEAD>Fed Says Economy Stable to Expanding Modestly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. economic activity ranged from stable to
expanding modestly last month, although the manufacturing sector
showed signs of weakness, the Federal Reserve Board said in a
report that provided no damaging news about inflation.
   In its latest survey of economic conditions, the central bank
said Wednesday that only two of its 12 districts showed ``some
recent softening'' in the economy. The districts were not named,
but summaries provided by the Fed indicated they were the ones
based in Richmond, Va., and St. Louis.
   ``Consumer spending has varied among districts,'' the survey
showed. ``Strength has been mostly confined to nondurable items,
while sales of autos and other durables have generally been weak.''
   Higher interest rates have dampened sales of durable goods _
big-ticket items expected to last more than three years _ because
such items often are financed through borrowing.
   ``The majority of districts report some softening in
manufacturing activity but there are pockets of strength,'' The Fed
said. ``Construction is strong or improving in the West and Midwest
but somewhat sluggish in other areas.''
   Referring to inflation, the report said ``those districts that
reported on price developments generally noted flat to modestly
increased input prices, with several mentioning the continuing
escalation of medical insurance costs.''
   The survey by the 12 district banks was conducted prior to Nov.
28 in preparation for the Dec. 18 meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee.
   As the central bank's monetary policy-setting arm, the committee
sets goals for monetary growth which in turn govern interest rates.
It was the tighter monetary policies that pushed up interest rates
recently as the Fed sought to restrain inflation.
   The manufacturing and housing industries were most affected by
the tight-money policies, although the Fed has eased its grip
recently and the housing industry has picked up as mortgage rates
fell.
   Retail sales were described as on target or healthy in the New
York, St. Louis, Minneapolis and San Francisco districts and
unchanged in Boston, Cleveland and Philadelphia. Richmond and
Dallas noted some softening.
   ``Some slowing in manufacturing activity has occurred in most
areas,'' the survey showed. ``Weakness in the auto industry and
among its suppliers was the most commonly cited as a major factor
in the manufacturing slowdown.''
   The Fed survey showed agriculture improving in much of the
country, although drought was reported in south Texas and along the
Gulf coast.
   It also reported increased natural gas exploration in the Kansas
City district and said the oil and gas industry is optimistic about
expanding in the Dallas district next year.
   Loan demand at commercial banks, the survey said, varied by type
and region.
   The San Francisco region, hit by the strong earthquake in
October, ``reports strong loan demand in most areas though the rate
of growth seems to have slowed from its earlier robust pace,'' the
Fed reported.

<HEAD>US to Protect Banks Against Long-Term Foreign Risks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Export-Import Bank says it is
willing to protect private banks against political violence and
other risks in countries where they make loans to support purchases
of U.S. goods.
   The bank did not specify any countries in its announcement
Wednesday. The new guarantee could be given to lenders to the
Soviet Union and other East European countries if, as many business
people hope, laws are repealed that limit U.S. aid to those nations.
   In the past, the bank required the borrowing government to make
a guarantee against financial loss from violence and foreign
government actions when the money was lent over five years or more
for a government purchase. Private projects required a guarantee
from a private bank in the borrowing country. On loans made for
less than five years, the Export-Import Bank has sometimes covered
political risks.
   On Tuesday the bank told its Advisory Committee that there have
been several requests that it take over the long-term political
guarantee. John D. Macomber, the bank's president, said he expected
there will be many more such requests in the future.
   Ann Frey, a press officer at the bank, explained that this was
because projects in some countries that had been delayed by
international debt problems are now being brought up again. Foreign
governments are unwilling to take on the risk of additional debt
themselves, she suggested.
   She said requests for the new U.S. guarantees have come from
Turkey and some Latin American countries.
   An Export-Import Bank guarantee often makes the difference in
closing a deal. Other governments of industrial countries,
especially France and Japan, compete vigorously for international
orders.
   Political risks include war, rebellion, confiscation,
nationalization and the refusal of a foreign government to allow
payments to leave its country. The bank said the new long-term
guarantees will be available after the U.S. government and the
borrowing government have made an agreement that provides a way to
settle disputes.
   The U.S. government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation
already offers similar insurance to Americans who make direct
investments, not loans, in other countries. Some governments,
especially in Latin America, have been reluctant to make agreements
on dispute settlement because they are unwilling to see trade
disputes handled anywhere but in their own courts.

<HEAD>Eastern Objects to Methods Used in Investigation of Finances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An extensive financial investigation of Eastern
Airlines being made under the supervision of a federal bankruptcy
court has raised objections from the airline.
   David Boies, an attorney for Eastern, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland at a hearing Wednesday that the investigation's
objectivity has been compromised because a large part of the work
has been delegated to Eastern's unions.
   Attorney David I. Shapiro, the examiner appointed by the
bankruptcy court, has been conducting the inquiry into Eastern,
Continental Airlines and their parent Texas Air Corp. since early
September. Shapiro and more than 20 associates have been
interviewing current and former officers of the companies, union
leaders and others.
   Shapiro told Lifland he has received a list of complaints from
Boies which contend, among other things, that the investigation has
been ``too tough'' and ``too prosecutorial.'' The examiner said the
magnitude of the task has led him to delegate some work, such as
interviews, to union attorneys but that practice hasn't hurt
objectivity.
   Also at the hearing, Lifland postponed for two months
consideration of a union request for a special trustee to be
appointed to run Miami-based Eastern.
   Lifland postponed from Dec. 15 to Feb. 15 a hearing on the
trustee issue, in accordance with a request by Shapiro. He also
gave Shapiro until Feb. 15 to submit a report on his investigation.
   ``It's clear that the underlying examinations are proceeding
with vigor, with a great deal of discomfort,'' Lifland said.
   The unions at Eastern had asked that a trustee be appointed to
run the airline in place of current management soon after they went
on strike on March 4. Lifland has postponed hearings on the
question several times since then.
   Union attorneys objected Wednesday to Shapiro's request that the
trustee issue be put off again, but they agreed that he needed more
time to complete his inquiry. Attorneys for Eastern's major
creditors supported both of Shapiro's requests.
   Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9 and has been
rebuilding as a smaller airline by hiring workers to replace the
striking Machinists, pilots and flight attendants.
   Contract talks are ongoing between Eastern and its pilots and
flight attendants unions, which decided to end their 8 1@2-month
sympathy strikes shortly before Thanksgiving. The Machinists union
is still on strike against the airline.
   The unions have accused Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo of
stripping assets from Eastern.
   Shapiro is looking into past transactions between Texas Air,
Eastern and sister carrier Continental. They include, for example,
the transfer of the System One computer reservation system from
Eastern to Texas Air in April 1987 for about $100 million.
   The key question is whether Lorenzo has been treating the three
companies as one airline, Shapiro told the court. He and his staff
have interviewed around 70 people and examined more than 200,000
documents, he said.
   In October, Shapiro had said he expected to complete the
investigation by early December, and said his schedule had been
delayed several times by lawyers for the parties involved.

<HEAD>Raise MaxSaver Fares; Temporarily Drop Advance-Purchase Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   While they are raising discount MaxSaver fares, the nation's big
airlines are softening the blow by eliminating advance-purchase
requirements for the popular tickets during the holiday period.
   Following a move a week ago by Pan Am Corp., a number of
airlines said Wednesday they plan to raise MaxSavers by $10 per
round trip on flights of less than 1,000 miles and $20 on longer
trips. The new fares take effect Dec. 16.
   Spokesmen for United Airlines, Continental Airlines, Eastern
Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines said those
carriers had decided after a week of deliberation to match Pan Am's
increases.
   Most of the airlines also are following United's initiative in
temporarily dropping advance-purchase requirements for the
MaxSavers, the most deeply discounted fares popular with
vacationers.
   American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, moved Tuesday
to match Pan Am's change.
   American's new MaxSaver fares between New York and Los Angeles,
for example, will be $398 to $438 round trip, up from $378 to $418.
Fares between Chicago and New York will go to $258 to $298 from
$248 to $288.
   Continental spokesman Ned Walker, however, emphasized that the
airline was matching the MaxSaver hikes only in selected markets.
   Passenger traffic normally increases this time of year, a peak
travel season. The airlines have been under pressure to hike fares
because their costs, mainly fuel prices, have increased sharply in
recent months.
   ``I don't think it was too much of a surprise, given the way
costs have been escalating,'' said Edward Starkman, an airline
analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   Two weeks ago, a number of big carriers led by United said they
planned to raise fares on most domestic routes and eliminate
discount fares used mainly by business travelers. The increases
didn't apply to the MaxSavers, however.
   The airlines said Wednesday they are waiving the usual 14-day
advance-purchase requirements for travel between Dec. 20 and Jan. 5
when seats are available. No refunds are allowed, and passengers
must buy tickets within 24 hours of making a reservation and must
stay over a Saturday night.

<HEAD>Coke Classic Remains Top-Selling Soft Drink, New Coke Off Top 10
List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Classic was tops in 1989, but the
drink known as New Coke that was introduced to replace it in 1985
fell out of the annual Top 10 soft drink rankings for the first
time, an industry newsletter says.
   The rankings released Wednesday by Beverage Digest indicated New
Coke, which had tied with RC Cola and Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi for
10th place in 1988, failed to make the 10 top rankings this year.
   Publisher Jesse Meyers said Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi broke the
tie this year, capturing 10th place with a 1.5 percent market share
and leaving RC Cola and New Coke in a close fight for 11th at 1.4
percent each.
   The Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. introduced New Coke in 1985,
saying that it improved on the flavor of it regular cola. But the
company said fans of the original Coca-Cola taste deluged the
company with protests, and the company put the original drink back
on the market three months later as Coca-Cola Classic.
   New Coke was kept alive, but its share of market rapidly fell to
the low single digits after capturing an estimated 15 percent of
1985 soft drink sales.
   In 1989, Coca-Cola Classic retained the top ranking for the
fourth consecutive year, although its market share fell to 20.0
percent from 20.1 percent in 1988.
   Pepsi was second at 18.3 percent, down 0.4 percentage point from
1988.
   Diet Coke placed third with 8.9 percent share of market, Diet
Pepsi was fourth at 5.7 percent and Dr Pepper was fifth at 4.6
percent, according to Beverage Digest, published from Old
Greenwich, Conn.
   Filling out the rest of the Top 10 list were Sprite in sixth
place at 3.6 percent, followed by Mountain Dew at 3.5 percent, 7Up
at 2.9 percent and Caffeine-Free Diet Coke at 2.4 percent.
   The retail value of the soft drink market is $43 billion,
according to Meyers. That is up 2 percent from 1988, when sales
rose 4.5 percent.
   Meyers said the slower growth was due to cooler weather in many
parts of the nation this past summer, a prime sales season for soft
drinks.
   He noted that the four diet soft drinks in the Top 10 this year
had combined market share growth of 1.7 percentage points, while
the six sugared products saw their combined market share fall 0.3
percent.
   ``We are watching our calories,'' he said. He said diet soft
drinks are gaining ground in part because people like the taste and
because the soft drink makers are offering diet drinks in more
forms than ever.
   Counting all soft drinks sold by individual companies, Coca-Cola
commanded the biggest corporate share of the industry in 1989 with
41.1 percent, up from 40.5 percent a year earlier, the rankings
indicated.
   Pepsi-Cola was second in corporate share of the soft drink
business with 31.1 percent, up 0.4 percentage point from 1988.
   Dr Pepper-Seven Up ranks a distant third with a 10 percent
corporate share of the market, according to the Beverage Digest
rankings. Cadbury Beverages was fourth at 3.1 percent and Royal
Crown was fifth at 2.8 percent.

<HEAD>Sun Needles IBM About Cutbacks, Takes Partial Credit for IBM Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scott McNealy, president of Sun
Microsystems Inc., is needling rival International Business
Machines Corp. over its huge job cuts and said his computer company
can take some of the credit for Big Blue's woes.
   McNealy, who introduced two important additions to Sun's SPARC
desktop computer family Wednesday, predicted a bright future for
his $1.8 billion company in the 1990s despite problems elsewhere in
the industry.
   McNealy's uncharacteristic jabs at IBM and Wall Street traders
came in response to questions about the effect on the computer
industry of IBM's announcement Tuesday that it would cut 10,000
jobs in the United States and set aside $2.3 billion from its
pretax profit to pay for the cuts.
   Asked in an interview Wednesday whether Mountain View-based Sun
might make any cutbacks, McNealy quipped, ``Maybe we should and
make the stock go up.''
   IBM's stock rose 37{ cents on Tuesday's announcement, but fell
$1 Wednesday to $98.62{.
   ``Look at what the analysts did,'' McNealy said. ``IBM made a
statement yesterday that something is very wrong. They laid off a
whole Sun Microsystems worth of employees and they wrote off from
profits more than we have in annual revenue. And their stock went
up.
   ``That's a fundamental statement that, `We don't know what to do
with our cash, so we might as well pay it out in dividends.' Which
is what they're doing.
   ``Their stock went up because (analysts) said, `IBM just washed
all their dirty socks, they took huge reserves and they padded
their balance sheet and income statement massively so that they're
probably not going to have a bad quarter the next couple of
quarters. So I'll get in, ride it up ... then get out before they
do the next one.''
   McNealy noted that IBM's moves were typical of many U.S.
companies.
   ``There are lots of (chief financial officers) in industry who
say when you take a bath, take a big bath because that makes your
stock price go up,'' he said. ``But is that any way to run a
company? I don't think so.''
   That type of thinking, and the short-term opportunities it
provides traders on Wall Street, he said, results from the rules
set by Congress.
   ``I'm not blaming the traders. It's the rules,'' he said. The
answer, he claims, would be to impose heavy income taxes on profits
from stock held less than a year or two.
   McNealy said he has long predicted that the type of workstation
computers Sun sells would cut into the sales of mainframe and
minicomputer systems of companies like IBM.
   Workstations are powerful desktop computers that can be used for
various applications, such as spreadsheets, word processing and
database programming. IBM's mainframes and minicomputers are
time-shared systems hooked to a large number of terminals, and all
the applications are handled by the main processor. IBM also makes
personal computers.
   The three fastest-growing computer companies of the 1980s,
McNealy said, were Compaq Computer Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and
Sun, all of which are desktop-oriented.
   That growth came at the expense of the companies that get most
of their profit from the bigger, costlier computers, such as IBM,
Digital Equipment Corp., Unisys Corp. Control Data Corp. and Amdahl
Corp., Wang Laboratories Inc. and Prime Computer Inc.
   Many industry analysts agree with McNealy's views.
   ``It's fair to say that companies like Apple, Compaq, Sun,
Microsoft and others can take appropriate credit for IBM's
decade-long problems,'' said analyst Peter Rogers of the San
Francisco brokerage Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co.
   ``What's basically happened at IBM is their technology is
obsolete,'' he said. ``The model of computing on which they have
built is no longer the preferred model.''
   Sun's latest entries into its SPARC line are the powerful
SPARCserver 490, which is priced at $113,900 with 32 megabytes of
main memory, and an entry-level SPARCserver 1, priced at $18,900
with 8 megabytes of main memory.
   Founded in 1982, Sun has had only one quarter when it didn't
show a profit. Sun lost $20.3 million in the fiscal fourth quarter
ended last June 30, blaming the slip on product transition and
foulups in an internal computer management system. That cut its
fiscal 1989 profit to $60.8 million on $1.8 billion in sales.
   The company recovered quickly, though, earning $5.2 million in
the first quarter of its 1990 fiscal year.
   Rogers expects Sun will post $93 million in profits in fiscal
1990 on $2.5 billion in sales.

   The dollar was little changed in light European
trading early today. Gold bullion prices were higher.
   Dealers said the dollar firmed in late-morning trading amid
short-loss buying by investors who had earlier sold borrowed
dollars on expectations of further declines.
   The market also appeared to be squaring positions before
Friday's release of U.S. unemployment rate figures for November.
Analysts predicted the unemployment rate will rise from 5.3 percent
to 5.4 percent.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar edged up 0.38 Japanese yen to a closing 144.13
yen. Later, in London, it eased to 144.04 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.7666 West German marks, up from 1.7648; 1.5870
Swiss francs, down from 1.5875; 6.0365 French francs, up from
6.0315; 1.9935 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0010; 1,303.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,301.15; and 1.1617 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1602.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5765, unchanged
from late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $405.20 a troy ounce, up
from $402.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $405.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $405.30, up from $403.75 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.30 to close at a bid $405.01.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $5.58 a troy
ounce, up from $5.56 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Stocks At Another Record High, Dollar Edges Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index closed at a
record high for the 11th time in the last 12 trading days today,
and the dollar edged up against the Japanese yen for the fifth
consecutive day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 203.82
points, or 0.54 percent, closing at 37,858.11.
   The index has risen 725.43 points, or 1.95 percent, in the last
four days alone, and 1,964.53 points, or 5.47 percent, since Nov.
20.
   On Wednesday, ``trust fund managers were placing large orders,
which contributed to the Nikkei's advance,'' said a dealer at Nikko
Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Dealers said investors were reassured by an Economic Planning
Agency announcement that Japan's real gross national product grew
2.9 percent in the July-September quarter from the previous quarter.
   The rise in inflation-adjusted GNP was equivalent to a 12.2
percent annual growth rate, the highest since 1973, the agency said.
   Large capital shares and blue-chip electricals remained at the
center of trading activity, but investors also were turning their
interest to sectors that had been lagging in the last few weeks,
such as textiles and food issues, dealers said.
   ``Trading is becoming more active and broader,'' said the Nikko
Securities dealer. ``I expect the bullish trend to continue for
some time.''
   In the currency market, the dollar closed at 144.13 yen, up 0.38
yen from Wednesday's close of 143.75 yen. It opened at 143.95 yen
and ranged between 143.94 yen and 144.33 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 1.23 yen in the last five days.
   Currency dealers said the dollar opened higher in Tokyo after
gains on overseas markets, and continued to rise on buying by
insurance and trust banks.
   Dollar-buying was triggered by warnings by the East German
military that it would not tolerate attempts by citizens to seize
munitions from security installations, the dealers said. They said
fleeting worries that the military might block the country's reform
movement led some to sell West German marks.
   Investors had been buying marks in a belief that West Germany
would benefit from economic and other reforms in the East bloc.
   Takashi Kanagami, manager of foreign exchange dealings at
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp., said the West German mark would
strengthen further if next week's European Economic Community
summit decides to help East European countries.

   The former chairman of publishing giant

   The three _ Edward P. Evans, Macmillan's chairman from 1980 to
1988; William F. Reilly, Macmillan's chief operating officer; and
Beverly C. Chell, the publisher's general counsel _ were accused of
filing misleading or incomplete documents concerning the purpose
for buying 1.2 million Macmillan shares for a company employee
stock option plan in 1987.
   In a civil complaint filed Wednesday at federal court in
Washington, the SEC sought an injunction to prohibit the trio from
violating federal securities rules.
   But simultaneously with the charges, the three _ without
admitting or denying wrongdoing _ settled and consented to an
injunction barring them from violating securities disclosure rules.
   A spokesman for Macmillan in New York did not have an immediate
comment on the settlement Wednesday evening.
   ``We believe it to be the first action the commission has
brought in a filing by an ESOP, which are increasingly being used
as a takeover defense,'' said Herbert F. Janick III, an SEC
attorney in the case.
   The SEC complaint alleged that beginning in May 1987, Evans,
Reilly and Chell began to develop a plan to recapitalize Macmillan
in anticipation of a possible hostile takeover.
   Evans later headed a Macmillan management group that lost a
takeover battle for Macmillan to British media lord Robert Maxwell.
   In 1988, a Delaware court blocked a restructuring Macmillan
proposed as a defense against an unwanted $1.9 billion bid from the
Robert Bass Group. Bass later dropped his bid after competing
offers were launched by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&amp; Co. and Maxwell.
   According to the SEC complaint, as part of the alleged
recapitalization proposal, Evans, Reilly and Chell caused
Macmillan's employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to buy 1.2 million
Macmillan shares, which was more than 5 percent of the
then-outstanding stock.
   By law, persons or companies acquiring 5 percent or more of a
company must disclose their stake and state their intentions in an
SEC document known as a 13-D.
   But the SEC charged that the 13-D filed by the trio did not
disclose ``that a purpose of the acquisition was to further the
recapitalization.''
   Evans' lawyer, Richard M. Phillips, issued a written statement
concerning the settlement, which said: ``Since the Macmillan ESOP's
purchase of Macmillan shares was extremely profitable to Macmillan
employees, it satisfied the stated purpose of the transaction to
allow `employees to acquire stock ownership interest in the
company.'''
   ``Mr. Evans is pleased that the (SEC)'s action, alleging that a
further statement of purpose was necessary, could be settled
without spending the time and resources that would be required to
litigate the commission's factual allegations and legal theories,''
the statement said.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it
is ready to prosecute market manipulation by the practice of short
selling _ but the evidence isn't always there.
   ``We're committed to identify short selling abuse wherever it
may occur,'' said John Sturc, of the SEC's Enforcement Division
told a House panel Wednesday.
   But he and another SEC official also told a subcommittee of the
House Committee on Governmental Affairs ``short selling also
provides the market with two vital benefits.''
   Richard G. Ketchum, head of the SEC's Division of Market
Regulation, told the panel those benefits are market liquidity and
price efficiency which help prevent volatility _ the steep price
rises and drops that can panic investors and send the market
plunging.
   But Sturc, an associate director of the enforcement division
noted that he and Ketchum were ``not here to defend or attack short
selling.''
   In short-selling, an investor tries to take advantage of an
anticipated drop in the price of a company's stock. The investor
borrows stock from a broker and sells it, hoping to replace it with
stock purchased at a lower price. The investor's profit would come
from the difference between the price obtained for the borrowed
stock and the lower price paid to replace it.
   Short selling is not illegal and stockholders are allowed to
lend or borrow stock they are holding for customers, if the stock
has been purchased on margin _ the buyer did not put up the full
purchase price.
   But in testimony last week before the commerce, consumer and
monetary affairs subcommittee, some witnesses complained some
professional short-sellers often break the rules to get a stock to
drop quickly and spread false rumors about a company, its products
or its management.
   That testimony was about the over-the-counter market, which does
not have the same rules governing short sales as do the stock
exchanges. The National Association of Securities Dealers, a
private, self-regulating group oversees the over-the-counter market.
   Sturc, however, noted that the SEC considers all complaints of
short selling abuses, but often investigations ``do not lead to
sustainable evidence of violations of the antifraud provisions of
the federal securities laws.''
   At the beginning of the hearing the subcommittee chairman, Rep.
Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., said he was not sure ``that the SEC is on
the same wavelength as the subcommittee.''
   But Sturc explained that often when companies complain they are
the victims of short sellers spreading false rumors, there is no
proof where the rumors originated or whether it has had an effect
of the company's stock.
   ``We have a strong enforcement interest,'' said Sturc, adding
``I regret to say, Mr. Chairman, we have not received allegations
of misconduct to quite the degree of specificity as has been
presented to the subcommittee by several of the witnesses. We would
be happy to receive them. My job is to try find violators and catch
them and that's what I like to do.''
   After the session, Barnard told reporters that the hearings were
``not a witchhunt as far as the SEC or NASD were concerned. I
thought there was good explanations.''

<HEAD>West German Mobile Phone License Awarded to International Consortium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany today awarded a
license to build and operate a private mobile telephone system that
analysts estimate could be worth more than $5 billion to a
four-nation consortium.
   Led by Mannesmann AG, the group also includes Pacific Telesis
Group of the United States, Cable and Wireless PLC of Britain,
Lyonnaise des Eaux of France and Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, a
major West German bank.
   The Post Ministry chose the consortium from a large field of
contending groups, which included several of West Germany's largest
companies and international telecommunications concerns.
   The private network, called D-2, will compete with the Post
Ministry's own D-1 system. It will be the second digital cellular
system in West Germany. The German government now operates an
analog cellular network and plans to build its own digital system.
   Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH, the electronics subsidiary of the West
German engineering concern, will hold a majority stake in the
consortium, called Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH.
   Analysts have said that operating a mobile phone network in
densely-populated West Germany will be an extremely profitable
business in the 1990s. The value of the license has been estimated
at 2 billion to 10 billion marks, or the equivalent of about $1.1
billion to $5.6 billion.
   Mannesmann has said construction of the network will require
initial investments of $2.2 billion.
   Rumors that the consortium won the bidding war spurred a rally
in Mannesmann stock in recent days. Since last Thursday, Mannesmann
stock has surged some 25 percent to close at 340.00 marks a share,
or about $192, on Wednesday.
   The decision by Post Minister Christian Schwarz-Schilling was
based on a recommendation of a special advisory panel that ranked
the Mannesmann consortium first among the bidders.
   Pacific Telesis, which holds a 26 percent interest in the
consortium, has not put a dollar value on its share of the license,
but analysts estimate it could increase the per-share value of the
company's stock by $3 or $4 as the financial market reacts to the
announcement, company spokeswoman Amy Damianakes said.
   ``We view the cellular business as an `Alexander Graham Bell'
opportunity,'' Sam Ginn, PacTel's president and chief executive
officer, said in a news release today.
   ``This license expands our reach into the international cellular
market and provides significant potential for increasing shareowner
value during the 1990s,'' Ginn said.
   Pacific Telesis, one of the ``Baby Bells'' created after the
breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., has a contract with
the consortium to design, engineer and manage the new system's
construction. PacTel's 26 percent interest covers about 16 million
potential cellular subscribers, compared with its nearly 30 million
potential subscribers in the United States, Ginn said.
   Other partners in the consortium are Mannesmann AG, Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank, Cable and Wireless PLC, Lyonnaise des Eaux and
the National Associations of Electrical and Automobile Trades.

   Nadia Comaneci will need her nimblest footwork
since her perfect score on the balance beam to salvage her
marketing potential, now that her relationship with a married
father of four kids has been made public.
   ``I think there are some problems. No one is going to touch her
right now,'' said Jay Ogden, senior vice president of International
Management Group, which handles endorsements for U.S. gymnast Bart
Conner.
   ``She's an intriguing sports figure. But advertisers and
companies have to be very careful,'' Ogden said Wednesday. ``There
have to be some answers. She's got to avoid the negatives.''
   Sports agents believe there may still be marketability for
Comaneci, the first gymnast to score a perfect 10 in the Olympics.
She slogged six hours through mud and ice Nov. 28 to flee her
native Romania and now has refugee status in the United States.
   ``Time will tell. If it's a one-day furor, it won't make any
difference,'' said Leigh Steinberg, a Los Angeles agent who
represents about 100 athletes, including 13 professional
quarterbacks.
   ``This is entirely an issue of her private life. Prior to that
disclosure, she would have been very hot and marketable,''
Steinberg said. `If romantic peccadilloes disqualified someone from
being perceived as an attractive personality, half the people who
do endorsements would not be doing them.''
   Comaneci's flight around what's left of the Iron Curtain was
arranged by Romanian emigre Constantin Panait, 34, a self-employed
south Florida roofer who has a wife and four children.
   The two met at a party in 1987 in Bucharest, Romania, and
Comaneci knew he was married.
   ``So what? It didn't matter,'' said the 28-year-old Comaneci,
who left behind her three gold medals from the 1976 Olympics, her
family and a life of privilege for a chance to ``settle down
together'' with Panait.
   The relationship may matter to corporations, who routinely
insert escape clauses that can void endorsement contracts if
athletes engage in compromising behavior.
   ``If anyone has a bad image with public or does something
distasteful, it makes it difficult to endorse a product. The name
of the game is selling,'' said Barbara Bennett of New York's Grey
Advertising, whose clients include Tommy Lasorda, Orel Hershiser
and Dick Butkus.
   ``We prefer people to be squeaky clean,'' said Vangie Hay?e, they
do it, too. This
system has forced me to play better defense.''

   Chrysler Corp. says it wants to return to its
roots, and some industry analysts are praising the move.
   The nation's third-largest automaker announced Wednesday that it
has put its Chrysler Technologies Corp. subsidiary on the block,
sharply scaling back the company's diversification drive of earlier
this decade.
   Chrysler said it has hired First Boston Corp. to advise it on
the sale of the aerospace and military technologies division. It
did not disclose what price it might seek.
   Chrysler Technologies is comprised of Gulfstream Aerospace
Corp., a corporate jet maker that was acquired for $637 million in
1985; Electrospace Systems Inc., a maker of defense and electronics
products and systems bought for $367 million in 1987; and Airborne
Systems Inc., formed in January 1989 by combining military
aviation-related functions of Gulfstream and Electrospace.
   The vast majority of Chrysler Technologies' 1988 revenue of $1.3
billion stems from Gulfstream, said John Stellman, a spokesman for
Chrysler Technologies. Total Chrysler Corp. revenues in 1988 were
$35.47 billion.
   Chrysler also said Wednesday that Gulfstream founder and
Chairman Allen Paulson resigned from the Chrysler board of
directors and took a leave of absence from Gulfstream to pursue a
potential purchase of all or some of Chrysler Technologies.
   Paulson, in a meeting Wednesday with Gulfstream employees in
Savannah, Ga., said he mainly was interested in acquiring
Gulfstream but would make a bid for all of Chrysler Technologies if
necessary.
   Paulson told the workers that if he made a successful bid for
Chrysler Technologies, he subsequently would attempt to sell
Electrospace Systems and Airborne Systems.
   He said he believes he will need about a week to prepare his
offer but is working with banks about possible financing.
   Since Oct. 1, Chrysler has been involved in an aggressive
cost-cutting program to slash at least $1 billion from its budget
by the end of next year, including the elimination of about 2,300,
or 8 percent, of its salaried work force.
   In September, Chrysler sold about half of its stake in the
Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp., gaining about $310
million after taxes.
   Sales of Chrysler cars and light trucks for the year through
Nov. 30 were 6.4 percent behind last year's pace, reflecting an
industrywide slowdown.
   Chrysler said the Chrysler Technologies sale had been under
consideration for some time.
   ``We've had some informal inquiries,'' said spokesman Steve
Harris. ``But we've never had any firm offers.''
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said the vehicle market is going
to be fiercely competitive in the future.
   ``We intend to go head-to-head with the Toyotas and Hondas of
the world as well as anybody else in the market,'' he said. ``And
this is the right time to take this step.
   ``The only way to succeed in this kind of environment is to
concentrate all our energies and resources on the task of
satisfying our customers and insuring that our dealers have the
best line of cars and trucks we can possibly produce,'' Iacocca
said.
   Chrysler shares rose 12{ cents to close at $19.12{ a share
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Although Chrysler Technologies accounted for a relatively small
chunk of the parent company's overall earnings, analysts said the
businesses had been acquired as a way of helping diversify from the
cyclical auto industry.
   Harris said Chrysler Technologies had about $149 million in
pre-tax profits last year and the company had projected earnings of
about $121 million this year. Chrysler Corp. had after-tax profits
of $1.05 billion in 1988.
   The company said the hoped-for sale was unrelated to cash needs,
but analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. of New York questioned that assertion.
   ``I don't see how they can say this isn't for cash,'' she said.
``It just seems like a big contradiction. They made the
acquisitions so they can be less dependent on the auto industry.''
   When Chrysler announced the Gulfstream acquisition in 1985,
Iacocca called it ``an important step in our long-range plan to
diversify into high-tech industries like aerospace and
electronics.''
   Analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New
York said the decision to sell Chrysler Technologies was a sound
one. ``Since they bought it, the world has changed,'' she said.
   ``In the current thawing in the Cold War and the anticipated
cuts in defense budgets, an operation like that, which is small
relative to Chrysler's size, makes less and less sense,'' she added.
   Chrysler Technologies has about 8,300 employees, Harris said.
Gulfstream has about 5,000 workers, Electrospace has about 2,000
and Chrysler Technologies Airborne Systems has about 1,300.

<HEAD>Phelps Dodge Announces $375 Million in Pre-tax Charges</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT day of week.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phelps Dodge Corp. says it will take pre-tax
charges of about $375 million in the fourth quarter to write down
the value of certain assets that have been idle for several years.
   After deferred tax benefits, these charges will reduce net
income in the quarter by about $250 million, or $7 per common
share, the copper company said Wednesday, adding it still expected
to report a profit for the period.
   ``The decision to take these charges at this time is unrelated
to our outlook for copper and other market factors _ we remain
bullish on the future,'' Douglas C. Yearly, chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
   Yearly noted that the Phoenix-based company ``has achieved
record results for each of 1987, 1988 and the first three quarters
of 1989, and there is a continuing strong market for copper and
most of our other products.''
   Included in the charges are about $145 million for reserve
provisions for the Morenci smelter, about $50 million for the New
Cornelia Mine, Concentrator and Smelter in Ajo, and ``certain other
facilities that have been rendered obsolete by environmental
requirements or other economic considerations.''
   The charges also reflect the reduction of about $115 million in
assets stemming from the company's decision to indefinately defer
any further pre-operating mine development work on the Dos Pobres
underground copper deposit near Safford.
   ``These assets are assets that have been idle since 1984,'' said
Thomas M. Foster, a company vice president. ``Consequently, this is
a non-cash charge to earnings that we feel we are not going to
reactivate in the forseeable future.''
   Richard Moolick, who retired as president of Phelps Dodge in
1984, questioned the move.
   ``The Ajo mine, at the prices we've been experiencing, is a
viable property,'' Moolick said. He closed the mine in 1984 when
faced with plunging copper prices.
   However, Lew Alton, a managing general partner of the investment
banking firm L.H. Alton of San Francisco, praised the action.
   ``You figure they have new people at the helm, earnings are
phenomenal ... and you get the opportunity to clean up the balance
sheet. Why not do it when you have the chance?'' he said.
   Phelps Dodge's net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was
$115.4 million, or $3.26 a share, compared with net income of $93.3
million, or $2.53 a share, for the same quarter last year.
   In addition to its copper operations, Phelps Dodge produces
carbon black, fabricates steel wheels and rims for trucks and
manufactures magnet wire.

<TEXT>
   Grain futures were lower and soybeans were mixed
at the opening today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices fell as a result of the release yesterday of the
National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast. The outlook
calls for increased chances for rain in the winter wheat region.
   The lack of export business is putting pressure on soybean
futures, although strong demand for soybean oil may be a boost to
prices.
   Corn futures drifted lower on follow-through from the weak
closing yesterday, with little news to stimulate buying, said
analyst Frank Kouba of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   At the open, wheat was 1} cents lower to \ cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.08 a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.35 cents a bushel; oats
were 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with December at $1.43} a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 3 cents lower with January at
$5.78 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork belly futures drifted lower after opening higher, with
profit-taking wiping out the earlier gains. Movement of bellies
into storage and falling belly prices also put pressure on futures.
   Livestock futures were slightly higher due to concerns over cold
temperatures in the Plains, which could affect feeding.
   Live cattle were .17 cent lower to .10 cent higher with December
at 75.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .13
cent higher with January at 82.90 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with December at 51.50 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .90 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
February at 55.55 cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled mixed in Wednesday's trading.

<HEAD>Hooker Seeks Bankruptcy Court Permission to Sell Two Retail Chains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L.J. Hooker Corp., which tried unsuccessfully to
sell its B. Altman &amp; Co. department store chain, on Thursday said
it wants to find buyers for two other retailers, Bonwit Teller and
Sakowitz.
   The proposed sale of Bonwit Teller reverses Hooker's previous
plan to retain the century-old 16-store upscale chain.
   Hooker, which is operating under bankruptcy law protection from
creditors, said it has determined it would be best to seek buyers
for New York-based Bonwit Teller and Sakowitz, a specialty retailer
based in Houston.
   Sanford C. Sigoloff, chief executive of Hooker, said that while
the Bonwit Teller and Sakowitz operations have been doing better,
Hooker management felt the best way to maximize returns was through
a sale.
   He said Bonwit Teller would be a more attractive property to
potential buyers than Altman was.
   ``B. Altman required an investment of approximately $100 million
to bring it to the point where it could compete,'' Sigoloff said in
a news release. ``Bonwit Teller and Sakowitz each has markedly
better physical facilities, a more focused business and an
up-to-date image with its customers.''
   The sale of Bonwit Teller, a wholly-owned Hooker subsidiary, and
Sakowitz, in which Hooker bought a controlling interest two years
ago, should be completed within ``a relatively short period of
time,'' Sigoloff said.
   The Bonwit chain has its flagship store in Manhattan's Trump
Plaza and operates 15 branches scattered throughout the East,
Midwest, South and West. Sakowitz's main store is in the Post Oak
Galleria in Houston and its six other stores are mostly in Texas.
   The plan to sell Bonwit Teller and Sakowitz must be approved by
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Hooker said it is seeking the court's
permission to retain Financo Inc., a New York-based investment
banking firm that specializes in retail transactions, to handle the
sales.
   Gilbert W. Harrison, Financo's chairman, said information about
Bonwit and Sakowitz would be available for prospective bidders
within two weeks.
   ``We have received numerous inquiries concerning the possible
sale of both Bonwit Teller and Sakowitz,'' he said.
   Robert Sakowitz, the chain's president, has indicated he would
lead a group of investors in making a bid for the company, Hooker
said in its news release.
   A Hooker spokeswoman, Amy Goldberg, said the company hasn't
disclosed how much it wants for the two chains.
   L.J. Hooker filed for Chapter 11 protection under the federal
bankruptcy code in August after its financially distressed
Australian parent company Hooker Corp. was turned over to a
provisional liquidator.
   Last month L.J. Hooker announced it had not received a suitable
offer for Altman and would close down six of the chain's seven
stores. A going-out-of-business sale started the day after
Thanksgiving. The goal is to liquidate all inventory by Jan. 29.
   The Altman store in the Forest Fair Mall outside Cincinnati,
which Hooker owns, is staying in operation so as not to impair
business at the shopping mall.
   The Bonwit and Sakowitz chains will lengthen the already long
list of retailers on the selling block. Friday is the deadline for
initial offers for Bloomingdale's, the crown jewel of the retail
empire owned by highly leveraged Campeau Corp. BAT Industries PLC
is selling its Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field chains.
   By selling Bonwit Teller and Sakowitz, Hooker will have
virtually withdrawn from retailing in the United States. Since
entering the U.S. retail business in 1986, analysts say Hooker
spent more than $1 billion to build up its presence.
   Recently, Hooker sold its Parisian Inc. department store chain
based in Birmingham, Ala. Its Merksamer Jewelers was taken over in
a leveraged buyout by the Sacramento, Calif.-based chain's
management.
   Assuming Hooker succeeds in selling Bonwit Teller and Sakowitz,
the company's remaining U.S. assets will be three shopping malls,
various commercial real estate properties and a commercial real
estate brokerage. Hooker spokeswoman Ms. Goldberg said a private
investment group has made a bid for most of those assets.

   The stock market drifted aimlessly today as
traders awaited the latest report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped 4.69 to 2,732.08
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 669 up, 727 down and 536
unchanged.
   Analysts said hopes had dimmed a bit this week that the Federal
Reserve might soon relax its credit policy further.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell slightly in this
morning's activity, pushing up their yields to the 7.91

   Brokers said optimism about the chances for fresh declines in
interest rates could be revived if Friday's monthly report from the
Labor Department on the employment situation provides evidence that
economic growth remains sluggish.
   But traders seemed reluctant to take many increased positions
exposing them to any surprises in the figures.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street call for the November data to
show an increase of about 150,000 in nonfarm payroll employment.
   Pinnacle West led the active list and jumped 4\ to 9|. The
company agreed to provide $450 million in cash and securities to
its Merabank savings and loan subsidiary, meeting a condition of an

<HEAD>Four-Nation Group To Build Mobile Phone Network Worth Billions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A four-nation consortium Thursday won
the rights to build and run a private mobile telephone network in
West Germany, a license that some analysts say could amount to a $6
billion gold mine in the 1990s.
   The group led by Mannesmann AG also includes Pacific Telesis of
the United States, Cable and Wireless PLC of Britain, Lyonnaise des
Eaux of France and Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, a major West
German bank.
   West Germany's current mobile phone network, operated by the
government, is suffering from severe capacity restraints.
   A new network in the densely populated, economically strong
country is considered certain to be a highly profitable enterprise
in the next decade. But many analysts warn that implementation
could face unforeseen delays or obstacles dueto changing regulation
and increasing competition.
   ``We view the cellular business as an `Alexander Graham Bell'
opportunity,'' Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer of
Pacific Telesis, said in a news release issued from the company's
San Francisco headquarters.
   ``This license expands our reach into the international cellular
market and provides significant potential for increasing
shareholder value in the 1990s,'' Ginn said.
   The Post Ministry chose the consortium from a large field of
contenders that included several of West Germany's largest
companies and international telecommunications concerns.
   The private network, called D-2, will compete with the Post
Ministry's own D-1 system.
   Plans call for Mannesmann and the Postal Service to start
building separate networks in West Germany in 1991 and complete
them by 1994, Post Minister Christian Schwarz-Schilling told
reporters. The two systems will be integrated into a larger
European network so the same cellular mobile phones can be used all
over Europe.
   That consideration is significant because of plans by the
12-nation European Community, known as the Common Market, to drop
internal trade barriers by 1992 and create a unified market.
   Schwarz-Schilling said the new project will require investments
of $1.1 billion to $2.3 billion.
   The private network should break even by 1995, he said. Analysts
say D-2 could have 500,000 or more users by that time.
   Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH, the electronics subsidiary of the West
German engineering concern, will hold a 51 percent stake in the
consortium, called Mannesmann Mobilfunk GmbH and based in
Duesseldorf, West Germany.
   The final license agreement with Mannesmann will be signed in
January, Schwarz-Schilling said.
   Pacific Telesis will hold 26 percent of the consortium, DG-Bank
10 percent, Cable and Wireless 5 percent, and Lyonnaise des Eaux
2.5 percent. The remaining 5.5 percent will be held by various
smaller shareholders.
   Other bidders for the license included German heavyweights like
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the maker of BMW cars; Axel Springer
Verlag AG, a major West German publisher; and several big
industrial firms.
   Under a formula used by U.S. analysts to value mobile phone
licenses, the order could be worth $6 billion. But others said that
amount is too high because it does not consider necessary outlays
and risks.
   George Verghese, electronics analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in
London, cautioned that a Europe-wide network could be delayed by
disagreements within the European Community.
   He also said growing competition in coming years is likely to
put pressure on profit margins.
   ``On paper it all looks wonderful, but the implementation could
be delayed,'' Verghese said.
   Pacific Telesis shares were up by 75 cents at $48.50 a share in
late New York Stock Exchange trading.
   But Mannesmann shares dropped by nearly 2.8 percent in domestic
trading after the announcement, on what traders called
profit-taking following a recent runup in the stock due to
speculation about the phone license.
   ``Everybody got carried away by the idea that Mannesmann got a
license for printing money, but for the next three years we will
see only costs,'' said Beate von der Seipen, a London stock analyst.

<HEAD>MeraBank To Get $450 Million From Pinnacle West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pinnacle West Capital Corp. agreed to inject $450
million into its troubled thrift subsidiary, MeraBank, just hours
before tough, new federal capital standards for thrifts took affect
Thursday.
   The agreement, announced late Wednesday, settled months of
negotiations between Pinnacle West and the Office of Thrift
Supervision over the federal agency's demand that Pinnacle West
inject $510 million into MeraBank.
   Pinnacle West has received a $1.87 billion takeover offer from
PacifiCorp., the utility company based in Portland, Ore. PacifiCorp
executives were upbeat that the settlement would clear the way for
a deal.
   ``This agreement ... should free Pinnacle West to devote full
attention to addressing the offer from PacifiCorp. We are eager to
move ahead,'' PacifiCorp Executive Vice President Verl Topham said
in a statement.
   Under terms of its agreement with regulators, Pinnacle West will
give MeraBank $300 million by March 31, 1990 and a $150 million
unsecured note.
   The OTS said the ``fair and reasonable'' settlement would avoid
costly litigation. Pinnacle West had threated to seek bankruptcy
protection if it could not reach an agreement with bank regulators.
   Pinnacle West said its board will consider the PacifiCorp offer
on an unspecified date.
   The bid, which is conditioned upon Pinnacle West disposing of
MeraBank, is an expansion of an earlier PacifiCorp offer to buy
Arizona Public Service Co., a Pinnacle West subsidiary and
Arizona's largest utility.
   Pinnacle West Chairman Keith Turley said the MeraBank settlement
would not affect the PacifiCorp offer even though APS common stock
would be used as collateral to secure financing for the cash
infusion into MeraBank.
   Renz Jennings, chairman of the three-member Arizona Corporation
Commission, which regulates utilities, voiced concern over the link
with APS.
   He said the commission ``is deeply concerned about the
possibility that Pinnacle West creditors will look to (APS) for
repayment.''
   But Turley countered that ``it's illogical for anybody to think
that APS would assume the debt obligations of Pinnacle West. It's
impossible and illegal for APS to raise its rates to pay our
interest on debt.''
   MeraBank Chairman Gene Rice called the infusion ``an important
beginning of the recapitalization of MeraBank'' and said the
thrift, which has been hard hit by Arizona's real estate slump,
would be able to get back on its feet eventually. But he cautioned
that the market ``is going down, and we will continue to have
losses in the short term.''
   MeraBank lost $209 million in 1988 and $105 million in the first
six months of this year, with a projected loss of about the same
amount in the last six months.
   Jennings criticized the settlement for saddling Pinnacle West
``with additional debt at a time when the company can ill afford
it, and leaves ownership of MeraBank in the hands of Pinnacle West
with no assurance that losses will not continue to mount.''
   In addition to APS and MeraBank, Pinnacle West also owns three
small subsidiaries involved in mining, real estate development and
investments.

   One of the customers on Denny
Grinwald's Lake Michigan charter boat this summer put the hard
times facing the lake's sport fishing businesses into painfully
clear perspective.
   ``He said, `Captain, I understand there's bad news and good news
on the lake. ... The bad news is I can't eat the fish I catch. The
good news is I'm not going to be able to catch one.'''
   Grinwald, president of the Michigan Charter Boat Association,
isn't laughing.
   What was, by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates, the
cornerstone of a $1.6 billion Great Lakes fishery for Michigan in
1985 has weakened dramatically.
   A bacterial disease seems to be decimating the lake's
bread-and-butter sport fish, chinook salmon. And this summer, the
National Wildlife Federation issued a controversial warning that
chemical contamination was making the fish a risky meal.
   Low catches and fish consumption warnings drove 140 Michigan
charter boats off the lake this year, leaving 876 operators where
two years ago there were more than 1,000, Grinwald said Wednesday.
   More are expected to leave by spring.
   ``I know at least six boats from Ludington that will go to New
York next year,'' Ludington charter captain Jim Lacko said.
``That's bad. When you lose charter boats, you start losing motel
rooms.''
   Lacko estimates he lost half of his business in the past two
years. ``The fishing is just not there,'' he said.
   Wisconsin's creel surveys show a 50 percent drop in the number
of chinook salmon caught, said Mike Hansen, a Wisconsin Department
of Natural Resources fish specialist in Madison.
   Michigan surveys map a drop in the amount of time sport
fishermen spent on the lake _ down from 3.5 million hours spent at
nine ports in the mid-1980s to an estimated 1.8 million hours this
year, said Gerald Rakoczy, Michigan Department of Natural Resources
biologist in Charlevoix.
   The chinook catch alone in the region from Ludington to
Frankfort _ along the middle western coast of Lake Michigan along
Michigan's Lower Peninsula _ dropped from 242,000 fish in May and
August of 1986 to 34,000 chinook the same period this year,
Grinwald said.
   Chinook salmon, introduced into Lake Michigan more than 25 years
ago to control an alien alewife population, are the dominant sport
fish in the lake and make up more than half the catch, according to
Wisconsin record keepers.
   The salmon sport fishing industry supports not only charter
operations but has helped revitalize many coastal towns.
   ``I've always felt the economic clout of the Great Lakes sport
fishery is greatly undervalued,'' said James Kitchell, a University
of Wisconsin-Madison researcher. ``You see potted geraniums on the
pilings in Grand Haven (Mich.) where before that was nothing; you
get boatels in marinas. It is the single most remarkable thing
that's happened in fishery management.''
   Dramatic declines in the salmon population can only be bad for
the coastal economy, Kitchell said.
   Wright said he is unsure the lake again will host the fishery _
created by overstocking of chinook salmon and an abundance of
alewife _ that kept charter boat operators booked solid in the
early 1980s.
   ``Some of the marginal operations obviously are going to drop
out,'' he said. ``The hard core _ 270 to 400 charter operations _
are still going to be there. They'll fish for what is available.''
   Lake Michigan is still a good place to fish, Grinwald said.
``It's just not the fantastic, incredible fishery it was.''

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Futures Prices Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower in
sluggish trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The slide in wheat prices was due to the release Wednesday of
the National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast, which calls
for precipitation in the winter wheat crop areas, said analyst
Susan Leighty of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Wheat futures received little support from news the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has approved an offer by the Soviet Union
for 410,000 metric tons of wheat under the department's Export
Enhancement Program.
   Under the program, private exporters can sell U.S. commodities
at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in some markets and
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Corn futures traded in a narrow range, finishing lower as
professionals and commission houses liquidated their long positions.
   Soybean prices continue to be weighed down by a lack of export
business and continuing good planting conditions in South America.
   Ms. Leighty said that overall, futures prices may have been held
down by the lack of announcements from the grain talks between the
United States and the Soviet Union. The first round of negotiations
in Moscow to reach a new long-term grain pact ended Thursday. The
two sides plan to meet again in February.
   At the close, wheat prices were { cent to 2{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.08 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 2{ cents lower with December at $2.36 a bushel; oats
were a \ cent to a { cent lower with December at $1.44 a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents to 7\ cents lower with January at $5.75{ a

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC reported Thursday that its
net profit jumped 23 percent during its fiscal year, boosted by
higher revenue from its food, beverage and retailing operations.
   The British conglomerate said its profit for the year ended
Sept. 30 rose to 508 million pounds, or around $823 million, from
412 million pounds, or $667 million, the year before.
   Per-share earnings increased 18.6 percent to 55.6 pence, or 87
cents, from 46.9 pence, or 74 cents.
   Grand Met bought Pillsbury Co. of the United States for $5.75
billion earlier this year.
   Revenue for the year soared 54.2 percent to 9.3 billion pounds,
or $14.6 billion, from 6.03 billion pounds, or $9.5 billion.
   The gains included proceeds from the sale of the company's
Intercontinental Hotels and London Clubs in December 1988 for more
than 500 million pounds, or $810 million.
   The greatest impact on the company's results came from
Pillsbury, which contributed 2.5 billion pounds, or $3.9 billion,
to total revenue.
   Grand Met said intense activity to integrate Pillsbury has
included the sale of non-strategic businesses, such as its Bumble
Bee and Van de Kamp foods operations.
   ``All parts of the business are performing strongly and
management morale is high,'' the company said.
   Burger King, the fast-food chain which was owned by Pillsbury,
contributed 76 million pounds, or $119 million, to Grand Met's
operating profit. The parent company said it will take time for the
benefits of a recent restructuring and quality improvement program
to bear fruit, but ``the fundamentals of this business are very
sound.''
   Grand Met said sales from its food businesses, including those
that were part of Pillsbury, were strong in all divisions and are
expected to climb 5 percent in the current quarter.
   But the slowdown in the British economy has been especially
evident in the company's liquor sales over the last 12 to 15
months, said Grand Met Chairman Allen Sheppard.
   The company likely will make further acquisitions and sales in
the coming year but it is now prepared to consolidate its current
businesses in food, beverages and retailing, Sheppard said.
   Grand Met didn't report quarterly or half-year results. It is
not required to do so under British law.

   GTE Corp.'s board of directors adopted a
plan Thursday to protect the company from hostile takeovers.
   The plan will allow shareholders to buy discounted stock in GTE
if anyone buys 20 percent of the Stamford-based telecommunications
company without GTE's permission. Under certain conditions, they
could also buy stock in an acquiring company at a discount if GTE
disapproved of the merger.
   ``The plan is not aimed at preventing a takeover of GTE,'' said
James L. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer. ``It is
designed to encourage a buyer to negotiate with the board and to
prevent abusive share-accumulation tactics. The rights will help
the board ensure that all GTE shareholders realize the value of
their investment in the company.''
   Johnson said he was not aware of any efforts to take over the
company.
   GTE said similar rights plans have been adopted by other
telecommunications companies, including Americtech, Bell Atlantic
Corp. and Nynex Corp.
   GTE had combined revenues and sales of $16.5 billion and net
income of $1.2 billion last year from its telecommunications,
lighting and precision materials businesses.

<HEAD>Truck Maker Takes Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navistar International Corp. on Thursday reported
a $13 million fourth-quarter loss and said reduced industrywide
demand for trucks and higher costs for purchased components
contributed to the decline.
   The truck and diesel engine maker said it lost 8 cents a share
on sales of $1 billion compared with a profit for the year-earlier
period of $82 million or 29 cents a share on sales of $1.2 billion.
   For fiscal 1989, which ended Oct. 31, Navistar earned $87
million or 23 cents a share on sales of $4.2 billion, down from
1988 annual profits of $244 million or 84 cents a share on sales of
$4.3 billion, the company said in a statement.
   Navistar Chairman James C. Cotting blamed the fourth-quarter
performance on reduced demand for medium and heavy trucks, higher
costs for components and lower sales of service parts and diesel
engines to other vehicle makers.
   Annual earnings were lowered by the ``excess costs'' of adding
27 new truck models and of phasing in a new paint system at
Navistar's Springfield, Ohio, plant, the company said. Navistar
spokesman Bill Greenhouse said the company underestimated the cost
of introducing the new models.
   The company also said it expects to post a 1990 first-quarter
loss, because of ``lower truck and engine sales, increased material
and component costs, and continued intense price discounting by
truck manufacturers.''

   Stock prices lost ground today as traders
awaited the latest report on employment.
   Analysts said hopes had dimmed a bit this week that the Federal
Reserve might soon relax its credit policy further.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell slightly in today's
activity, pushing up their yields to the 7.91 percent-7.95 percent
range.
   Brokers said optimism about the chances for fresh declines in
interest rates could be revived if Friday's monthly report from the
Labor Department on the employment situation provides evidence that
economic growth remains sluggish.
   But traders seemed reluctant to hold positions exposing them to
any surprises in the figures.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street call for the November data to
show an increase of about 150,000 in nonfarm payroll employment.

<HEAD>Paulson Says Bid for Gulfstream to be Ready Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. Chairman Allen
E. Paulson says he will be ready in about a week to present a bid
to buy back the company he founded.
   Chrysler Corp. announced Wednesday it plans to sell its Chrysler
Technologies Corp. subsidiary, which includes Savannah-based
Gulfstream, acquired by the nation's No. 3 automaker in 1985.
   Paulson immediately resigned from the Chrysler board of
directors and took a leave of absence from Gulfstream to pursue a
potential purchase of all or some of Chrysler Technologies.
   He told a gathering of Gulfstream workers in Savannah Wednesday
that he is mainly interested in acquiring Gulfstream, though he
would try to buy all of Chrysler Technologies if that's what is
necessary to get the corporate aircraft maker he founded.
   Paulson told the workers that if he made a successful bid for
Chrysler Technologies, he would subsequently attempt to sell the
other parts of that company _ Electrospace Systems and Airborne
Systems.
   Paulson said he believes he will need about a week to prepare
his offer, and will then return to work at Gulfstream.
   ``I have a contract (with Chrysler) to fulfill a year at
Gulfstream,'' he said.
   Paulson ruled out the possibility of a management-led buyout of
Gulfstream financed through bonds. ``I am working with banks. I am
interested in bank financing and putting my own assets to work,''
he said.
   Chrysler paid $637 million for Gulfstream in 1985. The vast
majority of Chrysler Technologies' 1988 revenue of $1.3 billion
stems from Gulfstream, said John Stellman, a spokesman for Chrysler
Technologies. Total Chrysler Corp. revenues in 1988 were $35.5
billion.
   Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris said the company would consider
selling all of Chrysler Technologies or just part, depending on the
offers it receives.
   ``Chrysler would look at the best return for Chrysler
shareholders,'' he said.
   Harris said Chrysler already has received several inquiries for
part or all of Chrysler Technologies, but ``at this time we do not
have any firm offers on the table.''
   Chrysler said it has hired First Boston Corp. to advise it on
the sale of the aerospace and military technologies division. It
did not disclose what price it might seek.
   John Zimmerman, president of Aviation Data Service in Wichita,
Kan., an aviation information and consulting service, said
Paulson's chances of acquiring Gulfstream are excellent.
   ``Mr. Paulson is a very brilliant man with insight to the
aviation industry. It is not inconceivable that somebody would work
with Mr. Paulson in financing a deal,'' he said.
   Chrysler Technologies' Electrospace Systems and Airborne Systems
divisions specialize in the production of military reconnaissance
and surveillance equipment.

<HEAD>Diet Pepsi Jingle Becomes Battle Hymn in Cola Wars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diet Pepsi's new ``The Right One'' advertising
jingle has become a battle hymn for the cola wars, with the ad
agency for rival Diet Coke disputing who owns the idea for the tune.
   The song was picked up for Diet Pepsi after a similar version
apparently was offered to rival Diet Coke as well as Budweiser beer.
   Coke's ad agency, Lintas:New York, complains that it should have
been given the chance to buy the song before it was offered to
anyone else, while Pepsi is calling the protest a simple publicity
stunt by its rival cola maker.
   Stone Roberts, executive vice president of Lintas:New York, said
the song used in the Diet Pepsi television spot was written last
year for Diet Coke, although it never was used publicly.
   Roberts said he fired off a complaint letter to Sunday
Productions, the New York music house that developed the song,
after hearing the similar song in a Diet Pepsi ad during the
Thanksgiving weekend.
   ``I'd like to believe they (Pepsi) didn't know it was ours and
didn't buy it in a direct attempt to copy the industry leader,''
Roberts said Thursday.
   But Hilary Lipsitz, president of Sunday Productions, said it was
ludicrous for Coke or its ad agency to say they own the song.
   Lipsitz said he offered the song to other companies, including
Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos., after Coke rejected it for a
possible ad campaign dubbed ``The Real One.''
   ``There was no interest from Coca-Cola. It was our song,''
Lipsitz said Thursday. ``It's pretty much as if they came to Irving
Berlin and said, `Write me a song' and didn't use it. Whose song
would it be?''
   Lipsitz said the tune was among several he presented to Pepsi.
   Roberts said Diet Coke wanted a song as a back-up to its current
ad campaign ``if and when the day came where we needed a
substitute.''
   ``Sunday Productions brought back some pieces of music developed
from our concept,'' Roberts said, adding that Sunday was paid a
$10,000 ``demo fee.'' A commercial was prepared and then ``put on
the shelf'' for possible use later, he said.
   Roberts said Lintas should have been given the opportunity to
buy the song outright before it was offered to anyone else. The
agency is considering legal action, he said.
   Officials at the ad agency BBDO Worldwide who work on the Diet
Pepsi account, did not immediately return telephone calls Thursday.
   Becky Madeira, a spokeswoman at Pepsi Cola's Purchase, N.Y.,
headquarters called the complaints a publicity stunt by
Atlanta-based rival Coke.
   ``It's hard to find any other reason for all of this,'' she
said. ``I understand the press had copies of the letters of
complaint before the principals.''
   Ms. Madeira said Diet Pepsi has been using the ``Right One''
slogan since August but hadn't heard any complaints until the
television commercial appeared last month. She also said Pepsi's
application for a trademark for ``The Right One'' was made in July
and drew no objection from Coke.
   She said it is not unusual for companies to choose from several
songs when considering an ad campaign.
   Ms. Madeira also said Pepsi looks for music that reflects the
character of its products, so it would be pointless to seek a song
belonging to a competitor.
   ``It's hard to imagine that would make sense for either
company,'' she said. ``Why would you advertise the personality of a
competitor's product?''

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Higher In Dull Dealings</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede: LONDON</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed marginally higher against most
foreign currencies Thursday, but trading was light and uneventful.
   Gold prices scored large gains in U.S. dealings after finishing
somewhat higher in Europe. Technical factors were cited for driving
prices higher.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
ended at $410 a troy ounce, up $5.10 an ounce from late Wednesday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a troy ounce of gold
bullion at $409.60 as of 4 p.m. EST, $5 higher than Wednesday's
late bid.
   Traders said the dollar traded within a very narrow range
throughout the session, closing near the highs of the day partly on
technical factors.
   Most dealers were awaiting the Labor Department's release on
Friday of unemployment data for November. The consensus is that the
report will show an increase of roughly 150,000 jobs, lower than
the 233,000 jobs added during the previous month, and an
unemployment rate of 5.4 percent.
   Unfavorable employment data indicate the economy is slowing and
could help encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
Lower interest rates are bearish for the dollar because they
decrease the value of dollar-denominated securities.
   ``Everybody is convinced that U.S. (interest) rates will go
down,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.
   Separately, the West German mark continued to flex its muscle.
Traders noted the mark remained extremely strong, particularly
against the Japanese yen.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar edged up 0.38 Japanese yen to a closing 144.13
yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 144.33 yen. In New York, the
dollar closed at 144.31 yen, up from 144.03 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.5750, from $1.5765 late
Wednesday. But in New York it cost $1.5780 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Wednesday's $1.5765.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday included: 1.7725 West German marks, up from 1.7660;
1.5900 Swiss francs, up from 1.5895; 6.0515 French francs, up from
6.0335; 1.1618 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1612, and 1,307.25
Italian lire, up from 1.303.25.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.7720 West German marks, up from 1.7648; 1.5920 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5875; 6.0560 French francs, up from 6.0315;
1.9935 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0010; 1,308.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,301.15, and 1.1625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1602.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $404.25 a troy ounce
from $402.25 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $404.00, from $403.75 bid late Wednesday. Earlier in
Hong Kong, gold rose $4.30 to close at a bid $405.01.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.60 a
troy ounce from $5.56 bid late Wednesday. On New York's Comex,
silver for current delivery closed at $5.623 a troy ounce, up from
Wednesday's $5.555.

   Here are some of the computer makers that cut jobs in 1989
through layoffs or voluntary separation incentives:
   International Business Machines Corp.: In September announced
separation incentive program to eliminate 600 to 1,000 jobs. In
December announced new incentive program to eliminate 10,000 more
jobs. No layoffs.
   Unisys Corp.: In August announced plan to cut 6,000 to 7,000
jobs. In October raised number to about 8,000, composed of 6,300
layoffs and 1,700 reductions through voluntary resignations and
early retirement.
   Wang Laboratories Inc.: Laid off 2,200 employees by the end of
September. Last month announced plans for 2,000 more layoffs.
   Amdahl Corp.: In November announced the layoff of 400 workers in
Sunnyvale, Calif., about 5 percent of its work force.
   Digital Equipment Corp.: In September announced elimination of
700 manufacturing jobs in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Offered
retraining and relocation to all affected workers. Anticipated
about 200 would instead choose a package of separation incentives.
Froze salaries for six months. No layoffs.
   Control Data Corp.: In April announced it would exit the
supercomputer business and take other steps that would cost 3,100
jobs.
   Bull HN Information Systems Inc.: In January the company, then
named Honeywell Bull Inc., announced plans to cut 1,600 jobs
through a combination of layoffs and attrition.
   Data General Corp.: In October it announced it would elminate
2,200 jobs, coming on the heels of a reduction in its work force
from 16,000 to 14,000 over the past two years.
   Prime Computer Inc.: Announced in October it would lay off 2,500
workers, or almost 20 percent of its work force, as part of a
restructuring of the minicomputer maker after its billion-dollar
buyout by J.M. Whitney &amp; Co., an investment firm.

<HEAD>Soviet Deputies Talk With Boeing About Buying Long-Range Jets</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto SE1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inability of the Soviet Union's national
airline to provide the service and comfort its citizens want has
created the market for a new carrier _ one that might fly
American-made jets, according to two members of the Soviet
parliament.
   Valeri Voskoboinikov, vice chairman of the Soviet Transport,
Communication and Information Commission, and commission member
Vladimir Yerohin were part of a delegation representing
Aviakompania Sverkhdalnikh Avialiniy, or ASDA.
   The new company was formed last summer to explore creation of a
new, long-range Soviet airline to be run independent of the
government and compete with government-owned Aeroflot.
   The delegation has been gathering information about possible
acquisitions of Boeing jetliners.
   The idea for ASDA, said Voskoboinikov, came from Aeroflot pilots
and aircraft engineers tired of the carrier's bureaucracy.
   ``In this situation, Aeroflot is the only airline in the Soviet
Union,'' he said. ``It cannot provide good service for the Soviet
citizens and cannot provide satisfactory management.''
   This year alone there were 20 million potential passengers who
couldn't be served by Aeroflot, Yerohin said, noting that was the
official figure and ``the real number is probably higher.''
   In addition to being the non-communist world's largest maker of
jetliners, Boeing in the past 40 years has produced some of this
country's deadliest weapons for use against the Soviets, including
the B-52 bomber and Minuteman and air-launched cruise missiles.
   Boeing already sells jets to China, Poland and other communist
nations.
   Aeroflot, the world's largest airline, already has ordered
Airbus Industrie A-310 jets and has talked with Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. about possible commercial jet purchases.
   Voskoboinikov, 34, from Northwest Siberia, is a helicopter pilot
and aeronautical engineer. Yerohin, also 34 and an aircraft
engineer, is from Gorky. Neither is a member of the Communist Party.
   Neither they nor Boeing would say much about their talks,
including how many planes ASDA might want or what type. Nor would
they say much about the airline's financial arrangements.
   Much of that hasn't been decided, Voskoboinikov said, including
whether the new carrier might have some Western investment or be a
joint venture with a foreign airline. The goal is to have an
airline ``totally independent financially'' of the Soviet
government.
   He and Yerohin stressed the delegation came to the United States
only to gather information to study later. They said it was invited
by Boeing and did not plan to visit McDonnell Douglas on this trip.
   ASDA officials previously have said they were interested in 25
Boeing 747-400s, but neither of the two Soviet deputies would say
how many of those long-range jumbo jets or other planes ASDA might
want to buy or lease.
   A 747-400 costs $125 million or more and Boeing is booked solid
with orders through the mid-1990s. ASDA hopes to start up by late
1991.
   ``Right now, negotiations are in process and we cannot really
tell you what the plans and operations are,'' he said. ``But I can
tell you the atmosphere of the negotiations is good.''
   The Soviet aerospace industry produces a wide variety of
passenger and cargo jets and both Voskoboinikov and Yerohin said
they are about the same as Boeing planes in reliability. But they
can't match the levels of comfort in Western aircraft, and Boeing
planes are far more economical to run, Vokoboinikov said.
   He also says Soviet planebuilders won't like the competition.
   ``They will not be happy about it. But at the same time, they
will realize they should improve their service,'' Vokoboinikov
said. ``Ultimately, the usage of new foreign airplanes will cause
improvement of the domestic industry, which will be good for it.''
   Routes and destinations haven't been decided, but Voskobionikov
said they want to fly ``to practically all parts of the world''
with both passenger and cargo service.
   Aeroflot flies an estimated 8,100 aircraft to more than 3,700
destinations. ASDA won't be able to replace that, Voskobionikov
said, but there is a market.
   ``There probably will be clientele for both airlines. ... And
our passengers are not used to good service, like they are here,''
he said.

   Energy futures prices ended mixed Thursday as
heating oil staged another weather-related advance.
   The No. 2 heating oil contract for January delivery shot up 1.01
cents to 65.47 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract traded as high as 65.80 cents during the session after
closing up 0.41 cent on Wednesday.
   Contracts for February through April delivery also gained while
longer-term contracts declined.
   Among other refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which gained 0.33 cent on
Wednesday, fell 0.36 cent to finish at 52.81 cents a gallon. Most
other contracts also declined.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade
of U.S. crude oil, edged up 4 cents to $20.51 per 42-gallon barrel.
The contract traded as high at $20.65 during the session after
Wednesday's gain of 13 cents. Other contracts closed mixed.
   Energy analysts said cold weather as well as strength in
Europe's gasoil market continued to make U.S. heating oil
attractive to buyers. Heating oil's strength gave the overall
market a lift, they said.
   Low water levels in the Rhine River have created problems for
barges transporting gasoil, the European version of U.S. home
heating oil. Bullishness in Europe's gasoil market has trickled
into the U.S. market.
   ``Today saw continued strength in heating oil due to cold
weather here and in Europe and the low River Rhine,'' said Peter
Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures
Inc.
   Richard Redoglio, energy analyst for Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures, said profit-taking helped depress prices in the gasoline
pits.
   ``People were selling gas against heating oil,'' Redoglio said.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Broadcasting Buys Eight Radio Stations for $360 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. said Thursday it
had completed its previously-disclosed plans to buy eight
Metropolitan-Legacy radio stations in a $360 million deal that it
called the biggest ever in radio.
   The purchase gives Westinghouse Broadcasting 21 radio stations
with an average cumulative audience of 14.1 million people a week,
second only to the 15 million-plus commanded by the 21 stations
owned by Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting, also known as Group W, is buying the
stations from Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp. and Legacy
Broadcasting, which are controlled by broadcaster and financier
Robert F.X. Sillerman.
   Sillerman and his partners will retain a minority interest in
Group W Radio, which a source familiar with the deal said was less
than 10 percent.
   Group W, which is an operating unit of Westinghouse Electric
Corp. of Pittsburgh, announced in April it had agreed to buy 10
Metropolitan-Legacy stations in a deal reportedly valued at about
$385 million.
   But in the meantime, Metropolitan found a local buyer for its
two radio stations in Minneapolis and they were dropped from the
deal with Group W.
   The newly-acquired stations are WNEW-FM in New York; WMMR-FM in
Philadelphia; WCRX-FM and WCPT-AM in Washington, D.C.; WLLZ-FM in
Detroit; KILT-AM and KILT-FM in Houston and KTWV-FM in Los Angeles.
   ``Our acquisition of these extremely successful stations allows
us to compete for radio advertising revenue in nine of the top 10
U.S. markets,'' said Burton B. Staniar, chairman of Group W.
   He said the addition of the youth-oriented FM radio stations in
New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia to the company's AM
news-format stations in those cities will enable Westinghouse to
offer appealing package deals to advertisers in those markets.
   Staniar said the deal also gives Group W programming diversity
and size ``that makes our entry into the radio network and program
syndication businesses more financially attractive.''
   As it completed its purchase of the eight stations, Westinghouse
relinquished control of KODA-FM, its FM radio station in Houston.
Federal regulations prohibit companies from owning two FM radio
stations in the same market. The station was placed in a trust and
is being sold in a separate transaction to New York-based Command
Communications for $22 million.
   Group W Radio's other stations are: WBZ, Boston; WINS, New York;
KYW, Philadelphia; KDKA, Pittsburgh; WMAQ, Chicago; KQZY, Dallas;
KQXT, San Antonio; KMEO-AM and KMEO-FM, Phoenix; KFWB, Los Angeles;
KFBK-AM and KAER, Sacramento; and KJQY, San Diego.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting's other units are Group W Television,
which owns five network-affiliated television stations; Group W
Productions, a programming and synidication company, and Group W
Satellite Communications, a cable programming, marketing and
distribution business based in Stamford, Conn.

   Precious metals futures prices rose sharply Thursday on New
York's Commodity Exchange in reaction to a decline in prices on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   In other markets, grains and soybeans were lower; cotton
plunged; livestock and pork futures were mixed, and energy prices
were mostly lower.
   Gold settled $4.10 to $5.10 higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $410.00 a troy ounce; silver was 6.5 cents
to 7.2 cents higher with December at $5.623 a troy ounce.
   ``The sharp fall in the stock market caused a flight to quality
buying ... in the precious metals market,'' said analyst Jim Steel
of Refco Inc. in New York.
   Steel noted that many things have caused movement in precious
metals prices, including dollar strength or weakness, interest
rates and inflation.
   ``But what has given gold its bold moves (upward) have been the
declines in the stock market,'' he said
   Silver prices followed gold in Thursday's upward surge, helped
along by the perception that the metal has been sharply oversold in
recent sessions, Steel said.
   Cotton futures were sharply lower on the New York Cotton
Exchange as traders had difficulty unloading offerings because of a
lack of buyers.
   At one time, the March contract was down the limit before
recovering some losses, said analyst Ed Whitten of Balfour Maclaine
Corp in New York.
   Whitten noted that commission houses were active sellers as
prices moved below several support levels.
   Cotton was .23 cent to 1.55 cents lower with December at 63.97
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower in sluggish
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The slide in wheat prices was due to the release Wednesday of
the National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast, which calls
for precipitation in the winter wheat crop areas, said analyst
Susan Leighty of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Wheat futures received little support from news the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has approved an offer by the Soviet Union
for 410,000 metric tons of wheat under the department's Export
Enhancement Program.
   Under the program, private exporters can sell U.S. commodities
at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in some markets and
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Corn futures traded in a narrow range, finishing lower as
professionals and commission houses liquidated their long positions.
   Soybean prices continue to be weighed down by a lack of export
business and continuing good planting conditions in South America.
   Wheat was { cent to 2} cents lower with December at $4.08 a
bushel; corn was 2{ cents lower to a \ cent higher with December at
$2.36\ a bushel; oats were a \ cent lower to a { cent higher with
December at $1.44 a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 7\ cents
lower with January at $5.75{ a bushel.
   Energy futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
prices fluctuated widely during moderate trading.
   Heating oil continued to provide strength to the market, as
another blast of cold weather is expected in the Northeast in
coming days, analsyts say.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 3 cents lower to 4 cents
higher with January at $20.51 a barrel; heating oil was .30 cent
lower to 1.01 cents higher with January at 65.47 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .36 cent lower to .07 cent higher with
January at 52.81 cent a gallon.
   Livestock futures were mostly lower and pork futures down
sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Pork belly futures were down the limit in a wave of commission
house selling. The selling was prompted by continued concern over
the large amount of bellies going into storage and accelerated by
the activation of sell-stops.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December
at 75.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .03
cent higher with January at 82.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent
lower to .72 cent higher with December at 51.22 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower with February at 54.45 cents
a pound.

<UNK>Manville Suspends Discussions on Stock Repurchase Offer</UNK>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. has announced that it has suspended
talks with the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust and will
not pursue the company's announced offer to repurchase $500 million
of Manville preferred stock from the trust.
   Manville said talks will continue with the trust on ways to
improve the trust's financial flexibility and increase value for
all shareholders.
   Cathy Fischer, a spokesman for the trust in Washington, D.C.,
said the trust was trying to raise cash to pay claims. She said
Manville has stipulations on how stock can be sold to raise money,
and Manville wanted to buy some of its stock back. However, the two
sides disagreed over how much that stock was worth.
   She said the fund is scheduled to receive profit-sharing funds
in 1991 based on 1990 profits, but in the meantime, the fund is
running short on cash.
   ``We're exploring our options,'' she said.
   Fischer said Manville wanted to help, ``But we're dealing with
reality. We want to do what's right for the trust fund,'' she said.
   Dave Samson, spokesman for the company, said the two sides
disagreed on some of the restrictive covenants but declined to be
specific.
   The trust was created as part of Manville's bankruptcy
reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos, who had filed
suit against the company. The trust was created Nov. 28, 1988, when
Manville emerged from its Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings.
   So far, the trust has paid more than 15,000 personal injury
claims totaling more than $600 million.
   The trust has assets including 50 percent of Manville's new
common stock, convertible preferred stock, a $1.8 billion bond, and
20 percent of net profits, beginning in 1992.

   Stock prices pulled back Thursday as traders
awaited the latest report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 15.99 points to
2,720.78.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
622 up, 843 down and 530 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.98 million
shares, up from 145.85 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 197.60 million shares.
   More than half of the Dow's decline was accounted for by a
5\-point drop, to 66}, in the stock of Chevron Corp., which had
been widely rumored as a potential takeover target.
   Pennzoil, which was up | at 83\, said it had acquired 8.8
percent of Chevron's stock and might buy more, but had no present
plans for a takeover bid.
   Otherwise, analysts said hopes had dimmed a bit this week that
the Federal Reserve might soon relax its credit policy further.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell slightly in Thursday's
activity, pushing up their yields to the 7.91 percent-7.95 percent
range.
   Brokers said optimism about the chances for fresh declines in
interest rates could be revived if Friday's monthly report from the
Labor Department on the employment situation provides evidence that
economic growth remains sluggish.
   But traders seemed reluctant to hold positions exposing them to
any surprises in the figures.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street call for the November data to
show an increase of about 150,000 in nonfarm payroll employment.
   Pinnacle West led the active list and jumped 4~ to 10\. The
company agreed to provide $450 million in cash and securities to
its Merabank savings and loan subsidiary, meeting a condition of an
offer for Pinnacle West made last week by Pacificorp.
   Inland Steel, which lowered its fourth-quarter earnings
projection late Wednesday, lost 2} to 31{.
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi dropped 1 to 12{. On Wednesday the
international advertising concern announced a loss for the fiscal
year ended Sept. 30.
   Aside from Chevron, losers among the blue chips included
International Business Machines, down | at 98; American Express,
down { at 34{; Eastman Kodak, down { at 42{, and Coca-Cola, down {
at 76~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $7.59 billion, or 0.22
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .44 to 192.38.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .82 to 397.89, and S&amp;P's

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Nov. 27, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,207.9 billion from $3,200.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,052.3 billion from $4,049.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $792.9 billion from $790.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.8 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.8 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,175.2 billion, a 8.0
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,027.5 billion, up 3.3 percent, while M1
rose 5.5 percent to an average of $785.7 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $3.188 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $150 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$656 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $569
million in the two weeks ended Nov. 29, down from $618 million in
the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $294.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Nov. 29, up from $292.4 billion two weeks earlier.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. stock fell sharply
Thursday amid reports of a huge recapitalization plan that would
inject up to $1 billion into the ailing brokerage.
   Shearson has been under increasing pressure in recent weeks to
take steps to improve its profitability and avoid a credit
downgrading that would tarnish the firm's reputation and increase
its borrowing costs.
   American Express Co., which owns 61 percent of Shearson,
reportedly is planning a public sale of 10 million to 22 million
shares of Shearson stock and a direct investment of about $300
million to raise new capital.
   In addition, Revlon Inc. Chairman Ronald O. Perelman reportedly
is holding talks about buying a 9.9 percent stake in Shearson for
about $250 million.
   Lawrence A. Armour, an American Express senior vice president,
confirmed his company is ``reviewing a number of options'' in
regard to Shearson. But he said it would be ``inappropriate to
discuss any details.''
   Armour said the review process has been under way for several
weeks.
   Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill declined comment on the
recapitalization reports.
   Shearson closed down $1.75, or about 10.6 percent, at $14.75 a
share in New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock rose $1.37{
Wednesday on reports that Perelman might buy up to a 20 percent
interest in the company.
   Analysts pegged Thursday's drop to the lower stake Perelman
would have in the latest purported proposal _ reducing the
possibility of a takeover _ and to the potential dilution of shares
under any new stock issue.
   `There's no way the common shareholder comes out well in this,''
said analyst Lawrence Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., in San Francisco.
   Shearson stock has slumped for several months because of poor
earnings reports. The company began searching for new capital after
Moody's Investors Service in October said it was considering
downgrading its credit on $4.8 billion in long-term Shearson debt.
   Shearson recently began laying off 800 workers, reducing the
size of the nation's second-largest brokerage to 35,700, reshuffled
its senior management and slashed stockbroker commissions for the
first time in 15 years.
   A downgrading by Moody's would increase Shearson's cost of
borrowing by about $10 million to $15 million a year, Eckenfelder
said. Securities firms borrow heavily to finance finance trading
and other activities.
   More important, analysts said, American Express wants to avoid
any loss of reputation. ``There's a sense that it's important for
the owners to maintain Shearson as a top credit,'' Eckenfelder said.
   Under the reported recapitalization proposal, American Express
would reduce its Shearson holding to under 50 percent through the
new offering and the Perelman deal. That would allow the credit
card, travel and financial service company to remove Shearson from
its financial statements.
   Eckenfelder said selling securities in a brokerage might prove
difficult because of slumping conditions throughout the industry.
   The proposed recapitalization would dilute the holdings of
Shearson's second-largest stockholder, Nippon Life Insurance of
Japan, to about 10 percent from 13 percent.
   The proposal was reported in The New York Times and The Wall
Street Journal, which cited unidentified sources.
   Earlier reports said Perelman would have been able to obtain
about 20 percent of Shearson's stock if he exercised all of his
stock options under the deal as originally proposed. But the Times
said the proposed transaction was altered to make it less complex.
   While any such deal would provide needed capital for Shearson,
some analysts have cautioned that further dividing the ownership of
Shearson among three or more large outsiders could prove to be a
headache for executives under pressure to turn around the firm's
slumping profits.
   Moody's said it was mulling a possible credit rating downgrade
for Shearson's bonds and commercial paper due to the firm's low
level of capital, low profits and exposure in commercial real
estate loans and investments, as well as the general slump in
brokerage activity.

   Pennzoil Co., using cash won in a lawsuit against
Texaco Inc., revealed Thursday it had purchased $2.1 billion worth
of stock in Chevron Corp., the nation's fourth largest oil company.
   Pennzoil's purchase amounts to about 8.8 percent of Chevron, and
Pennzoil said it was considering spending another $500 million to
buy more Chevron stock. That would boost its stake to more than 10
percent and use up all the net proceeds of its payment from Texaco.
   The disclosure came in a letter to shareholders and filings with
the federal Security and Exchange Commission.
   ``This position has been acquired as a long-term investment,''
Houston-based Pennzoil told shareholders. ``Pennzoil has no
interest in attempting to take over Chevron.''
   The company said it analyzed the possibility of buying up to 18
percent of Chevron's stock but ``has no current plans or
proposals'' to do so.
   The announcement helped deflate takeover speculation that had
surrounded Chevron. Chevron stock dropped $5.25 to close at $66.75
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Pennzoil rose 62{ cents to close at $83.25 as some investors
speculated that Chevron might try to turn the tables and buy
Pennzoil's stake or even buy all of Pennzoil.
   ``The perception by some investors is that Chevron's response
will be to turn around and buy Pennzoil to make the problem go
away. No one believes for a minute that Pennzoil intends to buy
Chevron,'' said analyst Thomas Escott at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes
Inc., a Dallas investment firm.
   ``There isn't any way Pennzoil's going to come in and take
Chevron over,'' agreed another analyst, George Gaspar of Robert W.
Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee.
   However, Ron Londe with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis said
the purchase nevertheless could be a good move. ``Pennzoil's
notorious for being a very astute investor.''
   San Francisco-based Chevron declined to comment on the
announcement.
   Only Wednesday, Chevron announced a $1 billion sale of 14.1
million shares of common stock to an employee stock owner plan that
could make any takeover more difficult. The stock, about 5 percent
of the company's outstanding shares, was added to 11 percent
already held by an employee profit-sharing plan.
   Chevron, which paid $13.3 billion to buy Gulf Oil four years
ago, has seen its stock climb in recent weeks on rumors of a
possible takeover bid, with Pennzoil mentioned as a likely suitor.
   Last year, Pennzoil received $3 billion in an out-of-court
settlement of its lawsuit against Texaco over Getty Oil Co. in 1984
and observers have been watching closely to see what the company
would do with its windfall.
   Pennzoil had sued Texaco claiming Texaco's 1984 acquisition of
Getty Oil Co. interfered with its plans to buy part of Getty. In
1985 a Houston jury awarded Pennzoil $10.3 billion. Texaco appealed
but eventually settled with Pennzoil for the smaller amount.
   ``Over the past several months, your management and board of
directors have reviewed numerous business situations in an effort
to find an investment opportunity similar to Pennzoil's former
stake in Getty Oil Co.,'' said the letter signed by Pennzoil
Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke and President Randal B. McDonald.
   ``After thorough study, we have concluded that Chevron is by far
the most appealing company in the entire spectrum and particularly
in its peer group.''
   Noting Chevron's profitability has not matched its market
position, Pennzoil said, ``Chevron has demonstrated expertise in
dealing with strictly financial affairs. In the past, it has not
seemed to focus that expertise on its operational divisions. If it
now does so, we believe the results could be pleasantly
surprising.''
   Pennzoil spokesman Robert Harper said the company had until the
end of 1990 to reinvest the money from Texaco to avoid tax
liabilities.
   Pennzoil said it believed it could provide ``constructive
support'' to Chevron Chairman Kenneth T. Derr's plans to improve
the company's performance.
   Chevron, rich in oil and gas reserves and a high-performing
chemicals unit, had sales in 1988 of $28.9 billion, down from $29.1
billion in 1987. Earnings last year totaled $1.8 billion, or $5.17
a share, up about 40 percent from $1.3 billion, or $3.65 a share.
   In its latest quarter, Chevron's earnings edged down to $417
million, or $1.22 a share, from $420 million, or $1.23 a share, a
year earlier.
   Pennzoil, whose main business is in motor oil and sulphur,
reported third quarter income of $35.4 million, or 87 cents per
share, compared to $39.3 million, 93 cents, for the same period a
year ago. Revenue rose to $644 million in the third quarter
compared to $617 million in 1988.

   First Interstate Bancorp, hammered by loan
losses at out-of-state subsidiaries, said Thursday it would speed
up its program to sell bad loans in Texas and add $400 million to
its reserves to cover the costs.
   First Interstate, whose Arizona unit lost $174 million last
quarter and whose Texas subsidiary also has shown big losses in the
past, also said it intended to offer 7.5 million shares of new
common stock to raise about $400 million.
   First Interstate, the nation's largest retail banking system
with offices in 21 states, said the program will cut the costs of
carrying the bad loans. That, combined with existing unused tax
benefits, should provide up to $367 million of potential future tax
benefits, the company said.
   Of the $400 million in added reserves, $300 million was to go
toward the program to eliminate the bad loans in Texas, and another
$100 million ``to address the risk inherent in the company's real
estate portfolio.''
   First Interstate showed a loss of $15.5 million last quarter, or
57 cents per share, after its First Interstate Bank of Arizona took
a $350 million provision for loan losses due to plunging real
estate values in the state.
   It was the first quarterly loss for the big holding company
since the third quarter of 1988, when First Interstate posted a
$214 million loss because of loan losses in Texas banking
operations and restructuring.

<HEAD>Analyst: Government Report Sees `Potential Problems' At Drug Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of Abbott Laboratories stock slipped
Thursday after a brokerage firm said a government report showed one
of the company's drug plants might be ``a little sloppy'' in
adhering to federal standards.
   Abbott stock closed at $67.12{ a share, down $1.25, in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   ``We didn't tell people to sell, we just said here is some
information about something that is going on,'' said Michael
Harshbarger, vice president and senior health care analyst at
Chicago Corp., a brokerage.
   A day earlier, Harshbarger obtained through the Freedom of
Information Act a copy of a 41-page U.S. Food and Drug
Administration report on an Abbott facility in Lake County that
produces drugs given intravenously.
   ``Our consultants pointed out where it looked like standards had
been becoming a little sloppy _ where it looked like there could be
potential problems,'' Harshbarger said.
   He said 56 citations were listed in the report, written after an
FDA inspection July 5 through Nov. 3 at the plant. He said 80
percent of the issues cited were ``nit-picking, minor problems and
20 percent potentially had some serious implications.''
   He declined to be specific.
   Marie Ekvall, consumer affairs officer at the FDA regional
office, said: ``The only thing we can say at this point is it's an
ongoing investigation. This report is observations, and from it the
regulatory people have to determine what type of regulatory action
has to be taken.''
   Harshbarger said the brokerage firm's sales staff was told in a
meeting Thursday morning to advise clients of the report.
   Abbott spokeswoman Cathy Babington said later Thursday that the
report's observations were technical in nature, but she didn't
elaborate.
   ``The bottom line for customers and patients is that the
products are safe and they are effective for what they are intended
to be used for,'' Babington said.
   She said the plant referred to in the report is ``one small
section of one building on an Abbott campus that has many, many
facilities.''

   Canadian subsidiaries of Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. said Thursday they were temporarily closing some
factories because of slumping U.S. vehicle demand.
   The announcements came a day after General Motors Corp.'s
Canadian subsidiary said it would temporarily stop production at
four of its assembly plants.
   Chrysler of Canada Ltd. spokesman Alan McPhee said the company
was closing its Pillette Road full-size van assembly plant in
Windsor, Ontario, for two weeks beginning Jan. 2, affecting about
2,200 hourly workers.
   Ford of Canada Ltd. spokesman Jim Hartford said his company was
closing three engine plants and an iron casting plant in Windsor
for the week of Dec. 18, affecting about 3,000 workers.
   On Wednesday, General Motors of Canada Ltd. said it was closing
two car assembly plants in Oshawa, Ontario, and a van assembly
plant in Scarborough, Ontario, for the week of Jan. 2. It also said
its car plant in Ste. Therese, Quebec, would be closed for two
weeks beginning Jan. 2.
   This month, GM of Canada will temporarily stop production at two
component plants.
   GM's moves affects about 17,700 workers.

   Faced with momentous change by its East
European neighbors, the European Community must accelerate its
drive for closer economic ties, a top official of the trading bloc
said Thursday.
   ``We are facing the shock of necessity,'' said Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, the community's executive
body.
   ``We must maintain the community as a magnet ... as a
stabilizing factor,'' he told reporters on the eve of a summit of
West European leaders in Strasbourg, France. ``This is our historic
duty.''
   Delors appealed to the leaders to move forward with
controversial plans to forge a tighter economic and monetary union
of the dozen nations, known as the Common Market.
   He urged EC leaders, who will meet Friday and Saturday, to set a
date for a special conference to revise the community's founding
treaty and create the monetary union.
   At the summit, the leaders also were expected to discuss plans
to adopt a social charter guaranteeing minimum rights to workers in
the European-wide market to be established in 1992. Also on the
agenda was a French plan to set up a development bank to provide
money to East European countries adopting political and economic
reforms.
   In addition, the leaders may discuss a proposal announced last
month that the EC form a closer relationship with the six European
Free Trade Association countries.
   Under the proposal by the EC's executive commission, the six
EFTA nations _ Austria, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland _ would gain freedom of movement for people, goods,
services and capital with the EC, in effect creating a vast open
European market.
   Nico Wegter, the EC foreign affairs spokesman, said last month
the 12 EC foreign ministers agreed that on Dec. 19, when they meet
their EFTA colleagues, they should take ``a clear political
commitment so that we can begin negotiations next year.''
   Cooperation between the two trade blocs also would be
strengthened in the areas of research, environment, consumer
protection, working conditions, social welfare, education and
foreign policy under the proposal.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, the summit host, wants the
Strasbourg meeting to schedule the inter-governmental conference on
monetary union for the second half of 1990.
   A West German government official said Thursday that Chancellor
Helmut Kohl _ who wants the conference begun after late 1990 German
elections _ would agree to formally launching the conference in
December 1990, providing work did not begin until 1991.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher strongly has opposed
radical plans for monetary union, which would lead to a joint
currency and a European-wide system of central banks. She also has
opposed setting a timetable for the special conference.
   But Mitterrand was expected to push hard for a decision to hold
the conference next fall.
   ``It is on this that the success or failure of the Strasbourg
summit will be judged,'' said a French official in Paris, demanding
anonymity. ``It is a risk, but the situation in Eastern Europe
forces us to take it.''
   Delors and others argue that the upheavals in the East require
the Common Market to move more quickly in uniting on economic and
other issues. U.S. President George Bush has urged the trading bloc
to be ``a magnet that draws the forces of reform forward in Eastern
Europe.''
   But Mrs. Thatcher argues that the sweeping plans for monetary
union would require governments to surrender some of their
sovereignty.
   She reiterated her opposition at Monday's North Atlantic Treaty
Organization summit in Brussels, saying such a system ``is not a
step toward democracy but a step away from it.''
   French officials were worried that West Germany would hesitate
in supporting full European integration. The opening of borders
between East and West Germany, has raised concern that Bonn's
attention may shift to its Eastern neighbors.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France expected West
Germany to show ``irrefutable proof'' of its support for European
integration.
   A West German source, demanding anonymity, said at the NATO
gathering that ``We must make clear in Strasbourg that West Germany
is interested in the further economic and monetary integration of
Europe.''
   Moves for a monetary union have added another dimension to the
European Community's plans to fashion a single market by the end of
1992. By then, the nations want to remove the many trade barriers
that prevent the free movement of people, goods, services and money.
   The special conference would be needed to revise the Treaty of
Rome, which set up the Common Market in 1957. The treaty would have
to be altered to put into effect some of the recommendations for
closer monetary ties, made in a report by a group of central
bankers.
   The report proposed setting up a new agency to make and
implement monetary policy and to manage exchange rate policy. It
also recommended that a single currency eventually be created, with
each nation abandoning its present currency.
   At a June summit in Madrid, the EC leaders agreed to proceed
with the first stage of a three-part plan. The first stage,
scheduled to begin July 1, would link all the EC currencies to the
European monetary mechanism that keeps exchange rates for those
currencies roughly stable within a certain range.
   The currencies of Britain, Greece and Portugal are not now part
of that system.

   The U.S. dollar was up against the Japanese yen
Friday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
declined in morning trading.
   The dollar closed the morning session at 144.23 yen, down from
its opening of 144.32 yen but up 0.12 yen from Thursday's close
here of 144.13 yen. It was traded in a narrow range of 144.21 to
144.40 yen.
   The dollar's higher opening in Tokyo followed a similar
overnight upswing in New York, where it ended at 144.30 yen.
   The mark was dropping back against the dollar after sales of the
German currency by Asian speculators in Sydney, said Minori
Takeuchi, a trader at Chemical Bank.
   Some speculators in Tokyo seemed to be waiting until the dollar
rose more before selling to buy yen, Takeuchi said. Japanese
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto indicated a relative lack of
concern with the dollar's strength above the 144.00 yen level at a
regular press conference Friday morning.
   ``Inside a delicate situation we are taking a delicate look,''
he said. The remark was seen as indicating the ministry is not
alarmed by the dollar's recent rise.
   Most market players were awaiting the release of the U.S.
jobless rate for November due out in Washington later Friday,
traders said.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
103.09 points, or 0.27 percent, closing the morning session at
37,755.02.
   It had gained 203.82 points to a record-high closing of
37,858.11 Thursday.
   A trader at Kleinwort Benson securities said he didn't believe
the market's recent rally, in which it advanced for all but 2 of 22
days, had ended despite the drop.
   ``There are a lot of people still waiting to put money into the
market,'' said the trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>MeraBank To Get $450 Million Capital Infusion from Pinnacle West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEL REISNER</BYLINE>

   Federal regulators have approved a $450 million
capital infusion from Pinnacle West Capital Corp. to its troubled
MeraBank subsidiary, the thrift's chairman said late Wednesday.
   ``This is an important beginning of the recapitalization of
MeraBank. It means about $45 million a year in interest revenue,''
said Chairman Gene Rice.
   However, the chairman of the Arizona Corporation Commission said
the transfer was an ominous sign for Arizona Public Serivce Co.,
the state's largest public utility and Pinnacle West's only
profitable subsidiary for the past two years.
   Pinnacle West, a $13 billion-a-year, Phoenix-based holding
company, was founded to run Arizona Public Service. On Friday,
PacifiCorp, a Portland, Ore. utility holding company, announced it
wanted to buy Pinnacle West in a deal valued at about $1.87 billion.
   The bid, which is conditioned upon Pinnacle West disposing of
MeraBank, is an expansion of an earlier offer from PacifiCorp to
buy Arizona Public Service. Pinnacle West created concern in 1986
when it bought MeraBank just as the problems that have plagued U.S.
savings and loans became most acute.
   The acquisition was criticized because of the possibility that
the S&amp;L could siphon funds from the utility company, a robust
dividend-producer. Pinnacle West has repeatedly denied any shifting
of funds among its subsidiaries.
   ``The settlement announced tonight ... saddles Pinnacle West
with additional debt at a time when the company can ill afford it
and leaves ownership of MeraBank in the hands of Pinnacle West with
no assurance that losses will not continue to mount,'' said Renz
Jennings, chairman of the corporation commission, in a statement.
   He said the regulatory commission was worried about ``the
possibility that Pinnacle West creditors will look to Arizona
Public Service Co. for repayment.''
   ``This commission has moved in the past to prevent the parent
company from draining the resources of APS at the expense of
ratepayers, and (the commission) will do so again without
hesitation or reservation,'' Jennings added.
   Pinnacle West Chairman Keith Turley said the company and the
federal Office of Thrift Supervision office in San Francisco agreed
that Pinnacle West will pay MeraBank $300 million in cash and
accrued interest by March 31, 1990. Pinnacle West also said it will
give the thrift an unsecured note for $150 million.
   Turley did not address the concerns over Arizona Public Service,
Pinnacle West's only company that falls under the direct purview of
state regulators.
   ``We also believe the state of Arizona is well served by this
resolution,'' he said.
   Pinnacle West has obtained a commitment from Chase Manhattan
Bank, Chemical Bank, Citibank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., all of
New York, to lend the $300 million needed to come up with the first
infusion in less than four months, Turley said.
   He said the assumption of additional debt would require Pinnacle
West to renegotiate ``certain existing debt obligations'' for
MeraBank, a subsidiary it has placed on the sales block.
   MeraBank lost $209 million in 1988 and $105 million in the first
six months of this year, with a projected loss of about the same
amount in the last six months.
   ``After a very difficult time over the past 18 months, we
believe this agreement is in the best interest of Pinnacle West
shareholders and will help re-establish the company's position in
the financial community,'' Turley said.
