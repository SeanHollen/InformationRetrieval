<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Declines to Prosecute Senate President on Corruption
Charges</HEAD>

   Boston's top federal prosecutor announced Friday
he would not file criminal charges against Senate President William
Bulger after a 2{-year investigation, but he hinted broadly that
corruption persists in Massachusetts.
   Outgoing U.S. Attorney Jeremiah O'Sullivan, as one of his last
official acts, told a crowded news conference that he had decided
not to indict Bulger or his associate, Boston attorney Thomas
Finnerty, who was accused of extortion in a development project.
   ``There is simply not sufficient evidence to ask a grand jury to
indict either of these two individuals for violation of the federal
extortion statute or the federal tax laws,'' O'Sullivan said.
   After a two-month review of a 2{-year-long federal
investigation, O'Sullivan said the final decision was ``not a close
call'' based on the admissible evidence in the exhaustively
researched case. The review had been ordered by U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh.
   But in reply to reporters' questions, O'Sullivan indicated his
personal belief that the development business is rife with tactics
that are questionable, although not indictable.
   ``Power-brokering is not necessarily a federal crime,'' he said.
At another point, O'Sullivan said the tactics involve
``influence-peddling.''
   The decision by O'Sullivan helps lift a cloud of suspicion from
Bulger, one of the state's most powerful politicians, who was
rocked by allegations made by Boston landlord and developer Harold
Brown in a civil suit.
   In a civil suit filed in Suffolk Superior Court, Brown charged
that Finnerty, a long-time associate and law partner of Bulger,
extorted $500,000 from him by suggesting that he could hamper
governmental approval of an office building development in Boston
unless he was cut in on the deal.
   Brown accused Bulger of benefiting from the pay-off.
   Bulger and Finnerty denounced those allegations, but Bulger has
largely refrained from defending himself in public. An aide said
the Senate president would make no comment on the prosecutor's
decision not to press charges.
   Brown, who pleaded guilty in 1986 to bribing a City Hall
official to expedite another of his projects, was apparently the
government's key witness in the case. O'Sullivan said Brown may
have sincerely believed Finnerty was trying to extort him, but the
prosecutor said the criminal issue was Finnerty's actions _ not
Brown's perceptions.

   An Agriculture Department survey shows that
farmers intend to boost corn plantings this spring, with easier
federal curbs and higher market prices helping them bounce back
from last year's drought.
   The survey, announced on Friday, showed that farmers intend to
plant 73.3 million acres to corn, up 8 percent from last year.
Soybean plantings are expected to rise 5 percent from 1988 to 61.7
million acres.
   Officials said the report was based on an annual U.S. survey of
about 65,000 farmers in early March. Increases from last year were
also indicated for grain sorghum, wheat _ including winter, durum
and other spring varieties _ tobacco, dry edible beans and sweet
potatoes.
   Farmers indicated they would plant fewer acres this year of
oats, hay, cotton, rice and peanuts.
   If farmers follow through with their plans, the corn acreage
would be the most since 76.7 million acres were planted for the
1986 crop. In 1985, plantings reached 83.4 million acres.
   The planted corn acreage dropped to 60.2 million acres in 1983,
another year of severe drought.
   Last year, of the 67.6 million acres planted, 58.1 million were
harvested for grain, yielding 4.92 billion bushels, down 30 percent
from the 1987 crop. Average yields dropped to 84.6 bushels per acre
from a record of 119.4 bushels in 1987.
   There was no indication of 1988 production in the report. Winter
wheat output will be indicated by the USDA for the first time on
May 11 and corn figures in August, along with soybeans, cotton and
other spring-planted crops.
   Total wheat plantings for this year's harvest was indicated at
74.3 million acres, up by more than 13 percent from last year.
Winter wheat was reported at 54.7 million acres, up 12 per cent;
durum, 3.86 million, up 16 percent; and other spring-planted wheat,
15.7 million acres, up 17 percent.
   Officials cautioned that the actual acreage planted by farmers
this spring ``may vary from intentions because of the effects of
weather, availability of production inputs, changes in market
conditions prior to planting'' and the impact of the USDA report
itself.
   With production cut by last year's drought, market prices of
grains and soybeans rose sharply. The USDA also relaxed
acreage-reduction requirements under wheat and feed grains programs
for 1989.
   Preliminary price figures for March showed on Thursday that the
average farm price of wheat was $4.16 per bushel, up from $2.74 a
year ago. Corn was reported at $2.61 against $1.86 in March 1988,
and soybeans were $7.57 per bushel, compared with $6.05 a year
earlier.
   Other crops included in the survey report:
   _Cotton plantings, 11 million acres, down 12 percent from 1988.
   _Sorghum, 11.8 million acres, up 14 percent.
   _Barley, 9.62 million acres, down 1 percent.
   _Oats, 13.2 million acres, down 5 percent.
   _Hay, 63.1 million acres, down 4 percent.
   _Rice, 2.86 million acres, down 2 percent.
   _Peanuts, 1.64 million acres, down 1 percent.
   _Tobacco, 713,000 acres, up 13 percent.
   _Dry edible beans, 1.67 million acres, up 11 percent.
   _Sweet potatoes, 94,000 acres, up 2 percent.

<HEAD>Reagan Won't Testify When North Puts on Defense</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Oliver L. North's
defense that he carried out administration orders by covering up
his work for the Nicaraguan Contras was crippled when a federal
judge refused to compel former President Reagan to testify.
   In denying a request to call Reagan as a defense witness in
North's trial, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said Friday he
couldn't find any evidence that the former president authorized
North's activities.
   ``The trial record presently contains no proof that defendant
North ever received any authorization from President Reagan to
engage in the illegal conduct alleged, either directly or
indirectly, orally or in writing,'' Gesell wrote in a five-page
order.
   ``Nothing there even remotely supports an authorization claim,''
Gesell said.
   Reagan, in Los Angeles where he now lives, said Friday he had
been determined to fight any attempts to force him to testify.
   ``I made up my mind I wasn't going,'' Reagan told KESQ-TV. ``I
think it would have set a precedent that the next president doesn't
have a right to impose on other presidents. No president has ever
been subpoenaed.''
   Reagan would have been the first former president to be
compelled to testify in a criminal proceeding concerning his
conduct while in office had Gesell agreed to make him appear.
   The defense is scheduled to begin presenting its case Monday,
the seventh week of North's trial. Defense attorney Barry Simon
refused to identify the first witness.
   The prosecution had put on 29 witnesses, and on Friday the judge
denied a defense motion to dismiss remaining counts against North.
   The defense argues that North was simply following Reagan's
orders when he lied to Congress in 1985 and 1986 about the National
Security Council's involvement in helping the Nicaraguan Contras.
   North's attorneys had subpoenaed Reagan so they could ask him
what he knew about the NSC's role in raising money for the Contras
at a time Congress had barred U.S. military assistance to the
rebels.
   The 12-count indictment against North accuses him of obstructing
Congress and making false statements in connection with letters he
drafted and a meeting with House intelligence committee members.
   The judge said he reached his decision about Reagan's testimony
after studying the trial record, thousands of pages of classified
and unclassified documents, portions of Reagan's personal diaries
and written answers Reagan provided to the grand jury.
   Gesell said no presidential privilege prevented him from
ordering the former president to testify, but the defense failed to
prove Reagan's testimony was crucial to provide North a fair trial.
   Theodore B. Olson, Reagan's personal attorney, said he was
pleased with the order. Simon declined comment.
   The Justice Department had opposed Reagan's court appearance on
the grounds it could have opened the door for questioning about
sensitive national security matters.
   Gesell acknowledged there is ``understandable public interest''
in what Reagan ``may have known or may have done.'' But he said
North's trial does not involve such a broad inquiry.
   He noted that three conspiracy charges against North involving
presidential matters had been dropped.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in travelers checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

<HEAD>Government Extends AZT Program for Six Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is diverting $5
million from AIDS research, prevention and education programs so
states can continue providing the costly drug AZT to AIDS patients
who cannot afford it.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said the
action Friday, hours before the federal AZT program expired, was in
response to a request from Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and other
senators.
   But Sullivan said that while he agreed with the ``compassionate
purpose'' of the transfer, ``a series of `one-time' appropriations
is not the most desirable way to address the issue of support for
purchase'' of AIDS drugs.
   The funds, which Sullivan said are being diverted from AIDS
research, prevention and education, should continue the program for
six months. The administration says federal support for AIDS
research, prevention and treatment will exceed $2.1 billion this
fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   Nearly 7,000 of the estimated 30,000 AIDS victims using AZT are
receiving the drug under the program, created by Congress in 1987
and extended for six months last September.
   The drug, which has been shown to extend the lives of many AIDS
patients, costs about $8,000 a year when taken at full dosage. It
is currently the only drug approved by the government to treat
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Kennedy, who spearheaded the drive to continue the temporary
grants for state AZT programs, commended Sullivan and the Bush
administration ``for recognizing the urgency of the situation and
moving so quickly to avert a gap in this lifesaving program.''
   Georgia and Kansas had already run out of federal funds
allocated to them under the program and Idaho, Kentucky and Utah
were due to run out Friday, according to the Human Rights Campaign
Fund, an AIDS patient advocacy group.
   Programs in other states _ including Texas and California, which
account for about one-third of all those in the program _ were due
to run out of federal funds by the end of June. Other states have
enough money to last through August.
   Carlton Lee of the Human Rights Campaign Fund said that, ``while
we don't want to see the money come from already existing AIDS
efforts, we believe the financial crisis faced by so many people
with AIDS is urgent enough to warrant such measures.''
   Kennedy had tried to get a bill to extend the program through
September approved in the Senate two weeks ago, before lawmakers
left for the Easter recess, but the measure was blocked in a
parliamentary move.
   In a letter Tuesday, Kennedy, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and 11
other senators called on Sullivan to transfer $5 million in AIDS
funds to the AZT program.
   They said HHS had been authorized by Congress in September to
redirect $15 million to the program, but had provided only $10
million. They said Congress had intended that the entire amount be
redirected.
   When Congress agreed to extend the program last September,
giving final approval only hours before the program was to expire,
the manufacturer of AZT, Burroughs Wellcome Co., agreed to provide
$5 million worth of the drug free.
   Kennedy plans to introduce legislation this year that would
address the issue of care for AIDS patients and ``end the haphazard
Band-Aid approach to provision'' of drugs such as AZT to patients,
a Kennedy aide said.
   Medicaid covers about 40 percent of people with AIDS and
Medicare covers about 3 percent, but many low-income people with
AIDS don't qualify for either program, according to the Human
Rights Campaign Fund. Also, many private health insurance plans
don't cover the drug or don't cover its entire cost, the group said.

   The Federal Communications Commission is being
forced to review its policy of favoring minorities in the sale of
``distressed'' radio and TV stations because a court says the
program is unconstitutional.
   The FCC's 1978 ``distress sale'' rules, which allow quick sales
at reduced rates of defunct or disenfranchised stations to blacks,
Hispanics and other minorities, violate the equal protection
provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, a federal
appeals court said Friday.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in a 2-1
vote, overturned a purchase after a Hartford, Conn., broadcaster
said he should have been able to try to buy a station being offered
in a distress sale.
   The ruling is at odds with Congress, which in December 1987
refused _ with then-President Reagan concurring _ to allow the FCC
to consider changing the policy.
   The FCC had said it wanted to review the policy after the
appeals court in 1986 rejected a sale based on the agency's
``comparative preference'' program of giving special treatment to
women seeking FM station licenses.
   But after Congress acted, the FCC voted 3-0 in February 1988 to
reaffirm the distress sale and female preference policies.
   It was not clear Friday how the commission would react to the
latest remand.
   FCC Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said she strongly
supported minority entry into broadcasting and that the court had
struck down a program mandated by Congress. ``We are now between
the proverbial rock and a hard place,'' she said.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick also said he supported ensuring
minority participation in broadcasting, but also that ``race alone
should not control the licensing of broadcast stations.''
   The Media Access Center, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief
in the case, said the FCC policy had worked well and the court
``made a mistake.''
   Andrew Schwartzman, the center's executive director, said ``we
expect that Congress or the Supreme Court will reinstate the FCC's
policy.''
   The FCC in 1984 denied Alan Shurberg and Shurberg Broadcasting a
chance to compete for the purchase of WHCT-TV in Hartford from the
station's owner.
   The FCC also affirmed that a rival for the Hartford station,
Astroline Communications Company Limited Partnership, was a
minority enterprise and not a sham, as Shurberg contended.
   The appeals court Friday said the FCC policy did not meet
previous Supreme Court tests of minority set-aside programs,
including one that preferences be given to minorities only after
race-neutral efforts to increase minority ownership had failed.
   ``The distress sale policy is not narrowly tailored to remedy
past discrimination ... and it provides no procedures for ensuring
that the policy's beneficiaries have actually suffered from the
effects of past discrimination,'' Judge Laurence H. Silberman said
in the majority opinion.
   Chief Judge Patricia M. Wald dissented, saying the distress sale
policy legally worked to ensure diversity in programming and
ownership and that it was ``narrowly tailored to address the
critical entry barriers to minority participation in media
ownership while imposing only minimal burdens on innocent third
parties.''
   Shurberg, speaking by phone from Hartford, said he was
``delighted'' with the court's ruling.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, on his
first visit to Cuba on Sunday, may seek to defuse conflicts in
Central America and tell Fidel Castro the Kremlin is weary of
financing Cuban adventurism.
   Both Soviet and Western analysts interviewed in Moscow predict
the reformist Soviet leader will be outwardly friendly toward the
doctrinaire Cuban president. But they expect Gorbachev to use the
island as a platform for a major speech signaling his desire for a
peaceful settlement of regional strife.
   President Bush has urged Gorbachev to use his influence with
Nicaragua to further peace efforts.
   ``We would like to see the Soviet Union withdraw their resources
and support in Nicaragua,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Thursday.
   In a speech in Atlanta, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
urged the Soviets to show ``signs of new thinking'' in Central
America. He said the region was ``not a dumping ground'' for arms
and failed ideologies of outsiders.
   Gorbachev's four-day visit to Havana, to be preceded by a brief
stop Sunday in Ireland and followed by a visit to Britain for talks
with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth II, had
been set for December. After addressing the United Nations and
meeting Ronald Reagan and George Bush in New York, however,
Gorbachev broke off his trip and flew home after the devastating
earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   ``We are not going to worsen our relations with Cuba,'' one
Soviet specialist on Latin American affairs said of the visit to
Havana. ``But Gorbachev is a very persuasive man and he will try to
explain his intentions.''
   The expert said Gorbachev will inform Castro that Moscow is no
longer interested in financing class struggle and wars of national
liberation abroad.
   Castro, who just celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Cuban
revolution, has supported armed struggle not only in Latin America
but in Africa as well.
   After years of backing leftist forces in Angola, Cuban troops
recently began a withdrawal from southern Africa as part of a
Soviet-backed negotiated settlement between Cuba, Angola and South
Africa.
   A senior Western analyst, who like the Soviet expert spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Gorbachev also is likely to tell
Castro privately that the Kremlin can't afford to subsidize Cuba's
economy indefinitely.
   ``Castro has been protected from his mistakes by Soviet aid,''
the Western diplomat said, citing U.S. calculations that Soviet
economic assistance account for perhaps 20 percent of Cuba's gross
national product.
   While Gorbachev's program of perestroika seeks to decentralize
the communist-controlled economy, open markets and create financial
incentives for improved production, Castro's ``correction of
errors'' campaign has clamped tighter government controls on
production while shutting down peasants' markets and seeking to
eradicate pay differences among workers.
   Castro's determination to follow communist doctrine in the face
of widespread evidence that his island's economy is in shambles
prompted the Western analyst to observe, ``It's easy to talk about
ideological purity when somebody else is paying for it.''
   U.S. sources say there already have been substantial reductions
in Soviet aid to Cuba as evidenced in the marked decline in the
purchase of sugar, which the Soviet Union buys from Cuba at prices
substantially higher than world market levels as a form of subsidy.
   The Soviet Union has embarked on a major overhaul of its own
ailing economy and has taken steps to extract itself from regional
conflicts that have drained its resources while threatening to blow
up into superpower confrontation.
   Gorbachev announced to the United Nations on Dec. 7 his plan to
pare a half-million men from the Soviet armed forces, withdraw
thousands of tanks and other offensive military units from Eastern
Europe and ease tensions on the Chinese border by drawing down
Soviet forces in Mongolia.
   The Kremlin completed its promised military withdrawal from
Afghanistan on Feb. 15. Three weeks later, it entered talks with
the West in search of a negotiated reduction of all conventional
forces in Europe.
   But Soviet intentions are less clear in Centeral America, where
the Sandinista government in Nicaragua continues to receive
substantial Soviet military aid _ much of it channeled through Cuba
_ and Salvadoran rebels press their civil war with East bloc
weaponry.
   The United States, meanwhile, has backed the Salvadoran
government and Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua.
   Central America, the Western diplomat noted, ``is one of the
last remaining really hot regional conflicts outside the Middle
East in which there's a strong superpower presence.''
   In his address to the United Nations, Gorbachev rejected ``the
use or threat of force'' as an instrument of foreign policy,
calling instead for new world order based on ``universal human
consensus'' and respect for individual differences.
   ``As the world asserts its diversity,'' he said, ``attempts to
look down on others and to teach them one's own brand of democracy
become totally improper to say nothing of the fact that democratic
values intended for export often very quickly lose their worth.''
   Adhering to that policy, Gorbachev is unlikely to lecture Castro
on how to run his own country, but it remains to be seen how much
the Soviet Union is prepared to subsidize Cuba's longstanding
deficit economy.

<HEAD>Long-Distance Rates Going Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Telephone users will be charged less for their
interstate phone calls starting today as a result of rate
reductions by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI
Communications Corp.
   AT&amp;T said Friday its interstate long-distance rates will drop by
$637.5 million annually, for a 1.9 percent overall reduction in its
residential and small business prices. MCI Communications Corp.
said Thursday it would cut its rates by $200 million a year
starting today.
   The cuts represent a pass-along to customers of savings that
result from a Federal Communications Commission order that local
companies cut the charges to the long-distance carriers for
connecting with local phone systems.
   The local companies had proposed a $489 million cut, but the FCC
ordered them last week to cut back by $705 million.
   But the savings also reflect a 30-cent increase in the charge
that customers pay to help maintain the local telephone networks.
That increase is effective today as well.
   And while most long-distance rates will go down under the new
rates, prices for basic long-distance calls under 292 miles will
increase an average of 4.5 percent. That's a change from AT&amp;T's
proposed 4.7 percent price increase in February.
   Also, daytime price cuts will be larger than evening price cuts,
4.2 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively; and night-weekend prices
will drop 0.3 percent.
   Consumer groups had complained in February that AT&amp;T was not
cutting prices significantly in the night and weekend long-distance
time periods used by residential customers, while making big cuts
in the highly competitive daytime arena.
   Under the new AT&amp;T rates:
   _Basic long-distance prices will drop an average 1.9 percent.
   _Rates for AT&amp;T WATS calls will drop an average 3.9 percent.
   _PRO WATS rates will drop an average 3.9 percent.
   _AT&amp;T MEGACOM WATS rates will drop 1.1 percent, and AT&amp;T MEGACOM
800 prices will be 5.2 percent lower.
   _Reach Out America will drop an average 2.6 percent.
   _Basic AT&amp;T 800 service, down 0.9 percent; 800 Readyline
service, down 3.3 percent. Beginning July 1, AT&amp;T 800 service will
be billed according to distance, and there will be additional price
reductions of 1.9 percent for 800 service and 2 percent for 800
Readyline.
   _Software Defined Network Service prices will decline an average
6.1 percent.

   Farmer Richard Panza doesn't understand why
local tax officials won't let him pay back taxes with a little
piggy that has yet to go market.
   Panza said he'll try to pay the debt again Tuesday by offering
his pig, Art, to the city.
   Earlier this week, Panza donned his overalls, placed Art in a
pickup truck and parked it outside the office of District
Magistrate Art Sabulsky.
   ``Them pigs are my net profit,'' he told the magistrate,
insisting it's legal to pay with pork. A Harmar Township ordinance
allows him to pay with his income, which happens to be pigs, he
said.
   Sabulsky ordered Panza to release his personal records so tax
collectors could calculate how much he owes the township and the
area school district.
   ``I've been fighting this for 13 years,'' Panza said. ``First of
all, they're being a pig about all these taxes. You've got to pay
property tax, school tax, township tax, and then they want to tax
your net profit. There's nothing left for you.''
   Sabulsky wouldn't say whether he'll accept the pig as payment.

<HEAD>Philosophers To Debate On The Existence Of Color</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roses are red, violets are blue. ...
   Or are they?
   Philosophers from around the country will gather in Ann Arbor
next week to discuss whether color is only in the eye of the
beholder.
   The eighth annual colloquium in philosophy April 6-7 at the
University of Michigan will include presentations by professors
from Princeton, Syracuse and Nebraska universities, as well as
Michigan.
   ``What's at issue is whether we have color in the world in the
same way that we have shape in the world,'' said Stephen L.
Darwall, the philosophy department chairman at Michigan.
   When it comes to color, philosophers tend to fall into two camps.
   Some argue that colors have an objective existence independent
of our perception of them, Darwall said.
   Others argue that color is an illusion; that an object's
characteristics cause it to reflect light a certain way, making
people believe they are seeing a certain color, he added.
   The question of color is recognized as a primary element in the
debate between philosophers supporting a realistic outlook and

   Jones Brewing Co. has shut the tap on twice
daily beer breaks for its employees.
   ``When you get 20 minutes and drink a couple beers, grab one
here, grab one there, you're less than 100 percent,'' said Gabriel
``Gabby'' Podlucky, who became president when his family bought the
82-year-old brewery in southwestern Pennsylvania from actress
Shirley Jones in June.
   ``It also goes along with what we believe should be responsible
drinking. I could never face the family of one of our workers if
they got hurt because of it,'' Podlucky said.
   Thirty-one of the brewery's 75 employees voted unanimously
earlier this week to discontinue the practice, he said Friday.
   Workers enjoyed scheduled 20-minute breaks in the morning and
afternoon, during which they could visit the brewery's taproom and
drink up to two glasses of Stoney's, Stoney's Lite, Esquire Extra
Dry or Fort Pitt beer. They also were allowed to drink during lunch
and after work.
   ``Essentially they were allowed to drink at any time,'' he said.
   Workers still will be welcome in the taproom after work and to
compensate for the lack of beer breaks they have been offered their
choice of uniforms provided by the company, two free cases of beer
per month or the cash value of the two cases.
   Podlucky said the vote was in response to a consensus that the
practice was no longer appropriate.

   Washington state on Friday became
America's 36th state with a presidential primary, setting up hopes
for a regional set of primaries that would attract candidates to
the Pacific Northwest.
   The Senate voted 38 to 10 for an initiative submitted by the
people after the Legislature had balked for years at the idea of
eliminating the state's much-maligned caucus system of choosing
national convention delegates.
   As drafted, the legislation would enable Washington to join
Oregon, Idaho and Montana on the date Oregon uses, the fourth
Tuesday in May.
   Supporters of the measure said evangelist Pat Robertson's
victory in last spring's caucuses embarrassed the state into
accepting a primary. Washington, usually seen as a moderate,
politically progressive state, carried the nation's largest
Robertson delegation to the national GOP convention in New Orleans
last August.
   The measure already had cleared the House by an even greater
margin. Since Gov. Booth Gardner's signature was not required,
Initiative 99 was delivered directly to the secretary of state
minutes after passage.
   Champagne corks popped at an impromptu celebration staged by
Secretary of State Ralph Munro, a long-term sponsor who exulted,
``It's finally over!''
   The state will have a primary every presidential year, beginning
in 1992.
   Oregon is toying with changes in its primary date, and there's
no definite agreement for a four-state Super Tuesday, but the
Washington legislation gives the secretary of state flexibility to
set a mutually agreeable date.

<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities have released hundreds of
dissidents from confinement, but at least 100 remain in prisons,
labor camps and psychiatric hospitals, Amnesty International
reported.
   The group released its latest Soviet human rights report on
Friday, two days after the World Psychiatry Association's executive
committee voted to readmit a Soviet organization.
   Many psychiatrists in that association were reported opposed to
the decision, which must be approved by its general assembly later
this year. However, Amnesty officials declined comment on that vote.
   The human rights organization said it had asked to speak with
Soviet officials about the cases during the three-day visit of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Britain, which begins Wednesday.
They said they had received no response.
   Amnesty also said in its report that Soviet citizens still could
be prosecuted for exercising free speech or religion.
   ``Although there has been much improvement and discussion of
human rights in the Soviet Union, and the rhetoric of human rights
will no doubt dominate next week's visit, the reality is that there
are still serious human rights concerns there,'' said Marie
Staunton, director of the group's British section.
   She and the coordinator for Soviet affairs, Mick Venables, spoke
to reporters about Amnesty International's most recent briefing
paper on Soviet human rights, dated March 1989.
   It says Amnesty International knows of at least 100 prisoners
known or thought to be dissidents, including 25 in psychiatric
hospitals, but that 300 have been freed since 1987.
   Although some prisoners have been transferred to better
facilities since 1987, those still in labor camps and prisons ``are
kept on monotonous, meager rations with only rudimentary medical
care, and have to meet excessively high work targets, often
involving heavy physical labor,'' the report said.
   Venables added: ``There has been no major improvement in the
condition of prisoners. Cruelty and degrading treatment still
continues.''
   Psychiatric patients are given unnecessary drugs, a treatment
``meted out as a form of intimidation,'' he said.
   Most of the 100 prisoners are people who tried to emigrate
without permission or conscientious objectors to mandatory military
service, Amnesty said. It said others are held for violating laws
that restrict freedom of expression, religion, assembly and
association.
   It welcomed elements of the new Soviet criminal code that
recognize international rights agreements, abolish internal exile
and reduce the number of capital crimes from 18 to six.
   A delegation from Amnesty is currently in the Soviet Union for a
nine-day visit that is scheduled to end Sunday.

   The 1988 presidential campaign of Sen. Bob

corporate contributions that were channeled through individuals.
   Dole, R-Kan., issued a statement Friday saying the FBI had

that he has ordered the filing of a complaint with the Federal
Election Commission.
   The complaint will ask the commission for advice on who should
receive refunds of such contributions to the Dole for President

   ``As part of Dole for President's cooperation with a federal
investigation into matters totally unrelated to my presidential

<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. is
changing some mortgage rules to help some homeowners to get rid of
their private mortgage insurance earlier.
   When a home buyer puts less than 20 percent down on a house, the
agency, known as Freddie Mac, requires the buyer to get mortgage
insurance to guarantee mortgage payments.
   But the insurance fee boosts the monthly payment required until
the homebuyer builds up equity representing 20 percent of the
home's value.
   Previously, Freddie Mac required that a mortgage be held at
least seven years before the insurance could be lifted even if the
value of the home soars and the owner's equity rises above 80
percent.
   Under the change announced Friday, the insurance can be lifted
in two to five years, depending on circumstances and provided that
mortgage payments have been made on time.

<NOTE>HUD Gives City One Week to Clean Up Housing</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has given the District of Columbia one week to improve
its long-troubled public housing program or face the potential loss
of federal home modernization funds.
   ``The D.C. government has purported to be getting a handle on
public housing for nearly a decade,'' wrote HUD field manager
Margaret White in a recent letter sent to city officials. ``But
sadly, the effort expended has been virtually to no avail. ...
Concrete results are significantly overdue.''
   Ms. White's order set a Friday deadline for having the city
speed up its repair schedule for vacant units.
   HUD cannot deny payment of the city's operating subsidy, which
was $28 million last year, because of poor performance. But White
said her office reviews requests from the city to make
recommendations to regional housing officials on whether to award
modernization funds sought by the city.
   White's order sets deadlines for the district to meet several
federal standards used to measure the proficiency of housing
authorities. She cited the District for slow ``turnaround time'' in
filling vacated units, ineffective maintenance, low financial
reserves, excessive vacancies and slow rent collection.

   Civil rights activist Dick Gregory says
blacks have not learned to exercise their economic power to bring

   Gregory, speaking Friday at Miami University, said that if
blacks in the United States constituted a separate nation, ``we
would be the fifth or sixth economic power in the world. We spend
more in the United States than all of Europe.''
   Blacks buy 28 percent of the Cadillacs sold ``and don't have the
nerve to ask for 28 percent of the jobs'' making Cadillacs, he said.
   Gregory also said that although blacks make up the largest block
of Americans without cable television, ``we never demand that the
networks cater to us.''
   His speech was part of a weekend marking the 25th anniversary of
a project that trained workers to go to Mississippi and register
blacks to vote. The training took place at Western College for
Women, now a part of Miami University. Two such workers were among
three people killed in a shooting on which the current movie

<HEAD>Trump Finally Poised to Take Controls of Eastern Shuttle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real estate tycoon Donald Trump is taking
control of strike-torn Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle, and
some union officials say the sale of the rest of the carrier is a
foregone conclusion.
   Trump announced late Friday that he had completed a restructured
deal to buy the three-city shuttle for $365 million, the same price
he agreed to pay in October in a tentative accord with Texas Air
Corp., Eastern's parent. But the final deal gives Trump four more
Boeing 727s for a total of 21.
   Eastern's unions, which have crippled the airline by honoring a
strike by its Machinists union since March 4, have made the
purchase of Eastern a priority in their battle against Texas Air
Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   Some union officials said Friday the shuttle deal and signs that
a group led by former baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth
might still try to buy the rest of Eastern could indicate the
carrier's sale is inevitable.
   The unions long have claimed that Lorenzo _ whom they revile as
a union buster _ has been trying to strip Eastern of its assets and
funnel them to sister company Continental Airlines, a non-union
carrier.
   Before and since Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection March
9, the unions vigorously have opposed any separate auctions of
Eastern assets such as planes, airport gates and landing rights.
   The recent talks could indicate a sale is likely, and that it
would be a single deal for the entire airline, minus the shuttle,
the unions say.
   ``I believe that Eastern vis-a-vis Frank Lorenzo is now in a
sale mode ... that's what we would favor,'' said Skip Stokes, a
spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association.
   A used 727 fetches $4.5 million to $6 million, indicating Trump
was getting $18 million to $24 million more in assets for the same
price.
   ``I am delighted to complete this transaction and very much look
forward to building an airline that provides superior service for
all consumers,'' Trump said Friday.
   The agreement still must be approved by the federal bankruptcy
court in New York, where Eastern is reorganizing under protection
from creditors. The Trump Organization said it hoped to close the
deal within 60 days.
   ``This agreement proves that the value of Eastern's assets
remains high and continues to be attractive to various parties,''
Eastern President Phil Bakes said.
   The pilots' union, which has been highly critical of Lorenzo,
also expressed approval of the deal.
   ``The money that Mr. Lorenzo gets for the shuttle has to come
here, to Eastern Airlines ... That's a positive,'' said Stokes.
   Before the strike, the shuttle serving New York, Boston and
Washington was Eastern's only profitable operation.
   Trump had agreed to pay $365 million for the Eastern shuttle in
October in a tentative accord with Texas Air. But last week he
sought to cut the price by a third because the continuing strike by
Eastern's machinists, supported by its pilots and flight
attendants, had eroded the shuttle's value as Eastern passengers
started switching to the rival Pan Am shuttle.
   Texas Air countered by telling Trump it would look for other
buyers, and America West Airlines, an aggressive Phoenix-based
regional carrier, expressed interest.
   Trump said he still planned to recognize the Eastern unions as
bargaining representatives for Trump Shuttle employees, as in his
October accord, and to negotiate separate labor agreements with the
shuttle workers.
   ``We have absolutely great relations with all three unions,'' he
said.

   Buoyed by support from key Arab leaders,
President Hosni Mubarak leaves for Washington today to tell U.S.
officials they must move quickly to persuade Israel to talk to the
PLO, Egyptian officials said.
   The four-day U.S. visit, Mubarak's seventh since taking office
in 1981, follows six weeks of intensive diplomatic exchanges
initiated by the Egyptian leader. The activity brought leaders from
the Soviet Union, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Palestine
Liberation Organization to Egypt.
   Mubarak will meet with President Bush on Monday.
   ``Mubarak is carrying to the United States for the first time a
unified Arab position for the achievement of Arab-Israeli peace,''
said a senior government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``This gives Egypt greater credibility.''
   The unified position was forged in Mubarak's Egyptian talks
during the past week with Jordan's King Hussein, PLO leader Yasser
Arafat and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
   The official said Mubarak will argue a need for speedy movement
by the United States to persuade Israel to accept an international
peace conference and negotiations with the PLO.
   Israel fears it would be pressured into concessions as a result
of such a conference, and it rejects Arafat's group as terrorists.
   The conference, under U.N. auspices, would group parties to the
conflict, including the PLO, and the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council: the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China.
   The Egyptian official also said Mubarak and his Arab backers
would like to see Bush use his influence with Israel to convene an
international conference before the end of this year.
   U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner, in prepared remarks for the local
media on Mubarak's visit, dampened hopes for quick breakthrough as
a result of U.S. efforts.
   ``It will not be easy to arrive at quick results,'' the U.S.
diplomat said. ``What we should do is build confidence to bring the
parties to the negotiating table.''
   He seemed to be referring to a desire by Washington for
reciprocal moves by Israel and the PLO to stop violence in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Stip. A Palestinian uprising in
those territories has killed more than 415 Palestinians and 18
Israelis since it began in December 1987.
   Mubarak's Washington talks also will deal with U.S. economic and
military aid to Egypt and ways of easing Cairo's foreign debt
burden.
   The United States has held up $230 million in cash aid for Egypt
in 1988 and 1989, saying Egypt failed to adopt ``significant''
economic reforms.
   Mubarak says he agrees on the need for economic reforms but
disagrees with the United States on the pace of such steps. He
fears austerity measures might trigger street violence.
   Egypt's foreign debt totals about $44 billion.

   The bodies of four young men were found
stuffed in the a parked car in what police said was the city's
worst murder case in 13 years.
   Police called by an apartment building resident discovered one
body Friday in the car's back seat with its sneaker-clad feet
sticking out of the rear window, said Cpl. Robert Haynes, a police
spokesman.
   A second body was found underneath the first victim, and two
other corpses were found in the trunk of the silver Volvo with
Delaware license plates, Haynes said. The car was left in the
building's parking lot, he said.
   The victims were black and in their late teens or early 20s, he
said. They had yet to be identified, and police did not have
suspects.
   ``There were signs of violence, blood,'' Haynes said.
   A witness who asked not to be identified said stuffed teddy
bears were piled around one victim in the back seat.
   Police said violent crime is unusual in the Norview East
neighborhood with frame cottages and ranch homes, but the parking
lot is within blocks of the low-income Lakeland Apartments, a
frequent destination for police.
   Haynes said the crime was the city's worst mass murder since May
1976, when a 21-year-old man walked into a crowded downtown
nightspot and opened fire, killing four people and wounding three
before killing himself.

   A dentist has been sentenced to 30
months' probation for forgery in a bizarre case involving a dead
man whose mummified remains were tended by his family for nine
years.
   Knox County Judge Daniel Roberts opted for probation for Richard
Kunce, 57, who lived for two years with the family of the dead man,
Carl Stevens. State's Attorney Ray Kimbell had recommended a
three-year prison term.
   Kunce, who has lost his license to practice dentistry, was
convicted recently of witnessing a forgery of Stevens' signature,
which was placed on a document by the widow, Carole Stevens.
   The judge noted at Thursday's hearing that Mrs. Stevens was
sentenced to 24 months of probation after she pleaded guilty to two
counts of forgery in the case last year.
   During the hearing, both sides recalled how Carl Stevens' body
was tended by his family and Kunce as if he were still alive.
   Stevens, a diabetic, died in 1979 after joining a holistic
health cult and halting his daily insulin injections. In January
1988, authorities discovered his body in the Stevens home.
   Kunce lived at the home from summer 1986 until the body was
discovered.
   Kimbell argued that Kunce should be given a stiff sentence
because he harmed Mrs. Stevens' two teen-age children by promoting
the ``strange idea'' that Stevens was alive as his mummified corpse
remained in the home.
   Kunce said he signed as a witness to the 1984 document that gave
Mrs. Stevens her husband's power of attorney because she wanted to
refinance her home.
   Kunce said his immediate plans are to return to Corpus Christi,
Texas, to live with his sister, and perhaps teach nutrition or
practice dentistry if he can renew his license.
   ``I've got to get on with my life,'' he said. ``I think I'll
start by going fishing.''

   Thieves stole antiques worth more than $1.7
million from Sulgrave Manor, the English ancestral home of George
Washington, police said.
   Lawrence Washington, who lived seven generations before the
first U.S. president, bought the property in Sulgrave village, 70
miles northwest of London, in 1539. Its manor house is now run as a
museum and contains much memorabilia from early U.S. history.
   The stolen items include a spoon, a chandelier, three clocks of
the 17th and 18th centuries, and a rare Breeches Bible, police said
Friday. The bible is named after a 1560 edition that called the
fig-leaf coverings made by Adam and Eve ``breeches.''
   Detective Inspector Robin Green said burglars took the antiques,
which he called ``irreplaceable,'' after breaking into the Tudor
manor house through a second-floor window.
   He gave no day on which the burglary occurred. But Robert
Walpole, who runs the Thatched House Hotel opposite the manor, said
he believes it happened Thursday night.
   The Sulgrave Manor house was completed in 1558, the year Queen
Elizabeth I came to the English throne. Descendants of the
Washington family lived there for 120 years.
   George Washington's great-grandfather, John Washington, left
Sulgrave in 1657 and settled in Virginia.
   The museum is owned by an Anglo-American trust. It has been open
to the public since 1921, when it was established as a goodwill
gesture between Britain and the United States.

<TEXT>
   It wasn't exactly a country outing, but 57 Girl
Scouts went on a camping trip very few people will ever top.
   They camped out Friday night on the 86th floor of the Empire
State Building and even got a late night visit from movie monster
King Kong, known for his climb up the landmark edifice when it was
still the world's tallest.
   Although a cloudy evening obscured usually spectacular nighttime
views of Manhattan, the girls didn't seem to mind as they played
games, sang songs, pledged allegiance to the flag and recited the
Girl Scout promise.
   And the girls, mostly from the city's boroughs of Queens and
Brooklyn, were oblivious to the rainy, busy streets 1,050 feet
below as they arranged sleeping bags and blankets for the night.
   Some people are bothered by ants and other bugs on camping
excursions, but 9-year-old Lenata Bristow was unconcerned by the
insectlike things she saw.
   ``I looked down and everything looked like bugs,'' she said as
she looked out of an 80th-floor window before the girls went up to
the 86th-floor observatory.
   Stephine Knight, 9, presented an urban perspective on the merits
of sleeping high up in the 102-story building that would be lost on
people whose idea of camping out is a bit more down to earth.
   ``Out in the country when we went one time, we could get lost,''
she said. ``It's nice here and it's a big place. It's exciting.''
   The idea to camp out high in the Empire State Building was the
Rev. Frank Rafter's. He's been the unofficial chaplain of the
Empire State Building since the mid-1960s. The building opened in
1931.
   The nearest campgrounds for Girl Scouts, he said, are in New
Jersey and the city's Staten Island borough; so he approached the
building's officials. They agreed to an annual November trip for
Boy Scouts and a yearly March outing for the Girl Scouts.
   ``The idea is for the girls from different troops to make new
friends and learn that whether they're black, white, green, blue or
whatever, they're all Americans,'' Rafter said.
   The ``hike'' to the campsite consisted of a leisurely stroll
around the lobby as Rafter led a tour of the first floor.
   But getting to the top of the campsite could be daunting,
9-year-old Shunte Jones pointed out.
   ``In the elevator, it felt like my stomach was dropping and my
ears stopped up,'' she said.
   For those who might think the girls are being deprived of a true
camping experience, troop leader Kathy Waszak was quick to point
out the girls often camp outdoors in more sylvan settings.
   Waszak recalled how a freak snowstorm nearly buried the girls in
their sleeping bags in Brewster, N.Y., in October 1987. She looked
around the enclosed area on the 86th floor where the girls would
sleep Friday and said: ``This is quite milder with no chance of
being snowed in.''
   But not everyone was ecstatic about spending the night at the
building.
   Alice Crowley, 9, would have preferred a more natural
environment.
   ``I'd rather be camping out in the countryside,'' she said. ``I
think that would be more fun.''

<HEAD>Mexico Plans Major Anti-Drug Operation Along U.S. Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican officials today plan to launch one of
the largest crackdowns ever on drug trafficking along the
2,000-mile border from California to Texas.
   Felipe Flores, spokesman for the federal Attorney General's
Office, said the United States and Mexico will share intelligence
information and Mexico will deploy army troops, police
reinforcements and extra drug agents for the project.
   The operation will run from Tijuana, south of San Diego, all the
way to Matamoros, south of Brownsville, Texas, Flores told The
Associated Press in an interview Friday.
   ``It is possibly the largest of its kind. There are more arms,
more vehicles, more personnel,'' he said.
   He gave few specifics. However, Deputy Attorney General Javier
Coello Trejo, who heads Mexico's anti-drug efforts, recently said a
special narcotics interdiction group of 1,200 people would be ready
by April.
   La Jornada, a Mexico City newspaper, said at least a dozen
federal helicopters and 30 airplanes have been sent to Hermosillo,
the capital of Sonora state, for the project.
   The U.S. Embassy referred questions about U.S. participation to
the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington, where officials
were not available for comment.
   Flores said the new program will be permanent. He said it is
styled after Operation Alliance, a U.S.-Mexico effort begun in
August 1986.
   Operation Alliance involved hundreds of U.S. federal agents and
millions of dollars worth of surveillance equipment to detect
drug-ferrying airplane flights across the border.
   Edwin Meese III, who was the U.S. attorney general at that time,
called Operation Alliance ``the most widespread interdiction
program on our land borders in law enforcement history.''
   The new campaign ``is similar, but much bigger,'' Flores said.
   U.S.-Mexican relations have been strained by the flow of drugs
to the United States. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took
office Dec. 1, promised to increase manpower and other resources to
combat the drug trade.
   Drug trafficking and related violence along the Mexico-U.S.
border have increased as the United States pressed its anti-drug
efforts in Florida and the Caribbean.
   Mexican authorities believe the torture-killings of nine people
this week in a town across the border from Douglas, Ariz., were
drug-related.
   The mutilated bodies of two men and three women were found in a
well, and four other bodies were found in a nearby septic tank on
an abandoned ranch two miles west of Agua Prieta.
   Rodolfo Lopez Amaviezca, chief of the state police in Agua
Prieta, said seven people were under arrest, including a Mexican
federal customs agent.
   Agua Prieta has emerged as a major drug channel the past two
years. Some police call it ``cocaine alley.''
   El Imparcial, a newspaper in Sonora's capital of Hermosillo,
reported two suspects in the killings told police the victims were
slain in retaliation for the disappearance of 220 pounds of drugs.
Mexico City newspapers said the drug was cocaine.

   Tito Dupaya, a member of the
Philippine House of Representatives and ally of President Corazon
Aquino, died today of heart attack in his northern home province of
Cagayan, authorities said. He was 67.
   Dupaya was en route to the Cagayan airport to meet Justice
Secretary Sedfey Ordonez when he complained of chest pains, said
Thelma Maceda, House spokesperson.
   He was rushed to the Cagayan hospital where he died of heart
attack at 8:30 a.m., Maceda added. Cagayan is about 210 miles
northeast of Manila.
   Dupaya is a member of the Struggle of the Democratic Filipino
party, the main political group supporting President Aquino.
   He served for two terms under former President Ferdinand Marcos'
administration. Marcos fled to Hawaii where he is in exile in 1986.
   Dupaya is survived by his wife Teresa, a former Cagayan
governor, and two sons and three daughters.

   The memoirs of former Soviet leader Nikita

being excerpted for the first time in the Soviet press.
   The weekly newspaper Argumenti i Fakti, or Arguments and Facts,
began publishing the excerpts Friday. The article quoted Khrushchev
as saying his predecessor Josef Stalin ``does not trust anybody,
including himself.''
   Khrushchev exposed Stalin's crimes to the Communist Party
leadership in a ``secret speech'' in 1956 that still has not been
published in the Soviet Union.
   After he was removed from power in October 1964, Khrushchev
lived in obscurity outside Moscow until his death in 1971.

<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers from five
Central American countries broke off two days of talks after they
were unable to agree on how to disband the army of U.S.-backed
Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras.
   However, the ministers said they will meet again in Guatemala on
April 13-14 to continue their negotiations.
   Nicaragua has pushed for quick disbanding of the rebels, most of
whom live in border camps in neighboring Honduras.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Rivera of Costa Rica told
reporters that the diplomats could not ``arrive at an accord for
demobilization of the Contras.''
   The Central American presidents agreed Feb. 14 to come up with a
plan by mid-May for disarming the rebels. They would either be
repatriated with their families or relocated. In exchange,
Nicaragua said it would adopt domestic democratic reforms.
   The agreement took U.S. officials by surprise. They have said
the rebels should remain in place as an army to put pressure on the
leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua to make reforms.
   The foreign ministers disagreed. ``It is the collective
responsibility of the five governments to look for paths to obtain
the demobilization,'' Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez
Contreras told a news conference after talks ended. Honduras has
been a strong U.S. ally, but it has recently objected publicly to
the presence of the rebels, known as Contras, on its territory.
   However, the foreign minister said his government did not have a
specific plan for demobilization. ``What we have are ideas,
reflections,'' he said.
   The foreign ministers of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras,
Guatemala and Costa Rica met in San Jose to lay groundwork for a
regional summit at which their presidents are to decide how to
disband the Contras.
   Lopez Contreras said earlier Friday that the summit would be put
off from May 15 to June 15 to allow El Salvador's new president,
Alfredo Cristiani, to take office.
   At the San Jose meetings, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel
D'Escoto also gave his colleagues a proposal for a regional fight
against drug trafficking that would include U.S. assistance. The
foreign ministers said they will try to meet in Nicaragua April
11-12 to discuss the proposal.
   They also agreed to meet in Guatemala in early May to prpare for
the presidential summit. The exact dates of the second Guatemala
meeting are to be decided later.
   Although no accords were reached, the foreign ministers said the
talks were fruitful.
   ``If we didn't believe peace in Central America was possible, we
wouldn't be fighting for it,'' Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rodrigo
Madrigal Nieto said.
   The Contras fought the Nicaraguan government for eight years.
However, the fighting has trailed off since early last year, when
the U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the rebels.
   President Daniel Ortega said Thursday that $45 million in
non-military aid under consideration by the U.S. Congress should be
used to disband the Contras.
   As now envisioned, the package would provide the Contras with
$4.5 million a month through Feb. 28, 1990, four days after what
Nicaragua pledged will be free and democratic general elections.
   Nicaragua says Washington would be violating regional peace
accords by maintaining the Contras as a potential fighting force.
The Contras and their families in Honduras number 10,000 to 11,000.
   The ministers on Thursday formally approved deploying a small
group of unarmed U.N. military observers to monitor Central
American border conflicts.
   Canada, Spain and West Germany agreed to contribute to the
force. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias said he asked Venezuela to
send observers also.
   The United Nations has made no decision on such a force.

<TEXT>
   Members of the Sikh minority gathered
today to pray for 22 people who were killed when rebel rockets hit
a Sikh Temple in the besieged city of Jalalabad.
   Sikhs who were brought by government helicopter to Kabul said 21
Sikhs and one Hindu were killed Thursday when rockets landed in and
around the Sikh Gurdwara, or Temple. The names of the six men and
16 women and children who died were read out by a Sikh elder after
the service.
   The dead were part 65 people who were killed Thursday and Friday
when U.S.-backed Islamic rebels fired rockets and artillery shells
into Jalalabad, a strategic city near the Khyber Pass and on the
main highway leading to Kabul from the Pakistani border.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas chose Jalalabad as their first major
objective, following the final withdrawal of Soviet troops on Feb.
15, toward toppling the capital of Kabul and establishing a Moslem
republic. Pakistan also backs the rebels.
   Many observers believe if the rebels take Jalalabad, it could
break the morale of government troops and lead to the collapse of
Kabul.
   The death toll the last two days has been the highest reported
by the government since Soviet forces ended nine years of
involvement in the Afghan war. Soviet troops at one time numbered
115,000 in Afghanistan.
   Gurmit Singh, one of a score of Sikhs who were brought to Kabul
to see President Najib, told reporters hundreds of Sikhs and Hindus
had taken shelter in the Gurdwara. ``Our Gurdwara was hit by
rockets between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. Thursday,'' Singh said.
   Singh and others who arrived from Jalalabad said 25 to 30 people
were injured by the rockets.
   They also said nearly everyone in Jalalabad was staying indoors
around the clock as the battle between government forces and Moslem
guerrillas continues.

   United Artists, maker of the
Oscar-winning movie ``Rain Man,'' will be sold to an Australian
entertainment company for $1 billion in the first sale of a major
studio to a foreign buyer.
   In another development, officials of Japan's giant Sony Corp.
were reportedly in discussions Friday with executives of MCA about
acquiring the giant entertainment conglomerate that owns Universal
Studios.
   United Artists is part of the entertainment complex controlled
by financier Kirk Kerkorian, the majority shareholder of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer@United Artists.
   Under the proposal announced Friday, Kerkorian would retain
control of the MGM name, its roaring lion logo, and TV and movie
studios, as well as 34 MGM movies, including ``Moonstruck'' and ``A
Fish Called Wanda.'' But the United Artists moviemaking group and
its film library would go to the Australia-based Qintex Group, one
of the makers of the recent CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove.''
   The MGM-UA deal, if approved, would mark the first time a major
studio passed into predominantly foreign ownership. Australian
media magnate Rupert Murdoch became a U.S. citizen before he bought
20th Century Fox.
   The MGM-UA deal would give Qintex Group most of the assets of
MGM-UA Communications Co., including rights to ``Rain Man.''
   Also included would be a library of 4,000 movies, among them the
James Bond and Pink Panther series, the video library and movie and
television production and distribution facilities.
   The agreement is subject to unspecified government, shareholder
and third-party approvals, according to a joint announcement by the
two companies.
   MGM-UA officials refused to elaborate on a news release, which
said the deal was expected to be completed by late summer.
   It is the second time this year Kerkorian has agreed to sell
part of the company he assembled out of the former United Artists
and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. In addition to a collapsed deal to
sell an interest in the MGM name to fellow Hollywood investor Burt
Sugarman in July, Kerkorian has been publicly shopping all or part
of MGM-UA for months.
   Kerkorian, who owns 82 percent of MGM-UA through his Tracinda
Corp., pumped $180 million of his own funds into the money losing
company in January. MGM-UA lost $39.5 million in the first quarter
of 1989 and $48.7 million in 1988.
   In Australia, Qintex's $2.5 billion in assets include the
Australian Television Network and Mirage Resorts, which has
operations in Hawaii.
   In the Sony-MCA deal, radio station KNX reported that executives
of the two giant firms met in Los Angeles to put finishing touches
on a deal in which the Japanese electronics firm would acquire MCA.
The radio station said the outcome of the deal would be announced
Monday.
   An employee in the office of MCA President Sidney Sheinberg
declined to comment on the reported talks and pending deal.
   Efforts to obtain comment from directors of MCA in phone calls
made after business hours were unsuccessful.

<HEAD>New Fusion Experiment Gives Hope, But Far From Proven, Scientist
Cautions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist who reported that a simple apparatus
may create fusion power at room temperature said his work gives
hope for a new energy source, but warned that ``fusion fever''
enthusiasm is premature.
   ``I think we have a new approach to fusion,'' but it is too
early to say whether it will prove useful for generating
electricity, said Steven Jones of Brigham Young University in
Provo, Utah.
   The results still must withstand scientific scrutiny and be
confirmed by other scientists, and until that happens, ``don't sell
your oil well,'' Jones said.
   Even if the results hold up, it would take many years before the
process could be put to practical use, Jones said Friday at a
physics colloquium and a later press conference at Columbia
University in New York.
   Fusion is the process that powers the sun and stars, where
tremendous amounts of energy are released when the nucleus, or
core, of one hydrogen atom fuses with the nucleus of another
hydrogen atom.
   In contrast, today's nuclear power plants get energy from
fission, which is the splitting of atoms.
   Scientists hope to harness fusion power, saying it provides an
environmentally benign energy source with a virtually unlimited
source of fuel: ``heavy'' hydrogen, which occurs naturally in water.
   Standard fusion experiments use extremely high temperatures to
get the hydrogen atoms to fuse. But Jones and scientists at the
University of Utah announced recently that they had independently
found a simple way to produce fusion reactions at room temperature.
   Essentially, they used electrical current to herd hydrogen atoms
into metal electrodes, where the hydrogen atoms apparently fused.
   The University of Utah researchers said their apparatus produced
four times as much energy as it consumed. Jones, in contrast, said
the Brigham Young device appeared to produce only about one
ten-trillionth of the energy put into it.
   Jones said he had not read the other team's scientific paper and
could not explain the difference.
   The Brigham Young apparatus included a pair of electrodes
immersed in ``heavy water,'' in which hydrogen atoms contain an
extra particle called a neutron in the nucleus. This kind of
hydrogen is called deuterium.
   When low voltage was applied to the electrodes, deuterium nuclei
were drawn into one of the electrodes. There, they apparently
crowded together closely enough to fuse, Jones said.
   Researchers calculated that two fusions occurred every five
seconds, which would yield an energy output of one ten-trillionth
of a watt. One watt is about enough to run an electric toothbrush.
   The evidence for fusion was that the apparatus emitted neutrons,
Jones said. That happened when the nuclei were driven into
electrodes made from either titanium or palladium, with titanium
giving the better results, Jones said.
   ``We don't really have a good theory'' to explain the fusion,
Jones said. Perhaps deuterium nuclei are forced close enough to
fuse while hopping from site to site within the crystal structure
of the electrode, he said.
   He calls the fusion approach piezonuclear fusion, because
``piezo'' means ``to squeeze.''
   A similar process may cause part of the heat at the Earth's
core, he said.
   In Salt Lake City, one of two researchers who first announced
the discovery, B. Stanley Pons, said Friday he had found no
chemical explanation for the process by which he achieved
sustained, controlled nuclear fusion in a simple experiment.
   ``It cannot be explained by any known chemical process,'' said
Pons, a professor at the University of Utah. ``I can conceive of no
other process other than a nuclear process'' to explain the results.

   About 6,500 Savannah River Plant workers got
$80 million in severance and vacation pay as operator Du Pont
handed over operation of the nuclear weapons plant to Westinghouse
Electric today.
   E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which built the plant near the
Georgia border and managed it for the government for 38 years,
announced last October it was not renewing its contract with the
Department of Energy amid continuing reports of safety problems at
the Aiken plant and others around the nation, including those in
Rocky Flats, Colo., and Fernald, Ohio.
   Du Pont issued the checks Thursday and Friday, even though most
employees will stay on. About 1,200 workers decided to retire.
   Many of the severance and vacation checks ranged from $20,000 to
$30,000, said Scott Murphy of the plant credit union.
   ``I'm crying all the way to the bank,'' joked 22-year Du Pont
employee Henry H. Franks, who said he was going to use his
$10,000-plus check to buy a new tractor.
   ``It's like Christmas has come at the end of March,'' June
Murff, president of the Greater Aiken Chamber of Commerce, said
Friday.
   The Savannah River Plant is the nation's only manufacturer of
tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to make nuclear
weapons at other government defense plants. Its three reactors have
been idled for nearly a year because of safety and structural
problems.
   Under the new arrangement, Westinghouse will be paid by the
government for managing the plant.

<HEAD>Disney and Academy Huddle Over Snow White Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. and the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences are trying to amicably resolve a dispute
over a Snow White lookalike's appearance in the Oscar show's
opening number.
   The two met Friday, but there was no indication Disney was ready
to drop its federal trademark infringement lawsuit against the
academy.
   ``We are in talks with Disney and we won't have any comment
until they are completed,'' said academy spokesman Bruce Davis.
   Fiercely protective of its image and copyrights, Disney filed
the lawsuit in U.S. District Court on Thursday, alleging that Oscar
producers did not have permission to use the Disney-copyrighted
fairy tale character.
   The broadcast, seen in an estimated 27 million American homes,
began Wednesday night with actress Eileen Bowman, dressed as Snow
White, following a chorus line of dancing stars into the Shrine
Auditorium.
   In a squeaky Betty Boop voice, Bowman then launched into a
rendition of ``We Only Have Stars for You,'' to the tune of ``I
Only Have Eyes for You.'' She also sang a rendition of ``Proud
Mary'' with actor Rob Lowe.
   Disney spokesman Erwin Okun said the performance was
unflattering to the beloved character, and Disney President Frank
Wells said the matter could have been settled without litigation if
the academy had publicly apologized.
   ``For its own reasons, however, the academy unfortunately did
not accede to our request,'' Wells said.
   The Oscar show's producer, Allan Carr, declined to comment
because of the pending lawsuit.
   All media queries were referred to Davis, who said it was
strange that the use of the character had not been cleared with
Disney.
   ``Obtaining rights is one of the things we do routinely,'' Davis
said. ``Every little three seconds of music, or a film clip, has to
get cleared. Yes, it is very puzzling. We are exploring the reasons
for that.''
   ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' was released by Disney in
1937 and was the studio's first feature-length animated cartoon.
Critics praised the film, calling it a turning point in Disney's

   As the nation's worst oil spill spreads
into the Gulf of Alaska, wildlife officials said they feared the
number of oil-slicked birds and sea animals would overwhelm a local
recovery center.
   The 240,000 barrels of oil that spewed into Prince William Sound
a week ago from the Exxon Valdez has now tainted more than 1,000
square miles of water. Norwegian environmental specialists were en
route to advise cleanup crews.
   In Washington, the FBI said Friday it is looking at possible
felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the
``negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable waters.'' The
state is also investigating.
   Exxon fired the ship's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, on Thursday,
the same day the National Transportation Safety Board revealed
blood and urine tests taken about nine hours after the accident
showed he had been drinking.

   President Bush says he would have gotten
nowhere with Congress had he tried to win new military aid for the
Contras, and he denies his diplomatic approach to Nicaragua means
the military efforts had failed.
   ``There was no way, not a snowball's chance in hell, of getting
a dime for lethal aid, military aid, from Congress,'' Bush said
Friday in a question-and-answer session with a group of regional
media representatives. ``And I think anybody who's familiar with
Congress would acknowledge that.''
   Bush today was actively engaging in Central American diplomacy,
meeting with Venezuela's new president, Carlos Andres Perez and
several top administration officials.
   The group, including Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, was to discuss a range of issues
of concern to the Latin world, including the Third World debt
crisis and the Central America peace efforts.

   The foreign ministers from five
Central American countries broke off two days of talks after they
were unable to agree on how to disband the army of U.S.-backed
Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras.
   However, the ministers said they will meet again in Guatemala on
April 13-14 to continue their negotiations.
   Nicaragua has pushed for quick disbanding of the rebels, most of
whom live in border camps in neighboring Honduras.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Rivera of Costa Rica told
reporters that the diplomats could not ``arrive at an accord for
demobilization of the Contras.''

   Former White House aide Oliver L. North's
defense that he carried out administration orders by covering up
his work for the Nicaraguan Contras was crippled when a federal
judge refused to compel former President Reagan to testify.
   In denying a request to call Reagan as a defense witness in
North's trial, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said Friday he
couldn't find any evidence that the former president authorized
North's activities.
   ``The trial record presently contains no proof that defendant
North ever received any authorization from President Reagan to
engage in the illegal conduct alleged, either directly or
indirectly, orally or in writing,'' Gesell wrote in a five-page
order.
   ``Nothing there even remotely supports an authorization claim,''
Gesell said.

   Real estate tycoon Donald Trump is taking
control of strike-torn Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle, and
some union officials say the sale of the rest of the carrier is a
foregone conclusion.
   Trump announced late Friday that he had completed a restructured
deal to buy the three-city shuttle for $365 million, the same price
he agreed to pay in October in a tentative accord with Texas Air
Corp., Eastern's parent. But the final deal gives Trump four more
Boeing 727s for a total of 21.
   Eastern's unions, which have crippled the airline by honoring a
strike by its Machinists union since March 4, have made the
purchase of Eastern a priority in their battle against Texas Air
Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   Some union officials said Friday the shuttle deal and signs that
a group led by former baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth
might still try to buy the rest of Eastern could indicate the
carrier's sale is inevitable.

   The Bush administration is diverting $5
million from AIDS research, prevention and education programs so
states can continue providing the costly drug AZT to AIDS patients
who cannot afford it.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said the
action Friday, hours before the federal AZT program expired, was in
response to a request from Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and other
senators.
   But Sullivan said that while he agreed with the ``compassionate
purpose'' of the transfer, ``a series of `one-time' appropriations
is not the most desirable way to address the issue of support for
purchase'' of AIDS drugs.
   The funds, which Sullivan said are being diverted from AIDS
research, prevention and education, should continue the program for
six months. The administration says federal support for AIDS
research, prevention and treatment will exceed $2.1 billion this
fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.

   Christian and Syrian gunners dueled with
howitzers and rocket launchers around Beirut today despite a United
Nations plea for a cease-fire in the 25-day confrontation. Police
said nine people were wounded.
   The latest casualties brought the overall toll to 129 people
killed and 418 wounded in the clashes between Gen. Michel Aoun's
predominantly Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian troops
and militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party.
   Police said two people were killed and six wounded in a six-hour
clash in the southern port of Sidon between the dominant Sunni
Moslem militia of Mustafa Saad and a splinter faction.
   A police spokesman said the leader of the breakaway faction,
Mohammed Hankir, ``surrendered to Saad's militia at 8 a.m. ... Life
is normal in Sidon.''
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules, said
Syrian army gunners pounded the Christian heartland northeast of
Beirut with shells and rockets before dawn.
   He said gunners of Aoun's 20,000-strong Christian army responded
to Syrian fire coming from Moslem west Beirut, the Druse central
mountains and Chouf mountains southeast of the capital as well as
the Bekaa valley in east Lebanon.
   Several 155mm U.S.-designed howitzer shells, fired by Aoun's
gunners, exploded in residential districts of Syrian-policed west
Beirut in the pre-dawn shelling, the spokesman said.
   A Christian military source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Syrians today deployed 180mm Soviet-designed howitzers for
the first time since the current round of violence broke out March
8.
   ``They are using the heavy howitzers to knock out army bunkers
and fortifications. It seems they want to use it to demolish vital
utilities as well,'' the source said.
   The clashes erupted after Aoun clamped a blockade on militia-run
illegal ports in an effort to reactivate tax-collection at the five
government harbors along the 130-mile coastline.
   Aoun escalated the crisis by declaring a ``war of liberation''
against Syria's 40,000 troops deployed in predominantly Moslem
areas of Lebanon since 1976 under a peacekeeping mandate from the
Arab League.
   Hostilities have persisted despite a truce called by the Arab
League on Tuesday and a unilateral cease-fire declared Wednesday by
Aoun, a Maronite Catholic who also heads the Christian cabinet in
Lebanon's dual government.
   The U.N. Security Council on Friday issued a cease-fire appeal
urging ``all the parties to put an immediate end to the
confrontations, to respond favorably to the appeals launched for an
effective cease-fire and to avoid any action that might further
heighten the tension.''
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the rival Moslem
cabinet, today called for ``a mechanism to monitor implementation
of the cease-fire calls'' along with a settlement of the ports
controversy.
   The political crisis threatens to cement Lebanon's de faction
division into Christian and Moslem sectors after 14 years of civil
war.

<HEAD>Officials Find Eighth Body In Highway Killings Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTPORT, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An eighth body has been found along the
same highway where seven others have been discovered since July,
and authorities are urging the person who wrote them a letter
telling of its whereabouts to come forward.
   Two boys found the eighth body, that of a young woman, Friday
along Route 88 about 25 feet from the road, police said.
   ``Indications are that this is linked to the other seven and we
do in fact have our eighth victim in the highway murders,'' said
Jim Martin, a spokesman for the district attorney.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina said the woman
appeared to be in her late teens to early 20s.
   The first seven victims had been involved in prostitution or
drugs in New Bedford's Weld Square area, according to family
members and police. The first victim was found in July. The most
recent was discovered Tuesday.
   Pina said his office got an anonymous letter two weeks ago with
information about the missing women.
   The district attorney said the letter writer offered quite a bit
of information about the missing women.
   ``They indicated roughly where the body would be on 88 and said
they were hesitant to come forward,'' Pina said. ``But they said
they would possibly come forward if we found a body on 88. Well,
it's here. The body is on 88.''
   Martin said the remains were taken to St. Luke's Hospital in New
Bedford, where an autospy would be performed.

police said.
   Miami television station WTVJ had done a feature story on the

<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
today left Malawi convinced she has a role to play in seeking a
political settlement in South Africa.
   Malawi President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who is in his 80s,
kissed the British leader's hand as she curtsied to him in a
departure ceremony at Chileka airport near the commercial capital
of Blantyre.
   Thatcher's destination was kept secret, evidently for security
reasons, but she arrived shortly after noon today in Windhoek,
Namibia, on the first day of that southwest African territory's
process toward independence from South African control. Among those
she was expected to meet was South African Foreign Minister Pik
Botha.
   On her current African swing, the British premier has visited
Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Malawi.
   On each leg of the tour she has expressed hope that conditions
are right for a negotiated end to conflict in Southern Africa with
Britain playing a role in any possible political breakthrough in
white-ruled South Africa.
   At a banquet hosted by Banda at his hilltop palace outside
Blantyre late Friday, Thatcher said she was visiting a continent
torn by strife but she came ``with the conviction that this is the
time of new hope for Southern Africa''.
   She cited the U.N-supervised independence plan for Namibia
starting today as evidence of a conciliatory mood in the region
which secured a timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor, and South Africa's withdrawal
from Namibia.
   Thatcher said within South Africa itself, ``one sees a growing
acceptance that discrimination based on race and color must end and
will end, that black South Africans must be allowed to play their
part in politics and government.''
   Britain has said it is prepared assist in mediation efforts in
South Africa on condition jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela is released first and that the guerrilla leader
renounces violence.
   Thatcher has argued that Britain has unique expertise based on
experience gained from relinquising power in its former African
colonies, particularly Zimbabwe.
   An all-party conference chaired by Britian in 1979 ended a
seven-year guerrilla war in white-ruled Rhodesia and led to the
birth of the independent nation of Zimbabwe the following year.
   On her African tour, Thatcher has restated he opposition to an
economic blockade of South Africa, contending that sanctions would
hurt South Africa's 28 million blacks the most.
   In Namibia, ``now there must be free and fair elections just
like those which Britain organized in Zimbabwe nine years ago,''
she said.
   Thatcher was expected to hold talks with United Nations
officials in Namibia later today and visit British troops in a U.N.
peacekeeping force in the territory which has been controlled by
South Africa since World War 1.

<HEAD>Winter Weather Returns To Parts of Midwest, Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Winter weather returned today to parts of the Northeast and
Midwest, with storms dumping snow in upstate New York and delaying
spring field work for Ohio farmers.
   Low pressure off the New England coast brought snow to parts of
the lower Great Lakes region and northern New England.
   In upstate New York, snowstorms lingered after leaving up to 7
inches of snow in Batavia and 5 inches in Rochester, where police
reported numerous accidents as drivers coped with the reprise of
winter weather.
   ``Cars are off the road everywhere,'' said a state trooper in
the Rochester suburb of Henrietta. ``I don't know if it's the
busiest day of the year, but it's been busy. People forgot how to
drive. You get a couple of nice days and now it's winter again.''
   In Ohio, the cold weather slowed the growth of wheat and
pastures across the state. More than 8 inches of snow fell in
Youngstown, and snowstorms remained today in much of the Ohio
Valley.
   Elsewhere, widely scattered rain showers extended mainly from
eastern Nevada to western South Dakota and western Nebraska and a
few showers and thunderstorms dampened southern Florida.
   Today's forecast called for rain from New Jersey to Maine along
the East Coast; snow in the central and northern Appalachians; rain
and snow showers in the upper Mississippi Valley; widespread rain
in the Pacific Northwest; and showers across the northern and
central Rockies.
   Highs were expected to be in the 30s in much of Minnesota and
from the central Appalachians across upstate New York to northern
New England; 40s and 50s from the Pacific Northwest across the
northern and central Rockies, the northern Plains, the upper
Mississippi Valley, most of the Great Lakes region and the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to the middle and northern Atlantic Coast; 80s
from southwest Texas across southern New Mexico to southern
Arizona; and 90s in the desert Southwest.
   Elsewhere, highs were predicted to be in the 60s and 70s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 13
degrees at Hibbing, Minn., to 78 at Palm Springs, Calif.

<TEXT>
   Five oil pollution specialists from Norway,
including an expert on sea birds, are en route to Alaska to help
contain damage from the worst U.S. oil spill in history.
   The group is scheduled to arrive later today at Prince William
Sound, where the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 and
dumped 240,000 barrels of crude oil along the Alaskan coast.
   ``We can show them ways to clean up oily waste and how to
dispose of it so it breaks down more quickly,'' said Jens Henning
Koefoed of the National Pollution Control Authority.
   He described a process of spreading out waste over a layer of
bark and turning it several times a year to help nature break it
down.
   Norway's offer to lend its expertise was accepted by the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation on Thursday, according to
Koefoed. He is not a member of the team.
   The group will be led by Oeyvind Schreiner, another official
with the pollution authority.
   Speaking in a telephone interview, Schreiner, 44, said the
biologists, zoologists, equipment and training experts in the team
have experience from Norway's own offshore oil industry and from
international oil disasters.
   ``We have a lot of practice in monitoring oil companies'
handling of environmental problems,'' he said.
   The other team members are sea bird expert Tycho Anker-Nilssen,
35, of the Institute for Nature Research; Reidar Hindrum, 38, a
researcher from the Natural Resources Directorate; Bjoern
Koppangen, 52, an oil spill equipment specialist at the National
Operations and Training Center for Oil Pollution Control; and
training specialist Jan Nerland, 45, from the same center.
   ``We can help select areas that most need protection and which
research projects are needed to document the effect of the disaster
on animals, birds and fish,'' said Hindrum, a wildlife expert who
studies conflicts between ecology and the oil business.

   A police officer who shot and killed
three people in seven months was fired after notches were found
carved into his pistol.
   Bryan Farrell, 25, was dismissed Friday after Dallas Police
Department investigators discovered two marks on the 9mm pistol's
trigger guard while looking into the third killing in the Dallas
suburb of Arlington.
   Farrell was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in the first two
killings.
   He fatally shot Ray Soto Jr. of Arlington on Aug. 2 when Soto
raised a handgun toward Farrell and a fellow officer. Less than
three weeks later, Farrell shot 33-year-old Martin Williams during
a struggle that occurred along Interstate 30 in Fort Worth.
   Farrell shot Michael Robinson, 21, on Feb. 1 while serving a
warrant in Dallas.
   The same gun was used in all three killings, said Officer Dee
Anderson, spokesman for the Arlington Police Department.
   ``These markings and their possible inference were obviously
very troublesome to us,'' Anderson said during a news conference.
``We do not know at this point who put the marks on the gun and
what they signify.''
   Farrell told investigators he was unaware of the markings.
   His weapon was confiscated after each of the first two
shootings, a standard procedure, but Anderson said the markings
weren't found until after the third shooting.
   ``No one noticed any markings,'' Anderson said. ``All I can say
is that they were not noticed or reported to us after the first two
shootings. I can't say whether they were there or not, factually.''
   Anderson would not describe the nicks, and he did not speculate
when asked if investigators felt the marks represented some sort of
kill tally.
   ``We have not been able to determine what they mean,'' he said.

   A multimillion dollar effort will dump
tons of rock on Mount Kenya's snow-capped peak to make it Africa's
highest mountain, a newspaper claimed today in an April Fools' Day
story.
   Haroun Wandala, the reporter who wrote the front-page piece for
The Standard, estimated at least half the readers who called the
newspaper about Mount Kenya's purported facelift thought the story
was true.
   ``One fellow asked if we'd considered the ecological impact such
a project would have on the mountain's streams and rivers and
surrounding area,'' said Wandala with a laugh.
   Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania is Africa's highest peak at 19,340
feet. Mount Kenya, which straddles the equator, is the continent's
second highest peak at 17,058 feet.
   The Standard story claimed the distinctions in altitude would
reverse by 1991 after an internationally-funded project costing
hundreds of millions of dollars succeeded in dumping enough 10-ton
buckets of rock and soil on its peak to add 2,500 feet to its
height.
   One of the pictures accompanying the item showed a man on a
snowy slope holding up a 12-foot ruler that the paper said would be
used ``to ensure the mountain reaches its height of 19,552 feet.''
   ``The story was designed to suit the day,'' said Wandala.

<HEAD>Eight More Murder Counts Against Landlady</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former rooming house landlady, who
was arrested when the bodies of seven tenants were unearthed in her
front yard last year, has been charged with eight more counts of
murder.
   Dorothea Montalvo Puente was charged with the additional counts
Friday, bringing to nine the number of elderly or disabled people
the woman is accused of poisoning in order to get their Social
Security checks.
   Puente, 60, pleaded innocent to each of the charges before
Municipal Court Judge John V. Stroud. She faces the death penalty
if convicted. She previously had been charged with a single count
of murder.
   On Friday, the district attorney's office added eight counts,
including the seven buried bodies, a body found in a box along the
Sacramento River and a former patient of Puente, who once worked as
a nurse.
   Investigators said all of the victims were Puente's former
tenants. They were killed over a three-year period, except for the
nursing patient, who died in 1982 of an apparent codeine overdose.
   Supervising Deputy District Attorney Tim Frawley said
authorities were also investigating the death of another patient
nursed by Puente.
   Kevin Clymo, Puente's court-appointed lawyer, declined to
discuss the case.
   Puente has a record of state and federal criminal offenses,
including a 1982 conviction for defrauding two elderly people and
robbing and drugging a third.
   She fled Sacramento last November when authorities began digging
up human remains in the grounds of her Victorian boardinghouse. She
was recaptured days later in Los Angeles and returned to
Sacramento, where she has been held in the Sacramento County jail
without bail.
   Stroud set the preliminary hearing for Sept. 12.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of dockworkers and students
armed with clubs, firebombs and rocks fought police for the second
consecutive day today, protesting a police crackdown that ended a
prolonged strike at the nation's largest shipyard.
   About 3,500 protesters took to the streets of Ulsan, about 150
miles southeast of Seoul, in scattered protests, news reports said.
   Police fired tear gas and charged the protesters, who responded
with rocks and firebombs in hit-and-run battles, according to the
South Korean news agency Yonhap. The report said nothing of arrests
or injuries.
   Thousands of riot police guarded Ulsan's Hyundai shipyard, where
the strike was broken up, and established checkpoints around bus
terminals and on roads leading to the shipyard to block
sympathizers from joining the protesters, it said.
   In Seoul, about 1,000 students supporting Hyundai strikers
battled riot police around Hanyang University for an hour after
burning effigies of President Roh Tae-woo and Hyundai.
   The Ulsan shipyard is owned by the Hyundai group, one of the
largest conglomerates in South Korea. One of its subsidiaries
manufactures cars for the U.S. auto market.
   Masked students brandishing firebombs streamed out of the gates,
yelling ``Down with Roh Tae-woo, who stifles workers' rights!''
About 2,000 riot police sealed off the campus and fired hundreds of
tear gas shells.
   There were no immediate reports of arrests and injuries in Seoul.
   Operations of the Hyundai shipyard remained slow, although more
than half of its 22,000-member work force showed up for work today.
   Riot police stormed the shipyard Thursday in a land, sea and air
attack to end the strike, whose violence injured about 400 people
since December.
   Hyundai's trouble began last Dec. 12, when militant workers
broke away from a company-sanctioned union and organized a separate
group, demanding pay hikes and better working conditions.
   The police intervention triggered violent protests in Seoul and
other cities by strike sympathizers who accused the government of
suppressing free labor and protecting conglomerates at the cost of
workers.

   Cherokee Indians from across the country
are observing the 150th anniversary of the Trail of Tears, the
forced march from their Southeastern homeland that claimed an
estimated 4,000 lives.
   ``In Cherokee memory it is only a short time ago,'' Wilma
Mankiller, chief of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, told about 300
people gathered Friday on the lawn of the old Cherokee national
capitol in this northeast Oklahoma city of 10,000. The observance
ends today.
   The forced relocation of much of the tribe to Oklahoma ended in
late 1839. Of the estimated 4,000 Cherokees who died, many were
buried in unmarked graves.
   ``And yet here we are. Here we are. Despite everything that has
happened to us,'' Ms. Mankiller said.
   Today, the 93,000-member Cherokee Tribe is the nation's second
largest, behind the Navajos.
   Ms. Mankiller and Chief Jonathan Taylor of the eastern band of
Cherokees from Cherokee, N.C., planted an oak tree on the capitol
grounds ``in memory of many people who were on the trail who did
not make it to the new home,'' said Deputy Chief John Ketcher of
Tahlequah.
   Officials had made it clear the prayers and speeches were to be
more a memorial service than a celebration, but some said their
ancestors' travails 150 years ago were not being emphasized enough.
   Pat Moss of Stilwell, vice chairman of Native Americans for a
Clean Environment, asked that April 1 be recognized as an
international day of sorrow in memory of those who died on the
Trail of Tears.
   ``The forced relocation of Cherokee and other indigenous people,
known as the Trail of Tears, was an act of genocide,'' Moss said.
   ``While it is a very, very sad time in our history, I still
believe we can draw strength from our ancestors,'' said Ms.
Mankiller. ``I've been able to draw strength from that terrible
time in our history.''
   She emphasized that when they were relocated the Cherokees were
a civilized, self-governing tribe.
   The tribe survived the Trail of Tears to reform its government,
establish schools, and erect civic buildings in northeast Oklahoma.
   However, in 1906 the tribe's land was taken away; members were
given individual allotments. The Cherokees had no constitutional
tribal government until 1971, when the capitol was re-established
in Tahlequah.

   Thai pirates raided a boat full of
Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea, massacred 45 of them
and kidnapped about 11 women, officials said today.
   An old man and young boy were the only survivors of the attack,
which occurred within about the last seven days, said the
officials, who work with refugees and who spoke with The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity.
   The pirates stormed the unarmed boat, slashed the passengers
with knives and threw their bodies overboard, the officials said.
The attackers ran their boat over the floating bodies to make sure
no one was alive, the sources said.
   The two survivors hid under planks floating in the water, and
their boat later drifted to an Esso Oil Co. rig in the South China
Sea off the Trengganu coast of Malaysia, the officials said.
   Workers picked up the two on Monday and sent them to the
Malaysian government hospital in Kuala Trengganu, 180 miles
northeast of Kuala Lumpur. ``This is one of the worst cases of
piracy reported in recent years, and the pirates nowadays kill the
people after plundering the boats so that there would be no
witnesses,'' said a senior refugee official.
   The refugee officials said the two survivors did not give a full
account of their experience. They did not say exactly when the
attack took place or how many pirates took part. There was no word
on the fate of the kidnapped women.
   ``The women are normally raped and either killed and dumped into
the sea or abandoned in remote islands,'' said another refugee
official.
   In January, refugee officials said two Vietnamese women were
raped and dumped on a remote Thai island before arriving at the
camp. The women reported that 26 people in their boat were killed
by Thai pirates late last year.
   The officials said such attacks by Thai pirates had decreased
since the early 1980s when Thai and Malaysian authorities had
stepped up boat patrols. The government reported that in March,
about 2,000 Vietnamese refugees landed on Malaysian shores, almost
double the average for the past few months. There are now about
16,500 Vienamese boat people in Malaysia.
   Malaysia and the nations of the region accept the refugees only
for temporary stay pending permanent settlement in the West.

   Three East Germans trying to escape to the West
crashed a car through a border barrier but were captured by guards,
police said today.
   Witnesses heard several gunshots during the incident Friday
night at the Drewitz control point between East Germany and West
Berlin, a West Berlin police spokesman said.
   ``The car rammed through a border barrier and then smashed
against another. Border guards then took the three men away,'' said
the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   East Germany's state-run news agency, ADN, also reported the
incident but did not mention shooting or characterize it as an
escape attempt.
   According to ADN, three ``traffic rowdies'' were arrested for
``excessive speed'' and ``security installations'' were damaged.
   The Drewitz control point is just east of Potsdam, East Germany,
and on the southwestern periphery of West Berlin.

   Heavily armed police today patrolled
southern Kosovo province to prevent demonstrations by ethnic
Albanians marking the anniversary of Serb-Albanian rioting in 1981.
   Helmeted riot police patrolled the provincial capital, Pristina,
the site of recent violence, but the city was calm.
   At least 24 people died and more than 200 were wounded in the
province on Monday and Tuesday when thousands of ethnic Albanians
protested constitutional changes that increased Serbia's control
over Kosovo. It was the deadliest rioting since 1981, when at least
nine people were killed.
   No incidents were reported today. Schools were closed, public
gatherings banned and police enforced an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew.
   The local Communist Party leadership met to discuss the recent
rioting.
   They were also to discuss the resignation of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian president Rahman Morina. He stepped down in February after
striking miners claimed he did not represent Albanian interests
because he agreed to constitutional changes reducing Kosovo's
automony.
   But the party leadership was expected not to accept Morina's
resignation in a move that could cause more unrest by ethnic
Albanians, according to Iljaz Ramajlji, a member of Kosovo's
Politburo.
   The state-run Tanjug news agency accused neighboring Albania of
inciting the demonstrators and the interior minister complained out
outside interference. Yugoslavia and Albania have communist regimes
that have remained independent of the Soviet bloc.
   Kosovo Interior Minister Jusuf Karakusi said Friday:
   ``The situation has the outward appearance of becoming calmer,
but the organized hostile forces, acting from the position of
Albanian nationalism and separatism, are not idle. They are
preparing new actions.''
   He said the riots were instigated by ``illegal hostile forces
that are active in Kosovo and outside Yugoslavia.'' He did not name
those forces.
   A Tanjug commentary said Albania ``strongly incites extremist
nationalists in Kosovo to actions against the law and order.''
   The violence began after constitutional changes were made that
gave Serbia, the largest republic in Yugoslavia, greater control
over the judiciary, police and schools in Kosovo _ a Serbian
province. Kosovo had gained a substantial degree of autonomy under
Yugoslavia's 1974 consitution.
   But Serbian leaders said the new changes, which went into effect
Tuesday, were necessary to protect the Slav minority from
harassment by the ethnic Albanians that comprise 85 percent of
Kosovo's population of 1.9 million.

<TEXT>
   Travelers paying $39,000 a ticket set off today
aboard a Concorde jet for the aircraft's first supersonic
circumnavigation of the globe.
   American journalist William F. Buckley, Jr. is leading the
38,343-mile, 22-day voyage from London to New York, Acapulco,
Tahiti, Australia and beyond, said a spokesman for British Airways,
which owns the jet.
   Concordes have circled the globe before but not using supersonic
speeds for each leg or for that distance, said the spokesman, Ken
Cook.
   He said the jet could break more than a dozen world speed
records during the trip, but he did not name the records he was
referring to.
   Most segments of the tour will take less than three hours. For
example, the jet will fly the 3,000 miles from Sri Lanka to Kenya
in two hours, 40 minutes.
   He said a Miami-based U.S. travel firm, Lorraine Travel Bureau
Inc., chartered the jet for the tour and that all 100 seats for the
trip had been sold out. Most passengers were scheduled to leave
from New York.
   During the trip, Buckley planned to broadcast his television
show ``Firing Line'' from Cape Town, South Africa, and Sydney,
Australia, said Cook.
   Ticket prices included all hotels and meals as well as extras
such as a safari in Africa and cruises in Tahiti, Acapulco, and New
Zealand. Single-occupancy travelers paid $1,000 extra.
   After taking off from London, the Concorde was scheduled to fly
to New York; Acapulco, Mexico; Oakland, Calif.; Honolulu; Papeete,
Tahiti; Christchurch, New Zealand; Sydney; Perth, Australia;
Colombo, Sri Lanka; Mombasa, Kenya; Cape Town; Monrovia, Liberia;
and back to London.

   Thousands of people gathered downtown
today to pay final respects to Europe's last empress, Zita, who was
to be buried with all the pageantry of the monarchy that vanished
more than 70 years ago.
   In an outpouring of sentiment for the Hapsburg Empire, up to
2,000 people an hour moved by the velvet-draped coffin in St.
Stephen's Roman Catholic Cathedral containing Zita's body.
   Souvenir sellers outside the cathedral did a brisk trade in
portraits of Zita as a young beauty and in T-shirts that marked the
occasion.
   Austria's largest circulation newspaper, the tabloid Neue Kronen
Zeitung, took up its entire front page with a photograph of
hundreds of mourners waiting to file past the coffin and the simple
headline, ``Farewell to Zita.''
   The headline ran against a background in yellow, the color of
the imperial House of Hapsburg.
   Zita's funeral was planned as the biggest since the Hapsburg
Empire buried Emperor Franz Joseph in 1916.
   Zita died two weeks ago in Switzerland at age 96. After the
collapse of the monarchy in 1918, Zita and her husband, Charles I,
were forced into exile and all titles of nobility were abolished.
   All the Roman Catholic royal familes of Europe sent
representatives to the funeral, but no reigning monarchs attended.
   President Kurt Waldheim was among the mourners in the cathedral.
   At a Mass led by Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer the languages of
the Hapsburg monarchy _ German, Italian, Hungarian, Czech, Croat,
Slovenian and Polish _ sounded in the intercessions read for Zita.
   Visitors came from the far corners of the former monarchy, which
once included Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and parts of
Italy.

<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Scots demonstrated today
to protest a new tax that symbolizes the London government many of
them reject.
   Bagpipers led a crowd estimated at 12,000 through the streets to
protest the change, which eliminates local property taxes and
substitutes a flat tax rate for all people 18 and over. The change
took effect today.
   Speakers from opposition parties, churches and other groups
urged people not to pay it _ a response long supported by Scottish
nationalists seeking to make the tax a major issue.
   ``I have got absolutely no intention of paying (the new) tax,''
said Eleanor McLaughlin, Edinburgh's lord provost. She said she
would refuse to pay to join the poor who ``can't afford it.''
   The tax is part of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's crusade
against socialism and high-spending local governments.
   It requires each local authority to calculate its expenses and
set a uniform sum to be paid by every resident 18 and over.
   The sums are expected to average $436 a year per adult, with 80
percent rebates available for those on low incomes.
   The government says it will make local governments more
accountable by forcing municipalities to stop financing social
programs for those who pay little or no tax with money collected
from the middle class.
   But many Scots have said the tax revenue will not be returned to
Scotland.
   Opinion polls show that many believe they will be worse off
because of the new tax, which is due to take effect in England and
Wales in a year.
   The Scottish National Party, which seeks outright independence
for the 5.2 million Scots, was collecting signatures of people
pledging not to pay the tax.

   President Bush says he would have gotten
nowhere with Congress had he tried to win new military aid for the
Contras, and he denies his diplomatic approach to Nicaragua means
the military efforts had failed.
   ``There was no way, not a snowball's chance in hell, of getting
a dime for lethal aid, military aid, from Congress,'' Bush said
Friday in a question-and-answer session with a group of regional
media representatives. ``And I think anybody who's familiar with
Congress would acknowledge that.''
   Bush today engaged in Latin American diplomacy, meeting with
Venezuela's new president, Carlos Andres Perez, and several top
administration officials.
   The group, including Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, discussed a range of issues of
concern to the Latin world, including the Third World debt crisis
and Central America peace efforts, according to a senior
administration official.
   In the question-and-answer session Friday, rejected a suggestion
that his emphasis on diplomacy in the region amounts to an
admission that President Reagan's policy of military support for
the Contras had failed.
   Bush said military pressure convinced Nicaragua's ruling
Sandinistas to join in peace talks calling for democratic reforms
in their country.
   On other issues, Bush also ruled out any backing away from his
support for expanded oil exploration in Alaska. To turn away from
the oil resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, he said,
would be irresponsible, despite the recent environmental disaster
created by the 10-million gallon spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker.
   ``We are becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil, and
that is not acceptable to any president,'' Bush said. ``We have to
transport oil. What we will do is not go backwards.''
   Bush's comments Friday on the Contras were the first he has made
indicating that the dim prospects for military aid influenced his
decision to pursue a diplomatic solution.
   In a bipartisan package worked out with Congressional leaders,
he is proposing $40 million in nonlethal aid to keep the Contras
intact until the Nicaraguan elections at the beginning of next year.
   ``It's not bad, the policy has been well received,'' he said.
``We are speaking with one voice. We are going to push for
democratization.''
   As to El Salvador's new president, Alfredo Cristiani, the
candidate of the rightist Arena party, Bush said, ``We will treat
the Salvadoran winner on his word, that he wants to continue the
democracy,'' espoused under outgoing Christian Democratic President
Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   He pledged to ``redouble efforts'' for safe transport.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed one
Palestinian today in a clash in the village of Bethany, and another
reportedly died of wounds inflicted by Jewish settlers, the army
and Arab hospital officials said.
   The victim in Bethany was shot when a group of Palestinians
stoned an Israeli army jeep patrol and slightly injured two
soldiers, the military said. An army spokesman said the Palestinian
died at an east Jerusalem hospital.
   Arab reporters identified the Palestinian as Akram Mustafa
Mahmoud Yassin, 24, and said he was shot in the heart.
   The army said another Palestinian died of gunshot wounds
suffered Thursday, but could not confirm reports by Arab hospital
officials and Israel radio that he was shot by Jewish settlers.
   Arab reporters identified the victim as Tareq Awad Farah Amir,
23.
   The two deaths would raise the Palestinian death toll to 417
since the uprising against Israeli occupation began in December
1987.
   Eighteen Israelis have also died.
   Arab reporters said Yassin's family took his body from Muqassed
Hospital and buried him in a cemetary near a grotto that was built
in the 4th century A.D. to mark a site believed to be the tomb of
Lazarus. The army imposed a curfew on the village's 4,000 residents
after Yassin's funeral.
   Six Palestinians were also wounded in confrontations with troops.
   They included a 12-year-old Arab from the Gaza Strip who was
shot in the hand; four Arabs were wounded in Gaza City when troops
opened fire to disperse a demonstration in the area's commercial
center; and a 16-year-old boy who was shot and wounded in the West
Bank village of Hajah.
   In the Gaza Strip about 180,000 residents remained under curfew
in six refugee camps and neighborhoods.
   The longest standing curfew is on the Shati refugee camp where
residents have been confined to their homes for 15 days.

   It might be easy for those on the
outside to dismiss President Najib as a hulking, former secret
police chief presiding over a repressive government destined for
defeat.
   But this same man has proved himself to be an eloquent orator, a
shrewd combatant during political infighting, and a politician deft
at appealing to feelings of nationalism.
   The test now at hand is the battle for Jalalabad, where
U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas have besieged Najib's forces
nearly four weeks.
   Neither side has been able to claim victory. Thousands of people
have surely died, although neither side has sufficient credibility
for its casualty reports to be believed.
   Najib has fired his biggest guns, literally and figuratively.
   The Soviet-supplied Scud-B missiles launched toward Jalalabad
from Kabul several times a day are monster-size weapons, but their
impact may be as much psychological as physical.
   The government makes no effort to conceal its Scuds, trundling
the 36-foot-long missiles through the center of Kabul on open truck
beds in broad daylight. The roar with which they are fired is
unmistakable.
   Their message _ and that of the Air Force MiGs and Sukhois _ is
clear: Najib's weapons outclass any rockets, mortars or shells the
guerrillas can pack across the border from Pakistan.
   Although the Soviet Union withdrew the last of its combat troops
from Afghanistan on Feb. 15, it continues to supply the Kabul
government with Scuds, smaller weapons and food and says it will do
so as long as the United States aids the guerrillas.
   The guerrillas are caught in a dilemma. They are most effective
in hit-and-run attacks, not bogged down in confrontation with a
regular army that outnumbers and outguns them.
   Conversely, regular armies rarely vanquish guerrilla forces
militarily, as the Israelis learned against the Palestine
Liberation Organization in Lebanon and the Indians against Tamil
guerrillas in Sri Lanka.
   The most effective solution is a political one, which is
impossible to achieve unless both sides agree to negotiate. But
guerrilla leaders refuse to talk to Najib and say they will not
give up the fight until his Soviet-style party is removed.
   Najib is giving the political side his best shot.
   ``Fratricide brings nothing but misery and agony,'' the
president said last week in a radio appeal aimed at the guerrillas'
local commanders inside Afghanistan. Referring to them as ``dear
compatriots'' and ``my brothers'' and to their Pakistan-based
political leaders as ``the enemy'' and ``the extremists,'' Najib
offered a cease-fire and local autonomy to commanders who would
stop fighting.
   From guerrilla headquarters in Pakistan came a rejection of
Najib's offer. But the government claims it has opened negotiations
with some local commanders it refused to identify.
   Najib rarely misses an opportunity to accuse Pakistan of
``vicious warmongering,'' of imposing a foreign-inspired war on
Afghans. It is a calculated ploy aimed at the fiercely independent
and tribalistic Afghans' centuries-old antipathy to outsiders.
   There also seems to be a growing feeling in war-weary Kabul that
Najib, although unquestionably an authoritarian leader, is not as
bad as his predecessors in the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan.
   The Afghan monarchy ended in 1973 when King Zahir Shah was
overthrown by a cousin, Mohammad Daoud. Five years later, the
People's Democratic Party overthrew and assassinated Daoud,
bringing Noor Mohammad Taraki to power.
   Taraki himself was killed in 1979 as party rival Hafizullah Amin
took over. With the Amin regime teetering under guerrilla attacks
and party feuds, the Soviet Union sent troops to Kabul later that
year and Amin was assassinated.
   Amin's successor, Babrak Karmal, in turn was shunted aside by
Najib in 1986.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights monitoring
group, estimated that 35,000 Afghans have been imprisoned or
disappeared _ the majority of them in the pre-Najib early 1980s.
Under Najib, there are still political arrests but the number of
detentions has dropped sharly, according to several foreign
observers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Taraki, Amin and Babrak were crazy men. Maybe Najib is not so
bad,'' said one businessman. Others have expressed similar views.
   The party traditionally is divided between the Parcham faction
headed by Najib and the Khalq faction of the late Taraki and Amin.
In October, Najib purged Parchami dissidents and a month later
dispatched the top Khalqi leader, Gen. Mohammad Gulabzoi, to Moscow
as ambassador _ a time-tested Afghan way of getting potential
troublemakers out of the country.

   An April Fools' Day joke in a local
newspaper turned sour Saturday when riot police were called to
control more than 2,000 readers demanding cash prizes in a numbers
game, officials said.
   The Dawasa newspaper Saturday offered readers the equivalent of
about $300 in a numbers drawing and said the prize was to be
claimed before noon.
   A police official said more than 2,000 readers gathered at the
newspaper office in downtown Colombo and demanded the money. Riot
police were called when the readers refused to accept the
newspaper's explanation that the game was a joke, he said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
crowd dispersed only after management gave written assurances a
final decision on the prizes would be made later.

<TEXT>
   A man suffering from Legionnaires' disease has
died, a hospital official said Saturday, bringing to six the death
toll from two separate outbreaks of the illness.
   The Times newspaper said the victim was the first to die from an
outbreak in the Knightsbridge area of London. It said five other
cases had been reported there.
   Another outbreak of the disease in central London killed five
people and sickened 31 others.
   An official at St. Mary's Hospital in west London confirmed that
a man died Friday of the disease, but he refused to give further
details.
   ``I'm not denying it,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``I wouldn't be talking to you if it hadn't
happened, but we have nothing to add.''
   The disease, which causes pneumonia-like symptoms, is believed
to be caused by bacteria found in soil and water supplies such as
air-conditioning ducts or storage tanks.
   A year ago, an outbreak of the disease at the British
Broadcasting Corp. headquarters killed three men. The BBC admitted
breaching health and safety laws and was fined $9,600.

<HEAD>Workers, Students Protest Police Crackdown in Ulsan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of dockworkers and students
armed with clubs, firebombs and rocks clashed with police Saturday
to protest a police crackdown that ended a strike at South Korea's
largest shipyard.
   About 3,500 workers and students battled police in the port city
of Ulsan, about 150 miles southeast of Seoul, news reports said.
The sporadic street fighting and protests lasted most of the day,
according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Thousands of high school students, shoppers and office workers
caught in hit-and-run street battles fled, covering their mouths
and faces from clouds of choking tear gas, reports said.
   In Seoul, about 1,000 students from Hanyang university protested
the government decision to use 14,000 riot police to put down the
more than 3-month-old strike at the Hyundai shipyard.
   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries in Seoul,
but Yonhap said 80 workers and police had been injured in Ulsan
since police entered the shipyard Thursday.
   The shipyard is owned by the Hyundai Group, one of the largest
conglomerates in South Korea.
   Hundreds of masked students carrying banners with
anti-government slogans streamed from the university gates shouting
``Down with Roh Tae-woo who stifles workers' rights!''
   They burned effigies of Roh and Chung Ju-yung, honorary chairman
of Hyundai. Some hurled firebombs and swung wood and steel clubs,
while others stood on walls surrounding the campus and threw rocks.
   Riot police fired hundreds of tear gas shells.
   The National Council of Student Representatives, a major radical
student group, said it would launch a nationwide wave of attacks on
Hyundai in support of workers. Hyundai offices and automobile
showrooms were attacked Friday and protesters battled police in
seven cities.
   In Ulsan, thousands of riot police guarded the shipyard and set
up check points around bus terminals and on roads leading to the
shipyard to block more sympathizers from joining the protesters,
said Yonhap.
   Operations at the shipyard were slow, although more than half of
the 22,000-member work force showed up for work Saturday, officials
said.
   Prosecutors brought formal charges against 10 union leaders for
conspiring to cause violence and said investigations continued
against some of 697 other workers who were arrested.
   Riot police stormed the shipyard Thursday in a land, sea and air
attack to end a violent strike that left about 400 people injured.
   Hyundai's trouble began Dec. 12 when about 5,000 militant
workers broke away from a company-sanctioned union and organized a
separate group, demanding pay increases and better working
conditions.
   The police intervention triggered violent protests in Seoul and
other cities by strike sympathizers who accused the government of
suppressing free labor and protecting conglomerates at the cost of
workers.

<TEXT>
   For his first appearance in the West
since the Armenian earthquake cut short his U.S. visit in December,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has chosen a small nation that in some ways
straddles Europe's political, social and military divides.
   The Soviet president's stopover Sunday at Shannon Airport en
route to Cuba and then Britain is the first visit by a Soviet
leader to this 95-percent Roman Catholic country.
   As the most Catholic nation in Europe, Ireland is instinctively
anti-communist, and 85 percent of the population votes for
conservative parties. But it also cherishes the neutrality that
kept it out of World War II and makes it the only member of the
European Economic Community to stay out of the NATO alliance.
   The EEC's drive to harmonize its members' policies leads some
Irish to worry their neutrality is being compromised, and a visit
by the leader of the communist world could help restore the balance.
   For a country of 3.5 million people still undergoing the
transition from a rural to industrial society, even a brief visit
from a Soviet leader is a big prestige boost.
   Irish newspapers Saturday devoted special sections to the visit,
which the Irish Times described as confirmation of Prime Minister
Charles Haughey's ``role as an international statesman.'' The Irish
Independent said the visit was both ``significant and symbolic.''
   Gerald Frost, director of the London Institute for European
Defense and Strategic Studies, observes that an Irish visit is
obligatory for a U.S. president but unusual for a Soviet.
   He said the rare visit will focus attention on ``and probably
facilitate the Gorbachev charm offensive.''
   Gorbachev's six-day trip to communist Cuba and then Britain was
supposed to follow his visit to Washington last December. But he
had to rush home when the Armenian earthquake struck.
   Liam Skelley, deputy head of Aer Rianta, the Irish airports
authority, was mindful of Gorbachev's attempt to curb Soviet vodka
consumption and made tea and coffee available, in addition to Irish
whiskey.
   The visit underlines Irish-Soviet commercial ties, as Shannon's
duty-free stores were open to Gorbachev and his wife Raisa.
   Aer Rianta runs the duty-free shops at Moscow's Sheremetyevo
airport. The symbol of the seven-year joint venture begun last year
is a shamrock on the face of the Kremlin clock.
   In 1980, the Soviet airline Aeroflot began refueling at Shannon
on North American routes. Now 1,500 Aeroflot jets land at Shannon
each year and Skelley and his staff are taking Russian lessons.
   Aer Rianta takes over the Leningrad airport shops this summer
and has a $3.4 million annual contract to paint Aeroflot jets.
   Soviet-Irish trade totaled $62.5 billion last year, running 3-1
in Moscow's favor. But that was down from $75.7 billion in 1987
when Moscow stepped up Irish meat imports.

<HEAD>Alamo Management Battle Pits Hispanics Against `Daughters of Texas
Republic'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 150 years ago, legend has it, Alamo
commander William B. Travis drew a line across the grounds of the
old Spanish mission. He asked his men to step over it and defend
the Alamo against thousands of Mexican troops.
   Today, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, who have cared
for the Alamo for 84 years, are emulating Travis' legendary gesture
as they battle with legislators and Hispanic leaders who want to
wrestle control of the Alamo away from the 6,000-member group.
   Travis lost his battle to Santa Anna in March 1836, but Texas
troops rallied with the cry ``Remember the Alamo!'' and later
defeated Mexican troops to regain the Alamo and win Texas'
independence from Mexico.
   Now, critics of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas say the
mission would be better run by a state agency accountable to the
public, particularly in light of an audit that showed the
Daughters' Alamo chapter with a budget surplus of nearly $2 million.
   ``We aren't hiding anything. Our books are open and we are
complying with the open records and open meetings laws,'' said
Marjorie Hardy, a chapter chairwoman. Tourism officials estimate
chapter members usher close to 10 million visitors a year through
the mission in the heart of downtown.
   Shifting control to the state, Ms. Hardy said, would cost
taxpayers because state workers would be paid for duties that
volunteers now perform. As for the surplus, Ms. Hardy said it was
being saved to build a larger theater in the complex.
   ``We are very proud of what we have done with the Alamo, but we
are not bragging about ourselves. Maybe we should,'' Ms. Hardy said.
   Daughters of the Republic of Texas are descendants of people who
lived in Texas between 1836 and 1845, when it was an independent
republic before becoming part of the United States. The Daughters
received a state charter in 1905 to operate the Alamo.
   The complex includes a chapel with artifacts and flags, a
souvenir shop and research library, a small building where
documentaries are shown and enclosed grounds with several cannons
on display. Admission is free, and operating expenses are covered
by souvenir sales profits. No state money is used.
   Recently, the Daughters asked Attorney General Jim Mattox to
clarify their legal status; he ruled that the group must comply
with the state open records law because it manages a state-owned
site.
   Meanwhile, state Rep. Ron Wilson filed a bill that would
transfer control of the Alamo from the Daughters to the Texas Parks
&amp; Wildlife Department, which operates numerous state parks and
museums.
   ``It's a historical structure, probably the most historical
structure in the state, and for the state not to have control or
management of it is a little absurd,'' he said. A House committee
is slated to have a hearing on the bill later this month.
   Adding fuel to the Alamo controversy is Jose Garcia de Lara,
president of the League of United Latin American Citizens.
   Garcia, who says he is a descendant of Bernardo Gutierrez de
Lara, author of the Republic of Texas declaration of independence,
maintains the Alamo is a symbol of oppression for Hispanics.
   He said the League and the Daughters should work together to see
that Hispanic heroes of the Alamo _ Mexicans who fought alongside
the other Alamo defenders _ are granted the same respect as Travis,
James Bowie and Davy Crockett.
   ``The DRT has a perception that they own the Alamo and because
of that they have managed it and handled it in a way that has
excluded Hispanics from participating in historical activities,''
de Lara said.
   Adela Navarro, 85-year-old descendant of Republic of Texas
statesman Jose Antonio Navarro, also favors state control of the
Alamo, though she herself is a member of a Daughters chapter.
   ``These old girls play dirty politics. The Alamo doesn't belong
to them ...,'' Ms. Navarro said. ``They think they are superior and
they are not.''
   But supporters of the Daughters, including Mayor Henry Cisneros
and state Rep. Orlando Garcia of San Antonio, say the group has
done an admirable job of restoring the Alamo and telling the
history of Texas accurately.
   ``They are blood descendants of the heroes of the Alamo,''
Cisneros said. ``No one else will treat either the building or the
history of the period with the care and reverence they bring to the
task.''
   Garcia, who had asked the Daughters to open their records,
agrees they take care of the Alamo as no one else could and adds,
``the state is not in a position to be assuming new burdens.''
   Pauline Wilson, president of the Daughters' Alamo chapter, said
hard work went into making the Alamo the tourist attraction it is
today.
   ``The older members brought in their husbands, their kids, even
their maids to clean the place out,'' she said. ``Where were all
these people when we were having such a hard time with it?''

<HEAD>With Tower Fight Over, Lawmakers Turn to Juggling Money and Missiles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress, finally freed of the knockdown,
dragged-out fight over the nomination of John Tower as defense
secretary, is focusing on resolving long-overdue problems such as
funding the military in a zero-growth budget and modernizing the
nation's land-based missiles.
   The nearly two-month, bitter debate over Tower, his later
rejection by the Senate and the eventual confirmation of former
Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming has delayed Pentagon decisions past set
deadlines.
   In turn, Congress' defense plate remains relatively empty.
   ``The `in box' drives everything,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in an
interview last week.
   Among the Pentagon's missed deadlines was a Feb. 15 decision on
funding for the single-warhead Midgetman, the mobile, 10-warhead MX
missile and other land-based modernization programs as well as
budget action due April 3.
   The delay, according to Aspin, will limit Cheney to ``mundane
changes'' as he cuts $6.3 billion from the fiscal 1990 defense
budget originally proposed by former President Reagan.
   ``The changes are not going to be very inspired,'' Aspin said.
``We're facing a brand new era with (Soviet President Mikhail)
Gorbachev ... but I don't think we'll see creative thinking.''
   Aspin praised Cheney's abilities but said time constraints and
the usual delays in Senate confirmation of the defense secretary's
subordinates will limit creativity.
   But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said Friday he did not envision any problems
from the lengthy battle over a defense secretary.
   ``It's not an unreasonable delay nor is it as a result going to
create any big problems,'' said Levin, who expects Cheney to make
``better decisions, decisions with more credibility.''
   Cheney is scheduled to meet next week with the Defense Resources
Board on final changes in the defense budget.
   Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office said that if Cheney
choses to eliminate some military forces rather than cancel weapons
in response to budget cuts, the result would be massive force
reductions, including six Army divisions and four Navy aircraft
carriers.
   One of the major choices facing the new defense secretary is
deciding on a modernization plan based on the MX, the Midgetman or
a combination of the two.
   Congress decided last year to authorize $850 million in fiscal
1989 to fund the two programs. But until Feb. 15, the Pentagon
could spend no more than $250 million of the total amount on the MX
rail garrison.
   A compromise plan calls for converting the existing 50 MX
missiles from vulnerable silos to railroad cars and building 300 to
500 Midgetman missiles. Aspin said last week that to achieve a
bipartisan consensus in Congress both the MX and Midgetman should
be built.
   But the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services
Committee, Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, criticized the plan,
saying it would place unacceptable limits on defense programs. He
urged his GOP colleagues to vote against the Midgetman unless
Democrats agree to President Bush's request for an increase in
defense spending after fiscal 1990.
   Bush has proposed zero growth in fiscal 1990, 1 percent growth
in fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992 and 2 percent growth in fiscal 1993.
   Levin said he feared that the combination of MX and Midgetman
will win out.
   ``It's a very expensive thing to do ... I'm afraid that we'll
end up building both. Too often that's the way issues will be
solved,'' he said.
   The Michigan Democrat likened the situation to the decision to
build the B-1 bombers and move forward with the B-2 stealth bomber
after the B-52. Levin favored choosing the B-2 over the B-1.
   ``We've seen huge cost overruns ... as a result of doing
everything instead of making choices,'' Levin said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Release of Three Held In Right-Wing Kidnapping Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge, citing a lack of
evidence, has freed two former military officials and an
industrialist jailed three years ago in a highly publicized probe
into right-wing kidnappings.
   Judge Juan Hector Larios on Friday ordered the release of former
Lt. Rodolfo Lopez Sibrian, former Maj. Jose Alfredo Jimenez Moreno
and industrialist Orlando Llovera Ballete.
   Larios also canceled arrest warrants for five other people,
including a former army colonel.
   The judge declared null the acts of a military judge who in 1986
started the proceedings. The case was transferred to civilian court
in 1988 after it was ruled the crimes were not politically
motivated.
   Larrios said statements from witnesses on the kidnappings were
not reliable and that there was insufficient evidence to hold the
men.
   The government alleged that Llovera Ballete and Lopez Sibrian
posed as leftist guerrillas to capture five businessmen in exchange
for about $5 million between 1980 and 1985.
   The two were reported to be close friends of cashiered army Maj.
Roberto d'Aubuisson, founder of the ultra-conservative Republican
Nationalist Alliance. The party's candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, won
the March 16 presidential election.
   D'Aubuisson and his associates have been repeatedly linked to
right-wing death squads that ran rampant in the country in the
early 1980s. D'Aubuisson has denied the charges.
   When police agents captured Llovera Ballete and Lopez Sibrian in
March 1986, it was widely viewed as the start of a case that would
pit the administration of Christian Democrat President Jose
Napoleon Duarte against the conservative sectors of the military.
   Also implicated in the case were Oporto Tereson Roman, Moises
Lopez Arriola and detective Edgardo Sigfredo Linates, who all died
under suspicious circumstances in the following months.
   One was found hanged in his jail cell, another was shot when he
reportedly tried to escape police custody, and the other was gunned
down just outside El Salvador.
   Authorities said the three could have provided important
information in the case.
   Lopez Sibrian also was implicated in the 1981 murders of two
American land advisers _ Mark David Pearlman of Seattle and Michael
P. Hammer of Potomac, Md. _ and a Salvadoran agrarian reform
official.
   The charges against Lopez Sibrian, who was later dismissed from
the army, were dropped because of lack of evidence.
   Pearlman and Hammer were advising the government on a land
reform program that took thousands of acres from wealthy families
and distributed them to peasants.
   Five years later, two former army corporals were convicted in
the case. The U.S. government later maintained that the
``intellectual authors'' of the crime had not been brought to
justice.

<TEXT>
   Six years after the late Harold Washington
changed the course of Chicago politics, the movement that crowned
him mayor has fractured, jeopardizing the brief era of black
leadership he set up on City Hall's fifth floor.
   The likely benefactor of the split is Richard M. Daley, the
white, three-term Cook County prosecutor who unseated Mayor Eugene
Sawyer in the Democratic primary. He heads into Tuesday's election
with polls showing him a strong favorite to occupy the office his
political boss-father held for 21 years.
   But if Daley does in fact defeat third-party candidate Tim
Evans, the lone black in the race, and Republican Edward Vrdolyak,
he will have to work fast to consolidate his power in the nation's
third largest-city. Another election will be held in 1991, when
Washington's second term would have expired.
   ``One of the first things Washington faced _ and handled well _
was sending a message to the voters that didn't back him,'' said
top Daley campaign aide David Axelrod.
   ``He told people in the predominantly white communities that his
administration was going to be even-handed in distributing
services, in appointments and all facets of government ... then
went out and did those things.
   ``Rich Daley the candidate has said many of the same things. And
to do less than that, would not only be morally and ethically
bankrupt,'' Axelrod added, ``it would be politically suicidal.''
   If Daley were to model himself on Washington, he would in a
sense be continuing a tradition. Washington, the city's first black
mayor, learned more than a few of his political tricks from the
elder Daley.
   ``The old man liked to say `Good government is good politics and
good politics is good government,''' recalled Eugene Kennedy, a
Loyola University professor and author of ``Himself,'' a biography
of Richard J. Daley.
   That translated into providing basic services, which Washington
understood, Kennedy said.
   ``I'll never forget him walking in the (white) ethnic
neighborhoods, pointing out broken curbs, busted lights and such,
and telling people, `I'd fix this, but your alderman is blocking
the way,''' Kennedy added. ``Sheer genius.''
   But while Daley would have to reassure blacks that he intended
to treat them fairly, he might also have his hands full keeping his
white constituency happy.
   ``While everybody is wondering whether the black political
movement can be put back together, what's been overlooked is the
high price that loyalty will cost Daley if he wins,'' said Paul
Kleppner, a professor of political science at Northern Illinois
University and the author of ``Chicago Divided: The Making of a
Black Mayor.''
   ``He's got to keep his own troops in line, nurture the split
among blacks, and get some votes in the City Council,'' Kleppner
added. ``And nothing in Chicago politics comes cheap.''
   To be sure, however, the constraints on Tuesday's winner go
beyond the moral, the ethical and even the purely political.
   For one thing, Washington didn't so much dominate his City
Council opposition as outlast it.
   For the first three years of his first term, an anti-Washington
bloc of aldermen thwarted his legislative agenda at nearly every
turn. It was only after a court-ordered remap increased minority
representation in the council that Washington was able to put
together a working majority.
   Either Evans or Daley could command about 20 votes each in the
council, but Daley is more likely to succeed in twisting the arms
of the remaining 10 aldermen.
   Another factor limiting the new mayor will be the paucity of
spoils that can be handed out.
   During the six-term reign of Daley's father, the mayor exercised
control over 40,000 patronage jobs. Federal court rulings since the
1970s have prohibited most political hiring and firing, which means
the next mayor will have fewer than 1,000 jobs to dole out to his
army.
   And the mayor's control over another traditional source of
spoils _ contracts for city services and consultants' fees _ has
been limited by increasing council review powers and a set of
executive guidelines laid down by Washington that guarantee
minorities a representative share.
   But neither promises of fairness nor constraints assuage all the
fears in the black community.
   ``Nothing less than the future of blacks in politics in Chicago
is being threatened. I won't beat around the bush. I want a black
mayor,'' said Lu Palmer, the popular black radio commentator and
political activist.
   After months of avoiding the potentially explosive issue of
race, Evans wandered closer toward the minefield last week in hopes
of energizing black voters in a city where the voting population is
about 48 percent white against 42 percent black.
   ``Richard Daley is getting ready to reopen his father's
plantation,'' Evans, a South Side alderman, told a rally of 12,000
supporters gathered at the University of Illinois-Chicago early
last week.
   Sawyer lost the Feb. 28 primary in large part because many black
supporters of Evans stayed away from the polls. The two men had
become bitter rivals during the council fight to appoint a
temporary successor to Washington.
   As a result, Sawyer drew nearly 130,000 fewer votes in the
city's 19 predominantly black wards than Washington did in the 1987
primary. Sawyer lost to Daley by a margin of just over 100,000
votes.
   The most recent polls show Daley with about 50 percent support
and with a lead of between 14 and 21 points over Evans. Vrdolyak,
whose upstart, write-in candidacy a week before the primary won him
the GOP nomination, is mired at about 5 percent support and not
considered a factor.
   A Daley victory would make Chicago by far the biggest U.S. city
to replace black control of City Hall with white.
   ``To know that Richard Daley would finish out Harold's reign
would be unthinkable,'' said Palmer.
   ``But to know that blacks, on the very anniversary of Dr. King's
assassination, would be so immobilized that we can't get enough
people out on our own day to assure our freedom would show,'' he
added, ``that we get what we deserve.''

   A bookstore offering a deal on film
processing prompted Tim and Ruby Mixdorf to take in theirs _ all
108 rolls shot over 16 years.
   The Mixdorfs said that through the years they've had just enough
money to buy film, but never enough to pay for processing. They
just kept storing the film in bags in a closet.
   The Oregon State University Bookstore offered a special last
week of $1.99 for any number of exposures on a roll, compared with
the usual $4.99 for 24 exposures or $6.99 for 36.
   When the Mixdorfs took the pictures home, they reviewed nearly
two decades of family life with their teen-agers, Tim, 15, and
Patty, 13. The couple's favorite shots are of the kids as toddlers.
   ``It's really fun seeing them grow up again in the pictures,''
Mrs. Mixdorf said.
   Not all the photos were good, however.
   ``One entire roll of film was of the TV screen,'' Tim said.
``The kids must have gotten a hold of the camera.''

   The USS Okinawa, a Navy amphibious assault
ship that spent nine months here being overhauled, has been dubbed
the ``Love Boat'' by its sailors after 14 crew members were married
during the vessel's stay.
   ``Yes, Portland's a friendly town,'' said Petty Officer 3rd
Class Timothy Sibbel, a public affairs assistant.
   The warship left Swan Island Ship Repair Yards on Friday for San
Diego. The departure followed shipboard exchanges of plaques and
other mementos between business and civic leaders and ship's
officers. Meanwhile, sailors and their loved ones exchanged kisses
and hugs.
   ``Portland has been very good to us,'' said Capt. Andy J.
Murphy, commanding officer of the Okinawa. ``This community really
put itself out to take care of our crew and their families. Many
will leave their hearts here, and all of us will have some great
memories.''

   Anthony Moore's two-year commercial break
cost his father $1,000.
   The 14-year-old stopped watching television two years ago on a
$500 bet with his father. The initial plan called for the youth to
abstain for one year, but the boy doubled the stakes after winning
that bet to collect another $500.
   Moore, a freshman at Arthur L. Johnson Regional High School,
said the first three tubeless months were the hardest.
   ``At first, nobody thought I'd be able to do it,'' Moore said.
``When people heard I planned on giving up television for two
years, they really began to have their doubts.''
   Before his TV drought ended this weekend, Moore said he had
spent his last two years reading best sellers, playing sports,
lifting weights and going to the movies. But the bet failed in one
of its main objectives.
   ``My grades have actually gone down since I've given up my
television,'' Moore said. ``My dad can't figure it out.''

   Pinning down and correcting the cause of the
nation's worst oil spill may be as difficult as cleaning up after
it.
   The federal inquiry into why the Exxon Valdez ran aground in
Alaska's Prince William Sound is inhibited by the time it took to
get authorities onto the ship, delays in taking urine and blood
samples from key personnel, and the refusal of two top officers to
talk to investigators.
   Among important questions investigators have been unable to
answer:
   _Why the southbound ship, which had radioed the Coast Guard that
it was moving out of its own shipping lane to avoid an iceberg,
moved across both the separation lane and the northbound traffic
lane into a charted reef just after midnight March 24.
   _Why the third mate who was unqualified to pilot the 987-foot
tanker through the sound was put in charge while the captain, who
was qualified, had left the bridge.
   _Whether the captain, who was determined to be drinking 11 hours
after the accident, also was drinking when it occurred.
   The Coast Guard arrived 2{ hours after the vessel ran aground
and started spilling oil into the once pristine waters.
   Blood and urine tests of the ship's officers were not completed
until nearly 11 hours after the accident. And investigators from
the National Transportation Safety Board were not on board until
two full days after the ship ran aground.
   Coast Guard spokesman Capt. Randy Peterson in Washington said
the time it took to get Coast Guard officers to the ship appeared
to be reasonable given the late hour and the 25-mile distance to
the ship from Valdez.
   According to communications logs sent to Washington, the Coast
Guard received first word of the 12:04 a.m. (local time) accident
at 12:28 a.m. and within two minutes ordered Port Valdez closed to
all traffic and dispatched the commercial tug Stalwart to assist
the oil-spewing tanker.
   Coast Guard officers left Valdez for the ship at 1 a.m. and
arrived at about 2:30.
   Urine and blood tests of the captain, the third mate, the
helmsman and a lookout couldn't be conducted before qualified
personnel were available to conduct them, said Coast Guard
spokesman Rick Meidt in Valdez.
   Only the captain, Joseph Hazelwood, tested positive, with a .061
alcohol content in his blood. A level of .04 would disqualify him
from operating the ship.
   In most states, an auto driver is considered drunk only at a
substantially higher blood alcohol content _ typically .10 or
higher.
   For an average-size man, the consumption of one beer within an
hour of the test likely would show up at about the .03-to-.04
level, meaning a person has to drink three or more beers or
equivalent drinks in most states to be considered legally drunk for
the purposes of driving a motor vehicle.
   Board spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said investgators have no
way of detecting from blood tests whether Hazelwood was drunk or
even drinking at the time of the collision.
   They determined, based on interviews with other crew members,
that Hazelwood had turned over the bridge to his third mate,
Gregory Cousins.
   But they have not been able to tell whether Hazelwood's blood
alcohol level was due to drinking before or after the accident. If
the test result stemmed from drinking prior to the accident, he
would have had a higher count if tested within minutes after the
ship ran aground.
   On Thursday, Exxon fired Hazelwood, citing violation of company
rules that prohibit alcohol on board company ships.
   But Ms. Andersen, in a telephone interview from Valdez, said
investigators had been unable to determine whether Hazelwood or
anyone actually had alcohol on board.
   ``By the time we got there Sunday morning, Exxon officials had
moved into the captain's cabin to set up a crisis command, and any
evidence that was there would have been of no use,'' she said.
   Both Hazelwood and Cousins have refused to talk on the advice of
lawyers, she said. The Coast Guard and civilian authorities have
said they are considering action against them.
   Ms. Andersen said the board could subpoena the men but
investigators could not provide them with any immunity without
approval of the full five-member safety board and the Justice
Department.
   She said both men had tried to make a deal that would protect
them from prosecution early in the investigation.
   The safety board has no power to bring charges or compel actions
but only determines the probable cause of an accident and
recommends steps to prevent future accidents involving shipping,
aviation or ground transportation.
   Ms. Andersen said the board expected to complete its field
investigation early this week, after several more interviews and an
examination of ship personnel records to determine the competence
of its officers and crew.
   In addition to cause of the accident, the board also is looking
at initial response to the spill and will assess the Coast Guard's
monitoring of traffic in the port ``to make the passage of vessels
to and from port as safe from human error as possible.''
   Ms. Andersen said the tanker had received Coast Guard permission
to go around the ice, but there was no indication of Coast Guard
error in directives given to the ship.
   A civilian worker in a Coast Guard radar room in Valdez where
the tanker was being monitored had a blood-alcohol level of 0.20
when he was tested 15 hours after the accident. But Ms. Andersen
said the worker, Bruce Blandford, had come on duty only a few
minutes before the accident and said he drank only after getting
off work 12 hours later.

   Syrian forces fired shells at a key power
plant in the Christian heartland Saturday, and artillery and rocket
duels with Christian troops raged on despite a U.N. cease-fire call.
   Police said one person died and 12 were wounded.
   Firefighters controlled a blaze at a fuel depot hit by rockets
in Christian east Beirut last week, and 150,000 evacuees were told
they could return home. But radio stations often interrupted
programming with warnings to residents to stay in bomb shelters.
   Christian sources said the Syrians were planning to escalate the
fighting and had brought in from Damascus new artillery and rocket
batteries. They accused the Syrians of seeking to demolish key
public utilities in the besieged 310-square-mile Christian enclave,
which includes east Beirut and nearby communities northeast of the
city.
   At least 130 people have died and 421 have been wounded in the
latest round of battles in the 14-year civil war.
   The fighting erupted March 8 after Christian army commander Gen.
Michel Aoun tried to blockade militia-run ports that deprive the
government of revenue.
   Aoun also heads a Christian Cabinet, opposed by a rival Moslem
Cabinet backed by Syria.
   Voice of Lebanon, the Christians' main radio station, said
Syrian gunners ``intentionally ignored'' Friday's cease-fire plea
by the U.N. Security Council.
   Voice of the Nation, Moslem west Beirut's most popular station,
said: ``All attempts to arrange a cease-fire have failed. Civilians
have no option but to remain huddled in basements.''
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules,
said Syrian army gunners pounded the Christian heartland with
howitzers and multi-barreled rocket launchers throughout the day.
   He said Aoun's 20,000-strong army retaliated by firing 155mm
howitzer shells into Syrian-policed west Beirut, Druse-held
mountains southeast of the capital and east Lebanon's Bekaa valley.
   A Christian military source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said several Syrian-fired 180mm howitzer shells exploded around the
main power station in the Christian suburb of Zouk, north of Beirut
before dawn.
   A fire at a fuel depot in Beirut's Christian district of Dora
caused by Syrian shelling was ``fizzling out,'' according to Elie
Honein, manager of the Civil Defense department.
   The fire began when a shell hit the depot Monday. A large butane
gas explosion Thursday was set off by another shell.
   Honein said the estimated 150,000 people who evacuated the
densely populated district could return to their homes.
   The U.N. Security Council's president, Ambassador Absa Claude
Diallo of Senegal, made a cease-fire appeal Friday. The Arab League
on Tuesday called for a truce, and a Aoun declared a unilateral
cease-fire declaration on Wednesday.
   The political crisis in Lebanon had been escalating since Sept.
22, when President Amin Gemayel named Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, to
head an interim Cabinet after Parliament failed to elect a new
president.
   Moslems rejected the appointment which violated a national
covenant under which presidents are Maronite Catholics, premiers
Sunnis and house speakers Shiite Moslems.
   They pledged allegiance to Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who now
heads the rival Moslem Cabinet.

   Cleveland Bailey went out of town
for two weeks and when he returned home, it wasn't there.
   Bailey arrived Thursday just moments after a city contractor's
bulldozer had leveled his house. Only rich, dark soil remains.
   ``It appears the city made a mistake,'' said Mayor Patrick Henry
Hays, who apologized and asked Bailey to itemize his losses.
Counting the house, furniture, clothes and appliances, Bailey
figures he lost $50,000.
   ``I ain't got nothing now,'' he said.
   The right house had been razed, but the city notified the wrong
person of the impending demolition, Hays said.
   City Inspector Elmo Smith condemned the home last year and the
City Council authorized the razing if the owner failed to bring it
up to building standards. Bailey found the condemned sign and
bought a permit to put his house in shape. He had planned to spend
$5,000 on a new roof and other repairs.
   When the city sent out condemnation notices, it obtained the
wrong name for the owner of the house and Bailey never received
notice that the city planned to tear it down.
   So he was surprised when he returned home.
   ``I thought the mayor or somebody had gone loco,'' Bailey said.
``I got nowhere to stay. I got to rent me a house.''

<HEAD>North Strategy Appears Unchanged Despite Ruling on Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With former President Reagan ruled out as a
witness, Oliver North's lawyers must look for other ways to show
that his superiors authorized his actions in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The defense begins presenting its case Monday at North's trial
on charges ranging from lying to Congress to receiving an illegal
gratuity.
   While prosecutors were presenting their side over the last six
weeks, North's lawyers brought out a number of secret actions taken
by Reagan while in the White House on behalf of the Contra rebels
fighting to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   But that failed to persuade U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell that Reagan should be called to the stand as requested by
North's lawyers.
   On Friday, Gesell declared that ``the trial record presently
contains no proof that defendant North ever received any
authorization from President Reaan to engage in the illegal conduct
alleged, either directly or indirectly, orally or in writing.''
   That represented a blow to North's strategy but is not expected
to deter his lawyers from focusing on Reagan.
   They still may draw on secrets contained in a 44-page admission
by the government, outlining the administration's inducements to
other countries in exchange for help to the Contras.
   In addition, they are expected to zero in on exhibits already
presented at the trial suggesting authorization.
   For example, after North denied in an Aug. 6, 1986, meeting with
the House Intelligence Committee that he was aiding the Contras,
then-national security adviser John Poindexter wrote his
subordinate: ``Well done.'' North now is accused of obstructing
Congress in connection with the meeting.
   The defense subpoenaed Poindexter, a co-defendant in the
Iran-Contra case who will be tried separately from North later this
year. Asserting his constitutional rights, Poindexter is declining
to appear.
   In his absence, North's lawyers want to show several hours of
televised testimony Poindexter gave on Capitol Hill in 1987 during
the congressional Iran-Contra hearings.
   Poindexter testified that his one regret was that he didn't
follow up personally after North reported a threat on his life by
terrorist Abu Nidal. Part of North's defense to the charge of
accepting an illegal gratuity, a home security system, is that he
feared for his family's safety and that the government wouldn't pay
for a security system.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh opposes
introducing the Poindexter videotape.
   The problem with focusing on Reagan is that North's lawyers have
been unable to place him at the scene of any of the alleged crimes.
The closest brush to date involving the president came in the
testimony of former national security adviser Robert McFarlane.
   McFarlane said he had talked with Reagan in the Oval Office
about congressional inquiries before sending letters to Congress in
September 1985 which denied North was assisting the Contras.
McFarlane later pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in connection with
the letters, which North is accused of preparing and for which he
is now charged with felonies.
   McFarlane testified that he got no guidance from Reagan on what
to say in the letters, but North's lawyers said they needed to
question the president about the matter.
   North's lawyers also tried to show a pattern of concealment from
Congress.
   It was disclosed that Reagan, who told the Tower Commission in
1987 he didn't know about National Security Council involvement
with the Contras, followed through on recommendations from the NSC
staff to help the rebels.
   During a two-year congressional ban on Contra aid, Reagan signed
off on a secret plan to provide $110 million in extra aid to entice
Honduras to support the Contras.
   In response to a memo from McFarlane, Reagan also telephoned the
president of Honduras to get a military shipment destined for the
Contras released. It had been seized earlier in the day by the
Honduran military.
   Testimony at North's trial also shows that Reagan also
apparently approved a secret airdrop of recoilless rifles and other
items to the Contras. The rifles were to be used to destroy two
arms-bearing ships headed for Nicaragua.
   McFarlane testified that when he told Reagan of a Saudi Arabian
government contribution to the Contras, ``he made clear to me that
no one should know and let's keep it that way.''

   Police arrested about 80 Tibetan youths
who tried to enter the Chinese Embassy during a demonstration
Saturday against Chinese rule in Tibet.
   The demonstrators from the Tibetan Youth Congress marched to New
Delhi from cities across India and gathered in front of the embassy
before trying to scale the main gate and enter the compound.
   Riot police used truncheons to beat back the protesters and
bundled the youths, shouting anti-Chinese slogans, into police vans.
   Earlier Saturday, the group urged Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to
speak out against ``the ruthless suppression of the Tibetan people
by the Chinese colonial forces.''
   Clashes broke out last month in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa
between Chinese police and Tibetans demanding independence.
According to Chinese officials, 16 people died, but Western
travelers say the death toll was closer to 30.
   The protests began a few days before the 30th anniversary of a
failed uprising in Tibet. The Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal
ruler of the Tibetans, fled to India on March 31, 1959, three weeks
after the uprising.
   He set up his headquarters and a government-in-exile in the
northern Indian city of Dharmsala, where he supervises the welfare
of about 100,000 other Tibetans in exile in this country.

   Moslem countries are building up
long-range missile arsenals in the Middle East, including systems
capable of carrying nuclear and chemical warheads to Israel,
military analysts say.
   Four Arab countries _ Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia _ now
possess missiles capable of hitting targets in Israel. All except
Saudi Arabia are capable of producing their own chemical weapons,
analysts and diplomats say.
   Jane's Defense Weekly said last week the Middle East missile
race is eroding Israel's traditional aerial supremacy and could
``dramatically change the balance of power'' in the region.
   Jane's said that in addition to the four Arab countries that
have missiles, Libya is ``rushing to catch up.''
   At a time of East-West detente and arms reductions, military
developments in the Middle East have rung alarm bells in Washington
and Moscow.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned recently
of a Middle East arms race that ``sooner or later would degenerate
into a nuclear face-off.''
   Arab states in the region are pressing ahead with major arms
programs costing billions of dollars, but analysts do not believe
the missile spread has reached a critical stage yet.
   ``The real question is what kind of warheads these missiles are
going to carry. High explosive and chemical warheads basically
cause very localized damage,'' said Don Kerr of the London-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   Kerr said the countries do not have enough missiles to ensure
that they could hit all targets and prevent retaliation.
   Saudi Arabia disclosed last year it has acquired Chinese-made
DF-3A ballistic missiles. They have a range of 1,600 miles and can
carry a 1.3-megaton nuclear weapon or a warhead containing 4,500
pounds of high explosive.
   The Saudis insist the missiles, the most powerful in the region,
will only carry conventional warheads. Intended primarily as
defense against Iran, the missiles can also easily reach Israeli
targets.
   Missile warfare in the region started during the 1973
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   The Iran-Iraq war spurred the spread of missile acquisition. The
use of outlawed chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq conflict made the
Israelis more aware than ever of the nightmare they faced in any
new Middle East conflict.
   Iran, Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Libya have Soviet Scud-B
surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 180 miles.
   Syria, Israel's main Arab foe, has more than 100 Scud-Bs. It
also has an estimated 36 of the more accurate and powerful Soviet
SS-21 Scarab tactical missiles, which have a range of 120 miles and
are capable of carrying chemical warheads. These can reach key
Israeli targets.
   The Syrians also have Soviet-built SS-C-1 Sepal and SS-C-3
anti-ship missiles.
   Iran has some Chinese-made Silkworm surface-to-ship missiles and
appears determined to build a missile arsenal to match Iraq's
efforts.
   Israel has long held the offensive edge in the volatile Middle
East through its vaunted air force, and it is widely believed to
have built up a stock of nuclear weapons.
   The superpowers' influence in restricting access to missile
technology has been undercut by the emergence of sophisticated arms
industries in South America and the Middle East.
   Argentina, Brazil and China have become major arms exporters.
Egypt and Israel are the main producers in the Middle East, but
Iraq and Iran are building up their own defense industries, even
though their technological capabilities are still limited.
   Iraq and Egypt are working with Argentina to develop the
Badr-2000 missile with a 620-mile range and a warhead that can
contain explosives, a nuclear device or poison gas.
   Libya is reported to be negotiating with Brazil to buy Oteiba
MB@EE-600 missiles with a range of 375 miles, enough to hit Israeli
targets.
   The Israelis are believed to be seeking to counter the growing
threat by developing missile systems to either knock out Arab and
Iranian missile sites in preemptive strikes or destroy incoming
missiles in the air.
   The Washington Post reported Friday that some Israeli sources
believe Iraq has a program to build nuclear warheads for use with
missiles.
   Analysts say that so far the arsenal is limited, both in
quantity and quality, although they noted that any large-scale
acquisitions, particularly by Libya, Iraq and Iran, would cause
alarm.
   Kerr said: ``For the time being, these weapons are being sought
by people for essentially defensive purposes. These states want to
be listened to.''
   The key question is whether Arab states or Iran ever achieve
nuclear weapons status. Most analysts believe that prospect is
still distant.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has called for an Arab nuclear
capability and Iraq and Iran have nuclear reactors or are building
them.
   ``The Arabs worry about Israel as an advanced and dangerous
outsider in the region,'' Kerr said.
   But he said they are wary of missile encounters with Israel,
which has its own nuclear-capable Jericho-1 weapon, with an
estimated range of up to 370 miles, and has tested an advanced
version with a reputed range of more than 1,000 miles.
   ``Arab states know that if they started firing missiles at
Israel, they run the risk of nuclear retaliation,'' he said.

   State authorities filed criminal charges
against a tanker captain accusing him of operating his ship under
the influence of alcohol, while the nation's worst oil spill spread
into the Gulf of Alaska.
   Exxon fired Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood on Thursday, the
same day the National Transportation Safety Board revealed blood
and urine tests taken about nine hours after the accident showed he
had been drinking.
   On Friday, the state charged Hazelwood with three misdemeanors
and issued a warrant for his arrest, Alaska Attorney General Doug
Baily said today.
   Hazelwood, 42, was charged with operating a motorcraft while
under the influence, reckless endangerment and the negligent
discharge of oil.
   The three offenses carry combined maximum sentences of two years
and three months, and fines totaling up to $10,000. If convicted,
Hazelwood would have to spend at least 30 days in jail because he
has two prior drunken driving convictions in the past five years,
Baily said.
   Magistrate Tracee Schnell signed the arrest warrant for
Hazelwood, and set bond at $50,000. Authorities believe Hazelwood
left the state several days ago, but Baily said the state would
seek his extradition.
   In Washington, the FBI said Friday it is looking at possible
felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the
``negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable waters.'' The
state is also investigating.
   The 240,000 barrels of oil that spewed into Prince William Sound
a week ago from the Exxon Valdez has now tainted more than 1,000
square miles of water. Norwegian environmental specialists were en
route to advise cleanup crews, and wildlife officials feared taht
the number of oil-slicked birds and sea animals would overwhelm a
local recovery center.
   The iridescent slick began seeping into the Gulf of Alaska
Friday, threatening additional fishing communities and a 600-mile
stretch of coastline that includes a national park.
   Workers at the Kenai Fjords National Park hustled to protect
fertile salmon streams draining Alaska's rocky underbelly.
   ``We expect the windward side of our boundary ... to be
slimed,'' said park Superintendent Anne Costellina. ``There's not a
lot we can do about it.''
   Ten sea otters and 27 oiled birds were taken to Valdez for
cleaning, and federal wildlife experts said more than 1,000 tainted
birds _ some alive, some dead _ had been spotted on a single island.
   Workers in Valdez hurried to build cages for an expected flood
of oil-soaked otters at a wildlife recovery and rehabilitation
center set up at Prince William Sound Community College. But
officials expressed concerned that the center couldn't handle a
burgeoning number of oil-soaked animals.
   ``A thousand oiled live and dead birds in the whole scheme of
things probably is not that significant,'' said Everett
Robinson-Wilson of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``But that's
only one place in the sound. There may be many other places in the
sound that bad that people haven't gotten to yet.''
   The Alaska Department of Fish and Game estimated the sound's
otter population at 4,000 to 5,000 and said the otter is the area's
most plentiful marine mammal. Other marine mammals found in the
sound year-round include sea lions, harbor seals, porpoises and
killer whales.
   Meanwhile, the mayor of this picturesque coastal community said
Friday the ruptured tanker should be repaired elsewhere to prevent
further contamination.
   Also Friday, angry residents, many of them fishermen who depend
on the sea for their livelihoods, disrupted Exxon's daily news
briefing, demanding to know why the company that owns the tanker is
not hiring them for the cleanup work.
   A sablefish harvest set to open today was canceled because of
the spill.
   Gov. Steve Cowper's office announced that the Soviet Union is
planning to send a skimming ship next week to help in the cleanup.
   The Coast Guard said the disabled Exxon Valdez no longer was
leaking oil, but it could do so again when the vessel is moved.
   Although about two-thirds of the 1 million barrels of oil that
remained aboard have been removed, the ship could be carrying up to
50,000 barrels of oil and up to 600,000 barrels of oily bilge water
when refloating is tried, possibly Wednesday, Exxon officials said.
   Valdez has the area's only port capable of handling the 987-foot
ship that has been impaled on a reef 25 miles away since March 24.
   ``If they bring that tanker in here leaking oil, then we're
going to have oil in Valdez Bay,'' Mayor John Devens said, adding
that ducks, geese, wetlands and a fish hatchery could be threatened.
   Devens criticized Exxon for not hiring townspeople to help in
the cleanup and accused the company of pressuring residents ``to
settle their claims hurriedly.''
   The company said that it had established an emergency assistance
fund, and that users were not precluded from making future claims.
   The outburst at Friday's news conference broke up the briefing
as security guards struggled with environmentalists trying to force
their way in.
   The audience kept interrupting the proceedings with shouted
questions and accusations.
   Before the session disintegrated into chaos, Exxon spokesman Don
Cornett denied a reporter's suggestion that the spill has gotten
out of control and the cleanup has been a failure.
   ``Absolutely not, it has not gotten away from us,'' Cornett
insisted. ``We are making good progress on this cleanup.''
   But he said later that only 300,000 of the more than 10 million
gallons of oil spilled have been recovered.
   Exxon Shipping President Frank Iarossi said that ``most skimming
equipment is inefficient'' because of the changing consistency of
the oil, which he likened to ``black mayonnaise.''

<HEAD>EDs: Top 6 grafs new to update with Fitzwater comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush urged the president of
Venezuela today to press ahead with his nation's economic reforms
as the administration pushed its new plan to curb social and
economic tensions over the Third World debt crisis.
   Bush's White House breakfast session with Carlos Andres Perez,
was ``very productive,'' said White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   They were joined in their 1{-hour meeting by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft, White House chief of staff John
Sununu, Vice President Dan Quayle, National Security Council aide
Bob Pastorino and Bernie Aronson, assistant secretary of
state-designate.
   The group dicussed the debt crisis plaguing Venezuela and other
Third World countries and Perez described the economic reforms
underway in his coiuntry, said Fitzwater. Bush ``encouraged them to
continue with the reform effort,'' he added.
   They also talked about the administration's new plan to aid the
Contras in the efforts to bring about peace in Nicaragua.
   Bush told Perez that he wants to keep diplomatic pressure on
Nicaragua's ruling Sandinistas to implement democratic reforms, and
he asked Perez's support for that effort, Fitzwater said. The
spokesman said he had no further details of the meeting.
   The meeting came as the administration was looking to the spring
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
starting this weekend here, for approval of its new plan to help
Third World nations ease their crushing $1.3 trillion debt burden.
   Perez has come to Washington for the sessions, which are
attended by the finance ministers and other influential officials
of the twin international lending organizations' 151 member nations.
   In the 7-year-old crisis, the burden of paying interest on $1.3
trillion that developing nations owe has sapped their economies,
lowered living standards and led to growing political and economic
unrest.
   Perez, Venezuela's new president, blamed riots in his country
last month that claimed 270 lives on ``intolerable and obscene''
debt repayment terms imposed by creditors. He called on wealthier
nations to do more to relieve the debt burden.
   Critics have complained that the administration plan _ named for
Brady _ has raised unreasonable expectations for debt relief in
Latin America and may end up fomenting political instability
instead of helping relieve tensions.
   A senior Treasury official who asked not to be named said the
administration saw Perez as vital to selling the debt-reduction
process.
   ``He views himself as a leader in Latin America,'' the official
said. ``Here is a president with the blood of nearly 300 people to
deal with, and he's pretty courageous to stand by his economic
reforms.''
   A second Treasury official said, ``If we get support on the debt
program from Perez ... I think it will be a success.''
   Preliminary discussions began on Friday with a meeting of
finance officials representing debtor countries. On Sunday, Brady
is hosting daylong discussions with the finance ministers and
central bank presidents of the world's largest industrial
countries. The U.S. debt plan is expected to be the principal topic
on the agenda.
   These talks, involving the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Canada and Italy, will take place at River Farm,
an estate along the Potomac River which once belonged to George
Washington.
   The administration is looking for an endorsement of the new
strategy so that the major creditor countries will present a united
front when the Brady plan is taken up at the Monday and Tuesday
sessions of the IMF and World Bank.
   Under the Brady plan, commercial banks would be asked to forgive
voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to poor nations.
In return, the IMF and World Bank would provide assurances that the
remaining debt would be repaid.
   The administration has estimated that over the next three years
its proposals could result in wiping out about $70 billion of the
$340 billion in debt owed by 39 developing nations, a group which
includes all of the largest debtors and many of the smaller ones.
   The IMF and World Bank would be expected to contribute about $12
billion each over three years to spur the debt reduction effort.
The United States is also looking to Japan, and other countries
which are running large trade surpluses, to recycle some of that
money into debt relief. Japan is expected to contribute between $5
billion and $10 billion.

<HEAD>Iran Restarts Big Abadan Refinery After 8-Year Wartime Shutdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran resumed partial operations Saturday
at its war-battered Abadan oil refinery after an eight-year
shutdown during the war with Iraq, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
   Since the Aug. 20 cease-fire, 7,000 technicians and specialists
have worked round-the-clock to rebuild the 3,200-acre complex, IRNA
said.
   Abadan, only a few miles from the Iraqi border and within sight
of Iraqi artillery throughout the war, was knocked out early in the
conflict that began in September 1980.
   It was shelled almost daily, and 158 refinery personnel were
killed in the fighting. The cost of the damage and lost production
was estimated at more than $9 billion.
   President Ali Khamenei inaugurated the newly built Abadan plant
in southwest Khuzestan province, IRNA said in a dispatch monitored
in Nicosia.
   He told the technicians who rebuilt a 20-megawatt power plant,
distillation towers, storage tanks and other facilities from the
twisted ruins: ``You ... have proved that the Iranian nation, by
relying on itself, can emerge as a wonderful power.''
   The 70-year-old refinery will start with a daily production
capacity of 130,000 barrels a day, one-fifth of its pre-war
capacity, IRNA said.
   But Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, who accompanied Khamenei,
was quoted as saying production will be boosted over the next two
to three years to 360,000 barrels daily.
   The reopening of the Abadan complex came amid a major effort by
the Iranians to rebuild their battered oil industry and their
refineries, which were heavily bombed by Iraq's powerful air force
throughout the war.
   Abadan's output will boost Iran's refinery capacity to an
estimated 850,000 barrels a day. Six other refineries have been
repaired since the cease-fire.
   Most are operating 25 percent above their designated capacities
to boost production of refined products such as fuel oil and
kerosene.
   Oil industry experts consider the speed with which the Iranians
have restored their oil installations since the cease-fire to be a
major development.
   Ian Seymour, editor of the respected Nicosia-based Middle East
Economic Survey who visited Iranian oil installations a few weeks
ago, noted that the reconstruction was ``a considerable
achievement.''
   Iran's crude oil exports are the mainstay of its economy and
account for some 90 percent of its foreign currency earnings.

   Thai pirates massacred 45
Vietnamese refugees sailing in the South China Sea and kidnapped
about 11 women on the boat, officials on Saturday quoted two
survivors as saying.
   The pirates slashed the passengers with knives and threw them
overboard before running their boat over the floating bodies to
make sure no one was alive, they said.
   An old man and young boy were the only survivors of the attack
that occurred within the past week, said the officials, who work
with refugees and who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
   The two hid under planks floating in the water, and their boat
later drifted to an Esso Oil Co. rig in the South China Sea off the
Trengganu coast of Malaysia, the officials said. The company is a
subsidiary of Exxon.
   Workers picked up the two Monday and sent them to the Malaysian
government hospital in Kuala Trengganu, 180 miles northeast of
Kuala Lumpur.
   ``This is one of the worst cases of piracy reported in recent
years, and the pirates nowadays kill the people after plundering
the boats so that there would be no witnesses,'' said a senior
refugee official.
   The refugee officials said the two survivors did not give a full
account of their experience. They did not say exactly when the
attack took place or how many pirates took part. There was no word
on the fate of the kidnapped women.
   ``The women are normally raped and either killed and dumped into
the sea or abandoned in remote islands,'' said another refugee
official.
   In January, refugee officials said two Vietnamese women were
raped and dumped on a remote Thai island before arriving at the
camp. The women reported that 26 people in their boat were killed
by Thai pirates late last year.
   The government reported that in March, about 2,000 Vietnamese
refugees landed on Malaysian shores, almost double the average for
the past few months. There are now about 16,500 Vienamese boat
people in Malaysia.
   Malaysia and the nations of the region accept the refugees only
for temporary stay pending permanent settlement in the West.

   The interior minister said Saturday the
death toll from torrential rains and floods that began last month
has reached 18.
   Saleh al-Seyali also said 40 people have been injured and 2,186
houses and 53 government facilities destroyed.
   The floods inundated 12,634 acres of land and 309 wells and
canals, drowning 2,715 animals, said Al-Seyali, who is in charge of
a special committee overseeing emergency relief work.
   Flash floods, a common occurrence in the southern parts of the
Arabian Peninsula this time of the year, have taken on disaster
proportions in South Yemen since March 19.
   A week ago, reports reaching the capital put the death toll at
13. The floods have been intermittent and there was a fresh
outburst Saturday.
   Helicopters were dropping food and medical supplies to thousands
of people rendered homeless or cut off by blocked roads.
   South Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Third World,
has launched an international appeal for help. King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia made a personal donation of $8 million.

   Moslem guerrillas, bolstered by newly
arrived reinforcements, intensified their rocket and artillery
attacks on the government-held city of Jalalabad, the Foreign
Ministry said Saturday.
   Guerrilla bombardments on Thursday and Friday killed 69
civilians and wounded 123, the government said.
   It was one of the highest civilian death tolls reported since
the U.S.-backed guerrillas launched their offensive March 6 in an
effort to oust government troops from the city 75 miles east of
Kabul.
   The siege began less than three weeks after the last Soviet
troops withdrew from Afghanistan after nine years of support for
successive regimes in Kabul.
   Mohammad Nabi Amani, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry,
reported eight deaths and 27 injuries among government troops and
said 109 opposition fighters were killed and 70 wounded.
   Most of the figures could not be verified, but members of the
Sikh religious minority who arrived in Kabul on Saturday said 22
people were killed Thursday in a Sikh Gurdwara, or temple, in
Jalalabad.
   They said hundreds of people had taken refuge in the Gurdwara as
rocket and shell fire intensified, and they said few people were
venturing outside.
   Amani said 12,000 to 14,000 opposition fighters, including what
he said were ``Pakistani militiamen in Afghan costume,'' were
attacking Jalalabad early in the week and an additional 3,500 men
had joined them by Saturday. He said the new fighters came from
Paktia and Paktika provinces, which are southwest of Nangarhar
province where Jalalabad is located.
   He did not say how many government soldiers were defending the
city.
   The government spokesman said the opposition on Thursday fired
16,000 shells and rockets at Jalalabad and that 2,500 of them fell
in residential areas and destroyed 13 houses.
   On Friday, he said, 900 more rockets and shells hit residential
aras, destroying 43 houses. He did not give a total number of
rounds fired on all targets Friday.
   Amani also read a Foreign Ministry statement accusing the
British foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, of trying to reimpose
British colonialism on Afghanistan through its support for the
Moslem insurgency.
   Howe met Moslem guerrilla leaders in Pakistan last week.
   In India on Friday, he said only a broad-based Afghan government
will bring peace. He said he found the guerrilla leaders were
willing ``to work for a government that will command a wide
acceptance inside the country.'' But he said such a government must
not be imposed on the Afghan people.
   On Feb. 23, the guerrillas met in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and
elected a provisional government they hope will replace President
Najib and his Soviet-style People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Thousands of people have fled Jalalabad since the fighting
started, and the Kabul government says it does not know how many
remain in the city.
   Jalalabad had a population of 200,000 a decade ago, but it
generally was thought to have shrunk to less than half that number
before the guerrilla offensive started. The city is key for the
insurgents, for it would give them a base on Afghan soil to set up
their provisional government.

   The therapist credited by the Beach Boys'
Brian Wilson for his recovery from drug abuse has been banned from
practicing psychology in California for at least two years, state
officials said.
   Eugene Landy surrendered his license last week to the state
Board of Medical Quality Assurance, said Suzanne Taylor, the
board's management services technician.
   Landy, 54, has worked off and on since the mid-1970s with
Wilson, who for years was the creative force behind the Beach Boys.
The group is noted for such hit songs in the 1960s as ``California
Girls'' and ``Surfin' USA.''
   The psychologist, who had been accused of sexual misconduct with
a female patient, gross negligence and other charges brought before
the board, admitted to a single charge of unlawfully prescribing
drugs to Wilson, the Los Angeles Times said in Saturday's editions.
   Landy and Wilson, who are vacationing in Hawaii, could not
immediately be reached for comment.
   Wilson, who was overweight, reclusive and by his own admission
had drug problems for several years, has said Landy's treatments
allowed him to recover his health and return to the recording
studio. His first solo album, released last year, won wide critical
acclaim.
   ``Dr. Landy saved my life,'' Wilson said last June.
   But in their complaint against Landy last year, state
authorities said Landy's relationship with Wilson caused the singer
``severe emotional damage, psychological dependence and financial
exploitation.''
   Landy, who holds a doctorate in psychology from the University
of Oklahoma, calls his methods ``24-hour therapy,'' in which a
therapist attempts to control every aspect of his patient's life.

   Author William F. Buckley Jr. and fellow voyagers
who paid $39,000 per ticket left Saturday on a supersonic trip
around the world.
   Buckley is leading the 38,343-mile, 22-day trip aboard a British
Airways Concorde jet, with supersonic hops alternating with
stopovers in New York; Acapulco, Mexico; Sri Lanka; Tahiti;
Australia and other points, said airline spokesman Ken Cook.
   Concordes have circled the globe before but not using supersonic
speeds for each leg or for that distance, Cook said. He said the
jet could break more than a dozen speed records, but he did not
name them.
   During the trip, Buckley planned to broadcast his television
show ``Firing Line'' from Cape Town, South Africa, and Sydney,
Australia, Cook said.
   Cook said a Miami-based travel agency, Lorraine Travel Bureau,
chartered the jet for the tour and that all 100 seats for the trip
had been sold out, although not everyone was starting in London.
Most passengers were scheduled to leave from New York.
   The $39,000 ticket price _ per person, double occupancy, as they
say _ included all hotels and meals as well as extras such as a
safari in Africa and cruises in Tahiti, Acapulco and New Zealand.

chief executive who acknowledges a fondness for good home cooking,
says he may be heavy, but he's also healthy.
   Witness his enviable performance on a cholesterol test at the
state Capitol, where hospital workers were checking volunteers as
part of a citywide cholesterol screening campaign.
   McWherter's cholesterol level _ at 130 _ was one of the lowest
checked at the Capitol and well below the ``borderline'' level 200
and the high level of 240, workers said.
   ``I'm healthy as a horse,'' the 250-plus-pound governor said
following Thursday's finger-pricking session. ``I'm just a little

   McWherter, 58, said he tries to eat a balanced diet including
meat, cabbage and melon.
   Asked to name his favorite food, McWherter laughed and replied,
``Kellogg's cereal,'' an apparent reference to the company's recent
announcement to add a $1 million addition to its Memphis plant.

   The Princess of Wales slipped out of a London
hospital on Saturday, eluding the massed photographers outside, and
hurried home to Kensington Palace to recuperate from the removal of
four wisdom teeth.
   The day after the surgery at the King Edward VII Hospital for
Officers, Diana left by a side exit and sent her dresser Evelyn
Dagley to the front door to play out an elborate charade in front
of the press.
   Miss Dagley went in and out of the hospital laboriously laden
with red suitcases, a cardboard box, a holdall and several
bouquets, while the 27-year-old princess headed for the palace to
nurse her tender jaw in the privacy of her own home.
   The 1{-hour operation to remove the impacted teeth was carried
out under general anesthetic and went without complication, the
hospital said.
   Diana is to resume her duties Tuesday at a charity luncheon.
   Her husband Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, took

   Changes in ownership and coaching in
the Dallas Cowboys franchise have met with some resistance from the
public, but Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White said he expects
a turnaround.
   ``So far, it's been kind of rocky,'' said White, who spoke to
450 students, faculty and fans at Garden City Community College on
Friday.
   In February, the Cowboys franchise changed hands from Bum Bright
to Arkansas oilman Jerry Jones, and the coaching reins were handed
from legendary Tom Landry to former Miami University coach Jimmy
Johnson.
   ``The people in Dallas don't like being told what they're going
to do,'' he said. ``Here were these two guys coming in, one from
Arkansas and one from Florida, and kicking our good ol' boys out of
town, saying we don't want you anymore after 29 years.''
   White believes the public's opinion of the new ownership will
change. ``When people get to know them, they're going to fall in
love with them. They're great people.''

   Congress is under mounting pressure to swiftly
pass President Bush's proposal to rescue the savings and loan
industry, but a dispute over accounting artistry threatens to knock
the plan off the fast track.
   The House and Senate banking committees, after six weeks of
hearings, begin writing their own versions of S&amp;L legislation this
week.
   Democrats on the House panel are meeting privately Tuesday in
preparation for public drafting sessions beginning two days later.
Senators are also gathering behind closed doors this week, before
starting open meetings April 13.
   ``I expect to see (the Bush proposal) adopted without major
surgery ... (and) on the president's desk by May,'' said consultant
William Issac, a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.
   Quick movement is nearly unprecedented for a major piece of

$35 billion from November through February _ and members of
Congress are afraid to risk further deterioration.
   S&amp;L regulators at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board say the huge
withdrawals are not abnormal when interest rates rise and mutual
funds and other competitors offer investors a better return.
   However, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and the White
House budget director, Richard Darman, are telling Congress that
depositors are nervous because the president's plan isn't in place.
   Brady used several speeches last week _ in Dallas, New York and
Washington _ to press the administration claim that ``we will
continue to see withdrawals as long as our plan is not enacted into
law.''
   Some in Congress, even those with reservations about the plan,
are inclined to give Bush what he wants and try to sidestep
political blame if things go wrong. If the plan works, then it was
Congress that passed it. If it doesn't, then it's the Bush plan.
   But other members of Congress are looking to put their mark on
the bill. Administration officials fear the most likely target will
be Bush's complex scheme to keep $50 billion in bailout money out
of the budget deficit by creating a new government corporation to
sell bonds.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., Senate Banking Committee
chairman, and Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., say they can save more
than $4 billion in interest costs by borrowing the $50 billion
through regular Treasury bonds. They would carry a lower interest
rate than the special off-budget bonds, which also would be backed
by the Treasury, but in a less direct fashion.
   The Riegle-Schumer plan would balloon the budget deficit for the
current fiscal year ending Sept. 30, but it would avoid the
automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law because all of
the 1989 deficit target deadlines have expired.
   Administration officials view this as a thinly disguised
Democratic attempt to bust Gramm-Rudman, creating a precedent for
big spending increases for other programs and ruining Bush's
chances of keeping his no-new-taxes pledge. They argue that their
own, off-budget, evasion of Gramm-Rudman is harder to duplicate.
   Another dispute, this one an intra-Republican squabble between
the administration and Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior GOP
member of the banking panel, had loomed as a potential roadblock.
   Garn, whose former top aide, M. Danny Wall, is chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, has enjoyed great influence at the
bank board, an independent agency.
   The administration wants to transfer the bank board's deposit
insurance fund to the FDIC, which already insures accounts at
commercial banks, and wrap the remainder of the agency into the
Treasury Department.
   Garn is adamantly opposed to allowing what he calls ``the gnomes
of Treasury,'' perceived to be more sympathetic to the interests of
big banks and Wall Street than to S&amp;Ls, to get their clutches on
the S&amp;L agency.
   Bush advisers aren't budging. They say that if taxpayers are
asked to bail out the industry, then an executive branch
department, directly responsible to elected officials, must control
the regulators.
   A potential compromise would put the regulatory functions of the
bank board into the Treasury Department, but leave its financing
aspects independent. The board's 12 regional banks borrow money on
Wall Street at low interest rates, funneling it to small and
medium-sized S&amp;Ls that don't have the clout to get the low rates on
their own.
   Congressional aides predict Garn will take the deal because he
doesn't want to hold up the legislation and he faces several
not-so-subtle threats if he doesn't go along.
   The administration, if it was inclined, could go along with a
push by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Banking Committee, to force Wall to undergo reconfirmation by the
Senate.
   The other big battle will be over the administration's proposal
to force S&amp;Ls to meet tougher capital standards, 6 percent instead
of 3 percent, by June 1991.
   Capital represents the money an S&amp;L's owners have invested.
Owners required to risk more of their own money before federal
deposit insurance kicks in are likely to manage more carefully.

   The curious, the devout and the doubting
Thomases are flocking by the hundreds to a Roman Catholic church to
gaze upon a life-size crucifix, whose once-open eyes reportedly
closed during a Good Friday service.
   ``I brought everyone who could fit in my car,'' said Evelyn
Borrelli, 44, of Glassport, who drove about 40 miles with two
children and five other adults to this Ohio River mill town on
Friday.
   ``I wanted to be as close as I could be, and I wanted my
children to experience it too. I truly believe it was a miracle,''
she said.
   Since Easter, when the Good Friday occurrence was reported in
the media, more than 1,000 people from several states have been
visiting the Holy Trinity Church each day, according to the Rev.
Vincent Cvitkovic, the church pastor.
   The parking lot has been continually full, and there's a
constant stream of traffic on the narrow, brick street in front of
the white church 15 miles northwest of Pittsburgh.
   A spokesman for Bishop Donald Wuerl, head the Roman Catholic
diocese of Pittsburgh, said church officials are withholding
judgment on the event until they can complete an investigation.
   But many of the worshipers say that, miracle or not, they feel
better after gazing at the luminescent statue suspended on a cross
15 feet above the altar.
   ``It's touching. You feel cleansed,'' said Joanne Smallwood, 66,
of nearby Aliquippa.
   ``I feel a little bit calmer within myself,'' said Louise
Zbihley, 51, also of Aliquippa. ``It just made my faith a little
bit stronger.''
   The downcast eyes, which now appear as small slits that conceal
the pupils, were about one-third open when the plaster crucifix was
moved in January from a corner of the church where it hung at
eye-level. It was suspended in a more prominent position in front
of a modern stained-glass window depicting a resurrected Christ.
   Cvitkovic said he often pointed out the crucifix to his
congregation of 300 families, saying it was unusual in that it
depicted a still-living Christ, with open eyes and mouth.
   Domenic Leo of Beaver, an artist who helped restore the
58-year-old statue in January and had touched up the eyes with
acrylic paint, confirmed the eyes were open when the crucifix was
hung.
   But during a three-hour prayer meeting on Good Friday,
worshipers noticed the eyes had almost closed.
   Cvitkovic said it would be nearly impossible for someone to have
tampered with the crucifix because the church is locked when
services are not held.
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' said Don Otto of Coraopolis,
who attended the Good Friday prayer meeting. ``It was like
electricity running through you. It was an overwhelming experience.
Tears came to me.''
   A member of the Queen of Peace prayer group, which studies the
Virgin Mary's reported manifestations in the small Yugoslavian
village of Medjugorje, claimed he then received a spiritual message
while on his knees praying following the service.
   Those who have come to Holy Trinity since the Good Friday event
sit quietly, hands folded and eyes transfixed on the crucifix.
   Some, like Clare Paonessa who brought her 4-year-old deaf
daughter, seek religious healing.
   ``She can use all the help she can get through the Blessed
Mother,'' said Mrs. Paonessa, of Sharpsburg.
   Some people are clearly moved, breaking into tears, while others
come only out of curiosity.
   ``I'm kind of skeptical,'' said Betsy O'Donnell, 50, of
Pittsburgh. ``People want miracles because of all the unhappiness
in the world.''

<TEXT>
   The makers of a South African
anti-war film have decided not to release it in this country after
censors ordered 48 cuts.
   The film, ``The Stick,'' is based loosely on the undeclared
border war fought by South African forces in recent years in
northern Namibia and southern Angola. It has been shown at several
international film festivals and is scheduled to open commercially
in the United States in May.
   Its director, Darrell Roodt, and producer, Anant Singh, said in
a statement Friday they had decided not to release it in South
Africa even though government censors lifted a ban imposed last
year.
   The film makers said the censors ordered 48 cuts, barred anyone
under 21 fron seeing the movie, and ruled that it could only be
shown in theaters with fewer than 200 seats.
   ```The Stick' is a film that should be seen by South Africans,''
Singh said. ``However, the number of excisions ordered would reduce
the film to a simple exploitation picture and destroy the impact
and power that it has now.''

   A dispute between the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank over setting conditions for Third World
loans has been settled, a bank spokesman said Saturday.
   Frank Vogel, a spokesman for the bank, said the dispute was
settled Friday when bank President Barber Conable won approval for
a new agreement from his board of executive directors.
   The board represents the 151 governments that own the bank,
including the United States.
   Conable's agreement was with Michel Camdessus, the Frenchman who
is managing director of the International Monetary Fund, which is
owned by the same 151-member nations.
   Vogel said the accord provides the fund with authority over
``aggregate macroeconomic policy,'' which gives the IMF the leading
role in deciding how loans may affect the economy of a borrowing
country. The agreement also leaves a loophole for the bank to
continue to make certain nondevelopment project loans.
   The agreement seeks to end problems such as the one that cropped
up last October when the two international lending organizations
clashed heads over a loan to Argentina.

<HEAD>Man Confesses To Wife's Death 12 Years Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTESANO, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has confessed to killing his wife
12 years ago in what authorities at the time thought was a traffic
accident.
   A confession by Dennis Potter, 55, of Humptulips was contained
in sworn statements unsealed Friday in Grays Harbor County Superior
Court.
   According to the documents, Potter said he was driven by guilt
to approach county authorities two weeks ago and admit that he
killed his wife in a fight. ``I had no right to take her life,'' he
said.
   ``She was making my life so miserable that I had to get rid of
her,'' Potter told sheriff's deputies in his confession. ``I
decided I was going to enjoy my life a little bit and just lay her
in the ground where she belonged.''
   Potter was arrested Friday for investigation of murder. He was
being held in the county jail pending a decision by county
Prosecutor Steward Menefree on whether to file charges.
   Earlier this week, the county sheriff's office exhumed the body
of Norma L. Potter, who was 40 when she died in 1976. An autopsy
was conducted by the King County medical examiner, and results have
been sent to Grays Harbor authorities.
   In statements to police, Potter described himself as driven by a
rage because ``my wife would do nothing for me, but she expected
everything from me.''
   He said he has now realized his anger ``wasn't a sane way of
thinking.''
   Potter said that on the evening of Nov. 28, 1976, he asked his
wife to accompany him to a tavern in Humptulips, 80 miles southwest
of Seattle, for a drink.
   They went, and each had a drink, but ``she wouldn't talk to
me,'' he said.
   The couple returned home, but Potter said his wife refused to
come inside, ``so I started after her.''
   ``I grabbed her by the coat front and hit her,'' he said. ``As
far as I know, it broke her jaw and knocked her unconscious. She
fell, and I was still in such a rage that I got down alongside of
her. I guess I straddled her and started strangling her.''
   As his wife's breathing became fainter, Potter said he ``got to
feeling sorry for her,'' and tried to revive her with
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
   He decided to take her to a hospital, but changed his mind on
the way.
   ``I thought if I took her to the hospital she could take me to a
court of law to have me put away for being violent,'' he said.
   Instead, he drove down an isolated road, where he decided to
``wreck the car to either kill us both or to see if one of us was
worth saving.''
   He floored the accelerator and crashed the car into a bank of
the twisting road. When Potter came to, he was slumped over the
wheel. He noticed a cut on his forehead, he told deputies.
   His wife had been thrown 10 feet from the car. Potter said he
approached where she lay and heard ``a rasping breath and she quit
breathing.''
   Had she not died at the scene, Potter later told police, he
would have ``taken a tire iron and beat her to death.''
   A court affidavit said investigating officers at the time
accepted Potter's explanation of the accident, and no autopsy was
conducted, even though his wife had indicated to a minister she
feared for her life.
   Menefree, the county prosecutor, said the autopsy confirmed
Potter's description of the fight. He declined to give specifics,
but said autopsy results ``fit into the whole puzzle we're piercing
together.''

<HEAD>Independent Culture Meeting Marks End of Underground Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Underground writers and publishers rubbed
elbows Saturday with critics, actors and film makers in a
coming-out celebration of independent culture, seven years after
the icy chill of martial law.
   The festive and animated gathering in a packed Warsaw University
auditorium reflected the thaw taking place in Poland this spring
during talks between the Solidarity-led opposition and the
communist authorities.
   ``I never dreamed ... that an official meeting would be held for
the outstanding creators of Polish culture and activists of the
second circulation _ publishers, journalists, editors, printers,
distributors and workers in the conspiracy,'' said publisher
Grzegorz Boguta in a letter to the meeting.
   ``Has the moment finally arrived in which it is not necessary to
fight with the secret police, censorship and state administration
for the freedom to create?'' asked Boguta, who acknowledged five
months ago that he was the director of Nowa, Poland's largest and
oldest underground publishing house.
   The Independent Culture Forum was organized by the culture
commission of the Citizens Committee, an advisory group set up last
year by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa that functions as a sort of
grand council of the Polish opposition.
   It was convened by commission chairman Andrzej Wajda, Poland's
leading filmmaker.
   Before the hundreds of people attending the forum,
composer-conductor Witold Lutoslawski called for the approval of a
charter requesting freedom of association for creative artists and
freedom in libraries, television, film studios and bookstores.
   Talks between Solidarity and the government that started Feb. 6
aim at speeding the growth of ``pluralism'' to replace official
monopolies in politics, labor unions and the economy.
   Participants at Saturday's meeting made clear that such
pluralism also must replace any official monopoly on culture.
   Although authorities in recent years have eased censorship and
shown a degree of tolerance for illegal publishers, Boguta noted
that some people in the movement would continue to keep their
identities hidden as long as any repressions and censorship exist.
   ``The proper places for books are not the Interior Ministry's
warehouses, but in bookstores, libraries and private collections,''
he said.
   Outside the auditorium, independent publishing houses set up
tables where they sold uncensored works by officially out-of-favor
Polish authors or emigre writers.
   One popular seller was the paperback underground edition of
Walesa's autobiography, ``The Way of Hope,'' which has never been
officially published in Poland.

   Abdullah Ahdal, the Moslem preacher
who was slain in Brussels after distancing himself from death
threats against author Salman Rushdie, was buried Saturday in
Mecca, Islam's holiest city.
   The body of the 36-year-old cleric was flown to Saudi Arabia by
a special jet sent by King Fahd. Abdullah Omar Naseef, the
secretary-general of the Moslem World League, led the funeral
service.
   Ahdal, whose parents live in Mecca, was killed Wednesday at a
mosque in Brussels that is financed by the Moslem World League. He
was considered head of the Moslem community in Brussels, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg.
   Ahdal and his aide, the mosque's Tunisian librarian Salim Behir,
were shot and killed by unidentifed assailants. The aide's body was
flown to Tunisia.
   Belgian authorities are investigating the slayings, but there
had been threats against Ahdal for his moderate views, especially
on the controversial issue of Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Ahdal supported the Moslem World League, which condemned the
book as blasphemous to Islam but opposed the death threat against
the author by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Iranian clerics
have offered a $5.2 million bounty to anyone who kills Rushdie, who
has been in hiding in England since Feb. 14.
   On Friday, Soldiers of Justice, a Moslem fundamentalist group
that is holding a Belgian doctor hostage in Lebanon, claimed it
killed Ahdal and his aide for carrying out ``destructive and
anti-Islamic activities through maintaining contacts with'' Mossad,
Israel's intelligence agency.
   Ahdal is survived by a wife and seven children.

<HEAD>Kansas Official Files for Bankruptcy to Halt Salary Garnishment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Attorney General Robert Stephan filed
for bankruptcy in federal court, saying he couldn't pay a $200,000
judgment awarded to a former employee who sued him for sexual
harassment.
   He said Friday that garnishment of one-fourth of his $63,000
state salary, combined with interest payments due on the award,
wouldn't leave him enough to live on while he appeals the case.
   A lawsuit filed in 1982 by Marcia Tomson Stingley was settled
out of court, but she later filed another lawsuit for breach of
contract, alleging that Stephan had broken an agreement not to
reveal terms of the settlement.
   A federal court jury ruled in her favor last November and
awarded her $200,000. Garnishment of Stephan's paycheck to begin
paying off the judgment was to begin this month.
   ``Since action has been taken to garnish my wages, declaring
bankruptcy is my only alternative,'' said Stephan, 56.
   Don Krueger, one of Ms. Stingley's attorneys, said he was angry
at Stephan's action.
   ``I think he ought to resign,'' Krueger said. ``He used taxpayer
dollars to defend his lawsuit, and if he had the guts, he would
walk out and resign.''
   Ms. Stingley was fired in 1982 after working three years in the
attorney general's office as a file clerk.
   In her 1982 lawsuit, Ms. Stingley accused Stephan of making
sexual advances on the job. In a sworn deposition, she also accused
him of propositioning her daughter and friends of her daughter.
   Stephan and one of his supporters held a news conference in
October 1985 and disclosed that Ms. Stinley was paid $24,000 to
settle that lawsuit.
   At the time, Stephan, a Republican, was preparing for a bid for
governor in 1986. But in November 1985 he dropped those plans,
saying the criticism and publicity surrounding the harassment case
were unbearable. He also said he regretted having settled the
``unfounded and ridiculous'' lawsuit.
   By filing the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition Friday, Stephan
stops the garnishment, starting with his next paycheck.
   In the petition, Stephan listed his debts as unknown, and gave
his assets at $70,401, all of which he said are protected from
creditors under Chapter 7.
   Despite his financial troubles, Stephan said, ``I am proud of my
record as attorney general and will continue to carry out my duties
to the very best of my ability.''
   Stephan is serving his third four-year term as attorney general.
He has not indicated whether he intends to seek a fourth term next
year.

   The White House grounds echoed Saturday with
clanking metallic sounds and shouts of ``good shoe'' and ``c'mon
Mr. Smooth.'' It was the president of the United States christening
his new horseshoe pit and showing off his pitching form.
   President Bush was joined by some 150 picnic guests, including
national champion horseshoe pitchers, to inaugurate the 40-foot,
clay pit he had installed next to the White House swimming pool.
   Bush, a horseshoe aficionado, demonstrated his own pitching
style, getting off to a rough start when he played at a secondary
pit dug to handle Saturday's overflow crowd.
   Playing with local sportscasters George Michael and Glenn
Brenner and Washington Redskins tackle Dave Butz, Bush threw a few
marginal shoes, then turned to reporters and joked, ``When you have
guests, one of the rules is to make them feel comfortable and at
home, so I'm trying not to get too close to the stake.''
   ``It stinks,'' was his comment on one of his pitches that went
afar.
   Later, throwing against Gov. Guy Hunt of Alabama, Bush got his
ringer.
   ``Thank you very much,'' he said throwing up his hands and
leaving the pit to others.
   Bush showed a familiarity with horseshoe lingo, shouting such
expressions as ``good shoe'' and ``c'mon Mr. Smooth,'' and ``power
outage'' when someone missed a shot.
   Other governors who tried their hand at the pit were James
Blanchard of Michigan, Carroll Campbell of South Carolina and Kay
Orr of Nebraska.
   The weather was chilly and a brisk wind blew the red-and-white
checked table cloths on the picnic tables set up for hot dogs and
hamburgers.
   The table centerpieces were of daisies and horseshoes. Tuxedoed
waiters served the food and wine. A Navy band played country music.
Bush and first lady Barbara wore matching warm-up jackets.
   Several horseshoe champions were on hand along with a Washington
contingent that included Vice President Dan Quayle, various Cabinet
members and media representatives and friends of the Bushes.
   Bush called for a demonstration by world champion Jim Knisley of
Bremen, Ohio, and the women's champion Diane Lopez of Lompoc,
Calif. They threw a neat series of ringers and near-ringers to
Bush's apparent delight.
   Knisley, who won his second world championship in August in
Pleasanton, Calif., met Bush at the Ohio State Fair last summer
when Bush was campaigning for president.
   Before the picnic, Bush and some of the early guests warmed up
at the pit as the skies clouded over and a chilly breeze picked up.
   Tourists passing by the sidewalk outside the grounds could hear
the sound of clanking horseshoes, but could not see the pit.
Several looked up curiously toward the White House lawn.

   Tucked away in a warehouse behind the
Monterey Bay Aquarium, marine biologists keep deep, damp secrets.
   A large, cylindrical tank holds four purple-striped jellyfish _
the first ever bred in captivity. Nearby, two ocean sunfish bob in
a swimming pool-sized tank, part of an effort to keep the
warm-water beasts alive after currents swept them into the chill
waters of Monterey Bay.
   Behind the scenes, researchers prepare projects for months and
years before the public gets a look. Yet less than five years after
it opened on Oct. 20, 1984, the $50 million Monterey Bay Aquarium
is far from a secret place.
   It ranks with Disneyland, the San Diego Zoo and Knott's Berry
Farm as one of California's most popular attractions, according to
tourism figures. The aquarium drew 1.7 million visitors last year.
   The nonprofit aquarium, located about 100 miles south of San
Francisco and built with a gift from David and Lucile Packard of
computer giant Hewlett-Packard fame, enjoys a reputation as one of
the finest in the world.
   ``I think I've always known about the Monterey Bay Aquarium,''
said visitor Judy Gray of Atlanta on a recent weekday. ``It's like
the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.''
   Sea otters remain the most popular attraction, but visitors rave
about the three-story-high, 335,000-gallon ``Kelp Forest''
centerpiece display.
   A dimly lit corridor snaking along the main 90-foot-long
Monterey Bay Habitat display gives visitors the impression they are
viewing the sea from the ocean floor.
   Fresh sea water is pumped into the tanks to nourish animals and
plants. Because rocks are too heavy for most of the displays,
artificial boulders made of fiberglass were placed on the ocean
floor two years before opening day to create a weathered look and
attract specimens.
   Then there are ``touch pools,'' in which children and adults can
stick their hands and feel sea life.
   ``It was really neat because they're really smooth,''
10-year-old Isaac Pierce said after stroking a bat ray as it swam
by. ``They are kinda slimy but really smooth. Silky smooth.''
   For the first time, the aquarium has mounted a temporary exhibit
devoted to marine life from beyond the Monterey Bay area.
``Mexico's Secret Sea'' displays spectacular tropical fish and
other creatures native to the Sea of Cortez, located between Baja
California and the Mexican mainland.
   By choosing the Sea of Cortez, administrators took advantage of
novelist John Steinbeck's historical link to Monterey. Steinbeck
and good friend Ed ``Doc'' Ricketts, a noted marine biologist and
Monterey resident, ventured to the gulf area in 1940 for a six-week
expedition during which they collected thousands of specimens and
cataloged 60 species new to science.
   A team of aquarium researchers made a similar expedition to
collect the animals for the 6,000-square-foot exhibit, which closes
Sept. 4.
   In one tank, toothy moray eels peek from behind rocks, evoking
squeals of delight and disgust from passing schoolchildren.
   ``I don't like them,'' declared 8-year-old Lora Kihorany of
nearby Soquel. ``They can bite you. He is long. I mean, long!''
   But the aquarium has caused some ill feelings in the community.
The crush of visitors has caused traffic problems and has changed
the historically funky Cannery Row into more of a place for
tourists. A few nearby merchants complain about unwanted
competition from the aquarium's gift shop and restaurant.
   But a new 1,000-space municipal parking lot has helped alleviate
crowding, and most merchants say the aquarium has ushered in a
welcome business boom.
   ``Nobody likes to see the Row change,'' said Kristan Soboleski,
general manager of Sly McFly's Bar and Grille, which has had a 25
percent increase in business since the aquarium opened. Yet she
cringes at the memory of past slow winters.
   Aquarium officials are mum regarding future expansion, although
Lucas confirmed some plans are under consideration.
   Officials would rather talk about the aquarium's pioneering
research like the breeding in captivity of the purple-striped
jellyfish.
   ``Nobody has ever seen the young of this species before,'' said
Dave Powell, director of animal husbandry. ``Only adults.''
   The team of about 20 aquarists, all of whom are scuba divers who
help gather animals for display, are clearly proud of their work.
   ``The aquarium is sort of like an onion,'' said aquarist Bruce
Upton. ``The more you look, the deeper you can go. People spend two
hours here, but they could spend their lives.''

   Foreign creditors must cut Latin
nations' high monthly payments on the region's $400 billion foreign
debt before developing countries can stop environmental
destruction, Latin officials said Saturday.
   A two-day U.N. environmental meeting, attended by Cabinet
ministers and ecologists from 32 countries, ended Saturday with the
signing of a collective statement.
   ``The debt cannot be paid under the present conditions without
increasing the hunger and misery of our people or ... the
degradation of our environment,'' the document said.
   According to the declaration, the region must ``reverse the
negative transfer of resources that has turned developing countries
into capital exporters to industrialized countries.''
   Latin nations last year paid $29 billion in interest to foreign
creditors, the ministers said. Brazil, the developing world's
largest creditor, pays $1 billion monthly in interest on its $115
billion foreign debt.
   The ministers called for new aid from international agencies
such as the World Bank to help fund environmental protection
projects.
   Industrialized nations have an obligation to use financial and
technological resources to reverse deterioration of the world's
environment, the declaration said.
   ``The serious environmental problem the world faces today
derives mainly from the industrialization, consumption and wasteful
models adopted by developed nations,'' the statement said.
   Latin nations have come under fire recently for not adopting
appropriate environmental controls to protect wilderness areas. In
Brazil, where researchers estimate an area the size of Belgium has
already been slashed and burned from the vast Amazon jungle, the
government has said it won't implement ecological programs at the
expense of development.

<HEAD>Hawaii Oil Spill More Serious Than First Thought</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Endangered sea turtles and humpback whales have
been sighted off Hawaii beaches soiled by at least 10,000 gallons
of oil from a mystery spill, and officials were concerned about the
long-term effects of oil on the animals.
   Crews Saturday continued to clean bunker fuel oil from more than
20 miles of beach on the islands of Lanai and Molokai, two of the
most undeveloped in the main Hawaiian chain.
   John Naughton, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said he saw whales surfacing through an oil slick and
witnessed green sea turtles feeding just off a tarred beach.
Humpback whales and green sea turtles are both listed as endangered
species.
   Although no marine animals had been harmed by the oil yet,
``There may be some long-term effects,'' he said.
   Naughton was particularly concerned about the sea turtles, which
feed on algae that may have been tainted by toxic substances in the
oil.
   Oil was first spotted between Molokai and Lanai last Sunday.
Authorities said at the time the spill appeared minor and most of
the oil would likely drift out to sea.
   However, the oil sullied a nine-mile stretch of Molokai's south
coast and about 10 miles of Lanai's shore in the form of tar balls
and small puddles.
   Beachgoers have been warned, said State Health Director John
Lewin.
   The source of the spill has yet to be determined.
   Officials Friday upgraded the spill from ``minor'' to
``medium,'' although the precise amount of oil spilled had not been
determined.
   ``A medium spill means that at least 10,000 gallons but less
than 100,000 gallons has spilled. We can't be certain because we
don't know the size of the tank that it came from, and that's the
best way to tell,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.
``It's definitely on the low side of the scale.''
   Bunker fuel oil is less toxic than crude oil, which comes
straight from the ground and has more petroleum and other gases,
Spangler said.
   The incident was Hawaii's second oil spill in less than a month.
On March 2, the tanker Exxon Houston broke loose from a mooring and
ran aground off Oahu, spilling more than 30,000 gallons of oil and
polluting two miles of shoreline.

<HEAD>Hawaii Pondering $33 Million Purchase of Coral Atoll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE DUNFORD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Honolulu family is giving state lawmakers
until the end of April to decide whether to buy picturesque Palmyra
Island, an uninhabited coral atoll 960 miles south of here. The
asking price: $33 million.
   Otherwise, the 600 acres of land within the 8,000-acre
reef-protected atoll will go to the highest bidder, preferably one
who is willing to preserve the island's natural beauty, said
Ainsley Fullard-Leo, the youngest of three brothers who own the
island.
   ``We've had it for a number of years now and we're not in a
position to develop it. We're getting on in years and feel it is
time to sell it and move on,'' said Fullard-Leo, 57. ``We're giving
the state the first chance at it.''
   ``I view the purchase with a manifest destiny mentality,'' said
Sen. Russell Blair, who introduced the bill to buy the island. ``It
is something that could be tremendously important for Hawaii's
future generations.''
   People laughed at the Louisiana Purchase and ``Seward's Folly,''
the 1867 purchase of Alaska from Russia for $7 million, Blair said.
   Gov. John Waihee said he is willing to give the purchase ``real
consideration,'' if the Legislature decides to buy it. The bill has
been approved by the state Senate and is pending before the House.
   What makes Palmyra especially attractive is its deep draft
harbor, an airstrip left over from World War II and frequent
rainfall, said Peter Savio, a realtor representing the family.
   In recent years, the island 200 miles north of the equator has
served primarily as a stopping-off place for yachtsmen, he said.
   University of Hawaii scientists view it as ideal for a variety
of oceanographic and marine life research and a possible site for
equatorial space launches. State administration officials say it
could be a vaulable commercial and recreational fishing center.
   Most of the attention from private interests, however, appears
to focus on building an exclusive resort on the flat U-shaped
string of islets that ring two deep lagoons with white sand beaches.
   The family has in recent months had 10 offers in the range of
$30 million from a variety of U.S. and Japanese companies and one
Pacific nation, but most have asked that they not be identified,
Savio said.
   ``We would like to see someone who is ecologically minded take
over and preserve the wildlife and the birds there,'' he said.
   The island, acquired by the Fullard-Leos' parents in 1922 from a
business partner after a fishing enterprise fell on hard times, has
been a financial albatross for the family.
   The family had to sell property in Hawaii to pay for legal
expenses during a seven-year court fight with the U.S. Navy, which
contested the family's title to Palmyra, Fullard-Leo said.
   The family finally won clear title in a 1947 ruling by the U.S.
Supreme Court, he said.

<HEAD>Japanese Tax Reform Inaugurated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A sweeping overhaul of the tax system took effect
Saturday, befuddling consumers and shopkeepers and increasing
opposition leaders' calls for the resignation of Japan's already
beleaguered prime minister.
   The centerpiece of the reform is a new 3 percent ``consumption
tax'' on everything from taxi rides to apartment rents. At the same
time, the reform cuts corporate, inheritance, higher-level income
and residential taxes by $44.6 billion in fiscal 1989.
   Part of those cuts will be offset by the sales tax, which the
Finance Ministry has said will bring in $24.8 billion its first
year.
   It was Japan's first major tax overhaul since World War II, and
shoppers found themselves confronting long lines as shopkeepers
tried to adjust to the new system.
   ``Customers must wait longer at the register since we're not
used to calculating this tax yet,'' said Tokiko Sekitake, a clerk
at a drugstore in downtown Tokyo. ``But they aren't complaining.
Most blame the government and sympathize with us.''
   Dozens of city councils across Japan criticized the tax, and
some have reportedly pledged not to implement it in certain sectors.
   Because of adjustments in a variety of taxes, the reform
affected goods unevenly. Some prices rose, while others fell and
others remained unchanged.
   It lowered taxes on expensive imported liquor but increased the
price of milk. Vending machine soft drink prices stayed the same.
   Television sets were cheaper, but newspapers raised their
prices. The cost of a Big Mac hamburger at McDonalds went from
$2.84 to $2.93 but because of altered service charges, meals at
posh restaurants became more affordable.
   Prices of foreign luxury cars and domestic autos dropped, while
taxi and subway fares increased. Taxes on automobiles will be cut
from the present 15 percent to just 3 percent in three years.
   The government granted a special exemption to small businesses,
meaning two-thirds of Japanese enterprises won't have to hand over
the tax to the federal government. Small business and the
agricultural sector are the mainstay of support for the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   But many small enterprises, such as independent taxis and
discount stores, raised their prices anyway to offset increased
operating costs.
   The government says the sales tax will fit the needs of Japan's
current economy better than an income tax. It claims the main goal
of the reform plan is to distribute the tax burden more equitably
by lightening the burden on middle-income workers.
   But several groups, including the 1 million-member Japan
Housewives' Association, claim ambiguities in the reforms will lead
to unfair price increases and even formation of price-fixing
cartels.
   Soon after taking office in October 1987, Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita made tax reform a major goal. Last December his party,
which commands comfortable majorities in both houses of Parliament,
voted the package into law despite the first no-confidence motion
by opposition parties in five years.
   But the tax reform and a stock-trading scandal involving
Takeshita and many of his party's elite have led to support ratings
as low as 9 percent in recent opinion polls.
   Opposition party leaders repeated their calls for abolition of
the tax and for Takeshita to resign.
   ``Prime Minister Takeshita has said there will come a day when
(people) will be glad the sales tax was implemented,'' Socialist
Party Secretary General Tsuruo Yamaguchi said in a speech today.
``That is the lie of the century.''

<HEAD>Communist Party Researcher Admits Many Soviets Strapped</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a rare admission for a society that long
claimed to have eliminated poverty, a Communist Party researcher
said Saturday that most Soviet citizens lack the cash for a
``rational consumer budget.''
   The researcher, G. Zhuravlyov of the Academy of Social Sciences
of the party's Central Committee, didn't quite admit poverty exists
in the Soviet Union. But he came very close in his article in
Vechernyaa Moskva (Evening Moscow).
   ``For a long time, no one talked about poverty,'' Zhuravlyov
wrote.
   Despite claims that poverty does not exist in socialist
countries, at least 40 million Soviets can be described as ``poorly
supplied,'' he said.
   Going further, Zhuravlyov said that ``If it is assumed that a
rational consumer budget is 250-300 rubles ($400-480) per person,
if the low purchasing ability of the ruble and growth of prices is
taken into account, then more than half of the country's
population, with per capita incomes of less than 125 rubles ($200)
per month, cannot be called rich.''
   The average industrial salary in the Soviet Union is $347 a
month. Most families live in tight quarters with rents of $40 to
$65 a month, but a pair of boots costs about a month's pay.
   Zhuravlyov also pointed to new research showing families with
the lowest cash incomes also have some of the smallest living
spaces, typically allocated by government authorities.
   The poorest families, with per capita incomes under $112 per
month, have just 27 to 45 square feet of living space per person,
he wrote.
   Many of the poorest are simply low-income families with three
and four children, Zhuravlyov wrote. Such large families are a
rarity in Russia, though not in the Central Asian republics of the
Soviet Union.

   Four women who began a hunger strike March 20 to
demand the return of a provincial church to religious use were
hauled off the church steps Saturday by police and ambulance
personnel, a human rights activist said.
   Alexander Ogorodnikov, editor of the Bulletin and Chronicle
newspaper in Moscow, said the four women have refused even water in
their fast in Ivanovo, 150 miles northeast of Moscow.
   Before dawn Saturday, six carloads of police and ambulance
personnel took the women to a local hospital after taking them away
from the church, where they have been since last month. Their
relatives have been denied access to them, Ogorodnikov said.
   The women want the church, built in 1914 and known as the
Vedenskaya or Krasni Church, returned to religious use. Since 1938,
it has housed the city archives, which are soon to be moved to a
new building.
   Most churches in the Soviet Union are closed or used for
non-religious purposes. However, a few, most notably the cathedral
in Vilnius, Lithuania, have been returned to use as churches in the
past year as President Mikhail Gorbachev eases restrictions on the
practice of religion.
   Ogorodnikov quoted the local Communist Party Chief, identified
only as Knyazuk, as saying the hunger strikers could continue for a
year but the church would never be returned for worship.
   The women were identified as Valeria Savchenko, 41, a cleaning
woman; Larissa Kholina, 53, a dentist; her daughter, Margarita
Spelenkova, 28; and Galina Yeshukovskaya, 43, a lawyer.
   The hunger strike began March 20 at an Ivanovo movie theater
with eight people, but two men and two women dropped out. The
strikers were forcibly removed, tossed in trucks and taken to the
steps of the church, where a wooden fence was erected and a
policeman stationed to prevent them from talking to the the public,
the activist said.
   Ivanova, with a population of 500,000, currently has one active
church large enough for 300 people, Ogorodnikov said.

<TEXT>
   Iraqis crowded polling stations nationwide
Saturday to elect a new 250-member National Assembly in what was
seen as the first step toward democracy after 20 years of one-party
rule.
   Twelve hours of voting ended at 8 p.m. and election committee
officials began counting votes in more than 900 polling stations
around the country.
   Officials said the turnout was relatively high, but exact
figures were not immediately available.
   They said the first returns would be announced Sunday with final
results not expected until Monday.
   About 2 million of the estimated 8 million voters live in the
capital, Baghdad, which had 59 polling stations.
   The government-controlled media called the election, the first
since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war with Iran, ``a celebration
of democracy'' and called on Iraqis to cast ballots ``as a national
duty.''
   Columnist Daoud Al-Farhan wrote in the Al-Qaddissiya newspaper
that voters should elect people who would work for ``a permanent
constitution, general freedoms, a multiparty system, reasonable
prices, housing for all, improved social services, comprehensive
health insurance, defense of human rights and battling embezzlers
and thieves.''
   The assembly is expected to endorse a new constitution and a new
law establishing a multiparty system after 20 years of rule by the
Arab Baath Socialst Party.
   Polling day was declared a national holiday to ensure a big
voter turnout, and stores and offices were closed.
   Nearly 700 independent candidates, more than in two previous
assembly elections, ran for the part-time legislature.
   In addition, there were 260 candidates from the ruling party,
although authorities have stressed they are not members of an
official ticket.
   Forty-two candidates were dropped at the last minute when it was
discovered in snap tests they could not read or write, the
Revolutionary Command Council announced Friday night.
   The assembly, elected to a four-year term, shares legislative
power with the Council, which must ratify draft laws and also has
veto power.
   Diplomats and political analysts say the election outcome may
influence future policy-making by enabling independents to play a
bigger role in decision making.
   But no timetable has been set for the political reforms, and
they are not expected to reduce President Saddam Hussein's personal
power.
   A referendum will be held on the new constitution, which will
replace an interim charter approved in 1969, one year after the
Baath party seized power in a bloodless coup.
   The elections originally were set for last Aug.30 but were
postponed until March 3 after the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the
gulf war took effect. The second delay was to allow more
independents to run, the government said.
   The candidates, including 62 women and many gulf war veterans,
staged low-key campaigns, confined under government rules to making
brief speeches to organized gatherings and answering a few
questions.
   Their campaigns were funded by the government and candidates
were banned from using any of their own financial resources.

<HEAD>Government Devalues Currency By 230 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prices tripled Saturday for rice,
fuel, cooking gas and airline tickets after Guyana devalued its
currency by 230 percent and doubled interest rates to 35 percent.
   The government increased wages only 20 percent in the move,
which was made to meet International Monetary Fund conditions for
aid.
   Finance Minister Carl Greenidge announced the move during a
budget hearing late Friday to cries of ``shame, shame and
hardship'' from opposition lawmakers.
   ``This is a budget of violence,'' said Cheddi Jagan, leader of
the Marxist opposition People's Progressive Party. The Mirror, an
opposition newspaper, called the devaluation ``murderous.''
   Average daily wages in the South American nation are $2.30,
while a loaf of bread costs $5.
   The Guyana dollar, previously fixed at 10 to the U.S. dollar, is
now worth 33.3 to the dollar. However, by Saturday the U.S. dollar
was fetching 62 Guyana dollars on the black market.
   Though the tough austerity measures were taken to satisfy IMF
conditions for a $1.9 billion aid package, Greenidge said the IMF
has refused to conclude the deal until Guyana raises an additional
$50 million to clear back payments to the fund.
   Greenidge said the government expects to raise the money in two
weeks.
   Guyana, which has had no economic growth in 10 years, is
attempting to secure the IMF package to revamp its stagnant economy.
   This former British colony's main foreign-exchange earning
exports _ bauxite, sugar and rice _ recorded drops in production of
up to 30 percent in 1988.
   For several months the nation of 750,000 has been plagued by
power rationing and outages, food and fuel shortages and spiraling
inflation, causing sporadic strikes and food riots.
   Since the death of Socialist President Forbes Burnham in 1985,
President Desmond Hoyte has moved toward a free-market system,
divesting state enterprises and encouraging foreign capital
investments.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives in
Havana Sunday for talks that focus attention on the contrast
between President Fidel Castro's doctrinaire Marxism and the
pragamatic reforms of his communist sponsor.
   It will be the Soviet leader's first visit to a Latin American
country and only his third meeting with Castro, who traveled to
Moscow for the 27th Communist Party Congress after Gorbachev took
power and participated in the November 1987 Kremlin ceremonies
marking the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
   In addition to the formal talks beginning Monday, Gorbachev will
participate in ceremonial wreath layings and visit a health clinic,
a genetic engineering center, and a crew of people who build
housing on a voluntary basis.
   He is expected to address the National Assembly in a nationally
broadcast speech Tuesday and leaves the next day for London and
meetings with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth
II.
   Gorbachev will be accompanied by his wife Raisa.
   Both nations have stressed in recent public statements the
friendly nature of the visit and the healthy relations between the
two communist countries.
   But Castro in the past has been openly critical of
``perestroika,'' Gorbachev's ambitious modernization program, for
borrowing free-market concepts from capitalism. There are
indications the Soviets have substantially reduced their aid to the
island nation 90 miles off the Florida coast.
   The Soviets highlighted another difference in the two systems
when they held a news conference in Havana on Friday to trumpet the
Soviet Union's March 26 parliamentary elections.
   In Cuba, most forms of dissent are still banned as
counterrevolutionary and can carry long prison terms.
   At a time when Gorbachev is searching for new ideas and
proposing experiments to spur economic development, Castro has
warned that financial incentives for individuals and decentralizing
the economy are dangerous.
   ``We must watch over the ideological purity of the revolution,''
Castro told his nation on the 30th anniversary of his victory on
July 26. ``That is why we cannot use any methods that reek of
capitalism.''
   Soviet officials and Western observers agree Gorbachev is
unlikely to lecture the Cuban leader in public or respond directly
to his charges that Soviet reforms take too much from capitalism.
   That would be seen as a direct contradiction of Gorbachev's
often-stated view that there is no one correct route to socialist
development.
   Diplomats in Havana and Moscow said it is unlikely Gorbachev is
willing to continue subsidizing the Cuban economy at present levels
while faced with widespread shortages, deficit spending and
increasingly difficult economic problems at home.
   According to U.S. estimates, the Kremlin provides Cuba from $4
billion to $6 billion annually in economic and military assistance,
and the aid programs and subsidies account for as much as 20
percent of the Cuban gross national product.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonynmity, said the
Soviets already appear to have reduced their purchases of Cuban
sugar, which they buy at higher-than-market prices as a way of
providing Cuban foreign aid.
   Some diplomats said they expect Gorbachev to tell Castro bluntly
_ but in private _ that Cuban must put its economic house in order.
   But they suggest Gorbachev may make a public show of superpower
support by announcing the Soviet Union's willingness to forgive all
or part of Cuba's ruble debt, which has accumulated in the 30 years
since the Cuban Revolution.
   To forgive a debt that is unlikely ever to be repaid actually
would cost Gorbachev very little, one diplomat said, while raising
the ante for Western industrialized countries that hold most of the
Third World debt.
   Gorbachev told the United Nations in December the Soviet Union
was prepared to offer the least-developed countries a moratorium on
debt service and ``in quite a few cases to write off the debt
altogether'' if the West would go along with a program to solve the
debt problems of poorer countries.

   Three U.S. mine sweepers and a support
vessel steamed out of the Persian Gulf on Saturday in the biggest
pullout of American warships from the region since the Iran-Iraq
cease-fire 7{ months ago.
   The tank landing ship USS Peoria sailed through the Strait of
Hormuz as escort for the mine sweepers Fearless, Inflict and
Illusive, bound for U.S. East Coast ports.
   Their departure left 10 Navy ships in the gulf, including three
mine sweepers. With a nine-ship carrier battle group in the north
Arabian Sea, the U.S. fleet was reduced to fewer than 20 ships for
the first time since the massive Western naval buildup of mid-1987.
   A Navy official said the withdrawal of the three mine sweepers
was decided after ``consultations with our friends in the gulf''
and ``is consistent with the reduced threat to shipping'' since the
Aug. 20 cease-fire.
   The truce ended eight years of hostilities that had spread to
the oil-rich gulf. The fighting damaged or sank about 540
commercial ships and killed 300 sailors.
   The United States sharply expanded its force in the gulf to
protect U.S.-flag shipping and to escort 11 Kuwait-owned oil
tankers that were re-registered under the Stars and Stripes.
Kuwait's shipping was being targeted by Iranian gunboats because of
its support for Iraq.
   Five Western European governments also sent extra warships and
at one time the foreign navies in the region had a combined
strength of nearly 80 ships. The others have largely withdrawn
since the cease-fire.
   U.S. military sources said that apart from the three remaining
U.S. mine sweepers, whose future is uncertain, the latest
withdrawal may be the last by the United States.
   Navy sources said the 8,450-ton Peoria will escort the three
departing ``sweeps'' back to the East Coast and return to its port
in San Diego.
   The Fearless and Illusive are based in Charleston, S.C., and the
Inflict in Little Creek, Va.
   The 720-ton, wooden-hulled mine sweepers were built just after
the Korean war in the early 1950s and are the oldest U.S. Navy
ships on active duty.
   Derided by critics as too old and outmoded, the U.S. mine
sweepers outstripped the more modern European mine sweepers in
disposing of mines laid by Iran in the gulf.
   The sources said the three departing vessels were credited with
about half of more than 50 mines found and destroyed by the U.S.
anti-mine ships since they arrived in November, 1987.
   U.S. officers have said that despite the cease-fire, a threat
from undiscovered mines laid by both Iran and Iraq will persist in
the gulf, especially in its northern waters.
   Four previous cutbacks of the U.S. force since the cease-fire
had involved only one warship at a time.
   The United States also has approved the ``deflagging'' of six of
the 11 Kuwaiti tankers, but the process has been stalled for over a
month, reportedly over legal details.

   Air Force Col. Steve Canyon, a comic strip
character who perhaps has done as much for the morale of his
service as anyone, is retiring after a career full of military
honors.
   A service is planned Monday in Columbus on the Ohio State
University campus to honor the comics page hero created by Dayton
native and Ohio State graduate Milton Caniff.
   Caniff died April 3, 1988, at age 81 and the last Steve Canyon
strip appeared in Sunday newspapers June 5.
   Air Force personnel prepared a biography and list of Canyon's
exploits and will present it to the university. An exhibit will be
set up in the journalism school's library, recently dedicated to
Caniff's memory.
   ``Through Steve Canyon, Milt Caniff did a lot to keep up the
spirits of fliers and the Air Force,'' said 1st Lt. Lynn Ellen
Bryant. ``He really became a part of Air Force lore, and people
remember.''
   Ohio State spokesman Leon Rubin said the presentation was the
Air Force's idea. Canyon is said to have attended Ohio State before
joining the Army Air Corps _ the predecessor of the Air Force _ in
1947.
   Ms. Bryant said the Air Force went through all the old Canyon
comic strips, compiling a ``personnel record'' for the character
through his 1988 retirement.
   ``People here (at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey) and in
New York have dedicated a lot of time, energy and imagination to
the project,'' Ms. Bryant said. ``We are very happy and honored to
do something that will be seen by others and is going to last.''
   Canyon's service record ``includes decorations, citations,
movement orders for each base, family data, all sorts of good
stuff,'' she said. The Air Force decided that since his record was
so varied, the character should be assigned to the Office of
Special Investigations.
   ``That also allowed us to say certain things were `classified'
and we coudn't discuss them,'' Ms. Bryant said.
   The Air Force will present a modern uniform with Canyon's
insignia, rank and name tag, along with a retirement certificate
for Canyon and his wife, Summer Smith. A display will hold his 13
medals and eight ribbons.

   Thirteen trucks flying the blue flag of
the United Nations rolled out of the capital Saturday, one of the
first shipments of a $132-million relief operation aimed at feeding
2.5 million people in the south.
   Before the rainy season begins in early May, Operation Lifeline
aims to position at depots more than 100,000 tons of food,
blankets, tents and medical supplies to keep alive those displaced
by famine and civil war.
   Trucks, airplanes, trains and Nile River barges are being
pressed into duty in the project, which for the first time includes
deliveries to villages and areas under control of Christian and
animist rebels fighting the Moslem-dominated government.
   For the first time, both the government and the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army have promised not to attack or otherwise
hinder the relief shipments. Previous efforts were hampered by one
side or the other for political or military reasons.
   In Nairobi, Vincent O'Reilly, the U.N. media spokesman for
Operation Lifeline, said a convoy of five trucks under U.N.
sponsorship carrying 30 tons of food left Kenya on Friday. On
Monday, a 60-truck convoy is scheduled to leave with 1,000 tons of
food and 10 tons of medical supplies, tarpaulins and pallets.
   The drivers who left Khartoum were on a risky 450-mile journey
to the western village of Muglad, just north of the war zone.
Already 12,000 southerners were sheltered in Muglad in mid-March
and hundreds more have been arriving daily.
   The drivers were to to take their vehicles over roads that
hardly deserve the name and nervously close to Kadugli, capital of
Southern Kordofan region, where heavy fighting has been reported in
recent weeks.
   ``If we don't do this, the disaster will be roughly equal to the
disaster of Hiroshima,'' said James A. Grant, the U.N. official
coordinating Operation Lifeline Sudan. ``Or in recent history, it
will be four times larger a disaster than Armenia last fall.''
   Soviet officials estimated 25,000 people died in the massive
earthquake that struck Armenia in December. An estimated 78,000
people died when the United States dropped the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945 in its war against Japan, and up to
140,000 died within a few months.
   Nobody knows how many people already have died in Sudan's
6-year-old civil war. Western relief experts put the figure from
1988 alone at 250,000 to 500,000 or more. Some think as many as 2
million have died since the war began in 1983, mostly civilians
driven from their homes who either perished while seeking shelter
or left to starve in refugee camps or besieged towns.
   Grant, special representative of U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, described the Sudanese operation as ``a race
against time (and) a mission impossible that could be possible with
the cooperation of everybody.''
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government previously refused to
allow relief agencies' to deal with the rebels.
   Rebel gunners have shot down at least two civilian passenger
planes and one relief plane and have fired on several others,
claiming the government uses civilian and relief aircraft to
transport troops and military supplies. The rebels also have been
blamed for attacks on relief trucks, barges and trains that have
killed dozens of people.

<HEAD>Snow in Colorado, Northeast; Rain in Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As much as a foot of fresh snow fell on the Colorado Rockies on
Saturday, and about six inches fell in parts of New York state and
Vermont before an Eastern storm began to fizzle.
   A cold front moved across the upper Mississippi Valley and the
central Plains, producing rain from Iowa into western Wisconsin.
Wet snow fell in central and northern Minnesota.
   Light snow tapered off across portions of the central
Appalachians and northern New England after dumping a half foot of
snow across the Adirondacks and the St. Lawrence River valley of
New York state and Vermont.
   Snowfall totals early Saturday included 6 inches at Massena and
Rochester, NY., 5 inches at Buffalo, N.Y., and 3 inches at St.
Albans, Vt.
   Heavy snow fell over the northern and central mountains of
Colorado, where overnight accumulations included 12{ inches at Vail
and 11{ inches at the Beaver Creek ski area.
   Snow and strong winds made driving difficult over mountain
passes. An advisory for snow and blowing snow was posted for the
northern and central mountains of Colorado.
   In the far West, a cold front produced rain over the Pacific
Northwest. Snow advisories were posted for the Cascades of
Washington state and northern Oregon.
   Another cold front moving across Southern California brought
gusty winds to the Mojave Desert.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 29
degrees at Caribou and Limestone, Maine, and Saranac Lake, N.Y., to
89 degrees at Thermal, Calif.
   The low in the nation Saturday morning was 8 degrees at
Marquette, Mich.
   The National Weather Service forecast for Sunday called for
scattered rainshowers from western Kansas across much of the middle
Mississippi Valley, southern portions of the upper Great Lakes and
the Ohio Valley to the central Appalachians; rain falling across
much of the northern and central Pacific Coast and the northern and
central Intermountain region; and strong, gusty winds across the
northern and central Rockies.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 30s over northeast
Minnesota, northwest Wisconsin, western upper Michigan and northern
Maine; in the 40s and 50s from the Pacific Northwest across the
northern and central Rockies, North Dakota, much of the upper
Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes to the northern Atlantic
Coast; the 80s over all of Texas except the panhandle to southern
portions of the southern plateau; and in the 90s in parts of the
desert Southwest. The remainder of the nation generally was
expected to have high temperatures in the 60s and 70s.

   Mayoral front-runner Richard M. Daley sang with
supporters Saturday, smiling and tapping his feet with his faithful
in mostly white neighborhoods while top challenger Timothy Evans
worked to boost black turnout in hopes of a miracle finish for
Tuesday's election.
   Daley and Evans began the day at rallies in different parts of
town, Daley warning Northwest Side supporters against complacency
and Evans appearing with Jesse Jackson at Operation PUSH's South
Side headquarters.
   ``This election is not won by names, not won by endorsements and
not won by polls,'' Daley said at a church.
   Many in the crowd wore jackets sporting the logos of
neighborhood taverns, and the three-term Cook County prosecutor
accepted his own navy blue ``Elect Daley'' jacket.
   The flagging campaign of Edward Vrdolyak got a boost Friday from
President Bush, who endorsed the third-running Republican. ``He
supported me and I don't forget those things,'' Bush said in
Washington. Vrdolyak's plans for Saturday included a spaghetti
dinner in his home ward and a rally organized by Hispanics.
   Heading into Tuesday's election, poll results show Daley's
support near 50 percent compared with about 35 percent for
third-party candidate Evans, the lone black in the race. Vrdolyak,
the former county Democratic chairman who switched parties and
became the write-in GOP winner in February's primary, has about 5
percent.
   The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners estimated that 70
percent of the 1.56 million voters in the nation's third largest
city would turn out Tuesday. Turnout is considered a crucial factor
in the election to complete the last two years of the late Mayor
Harold Washington's second term.
   Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, died in November 1987,
only months into his second term.
   Black turnout prospects brightened somewhat for Evans on
Saturday when he won the endorsement of a key black minister who
had been leaning toward Daley. The Rev. Wilbur Daniel, pastor of
Antioch Baptist Church, has a large South Side following.
   ``Give us this day our Tim Evans bread,'' Daniel said, punning
on ``daily bread'' to the cheers of 1,500 people in the audience at
PUSH.
   Meanwhile, an enthusiastic crowd of about 300 greeted Daley and
his wife, Maggie, in the basement of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church of St. Luke.
   Daley _ son of the legendary political boss and six-term mayor,
the late Richard J. Daley _ entered to a standing ovation and sang
along. He also delivered what has become his stump campaign speech.
   ``People are sick and tired of the name calling, the pettiness.
... I've been to every community in every part of this city and all
people want to hear are the issues _ education, crime, how to get
the gangs out of their neighborhoods.''
   Daley won the Democratic primary Feb. 28 over Mayor Eugene
Sawyer, creating the possibility that Chicago would become by far
the biggest U.S. city to replace a black incumbent with a white.
   Chicago's voting population is 48 percent white, 42 percent
black and 7 percent Hispanic. Sawyer lost by 100,000 votes and many
blamed low black turnout on Evans, his chief rival to succeed
Washington.
   Evans, a South Side alderman running on the Harold Washington
Party ticket, began the day with an appearance at Operation PUSH.
Later in the afternoon, Evans trekked to the far North Side and
spoke to a racially mixed crowd of about 100 at the Rogers Park
Presbyterian Church.
   ``All the issues that the press is trying to make you ignore are
there,'' he said pointing to a table of his campaign literature,
posters and buttons.

   Back-to-back visits by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir during the
coming week will force the Bush administration to come to grips
with problems in the Middle East, but there will be no rush to
judgment.
   ``It would be nice if we could see concrete progress so far as
the peace process is concerned,'' a well-placed U.S. official said
Friday. ``But we ought not to set markers up out there that may or
may not be realized.''
   Mubarak and Shamir will focus on the Palestinian uprising on the
West Bank and in Gaza, but in vastly different ways.
   The Egyptian leader, whose country signed a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, is lobbying for a Middle East peace conference and
a seat at the table for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Mubarak arrived by helicopter from Andrews Air Force Base about
4:30 p.m. EST at a spot between the Washington Monument and Lincoln
Memorial and was met by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and a
military honor guard. Neither of them talked with reporters before
leaving by motorcade.
   He plans a quiet weekend before talks open on Monday with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Shamir, who accuses the PLO of unrelenting terrorism despite
public renunciation last December by Chairman Yasser Arafat, will
propose to President Bush and to Baker that elections be held on
the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The idea, said Avi Pazner, his media adviser, is to designate
Palestinian leaders to negotiate with Israel. ``Shamir is not a man
who can be pressured,'' Pazner said. ``So this does not come from a
sense of pressure. He wants to move the peace process forward.''
   The U.S. official, who barred use of his name and title, said
Bush and Baker were hoping Shamir would bring ``some new ideas and
some new proposals.''
   He begged off evaluating Shamir's elections proposal on the
grounds it is vague. But the official pointed out that Israel had
been trying to talk to Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza
without success.
   Bush and Baker, now in the midst of reviewing U.S. foreign
policy in the Middle East and other regions, as well, are reluctant
to outline a U.S. plan for Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   ``If we move too fast or at too high a level it could pre-empt
more promising possibilities that might present themselves,'' the
official said. ``We would like to see the Israelis come with new
ideas and new proposals.''
   Baker, in testifying last month before a congressional
subcommittee, said his goal was direct negotiations between
Israelis and Palestinians. He also said Israel might have to deal
with the PLO in order to have a ``meaningful'' dialogue.
   Another Shamir idea was shot down even before Mubarak's arrival.
   Two weeks ago, Shamir proposed that the Egyptian leader meet
with him on U.S. soil to try to find ways to resolve the
Palestinian problem, but Mubarak turned him down, Pazner said.
   The proposal apparently had the approval of the Bush
administration. In a way, it would have recreated the meetings
former President Carter held at Camp David, Md., in 1978 with the
late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and former Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin.
   The agreements reached at the presidential retreat produced a
peace treaty in 1979 between Egypt and Israel and called for
Palestinian autonomy on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   But Mubarak, through the Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv, rejected
the proposal, Pazner said.
   Another U.S. official said, meanwhile, ``we would support any
meeting that would advance prospects for peace.'' But the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to discuss the
substance of Shamir's overture.
   A diplomatic source, also insisting on anonymity, said Mubarak
had concluded Shamir would neither agree to negotiate with the PLO
nor approve an international peace conference on the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
   Apparently, Mubarak suspected Shamir was seeking Egypt's
blessing for the elections that the Israeli leader will propose to
Bush and Baker be held among Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and
in Gaza. So, the source said, Mubarak turned Shamir down.
   Egypt has been trying to use the leverage of its relations with
Israel to promote talks with the PLO. But Pazner said ``we want to
find an alternative to the PLO, and the best way to find a
Palestinian leadership is to hold elections. The prime minister
wants to find a solution to the problem.''
   Mubarak will meet with Bush and Baker on Monday. The president
will take him to Baltimore Monday afternoon to see the Baltimore
Orioles and Boston Red Sox open the baseball season. Mubarak then
will meet with Baker again on Tuesday.
   Shamir will hold his talks with the president and secretary of
state on Wednesday and Thursday.
   Israel blames the PLO for instigating the violence on the West
Bank and in Gaza in which 415 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have
died since the uprising began in December 1987. Pazner said Israeli
intelligence had intercepted orders from the PLO, which has its
headquarters in Tunisia, calling for increased disorder while
Shamir is in Washington.

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reinforced Mexican anti-drug units
began stopping and searching cars at roadblocks along the U.S.
border Saturday in a major operation expected to last at least
several weeks, officials reported.
   ``An operation was established along all of the border,'' said
Jose Silva Arroyo, narcotics supervisor for the federal judicial
police in Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas.
   Judicial police, the army and federal highway police, backed by
planes and helicopters, are taking part in the operation, according
to Silva Arroyo and other anti-narcotics officials in northern
cities.
   Felipe Flores, spokesman for the Attorney General's office, said
Friday the campaign was ``possibly the largest of its kind.'' He
said the United States and Mexico were sharing intelligence
information in the effort.
   In Washington, Bill Alden of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration said he had no information about a major operation.
   ``There are checkponts on the major highways to detect weapons
and drugs,'' Luis Esteban Garcia Villalon, a police official in
Ciudad Juarez, said by telephone.
   He said among the personnel added for the campaign were 1,000
federal police and more agents of the federal Attorney General's
office.
   ``When there is someone who seems suspicious they are making
detailed checks,'' Garcia Villalon said.
   He said the operation would last indefinitely, depending on the
results. ``We think it's going to be a considerable length of
time,'' he said.
   The operation extends along a broad swath of the northern border
and at least as far south as near the city of Chihuahua, a police
commander said.
   Flores said the program was patterned after Operation Alliance,
a U.S.-Mexican project started in August 1986 that involved
hundreds of U.S. agents and millions of dollars in surveillance
equipment to detect flights ferrying drugs across the border.
   Edwin Meese III, U.S. attorney general at the time, called that
operation ``the most widespread interdiction program on our land
borders in law enforcement history.''
   Narcotics smuggling has been one of the most sensitive issues
between the United States and Mexico. Some U.S. officials have
called for a greater effort by Mexico to stop the flow of drugs
into the United States.
   Mexico regularly cites its anti-narcotic efforts and says the
United States should attack the widespread demand for drugs at home.
   On Saturday the government newspaper El Nacional said federal
highway police seized more than 20,000 pounds of marijuana and
1,879 pounds of cocaine in the first three months of the year.

   Fire burning over 480 acres of brush
destroyed a house, a mobile home and two trailers as firefighters
battled flames pushed over rocky terrain by erratic winds Saturday,
authorities said.
   No injuries were reported and there was no estimate on the value
of the loss, said Capt. Will Donaldson of the California Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection.
   The blaze, in the rugged Alabama Hills four miles west of this
small eastern Sierra Nevada town, was 70 percent contained late
Saturday afternoon and was expected to be fully controlled by 6
p.m. Sunday, Donaldson said.
   About 250 firefighters were battling the fire.
   The house was lost when the fire came out of a deep gorge packed
with thick brush. ``It's real, real heavy material at the bottom,''
he said.
   The blaze erupted when smoldering embers from a blaze that had
been controlled several days earlier were whipped up by 60 mph
winds.
   The earlier fire had begun as a controlled burn of a trash pile,
but was whipped out of control by high winds last week, U.S. Forest
Service spokesman Brian Miller said. That fire, which was ignited
March 21, was controlled the following day.
   Steep terrain and winds of about 30 mph hampered firefighters on
Saturday, Miller said. The rugged area's picturesque mountains,
located 175 miles north of Los Angeles, were used in the filming of
many Western movies.
   Firefighters from the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management,
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Inyo and Kern counties
and several area volunteer agencies were on the scene.

   Israeli troops shot and killed one Palestinian
in a clash Saturday in a West Bank village, and Arab reporters said
16 Palestinians were wounded in confrontations throughout the
occupied territories.
   The army said a second Palestinian died Saturday of gunshot
wounds suffered last week. It confirmed that two Palestinians were
wounded in the West Bank and said it was checking the other reports.
   The deaths raised the Palestinian death toll to 417 since the
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
began in December 1987. Eighteen Israelis have been killed.
   Hospital officials identified the Palestinian killed Saturday as
Akram Mustafa Mahmoud Yassin, 24, and said he was shot in the
heart. They said Yassin's family took his body from the hospital
and held a funeral that quickly turned into a nationalist
demonstration.
   The military said the Palestinian was critically wounded after a
group of Arabs stoned an army jeep patrol and two soldiers suffered
minor injuries. The soldiers took the wounded Arab to Muqassed
hospital in annexed east Jerusalem, where he died.
   Hundreds of Arab youths waved Palestinian flags as Yassin's
coffin was carried through Bethany. The funeral march broke up
after troops said no more than 40 people could participate in the
procession and fired in the direction of the crowd.
   There were no reported injuries. The army imposed a curfew on
the village's 4,000 residents after the funeral.
   Hospital officials identified the other Palestinian who died as
Tareq Awad Farah Amir, 23, from the West Bank town of Hebron. He
was wounded Thursday.
   An army spokesman said the military was investigating reports
that Jewish settlers shot the man.
   In the West Bank, 12 Palestinians were wounded, including a
13-year-old who was shot in the back and a 15-year-old who was shot
in the stomach, Arab reporters said.
   Four Arabs, including a 12-year-old, were wounded in Gaza City
when troops opened fire to break up a demonstration in the area's
commercial center, sources at Arab hospitals said.
   A worker for an international organization in Gaza said that
during the demonstration eight Israeli undercover agents wearing
kaffiyehs, or Palestinian headdresses, joined the protesters in
throwing stones at the soldiers.
   The worker, who spoke on the condition that neither he nor his
organization be identified, said that as the demonstration grew,
one agent pulled out an Uzi submachine gun and began firing in the
air. The agents then arrested at least four Arab youths, the worker
said.
   In another development, the London-based International Press
Association sent a message to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
deploring the actions of Israeli police, whom it accused of
masquerading as journalists.
   Police investigators in Israel last week cleared two
plainclothes officers who had been accused of putting a TV sign on
their rental car as they patrolled Arab east Jerusalem.
   The inquiry came in response to complaints from journalists
after news photographers filmed the two plainclothes officers
driving the car and arresting a 15-year-old Palestinian girl.
   Following protests from reporters, Police Inspector-General
David Krauss said he would limit the practice by requiring police
to seek his permission before masquerading as journalists.
   The press institute message, signed by its president, Peter
Galliner and released on Friday, said the IPI ``deplores the recent
tactics used by Israeli police to impersonate members of the press
as a means of arresting Palestinian demonstrators.''
   The International Press Institute describes itself as an
independent organization representing nearly 2,000 leading
publishers and editors in 60 countries.

<TEXT>
   Austria on Saturday buried its last
empress, Zita, with all the pomp and pageantry of a vanished
monarchy that for centuries ruled territory from Poland to the
Mediterranean.
   The nation's biggest funeral since Emperor Franz Joseph was
buried in 1916, in the waning days of the Hapsburg Empire, seemed
like an act of reconciliation with the family that brought Austria
greatness but was driven into exile after World War I.
   An elaborate Requiem Mass in Vienna's towering St. Stephen's
Cathedral climaxed a week of ceremonies honoring Zita, who died in
Switzerland two weeks ago at 96. When she and her husband left the
country in 1918, she was denounced as a spy for her role in a plot
to end the war.
   Police estimated the number of spectators at 40,000, including
hundreds from Hungary, Italy, Yugoslavia and other parts of what
was once the Hapsburg Empire.
   State television broadcast the ceremony live, and the nation's
largest-circulation daily, Neue Kronen Zeitung, bore the headline,
``Farewell to Zita,'' printed against a background of imperial
Hapsburg yellow.
   Zita's son, Otto von Hapsburg, who fled Vienna's sprawling
Schoenbrunn Palace with his parents, led mourners who included
President Kurt Waldheim.
   All Europe's Roman Catholic royal houses sent representatives.
But no crowned heads attended the four-hour ceremony, which drew
curious, sometimes bemused spectators in an outpouring of nostalgia
for the glory of the empire.
   ``The Austro-Hungarian monarchy was the best state for central
Europe,'' said Abel Paizs, a 21-year-old Hungarian who called
himself a monarchist and came from Budapest for the occasion. ``The
small countries don't function as well separately.''
   An Austrian woman who refused to identify herself said she had
always been a monarchist, adding: ``Nothing better has come after
the monarchy.''
   Between passages from the soaring Requiem of Vienna's most
beloved composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the Mass was laced with
tributes to the huge Hapsburg Empire that stretched north to
Poland, south to northern Italy and east to what is now the Soviet
Union.
   Intercessions were read in each language of the polyglot empire
_ German, Italian, Hungarian, Croat, Slovene, Czech and Polish.
   At the end of the two-hour Mass, the old imperial hymn that was
replaced with a republican anthem in 1918 rang through the vaulted
naves of the Gothic cathedral.
   Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, in a brief address, said the
singing of the hymn ``is not nostalgia, or flirting with a
different state or political system.''
   He recalled that Zita, who always refused to abdicate formally,
had before her death expressed confidence that the peoples of the
former empire would live well.
   Zita, who was also queen of Hungary, will be honored at a
separate Mass in Budapest on Monday. Hungary's Cardinal Laszlo
Pasksai attended Saturday's ceremony.
   An isolated crowd of protesters held aloft a banner that said,
``The Empress is Dead _ Long Live the Republic.'' Police detained
at least two people when they tried to unfurl another banner
outside the imperial vault where Zita was buried.
   At the vault's doors, an ancient ceremony was re-enacted in
which a monk asked, ``Who wants to enter?'' and allowed the coffin
in only when Zita was identified not by her string of imperial,
royal and aristocratic titles, but as ``a mortal and a sinner.''
   Following an ancient family custom, Zita's heart was buried in
the Swiss village of Muri with that of her husband. Muri is a
traditional resting place for the hearts of some Hapsburgs.
   Zita's hearse was the same as that used for Franz Joseph's last
journey to the Capuchin Vault where all the Hapsburg emperors
except Zita's husband, Charles I, are buried. Charles I, Franz
Joseph's nephew, was buried on the Portuguese island of Madeira,
where he died in exile at age 34, 67 years to the day before the
elaborate funeral accorded his widow.
   Charles became emperor of Austria and king of Hungary after the
death of Franz Joseph, who reigned 68 years.
   When Charles and Zita were crowned, they believed only a rapid
truce could save the crumbling dual monarchy, then allied with the
Reich of the German Kaiser. Zita had a key role in arranging secret
contacts with the Allies in search of a peace treaty.
   After Charles' death, Zita and the couple's eight children lived
on the sufferance of other European royal families. The outbreak of
World War II found them in Belgium, but they managed to flee the
advancing Nazi troops and eventually landed in the United States.
   After the war, Zita eventually settled in a modest two-room
apartment in a Swiss convent close to the Austrian border. Austria
allowed her to return in 1982.

<HEAD>Feminists, Brooklyn DA Outraged At Light Sentence in Wife Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge faced growing criticism Saturday for
deciding that cultural considerations warranted a light sentence
for a Chinese immigrant who beat his wife to death because she was
unfaithful.
   The New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women
announced that it would complain to the state Commission on
Judicial Conduct in the next two weeks to protest the sentence of
five years probation.
   ``I think the judge has shown both prejudice and bias by giving
the husband probation,'' said Francoise Jacobsohn, the chapter
president. ``It is not acceptable for a man to kill his wife for
any reason.''
   Judge Edward Pincus cited ``cultural aspects'' Thursday in
sentencing Dong Lu Chen, 51, to probation in the slaying of his
wife, Jian Wan Chen, 40.
   The judge noted ``the effect of his wife's behavior on someone
who is essentially born in China, raised in China and took all his
Chinese customs with him to the United States.''
   Attempts to reach Pincus by telephone Saturday were unsuccessful.
   Chen, a garment factory worker, was convicted of second-degree
manslaughter for fatally striking his 99-pound wife in the head
eight times with a hammer on Sept. 7, 1987.
   Pincus, in a five-day non-jury trial in December, acquitted him
of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter.
   Chen's lawyer, Stewart Orden, said Chen was unable to form the
intent necessary for second-degree murder or first-degree
manslaughter, partly because of ``the overwhelming shame and
humiliation'' his wife's adultery caused him.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman denounced the
ruling, saying, ``There should be one standard of justice, not one
that depends on the cultural background of a defendant.''
   Orden said he didn't argue at trial that it was acceptable in
China ``to act violently towards an act of indiscretion or
infidelity,'' but referred to his client's cultural background to
show his state of mind at the time of the slaying.
   Trial testimony showed that Chen emigrated from Canton, China in
1986. He left his wife, 16-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter in
Brooklyn when he moved to Maryland to find work as a dishwasher.
   Shortly after he returned to Brooklyn, he confronted his wife in
their bedroom about her infidelity and beat her when she said they
couldn't resume sexual relations, according to Andrea Bernstein, a
spokeswoman for Holtzman.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party leadership in
Kosovo province on Saturday expelled an official opposed to
increased Serbian control and three members of the provincial
Politburo resigned.
   The party also rejected the resignation of Rahman Morina, the
Kosovo Communist Party leader who had submitted his resignation
under pressure by striking ethnic Albanian miners.
   In the purge of its ranks following violent demonstrations by
ethnic Albanians Monday and Tuesday that left 24 people dead, the
Kosovo leadership expelled former party chief Azem Vlasi, who is
under arrest, and two other members of the provincial Central
Committee.
   It announced at the end of a 10-hour meeting that three members
of the 13-member Politburo resigned.
   Vlasi, 41, is an ethnic Albanian who headed the provincial party
from 1986 to 1988 and became deeply involved in the conflict
between Serbs, who comprise a minority in Kosovo, and the
Albanians. About 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million people are
ethnic Albanians.
   Vlasi was arrested last month and accused of
counterrevolutionary activity, a charge that carries a possible
death penalty. He was a chief opponent of Serbian Communist Party
leader Slobodan Milosevic.
   Serbia is Yugoslavia's largest republic and Kosovo is a Serbian
province that had a high degree of automoy. Constitutional changes
that took effect Tuesday gave Serbia more control over Kosovo's
judiciary, schools and police.
   Serbian leaders said the changes were needed to protect the Serb
minority from harassment by the Albanians.
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians took to the streets to protest and
officials reported 24 people, including two policemen, were killed
and more than 200 were injured in fighting early last week.
   Saturday was the anniversary of riots by ethnic Albanians in
1981 that left at least nine people dead. Authorities feared
renewed violence Saturday but reported it was quiet as police
forces patrolled the province.
   Saturday's party meeting was held amid tight security in the
provincial capital of Pristina.
   The leaders rejected the resignation by Morina who agreed to
step down after an eight-day sit-in by 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners
in the Stari Trg lead and zinc mine in February.
   The miners refused to leave the pit until Morina, an ethnic
Albanian, and two other party officials resigned. The miners said
Morina gave in to Serbian demands to change the constitution.

<HEAD>Government Devalues Currency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday devalued Peru's
currency by 16.6 percent in an effort to boost exports and reduce
deficit spending.
   Officials have blamed inflation _ which reached a record 1,722
percent last year _ for Peru's fiscal and trade deficits.
   The Economy Ministry said Saturday that March consumer prices
rose 42 percent over prices in February.
   Officials have said inflation will continue to grow in the short
term because of price increases but will eventually decline as the
economy stabilizes.
   Earlier in the week, the government increased by an average of
20 percent the prices of gasoline and subsidized foods such as
wheat, cooking oil and rice.
   The devaluation, announced in the official El Peruano newspaper,
pushed the official exchange rate to 1,440 inti to the dollar, up
from 1,200 to the dollar.
   The government uses the exchange rate to pay exporters and to
finance imports of vital drugs and food staples. The floating free
market rate, which registered 1,550 intis to the dollar Saturday,
is used for nearly all other transactions.
   By devaluing the inti the government hopes to spur exports and
reduce a growing trade deficit. The devaluation also is aimed at
cutting the deficit by reducing the amount the government pays to
subsidize imports.

<HEAD>President Offers Peace Package to Tamil and Sinhalese Radicals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa on
Saturday appealed to Sinhalese militants and Tamil rebels to
negotiate an end to more than six years of ethnic violence, and
said Indian troops would be sent home.
   ``I personally guarantee your safety,'' Premadasa said at a
public meeting in the village of Girandurukotte, northeast of
Colombo. ``Let us forget the past and start a new era. I don't deny
the wrong done to you in the past.''
   His speech was broadcast over state-run radio.
   Premadasa promised to scrap the controversial India-Sri Lanka
peace accord under which 40,000 Indian soldiers have been sent to
the Indian Ocean island nation to put down the rebellion by Tamil
militants.
   He said Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had agreed to remove
the troops, and that the accord would be replaced by a peace treaty
between the two countries.
   Premadasa also offered radicals seats in Parliament. He promised
to do away with strict anti-terrorism laws and outlaw vigilante
groups that have been blamed for the killings of Sinhalese
suspected of being militants.
   He said his proposals were backed by all major opposition
parties in the country.
   ``Leaders of all opposition political parties will appoint their
representatives to monitor the security of everybody ... who wants
to give up violence,'' Premadasa said.
   There were no immediate comment from either the Tamil rebel
groups or the Sinhalese militants.
   An official of the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the proposals ``seemed impressive,
sincere and may work. But let us see.''
   Premadasa said 29 members in the 225-seat Parliament would be
moved out to make way for the radicals. ``I am prepared to do this
to allow your voice to be heard, your problems to be sorted out,''
he said.
   The 29 members, who include 15 from Premadasa's United National
Party, were nominated to Parliament in a system under which parties
got bonus seats on the basis of votes in the Feb. 15 general
elections.
   Sri Lanka, once known only for its tranquil beach resorts,
gemstones and tea, has been torn by ethnic tensions since 1983,
when Tamil militants launched a separatist war claiming
discrimination by the Sinhalese majority.
   Sinhalese militants launched their campaign after they accused
the government of being too generous in concessions to the Tamils.
   More than 12,500 people have been killed in ethnic violence.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese, who control the army and the government, make up 75
percent.

   Franklin A. Korn, a Bell Telephone
Laboratories researcher who helped create touch-tone telephones and
the direct-dial long-distance system, has died at the age of 83.
   Korn, who retired from Bell Labs in 1970 after 50 years with the
company, died at home Friday of kidney failure, said his daughter,
Barbara Trimmer Hudyk.
   Korn was director of telephone laboratories at the former
Western Electric plant here now owned by AT&amp;T. He was credited with
developing a nationwide direct-dial military telephone network
during World War II, and with the development of touch-tone dialing.
   He also co-invented the switching system used by telephone
companies until the mid-1970s, when electronic switching was
introduced, according to Harold Heckendorn, retired engineering
manager of the Western Electric plant.
   Korn held about 15 telephone-related patents, said his grandson,
David Trimmer, and was named a fellow of the Institute of
Electronic and Electrical Engineers, the highest honor bestowed by
the professional organization.
   He is survived by his wife, a daughter, two grandchildren and a
great-grandchild, family members said.

   A rogue computer program designed at Cornell
University that crippled a nationwide computer network last fall
was neither the creation of a genius nor the act of a criminal, a
university commission has concluded.
   Cornell graduate student Robert Morris alone created the program
that infected thousands of military and university computers on
Nov. 2, 1988, says the panel's 45-page report obtained Saturday by
The Associated Press.
   Morris, 23, who is on a leave of absence from Cornell's doctoral
program in computer science, declined to be interviewed by the
commission, which was left to speculate as to the reasons Morris
created the ``worm.''
   ``It may simply have been the unfocused intellectual meanderings
of a hacker completely absorbed with his creation and unharnessed
by considerations of explicit purpose or potential effect,'' the
panel wrote.
   Technically, the program was not a ``virus,'' which inserts
itself into a host program to propagate; it was actually a
``worm,'' or an independent program that endlessly duplicates
itself once placed in a computer system.
   Cornell officials and members of the special panel were
scheduled to discuss their findings at a news conference at 10 a.m.
Monday.
   Morris, of Arnold, Md., remains under investigation by a federal
grand jury in Syracuse and by the U.S. Justice Department in
Washington, D.C.
   The panel rejected the idea that Morris created the worm to
point out the need for greater computer security.
   ``This was an accidental byproduct of the event and the
resulting display of media interest,'' the commission wrote.
``Society does not condone burglary on the grounds that it
heightens concern about safety and security.''
   The program could have been created by many students, graduate
or undergraduate, particularly if they were aware of the Cornell
system's well-known security flaws.
   ``It is no act of genius or heroism to exploit such
weaknesses,'' the commission said.
   Morris, a first-year student, should have reported the flaws he
discovered, which would ``have been the most responsible course of
action, and one that was supported by his colleagues,'' the panel
wrote.
   The commission found that Morris probably wanted to spread the
worm without detection, but did not want to clog the computers. It
said he clearly should have known the worm would replicate
uncontrollably and accused Morris of ``reckless disregard'' for the
consequences.
   Once the worm was unleashed, Morris made only ``minimal
efforts'' to stop its spread and did not inform any person in a
position of responsibility about the existence of the program, the
commission reported.
   The panel disputed industry claims that the worm caused about
$96 million in damage, ``especially considering no work or data
were irretrievably lost.''
   The episode's greatest impact may be a loss of trust among
scholars who use the network, which links research centers and
universities that exchange non-classified information.
   The report said computer science professionals seem to favor
``strong disciplinary measures,'' but the commissison said they
``should not be so stern as to damage permanently the perpetrator's
career.''
   The panel also recommended Cornell develop a universitywide
policy on computer abuse.

<HEAD>Bakker Plans To Rebuild TV Ministry in Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defrocked PTL leader Jim Bakker is
staying at a Florida retreat for ministers suffering from emotional
distress and plans to re-establish his TV ministry while awaiting
his fraud and conspiracy trial, a retreat official said Saturday.
   ``We extended an invitation to him,'' said the Rev. John Dawsey,
chairman of the board of directors of the Lake George Ministries
Retreat in the tiny community of Lake George, Fla., about 40 miles
west of Daytona Beach.
   Dawsey, who is pastor of the Church of God in the nearby
community of Salt Springs, Fla., said Bakker arrived Wednesday at
the 30-acre retreat.
   Under terms of his bail, he was allowed to travel to Florida. On
Friday, a federal magistrate in Charlotte gave him permission to
move there.
   Dawsey would not say whether Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, or other
family members were staying at the retreat.
   ``It's a place for ministers to come and rest and recuperate,''
Dawsey said in a telephone interview. ``Most pastors that come here
have been hurt or devastated or have emotional problems or
distress.''
   Bakker received the go-ahead to move to Florida after U.S.
Magistrate Paul Taylor was told Bakker has found a location in Lake
George to live and to broadcast the ``Jim and Tammy'' show, at
least temporarily.
   The Bakkers had been broadcasting his show from the living room
of their home outside Pineville, N.C., near Charlotte. But they
were told the operation violated Mecklenburg County's zoning
ordinance and must cease by May 7.
   Bakker resigned from the PTL ministry in March 1987 after a 1980
tryst with a church secretary, Jessica Hahn, and subsequent
payments to her were revealed. The Assemblies of God later stripped
him of his ministerial credentials, and the PTL ministry filed for
protection under the bankruptcy laws.
   In December, Bakker and his former top PTL aide, Richard Dortch,
were indicted on mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy charges
stemming from a 16-month federal grand jury probe into PTL and its
fund-raising practices.
   Bakker, who is free on $50,000 bond, must agree to conditions
outlined by Taylor, according to court documents obtained by The
Charlotte Observer.
   Bakker cannot leave Florida without permission from court
officials and he must maintain weekly and monthly contact by
telephone and in person with court officials in Jacksonville.
   Dawsey said the retreat had no broadcasting facilities and
couldn't comment on where Bakker planned to tape his show.
   Neither Bakker nor his attorney could be reached for comment
Saturday. Dawsey said Bakker would not take telephone calls at the
retreat. There was no answer Saturday at the Charlotte home of
Bakker attorney Harold Bender.

<HEAD>Two Cubans End Nine Years Of Asylum in Peruvian Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Cubans who gained asylum in the Peruvian
Embassy nine years ago have returned home after receiving
government assurances they will be allowed to leave the country,
diplomatic sources said Saturday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Felino
Ramirez Batista, 58, and Eduardo Herrera Dia, 39, left the embassy
Friday after accepting a promise by the Cuban government that they
will be permitted to emigrate within six months.
   Their departure brought to an end a series of events that began
in the spring of 1980 and culminated in the Mariel boat lift, when
125,000 Cubans fled to the United States between April and
September.
   The two were among some 10,000 Cubans who entered the Peruvian
Embassy in early April 1980 hoping to leave their island homeland
and its communist government.
   The people packed into the embassy after Cuba removed its
security guards from outside the complex because of a dispute with
Peru.
   Virtually all of the Cubans in the Peruvian Embassy were allowed
to leave the country. President Fidel Castro's government opened
the port of Mariel to Cubans wishing to emigrate to the United
States and the massive exodus began.
   But Ramirez and Herrera refused to leave the embassy, fearing
they would be arrested.
   A companion, Pedro Betancourt, 30, left the embassy last October
and departed for Canada two weeks ago, and that apparently gave the
two holdouts confidence they could leave the grounds safely and
then emigrate, a Peruvian consular official said.
   In an effort to break the deadlock over Ramirez and Herrera, the
Cuban and Peruvian governments signed an agreement last May under
which Cuba promised to allow them to emigrate within six months of
their departure from the embassy.
   But the two questioned Cuba's assurances and they staged a
hunger strike during a visit in September by officials of the U.N.
Human Rights Commission.
   The Peruvian Embassy provided the two Cubans with food and
clothing during their stay. The two spent much of their time in the
embassy working on a vegetable garden.

<HEAD>Socialist Premier Launches Election Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou on Saturday
launched his election campaign by defending his government's
handling of a multimillion-dollar banking scandal.
   Speaking before tens of thousands of his supporters in this
central port city, Papandreou said he was confident his ruling
Panhellenic Socialist Movement would be re-elected to another
four-year term in the June 18 elections.
   ``The government and I personally set into motion all the
procedures provided by the constitution to clear up the scandal,''
Papandreou said.
   His socialist government has been accused of involvement in the
financial scandal surrounding fugitive Greek banker George
Koskotas, jailed in the United States pending an extradition
hearing.
   It was Papandreou's first appearance at a mass public rally
since his return from open-heart surgery in London in October.
   He was first elected to office in 1981, and again in 1985.
   The main conservative opposition New Democracy party said in a
statement that Papandreou ``tried with his April Fool's Day speech
to present a restored picture'' of himself and his party.
   ``Nothing he said deserves special comment,'' the statement said.
   The banking scandal and the 70-year-old premier's open affair
with a 34-year-old former airline stewardess have hurt his standing
considerably among voters, according to recent public opinion polls.
   Papandreou has dismissed the scandal as a ``foreign and domestic
plot'' to overthrow his government.
   Koskotas, former chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled Greece last
November after being indicted in a $200 million fraud, forgery and
embezzlement scandal. He was arrested in the United States.
   In interviews from jail in Salem, Mass., he has claimed that
Papandreou and other senior government officials received millions
of dollars in payoffs and authorized the looting of his bank.

<TEXT>
   A police officer who fatally shot three
suspects in six months was fired over two notches found etched into
his pistol.
   Bryan Farrell, who was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing in
each of the shootings, was fired by Arlington Police Chief David
Kunkle on Friday after investigators probing the third killing
found the notches on the gun.
   Farrell, 25, who insisted that he knew nothing about the nicks
discovered on the trigger guard of his 9mm pistol, was fired
because the police chief didn't believe him, police spokesman Dee
Anderson said.
   Anderson stopped short of saying whether investigators believed
the marks represented a death tally. He refused to describe the
markings, except to say they were similar.
   Farrell's attorney, Jim Lane, told The Dallas Morning News that
he would meet with Kunkle on Monday to urge him to reconsider.
   The markings were discovered by Dallas police investigators
probing the killing of Michael Robinson, 21, who was fatally shot
by Farrell while being served a warrant Feb. 1 in University Park,
near downtown Dallas.
   Robinson was wanted on a forgery charge.
   Farrell also killed Ray Soto Jr., 32, of Arlington, as the man
sat in his pickup truck and raised a handgun toward Farrell and a
fellow officer on Aug. 2, 1988.
   Less than three weeks later, Farrell shot 33-year-old Martin
Williams during a struggle that occurred along Interstate 30 in
Fort Worth.
   The same gun, a Browning 9mm semiautomatic pistol, was used in
all three shootings, Anderson said.
   The gun was recovered by investigators after each shooting, but
the marks weren't discovered until Dallas police probed the third
shooting, he said.
   ``These markings and their possible inference were obviously
very troublesome to us,'' Anderson said at a news conference to
announce the officer's dismissal.
   In September, a Tarrant County grand jury declined to indict
Farrell in the first two shootings. In March, a Dallas County grand
jury, which knew about the markings on the pistol, cleared him of
any wrongdoing in the latest shooting.
   According to police records, Farrell has said that the pistol
had been at a gunsmith shop on several occasions and that he had
let friends shoot it.
   Anderson said the investigation would continue until police
learned who put the marks on the gun, what they signify and how
they were made.

   The Navy frigate Samuel B. Roberts,
severely damaged by a mine while on patrol in the Persian Gulf
nearly a year ago, returned to the water in Portland harbor
Saturday.
   The Roberts has been drydocked at the Bath Iron Works overhaul
yard in Portland since December while crews repaired the vessel's
midsection and installed a new main engine room.
   The 3,600-ton guided missile frigate, which was built by BIW,
struck a mine on April 14, 1988 after completing a convoy operation
for a reflagged Kuwaiti tanker.
   Company spokesman Jim McGregor said repairs were completed about
a week ahead of schedule. The Roberts is scheduled to rejoin the
Navy fleet late this year.

<HEAD>Press Institute Calls For Release Of Two Romanian Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Press Institute has urged
Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu to free two journalists
accused of printing leaflets critical of Ceausescu's leadership.
   The letter from institute director Peter Galliner called for the
immediate release of Petre Mihai Bacanu and Anton Uncu, who were
arrested in January in Bucharest.
   ``We ask for immediate assurance of their well-being and request
that they are allowed access to family and legal aid,'' Gallinger
said in the letter that was released Friday.
   It called the arrests ``violations of human and professional
rights and freedom of expression.''
   Bacanu and Uncu were reporters for the government newspaper
Romania Libera. Arrested with them were Mihai Creanga, a theater
critic with the magazine Romania Pitoreasca, and Alexandru Ghiroiu,
a linotypist at the Casa Scinteii publishing firm. The institute
letter mentioned only Bacanu and Uncu.
   The four have been held in pretrial custody.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, said last week, ``Allegedly they (the four
defendants) have been subjected to physical and psychological
pressure and have been denied access to lawyers and their
families.''
   It said the four may be charged with ``propaganda against the
socialist state.'' Conviction carries a maximum sentence of 15
years in jail.
   No date for the trial has been announced.
   The London-based International Press Institute is an
organization representing nearly 2,000 publishers and editors in 60
countries.

   Three more bodies were found Saturday
on an abandoned ranch about 1,000 yards south of the U.S. border,
bringing to 12 the number of dead in a suspected drug ring
reprisal, officials said.
   Also Saturday, a spokesman for the Sonoran Attorney General's
office said authorities believe an American is behind the killings.
Spokesman Jose Luis Peraza also said two people have been detained
for questioning.
   The three bodies were found in a well where five other victims
were found earlier in the week, said Tom Petropoulos, a homicide
detective with the Pima County (Ariz.) Sheriff's office. Four other
bodies were found in a nearby septic tank.
   Petropoulos said the three bodies found Saturday were all
Mexican men believed to be in their 20s, and all showed signs of
being strangled.
   Petropoulos, who has been assisting Mexican officials in the
investigation, said earlier he had never seen anything like a
bathroom in an abandoned house on the ranch where some of the
victims were believed to have been tortured.
   ``There's a strong smell of death in the air. It's a very
terrible thing, a very gruesome scene. Blood was splattered and
strewn, you can tell there was a lot of suffering here,''
Petropoulos said.
   This Mexican border city of about 75,000 residents has emerged
over the past two years as the center of ``Cocaine Alley,'' because
of the increased drug trafficking through the area.
   Mexican officials say they believe the slayings are drug
related, but stopped short of connecting the slayings here with the
mass murder of five men in Tucson last weekend.
   Two of the Tucson victims were from Nogales, Mexico, one from
Hermosillo and two from Tucson.
   Tucson Police said they are still trying to determine if the
slayings in the two cities, about 130 miles apart, are linked.
   Mexican officials have said two of those arrested told state
judicial police that the killings were related to the disappearance
of more than 220 pounds of drugs in recent weeks.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy said Saturday that two
U.S. military helicopters delivered food, medical supplies and
doctors to Guatemalans living in an isolated mountain area.
   Embassy spokesman John Treacy told The Associated Press that the
Guatemalan military asked for the helicopters to transport supplies
to more than 1,500 people in an area in Quiche province 160 miles
north of Guatemala City.
   Thousands of people remain in the isolated area where they fled
in the early 1980s to avoid fighting between security forces and
rebels. The Guatemalan military says leftist guerrillas still
operate in the area.
   Treacy said the helicopters, based in Honduras, arrived in
Guatamala March 26 and returned to Honduras three days later after
carrying food, medicine, construction material and medical
personnel to Quiche.
   The United States agreed to the Guatemalan request because there
are no roads to the area and the Guatemalan army did not have the
helicopters to move the needed supplies, he said.

<HEAD>GAO Recommends Higher Medicare Penalties for Poor Quality Health
Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government study recommends a new penalty
structure for doctors who provide poor quality care to Medicare
patients.
   The General Accounting Office said the current system of
limiting penalties to the amount of the cost to Medicaid sometimes
results in penalties that are disproportionately low compared with
the nature of the offense.
   For example, in one case the report said a doctor endangered a
cardiac patient by releasing her from the hospital although she
showed symptoms of a second heart attack. Because there was no
additional cost to the Medicare program stemming from the doctor's
negligence, no financial penalty could be imposed, GAO said.
   GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, recommended that the
cost-based limit be replaced by a fixed upper limit on the size of
monetary penalties. It did not recommend where the limit should be
set.
   The GAO said that in July 1987, the inspector general of the
Department of Health and Human Services advised peer review
organizations not to recommend financial penalties unless the
Medicare provider had displayed a pattern of poor care and a
significant amount of Medicare payment to the doctor was involved.
   The inspector general has since decided to drop that criteria,
the GAO said, but as of February there had been no formal
notification to halt the July 1987 criteria.

   How do you erect a 19-story building in New York
City?
   Start with a 31-story structure. Discover zoning prohibits a
building that big. Lose a three-year court battle. And receive an
order to lop 12 stories off.
   Welcome to 108 E. 96th St., the multi-million-dollar high-rise
set to shrink this month in the final act of a showdown between
local activists and its developer, Parkview Associates. David
defeated Goliath last week when the city ruled the 31-story edifice
must lose its top dozen floors.
   The decision will cost the developer about $10 million in
addition to the fought-over floors, leaving the building owners a
little queasy as they ponder continuing their fight to save those
stories.
   ``We're going to take a while to digest this decision,'' said
Jay A. Segal, attorney for Parkview Associates. ``We won't make any
decision for a week or two.''
   The city last week also dealt with a second Manhattan building
found to be too tall. The 811-foot CitySpire project on West 54th
Street was erected 14 feet above what zoning ordinances allow.
   But officials spared the building a steel haircut. Developer Ian
Bruce Eichner won a compromise agreement in which he will build a
$2.5 million dance studio in return for a variance.
   Parkview's $10 million loss includes the cost of chopping off
the illegal floors, the income from the lost apartments and the
cost of the building's extended vacancy. The building remains
uninhabited; it would have been ready to open in late 1986.
   The odds don't look good for Parkview, which has unsuccessfully
taken its battle to preserve the high-rise to the city, local
court, state court and U.S. Supreme Court.
   The city rejected a Parkview proposal to build about 40
low-income senior citizen apartments in East Harlem in return for a
zoning variance leaving the building intact.
   Parkview has until April 27 to appeal its most recent loss; the
developer's last option is a lawsuit against the city charging that
the too-tall ruling was arbitrary and capricious, Segal said.
   Should Parkview decide not to appeal, the demolition will begin
posthaste after that date, said city Buildings Department spokesman
Vahe Tiryakian.
   ``They have 30 days to appeal, and we're obliged to give 'em
that,'' Tiryakian said. ``We'll have to wait and see what happens.''
   While the developers worry about the cost of destroying 12
floors, many residents of the well-to-do area couldn't be happier
about Tuesday's unanimous decision by the city Board of Standards
and Appeals.
   ``We're really very, very pleased. We feel that after this
almost three-year battle, this was the right result,'' said Genie
Rice, president of the local community group Civitas.
   It was Ms. Rice who first noticed the 31-story building violated
a 1973 regulation putting a 19-floor cap on the area's skyline.
Developer Albert Ginsburg, in getting a permit for the structure,
used an incorrect zoning map.
   When the error was discovered in 1986, workers had already
completed the building's concrete superstructure, installed
elevator shafts to the 27th floor and finished wiring and plumbing
for the first 24 stories.
   All that is due to come down now: workers would attack the top
12 floors as if taking down an old building, starting at the top
floor and dismantling things one story at a time.
   When the work is completed, Ms. Rice said, residents of the new
building will be greeted by some very happy neighbors.
   ``As far as we're concerned, we're ready to celebrate the
opening of a new 19-story building,'' Ms. Rice said after the
board's decision. ``That would be wonderful.''

   Picket line skirmishers with clubs and
chains damaged 10 police cars and a driver crashed a steel plant
gate Saturday after more than 1,600 union steelworkers at Gulf
States Steel Inc. went on strike.
   Several security guards at the plant sustained minor injuries,
but state police said they didn't know how or when the guards were
hurt.
   Workers began walking off their jobs after the old contract
expired at midnight Friday. Four to eight pickets were at each of
the plant's eight gates and no one crossed the picket lines, union
spokesman Allen Stanford said.
   Stanford said there was ``just shouting back and forth but no
one was hurt'' in a picket line skirmish early Saturday, but police
said 10 of their cars were damaged by clubs and chains and the
tires on two units were slashed.
   Around 3 a.m., police said, a motorist drove a van into a gate,
destroying it, and then rammed a nearby small guardhouse, partially
knocking it off its foundation. Police would not say whether the
driver was arrested.
   Despite the violence, state police Lt. James Hyatt characterized
picketing as ``very orderly most of the day.'' He said state
troopers would be available through the night to assist city police.
   Hyatt said troopers had made one arrest in connection with the
strike. He said a man who was with the strikers at a plant gate was
charged with failing to obey a lawful order and carrying a
concealed weapon, a can of chemical Mace. Thermon Phillips,
director of District 36 of the United Steelworkers of America, said
he was unsure if supervisors were operating the plant, which makes
steel plate and finished steel.
   Company officials said they would have no comment Saturday.
   Phillips said he expected an agreement to be reached ``within a
day or so'' if negotiations continued as they have. Negotiatiors
were meeting with federal mediators in Birmingham.
   Earl Guyton, vice-president of United Steelworkers of America
Local 2176, said negotiators had made some progress and would
continue working toward an agreement with the maker of steel plate
and finished steel.
   Guyton said negotiations reached an impasse over several issues:
wages, profit sharing, health care costs and contracting work in
the plant to outside contractors.
   Some 2,100 people work at the steel plant in Gadsen, about 50
miles northwest of Birmingham. About 1,650 are union members.
   The lapsed three-year contract went into effect after The
Brenlin Group of Ohio bought the plant under provisions of a
court-ordered sale. Several attempts since September 1987 to reach
a new work agreement have failed.
   Guyton said members of Local 2176, which represents production
and maintenance workers, and USWA Local 4382, which represents
clerical workers, would meet Sunday at a local community college to
discuss the strike.

<TEXT>
   A White House official said Saturday it
would be ``highly inappropriate'' for the United States to hold
discussions with the Soviet Union on a framework for change in
Eastern Europe.
   ``I am not enthusiastic about that approach,'' Robert M. Gates,
deputy assistant to President Bush for national security affairs,
told an international conference,
   Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, expressed reservations about trying
``to control the course of events'' in Soviet-dominated Eastern
Europe.
   They spoke at the Quadrangular Forum sponsored by the
Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies and the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
   Their remarks were in response to recent reports that the Bush
administration is studying a proposal by former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger on Eastern Europe.
   According to those reports the proposal would be for the Kremlin
to ease its political and military grip on Eastern Europe in
exchange for Western assuances not to take advantage of the
situation to threaten Soviet security.
   Gates, asked about the proposal, said the Bush administration is
still conducting foreign policy reviews.
   He added he believed that ``any discussion with the Soviet Union
over Eastern Europe in a bilateral context would be highly
inappropriate.''
   It also would not be appropriate from the standpoint of
America's allies or Eastern Europeans, he said.
   Woerner said the West should discuss the future of Eastern
Europe with Soviet officials and added: .
   ``We will continue to respect legitimate Soviet security
interests. But we cannot, and should not, try to patronize
developments in the East.''
   Gates urged a cautious approach in dealing with the changes
under way in the Soviet Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We cannot _ and should not _ close our eyes to momentous
developments in the U.S.S.R. But we should not make concessions
based on hope and popular enthusiasms in the West or attractive
personalities in the U.S.S.R.,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Almost two-thirds of Israeli Jews say talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization are inevitable in the next
five years, but an overwhelming majority oppose beginning peace
negotiations now, The New York Times reported in its Sunday
editions.
   According to a poll conducted in Israel March 23-28 for the
Times, only 18 percent said negotiations should now be started on
the basis of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's recent statement that he
recognized Israel's right to exist in the Middle East.
   But 62 percent said such talks are inevitable in the next five
years.
   And 58 percent _ the highest number since the question was first
asked almost six years ago _ say they would be willing to open
talks with the PLO if it ``officially recognizes Israel and ceases
terrorist activities.
   Regardless of whether they approved of the idea, 44 percent said
they thought a Palestinian state in part or all of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip was inevitable in the next 10 or 20 years.
   Only 37 percent said they thought it was possible for Israel to
live in peace with a Palestinian state in those territories. More
than half, 54 percent, however, said Israel should be willing to
give up some territory in exchange for ``suitable guarantees,'' up
from 41 percent two years ago.
   Nearly three-fourths, 72 percent, said they saw no contradiction
between the army's handling of the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories, which emphasizes the use of force, and ``the
nation's democratic values.''
   The house-to-house survey of 1,096 Israeli Jews has a margin of
sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   Europe's Ariane-2 rocket, after a
24-hour delay, lifted a communications satellite for Finland,
Sweden and Norway into Earth orbit Saturday night.
   The rocket was launched from the European Space Agency center at
Kourou on the northern coast of South America.
   Arianespace officials announced 20 minutes after the launch that
the mission was completed successfully, with the TELE-X satellite
placed in orbit.
   The launch had been scheduled for Friday night but was postponed
by a last-minute malfunction of the ground computer system.
   The satellite, a program of the three Nordic governments, is to
provide direct television broadcasts to home satellite dishes and
business communications between ground terminals.
   Swedish Space Corp. is overseeing the program. The satellite,
owned by Nordic Satellite Co., is to serve up to 5,000 business
users.
   Officials said the television signals will be powerful enough to
be received by an antenna just 12 inches in diameter. Programming
has not yet been lined up for the broadcasts.
   Arianespace is in charge of production, marketing and launches
of the Ariane rockets developed by the 13-nation European Space
Agency. Norway and Sweden are among the member states while Finland
is an associate member state.
   Arianespace carried out seven missions last year as well as
successful launches on Jan. 26 and March 6 this year.
   There are 33 satellites on the Arianespace order book for future
launches. The European consortium has captured about half of the
world market for commercial satellite launches.

   A blue cloud of pot smoke drifted over
the University of Michigan campus Saturday from about 1,000 high
school and college students at the 19th annual Hash Bash rally for
the legalization of marijuana.
   Nobody was arrested, but 15 people got tickets for possession of
marijuana, a misdemeanor carrying a $5 fine, said Ann Arbor police
Capt. Gary Kistka.
   Many of the assemblage were denim-clad and huffed and puffed on
homemade smokes as speakers told the crowd that marijuana should be
legalized. Behind them stretched a banner with golden arches
similar to the McDonald's hamburger trademark that read:
``Marijuana. Over 10 Billion Stoned.''
   ``There are a lot of people you wouldn't expect to see here,''
said Brad Wylie, 19, a freshman from Livonia who said he doesn't
smoke marijuana. ``I saw some in business suits and many are clean
cut. It makes you realize (marijuana) is more widespread.''
   This year, youngsters from suburban high schools drove to the
university's campus to light up in what has become an April Fools'
Day tradition, Kistka said.
   ``Most of the people there were high schoolers from the Detroit
suburbs out for a party,'' Kistka said, calling the bash a nuisance
for officers. ``We'd prefer not to be there,'' he said. ``But if
they're going to have it, we have to be there in case something
happens.''
   The crowd cheered when members of the National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws said legalizing marijuana would make
the drug more affordable.
   ``Government policies are designed to stigmatize marijuana,''
said Jon Gettman, national director for NORML. ``Demonstrations
like this are fundamental to seeking change.''

   Westinghouse took over management of the
troubled Savannah River Plant on Saturday and immediately renamed
the nuclear weapons facility the Savannah River Site.
   Jack Herrmann, a Westinghouse spokesman, said the new name is
``basically symbolic.''
   Under the former operator, DuPont Corp., the operations,
laboratory and construction departments all reported to different
managers. The name Savannah River Plant was used by the company as
a reference to operations only.
   Under Westinghouse, those departments all report to the same man
_ James Moore, president of Westinghouse Savannah River Co. ``We're
just trying to develop better cohesion,'' Hermann said.
   The three reactors at the plant, which makes nuclear weapons
grade plutonium and tritium, have been idle for nearly a year
because of safety and structural problems.

   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who ousted
dictator Alfredo Stroessner in a coup two months ago, was nominated
for president Saturday by the governing Colorado Party.
   Elections are set for May 1.
   Colorado Party President Juan Ramon Chaves had endorsed
Rodriguez several weeks ago and his nomination by more than 1,000
delegates at the party convention was assured.
   Rodriguez, 65, ended Gen. Stroessner's 34-year rule with the
Feb. 3 coup and Stroessner is now living in exile in Brazil.
   The Colorado Party has been in power since 1947 and claims 1.4
million members among Paraguay's population of less than 4 million.
Its endorsement makes Rodriguez the front-runner and opposition
candidates acknowledge they have little chance to defeat him.
   The Colorados also are almost certain to control Congress. Under
the law, the party that wins a majority of votes automatically
receives two-thirds of the 36 seats in the Senate and the 72 seats
in the Chamber of Deputies.

   Gene Kelly, the quintessential song-and-dance
man, was in fair condition Saturday and recuperating quickly at a
hospital after he cancelled a weekend performance because of
pneumonia.
   ``He's walking around and will probably be released Monday,''
said Cedars-Sinai hospital spokesman Ron Wise.
   Kelly, 76, entered the hospital and was admitted under a
pseudonym Wednesday. ``He came in quietly,'' Wise said. ``His
physicians didn't want him to be bothered by phone calls or
visitors.''
   The illness forced the actor-dancer to cancel a performance of
his one-man show ``Evening with Gene Kelly'' at the La Mirada Civic
Center Friday night.
   Theater spokeswoman Beverly Hamlin said the performance was not
rescheduled and refunds would be given to 1,300 fans. Kelly has
appeared in such films as ``Hello Dolly,'' ``American in Paris,''
and ``Anchors Aweigh.''

   A mother shot and wounded her 30-year-old son,
described as a longtime drug addict, during an argument in their
Queens home, police said Saturday.
   Charles Papadakos was in stable condition at Booth Memorial
Hospital Saturday after being shot once in the upper chest, said

   The victim's mother, Catherine Papadakos, who is in her 50s, was
arrested after the shooting late Friday and charged with attempted
murder and criminal possession of a dangerous weapon, said Sgt.
Peter Berry, a police spokesman.
   ``What a hard worker that woman,'' said Gary Gelorum, a
neighbor. ``She was a school aide and she broke her back fixing up
that house and taking care of those kids.''
   She and her son were arguing in their home at 11:15 p.m., when
he threatened her and she responded by shooting him with a
.22-caliber revolver, the sergeant said.
   Berry said he did not know the nature of their dispute, nor how
Papadakos threatened his mother. ``Apparently the son was a
longtime drug addict,'' he said. Police said they recovered the
revolver.

<TEXT>
   Authorities appealed to an anonymous
tipster Saturday to step forward with information about the latest
of eight women's bodies to be found along local highways.
   The unidentified informant wrote a letter to District Attorney
Ronald Pina about two weeks ago saying a woman's body could be
found along state Route 88.
   Authorities searched without finding the body, but two boys
found the skeletal remains of a woman on Friday about 25 feet off
Route 88 in Westport, just south of where investigators had been
looking.
   Officials have been trying since last fall to solve the mystery
surrounding womens' bodies that have been found since July along
three local highways. The seventh body was discovered Tuesday off
Route 140 in Freetown.
   Investigators say they have established a link between the seven
identified victims and prostitution or drugs in New Bedford's Weld
Square area.
   Pina said the most recent victim, like the others, was
apparently a young woman. She remained unidentified after an
autopsy Saturday.
   Jim Martin, a spokesman for Pina, said the remains would be
given to a forensic specialist who would examine dental records and
perform further tests early next week.
   Pina said the tipster's letter said the author would consider
coming forward if the body was found. Martin said authorities were
strongly urging the informant to do so.
   Investigators have said they have four suspects in the case, but
so far no arrests have been made.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $1 billion sale of United Artists to an
Australian company was the biggest in a series of moves by foreign
companies to gobble up successful American entertainment firms.
   United Artists, which produced the Oscar-winning ``Rain Man,''
joined the legion of foreign-owned companies that now includes CBS
Records, MTM Enterprises, Atlantic Entertainment, Cannon Group and
New World Pictures.
   In another reported Hollywood deal-in-the-making, MCA President
Sidney Sheinberg declined to comment Saturday on a report that
Japan's Sony Corp. was negotiating to acquire his entertainment
conglomerate, which owns Universal Studios.
   ``I'm not talking about anything to do with Sony,'' Sheinberg
said Saturday night at the American Cinamatheque's annual benefit,
The Moving Picture Ball. ``We're not commenting.''
   KNX-AM News Radio, a CBS affiliate, reported that executives of
MCA and Sony met Friday at the New Otani Hotel in Los Angeles to
wrap up a deal in which the Japanese electronics firm would acquire
MCA.
   The station, without revealing its source, reported that no
dollar amount was disclosed, but that MCA is worth an estimated
$2.5 billion. The station said the deal would be formally announced
Monday.
   Under the United Artists deal announced Friday, Australia's
Qintex Group has agreed to purchase all outstanding stock of UA's
parent company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer_United Artists.
   Qintex, best known in the United States as one of the makers of
the CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove,'' also would get the United
Artists moviemaking group and its film library.
   But MGM-UA's major stockholder, Kirk Kerkorian, would retain
control of the MGM name and TV and movie studios, as well as 34 MGM
movies, including ``Moonstruck'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda.''
   The MGM-UA deal, if approved, would mark the first time a major
Hollywood studio passed into predominantly foreign ownership.
Australian Rupert Murdoch became a U.S. citizen before buying a
controlling interest in 20th Century Fox in 1985.
   But MGM-UA would not be the only entertainment company to be
bought by a foreign company.
   MTM Enterprises was acquired for $310 million in July by British
broadcaster Television South PLC and Atlantic Entertainment went to
Australian businessman Alan Saffron in December.
   Italian producers Giancarlo Parretti and Florio Fiorini also
have been picking up some of Hollywood, including the small studios
Cannon Group and New World Pictures.
   The UA-MGM deal, and the foreign invasion in general, have
sparked the concern of at least one American network official, who
questioned the fairness of federal regulations that forbid the
networks from making the same kind of deals open to overseas firms.
   Rules drafted in the early 1970s, when the networks were the
only television game in town and cable and pay-for-view were still
about a decade away, prohibit the networks from going into the
production business.
   ``Our view is that it is increasingly ironic and shortsighted to
have policies on the books which allow foreign interests to
dominate entertainment production while America's most logical
competitors, the networks, continue to be shut out,'' said Joe
Rutledge, director of corporate communications for NBC.

<HEAD>Vietnam's Communist Party Will Tolerate No Challenge To Its Authority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's Communist Party leadership
has reaffirmed a need for reform but declared it will not tolerate
any challenges to its authority or basic principles.
   Comprehensive reform requires efforts to ``broaden socialist
democracy,'' but the party must tread carefully, party chief Nguyen
Van Linh told a March 20-29 conference of the Central Committee.
   Radio Hanoi, in a report Saturday on the plenum , quoted Linh as
saying:
   ``All attempts aimed at weakening or nullifying the party's
leadership and creating political counterweights to the party in
society must definitely be checked.''
   ``We do not allow those who take advantage of democracy and
openness to attack the party and its leadership,'' he said. ``It is
necessary to clearly distinguish constructive criticism from
mud-slinging and instigating attempts aimed at lowering the
prestige of the party and state.''
   The broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, reported Linh said the
leadership advocates enhancing the roles of state-supervised mass
organizations and of elected organs like the National Assembly.
   ``We advocate broadening democracy and reaching a consensus
through debate, but we do not tolerate pluralism,'' he declared.
   Linh's speech closed the Central Committee's sixth plenum, held
to review reforms endorsed at the national party congress in 1986.
   Linh became party chief at the congress and three leaders
identified with old policies retired.
   But Western analysts said party conservatives remain concerned
that reforms may erode the dominant position of the party that
achieved power after decades of fighting the French, Japanese and
Americans and South Vietnamese anti-communists.
   Radio Hanoi reported Linh told the Central Committee that the
party must avoid prejudice against private enterprises but also
must not favor them ``without realizing their limits and
spontaneity, which leads to lack of close management control.''
   Without giving details, the broadcast reported Linh said the
state will promulgate laws stipulating which industries cannot be
run by private individuals.
   Linh said Vietnam's development requires increased commercial
ties with non-socialist nations but that while ties were being
expanded the party must watch out for ``negative influences.''
   ``Once our door is open, not only will the pure and healthy air
come in but dust, flies, and mosquitos also will follow,'' he said.
   A Central Committee communique, also carried by Radio Hanoi,
said reforms were designed not to change the goal of socialism but
to achieve it more quickly.
   It said the reform of the political system ``is meant to
strengthen the party's role of leadership and the state's
managerial efficacy and the people's right to mastery.''
   The communique blamed the uneven pace of reform on the ``many
shortcomings'' of the party leadership and the state, with
authorities slow to implement party resolutions and to make needed
changes in the party and state structures.
   In his comments on the economy, Linh blamed inflation on the low
output of state-run enterprises and the government's policy of
subsidizing key areas of the economy.
   He said results of the reforms began to become visible in the
third quarter of 1988 with more consumer goods and foodstuffs
available, less strain in the grain supply and a slowing of the
rate of price increases.

   Korn was director of telephone laboratories at the former

<TEXT>
   Washington's journalistic establishment
lampooned President Bush at a white-tie dinner Saturday night as a
``pistol-packin' poppy'' whose idea of a kinder, gentler nation is
``a cop on ev'ry corner and a gun in ev'ry hand.''
   Bush's wife Barbara nearly stole the show with a grand entrance.
Her snowy white hair was covered with a golden brown wig making the
woman known as ``The Silver Fox'' almost unrecognizable.
   Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle were prime targets of the
104-year-old Gridiron Club, whose annual dinner is one of the
biggest social events in the capital. The main business of the
evening was to spoof the president and other prominent figures with
humor designed to ``singe but never burn.''
   By tradition, the responses by Bush and Quayle to the club
members' satirical barbs were off the record.
   Yet just as traditionally that rule is ignored.
   Bush cracked ``people say I'm undecisive. I don't know about
that.'' Belittling his own skill at humor Bush said that if he had
been funnier than Ronald Reagan in 1980 _ when the two men competed
for the Republican presidential nomination _ it would have been
Reagan who was ``up here tonight trying to laugh off the Bush
deficit.''
   Quayle was the target of many jokes about his inexperience
however he said that Bush recently praised his maturity and sense
of responsibility by saying ``would you like a puppy'' from the
brood delivered by first dog Millie.
   More than 600 invited guests included the journalists' bosses
and a cross-section of the Washington power elite, including
Supreme Court justices, Cabinet members, members of Congress,
governors and foreign ambassadors and their wives.
   Gridiron president Lawrence M. O'Rourke of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch set the irreverent tone for the evening. Commenting
good-naturedly on accomplishments of the Bush presidency, he asked
in a prepared speech, ``What previous administration could say
after 100 days that it had a new horseshoe pit?''
   Then club members, portraying their victims in a series of
satirical skits, roasted Bush, Quayle and other prominent figures,
including Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, former Texas John
Tower, House Speaker Jim Wright, White House chief of staff John
Sununu, billionaire developer Donald Trump and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
   A highlight of the prepared script was Barbara Bush, played by
Cheryl Arvidson of the Dallas Times Herald, who chided her husband
for his initial opposition to controls on semiautomatic assault
weapons.
   ``Lay that Uzi down, George, lay that Uzi down,'' sang the
on-stage Mrs. Bush. ``Pistol-packin' poppy, lay that Uzi down.''
   Later, a journalist posing as a White House speechwriter sang
the ``Bush Battle Hymn'' with these words:
   ``Mine eyes have seen the glory of a kinder, gentler land,
   ``With a cop on ev'ry corner and a gun in ev'ry hand.
   ``Tiny tots in public schools will pledge allegiance on command,
   ``George Bush is in command.''
   Then the Gridiron chorus sang: ``Sis-boom-bah and hallelujah,
Eli Yale will boola-boo ya. Read my lips so I can rule ya. You
gotta read them right.''
   Quayle, played by Richard Cooper of the Los Angeles Times, took
his lumps in a duet with former President Nixon, portrayed by John
Hall of Media General.
   To the tune of ``I Believe In You,'' the Nixon stand-in sang:
   ``You're not the dim bulb I had been led to believe I would see.
   ``Are you an airhead dilettante lightweight? You sure could fool
me.
   ``Cause I believe in you, I believe in you.
   ``I think you're perfectly qualified,
   ``As the Veep, you're swell.
   ``All my concerns have been mollified
   ``If Bush stays well.''
   To which the chorus responds: ``George, stay well.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate who lost the
November election to Bush, was portrayed as Elvis Presley arriving
at St. No Where Hospital for a personality transplant.
   Joined by dancers in prison stripes, Dukakis sang a hip-swinging
version of ``Jailhouse Rock'' in which he lamented the day he gave
inmate Willie Horton a weekend furlough. Bush made the
Massachusetts prison furlough program a major campaign issue
against Dukakis.
   Two new active members, James M. Perry of the Wall Street
Journal and Robert Adams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, were
initiated into the 60-member club at Saturday's dinner, held in the
Capital Hilton Hotel.

   A man who was the focus of a child-abuse
investigation killed his live-in companion and a state police
detective who came to their home, then shot himself to death
Friday, authorities said.
   Detective Giles R. Landry and the woman, Barbara Wells, had been
talking in a police cruiser outside the couple's mobile home in
this rural central Maine town when they were shot to death at
around 10 a.m.
   The gunman, identified as David Grover Sr., 36, died later while
being transported from a Lewiston hospital to one in Portland.
   Grover and Ms. Wells had lived in the home for several years,
neighbors said. Although they had four children, only one _ an
18-year-old boy _ was living with them; the other children live
with relatives, state Public Safety Department spokesman Stephen
McCausland said.
   Grover was the subject of a child-abuse investigation that
involved a 9-year-old Leeds girl who was ``not a relative,''
McCausland said. He also said Grover had an ``extensive criminal
history.''
   At the time of the shootings, Landry had gone to the mobile home
to investigate the child abuse case, said state police Chief Andrew
E. Demers. Landry called for backup assistance but had given no
indication of an impending emergency, Demers said.
   Grover, who neighbors said made a living selling merchandise at
flea markets, apparently shot Ms. Wells and Landry with a hunting
rifle that was found outside the home, police said. He then shot
himself in the head. The backup officer arrived minutes later.
   ``The police have been there so many times,'' said Janet
Beaupre, a next-door neighbor. ``He was always in trouble. I don't
know why she stayed with him.''
   Landry, 36, of Lewiston, a 13-year veteran of the state police
who was promoted last August, was the seventh member of the force
to be killed in the line of duty and the first since 1986.
   ``This is a very, very tragic day for the state police,''
McCausland said at an impromptu news briefing not far from the
scene.
   Gov. John R. McKernan said he was ``shocked and deeply
saddened'' by the tragedy.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives in
Havana Sunday for talks that focus attention on the contrast
between President Fidel Castro's doctrinaire Marxism and the
pragamatic reforms of his communist sponsor.
   It will be the Soviet leader's first visit to a Latin American
country and only his third meeting with Castro, who traveled to
Moscow for the 27th Communist Party Congress after Gorbachev took

   President Bush urged Venezuelan President
Carlos Andres Peres to press ahead with his economic reforms on
Saturday as the administration prepared to launch its Third World
debt reduction plan at a series of critical international financial
meetings.
   The breakfast session, held in the private White House quarters,
lasted 1{ hours and was ``very productive,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, national security advisor Brent Scowcroft, Vice
President Dan Quayle and White House chief of staff John Sununu
also attended the meeting, Fitzwater said.
   The group discussed the debt-induced turmoil that has plagued
Venezuela and other Third World nations and Perez described the
attempts he's been making to revamp his economy to deal with his
nation's $33 billion debt. Bush ``encouraged them to continue the
reform effort,'' the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Just When You Thought the Airline Business Was Settling Down...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines is mostly mothballed, and
Northwest Airlines is flying. But both are attracting bids from
billionaire business celebrities ranging from hoteliers to
Hollywood investors.
   People who saw ``Wall Street'' may have thought they were
watching real-life variants of the back-room maneuvering for the
movie's fictional Bluestar Airlines if they followed accounts of
Eastern and Northwest this past week.
   The cast of contenders included baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth, Hyatt hotel chain owner Jay Pritzker, property-casino
centurion Donald Trump and energy-entertainment investor Marvin
Davis.
   Others said to be involved, either as buyers or their lenders,
included takeover strategist Carl Icahn, who also is chairman of
Trans World Airlines, reclusive West Coast financier Kirk
Kerkorian, and David Batchelder, the former adviser to the dean of
the corporate stalkers, oilman T. Boone Pickens.
   Miami-based Eastern remained comatose, its fate unclear, planes
mostly grounded and assets increasingly mired in bankruptcy court
proceedings, with little sign from parent Texas Air Corp. that a
sale was close.
   A group led by Ueberroth had offered $464 million offer for the
airline, which prior to the March 4 strike flew 100,000 passengers
daily to 118 cities with 250 jetliners. Since then it has barely
managed a skeleton schedule.
   Pritzker reportedly offered a higher price, value unknown. But
Ueberroth's offer told a story in itself about the perceived worth
of Eastern, one of the nation's most unprofitable airlines.
   The Ueberroth deal was $200 million below the price Texas Air
paid three years ago, and barely $100 million over what Trump had
offered for Eastern's Northeast shuttle, which flies to only three
cities with about 20 planes.
   At Minneapolis-based Northwest, meanwhile, management was facing
a $2.7 billion, $90-a-share takeover offer from Davis, a second
offer of undisclosed value from a group the airline wouldn't
identify, and rumors that at least one other investor group was
preparing to make a bid.
   Not coincidentally, Northwest's parent company NWA Inc. erected
an anti-takeover ``poison pill'' shield to thwart unfriendly
acquirers by making it prohibitively expensive for them to sell any
of the airline's assets.
   The defense was designed to foil what many analysts have called
the airline's biggest weakness: lucrative operations in the
economically booming Asian Pacific region and a lagging domestic
business.
   As the 1980s takeover era has shown, that kind of unwieldy,
inefficient performance invites unsolicited offers from investors
who see profit in selling a company in pieces.
   A takeover of Northwest therefore raised the prospect of the
biggest airline bustup since deregulation, only three years after
NWA acquired hometown rival Republic Airlines for $884 million.
   In other business and economic developments this past week:
   _After months of rumor, a federal grand jury indicted Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond pioneer Michael Milken and two
others in the biggest fraud and racketeering case in Wall Street
history. The defendants asserted innocence in a case that reflected
the radical use of racketeering laws to prosecute white-collar
suspects. It also created a forum for a courtroom fight between
Milken and his main accuser, imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky.
   _More evidence emerged of a slowing economy. The Commerce
Department said the index of leading indicators fell 0.3 percent in
February, largely because of a drop in factory orders and
construction. The department also said home sales tumbled 9.4
percent in February.
   _A stunning failure and a surprise merger proposal roiled the
banking industry, reflecting the economy's disjointed regional
growth. Federal regulators seized most of Texas-based MCorp.'s 25
banks after it disclosed plans to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection. North Carolina's NCNB Corp. offered to acquire
Georgia's Citizens &amp; Souther Corp. in a stock-swap that would
create the country's sixth-largest banking company.
   _A monster Alaskan oil slick from a leaking Exxon Corp. tanker
that ran aground threatened the state's economy and coastal
wildlife. The nation's largest oil company fired the tanker's
skipper after saying tests showed he was legally drunk but faced a
torrent of criticism for its slow reaction to the worst oil spill
in U.S. history.

<HEAD>`Event Risk' Prompting Insurance Giants To Dump Corporate Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's called ``event risk,'' a euphemism for
things that can damage the value of an investment.
   Corporate takeovers, restructurings and other such risks are
prompting big life insurance companies to dump corporate bonds from
their portfolios.
   The trend could spell trouble for the corporate bond market,
since life insurance companies own about half the industrial bonds
outstanding, according to the American Council of Life Insurance.
   A recent survey by the trade group found that 66 of its member
companies had curtailed their purchase of certain high-grade
corporate bonds. The reason is the fear of takeovers and
restructurings of bond issuers that may damage the value of the the
bonds.
   Such corporate makeovers typically result in a company taking on
more debt. The increased debt load often prompts the bond-rating
companies, such as Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., to lower the ratings for the bonds because the increased
debt raises questions about the companies' ability to make good on
the bonds.
   And when a bond's rating is lowered, its price usually falls.
   When asked whether they experienced any investment losses due to
corporate restructurings since January 1986, 81 of the 108 life
insurance companies that responded to the February survey said yes.
   During the three-year period covered by the survey, the
insurance companies said the value of their corporate bonds dropped
12.6 percent because of corporate restructurings.
   ``Life insurers have a need for a good market and a good supply
of investment-grade corporate bonds,'' said Paul Reardon, director
of investment research for the council. He said the companies need
to ensure a steady stream of income from long-term investments such
as bonds in order to pay off their policy claims.
   ``But for a number of years, life insurance companies have
quietly been avoiding industrial bonds because of the problem of
event risk, which is something that is difficult to assess in
advance,'' he said in an interview last week.
   Reardon said life insurers had believed they could avoid
exposing their investments to these risks by buying only the
investment-grade bonds of the largest industrial companies, ``with
the hope that they would be too big to be the target of a takeover
attack.''
   But the leveraged buyout of tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco
Inc. earlier this year blew that belief out of the water.
   ``The RJR buyout was the event which brought it to a head
because it was so huge and it did result in large losses or
reduction in market value (of bonds) to some insurance companies,''
he said.
   Some life insurers did more than just fume about their losses.
They sued.
   The Hartford Insurance Group, the insurance unit of ITT Corp.,
filed suit in November against RJR Nabisco over its buyout plans.
The suit, which is pending, alleges the insurer lost about $2.25
million in the value of its $25 million worth of RJR Nabisco bonds
after the buyout was announced.
   ``We bought investment-grade securities in the spring, and by
the fall they were trading as junk bonds,'' said Edward N. Bennett,
the Hartford's chief investment officer.
   For some time before the RJR Nabisco buyout the Hartford had
been shifting out of corporate bonds, Bennett said. But that deal
accelerated the trend, he said.
   In place of corporate bonds, life insurers are turning to other
long-term investments, Bennett and Reardon said. These include the
mortgage-backed securities issued by several government agencies,
bonds issued by foreign governments and utility company bonds _
none of which is at risk for takeover.
   Reardon said the corporate bond market may not yet be feeling
the pinch from the changed investment stragegy of insurance
companies because few long-term industrial bonds have been issued
in recent months.
   But, he said, ``industrial companies will have to improve the
terms (of their bonds) when they come to the market in the future
when they market significantly larger quantities of debt.''
   One way companies can improve their bonds is to include
guarantees that they will not take on additional debt without
bondholder approval. Such guarantees, called covenants, are
becoming more common in corporate debt instruments as investors
grow more wary of takeover aftershock.
   But Bennett said he believed companies could find a way around
these covenants, and so they may not be worth all that much. The
lasting effect of the takeover craze, he said, may be the virtual
demise of long-term corporate debt financing.

<HEAD>A Positive, But Wary First Quarter For Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market overcame a welter of worries to
post some respectable gains in the first quarter of 1989.
   But misgivings about the financial and economic outlook are
still very much in evidence as Wall Streeters look ahead to the
remaining nine months of tho 10 percent range. If that kind of pace
could be sustained over a year or two, it would qualify as a robust
bull market.
   Yet little rejoicing has been heard in the investment community,
which still evidently hasn't quite gotten over the shock of the
crash that occurred a year and a half ago.
   ``Since the great crash there has been no consistent theme or
trend,'' said Edward Nicoski at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. He
describes the current mood of investors as one of ``pessimistic
hope.
   ``The pessimism calls for a slowing economy and rising
unemployment, whereas the hope is embedded in the belief this will
cool inflation, diminish our trade imbalance and lower interest
rates.
   ``The unlikelihood of all the preceding happening without a
meaningful recession and sharply lower corporate profits has not
gone unnoticed, however.''
   Increased recession worries were evident from the behavior of
diversified manufacturing, auto and machinery stocks, all of which
ranked among the 10 worst performing industry groups for the
quarter.
   In a compilation through March 29, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said
the manufacturing group was down 3.8 percent; the auto stocks
dropped 2.6 percent, and the machinery group lost 1.5 percent.
   Over the same period, S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 5.3
percent, not counting dividends.
   Earnings worries, meanwhile, weighed heavily on technology
stocks. The computer systems, electronic instrument, communications
equipment and semiconductor groups all finished in the minus column.
   Some of the big winners _ such as the airlines, up 17.8 percent,
and hospital management, up 20.2 percent _ got a lift from the
continuing boom in takeover and buyout bids.
   For its part, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, with a
50.58 rise to 2,293.62 in the past week, closed out the quarter
sporting a gain of 125.05 points, or 5.77 percent.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up 2.99 at 165.63; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market up 5.79 at 406.73, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index up 3.44 at 328.31.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 146.91 million shares a day,
against 148.40 million the week before.
   The crux of the market's problems right now, many analysts
agree, is persistently high interest rates.
   ``The current environment, in any historical perspective, is
unattractive for equities,'' said Edward Kerschner at PaineWebber
Inc.
   ``First, the relative safety of a guaranteed 10 percent one-year
return stacks up well against the returns the equity market MIGHT
deliver, even in the most benign environment.
   ``Second, the impact that these higher interest rates have in
both depressing the corporate revenue line and increasing the
corporate expense line suggests that the profit environment over
the next few quarters might be far from benign.
   ``High interest rates have historically been a harbinger of a
risky stock market, because they have been lead indicators of
earnings disappointments.''

   Shed no tears for Michael Milken or his firm, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., which has agreed to plead guilty to fraud rather than
face racketeering charges under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations law.
   These prosecutions have provoked misplaced criticism of the RICO
law.
   RICO critics argue that Drexel was unfairly induced to
capitulate. Supposedly, any other decision would have meant instant
ruin, since RICO allows assets to be frozen pretrial and forfeited
after conviction.
   No doubt Drexel felt pressured, but stress is inherent in the
plea negotiation process. Thus, street criminals often plead guilty
to avoid habitual offender charges. A more important issue is
whether Drexel is guilty. The answer must be yes, for no judge may
accept a baseless guilty plea. As the defense of ``good faith'' was
readily available, Drexel's megabuck legal team would not have
advised a groundless plea. Michael Milken now has the same defense
_ and others as well _ under RICO.
   Nor was Drexel abused by a pretrial asset freeze. This
procedure, incidentally, is not unique to RICO. Other laws provide
similar remedies comparable to bail bonds used to secure personal
appearances at trial. No evidence suggests forfeiture was
maliciously threatened. Moreover, prosecutors may not impose
forfeiture unilaterally. RICO requires proof of probable success at
trial and the risk of asset dissipation. Moreover, the court must
consider various equitable factors. And not all assets may be
frozen, only those needed to ensure funds for payoff upon
conviction.
   The government is also justified in seeking forfeiture.
Forfeiture takes the profit out of crime, a penalty that works well
against corporations which cannot be jailed. In Milken's case, the
alleged profits would make successful drug dealers envious. Surely
the narcotics crisis is not to be solved by encouraging drug
dealers to turn to securities fraud.
   Congress reserved RICO for criminals who engage in a PATTERN of
racketeering _ a requirement courts take seriously. Violators,
therefore, merit special sanctions. White collar defendants claim
to be unfairly stigmatized by the term racketeer. Perhaps
``swindler'' is more apt, but Congress properly considered white
collar crimes to be racketeering. The legislative record is replete
with references to corrupt businesses, including brokerage firms.
   Critics want to limit RICO to the Mafia. But white collar crime
exacts equally serious social costs, and, constitutionally, we
ought not tolerate efforts to confine racketeering laws to any
ethnic group.
   Thus, though the case against Milken remains to be proven, if
guilt is established, the RICO penalty would fit the crime.

   The Red Queen from ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' might
feel right at home in today's U.S. Justice Department. ``Sentence
first, verdict afterward,'' was her theory of jurisprudence, an
approach being adopted by overzealous Federal prosecutors with
regard to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO)
law.
   The RICO law, enacted in 1970, contains two provisions to help
prosecutors fight the kind of organized crime I used to cover as a
young reporter at the Elizabeth (N.J.) Daily Journal. Congress
intended the RICO law to prosecute drug dealers and mob overlords
whose entire business is a crime. It was not drafted to be used
against legitimate businesses and individuals, who face irreparable
damage to their reputation and assets _ and the stigma of being
compared with Al Capone as a ``racketeer'' _ even before they are
accused, much less convicted, of any wrongdoing.
   RICO works like this:
   Firstly, after an indictment it enables the government to seize
a defendant's assets so that the ill-gotten gains cannot be spent,
laundered or siphoned into foreign bank accounts in the period
between indictment and a trial. Secondly, after a conviction, RICO
allows the seizure not only of the assets gained in the specific
crime, but all those associated with the now-proven racketeering
enterprise.
   To a legitimate business enterprise or individual, who is
presumed innocent and ultimately may be shown to have committed no
crime at all, the prospect of RICO prosecution is staggering.
Prosecutors know this, of course, and have used RICO as a bludgeon
to coerce guilty pleas from the unindicted and exact tremendous
penalties on the unconvicted.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert may well have been able to win on the
merits of the government's case against the firm, a case the U.S.
Attorney has been notably loathe to bring to court. But because a
RICO charge would shut off Drexel's overnight bank credit and put
it out of business in a single day, Drexel faced ruination from
even a RICO charge. So Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six
felonies rather than risk RICO indictment, certain bankruptcy and
putting its 10,000 employees out of work. In other words, the
guilty plea was extorted.
   The latest victim of RICO abuse is Michael Milken, a visionary
investment banker who inspired a wave of entrepreneurial activity
in the U.S. in the past decade and helped create jobs for hundreds
of thousands of Americans. Notwithstanding the intent of Congress,
he is being treated like a drug dealer mobster, and the U.S.
Attorney is trying to seize his entire salary for the years 1983,
1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.
   Even though Milken resolutely denies any wrongdoing _ and,
unlike Drexel, is going to fight the charges in court _ and even
though the alleged actions with which he is charged accounted for
only a small fraction of his earnings during this period _ the
government wants to take every penny he has earned during this time
and jail him for ``hundreds of years.'' In the meantime, the
government has used RICO to force Milken out of his job, freeze his
personal assets and effectively put him out of business. And still
no trial, much less a conviction.
   RICO, then, seems to have turned the American judicial
presumption of innocence on its head. The Milken case has developed
into a civil rights issue, in which RICO is used to coerce
settlements the government evidently feels it cannot win in court
on the evidence confessed felon Ivan Boesky traded for a lenient
sentence. Milken is being presumed guilty and severely punished
without trial under a law written to prevent drug dealers from
hiding their loot.
