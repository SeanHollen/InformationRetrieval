   Former Gov. Jim Hunt ended months of
speculation Wednesday when he said he not seek a replay of the
bitter 1984 Senate campaign with Republican rival Sen. Jesse Helms.
   ``This was pretty well settled some time back,'' said Hunt,
citing a heart attack and stroke suffered by his mother. Hunt and
his parents live on adjoining farms in Wilson County.
   ``We just can't walk away from that,'' he said. ``You do your
duty to your family first.''
   Helms defeated Hunt in 1984 by a 52-to-48 percent margin. They
spent a combined $26 million, then a record for a Senate race. The
campaign was marked by negative campaigning and personal slurs, but
Hunt said the grueling 1984 campaign was not the reason for his
decision not to run.
   Hunt, 52, is a partner in a Raleigh law firm. He served four
years as lieutenant governor and was the first governor to serve
successive four-year terms.
   Helms, in a prepared statement, said he was relieved not to be
facing Hunt again. ``Mr. Hunt has demonstrated in four elections
that he is always a formidable opponent,'' Helms said. ``I would be
less than honest if I did not acknowledge that I was glad to learn
of his announcement today.''
   State Democratic Party Chairman Lawrence Davis said in a
statement that Hunt would have been an excellent candidate, but
``our party has a number of excellent potential candidates, any one
of whom can win the 1990 Senate race.''

   A tropical storm warning was issued Wednesday for
islands in the eastern Caribbean while a depression moves westward
from the Atlantic, forecasters reported.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of the depression was near latitude
16.6 degrees north and longitude 53.5 west, about 500 miles east of
the Lesser Antilles, according to the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables.
   The depression, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, was
moving westward at about 20 mph and some strengthening is expected
by Thursday afternoon, the center reported.
   A tropical storm watch has been posted from Dominica to the
British Virgin Islands.
   A U.S. Air Force reconnaissance plane will be flown Thursday to
investigate the depression.
   The depression would become a named storm if maximum sustained
winds reach 39 mph.
   Dean, the second hurricane of the June-to-September Atlantic
season, died earlier this month in the North Atlantic after causing
minor damage in Bermuda.

<TEXT>
   As Exxon prepares to pull out thousands of
oil cleanup workers next month, the people of Valdez are bracing for
an uncertain winter with a rising crime rate, growing landfill and a
shrinking population.
   Already, the frenzy that followed the March 24 spill from the
Exxon Valdez is giving way to quiet. Few people sleep in their cars
on the city streets anymore. New restaurants on wheels are preparing
to leave town.
   ``Poor Valdez, I don't know how it survived,'' said Judy Hobson,
a vendor whose portable shop is nestled with others in a dusty
parking lot. Hobson, like many, plans to be gone by the end of
September.
   Many residents who gave up jobs for bigger paychecks working on
the cleanup will come home to find their jobs taken by newcomers
living in temporary housing.
   ``People who don't have jobs anymore are going to have a place to
live; those with jobs won't,'' Valdez City Manager Doug Griffin
says. Some workers with money but no jobs may leave or become a
problem.
   ``You have the potential for drinking, increased domestic
violence,'' he said.
   ``We're going to see a change in our town,'' Griffin says. ``It
could change the politics. It may change school enrollment. The
demographics could change. It's going to be interesting to see how
the town reacts this winter.''
   More than 10,000 workers and 1,000 vessels are laboring on the
$1.2 billion effort to clean up oil smeared on hundreds of miles of
once-pristine shoreline. The spill killed thousands of birds and sea
mammals amd devastated the fishing industry in Prince William Sound,
Kodiak and Cook Inlet.
   Of the 1,566 miles of shoreline fouled when the Exxon Valdez
spilled about 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil, only 520
miles have been treated to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard. But
those beaches are not oil-free. In most cases, the approval to move
off a beach hinges on removal of only gross contamination.
   Exxon has set a Sept. 15 withdrawal deadline, saying it would be
unsafe to continue cleanup work in the face of winter storms. It is
unclear whether Exxon will return in force next year.
   The state on Tuesday sued Exxon Corp. and six other oil companies
claiming they were negligent in preventing and cleaning up the
spill. It is expected the court case will last up to a decade.
   Like the spill, the pullout's effects will ripple through
government agencies and leave their mark on this and other coastal
communities.
   Already, the tide that left sleepy Valdez a raging boomtown and
Prince William Sound a noisy beehive of activity is shifting. The
daily operational meetings at the Department of Environmental
Conservation were reduced to three nights a week, then to one night
a week at the Exxon headquarters.
   ``Things sure aren't the same,'' said a bored security guard.
   The state environmental agency, which has spent about $9 million
on the spill, in the coming weeks plans to cut its oil spill
response force of about 130 people by half in Valdez, and probably
more in Kenai, Seward and Homer.
   Fish processing plants are working well below capacity because
fishing in the sound has been shut down for much of the summer and
workers are scarce.
   Some tour operators in Valdez have been hurt by the spill; other
businesses, such as restaurants, hotels and recreational vehicle
parks have prospered, Griffin said. There were 23 bed-and-breakfasts
before the spill. There are more than 100 now. There are 10 new
restaurants, many on wheels.
   Valdez, swamped in the early days of the spill, is planning to
lay off temporary workers and prepare for social, political and
economic problems in the wake of Exxon's withdrawal. Officials
bracing for the pullout say they are unsure what may be caused by
thousands of oil spill workers pouring through the city on their way
elsewhere.
   Crime is up, and more violent, Griffin said. Burglaries are
expected to increase as people leave town. ``I feel sorry for Exxon,
Veco and Norcon; they are going to see lots of stuff walk away,'' he
said.
   The city landfill is filling up. The city's overtime bills each
month are running $150,000 to $175,000.
   There likely will be a glut of office space when the summer ends,
and the housing market also may be flooded. The town's population
probably will not fall back to 3,300, but likely will drop to about
4,500 from 13,000, Griffin said. ``That kind of concerns me, people
just hanging around this winter.''
   For Valdez, the spill will not be over when Exxon pulls out, but
just entering a new phase, when problems may not be so apparent,
Griffin said.
   ``But I'm proud of the city. I don't think any other city in the
state could have handled it as well. We took some pretty good shots.
We didn't get knocked out. We're going to make it. It may be a split
decision, but we're going to make it.''

   BAN NON SAO-AE, Thailand (AP) _ The war has nothing to do with
them, but without warning it comes roaring in often on the 729
people of Ban Non Sao-Ae who make their living by farming.
   The war is Cambodia's _ government forces fighting rebels _ and
the villagers have the misfortune of living close to the border
where the fighting frequently breaks out with artillery barrages
that send shells crashing into Thailand.
   ``Bunker'' is one of the few English words that have worked their
way into the local language and that's because almost every family
has a bunker under their stilt-raised wooden houses.
   Phra Attikan Arun, a 30-year-old Buddhist monk, is recording the
war.
   When the artillery shells start pounding in, he turns on his tape
recorder and runs to the safety of his bunker.
   Later, he plays the tapes for visitors to show them what it's
like to live in Ban Non Sao-Ae in Thailand's Prachinburi province.
   The provincial defense office says that in Prachinburi alone 36
villagers have been killed and 120 wounded since 1984. More than
15,000 have fled.
   The effects of the war on Ban Noan Sao-Ae also are documented in
a few dozen color snapshots the monks have arranged on a display
board at their temple. The photographs show the bodies of two
victims of an August 1988 shelling, people building bunkers, looking
at houses blown to pieces, and gathered around an unexploded
artillery shell.
   The fighting flared in late July, just after villagers planted
the rainy-season crop. Scores of shells hit this and other nearby
villages.
   A woman, Wanpen Thonchul, 22, was wounded by shrapnel.
   Several hundred women and children fled down the road to the
Kaset College auditorium, where they slept on the concrete floor.
   Tin Janshu, 59, fled to his bunker after shells crashed in the
paddy field where he was working.
   When it was over, Tin sat on the bunker, saying he doesn't know
why they are fighting in Cambodia.
   ``I only grow my rice to eat,'' he said
   Why not move to another village?
   ``How can I move? The coconut and fruit trees have been growing
here since my parents. If I move somewhere else, by the time I can
grow a coconut tree like this, I would be dead.
   ``My grandfather died here. My father died here, so I'll die here
also.''
   Dum Jankeja, 64, said he also will stay. Dum and his wife share a
bunker with three other households, and he said adversity has
brought the villagers closer.
   ``We have to go through this together. We help each other out. If
we go into the bunker, we go in together.''
   Less fortunate was Somwang Janpit, 22, one of at least three
villagers who recently lost legs to landmines.
   In June, he was searching for bamboo shoots in a deserted field.
He thought the blast he heard was someone shooting birds _ until he
saw his right leg was gone.
   ``Yes, I'm angry,'' he said. ``Now I can't take care of my father
and mother.''
   His mother, 63, now toils nine hours a day in the fields to feed
him, his handicapped sister and their father, 84.
   At the village school, anything that sounds like gunfire sends
the children dashing for the bunker on the compound. Heavy shelling
last year shattered several school buildings.
   But most students have learned to cope, a teacher said.
   ``Their homes are here in the village. When they hear it (the
shelling), they are scared. When it's over, they go and play like
children everywhere.''

   Hooves thunder and swords flash as
warriors on horseback battle hordes of infidels. A leopard stalks, a
bear dances, and a princess in white chiffon smiles radiantly at the
assembled masses.
   The famed Moscow Circus is getting its best acts together and
taking them on the road. This year, the road is winding through the
United States and Canada for only the second time in the past decade.
   Among those taking part is showman Tamerlane Nugzarov, leader of
the famous troupe of horsemen who perform the theatrical,
eye-popping acrobatics that are among the best-known features of the
storied circus.
   But while Nugzarov is one of the Soviet Union's great showmen, he
would not be embarking on a nine-month North America tour if not for
the promotional abilities of an even flashier figure: President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``He's the best promotion man who's ever left the Soviet Union,''
said Steve Leber, a New York promoter who says he is putting up more
than $15 million to finance the tour. ``He has single-handedly made
the American public curious about the Soviet Union.''
   Leber and the circus first capitalized on the West's fascination
with all things Soviet last year, when the circus toured the United
States for the first time in 10 years.
   This year, the circus and Leber have signed an agreement to keep
the circus returning yearly. Circus authorities pay the performers'
regular salaries and Leber covers North American expenses.
   ``Hopefully, we'll gross four times that,'' Leber said of his
investment.
   He said the deal guarantees the circus against loss and gives it
more than half the profits.
   This year's road show goes beyond the regular Moscow Circus.
Leber said it is among the best of 1,400 circus acts nationwide. The
troupe recently completed a one-month dress rehearsal in Leningrad
and opens its North American tour in Toronto on Wednesday night.
   Among the acts is bear trainer Raisa Ibragimovish, who shares a
first name and a strong resemblance with the Soviet Union's first
lady.
   The show also features an acrobat who looks like actor Michael J.
Fox, haunting Russian folk songs, and Soviet and U.S. flags that
seem to appear when the lush music hits its most grandiose peaks.
   Despite the goodwill, there often are snags when Western business
interests hatch deals with communist countries.
   ``Look what happened in China,'' said Leber. ``It's
nerve-wracking.''
   The Moscow Circus, in fact, almost remained stuck in its
namesake. On the day that animals and equipment were to be loaded
onto a freighter for the voyage to Canada, the Culture Ministry
denied the circus a license to export the show.
   ``One of the underlings in the Ministry of Culture said, `Your
contract is too long and too good. We're holding up the ship,'''
Leber said.
   Even a few days' delay would have jeopardized Wednesday night's
opening at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Leber said.
   ``I had the blessing of the circus, and I thought they had
control of their own destiny with this new freedom'' of Gorbachev's
reforms. ``But the Ministry of Culture still had that one power, and
with it, they could really mess you up. This is no way to do
business.''
   A day later, after Leber cut the length of the contract from five
years to one, the ministry relented.
   When ministry officials were asked what happened, spokesman
Vladimir Benyukh replied: ``That is an internal affair and they do
not have to divulge the secrets.''
   Culture Minister Vasily Zakharov apparently was not involved; he
had lost his job days earlier, when the newly powerful Soviet
parliament rejected him in the country's first Cabinet confirmation
hearings. The Culture Ministry has long been a source of shame for
progressive Soviets, since it was responsible for repressing
artists, theater directors and writers who didn't toe the Communist
Party line.
   If anything, the Soviets involved in the circus are learning a
little about Western-style promotion.
   Meanwhile, his general manager Ted Thrasher is offering much
gentler lessons to the circus people about the harsh reality of
competition in the Western world.
   Late in the evening after one of the last rehearsals in
Leningrad, tour general manager Ted Thrasher and Leber dined with
Nugzarov and some other Soviets. Someone, reveling in the spirit of
Soviet-American goodwill, offered a toast to Christopher Columbus,
``the discoverer of America.''
   ``Well, we can toast him,'' Thrasher allowed. ``But this is a
very important lesson: Christopher Columbus was not the first. But
he had the best publicity.''

   Playwright and poet Imamu Amiri Baraka was
arrested Wednesday with his son on assault charges following an
altercation with police, officials said.
   Baraka, 55, and his son Ras, 20, were charged with assault and
making terroristic threats, said police spokesman Daniel Collins.
Ras Baraka was also charged with resisting arrest, Collins said.
   Baraka, who changed his name from LeRoi Jones, is the author of
plays including ``Dutchman'' and ``The Toilet.''
   The two argued with police at the South District Precinct after
they went to the station in response to the arrest of Baraka's
younger son, Ahhi, 15.
   The boy was arrested with four others for allegedly obstructing
the sidewalk in front of a business, Collins said.
   Baraka and his older son were being held at the lockup at police
headquarters Wednesday night. Ahhi was released into the custody of
his mother.
   Collins said Ras Baraka first went to the station with his mother
Amina, but began kicking and punching the officers and had to be
restrained. His father then arrived and joined the struggle with the
officers, he said.
   Baraka's cousin, Peter Jones, said that when Ras Baraka and his
mother arrived at the station, police harassed her and beat Ras
Baraka when he tried to intervene.

<HEAD>Energy Department Agrees Rocky Flats Incinerator Needs Permit</HEAD>

   An agreement has been reached between
federal officials and the Sierra Club acknowledging that the
plutonium recovery incinerator at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant needs a state permit.
   Officials said the agreement was reached Monday between the
Sierra Club, which had filed a lawsuit over the issue, and the U.S.
Department of Energy, which owns the plant which manufactures
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   The plan stipulates that the DOE won't restart the incinerator in
Building 771 until it gets a permit and holds public hearings.
   Fred Dowsett, of the state Health Department, said the
incinerator probably will be shut down six months to a year during
the permit application process.
   The new permit procedures could hasten a crisis in waste disposal
at the plant, which is storing wastes tainted with both hazardous
materials and radioactivity because of a lack of an approved waste
disposal site.
   Gov. Roy Romer has vowed to close the plant if that total exceeds
1,601 cubic yards, and officials say that limit could be reached in
March. A permanent waste site is planned, but not open, in New
Mexico.
   The agreement was signed by the U.S. Department of Justice for
the DOE; Rockwell International, which runs Rocky Flats; and the
Sierra Club.
   The Sierra Club said burning a mixture of plutonium and poisonous
chemicals without a state-authorized permit illegally endangers
public health.
   Most of the plutonium processed can be recovered without the
incinerator, said chemist Niels Schonbeck of the Rocky Flats
Environmental Monitoring Council, a group opposed to the incinerator.

   Gov. Robert P. Casey ran into a bit of
trouble when he tried to buy a fishing license: He couldn't prove he
was a Pennsylvania resident.
   Casey told the tale at a recent builders' convention as a way of
demonstrating that you're never as big a fish as you might think.
   It happened a few weekends ago in Hamlin, population 300, in
rural Wayne County, while the governor was taking a few days off at
his vacation home at Lake Ariel. Casey was chauffeured and escorted
by a state trooper, and wasn't carrying any identification.
   The governor filled out an application and handed it to the
clerk. Then, according to Casey:
   ``She looks at me and says, `Are you a Pennsylvania resident?' ''
   ``And I just deadpanned. I said, `Yes, I'm a Pennsylvania
resident.' ''
   ``She says, `You got a driver's license?' ''
   ``I said no.''
   ``You got a voter's card.''
   ``No.''
   ``You got the certificate of title to your car?''
   ``No.''
   ``She said, `Where do you live?' ''
   ``And I said, `I live in Scranton, I got a place in Lake Ariel
and I'm a Pennsylvania resident.' ''
   Finally, a trooper with Casey, dressed in shorts and a golf
shirt, came to the governor's rescue.
   ``Do you know this guy?'' the clerk asked the trooper. The
officer said yes, he did, and yes, the guy is a Pennsylvania
resident.
   The clerk said, ``I'm going to make an exception in your case,''
and issued the license. She made the trooper sign his name as a
witness above Casey's.

   A curious cub got a free, one-way trip
out of town after he wandered into the crowded terminal at the
Ketchikan airport.
   The 25-pound bear, separated from its mother, tripped an
electronic eye on the terminal's automatic doors and wandered over
to the baggage carousel, where he was surrounded by tourists.
   Alaska Airlines employee John Naranjo said the cub bolted for a
stairway. Naranjo grabbed it by its bottom and the scruff of its
neck, while another man helped him place it in a portable kennel.
   The bear was held overnight Saturday for observation and released
the next morning near where the mother bear had last been seen, said
Todd Sharp, a state wildlife protection officer. The cub sustained a
minor scratch on its nose.
   ``The tourists got a kick out of it,'' Naranjo said. ``One said,
`Only in Alaska.' Another said, `They'll never believe me at home.'

   Salman Rushdie, whose writings Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini found offensive to Mohammed and Allah, has spent seven
months in hiding, cut off from friends and protected by armed guards.
   On Feb. 14, the Iranian leader declared Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' blasphemous and told his followers to kill the
author. The Shiite Moslem patriarch died June 3 but his sentence
lives.
   Rushdie's American wife, Marianne Wiggins, has been quoted as
saying the couple have moved 56 times, to a succession of ``safe
houses'' used for spies and intelligence contacts.
   Friends say the Rushdies seem in good spirits but that the
Indian-born British writer, a non-practicing Moslem, feels his
seclusion may end only if Iran formally withdraws the threat.
   He issued a statement soon after Khomeini passed sentence
expressing ``profound regret'' for any offense to Moslems, but Iran
rejected it.
   Among parts of the ``The Satanic Verses'' many Moslems find
offensive are a scene in which prostitutes are given the names of
the prophet Mohammed's wives, and implications that Mohammed wrote
the Koran, the Moslem holy book.
   ``He's been silenced effectively and cannot speak in his own
defense, and that's a terrible plight for any writer to be in; it's
hideous,'' said a friend, Lisa Appignamesi.
   ``It's very hard to speak for another person, but I think he's
bearing up very well,'' she said in an interview. Ms. Appignamesi is
co-author of ``The Rushdie File,'' a recent book about the case.
   Rushdie, 42, and his wife of 19 months have not been seen in
public since police escorted them from their north London home on
Feb. 14. Rushdie has not given interviews and Ms. Wiggins, 41, also
a novelist, has said isolation is their greatest burden.
   ``You can no longer pass down the street and encounter a
stranger,'' the London magazine Options quoted her as saying last
month. ``You lose all sense of spontaneity because you live in fear.
Fear is an element that used to be on the far side of the Earth.''
   Ms. Wiggins says she and her husband keep diaries, stay in touch
with their families and world events, and always have at least one
armed bodyguard with them.
   They have dined occasionally with friends, literary acquaintances
or such political figures as Neil Kinnock, leader of opposition
Labor Party, but friends say the occasions have become fewer at the
insistence of the guards.
   The Rushdies have occupied a succession of houses operated by
Special Branch security police and MI5, the domestic intelligence
agency, Ms. Wiggins was quoted as telling The Sunday Telegraph.
   She returned to their home in London's Islington district to pick
up belongings, but neither has been home since.
   Their friends, literary agents and publishers do not know their
whereabouts, according to the London newspaper The Independent. It
said the Rushdies do not take telephone calls and mail is sent by a
roundabout route via police, but they can respond to messages.
   Security has cost tens of thousands of dollars, The Independent
said.
   More than 1.1 million hardback copies of ``The Satanic Verses''
have been sold, including 600,000 in the United States, earning
Rushdie more than $1.9 million, said sources at his publishers,
Viking Penguin.
   One said Viking Penguin had spent an amount equal to the
royalties on security for its buildings and at bookstores, ``so the
major winner is Rushdie in a sense.'' Plans for a paperback edition
had been shelved.
   Rushdie continues to review books for The Observer, a London
weekly, and news reports say he is writing a children's book.
   The International Committee for the Defense of Salman Rushdie and
his Publishers has gathered the signatures of 12,000 people,
including 2,500 writers.
   In a message to the committee last month, Rushdie said he
believed reconciliation with Iran was possible.
   He said many Moslems had written messages of support, and ``there
is no such unbridgeable gulf'' between his vision of Islam and that
of Moslems who accuse him of blasphemy.

   A sense of hopelessness has driven a record number
of East Germans across newly porous borders to the West this year.
   Private and government agencies who help resettle refugees say
they expect about 100,000 East Germans to make it to West Germany by
the end of the year.
   The number of despairing East Germans climbing, crawling and
catapulting their way across the border has swelled to a rate
unparalleled since the flood of escapees 30 years ago. That exodus
was dammed by the construction of the Berlin Wall on Aug. 13, 1961.
   And those braving the heavily fortified borders are now joined by
a new breed of escapees who obtain legal permission to travel abroad
then refuse to return.
   ``It is a sense that grows stronger each day among East Germans
that they have no hope, no perspectives for better days as long as
the current regime is in power,'' said Rainer Hildebrandt, director
of the August 13th Society that aids East German refugees.
   ``The fact that 50 percent of those escaping now are under the
age of 24 is testimony to the general despair felt there.''
   About 10,000 East Germans with legal tourist visas have sought
asylum in West Berlin so far this year, and at least 70,000 legal
emigres are expected by the end of the year.
   A West German official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
at least 200 East Germans are seeking asylum at West German
embassies in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Berlin.
   ``We advise against this method as there are continuing dangers
involved, and there is simply no way to accommodate people at the
representations,'' the official said.
   In Budapest, Hungary, where an estimated 130 East Germans are
seeking refugee status and access to West Germany, authorities have
hinted that they may recognize a right to asylum, but no decisions
have been made.
   West Germany's deputy minister for Inter-German Relations, Walter
Priesnitz, said recently that East Germans should not try to leave
without proper documents through Hungary, which also has a communist
government.
   In the course of democratic reform, Hungary has dismantled nearly
half of the 160-mile barbed-wire border separating it from the West.
   Officials in Austria have been approached for help by 237 East
Germans who fled across the border since the Hungarians began
dismantling the barbed wire in May. But they estimate up to six
times that number have gone directly to the West German Embassy in
Vienna after arriving via Hungary.
   Judith Toth, the Hungarian Interior Ministry official responsible
for refugee affairs, has said a special refugee camp will be erected
in Budapest for those seeking asylum. But until then, those seeking
refuge at the West German Embassy now may be forced to return to
East Germany.
   Detlef Kuehn, president of the Institute for Inter-German Affairs
in West Germany, told The Associated Press that the West German
government advises East Germans to seek legal means of emigrating,
but he acknowledged that the majority of applicants must wait years.
   ``It is hopelessness that is driving so many here,'' Kuehn said.
``There are no limits on the number of East Germans that we will
take in. But we have no interest in depopulating East Germany.''
   One East Berliner, who did not want his name used, said East
Germans are turning to Hungary as an escape route because the
prospects for reform in their own nation seem ever dimmer as Erich
Honecker remains the Communist Party leader.
   ``Erich Honecker is apparently a very healthy man, and as long as
he is alive we will have the status quo,'' he said.
   ``But right now we have a terrible situation because nobody knows
what the reality is. It is naivete and wishful thinking that makes
people seek help in another socialist country.''
   East German officials declined the discuss the isssue.
   ``These matters remain very sensitive, as you know,'' said Herman
Thost, a Foreign Ministry official in East Berlin who deals with
press relations.
   Honecker has told visiting West German officials his government
has repealed long-standing orders to shoot those trying to escape,
except in cases where other lives are threatened. No shootings have
been reported since February despite a rising rate of escapes.
   The August 13th Society calculates that at least 189 East Germans
were killed in failed escape attempts since the Berlin Wall was
built.
   At least 350 escapes have been recorded this year up to mid-July
over the wall and across the heavily fortified borders with the rest
of West Germany.

   The outfield didn't open up and swallow
terrified 11-year-olds and no blood was spilled, but if the Little
League tournament had turned ghoulish, author Stephen King would
have been there to record it.
   The best-selling writer spent Tuesday and Wednesday at the
eastern regional baseball tournament, acting as an assistant coach
for his son's team, the West Side Little League squad from Bangor,
Maine.
   King, a Boston Red Sox season ticket holder and avid baseball
fan, has written ``Carrie,'' ``The Shining'' and ``Pet Sematary,''
among other books.
   He signed many autographs Tuesday and told fans he has worked
with the Bangor squad all season.
   Bangor lost 2-1 to Westfield, Mass., on Tuesday. Owen King put
Bangor on the scoreboard in the first inning when he walked with the
bases loaded, but Westfield won with a bases loaded walk in the
sixth inning.
   Bangor lost again, 5-4, to East Hartford in a consolation game
Wednesday.

   Baseball pitcher Dave Dravecky not only made
a dramatic comeback from cancer surgery last week, his stirring
victory has helped a 6-year-old boy's fight against leukemia.
   ``It's just wonderful,'' said Isabelle Lemon of radio station
KNBR, which sponsored the fund-raiser that generated more than
$85,000 to pay for tests of 1,133 potential bone marrow donors. ``We
expect to get more.''
   While making his return to baseball with the San Francisco Giants
last Thursday, Dravecky urged donors to come forward for Alex
Vlahov. Alex, whose chances of survival depend on quickly locating a
suitable marrow match, was at Candlestick Park for the game.
   KNBR offered to donate $5 for each of the 92 pitches thrown by
Dravecky against the Cincinnati Reds in his 4-3 comeback win.
   ``We were deluged by callers pledging similar donations,'' Lemon
said. The 1,500 donations ranged from a check for 80 cents from a
child who took the money from his weekly allowance to $8,813
gathered in an office pool at the brokerage Bear Stearns Co.
   Many donations were for $92, a dollar a pitch, she said.
   Some 500 people also have volunteered to take the marrow tests
and pay the $75 fee, Lemon added.
   The money will benefit Life-Savers Foundation of America, which
is trying to find a donor for Alex. Life-Savers spokeswoman Sara
Graves said there's a one in 20,000 chance of finding a suitable
donor.
   Dravecky suffered a broken arm in Montreal on Tuesday that was
related to surgery last year to remove a malignant tumor from his
left arm.

   Corporate raider Carl Icahn, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and the head of investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
are getting together for a friendly takeover battle.
   The simulated drama about a hostile raid will take place Sept.
21-23 at a conference on management in the 1990s by the World
Management Council, the group said Tuesday.
   Also scheduled to attend the Manhattan conference are the Dalai
Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader; leveraged buyout specialist
Henry Kravis; former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker; Italian
industrialist Carlo de Benedetti; and Texas oilman and corporate
raider T. Boone Pickens.
   In the mock takeover, Icahn will make a surprise hostile bid for
a fictitious company headed by former Arco Inc. Chairman Robert O.
Anderson. Jackson is to be a board member, but he may switch to a
more characteristic role as a shareholder rights defender or
community figure, said John Diebold, president of the management
council.
   Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph, whose firm has provided
financial backing for many corporate raids in the 1980s, originally
was cast as Icahn's investment backer. ``Now he's decided he wants
to be the company's banker,'' Diebold said.
   The takeover scenario is being developed by a case writer at the
Harvard Business School, he said.

   Heavyweight champion Mike Tyson will defend his
title against Razor Ruddock and James ``Buster'' Douglas in coming
months, a spokesman for promoter Don King said.
   Ruddock, ranked second by the World Boxing Council, has accepted
a million-dollar offer to fight Tyson, Al Braverman said Wednesday.
A bout also has been arranged with Douglas, he said.
   The first fight will be in October and the second in December or
January, although King hasn't decided which opponent Tyson will take
on first, Braverman said.
   ``Both are acceptable. It will be whichever one he feels can sell
the best,'' Braverman said. The fights are likely to be staged in
Las Vegas or Atlantic City, N.J.
   Ruddock, 25, is 22-1-1 with 15 knockouts. Douglas, 28-4-1,
outpointed Oliver McCall on July 21 on the same card in which Tyson
defended his title by stopping Carl ``The Truth'' Williams in 93
seconds at Atlantic City.

   An systems analyst who had checked into
a psychiatric center was indicted Wednesday on charges of
sodomizing, sexually abusing and torturing young boys and filming
some of the acts for sale, a prosecutor said.
   Harold Hotchkiss, 45, of Ossining was charged in a 209-count
indictment with various counts of sodomy, sexual abuse, use of a
child in a sexual performance, promoting a sexual performance by a
child, obscenity, attempted aggravated sexual abuse and endangering
the welfare of a child.
   Westchester County District Attorney Carl Vergari said the
alleged abuse occurred between 1984 and 1989, and involved 10 boys
between the ages of seven and 17.
   ``There was anal and oral sodomy, shock treatments and
beatings,'' said Vergari.
   Apparently, Hotchkiss was friends with the family of one boy and
``one thing led to another. A friend introduced a friend introduced
a friend.''
   Vergari also said that he approached ``young boys who were
susceptible.''
   Three of the victims were brothers, Vergari said. He would not
disclose whether the boys received any kind of payment for their
activities.
   Jeanine Ferris Pirro, chief of the district attorney's Domestic
Violence and Child Abuse Bureau, said Hotchkiss photographed and
audiotaped the acts ``for sale and distribution'' so authorities do
not have all the film Hotchkiss allegedly took.
   Hotchkiss allegedly made the children perform acts with him and
with each other and he allegedly beat the boys and used shock on
them.
   Pirro said authorities were notified of the activities when the
mother of one of the boys ``found something in her home.'' She would
not disclose what it was. Vergari said there was a possibility that
there were more victims.
   The alleged abuse occurred in the Ossining-Peekskill area where
Hotchkiss has lived for many years. Much of the abuse occurred
within Hotchkiss' home, said Vergari.
   Hotchkiss, who is single, voluntarily checked himself into the
Institute of Living in Hartford, Conn., a few months ago, Pirro said.
   Authorities would not disclose why he checked himself into the
facility or whether his arrest Wednesday occurred there.
   His attorney, Frank Silverstein, asked Westchester County Court
Judge Kenneth Lange to allow his client to undergo psychiatric
tests. Lange agreed and Hotchkiss was remanded to the forensic unit
of the Westchester County Jail. No bail was set.
   Rita Black, a spokeswoman for IBM, said Hotchkiss was a senior
associate systems and procedures analyst with IBM at its White
Plains facility and had worked for the company since March 9, 1965.
   She said Hotchkiss was still on the IBM payroll.

   It's lush and lovely, and delightful
to behold, but the enchantment of purple loosestrife is fast growing
old.
   The bushy garden flower is invading delicate wetlands from coast
to coast, choking out native plants and driving away the birds and
animals that lived among them.
   Although loosestrife has been on the loose since the 1800s,
biologists haven't recognized the damage until the past five years.
   ``It's a very pretty plant, until you realize what it's done,''
said Howard Wandell with Michigan's Department of Natural Resources
in Lansing. ``In some of our game areas, it is creating habitat
problems.''
   At this time of year, the hardy European marsh plant is in peak
purple bloom across the northern United States.
   ``It's so beautiful, it's hard to be angry with it,'' said
Stephen Hight, a U.S. Department of Agriculture researcher in
Beltsville, Va. ``In New York, you just see fields of purple haze.
It's just gorgeous.''
   Although product researchers at Dow Chemical Co. are
experimenting with a selective herbicide called Garlon that could
kill loosestrife, Hight and other USDA researchers hope to import
predators for the imported pest.
   The study centers on three European beetles that eat nothing but
loosestrife.
   Hight said the USDA will be ready within two years to release the
insects in test fields in seven states: New York, Iowa, Nebraska,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana and Illinois.
   It would take five to 10 years for the bugs to breed in enough
numbers to take on the whole continent. If they thrive and eat
right, the beetles could cut the purple fields of loosestrife to a
fourth of their current density and hold it there, Hight said
Wednesday.
   ``We find that in invaded areas, the native plants, some of them
endangered species, are just barely hanging on. This could allow
some of these native plants to come back in,'' he said.
   Until then, fighting loosestrife is a state-by-state battle.
   Minnesota and Washington have outlawed the plant, banning it even
in home gardens. Still, it has claimed more than 1 percent of
Minnesota's 2.5 million acres of wetland, said Jay Rendall of the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
   ``I personally have witnessed how fast it spreads,'' Rendall
said. ``I watched one 50-by-100-foot patch spread to cover a 20-acre
march in about three years.''
   Loosestrife replaces cattails and rushes in which waterfowl nest.
When the plant moves in, ducks move out, followed by muskrats and
other animals, Rendall said.
   Wisconsin prohibits the sale of all species of loosestrife, and
Indiana, Ohio and Illinois place restrictions on the plant's sale.
   Some states, including New York and Michigan, have enacted no
anti-loosestrife laws, Rendall said. In both states, the infestation
is so severe it would cost too much to even begin battling the weed,
he said.
   Yet loosestrife holds a peculiar attraction in Michigan, where
Rendall estimates it has taken over more than 30,000 acres of marsh
and swamp, about the same as in Minnesota.
   ``It is a very pretty plant so a lot of people here were
promoting its growth,'' Wandell said. ``Garden clubs even had some
cities name their city flower the purple loosestrife.''

   Her days of glamour and glitz are over. Jade,
an 8-year-old star chimpanzee, is retiring.
   Known as Zippy during her career, Jade is a Clio and Emmy award
winner. Among her credits are stints on ``Late Night With David
Letterman'' and appearances in rock music videos.
   She arrived Tuesday at a primate sanctuary about 30 miles
northwest of San Antonio known as Primarily Primates Inc. The
privately funded facility cares for animals that might die by
abandonment or laboratory experimentation.
   Jade's owners, Frank and Beverly Krevens from New York's Long
Island said they were surprised at how quickly she adapted to her
retirement environment.
   ``I thought she (first) would be in a period of mourning,''
Beverly Krevens said, ``but we put her in one of the enclosures and
she immediately took to it. She started running and climbing all
over.''
   In human years, Jade is 40 to 50 years old.
   Mrs. Krevens is convinced the chimp's new home will be a happy
one.
   ``We cried a trail of tears coming down here because we're going
to miss her dearly, but we know this is the best place,'' she said.

   While Claude Pepper lived, his office was a
five-room suite, among the best on Capitol Hill. With Pepper gone
and no successor in place, his staff is winding up his work in two
dingy storerooms with an air shaft for a view.
   ``Our quarters are so cramped, we figured the animal rights
people would be protesting,'' says Rochelle Jones, longtime press
secretary for the Florida congressman.
   The experiences of Pepper's staff undoubtedly differ little from
those of Reps. Jim Wright and Tony Coelho, who resigned, and Mickey
Leland and Larkin Smith, who were killed in recent plane crashes.
   Pepper, the champion of the elderly, enjoyed the power and perks
that grow with seniority and his staff shared them, too. When he
died, the perks died for his staff as well.
   ``When a member dies, it's over with,'' says Ray Colley, the
deputy clerk of the House who supervises the transitions when a
congressman leaves and another takes his place.
   When Pepper staffers returned from his funeral in June, there was
a message from the clerk's office: The telephone should no longer be
answered ``Congressman Claude Pepper's office.'' It was to be ``18th
Congressional District of Florida.''
   About the same time, recalls Ms. Jones, a procession of
congressmen and their staffs came by to look over Pepper's office,
which was in a prime location in the Rayburn Office Building _
commensurate with his 27 years in the House.
   ``They were really ghoulish people looking over the remains,''
says Ms. Jones. ``Five different people put in a bid for the
office.''
   When congressional suites become vacant, other members bid on
them and they are awarded on the basis of seniority.
   The visitors included congressmen and others who wanted
post-death autographs on books and pictures _ before the automatic
signing pen was put away.
   ``I can understand the staff's concern about not being able to
answer `Senator Pepper' but he's not Senator Pepper any more,''
Colley said. Many old-timers on Capitol Hill still referred to
Pepper as senator, since he served in the Senate for 14 years.
   Some of the Pepper perks were gone before the sun set on his
grave.
   ``I had a parking space in Rayburn that was just great _ a few
steps from the elevator,'' said Ms. Jones. ``One day I came in and
found (Texas congressman) Jack Brooks using my parking space. It was
my notification that the space was no longer mine.''
   Pepper died May 30 at age 88. The funeral was June 5 in Florida.
His congressional seat will be filled in a special election Aug. 29,
but until then his staff takes care of district business.
   At the end of June, the Pepper staff was told to move into two
rooms among storage spaces on the sixth floor of the Longworth House
Office Building next door _ with a view of an air shaft.
   The move meant packing up the congressman's belongings, first for
the office switch, then for transfer to the Federal Records Center.
   ``Pepper was in office from 1962. He never threw away a piece of
paper,'' said Ms. Jones. ``I found personnel files of people who
worked there in the 1960s.
   ``The Rayburn office was filled with memorabilia. It was a living
museum, pictures of Pepper with all the presidents he's known since
Roosevelt, pictures of Pepper with celebrities. One wall was filled
just with legislation he had participated in, from the cross-Florida
barge canal to Social Security reform.''
   Pepper's personal things, including the hundreds of pictures and
dozens of pens from bill signings, will go to the Mildred and Claude
Pepper Library at Florida State University in Tallahassee.
   Pepper's office was assigned by the clerk's office to Rep. Dale
Kildee, D-Mich., who is in his seventh term.
   ``We are very careful to answer the phone `18th Congressional
District of Florida,''' said Ms. Jones. ``There is usually a pause,
then `is this Congressman Pepper's office?' People still call up;
they need help getting a visa; a year-old Medicare claim hasn't been
paid.''
   The staff toils on, winding up the Pepper era.
   ``People have stopped answering our phone calls,'' Ms. Jones said.
   That, in Washington, is the ultimate loss of power.

<HEAD>Chinese Ambassador's Farewell Draws Limited Official Attendance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Official U.S. displeasure over the Chinese
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement is putting a damper on
departing Ambassador Han Xu's farewell to Washington.
   The most prominent Americans among about 500 guests at Han's
Chinese Embassy reception Wednesday night were retired rather than
active public officials.
   They included two former secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger
and Alexander Haig, and two former Senate leaders, Republican Hugh
Scott and Democrat Mike Mansfield. Also there was former Democratic
Sen. J. William Fulbright.
   The absence of top members of President Bush's administration and
cabinet reflected the president's post-June 3 policy of balancing
U.S. public outrage over the killings of Chinese pro-democracy
demonstrators against the decision to continue dialogue with the
Chinese government.
   Under that policy, the administration decided that the highest
representation at Han's reception would be at the assistant
secretary level, said a State Department official who insisted on
anonymity. From the department came Richard Solomon, assistant
secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs, Ivan Selin,
undersecretary for management, and some lower level officials.
   Earlier in the day, the 65-year-old ambassador made a farewell
call on Vice President Dan Quayle. Their meeting was cordial and
``they talked about ways China could improve its relations with the
United States ... human rights were obviously mentioned,'' said
Quayle spokesman David Beckwith.
   Han also made official farewell calls on at least four members of
the Bush Cabinet and some members of Congress, all conspicuously
absent Wednesday. Cabinet members often attend diplomatic
receptions, and they appeared at the Chinese Embassy during the
heyday of Han's four upbeat years of expanding relations with the
United States.
   But U.S. officials say those times are over unless China halts
repression of its citizens.
   Han Xu and his wife, Ge Qiyun, smilingly greeted all the guests
at the entrance to two reception rooms filled with hot and cold
Chinese appetizers and drinks ranging from tea to whiskey. The
couple showed they have made some warm friends, the ambassador
embracing several Americans, including Haig, while Ms. Ge exchanged
kisses with some of the female guests.
   Haig, a retired four-star general, accompanied President Nixon on
his 1972 Beijing journey breaking the ice on U.S.-China relations.
Han, then chief of protocol, was one of the first officials to greet
them. Haig has visited China several times.
   Scott, 88, attended the reception in a wheelchair. He recalled
his first visit to China before World War II. Mansfield, who last
year completed a record 11 years as ambassador to Japan, was known
in Congress as an ``old Asia hand'' who advocated U.S. recogniion of
the communist government long before many other lawmakers. He first
visited Asia as a Navy sailor.
   Beijing Television on July 6 said Han Xu's term was up and he
would be succeeded by Vice Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen. Han will
leave for Beijing later this month and the new ambassador is
expected in mid-October, Chinese officials said.

   P.W. Botha's bitter exit from
the presidency three weeks before parliamentary elections may help
far-right candidates at the expense of the National Party he served
for a half-century.
   The Conservative Party, which claims the Nationalists are
capitulating to blacks, quickly incorporated Botha's stern farewell
speech Monday into its campaign rhetoric.
   ``We support Mr. P.W. Botha in his viewpoint, which has been our
viewpoint all along,'' said Conservative Party leader Andries
Treurnicht at a campaign rally after Botha's nationally televised
address.
   Botha denounced a planned meeting between National Party leader
F.W. de Klerk and President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia on grounds the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla organization has its
headquarters in Zambia. Botha said his Cabinet ignored his
opposition to the meeting.
   Yet Botha and his predecessor, John Vorster, had met with Kaunda,
and the circumstances of the ANC were no different then.
   ``One conclusion is that Mr. Botha was using the Kaunda talks as
a stick with which to beat Mr. de Klerk, not because of any
objection in principle but because he was blinded by personal
antipathy for the man who succeeded him,'' said Patrick Laurence, a
political writer for The Star newspaper in Johannesburg.
   De Klerk was installed as acting president on Tuesday.
   ``The way Botha chose to do this, tarring de Klerk with the ANC
brush ... it is clear he wanted to do as much harm to de Klerk as he
could,'' said Steven Friedman, a researcher at the independent South
African Institute of Race Relations.
   Friedman suggested Botha had grown more conservative in recent
years.
   ``He had come to the end of the line as far as reform is
concerned. He was increasingly querulous and felt he hadn't gotten
credit, particularly from the outside world, for the major reforms
he did initiate,'' said Friedman.
   By proceeding with the Kaunda meeting, de Klerk could win over
some voters who might have backed the liberal Democratic Party. But
the greatest threat to Nationalists in the Sept. 6 elections appears
to be from the Conservatives, who say the ANC has no role to play,
ever, in South Africa. They also call for reimposing apartheid laws
Botha repealed.
   It was Botha's foreign policy that Treurnicht agreed with, not
the retired president's belief that whites must share power with the
black majority.
   At a minimum, the resignation saga has damaged the image of
stability developed by the National Party since taking power in 1948.
   ``For the last 40 years, the National Party has appeared to be
entirely in control. Incidents like this conflict don't do much for
that kind of image,'' said Friedman.
   Treurnicht, a member of Botha's Cabinet who broke away in 1982
over the issue of allowing Indians and people of mixed race into
Parliament, lost no time in decrying the National Party's ``lack of
unity.''
   Botha, who became prime minister in 1978, built up a personal
image as a defender of white, particularly Afrikaner, interests.
Even if people found it difficult to be fond of him, most white
voters, English- and Afrikaans-speaking, trusted him on security
matters. His suggestion that de Klerk is making a major error on
that front may be taken seriously.
   On the personal level, many white voters feel sorry for Botha.
The reaction in street conversations and radio talk shows indicates
the Cabinet is seen as bullying a sick, albeit cantankerous, old man
into a humiliating resignation instead of smoothing things over
until the election.
   Such sentiments may not translate into a loss of support for the
National Party, but the Conservative Party is not missing any chance.
   From the first hint of the dispute, Treurnicht has lamented
Botha's treatment by the Cabinet, and called the resignation a
``palace revolution.''
   Although Afrikaners, the whites most likely to vote
conservatively, may sympathize with Botha, they also believe
strongly in group loyalty. They may begin to frown on Botha's
turning against the party he served for 53 years.
   Beeld, an Afrikaans-language daily that supported Botha for many
years, said, ``The last image that will linger ... is that of a
blind Samson who with his last strength tried to overturn the
pillars of his party on himself and his own companions.''

<HEAD>Study: Drinking During Breast Feeding May Slow Baby's Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Babies may learn to crawl and walk a little slower
if their mothers drink while nursing, according to a study released
today that suggests even small amounts of alcohol in breast milk can
affect development.
   While the results are troubling, experts caution that there is no
clear proof that nursing mothers will harm their babies if they
drink moderately.
   ``I would not worry about drinking during lactation until this
finding has been confirmed in at least one more study,'' said Dr.
Ruth E. Little, principal author of the research report.
   Even if their babies are slow to walk, she said, mothers should
not blame their occasional drinking, because babies normally vary in
when they learn these skills.
   Doctors routinely caution women to avoid alcohol during pregnancy
because of the potentially dangerous effects of drinking on the
growth of their fetuses. The results of the new study raise the
possibility that this taboo should be extended into early childhood
if babies are breast-fed.
   The research found that the development of movement skills _ but
not intelligence _ was slightly retarded in the babies of nursing
women who had one or more drinks a day.
   ``These babies are a little slower to walk, to crawl and to have
other motor skills,'' said Little, an epidemiologist at the
University of Michigan.
   She and other researchers looked at more than 100 possible
factors that could have explained the slower development. These
included the women's age, intelligence and drug use during
pregnancy. But only drinking while breast feeding was clearly
associated with slower motor development.
   The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was
based on tests conducted on 400 infants who were born to members of
a health maintenance organization in Seattle.
   ``I think it's provocative, but the potential mechanism is very
difficult to understand, since the actual alcohol exposure
experienced by these children is minimal,'' commented Dr. Robert
Sokol, head of the fetal alcohol research center at Wayne State
University in Detroit.
   During pregnancy, alcohol consumed by the mother crosses the
placenta, and alcohol levels in the fetus are similar to those in
the mother's bloodstream. After birth, however, only tiny amounts of
alcohol get into breast milk.
   For instance, if a 130-pound woman has four drinks, one-hundredth
of an ounce of the alcohol will reach her baby through breast milk.
Even if the mother drinks this heavily every day for three months,
the child will still take in less than an ounce of alcohol.
   The researchers cannot explain how even lower alcohol exposure
might affect babies' development. They said one possibility is that
babies cannot eliminate alcohol from their bodies, so it builds up
and interferes with brain development.
   The doctors used a test called the Bayley Scales of Infant
Development to check babies' mental and motor growth. At 1 year of
age, motor development was lower in babies regularly exposed to
alcohol in breast milk, and the higher their alcohol intake, the
slower their motor growth.
   The infants of breast-feeding mothers who had at least one drink
a day had mean scores on the test of 98, while those exposed to less
alcohol had mean scores of 103. The difference was a bit greater
when the researchers compared only babies whose mothers did not
supplement their diets with formula.
   Lyn Weiner, program director of the fetal alcohol education
program at Boston University School of Medicine, noted that
pediatricians sometimes recommend that nursing mothers drink some
beer to help start the flow of milk.
   ``Women have been doing it for generations,'' she said. ``I think
it's probably of no effect in the healthy woman.''
   However, she said the results do raise concern about women who
drink heavily while nursing.

<HEAD>Hearings Next Month on EPA Pesticide Decisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hearings are to begin next month on legislation
to get the Agriculture Department more involved with the
Environmental Protection Agency on pesticide decisions.
   A key feature of the measure, sponsored by Rep. George Brown,
D-Calif., would amend existing statutes to require the Agriculture
Department to report annually to EPA on which pests are attacking
crops and the chemicals or other methods being used to control them.
   It also would require USDA to say which pests are developing
resistance to products, said Skip Stiles, staff director of Brown's
House Agriculture subcommittee on department operations, research
and foreign agriculture.
   The idea, he said, is to set off an early warning system if EPA
is starting to eliminate all the pesticides used for certain crops
so alternatives can be developed.
   ``The Department of Agriculture doesn't get involved in these
regulation decisions until it is too late to do anything about it,''
Stiles said.
   He gave as an example the case of ethylene dibromide, suspended
by the EPA in 1984 after more than seven years of review. It was
used, among other things, as a fumigant against fruit flies on
imported produce, most specifically mangoes.
   A relatively simple alternative eventually was discovered, but it
took three years to move through the government approval process
from the time ethylene dibromide was taken off the market, he said.
   The Agriculture Department, Stiles said, could have been working
all along to find the alternative that would have been ready when
ethylene dibromide was canceled.
   Charles Smith, USDA pesticide research coordinator, said the
department was aware of the EPA review, but never knew what the
agency's decision would be.
   ``At the end of the seven years you can look back and say, `Why
didn't you do something?' And, we say, `We didn't know what we were
supposed to do,''' Smith said.
   He said the department has to ask: ``How many million dollars of
taxpayers' money should I spend to find an alternative to something
that may stay on the market?''
   But, Smith said, that doesn't mean the department isn't
constantly doing research on pest control.
   ``Finding chemical alternatives is not what we generally think of
as the area we think federal money is best spent,'' Smith said,
adding that the chemical industry usually shoulders that burden.
   He said the government is doing extensive biotechnical research,
and that federal and university researchers generally do the kind of
work that's not profitable for private industry because it's
high-risk.
   Just because a chemical is under review by the EPA doesn't mean
it will be canceled, he said.
   ``EPA has been reluctant to share any information until they are
certain there is a problem and then sometimes it is way down the
road,'' Smith said.
   Stiles said the major part of Brown's bill is devoted to
procedures for canceling pesticides.
   ``The big complaint has been the EPA takes forever to cancel a
pesticide,'' he said. ``Part of the delay is the fact that they have
cumbersome administrative hearings.''
   The bill, Stiles said, would eliminate some of those hearings.

<HEAD>Pentagon's Estimated Weapons Costs Drop $19 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says the cost of bringing its 98
major weapons systems from the drawing board to full production is
expected to be $806.2 billion _ $19 billion less than thought six
months ago.
   But that figure is sure to fluctuate since Congress already has
attempted to rearrange Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's first
spending plan.
   The Pentagon issued a congressionally mandated report Wednesday
that offers a ``snapshot'' of anticipated overall weapons costs if
the Bush administration budget is followed.
   Several of the weapons contained in the Selected Acquisition
Report entered development in 1970, while others are expected to be
in production beyond the year 2000. As the weapons programs reach
the final stages of production, they are dropped from the report.
   The previous report, which was released in March and estimated
costs as of Dec. 31, 1988, predicted the overall cost of the
Pentagon's major weapons systems would be $825.9 billion.
   The report said the $19 billion drop over the past six months was
due primarily to Cheney's attempt to cancel the Marine's
troop-carrying V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor plane and halt production on a
number of items such as the Army's AH-64 Apache attack helicopter,
the OH-58D helicopter, the Navy's F-14D jet fighter, the Air Force's
F-15E fighter plane and the PHOENIX air-to-air missile, which is
carried aboard F-14s.
   Congress has attempted to restore the Osprey to the Pentagon's
spending plan for next year. Its cancellation would have sliced
$23.4 billion from the Pentagon's budget, the report said.
   The report also detailed estimated increases in several programs,
such as the addition of 225 CH-53E troop transport helicopters for
the Navy and Marines, raising the total cost of that program from
$4.8 billion to $7.8 billion.
   Under Cheney's plan, the choppers were envisioned as the
substitute for the V-22 Osprey.
   The report said the Army's SADARM missile program jumped by $4.4
billion to $6.2 billion, due primarily to orders from fiscal years
1995 through 2002, which had not been recorded in previous reports.
In total, the Army estimates it will purchase 124,145 of the
anti-tank missiles.
   An increase of $1 billion was logged for the Navy's SSN-21 Sea
Wolf submarine program, while research, development and testing
drove costs of the Air Force's small intercontinental ballistic
missile program up by $2.2 billion to $5.3 billion, the report
showed.
   The Pentagon is required by Congress to produce the annual
Selected Acquisition Report.
   It is a review of the total procurement costs of the major
weapons programs and is designed to provide a broad gauge of how
well the Pentagon is managing its weapons buying.
   On Wednesday, officials released an update of that report, which
summarizes programs that have had cost estimate changes of at least
5 percent or schedule delays of at least six months.
   The cost estimates include research and development for a weapons
program, its procurement and construction costs. The total program
costs reflect actual costs on delivered items, as well as
anticipated costs for future procurement, which in some instances
``extend beyond the year 2000,'' the Pentagon report said.
   The report released Wednesday gave a view of the program costs as
of June 30.

   China says it is suspending participation in
the prestigious Fulbright program, forbidding an exchange of
American professors and Chinese scholars.
   The action comes in the wake of strained relations between the
United States and China over the communist nation's crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Richard Ware, chairman of the Board of Foreign Scholarships, said
Wednesday that the Chinese government told the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing that ``no American Fulbright professors would be permitted
to teach in China, and that no Chinese graduate students or research
scholars would be allowed to travel to the U.S.''
   The China Fulbright program has been one of the largest in the
world, with 24 American professors and a similar number of Chinese
scholars participating, Ware said.
   ``We deeply regret the Chinese decision to suspend an educational
exchange program that has been of great mutual benefit,'' he said.
   The 24 American professors assigned to China will be offered
Fulbright teaching posts in other countries, said W.B. Reinckens of
the U.S. Information Agency.
   Reinckens said China has participated for about 10 years in the
Fulbright program, administered by the USIA in cooperation with
other federal agencies and a number of private organizations. There
are 126 countries, including China, in the program.
   The Fulbright program was established in 1946 under legislation
by former Sen. J. William Fulbright, D-Ark. More than 167,000
people, including 58,000 from the United States and 109,000 from
abroad, have participated.

<HEAD>SEC Tightens Rules on Penny Stock Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock brokers will have a harder time
pressuring new customers into buying low-priced, often risky
securities known as ``penny stocks,'' under a new rule adopted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The rule, unanimously approved Wednesday, requires brokers
offering certain securities to get the new customer's written
approval before completing the sale.
   SEC staffers hope it will curb the practice of unsolicited
telephone stock sales _ known as ``cold calling'' _ by providing a
``built-in cooling off period'' for the customer to reconsider his
or her decision, said Sarah B. Ackerson of the SEC Enforcement
Division.
   The rule, which takes effect Jan. 1, comes in response to a
dramatic rise in the fraudulent sale of penny stocks. In the first
half of the current fiscal year, the SEC has received 2,462
complaints about penny stock fraud compared with 1,510 for all of
the last year.
   John C. Baldwin, president of the North American Securities
Administrators Association, a group of state-level investment
regulators, said the action puts ``new obstacles in the path of the
penny stock firms that use the telephone as a weapon to mug
unsuspecting investors.''
   Before the 5-to-0 vote to approve the change, SEC Chairman David
S. Ruder said the problem was of ``great concern'' to the agency.
   Last fall, Ruder created a Penny Stock Task Force, which found a
key element of penny stock fraud was high-pressure sales tactics _
often over the telephone _ used on unsophisticated investors.
   The new rule, Ruder said, ``brings us today a weapon against this
scurrilous conduct _ a weapon that's effective but not intrusive.''
   But he and several other commission members also noted most penny
stocks and penny stock dealers are legitimate.
   The SEC created several exceptions in response to numerous
complaints that the proposal would make it tough for new companies
short of capital _ traditionally a major segment of penny stock
issuers _ to raise money.
   The rule would apply to stocks selling at $4.99 or less per share
or to stocks issued by companies with less than $2 million in
tangible assets.
   Penny stocks, trading for a few cents up to a few dollars, are
usually issued by new companies or concerns with an uneven earnings
history.
   They usually are not traded on exchanges or quoted on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
(NASDAQ) System, commonly known as the national over-the-counter
market.
   Because most penny stocks are not listed nationally, information
about them is hard to come by and fraudulent claims are difficult to
dispute.
   The new penny stock rule, first proposed in February, will
require brokers and dealers to get written purchase agreements from
new customers before completing their first three transactions in
stocks that are neither traded on stock exchanges nor through the
NASDAQ system.
   Broker-dealers also would have to get financial information from
the customer such as income, investment experience and investment
objectives; determine whether the transaction is suitable for the
customer's needs and write down the basis for that determination.
   Exempted were initial public offerings that are scheduled to be
listed with NASDAQ or a stock exchange.

<HEAD>State Department Indicates Noriega Can Stay In Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is demanding that Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega relinquish power in Panama, but apparently
won't insist that he leave the country.
   ``We've always said that he must leave power. We've always said
that there can be no accommodation with a Noriega-dominated
regime,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday.
   However, Boucher declined to say whether Noriega, under
indictment in Florida on drug charges, must leave Panama.
   The Organization of American States resumed talks in Panama this
week with government and opposition forces. Boucher said the
administration supports the attempt ``to achieve a democratic
transfer of power.''
   President Bush, at a news conference Tuesday, left open the
possibility of seeking Noriega's extradition _ or even abducting him
_ to face trial.
   ``I have an obligation to try to bring people to justice,'' he
said.
   The Reagan administration initially demanded that Noriega not
only surrender power but leave Panama. Behind the scenes, though,
the United States worked out a deal for the general to leave during
national elections and to be free to return afterward _ but without
power. The deal fell apart in 1988 and the administration stopped
calling for him to leave Panama.
   Last year, Noriega bought a home in the Dominican Republic,
raising prospects he could be persuaded to go there. However, the
Reagan administration scuttled any such deal on the grounds the
Dominican Republic was too close to Panama.

   Two private groups say the Freedom of
Information Act entitles them to copies of Oliver North's notebooks
from prosecutors in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The National Security Archive and Public Citizen filed suit
Wednesday in U.S. District Court, asking a judge to order
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh to turn over copies of some 3,000
pages of handwritten notes compiled by the former White House aide.
   The notes are daily accounts of North's activities in the Reagan
administration's Iran arms sale initiative and secret support for
the Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   North took the notebooks when he was fired in 1986 and was forced
to give copies of them to Walsh's office when he took the witness
stand in his own defense at his criminal trial. North was convicted
on three felony counts.
   In a July 24 letter, Walsh told the archive that ownership of the
documents is uncertain and denied its request to turn over copies,
according to the lawsuit.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for Walsh's office, declined to
comment on the lawsuit.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee subpoenaed the notebooks
more than a year ago.
   In an effort to cooperate with Congress, Walsh tried to turn over
copies to the White House in June but was rebuffed, according to
administration and congressional sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``We shall supply a copy of these documents to the National
Security Council along with a copy of your letter expressing a need
for them,'' Walsh said in a June 23 letter to Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., the foreign relations committee's chairman.
   It was shortly after sending the letter that a courier from
Walsh's office tried to deliver the documents to the NSC and was
told that ``they're not the property of the NSC,'' said one
government source.

<HEAD>Network Says More, Tougher DC-10 Inspections Considered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board
reportedly is likely to recommend more frequent and more thorough
inspections of all DC-10 engines as a result of the Sioux City,
Iowa, crash that killed 111 people.
   The safety board is ``fairly certain'' to make the recommendation
as a precaution against another explosive engine failure such as the
one that led to the July 19 crash of United Airlines Flight 232, ABC
News reported Wednesday.
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, an NTSB spokesman, said he could not confirm
whether the board was considering a recommendation for increased and
tougher inspections for DC-10 engines.
   ``We don't discuss anything that might be considered or discussed
until the board votes on a recommendation,'' he said.
   Nothing in the records for the engine and the plane showed any
problems or violations of maintenance regulations, the network
reported.
   Engines on two DC-10 passenger jets have suffered explosive
failure in the past month.
   About two weeks after the Sioux City, Iowa, crash, a Northwest
Airlines DC-10 made an emergency landing in Denver after its No. 2
tail engine apparently began disintegrating in flight.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has since formed a
government-industry task force that is examining possible design
changes in the planes manufactured by McDonnell-Douglas. Though the
DC-10 is no longer in production, McDonnell-Douglas plans a
derivative, the MD-11.
   Lopatkiewicz said investigators are still trying to find out what
caused the engine on Flight 232 to fail, sending pieces of the
engine flying and cutting hydraulic control lines.
   With pilots struggling to control the aircraft by changing power
on the remaining two engines, the United DC-10 with 296 aboard
cartwheeled into a cornfield while trying to land at Sioux City.
   ``Significant portions of the fan portion are still missing,''
Lopatkiewicz said, adding that search teams are looking for them
below the plane's flight path.
   Parts that have been recovered have been taken to the Evendale,
Ohio, plant of General Electric, the engine manufacturer, and are
being compared with engines produced at the same time.

   The 32 senators up for re-election next year
already have campaign warchests totaling more than $30 million, with
six raising more than $3 million each since their last elections, a
Common Cause study says.
   The 32 had a total of $30.6 million available to spend on June
30, said the report Wednesday by the self-styled citizen's lobby,
which is based on reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.
   The two top money-raisers since Jan. 1, 1985, were Sens. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., who raised $6.87 million by June 30; and Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, who raised $6.7 million.
   The other four were Jesse Helms, R-N.C., $5.4 million; Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn., $4.1 million; Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., $3.4
million; and John Kerry, D-Mass., $3.3 million.
   A total of 34 Senate seats are up next year but the Common Cause
compilation does not include Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo., and
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who are retiring.
   Since their last campaigns in 1984, the 32 senators have raised a
total of $53.57 million, including $10.73 million that came from
political action committees, Common Cause said.
   Following is a list of the cash-on-hand as of June 30 for the
senators up for election next year:
   Howell Heflin, D-Ala., $1.5 million; Ted Stevens, R-Ala.,
$468,000; David Pryor, D-Ark., $862,000; Joseph Biden, D-Del., $1.02
million; Sam Nunn, D-Ga., $822,000; James McClure, R-Idaho,
$299,491; Paul Simon, D-Ill., $1.22 million; Dan Coats, R-Ind.,
$482,588; Tom Harkin, R-Iowa, $856,445; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.,
$135,053.

   An earthquake measuring 4.7 on the Richter
scale shook southern Mexico on Wednesday, the National Seismological
Institute said.
   No damage or injuries were reported, the center said.
   The report said the quake occurred at 6:53 p.m. (8:55 p.m. EDT)
and was centered in the southern state of Guerrero, near the Pacific
coast.
   The temblor lasted eight seconds, the government news agency
Notimex quoted Pedro Pellandini of the National University as saying.
   The Richter scale gauges energy released by an earthquake. An
increase of one number means a 10-fold increase in the amount of
energy released.
   An earthquake measuring four on the Richter scale can cause
moderate damage. One registering five is capable of considerable
damage.
   An earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale hit the Mexico
City area on Sept. 19, 1985, killing at least 10,000 people.

   The death toll from fires in the United States hit
a seven-year high last year, signaling a need for stricter fire code
enforcement and widespread installation of smoke detectors, a trade
group said.
   The National Fire Protection Association said Wednesday the 1988
death toll of 6,215 people was up 7 percent over 1987, when there
were 405 fewer deaths.
   The report said steady progress has been made in reducing fire
deaths this century, but since 1982 fire deaths have remained fairly
constant, staying within 4 percent of 6,000 every year except 1984.
   ``The implications of the plateau reached by civilian fire deaths
are clear today as they have been for the last several years,'' the
report said. ``The steady stream of good news to which we have
become accustomed will not resume unless we make it.''
   The figures exclude 62 firefighters who died in the line of duty.
   Eight years ago, the death toll from fires hit 6,700. The
previous high had been 7,575 in 1979, said Julie Reynolds, a
spokeswoman for the non-profit association based in suburban Quincy.
   Fires caused property damage last year estimated at $8.35
billion, the report said, an increase of 16.7 percent from 1987.
   The report noted that a significant part of the total, 5.6
percent, resulted from large industrial fires at a refinery in
Norco, La., a chemical manufacturing plant in Henderson, Nev., and a
telephone switching station in Hinsdale, Ill.
   Fires caused by arson or suspected arson dropped 5.2 percent to
99,500 in 1988, but the association said the $1.594 billion in
property damage they caused still amounted to nearly a quarter of
the property loss in structures.
   Of the 1988 deaths, 5,065 happened in residential properties, an
increase of 8.7 percent over the previous year. The association
defines residential properties as one- and two-family houses,
apartments, mobile homes, hotels and motels.
   Michael J. Karter Jr., the association's senior statistician,
said a combination of education, greater use of smoke detectors and
wider installation of sprinkler systems in residential buildings are
needed to reduce fire deaths.
   Karter also called for steps to make home products safer,
including development of child-resistant cigarette lighters and
marketing of cigarettes that go out quickly when they are dropped or
thrown away.
   The association reported that public fire departments responded
to 2,436,500 fires last year, an increase of 4.6 percent from a year
earlier. About 30,800 people were injured in fires last year, the
association said.
   The report noted that wildfires sharply increased last year, with
675,500 brush and grass fires, an increase of more than 22 percent
over 1987. The drought that struck much of the country last summer
was blamed for most of that increase.
   The association arrived at its figures by sampling 2,948 fire
departments, including all departments that protect communities of
100,000 or more.

<HEAD>Jury Starts Deliberations Anew After Juror's Slaying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trouble-plagued jury in the ``Night
Stalker'' murder trial began deliberating anew after an alternate
replaced a slain juror to ponder the fate of Richard Ramirez.
   Attorneys for the 29-year-old drifter failed in their attempt to
suspend deliberations for a week, but they did not move for a
mistrial Wednesday. They said they wanted to research the law on the
unusual developments that have rocked the trial.
   ``The law is scant on this issue,'' defense attorney Ray G. Clark
said, adding that he would like to see the jurors reach verdicts.
   ``I like the jury,'' he said, ``so personally I'm not crazy about
a mistrial.
   Defense attorney Daniel Hernandez said he was contemplating a
motion asking that each juror be polled about their feelings after
the killing of Phyllis Singletary, 30, who was found beaten and shot
Monday. She had been working with the other jurors for a year.
   Ms. Singletary's live-in boyfriend, James Melton, later committed
suicide and left a note saying he killed her over a domestic dispute.
   ``Please understand that none of this had anything to do with
whether Mr. Ramirez is guilty or innocent of these charges,''
Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan told the jurors.
   ``We must get on with the task that life has given us,'' he told
them. ``No matter how deeply you feel about her death, it is in no
way connected to the case of Richard Ramirez.''
   Ramirez, from El Paso, Tex., is charged with 13 serial murders
and 30 related felonies in a summer 1985 rampage that terrified
Southern California.
   ``I have an objection,'' he shouted in court Wednesday, then
uttered an obscenity indicating he thought the trial was messed up.
   Tynan allowed jurors to start deliberating afresh after the jury
foreman, Felipe Rodriguez, said panelists had calmed down after
reacting tearfully to Ms. Singletary's death on Tuesday.
   ``Everyone appears to have put it behind them,'' he said.
   But Clark told the judge: ``I believe a cloud hangs over the jury
now, a cloud of sadness.'' His motion to suspend deliberations for a
week was denied.
   The jurors have been together since the trial began with jury
selection a year ago. Testimony took six months. Clark said he
believes jurors in such a long trial become ``closer than siblings''
and would be deeply affected by the death of one member.
   The attorney said he feared jurors would vent their anger over
Ms. Singletary's death on Ramirez.
   ``He's the only target they have,'' he said.
   It was the third time the jury had to make a fresh start. Last
week, after 13 days of talks, another juror had to be replaced by an
alternate for sleeping during deliberations.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer commuted the death
sentence of a man convicted of stabbing his landlady to death while
her children watched, although the governor said he did not believe
the man's claim of innocence.
   Ronald Monroe, 34, who was to have died in the electric chair
Aug. 30, will spend the rest of his life in prison without parole,
Roemer said Wednesday.
   Two different juries sentenced Monroe to death for the 1977 fatal
stabbing of Lenora Collins in her New Orleans home. Her children,
who were 11 and 12 at the time, testified that Monroe was the
murderer.
   Roemer met for nearly three hours Wednesday with defense
attorneys, prosecutors and Theodise Collins, now 24, who said again
she was sure Monroe was the murderer.
   Nevertheless, Roemer said information that has surfaced since the
conviction casts enough doubt on the case to waive the death
sentence. He cited defense claims that Lenora Collins was killed by
her ex-boyfriend, plus the fact that Monroe had no criminal record
and lived next door to Collins for years without violence.
   ``In an execution in this country, the test ought not be
reasonable doubt. The test ought to be, is there any doubt,'' Roemer
said.
   ``He met the test for guilty but not execution,'' the governor
said.
   Monroe, who has insisted he is innocent for more than a decade,
has labelled by his lawyers as borderline mentally retarded.
   Defense attorneys said Collins' ex-boyfriend, George Stinson,
admitted committing the murder in 1980 and had intimidated her
children into identifying Monroe as the killer. They said he had a
history of stabbing women and intimidating witnesses.
   None of those allegations were heard at Monroe's trials, defense
lawyer Douglas Morris said.
   However, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said last year
that there was no evidence to back up the defense claims.
   The panel noted that Stinson was given immunity and testified at
a special hearing that while serving time in Michigan for fatally
stabbing his common-law wife, he told a cellmate that Lenora Collins
died in a similar fashion. ``But he did not say or imply that he
personally had any guilt in her death,'' the court said.
   Theodise Collins talked to reporters Wednesday after meeting with
Roemer, but before he commuted the sentence. She said she would not
be angry if the governor spared Monroe's life, even though she felt
he should die.
   ``He has a job he has to do,'' she said of Roemer.
   No governor has commuted a death sentence in Louisiana since the
U. S. Supreme Court lifted its ban in the 1970s. Eighteen have died
in Louisiana, including three during the last 17 months that Roemer
has served as governor.

<HEAD>Utility Chief Says Nuclear Managers Ignored Warning of Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of a Maryland nuclear plant whose
performance has plummeted ignored warnings that complacency was
jeopardizing safety, the owner's chief executive told federal
regulators.
   George McGowan, chairman of Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., said he
had told supervisors at the Calvert Cliffs plant on Chesapeake Bay
that he saw ``a slippage setting in'' that threatened the plant's
reputation for efficiency and safety.
   ``I'm not so sure they believed what I had to say,'' McGowan on
Wednesday told members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   The NRC last December declared Calvert Cliffs one of the nation's
worst-run plants and intensified monitoring of its operations.
   The commissioners summoned McGowan and the utility's other top
officers to find out how Calvert Cliffs had fallen to the bottom of
the performance pile after long being considered one of the best-run
plants in the country.
   The plant's sudden fall from grace has raised new questions about
the NRC's ability to detect drops in plant performance levels before
serious accidents occur.
   Both of Calvert Cliffs' nuclear reactors were shut down last May
because of mechanical problems. A series of earlier mishaps at the
plant culminated in the accidental death last September of an
employee who drowned in a water storage tank.

<NOTE>Readers Tune Out Woodstock Anniversary</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans paid little attention to the
anniversary of Woodstock, but more than half closely followed news
stories about the airliner crash in Sioux City, Iowa, a survey says.
   The latest in a series of news indexes by the Times Mirror Center
for Press &amp; Public Policy, released Wednesday, indicated that 53
percent of respondents followed ``very closely'' the news reports
about the crash July 19 of the United Airlines DC-10, which killed
111 of the 296 on board.
   By contrast, 9 percent said they followed very closely the
stories about the anniversary of Woodstock, the upstate New York
rock festival that got under way 20 years ago Tuesday and is being
marked as a cultural milestone.
   The latest survey, conducted by the Gallup Organization Inc., was
done over a four-day period ending Sunday.
   The second-ranking story in the survey was the killing of Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins by his Lebanese captors, with 49 percent
saying they followed it very closely.
   Third, with 26 percent, was the passage in Congress of
legislation to bail out failing savings and loan institutions.

<NOTE>Skinner Asks Action on Air Accident Treaty</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is
asking the Senate to move swiftly to ratify a 14-year-old treaty
that would increase compensation for victims of international air
accidents.
   Skinner, in a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Wednesday, said the bombing last December of Pan American World
Airways Flight 103 ``serves to highlight the gross injustices that
exist'' because current treaty provisions limit compensation to
$75,000.
   The Senate has wrestled with the compensation question for more
than a decade.
   In 1975, the United States signed the so-called Montreal
Protocols to the Warsaw Convention, which would allow an increase in
compensation for international air accidents by establishing
supplemental compensation plans.
   While the Foreign Relations Committee twice has recommended the
Montreal Protocols be ratified, the Senate has failed to do so
because of criticism that proposed plans still did not provide for
enough compensation to international air travelers.
   Last year the Transportation Department offered a revised
supplemental compensation plan. It cast aside the proposed maximum
compensation of $317,000 and proposed an essentially unlimited
recovery plan per passenger that would be subject only to an overall
limit of $500 million per accident.
   The awards would come from a special fund established through a
$5 per passenger fee on round trip tickets for international air
travel.
   But the Senate never held hearings on the proposal before
adjourning.

<TEXT>
   Businesses are breathing uneasily as they face
the daunting task of complying with an anti-smog strategy designed
to clean up the nation's dirtiest air and transform the California
lifestyle.
   ``The plan is so encompassing and so broad in its scope that we
don't really know yet what the financial implications are as we go
into the next century,'' said Robert Raskin of Owens-Brockway Corp.,
a glass bottle maker with California plants in Vernon and Pomona.
   The plan, adopted this week, aims to bring the nation's smoggiest
air into compliance with federal laws by the year 2007, a process
drawing interest from the Bush administration, other states, Japan
and Europe.
   But it is the scope of the plan, a 45-volume collection of
documents that stands nearly 3 feet high, that has drawn concern
from businesses throughout one of the nation's premier manufacturing
centers.
   Proposals outlined in the plan would change the way companies do
business, government agencies operate and how people live and play
in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. For
example:
   _Sales of barbecue starter fluid, a petroleum distillate that
contributes to ozone, would be banned in favor of cleaner
alternatives, such as electric charcoal starters and tins of jellied
alcohol.
   _Dry cleaners would be required to use equipment that prevents
fumes from perchloroethylene, a dry cleaning chemical that
contributes to smog, from leaking into the air. About 1,760 dry
cleaners use the chemical.
   _Outboard and inboard engines for recreational boats sold in the
region would have to meet tougher air pollution control standards.
   _Banks and fast-food restaurants would be required to reduce the
time automobiles spend idling in drive-through lines. Idling motor
vehicles account for much of the carbon monoxide pumped into the air
each day.
   One particular worry among business executives, however, is the
uncertainty inherent in a strategy intended to guide regional air
quality regulators for the next 18 years.
   Owens-Brockway, the bottle-making firm, already is working to
reduce nitrogen oxides emissions from its gas-fired furnaces, in
accordance with the new rules.
   ``It definitely has been a financial burden,'' Raskin said,
though he declined to say how much of a burden.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``We regard ourselves as good corporate
citizens'' and his company supports the clean-air goals.
   At Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., ``The big impact for us is
in the area of things like paint, and what are called volatile
organic chemicals,'' said Ed Faeder, Lockheed's director of
environmental protection and safety.
   As of now, few, if any substitutes exist for certain solvents and
chromium-based paints specified for the military aircraft Lockheed
builds.
   Faeder said Lockheed and other defense firms are caught between
anti-pollution rules and Pentagon specifications.
   Also complicating matters for corporate employers are efforts to
curb air pollution by lessening Southern Californians dependence on
the automobile.
   The plan not only proposes new emission standards for cars and
trucks, but outlines new standards for cleaner-burning gasoline. It
sets a long-range course for switching to electric-powered cars and
aternative fuels such as methanol.
   Traffic reduction is sought in other ways, such as ordering
companies to develop ride-sharing programs and developing land-use
plans that ensure people live closer to their jobs.
   But the proposals have invoked the ire of developers and other
businesses.
   ``Our central concern all along has been with the growth
management control measures that are in this plan,'' said Bart
Doyle, a lawyer for the Building Industry Association of Southern
California. ``They tend to run roughshod over local control and
land-use planning measures that already are in effect.''
   David Neumann, a first vice president for Security Pacific Bank,
said it's too early to tell how well the ride-sharing requirements
will work out, but added:
   ``We certainly are taking the regulation seriously.''

<HEAD>Moon Eclipses Into Ghostly Disk Of Copper-Red</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The moon blushed in Alabama, turned taupe in Minneapolis, glowed
orange in Maine and Texas, and disappeared altogether in Washington
during a rare ``prime time'' full lunar eclipse that attracted awed
sky watchers from coast to coast.
   Clouds spoiled the view for much of the United States, but where
the skies were clear observers reported a spectacular celestial show
of light and color.
   In the nation's capital, the moon rose as a golden orange, tinted
grayish brown as the eclipse began, then winked out altogether as
the lunar disk swept into the dark inner core of the Earth's shadow.
   ``I finally saw one disappear,'' said Alan Fiala, a Naval
Observatory astronomer who has studied eclipses for 15 years. He
watched from the observatory roof and shook his head in wonder when
another astronomer noted, ``that thing done disappeared.''
   A little girl, watching with her mother in a park in Minneapolis,
also saw it fade from view.
   ``Is the moon going to come back tomorrow?'' she asked.
   In Mobile, Ala., a sky watcher said the moon turned into ``a
faintly glowing ball of red clay.''
   ``It's not flaming red,'' said Richard Stuefer, who watched the
eclipse with a friend in Minneapolis. ``It's kind of a taupe.''
   Astronomers at McDonald Observatory near Fort Davis, Texas, said
the moon faded to a faint orange glow with a slight tinge of blue.
   They fired a laser at the moon repeatedly, but said it was too
dark during the eclipse to aim accurately at their target, a
reflector left on the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts.
   In Portland, Maine, amateur astronomer Bill Hoyt was elated when
the moon dimmed to muted orange-neon disk.
   ``It's so impressive,'' he said. ``You can see the shadow going
across the moon in a curve, which the Greeks correctly interpreted
to mean the Earth is round. Only a round Earth could have a round
shadow.''
   Ron Abbott of the Astronomical Society of Kansas City called the
heavenly show ``clearly one of the best eclipses in 15 to 20 years.
The moon is dead in the middle of the Earth's shadow.''
   A moon-watching party in Richmond, Va., attracted 400 guests, but
clouds sent many of them home disappointed with only a partial
glimpse.
   ``It was perfect for about five minutes, but that's all we saw,''
said Mary Coleman Martin. ``We're disappointed, but we're grateful
we saw it at the halfway point.''
   Cosmos, Minn., a town of 550 with streets named for the planets
and other celestial bodies, didn't stage a moon-watching party.
   ``I guess nobody thought about it,'' said Barbara Minnick. But
she watched the eclipse anyway and reported, ``I stood on Milky Way
Avenue, which is our main street. ... I can see it good.''
   There were 150 amateur astronomers on the roof of the Museum of
Science in Boston who got to see the eclipsing moon, but they had to
look quickly. It appeared from behind clouds for a tantalizing 10
seconds, faded from view, and then came back for another 40 seconds.
   ``It was eerie and thrilling,'' said Mary Jane Dodge, a museum
employee. ``It was like this real bright white crescent that came
out of the clouds. Everyone was just going `Wow!' and then it
disappeared again and everybody said `Oh!'''
   Clouds blotted out the view at Harvard College Observatory and in
Portland, Ore.; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Cheyenne, Wyo.; Dallas and at
other eclipse-watch gatherings around the country. Rain spoiled a
moon party planned in Central Park in New York.
   ``Sadly, we'll have to wait for the next good eclipse, which may
be a while,'' said Harvard astrophysicist Clifford Stoll. ``This one
was a total loss.''
   ``Give us a rain check,'' said New York City Parks Commissioner
Henry Stern, who came to the Central Park event dressed in a space
suit as part of the city's celebration of the 20th anniversary of
man landing on the moon. ``Since the moon refused to shine, we'll
have to come back another day.''
   Hundreds of people gathered atop the Griffith Park Observatory
just north of downtown Los Angeles, and sky watchers also
congregated in the Mojave Desert Community of Lancaster.
   ``It's quite a show,'' said retired Marine aviator John
MacWhiter, who watched the eclipse in Lancaster. ``It's a marvel.''
   Lunar eclipses begin when the Earth's shadow nibbles away at the
moon to create a grayish veil that slowly drapes the lunarscape.
Then the dark heart of the Earth's shadow blots out the last trace
of silver and turns the moon a reddish hue.
   If there is smoke or haze in the atmosphere, as there was in
Washington, D.C., the moon can sometimes disappear from view
altogether.
   But it returns, just as it did Wednesday night, after an hour or
so. A faint crescent first appears, and then the lunar disk emerges,
little by little, out of the shadow and becomes whole again.
   Eclipsing colors have ranged from vibrant copper-red to a faint
orange glow. Shadows on the moon during one lunar eclipse in the
last century are said to have formed the outline of the African
continent.
   Wednesday night's celestial show was the first full lunar eclipse
visible over North America since Dec. 30, 1982, when viewers had to
arise in the pre-dawn hours. The last American prime-time eclipse,
occurring in the evening hours when most people are awake, was April
13, 1968. The next full lunar eclipse for Americans will be in
December 1992.
   If weather had permitted, the eclipse could have been in view of
more than a billion people. The Earth-moon alignment put the
eclipsing events in view of North and South America, western Europe
and Africa, and the Antarctic.
   Lunar eclipses occur when the moon passes through the shadow
created by the Earth, blocking the sun's light. The moon, in its
orbit of the Earth, usually passes above or below this shadowline,
but it occasionally follows a path that shades it completely for a
time, an event called a total eclipse.
   Eclipses of the moon occur generally twice a year, but many are
only partial or occur during post-midnight hours and are seen by few
people.

   The U.S. dollar moved higher against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo Thursday on expectations of improved U.S. trade
figures, while stock prices rose slightly, traders said.
   After opening higher at 142.25 yen, the dollar ended the day at

142.45 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average

   The U.S. currency started lower following dollar selling on the
Singapore and Sydney foreign exchange markets, but rose in afternoon
trading.
   Minoru Ozawa, a foreign exchange dealer with Taiyo Kobe Bank,
said dealers were positioning themselves before announcements of
U.S. housing starts and production capacity utilization rates later
Wednesday.
   On the stock exchange, Yoshio Shimoyama of Nikko Securities said
stocks were performing well in all sectors.
   He said that stock traders, too, were waiting to seeing the
outcome of the U.S. announcements, but were generally optimistic.

<HEAD>Low Oil Pressure Reading Cuts Short Second Flight of B-2 Bomber</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The B-2 stealth bomber
soared 10,000 feet over the desert floor, but a low oil-pressure
reading forced its second test flight to end several hours early.
   Air Force Col. Richard S. Couch and Northrop Corp. chief test
pilot Bruce J. Hinds brought the radar-evading aircraft down
Wednesday morning because of the reading, officials said.
   ``We don't even know if it's a problem yet. We're concerned with
it and will have to check it out,'' said 1st Lt. Anu Sjaardema, an
Air Force spokeswoman.
   The flight, scheduled to last three to four hours, began at 7:29
a.m. in the Mojave Desert and ended at 8:36 a.m.
   The two men were never in danger, and the plane did achieve at
least one objective by flying with its landing gear retracted for
the first time, Sjaardema said.
   Nevertheless, Couch and Hinds ``obviously would have liked to
accomplish more,'' she said.
   The government already has invested about $22.4 billion in the
B-2 program, and Congress has balked at paying more than $500
million apiece for the 132 bombers the military wants, making it the
most expensive airplane in history.
   Sjaardema said the big, black flying wing went ``a little bit
faster and a little bit higher'' than on the first flight in July.
But Air Force Maj. Dick Cole said later at the Pentagon that the
plane ``was flown to a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet and a maximum
air speed of 180 knots.'' That is the same elevation and speed as
during the two-hour maiden flight of July 17.
   Low oil pressure was reported in one of the plane's four
accessory drives. Each drive is like a transmission, connected to
one of the B-2's four engines by a shaft. The drives power air
turbine starters and hydraulic systems, Sjaardema said.
   Air turbine starters are used to start engines, a Northrop
spokesman said. The B-2's hydraulics apparently control its landing
gear, but it isn't known if they are used to move flaps and other
control surfaces, as is the case on many planes. Tech. Sgt. Donn
Clarius said there was no failure of the hydraulic system.
   It was the second setback in two days for the flying wing.
   Delays caused by wind and a long list of preflight checks on
Tuesday forced officials to move the test back a day.
   The Air Force's first attempt to fly the plane last month was
aborted because of a low fuel-pressure reading. That problem was
fixed.

   A study of adopted children showed that being
raised by a well-to-do family or being born to privileged parents
raised IQ scores.
   The study is one of the first to clearly separate the effects of
heredity and environment on IQ scores, said Matthew McGue, a
behavioral geneticist at the University of Minnesota.
   ``It's a well-designed study, and the results are clean and
clear,'' he said Wednesday. ``There is an effect of biology, and
there is an effect of rearing circumstances.''
   The study found that adopted children raised by privileged
families had IQ scores 12 points higher than adopted children raised
by poorer families.
   And adopted children whose parents were privileged had IQ scores
15 points higher than adopted children born to poorer families,
regardless of the status of the families that raised them.
   Children who had well-to-do parents and privileged upbringing
scored highest of all.
   An increase of 12 to 15 points in IQ score ``is actually very
large,'' McGue. ``Twelve points is comparable to the difference
between people who go to college and the general population.''
   The study, by Christiane Capron and Michel Duyme of the
University of Paris, appears today in the scientific journal Nature,
along with a commentary by McGue. Capron and Duyme are on vacation
this week and could not be reached.
   The study does not say anything about the reasons for the
observed increases in IQ. For example, McGue said, it does not
explain whether the elevated IQs in the children raised in
privileged families might be the result of access to better schools,
or more emphasis on reading, or a variety of other factors.
   Similarly, it does not explain how the genetic effect might
operate. Some researchers believe that some children are born with
more efficient brains, but others argue that some children are
merely born with, say, a predilection for reading or some other
activity that might lead to better intellectual performance.
   ``Making a general statement that genes somehow influence mental
development doesn't get us anywhere,'' said Douglas Wahlsten, a
behavioral geneticist at the University of Alberta in Canada. ``But
if we can point to a specific gene, learn how it works, what it does
in the body, that knowledge can be helpful. It can help us to
produce a better outcome in development.''
   Researchers have argued for years over the relative importance of
heredity and environment in determining intelligence.
   Previous studies attempting to resolve the conflict have
generally used a broad cross-section of adopted children or twins.
Statistical tests were generally used to try to separate the
relative contributions of genes and environment, said Jerry Hirsch,
a professor of psychology and biology at the University of Illinois.
   Hirsch believes those statistical manipulations are faulty.
``They tend to confirm prejudices, and they're not as rigorous as we
would like them to be,'' he said.
   The study by Capron and Duyme avoided the need for such
statistical tests by carefully selecting the subjects for study,
said Wahlsten.
   They looked at 38 children for whom the socioeconomic status of
the biological parents and the adoptive parents was known. The
strict selection criteria justified the use of small numbers of
subjects, the researchers wrote.

<HEAD>Lawyers Seek Suppression of Hazelwood's Alcohol Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for fired Exxon skipper Joseph
Hazelwood say his sobriety-test results should be thrown out with
two of the six charges against him.
   In legal motions filed Wednesday, they also asked to move
Hazelwood's Oct. 30 trial out of Valdez.
   The request to suppress results of a blood-alcohol test given to
Hazelwood after the oil tanker that he supervised ran aground March
24 is based on several arguments, including the assertion that the
test was given illegally.
   ``The approved method for determining blood alcohol in Alaska is
the Breathalyzer,'' said attorney Ken Covell, who is assisting
Fairbanks attorney Dick Madson in Hazelwood's defense. ``Generally
speaking, you can't force somebody to submit to a blood-alcohol
test.''
   Hazelwood was not offered a breath test and did not consent to a
blood test, Covell said.
   Hazelwood failed the blood test for sobriety, performed about 10
hours after the accident that occurred early the morning of Good
Friday.
   The 987-foot Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Prince William Sound
and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil. The spill was the
nation's worst and is expected to have environmental effects for
years.
   Hazelwood of Huntington, N.Y., faces misdemeanor charges of
operating a vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and
negligent discharge of pollutants. A felony indictment charges him
with three counts of second-degree criminal mischief. He is free on
$50,000 bail.
   The motions filed Wednesday seek dismissal of the endangerment
and pollution charges.
   ``Essentially the facts alleged, even if proven at trial, would
not substantiate a conviction on those charges,'' Covell said.
   The motion for a change of venue does not specify an alternative
location, but ``Fairbanks would afford Capt. Hazelwood the best
opportunity to obtain a fair trial,'' Covell said.
   The state has 21 days to respond to the motions.

   American bases in the Philippines are
so important to regional security that Congress will probably
support any agreement to allow them to stay, a U.S. lawmaker said
today.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., made the statement during a news
conference before concluding a four-day visit.
   Fascell, leader of a six-member delegation and chairman of the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said talks with President
Corazon Aquino and other officials on the bases made him feel ``more
optimistic than I did when I came here.''
   The U.S. and Philippine governments are expected to begin talks
later this year on whether to extend the lease on the bases.
   The lease expires in September 1991 and Mrs. Aquino refuses to
say whether she supports an extension. Any extension is subject to
ratification by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine Senate, where
sentiment against the bases is strong.
   Fascell said many nations in Southeast Asia see the presence of
the U.S.-run Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and the four other
smaller military installations as essential to stability in the
region.
   ``All the countries in the Pacific basin recognize the importance
of mutual security and the value of it in this area,'' Fascell said.
``I don't anticipate that we we would have any great difficulty in
reaching an understanding.''
   U.S. officials say the bases are essential to maintaining the
balance of military power in the Far East and protecting sea lanes
to Japan and the newly industralized countries of East Asia.
   But Filipino critics say the bases represent an infringment on
national sovereignty and contribute to social problems such as drug
addiction and prostitution.
   Critics also say the United States regularly interferes in
internal Philippine affairs to keep the bases. About 40,000 American
service members, civilian employees and military dependents are
stationed here.
   Fascell's delegation is among three groups of U.S. congressmen to
visit the Philippines this month. Fascell's group also will visit
Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.
   The others in his party are Democratic Reps. Sander Levin of
Michigan and William Richardson of New Mexico, and Republican Reps.
William Bloomfield of Michigan, Benjamin Gilman of New York and Ben
Blaz of Guam.
   On Wednesday, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who is leading another
delegation, said he hoped the two countries could agree to extend
the bases. If not, he said, the United States would develop
``operative facilities elsewhere'' in the Pacific.

   President Bush is following the case of anti-Castro
militant Orlando Bosch but won't respond to calls for his freedom
while the case is in federal court, a Cuban-born Republican
congressional nominee said.
   ``The president himself brought it up on Air Force One,'' said
state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who flew to Miamia on Wednesday with
Bush from Washington for a luncheon that raised at least $250,000
for her campaign. ``He was well abreast on it.''
   Bush noted that Bosch has a hearing next month before a federal
judge, she said. Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Bush would not comment on the matter.
   ``He's going to be interested in seeing what the decision is
going to be,'' Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said.
   While the case is in court, ``it's not really a presidential
matter,'' she said. ``If and when that time comes, certainly we're
going to call on the President to try to help out.''
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who faces Democratic attorney Gerald Richman in
an Aug. 29 special election to replace the late Rep. Claude Pepper,
has long urged that Bosch, 62, be freed. She made a similar appeal
to Ronald Reagan during his last presidential visit to Miami last
year.
   Bosch, a Cuban-born pediatrician, was taken into custody by
federal officers when he returned to this country in February 1988.
He had spent 11 years in Venezuelan prisons successfuly fighting
accusations that he masterminded a 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner
near Barbados, killing 73 people.
   After reviewing his case, the Justice Department this year
ordered Bosch's deportation. Federal officials have said Bosch has a
long history of terrorist activities, including during the 1960s
when he lived in Miami. He was convicted in 1968 of firing a small
artillery weapon at a Polish freighter at the Port of Miami, and
later fled the United States, violating his probation.
   But his supporters point out that he was acquitted three times in
Venezuelan courts on the Cuban bombing. They say he is a heroic
freedom fighter who is a victim of changing U.S. policy.
   Bosch had the active support of the Central Intelligence Agency
during his 1960s anti-Castro exploits, which included bombing raids
over Cuba, they say.
   Bosch's appeal of the deportation order will be taken up in U.S.
District Court next month.
   Many Republican officials, whose increasing clout in Florida has
been boosted by the conservative Cuban-American community, have
voiced support for Bosch's release. He's being held without bond in
a federal prison near here.

<HEAD>Immune Problems May Play Key Role in Headache, Researcher Says</HEAD>

   Research suggesting that an overactive immune
system may cause headache pain is of limited use in treating the
estimated one in 20 Americans who suffer from it almost daily,
medical experts say.
   ``It's interesting, but it's a curiosity, when its comes right
down to it,'' Dr. Fred Freitag, associate director of the Diamond
Headache Clinic in Chicago, said of findings that link headaches to
alterations in the immune system.
   Dr. Lawrence Robbins, the suburban neurologist who conducted the
research said, ``Everything we know about headaches fits in with the
hypothesis that the immune system is involved in some integral way.
   ``We know that people with lupus have an overactive immune
system, and they get many, many more migraines than other people,''
said Robbins, head of the Robbins Headache Clinic in Northbrook.
   Lupus occurs when the immune system attacks the body's own
connective tissues, causing symptoms ranging from a rash to joint
pain and even death.
   ``We know that steroids _ cortisone _ which decrease the immune
system, help migraine headaches very much,'' Robbins said Wednesday.
   And now, he said, researchers are looking into whether AIDS
patients who have a history of migraines get fewer headaches once
the AIDS virus depresses their immune systems.
   ``The preliminary results appear to indicate that is happening,''
said Robbins, who has enlisted researchers in four headache studies
of AIDS patients.
   Robbins and two colleagues reported in May that they had analyzed
the blood of 75 headache patients _ including sufferers of migraines
and chronic tension headaches _ and 32 other people. The researchers
found that the headache patients had 30 percent fewer immune system
cells of a type known as suppressor cells, which slow the body's
disease-fighting response.
   Suppressor cells work in combination with helper cells, which
push the immune system along, he said. In AIDS patients, the helper
cells are relatively few. In headache patients, the helpers are
relatively many.
   ``In a way, you could say the immune system is overactive,'' said
Robbins, who reported his findings in the May issue of the journal
Headache and presented them in June at the 31st annual meeting of
American Association for the Study of Headache in Boston.
   Dr. Egilius Spierings, director of the John R. Graham Headache
Centre at Faulkner Hospital in Boston, said he believes that even
though Robbins' research is sound, it is of limited use because
headaches have many causes.
   ``I don't think this is something that would account for a large
proportion of the headache suffering we see,'' Spierings said in a
telephone interview.
   He said headache causes most often include fatigue, caffeine
consumption, atmospheric conditions, eye and postural strain,
oversleeping, hormonal factors, emotional stress and even excess
pain medication.
   ``I wouldn't know how to place his findings in our current pool
of knowledge and understanding,'' said Spierings.
   Freitag was skeptical of the findings.
   ``What are we going to do? We don't have any tools to help us. If
we could decrease the number of helper cells, would that decrease
the headaches? I don't believe it would,'' he said.
   ``I have people in my practice who have AIDS, and who still have
migraine headaches,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study: Vitamins Do Not Protect Against Birth Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who take vitamins before they get pregnant do
not reduce the risk of birth defects, a study concludes.
   The research contradicts earlier reports suggesting that women
who take multiple vitamins before they conceive are less likely to
have babies with defects of the neural tube, which develops into the
brain and spinal cord.
   ``We found that vitamin use was associated with neither an
increased nor a decreased risk of neural tube defects,'' wrote the
authors of the latest study.
   The work was conducted by Dr. James L. Mills and colleagues from
the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. It was
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The doctors asked 571 women who had babies with neural tube
defects whether they had taken vitamin pills or eaten
vitamin-fortified cereal before they got pregnant. They were
compared with 573 mothers of healthy babies and 546 who had babies
with other birth defects.
   The researchers found no difference in vitamin use between the
three groups.
   ``These results indicate that the use of vitamin supplements by
American women'' around the time of conception ``is unlikely to lead
to any important reduction in the frequency of neural tube
defects,'' the researchers wrote.
   Types of neural tube defects include anencephaly, in which babies
are born without a cerebrum.

   Six workers waiting outside the Sejm were
adamant when they approached a Solidarity senator on his way to an
urgent meeting on who will govern Poland.
   ``Do something. Have you seen the price of bread? We can't make
ends meet anymore,'' one told Sen. Lech Kaczynski.
   Lawmakers moved through the corridors of parliament Wednesday in
search of a solution to the protracted political and economic
crisis, and by dawn today, a Solidarity-led governing coalition had
emerged as a real possibility.
   Kaczynski urged the workers to have patience, and cautioned them
against staging a strike today.
   ``Strikes are the worst thing now,'' he told them as he rushed to
a meeting of lawmakers from Solidarity and two smaller parties that
are preparing to form a non-Communist coalition.
   After a government minister droned too long about the rising
price of bread and coal, a Solidarity deputy inquired whether it
wasn't premature to discuss the government budget when there was no
government yet.
   As interest waned in parliamentary proceedings, lawmakers left
the chamber and resumed speculating: Would there be a Solidarity-led
coalition? Would the Communists accept such a configuration? Does
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa want to become prime minister?
   Many of the politicians who could provide answers stayed away
from reporters. Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak huddled with top
Solidarity advisers Bronislaw Geremek and Jacek Kuron, and voices
lowered when reporters drew near.
   ``I understand when I don't understand what the Communists are
doing, but I don't understand when I don't understand what we are
doing,'' said one leading Solidarity deputy over lunch.
   The pace of debate quickened late in the day when Solidarity
lawmakers drew up and approved a resolution calling for a
non-Communist coalition government, the first in the East bloc.
   ``We have to go fast. The situation is deteriorating from hour to
hour,'' Kaczynski told a reporter in the corridor.
   Solidarity has hesitated before taking responsibility for the
country's economic crisis, but now its lawmakers seem to feel that
only a government they create will have real public support.
   ``We must take some risks. Such are the times,'' Deputy Jaroslaw
Kaczynski told opposition lawmakers.
   The Solidarity meeting was joined by the independent movement's
two new allies, the Peasant and Democratic parties, long allied with
the Communists but now ready to form an opposition coalition.
   During the three-way discussion, Solidarity lawmaker Aleksander
Malachowski interrupted a speaker and asked where the Communists
were.
   ``I had the impression that a miracle had taken place, that the
Communist Party had evaporated from this country,'' he said.
   Actually, they were in another chamber just out of earshot,
debating a resolution on Poland's participation in the invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   That debate seemed irrelevant to one Communist lawmaker who was
taking a cigarette break.
   ``I don't know, I just don't know. It's strange, very strange,''
she said when asked why the 1968 invasion was being debated at such
a time.
   ``By the way, what's going on at the other meeting?'' she asked.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shellfire jolted Beirut overnight despite
a fragile lull that followed a cease-fire call by the U.N. Security
Council, police said today.
   Statements from both the Christian army command and the militias
allied with Syria recognized the cease-fire, but rejected conditions
outlined by their opponents to end the devastating, 5-month
confrontation.
   A police spokesman said two people were killed and 22 wounded in
the intermittent exchanges with howitzers and mortars across
Beirut's dividing Green Line, the southeastern mountains and the
northern flank of the Christian enclave.
   By police count, 774 people have been killed and 2,073 wounded
since March in the confrontation between Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000
predominantly Christian troops and Syria's 40,000 soldiers and
allied Lebanese militias.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said the latest salvo of howitzer shells was fired by
Syrian gunners from Moslem west Beirut against the
Christian-controlled coastline north of Beirut at 3:15 a.m.
   The 130mm Soviet-made shells damaged the Christian port of
Jounieh, but no casualties were reported, the spokesman said.
   He said Syrian and Christian snipers manning rooftop nests also
exchanged fire across the Green Line separating the Moslem and
Christian sectors.
   ``The intensity of the clashes has decreased sharply compared to
the waves of random shelling before the cease-fire call,'' the
spokesman said.
   One independent observer who spoke on condition of anonymity said
both sides appeared to be observing a ``cease-fire of convenience.
They are quietly bolstering their forces.''
   The Syrians and Aoun's force have been fighting since March 8.
The battle has ravaged Beirut. In addition to the dead, the
casualties include 2,051 wounded, six of them Wednesday. Nearly all
the casualties have been civilians.
   The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved the cease-fire
resolution Tuesday in New York during an emergency meeting called by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   A spokesman for Aoun said Wednesday: ``The general
unconditionally welcomes the U.N. Security Council resolution. The
resolution as we understand it is a package deal that involves not
just a cease-fire, but also lifting of blockades and programming the
Syrian military pullout from Lebanon.''
   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive out the Syrian
troops deployed in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate granted in
1976, the year after the sectarian civil war began. Aoun has said
the Syrians lost their mandate as a peacekeeping force when they
sided with Moslems.
   The spokesman claimed Aoun's gunners, entrenched in the Christian
enclave, were ``abiding by the cease-fire call. But they don't need
orders to fire back if they were shelled.''
   An alliance of Lebanese leftist and Moslem militias backed by
Syria and Iran announced a ``conditional approval'' of the
cease-fire call.
   In a statement from Damascus, Syria, the Nationalist Front said
it ``accepts the call for a cease-fire provided that an
inter-Lebanese committee be formed to monitor the Lebanese coast and
prevent the delivery of arms shipments to Aoun.''
   The Aoun spokesman, however, said: ``The concept of an
inter-Lebanese committee is totally rejected by us.''
   ``Our war has not been with Lebanese factions. We've been
fighting the Syrians for more than five months and now they want to
forge facts and say the conflict is between Lebanese groups. We will
not accept this at all,'' he said.
   The Aoun spokesman said the cease-fire call will ``face a major
test when any ship tries to dock at our ports. If they shell it,
we'll certainly respond.''
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, Syria's closest ally in the
Nationalist Front, rejected the cease-fire call altogether.
   ``Either Aoun goes or it is war to the end,'' Jumblatt said in a
statement broadcast by Voice of the People radio.
   Earlier, Syrian President Hafez Assad told Italian Premier Giulio
Andreotti he will try to ``silence the guns'' in Lebanon and promote
a peace settlement. In Washington, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher read a statement that said, in part, ``The senseless
bloodshed ... has gone on for far too long and it must cease.''
   Druse fighters manning Jeep-mounted machine guns and recoilless
cannons were seen in west Beirut for the first time since Syrian
troops moved into the Moslem sector in February 1987 to stop
fighting among militias.
   The Lebanese capital, divided into Moslem and Christian sectors,
has suffered the brunt of the fighting. About 90 percent of its 1.5
million people have left since the shelling began in March.
   The artillery war began two days after Aoun's forces blockaded

<HEAD>Amanda Blake Who Played Miss Kitty in `Gunsmoke' Dies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amanda Blake, who played Miss Kitty in
television's long-running ``Gunsmoke'' series, has died of cancer at
age 60.
   Mercy General Hospital spokeswoman Jerri Ewen read a statement
late Wednesday saying Miss Blake, a longtime resident of the
Sacramento area, died Wednesday evening. She said memorial services
were being planned.
   Miss Blake, a one-time two-pack-a-day smoker, had undergone
surgery for oral cancer in 1977, and afterward made appearances
throughout the country on behalf of the American Cancer Society.
   In 1984, the society named her as the recipient of its annual
Courage Award, which President Reagan presented in the Oval Office.
   Miss Blake was born Feb. 20, 1929, as Beverly Louise Neill in
Buffalo, N.Y., according to a biography prepared by CBS during the
``Gunsmoke'' series.
   She was educated in Buffalo, Gainesville, Ga., and Claremont,
Calif., where she moved with her parents in 1943.
   She made her dramatic debut as a 10-year-old in a school pageant
in Buffalo, and later studied acting at Buffalo's Studio Club. She
signed a contract with MGM while still in her teens, and her first
film role was in the 1950 film, ``Stars in My Crown.''
   Miss Blake was at CBS when she heard that the successful
``Gunsmoke'' radio show was going to be made into a television
pilot. The first show was in 1955.
   ``I knew I had to have the part of Kitty, so I hounded the
producer until I got it,'' she said in a 1971 interview.
   To do the ``Gunsmoke'' series, Miss Blake commuted by private
plane from her home near Phoenix.
   Miss Blake left ``Gunsmoke'' in 1974 after 19 years.
   In a 1984 interview with the Los Angeles Times, she said: ``I was
tired and it was time to go. It was the end of the trail. The show
only lasted one more year without me.''
   ``Gunsmoke'' was set in Dodge City, Kan., in the late 1800s,
starring James Arness as Marshal Matt Dillon, Milburn Stone as
``Doc'' Adams and Miss Blake as Kitty Russell, the owner and
operator of the Longbranch Saloon.
   ``Gunsmoke'' was broadcast for 20 years, longer than any other
series with continuing characters in the history of television,
according to ``The Complete Directory of Prime Time Network TV
Shows.''
   After ``Gunsmoke,'' Miss Blake worked only sporadically, usually
in guest appearances for television game shows, made-for-TV movies
and such series as ``Hart to Hart,'' and ``Love Boat.''
   Her fifth marriage, in April 1984, was to Mark Spaeth, an Austin,
Texas, city councilman and developer. They later divorced.
   No information on survivors was available.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains, Tokyo Stocks Nearly Unchanged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar gained against the Japanese yen
today on expectations of an improved U.S. trade deficit, while the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index was almost unchanged.
   The dollar closed at 142.32 yen, up 0.52 yen from Wednesday's
close of 141.80 yen. Following a rise on the New York market, it
opened in Tokyo at 142.25 and ranged between 142.20 yen and 142.45
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Index of 225 selected issues rose 5.96 points,
or 0.02 percent, closing at 35,090.11.
   Foreign exchange traders were anticipating an improvement in the
U.S. merchandise trade statistics for June to be announced later
today by the Department of Commerce, said a dealer at Mitsui Bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Other dealers said the market lacked direction as it waited for
the trade figures, but most participants expected the data to show
an improvement.
   ``If the trade figures are as expected, the dollar will be pushed
to the 143-yen level in the Tokyo market,'' said a dealer with the
Bank of Tokyo, also requesting anonymity.
   The Nikkei's slight gain compares with a rise on Wednesday of
273.46 points.
   One trader, requesting anonymity, said most market participants,
including institutional investors, hesitated to act before
announcement of the U.S. trade figures. Volume was a slow 450
million shares.
   Traders reported a shift of buying interest from high-priced
issues, bought mainly for quick profit-taking, to shares with lower
price-earnings ratios.

<HEAD>Former Governor Says He Won't Run Against Helms in 1990</HEAD>

   Former Gov. Jim Hunt's decision not to seek
a rematch against Republican Sen. Jesse Helms leaves the way open
for a host of fresh Democratic faces to enter the race.
   Hunt said Wednesday he thought he could beat Helms, but he said
his mother's poor health persuaded him not to run. He also indicated
he wasn't eager for a replay of his bitter 1984 race against Helms,
although he said that wasn't why he was bowing out.
   ``I especially believe I would win if the campaign focused on the
issues and on the future of North Carolina and the nation,'' he said
in a statement. ``But, given the experience of 1984, that probably
would not be its nature. Further, given the result of 1984, it is
clear that I do not enjoy or perform very well in a campaign that
emphasizes negative ads and character attacks.''
   Hunt and Helms spent a national record $26 million in a race
marked by negative campaigning and personal slurs. Helms won by a
52-to-48 percent margin against the backdrop of former President
Reagan's landslide re-election win.
   Helms said he was relieved he would not face Hunt.
   ``Mr. Hunt has demonstrated in four elections that he is always a
formidable opponent,'' Helms said in a statement. ``I would be less
than honest if I did not acknowledge that I was glad to learn of his
announcement today.''
   Hunt, 52, is a partner in a Raleigh law firm. He served four
years as lieutenant governor and was the first governor to serve
successive four-year terms.
   National Democratic leaders had been pushing Hunt to run again.
   Former state Sen. Bo Thomas, the only Democrat actively
campaigning for the nomination, welcomed Hunt's decision, saying it
``is not the time or place for him to run.'' Thomas said he expected
other Democrats to enter the race.

   The Soviet Union will allow thousands
of Koreans living in the Soviet Far Eastern district of Sakhalin to
visit their homeland, governing party sources said today.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Rep. Kim
Hyon-wook of the governing Democratic Justice Party is in the Soviet
Union discussing procedures for Koreans to return to their homeland
for the first time since World War II ended in 1945.
   Thousands of Koreans were brought to Sakhalin by Japan as forced
labor in the final years of the war. They since have been stranded
there simply because of the lack of diplomatic relations between
Seoul and Moscow.
   But the two coutries exchanged trade offices this year and the
Soviet Union, closely allied with communist North Korea, has shown
willingess to promote non-political ties with South Korea.
   Officials of the Democratic Justice Party said about 36,000
Koreans are living in Sakhalin and that about 3,000, mostly
first-generation Koreans, want to return home permanently or at
least visit.
   Under an agreement with Soviet officials, a chartered South
Korean plane may be allowed to bring home several hundred Koreans
before the end of the year, the party sources said.
   They said the South Korean government would pay all travel
expenses.
   The central executive committee of the Democratic Justice Party
reviewed the issue today and discussed seeking financial
compensation from Japan for the Korean residents of Sakhalin, the
party sources said.

<HEAD>Ship Sails With Toxic Waste Still Aboard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet freighter carrying Canadian
toxic waste intended for incineration in Britain sailed from
Liverpool early today with the cargo still aboard after port owners
refused to unload it.
   David Boyle of the Association of Waste Disposal Contractors said
the freighter, Nadezhda Obukhova, was returning to Montreal with its
cargo of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
   The British government had insisted that incineration of the
waste posed no threat to health and Boyle condemned the refusal of
port owners and dockworkers at the northwest port of Liverpool to
unload it.
   ``There is no reason whatsoever why on environmental grounds
these cargoes should not be handled,'' Environment Secretary Chris
Patten said Wednesday. ``We haven't been and we're not going to be
the dustbin of the world.''
   But Greenpeace and other environmental groups that campaigned
against the waste being brought to Britain said the freighter's
departure was a victory.
   The ship discharged and loaded some containers but the ones
holding the PCBs remained on board and the vessel sailed from
Liverpool shortly before dawn.
   The PCBs had been destined for destruction in a special
high-temperature incinerator in south Wales.
   The Mersey Docks and Harbor Co., backing dockworker leaders,
refused to handle the cargo after Greenpeace succeeded with a highly
publicized protest in blocking another PCBs cargo at a south England
port, Tilbury.
   Tilbury turned away the shipment, also from Canada, after
protesters attached a skull and crossbones banner to the freighter
while television camera crews filmed from media launches and
helicopters.
   British newspapers have taken up the issue, with mass circulation
newspapers carrying headlines such as ``Ship of Shame.''
   London's liberal Observer newspaper, usually sympathetic to
Greenpeace, this week accused the environmental movement of ``going
overboard.''
   Its protests are aimed at blocking 15 shipments from Canada that
a British disposal company, Rechem, has contracted to handle at its
South Wales plant. The company says it will ``defend its position.''
   PCBs were used primarily as a coolant in electrical transformers,
but have been banned in North America because of links to cancer.
   Government officials argue that Britain has the technology to
dispose of the material and strict safety regulations.
   Greenpeace spokesman Tim Birch said Wednesday that by allowing
the imports Britain was ``encouraging the global toxic waste
crisis.''
   Canada's only incinerator capable of disposing of PCBs is in
Alberta and does not accept wastes from other provinces.

<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 people fleeing government
raids in southern Somalia have crossed into neighboring Kenya the
last two weeks, according to a newspaper report.
   The refugees started moving into Kenya July 31 after Somali
troops killed 27 people in five days of raids near Doble, 12 miles
east of Kenya's border, The Standard reported Wednesday.
   The daily said the refugees were camped in Harhar, a town
straddling the Kenya-Somalia border about 300 miles northeast of
Nairobi.
   The raids reportedly followed government charges that the Absame
clan, the largest in southern Somalia, was expelling members of
President Siad Barre's Marehan clan from the region, the newspaper
said.
   One of those fleeing the fighting, Ahmed Hussein Barre, told The
Standard he was the former police chief in the Doble district and
said the raid was the fifth in the region.
   Ahmed Hussein Barre said that after the raids he and another
former security officer had turned against the government and would
battle to bring it down, according to the newspaper.
   The Somali National Movement has been fighting in northern
Somalia to topple the government since 1981.
   Since fighting intensified in northern Somalia in May 1988,
hundreds of thousands of Somalis have fled into refugee camps in
eastern Ethiopia.
   The government has refused to let journalists visit Somalia since
May 1988, and residents contacted by telephone in Mogadishu have
little knowledge of events outside the capital.

<HEAD>Two Years Later, Survivors Gather to Mourn 156 Crash Victims</HEAD>

   Jets thundered overhead and cars zoomed
past on the nearby interstate as 300 people gathered on a hill where
Northwest Flight 255 crashed two years ago, killing 156 people.
   The Phoenix-bound MD-80 crashed after takeoff from Detroit
Metropolitan Airport on the evening of Aug. 16, 1987, killing all
but one of the 155 people aboard as well as two passing motorists.
   ``All the people here _ they know what you've experienced. They
know how you feel,'' said mourner Nancy Engelhart of Bay City.
   As she did last year, she drove the 90 miles from Bay City on
Wednesday to attend the memorial service at Middlebelt Road and
Interstate 94 in suburban Romulus. Around her neck hung a color
photo of a couple and two children.
   ``This is my sister, Sue Byelich, and her husband, Don,''
Engelhart said.``They had their two boys with them, Mike and Brad.
The whole family was wiped out.''
   Her sister's family was on their way back to Phoenix after a
visit.
   ``My brother-in-law had his folks' golden wedding anniversary the
night before the crash,'' she said.
   The two years haven't erased the pain of their loss, Engelhart
said.
   ``It's hard to get used to,'' she said. ``You still expect to see
them walk through the door.''
   The jet failed to gain altitude during takeoff and slammed into
an overpass on the interstate.
   The sole survivor was Cecelia Cichan, then 4. She is living with
her aunt and uncle, Rita and Frank Lumpkin, in Birmingham, Ala.,
shielded from the media. She lost her parents and 6-year-old brother
in the crash.
   At the site, 12 rows of white wooden doves, 156 in all, bore the
names of the victims. At 8:46 p.m., the exact time of the crash, the
Rev. Ron Lund began reading the names of the dead.
   ``William Acker, George Amabile, Jamie Amabile ... '' he began.
As each name was called out, survivors flicked on pen lights and
pointed them toward the darkening sky. Ten times, passing jets
interrupted the roll call.
   Lund, a leader of the survivors' group Flight 255: The Spirit
Lives On, said their grief has drawn members together.
   ``This is our second anniversary family gathering, because we are
a family,'' he told the gathering. ``We wipe each others tears. We
joke together now, but we didn't always.''
   Not mentioned at the ceremony was a liability trial scheduled to
begin Oct. 2 in U.S. District Court in Detroit.
   Northwest attorney Carroll Dubuc says it could take four to five
months to settle the 102 suits pending against Northwest and
McDonnell Douglas, which built the aircraft. Forty-six suits have
been settled, Dubuc said. Federal investigators cited pilot error as
the cause of the crash.
   Edward Shepherd of Sun Lakes, Ariz., lost a niece, Dorian
Wallington, 13, and granddaughter, Arlene Nelson, 12, in the crash.
   ``The things that bring it back are when you see the family photo
album and see their pictures,'' Shepherd said.

   A tanker captain was overworked and
distracted, causing the oil spill off Newport for which he and a
shipping company have agreed to pay $510,000 in fines, a prosecutor
said.
   The captain, Iakovos Georgudis, and Ballard Shipping Co. each
pleaded guilty Wednesday to one misdemeanor count of violating the
federal Clean Water Act.
   Almost 300,000 gallons of heating oil flowed from the Greek
tanker World Prodigy when it ran aground June 23 on Brenton Reef at
the mouth of Narragansett Bay.
   Georgudis, 43, of Athens, Greece, agreed to pay a $10,000 fine to
avoid prison and Ballard, a Liberian company, agreed to pay $500,000
to the state for environmental research and land acquisition.
   U.S. District Judge Ernest C. Torres set sentencing for Sept. 15
but reserved the right to reject the pleas if a presentence
investigation turned up other facts.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln Almond said Georgudis ``became distracted
and was also doing computations to double-check'' estimates of how
oil would have to be shifted for unloading.
   ``The ship at some point should have taken a left turn,'' he said.
   Instead, it ran straight onto the rocks.
   According to testimony at a U.S. Coast Guard hearing, Georgudis
and a helmsman were on the bridge at the time. A harbor pilot was
preparing to board the ship to guide it through Narragansett Bay.
   ``He was simply trying to handle more than one person could
handle at one time,'' said Peter DiBiase, Georgudis' attorney.
   Georgudis could have faced one year in prison, and he and Ballard
each could have faced fines of twice the damages, Almond said.
   The captain remained free on $50,000 bail but restricted to Rhode
Island, Massachusetts and New York City, where the ship was repaired
before it left for Greece late last month.
   Georgudis previously told Gov. Edward D. DiPrete and Coast Guard
officials that he made a mistake by not steering the ship away from
the reef and warning buoys and by not having a harbor pilot on board.
   The captain also faces state charges of causing pollution and
failing to have a harbor pilot on board. If convicted of the state
charges, Georgudis could be sentenced to more than one year in
prison and fined $20,000. State Attorney General James O'Neil has
said he would not seek prison time.
   Claude Cote, acting legal counsel for the state Department of
Environmental Management, said the state was negotiating a
settlement for cleanup costs with Ballard. He said the federal plea
agreement would not block state legal action.
   Almond said he decided the state should get the fines because it
suffered more damage than the federal government.
   Ballard will pay $250,000 to an environmental trust fund, some of
which Cote said would be used to develop better oil containment
booms for ocean work. The remaining $250,000 would be used to help
the state acquire coastal property.
   The Coast Guard has estimated cleanup costs at nearly $2 million.

<HEAD>Jumbo Breaks `Tyranny of Distance,' Flies London-Sydney Nonstop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Qantas jumbo jet made aviation history
today by becoming the first commercial airliner to fly nonstop from
London to Sydney.
   Ending what the pilot called ``the tyranny of distance,'' the new
$150 million Qantas Airways Boeing 747-400 made the 11,156-mile
journey in 20 hours, nine minutes, also setting a speed record.
   Hundreds of people witnessed the arrival of the ``City of
Canberra'' at Sydney's Kingsford-Smith Airport, named for Sir
Charles Kingsford-Smith, the Australian aviator who pioneered the
route in 1929.
   The previous long-distance record was held by South African
Airways, which flew a specially designed Boeing jet 10,281 miles
from Seattle to Cape Town.
   Flights between Australia and London currently make one stop, and
complete the journey in about 22 hours.
   By contrast, a similar journey in the 1930's from London to
Brisbane took 12 to 14 days, with stops in Paris; Brindisi, Italy;
Athens; Cairo; Karachi, Pakistan; Singapore and Brisbane.
   The ``City of Canberra'' made the journey with 23 people on
board, as well as strict limitations on luggage. It carried 56,420
gallons of high-density aviation fuel.
   Qantas said the flight could not have been attempted with a full
load of passengers, so the 367-seat jet carried just seven crew,
including four pilots, and 16 others, including airline executives
and aviation writers.
   Its normal range is 7,875 miles with a full passenger and cargo
payload.
   On the tarmac, hundreds cheered senior pilot Capt. David
Massey-Green, who declared, ``The tryanny of distance has been
beaten down.''
   Non-essential galley equipment, including newspapers, were
removed from the plane. It reportedly arrived with only one hour's
worth of fuel in reserve after flying at an average speed of 570 mph
at an altitude of 45,000 feet.
   More than half the super jet's weight at takeoff was in fuel.

   A group of prisoners sent flowers to the
wake of Rep. Larkin Smith as a tribute to the former sheriff who
always treated them with respect, one inmate said.
   Twenty prisoners at Harrison County Jail sent a flag-shaped
arrangement of red and white carnations to Wednesday's memorial at a
convention center in Biloxi. Smith and pilot Chuck Vierling, 58,
were killed in a small plane crash Sunday night.
   ``He was a man who helped us realize we weren't just dogs and
trash to throw away,'' said trusty inmate Dennis Alexander, night
shift head cook at the jail.
   Alexander said he and other trusty inmates owe their vocational
skills to programs begun by Smith when he was Harrison County
sheriff.
   ``I liked the man. You talk to some of the trusties and they'll
say, `I don't like you because you're the police,''' said Alexander,
a former truck driver serving a 20-year sentence for sexual battery.
   ``But he never looked at you and said, `I don't like you because
you're an inmate.' He treated people with respect,'' he said.
   Alexander, speaking from the telephone at the jail Wednesday
night, fought back tears remembering the man he had met only once _
after he landed in jail last year.
   Lt. Bruce Carver, a jail supervisor, said Smith began the
vocational programs in 1985 as a way to help prisoners to one day
become ``taxpayers rather than tax-eaters.''
   ``That's the kind of man he was,'' Carver said. ``He left this
kind of impact even on the inmates.''
   Carver was among nearly 2,000 people who had streamed past
Smith's closed casket by Wednesday night. The memorial was to
continued this morning, followed by a funeral Mass and burial in
nearby Gulfport.

<HEAD>Winds Take Zing Out of Depression; Storms Soak Northern Plains, Arizona</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Upper level winds shredded an Atlantic tropical depression but a
tropical storm watch remains in effect today for the Leeward
Islands, forecasters said.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, the center of the depression was near
latitude 17.2 degrees north and longitude 54.7 west, about 500 miles
east of the northern Leeward Isles, according to the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   A tropical storm watch continued from Dominica Island in the West
Indies north to the British Virgin Islands as the depression moved
west at about 20 mph with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph.
Forecasters said if the storm threatens the United States, it won't
be until late in the weekend or next week.
   Atmospheric conditions do not favor strengthening of the
depression, a forecaster said. The depression would become a named
storm if its maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph.
   Elsewhere, strong thunderstorms socked the northern Plains with
high winds, large hail and heavy rains, while torrential rains
soaked Arizona.
   Hail one inch in diameter fell Wednesday at Mitchell, Neb.
Thunderstorm winds gusted to 47 mph at Dalhart, Texas.
   More than an inch of rain fell in an hour at Gila Bend, Ariz.,
and strong winds elsewhere in the state caused dust storms.
   Humid air flowing out of the Gulf of Mexico also triggered
thunderstorms across Florida and the middle and southern Atlantic
Coast states.
   Late Wednesday afternoon, strong thunderstorms blew down trees at
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The trees broke a water main and snapped
utility wires.
   Temperatures early this morning were in the 40s and 50s over the
northern Rockies, the Great Lakes and northern New ENgland. Readings
in the 50s were also along the Pacific Coast.
   The high temperature in the nation Wednesday was 112 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from the southern half of the Atlantic Coast to across the Tennessee
Valley and the Gulf Coast region to the eastern half of the southern
Plains; showers and thunderstorms also may extend from the northern
Plateau to the northern high Plains Region, and from the southern
and central Rockies to the southern Plateau region.
   Predicted highs: into the 90s from the Florida peninsula to
coastal South Carolina, from Louisiana to New Mexico, and across
much of the Great Basin and the Southwest; above 100 degrees over
the desert Southwest; in the 70s from New England to the northern
Ohio Valley and eastern upper Mississippi Valley, from western
Montana to the northern Pacific Coast, and along the California
coast. Much of the remainder of the nation was to have temperatures
in the 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 39

   Several top U.S. lawmakers saw a powerful Soviet
laser fired in a rare display of Soviet high technology, Tass
reported today.
   A group from the House Armed Services Committee, led by Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., toured a branch of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic
Energy in Troitsk near Moscow on Wednesday.
   ``They were shown the Tokamak experimental thermonuclear
installation and the Angara-5 experimental thermonuclear inertia
installation. The guests were shown a powerful laser in the process
of operation,'' the official news agency said.
   Tass did not describe the installations further, and the
congressmen, who have been touring Soviet military and space
facilities since Aug. 7, were in meetings and unavailable for
comment. They were scheduled to give a news conference Friday before
leaving the country later in the day.
   The New York Times quoted one delegation member, John H. Hammond,
former head of the directed energy program for the Pentagon's
Strategic Defense Organization, as saying the visit revealed
``important new information about Soviet research on gas lasers.''
The article, in today's editions, said the laser blasted a sheet of
metal.
   Hammond said he believed the laser was of limited military value.
   The Pentagon says the Soviets are developing high-energy lasers
for strategic air defense, space-based anti-satellite missions and
defense against ballistic missiles.
   The United States has a similar program.
   The congressmen have also visited a launch site for an SS-11
intercontinental ballistic missile and the Soviet space center at
Baikonur, where they saw the shuttle Buran.

Approved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old girl was sentenced to 27 years
to life in prison for gunning down a girlfriend who had switched
gang affiliations.
   Wednesday's sentencing followed a night of gang bloodshed that
left four people dead and four injured. Such violence, coupled with
rampant drug dealing, prompted the city on Tuesday to create a $3
million program to deploy large squads of police in gang-infested
areas.
   The girl, whose name was withheld because of her age, was
sentenced in Compton Juvenile Court for the June 2 shooting of
Patricia Tawana Thomas, 14. She was convicted of first-degree murder
on Aug. 3.
   Despite the heavy sentence, as a minor she can be imprisoned only
until she is 25.
   The killer and the slain girl were friends who had belonged to
the 118th Street East Coast Crips gang, but the victim's decision to
change gangs led to a dispute, said Dennis Fuhrman, a prosecutor
assigned to the district attorney's Hardcore Gang Unit.
   ``She armed herself, went to the victim's house and while waiting
for her to come outside she told some people standing outside that
she was `gonna smoke''' the girl, Furhman said.
   After the point-blank shooting, the 13-year-old bragged to fellow
gang members that she had just killed a ``Swan,'' referring to a
member of the rival Bloods gang, Fuhrman said.
   The victim, killed by a single shot to the chest, was wearing
red, the color associated with the Bloods. Crips wear blue.
   The girls also were feuding over a common boyfriend, Fuhrman said.
   Tried and convicted as a juvenile, the girl will be turned over
to the California Youth Authority, which operates prisons for minors.
   Meanwhile, overnight street violence included three drive-by
shootings.
   Two shootings left two teen-agers dead and two other people
wounded in the city's south-central area, police said.
   The third drive-by killed a 17-year-old boy in Compton, a
southside suburb, said Compton police Lt. Joe Flores.
   A fourth shooting was reported in suburban Inglewood. One person
was slain and two others were wounded in an ambush, said Inglewood
police spokesman Gary Luckett.
   Los Angeles residents fed up with gangs attended a City Council
session Tuesday and successfully pushed for approval of foot patrols
to combat brazen drug peddling and harassment of neighbors and
merchants.
   Patrols of 10 to 20 officers in the most dangerous neighborhoods
could begin in three weeks, said Deputy Police Chief Robert Vernon.

<HEAD>Tests of 30 Most Common Generic Drugs Ordered</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 graf at end with list of drugs.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is conducting
new tests of the 30 most prescribed generic drugs, responding to
revelations that some drugs were not properly tested before getting
federal approval.
   ``If any safety problem arises in either a generic or brand-name
product, an announcement and recall will be promptly made,'' the FDA
said Wednesday.
   The tests come as the result of recent reports that some
companies substituted the original patented drug for the generic
drug in tests to win FDA approval. Such a substitution tests the
original drug against itself, almost guaranteeing equivalent
biological activity.
   The agency said it expects to analyze more than 1,000 samples
from hundreds of companies to check potency, rate of dissolution in
the body and chemical composition.
   Samples will be collected from all manufacturers and
private-label distributors of the 30 drugs, the agency said. About
half are already in hand, and the tests may take several weeks.
   The 30 generic drugs being tested cover about three-fourths of
new prescriptions for generics, the agency said.
   The announcement followed disclosure that the agency's
governmental parent, the Department of Health and Human Services,
has streamlined procedures to deal with serious violations of the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
   The health agency's inspector general has been given authority to
investigate violations, something the FDA previously handled itself.
   The FDA has been under pressure from Capitol Hill, especially the
House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee chaired by
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., to clean up the generic drug division.
   Dingell's investigators were the first to uncover the problems at
the FDA division. They turned their information over to the U.S.
attorney's office in Baltimore.
   Prescription drugs must undergo tests that lead to human trials
to prove they are safe and effective before they can be sold.
   New drugs are patented, but when patents expire any company is
free to make the drug. Several companies frequently compete to sell
the same product, which reduces prices.
   The drugs being tested by the FDA are generic versions of the
following drugs:
   Acetaminophen with codeine, allopurinol, amitriptyline,
amoxicillin and amoxicillin trihydrate, ampicillin, cephalexin,
doxycycline hyclate, diazepam, dipyridamole, erythromycin,
erythromycin stearate, ferrous sulfate, furosemide,
hydrochlorothiazide, hydrocortisone, ibuprofen.
   Imipramine, lorazepam, meclizine, metronidazole, nitroglycerin,
nystatin, phenobarbital, prednisone, propoxphene napsylate with
acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim, tetracycline,
thyroid, triamcinolone and triamcinolone acetonide.

<HEAD>Army Turns Back Palestinians Without ID Cards; Soldiers Kill Escapee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soldiers today began
turning back Palestinians headed to work in Israel for failing to
have the government's new, computerized identification cards.
   In the occupied West Bank, troops shot and killed a Palestinian
escapee armed with an Uzi submachine gun after he defied an order to
stop, the army said.
   The shooting occurred Wednesday night near Idna, a village 20
miles southwest of Jerusalem, the army said in a statement. The army
identified the man as Shahadi Darwish, 25, of Beit Jala, and said he
escaped from jail in May.
   ``He was in detention on suspicion of committing several
terrorist acts, among these the murder of a local policeman in Beit
Jala in August 1987,'' the statement said.
   The death raised to 537 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli troops and Jewish settlers since the Palestinian uprising
began in December 1987. Ninety-five suspected collaborators have
been killed by fellow Arabs, and 38 Israelis also have died in the
violence.
   Palestinian activists have called for a strike starting Friday to
protest the identification cards, which Israeli officials say are
needed to improve security.
   The system was announced several months ago after a series of
slayings and other attacks against Israeli civilians by Palestinians.
   The issue has become primarily a test of strength between the
army-run civil administration in the Gaza Strip and clandestine
uprising leaders, who are trying to sever ties between Palestinians
and Israel as part of their revolt against 22 years of occupation.
   Brig. Gen. Arye Ramot, head of the military government in Gaza,
told Israel radio today that 5,000 Gaza workers were allowed to
enter Israel through the Erez Checkpoint between 3:30 a.m. and 7 a.m.
   But Ramot said about 1,000 laborers in 300 cars were turned back
when spot checks showed they lacked the new identification cards.
   He said Israel initially estimated that 50,000 cards would be
issued, but now believes demand could exceed 70,000.
   Ramot said the cards would increase Israel's control over the
people of Gaza, since their backgrounds could now be checked against
computer records. But he conceded someone who never committed a
crime before could get the card, then carry out an attack in Israel.
   Israeli officials said uprising leaders have confiscated as many
as 1,000 cards and intimidated workers who have tried to acquire
them.
   Outside the complex of tents and stucco buildings where the cards
are issued, a 48-year-old Palestinian father of eight complained he
had to pay all his back taxes to get the new card and now expected
it to be taken away.
   ``We get it and the popular committees come and take it, so it's
useless,'' said the man, who gave his name only as Yusef.
   According to government figures, 110,000 Palestinians from the
occupied territories work in Israel _ 50,000 from the Gaza Strip and
60,000 from the West Bank.
   Many hold low-paying jobs in construction, textiles, restaurants
and city sanitation services. Together their wages amount to about
$700 million a year.
   Such work is the largest single source of income for Palestinians
in the occupied lands and constitutes a significant portion of the
$1.3 billion gross domestic product of the territories.
   The army earlier announced that effective Friday, no Gazan
without a new identification card would be allowed to enter Israel.
   Wall slogans in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday ordered workers to
boycott their jobs in Israel for two weeks starting Friday.
   Underground leaders of the uprising said in a leaflet that
workers in the West Bank should strike for a week in solidarity with
the Gazans. The leaflet also said Palestinians who did not strike
would be considered ``betrayers.''
   Israel radio said that many Palestinian workers defied strikes on
Tuesday and Wednesday and that some may stay in Israel to circumvent
new strike calls and keep their jobs.
   Many Israeli employers have begun trying to replace Arab workers
with Israelis, for security reasons and to ease Israel's rising
unemployment.
   The Central Bureau of Statistics said today that estimates for
April through June put unemployment at 9.5 percent.

<HEAD>Student Leader Clarifies Remark About Crackdown Toll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese student leader, clarifying a statement he
made the day before at a U.N. Human Rights Panel, said today he has
reliable information that up to 120,000 people were arrested since
the military crackdown in China last June.
   ``Some'' of those arrested, Li Lu said, have been secretly
executed.
   Li, 23, who is on the Beijing government's list of most wanted
criminals for his role in the demonstrations on Tiananmen Square,
told reporters he has maintained close contacts with sources in
China since he fled his homeland in late June.
   ``Most of the Chinese people continue to support the students,''
Li said. ``They give me every kind of information. For security
reasons, I cannot name the sources but the information is reliable.''
   Li on Wednesday became the first student leader to address a U.N.
body, the U.N. Subcommission for the Prevention of Discrimination,
on the June events. His appeal to the international community to
condemn China's rights policies prompted the official Chinese
observer to walk out in protest.
   In his speech, Li said that since the crackdown, ``many more are
arrested and executed. These may number as many as 120,000.''
   Asked about this at today's news conference, he said he meant
that ``some'' of these may have been executed but did not give an
estimate. Many arrests, he said, were never publicly announced.
   Li, who studied physics and economics, said he was for a short
time a member of the Chinese Communist Party until 1986, when he
still thought that reforms could change the system.
   ``Now, most people realize an inside reform cannot bring hope for
China's future,'' he said, speaking in halting English. In response
to questions, he said he favored ``limited sanctions'' by the
international community against China but cautioned that this was a
``complicated'' issue.
   Since his escape, he said, he has been living in France, West
Germany and the United States. Asked whether he felt threatened
being on China's most wanted list, he said, he ``did not care''
about dangers and that ``many people'' were protecting him.
   The official Chinese observer, Zhang Yishan, told the U.N. panel
Wednesday night that Li was ``one of the major organizers of the
counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   Zhang said he walked out during Li's speech to ``express
indignation and regret'' at the fact that a ``criminal'' wanted by a
U.N. member state was able to attack that nation at a U.N. forum .
   Li, who said he was the deputy head of the student Hunger Strike
Committee, said Wednesday that thousands may have been killed during
the June 3-4 military repression. China has said at least 200 people
have died.
   ``The exact numbers will never be known since bodies were carted
off, probably to mass graves. Others were cremated right where they
lay,'' he said. ``But the terror did not end with the killings.''
   Amnesty International, in a statement released after Li's speech,
said the ``atmosphere of terror'' following the June crackdown made
it impossible to say how many were killed.
   Amnesty has called the government figure a ``gross
underestimate.''

   They came from as far away as Australia and
the Netherlands to remember Elvis Presley and they weren't
disappointed, even if they did find the decor of his famous house a
bit flashy.
   ``It's fantastic,'' Susan Goonan of Melbourne said Wednesday as
she toured Graceland, the singer's former residence.
   But Mrs. Goonan, who came to mark the 12th anniversary of
Presley's death with 25 other fans from Australia and New Zealand,
said she didn't share his tastes in home decoration.
   ``It's not what I would choose but if he was happy with it, it's
fine by me,'' she said. ``It's a little too primary, perhaps. The
black and yellow is a bit much and the mirrors on the ceiling.''
   Presley died of heart disease at Graceland on Aug. 16, 1977. The
two-story, white-columned residence draws 650,000 tourists a year,
including some 40,000 over Elvis International Tribute Week, a
nine-day lineup of memorials and fan get-togethers promoted each
August by Graceland's managers.
   A capacity crowd of some 4,200 visitors toured the residence
Wednesday. They included John van Eggelen and Michel Scholte of the
Netherlands, who took snapshots of each other on a small walkway
lined by tall stands of flowers sent by fans.
   Van Eggelen, 46, said he had been to Graceland several times, but
Scholte, 21, was on his first visit.
   ``It's very beautiful,'' he said. ``From pictures, it was very
little, but I see it's all big and beautiful colors.''
   As many as 4,000 fans filed past Presley's grave late Tuesday and
early Wednesday in a candlelight vigil.
   Meanwhile, a Graceland-area motel popular with Elvis fans
sponsored a window decorating contest.
   Lynn Watson and Jerry Mills of Tucson, Ariz., said they decorated
their window overlooking the courtyard to depict Presley's
interpretation of heaven.
   ``What would Elvis think heaven was? It would be Graceland with
his mama there,'' the 42-year-old Ms. Watson said.
   The window had a 6-inch doll in a bespangled jumpsuit climbing a
set of red, poster-board stairs to a replica of Graceland floating
on a cotton-ball cloud. A Christmas tree angel dangled overhead and
a third doll representing Presley's mother, Gladys, stood at
Graceland's door.
   ``I've been thinking about this for three years, but I just
couldn't put it all together until now,'' said Ms. Mills, 66.
   She said she got the best compliment possible when another Elvis
fan stopped to look at the window and was moved to tears.

<HEAD>Turkey Denies Entry to Bulgarian Train Carrying Ethnic Turks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today said it was barring
indefinitely the entry of a Bulgarian train that for three months
has carried an average of 600 ethnic Turks daily to this country.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Murat Sungar, told The Associated
Press that the decision was made to protest the ``disorderly and
inhuman'' transfer of the ethnic Turks by the Bulgarian government.
   Sungar said the train was overcrowded and the immigrants'
belongings were sent three days later.
   He added that Turkey could review its decision if the Bulgarian
government agrees to make the transfers in a more orderly and humane
way.
   ``The decision does not mean that Turkey closes its border with
Bulgaria,'' Sungar said.
   The exodus continued today with more immigrants crossing the
border by private cars. The number of immigrants who have arrived in
Turkey so far has reached 291,500.
   In May, Bulgaria began deporting ethnic Turks after subjecting
them to a forced assimilation campaign that included changing their
Turkish names to Slavic ones and banning Islamic rites and use of
the Turkish language.
   The deportation grew into an exodus as the ethnic Turks were
permitted to acquire passports and leave the country.
   Bulgaria refuses Turkey's call for talks on an immigration
agreement that would protect the ethnic Turks' legal rights,
including social security benefits and compensation for property
left behind, and restoration of minority rights to those who remain
in Bulgaria.

   The Iowa Supreme Court has freed local
governments to impose curfews on minors to fight drug abuse and
crime.
   The court, in a 5-4 ruling Wednesday, said a curfew is only a
minor infringement on the rights of children and parents. It upheld
a curfew set in Panora that barred people under 18 from being out
from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.
   David Simmons, then 15, had challenged the Panora curfew after he
was caught skateboarding at 10:35 p.m. He argued that curfews
unconstitutionally interfere with family rights and violate his
right to move about as he pleased.
   Dissenters in the ruling said the court was allowing fundamental
rights to be trampled because of panic over crime and drugs.

   Affirmative action programs, weakened by recent
court rulings, can be saved only by lobbying and intensive
fund-raising, an NAACP lawyer told civil rights leaders.
   The NAACP Legal Defense Fund has received seven requests for help
in defending minority set-aside programs, Julius Chambers told the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference at its annual meeting
Wednesday.
   He said it would take about $1 million to lobby for minority
set-aside programs and more to take the cases to court.
   The Supreme Court ``set out with an agenda to rewrite civil
rights, and they've done a pretty successful job,'' Chambers said.
   During its recent term, the court made it easier to challenge
affirmative action programs already in place and made it harder to
initiate and win discrimination suits.
   SCLC President Joseph Lowery said civil rights leaders will
continue trying to persuade the Bush administration to seek
legislation to preserve affirmative action.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said earlier this year that
the administration did not intend to pursue the matter.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, a Democrat, said the Bush
administration has lagged on education and training programs and
affirmative action.
   If the government can find enough money to bail out the savings
and loan industry, ``why can't we find a few billion dollars'' for
Head Start programs and set-aside programs that award public
contracts to minorities, he asked.
   SCLC members agreed to use the vote to pressure lawmakers for
action and said they would work to raise money to help the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund handle requests for help.
   The SCLC convention runs through Friday.

   Here are some of the interchanges between air
traffic controllers at Farmington, Minn. and the crew of United
Airlines Flight 232 after the explosion of the tail engine on July
19.
   UAL: ``We just lost No. 2 engine. Like to lower our altitude
please.''
   A little later:
   UAL: ``We just lost No. 2 and some hydraulics. The airplane is
marginally controllable here.''
   Controllers issued instructions to other flights and to United
232:
   FARM: ``United 232 descend and maintain flight level 290 and what
will be your intention sir?'' Flight level 290 means 29,000 feet.
   The answer:
   UAL: ``Stand by. Stand by.''
   Seconds later:
   UAL: ``United 232. We're declaring an emergency here (controllers
interject here: ``Declaring an emergency'') and request landing at
the nearest available airport.''
   FARM: ``232, you are cleared to Des Moines.''
   UAL: ``Sir we need the works, 232, we are just, uh, having
trouble controlling the airplane right now.''
   The flight crew is patched through to the company's maintenance
base at San Francisco, where experts can offer nothing that helps.
   Watching the gyrations of the DC-10, a controller notes that
Sioux City is now the closest airport.
   FARM: ``United 232, your present heading looks a little better
for Sioux City. Would you like to go to Sioux City?''
   UAL: ``Affirmative.''
   The pilots are steering by applying different amounts of power to
the two remaining engines, one on each wing.
   UAL: ``We have zero rudder control, uh, no aileron control.''
   The controllers are preparing to turn over the flight to the
control tower at the Sioux City airport:
   FARM (to Sioux City): ``He's having a hard time controlling the
plane right now, trying to slow down and get set on a steady bearing
right now. As soon as he gets comfortable, I will shift him over to
you and he will be yours.''
   Just before touchdown, a wing dipped and caught the ground,
sending the plane spinning into a cornfield and killing 111 of the
296 aboard.
   The tape was first broadcast by ABC News Wednesday night.

   City Councilman Hosea Williams, a longtime civil
rights activist, has entered the mayoral race against Maynard
Jackson, offering the most serious challenge to the former mayor's
comeback attempt.
   The 63-year-old former aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King joined
six political unknowns Wednesday, including a comedian and a college
student, in filing to run against Jackson in the non-partisan race
Oct. 3.
   Last week, the withdrawal of Jackson's sole announced opponent,
Fulton County Commissioner Michael Lomax, had cleared the way for
him to return to City Hall for a third term. Lomax had concluded he
couldn't win.
   ``After they scared all other qualified candidates out of the
running, it just didn't leave me no choice if I was to adhere to the
principles I lived by over the past 35 years,'' Williams said in
entering the race.
   Williams, who like Jackson is a black Democrat, said the former
mayor is the candidate of ``a small black clique, an elite clique
and the rich power structure.''
   The 51-year-old Jackson, who served two four-year terms beginning
in 1974, said he is ``elated'' to have opposition.
   Williams, who resigned his City Council seat to make the mayoral
race, said he had no money, no campaign manager and no headquarters
but expects his longtime supporters to rally around his campaign.
   ``I'm not just running a symbolic campaign,'' Williams said.
``I'm running to win. I have something Michael Lomax didn't have _
that's the people. One good volunteer is worth 15 people you hire.''
   He entered the race on the last day of a three-day qualifying
period. Three other candidates avoided the $3,000 filing fee by
qualifying as paupers.

   The suspect in the nation's worst unsolved
serial murder case is really the scapegoat of a reckless
investigation, his brother says.
   Robert J. Stevens said Wednesday he has proof that his brother,
William Jay Stevens II, was on a family vacation on the East Coast
when the first victims of the Green River serial killer disappeared.
   William Stevens, 38, has been identified as a suspect by the
Green River Task Force but has not been charged in any of the 48
deaths or disappearances of women between 1982 and 1985 near Seattle
and Portland, Ore. The first five victims were found along the Green
River south of Seattle.
   Stevens is completing a jail sentence in Seattle for a 1979
burglary and his 1981 escape from a work release center.
   ``I believe in my brother's innocence,'' Robert Stevens said at a
news conference. He said the task force is no longer looking at his
brother for the first five killings.
   Stevens gave reporters a list of credit card charges made in the
northeastern United States in June and July 1982. He also showed
four photographs he said are from a monthlong vacation taken by his
brother and his parents, which included a visit to Robert Stevens
and his family in Connecticut in July 1982.
   Stevens said he has given the information and photographs to task
force investigators, who interviewed him at his father's home
Tuesday.
   He said he found the photographs a week ago in his father's
Spokane home, which the task force searched last month.
Investigators did not seize the photographs because they only
searched his brother's room and personal belongings, he said.
   ``The task force has been reckless in their investigation and
have done nothing but harass my brother, family and friends,''
Stevens said. He complained that investigators waited more than
seven months after William Stevens' arrest in January to contact him
for information about his brother's whereabouts during 1981-85.
   Before the press conference, task force commander Bob Evans said
detectives visited the Stevens home on Tuesday but that the
information on William Stevens' vacations was not new. He said the
investigation was continuing.
   Craig Beles, William Stevens' attorney in Seattle, said his
client had no comment.
   Police last month searched two Spokane residences where William
Stevens lived while attending Gonzaga University Law School.
Investigators carted away around 50 boxes of materials, including a
collection of police badges, videotapes and other paraphernalia.
   Robert Stevens said he only recently obtained a copy of the
affidavit used to obtain the search warrant, and spent two weeks
compiling the information that he said clears his brother.
   He also said he is searching for more information that will prove
his brother was not in the areas where other Green River victims
disappeared.
   Stevens, 37, a senior chief petty officer at the Navy submarine
base at Bangor, Wash., is on humanitarian leave to care for his
father, who is recovering from surgery on a brain tumor earlier this
summer. Stevens' mother died in June.
   ``Looking back, I believe he is more a scapegoat than he is a
suspect,'' he said of his brother. The task force may have focused
on him to ``justify the money it spent and to try and continue its
operation,'' he said.
   The Stevens family ``hopes to have this all cleared up by the
time my brother is released from Seattle,'' Robert Stevens said. He
also said the family make take legal action against the police and
the press, but did not elaborate.
   William Stevens is scheduled to get out of jail Sept. 26.

<TEXT>
   Mike Sevel wasn't overly concerned that
night 20 years ago as he helped his father maneuver their 65-foot
shrimp boat up the Biloxi River to shelter from an approaching storm.
   But for the Sevels and hundreds of other fishermen along the
Mississippi Gulf Coast on Aug. 17, 1969, the destructive power of
Hurricane Camille would soon become painfully clear.
   Camille's 200 mph winds pushed a wall of water over Mississippi's
coastline, tossing ocean-going ships onto the beach, ripping away
all but the pilings in harbors and damaging or destroying thousands
of coastal homes and businesses.
   The most powerful storm in U.S. history, Camille danced along the
coast for days before roaring ashore in Mississippi. Two hundred
forty-eight people died, including 141 in Mississippi.
   Sevel said his father decided to move their boat to the safety of
the river as soon as the outward winds of the hurricane reached
Gulfport's commercial small craft harbor.
   ``After we moved up the river we tied our boat up to a paperwood
barge,'' said Sevel, 16 at the time. ``Nearby there was a cluster of
pilings and three or four boats tied up between them.''
   Sevel said the water rose higher throughout the night and the
winds whipped up to a howl.
   ``And while you couldn't see them you knew there were tornadoes
moving around us because you could hear the sudden roar,'' he said.
``We had tied to the pilings with several lines and after Camille
came through there was only one line left, the rest had snapped.
   ``We fought all night long and there were times I wasn't sure we
could make it.''
   He said some of the other boats in the pack either sank under the
weight of the rushing water or were pounded into the river banks.
   Frank Wells, 65, said he left Gulfport ahead of the storm and
took his 35-foot shrimp boat up a bayou near his Empire, La., home.
   ``We took shelter behind a ferry on the bayou and we made it fine
but while we were saving the boat, we lost our home,'' he said. ``We
had 18 feet of water come through Empire.''
   Camille destroyed 6,744 homes and damaged 46,709 more, while
destroying or damaging 746 businesses.
   Shrimper Luther Rowell, 53, said his most vivid memory of Camille
was returning to the harbor at Gulfport after weeks of waiting
aboard his boat on the river while crews worked to restore power to
drawbridges.
   ``I remember that when he got back there was no wharf, only
pilings,'' Rowell said. ``We had to take scraps of wood to make a
walk. There was destruction everywhere you turned.''
   Commercial fisherman James L. Ladner of Gulfport spent that night
at his brother's supermarket a few blocks inland but returned the
next morning to the beach area.
   ``I can still remember seeing those three ships that got caught
up on the beach. Two of them had to be scrapped,'' he said. ``All
along the beach there was total destruction and there was nothing
left of U.S. 90,'' then the major traffic route along the
Mississippi coast.
   ``And I remember there were plenty of shrimp out there,'' he said
pointing to the Mississippi Sound. ``But so much stuff had washed
into the water that when you pulled in your nets they were filled
with things like refrigerators, bathtubs and even car batteries.''

   Troops loyal to China's president detained the
nation's defense minister and several military commanders after a
dispute over who would fill a top military post, Chinese sources
said today.
   The sources said President Yang Shangkun, a mastermind of the
martial law crackdown in Beijing, apparently ordered the move to
strengthen his control of the Chinese military. The post had been
held by Communist Party boss Zhao Ziyang, who was purged for
allegedly supporting the pro-democracy movement.
   Control of the military is an essential ingredient in Chinese
politics. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping's only official post is
chairman of the Central Military Commission, China's top military
body.
   Troops went to the Beijing residence of Defense Minister Qin
Jiwei Wednesday evening and took him and one of his guards away, the
Chinese sources said. Troops later took away the heads of the
Beijing, Guangzhou and Nanjing military districts, who supported Qin
and were in Beijing for an important meeting, the sources said.
   One source said the troops were from the Garrison Headquarters of
Beijing, a special force that protects top military and political
leaders and is directed by Yang. The sources said they believed that
Qin and the others went unwillingly, and the sources said they did
not know where the officials were. It was not immediately possible
to confirm the report.
   However, the sources contacted The Associated Press separately.
   One source is a military officer who called the AP early this
morning from Beijing. The other is a Hong Kong-based businessman,
who said he has extensive contacts within the Chinese military.
   In other developments, a Chinese government spokesman confirmed
in an interview published today that Wang Dan, a leader of the
spring pro-democracy movement and one of the country's most wanted
fugitives, has been arrested.
   State Council spokesman Yuan Mu said Wang was arrested July 2
after meeting with a Taiwanese reporter, who was detained and later
expelled from China.
   Yuan was interviewed by the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun,
and his comments were reported by China's official Xinhua news
agency.
   Wang, a 20-year-old history student at Beijing University, went
underground after authorities issued an arrest warrant for him and
20 other students involved in the democracy protests. Eight fugitive
students have been arrested and two are known to have fled the
country.
   Also today, a Shanghai newspaper said authorities arrested or
were investigating 99 people accused of involvement in illegal
workers' groups that plotted to establish a ``people's party'' and
kidnap officials. The groups planned to overthrow the government,
the Shanghai Liberation Daily said.
   Regarding the reported military dispute, Qin and Yang are both
jockeying to fill the post of first vice chairman of the Central
Military Commission, which was occupied by Zhao before he was purged
in June.
   Zhao was purged following the student demonstrations for sweeping
political change in China. Those demonstrations ended on June 3 when
thousands of soldiers attacked protesters and crushed the movement.
   Earlier, Chinese sources had said Qin had opposed martial law in
Beijing and the use of force to clear Tiananmen Square. He was
overruled.
   Moves by Yang to take over Zhao's old post appear to indicate
that he hopes to solidify his control of the military upon Deng's
death. Deng, 84, is reported to be in poor health.
   Yang, who is also 84, is reported to be healthy.

<TEXT>
   A federal official dismisses fears that sludge
from the polluted Boston Harbor will be sold as fertilizer in Texas,
but Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is taking the idea seriously.
   Bentsen, D-Texas, says he's made it clear to the Environmental
Protection Agency that Texas should not become ``the repository of
sludge that is too contaminated to remain in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.''
   Bentsen and Texas Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower point
to a draft proposal to market Boston sludge as fertilizer, as well
as an internal EPA memo that said the sludge is ``too filthy to be
used as fertilizer under Massachusetts law. It is too filthy for all
of New England and New York.''
   ``Well then, I believe it's too filthy for Massey, New Deal and
New Ulm, Texas, too,'' Hightower told Bentsen in seeking the
senator's support in his fight against hauling ``Boston's pollution
problem halfway across the country so it can then become a Texas
problem.''
   According to Hightower, the sludge contains a relatively high
percentage of industrial toxic waste that is not pretreated,
``leaving it replete with such potentially dangerous contaminants as
mercury, molybdenum, copper and cadmium.''
   Boston Harbor pollution was an issue in the 1988 presidential
campaign, with George Bush accusing Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis of acting too slowly to deal with the problem. Bentsen was
Dukakis' vice presidential running mate.
   ``The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority has no intention,
no contracts, no plans to use these pellets in Texas, principally
because of the high cost of transportation,'' Paul Keough, acting
administrator of the EPA region that includes Massachusetts, said
Wednesday,
   ``There doesn't seem to be any interest in sending the material
to Texas. So there seems to be much ado about nothing,'' Keough said.
   Paul DiNatale, chief spokesman for the Massachusetts water
authority, which is coordinating the Boston Harbor cleanup, took
strong issue with the memo written by EPA headquarters staffers.
   That memo accused the EPA and the water authority of ignoring
proposed water regulations and proceeding to ``shop around for
states with weak environmental laws where they can market their
contaminated sludge as fertilizer. They have focused in on the
Southeast and on Texas and Florida in particular.''
   Although Bentsen said he understands drafts of reports sometimes
never advance beyond the preliminary stages, ``this is one proposal
that should never reach the status of a mature idea.''

   Tamil guerrillas today entered a
hospital in a northern town and fired rockets and guns at an Indian
army post on the street below, killing at least 24 soldiers,
officials said.
   The guerrillas entered the main hospital at Mannar, 160 miles
north of Colombo, late Wednesday night and launched the attack
shortly after midnight, officials in Colombo and New Delhi said.
   ``They opened fire in utter disregard of the 89 patients inside
the hospital,'' said a Foreign Ministry official in New Delhi.
``Because the Indian peacekeeping troops were conscious that
retaliatory fire would cause casualties in the hospital, they did
not use heavy weapons.''
   The official, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
blamed the attack on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a rebel
group that has been fighting Indian soldiers deployed in Sri Lanka
to contain the Tamil insurgency.
   He said he knew of no casualties among the rebels or civilians
but added that sporadic fighting around the hospital was continuing.
   In other sectarian violence, the government said 20 killings
occurred Wednesday night and today. The victims included at least
eight young Sinhalese men, whose bodies were found near the capital.
   Before the attack on the Indian army post, the Liberation Tigers
accused Indian troops of killing 6,000 Tamil civilians during the
past 22 months. The accusation was included in an appeal addressed
to the United Nations and demanded the troops be withdrawn as early
as possible. A copy of the appeal was released to reporters
Wednesday night.
   A spokesman at the Indian High Commission, or embassy, said he
had not seen the statement and could not comment on it. An Indian
Foreign Ministry spokesman in New Delhi also declined comment.
   The Tigers' statement also accused Indian troops of widespread
atrocities, torture and extra-judicial killings and claimed that
more than 3,000 Tamil civilians are being held by the soldiers.
   ``During the first months of the Indian offensive to secure the
control of Jaffna city, over 2,000 civilians (were) killed and
several thousand (were) wounded,'' the statement said.
   The Indian offensive began in October 1987. The Tigers' claim of
6,000 deaths since then is nearly double the total compiled from Sri
Lankan and Indian estimates that about 2,500 Tamil civilians and
about 1,100 Tamil guerrillas have been killed in the past 22 months
of fighting. In addition, about 1,000 Indian soldiers have died in
the peacekeeping operation.
   India sent troops to Sri Lanka on July 30, 1987, to enforce an
Indian-Sri Lankan peace accord aimed at ending a Tamil insurgency
for an independent nation. The accord offered limited autonomy to
Tamils in exchange for an arms surrender by Tamil militias.
   The Tamil Tigers reneged on the accord and soon started attacking
the Indian soldiers. Other separatist groups abided by the accord
and joined the political mainstream.

<HEAD>Missouri Judge Acquits Abortion Protesters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge in Missouri acquitted 11 anti-abortion protesters of
trespassing, accepting their defense that the action was necessary
to save lives. A California judge rejected a similar argument by
dozens of activists.
   Also Wednesday, a Supreme Court justice in Massachusetts lifted
without explanation an injunction barring anti-abortion protesters
from blocking clinics across the state.
   In Clayton, Mo., Associate Circuit Judge George R. Gerhard ruled
that 11 protesters' violations of trespassing laws were ``necessary
as emergency measures to avoid the ... death and maiming of unborn
children.''
   Lawyers said the acquittals marked the first time a Missouri
judge has accepted a ``necessity defense'' for trespassing by
anti-abortion protesters. The sit-ins occurred in 1986 at an
abortion clinic.
   Gerhard cited the preamble to Missouri's abortion law that life
begins at conception, a provision left intact by the U.S. Supreme
Court in July.
   Ann L. O'Brien, a defendant and anti-abortion leader, hailed the
ruling. Laura Cohen, state coordinator for the National Abortion
Rights Action League, called the decision a ``total
misunderstanding'' of the Supreme Court ruling.
   St. Louis County prosecutor Thomas Wehrle said other judges could
rule differently. Wehrle said his office will continue to enforce
the trespassing ordinance.
   In San Diego, Municipal Judge John M. Thompson ruled that dozens
of anti-abortion activists can't claim they were trying to protest
killing.
   ``Abortion is not killing in California,'' he said. ``Their good
motive is irrelevant as a defense.''
   The city code excludes peaceful picketing and political activity
from its definition of trespassing.
   In Boston, Supreme Judicial Court Justice Joseph Nolan on
Wednesday lifted a July 24 lower-court injunction barring
demonstrators from blocking abortion clinics.
   The injunction had been obtained by plaintiffs in a suit alleging
the protesters violated the rights of clinic employees and clients.
   Anti-abortion activist Bill Cotter praised the ruling but said
its practical effect was minimal. ``We have been blockading all
along, and we will continue to do it with or without injunctions,''
he said.
   Susan Newson, a spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood League of
Massachusetts, called the judge's action ``appalling and lawless.''
A Planned Parenthood lawyer said it will encourage blockading of
clinics.

   A jury awarded $523,000 to a TV station
employee who was fired after finding and showing to co-workers a
torn-up memo her boss had written criticizing her.
   The Hennepin County jury's award Wednesday to Wendy Bradley, a
38-year-old one-time employee of the KSTP promotions department,
included $11,000 for breach of promise and $500,000 in punitive
damages.
   KSTP attorney Charles Mays argued that Bradley was fired in 1986
for breaching a promise of confidentiality. She had showed other
employees a memo written by her boss, Virginia Hubbard.
   The memo to another manager said that Bradley was not an asset to
the department, that she had been involved in two legal disputes,
that a case was being built against her and that she could be
replaced by a secretary.
   Bradley claimed that she found the memo in pieces on a table by a
copying machine. Ms. Hubbard said she believed that Bradley had
taken the pieces from a wastebasket in Ms. Hubbard's office.
   Bradley's attorney, Donald Horton, told the jury she had had no
problems on the job until she cooperated with a state investigation
of sexual harassment allegations.
   Still pending in the case are claims by Bradley that she was
discriminated against on the basis of sex and marital status and had
been retaliated against for taking part in the harassment
investigation and another on job posting.

   Crash investigators left Ethiopia
today after inspecting the wreckage of the twin-engine plane that
carried U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland and 15 other people to their deaths.
   The American and Canadian specialists spent Wednesday nd part of
today on the steep slopes of Tam mountain in southwestern Ethiopia
looking through the remains of the Twin Otter that slammed nose
first into a cliff while en route to a refugee camp Aug. 7.
   They announced no findings, but sources close to the
investigation said bad weather and faulty judgment by the pilot were
at least contributing factors in the crash.
   The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the
pilot had been warned by weather forecasters of heavy clouds, rain
and poor visibility all along his planned 300-mile route.
   The plane's takeoff from Addis Ababa's Bole Airport was delayed
for two hours by bad weather and flying conditions were still only
marginal when it finally left the ground.
   Sources said the weather was even worse in the southwest,
although radar scans showed a break in the clouds over Leland's
destination, the Fugnido refugee camp.
   The investigating team was made up of members of the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board, its Canadian counterpart and
representatives of the Boeing and Pratt and Whitney companies.
   Boeing provided the airframe and Pratt and Whitney built the
engines of the craft, which was manufactured in a Canadian plant.
   The investigation is being conducted jointly with the Ethiopian
Civil Aviation Authority.
   Eight other Americans and seven Ethiopians, including the pilot,
accompanied the Texas Democrat on the flight. U.S. military forensic
experts were trying to identify their remains, which were recovered
from the mountain Tuesday.

<HEAD>Pilot Ran Plane Carrying Rep. Smith Off Runway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The pilot of the small plane that crashed
and killed Rep. Larkin Smith appeared nervous before the flight, ran
the aircraft off the runway before takeoff and flew in the wrong
direction, an investigator says.
   A second investigator with the National Transportation Safety
Board said weather may have been a factor in the crash Sunday night.
   The single-engine plane carrying Smith, 45, and pilot Chuck
Vierling, 58, traveled east of its planned flight path, slamming
into a 70-foot pine tree in a forest. The Mississippi Republican was
returning from Hattiesburg to Gulfport, 70 miles south. Both men
died in the crash.
   Witnesses reported that before takeoff, Vierling ``appeared kind
of nervous ... like he was concerned about the flight, Jorge
Prellezo, regional director for the National Transportation Safety
Board, said in an interview Wednesday in Miami.
   William Dowden, an employee of Southeast Aviation, said he
observed Vierling's plane during and after takeoff from the
Hattiesburg Airport.
   ``He taxied straight out off the ramp area onto the grass and
when he realized what had happened, he made a 180-degree turn, then
taxied slowly out to the runway,'' said Dowden. ``The taxiways are
lit up with blue lights and what happened struck us as being highly
unusual.''
   Prellezo said there were other questions about the flight,
including why the pilot had indicated to controllers he would follow
the established route along a highway but instead flew about nine
miles east over the forest.
   ``After taking off he headed east and when he contacted (air
traffic control at) Houston they told him, `Well, if you want to go
to Gulfport, you had better take a southerly heading,''' Prellezo
said.
   Vierling was a licensed pilot and a friend of Smith's. He had
been flying since 1963, said his stepson, Glenn Terrell. The plane
belonged to Gulfport's Institute for Marine Mammal Studies,
authorities said.
   Jeff Kennedy, another NTSB investigator, said at a news
conference in Biloxi on Wednesday that although weather reports
cited visibility of nearly six miles, darkness and haze may have
affected the pilot's vision.
   Vierling would have had few ground lights to guide him over the
rural area, Kennedy said. He noted that search helicopters were
grounded by fog about 4:30 a.m.
   ``It's hard to determine what kind of flying conditions he was
in,'' Kennedy said.
   Charles Theologos, a part-time Federal Aviation Administration
instructor, said Vierling was not certified to fly by instruments
alone. But authorities said the weather was good enough for him to
take off Sunday night.
   Investigators were also examining the possibility the plane ran
out of fuel, following reports there was no smell of gasoline at the
crash site, said Prellezo.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people today
marked the first anniversary of the death of President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq by holding an anti-government rally denouncing his successor,
Benazir Bhutto.
   The Zia loyalists either walked or jammed teetering buses to
converge on the capital's huge Faisal Mosque for a prayer sevice.
   ``Death to Benazir Bhutto!'' and ``Benazir is a traitor and an
agent of the Russians and Indians!'' the crowd shouted. It was the
largest rally by oppenents of Ms. Bhutto's 8-month-old government.
   Unofficial estimates put the crowd total at 50,000.
   ``What we had before was a military dictatorship. Now we have a
civilian dictatorship,'' said one bystander.
   Zia, U.S. Ambasador Arnold Raphel and 28 other people died in the
crash of Zia's presidential plane Aug. 17, 1988. Investigators said
it appeared to be sabotage, but they have not said who was
responsible.
   Pakistani officials have blamed hundreds of terrorist attacks in
recent years on Soviet-trained agents of neighboring Afghanistan's
communist government. Zia was a staunch supporter of Afghan
guerrillas fighting to overthrow the communists. The guerrillas also
have long received military equipment sent by the United States at
their bases in Pakistan.
   Hundreds of policemen and federal officers were called into the
tree-lined capital to keep order today.
   The government appealed to activists of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party not to hold counterdemonstrations that might provoke
violence.
   Zia seized power in a 1977 military coup by ousting Ms. Bhutto's
father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The elder Bhutto was hanged two years
later after being convicted of plotting to kill a political opponent.
   After Zia's death, Pakistan held its first free elections in more
than a decade. Ms. Bhutto's party won a simple majority in the
national legislature. Conservatives and Zia's proteges captured the
biggest of Pakistan's four provinces.
   There were no formal speeches given at today's rally.
   Banners bearing Zia's picture fluttered from light poles along
the avenue leading to the mosque.
   Zia's son, Ijaz, led a late afternoon prayer service with family,
friends and right-wing political allies at Zia's sarcophagus.

   Two Roman Catholic priests leading a campaign
against the sale of drug paraphernalia have been given 24-hour
police protection because of threats from people identifying
themselves as drug dealers.
   Bodyguards were assigned Wednesday to the Rev. George Clements
and the Rev. Michael Pfleger, said police Superintendent LeRoy
Martin.
   ``It certainly will make me feel a lot more secure in carrying on
the war, but I intended to carry it on whether I got the protection
or not,'' said Clements, 57, an adoptive father and pastor of Holy
Angels Church.
   Clements said he has received three to five threats a night since
April, when he and Pfleger launched a drive to remove pipes and
scales from inner-city stores.
   Pfleger, 40, said a man identifying himself as a drug dealer
called him last week and said, ``You're hurting my customers and
you're hurting me. When you hurt me, I hurt you.''

<TEXT>
   More than 120 Vietnamese who fled their homeland
by boat headed back by plane today in the biggest voluntary return
of refugees from this British colony.
   Waving handkerchiefs and clutching bags packed with clothes and
radios, the refugees boarded a Boeing 737 at Hong Kong's airport and
took off for Hanoi.
   From there the 46 men, 40 women, 17 boys and 18 girls will be
taken to their hometowns and monitored by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   ``I think this is an extremely hopeful sign,'' said Robert van
Leeuwen, head of the U.N. refugee office in Hong Kong, as the jet
took off.
   Originally, 124 people had volunteered to return, but three were
forced to stay in Hong Kong for medical reasons, van Leeuwen said.
   He said 190 more people were awaiting a chance to return to
Vietnam and that 600 to 700 more refugees had already applied to go
back.
   ``Voluntary repatriation is the best shot,'' van Leeuwen said.
   The remark was significant because Vietnam and Britain are
negotiating a plan to force many of the 51,000 Vietnamese refugess
living in Hong Kong back to Vietnam.
   The communist government in Hanoi said it will not prosecute
those returning to the country, one of the poorest in Asia. U.N.
officials today reiterated that they will closely monitor the fate
of the returning refugees.
   Until last year, Hong Kong allowed all Vietnamese refugees to
settle in Hong Kong if they could not go to another country.
   But to stem the flood to the crowded colony of 5 million, the
government in June ruled out resettlement for new refugees unless
they could prove they were escaping political persecution.
   Since then, about 38,300 Vietnanmese have sailed to Hong Kong and
are being housed in a series of camps, detention centers and halfway
houses. About 4,700 live in tents on a nearby island and another
1,800 cram five ferries.
   Van Leeuwen said adult returnees had been given $150 each and
children 14 years or under were given $75 each when they returned.
   Several boat people interviewed this week said they were going
home because they missed their families.
   ``I miss my old mother very much,'' said Le Thi Minh, from
Haiphong. She said her brother was unable to care for their mother
because he is in jail for attempting to flee Vietnve to take risks,'' she
said about returning home,
``but the pull of my family is too strong.''
   Van Leeuwen said U.N. officials will help resettle the returning
refugees, providing assistance on a case-by-case basis.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Overturns Award Against Magazine in Murder-For-Hire
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today overturned a
jury's $9.4 million award to relatives of a woman murdered by a
mercenary hired through an ad in Soldier of Fortune magazine.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that holding the
magazine responsible for the slaying of Sandra Black in 1985 would
impose too great a burden on publishers to screen ambiguously worded
advertisements.
   Although the magazine said the judgment against it had violated
its First Amendment right to freedom of the press, the court did not
address First Amendment arguments, basing its ruling instead on
Texas liability law.
   Soldier of Fortune ``owed no duty to refrain from publishing a
facially innocuous classified advertisement when the ad's context _
at most _ made its message ambiguous,'' Judge W. Eugene Davis wrote
for the unanimous three-judge panel.
   Mrs. Black was slain in Bryan, Texas. A federal jury in Houston
in 1988 awarded her son and mother $9.4 million over an ad John
Wayne Hearn placed in a 1984 issue of the magazine, which is aimed
at adventurers and military enthusiasts.
   Mrs. Black's husband, Robert, was convicted of hiring Hearn to
kill her. Robert Black is on Death Row in Texas, and Hearn is in
Florida serving three life sentences for the Black killing and two
other murders.
   Soldier of Fortune's lawyers argued that there was no way its
publishers could have known that Hearn's ad offering an ex-Marine
and Vietnam veteran's services for ``high-risk assignments'' was a
solicitation for murder.
   ``The burden on a publisher to avoid liability from suits of this
type is too great,'' the appeals court ruled today.
   The court said: ``Without a more specific indication of illegal
intent than Hearn's ad or its context provided, we conclude that
Soldier of Fortune did not violate the standard of conduct by
publishing an ad that later played a role in criminal activity.''
   John Roberson, a lawyer for Mrs. Black's son Gary, 19, and
mother, Marjorie Eimann, 65, said ``high-risk assignment'' clearly
meant ``gun for hire'' in the lingo of the magazine.
   Attorneys for the magazine conceded that possibility but said the
ad could be seen simply as a solicitation for a job as a bodyguard
or security officer.

   A 17-year-old wearing a ``wire'' as part
of a burglary investigation was shot to death by two teen-age
friends after apparently straying out of range of deputies listening
in, authorities said.
   The body of Dramonte Smith was found Wednesday in a wooded area
in lower Bossier Parish, sheriff's deputies said. He had been shot
several times.
   Deputies investigating several thefts and automobile burglaries
said they questioned Smith on Monday and that he agreed to wear the
listening device. However, deputies lost contact with him, and he
was shot Tuesday, authorities said.
   Bryan Widenhouse and Dwayne Moseley, both 17, were charged with
murder, said Deputy Don Rittenberry.
   Deputies said they believe Moseley and Widenhouse, who had also
been questioned about the burglaries, lured Smith to the woods on
the pretext of picking up a stolen rifle.

   WCVG-AM discontinued the Presley format on Wednesday after a year
of using it. The station has adopted the Business Radio Network, a

   A woman accused of writing a bad check for
groceries on Christmas Eve tried to eat the evidence, and now is
charging authorities with violating her civil rights by pulling the
check from her mouth.
   The FBI is investigating a complaint by Patricia L. Conner, 42,
that authorities injured her while stopping her from eating a check
in the Boone County prosecutor's office last week, John A. Teeling,
an FBI special agent in Indianapolis, said Wednesday.
   Conner, who is unemployed, was charged with writing a bad check
for $116.20 to a supermarket. She grabbed the check from her file
after asking to see the file and stuffed it into her mouth, said
Prosecutor Rebecca S. McClure.
   An off-duty state trooper ``put his hand underneath her chin to
stop her from chewing and asked her repeatedly to spit out the
check. The trooper finally took it out,'' McClure said.
   ``We spread it out and dried it overnight and it was fine. It
will be used as evidence'' in the bad-check trial, McClure said.
   If Conner had eaten the check, a photocopy was available to use
as evidence, McClure said.
   Conner, who was released on bail Wednesday, also will stand trial
on charges of obstructing justice and resisting law enforcement.

   A fourth attempt to boost a
star-gazing satellite into its designated orbit failed Thursday, and
the mission may have to be revised, the European Space Agency said.
   A fifth attempt to ignite the booster of the High Precision
Parallax Collecting Satellite will be made Monday, the agency said.
   The Apogee Boost Motor is needed to propel the satellite into its
geostationary orbit at an altitute of 22,320 miles above the equator.
   Hipparcos, launched Aug. 9 by the space agency's Ariane rocket,
is designed to provide precise measurement of the positions and
motion of the stars.
   Scientists involved in the project are considering a revised
mission for the satellite in case the they fail to ignite the
booster, according to a statement from the space agency's operations
center in Darmstadt, near Frankfurt.
   The satellite then may remain in an elliptical orbit that would
reduce its projected mission goals by about half.

   The city's streets may be grubby, but the
police officers who patrol them have been named best-dressed in the
nation.
   Leaders of the National Association of Uniform Manufacturers and
Distributors, a New York-based trade association, proclaimed
Philadelphia police the best in uniform among 45 large cities.
   Runners-up were Louisville, Ky., and Birmingham, Ala. Denver won
the award last year, but didn't enter this time.
   Police Commissioner Willie L. Williams, wearing a gray suit,
accepted a plaque Wednesday from Richard Bistrong, who heads the
trade association's police committee.
   ``The award is to the men and women,'' Williams said. ``In spite
of the criticism, and at times, the adverse conditions they have to
work under, the stresses, they present an outstanding appearance.''
   Williams was surrounded by police in various uniforms: basic
patrol, stakeout, mounted, traffic and canine squads.
   The basic patrol uniform consists of navy blue dress jacket and
cap; navy pants with a half-inch wide royal blue stripe; black tie;
and light blue shirts. Commanders wear white shirts.
   The basic look has been the same since the 1970s, when Frank
Rizzo, a former police commissioner, was mayor.
   The department entered seven types of uniforms for special duty,
from the helmets and high boots of the Highway Patrol to the black
T-shirts, pants and baseball caps of the Stakeout Unit.
   An independent panel of law enforcement and garment experts
evaluated entries in the contest on the basis of image projection,
immediate recognition, reflection of authority, professionalism,
practicality, standards and regular inspections.
   ``To be quite frank, a lot of police officers around the country
look like slobs,'' one of the three judges, Scott Kingwill of Law
and Order magazine, said.

   The Communist Party today suggested a rewrite of
the agreement that formed the Soviet Union, opening the possibility
for complete change in the nation's structure.
   Party leaders also said the 15 Soviet republics might be able to
``question'' national laws before a high court with greater powers,
according to a draft policy published in the Communist Party daily
Pravda.
   It appeared to be a partial concession to the Baltic republics of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which have amended their
constitutions to have the right to reject national laws. The Kremlin
has said this violates the Soviet Constitution.
   The draft policy also calls for a law banning ``nationalist and
chauvinist'' organizations, which could be used against groups
demanding independence from the central government.
   The party's Central Committee is to act on the measures at a
meeting in September.
   The party said that to achieve a transformation of the Soviet
federation, ``the question has been raised of working out and
signing a new union agreement instead of the Treaty on the Formation
of the U.S.S.R. of 1922.''
   That could be limited to expanding the powers of the 15
republics, but it also opens the possibility that radicals could
push through a complete change.
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov has suggested a loose
confederation of sovereign states, and many nationalists in the
Baltics and Georgia have called for secession from the Soviet Union.
   Aigar Irgens, an editor at Atmoda, the newspaper of the Latvian
Popular Front, said of the party's proposal: ``We don't want a new
agreement. We want complete independence.''
   Many of the more than 100 nationalities in the Soviet Union have
formed groups to agitate for changes ranging from restoration of
their native languages to secession.
   The proposed law against ``nationalist and chauvenist
organizations'' could target pro-secession groups such as the Party
of National Independence in Georgia, Russian strikers protesting a
new language law in Estonia, or the mass-membership Estonian Popular
Front, which supported the language law.
   Irgens said the effect of the proposed ban would depend on the
definition of nationalist. ``We have nationalist groups in Latvia,
but the term is very broad,'' he said.
   The Communist Party proposal says the republics ``can raise the
question'' of rejecting national laws they believe exceed the
authority of the central government. But it says the central
government has the power to cancel unconstitutional laws passed in
the republics.
   The party suggests that such disputes be settled by the
Constitutional Control Commission, a new quasi-Supreme Court created
in last year's political reform.
   Publication of the draft proposal was highly unusual in that it
came prior to its adoption. Until recently, the party did not
announce the dates and agendas of its Central Committee meetings
until they were under way.
   The draft, which was approved by the ruling Politburo, is
expected to be discussed by party officials in the republics prior
to next month's meeting.
   That meeting has been postponed several times because of ethnic
violence that has killed more than 200 people in the last year and a
half.
   In hopes of heading off futher conflict, the party proposal calls
for a law that would guarantee the rights of citizens living outside
their national boundaries.
   It also calls for creation of a government entity to handle
ethnic relations.
   In Helsinki, Finland today, Gen. Dmitri Yazov, the Soviet defense
minister, said the Soviet Union would not increase its military
presence in the Baltic republics, despite strikes and demonstrations
in the region.
   ``The situation in the Baltic republics is due to our domestic
policies of glasnost and perestroika, and as you well understand,
the results have not always been positive,'' Yazov told reporters
during a three-day visit to Finland that ends Friday.
   ``Glasnost and perestroika are not meant for everyone, and the
new legislation in Estonia is a step backward,'' Yazov said,
referring to new Estonian legislation requiring a minimum two years
residence in the republic to vote in local elections. ``Glasnost''
and ``perestroika'' are the catchwords of President Mikhail
Gorbachev's economic and social reforms.
   The new Estonian legislation prompted the strikes by ethnic
Russians alleging discrimination. On Wednesday, the national
Presidium declared the new Estonian election law unconstitutional.

   Pilot error was to blame for the Aug. 3
crash of an Olympic Airways plane that killed all 34 people aboard,
the government said Thursday.
   An investigation blamed veteran pilot Petros Moutzoureas for his
``wrong assessment'' of the aircraft's position in the clouds, his
``failure to change the plane's altitude to avoid the mountain'' and
his ``failure in maintaining flight regulations,'' according to
Communications Minister Nikos Gelestathis.
   The Shorts SD 3-30 twin-engine turboprop aircraft was on an
inter-island flight after departing from Salonica, northern Greece,
when it slammed into the sheer granite slopes of 4,785-foot Mount
Kerkis in dense fog minutes before it was scheduled to land on Samos
island.
   Olympic said Moutzoureas, 42, had logged 8,000 hours of flight
time on the British-built aircraft.
   Rescuers found the remains of the three crew and 31 passengers
and parts of the plane, at the 3,960-foot level of Mount Kerkis, the
highest mountain in the Aegean. Eight of the dead were from Canada.

<TEXT>
   Seventy-two-year-old Gertrude Eberly
had been retired for nine years, living in Nevada on a modest
pension when the state of California dunned her for nearly $4,000.
   Even though Eberly had moved from California in 1978, the
Franchise Tax Board sent the former state worker a bill in December
1987 for back taxes, interest and penalties on her California
pension for 1981-86.
   After exhausting appeals to the tax board and state and federal
politicians, Eberly arranged to pay. California allowed her to make
$50 monthly installments to accommodate her annual pension and
Social Security income of less than $13,000.
   But in pursuing the money, California unwittingly fueled a
growing grassroots campaign against what Eberly and other pensioners
nationwide say is unfair taxation by 13 states.
   ``I was just totally overcome and so helpless,'' Eberly said in a
telephone interview from her home in Fallon, Nev., where she moved
to be near her daughter's family after retiring with 31 years
service in the California Employment Development Department.
   ``I wrote, I think it was 120 letters to senators and
representatives and advocacy agencies for the elderly. I got seven
replies. In those, they said, `Well, this is not our problem.'''
   Her Nevada representatives told her that since it was a
California tax, she should write to Gov. George Deukmejian.
Deukmejian's office politely suggested she write her Nevada
representatives.
   ``I had no representation. That's when I got angry and decided it
was unconstitutional.''
   California is one of 13 states that collect a ``source tax'' on
pensions sent outside their borders, said Bill Hoffman, head of a
group called Retirees to Eliminate State Income Source Tax, or
RESIST.
   The other states are Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and
Virginia, Hoffman said. North Carolina recently approved a similar
tax and several other states are poised to do so, he said.
   RESIST members complain they are paying taxes to states where
they are no longer residents, can't vote and don't use the freeways
and other tax-financed services.
   ``Of course the biggest objection to this tax is that it's
taxation without representation,'' Hoffman said. ``I have no control
over it. They could double or triple or quadruple the tax and I
couldn't do anything about it.''
   Hoffman, 57, a retired aerospace engineer, founded RESIST last
summer after he and his wife, Joanne, moved from Torrance to Carson
City, Nev., only to find they still had to pay California taxes.
Nevada has no state income tax.
   The loose-knit organization now has chapters in at least 35
states, with about 8,000 members who are lobbying for federal
legislation to outlaw the tax.
   Their tax revolt is a law-abiding one. Like Eberly, most end up
paying the tax, albeit under protest, Hoffman and tax officials said.
   According to tax officials, source tax on nonresidents is legal
and fair.
   Pensioners weren't taxed on the income when it went into their
retirement accounts, but are obligated to pay the tax once they
collect retirement _whether they still live in the state or not.
   ``We are not taxing people without representation,'' said Jim
Reber, a spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board. ``They were
represented when they made that income.''
   California source tax dates to 1935, but the state has stepped up
enforcement in recent years largely because of new, more
sophisticated computer records to track potential taxpayers, Reber
said.
   In 1986, the state collected $7 million from 33,000 nonresidents
who filed returns reporting pensions and annuities from California,
he said. That compares with $409 million in income taxes on
annuities and pensions reported by 1.6 million Californians during
the same year.
   ``The concept is this _ all during the time you were working in
California you were receiving a professional tax break on deferred
income,'' Reber said.
   ``It was money that was never taxed in the first place. ... Now
that you're retired, the state wants it's fair share of that tax.''
   California has agreements with other states that levy income tax
to prevent double taxation on the pensions.
   California only taxes income earned within the state, but it
calculates the tax rate based on total income, which can
substantially raise the tax bill if the retiree has other income.
The new home state may do the same. Critics say the result is, in
effect, double taxation.
   Retirees with California pensions say their former home state
never told them about the tax before sending them bills that include
late penalties of 55 percent and interest of 10 percent to 13
percent.
   ``If indeed they were going to do this to us, somebody should
have told us,'' Hoffman said. ``And I think they should have given
us some options. Maybe we could have paid the taxes as we went
along.''

<TEXT>
   The Oregon Symphony Association's first two
concerts of the season have been canceled in a contract dispute with
its 85 musicians.
   Orchestra management said it considers the musicians to be on
strike, which the union disputed. Contract talks have been going on
for nine months.
   The first performance of the 1989-90 season was to have been
Tuesday. Besides canceling that and an Aug. 27 concert in Astoria,
the dispute threatens the opening of the symphony's subscription
season on Sept. 17.
   ``In light of the union's public statements that it would not
play without a contract, the symphony considers the union to be on
strike as of today,'' Carlos Wilson, managing director of the
association, said Wednesday.
   ``This is not a strike,'' said Robert Findlay,
secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Musicians Local
99. ``The musicians have not walked off the job.''
   The players' old three-year contract expired June 13. At issue
are wages and hours.
   The American Symphony Orchestra League ranked the Oregon
Symphony's pay 32nd among the country's 40 major symphony orchestras.

<HEAD>Georges Bank Surf Clam Beds Closed Because of Toxins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clam beds on Georges Bank have been closed because
of high levels of toxins caused by red tide.
   The 90-day closing of the fishing grounds 100 miles east of Cape
Cod to surf-clam harvesters was declared last week by the U.S.
Department of Commerce.
   High quantities of paralytic shellfish toxins were found in the
clams, said Brian Gorman of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. Red tide toxin causes tingling on the tongue and
lips and can lead to respiratory failure and death.
   Gorman said he believed it was the first time in the roughly five
years that surf clams have been extensively fished on the bank that
the area was closed because of red tide, an algae-like organism
normally found in shellfish closer to shore.
   Surf clams are used mainly in canned soup and other processed
food because they are tougher than regular clams found in coastal
waters, Gorman said.
   The value of the surf clam catch in that area last year was
$800,000, said Jack Terrill, a resource policy analyst for the
National Marine Fisheries Service in Gloucester.
   Terrill said finding the toxins in shellfish so far from shore
``caught everybody by surprise.''

<HEAD>Outlawed Groups Plan Weekend Rallies to Defy Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of outlawed
anti-apartheid groups said Thursday they would hold a series of
rallies this weekend, the latest phase in a new campaign to defy
government suppression of dissent.
   In Cape Town, police halted a march led by Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu in support of the opposition campaign.
   The police escorted Tutu and about 60 other people back to St.
George's Cathedral about 30 minutes after they began marching
through the city center protesting the arrests of former prisoners
who were defying restrictions imposed on them.
   Plans for the weekend rallies were announced at a news conference
at the Central Methodist Church in downtown Johannesburg.
Plainclothes police officers were present and confiscated a
reporter's tape-recording of the announcement.
   Titus Mafolo, an executive of the banned United Democratic Front,
said it was possible that police might arrest the five white, black
and Indian activists who announced the campaign while dressed in
United Democratic Front T-shirts. Such items are banned under the
government's emergency regulations.
   ``We don't plan our actions having that (detention) in mind.
Otherwise we wouldn't plan anything,'' Mafolo said.
   The United Democratic Front, a coalition of hundreds of church,
youth and labor groups that was banned in Feburary 1988, will lead
``all restricted organizations at a mass rally'' at the University
of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg on Sunday, Mafolo said.
   ``All restricted organizations will consider themselves to be
free to operate and organize within their constituencies,'' he said.
   Sunday is the sixth anniversary of the founding of the United
Democratic Front.
   On Saturday, a banned white group affiliated with the United
Democratic Front ``will take the defiance campaign into the white
suburbs.'' He said members wearing United Democratic Front T-shirts
will distribute literature and sell the outlawed shirts outside a
shopping center in a northern Johannesburg neighborhood, said
Wilhelm Liebenberg of the Johannesburg Democratic Action Committee.
   The rallies are the latest phase in a campaign launched Aug. 3 to
defy apartheid laws and emergency restrictions that have forced most
anti-apartheid activists to operate underground. The campaign began
with blacks seeking treatment at white hospitals.
   The next step began when scores of activists who had been
released from detention began violating their restrictions, which
confined them to their homes at night, curtailed their political
activities, and required them to report daily to police stations.
The Department of Law and Order says it has arrested and charged
more than 30 former prisoners.
   Ephraim Nkoe, spokesman for the banned South African Youth
Congress, told reporters an estimated 1,000 people are under
restrictions. He said these were imposed by police seeking to
``maintain white rule and the oppression of the masses.''
   Organizers of the defiance campaign say they seek to avoid
violence. However, there have been almost daily confrontations in
the Cape Town area between mixed-race students and police in which
the youths have thrown stones and erected barricades in the streets
and the police have fired tear gas. The school violence spread to
Durban this week where it was met with police birdshot.

   Three bombs exploded in the Chittagong
hills, killing at least 11 people and injuring 41 others, police
said Thursday. A senior police officer blamed Buddhist insurgents.
   At least 10 people were killed and 40 injured in two blasts
Wednesday, according to the officer in Khagrachari, 110 miles
southeast of Dhaka.
   One explosion occurred in a crowded market in Khagrachari and the
other in a passenger boat on a lake in Rangamati, 45 miles south of
Khagrachari, he said.
   The boat was severely damaged in the blast, he said. It was not
known how many people were aboard.
   On Tuesday, a bomb exploded on a road in Khagrachari, killing one
person and wounding another, according to the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, but the officer
blamed them on Buddhist tribal insurgents from the Army for Peace.
The insurgents are fighting for more autonomy for the tribes of the
Chittagong Hill Tracts.
   More than 4,000 people have been killed since the insurrection
began 14 years ago. The hills cover 5,200 square miles of
inhospitable land bordering Burma and the northeastern Indian states
of Tripura and Mizoram.
   Police said one suspected member of the Shanti Bahini was killed
in a gunbattle Tuesday with the border security guards. The fighting
between the security forces and the guerrillas has prompted more
than 50,000 tribespeople to flee to Tripura.

   A Panamanian vessel carrying soda ash

Columbia River, but neither vessel lost any cargo, the Coast Guard
said.
   The Panamanian ship, the 172-foot T.S. Prosperity, was about five

with the 11 million-gallon Chevron Louisiana occurred at 2:50 a.m.,
said Lt. Cmdr. David Gault.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation, said Lt. Cmdr.
Guy Nolan.
   ``Both vessels sounded all their tanks and there's no sign of
anything leaking,'' he said.
   The Panamanian ship, which was carrying about 24,500 metric tons
of soda ash, was refloated at 5:48 a.m. and continued on to Japan,
Gault said.
   The 651-foot oil tanker, which had been headed for Portland with
a heavy mixture of asphalt and diesel, was anchored in Longview this
morning, Nolan said.
   ``We'll have divers and the appropriate people checking things
before they go anywhere,'' he said.

<HEAD>Largest Group Yet of Vietnamese Repatriated Voluntarily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 121 Vietnamese returned Thursday to
the land they fled, the largest voluntary repatriation of refugees
from Hong Kong's teeming camps.
   Waving handkerchiefs and clutching bags packed with clothes and
radios, the refugees boarded a Boeing 737 at Hong Kong's airport and
took off for Hanoi.
   From there, the 46 men, 40 women, 17 boys and 18 girls will be
taken to their hometowns and monitored by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   ``I think this is an extremely hopeful sign,'' said Robert van
Leeuwen, head of the U.N. refugee office in Hong Kong, as the jet's
engines roared behind him. ``The Vietnamese seemed very hopeful to
go back.''
   Originally, 124 people had volunteered to return, but three were
forced to stay in Hong Kong for medical reasons, van Leeuwen said.
   He said 190 more were waiting to return to Vietnam and between
600 and 700 more refugees had applied to go back.
   ``Voluntary repatriation is the best shot,'' he said. The remark
was significant because Vietnam and Britain are negotiating a plan
to force many of the 51,000 Vietnamese refugees to return. The
United States has said it opposes forced repatriation.
   Hanoi's communist government has said it won't prosecute those
returning to the country, one of the poorest in Asia. U.N. officials
on Thursday reiterated that they would monitor the returning
refugees closely.
   Until last year, Hong Kong allowed all Vietnamese refugees the
right to settle in the British colony if they could not immigrate to
another country. But under a tough policy instituted in June, the
government ruled out resettlement for new refugees unless they could
prove they were escaping political persecution.
   Since then, about 38,300 Vietnanmese have sailed to Hong Kong and
are being housed in a series of camps, detention centers and halfway
houses in the crowded colony of 5 million people. About 4,700 live
in tents on a nearby island and another 1,800 cram five ferries in
conditions the United Nations has called ``life-threatening.''
   The government began a voluntary repatriation program in March,
and groups of 75 and 68 refugees have returned.
   Van Leeuwen said although the voluntary repatriation program had
begun slowly, he had hopes that it would soon accelerate.
   He said adult returnees had been given $150 and children 14 years
or under $75 to return. Previous groups had been given $50 for
adults and $25 for children.
   The departure comes at a time when Hong Kong is under pressure
from the United Nations to improve the conditions in the camps.
   A preliminary report earlier this week said boat people on Tai A
Chau island and on five ferries in Hong Kong's harbor were in danger
of dying because of malnutrition and disease.
   Last week, another U.N. official said the camps were some of the
worst he had seen, saying the space given to some refugees ``is even
less than what is supposed to be given here for a dog.''
   The U.N. also has alleged police beat about 100 boat people
during a July 23 disturbance at a detention center in the New
Territories section of Hong Kong.
   Several of the boat people said they were going home because they
missed their families.
   In the Philippines, meanwhile, a U.N. refugee agency said 166
Vietnamese boat people landed in the country in August.
   A report by the Manila representative of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees said the most recent arrival occurred
Monday, when 21 Vietnamese reached Lawak island off Palawan
province, 360 miles southwest of Manila.
   The August arrivals brought to 5,438 the number of boat people
who have landed in the Philippines this year, the report said.
Although the month is far from over, a source who asked not to be
identified said the August arrivals so far indicate a decline from
the 604 Vietnamese refugees who landed in the Philippines during the
same month last year.

   President Bush monitored
governmental shuffling in Poland today as he began a three-week
seaside vacation, and the White House said the ``sensitive
situation'' was an overall positive development.
   ``We do encourage and support the process of pluralism and it
appears that is the general direction that they are aimed,'' in
Poland, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters who
accompanied the president to Maine.
   ``Certainly a non-Communist government would be a remarkable and
history-making occurrence,'' he added in reference to reports tht
opposition leader Lech Walesa was being supported for prime minister
by his own Solidarity labor movement and two small political parties
that have traditaionlly backed the Communists.
   Fitzwater spoke today before it was reported that Polish
President Wojciech Jaruzelski approved Walesa's offer to form a
coalition government led by non-Communists. But after learning of
the development, he said, ``There still are many unanswered
questions.''
   He said the president had not been immediately informed of the
development because he was out boating.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said,
``We welcome progress in the formation of a government which would
enjoy broad and popular support, and we emphasize this continues to
be a matter for the Polish people.''
   Bush met with Walesa, as well as goverment leaders, during his
trip to Europe in July.
   Fitzwater said Bush had not been directly involved in talks with
East bloc leaders on the subject. The spokesman was careful to state
that the United States did not want to ``intrude in the internal
affairs'' in Poland but said the United States ``would encourage a
non-Communist government.''
   ``It's a sensitive situation there, in terms of the general move
away from Communist control, but ... we do not want to do anything
or say anything to upset the apple cart, as it were, in terms of the
progress they're making.''
   ``We feel very positive in an oveerall sense about events that
are occurring there.''
   Fitzwater said the president, after his morning intelligence
briefings went boating this morning, accompanied by two of his sons,
George and Neil.
   Several other offspring and grandchildren joined the president
and first lady Barbara Bush on Wednesday night to watch the lunar
eclipse from the family compound on Walker's Point.
   Bush arrived in Maine Wednesday, announcing he was aiming to
``get my body in shape'' with his favorite vacation pastime _
intensive exercise.
   The president and first lady Barbara Bush were expecting separate
visits from Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Danish Prime
Minister Poul Schluter, but those were to be personal rather than
business-oriented, the White House said.
   Bush flew to this resort town from Miami, where he made a one-day
campaign foray in behalf of Republican congressional candidate
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is vying against Democrat Gerald Richman to
succeed the late Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper.
   The White House also announced Wednesday that Bush will make his
first televised address to the nation as president Sept. 5 to reveal
his national strategy to combat drug abuse.
   The president ``wanted to discuss it directly with the American
people,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said the president, in a meeting Tuesday with his
Domestic Policy Council of Cabinet and senior advisers, signed off
on the broad planks of the strategy. He said, however, ``there's
still some outstanding specifics'' to be decided.
   The strategy will target drug users much more intensively than
past policy, which has focused on interdiction, said one
knowledgeable official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush on Wednesday made a decision on one key aspect of the
anti-drug plan that had divided his top advisers _ whether to
withhold federal highway funds and other support to states that fail
to implement sufficiently tough policies, such as revoking drivers'
licenses of drug offenders, it was learned. However, officials did
not disclose the president's decision.
   Officials said the anti-drug strategy also will entail expanded
use of the U.S. military to help combat drugs at the source in
foreign countries, when those countries request assistance.
   ``The No. 1 issue in Miami, and the No. 1 issue across America,
is drugs and the violent crime they spawn,'' Bush said in Miami.
   Bush also made a point on the Miami stop of stating that he will
never restore normalized relations with Cuba unless President Fidel
Castro implements democratic freedoms for his people.
   Drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett has called for a
dramatic increase in drug treatment funds for 1990, according to a
draft of his national drug strategy.
   The draft obtained by The Associated Press revealed that Bennett
wants $925 million for drug treatment next year, a 49 percent
increase over the current spending.
   Another administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday the drug plan's total cost would be
``roughly a billion'' dollars more than Bush's February budget
proposal of $5.5 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Bush plans to interrupt his vacation for a visit in Washington on
Sept. 1 with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Bush will return to Washington the day before he makes the
television address on drugs. In the meantime, he was eager to begin
his vacation regimen of running, boating, fishing, tennis and golf
while staying at his family compound on Walker's Point.
   Bush brought only a skeleton crew of staff with him and aides
said he did not expect to conduct much business beyond his daily
intelligence briefings.

<TEXT>
   Renewed fighting in northwestern
Somilia has forced about 8,000 people to flee to Ethiopia in the
past two weeks, according to a U.N. official.
   Albert-Alain Peters, an Addis Ababa representative of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, said Wednesday that about 650
refugees were entering Ethiopia daily, up from 150 at the beginning
of August.
   The refugees had reported heavy fighting between the rebel Somali
National Movement and government troops around the garrison town of
Borama near the Ethiopian border, Peters said.
   Borama is about 60 miles northwest of Hargeisa, Somalia's
second-largest town.
   The refugees, mostly women and children, are camped in a remote
area six miles from the border and about 250 miles northeast of
Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.
   Peters, who returned from a visit to the area Wednesday, said the
U.N. agency would start caring for the refugees as soon as Ethiopian
authorities moved them to more easily accessible areas farther
inside the country.
   They are the latest in a wave of refugees who started coming
across the border in May 1988 when fighting intensified between the
rebels and government troops around the northern towns of Hargeisa,
Burao and Berbera. An estimated 350,000 Somalis have sought refuge
in U.N.-managed camps near Jijiga, about 60 miles southwest of the
new arrivals.
   The Somali National Movement has been fighting to topple the
government of President Mohamed Siad Barre since 1981.
   Exiled dissidents recently have claimed Barre's government has
lost control of all but the capital and is experiencing the most
widespread fighting across the East African nation since Barre
seized power in 1969.
   The dissidents say that in addition to the northern fighting,
soldiers who belong to the Ogadeni clan have turned against the
government in the south.
   A Kenyan newspaper reported that more than 5,500 Somalis had fled
to Kenya following government raids on their southern Somali border
town last month.
   It is impossible to confirm rebel claims independently. The
government has refused to let journalists into Somalia since May
1988 and Mogadishu residents contacted by telephone say they know
little about events outside the capital.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is looking into a possible design
miscalculation in its largest nuclear missile, the Trident 2, that
may have caused the latest test failure of the weapon.
   Rear Adm. Kenneth C. Malley, chief of the Navy's ballistic
missile program, said that despite computer simulations, engineers
seriously underestimated the amount of pressure on the Trident as it
thrusts upward after being launched from underwater.
   Malley, in an interview published today in The New York Times,
said designers had failed to foresee how the movement of the missile
would cause ``water jets'' and the effect they would have on the
missile.
   Although the Navy said it could not make Malley available for an
interview, it did confirm that his statements to the Times were
accurate.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Greg Smith said the service retains ``full
confidence'' in the Trident system, and that ``no impact is
presently foreseen'' on the planned deployment of the submarine USS
Tennessee with the missiles in early 1990.
   In a statement, the Navy said the submarine will undergo a
two-month ``shakedown'' at the Electric Boat docks in Groton, Conn.,
where ``evaluation and correction action for the test failure will
be conducted.''
   In the interview, Malley said the missile ``is much larger than
anything we've fired before. ... We expected some extra pressure on
the rear end of the missile and its rocket nozzles, but not as much
as we're seeing. It turns out that the pressure and the aft load are
much more severe than was anticipated.''
   Asked if the failures were a result of a design error or a flaw
in the manufacturing, the admiral said: ``The device was built to
specification. There is no question that it was designed the way it
was intended to be designed.''
   The first Trident 2 exploded off the east coast of Florida four
seconds after it was launched from a submarine on March 21. The
second test was considered largely successful but the third missile
to be launched self-destructed on Tuesday.
   The Trident 2 is expected to be deployed in the 1990s aboard a
new generation of submarines. With up to eight large nuclear
warheads, it is supposed to be the Navy's centerpiece in the U.S.
nuclear arsenal until 2032.
   Until the test failures, the missile had been one of the Defense
Department's nuclear modernization programs to be mostly
problem-free, with 16 of 19 successful land launchings.
   Engineers apparently failed to anticipate the amount and effect
of turbulence on the new missile during its underwater movement. At
44 feet and 130,000 pounds, it is much longer and almost twice as
heavy as its earlier version, the Trident 1.
   Because of the miscalculation, the original nozzles on the
missile's first-stage rocket did not have the strength to withstand
the increased turbulence, Malley said.
   The nozzles were redesigned after the first failure but tests
must be done to determine why they failed during Tuesday's
launching, he said.
   Malley said he was confident the Trident 2 would be ready as
scheduled on March 31 once the department he heads, the Stategic
Systems Program Office, fixes the missile.
   Because of the large number of Navy officials and subcontractors
working on the Trident program, it was not immediately clear when or
by whom the miscalculations were made, the Navy said.

<HEAD>Installation, Repairs Slower; Operator Service Picking Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New telephone installation remained backlogged
Thursday by a strike at four regional Bell phone companies, but
customers were having better luck reaching operator assistance,
company and union officials said.
   Bill Bickers, spokesman for the striking Communications Workers
of America local at Bell Atlantic, said service was ``spotty in some
places'' as management personnel were pressed into unfamiliar
duties. ``The company's slow on installation and repairs in some
locations.''
   Operator-assisted calls also were ``not up to normal snuff, but
it's moderate,'' Bickers said. ``In some locations it's really
slow.''
   Recorded messages continued to tell 411 directory assistance
callers that ``due to the work stoppage, your call may be delayed.''
But telephone company officials said the waits were becoming shorter
as managers got to know the computer equipment.
   ``We're finding that the delays have dissipated some because of
the fact that our temporary operators have become more proficient
with their skills,'' said Steve Ford, a spokesman for one of the
four companies, Ameritech.
   Operator-assisted calls, maintenance and repairs were being
handled at near pre-strike levels in many areas, officials said.
   But on-premises installations continued to be hard hit because of
the strike by nearly 200,000 operators, clerks, technicians and
others represented by the CWA and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers.
   The strike began Aug. 6 against NYNEX, Bell Atlantic and Pacific
Telesis and on Aug. 13 against Ameritech. The walkouts affected
phone service in 20 states and the District of Columbia.
   ``We are deferring service that requires dispatch of a human
being,'' said Larry Plumb, a spokesman for Philadelphia-based Bell
Atlantic. ``But if they are using service already in place ... that
kind of service is being taken care of. In a typical week that is 65
percent of the work.''
   ``Customers who are doing direct dialing are receiving service as
normal,'' Plumb said. ``Where customers need to talk to a company
representative, we've seen improvement in services since the work
stoppage as managers have gotten more familiar with their jobs.''
   Plumb said operator assistance ``has returned to pre-work
stoppage levels.'' As for directory assistance, ``There are some
customers who will experience delays ... but we have seen
improvements.''
   Plumb said the lengths of the delays ``vary widely.''
   The phone companies urged callers to dial direct when possible,
use their telephone directories and postpone routine calls about
billing.
   The phone networks are highly automated, and the strike primarily
was affecting labor-intensive areas such as installation and
operator assistance.
   Melissa Morin, president of striking local 1400 of the CWA in New
Hampshire, said, ``Directory assistance is running about a minute to
two minutes delay.''
   She added, however, ``In some cases I know some people sat
waiting 15 minutes for an operator.''
   Morin said her 200-member local had shut down business phone
installation in the New Hampshire areas served by NYNEX.
   ``As far as business offices are concerned, you can't get new
service at all,'' Morin said. ``Repairs are considerably backed up.
The last I heard it was about a five-day wait to get a phone fixed''
in Northeastern areas where heavy rains have sparked failures.
   However, Andrea Dudley, a spokeswoman for NYNEX-owned New England
Telephone Co., said installations were proceeding, albeit slowly.
   ``Obviously, we are having to set priorities, and phone service
to fire departments and police ... would have priority,'' she said.
``Obviously, we are having delays, but we are working through our
orders.
   ``There are still delays in reaching directory assistance and
getting assistance for operator calls, and we still have
installation and repair delays,'' Dudley said.
   ``The key challenge is installation,'' Ameritech's Ford
acknowledged. ``If it requires a promised visit, that may take
longer than it normally would.''
   In Indiana, for instance, ``instead of two days it may be three
or four days'' before an on-premises installation may be arranged,
Ford said.
   Scott Smith, a spokesman for Pacific Bell in San Francisco, said:
``Our repair service is normal, for the most part. ... Directory
assistance and operator assistance are near normal.'' Installation
was ``slow'' in some areas.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Refuses Judge Walter Nixon New Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Thursday refused to
grant a new trial for U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon, a
Mississippi judge who was convicted of perjury and impeached.
   The three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
a lower court ruling.
   Nixon, who is serving a five-year sentence, was convicted of two
counts of perjury after denying in 1984 before a federal grand jury
and Justice Department investigators that he intervened in a
narcotics case involving the son of a Hattiesburg, Miss., business
executive. Nixon was acquitted of accepting an illegal gratuity.
   The U.S. House unanimously impeached Nixon in May and sent the
case on to the Senate for trial to decide if he should be ousted
from office. The case is expected to go before before a 12-member
Senate panel next month.
   Nixon, who was imprisoned at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, has
been sent to a halfway house in New Orleans to complete his
sentence. He has collected more than $286,000 in salary since his
conviction.
   Nixon based his appeal for a new trial on claims that the
government withheld information, that the business executive
recanted some of his trial testimony, and that the government
knowingly presented false testimony.
   The court disagreed, saying, ``Judge Nixon was not denied a
fundamentally fair trial.''

<TEXT>
   The North Tarrytown Board of
Trustees has approved a zoning change that clears the way for
turning John D. Rockefeller's home into a museum.
   But it will be at least a year before the public can tour the
four-story Georgian mansion in the Pocantico Hills area, said Robert
Snyder, president of Greenrock Corp., which manages the Rockefeller
family's estates.
   The zoning change was approved Wednesday night. Mount Pleasant
changed its zoning in June. The property straddles the towns.
   The 86-acre property is part of the 250-acre Rockefeller park,
which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. The
mansion houses an art collection and has an outdoor sculpture garden
and a coach barn.
   Nelson Rockefeller left the property to the National Trust for
Historic Preservation when he died in 1979 and stipulated that a
plan be developed to open it to the public and preserve its history.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comic book artist Tom Roberts, his body
deteriorating with muscular dystrophy, gives his readers a
vitriolic, raw message straight from the heart: a comic book with
handicapped heroes and off-color jokes.
   ``Trashy,'' said one reader.
   ``A cruel joke,'' says another.
   ``Appropriately outrageous,'' says Charlotte DesJardins of the
Coordinating Council for Handicapped Children.
   Roberts' underground comics feature the superheroes Blindman, Mr.
Wheels, Deaf Girl and The Human Crutch _ the Infirmity 4.
   Armored wheelchairs, a flame-spewing crutch and a seeing-eye
hound burst from the pages of ``Anti-Social for the Disabled.''
   In addition to the superheroes, the 29-year-old Roberts presents
inappropriate jokes: ``Why don't blind people skydive? It scares
hell out of their dog.''
   And there's ``Freaky Franky,'' a paralyzed Franklin Roosevelt,
who out of embarrassment refuses to use a wheelchair and orders the
Secret Service to prop him up and propel him from behind.
   Roberts, who was stricken with muscular dystrophy when he was 15,
remembers his first night out in a wheelchair.
   ``I rolled into an Oak Park restaurant. I felt every eye on me.
What else could I do? I started laughing.''
   This seems to describe the Muse at his ear when, in 1982, he
began publishing a series of underground comics named ``Anti-Social,
a Helpless Anger Production.''
   The seventh and latest in the series is ``Anti-Social for the
Disabled,'' co-authored by two disabled friends, Mike Ervin and Sue
Nussbaum.
   As his muscles deteriorate, Roberts has lost his ability to take
care of himself well enough to live alone. Eventually, he'll need
help to eat, use the bathroom and to breathe.
   The disintegration of his own life is reflected in the comics.
   ``Sure, it's raw and outrageous,'' said Terry Hamilton, an
employee of Barbara's Bookstore, where Roberts' publications are
sold. ``But our clients are theater people, new wavers, punkers,
Near North Side yuppies _ and that's who likes adult comics. They
deal with serious matters through outrageous drawings and shock.''
   Marca Bristow of Access Living, a support organization for adult
disabled, said, ``it finds ways to laugh at things we'd otherwise
cry about.''
   The 1,000 copies of ``Anti-Social for the Disabled'' that were
printed have been sold, and Roberts says 200 more will be run off.
   Meanwhile, comic No. 8 in the series is under way _ a sequel to
``Anti-Social for the Disabled.''
   And there we'll see Mr. Wheels unable to get up a curb to rescue
a citizen screaming for help.
   But Deaf Girl, using a sonar beam, blasts the curb into a gravel
ramp and ...
   Stay tuned.

   A man who stopped to help a car
crash victim was electrocuted when he accidently touched a live wire
downed in the accident, authorities said.
   Dwain Hammond, 44, had stopped to help Susan A. Tallman, 82, of
Whiting, after her car crashed into and snapped a utility pole
Wednesday afternoon, police Sgt. William Fleming said.
   When Hammond and two other passers-by found the driver's door was
jammed, Hammond tried to reach her through the passenger door and
apparently brushed against a 7,200-volt live wire, said James
Lowney, a spokesman for Jersey Central Power and Light Co.
   Hammond was pronounced dead at a hospital. Mrs. Tallman was
hospitalized in critical but stable condition Thursday.

<HEAD>Government Warns Against Protests on Invasion Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it
will crack down on all public protest on Monday, the anniversary of
the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. Four activists were charged with
incitement.
   The warning, carried by the state news agency CTK, reflected
official concern and the determination to stifle all shows of
dissent by activists seeking political reforms.
   Police investigators in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, charged
four dissidents with incitement for ``spreading alarming material in
Bratislava and other places in Slovakia,'' an Interior Ministry
statement said. They were identified as Jan Carnogursky, Miroslav
Kusy, Hana Ponicka and Anton Selecky.
   Carnogursky and Kusy also were charged with subversion of the
republic and were arrested Thursday, the Interior Ministry said. The
two had called on people to lay wreaths on the graves of victims of
the 1968 invasion.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to five years in
prison on the incitement charge and 10 years under the subversion
charge.
   The 1968 invasion crushed the short-lived ``Prague Spring''
liberalization period spearheaded by then Communist Party leader
Alexander Dubcek, who was ousted in April 1969 and lives as a
pensioner in Bratislava.
   ``The Czechoslovak government ... has decided to thwart
anti-social intentions to secure law, peace and order,'' the
government statement said. ``We are appealing to all citizens to
support these efforts with their actions and attitudes.''
   ``It is no accident that exactly at this time so important for
further process of restructuring and democratization, anti-socialist
groups supported from abroad want to misuse the anniversary of Aug.
21, 1968, to create tension and violence,'' the government said.
   ``Disregarding the demagoguery used, their actions are
objectively aimed against restructuring and democratization,
fundamental human values, against socialism,'' it said.
   Six independent groups last week called on activists to stage
short silent public protests on streets Monday but suggested they
refrain from demonstrations to avoid police brutality.
   Similarly, prominent Czech dissident Vaclav Havel on Tuesday
appealed to citizens not to resort to street protests. He instead
urged citizens to sign the petition known as ``A Few Sentences,''
which has garnered an estimated 15,000 signatures since June.

<HEAD>Ex-U.S. Laser Expert Says Soviet Laser Not State-of-the-Art</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

   The former head of U.S. laser weapons research said
Thursday he was impressed by a Soviet laser he saw melt a piece of
metal, but added that neither superpower would consider the
equipment state-of-the-art technology.
   John Hammond, former head of the directed energy program for the
Pentagon's Strategic Defense Organization, and several top U.S.
lawmakers saw the powerful laser in action Wednesday.
   Hammond said in an interview the powerful ``megawatt carbon
dioxide'' laser at a secretive branch of the Kurchatov Institute of
Atomic Energy in Troitsk near Moscow once was thought to have
potential military applications, but now other types of lasers are
more promising.
   ``This type of laser technology as to high power does not have a
lot of relevance to more strategic-type weapons such as SDI,''
Hammond said, referring to the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative,
popularly called ``Star Wars.''
   ``Nevertheless,'' he added, ``it was quite an impressive thing to
accomplish.''
   Of the visit itself, he said, ``This does in fact represent an
openness on the part of the Soviet Union.''
   Hammond was joined by a group from the House Armed Services
Committee, led by Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., who wind up a visit to the
Soviet Union on Friday.
   The former SDI official said the United States developed the type
of laser he saw demonstrated 10 years ago and that both Washington
and Moscow later concluded it would be ``unprofitable for laser
weapons.''
   In the demonstration, the laser produced a beam for three seconds
that partially melted a block of metal and spewed out balls of
ignited gas, Hammond said.
   The congressmen were also shown two devices used in research on
fusion energy.
   The Pentagon says the Soviets are developing high-energy lasers
for strategic air defense, space-based anti-satellite missions and
defense against ballistic missiles.
   The United States has a similar program.
   The lawmakers have been touring Soviet military and space
facilities since Aug. 7 and have seen several previously secret
facilities.
   On Thursday, they met with Yevgeny Primakov, the chairman of one
of the two houses of the Soviet legislature, and discussed setting
up a Soviet-American committee on arms control, Tass reported. They
also discussed joint work between the U.S. Congress and Supreme
Soviet in freeing Soviets missing or captured in Afghanistan and
Americans missing or captured in North Korea, Vietnam and Laos, the
news agency said.
   Later in the day, Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr., R-S.C., challenged a
Soviet official about emigration policy. He said the congressmen met
Wednesday night with a group of refuseniks, Jews refused permission
to emigrate, whom he described as ``very sad, poor, dissatisfied
apparently harmless people who just want to leave.''
   Georgy Arbatov, head of the U.S.A.-Canada Institute _ a Kremlin
think tank and a member of the Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee _ replied: ``If it depended on me, I would kick
them out immediately.''
   Arbatov blamed bureaucrats obsessed with preserving ``state
security'' for blocking the emigration of some Soviets. He
challenged Ravenel's estimate that there were 700 refuseniks, saying
there were just ``a couple dozen.''

   Sarah, the Duchess of York, has written two
children's books based on her experiences as a pilot, Simon &amp;
Schuster said Thursday.
   ``Budgie the Little Helicopter,'' and ``Budgie at Bendick's
Point,'' aimed at children ages 3 to 6, will be published Sept. 11.
   Budgie was the nickname the duchess gave the Jet Ranger
helicopter she trained on in 1987.
   In the books, Budgie has a pal, Pippa, modeled after the Piper
Warrior the duchess used while working toward her private pilot's
license. Another character is Lionel the Lynx; the duchess's
husband, Prince Andrew, is a pilot in the Royal Navy and frequently
flies Lynx helicopters.
   ``Budgie the Little Helicopter,'' dedicated to the author's
daughter, Princess Beatrice, centers on the kidnapping and rescue of
a child named Rose. The child's surname, Wright, is the maiden name
of the duchess's mother.
   The second book, ``Budgie at Bendick's Point,'' is dedicated to
Andrew. Bendicks is the name of a dog that Andrew gave Fergie.
   John Richardson illustrated the books, priced at $9.95. The books
will be excerpted in the September issue of Redbook magazine.

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani took office
today and said improving the standard of living for the poor would
take priority over political infighting, the official Iranian news
agency reported.
   ``I will start my work as president of the Islamic Republic of
Iran today,'' the 54-year-old, middle-ranking cleric was quoted as
saying by the Islamic Republic News Agency.
   Rafsanjani, in remarks carried later by the news agency, also
said Tehran will work for the release of Western hostages if the
United States adopts a more friendly stance toward the Islamic
republic.
   The agency said he made the remarks during a meeting with Foreign
Minister Yaqoub Khan of Pakistan.
   ``We condemn hostage-taking and have many times declared this,
but we know that some of the people who resort to these things out
of innocence and because they have no other recourse, have no other
way to defend themselves,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani has emerged as Iran's new strongman following the June
3 death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, architect of the 1979
revolution that toppled the monarchy.
   Elected president in a landslide vote July 28, Rafsanjani is
viewed as eager to build ties with the West to gain technology and
financing to rebuild the country's economy, shattered after eight
years of war with Iraq.
   Rafsanjani succeeds Ali Khamenei, a Rafsanjani ally who was
picked to succeed Khomeini as Iran's spiritual leader.
   Khomeini's son, Ahmad, today rejected any possible relations
between Tehran and Washington. He also dismissed speculation that
Iranian authorities had been indirectly in contact with U.S.
officials to discuss the release of 16 Western hostages, including
eight Americans, held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   Tehran radio quoted Khomeini, 43, as saying Iranian officials
will ``punch America in the face, and they will kick America out of
the Middle East.''
   The younger Khomeini holds no official position in Iran. He has
aligned himself with the hard-line elements of the government, but
is more a symbol now that his role as his father's spokesman is gone.
   Rafsanjani made no mention of the hostages in his remarks during
today's ceremony. Previous reports indicated that he was sworn into
office on Aug. 3, but Iranian media subsequently characterized that
event as a religious ceremony confirming his victory.
   The former speaker of the Majlis, or parliament, said his first
goal in office would be to get the nation's factories working and,
in a veiled warning to his radical opponents, said a policy of
political autonomy was meaningless if the people are hungry.
   Rafsanjani acknowledged a fight was brewing over his Cabinet
appointments, with some current ministers refusing to serve in his
government.
   Rafsanjani did not specifically name the hard-line opposition
headed by former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who support
central control over the economy and keeping Islamic revolutionary
fervor sharp by challenging the West.
   ``We have a constitution, we make a pledge to implement it but
not just one aspect of it, like guarding our borders and political
independence. We must secure economic independence too,'' Rafsanjani
said.
   Iran's leaders have maintained a public front of unity since the
death of Khomeini.
   Speeches are tempered with references to following his
guidelines, but the tug of war expected after Khomeini's death is
emerging.
   ``I certainly do not intend to choose or reject this or that
person on political or factional grounds,'' Rafsanjani said.
   He said some current ministers had refused to join his
administration, but said he would try to make use of them in some
capacity.
   On Wednesday, parliament elected a radical, anti-Western cleric
to succeed Rafsanjani as speaker rather than his choice, former
Interior Minister Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
   Mehdi Karrubi, a 51-year-old middle ranking cleric and deputy
speaker under Rafsanjani, won 145 votes from the 243 deputies
present.
   Karrubi is allied to Rafsanjani's political rivals, led by
Mohtashemi, and outgoing Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, whose post
was scrapped in a constitutional reshuffle.
   Karrubi's brother, Hassan, was involved with Rafsanjani in secret
arms-for-hostages negotiations in 1985 with then-U.S. National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.

   A woman charged with murdering her
husband after he beat her detailed years of abuse during testimony
Thursday, then broke down as she recalled stabbing him and seeing
him covered with blood.
   ``I saw the blood coming from his ear, from his nose and his
mouth. Then I hugged him and kissed him. That's how I got blood all
over me,'' Donna Ordway said, sobbing loudly.
   Superior Court Judge Robert D. Krause called an early lunch
recesss so Mrs. Ordway could regain her composure.
   David Ordway was stabbed Feb. 7, 1987, in the couple's Glocester
home. Mrs. Ordway claimed self-defense. She could face life in
prison if convicted.
   Her first-degree murder trial is believed to be the first time
the battered-spouse defense has been used in Rhode Island.
Prosecutors contend her statements after the stabbing showed that
Mrs. Ordway planned the killing.
   Mrs. Ordway, 28, said the beatings began 1{ years before her June
1985 marriage to Ordway, a neighbor who had moved in with her.
   ``He'd backhand me, punch me, kick me, rip my clothes off.... .
In my head, my ribs, anywhere,'' she testified, sometimes crying and
dabbing her eyes with tissues.
   Mrs. Ordway recalled having her head smashed through a wall and
seeking medical treatment several times, at least once for a cracked
rib. The beatings occurred as often as three times a week after they
were married and would start after they had been drinking, or if her
husband had financial or work problems.
   Mrs. Ordway said her husband would beat her after telling her:
``I'm not a woman, that I'm not any good in bed. Things like that.''
   On the night of the killing friends came to the house from
another party, but Ordway became enraged and stomped out after his
wife asked one guest if she could have his puppy, Mrs. Ordway said.
   He returned, found her talking on the telephone with her mother
and began beating her and dragged her by the hair into the living
room, where he forced her to lie down, she said.
   Mrs. Ordway said she got up, but her husband had an ``enraged,
blank look in his eyes.''
   ``He had his hands out coming for me and I noticed the knife on
the TV and I said, `Stay away from me you s.o.b.' ... He said
nothing and just came after me and I stabbed him.''
   Mrs. Ordway said her husband fell but she thought he would attack
again until she saw the blood. Then she ran into the kitchen, threw
the knife in the sink and called an emergency squad, she said.
   Krause denied a defense motion to dismiss the charges, saying
there was ``ample evidence'' that Mrs. Ordway may have had malice.
   Witnesses have testified Mrs. Ordway told them she knew her
husband would be killed. Krause noted police testimony that Mrs.

   FBI agents say they raided two electronics
companies and confiscated up to 18,000 illegal devices for
unscrambling pay TV signals.
   Wednesday's seizure was the largest such haul in a series of
raids across the country aimed at cable TV piracy, an industry
official said.
   B &amp; B Inc. in Eagan and Lake Sylvan Sales in Burnsville, which
were selling the devices, are being investigated for possible
copyright and wire fraud violations, the FBI said. No arrests were
made Wednesday.
   The devices unscramble cable and satellite TV signals, allowing
viewers to receive broadcasts without paying for them.
   Dennis Sackreiter, Minneapolis FBI agent in charge of
white-collar crime investigations, said cable companies supply
converters that unscramble channels such as HBO and ESPN to TV
viewers who pay for those channels. The unscrambling is done by
patented and copyrighted computer chips.
   He said cable companies sell outdated converters to companies
such as Lake Sylvan and B &amp; B, which then update them, illegally.
   Some 10,000 to 15,000 descramblers were taken from Lake Sylvan
Sales and 2,000 to 3,000 were confiscated from B &amp; B, Sackreiter
said.
   Both companies denied any wrongdoing.
   ``We always have our customers sign a disclaimer waiver that says
they will not use this in any illegal manner,'' Lake Sylvan owner
Bill Donaldson said today. ``If it is used at all, they agree to
notify the cable companies and pay the fees.''
   ``It's not illegal to sell or buy the decoders,'' said B &amp; B
Manager Bill Shultheis. ``It's what people do with them afterwards
that may be illegal _ like a gun. We advertise in about 20
magazines. We have nothing to hide.''
   Cable TV operators have worked with the FBI for several years to
crack down on unauthorized suppliers of such equipment, and similar
raids have been conducted across the nation.
   Of those, Wednesday's haul was the largest, said Jim Allen,
director of the National Cable Television Association's office of
cable signal theft.

   An airport system designed to detect dangerous wind
shears helped three jetliners avoid a potentially catastrophic shear
last month, officials said.
   ``You can definitely say the system worked,'' John McCarthy,
director of wind-shear research for the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, said Wednesday.
   A wind shear is a sudden change of wind direction that creates a
powerful downburst of air. The gust can be strong enough to drive a
jetliner into the ground when it is landing or taking off.
   Powerful wind shears called microbursts have caused at least five
accidents that claimed more than 500 lives in the last 15 years,
including the l985 crash of a Delta Air Lines L-1011 that killed 137
people near Dallas.
   A microburst recorded at 95 knots, or 109 mph, was detected on
July 8 by Stapleton International Airport's Low-Level Wind Shear
Alert System, officials said. That was about 25 knots faster than
the microburst that downed the Delta jet.
   Three planes were approaching Stapleton when air-traffic
controllers alerted them to the probability of the wind shear,
Federal Aviation Admnistration spokesman Mitch Barker said. The
pilots, whose names and carriers were not identified, took evasive
action.
   ``The absence of the alert to the pilots could have been very
potentially catastrophic,'' McCarthy said.
   The crew of one of the aircraft said the microburst was so strong
that it slowed the jet by approximately 58 mph and caused it to drop
400 feet, to within 600 feet of the ground, McCarthy said.
   The wind shear, which lasted 10 minutes, was detected by a system
using 16 wind gauges spread over the airfield. Winds speed and
direction readings from the devices were automatically relayed to a
computer for analysis.
   Officials have been testing Doppler systems at Stapleton for
their ability to detect wind shear. Last November, the FAA awarded a
$180 million contract to Raytheon Co. to install such systems at 47
major airports across the country, beginning in the early 1990s.
   The Stapleton microburst is the strongest ever measured by a
machine, McCarthy said. But he added, ``We think microbursts can be
a lot stronger than this 95 knotter.''
   Scientists estimate microbursts can be as powerful as 200 knots.

   Pete Townshend of the Who suffered a minor
puncture wound to his right hand while doing his distinctive
windmill guitar strum.
   Townshend hit his hand Wednesday night on his guitar's whammy
bar, a handle that allows the musician to vary the pitch of an
electric guitar, during the song ``Won't Get Fooled Again.''
Townshend grimaced, set his guitar on the ground and walked off the
Tacoma Dome stage.
   The other band members checked up on Townshend, and lead singer
Roger Daltrey announced to the crowd that Townshend had been taken
by ambulance to St. Joseph Hospital in Tacoma.
   He was treated for cuts on his finger and palm and released.
   The group's next concert is scheduled Friday in Vancouver,
British Columbia. Dave Clarke, production coordinator for Perryscope
Productions, which is handling the Who's appearance there, said
Thursday that as far as he knows, that concert is still on.
   Because his hearing has been affected by loud music after years
of touring, Townshend has been playing mostly acoustic guitars on
his current tour.

   Gov. Robert P. Casey ran into a bit of
trouble a few weekends ago when he tried to buy a fishing license.
He couldn't prove he was a Pennsylvania resident.
   Casey told the tale at a recent builders' convention as a way of
demonstrating that you're never as big a fish as you might think.
The tale was recounted this week by The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   It happened in Hamlin, population 300, in rural Wayne County,
while the governor was taking a few days off at his vacation home at
Lake Ariel. Casey was chauffeured and escorted by a state police
trooper, and wasn't carrying any identification.
   The governor, dressed in shorts and a golf shirt, filled out an
application and handed it to the clerk. Then, according to Casey,
came the following exchange:
   ``She looks at me and says, `Are you a Pennsylvania resident?'''
   ``And I just deadpanned. I said, `Yes, I'm a Pennsylvania
resident.'''
   ``She says, `You got a driver's license?' ''
   ``I said no.''
   ``You got a voter's card?''
   ``No.''
   ``You got the certificate of title to your car?''
   ``No.''
   ``She said, `Where do you live?'''
   ``And I said, `I live in Scranton, I got a place in Lake Ariel
and I'm a Pennsylvania resident.' ''
   Finally, a trooper with Casey came to the governor's rescue and
vouched for him, the newspaper reported. The clerk finally approved
the application, telling the governor, ``I'm going to make an
exception in your case.''

   Actress Joanne Woodward says she might have been
a bigger star if she hadn't put her marriage to actor Paul Newman
ahead of her career.
   In an interview in Lear's magazine, Ms. Woodward, 59, said she
was raised in Georgia ``to believe that a woman should be both wife
and mistress to her husband, and only in that could she find her
true fulfillment.''
   She married Newman just as her movie career was taking off. ``I
would have liked to be a major star,'' she said. ``If I hadn't been
torn in my desires, I might have attained both'' stardom and a happy
marriage.
   ``But I never felt I had the option,'' she added.
   She said she always ``felt an enormous rivalry with Paul ...
because he was living my fantasy, being what I had always wanted to
be: a star.''
   Ms. Woodward, who has three daughters with Newman, still puts her
marriage ahead of other activities. She's been pursuing a bachelor's
degree at Sarah Lawrence College on and off for 17 years, and failed
to graduate last spring in part because ``Paul was working on a film
down in Louisiana and he asked me to join him because he missed
me,'' she said.
   ``There's no academic degree in this world that can compare in
importance to the fact that the person you've loved for 31 years is
missing you,'' she said.

   Country singer Charlie Daniels made a visit here
to support Vietnam War veterans who are staging a vigil in a bamboo
and wire cage to call attention to American soldiers still missing
in southeast Asia.
   Daniels visited the cage outside the city's lakefront War
Memorial Center on Wednesday and led people gathered at the site in
a brief prayer.
   ``I pray for those soldiers who have come back and those who are
still missing,'' Daniels said. ``I ask that proof be gathered and
action be taken to bring them home.''
   Some activists believe that some of the 2,400 Americans listed as
missing in action in Southeast Asia are in fact alive and being held
prisoner. U.S. officials say there is no proof that any of the
missing soldiers are alive, although they don't rule the possibility
out entirely.
   ``There are still people in southeast Asia,'' Daniels said.
``They are fighting men that we have left. It's a disgrace.''
   Members of Wisconsin Vietnam Veterans are taking turns spending
time inside the cage to raise awareness. The vigil began Aug. 10 and
will end 37 days later on National POW-MIA Day on Sept. 15.
   Daniels, known for hits such as ``The Devil Went Down To
Georgia,'' took a few minutes to crawl inside the cage and talk with
a veteran who had been taking part in the vigil.

   A 19-year-old engineering student has
discovered a supernova, or exploding star, in a spiral galaxy more
than 137 million light-years from Earth, the California Institute of
Technology announced Thursday.
   Celina Mikolajczak, of San Diego, made the discovery while
examining photographic films taken on the 18-inch Schmidt telescope
at Palomar Observatory, northeast of San Diego.
   Caltech spokesman Robert Finn said Mikolajczak was looking for
comets and asteroids as part of a summer program in which
undergraduates conduct research under faculty supervision.
   ``My first thought was that it was a speck of dust,'' said
Mikolajczak, who then examined more film and realized, ``Wow, I
think I've found something.''
   The discovery was confirmed with the help of Mikolajczak's
faculty sponsor, Eleanor Helin, a planetary scientist at Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech operates under contract to NASA.
   The supernova, designated SN 1989N, is the 14th discovered this
year and is much too dim to be seen by the naked eye. It is in the
eastern part of the constellation Leo, within a large spiral galaxy
named NGC 3646 located 137 million light-years _ or 806 quintillion
miles _ from Earth. A light year is equal to the distance light
travels in a year, about 5.88 trillion miles.
   Fifteen to 20 supernovas are discovered during a typical year; 27
were found in 1988.

   Iran wants to buy 1 million yards of black
cloth from Oman to make women's veils because the Islamic republic's
factories cannot produce enough of the material, an Iranian Embassy
spokesman said Thursday.
   The move to import the cloth follows five days of talks with
Omani officials, who visited Tehran last week for the first time
since the cease-fire a year ago in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   The state-controlled Oman Observer daily newspaper quoted a
senior Omani government official as saying the Iranians expressed
``a strong desire'' to import black cloth from Oman's sole cloth
manufacturing unit, the Oman Textile Mills Co.
   They also explored the possibility of joint procurement of raw
materials and Iran utilizing Oman's production facilities.
   Oman is one of the regional Arab states that maintained friendly
ties with Iran during the war.

<HEAD>Newark, N.J., Agrees To Scale Back Plans To Demolish Public Housing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Newark housing authorities today agreed to
scale back drastically the amount of public housing to be demolished
under a slum clearance plan and committed themselves to replacing
the razed apartments.
   The agreement beween the Newark Housing Authority and housing
activists was announced by U.S. District Judge Dickinson R.
Debevoise.
   The agreement provides for the demolition of eight apartment
buildings containing about 1,900 units. To make up for those lost
apartments, 1,500 new apartments will be built and hundreds of
others will be renovated.
   In addition, tenants in buildings being demolished will be given
a place immediately in a new building or a renovated apartment.
   Previously, the housing authority planned to raze 39 buildings
with about 5,700 units in the biggest demolition of public housing
by an American city. The program is aimed at getting rid of what
critics call ``high-rise slums.''
   But opponents of the plan wanted assurances that the demolished
apartments would be replaced.
   Debevoise said that without the settlement, the city would have
lost about $100 million in federal funds previously approved for
replacement housing.
   ``In this case, there is no loser,'' the judge said.
   Many cities have destroyed or plan to demolish some of their
aging high-rise public projects, saying they are unmanageable and
dangerous and should be replaced by townhouses and low-rise
buildings.
   Harris David, an attorney for tenants in a lawsuit against the
Newark plan, said, ``My clients are extremely pleased. They consider
it a substantial victory for poor people and the cause of low-income
housing in the city.''
   The Newark authority, the nation's eighth-largest, controls
13,000 apartments and has a waiting list of 10,000 families. Nearly
40 percent of the apartments are vacant, many awaiting demolition.
More than 800 units have already been razed.
   One-third of the city's more than 300,000 residents receive
public assistance.
   Daniel Blue Jr., executive director of the housing authority,
said the first demolition probably won't begin until 1990.

   Soldiers loyal to China's president detained the
defense minister and several commanders in a dispute over a top
military post vacated by Zhao Ziyang, the purged Communist Party
boss, Chinese sources said Thursday.
   They said President Yang Shangkun, a central figure in the
martial law crackdown on the student-led pro-democracy movement,
apparently ordered the action to strengthen his control of the
Chinese military.
   In Beijing, government spokesman Yuan Mu confirmed reports that
student leader Wang Dan had been arrested and said Zhao, who has not
been seen in public since May 18, was leading a ``completely normal
life.''
   A Shanghai newspaper said authorities arrested or were
investigating 99 people accused of involvement in illegal workers'
groups that plotted to establish a ``people's party'' and kidnap
officials. The Shanghai Liberation Daily said The groups planned to
overthrow the government.
   Staff members of the Guangming Daily, the Communist Party's
leading newspaper for intellectuals, said senior editor Yao Xihua,
61, had been ``asked to retire.''
   He appeared to be the latest victim of a purge in which at least
10 intellectuals have been dismissed from colleges and research
centers and an outspoken columnist for the paper, Dai Qing, was
arrested for supporting pro-democracy protests.
   In the military power struggle, soldiers loyal to Yang went to
the Beijing residence of Defense Minister Qin Jiwei about 6:40 p.m.
Wednesday and took him and one of his armed guards away, the sources
said.
   Other troopers detained the heads of the Beijing, Guangzhou and
Nanjing military districts, who supported Qin and were in Beijing
for an important meeting, they said.
   Control of the military is essential in high-level Chinese
politics. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping's only official post is
chairman of the Central Military Commission, China's top military
body.
   Qin and Yang have been competing to become first vice chairman of
the commission, left vacant by Zhao's dismissal June 24.
   One source said the soldiers were from the Garrison Headquarters
of Beijing, a special force that protects military and political
leaders and is directed by President Yang.
   The sources said they believed Qin and the others went
unwillingly, but did not say they were kidnapped or arrested. They
said they did not know the men's whereabouts.
   No confirmation of the reports was possible, but the sources
contacted The Associated Press separately. One is a military officer
who telephoned Thursday morning from Beijing and the other is a
businessman, based in Hong Kong, who says he has extensive contacts
within the Chinese military.
   Zhao was purged because of he allegedly supported student
demonstrations for sweeping political change in China, which ended
with the bloody military crackdown of June 3-4.
   Chinese sources had said earlier that Qin was against imposing
martial law in Beijing and the use of force to clear Tiananmen
Square.
   According to the sources, Qin and several commanders met with
former Defense Minister Zhang Aiping and Yang Dezhi, former army
chief of staff, on Aug. 8 to discuss Qin's possible appointment to
Zhao's former military post.
   Among the officials accompanying Qin were Zhou Yibing, commander
of the Beijing military area; Xiang Shouzhi, commander of the
Nanjing area, and Zhang Wannian, the Guangzhou commander, they said.
   Zhang Aiping and Yang Dezhi, who opposed a violent crackdown on
the democracy movement in a letter written in late May, expressed
support for Qin, the sources reported.
   The Central Military Commission met the next day to choose a
first vice chairman, but took no action because Qin and Yang argued
and Qin walked out, one of the sources said.
   Both said the meeting was adjourned until this week, but that
Wednesday's developments had placed it in doubt.
   Yuan, the Chinese government spokesman, said Wang, a 20-year-old
Beijing University student who helped lead the pro-democracy
movement, was arrested July 2 after meeting with a Taiwanese
reporter who was detained and later expelled.
   An interview published Wednesday in the Japanese newspaper
Yomiuri quoted him as saying the Communist Party continued
investigating links between the demonstrators and Zhao.
   ``If it is determined that (Zhao) took part in the turmoil or had
a role in planning and leading it, it will cease to be an internal
party matter, but I am not saying it will definitely lead to
criminal proceedings,'' he said.
   Yuan said without elaboration that Zhao and Hu Qili, another
moderate party leader also purged for opposing the army crackdown,
were leading normal lives.
   China will not use force to ``pry'' dissident astrophysicist Fang
and his wife from their refuge in the U.S. Embassy, he said, but
they will not be allowed to leave the country even for a third
``neutral'' nation.
   He said resolution of the diplomatic standoff ``lies with the
U.S. government. ... Whoever started the trouble should end it.''

   AIDS has reached a new milestone in the United
States, with more than 100,000 cases of the deadly disease reported,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   Through July, 102,621 cases of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome were reported in the United States, the CDC said this week.
A total of 59,391, or 58 percent, of those patients have died.
   As scientists have noted since AIDS was discovered in 1981, the
case count is growing at a faster pace as the disease spreads. The
first 50,000 AIDS cases in the United States were reported from 1981
to late 1987, but the next 50,000 were reported from December 1987
to July 1989.
   U.S. health officials estimate 1 million to 1.5 million Americans
are infected with HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, which causes
AIDS. A study among homosexual or bisexual males _ the largest risk
group for AIDS _ suggests that up to 99 percent of those infected
will eventually develop the disease.
   AIDS continues to occur increasingly among abusers of injectable
drugs. In the first six months of 1989, 23 percent of reported AIDS
patients were female or heterosexual male users of intravenous
drugs, compared with 18 percent among the cases reported before
1985, the CDC said.
   Fifty-six percent of the cases reported in the first half of this
year were among homosexual or bisexual males, compared with 63
percent prior to 1985.
   Overall, homosexual or bisexual men make up 60 percent of the
102,621 reported AIDS cases. Twenty percent are intravenous drug
abusers, and 7 percent are both. Four percent of AIDS cases are
blamed on heterosexual contact.
   The virus that causes AIDS damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.

   Authorities have restricted fruit and vegetable
shipments from a 70-square-mile area around Dodger Stadium to keep
Mediterranean fruit flies confined to the Los Angeles area, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Larry B. Slagle, acting administrator of the department's Animal
and Health Inspection Service, said the quarantine and other
measures were ordered following the discovery in the last three
weeks of 40 adult Medflies and 40 larvae in a three-mile-square area
of the county.
   The quarantine ``restricts the movement of all fruits and
vegetables leaving the area,'' he said.
   Medflies are considered among the most destructive pests of
fruits and vegetables. Females lay eggs inside ripe fruit and
vegetables, and the developing larvae feed on the pulp, destroying
their commercial and nutritive values, Slagle said.
   An aerial drop of sexually sterile Medflies is scheduled to begin
Aug. 21.
   ``By releasing large numbers of sterile flies, we eliminate the
possibility of two fertile Medflies mating, so the pest literally
breeds itself out of existence,'' Slagle said.

<HEAD>Communist Party Offers to Change Structure of Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party on Thursday opened the
possibility of radical change in the Soviet Union's structure by
offering new powers to the republics and a possible rewrite of the
agreement that united them.
   The party leadership tendered the proposal published in its
newspaper, Pravda, as its solution to the ethnic conflicts that
threaten to rip apart the Soviet Union. More than 200 people have
died in ethnic strife in the past 18 months, and groups in several
of the 15 republics are calling for secession.
   In its proposals, the party offers no specific solutions to stem
the ethnic hatred that has led to clashes involving Armenians,
Azerbaijanis, Abkhazians, Georgians, Turks, Uzbeks and others. Some
activists welcomed the party's attempt to compromise, but said vague
promises of decentralization are no longer enough to solve ``the
nationalities question.''
   ``The only solution is for the republics to be absolutely free,''
said Nodar Notadze, head of the People's Front in Georgia.
   The draft policy also calls for a law banning ``nationalist and
chauvinist'' organizations, which could be used against groups
demanding independence from Moscow.
   The greatest concession offers the republics the power to
question national laws before a strengthened high court.
   That clause appeared to be aimed at Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, which have amended their constitutions to proclaim their
right to reject national laws. The Kremlin previously said this
violated the Soviet Constitution.
   Thursday's document said that to achieve a transformation of the
Soviet federation, ``the question has been raised of working out and
signing a new union agreement instead of the Treaty on the Formation
of the U.S.S.R. of 1922.''
   That could be limited to the party's suggestion of expanded
powers for republics. But it opens the possibility that radicals
could push through radical change such as Andrei D. Sakharov's
suggested loose confederation of sovereign states, or even the
breakup of the union into independent states.
   The 1922 treaty created the U.S.S.R. as a union of allegedly
sovereign republics which were in reality dominated by the Kremlin
in Moscow.
   Estonian activists originally suggested rewriting the treaty of
union in November, when they made world headlines by becoming the
first of the Baltics to declare their republic ``sovereign'' within
the framework of the Soviet Union.
   By Thursday, however, Baltic activists were no longer excited by
the possibility.
   ``We don't want a new agreement,'' said Aigar Irgens, an editor
at Atmoda, the newspaper of the Latvian Popular Front. ``We want
complete independence.''
   ``They are trying to present to the world that we in the Soviet
Union now have a federation built on the will of the people,'' said
Alvydas Juozaitis of the Lithuanian popular front, Sajudis. That is
impossible as long as the Red Army ``occupies'' the republic, he
said.
   Sajudis, which swept parliamentary elections in Lithuania in the
spring and openly advocates independence, is ``not prepared to sign
a new agreement with the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union
renounces our occupation,'' Juozaitis said.
   The draft, approved by the ruling party Politburo, is expected to
be discussed in the party central committees of the republics prior
to the meeting of the 250-member national Central Committee next
month in Moscow.
   The document indicates the party leadership still favors a strong
central government, despite its willingness to transfer certain
powers to the republics.
   For example, it says the republics ``can raise the question'' of
canceling national laws they believe exceed the authority of the
central government. But it claims for the Moscow-based government
the far stronger power to veto unconstitutional laws passed in the
republics.
   The party suggests that such disputes be settled by the
Constitutional Control Commission, a quasi-Supreme Court that was
created last year.
   The party's call for a new law banning ``nationalist and
chauvinist organizations'' could be targeted at pro-secession groups
such as the Party of National Independence in Georgia, Russian
strikers protesting a new language law in Estonia, or the
mass-membership Estonian Popular Front, which supported the language
law.
   ``We have nationalist groups in Latvia, but the term is very
broad,'' Irgens said. The effect of the party's proposed ban, he
said, would depend on the definition of nationalist.
   The draft includes the promise to ``give to the republics all
rights related to their status as sovereign socialist states,'' and
says they are empowered to solve problems except in those areas
where they give control to the national government.
   The Soviet Constitution is contradictory on this point, promising
sovereignty to the republics but simultaneously claiming that
national law is superior. The proposed policy does not clear up some
of that fuzziness.
   It grants the republics' demand for the right to use and
distribute their land and natural resources. But it also reserves to
the national government the right to determine the ``all-union
basis'' of how resources should be used.
   The division of economic power is similarly vague.
   In hopes of calming national conflicts, the document calls for a
new law guaranteeing the rights of citizens living outside their
national boundaries. It also calls for creation of a new government
entity to handle ethnic relations, and local councils for
minorities, with the right to self-government.

   President Bush surrounded himself
with children and grandchildren Thursday as he began the first full
day of his 2{-week summer vacation with a cherished activity: a fast
boat ride.
   The president, who planned few public appearances during a
seaside vacation scheduled to last through Labor Day, spent several
hours crashing through Atlantic waves in his speedboat,
``Fidelity,'' with two of his sons, George W. Bush of Dallas and
Neil Bush of Denver.
   By the weekend, all of the first family's five children and 11
grandchildren were to have gathered at Walker's Point, Bush's
11-acre coastal vacation compound.
   It was the largest gathering of the Bush clan since the
president's inauguration in January.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, briefing 50 or so
Washington reporters who accompanied Bush here, said the president
planned few meetings during his stay.
   He was briefed Thursday on developents in Poland and ``went
through the newspapers and some other documents before going on the
boating trip'' Thursday, Fitzwater said.

<TEXT>
   The government is ending part of its trial for
the AIDS drug AZT because the study found it significantly slowed
the progress of the deadly disease in certain patients, the
Department of Health and Human Services announced today.
   AZT, also known as zidovudine, was being given to participants in
the drug trial whose blood tested positive for the AIDS virus but
whose disease progression was in a very early stage.
   Patients in the study were those who had blood tests of fewer
than 500 T4 blood cells per cubic millimeter. Half of those in the
study received AZT and the others received placebo.
   HHS announced that a data and safety monitoring board ``found
that those participants with fewer T4 cells who received zidovudine,
the rate of progression to AIDS or severe ARC (AIDS-related complex)
was roughly half that of participants ... who received placebo.''
   The announcement said that all patients in the trial will now
receive AZT. The study continues for patients whose T4 cell count is
above 500.
   The drug trial involved more than 3,200 volunteers. The trial was
begun two years ago and was conducted in 32 locations. The
announcement follows by two weeks a report that shows AZT slowed
progression of the disease in persons with early AIDS-related
complex.
   About 1,300 of the participants had fewer than 500 T4 cells at
the beginning.
   ``These results provide real hope for the millions of people
worldwide who are infected'' with the AIDS virus, HHS Secretary
Lewis W. Sullivan said in prepared remarks.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases which was in charge of the study,
said the results have ``clearly demonstrated that early treatment
with zidovudine can slow disease progression without significant
side effects (in AIDS patients) with fewer than 500 T4 cells who do
not yet have symptoms.''
   AZT is currently the only anti-viral drug approved to combat
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

   Pope John Paul II will make his third trip
in seven years this weekend to Spain, a former bastion of Roman
Catholicism that is becoming increasingly secular.
   Some observers say the visit to the northwestern cities of
Santiago de Compostela, Oviedo and the Covadonga mountain shrine _
all important sites of early Christian Spain _ is an effort to stem
the secularization and a dramatic decline in church attendance.
   A limited abortion law and another giving the state effective
control over religious schools, both passed by the Socialist
government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, took effect in 1985
after the pope's 10-day trip in 1982 and a shorter visit to the
Virgin of Pilar shrine in Zaragoza in 1984.
   Divorce was made legal in 1981, six years after the death of
dictator Francisco Franco, under whose regime Roman Catholicism was
the state religion and the church the arbiter of public and private
morality.
   In July, the Justice Ministry declared Islam, under whose banner
Moorish warriors destroyed Santiago de Compostela in 997, a religion
of ``recognized foothold'' in Spain, making Moslem establishments
eligible for tax-exempt status. Similar decrees already had been
issued for Protestants and Jews.
   The highlight of John Paul's trip will be the fourth
Vatican-sponsored World Youth Day, expected to attract 300,000 young
people from 60 countries to Santiago on Saturday, when the three-day
visit begins.
   Monsignor Peter Coughlan, undersecretary of the Vatican's Council
for the Laity, said the purpose was to demonstrate church's emphasis
on youth and evangelization. His agency organized the event.
   Polls indicate half the Spaniards under age 25 believe in God.
Polls in the archbishopric of Oviedo, which the pope will visit
Sunday, say 22 percent of those aged 18-30 call themselves
practicing Catholics.
   A study by the archbishop's office said only 17.6 percent of the
1.1 million inhabitants of Asturias, of which Oviedo is the capital,
considered themselves active church members.
   Advance press coverage has focused on the financing of the visit
and the use of public funds to pay for the estimated 5,000 police
needed to keep order and guard John Paul.
   Although the visit is not official, the pontiff will meet with
both King Juan Carlos and Gonzalez, the prime minister.
   Cardinal Angel Suquia, archbishop of Madrid and head of Spanish
Conference of Bishops, acknowledged problems with ``who is to pay
what for what.''
   The bishops have not said what the papal visit will cost, but
Gabino Diaz Merchan, archbishop of Oviedo, told the state radio the
church was spending $300,000 on the visit to his diocese.
   Nueva Espana, an Oviego daily, said the Asturias government
contributed part of the $165,000 needed to refurbish the Covadonga
shrine.
   Cavadonga, in the Picos de Europa mountain range 50 miles
southeast of Oviedo, houses the 18th century statue of the Virgin of
the Battlefield or ``Santina,'' patron of Asturias.
   Galicia, of which Santiago is the capital, is providing $1.65
million to help pay for the visit and accommodations for the young
visitors, said David Cheda, provincial government spokesman.
   He said the government hoped to recover 40 percent of it from
fees to food and soft drink concessionaires.
   Archbishop Antonio Maria Rouco Varela of Santiago said John
Paul's visit was ``of decisive importance for the church,'' but did
not say how much his archbishopric was spending on it.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Pakistanis
marched for miles Thursday to Faisal Mosque to mourn President Mohqa
laid down his life for Pakistan'' fluttered from light poles along
the avenue leading to the huge mosque.
   Vendors hawked Zia posters, along with ice cream.
   Zia ruled Pakistan for 11 years, eight of them under martial law.
His death in a mysterious plane crash Aug. 17, 1988, paved the way
for the country's first free elections in more than a decade.
   Ms. Benazir Bhutto's party won control of the National Assembly
in the November vote.
   Organizers had said the first anniversary of Zia's death would be
used as a rally to show the strength of those opposed to Ms. Bhutto,
the prime minister. Pakistani TV estimated the crowd Thursday at
70,000 and said it biggest anti-Bhutto showing ever.
   ``It was a referendum in our favor,'' said Ms. Bhutto's main
rival, Nawaz Sharif, who heads a nine-party conservative alliance
that controls Punjab, Pakistan's largest province.
   Zia's son, Ijaz ul-Haq, led a late afternoon prayer service at
Zia's marble sarcophagus, shaded under a gazebo on the mosque's lawn.
   ``It was a religious service but it was also an approval of the
policies of my father,'' Ijaz, 38, said.
   Zia, U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others died in the
crash of Zia's presidential plane. Investigators said it appeared to
be sabotage but they did not say who was responsible.
   Ijaz claims Ms. Bhutto was behind the crash and that her Pakistan
People's Party is trying to cover it up.
   Many Pakistani observers believe Zia's death was the work of
foreign agents. Pakistani officials have blamed hundreds of
terrorist bombings in Pakistan on Soviet-trained agents of
neighboring Afghanistan's communist government. Zia was a staunch
supporter of Afghan rebels fighting to topple it.
   Hundreds of policemen and federal officers were called into
Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, to keep order for Thursday's
rally, but there were no reports of violence.
   The government appealed to Ms. Bhutto's supporters not to hold
counter-rallies that might provoke violence.

<TEXT>
   Syrians and Christians traded shellfire
Thursday, but it was a relative lull in the 5-month-old artillery
war and people emerged from shelters to replenish food stocks in
case fierce exchanges resumed.
   The devastating artillery and rocket barrages that have ravaged
the city abated soon after the U.N. Security Council passed a
cease-fire resolution Tuesday night in New York, but residents of
Beirut feared the lull would not last.
   In Washington, the State Department urged ``all parties to accept
and observe the cease-fire immediately,'' said spokesman Rihard
Boucher.
   Police said shells landed in Beirut's Moslem and Christian
sectors and along the Christian-held coast north of the city,
killing a 7-year-old girl and wounding three people.
   France said it was sending the aircraft carrier Foch on a
possible evacuation mission to join the destroyer Duquesne, which
was dispatched Tuesday ``to aid the French community.'' Lebanon was
a French mandate until 1943 and about 7,000 French citizens live in
the country, 85 percent of them with dual nationality.
   A spokesman for Makassed hospital in Moslem west Beirut said
4-day-old Aziza Qobaissi, delivered by Caesarian section after her
mother was killed by shrapnel Monday, had died in an incubator.
   ``We are trying to locate her father, Hussein Qobaissi, to inform
him of the death, but it seems he is not in Beirut,'' the spokesman
said.
   All but 150,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million people have left since
the battle began March 8 between Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army
units and a Moslem alliance led by Syrian soldiers stationed in
Lebanon. Total casualties by police count, nearly all civilians, as
776 killed and 2,076 wounded.
   A police spokesman said shelling Thursday was ``at a much lesser
scale than during the ferocious duels that preceded the cease-fire
call.''
   People went out to to buy food and drinking water, expecting
further violence.
   ``What cease-fire?'' Fatima Hamdan asked, arguing with a
vegetable vendor over the price of a 50-pound sack of potatoes.
   ``I'm buying this quantity for me and my daughter because I'm
sure they are going to fight heavily again,'' said Mrs. Hamdan, a
Shiite Moslem. ``One doesn't need refrigerators to keep potatoes.''
   Ahmad Omeirat, the vendor, said most customers were ``buying
large quantities. ... They want to have something to eat in the bad
days.''
   Banks opened for one hour. Ibrahim Masry, a bank employee in west
Beirut, said: ``They all want cash. ... It seems nobody trusts the
cease-fire.''
   A spokesman for Aoun said the 54-year-old Maronite Catholic
general ``welcomed the U.N. Security council resolution as a whole,
not just the cease-fire.''
   ``The resolution involves a cease-fire, lifting of blockades and
programming the Syrian military withdrawal from Lebanon,'' said the
spokesman, who would not let his name be used.
   An alliance of leftist and Moslem militias supported by Syria and
Iran announced ``conditional approval'' of the resolution.
   A statement from the Nationalist Front released in Damascus, the
Syrian capital, said it ``accepts the call for a cease-fire provided
that an inter-Lebanese committee be formed to monitor the Lebanese
coast and prevent the delivery of arms shipments to Aoun.''
   In Iraq, Syria's enemy and Aoun's arms supplier, the government
daily Baghdad Observer urged Arab countries to force Syria out of
Lebanon. Syria has 40,000 soldiers in the country under an Arab
League mandate issued in 1976, the year after the the sectarian
civil war began.
   ``Tell the Syrians to leave,'' the paper said. ``The situation in
Lebanon has reached a point where courteous diplomatic words are no
longer valid to bring about an end to the Beirut carnage.''
   Aoun, who has 20,000 men, calls the Syrians an occupation army
and has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out.
   His spokesman rejected the idea of an inter-Lebanese committee.
``Our war hasn't been with Lebanese factions,'' the spokesman said.
``We've been fighting the Syrians for more than five months and now
they want to forge facts and say the conflict is between Lebanese
groups.''
   The cease-fire will ``face a major test when any ship tries to
dock at our ports,'' he said. ``If they shell it, we'll certainly
respond.''
   Nabih Berri, leader of the Syrian-backed Shiite militia Amal, was
quoted by the London-based Mideast Mirror newsletter as saying the
truce was ``unacceptable so long as the sea lanes remain without
control _ all Lebanese sea lanes, not just the shores of the eastern
(Christian) sector.''
   Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt, Syria's closest ally in the
Nationalist Front, rejected the cease-fire altogether. ``Either Aoun
goes or it is war to the end,'' he said.
   Jumblatt's militia started the shooting two days after Aoun
blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias, which deprive
the government of about $100 million a year in customs revenue.
   The general and Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who is acting premier,
have led competing cabinets since a government crisis in last year
that also split the army. Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib leads the 22,000
Moslem soldiers, who are poorly equipped and have stayed out of the
fighting.

   President Wojciech Jaruzelski will choose a
Solidarity member to lead Poland's next government, a lawmaker said
Thursday, a move that would end four decades of Communist domination.
   The stunning development came during a historic meeting between
Jaruzelski and Lech Walesa, whose Solidarity labor movement was
crushed by Jaruzelski eight years ago but which has now become
Poland's most potent political force.
   Solidarity lawmaker Jacek Kuron said Jaruzelski accepted ``in
principle'' Walesa's offer to form a government led by
non-Communists. Such a government would be unprecedented in the
Soviet bloc.
   ``I am satisfied,'' Walesa said after the meeting.
   Even in a government led by Solidarity, however, Jaruzelski would
remain president, controlling the army and foreign affairs; local
governments would still be in the hands of the Communist Party; and
party members would still control the courts. In addition, tens of
thousands of Poland's bureaucrats owe their jobs to the party, and
75 percent of management jobs _ ranging from shop managers to
factory heads _ are held by party members.
   The possibility of a non-communist government in Warsaw has
alarmed the Soviet Union, Poland's superpower neighbor and ally, but
the Soviets have always stressed that political changes in Poland
were an internal affair. In addition, Walesa has said that the
interior and defense ministries would remain in communist hands.
   After the meeting between Walesa and Jaruzelski, state-run media
announced that Communist Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak formally
turned in his resignation to Jaruzelski, apparently as a prelude to
the formation of a new government.
   Kiszczak, who has been in office only since Aug. 2, had said
earlier this week he would resign because the Solidarity-led
opposition in parliament fought his efforts to form a coalition
government.
   Walesa, a Gdansk shipyard electrician who built his labor
movement as Poland slid into an economic morass, has said he does
not want to become prime minister.
   Jaruzelski, as president, must nominate a prime minister and
present him for approval to the Sejm, the lower house of the
National Assembly. Solidarity and two minor parties that are allied
with it form a majority in that chamber.
   Kuron said he is among three Solidarity candidates the coalition
has offered for prime minister. Kuron, a activist in the Polish
opposition for more than 20 years, spent nine years in prison for
anti-government activities.
   Also to be considered are Solidarity parliamentary leader
Bronislaw Geremek, a historian; and Tadeusz Mazowiecki, editor of
the union's weekly newspaper Tygodnik Solidarnosc.
   Jaruzelski ``said he will grant nomination (as prime minister) to
one of the Solidarity candidates in the nearest future,'' Kuron told
a gathering of Solidarity lawmakers.
   Walesa has said any Solidarity-led government would appoint
Communist Party members to lead the ministries of defense and
interior, which control the army and police. This appeared to be a
move to allay Soviet fears about a fissure in the Warsaw Pact
military alliance.
   Solidarity was the East bloc's first independent trade union when
it was formed in 1980 by Walesa.
   It was legal for 16 months and its membership ballooned to 10
million until Dec. 13, 1981, when Jaruzelski declared martial law
and jailed thousands of members, including Walesa. Solidarity was
outlawed the following year.
   A series of strikes caused by Poland's collapsing economy last
year forced officials to seek a conciliation with the union,
resulting in a historic accord reached in April that allowed limited
opposition participation in elections and the legalization of
Solidarity.
   The trade union and its allied candidates dominated the elections
in the Sejm and the newly formed Senate. Under the accord, the
Communists were guaranteed a narrow majority in the National
Assembly.
   But the defection this week of two minor parties typically
associated with the Communists, the United Peasant and the
Democratic parties, swung the balance of power to Solidarity.
   Jaruzelski was to make an announcement on the meeting Friday and
both government and opposition figures were vague on details.
   Jaruzelski, agreed to the basic concept of the plan, said Jerzy
Jozwiak, leader of the Solidarity-allied Democratic Party who
attended the meeting. ``The concept has been approved by the
president,'' he said.
   An official communique issued after the meeting said Jaruzelski
would work for the ``quickest possible appointment'' of a government
such as proposed by Walesa.
   ``Lech Walesa presented the concept of establishing a coalition
government of national responsibility with the participation of all
pro-reformatory political forces represented at the Sejm,'' said the
communique carried on the state PAP news agency.
   ``Jaruzelski ... declared that he will urgently consider the
presented propositions and conduct appropriate consultations aiming
at the quickest possible appointment of such a government in the
interest of the nation,'' it said.
   Walesa and Jozwiak expressed satisfaction with the outcome but
were vague about details, apparently not wishing to speak until
Jaruzelski issued his written decision Friday.
   Jozwiak said the outcome was ``favorable for the nation and the
state.''
   After the meeting, Walesa went to see the leader of Poland's
Roman Catholic Church, Cardinal Jozef Glemp.
   Asked if the coalition leaders were close to a new government, he
added ``closer than farther.''
   Asked if the president favored a government such as the coalition
had suggested, Walesa replied: ``What Poland needs is agreement, a
government of reforms. Everybody is in favor of that. So it is only
a technical matter.''
   President Bush was monitoring the developments in Poland and the
White House said the ``sensitive situation'' was a positive
development.
   ``We do encourage and support the process of pluralism, and it
appears that is the general direction that they are aimed,'' in
Poland, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters who
accompanied the president to Maine.
   ``Certainly a non-Communist government would be a remarkable and
history-making occurrence,'' he added.
   There was no immediate comment from the Soviet Union. The Soviet
TV news program ``Vremya'' on Thursday night showed a report that
had been shot before the meeting with Jaruzelski, painting a picture
of constant strikes, chronic food shortages and political turmoil.
An announcer read a dispatch saying Walesa had offered to form a
government.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $8.17 billion
in June, the smallest monthly imbalance since December 1984, the
government said Thursday in a report viewed by many economists as
only a short-lived improvement.
   The Commerce Department said the June deficit showed a dramatic
18.9 percent narrowing from a revised May figure of $10.08 billion,
reflecting record U.S. export sales and a drop in imports.
   The June report, which was significantly better than had been
expected, was hailed by the Bush administration as evidence that
American manufacturers were enjoying continued success in
penetrating foreign markets.
   ``The decline (in the trade deficit) was greater than market
expectation and certainly is good news for the country,''
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The June improvement came from a 1.5 percent increase in U.S.
exports, which pushed them to a record level of $30.91 billion, and
a 3.6 percent drop in imports, which fell to $39.08 billion.
   Private forecasters were decidedly less enthusiastic than the
administration, with some contending that the June deficit figure
was likely to be the best trade news America would get for some time.
   They predicted that the deficit would widen in coming months
under the impact of a stronger dollar, which makes U.S. products
more expensive on overseas markets.
   The stock and bond markets also reacted negatively to the report,
which was interpreted as showing that economic growth was stronger
than previously believed. While such a development eases recession
fears, it also diminishes hopes that the Federal Reserve will move
to lower interest rates further.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the
unexpectedly sharp improvement in the June trade figure and other
recent good economic news would probably result in a big upward
revision in the government's estimate of overall economic growth for
the April-June quarter.
   The overall economy, as measured by the gross national product,
was originally shown growing at a very weak 1.7 percent annual rate
in the second quarter. Steinberg said that figure would likely be
revised upward to around 2.5 percent, reflecting not only better
news on trade but also upturns in industrial production and retail
sales.
   ``During the period when the Fed was easing monetary policy in
the second quarter, the economy was not nearly as weak as the
central bank thought it was,'' he said.
   For the first six months of the year, the trade deficit was
running at an annual rate of $108.6 billion, down 8.4 percent from
last year's total merchandise trade deficit of $118.5 billion.
   But many economists believe the monthly deficits will begin
creeping upward for the rest of the year, reflecting both the
stronger dollar and a growing appetite for foreign oil.
   The American Petroleum Institute reported Wednesday that imported
crude and refined oil accounted for more than half the country's
total oil use in July, the first time that has occurred in 12 years.
   ``The June trade report is a good report, but you can't jump to
the conclusion that the trade deficit is on a downward trend,'' said
Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill.
   She predicted that the overall deficit would show only a small
improvement this year, perhaps declining to $110 billion, while
Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he was
looking for no improvement at all in the trade deficit for 1989 as a
whole.
   The improvement in exports was led by a jump in sales of U.S.
capital goods overseas. The import decline was widespread,
reflecting lower shipments of foreign autos, capital goods and oil.
   America's foreign oil bill dropped 11.5 percent in June to $4.2
billion as both the volume and price of imported oil fell. However,
analysts, noting the American Petroleum Institute report for July,
said oil imports would likely be rising for the rest of the year.
   As usual, the largest trade deficit in June was with Japan, an
imbalance of $3.9 billion, down from a May deficit of $4.3 billion.
The deficit with Taiwan totaled $1.2 billion in June, while the
deficit with China was $700 million.
   The total June deficit of $8.17 billion was the lowest since a
$6.79 billion deficit in December 1984.

   Strikes and ethnic turmoil in the Soviet Union
snarled rail lines from the Baltic Sea to the Caucasus on Thursday,
and Russians in Moldavia stopped work for two hours to press their
demands on local leaders, state media said.
   The events showed the variety and gravity of the ethnic quarrels
faced by Soviet rulers, who issued proposals Thursday on interethnic
relations. Those proposals gave vague promises of decentralization
but no specific remedies for the nation's often bloody nationalist
strife.
   In Estonia, where tens of thousands of ethnic Russian workers
have been on strike for nine days, their organizers met with top
Communist Party and government officials, including Estonian
President Arnold Ruutel, in an attempt to negotiate an end to the
conflict, the Tass news agency said.
   ``We'll go back to work immediately if we get the guarantees we
want from Estonian leaders,'' Alexei Gutenov, a representative of
the strike committee, said by telephone from Tallinn, the Baltic
republic's capital.
   The strike broke out because the Estonian parliament voted to
approve the first residency requirements in the Soviet Union for
voting and running for office. Strike leaders claim the new law
would strip 80,000 Russians and other migrants in Estonia of the
right to vote or seek elective office.
   The national Presidium on Wednesday declared the Estonian law
unconstitutional in a decision approved by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. ``We'll end the walkout if Estonian leaders agree to
abide by the Presidium's decision and change the law,'' Gutenov said.
   Strike leaders claimed more than 50 enterprises in the republic
of 1.6 million people have been shut by their action. Another joined
the strike Thursday, Gutenov said.
   Izvestia, the government daily, quouted Railway Minister N.
Konarev as saying that because of the strike, 3,000 railcars have
been idled in Estonia, of which more than 700 have been left on
railway lines, blocking dozens of trains from proceeding.
   In Tallinn, where all stations that load and unload freight have
been paralyzed by the walkout, 34 trains carrying perishable
foodstuffs and other goods are waiting to be discharged, Konarev
said.
   According to Tass, the strike committee has said the question of
whether or nt to suspend the strike will be decided by a vote.
   Russian workers also flexed their muscles in Moldavia, a small
Soviet republic on the border with Romania. Frightened by a proposed
law that would make Moldavian the republic's official language,
Russian workers in Tiraspol, Moldavia's second-largest city, staged
a two-hour ``warning strike'' Wednesday.
   Tass said the working people of Tiraspol and in other Moldavian
cities where non-Moldavians make up nearly 40 percent of the
population demanded the language proposal be changed to protect
their interests.
   ``We're convinced strikes are an extreme measure of resolving
labor disputes,'' Sergei Mikhailov, a strike leader in Tiraspol,
told Tass. ``But the alarming sociopolitical situation in Moldavia
forced us to do it.''
   Russians and other non-Moldavians fear they will be put at a
disadvantage if the proposed law requires a knowledge of the local
language for those seeking certain jobs.
   Similar measures have been enacted in the Baltic republics, and
Russians in Moldavia fear the language law will be the first step
down the same road pursued by nationalist activist in Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania. Moldavia's parliament is scheduled to meet
Aug. 29 to debate the measure.
   Ethnic strife in the Soviet Caucasus republic of Azerbaijan has
also disrupted rail service as far north as the Volga basin, the
Izvestia report said. Last year, Armenians and Azerbaijanis began a
long, bloody quarrel over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly
Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan.
   Izvestia said a railway bridge had been destroyed near
Stepanakert, the enclave's administrative center. Earlier this week,
about 200 people surged onto the tracks at Velidag in an attempt to
disrupt rail service, it said. Near Karchivan, Azerbaijan, somebody
tried to blow up the railbed ``but blew himself up while trying to
place the bomb,'' Izvestia said.

<TEXT>
   The federal deficit is on a path leading to
$128 billion of red ink in 1993 _ when the law requires the budget
to be in balance _ the Congressional Budget Office said Thursday.
   In the short run, even if Congress fully implements an agreement
worked out with the White House, the deficit will be $118 billion in
1990, or $18 billion above the target set by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, CBO projected.
   And for budget year 1991, which begins in less than 14 months, a
$127 billion deficit, $63 billion above the figure allowed by law,
was forecast.
   ``Clearly, this implies Congress and the administration are going
to face a very difficult challenge in fiscal year 1991,'' CBO
Director Robert S. Reischauer told a news conference. Cutting the
1991 deficit to the target level would require a deficit-reduction
effort more than twice as large as any previous plan, he said.
   ``The key message is that we have a very long way to go if the
deficit is to be brought down to a level Americans will be
comfortable with,'' Reischauer said.
   The CBO figures indicate a deficit each year that would be large
enough to force across-the-board spending cuts in most federal
programs, as required by the Gramm-Rudman law. However, it is
forecasts from the White House Office of Management and Budget that
determine whether those reductions will be made _ and the OMB is
expected to project deficits low enough to avoid the mandated
spending cuts.
   OMB forecasts will be made public Monday.
   Reischauer made his comments as CBO issued a five-year economic
forecast of continued slow growth, gradually declining short-term
interest rates, inflation in the 4.6 percent range and a slight
increase in unemployment.
   CBO's economic forecasts are less optimistic than those of OMB,
which accounts for a big share of the difference between the two
agencies' outlook for the deficit.
   Assuming Congress fully implements the deficit-cutting plan
worked out with the administration, and if one-time-only collections
from selling government assets are not counted, Reischauer said, the
CBO figures indicate a 1990 deficit of $124 billion, or $24 billion
above the Gramm-Rudman maximum. Such a shortfall would result in $24
billion in spending cuts, divided evenly between defense and
domestic programs.
   However, the administration projection is likely to show a $105
billion deficit, which would be $5 billion below the level that
would trigger automatic spending cuts, Reischauer said.
   Deficit reduction will be a major issue when Congress returns to
Washington after the August recess. Lawmakers face an Oct. 15
deadline _ two weeks after the start of budget year 1990 _ for
completing work to implement the deficit-cutting agreement with the
White House.
   The major proposal under consideration would cut the deficit by
about $13 billion by reducing spending and raising new revenues.
Almost $9 billion of the $24-billion package of deficit reduction
for 1990 would come from accounting changes and one-time
collections, including asset sales.
   Deficit reduction, Reischauer said, ``is a political problem as
much as it is an economic problem. The American people have to send
a message to their legislators.''
   That message, he added, should indicate a willingness to accept
some short-term pain as the price for long-term improvement in the
government's budget policies.
   Continued high deficits could lower the nation's standard of
living, reduce the government's ability to influence the economy,
and boost international interest rates, which would drain resources
from poorer countries, Reischauer said.
   Asked if the deficit can be cut significantly without raising
taxes, Reischauer replied, ``The more programs and policies that are
under consideration, the easier it will be to craft a
deficit-reduction package.''
   CBO estimates this year's deficit at $161 billion.

   A federal judge Thursday ordered former
Washington lawyer William Borders to testify in the Senate
impeachment trial of U.S. District Court Judge Alcee Hastings.
   U.S. District Court Judge George Revercomb said Borders must
respond to questions from the Senate panel considering the Hastings
matter or face a possible contempt of court order which could send
the prominent onetime lawyer to jail.
   Revercomb said a June 27 immunity order by U.S. District Court
Judge Louis Oberdorfer was proper and that ``sanctions would be
imposed'' if it is violated.
   ``You must testify'' before the Senate Impeachment Trial
Committee or show cause why he should not be held in contempt,
Revercomb told Borders, who served nearly three years in prison for
his conviction in a bribe conspiracy allegedly involving Hastings.
   Senate legal counsel Michael Davidson said he would check to
determine how soon a committee meeting can be scheduled so that
Borders can be called.
   Borders was subpoenaed to testify before the Senate panel, but
twice refused to answer questions, on July 24 and July 27.
   Hastings and his close friend Borders were charged in 1981 with
conspiring to accept a $150,000 bribe in exchange for agreeding to
reduce the sentences of two convicted criminals to probation and
returning nearly $1 million in forfeited property.
   Borders was convicted while Hastings was acquitted in a separate
trial.
   The House voted a year ago to impeach Hastings for bribery and
perjury in connection with the case in which he was acquitted and
also for allegedly leaking confidential wiretap information in a
separate case.
   Borders' attorney, Michael Rosier, argued against ordering his
client to testify. Rosier said in court papers filed earlier this
week that the court-authorized grant of immunity to Borders was
defective.
   Rosier said the Senate trial committee failed to notify the
attorney general at least 10 days in advance of the panel's
intention to seek court-authorized immunity for Borders. Rosier also
raised constitutional concerns, saying that forcing him to testify
amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.
   Borders ``has paid his debt to society'' by serving nearly three
years in federal prison for conspiring to bribe Hastings, said the
court papers. ``The conduct of the government in its constant
efforts to force Mr. Borders' testimony has now reached the level
that it shocks the conscience and violates fundamental principles of
fairness, justice and decency.''
   Borders ``has the right to be free from the constant threat of
incarceration,'' his lawyers said.
   Revercomb said that under the immunity order, Borders ``always
has a right to relieve himself of incarceration'' by testifying to
the Senate.

<HEAD>Government Accuses U.S. Of Supplying New Rockets To Guerrillas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghanistan claimed Thursday that the
United States was supplying the anti-communist guerrillas with new
rockets that explode in the air and shower warheads, which detonate
on the ground.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said reporters on
Friday would be shown pieces of the rockets, which he did not name
but said had U.S. markings.
   The United States has said it is providing the guerrillas with
new weapons to counter arms shipments to the Afghan government from
the Soviet Union. Published reports say these include cluster bombs
and Spanish 120mm mortars, designed to crater airport runways.
   ``It is a long-range, U.S.-type missile, it's very strong and it
can destroy vast areas,'' Amani said. ``You can see the U.S.
markings.''
   He said the guerrillas fired 53 missiles, including the
previously unused rockets, at Kabul late Tuesday and early Wednesday.
   One of the new rockets killed five civilians and injured 23
others in the former Soviet-occupied Mikrorayan housing complex near
Kabul airport, now home to many government workers, Amani said. One
of the victims was a child who picked up a piece of rocket that then
exploded, he said.
   He said casualties were low because the attack was at night and
most people were asleep.
   ``But I can assure you that if they continue firing these new
rockets, the people will suffer casualties and their hatred against
the opponent groups and the United States of America will
increase,'' Amani said.
   Explaining how the new rocket worked, Amani said it exploded at
some point in the air, and its 30 warheads then exploded on the
ground.
   ``Even its pieces have exploded sometimes after one hour without
being touched,'' he said.
   The government has said that in the last four weeks, 354 rockets
hit Kabul, killing 193 civilians and injuring more than 500.
   Most of the rockets fired at Kabul are Egyptian-made Sakers, with
a range of up to 25 miles.
   The guerrillas have claimed responsibility for some attacks but
not those in recent days. They claim the government aims rockets at
civilian targets to discredit them.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have accused each other of
escalating the arms race in the 11-year Afghan war since Soviet
troops pulled out in February.
   Last week, the U.S. government said the Soviets were supplying
Afghanistan with MiG-29 fighters and the latest Su-27 ground attack
jets to be used in the event of a Pakistani attack.
   The Afghan government has confounded Western predictions of a
quick guerrilla victory after the Soviet pullout. The army has
repulsed guerrilla attacks on several major provincial cities,
including towns near the border with Pakistan such as Jalalabad.

<HEAD>Crash That Killed Pakistan's President Still a Mystery</HEAD>

   A year later, mystery still surrounds
the plane crash that killed President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, U.S.
Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 other people on Aug. 17, 1988.
   U.S. And Pakistani investigators all but ruled out technical
failure on the presidential plane, a sturdy, four-engine Lockheed
C-130 turboprop known as Pak One.
   Their report said the ``most probable cause was a criminal act or
sabotage,'' but did not say by whom. Gen. Zia's son speaks of a
coverup.
   The plane climbed into a clear sky over the Sutlej River near the
Indian border, behaved erratically three minutes later, then dived
into a sandy plain and exploded, killing everyone aboard.
   In addition to Zia and Raphel, the dead included the U.S.
military attache and most of Zia's top military officers.
   Some Pakistanis believe it was an assassination by domestic
political enemies Zia accumulated during 11 years of military rule.
Others prefer a foreign motive.
   Investigators said the explosion and fire obliterated most clues
but they found residues of chemicals that could, if combined, be
used in a detonator.
   Ghulam Ishaq Khan, president of the Senate, assumed the
presidency and declared Zia a martyr, bolstering the belief that the
general was murdered.
   Zia's death opened the way, three months later, for the first
free elections in more than a decade. The opposition Pakistan
People's Party won and its leader, Benazir Bhutto, became the first
woman prime minister in the Islamic world.
   The U.S.-Pakistani investigation report, parts of which were made
public, said the plane could have been put out of control by
``mechanical or deliberate'' interference with the flight control
system, interference with cockpit controls, disabling of the pilots
or ``explosive devices used'' to achieve one of those results.
   A popular theory holds that the six crew members were knocked out
by traceless nerve gas, possibly by someone aboard. Another says a
small explosive device damaged some critical part of the flight
control system.
   Suspicion fell on four groups:
   _Agents of Afghanistan's communist government, possibly trained
by the Soviet KGB secret police. Zia, with U.S. support, was a
staunch supporter of Moslem guerrillas in the neighboring country.
   _Domestic political foes, especially those loyal to Ms. Bhutto.
Zia overthrew her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in a 1977 military
coup and he was hanged two years later.
   _Pakistan's minority Shiite Moslems, because of the assassination
of their spiritual leader a month earlier.
   _Agents of India. The two nations have fought three wars since
1947, when the subcontinent was divided and they became independent
of Britain.
   Zia's son, Ijaz ul-Haq, said he believed the Bhutto family was
involved and the new government was covering up.
   ``I am certain that Al-Zulfikar had a hand in it,'' Ijaz, 38,
said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I have evidence,
but if I made it public now, I'd be eliminated.''
   His reference was to an organization named for the prime
minister's father and once run by Benazir's brother Murtaza, who
lives in Syria.
   Murtaza and another brother, now deceased, planned a Pakistan
Airlines hijacking in 1981 that forced Zia to release 52 political
prisoners. The hijackers killed a passenger they claimed had
betrayed Bhutto while serving under him.
   Benazir Bhutto has said her brother must face charges of air
piracy if he returns to Pakistan.
   An Al-Zulfikar member in London claimed responsibility for the
Pak One crash, but later recanted. The Bhutto family and officials
of the governing party have denied any involvement or coverup.
   The U.S.-Pakistani report recommended a separate investigation of
possible criminal acts. President Ishaq Khan appointed F.K. Bandial,
a career civil servant with few political connections, to conduct it.
   No findings have been published. When asked by The Associated
Press, Bandial would not say how many people were involved or
whether they had made progress.
   ``The investigation is still in hand,'' he said. ``Whatever we
send to the government will be private.''

   President Bush's chief spokesman said
Thursday that Bush supports Poland's move toward a ``remarkable and
history-making'' non-communist government.
   The vacationing president was keeping close tabs on Polish
developments, said presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   While the summer White House reacted cautiously to Thursday's
reports of Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski's approval of
Solidarity Leader Lech Walesa's plan for a coalition government,
officials privately were enthusiastic.
   ``Two years ago, no one in the United States would have predicted
this could happen. Of course we're happy, extremely happy'' said a
senior administration official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Bush passed up an opportunity to react to developments in Poland
directly. Asked about the situation by reporters between holes on a
local golf course, he said, ``No comment.''
   Fitzwater said Bush, who voiced strong support for recent
political reforms during his trip to Poland last month, was not
endorsing Walesa or any other candidate to head what would be the
first non-communist government in the Soviet bloc.
   ``It is a sensitive situation there in terms of the general
movement away from the communist control,'' Fitzwater said. He said
Bush remained determined not ``to do anything or say anything to
upset the apple cart. ... We're very reluctant to involve ourselves
in a more direct fashion.''
   Still, Fitzwater said, ``There's really not much question of his
support and his thinking on that matter.''
   The spokesman disclosed Bush and Walesa discussed the possibility
of Walesa becoming prime minister when the two had lunch in Gdansk
last month.
   Walesa has voiced reservations this week about accepting the post.
   Fitzwater said Bush and Walesa ``talked about the political
process and the prospects and about Lech Walesa's personal feelings
about his role. ... The president understands the various pressures
that are on Mr. Walesa and he (Walesa) is very concerned about the
new government, about Solidarity's ability to step in and take over
the new government.''
   Aides said Bush was told of the latest development _ Jaruzelski's
acceptance of Walesa's plan _ when he returned from a morning
boating and fishing trip on the first full day of a three-week
vacation at his oceanside home.
   ``We're watching the situation. We continue to watch the
situation. But there are still many unanswered questions,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``Certainly a non-communist government would be a remarkable and
history-making occurrence.'' the spokesman said.
   He said that the White House would have no further comment on the
situation in Poland ``until there's much clearer direction on what
happens next.''
   Bush was receiving briefings on the developments in Poland from
Deputy National Security Adviser Robert M. Gates.
   During his visit to Poland, Bush announced a three-year $119
million package of economic aid to reward Poland for steps toward
democracy.
   ``We would not try to intrude in the internal affairs of Poland
to the point of suggesting one form of government or another,''
Fitzwater said. ``We do encourage and support the process of
pluralism. And it appears that that is the general direction that
they are aiming.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Overturns Award Against Magazine In Murder For Hire
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Thursday struck down a
jury's $9.4 million award against Soldier of Fortune magazine made
to relatives of a woman murdered by a mercenary hired through a
classified advertisement.
   E. Barrett Prettyman Jr., an appeals attorney for Soldier of
Fortune, said Thursday that publisher Robert Brown was ``ecstatic''
over the ruling, which Prettyman called a First Amendment victory
for the publishing industry.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a Houston jury
had imposed too high a standard on the magazine, adding that
publishers could be discouraged from running other ambiguously
worded ads if the award were upheld.
   ``The kind of duty the plaintiffs were attempting to impose here
would not only have put this magazine out of business, but would
have had an extraordinarily harmful effect on magazines and
publishers of all kinds,'' Prettyman said.
   ``It should be a great relief for all those protected by the
First Amendment,'' Prettyman said.
   Robert Black was convicted of hiring hit man John Wayne Hearn to
kill his wife, Sandra Black, in February 1985 through an ad that
read: ``Ex Marines. '67-69 vets. Ex-DI, weapons specialist _ jungle
warfare. Pilot. ME. High-risk assignments. U.S. or overseas.''
   Robert Black is now on Texas' death row and Hearn is in Florida
serving three life sentences for the Black killing and two other
murders.
   Soldier of Fortune's lawyers argued in a June 5th Circuit hearing
that there was no way the magazine's publishers could have known the
cryptic ad was actually a solicitation for murder. The ad appeared
in a 1984 issue.
   John Roberson, representing Mrs. Black's son Gary, 19, and
mother, Marjorie Eimann, 65, said during the hearing that ``high
risk assignment'' clearly meant ``gun for hire'' in the lingo of the
magazine.
   However, Judge W. Eugene Davis disagreed when writing on behalf
of the three-judge 5th Circuit panel Thursday.
   ``The burden on a publisher to avoid liability from suits of this
type is too great,'' Davis wrote.
   ``Without a more specific indication of illegal intent than
Hearn's ad or its context provided, we conclude that Soldier of
Fortune did not violate the standard of conduct by publishing an ad
that later played a role in criminal activity,'' he wrote.
   Although the magazine said the judgment against it had been a
violation of press freedoms under the First Amendment, Davis said
the court didn't need to address First Amendment arguments. He wrote
that, under Texas liability law, the magazine had no duty to refrain
from publishing an ambiguously worded ad.
   Roberson and other attorneys for the plaintiffs did not
immediately return telephone calls when asked to comment on
Thursday's ruling.

   Officials confirmed Thursday that Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid, the Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by Israel, told
interrogators he believed two of the three Israeli soldiers taken
prisoner in Lebanon were dead.
   It was the first Israeli confirmation of a report of the
soldier's deaths in The Sunday Times of London.
   Officials also said, however, that Obeid's belief was based on
second-hand information and they seriously doubted its reliability.
   Israel's policy is that soldiers are considered alive until there
is proof of their deaths. Officials said they would investigate the
source of the leak to the London paper.
   Commandos abducted Obeid from his home in south Lebanon on July
28. Israel has offered to trade him and hundreds of other Lebanese
Shiites it holds for the three Israelis and all 16 Western hostages
in Lebanon, who include eight Americans.
   Obeid is affiliated with Hezbollah, or Party of God, the
pro-Iranian group thought to sponsor hostage-takers.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the soldiers' families were
told last week about what the captive said, and ``knew this
information from Obeid's interrogation before the leak,'' Israel
Television reported.
   A senior Defense Ministry official, apeaking on condition of
anonymity, said Obeid told investigators he ``heard from somebody''
that soldiers Yossi Fink and Rahamim Alsheik died after Shiite
extremists captured them in February 1986.
   The Sunday Times said Israeli officials considered Obeid's
statements accurate.
   ``That is not true,'' Fink's father, Mordechai, said in a
telephone interview. He said he was in constant touch with military
officials, who told him they had ``no substantial information
whatsoever'' on his son's fate.
   He confirmed the families were told last week about Obeid's
comment.

   The Drug Enforcement Administration is
investigating whether an agent arrested in Boston while allegedly
attempting to deliver cocaine revealed any information on DEA
operations to drug traffickers, a spokesman said Thursday.
   ``There is an internal security investigation going on,''
concerning agent Edward K. O'Brien, 44, said spokesman Frank Shults,
who declined to reveal details of the probe.
   O'Brien, an 18-year veteran of the agency, was arrested late
Monday at Boston's Logan International Airport while allegedly
delivering suitcases filled with 62 pounds of cocaine to informants,
authorities said.
   A bail hearing scheduled for Thursday before a U.S. magistrate
was postponed until Aug. 24.
   Shults rejected as having ``no factual basis'' a published report
that during the investigation of O'Brien by the DEA's Office of
Professional Responsibility, allegations surfaced linking O'Brien to
a major Miami-to-Boston cocaine-distribution ring that allegedly
remains the target of an independent DEA probe.
   ``There is no DEA investigation of such a ring,'' Shults said.
While the DEA is probing many East Coast drug-trafficking rings, he
said, none was ``known to be associated with Mr. O'Brien.''
   Asked whether the agency were checking all of its ongoing probes
to see if there might be some connection to O'Brien, he said, ``That
gets back to our internal investigation.''
   Shults denied that, in order to protect an agency investigation
of the drug ring, he was attempting to debunk an article in
Thursday's Washington Post.
   He noted that O'Brien was arrested in connection with a sting
operation: ``It was a controlled delivery arranged by the DEA in
Miami to somebody in Boston, arranged and controlled by DEA at both
ends,'' Shults said.
   O'Brien faces charges of possession with intent to distribute
more than five kilograms (11 pounds) of cocaine, and if convicted
could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined up to $4 million.
   O'Brien received $14,000 to transport the drugs and was expecting
to receive another $14,000 in Boston, said DEA Special Agent John J.
Coleman in Boston. Last month, Coleman said, DEA watched as O'Brien
obtained about 55 pounds of cocaine and sham cocaine and brought it
to Boston for $25,000.
   The internal DEA investigation, an administration source said,
may involve a check of the agency's computer indexing system to see
if O'Brien used it to get information on drug investigations in
which he was not involved.
   From May 1988 until last month, O'Brien was a staff coordinator
within the international programs office overseeing DEA operations
in Europe and the Middle East. He was assigned last month to prepare
a drug law enforcement museum for the DEA's new headquarters. From
1982 to 1988, he was agent-in-charge in Springfield, Mass.
   Coleman said Tuesday that O'Brien was in charge of many
successful DEA sting operations and that they had worked together in
southern France trying to uncover heroin labs in the 1970s. ``Those
were the hotbeds of activity in the French Connection days,'' he
said.
   The French Connection was the title of a 1971 movie about the
operation.
   O'Brien received a special citation from Massachusetts Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis in 1984 for supervising the crackdown on a major
cocaine ring in western Massachusetts. He also had received several
DEA commendations.
   Tom Cash, special agent in charge of the Miami office, told The
Associated Press after the arrests of three DEA agents in Miami this
spring, ``It's not the average special agent who is involved in
these types of incidents _ it's the very best.'' After a while, he
said, such agents believe they know the system and can beat it.

   An environmental group accused the
Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday of contributing to
increased air pollution by promoting the burning of toxic wastes.
   The EPA issued a statement saying the group ``seriously
distorts'' the agency's role in the disposal of such wastes and that
its primary goal is to promote waste reduction, not a particular
method of disposal or treatment.
   The National Toxics Campaign Fund, a private organization that
focuses on toxic pollution issues, told a news conference outside
the agency's headquarters EPA's policies will ``encourage more toxic
waste production.''
   The group argued that the EPA does not focus enough in getting
companies and industrial plants to invest in technology that would
reduce toxic emissions.
   Instead, the critics maintained, agency policy requires state and
local officials to develop new toxic disposal facilities such as
additional landfills or incinerators.
   ``New disposal capacity will only encourage toxic waste
production,'' said the group. It said putting such wastes in
landfills risks pollution through leakage and the burning toxic
wastes results in the release of ``massive quanities of toxic fumes
and carcinogenic compunds'' into the air.
   ``The only thing we're prompting is waste reduction,'' said EPA
spokeswoman Robin Woods. ``We're encouraging (states) to consider
all waste reduction opportunities. Secondly we're looking at them to
look at existing (disposal) facilities out of state. And as a last
resort build new facilities.''
   She said that the EPA requires strict emission controls when
toxic wastes are burned.
   Congress has directed states to certify by next October to the
EPA that they have enough toxic waste disposal capacity to manage
wastes generated over the next 20 years.
   Ms. Woods said the EPA has yet to receive any of the state toxic
waste disposal plans that are due Oct. 17 and that she could not say
to what extent states intend to rely on incineration.

<TEXT>
   It was a busy day for the stocky man in the
graying mustache and patron saint's pin. Lech Walesa, shipyard
worker and Nobel Peace Prize winner, was trying to form the first
non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc.
   The Solidarity and Black Madonna badges were prominent on his
lapel, as always, when Walesa emerged from the Europejski Hotel
shortly before 9 a.m. Thursday, wearing a natty plaid jacket.
   He stepped into a dented dull-gray Polonez car flying a
Solidarity flag and his driver sped away, with a convoy of camera
crews and journalists in pursuit.
   His first stop was the headquarters of the small United Peasant
Party, where Walesa hoped to enlist party leader Roman Malinowski in
a coalition.
   ``This is something really new for us,'' the switchboard operator
said as Walesa strode in. The party was allied with the Communists
for years, but has become more independent.
   An hour later, Walesa came out beaming, with an agreeable
Malinowski in tow.
   The Polonez, just as dull and dented despite its occupant's
political success, negotiated congested streets to the headquarters
of the Democratic Party, another small group with a history similar
to the United Peasants.
   Less than an hour later, party leader Jerzy Jozwiak had agreed to
join the coalition.
   Another Walesa grin for the cameras, into the Polonez and back to
the hotel.
   Just after noon, Walesa was off again, to a palace in a wooded
park near the Vistula River to seal the deal with Solidarity's
coalition partners.
   A guard slammed the door and reporters took shelter under the
trees from the hot sun.
   Another hour and another picture, this time of the three men,
with Walesa in the middle raising the hands of his new partners high.
   ``I don't have to say anything,'' he said. ``This picture says it
all. Now to work.''
   Lunch in the cavernous hotel dining room drew a crowd. It became
a working meal with Bronislaw Geremek, leader of Solidarity's
parliamentary delegation, and Andrzej Stelmachowski, marshal of the
Senate.
   Walesa had been open and talkative all morning, but the mood
changed when he left for Belvedere Palace, the official residence of
President Wojciech Jaruzelski, to present his proposal for a
coalition government.
   Two soldiers guarded the entrance as Walesa, Malinowski and
Jozwiak arrived in separate cars at 3 p.m.
   An hour went by, then a familiar red Peugeot with only a driver
turned into the palace drive.
   ``Kiszczak,'' the reporters said. Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, the
prime minister elected by Parliament, had arrived.
   After another hour, the meeting ended. Walesa assessed the
meeting, through the glass of a car window, with the single word
``Good.''
   Back at the hotel, dozens of reporters followed him to his room,
hoping for news of his encounter with the stolid general in dark
glasses, whose declaration of martial law in December 1981 sent
Solidarity into eight years of limbo.
   Resolute and brief, Walesa said Jaruzelski favored the coalition
concept and that Kiszczak had resigned. He pushed his way into the
room and closed the door.
   Less than an hour later, the drab, faithful Polonez took Walesa
to Parliament for a meeting of senators and deputies elected with
Solidarity backing in June's partially free elections.
   Once more to the hotel, then to the residence of Cardinal Jozef
Glemp, the Roman Catholic primate of Poland.
   There was no rush here for the devout man who so often seeks
advice from Pope John Paul II, a fellow Pole.
   He spent an hour with the cardinal, and a reporter asked when he
came out: ``What next?''
   ``Sleep,'' Walesa replied, ending a day no one dreamed when he
vaulted the Lenin Shipyard's fence in Gdansk nine years ago to lead
the strike in which Solidarity was born.

<HEAD>U.N. Reconnaissance Mission To Visit Central America</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations will send a team to
Central America to prepare for a U.N. military observer group that
will help monitor repatriation of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels,
officials said Thursday.
   The advance team will travel to the region in early September,
said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   He had no further details on the composition or itinerary of the
advance party, although he said it would probably visit all five
Central American nations.
   The U.N. peacekeeping mission will consist of 100 military
observers and a 50-member support staff. Canada, Spain and West
Germany have agreed to provide personnel, Giuliani said.
   Central American leaders meanwhile asked Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar to set up a U.N. and Organization of American
States civilian mission to help disband and resettle the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   The commission, which is expected to travel to Central America in
September, is to aid ``the voluntary demobilization, repatriation or
relocation in Nicaragua or third countries of the Nicaraguan
resistance and their families.''
   Central American presidents agreed earlier this month to disband
the so-called Contras by mid-December. In return, Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega agreed to hold free and fair elections in
February.
   About 11,000 Contras and 12,000 dependents live in camps in
Honduras. Since the U.S. Congress cut off their military aid last
year, they have received $4.5 million monthly in humanitaritan
assistance.
   The Sandinista government and the Contras agreed March 21 to
suspend offensive operations, but talks aimed at a permanent end to
the 7-year-old war stand at an impasse.
   The White House has agreed to abide by the Tela plan but insists
the rebels must voluntarily agree to disband. Many rebel leaders
have said they will not.
   The United Nations and OAS, however, could help persuade them,
the Central American leaders say. In addition, Honduras has said it
will cooperate with the plan and Nicaragua has offered to help
resettle the rebels.
   Nicaraguan deputy foreign minister, Victor Hugo Tinoco, said
returning Contras will be given land and all other aid to which
Nicaraguan peasant farmers are entitled.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Jeered by Seniors Over Stance on Health-Care Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 angry senior citizens jeered Rep.
Dan Rostenkowski on Thursday and briefly blocked his car from
leaving a meeting with community leaders opposing his stance on the
Comprehensive Health Care Act.
   Members of the crowd _ yelling, ``Liar! liar!'' ``Impeach!
Impeach!'' and ``We won't forget at election time'' _ followed
Rostenkowski when he left his car and walked to a location a block
away while his car was driven around the crowd. He then was able to
get back in the car, which drove off.
   During the walk, Rostenkowski refused to acknowledge the
gathering crowds or answer reporters' questions. His only comment
was, ``I don't think they understand what's going on. That's too
bad.''
   Rostenkowski began his day at a community center in the Northwest
Side Chicago district that for 30 years has sent him to Congress,
where he is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
   He discussed his support for the controversial catastrophic
health care law during a private, 90-minute meeting with
representatives of six organizations representing senior citizens.
   Jerry Prete, president of the Illinois State Council of Senior
Citizens, said Rostenkowski ``wasn't receptive'' to suggestions made
during the session.
   Prete said the group leaders hoped to persuade Rostenkowski to
oppose measures that would shift more of the cost of health care to
seniors.
   Although the meeting may not have gone smoothly, Rostenkowski's
real troubles began after he left the meeting and refused to address
200 people who had gathered in an auditorium outside the private
meeting room.
   As he made his way toward the door, Rostenkowski was roundly
booed and many of those present followed him onto the streets.
   ``We told him we weren't going to boo,'' Prete said. ``We said we
were going to show respect.''
   Rostenkowski walked past the group and climbed into his car.
   People in the crowd, several carrying signs reading, ``Read Our
Lips, Catastrophic Plan Is A Catastrophe,'' then surrounded the car
and one woman refused to move from in front of the vehicle.
   ``We think this man is inhumane,'' said Lawrence Dobson, 67, who
was part of the gathering. ``He's not answering the questions or
needs of the people. Is he afraid of senior citizens?.''
   The catastrophic health insurance program would improve benefits
for the 200 million people, or 85 percent of Americans, who are
underinsured against catastrophic long-term illness.
   Higher income retirees who pay most of the cost of the program
have been lobbying the committee to spread the cost among all
taxpayers, not just older citizens.

<DATELINE>EREZ CHECKPOINT, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers blocked
about 1,000 Palestinians from entering Israel Thursday in a test of
new ID cards that have intensified the struggle between Israeli
authorities and Palestinian leaders.
   Officials said about 5,000 other Palestinians got through the
Erez checkpoint during the four-hour test because they had applied
for and received the identification cards, which will be required of
all Gazans who want to enter Israel starting Friday.
   Officials have said they may extend the new system to the West
Bank.
   The experiment came off without violence, unlike five days
earlier when masked youths threw stones at hundreds of cars at
checkpoints to protest the cards.
   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been ordered to
begin a boycott Friday of their jobs in Israel to protest the cards,
which Israeli authorities say are aimed at increasing security.
   In the occupied West Bank on Thursday, soldiers shot and killed a
Palestinian prison escapee carrying an Uzi submachine gun when he
ignored a warning to halt, the army said.
   Shahadi Darwish, 25, was killed night near the village of Idna,
20 miles southwest of Jerusalem.
   The army said Darwish escaped in May from a jail where he was
detained ``on suspicion of committing several terrorist acts,''
including the murder of a police officer.
   His death raised to 537 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli troops and Jewish settlers since the uprising began in
December 1987. Another 95 Palestinians accused of collaborating with
Israel have been killed by fellow Arabs, and 38 Israelis have been
killed.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, troops shot and wounded four
Palestinians, including a 5-year-old boy, Arab hospital officials
said. The army said it was investigating the incidents.
   Near Erez crossing, Brig. Gen. Arye Ramot, head of the Gaza Strip
military government, said the new computerized ID cards will prevent
``potential offenders'' from entering Israel.
   He said nearly 60,000 new cards had been issued and 30,000 to
40,000 more would probably be given out by the time the system
becomes fully operational in three months. A few thousand people
have been refused cards because they have criminal records of been
accused of security offenses, Ramot said.
   Ramot would not give details on why people were refused cards but
said even some people arrested in the uprising could receive them if
they stopped anti-Israeli activities.
   Palestinians maintain the new system is mostly intended to quell
the uprising by putting an economic squeeze on Gaza, where poverty
is widespread and the population of 700,000 depends heavily on jobs
in Israel.
   Graffiti in Gaza called for a two-week boycott of Israeli jobs
starting Friday, and a leaflet from the PLO-backed uprising leaders
ordered a one-week sympathy strike by workers in the West Bank to
start Friday.
   Enforcers for the committees that run the revolt have been going
through towns, villages and camps to seize the cards.
   Near Erez on Thursday, a 48-year-old Palestinian father of eight
complained he'd had to pay his back taxes to get a card and that now
fellow Arabs probably would seize the card.
   Non-payment of taxes has been a major tactic of the uprising, and
Palestinians who want cards must pay all back taxes.
   Ramot said about 1,000 people had asked for second cards after
their first ones were seized.
   According to government figures, 50,000 Palestinians from the
Gaza Strip work in Israel, along with about 60,000 residents of the
West Bank.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Finds Logan Fees Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Port Authority unreasonably and
illegally imposed a dual set of landing fees to discourage small
planes from using Logan International Airport, a federal appeals
court ruled Thursday.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
wrote that Massport's its landing fee system had been
unscientifically developed and unfairly discriminated against small
planes.
   Massport's policy was based on the premise that commercial jets
carrying 400 passengers should have priority over a six-seat private
plane, but federal law has long held that all aircraft should have
equal access to U.S. runways.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation, which objected to
Massport's fees, ``has broad authority and responsibility to
regulate navigable airspace to assure its efficient use ... and to
protect `the right of freedom of transit through navigable
airspace,''' the court ruled.
   Massport officials said they were disapppointed with the decision
but hope to work with new leadership at the transportation
department in Washington to ease delay and congestion at Logan.
   Massport last year raised the landing fee for small aircraft at
Logan from a flat $25 per touchdown to a minimum of $100. At the
same time, commercial jet fees were cut. A jumbo jet, for example,
saw its $800 fee cut in half.
   The owners of private and commuter planes complained, but traffic
dropped by one-third and on-time performance for commercial jets
surged from last place among the country's 27 largest airports in
May 1988, to second place in December 1988.

<TEXT>
   A giant python known to gobble down
raccoons ``like they were marshmallows'' was finally captured
Thursday by four men who tunneled under a home to confront the
20-foot, 250-pound snake.
   ``I got close enough to snare it and then we just attacked,''
said Todd Hardwick, owner of Pesky Critters Relocation in suburban
Miami. ``It showed no fear of us. It's a proud reptile. He could
have broken our ribs in the flash of an eye.''
   Hardwick believes the python was a pet released years ago in a
nearby park across from Fort Lauderdale beach. The animal probably
crawled under the house and caught small animals for food.
   ``The homeowners had been calling people for a month, but no one
wanted to go after it,'' said Hardwick, whose company traps nuisance
animals in South Florida. ``People say they've seen it eat 30-pound
raccoons like they were marshmallows.''
   Hardwick believes the snake is the largest ever captured in South
Florida, where many exotic pets are illegally released into the wild.
   The reticulate python, a native of southeastern Asia and
Indonesia, can grow to more than 30 feet. The snakes, which are not
venomous, coil around their prey to stop breathing and blood flow.
   On Wednesday, Hardwick and a crew began digging tunnels below the
home. They found the snake about eight feet underground next to a
concrete wall.
   Hardwick said he hooked the snake around the head with a pole
snare. He and his helpers then wrestled it down and yanked it out of
the tunnel.
   ``It was like it was daring us to challenge him,'' said Hardwick.
   He said he hopes to sell the snake to a zoo or serpentarium.

<HEAD>JDO Activist Mordechai Levy Indicted on Attempted Murder Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A militant Jewish leader was indicted Thursday on
charges of attempted murder and other counts for allegedly spraying
a Greenwich Villge street with gunfire and wounding a 69-year-old
man.
   The eight-count indictment charged that Mordechai Levy, 27, head
of the Jewish Defense Organization, tried to kill Irving Rubin,
national director of the Jewish Defense League, and two other men
Aug. 10 outside his apartment, said District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau.
   Levy told police that Rubin and Steven Rombom and Allon
Klebanoff, both reported to be process servers, were throwing rocks
at his windows on the second floor of the building. He said he
thought the men meant to kill him.
   The three men had gone to Levy's place to serve legal papers in
connection with a defamation suit Rubin and his wife had filed
against Levy in Los Angeles.
   The lawsuit alleges that Levy said in a broadcast on KFI-AM radio
that Rubin was guilty of drug dealing, extortion and money
laundering, and charges that Levy said Rubin's wife, Shelly, had
attempted suicide by a drug overdose.
   Morgenthau said the grand jury also charged Levy with
first-degree assault for shooting Dominick Spinelli, 69, a bystander
wounded in the left knee while sitting in a parked van. Spinelli was
hospitalized for five days and underwent surgery.
   Levy also was charged with reckless endangerment for jeopardizing
the lives of those in the area. He gave up after a two-hour standoff
and 15 minutes of negotiations with police.
   Police said Levy had permits for seven shotguns and rifles,
including an Uzi submachine gun, that police found in his apartment.
   Levy, who is being held without bail, is to be arraigned on the
indictment in the trial-level state Supreme Court on Aug. 30. He
faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of attempted murder.
   Police said the incident stemmed from an old dispute between
Rubin and Levy over who would head the Jewish Defense League. The
JDO splintered off from the JDL in 1985.

   Rodney Crowell, Ricky Van Shelton and
Hank Williams Jr. were chosen Thursday as finalists for four honors
each in the 23rd annual Country Music Association awards.
   The late Keith Whitley was selected as a finalist for three
awards, along with newcomer Clint Black, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,
George Strait and Randy Travis.
   Williams, the CMA's entertainer of the year in 1987 and 1988, is
a finalist for that honor again. He is joined by Reba McEntire,
Shelton, Strait and Travis.
   Winners will be announced Oct. 9 during a nationally televised
show at the Grand Ole Opry House.
   Some of the top names in country music failed to make the
finalists, including Willie Nelson, Kenny Rogers, K.T. Oslin, the
Oak Ridge Boys, Ricky Skaggs and Barbara Mandrell. Oslin was voted
female vocalist of the year in 1988.
   Finalists for top male vocalist are Crowell, Shelton, Strait,
Travis and Whitley. Competing for No. 1 female vocalist will be
Rosanne Cash, Patty Loveless, Kathy Mattea, McEntire and Tanya
Tucker.
   Williams, son of a country music legend, completed his
nominations in the category of music video of the year for ``There's
a Tear in My Beer'' and two nominations in vocal event of the year,
one with Johnny Cash and the other with his late father. The vocal
event of the year is a collaboration by performers who are not
normally partners.
   ``I'm excited about getting nominated with daddy,'' Williams said
after the finalists were announced. Williams, using recording
technology, sang with his father on ``There's a Tear in My Beer.''
   Shelton, a former pipe fitter, rounded out his nominations in the
top album category for ``Loving Proof'' and in the single of the
year category for ``I'll Leave This World Loving You.''
   Crowell, the husband of Rosanne Cash and son-in-law of country
music ``Man in Black'' Johnny Cash, also was a finalist in three
categories based on his self-penned hit record ``After All This
Time.'' They are single of the year, No. 1 music video and song of
the year. The single of the year is an award for a performer and
song of the year is an award for a songwriter.
   ``My main motivating factor is to do good work and cultivate an
attitude so my work evolves to a better place,'' Crowell said by
telephone from Los Angeles after learning of the nominations.
   Whitley, who died of an accidental overdose of liquor May 9, also
was voted a finalist for the Horizon Award for career development
and single of the year for ``I'm No Stranger to the Rain.''
   Completing the finalists for single of the year were ``A Better
Man'' by Black and ``Chiseled in Stone'' by Vern Gosdin.
   Other finalists for No. 1 album were ``Beyond the Blue Neon'' by
Strait, ``Old 8x10'' by Travis, ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken Vol.
11'' by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and ``Willow in the Wind'' by
Mattea.
   The mother-daughter duo the Judds, voted either duo or group of
the year for four straight years, were a finalist for top duo again.
But they were not voted a finalist for entertainer of the year, the
top honor and an award they have never won.
   Winners and finalists are chosen by the 5,469 voting members of
the association.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 8th graf pvs, `The show's ..., to UPDATE

   Actress Amanda Blake, who as Miss Kitty
reigned for 19 years as the queen of Dodge City's Long Branch Saloon
in the TV series ``Gunsmoke,'' died after a long battle with cancer.
She was 60.
   Miss Blake died Wednesday night at Mercy General Hospital, said
hospital spokeswoman Jerri Ewen.
   ``She was a beautiful and gracious lady who had a lot to do with
the success of `Gunsmoke,''' series star James Arness said Thursday.
``We were a family together. There are a lot of people for whom
`Gunsmoke' had a special meaning, and they will be sharing the
memories today.''
   The actress had surgery for oral cancer in 1977, and later
appeared throughout the country for two years on behalf of the
American Cancer Society. She was once a two-pack-a-day smoker.
   In 1984, the Cancer Society gave her its annual Courage Award,
which was presented in the Oval Office by President Reagan.
   Miss Blake left ``Gunsmoke'' in 1974 after 19 years. The show
lasted one more season on CBS, then was canceled.
   Set in the lawless cattle town of Dodge City, Kan., in the late
1800s, ``Gunsmoke'' was one of television's original ``adult
westerns'' _ more violent, saltier and sexier than the cowboy fare
offered young viewers in the mid-1950s.
   The show's original cast starred Arness as Marshal Matt Dillon,
Dennis Weaver as his limping deputy, Chester Goode, Milburn Stone as
``Doc'' Adams and Miss Blake as Kitty Russell, the throaty-voiced
owner of the Long Branch.
   ``I loved her very much,'' Weaver said. ``She was very talented
and a real joy for me to work with.''
   There was a love interest between the red-haired Kitty Russell
character and Arness' Marshal Dillon, but the writers kept it off
screen.
   ``We keep it very subtle,'' she said in a 1962 interview. ``We
let people let their imagination do what they want them to do.
Actually, I love the scenes where all we do is, as Jim says,
`eyeball it.'''
   Gunsmoke's story lines softened when it was moved in 1961 from
its late Saturday night time slot to early Monday or Tuesday nights.
Miss Kitty was no longer a potential rape victim of leering bad
guys. Instead, she was abducted a lot.
   ``Good Lord, have I been kidnapped!'' she said in 1968. ``I'm
sick and tired of it. The writers claim I can't be in jeopardy as
long as I'm in town _ because Matt would protect me. So they keep
having me kidnapped.''
   After ``Gunsmoke,'' she worked only sporadically, usually in
guest appearances for TV game shows, movies of the week and such
series as ``Edge of Night,'' ``Hart to Hart,'' and ``Love Boat.''
   Miss Blake, born Beverly Louise Neill in Buffalo, N.Y., made her
dramatic debut as a 10-year-old in a school pageant. She signed a
contract with MGM while still in her teens, and her first film role
was in the 1950 film, ``Stars in My Crown.''
   Besides her work for the American Cancer Society, Miss Blake was
a longtime activist for animal protection.
   A statement issued through the hospital requested that memorials
be sent to the Amanda Blake Memorial Fund at Farmers and Merchants
Bank in Galt. Funeral plans were pending. Miss Blake had no children.

   Marcia Whitney Schott, a prominent owner of race
horses for nearly 30 years, died Thursday of cancer. She was 66.
   Mrs. Schott was ``a gracious and elegant lady who had won wide
respect in the American world of horse racing,'' said Joe Hirsch,
executive columnist of the Daily Racing Form.
   Among her top horses were Willow Hour, winner of the Travers
Stakes at Saratoga in 1981; Kilts n' Kapers, winner of the Monmouth
Oaks in 1970; and Answer, winner of the Oak Leaf Stakes in 1975 and
the Hollywood Oaks in 1976.
   Mrs. Schott, an interior designer, is survived by her husband,
Lewis, three children and three grandchildren.

<HEAD>Inmates Found Guilty In Youth Kidnapping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCALA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two inmates were convicted Thursday of
abducting a high school honor student who said he decided not to
contact authorities or try to flee because ``it didn't seem like the
right thing to do.''
   The six-member Marion Circuit Court jury deliberated about four
hours before finding inmates Patrick Paige, 21, and Anthony Cokley,
23, guilty of one count each of kidnapping and robbery.
   Circuit Judge Ray McNeal sentenced both men to 30 years in prison
for the robbery and life imprisonment for the Jan. 3 kidnapping of
17-year-old Ted Siegel.
   During the three-day trial, the jury heard conflicting testimony
on whether the youth willingly assisted in the flight.
   Paige and Cokley went on an 11-day crime spree up the East Coast
before they were captured in Utah on Jan. 18, four days after Siegel
was released in Baltimore.
   On Thursday, Paige said he talked Siegel into driving the pair
from the Ocala area and the teen was never kidnapped. But Siegel
said he was abducted outside his family's Lowell horse farm after
Cokley choked him unconscious.
   In more than five hours of testimony Wednesday, Siegel said there
were several times along the trip when he could have fled or called
for help. But he decided not to contact authorities because he did
not feel threatened and he was worried about his mother's car.
   ``It didn't seem like the right thing to do,'' the Ocala high
school student told Assistant Public Defender Ed Bonnett. The youth
also said he helped the inmates carry goods stolen in burglaries.
   Siegel called home on Jan. 4 from the outskirts of Atlanta when
Paige suggested it, Siegel said.
   Paige claimed he and Cokley snuck out of the Marion Correctional
Institution to visit inmates at a nearby women's facility. They
decided to flee the state after they could not get back inside the
prison.
   Paige said they encountered Siegel outside a convenience store
near his home and convinced the youth they were fleeing drug dealers
and needed a ride to safety.
   After Siegel drove the pair to Gainesville, Paige said he
admitted they were escaped prisoners.
   ``I leveled with him because I felt I owed it to him to tell him
because he gave us a ride,'' Paige testified. ``At that point he
said he was going to help us out.''
   In July, Paige and Cokley were sentenced to 30 years each in
prison after pleading guilty to escape charges.

<DATELINE>BAYT YAHUN, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Lebanese fleeing war-torn
Beirut on Thursday reached this checkpoint on the border of Israel's
self-designated security zone in southern Lebanon.
   ``We all live in fear, and shells keep falling around,'' said
21-year-old Lina Baydoun. ``It makes no difference whether we are
Shiites or Christians, we all suffer.''
   Ms. Baydoun, a physics student at Beirut's American University,
is among more than 25,000 refugees who have escaped to this area
since artillery duels between Syrian forces and Gen. Michel Aoun's
Christian troops began in March.
   By Lebanese police count, at least 776 people have died and 2,076
wounded in the confrontation.
   Foreign and Israeli reporters, on a tour of the Bayt Yahun
checkpoint, five miles north of Israel, saw at least 300 Lebanese
who arrived from Beirut Thursday.
   Most of them said they live in the security zone, a
six-to-10-mile wide belt along the border that Israel carved out in
1985 after withdrawing most of its troops from Lebanon following a
three-year occupation.
   Others own a second house in the zone, and still others said they
would stay with relatives there until the latest round of fighting
ends.
   Adnan Bazzi, a social worker, said he and his relatives have
recently made at least 10 trips to Beirut and back, checking if
their Beirut house was damaged in the shelling.
   ``Every day shells are falling on our houses,'' he said. ``I have
never seen so much shelling, and it continues into the night. Some
shells even pierce the underground (bomb shelters).''
   Some of the refugees settle in abandoned houses in the area,
Israeli army officers said.
   The Lebanese arrived carrying their luggage. They were not
allowed to bring in their vehicles for fear of suicide car bomb
attacks like the Aug. 9 incident in which five Israeli soldiers and
an allied militiaman were wounded.
   The extremist Shiite Moslem Hezbollah group claimed
responsibility in the bombing, which it said was in retaliation for
Israel's July 28 kidnapping of a Shiite cleric from south Lebanon.
   Reporters were ordered to wear bulletproof vests and helmets as
their convoy, accompanied by an Israeli armoured personnel carrier
and military jeeps, crossed into southern Lebanon.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking at an army base on the
Israeli side of the border, told reporters that 90 percent of the
refugees were Shiites, but said he believed they sought refuge.
   ``I believe that they realize the stability, the relative
tranquility in the security zone,'' he said, ``and they prefer to
find a refuge either in the security zone or in its vicinity in
southern Lebanon.''

<HEAD>Military Head Says U.S.-Soviet Relations In ``Uneasy Transition''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although the Soviet Union seems sincere in
seeking better relations with the United States, the superpowers
must survive an ``uneasy transition'' before the Cold War truly
thaws, the nation's top military adviser said Thursday.
   ``I am persuaded that we are entering a period of uneasy
transition which will hopefully lead to a new era in the superpower
relationship,'' said Adm. William J. Crowe, Jr., chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``But there are many uncertainties still on the horizon, and my
assessment is that we may be in this unsettled state for a long
time, even though that is not comforting,'' he said.
   Crowe is retiring Sept. 30 after 42 years in the Navy, including
four as chief military adviser to the President, the Secretary of
Defense and the National Security Council.
   He said the U.S. government and people must ``keep cool'' in the
face of numerous troop and arms reduction proposals from Moscow.
   ``My deepest concern is that our own impatience, American
impatience, might tempt us to move prematurely ... with broad leaps
of hope and faith, when we encounter inevitable frustration with the
pace of bilateral developments,'' Crowe said. ``We just must be
patient. My own reading of Americans is that they don't like to wait
... they want a better world and they want it tomorrow.''
   Crowe, who in June became the first Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman to review Soviet domestic military forces, said he is
convinced Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to
liberalize his country, but may have underestimated the time and
effort ``perestroika'' and ``glasnost'' require.
   Crowe said problems that plague the Russian economic, political
and social scenes extend to its military _ and the people's
expectations of Gorbachev make solutions even more critical.
   ``They realize that they must improve the quality of consumer
goods and services available to the Soviet people as a whole,''
Crowe said. ``In turn, those aims suggest they must somehow reduce
the enormus military burdens on their economy.''
   Although some cuts have been made in the Soviet military,
Gorbachev believes defense must be the top priority, Crowe said.
Even with further reducation, the Soviets would still have more than
four million troops and hold the largest inventory of military
hardware.
   ``Moreover, other elements of Soviet power remain untouched by
reductions announced thus far, including military activities in
space, strategic forces _ mainly nuclear _ and defensive forces, air
defense units, naval combatants, and strategic mobility assets,''
Crowe said.
   After the speech, Crowe urged military restraint against
terrorists, saying the military ``is built for one thing and we're
trying to apply it to another.''
   Answering questions from members of the Japan-America Society of
Honolulu, which sponsored the speech, Crowe said ``we could level
Beirut'' but that would not solve the problem.
   Terrorists holding 16 hostages _ including eight Americans _ in
Beirut ``do not make good military targets'' because they are very
mobile and easily replaced by their sponsors, especially Iran, Syria
and Libya, Crowe said.
   Besides, Crowe said, Americans were not ready to deal with the
repercussions a military strike would bring.
   ``Americans don't want to go to war over terrorism,'' he said.
``What they really want is these problems to go away in a week,
without a lot of energy and investment.''

   Upper level winds weakened an Atlantic tropical
depression to a tropical wave Thursday, forecasters said.
   A tropical storm watch that had been in effect for the Leeward
Islands was discontinued. The islands were expected to receive only
some leftover showers, thunderstorms and gusty winds, said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables.
   Forecasters said the sixth Atlantic depression of the season had
been located Wednesday about 500 miles east of the northern Leeward
Islands, but was weakened significantly by upper level winds late
Wednesday night.
   A depression becomes a named storm if its maximum sustained winds
reach 39 mph. Dean, the second hurricane of the June-to-September
Atlantic season, died earlier this month in the North Atlantic after
causing minor damage in Bermuda.

<HEAD>Pinochet Shuffles Cabinet To Replace Ministers Running For Senate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lame-duck President Augusto Pinochet
appointed five new Cabinet members Thursday in a move prompted by
the resignations of two ministers who plan to run for senator in
December elections.
   The entire 17-man Cabinet resigned Aug. 11 to allow Gen. Pinochet
to decide on the changes but, as expected, the 73-year-old president
and army commander rejected most of the resignations.
   The new ministers were sworn in by Pinochet at noon today.
   The changes were not expected to bring significant political
changes in the 16-year-old military government.
   Among those leaving the Cabinet were the Labor and Public Works
ministers, Guillermo Arthur and retired army Gen. Bruno Siebert, who
have announced plans to run for the Senate, and Economy Minister
Pablo Baraona, who will direct the campaign of Hernan Buchi, the
pro-government presidential candidate.
   Pinochet appointed Maria Teresa Infante, an economist, as the new
labor minister. The new economy minister is Adm. Pedro Larrondo.
Gen. Hernan Abad was named public works minister.
   Pinochet also accepted the resignations of Planning Minister
Sergio Melnick and the government's secretary-general, Gen. Oscar
Vargas.
   Luis Larrain, who was Melnick's deputy at the Planning Ministry,
was promoted to succeed him, while army Col. Cristian Labbe took
over as the new secretary-general.
   No reasons were given for those two changes.
   In the Dec. 14 elections, the first since the bloody 1973 coup
that brought Pinochet to power, Chileans will pick a new president
and Congress.
   Pinochet was obliged to call the election after losing a
referendum last year on a proposal to extend his rule until 1997.
Pinochet was barred by the constitution to run in the December
election.
   The leading presidential candidates are Patricio Aylwin, a
70-year-old former Senate president suported by a coalition of 17
opposition parties, and Buchi, 40, Pinochet's former finance
minister.
   The new president and Congress are to take office on March 11.

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole and Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, his wife, will leave Friday on a visit to
four countries, including Poland, which is undergoing historic
political change.
   In announcing the trip, the minority leader's office said the
pair ``will carry President Bush's greetings to the heads of state
they will meet.''
   The Doles will leave Friday, traveling first to Soviet Armenia.
The Doles will take with them relief and rehabilitation supplies
furnished by Project Hope, a charitable organization.
   The trip to Poland comes at a time when President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and others are involved in
negotiations designed to form a new government led by the
once-banned trade union movement. If that came to pass, Poland would
have the first non-communist government in the Eastern Bloc in 45
years.
   The Doles will meet with a host of Polish figures over a two-day
period, including Jaruzelski and Walesa, Dole's office said. said.
   Besides the meetings with leading Polish figures scheduled for
Thursday and Friday, Mrs. Dole will discuss possible Labor
Department projects as part of the administration's proposed $100
million aid package to Poland.
   The pair will also visit Morocco and will wind up their 10-day
trip Aug. 28 with a trip to The Netherlands and talks with Queen
Beatrix.
   Also visiting the Soviet Union next week will be a congressional
delegation exploring ways of increasing U.S. agricultural exports to
the Soviets.
   Leading the delegation will be Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
who said the visit would let the Americans ``see first-hand the
progress of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms.''
   ``The Soviet Union is one of our most important agricultural
export markets, and we want to explore ways to increase our
agricultural trade. We will also discuss the possibility of new
cooperative agreements that would help the Soviet Union improve its
entire agricultural sector,'' de la Garza said.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Legislation to Speed Up Sale of State Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress approved a bill Thursday
to speed the sale of dozens of state companies, giving President
Carlos Menem his first legislative victory.
   Losses by state companies have produced huge deficits and pushed
inflation.
   The legislation, which takes effect immediately and lasts for 180
days, transfers from Congress to Menem the authority to sell state
companies. The legislation, drafted by Menem's Cabinet, can be
renewed once for an additional 180 days.
   ``A very important step has been taken toward re-establishing the
republic'' on a basis that will allow economic growth, Interior
Minister Eduardo Bauza said.
   Two television stations in the capital will be sold within two
months, according to a presidential decree. Next in line are the
state telephone company and airline, Aerolineas Argentinas,
government officials said.
   Menem was elected on May 14 amid economic crisis. After taking
office in July, Menem said state companies should be sold to cut the
drag on the economy and promote foreign investment and growth.
   The cost of living soared 196.6 percent last month. At least 14
percent of Argentines are unemployed or underemployed, and wages
fell by 60 percent during the first six months of this year.
   Operating losses this year at the several hundred state companies
are projected at $5.5 billion, or about 7 percent of the gross
domestic product, the Public Works Ministry said in July.
   The state oil company alone is expected to lose $1 billion this
year and the state railway, $500 million.
   The State Reform Law passed Thursday authorizes the sale, partial
sale or co-management with private investors of port facilities,
grain elevators, Buenos Aires' subway, the national ship line,
petrochemical plants and oil fields.
   A companion bill would suspend state subsidies to private
businesses, remove barriers to foreign investment, enforce tax
collection and halt Central Bank bailouts of provincial banks and
state companies.
   Congress was expected to approve that bill next week.
   The decision to sell state companies was a policy reversal for
Menem, whose Peronist Party last year blocked attempts by former
President Raul Alfonsin to implement the same legislation.
   Unions, traditionally the mainstay of the Peronists, fear job and
wage cutbacks. But confronted with economic crisis, they have gone
along with Menem on the issue.
   So far, Menem's economic policy has been almost universally well
received.
   In six weeks, he negotiated voluntary wage and price guidelines,
cut the fiscal deficit by increasing state-controled rates for
public utilities by 600 percent and more, and devalued the austral
currency by 54 percent.
   Inflation for August is expected to be less than one-half July's
rate, according to private as well as government economists. It is
thought the September rate will fall below 10 percent.
   Also Thursday, the car of labor leader Saul Ubaldini was
destroyed by a bomb blast. There were no injuries in the explosion,
directed at the secretary-general of the 3-million-strong General
Labor Confederation.
   No group claimed responsibilty for the explosion. Police said
they were investigating.

   A convicted drug smuggler testified Thursday
that Colombian cocaine traffickers control police and key officials
in a number of countries and once were offered a chance to buy all
the cocaine confiscated in the Bahamas.
   ``We were setting it up but I was arrested,'' Max Mermelstein
testified from behind a screen while six federal bodyguards stood by.
   In an electronically disguised voice, Mermelstein said he had
smuggled up to 55 tons of cocaine into the United States as an
employee of ``the boys from Colombia'' before his arrest in 1985.
   His testimony came at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee
that its chairman, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said was designed to
provide background for the comprehensive drug-fighting blueprint due
from the Bush administration next month.
   Mermelstein told the committee the United States has been
hampered in its effort to fight drug cartels in part ``because we
deal directly with the police and local governments and in South
America that's a direct line to the cartel.''
   Police and public officials except for high-ranking army officers
are brought under control by the cocaine cartel through bribe money
and the threat of murder, Mermelstein said.
   ``They own them,'' Mermelstein said. ``... Either they take the
money or they die.''
   He said such corruption is widespread and, ``in the Bahamas, it
goes all the way to the top.''
   He testified that he was once ``offered a deal by a Bahamian
official of so much per kilo for any cocaine confiscated by the
Bahamian government for distribution in the United States.'' The
committee did not ask the official's name.
   He portrayed cartel leaders as using billions of dollars from
cocaine sales in the United States to pursue a globe-hopping
lifestyle, including frequent visits to the bullfights in Mexico and
Spain. ``Fabio Ochoa considers himself an afficienado and a
first-class bullfighter,'' he said.
   He said members of the Ochoa family, top leaders of one cartel,
were on hand for the last summer's Olympics in South Korea. He said
another cartel kingpin, Pablo Escobar, has easily slipped in and out
of the United States using fake documents.
   A former assistant U.S. attorney in Miami, Richard Gregorie, told
the committee the Customs Service and the Marshals Service developed
a plan to arrest Jorge Ochoa last fall during a trip to Caracas,
Venezuela and fly him to the United States for trial, but the plan
was dropped because of State Department opposition.
   Ochoa has been indicted by U.S. grand juries several times, but
the Colombian Supreme Court abrogated that country's extradition
treaty with the United States two years ago and cannot be arrested
by his country's authorities on a U.S. warrant.
   Mermelstein told the panel how he witnessed a murder in the early
1970s and was ``allowed to live'' on condition that he would work
for the cartel and subsequently imported up to 56 tons of cocaine
into the United States. He was arrested in 1985, served two years in
prison and is now in the government's witness protection program.
   He said cartel leaders have put a seven-figure price on his head.
   In other testimony, Robert W. Merkle, a former U.S. attorney in
Tampa, told the committee that Colombia has ``a government that is
in many respects a hostage of the criminal element in its midst.''
   ``This is not surprising given the fact that the narco-terrorists
are responsible for the assassination of scores of judges,
journalists, police officers and innocent civilians in a campaign of
total intimidation,'' he said. He said the Peruvian government has
been hobbled by leftist rebels who obtained an estimated $500
million last year through drug trafficking.
   He also said Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega ``maintains his
power and his control through alliance with narcotics.''

   Colombia's judges went on strike and
threatened to resign Thursday to protest security conditions after
the slaying of a court magistrate who had ruled against two leaders
of the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Union leaders met in emergency session Thursday in response to a
wave of shooting deaths and intimidation of magistrates, said Helmut
Romero, the union's vice president.
   ``In view of the government's inability to protect its judges, we
decided to begin a nationwide indefinite strike and intend to offer
our collective resignation,'' Romero said.
   He did not say when that would happen.
   Police announced late Thursday that 51 people were arrested and
$7.7 million in cash and gold bars were seized in a nationwide
sweep. Police spokesman Alfredo Salgado also said about 50
submachine guns, revolvers, pistols and hand grenades were also
seized since Wednesday.
   Late Wednesday, gunmen on two motorcycles and in a taxi opened
fire with with machine guns on Magistrate Carlos Valencia Garcia,
43, as he left his office in central Bogota.
   Valencia Garcia, who had rejected court motions to exonerate two
leaders of the Medellin cartel for their part in the 1987 slaying of
a journalist, was shot six times. He died a short time later at a
hospital.
   Every judge who have investigated cartel leaders Pablo Escobar
Gaviria and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha are either dead, have resigned
or were forced to leave Colombia by death threats.
   Romero called on the government to step up protection of federal
judges involved in drug trials ``because it is not acceptable that a
judge is slain in Colombia every 15 days.''
   Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, the head of Colombia's secret police,
late Wednesday said police would adopt new security measures to
protect judges but refused to say what they were. Maza Marquez last
month escaped an assassination attempt that he attributed to the
cocaine cartel.
   ``The assassination of Valenca Garcia should unite us to look for
ways to combat our common enemy _ drug trafficking,'' Maza Marquez
said following an urgent meeting of the National Security Council.
   Maza Marquez said Valencia Garcia was accompanied by two armed
security guards and was wearing a bulletproof vest when he was shot
and killed.
   Antonio Salom Beltran, president of Colombia's Supreme Court,
said the war against judges had reached an ``intolerable point.''
   In the last 10 years, 23 judges have been assassinated, and
officials blame nearly all the deaths on drug traffickers.
   Three years ago, 12 members of Colombia's Supreme Court were
killed when guerrillas took over the Palace of Justice in Bogota.
The government said rebels were working with drug smugglers and
destroyed hundreds of files on drug trafficking.
   The Medellin cartel, named after the Colombian city where it is
based, is the world's largest cocaine ring. It is believed
responsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine that is smuggled
into the United States.

   The moon blushed in Alabama, turned taupe in Minneapolis, glowed
orange in Maine and Texas, and disappeared altogether in Washington
during a rare ``prime time'' full lunar eclipse that attracted awed
sky watchers from coast to coast.
   Clouds spoiled the view for much of the United States, but where
the skies were clear observers reported a spectacular celestial show
of light and color.
   In the nation's capital, the moon rose as a golden orange, tinted
grayish brown as the eclipse began, then winked out altogether as
the lunar disk swept into the dark inner core of the Earth's shadow.
   ``I finally saw one disappear,'' said Alan Fiala, a Naval
Observatory astronomer who has studied eclipses for 15 years.
   A little girl, watching with her mother in a park in Minneapolis,
also saw it fade from view.
   ``Is the moon going to come back tomorrow?'' she asked.

   Babies may learn to crawl and walk a little slower
if their mothers drink while nursing, according to a study released
today that suggests even small amounts of alcohol in breast milk can
affect development.
   While the results are troubling, experts caution that there is no
clear proof that nursing mothers will harm their babies if they
drink moderately.
   ``I would not worry about drinking during lactation until this
finding has been confirmed in at least one more study,'' said Dr.
Ruth E. Little, principal author of the research report.
   Even if their babies are slow to walk, she said, mothers should
not blame their occasional drinking, because babies normally vary in
when they learn these skills.

   President Bush today begins a
three-week seaside vacation, visiting with family and entertaining
two world leaders away from Washington's summer doldrums.
   Bush arrived here Wednesday, announcing he was aiming to ``get my
body in shape'' with his favorite vacation pastime _ intensive
exercise.
   The president and first lady Barbara Bush were expecting separate
visits from Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Danish Prime
Minister Poul Schluter, but those were to be personal rather than
business-oriented, the White House said.
   Bush flew to this resort town from Miami, where he made a one-day
campaign foray in behalf of Republican congressional candidate
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is vying against Democrat Gerald Richman to
succeed the late Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper.

   Getting a telephone installed by any of the
four strike-bound regional phone companies requires patience, but
officials say customers are having better luck with operator
assistance.
   ``We ask our customers to continue to be patient with us,'' said
Steve Ford, a spokesman for Ameritech, one of the four companies hit
by the 11-day-old strike.
   Recorded messages Wednesday continued to tell 411 directory
assistance callers that ``due to the work stoppage, your call may be
delayed.'' But telephone company officials said the waits are
becoming shorter as management personnel get to know the computer
equipment.
   Operator-assisted calls, maintenance and repairs are being
handled at near pre-strike levels in many areas, officials said.

   Official U.S. displeasure over the Chinese
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement is putting a damper on
departing Ambassador Han Xu's farewell to Washington.
   The most prominent Americans among about 500 guests at Han's
Chinese Embassy reception Wednesday night were retired rather than
active public officials.
   They included two former secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger
and Alexander Haig, and two former Senate leaders, Republican Hugh
Scott and Democrat Mike Mansfield. Also there was former Democratic
Sen. J. William Fulbright.
   The absence of top members of President Bush's administration and
cabinet reflected the president's post-June 3 policy of balancing
U.S. public outrage over the killings of Chinese pro-democracy
demonstrators against the decision to continue dialogue with the
Chinese government.

<HEAD>London Stage Awaits a Star-Filled Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London theatergoers are in for a celebrity-filled
couple of months, as no fewer than seven Oscar and Tony-winning
luminaries take to the stage.
   The starry array should mollify producers who have seen
attendance drop during an unusually hot, humid summer that kept
people away from theaters.
   First out of the gate is Jack Lemmon in ``Veterans Day'' by
American author Donald Freed, which was opened Aug. 22 at the
Theater Royal, Haymarket. It is the two-time Academy Award-winning
actor's first London stage appearance since 1986, when he repeated
his Tony-nominated Broadway performance as James Tyrone in Eugene
O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night.''
   Scheduled to run through Dec. 9, ``Veterans Day'' is about a
White House meeting of three veterans of different American wars.
Michael Gambon and Robert Flemyng complete the cast under Kevin
Billington's direction.
   Next up in September are the almost back-to-back openings of
three shows featuring heavyweight stars.
   Paul Scofield, who won an Oscar and a Tony for his stunning
portrayal of Sir Thomas More in ``A Man for All Seasons,'' returns
to the London stage Sept. 19 for the first time in three years in
Jeffrey Archer's ``Exclusive,'' at the Strand Theater.
   Two esteemed British actors, Alec McCowen and Eileen Atkins,
co-star in the second play by the best-selling novelist and former
politician. The first is his long-running courtoom drama, ``Beyond
Reasonable Doubt.''
   The next night, Sept. 20, sees the long-awaited debut of ``Miss
Saigon,'' the epic musical from Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain
Boublil, the French composer-lyricist team who wrote ``Les
Miserables'' with Herbert Kretzmer.
   Jonathan Pryce, the wiry Welsh actor who won a Tony in Trevor
Griffiths' 1976 play ``Comedians,'' stars in the musical, which has
been three years in pre-production.
   On Sept. 25, Albert Finney, the Oscar-nominated star of ``Tom
Jones'' and ``Murder on the Orient Express,'' opens at Wyndham's
Theater in Ronald Harwood's ``Another Time.''
   The author and his star collaborated on the movie version of
``The Dresser,'' which earned Finney another Oscar nomination. Here,
he plays a South Africa-born, London-based musician facing a midlife
crisis. Janet Suzman and Sara Kestelman co-star.
   Sept. 29 marks the opening of the season's most anticipated
classical revival: Trevor Nunn's staging of Shakespeare's
``Othello,'' with opera singer Willard White as the lovestruck Moor
and Ian McKellen _ the Tony-winning star of Peter Shaffer's
``Amadeus'' _ as the vengeful and jealous Iago.
   This production will arrive in London following a six-week stint
at The Other Place in Shakespeare's birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon,
where it is in previews. The London run ends Nov. 11.
   In 1985, Frances Ruffelle won New York audiences with her
award-winning performance as Eponine in ``Les Miserables.'' She
opens Oct. 17 in her first musical since then: Ian Dury's
``Apples,'' at the Royal Court, set in the world of tabloid
journalism.
   The following night, Peter O'Toole returns to London's commercial
West End in ``Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell'' at the Apollo Theater. The
play, written by Keith Waterhouse and directed by Ned Sherrin, casts
O'Toole as Jeffrey Bernard, the unabashedly dissolute and low-living
columnist for the London weekly magazine, The Spectator.
   Two-time Oscar-winner Glenda Jackson is expected in two
productions next winter: a revival of Edward Albee's ``Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?,'' co-starring John Lithgow, which will first be
seen at the Ahmanson Theater in Los Angeles, and a new play at North
London's ``fringe'' Almeida Theater by leftist author, Howard Barker.
   Although her American exposure is limited, Dame Judi Dench is
among Britain's best-respected actresses, and hopes are high for her
West End engagement in Anton Chekhov's ``The Cherry Orchard.''
Directed by Sam Mendes, the production opens in the fall, date to be
announced, at the Aldwych Theater.

<HEAD>Entertainer Returns To Old Neighborhood To Fight Drugs</HEAD>

   Ben Vereen hit bottom in December 1987, when a
car crash killed his 16-year-old daughter, Naja. He mixed drugs and
alcohol, not caring ``if I woke up or not.'' Another daughter
brought him back from the edge.
   ``Naja wouldn't want you to do this to yourself,'' 18-year-old
Malaika told him.
   ``That got through like a blade _ zap!'' recalled Vereen, 42. ``I
realized I was still here and I had children and they needed me and
how selfish and arrogant of me to try to end my life. So I chose
life.''
   But choosing life _ quitting drugs _ was just the beginning of an
odyssey that took the entertainer back to his Brooklyn neighborhood
and a chance encounter with his homeless, addicted sister, Lucinda
Vereen Batts.
   Lucinda was on the doorstep, pregnant and addicted to crack, when
Vereen returned a year ago to the house his mother left him when she
died in 1984.
   ``I thought at first she was angry at me for the years that we'd
been apart and I looked closer and realized that she was shaking,''
he said. ``I said, `Come honey, it's time to come home.'
   ``It was like a message, like the Lord was just bringing all of
us together. Then I said, `That's it. We're going to duke now.' I
rolled up my sleeves and got in the fight.''
   Now Lucinda, too, is recovering, and Vereen has pledged help win
back his childhood streets in Bedford-Stuyvesant from drug dealers
who had moved into the house that went unattended after his mother
died.
   The plan drew opposition from neighbors who didn't want
recovering addicts on their street, but Vereen wasn't deterred. He
is determined to tear down the house and rebuild it for a drug
program, although he is uncertain of specifics like how many people
it could help or what services would be provided.
   On a recent visit, he noted that Herkimer Street had changed much
in a few decades. Drug dealers had stripped the three-story home of
windows, aluminum siding, even its street numbers. Pigeons flew in
and out.
   ``I am stunned,'' said Vereen, who had lived there from ages 11
to 18 with his two sisters, long before dreams of stardom became
reality _ a Tony award for his role in ``Pippin,'' acclaim for the
TV miniseries ``Roots,'' and standing-room-only performances in Las
Vegas.
   He stood silently and stared for a long moment. ``This is the
before. You can get the after pictures in a year or two,'' he said
finally.
   ``This hasn't discouraged me at all. As a matter of fact, it has
encouraged me. When you see that people have to steal the aluminum
off of a building to get drugs, you've got to really get angry and
get involved.''
   Within 100 feet was an open lot with abandoned trucks, cars and
garbage. Just as someone might point out daffodils or weeds in a
lawn, Lucinda described the lot where she had spent the most tragic
moments of her last four years.
   ``That's part of the lot where we'd stay when I was getting high.
That's where I found my friend dead. He got crushed stealing parts
from under a car. I happened to go through there and found his body
up under the car, under the rim where the tires had set on his chest.
   ``All of us crack users used to come here in this lot. We'd sleep
in these,'' she said, pointing to abandoned vehicles. ``They had a
lot of homeless out here in the lot. Some still stay out here, still
sleep out here in the trucks.''
   Vereen said he feels blessed that work ``kept me camouflaged''
and off the streets during his addiction. He began experimenting in
the 1960s, when ``it was cool to do drugs or smoke marijuana, take
acid or things like that.''
   ``If you're going to run with the crowd then you're going to do
what the crowd does,'' he said. ``Then all of a sudden it becomes
more than cool. It becomes dangerous. It got dangerous for me in
June of '87. After I lost my daughter in December I lost it
completely and I got really bad.
   ``I was so depressed I kept crying and I got real funky. I
remember doing a film in Italy and I'd get up and put on my clothes
and they would stink. I was sitting on the set and smelling this
odor and I'd go, `Man, that's not like me.' And I looked in the
mirror and I couldn't recognize myself.''
   He often thought about killing himself and began mixing drugs and
alcohol. ``Why I didn't oust out of here the Lord only knows.''
   Now, Vereen and his sister look ahead.
   Lucinda stays at the Vereen home in Englewood, N.J., along with
Vereen's wife, Nancy, and their two daughters, Kabara, 14, and
Karon, 13. Their other children are Malaika and Benji, 23.
   Vereen, now a national spokesman for the campaign for ``A Drug
Free America,'' hopes to donate his childhood home to that cause.
``You've got to dream big. I will get it done, some way, somehow.
   ``I've started this fight and I'm not going to walk away from
it.''

<HEAD>`Breaking Point' Pointless Remake of 1964's `36 Hours'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The TNT movie ``Breaking Point'' is a remake
of the 1964 film ``36 Hours,'' starring James Garner and Eva Marie
Saint.
   The question is, why?
   Granted, the premise of the World War II thriller is intriguing _
the Nazis capture a U.S. intelligence officer and try to trick him
into thinking he's in a hospital suffering amnesia and the war is
over, so he'll reveal when and where the Allied invasion of Europe
is to take place.
   But it is certainly dated. And no matter how interesting the
premise, the story doesn't work if the viewers don't care what
happens to the characters. As weakly written as they are, they
aren't helped by a cast list that is an eery vision of
weeknight-on-the-dinner-theater-circuit.
   ``Breaking Point'' premieres tonight and is repeated Saturday and
Sunday.
   Corbin Bernsen, who does an admirable job of playing a crass,
shallow divorce lawyer on ``L.A. Law,'' would have been more
convincing as one of the Nazis. His Maj. Jefferson Pike comes off as
a vacuous dilettante who looks like he'd be much more comfortable
shopping for sweaters at Saks than plotting some nasty old invasion
of Normandy.
   The grinding wheels of the plot are set in motion when Pike goes
to an unexplained meeting with a unsavory character at a Lisbon bar,
drinks spiked espresso and is plucked off the sidewalk by the Nazis,
allowing director Peter Markle to ignore the plodding script for a
while and engage in some arty slo-mo and black-and-white photography.
   After a wee bit of electro-shock torture, which causes Pike to
grimace and perspire, he wakes up in a pleasant rest home surrounded
by seeming Yanks. The date on the newspaper is convincing enough,
but Pike is suspicious when everyone is vague on the identity of the
mayor of Chicago and who won the World Series.
   Joanna Pacula, who is making a career of TV World War II dramas
(``Crossings,'' ``Escape from Sobibor''), plays Anna, the German
nurse enlisted to entice Pike into spilling the beans, because she
looks exactly like the wife the Nazis have told him is dead. No
wonder she and his wife look alike. She plays both of them. If not
for this amazing circumstance, the rest of the story would have been
tragically lost to posterity.
   Pike, aided by the miracle of flashbacks, figures out the Nazi
game. He confirms his suspicions by tripping Anna up with a bit of
clever dialogue, something about a paper cut received recently in
London _ A-ha! We're supposed to be in occupied Germany! Understand,
this not exactly a battle of wits between two mental giants.
   Only the stalwart John Glover (``David'') inspires any interest,
playing Gerber, the Nazi doctor who hatches the brainwashing plot.
   As a potential footnote for the annals of bizarre casting, the
preppy-looking David Marshall Grant (``thirtysomething'') plays a
Nazi commandant. His presence must satisfy some behind-the-scenes
debt we aren't aware of. His only plot purpose seems to be to menace
the proceedings by expressing whining doubts about the validity of
Dr. Gerber's experiment. Not exactly the stuff of razor-edged
suspense.
   Unlike the 1964 film, ``Breaking Point'' ends with a cynical
twist, which might have played on a work of contemporary fiction,
but isn't particularly compelling as part of a historical drama.
Most viewers do know we won the war, don't they?
   Despite some wonderfully inane dialogue _ eg., Dr. Gerber: ``You
won't have to sleep with Major Pike again.'' Nurse Anna, with
straight face: ``Thank you, sir.'' _ the breaking point for most
viewers will come about 10 minutes into the film.

   THE U.S.-CANADA BORDER ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN (AP) _ The water in Lake
Champlain, knowing no national boundaries, flows freely between
Canada and the United States. So do hundreds of boaters, to the
chagrin of customs agents.
   ``A border is a border, whether it is the land, the air or the
lake,'' said Jean Paul Barriere, who runs the Canadian port of entry.
   Without a summer cruising permit, those leaving the cottage-lined
beaches on Missisquoi Bay in Venice en Quebec are supposed to stop
at the U.S. Customs Service house in Alburg Springs, which is all
but impossible to reach by water.
   It was slightly easier to get to Canadian Customs. Boaters could
stop at a dock just over the border and call officials in nearby
Phillipsburg.
   Until this year, boaters going in and out of the bay jutting into
Quebec from Vermont missed or ignored the notch in the trees that
marks the line. Last year all but five ``were forgetting about
reporting,'' said Barriere, laughing.
   To encourage respect for the border, Canada set up a floating
immigration station, a 20-by-40-foot blue and orange barge officials
say is a first.
   On a sunny day in the middle of the week, Canadian Customs
Officer Jean Pierre Fortin logged 11 boats crossing by early
afternoon. He has counted more than 1,000 since he took up his post
in a boat near the barge June 21.
   Fortin isn't necessarily looking for drug runners or illegal
aliens, though he's prepared for both. He also keeps watch for
people trying to escape paying Canadian taxes on boats by buying
them in the United States and taking them through the bay instead of
hauling them by land through customs stations.
   His main reason for floating in the bay is to make an afternoon
outing more pleasant by giving cruisers an easy way to report to
customs. Canadian officers are on the barge between 11 a.m. and 7
p.m. until mid-September.
   But for those who want to escape the bay for the open lake on the
Vermont side, getting to U.S. Customs remains a trial, and sometimes
a game of chicken.
   Two power boats, with Canadians aboard, stop at Fortin's post,
though technically they need only report at the U.S. station. One
couple already has a summer permit to take their boat as far south
as St. Albans Bay without a stop on each trip. But their son and a
friend, in the second boat, don't.
   ``Are the police down there?'' the father asks. Fortin doesn't
tell.
   The U.S. customs house is within sight, but the shallow water and
rocky beach pose a greater risk than the agents; both boats whizz
past.
   Fortin shrugs. He knows the boaters, and he isn't surprised they
took a chance for an afternoon's spin on the lake.
   But taking the chance, and perhaps being confronted by imposing
agents in uniform, is just the situation Thomas Ducharme, owner of
the growing Champlain Marina and a boat dealership, wants his
customers to avoid. U.S. officials are hard on Canadians, he says,
and difficulty reporting has cost him customers.
   When Ducharme opened his marina three years ago, he renewed a
local push for a dock at the U.S. house. But the bay was too shallow
and the idea grew for the floating station and Fortin's boat, which
is docked at Ducharme's marina.
   ``I did it for my pocket. I want my customers to cross the border
without any trouble,'' Ducharme said, adding that to go by the book,
he must take his customers overland to the U.S. station before
sending them off for the day.
   Tim Moran, assistant district director of the U.S. Customs
Service in St. Albans, acknowleges ``that the honest traveler would
be less apprehensive about crossing the border if they had a place
to check in.''
   An invitation to share the barge came too late for this year, but
U.S officials want to see how it works. The crossings logged by the
Canadians are more than Moran had expected, but numbers alone won't
justify a U.S. presence.
   ``It would be a balancing between the numbers and the perceived
threat,'' he said, adding that there is ``some smuggling activity on
the lake.''
   Earlier this month, the U.S. Coast Guard and customs officials
tied up at the barge to search boats under the Bush administration's
``zero tolerance'' drug policy. The six-hour duty brought the first
arrest of the season, a Quebec man on whose boat inspectors
allegedly found eight grams of marijuana.
   Fortin taps a pen on his log. Eleven boats have passed and he'll
radio Alburg Springs with an update. ``It's a big favor we're doing
them,'' he said.
   ``It is a big favor,'' agreed Noel Induni, of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service in St. Albans. ``The minute
you put someone there, it doesn't matter (if it) is a Canadian
officer, you get compliance.''

   In the arcane world of food additive
regulation, tolerance is a finely used term, but it boils down to
what parents of 2-year-olds learn quickly: It's how much you let 'em
get away with.
   For example, some chemicals are banned entirely by federal
regulations from the nation's food supply because they have been
shown to cause cancer, genetic deformities or other health problems.
   Other chemicals, synthetic or natural, are prohibited if their
``residues'' in food exceed certain ``tolerance'' levels. These
tolerances depend on the chemicals involved and how they measure up
to federal criteria.
   Chemical residues in food cover a wide range of items, including
fruits, vegetables, meat, milk, poultry and eggs. And they also
involve residues from man-made chemicals such as DDT (banned years
ago) and naturally occurring substances such aflatoxin.
   One of the major sources of food contamination is the array of
pesticides used on crops to control insect pests, plant diseases and
weeds. It's a problem for both domestic producers and foreign
growers who ship produce to the U.S. market.
   Two Agriculture Department economists, Catherine Greene and Glenn
Zepp, say that American consumers are eating more fruits and
vegetables _ and are getting more persnickety about the health
effects of chemical residues on produce.
   Greene and Zepp, writing in the National Food Review, a quarterly
USDA magazine, noted 1988 industry figures showing that nearly 18
percent of consumers polled said they were concerned enough by the
possible effects of residues to change their buying habits.
   The survey, conducted by The Packer, a produce industry magazine,
showed that another 64 percent were concerned but had not altered
their buying habits. Only about 19 percent said they were not very
worried.
   According to Greene and Zepp, consumers ``may be wary of the
effectiveness of current food safety regulations.''
   For example, they said in their report, when small groups of
Redbook magazine readers were asked about food safety, only 7
percent of those who replied said they trusted current laws to
guarantee a safe food supply. Seventy percent said they did not.
   ``Few consumers appreciate the scope of the U.S. food regulatory
system _ the inspection and testing procedures for monitoring food
production, processing and marketing, which has generally given
Americans a safe food supply,'' the report said. ``Also new steps
are being taken to improve monitoring a fill the gaps in pesticide
regulation.''
   Although more than a dozen federal agencies have a hand in the
regulation of produce quality, safety, appearance, freshness,
labeling, marketing and imports, only two are involved in pesticide
enforcement.
   The Environmental Protection Agency determines which pesticides
may be registered for use on food crops. The EPA also sets
tolerances for those chemicals in fruits, vegetables and other foods
for human consumption.
   Food and Drug Administration officials monitor and enforce the
pesticide tolerances set by EPA on both domestic and imported
products.
   The Agriculture Department has charge of the inspection of meat
and poultry and processed food items containing those products.
   Greene and Zepp noted that Congress last year amended the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, which requires that
pesticides be registered with EPA for legal use on food crops.
   The amendments include a 1997 deadline for testing,
re-registration and possible cancellation of older chemicals, and a
faster track for registering new chemicals.
   One of the basic problems in the government's registration
process for pesticides used on food crops has been the rapid growth
in the consumption of some fruits and vegetables.
   In other words, chemical tolerance set years ago were based
partly on lower consumption rates of certain food items. That raises
the possibility that residue intake by consumers is understated.
   ``For example,'' the report said, ``average consumption of fresh
honeydew, broccoli and tomatoes increased from 1.1, 1.1 and 12.6
pounds per person, respectively, in 1976 to 2.4, 3.3 and 16.8 pounds
in 1987.
   ``Some of the pesticides used on these vegetables were registered
prior to these consumption gains.''
   The report added that certain age groups eat larger amounts of
some fruits and vegetables than the average on which the residue
intake is estimated _ which also could cause residue intake being
understated.
   Another flaw is that EPA's tolerance-setting system ``does not
consider the health effects of consuming several pesticides
simultaneously, which may or may not be greather than the sum of the
risks from exposure to the residues individually,'' the report said.
   Legislative pressure continues to build on Capitol Hill to ban
unsafe pesticides and strengthen EPA's tolerance procedures.
   Among the measures are food safety amendments introduced by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., which
would require EPA to establish residue tolerances for different
population groups, such as infants and children.

   The young man stood staring straight ahead.
``Police followed me,'' he hissed through nearly closed lips.
   Another meeting gone awry.
   Hours later, at a new place, he explained.
   ``Police came to my house and arrested me. They held me 10 days.
I'm still under investigation. I'm afraid my work unit may fire me
because of it. I want to leave the country.''
   There was quiet defiance in his manner _ defiance of the official
line, as expressed in the People's Daily, that China's young people
should ``uphold the Communist Party leadership, wholeheartedly serve
the people and struggle hard'' and that they should renounce
``bourgeois-liberal'' _ meaning Western _ culture.
   On another night, more than 100 people, mostly in their 20s,
gathered at a private bar for an ear-thumping, rock 'n' roll party.
   So much for renouncing bourgeois-liberal culture.
   Although swept off Tiananmen Square by the army the night of June
3-4, the student democracy movement now is an undercurrent, roiling
out of sight of officialdom.
   Two months into the Communist Party's biggest purge in more than
a decade, a final effort by China's aging revolutionaries to
preserve their Marxist-Maoist dream, the younger generation has
tuned the government out, quietly ignoring a re-education program
launched after Tiananmen.
   Many Chinese foreigners get to talk to, including some over 30,
say they did not bother to watch the latest government television
documentary on the seven-week student movement that the government
denounces as counter-revolutionary.
   Discreetly, many seek out foreigners in Beijing for information
or just to talk.
   A shopkeeper, tossing a basin of water out his door and seeing a
foreigner, beckoned: ``Please come in and have some tea.''
   A park worker, walking home after an ideological study session
that claimed the West was trying to colonize China, sat on a bench
next to a foreigner and struck up a conversation.
   A young woman selling clothing eagerly pulled a foreigner into
her tiny stall.
   Like the others, she brought up June 3-4.
   ``The government says no one died in Tiananmen Square. But we
hear on the Voice of America that many people died. We don't believe
our own government.
   ``Can you tell me what is true?''
   The news that went out around the world from Beijing that night
and the days following was that the government sent an estimated
150,000 soldiers into Beijing to crush the students' democracy
movement. Hundreds, possibly thousands of people, were killed in two
days of street fighting between soldiers with tanks and guns and
civilians with stones and Molotov cocktails.
   The Chinese have other questions when they meet up with
foreigners: Is it true student leader Wang Dan has been arrested?
(He was arrested July 2 but the government did not announce it until
Aug. 17.) How many student leaders escaped? (Fewer than a dozen.)
Will President Bush impose more sanctions on China? (He says no.)
   They also turn to foreigners to pour out bitterness they dare not
express to a fellow Chinese.
   A taxi driver: ``China is still ruled by emperors.'' Told to an
unsympathetic ear, that remark could mean police interrogation and a
black mark in his file.
   In the aftermath of Tiananmen, the government arrested thousands
of people, executed at least 12 and sentenced others to life in
prison. It has terrorized the intellectual community by purging the
most open-minded and most creative government advisers, writers and
academics.
   (Li Lu, a 23-year-old student leader who has fled China, told
reporters Aug. 17 in Geneva, where he had addressed a U.N. human
rights panel, that 120,000 people had been arrested since June and
that some of them had been secretly executed. ``Most of the Chinese
people continue to support the students,'' Li said. ``They give me
every kind of information. For security reasons, I cannot name the
sources but the information is reliable.'')
   The government has installed cameras along streets throughout
Beijing, their long necks occasionally swiveling from side to side.
Three cameras watch the Friendship Store, which the government runs
for foreigners.
   It has hung banners praising the ``great and glorious'' Communist
Party from hotels and government buildings and filled the newspapers
with editorials and columns maintaining that the democracy movement
was a Western-aided plot to turn China into a ``vassal state.''
   It has televised book burnings, with officials setting fire to
hundreds of books said to be reactionary or obscene.
   But the government has failed to get all the people to listen, to
believe or to participate.
   The party's anti-bourgeois liberalism campaign is being ignored
like a television show with the sound turned off.
   Ten years of contact with the outside world, encouraged by senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's policy of promoting rapid development, have
changed China to the point where old totalitarian methods no longer
work to the fullest, as they did in the past.
   Deng was respected as a reformer when he began his rule in 1978.
But now, as millions of people nationwide are required to study his
words, and movies and books about him proliferate, his prestige
could hardly be lower.
   ``We just string together words from Deng's speech,'' a Chinese
reporter said of his office's mandatory twice-weekly sessions to
study Deng. Each person must make a statement, he said, but ``it's
not necessary to be enthusiastic.''
   Small numbers of Chinese in Beijing meet in secret to discuss
goals of democratic change, but say they have no plans for immediate
action.
   In most cases, derision or anonymous defiance are the weapons now.
   ``All of these things will be answered for,'' reads a piece of
graffito spray-painted in English on a subway station. Police,
apparently uncomprehending, have not washed it off.
   At viewings of a new movie lionizing Deng as a young Red Army
guerrilla leader, audiences laugh when the young Deng declares:
``What I say goes.''
   ``Even back then he had to have his way,'' said woman who saw the
movie.
   After the top leaders pledged to wipe out corruption, it turned
out that the sons and daughters of some of them were involved. A
ditty began making the rounds about them: ``The junior official will
wear handcuffs, the middle-level official will make a self-criticism
and the top guy will make a report.''
   Even university students, who are now being watched more closely
and given more intensive political education than any other group,
have dared to show their anger over being punished for protesting.
   One night in late July, several hundred graduates at Beijing
University, a center of dissidence in the spring, gathered on campus
and began beating pots and pans, shouting sarcastically, ``Long live
the Communist Party.''
   The government caught the sarcasm and withheld the diploma of the
alleged ringleader.
   More than anything, ordinary Chinese look to foreign investment
and foreign ideas to open up their one-party system to allow freedom
of speech and the press.
   ``You are our hope,'' a student told a foreigner.
   Said the park worker to the foreigner on the park bench: ``We
need foreign governments to help us make revolution.''

   The Chinese leadership's crackdown on dissent
since early June would not be so startling if it did not follow one
of Communist China's most lively periods of debate in the arts and
social sciences.
   Early this year, for example, the prestigious China Art Gallery
in Beijing allowed controversial exhibits of nude paintings and of
avant-garde art, at which a young artist shot her own work with a BB
gun to show her rejection of Chinese culture.
   Young economists developed schemes for distributing state-owned
factories to the workers in hopes of stimulating productivity and
cutting workers' dependence on the state.
   Government television aired a documentary that challenged
cherished notions of the superiority of traditional Chinese
civilization and denounced the Great Wall as a symbol of all that is
insular and backward in China.
   Such new ideas were silenced by the gunfire in Tiananmen Square
in June.
   Since then party officials have demanded that the entire nation
``unify thinking'' by studying the speeches of top leaders in
defense of the crackdown.
   Here are some examples of unorthodox thinking that preceded the
crackdown, and what is being said now:
   _A banner carried by reporters from the Communist Party
newspaper, the People's Daily, on May 4: ``We want to speak the
truth.'' A People's Daily article July 30 about ``certain erroneous
views'' in Chinese journalism: ``Different classes and different
social groups have different standards of so-called truth,
objectivity and fairness.'' The main role of the media is to be a
``party mouthpiece.''
   _Wang Renzhi, head of the Communist Party's Propaganda
Department, speaking at a national arts conference May 20, 1988:
``China's art and literature should embrace various concepts and
forms. ... From now on ... the party will get involved as little as
possible in art creation, performances and controversies.'' Wang,
meeting with artists and writers July 7: ``We should earnestly fight
against bourgeois liberalism in literary and art circles and make
socialist literature and art dominate.''
   _Social scientist Wu Jiaxiang, writing in December in the
now-closed World Economic Herald of Shanghai: ``The insecurities and
fear small private business people have that the government policies
may change some day should be allayed with theoretical guarantees as
well as specific measures.'' The China Daily newspaper July 30:
``Private business people, whose wealth is displayed by their
private cars, expensive imported clothes and gold jewelry, play a
major role in the phenomenon of `unfair distribution.' The incomes
of an estimated 40 percent of the 100,000 private business people in
Beijing are considered to be `not reasonable'.''
   _The director of the president's office at Beijing University,
Huang Huaicheng, speaking at the university's 90th anniversary
celebration in May 1988: ``Beijing University students have a
tradition of being concerned about the future of the country.'' Vice
Minister of Education He Dongchang, speaking to college officials
Aug. 10: ``Students in many universities have admitted they have
three major weak points _ overestimating their own ability, lacking
an overall understanding of China's actual situation and knowing
little about Marxism.''

   Only a small number of the foreigners who fled
China after the army crushed the democracy movement in June have
come back.
   It is possible now to walk through the Temple of Heaven Park, one
of Beijing's leading tourist attractions, without seeing a single
foreigner.
   The Friendship Store, a three-story government department store
stocked with souvenirs and imported food for foreigners, is packed
with Chinese these days.
   The store is so desperate for shoppers it has raised its daily
quota of Chinese visitors. It has slashed prices, too: a can of
oolong tea sells for 12 yuan ($3.25) now, half the pre-June price.
   The two blocks between the Jianguo and Jinglun hotels for
foreigners and the Friendship Store used to be crowded with young
men offering to exchange money at black market rates. Now, the money
changers are gone.
   Some legitimate businessmen want to give up.
   ``I'm trying to unload my business, but no one wants to buy,''
said a clothing vendor in a private market formerly jammed with
foreign tourists.
   Many hotel workers and others affected by the drop in tourism are
suddenly taking ``vacations'' at reduced salaries. Chinese workers
do not ordinarily get vacations.
   Foreign residents in Beijing are trickling back. The U.S.
Government gave approval Aug. 11 for embassy dependents to return,
and other countries are doing the same.
   The government said two-thirds of the nearly 1,170 foreign
companies with offices in Beijing have not resumed normal
operations. Many businessmen commute in from Hong Kong only to
handle pressing matters.
   But a Western business consultant in Beijing said companies that
already have invested in China cannot afford to walk away, and
although new investment likely will suffer, some companies still
regard a presence in China as essential to their Asian marketing
strategies. Others have found they can get better terms now from
Chinese partners keen for investment dollars.
   ``You would like to punish the government, but how can you?''
said the consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The moral
issue always comes up ... but at the end of the day it's just
business.''
   It is less clear how cultural exchanges will fare. The American
Joffrey Ballet canceled what was to have been a black-tie
performance this fall. The British Council postponed indefinitely a
exhibition of modern British art.
   Some scholars have dropped plans to teach in China in the fall
and others are still trying to decide. The Chinese government has
suspended the U.S. government-sponsored exchange of Fulbright
scholars.
   Ignatius Cao, a Chinese-born political science professor at the
State University of New York in Oneonta, said halting scholarly
exchanges would be tragic.
   ``At least many Chinese can know the other world through our
presence,'' he said. ``I don't urge (the students) to make
revolution. I just want them to understand ... the realities outside
the socialist camp.''

   Mazda's new MX5 Miata, the zippy little two-seater
from Japan, is turning heads and commanding premium prices in an
otherwise slow U.S. car market, giving the Big Three automakers
another source of frustration.
   Waiting lists are long for the Miata, customers willingly pay
thousands of dollars over the $13,800 base price and there are
reports that some owners have resold the cars at more than double
the price they paid.
   It's an obsession reminiscent of the Ford Mustang craze a quarter
century ago, and how long it will last is uncertain.
   But the enormous success of the Miata, a throwback to the sporty
classic European roadsters of years past, seems to attest to the
shrewd marketing and design talent employed by Japanese automakers _
who in the past have successfully exploited other niches _ even in
Detroit's own backyard. The car's creators were Americans.
   ``It's one of the most exciting things I've witnessed,'' said
George McCabe, deputy general manager of Mazda Motor of America
Inc., the U.S. marketing arm of Mazda Motor Corp., based in
Hiroshima, Japan.
   McCabe said the company doesn't have a count on dealer orders for
the 20,000 Miatas to be imported this year, and it's too early to
decide whether production should be boosted beyond the 40,000
planned for 1990.
   When compared with overall auto sales in the United States, of
course, 40,000 is small. General Motors Corp., for example, sold
more than 140,000 cars in early August alone.
   Still, GM and its chief U.S. rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. have been forced to offer discounts and rebates on cars in an
attempt to clear bloated inventories this summer, and even that
hasn't been too successful. So the Miata's popularity is at least a
symbolic slap in their faces.
   The tiny car has virtually no trunk space and room behind the two
seats is minimal. Designers weren't thinking of long-distance road
trips when they were putting the car together.
   Their mission was to develop a basic sports car that would be fun
to drive at a price that undercut sporty cars with more power and
electronic gadgets.
   ``The whole idea from the beginning was to make it an affordable
sports car. There was just a big gap for an affordable elemental
sports car,'' said Norm Garrett, a layout engineer for the Miata
project who now works for Volvo-GM Heavy Truck Corp. in Greensboro,
N.C.
   Officially, Miatas went on sale July 1, available in red, white
and blue. Dealers have been taking orders from consumers basing
their decisions on automotive magazine writers who gushed over the
car as far back as March.
   All the publicity, excitement and limited availability have
created a temptation for dealers, some of whom are said to be
getting up to $5,000 over list price from Miata-hungry buyers.
   McCabe said Mazda has sought to quell the temptation to gouge,
though the company cannot dictate to dealers how much to charge.
   ``We've taken as strong a position as we can with our dealers.
We've notified them in writing about why it's bad for them, why it's
bad for Mazda and why it's shortsighted for them once this media
attention dies down,'' McCabe said.
   ``Consumers have a long memory,'' he said. ``If they feel they're
being taken advantage of, in the future I think they will remember
that dealer took advantage of that situation and go to another
dealer.''
   John Zabawa, owner of Eastland Imports in Detroit, said consumers
are lining up to buy Miatas. Zabawa said he's not gouging, even
though demand exceeds supply.
   ``There probably have been some people who have offered us more,
but we take them in order,'' he said.
   One of his customers, Kristen Smith of Detroit, got hers on July
24 and paid $18,800, including the optional hard top. She said she
bought the Miata because of its distinctive looks.
   However, she added, ``The attention you get with it is not always
good. I had someone follow me home, follow me for a long time, for
an hour.''
   Scott Petterson of Northville, Mich., a parking lot attendant at
a swank restaurant in Detroit, said he's driven four or five Miatas.
   ``We get Ferraris, everything out here and this is the only one
that everybody stares at,'' he said.

<HEAD>What Bush Didn't Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the old gag, the comedian answers the
telephone and listens for a moment. ``You don't say,'' he marvels.
Then, ever more incredulous, ``You don't say ... You don't say.''
   He hangs up. ``Who was it?'' asks the straight man.
   ``He didn't say.''
   Not saying is no joke with President Bush. His adroit use of
ambiguity is becoming a trademark. It's a way to avoid answering
questions he doesn't want to answer, or can't answer _ and a way to
send signals, political and diplomatic.
   At his ``last day before vacation'' news conference, his 20th by
White House count, Bush used the technique to respond without really
answering questions about U.S. hostages in Lebanon and possible
steps to gain their freedom.
   That is ambiguity with a purpose, combining an invitation to Iran
to help get the hostages out and so foster better relations with a
hint of possible reprisals, when and if the administration can find
a way to punish terrorists without harming others.
   ``... If I could find a way to take those hostages, get them and
bring them out, and that required using the military force of the
United States, make no mistake about it, I would do it in an
instant,'' Bush told his press conference on Tuesday. That was all
conditional _ he said he hasn't found a way and doesn't know that
there is one.
   Nor was he saying what the United States might be prepared to do
for Iran were that nation to help free the hostages. ``Too
hypothetical to answer,'' Bush said, ``but I would simply repeat
that we are looking for signs of change ... There are many ways that
countries who are estranged can get back together.''
   The goals are clear: freedom for the hostages and improved
relations with Iran. The punishments and rewards that may be
involved are intentionally vague; to spell them out in advance would
be to devalue them. Besides, there aren't many options available.
   The answer also was vague when Bush was asked what the
administration is going to do about the planned Sept. 1 inauguration
of a new president of Panama, the chosen candidate of military boss
Manuel Noriega in an aborted election that U.S. observers said was
stolen. The United States wants Noriega out, but Bush said he isn't
holding his breath waiting for the Panamanian strongman to go
voluntarily.
   ``I don't know for sure what we're going to do,'' he said.
   Not many options there, either, after more than two years of U.S.
efforts to get rid of Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on drug
trafficking charges.
   Bush has proven far more willing than his predecessors to say in
plain language that he doesn't know something. At his rare news
conferences, Ronald Reagan sometimes misspoke because he tried to
talk his way around questions rather than acknowledging that he
didn't have any answer. At his frequent ones, Bush shows no qualms
about saying ``I just don't know,'' as he did Tuesday when asked
about prospects for the release of the hostages.
   Ambiguity can serve domestic purposes, too. With a multibillion
drug fighting program to be announced on Sept. 5, Bush said some
federal money is going to have to be reallocated in order to finance
the new program without raising taxes. He would not say which
programs will take the budget hits. ``... The final decisions
haven't been made,'' Bush said.
   For the president to telegraph those spending shifts and then
leave town for his three-week vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine,
would have been to invite warfare in the bureaucracy as the managers
of threatened programs lobbied to keep their budgets intact. Better
to leave everyone guessing.
   ``Stay tuned, and we will show you in September how we're going
to allocate the resources for this,'' Bush said.
   There also are variations. After agreeing with budget director
Richard G. Darman that he'd like to see the Federal Reserve Board
ease interest rates, Bush was asked whether he also agreed that the
Fed would be to blame if rates don't come down and there is a
recession.
   ``Well,'' said Bush, ``I'd like to go back, because i don't
recall that part of it, and take that under advisement and let you
know at a later date.''
   What did he say?
   He didn't say.

<HEAD>Rare Plants Lack Protections of Endangered Animals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Killing endangered animals can mean prison, but
landowners may with impunity pluck or bulldoze the last specimen of
the rarest plant on Earth.
   Federal and state agencies keep lists of hundreds of endangered
plants, some discovered so recently they haven't been given Latin
names. Yet laws that prohibit even molesting endangered animals
regulate only those plants on public land and the theft or sale of
rare flora.
   ``We are pointing our fingers at the developing nations of the
world, saying, `How can you destroy your rain forests,' yet here we
are allowing our own plant species to become extinct,'' says Jora
Young, director of stewardship for the Nature Conservancy in Florida.
   The lack of concern for plants is ironic, ecologists say, since
plants have been more useful than have animals. Besides providing
most of the food we eat, they produce morphine, aspirin, digitalis,
atropine, alcohol, mustard, menthol, quinine, curare, germicides,
pesticides and scores of other useful substances.
   ``A lot of plants may not be important now, but they may some day
save lives,'' says Richard Wunderlin, president of the Florida
Native Plant Society.
   Florida ranks third in the nation for the number of endangered
plants, behind California and Texas, Wunderlin said. It also boasts,
at least for now, many rare species found nowhere else in the
country, or even the world.
   In Florida, the problem is acute. Booming development is wiping
out native plant habitats from the hardwood hammocks in the tropical
Keys to scrub land in central Florida and pine woods along the
Apalachicola River.
   The state has created an Endangered Plant Advisory Council, but
its powers are limited to placing species on a list that merely
regulates their sale.
   ``We're adding more plants to the list all the time,'' says
council Chairman Dan Austin, a botany professor at Florida Atlantic
University in Boca Raton. ``But it doesn't protect the plants.
People can do just about anything they want, and nobody outside can
stop them.''
   Many environmentalists have given up on crowded southeastern
Florida. Austin said only 1 percent of the native scrub land in Palm
Beach County still survives; in Broward County it has all but
disappeared. The main battleground is now central Florida, where
rare plant species are succumbing not only to development but to the
spread of the citrus industry.
   Wunderlin points in frustration to a newly discovered species of
the rattlebox plant that is so new it doesn't even have a scientific
name. It is known only in two locations _ both housing developments
near Avon Park.
   ``The species is disappearing lot by lot. We will propose it be
put on the federal protective list but it's still on private
property, so that won't protect it at all. Each time we go into the
fields, more have disappeared.''
   The federal government lists only 27 plants for protection.
Plants on the list can't be destroyed if they are found on a
federally funded project such as a dam or public housing. But that
represents a tiny fraction of the development in most areas, Austin
said. The state does not have any similar prohibitions for the 139
endangered and 280 threatened plants on its list.
   Placing a plant on the list isn't always easy because development
and farm interests routinely oppose such efforts, Austin said. It
also gives landowners who find endangered plants on property they
intend to develop an incentive to destroy them quickly to avoid
later headaches. That's perfectly legal.
   ``If you're a developer and you own the last population of the
big pine partridge pea, you can bulldoze it,'' said Ms. Young. ``As
long as you don't steal if from a federal preserve or try to sell
it, you're OK.''
   Plants have historically gotten short shrift. Under old English
law, animals, which moved through the property of many people,
belonged to the crown, making them in effect a public trust. But
plants remained on one spot and were totally the property of the
landowner.
   And people, being animals themselves, are subject to what Ms.
Young called ``the Bambi syndrome.''
   ``If I talk about the impending extinction of the Key deer,
people say, `Oh, that's terrible. What can we do,'' she said. ``But
if I say, `This little mint that occurs only in two places on the
Lake Wales Ridge is very close to extinction,' they just shrug and
say, `That's too bad.'''
   That prejudice, she said, is not based on reality. Besides their
value to humans, lower plants are often food for higher animals, and
their destruction can have unknown implications on the environment.
   Although state officials and environmentalists see little hope
for a sudden broad shift in the legal and political climate, there
are some hopeful signs.
   Dade County has begun to protect some native trees, although
without protecting the habitat they need to survive, said Julia
Morton, a University of Miami biologist. ``It's only quantitative,
dealing with numbers.''
   Another alternative Ms. Morton found hopeful is transplanting
rare species to exotic plant nurseries, if the developing landowner
agrees.
   That approach, while often the only realistic one, is inadequate,
Wunderlin said. ``In the wild they are very variable genetically. By
removing only a few plants and cultivating them, you are preserving
only a very small proportion.''
   If they are reintroduced they can't resist extreme conditions, he
added.
   Environentalists and experts unanimously praised the Nature
Conservancy, which has bought 400,000 acres of environmentally
sensitive land around Florida over the last 25 years. It often acts
as an agent for the state, quickly buying the land and then holding
it until the state bureaucracy is ready to buy it.
   The Conservancy recently bought a site along the Apalachicola
River that is the last refuge of an endangered evergreen tree. It
has preserved ancient dunes in the Lake Wales Ridge area that are
the only known home of endangered species such as the scrub plum and
the pygmy fringe tree. And it is buying hammock areas on Key Largo
that harbor a variety of tree and plant species.
   Despite an increase in environmental consciousness, Austin said,
protecting animals while ignoring plants is ``like a watchmaker
taking a watch apart and throwing half the pieces away then trying
to put it back together.''
   Each day, environmentalists say, more pieces of the watch are
disappearing.

   They're people haunted by regret over choices
in life. ``If only...,'' they say, ``... but it's too late now.''
   ``They're the people who are always thinking about the past,''
said psychologist Arthur Freeman. Such ``ruminators,'' mired in
their pasts, believe their lives have been irrevocably altered by
choices they'd like to change.
   ``What they think of is how things were. They don't see the flip
side of how things are,'' said Freeman, a professor at the
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and the
University of Pennsylvania.
   They can be recognized as soon as they start talking about their
problems, he said. They say: ``I look at the past and see more
failure than success,'' ``I would like to change my job, but it's
too late,'' ``I should have become an artist,'' or ``I could be
happy if only I were rich.''
   Freeman encourages his patients at Penn's Center for Cognitive
Therapy to rethink such comments. ``If only I hadn't given up my
career to have children'' becomes ``I have three wonderful, loving
children.''
   In a new book, ``Woulda-Coulda-Shoulda'' (Silver Arrow Books,
$17.95), Freeman and Rose DeWolf of The Philadelphia Daily News
explore second-guessing, outline a course of action and, using
specific situations, describe how readers can either fall back into
the habit or break it.
   ``Insight, in and of itself, is not sufficient to change,''
Freeman said. ``I'm more interested in what keeps you doing the same
stuff and how you can change. Change is the name of the game. Not
just sitting here talking about change but actively working on
change.''
   The first step is acknowledging a problem and wanting change.
Ruminators should examine their assumptions, such as having an
unlimited skill (``I'd be happy if I were a successful surgeon.'')
or being able to know the future (``We'd be rich if I had sold the
stock at a higher price.'').
   The next step is to write down the advantanges or disadvantages
as a way to evaluate the change and the person's willingness to risk
it.
   Freeman encourages his patients to challenge their thinking and
conclusions by examining the assumptions inherent in their
statements. Once the assumptions are understood, he said, ruminators
should decide a course of action.
   His former dentist, in the midst of a successful practice and
teaching position at Penn, decided to become an engineer. After
several years of night school while continuing to work, he graduated
and reached his goal _ an example Freeman cites of goals that are
not unattainable, but have to be accomplished step by step. Failure
to overcome the problem usually occurs when a person can't take the
final step and risk a change.
   ``Making a change is difficult,'' Freeman said. ``The
woulda-coulda-shoulda person thinks of the endpoint but refuses to
get involved in the process.''
   Once the change is made, a former ruminator may have trouble with
others who want to continue that thought pattern. Freeman's book
suggests several methods for avoiding that trap, which he calls ``a
tug of war.''
   ``The message of this book is that it is possible to look back in
a new way,'' he wrote. ``The key to progress in life is returning to
the present. The Hall of Memories becomes a fascinating place to
visit _ no longer a place in which to live _ or even linger.''

<HEAD>Violence at Home Often Is Foreseeable, CDC Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most families disrupted by violence have contact
with police and welfare agencies before their troubles escalate to
assault or death but the agencies don't share information, says a
Centers for Disease Control study.
   The CDC study of 284 killings, assaults and other family violence
in 1984 in Atlanta ``shows there is a good chance you can identify
both the victims and perpetrators of family violence before someone
comes in dead,'' said Dr. Linda Saltzman, an epidemiologist who
designed it. ``We have to work at protecting these people before
violence escalates to life-threatening proportions.''
   The $100,000 study found that one in five murder victims was
married, living with or otherwise related to the killer; one in four
who killed a lover or relative was known by police, social workers
or public health to have had a history of assaulting family members;
and more than 60 percent of the victims and perpetrators had been in
contact with at least two public agencies.
   Other research has shown that family violence is common and those
who commit violent crimes often have police records; the CDC study
suggests that both victims and perpetrators routinely have contact
with public agencies.
   ``We're looking at why we're not always sharing information and
seeing what we can do,'' said Dr. Ardith Peters of the Atlanta
Department of Public Safety.
   However, even if police know who is most prone to violence, they
can't prevent crimes in all cases, she said. ``The richest city in
the world can't afford to be social workers at large to the world so
the question becomes, `How do you most effectively deploy the
resources you have?'''

<HEAD>Crater Lake Study Yields Many Surprises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A search of Crater Lake
has turned up more than the hot springs scientists were seeking.
   In recent weeks the researchers have found mysterious, aqua-blue
pools of dense fluid, black mud ``of unknown origin'' and a new kind
of mite. Last year, and again this summer, they found white and
orange bacterial mats.
   A sample of the black mud and samples of the bacteria and the
blue water that apparently feeds the bacteria were returned Tuesday
from the lake's 1,550-foot-deep south basin, said Jim Milestone, the
park biologist. The mud ``looks like oil,'' he said. ``It's
definitely a mud, with fine grains in it.''
   The first of three blue pools of fluid were found the week
before. ``I've never seen anything like it,'' said Oregon State
University oceanographer Jack Dymond, who heads the project with OSU
oceanographer Robert Collier.
   The first pool was about 6 feet deep by 3 feet by 8 feet.
``Precipitates surrounded the pool with yellow deposits,'' Milestone
said. ``We don't know at this time if these are precipitates or a
new type of bacteria.'' The two pools found since using the special
Deep Rover submarine are 14 to 16 feet long.
   The new mite, dubbed the Crater Lake mite, was found on rock
samples taken from the bottom of the lake. Milestone said it's a
species that eats algae, indicating that algae live in the lake up
to 450 feet deep.
   Dymond and Collier believe the 2,000-foot-deep lake in the
caldera of the 7,000-year-old Mount Mazama volcano was formed by a
geothermal spring. It is on a National Park Service list of parks
with ``significant thermal features'' and the agency must report to
Congress next year if it should stay on the list.
   If hot springs are found, the government could limit geothermal
drilling and development outside the park. The scientists say a
minimum difference of 10 degrees Celsius is necessary to qualify the
lake as a hydrothermal spring.

   Wilfrid Nixon has true grit _ and he hopes
to mix it with water and make ice strong enough for offshore Arctic
oil platforms.
   Some companies have built drilling platforms of ice, but ``adding
sand would make it stronger, and you could make the structure
quicker because you're adding less water to achieve the same
volume,'' said Nixon, whose is studying alluvium-reinforced ice at
the University of Iowa.
   ``I've spoken with some of the engineers at Mobil who do research
in the ice area. They think it's a good idea,'' he said. So did the
National Science Foundation, which gave him a $35,000 grant in
November to test his theory.
   Clad in sandals and a short-sleeved shirt, Nixon oversees
experiments done in 23-degree temperatures at the Institute of
Hydraulic Research lab, where he and associates freeze water and
different types and blends of sand into beams and cylinders, some of
them seven feet long and weighing 1,000 pounds. ``We've tested 400
beams and anticipate testing another 400 before it's all over.''
   In the Arctic, sand could be shipped in or dredged from the sea
bed and mixed with water from ``huge great versions of snow making
machines'' used to make the base. A base of sand and ice would weigh
about 10 tons, Nixon said.
   Platform bases have made of steel, concrete and ice. With sand
and ice, he said, ``A base for a drilling platform would take about
30 days as opposed to 50 days for just the ice. Sixty to 90 days is
typically how long it takes to get it constructed with the other
materials.''
   Nixon estimates a company could save $500,000 with a sand-ice
base.
   He hopes to test his theories at a reservoir near Iowa City if
it's cold enough this winter. ``We'd basically throw a hole in the
ice and drop through two tubes, one to get water and the other to
get whatever's on the bottom. We'd suck them up, spray them out and
hopefully create a small platform base maybe 10 feet in diameter.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate raider Carl Icahn, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and the head of giant investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. are getting together for a friendly takeover battle.
   The unscripted _ but simulated _ drama about a hostile raid will
take place next month at a conference on management in the 1990s by
the World Management Council, the group said Wednesday.
   Also scheduled to attend the three-day conference in Manhattan
are the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader; leveraged buyout
specialist Henry Kravis; former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker; Italian industrialist Carlo de Benedetti; Texas oilman and
sometime raider T. Boone Pickens; and dozens of other business,
political and education figures.
   In the mock takeover, Icahn will make a surprise hostile bid for
a fictitious company headed by former Arco Inc. Chairman Robert O.
Anderson. The raid comes during a company board meeting addressing
other issues.
   Jackson is scheduled to be a board member but he may switch to a
more characteristic role as a shareholder rights defender or
community figure, said John Diebold, president of the World
Management Council, which held its first congress in 1924.
   Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph, whose firm has provided
financial backing and advice for many corporate raids in the 1980s,
originally was cast as Icahn's investment backer. ``Now he's decided
he wants to be the company's banker,'' said Diebold, who is chairman
of the management consultant Diebold Group Inc.
   The takeover scenario is being developed by a case writer at the
Harvard Business School, he said.
   The Dalai Lama, the traditional high priest of Lamaism, a form of
Buddhism, will be honored for protecting individual human rights at
the Sept. 21-23 conference in New York, Diebold said.

<HEAD>Investor Group Buys Out Fleer Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fleer Corp., the 104-year-old maker of
baseball cards and Dubble Bubble gum, has been acquired by a group
of New York investors, said its chairman and chief executive
officer, Frank M. Mustin.
   The deal, completed Friday, was made through a new company formed
by Charterhouse Group International Inc., a New York company that
specializes in leveraged buyouts.
   The purchase price was not disclosed.
   Paul Mullan, 43, former general manager at Leaf Inc., will be
chairman of the new firm, Charter Confectionery Inc. Leaf makes Milk
Duds candy, Clark candy bars and Donruss baseball cards.
   Mullan said Wednesday he would move to Philadelphia from Illinois
to run Fleer. He said he wants to pursue aggressive growth of
Fleer's confectionary products and trading card business, both
domestically and internationally.
   ``We're intending to build off the same management team,'' he
said. ``Although there will be some changes.''
   Charterhouse is owned by five European financial firms, one of
them the Royal Bank of Scotland, and by two American principals,
Merril M. Halpern and Jerome L. Katz.
   Fleer, a family business founded in 1885 by German immigrants,
has more than 500 employees. Besides its Philadelphia plant, Fleer
has operations in Spain, Germany, Canada and Morocco, Mustin said.
Fleer had sales of more than $50 million in 1988, Mullan said.
   A statement released by Fleer said the shareholders considered
their options and decided it was better to conclude a sale now than
to continue on as a family business. Topps Chewing Gum Inc., a major
competitor, was acquired in a similar deal six years ago. Forstmann
Little, another New York leveraged buyout specialist, arranged an
all-cash purchase for $94.5 million.
   Since it was founded in 1973, Charterhouse has engineered more
than 35 leveraged buyouts, including the 1988 takeover of EMI Co., a
foundry in Erie.
   It has also bought retailers and companies engaged in
transportation parts, industrial batteries, graphic arts,
engineering supplies, apparel and fashion accessories.
   Mullan said Charter would borrow cash to pay Fleer stockholders
for their shares, but he said the company would not assume the heavy
debt that has marked some leveraged buyouts.
   Mustin will become president of the company's international
division, Mullan said. The deal has been approved by the Federal
Trade Commission, he said.

   Sea Containers' board said Wednesday the revised bid from Temple

   The board recommend that shareholders refuse to tender their

28.
   At the same time, the board directed management to proceed with
previously disclosed efforts to develop a recapitalization plan that
would involve ``a substantial cash distribution'' to shareholders
and the issue of new common stock and other securities.
   It said management had hired the investment firm Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. to advise on arranging financing for the recapitalization.
   The board said it would propose a recapitalization even if the
Temple bid were withdrawn.
   Temple disclosed Tuesday that it was raising its tender offer for
Sea Containers' common stock to $63 a share from $50 and for its
convertible preferred stock to $101.43 per share from $80.50.
   A spokesman for Temple said the new bid valued Sea Containers at
$1.02 billion, up from $824 million in the initial bid launched May
26.
   Stena already owns about 8 percent of Sea Containers stock.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Sea Containers rose
$1.12{ a share to $68.25.
   In another development, the debt rating service Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. said it was continuing to review whether to lower Sea
Container's credit ratings. S&amp;P has been reviewing the matter since
Temple launched its unsolicited bid.

   Whittle Communications picked Philips Consumer
Electronics Co. for the $150 million-plus assignment of building ``a
video pipeline'' that will carry its commercially sponsored Channel
One news show to classrooms.
   The Knoxville, Tenn.-based media concern said Wednesday it chose
Philips over two other contenders for the job of making and
installing 300,000 television sets, 16,000 videocassette recorders
and 8,000 satellite dishes at participating schools.
   The contract award came on the heels of Turner Broadcasting
System Inc.'s launch earlier this week of a daily commercial-free
news program tailored for schools on its Cable News Network.
   The Turner program, called CNN Newsroom, is being delivered
without the huge donation of equipment that Whittle plans to provide.
   The contract with Philips, a subsidiary of North American Philips
Corp., which in turn is a unit of the Dutch conglomerate Philips
Industries NV, is the company's largest single order of this type.
   The other contenders were Japan's Sony Corp. and Videostar
Connections, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data
Systems Corp.
   Atlanta-based Videostar had supplied, installed and serviced the
hardware for Whittle's 25-show Channel One test in six schools last
spring.
   Whittle Chairman Christopher Whittle said Philips won the job
because of a combination of ``service and price'' but declined to
specify just what separated the three bids.
   He said his company would borrow from banks to pay for the
equipment, which is Whittle's largest single undertaking to date.
   Whittle Communications, which is 50 percent owned by Time Warner
Inc., reported revenue of $152 million for the year ended June 30.
   Philips said it plans to start building color Magnavox brand TV
sets for the project at its Greeneville, Tenn., plant later this
year. It expects to add more than 200 manufacturing employees at the
facility.
   Philips has contracted with RSI-SatCom Technologies Division of
Duluth, Ga., to manufacture the satellite dishes and install and
service the TV sets, VCRs and satellite systems in the schools.
   Whittle expects to have 1,000 schools hooked up when it launches
Channel One nationally in March 1990 and hopes to have 8,000 schools
by the end of 1990.
   Asked how many schools have signed up to date, Whittle said he
did not intend to give a running total but said signup efforts would
begin in earnest with the start of the school year.
   He also declined to say which advertisers have signed up for the
program. During the test run last spring, each Channel One program
carried two minutes of ads for jeans, sneakers, candy bars, shampoo
and other products.
   The advertising has outraged some national education groups, who
say companies should not be allowed to pitch products to students in
the classroom.
   The New York State Board of Regents banned Channel One from the
state's public schools because of the ads and the top education
official in California said public schools that run Channel One
there risk losing some state aid.
   But Whittle said there is no other realistic way besides selling
advertising time to pay the $2 million weekly cost of both producing
the news show and equipping schools to see it.

<HEAD>Hearing Set on Dumping Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. International Trade Commission says it
has set a final hearing Oct. 31 on the request of American telephone
manufacturers for steep anti-dumping duties on small business phone
systems from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea.
   The action Wednesday follows a U.S. Commerce Department
preliminary finding that 12 manufacturers in the three Asian
countries were exporting the systems to the United States at prices
far below fair market value.
   The purpose of the hearing is to determine whether U.S. makers
are substantially threatened by the imports. The commission is
expected to announce its decision in November.
   A U.S. government investigation was requested by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Comdial Corp.
   AT&amp;T and other U.S. makers said the Asian manufacturers had
captured about 60 percent of the U.S. market for small business
phone systems and their own sales had declined dramatically. The
systems provide telephone links within companies separate from the
general telephone network, to which they may be connected for
outside calling.
   Foreign companies named in the action included Toshiba and
Matsushita of Japan, Samsung and Goldstar in South Korea and Taiwan
Nitsuko and Sun Moon Star in Taiwan. The Commerce Department said
the United States in 1988 imported $775.7 million worth of small
business phone systems and partly assembled systems from Japan, $342
million worth from Taiwan and $227 million worth from South Korea.

   Imports accounted for more than half of the
country's domestic petroleum consumption last month, surging past
the 50 percent mark for the first time in 12 years, the American
Petroleum Institute reports.
   ``A lot of this oil is coming from the Middle East, the unstable
Middle East,'' said institute spokesman R.G. Ensz. ``It means
dollars are leaving the country to pay for this oil.''
   The API's monthly statistical report, released Wednesday, found
oil imports accounted for 50.4 percent of domestic consumption in
July, up from 43.5 percent in July 1988.
   The report said domestic deliveries of petroleum products
averaged just under 17 million barrels a day, while total imports _
crude oil plus petroleum products _ averaged over 8.5 million
barrels.
   July's total was only the fourth time ever that a monthly import
figure had exceeded 50 percent, the institute said. In March 1977
and July 1977, imports surged to 51.8 percent of total deliveries,
while in May 1977 imports reached 50.5 percent.
   Ensz said the new figures indicate ``we're growing more dependent
on foreign oil while Congress is putting moratoria on offshore
drilling.''
   Legislation is moving through Congress, he said, that would stop
drilling for oil in Alaska and off the coasts of California, western
Florida, the Mid-Atlantic and New England.
   The move toward the bans comes after the Exxon Valdez tanker
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into the pristine
waters of Alaksa's Prince William Sound.
   ``What they're overlooking is more foreign oil means more
tankers'' in U.S. waters, Ensz said. ``All of our foreign oil,
except that which comes from Canada, has to come by tanker.''
   The growing traffic of oil tankers, in turn, raises the potential
for another oil tanker spill, he said.
   The API said the highest percentage of oil imports for a full
year was 47.7 percent in 1977. For the first seven months of this
year, imports averaged 46.2 percent of deliveries, compared with
41.5 percent for all of 1988.
   And while imports were rising _ up 17.9 percent in July compared
with the same month a year ago _ domestic crude production has
continued to decline. API said domestic crude production in July
averaged 7.5 million barrels a day, 7.1 percent less than during
July 1988.
   Some lawmakers are proposing tax incentives this year to
encourage domestic oil production, but Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, has said he
believes such legislation may have a better chance of passing next
year.
   Bentsen has said the increasing dependence on foreign oil adds to
the trade deficit and threatens national security.
   But he believes tax incentives to encourage drilling for domestic
reserves will be difficult to enact this year because of a lack of
meaningful progress in cutting the budget deficit. Incentives would
add to the budget shortfall.

<HEAD>Boston Investment Firm Buys 12 Percent of Texas Air</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Boston investment firm said its 12 percent stake
in Texas Air Corp., parent company of Continental Airlines and
Eastern Airlines, is strictly for investment purposes.
   Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co. said it had been accumulating Texas Air
stock since May, but didn't file notice of the stake with the
Securities and Exchange Commission until Wednesday. Investors are
required to notify the SEC of stock holdings when they exceed 5
percent of a company's total shares.
   Ken Heebner, a portfolio manager for Loomis, Sayles, said its
interest in Texas Air is strictly for investment purposes and does
not represent a possible takeover attempt.
   Texas Air said it welcomed the investment.
   ``We are pleased to have such a well-regarded financial
institution showing such confidence in the company,'' said spokesman
Art Kent.
   Texas Air recently reported a second-quarter loss of $109.3
million. The company also has posted two consecutive years of
multimillion-dollar losses.
   ``A challenge in investing is buying something that's not making
money right now,'' Heebner said of the Houston-based holding company.
   ``The company will make money in 1990,'' he said. ``The company
is getting healthier.''
   Continental, also based in Houston, has had business problems in
the past, but the airline's health has improved, Heebner said.
   ``In addition, I hear the service facilities have improved,'' he
said. ``You'll see more business travelers.''
   Heebner also predicted that Eastern will emerge from its
bankruptcy reorganization as a profitable subsidiary of Texas Air.
   ``You'll see a smaller Eastern, but it'll be a profitable
Eastern,'' he said.
   Miami-based Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
March 9, five days after its Machinists union members went on
strike. Since then, it has been rebuilding as a smaller airline
using non-union workers.
   Loomis, Sayles manages more than $20 billion in assets for
institutional and individual clients. The firm is a wholly owned
subsidiary of The New England, an insurance company.
   Texas Air stock closed Wednesday at $17.87{ on the American Stock
Exchange, down 12{ cents.
   The largest stockholder of Texas Air is Jet Capital Corp., Texas
Air's holding company, which owns all of the Class A common Texas
Air stock, Kent said. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc. owns 11.7 percent of
the common stock, while Scandinavian Airlines System has 9.8 percent
and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. has 6.4 percent.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo owns 48.7 percent of Jet Capital
while Minneapolis banker Carl R. Pohlad, who owns the Minnesota
Twins, owns 12 percent.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mostly higher in moderate
European trading early today ahead of the release of U.S. trade
figures later in the day.
   Gold prices fell.
   The dollar's strength indicated an easing of fears of a slowdown
in the U.S. economy, some traders said. But most said it showed that
market players were expecting a narrowing in the U.S. trade deficit.
   Dealers said they were expecting the trade deficit to have shrunk
to about $9.4 billion in June from $10.24 billion in May.
   ``The market is bullish and that's why the dollar remains at this
relatively high level,'' said a trader at a large U.S. bank in
Frankfurt.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5730 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5725 late Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.9500 West German marks, up from 1.9470; 1.6810
Swiss francs, up from 1.6775; 6.5900 French francs, up from 6.5700;
2.1968 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1925; 1,401.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,397.75; 1.1765 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1785.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.52 yen to a closing 142.32 yen. Its price in
London was 142.77 yen.
   Gold prices were pushed down by the expectations of a
narrower-than-expected trade gap, which would divert investors from
the bullion market.
   Gold opened in London at $365.85 a troy ounce, lower than a late
bid price of $368.75 Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $366.
   In Zurich, gold traded at $366.10, compared with $368.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.15 to close at $366.69.
   Silver bullion traded in London at $5.18 a troy ounce, down from
$5.24 late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Futures Exchanges Unveil New System To Prevent Fraudulent Trades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid an unfolding criminal investigation of dozens
of futures traders, the nation's two leading exchanges are
developing an electronic watchdog to make sure trading pits are on
the up-and-up.
   If the system works as planned, floor traders will graduate from
the pencil-and-pad era of recording hundreds of millions of trades
annually.
   The idea is to close a gap that gives unscrupulous traders room
to manipulate their deals without a precise record of what they've
done.
   Under the system being developed by the Chicago Board of Trade
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, traders will record their deals
immediately, using hand-held devices that transmit the data into the
exchange computers.
   ``These instruments will not have an eraser on one end,'' Merc
executive Leo Melamed said Wednesday.
   Among the 46 indicted traders at the two exchanges, some were
accused of simply changing prices on their penciled-in records when
it would mean a profit for themselves or confederates.
   Melamed said the new system would provide an audit trail that
could ``prevent most if not all of the indictable offenses'' the
government identified in its 2{-year undercover investigation.
   The improved audit trail system, said Merc spokesman Andrew
Yemma, would give an almost instantaneous recording of all the
pertinent data of a trade _ the price, the trading partner, the
commodity and the time of the transaction.
   Under the present system, floor traders record their trades by
writing on cards, which are picked up at the pits by clerks every 30
minutes or so.
   In 85 percent of the trades, the time of the transaction is
correct to within a minute, said Yemma. But even as short a time as
a minute can give an unscrupulous trader plenty of opportunity for
manipulation.
   For example, a trader who has an extra large purchase order from
a customer could buy the commodity for his own account first, then
execute the customer's order. The trader would profit from the jump
in price triggered by his customer's large buy order.
   The Merc and the Board of Trade each contributed $2.5 million
toward the development for the hand-held units and invited other
U.S. futures exchanges to join in the effort.
   While the exchanges were announcing their plans, a yen trader at
the Merc entered an innocent plea to charges of racketeering
conspiracy, fraud and violations of the Commodities Act.
   James M. Marren, 39, became the 14th trader to plead innocent.
   No trial date has been set for any of the accused, and defense
attorneys told U.S. District Judge George Marovich on Wednesday they
would like a year or more to wade through the countless documents
and recorded conversations before going to trial.
   ``The magnitude of the written documents and the tapes, and the
extent of pretrial motions and government responses require that
much time,'' said defense attorney Anthony Onesto.
   Marovich said he wants to move more swiftly than that and
indicated he would set a trial date at the next hearing on Sept. 29.

<HEAD>Marvin Davis Ups Bid for UAL to $6.2 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Marvin Davis has sweetened his offer for
UAL Corp. to $6.2 billion and prepared to wage a possible proxy
fight to gain control of the company's board.
   Davis raised his offer for the parent of United Airlines to $275
a share Wednesday from his original $240 a share, or $5.4 billion,
bid.
   UAL stock closed Wednesday at $251.75 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange, down $2.50. Davis' new bid was revealed after the
market closed.
   UAL directors are expected to consider the new offer at a meeting
today.
   Spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said the company would have no comment
on the sweetened offer before the meeting.
   UAL also declined comment on Davis' filing of documents asking
shareholders to remove all 16 directors other than Chairman Stephen
M. Wolf and replace them with a five-member board headed by Davis.
   Davis spokesman James Fingeroth said the California billionaire
does not intend at this time to solicit votes against the current
board.
   He said the documents were filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission only to establish a time frame _ Aug. 16 to Oct. 15 _ for
determining which shareholders would be eligible to vote should
there be a proxy battle.
   The filing ``was prompted by press reports that raised the
specter of a transaction which might interfere with the ability of
shareholders to promptly maximize the value of their investment in
UAL,'' said Fingeroth.
   Davis's offer has sparked interest in UAL among other possible
suitors, including the airline's top managers who reportedly met
with the Air Line Pilots Association for discussions of a possible
management-employee buyout.
   Jim Damron, spokesman for the pilots union, refused to comment on
Davis' latest moves.
   In a statement, Davis said his offer could go higher after a
review of the company's financial data.
   He said that by the end of next week he should be able to provide
details of the financing of the proposed deal.

   The stock market opened nearly flat in slow
trading today despite a surprising narrowing of the U.S. trade
deficit in June.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 0.18 point at
2,693.47 after 30 minutes of trading.
   Advancing issues barely outpaced declines on the New York Stock
Exchange with 444 issues up, 430 down and 549 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 29.19 million shares.
   Analysts said the trade report was not a ``turn-on'' for the
stock market, despite a narrowing of the June deficit to $8.17
billion from a revised $10.08 billion in May.
   ``When you look at the composition of the report, it shows strong
exports, which is a sign of economic vitality,'' said Larry Wachtel,
vice president with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A strengthening economy suggests the Federal Reserve might not
move to lower interest rates anytime soon, Wachtel said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.04 to 192.68.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up

   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.51 points
to close at 2,693.29 after bouncing over the 2,700 mark briefly.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with

<HEAD>Hewlett-Packard Reports 3 Percent Drop In Third-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. reported today its
earnings in its third fiscal quarter fell 3 percent, reflecting the
acquisition of Apollo Computer Inc. and continuing problems
predicting demand for its product lines.
   Hewlett-Packard said its earnings for the period ending July 31
totaled $187 million, or 79 cents a share, down from $192 million,
or 80 cents a share, for the third quarter of 1988.
   The $476.4 million acquisition of Apollo Computer in May cut
earnings 13 cents a share, the computer and scientific instrument
maker said. Without the purchase, profits would have been 92 cents a
share, 15 percent higher than the same period last year,
Hewlett-Packard said.
   Revenue, helped by an increase in orders, increased 23 percent,
to $3 billion from $2.43 billion in the third quarter of last year.
   ``Areas of strength included workstations, personal computers and
personal peripherals,'' John A. Young, company president and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
   The company also enjoyed an increase of demand in
test-and-measurement instruments and medical- and analytical-product
orders, he added. However, Hewlett-Packard, like other computer
companies, also saw ``order weakness'' for high-end minicomputers
and electronic components, Young said.
   Hewlett-Packard earlier this week warned investors of
lower-than-expected profits, predicting earnings of between 75 and
80 cents a share. Many analysts had been expecting quarterly
earnings in the 90-cent-per-share range.
   The company said it has stopped hiring and imposed expense
controls as a way of improving profitability.

<HEAD>L.J. Hooker Agrees to Sell Parisian Inc.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled L.J. Hooker Corp. has agreed
to sell its interest in Parisian Inc. to members of the two families
that own the rest of the specialty retail chain.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed Wednesday, but the families
said they will personally finance the repurchase of Hooker's shares
so Parisian's financial stability is not affected.
   ``We're delighted to separate ourselves from the Hooker
situation,'' said Harold L. Abroms, executive vice president of
Parisian. ``It has tarnished our credit reputation terribly, which
was built over six decades.''
   The chain went private in April 1988 when L.J. Hooker bought a
two-thirds interest in it.
   L.J. Hooker last week filed for Chapter 11 protection in
bankruptcy court in New York. Parisian was not included in the
Chapter 11 filing as its operations are profitable.
   Atlanta-based L.J. Hooker is the U.S. subsidiary of Australia's
Hooker Corp. The division is burdened by a debt of $1.2 billion, a
court-appointed representative of the parent company said.
   Parisian, based in Birmingham, Ala., is a 18-store chain. Its
sales for the 12 months ended Jan. 31 were $262 million.
   The company has two stores under construction, and it employs
4,500.
   The sale is subject to approval of the bankruptcy court.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Mostly Lower On Slack Export, Rain Chances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices were mixed and grain
futures fell in early trading on the Chicago Board of Trade today,
reflecting signs of slack export demand and forecasts for rain in
the Midwest.
   Wheat exports have been slow and traders fear that Mexico's bid
for 400,000 metric tons of U.S. corn may be endangered because of
concerns about contamination by aflatoxin, a cancer-causing fungus
that infected some of last year's crop.
   ``The market's looking for fresh export business but we don't see
too much right at the moment,'' said Dale Gustafson, a grain analyst
with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Showers are expected this weekend in the Midwest, where the bulk
of the corn and soybean crop is grown.
   And a National Weather Service six-to-10-day forecast issued late
Wednesday called for above-normal rainfall in the region in the
latter half of next week.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.97 a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 1} cents lower with September at $2.33} a bushel; oats were
{ cent to 2 cents lower with September at $1.36 a bushel; soybeans
were 2{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with August at $6.21 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at
73.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .03 cent
higher with August at 84.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with August at 47.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were unchanged to .25 cent higher with August at 26.87

   Cattle futures settled mixed on Wednesday while pork futures

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Narrows Dramatically in June</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 5th graf, At the, with Fitzwater comment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit improved dramatically in
June to $8.17 billion, the smallest imbalance since December 1984,
the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the June deficit represented a sharp
18.9 percent improvement over a revised May deficit of $10.08
billion.
   The improvement came from a 1.5 percent increase in U.S. exports,
which pushed them to a record level of $30.91 billion, and a 3.6
percent drop in imports, which fell to $39.08 billion. The trade
deficit is the difference between imports and exports.
   The overall deficit of $8.17 billion was the lowest monthly
imbalance since a $6.79 billion deficit in December 1984. The June
figure was immediately hailed as an encouraging sign by the Bush
administration.
   At the vacation White House in Kennebunkport, Maine, presidential
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The decline (in the trade
deficit) was greater than market expectation and certainly is good
news for the country. The continued rising trend in exports is
welcome.''
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the improvement showed
``increasing expertise by American exporters'' in penetrating
foreign markets.
   ``For the first six months, exports increased 15 percent from a
year ago, while imports rose about 8 percent,'' Mosbacher said.
   Economists had been looking for the deficit to narrow, but not by
as large a margin as actually occurred. However, analysts said the
figures did not change their overall prediction that the country's
trade improvement is in danger of stalling out.
   Many economists are predicting that the deficits will begin
rising in the second half of the year as American exports suffer
from the rising value of the dollar. A higher dollar makes U.S.
goods more expensive on overseas markets.
   ``We are looking for a substantial widening in the deficit in the
last part of the year as the value of the dollar begins to cut into
export sales,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting
firm.
   For the first half of 1989, the deficit has been running at an
annual rate of $108.6 billion, down 8.4 percent from last year's
total merchandise trade deficit of $118.5 billion.
   Many economists predict, however, that deficit growth in the last
half of the year will put the total imbalance for the year exactly
where it was in 1988.
   For June, the improvement in exports reflected gains in sales of
big-ticket capital goods and industrial supplies.
   The decline in imports, which put them at their lowest level
since April, reflected declines in imports of automobiles, capital
goods and industrial supplies.
   Another major factor in the June improvement was a sharp drop in
America's foreign oil bill, which fell 11.5 percent to $4.2 billion,
reflecting declines in both volume and price. The amount of imported
oil fell to 7.93 million barrels a day from 8.3 million in May and
the price per barrel dropped to $17.67 from $18.40 in May.
   However, many analysts say oil imports will begin rising in the
second half of the year as U.S. consumption increases and domestic
production falls.
   In fact, an industry group, the American Petroleum Institute,
reported Wednesday that imported oil in July accounted for more than
half of U.S. petroleum needs, the first time that has occurred in 12
years.
   As usual, the largest trade deficit in June was with Japan, an
imbalance of $3.9 billion, down from a May deficit of $4.3 billion.
The deficit with Taiwan totaled $1.2 billion in June, while the
deficit with China was $700 million.
   Some economists said any further significant improvement in the
trade deficit probably will not occur until the country heads into a
recession. An economic slump would cause businesses and consumers to
buy fewer imports, these analysts reason.
   A worsening trade deficit means a double dose of bad news for the
Bush administration. The administration based its predictions of
healthy economic growth partly on a belief that exports would keep
expanding. If this does not occur, it means that the federal budget
deficit will be higher because tax revenues will be lower.
   Additionally, higher trade deficits increase the pressure on the
administration to erect protectionist trade measures to keep out
imports, something that it opposes.

   Volume on the Big Board totaled 82.04 million shares.
   The stock and bond markets rallied briefly in response to the
June merchandise trade deficit. But after a closer look at the
report, bond prices tumbled and the stock market followed.
   ``When you look at the composition of the report, it shows strong
exports, which is a sign of economic vitality,'' said Larry Wachtel,
vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The Commerce Department reported the June U.S. trade deficit
narrowed to $8.17 billion from a revised $10.08 billion in May.
Exports increased 1.5 percent to a record level of $30.91 billion
while imports fell 3.6 percent to $39.08 billion.
   ``The concern is that the gap shows the economy was stronger than
people thought,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A.G.

   A strengthening economy diminishes hopes that the Federal Reserve
will lower interest rates.

   Congress' search for budget savings thus far
this year still leaves a projected $141 billion deficit for fiscal
1990, enough to require across-the-board cuts in most spending
programs, the Congressional Budget Office said today.
   CBO also forecast that if Congress approves all the savings
envisioned in next year's budget blueprint, the shortfall still
would be $118 billion _ well above the $110 billion target set in
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   ``The key message is that we have a very long way to go if the
deficit is to be brought down to a level Americans will be
comfortable with,'' CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer said at a news
conference.
   If current estimates prove accurate, he added, budget year 1991
will require a deficit-reduction package more than twice the size of
any previous effort.
   The projections by CBO, a legislative agency that supplies
non-partisan fiscal guidance to Congress, play no role in
Gramm-Rudman procedures. It is the deficit estimates of the White
House's Office of Management and Budget _ usually more optimistic
than CBO _ that are legally binding.
   The CBO figures are, however, respected by lawmakers and private
economists, who use them to measure the fiscal effects of programs
and legislative proposals.
   If Gramm-Rudman deficit targets are surpassed, spending cuts in
defense and many domestic programs can be automatically triggered.
The final decision on whether cuts are needed is made Oct. 15.
   The budget office's estimates include President Bush's recent
approval of the savings and loan bailout law, the cost of a drought
bill and another emergency spending measure that became law this
year.
   The administration today had no specific early reaction to the
CBO report, presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters in Kennebunkport, Maine, where Bush is vacationing.
   Fitzwater blamed part of the discrepancy between the CBO estimate
and the White House figures on different accounting procedures used
by the two branches of government.
   When Congress returns after Labor Day from summer recess, it will
have nearly four weeks of work left to find additional savings
before the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 1990. Among the measures lawmakers
are considering is one producing about $13 billion in savings from
spending cuts and new tax receipts.
   Congress enacted a $1.17 trillion budget blueprint for fiscal
1990 in May. Many of the savings contemplated in that budget,
however, are considered unlikely to be achieved.
   For example, conflicts between Congress and the White House make
a projected $5.7 billion in asset sales extremely unlikely.
   CBO estimates that the S&amp;L bailout law will add $14 billion to
this year's deficit, $4 billion to the 1990 shortfall and a total of
$10 billion over the next four years.
   OMB's projections of the effect of the S&amp;L bill are expected to
be much different.
   Because the bailout's spending next year won't count on the
budget, OMB is expected to count a savings of about $12.5 billion
resulting from the measure's passage, according to the Republican
staff of the Senate Budget Committee. The savings are claimed
because without the new law, the spending would be on the budget.
   CBO projects a $161 billion deficit for this year, up from $155
billion in fiscal 1988.
   The budget office says that with no further action, deficits
would reach $144 billion in fiscal 1991, $141 billion in 1992, $143
billion in 1993 and $128 billion in 1994.
   The 1991 Gramm-Rudman deficit target is $64 billion.
   OMB plans to release its projections next week and it is widely
expected on Capitol Hill that it will forecast a $116 billion
deficit for fiscal 1990.

<HEAD>Attorney General Clears Milken Foundations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nine-month probe has cleared four charitable
foundations created by indicted financier Michael Milken and his
family, the state attorney general's office reported.
   ``There was no evidence that the foundations were injured by any
alleged illegal activities on behalf of the Milkens,'' Deputy
Attorney General H. Chester Horn said Wednesday.
   ``We are extremely pleased and gratified by the results of the
attorney general's investigation,'' said Daniel Murdock, a New York
lawyer who represents the foundations. ``We had hoped and
anticipated that this would be the result.''
   Milken, the onetime head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk
bond department, was indicted along with his brother, Lowell, and a
former associate on 98 criminal counts by a New York federal grand
jury last March. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also
filed suit against the Milkens.
   The Milkens have pleaded innocent to the criminal charges and the
SEC suit is not expected to proceed until that case is resolved.
   The suit and indictments stem from a lengthy investigation into
Milken's activities at Drexel. He recently resigned from the
investment firm and started his own business.
   The Milkens have donated $350 million to the four charitable
foundations since 1982. The donations included $192.4 million by
Milken and his wife in 1987, when he made $550 million at Drexel.
   The organizations, grouped as the Foundations of the Milken
Families, have assets of $380 million. They have made $45 million in
cash donations to dozens of organizations since 1982.
   The foundations' best known program involves cash awards to
outstanding educators in California and three other states.
   California's inquiry focused on six securities transactions at
the foundations between 1982 and 1988 that involved Milken and other
parties related to the organizations.
   One of the transactions was the 1986 sale of $1.45 million in
bonds by the Capital Fund to a company owned by Michael and Lowell
Milken.
   California law permits such so-called related-party dealings if
they do not damage the charitable foundation involved.
   The attorney general's probe determined that the foundations
profited substantially from all six transactions, which authorities
said were conducted at fair-market value.

<HEAD>Key Dates in Wall Street Scandals of the Levine-Boesky Era</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Insider-Freeman Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major developments in Wall Street
securities fraud cases stemming from the Dennis Levine-Ivan Boesky
insider trading scandal:
   May 12, 1986 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission accuses
investment banker Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of
making $12.6 million in profits from illegal trading on inside
information.
   June 5 _ Levine pleads guilty to four felonies, agrees to
cooperate with investigators and surrenders $11.6 million in
ill-gotten gains.
   Nov. 14 _ Speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a $100 million
penalty to settle charges of trading on inside information supplied
by Levine. He agrees to cooperate in a probe of Drexel, its top
financier Michael Milken and others. Feb. 11-12, 1987 _ Prosecutors
arrest Richard Wigton, a vice president at Kidder, Peabody & Co.;
Timothy L. Tabor, a former vice president at Kidder and Merrill
Lynch & Co.; and Robert Freeman, a leading investment banker at
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. All are charged with insider trading.
   Feb. 13 _ Drexel managing director Martin A. Siegel, implicated
by Boesky, resigns, pleads guilty to securities fraud charges and
agrees to cooperate with the government. He emerges as a key witness
who implicates Freeman, Wigton and Tabor.
   Feb. 20 _ Levine is sentenced to two years in prison and fined
$362,000 on charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.
   March 19 _ Securities broker Boyd L. Jefferies, implicated by
Boesky, pleads guilty to two violations of securities laws and agree
to cooperate with investigators.
   April 23 _ Boesky pleads guilty to a single charge of conspiracy
to lie to the SEC, punishable by five years imprisonment and a
$250,000 fine.
   May 19 _ The government drops charges against Freeman, Wigton and
Tabor after a federal judge rejects prosecutor requests for more
preparation time. Prosecutors promise to bring broader charges
against the trio but never do.
   June 4 _ Kidder Peabody agrees to pay $25.29 million to settle
civil fraud charges stemming from the Boesky case.
   Dec. 18 _ Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term and no
fine.
   March 24, 1988 _ Boesky begins serving sentence at a
minimum-security facility in Lompoc, Calif.
   July 5 _ Levine is released from Lewisburg, Pa., federal prison
facility to serve the remainder of his term under minimal
supervision.
   July 6 _ Using information supplied by Jefferies, a grand jury
indicts GAF Corp., vice chairman James Sherwin and two subsidiaries
on stock manipulation charges. It's the first indictment of an
industrial corporation stemming from the Boesky scandal.
   Aug. 4 _ A grand jury indicts five partners in the investment
concern Princeton-Newport Partners and former Drexel trader Bruce
Newberg over an alleged tax fraud scheme, the first-ever
racketeering charges against securities professionals. Defense
lawyers call it a blackmail tactic to pressure defendants into
testifying against Freeman, Milken and Drexel.
   Sept. 7 _ The SEC accuses Drexel, Milken and three other
employees of violating a wide range of securities laws, most in
connection with Boesky.
   Nov. 3 _ A grand jury indicts takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis
on stock manipulation charges. The indictment is based partly on
information supplied by Jefferies.
   Dec. 21 _ Reversing earlier assertions of innocence, Drexel
agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $650 million
in fines and restitution to settle what became the biggest
securities fraud probe in history.
   Dec. 22 _ A grand jury indicts speculator Paul A. Bilzerian on
securities and tax fraud charges stemming from four unsuccessful but
profitable takeover attempts. The indictment is based partly on
information supplied by Jefferies.
   Jan. 10, 1989 _ A federal judge declares a mistrial in the GAF
case because of prosecutorial errors in handling evidence. The case
is retried.
   March 22 _ Drexel trader Lisa Jones is convicted of lying to a
grand jury, the first perjury conviction in the Drexel case. A
federal judge decrees second mistrial in GAF case because of a
deadlocked jury, and schedules a third trial.
   March 29 _ A grand jury indicts Milken, brother Lowell Milken and
former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg on 98 counts of racketeering and
fraud. Potential penalties and fines could exceed $12 billion plus
long prison terms.
   April 13 _ Drexel settles civil fraud case with the SEC, under
terms that subject the firm to unprecedented federal monitoring for
three years and force it to sever ties with Michael Milken.
   April 26 _ A judge rejects Boesky's petition for early release
from prison.
   June 9 _ Bilzerian is found guilty.
   July 6 _ Jefferies is sentenced to five years probation and a
$250,000 fine.
   July 31 _ Princeton-Newport defendants are found guilty,
signaling that juries are capable of understanding complicated
securities-fraud allegations and are willing to convict under the
punitive racketeering laws.
   Aug. 17 _ Freeman agrees to plead guilty to a single felony and
resign from Goldman Sachs.

   Share prices briefly reached 1989 highs during the
trading day on London's Stock Exchange Thursday, partly in response
to better-than-expected U.S. trade figures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended up 14.2
points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,360.0. It touched a 1989 record trading
high of 2,374.8 earlier in the day.
   The market started strongly, then roared ahead on news that the
U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $8.17 billion in June,
down from a revised $10.08 billion in May.
   ``The market just wanted to go forward today,'' one trader said,
``and found any excuse to move higher.''
   However, buying interest began to fade at higher levels and a
nervous opening on Wall Street encouraged the market to fall from
its peaks.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 13.2 points higher at
1,975.0. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 6.0 points to
close at 1,326.39.
   Volume came to a healthy 544.3 million shares, up from 449.8
million shares Wednesday.

   The stock market was broadly lower in moderately
active trading today after an unexpectedly sharp narrowing of the
June U.S. trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 19.54 points to
2,673.75 at 2 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was off 14.04 points
at noon.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by about 2 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange with 925 issues down, 462 up and 533 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 117.33 million shares.
   Wall Street analysts said the market was lower across the
spectrum, with no one group leading the decline.
   ``It's unusually featureless,'' said Eugene Peroni, technical
analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott.
   The stock and bond markets rallied early in response to the June
merchandise trade deficit. But bond prices quickly retreated, and
stocks followed, on renewed concern about the economy's strength.
   The Commerce Department reported the June U.S. trade deficit
narrowed to $8.17 billion from a revised $10.08 billion in May.
Exports increased 1.5 percent to a record level of $30.91 billion
while imports fell 3.6 percent to $39.08 billion.
   ``The concern is that the gap shows the economy was stronger than

   A strengthening economy reduces the likelihood that the Federal
Reserve will lower interest rates.
   Later, the market's concern turned to the strengthening dollar,
traders said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.97 to 191.67.

<TEXT>
   Mississippi's top economic development
official says the state has two images in corporate America _ ``bad
and none at all'' _ and hopes to correct that with a new national
advertising campaign.
   The first of the ads, which describe Mississippi as ``The State
of Change,'' appeared Thursday in the eastern and Chicago editions
of the Wall Street Journal.
   ``We're trying to make a subtle change in the image of
Mississippi,'' J. Mac Holladay, director of the state Department of
Economic and Community Development, said Wednesday at a news
conference. ``We're trying to get corporate America to look at
Mississippi in a different way.''
   The state's history of civil rights conflicts, its high
illiteracy rate and its low average income levels have created a bad
image for the state in some quarters. Holladay has argued that past
image campaigns have failed to reach the right audience and left
many people with no image of the state at all.
   The full-page ad carries a quote from 19th-Century British poet
Alfred Lord Tennyson, a photograph of a space shuttle launch and
copy which points out Mississippi's links to the U.S. space program.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration test facility
in South Mississippi has grown over the past 28 years into the
13,480-acre Stennis Space Center, which houses a space shuttle
engine testing laboratory and scientific think tank employing more
than 5,500 workers, the ad said.
   It also notes that NASA earlier this year decided to build a
solid rocket motor assembly plant in Northeast Missisippi.
   The Wall Street Journal's eastern edition is distributed to East
Coast states from Maine to Florida and in West Virginia, Georgia,
Alabama and Tennessee. The Chicago edition reaches metropolitan
Chicago, Gary, Ind., and Milwaukee.
   A color version of the ad will appear in Forbes, Business Week
and Industry Week magazines. The department placed 17 ads in the
Wall Street Journal, 10 in Business Week, nine in Forbes and five in
Industry Week.
   Additional ads are being developed, Holladay said.
   The second ad will focus on the state's workforce with a photo of
the March 8 edition of National Geographic Magazine as the
centerpiece. The magazine is printed in Corinth.
   The third ad, planned for this spring, is to focus on a new
education reform package on which Gov. Ray Mabus and his staff are
working. Holladay said if the Legislature does not approve the
governor's program, ``We've got a lot of strong things to put in
there.''
   The ads were developed by department staffers at a cost of less
than $30,000. Godwin Group, a Jackson advertising agency, helped
with copywriting and some photography, Holladay said.
   He said the department placed its own ads and has spent about
$818,550 on the campaign.
   The state Legislature in its 1989 session appropriated $2 million
to the department, with the amount to be divided equally among
corporate and tourism advertising programs.
   Holladay said the nine-month program that begins with the Wall
Street Journal ads was ``just a beginning.''
   ``We can't do this just one year and stop the next year,'' he
said.
   Holladay said he would ask the 1990 Legislature to double the
department's advertising budget.

<HEAD>Banco Santander Takes 3 Percent Stake in Kemper Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banco Santander, Spain's fourth-largest
commercial bank, Thursday announced it had taken a 3 percent stake
in Long Grove, Ill.-based Kemper Corp. to prepare for the creation
of a single European market in 1992.
   Sources close to the deal said the bank paid an estimated $60
million for its stake in Kemper, making it one of the largest
shareowners of the parent company of Kemper Financial Companies.
   The bank said the move combined with other recent alliances
``places (the bank) in a unique position among European financial
institutions'' to meet increased competition expected after the
creation of the unified market in the 12-nation European Economic
Community.
   Kemper is among the leaders in the domestic U.S. market in the
management of mutual funds, investment-related insurance products
and brokerage services.
   Through its subsidiary operations, Kemper has offices across the
United States, a network of 3 million clients and more than $55
billion of assets under management.
   The statement also said the Spanish bank and Kemper have signed
an agreement to cooperate in activities ranging from mutual fund
management to investment banking to trading in Spain, the United
States and other countries where both operate.
   The Spanish bank has recently taken aggressive moves to build up
its international presence in advance of 1992, when the EEC is
eliminate most barriers to capital movements.
   In July, the bank reached a deal for Japan's Nomura Securities
Co. to acquire 1.5 percent of the bank and 10 percent of its
investment bank, Banco Santander de Negocios, for an estimated $100
million.
   Banco de Santander has also established a European business
alliance with Royal Bank of Scotland, it which it owns a 10 percent
stake.
   Banco Santander is the holding company for a financial group with
1,608 branches in 36 countries in Europe, America and the Far East
involved in commercial banking, investment banking, leasing,
mortgage banking and asset management.
   As of June 1989, Banco Santander had total consolidated assets of
$34.3 billion. Its pre-tax profits for the first half of 1989
reached $321.7 million, an increase of 32 percent over the same
period last year, the bank said.

<TEXT>
   Opposition by Guatemalan archeological and
environmental officials recently prompted Exxon Corp. to scrap a
multimillion dollar oil drilling project planned among Mayan ruins
in a rain forest, the company says.
   The showdown over the project in the Central American nation came
as the giant oil company faced continued scrutiny and criticism from
government officials and environmentalists in the United States over
the disastrous oil spill in March off the Alaskan coast by the
tanker Exxon Valdez.
   But Exxon said Thursday that its decision to terminate the
project at two sites in central Guatemala _ including the
government-protected El Ceibal national park _ was not prompted by
the U.S. uproar over the Alaskan spill.
   ``While Valdez certainly has focused more attention on Exxon
overall, it did not influence our decision concerning withdrawing
from Guatemala,'' said Exxon spokeswoman Ann Frechette.
   Exxon said it spent $21.4 million during four years of
preliminary testing at the Guatemalan sites.
   The New York-based company received permission to drill from
Guatemala's Ministry of Energy and Mines, but Culture Ministry
archeologists in late May physically blocked Exxon workers from
moving equipment into El Ceibal.
   ``Exxon is a very important company, but Guatemala is more
important,'' Guatemala President Vinicio Cerezo said recently in
announcing Exxon's withdrawal.
   El Ceibal, site of ruins including dirt mounds that archeologists
believe may be Mayan burial sites, was declared a protected area
after Exxon began testing there.
   Frechette said Wednesday that the company received drilling
permission from the Ministry of Energy and Mines in May and
consulted with environmental and archeological officials during the
project's preparation.
   ``What we did was to make a careful study of the vicinity where
we wanted to drill in cooperation with a local archeologist to help
us ensure that where we drilled would not in any way compromise the
integrity of the nearby ruins,'' she said.
   Frechette said that once drilling started, Exxon planned to
monitor the site to keep workers away from Mayan ruins and to
hand-clear dirt from some areas.
   ``In early June when our equipment showed up to enter the park we
were prevented by doing so by members of the Culture Ministry,'' she
said. ``They basically said you cannot enter this park, you cannot
do this work.''
   Vocal opposition also came from the government's National
Commission on the Environment and political figures, according to
reports from Guatemala.
   Several weeks after it was barred from El Ceibal, Exxon decided
to pull out of Guatemala. ``It seemed to be something that was not
going to be resolved,'' Frechette said.
   Exxon formed Esso Exploration Guatemala in 1985 to conduct
exploratory activities. The company conducted preliminary seismic
testing and identified two areas to drill wells. Exxon performed
test drilling at the first site, known as Machaquila, but it proved
unproductive.
   The Guatemala project was one of Exxon's ``frontier exploration
groups'' to identify possible oil and gas deposits around the world.
   Elsewhere in Latin America, Exxon earlier this year closed a
project in Ecuador after conducting exploratory drilling but has an
active exploratory program in northern Argentina. Exxon also is
producing oil and gas and mining coal in Colombia, and mining copper
in Chile.

<HEAD>Venezuelan President Insists on 50 Percent Debt Reduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuelan president Carlos Andres
Perez insisted Thursday that Venezuela will seek a 50 percent
reduction of its estimated $20.3 billion debt with commercial banks,
cautioning that a U.S. trade deficit was partly caused by Third
World debt.
   Perez, speaking in his twice monthly press conference, added that
the position was not an ultimatum.
   ``We cannot say this or nothing. But the conclusion is that we
must seek more or less this 50 percent reduction because it is what
we need,'' said Perez.
   Venezuela has insisted in preliminary conversations with its
commercial creditors that it needs to cut its annual debt burden in
half in order to meet its commitments and generate needed economic
growth.
   Banking representatives rejected Venezuela's initial position
late last month, reportedly claiming Venezuela was in better shape
to meet its debt payments than Mexico, the first country to reach an
agreement with banks on debt reductions.
   Mexico's creditors agreed last month to a three-tiered approach
to reducing that country's $54 billion commercial debt: a 35 percent
reduction in debts, a ceiling on interest rates, or fresh loans to
help make back payments.
   Venezuela stopped paying capital on its $33 billion debt, the
fourth largest in the developing world, in January, and stopped
interest payments in February.
   Perez quoted former President Reagan in warning that if Third
World countries did not succeed in alleviating the burden of foreign
debt, trade deficits in the industrialized countries would grow
worse.
   ``I remember when Reagan said that if Latin America had been
buying U.S. products in the '80s at the same rate they were buying
in the '70s, the U.S. would not be suffering its tremendous trade
deficit,'' he said.
   Latin American economists have called the '80s the ``lost
decade'' as the countries of the region have sunk into an economic
tailspin, blamed largely on the debt burden.

   Stock prices remained broadly lower in moderately
active trading today, but had bounced off their lows after U.S.
trade data that showed surprising strength in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 16.70 points to
2,676.59 at 3 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was off 19.54 points
an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by about 2 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange with 985 issues down, 466 up and 496 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 135.78 million shares.
   Wall Street analysts said the decline was broad-based and came in
response to a fall in the bond market after the trade report.
   Both markets initially rallied after the report but a closer
inspection aroused bondholder concern that the economy is too strong
and that the Federal Reserve won't ease credit.
   The Commerce Department reported the June U.S. trade deficit
narrowed to $8.17 billion from a revised $10.08 billion in May.
Exports increased 1.5 percent to a record level of $30.91 billion
while imports fell 3.6 percent to $39.08 billion.
   ``The concern is that the gap shows the economy was stronger than
people thought,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
   Some analysts said the rising dollar, also in response to the
trade report, was giving the stock market some concern.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 1.08 to 191.56.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was 1.65
lower at 377.95.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, UAL was up 13 at 264}

<HEAD>Ferruzzi Seen As Big Seller Of Soybean Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of soybeans for August delivery fell
sharply Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a sell-off sparked
by ideas that the Italian grain giant Ferruzzi was liquidating some
large holdings.
   Other soybean futures prices closed mostly higher while most
grain futures finished slightly lower.
   Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA, one of the world's largest grain
processors, is believed to hold a large number of contracts to take
delivery of soybeans against the August contract, which expires
Tuesday.
   Heavy selling of soybean contracts Thursday by trading companies
with close ties to Ferruzzi prompted a flurry of selling by others
seeking to profit from the drop in prices that a large-scale
sell-off by Ferruzzi could cause.
   Traders had no proof that Ferruzzi was actually a seller but
``that's the perception,'' said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   The Italian firm is believed to have accumulated a large position
in August soybean futures after being forced by the Board of Trade
to abandon a huge position in the July contract last month.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.97\ a bushel; corn was 2{
cents lower to { cent higher with September at $2.35{ a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 1{ cents lower with September at $1.37 a bushel;
soybeans were 16 cents lower to 6 cents higher with August off 16
cents at $6.07{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Company That Got Bum Rap Because of Name Holds Contest for New One</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with chairman having been on Squeaky Fromme's hit
list; fixes cycle designator.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was bad enough turning up on Squeaky
Fromme's hit list because you are the chairman of a company called
Fluorocarbon Co.
   But when a flood of investors started acting as if the company
was called Toxic Sludge Unlimited, Peter Churm figured it was time
for a name change.
   Since the mid-1950s, his company has made expensive custom seals,
gaskets, bearings and the like from Teflon and related plastics _
materials known as fluorocarbons.
   The products are used by a number of big companies _ Whirlpool
Corp., Caterpillar Inc., Boeing Co., Navistar _ and every space
shuttle that roars off the launch pad has $100,000 in Fluorocarbon
seals aboard.
   ``They are as safe as peanut butter,'' said Churm.
   Tell that to investors who are worried about chlorofluorocarbons,
the compounds used in aerosols and refrigerants that are believed to
eat holes in Earth's protective ozone layer.
   ``A lot of the investors thought that was the business we were
in,'' Churm said.
   ``This has been developing over the last few years, and finally
in the last six months we were getting calls from brokers who would
say, `We're not going to put any of our clients in your stock
because it takes too long to explain that you're not the bad guys.'''
   It's not just would-be stock buyers who have been confused.
Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, the homicidal follower of Charles Manson
who aimed a gun at President Ford, scrawled Churm's name on her
lengthy hit list of businessmen and politicians because he was
Fluorocarbon's chairman.
   Fromme has been locked up since 1975, but it wasn't until this
year that Churm decided to ditch the name.
   There's a twist, however: He's going to let the public pick the
new one.
   Contest entries are due by Aug. 31, with the winner expected to
be announced by the end of September. The prize is 100 shares of
Fluorocarbon stock, which has been trading at about $16 per share
(Churm owns about 10 percent of the 6.5 million shares).
   Churm said more than 1,600 letters have arrived at the company's
headquarters in Laguna Niguel containing 6,000 suggested names, some
more serious than others.
   ``One guy said instead of Fluorocarbon, make it Flour Garden,''
Churm said. ``One letter came from a lady who said, ``If you really
want to clear the air, name it Not Chlorofluorocarbon Inc.'''
   Another wag wrote, ``If you're so concerned about health and the
environment why don't you name it the Oat Bran Co.''
   Most suggestions are more mundane: Surefit Co., Fluoroseals,
Fluorotonics, Polyfluor, American Polymer.
   Churm says the new name will probably sound a lot like the old,
an idea endorsed by Robert Berglass, the chairman of Dep Corp. in
Compton.
   Sales of Dep's Ayds weight-reduction candy had fallen more than
50 percent due to publicity about AIDS before the company caved in
this year by repackaging the product and renaming it Diet Ayds.
   ``We wanted to soften it without completely changing it and
losing the name identification,'' Berglass said. He said sales are
moving back up, although he is reluctant to predict a full recovery.
   Fluorocarbon should also revise instead of abandon its name, he
said.
   ``Change it to Fluorotef, because their biggest product is
Teflon, isn't it?'' Berglass suggested.
   ``That's a good name,'' replied Churm. ``But he's too late.
Somebody else already came up with it.''

   The stock market fell in moderately active
trading today, pressured by a sharply narrower U.S. trade deficit
that showed unexpected strength in the economy.
   Wall Street analysts said the decline was broad-based and came in
response to a fall in the bond market.
   Both markets initially rallied after the report but a closer
examination aroused bondholders concern that the economy is too
strong and that the Federal Reserve might not ease credit.
   The Commerce Department reported that the June U.S. trade deficit
narrowed to $8.17 billion from a revised $10.08 billion in May.
Exports increased 1.5 percent to a record level of $30.91 billion
while imports fell 3.6 percent to $39.08 billion.
   ``The concern is that the gap shows the economy was stronger than
people thought,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
   Although the data is good for the economy, the market is not
satisfied, said Eugene Peroni, technical analyst with Janney
Montgomery Scott.
   ``It's looking for things that would compel the Fed to ease.
Lower interest rates are good because they would tend to fuel the
economy and bring borrowing rates down,'' Peroni said.
   Friday's report on consumer prices could provide further evidence
of the economy's growth. Consensus expectations are for the consumer
price index to edge up 0.2 percent, analysts said.
   But a much higher CPI number could be interpreted as inflationary
and therefore bearish for the market because it would further dim
hopes of the Fed lowering interest rates, analysts said.

   Energy futures prices slipped lower Thursday on
largely technical factors in the absence of any major news.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 29 cents to close at $18.68 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, erasing a
29-cent gain from the previous session. Among refined products
traded on the exchange, unleaded regular gasoline for September
delivery fell 0.58 cent to 52.35 cents a gallon after rising 0.87 on
Wednesday.
   Heating oil futures edged 0.11 cent lower, settling at 51.04
cents a gallon.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said energy futures were retreating slightly in response to a
more than $1 a barrel rise in crude prices during the past two weeks.
   Lebow called the market trendless, with no news on supplies or
production to influence trading.
   ``It's going from one trading range to another,'' he said.

<HEAD>President Says Eastern Will Be Bigger Than Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines President Phil Bakes says the
carrier is doing so well at overcoming its strike that the rebuilt
Eastern will be bigger than first announced.
   ``The airline's going to be larger than what we projected last
April,'' Bakes said in an interview Wednesday evening. ``We will
have more employees, it will service more cities, and we'll have
more airplanes.
   ``We're very pleased,'' Bakes said of Eastern's progress since it
announced plans to rebuild at two-thirds its pre-strike size from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization despite the 5-month-old strike
by its unions. ``What we announced last April was the impossible and
there were a lot of skeptics, to say the least.
   ``The fact is, we're exceeding targets (and) we will accelerate
the schedule a little bit,'' Bakes said.
   Among the revised, increased plans, he said, are:
   _Instead of the 17,000 employees planned, there will be
``18,000-plus, maybe more.''
   _Instead of the 1,700 pilots planned, there will be more ``in the
next year or two, maybe in the next few months in small groups.''
   _Instead of 157 aircraft, Eastern next year will fly from 165 to
180 planes and also has the first nine of 40 new Boeing aircraft on
order available for 1992.
   _Instead of 800 daily flights serving 77 cities, Eastern will
probably add cities and flights, but no figures have been decided
upon.
   _Instead of $1.8 billion in asset sales, the figure may be as low
as $1.5 billion. Fewer assets may be sold because transactions such
as aircraft sales, Philadelphia gates and the Northeast shuttle sale
have earned more money than expected and Eastern is winning back
customers at faster rates than expected, Bakes said.
   Negotiations, reportedly with rival American Airlines, have
continued on the possible sale of another major Eastern asset _ its
South American routes _ but Bakes declined to give details. He said
he wouldn't place odds on whether the routes will be sold.
   A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, which was
meeting in executive session in Washington, said time would tell
whether Bakes' projections hold true.
   ``The company's promised a lot of things since the beginning of
the strike and bankruptcy. Some of them they've delivered and some
they haven't,'' spokesman John Mazor said.
   Mazor said Eastern still has a training bottleneck for newly
hired pilots and also is having trouble hiring mechanics to replace
strikers.
   With the ALPA leadership discussing possibly ending the pilots'
strike, veteran pilots by the dozens crossed picket lines last week.
Eastern last Friday said it had stopped hiring pilots or accepting
strikers back.
   Bakes said Eastern has 750 to 800 union pilots who are crossing
picket lines. He said it has graduated 300 new pilots and has 700 in
training.
   ALPA contends that any union pilot must get job preference over a
pilot still in training, but Bakes said Eastern is committed to
protecting the pilots in training.
   ``They became employees of the company the day they started
training,'' he said. ``The people who came back last week ought to
get down on their hands and knees and thank the people who are in
training, who left jobs at other carriers, left their jobs at
corporations, retired from the military, moved their families, took
their chances.
   ``We are going to protect those people. That's why we shut the
door. They are going to be out flying,'' Bakes said. ``The fact is,
most of the people still out there (striking) have lost their
careers at Eastern Airlines. That's sad and that didn't have to be.
But we don't look back. We have to move forward.''
   He said Eastern has hired about 800 new mechanics since the
strike started March 4, had 150 Machinists union members cross
picket lines, and has 1,000 non-union supervisors assigned to
maintenance duties. Eastern plans to have 2,400 to 2,500 mechanics,
but will contract out routine maintenance as needed, Bakes said.
   Eastern is temporarily leasing 15 planes and crews from sister
carrier Continental Airlines to meet its planned increase in
schedule Sept. 7, when Eastern says it will jump from 390 daily
flights to 600. Bakes rejected suggestions that the deal is another
example of how predominantly non-union Continental is being used to
break Eastern's strike and how Eastern cash is ``upstreamed'' to
Texas Air Corp., parent of Eastern and Continental.
   Bakes said such ``wet-lease'' deals are traditional in the
airline industry and that Eastern will profit on the routes flown
for it by Continental.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply worldwide on Thursday,
bolstered by a better-than-expected U.S. trade report, but its gains
were capped by profit-taking and uncertainty over whether the upward
momentum can continue.
   The rise brought the dollar back to almost to the highs reached
in June, the period of its most recent rally.
   Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery gained 10 cents to close at
$368.30 troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was
bid later at $366.20 an ounce, down from $366.50 on Wednesday.
   The U.S. currency began gaining ground following a Commerce
Department report that showed the June trade deficit narrowed to
$8.17 billion _ the smallest since December 1984 and down
dramatically from a revised gap of $10.08 billion in May.
   A low deficit is seen as positive for the dollar because it makes
traders believe the currency probably won't have to decline any
further to help improve the U.S. trade picture.
   ``The market believes that we're heading for a soft landing and
not a recession for the time being,'' said Scott Horwitz, a vice
president at the Bank of Boston.
   ``With that in mind, the market is tempted to think the (Federal
Reserve) may not ease as rapidly as we thought,'' he added,
referring to interest rates. Lower interest rates make U.S.
securities more expensive and, therefore, less attractive to foreign
investors.
   Profit-taking both at home and abroad as well as rumors of
intervention took the dollar down from its peak levels in hectic
trading.
   ``The variables here are the central banks,'' said Ian Spence,
chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. ``There's a lot of
uncertainty over whether the dollar will go much higher.''
   Traders also were looking to Friday's release of the consumer
price index for July for further evidence that economic growth is
continuing and that monetary policy need not be altered.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar firmed to 142.32 Japanese yen from
142.20 late Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar traded sharply
higher at 143.95 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 143.53 yen,
up from 142.19 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.5590 late Thursday, cheaper
for buyers than Wednesday's $1.5735. In New York, one pound cost
$1.5605, less expensive than $1.5805 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates included: 1.9637 West German marks, up from 1.9420;
1.6925 Swiss francs, up from 1.6716; 6.6280 French francs, up from
6.5615; 1,412.25 Italian lire, up from 1,395.00, and 1.1819 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1778.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's late
rates included: 1.9690 West German marks, up from 1.9500; 1.6980
Swiss francs, up from 1.6790; 6.6325 French francs, up from 6.5835;
2.2190 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1905; 1,412.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,397.50, and 1.1815 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1822.
   Gold bullion prices varied. Gold closed at $366.35 a troy ounce
in London, up from $365.75 on Wednesday. But in Zurich, gold slipped
to $365.25 an ounce, from $366.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed
at $366.45 a troy ounce, down from $368.25.
   Silver prices also were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $5.246 a troy ounce from $5.186
late Wednesday. Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.20 a troy
ounce, down from $5.24.

<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 462 money market mutual
funds rose by $2.29 billion in the latest week to a new all-time
high of $340.51 billion, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   It was the seventh straight week of new records in the fund
assets, despite a decline in interest rates that has made such
investments less attractive.
   The rise broke the record set a week earlier of $338.21 billion,
revised downward slightly from the $338.35 billion figure originally
reported.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 227 general purpose funds rose $1.74 billion to $108.76
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds rose $1.61 billion to
$146.26 billion, and assets of 140 institutional funds declined
$1.05 billion to $85.48 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday was 8.33 percent, unchanged from the previous
week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in
Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.45 percent from 8.53 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 40
days, down from 41 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts fell to 6.46 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.47 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was unchanged at 5.11 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.25
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.27 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.25 percent on 1-year CDs,
unchanged; 8.17 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and 8.17 percent
on 5-year CDs, up from 8.16 percent.

   Concern about interest rates shook the stock
market Thursday and sent prices down in the busiest day this week.
   The drop came in response to a sharp decline in the bond market
after release of the June U.S. trade deficit report. The numbers
showed a surprising narrowing of the deficit that suggested
underlying strength in the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.66 points to
finish at 2,679.63, after trading down about 25 points during the
session. Last Thursday, the Dow Jones average closed at 2,712.63,
near the all-time high of 2,722.42 reached in August 1987.
   The Dow Jones transportation average gained 26.67 to set another
record at 1,428.34, due largely to takeover speculation in airline
stocks.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by a margin of about 8 to 5
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
887 issues down, 561 up and 540 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 157.56 million
shares, up from 150.06 million in Wednesday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 185.56 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that the June U.S. trade deficit
narrowed to $8.17 billion from a revised $10.08 billion in May. The
improvement was due mainly to a 1.5 percent increase in exports to a
record level of $30.91 billion while imports fell 3.6 percent to
$39.08 billion.
   The stock and bond markets initially rallied after the report,
which eased recession worries. But closer inspection aroused
bondholders concern that the economy is too strong and that the
Federal Reserve might not ease credit conditions.
   What should have been interpreted as good news for the overall
economy was bad news for the market, said Larry Wachtel, analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``The market is concerned that if the economy is too bubbly the
Fed will not accommodate and lower interest rates,'' Wachtel said.
   Some Wall Street analysts said, however, that the market was
overreacting.
   ``It's a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks when bonds go down,''
said Philip Roth, equities analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
``But that's misplaced because economic strength is good if not
accompanied by inflation or too strong an economy.''
   Roth said while the fear is that the Fed will not lower interest
rates, ``company earnings are not going to be killed by the Fed not
easing.''
   Despite the busier pace, the market was ``unusually
featureless,'' with the exception of airline stocks, traders said.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $11.781 billion, or 0.35
percent, in value from Wednesday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.69 to 191.95.
   Among most actively traded issues on the NYSE, UAL Corp., parent
of United Airlines, rose 14| to 266] on news that billionaire suitor
Marvin Davis raised his bid to $275 a share, or $6.19 billion.
   Delta Air Lines rose 1 to 75\, Continental Bank gained \ to 25
and AT&amp;T rose \ to 39].
   Hewlett Packard, meanwhile, fell 1{ to 51, Navistar lost \ to 4~
and Bristol Meyers dropped [ to 47}.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.46 to 394.27, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index declined 1.21 to 344.45.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.04 to 460.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 378.34, down 1.26.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Rally Strengthens; Supply Worries Mount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices rocketed higher Thursday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, extending to seven days a rally fueled by miner
strikes, tightening supplies, bullish chart signals and signs of
renewed economic strength.
   On other markets, soybeans for August delivery tumbled; energy
futures were lower; most livestock and meat futures advanced ahead
of a government cattle report; and precious metals were narrowly
mixed.
   Copper settled 2.9 cents to 4.5 cents higher on heavy volume with
the contract for delivery in August at $1.2675, the highest
settlement of a spot contract since May 5. The more active September
contract settled at $1.2625, which represents a 15 percent gain
since Aug. 8.
   Copper prices reached a record high of $1.6475 a pound last Dec.
8.
   Prices initially rose Thursday following the Commodity Exchange's
report that stocks of copper stored for delivery against futures
contracts had dropped by 1,140 tons Wednesday to 16,708 tons.
   Traders follow the daily Comex stocks reports as an indicator of
overall supplies. Wednesday's sharp drawdown reinforced fears that
miner strikes in Peru and Canada, as well as production problems in
other copper-rich nations, are cutting into supplies as the seasonal
peak demand period _ which begins in the fall and ends in the earlyl
spring _ approaches.
   Analysts said the September contract pierced considerable
technical resistance at $1.23 a pound, bringing in further buying
that brought it to within about 5 cents of its lifetime high of
$1.3150, reached on March 8.
   Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. said the rally was almost
entirely technically inspired, but he also cited the Commerce
Department's report of a strong improvement in the trade deficit.
The report signals economic strength, a key component of copper
demand.
   Soybeans for August delivery fell 15{ cents a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a sell-off sparked by ideas that the
Italian grain giant Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA was liquidating some
large holdings. The contract settled at $6.08 a bushel.
   Heavy selling of soybean contracts Thursday by trading companies
with close ties to Ferruzzi prompted a flurry of selling by others
seeking to profit from the drop in prices that a large-scale
sell-off by Ferruzzi could cause.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with September at $3.97\
a bushel; corn was 2\ cents lower to } cent higher with September at
$2.35} a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{ cents lower with September
at $1.37 a bushel; soybeans were 15{ cents lower to 6 cents higher
with the September contract at $5.84 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in cautious trading ahead of a monthly
Agriculture Department report showing 4 percent fewer cattle on
feedlots Aug. 1 than on the same date a year ago. That number was
near market expectations, but the report also showed more cattle
placed on feedlots in July than expected, which could trigger a drop
in prices on Friday.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .60 cent higher with August
at 73.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .27 cent
higher with August at 84.65 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent lower
to .70 cent higher with August at 47.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent lower to .80 cent higher with August at 26.77
cents a pound.
   Most energy futures prices slipped lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on largely technical factors in the absence of
any major news.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 29 cents lower to 14
cents higher with September at $18.68 a barrel; heating oil was .11
cent to .36 cent lower with September at 51.04 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .28 cent to .58 cent lower with September at
52.35 cents a gallon.
   Gold settled 10 cents lower to 10 cents higher on the Commodity
Exchange with August at $368.30 a troy ounce; silver was 5.8 cents
to 6.3 cents higher with September at $5.265 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Cocoa Price Support Relaunch Plan in Doubt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBIN STAINER</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New proposals from cocoa producers to relaunch the
price-support system in world markets are unlikely to be accepted by
consumers, officials of the cocoa-buying nations said Thursday.
   The producers were expected to confer in Africa later this month
on the proposals, their officials said.
   Earlier this year, the price of cocoa dropped to a 13-year low.
The price was a modest $1,311 a ton in London this week.
   Cocoa is the source of 30 percent of the foreign exchange
earnings of Ivory Coast _ the biggest cocoa producer _ and is an
even more important earner for Ghana.
   The proposals are from a private consultant who has not been
publicly identified and who is believed to be backed by Ivory Coast.
The proposals were called ``wrong on crucial points'' and
``outrageously unrealistic'' by some industry experts.
   Earlier this month, Ivory Coast confirmed it was working on an
initiative to revive the cocoa agreement's market-support regime,
which is administered from London by the 41-nation International
Cocoa Organization.
   Since then, the private consultant, acting on behalf of a U.S.
company that recently bought 500,000 metric tons of new-crop Ivorian
cocoa, has drafted a discussion document for the Cocoa Producers'
Alliance on how the pact could be resurrected.
   The alliance groups all key producers and was expected to meet in
Africa at the end of August.
   The cocoa pact's regulatory provisions have been frozen for 18
months because of a dispute between its producer and consumer
members over the minimum price a proposed new stockpiling scheme
should defend and a lack of cash to finance it.
   The cash shortage is the result of arrears in producer payments
to the cocoa organization of almost $115 million. Ivory Coast is the
largest debtor, owing $70 million.
   According to the consultant's document, producers would be asked
to pay at least part of their debts.
   Consumer officials say the implementation of most proposals would
mean amending the cocoa treaty, a process requiring lengthy legal
procedures involving the United Nations.
   It is not yet certain whether the document will form the basis
for a joint producer proposal to consumers on reviving the cocoa
pact at the next cocoa organization meeting in London in September.
   Members are to make a decision then on what should happen when
the pact expires at the end of September next year.
   Traders said if the pact's control function is revived next month
this would boost the chances of a decision to extend the accord with
its regulatory power intact for one or two more years.
   If there is no extension, the 250,000-ton stockpile already held
by the cocoa organization will have to be liquidated under current
rules within 4{ years from September 1990.
   Traders said the sale of so much cocoa would pull down prices,
already depressed by five straight seasons of overproduction and the
prospect of another in 1989-90.

<HEAD>Money Supply Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three leading measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Aug. 7, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,132.4 billion from $3,127.5 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,011.3 billion from $4,005.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $778.7 billion from $775.7 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 2.7 percent,
which is below the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The
annual growth rate in M3 is 4.1 percent, which is within the Fed's
target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,096.9 billion, a 2.7
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,979.5 billion, up 3.3 percent, while M1 fell
5.2 percent to an average of $774.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $520 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$654 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $292.1 billion in the two-week period ended Aug. 9, up from
$289.5 billion two weeks earlier.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production and inventory problems produced a
loss at Sun Microsystems Inc., the computer workstation maker, while
creating flat earnings for industry giant Hewlett-Packard Co., the
companies reported Thursday.
   Analysts said the reports, along with a prediction by
semiconductor manufacturer Intel Corp. that its third-quarter
profits could fall, reflected a generally flat computer market and
as well as shifting marketing strategies by the companies and
problems associated with those changes.
   Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View, one of the leading makers
of technical workstations, said it lost $20.3 million in its fiscal
fourth quarter ended June 30, in contrast to a profit of $25.3
million, or 33 cents a share, in the final quarter a year earlier.
Revenue increased 18 percent to $431.2 million from $365.1 million.
   For the fiscal year, Sun's earnings fell 8 percent to $60.8
million, or 76 cents a share, from $66.4 million, or 89 cents a
share, for 1987. Revenue for the year was up 68 percent to $1.77
billion from $1.05 billion.
   ``The problems the company has are growing pains; the demand
didn't match what they planned in their marketing department,'' said
Lisa Morgenthaler, an analyst with the California Technology Stock
Letter in San Francisco. Sun was founded in 1982.
   Steve Ossad, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco, warned the company could continue losing money.
   ``I don't sense that it's turned around,'' Ossad said. ``I
couldn't rule out continued negative surprises.''
   Company President Scott McNealy, who has headed what had been one
of the fastest-growing companies in the country, in June warned
investors of the impending loss and last month hinted that a return
to profitability wasn't certain in the current quarter. On Thursday,
the company reiterated that profits ``cannot be assured'' for the
first quarter.
   McNealy and analysts attributed the fourth-quarter loss, the
company's first since going public in 1986, to a transition to a
line of new products, saying the company was unable to meet demand
for the new products introduced in April.
   Meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto reported a 3 percent
drop in third-quarter earnings for the period ending July 31 on a 23
percent increse in revenue. from $2.43 billion in the third qurater
of last year to $3 billion for the period just ended.
   Earnings were $187 million, or 79 cents a share, down from $192
million, or 80 cents a share, for the third quarter of 1988. Revenue
increased from 2.43 billion in the third qurater of 1987 to $3
billion for the period just ended.
   The report reflected Hewlett-Packard's $476 million acquisition
in May of Apollo Computer Co., an industry leader in the technical
workstation market, and two months of Apollo's operating results.
   John A. Young, company president and chief executive officer,
said the purchase cut earnings 13 cents a share and that otherwise
profits would have been 92 cents a share, 15 percent higher than the
same period last year.
   For the latest quarter, HP said it experienced faltering demand
for high-end minicomputers and electronic components. But HP
apparently had unexpected demand for so-called ``low-end'' products,
such as workstations, personal computers and PC peripherals.
   ``Their earnings shortfall is not dramatic in any shape or
form,'' said analyst Bob Herwick of Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San
Francisco.
   Hewlett-Packard said it had halted hiring except for select sales
and support positions and imposed expense controls.
   Intel, the Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker, said in a statement
Wednesday that its third-quarter performance would be hurt by
slower-than-expected sales of its 80386 microprocessor, the heart of
many top-of-the-line personal computers.

   Northwest Airlines said Thursday it has agreed
to buy up to 30 more Airbus Industrie jetliners for $2.7 billion,
giving the carrier confirmed orders for 61 of the low-noise,
high-technology jets and options for 79 more.
   The order, which confirms options Northwest has held since April
1987, calls for 20 A340s, which cost $93 million each and seat up to
280 passengers, and 10 A330s, which cost $86 million each and seat
up to 330 passengers, according to Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons.
Four of the A330s are being taken on option.
   ``The A330s and A340s offer Northwest fleet commonality and the
benefits of advanced technology, lower operating costs and superior
cargo-carrying capability,'' Steve Rothmeier, chairman of
Northwest's parent NWA Inc., said in a statement.
   Northwest is the first North American airline to purchase A340s,
while it and Trans World Airlines are the first North American
carriers to buy A330s, said Airbus spokesman Gregg Schulte.
   Both planes are still being tested, Gibbons said.
   Northwest, which had no A340s on order previously, expects to
receive the 20 ordered Thursday in 1992, he said.
   The four-engine widebody aircraft, powered by CFM International
CFM56-5 engines, will be used on Northwest's extensive trans-Pacific
routes. It has a range of up to 8,600 miles.
   Northwest already has 10 A330s on order and expects to receive
those in 1994, Gibbons said. The carrier expects to add the
additional six to its fleet in 1995.
   The A330, a twin-engine widebody with a range of more than 5,200
miles, will be powered by Pratt and Whitney PW4000 engines and will
be used on major domestic and trans-Atlantic routes, Northwest said.
   On July 1, Northwest became the first North American carrier to
add Airbus A320 jetliners to its fleet.
   The carrier has three of the twin-engine, widebody planes in its
315-plane fleet and expects to add four more by the end of the year.
Twenty-five of the planes should be in use by March 1992. Northwest
has an option for 75 more A320s, Gibbons said.
   With Thursday's orders and other previously announced orders and
options, Northwest could operate 140 Airbus aircraft by the end of
the 1990s, Gibbons said.

<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. on Thursday announced
the resignation of a top official as part of a major shakeup in the
troubled computer firm's worldwide sales and marketing operations.
   Wang Chairman and Chief Executive An Wang said Ian W. Diery would
step down as executive vice president for worldwide operations in a
reorganization that would direct more responsibility to geographic
sales management teams.
   The restructuring follows last week's ouster of Frederick Wang,
son of founder An Wang, as president and chief operating officer and
a financial crisis that led the firm to halt payment on more than
$200 million in debt.
   An Wang said in a statement the move affects sales groups for the
company U.S. operation, European, African and Middle Eastern
operation, and American and Asian-Pacific operation.
   An Wang said the senior vice presidents in charge of each
operation will report directly to acting president Harry H.S. Chou.
   The company recently announced a $424 million quarterly loss and
this week halted payments on $208.6 million in institutional debt
while continuing negotiations with lenders.
   Founded in 1951, Wang grew from a small calculator maker in the
1960s into a billion-dollar manufacturer of word processing systems
for businesses in the 1970s.
   But the company failed to take advantage of the personal coputer
revolution this decade, sticking instead with high-priced systems
that weren't compatible with International Business Machines Corp.
equipment.

<HEAD>`Goldfinger' Posgate Cleared of Insurance Conspiracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ian Posgate, a former star insurance underwriter
with Lloyds of London, was acquitted Thursday of conspiracy to steal
$60 million of insurance funds to buy a personal stake in a Swiss
bank.
   The case had threatened Lloyds' 300-year-old reputation for
reliability when it broke in 1982.
   Posgate, 57, was called ``Goldfinger'' at the height of his
success for his Midas touch in the City of London financial
district. He took high risks in undercutting premiums to become the
world's single largest insurer of shipping, with 25 percent of the
market.
   ``I can only say that I feel totally vindicated after seven very
long years,'' Posgate said Thursday after the 15-week trial at
Southwark Crown Court in London.
   He said he would not return to Lloyds.
   Posgate had managed Lloyds underwriting syndicates controlled by
the brokerage firm Alexander Howden. Posgate's co-defendant, former
Howden Chairman Kenneth Grob, 68, also was cleared of theft charges.
   The verdict came after three days of deliberations by the jury of
seven men and five women.
   Prosecutor Michael Hill alleged that Posgate was lured into a
plot masterminded by Grob that siphoned off millions of dollars from
their syndicates into secret off-shore holdings in Panama.
   Hill said the money was moved to Lichtenstein to purchase the
Banque du Rhone et de la Tamise in Geneva.
   Grob resigned immediately after Howden's was taken over in
January 1982 by the U.S. insurance company Alexander and Alexander
Services Inc. for $255 million.
   Posgate said he was taking part in legitimate insurance dealing
and Grob said contracts signed were legitimate reinsurance to the
benefit of Howden's and he never spent any of the money.
   Posgate was cleared by a Lloyds disciplinary committee in 1984,
which found he was not involved in an agreement to use money taken
from his syndicate to buy the bank. But he was arrested on similar
charges in 1987.

   Lorimar Telepictures Inc. filed a $126 million

   Disney immediately filed a $42 million countersuit, alleging it
had been fraudulently induced into entering into the Metrocolor
partnership. Disney claims it was prevented from selling its share
of the lab.
   The Burbank-based entertainment giant also alleges that Lorimar
has refused to return to Disney footage from its films ``Beaches''
and ``Turner and Hooch'' and footage from movies made for Disney's
theme parks.
   Both lawsuits were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.
   Lorimar maintains that Disney and its subsidiaries are refusing
to pay more than $8 million in film processing costs incurred at the
Los Angeles Metrocolor facility, founded in 1987.
   Lorimar's lawsuit alleges that early this year ``Disney began to
express displeasure that the Metrocolor lab was not as profitable as
Disney had anticipated, and Disney began to press plaintiffs for
concessions.''
   The concessions, the lawsuit states, imposed a ``heavy and
unjustified burden'' on Lorimar. Disney announced in June that it
would no longer honor the partnership, according to Lorimar's
lawsuit.
   Lorimar's court action seeks the $8.2 million Disney allegedly
owes for work done at Metrocolor and an affiliated lab, at least $18
million in damages for breaches and misconduct, and more than $100
million in punitive damages.
   The Disney suit alleges that it entered into the partnership in
the belief that it could sell its stake, but was unaware that
certain restrictions prevented any sale until 1992.
   Disney says that a buyer, the Rank Organization, offered no less
than $65 million for controlling interest in the lab last year.
Disney also says that income from processing was not as high as the
company had been led to believe it would be.
   In addition to asking for return of the film stock, the Disney
suit seeks at least $30 million in damages.

   UAL Corp. directors reviewed California
billionaire Marvin Davis's latest buyout offer Thursday but said it
was premature to make any decision on whether to sell the company.
   The 16-member board of United Airlines' parent company also
confirmed speculation they had been contacted by other potential
buyers and that their financial advisers had met with an employee
group.
   A company statement did not specify what employee group, and UAL
spokeswoman Sara Dornacker refused to say if it was the pilots,
whose union has expressed interest in buying UAL.
   Ms. Dornacker also would not say what other potential buyers
other than Davis have surfaced.
   ``The board concluded that it was still premature to make a
decision as to whether a sale of the company to any party was
appropriate,'' the board said in a statement after Thursday's
meeting.
   The statement added that ``all possible financial and strategic
alternatives should continue to be pursued.''
   On Wednesday, Davis turned up the heat on the board by offering
to ante up another $800 million, raising his bid to $6.19 billion,
or $275 a share. That total represented a 15 percent increase over
Davis' original offer two weeks ago. Davis also said his offer could
go higher after a review of the company's internal data.
   After the meeting, Davis said in a statement that he and his
associates are awaiting ``with interest the board's conclusions and
continue to look forward to working with UAL's board, management and
labor groups to develop a transaction that works to the benefit of
all parties concerned.''
   UAL _ parent company of United Airlines, the nation's
second-largest carrier _ has 22.5 million shares outstanding.
   UAL stock, which had climbed a dizzying $90 per share in less
than two weeks in anticipation of a bidding war for the company,
jumped $14.62{ a share to $266.37{ in consolidated New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   Davis' announcement Wednesday sought to portray his offer as
friendly, apparently hoping to avoid alienating United pilots and
other employee groups whose cooperation could prove crucial to any
takeover attempt.
   But Davis did say if the bid was successful, he intended to
replace the 16 directors with five _ including himself; his two
sons, John A. Davis and Gregg J. Davis; and James Kneser, a top
Davis aide.
   He said he would retain UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, credited with
helping turn the company around.
   Davis also filed a consent solicitation with United, ensuring the
company would not issue new stock to an employee-ownership plan or
another proxy that could be used to thwart a takeover.
   Davis apparently was not the only one trying to anticipate
United's next move.
   Speculation in recent days suggested that Wolf, in conjunction
with other UAL executives, may plan a bid for the company himself _
or recapitalization with employee ownership. There also has been
talk that buyout firms Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co., and
Forstmann Little &amp; Co. have contacted UAL about a possible deal.
   The airline's pilots' and machinists' unions also have been
mentioned as key players in any scenario for restructuring the
company. The United unit of the Air Line Pilots Association, with
7,125 members, made a bid for the company as recently as 1987.
   ``All we're aware of is that there's a board meeting. We won't
speculate what's going on, but I will say our leadership is in
constant touch with our financial and legal advisers,'' said Hank
Krakowski, a spokesman for the pilots.
   He said membership had not taken a position on a possible
acquisition of the company by Davis ``or any outsiders in general.''
   While declining to confirm reports about a scheduled meeting
between the pilots, the machinists and Davis, Krakowski noted the
letter sent by union officials to member pilots earlier this week,
which said ``concessions in exchange for equity was an option they
may have to face.''
