   Grand opera as grand as it gets filled the
Metropolitan Opera stage in the first performance this season of
Verdi's ``Don Carlo.''
   James Levine conducted on Friday night, bringing out the opera's
orchestral glories and at times threatening to drown out the
singers. But the soloists had powerful lungs and the large chorus
soared vocally over the orchestra.
   Tenor Neil Shicoff was Don Carlo, betrothed to Elizabeth,
daughter of the French king. After they meet and fall in love they
discover that a treaty has given her to Carlo's father, Philip II of
Spain. The fallout from that, plus the Spanish Inquisition, is
plenty for an opera, even one as long as ``Don Carlo.''
   Shicoff began too loud but quickly settled into a well-sung,
feeling portrayl. Margaret Price sang Elizabeth. Her voice is
beautiful, smooth and large. At the end of the third long scene,
singing to a banished countess, Miss Price sounded tired. But she
recovered before Act 2.
   Both Shicoff and Miss Price were singing their parts for the
first time at the Met.
   Baritone Bernd Weikl as Rodrigo was more brusque than subtle. He
sounded as though he were pushing for volume. Ruggero Raimondi, his
voice very focused, was impressive as King Philip.
   Tatiana Troyanos, always a favorite of the Met audience, was fine
as Princess Eboli. She didn't wear the eye patch that was part of
the costume when this production was new 10 years ago. The real
Eboli wore one but since ``Don Carlo'' is more drama than history
and the stage eye patch was distracting, Miss Troyanos was better
off without it.
   The auto-da-fe scene was lavish with clerics, onlookers and flag
wavers. The royals and Grand Inquisitor (Jan-Hendrik Rootering) wore
black trimmed in gold. Hei-Kyung Hong sounded celestial as the
celestial voice. However, in this staging, she welcomed those burned
into heaven before anybody lighted the fire.
   ``Don Carlo'' was last sung at the Met during the 1985-86 season.

   With record temperatures dipping to 75
degrees below zero and Alaska's cold snap showing no sign of
breaking, the governor activated the state's emergency services
agency Friday.
   ``We're not declaring an emergency, yet,'' Gov. Steve Cowper said
in a brief radio address, but added that the weather forecast offers
little hope for a break. ``There's no end in sight, apparently,'' he
said.
   Cowper said Alaskans in need of help should first call local
authorities, and then to the state agency, which will be open 24
hours a day. He also announced a toll-free number for the agency.
   The community of McGrath posted the state's low of 75 below zero
overnight and National Guard diesel-powered trucks were among the
few vehicles still operating. The temperature warmed to minus 59 by
11 a.m. Friday.
   Sitka, with the high of 43, was tropical by comparison. Alaska's
largest city, Anchorage, shivered through a high of minus 15. Even
light winds pushed wind chill factors to minus 100 degrees or colder.
   Schools were closed in some towns, including McGrath and Nenana,
and some Kodiak Island communities used exchange agreements to
replenish household heating fuel by obtaining supplies from
well-stocked schools.
   Maj. Gen. John Schaeffer, adjutant general of the Alaska National
Guard, said rural Alaskans who have been in the state for awhile
likely stocked up on essentials before the winter.
   The Brim Frost military exercises involving some 20,000 troops
from Alaska and elsewhere continued, despite the cold, but
temperatures below 80 degrees could force the war games to shut
down, said Army spokesman Chuck Canterbury.

   The 300 cowboys in town this week ain't here to
rope steers or whoop it up at a saloon. No sirree, mister, these
folks are the biggest bunch of prose-packin', simile-slingin',
versifying-est cowboys you ever saw, and they're here for the annual
Cowboy Poetry Gathering.
   It ain't all dogie doggerel, and you better smile when you quote
'em, pardner.
   Upwards of 7,000 visitors have jammed this northeastern Nevada
town of 13,000 for the five day-event, which began Wednesday and
wraps up Sunday.
   The area's 40 motels have been booked for weeks. Ten-gallon hats
dot Railroad Avenue and Commercial Street, and more spill out of the
Branding Iron Bar.
   The crowds have come to hear the cowboys recite their bunkhouse
ballads, sing soulful songs and tell of hard and high times on the
range.
   The activities have filled every available meeting place in town,
from the Elko Convention Center to the bar at the Stockman's Hotel.
   The buckaroos don fancy duds for the gathering _ broad-brimmed
Stetsons, silver buckles and handmade pointy-toed boots _ but their
sunburned faces, calloused hands and faraway gaze tell their own
tales of hard and solitary lives.
   One such poet is Waddie Mitchell, who runs 2,000 head of cattle
on a ranch near Jiggs. Before he came to the gathering, he had to
make sure there was enough hay put out and find a baby sitter for
his five children.
   Mitchell began writing verse during long winters on the range.
Like most cowboy poets, he didn't show his work to many people
because poetry didn't quite fit the cowboy image.
   But the first cowboy poetry gathering five years ago brought a
lot of sagebrush scribes off the prairie.
   One of Mitchell's poems tells the plight of Tom O'Dell, found
behind a bar with his throat cut. When ``they got him to the
hospital he wouldn't sign a complaint against the fella who done it
because he was a friend of his.''
   Mitchell and Baxter Black, who will sing and tell stories at the
Saturday night finale, are big guns in the cowboy entertainment
world. They have ben on ``The Tonight Show,'' and Black's records
are available anywhere Western music is sold. Black, a veterinarian
from Brighton, Colo., earns a six-figure income from his
performances.
   Gary McMahan, a singer, songwriter and poet from Bellvue, Colo.,
who claims to have the only yodeling dog, recited this verse at one
gathering:
   ``Two things in life that I really love,
   That's women and horses, of that I'm sure of.
   So when I die please tan my hide,
   And tool me into a saddle so fine,
   And give me to a cowgirl that likes to ride,
   So in the hereafter I may rest,
   Between the two things that I love the best.''
   Besides stage performances, there are informal sessions for
greenhorn poets, singers and storytellers. Exhibitions display
handmade saddles, bits, spurs and other cowboy regalia.
   Tara McCarty of the Western Folklife Center in Salt Lake City,
which coordinates the gathering, said one of the center's biggest
challenges is keeping the cowboy poetry pure.
   That's why they've come up with an ironclad rule: Every
participant has to make a living on the range. No ``drugstore
cowboys'' allowed.

<TEXT>
   A robber who forgot to cut eyeholes in the
plastic garbage bag he wore in a botched motel holdup was sentenced
Friday to 25 years in prison.
   J. Douglas Creswell, 51, was sentenced to concurrent terms for
that holdup and two other armed robberies which he admitted,
according to Keith Milam, assistant district attorney for Beauregard
Parish.
   Milam said Creswell previously was convicted of four other armed
robberies in Texas. Creswell's undoing Milam said, occurred in May,
a week after he held up a clothing store twice last May.
   Milam said Creswell, knife in hand, was pulling a garbage bag
over his head as he entered the lobby of the Park Motel, according
to a statement by motel clerk Monica Stroud.
   Creswell suddenly realized he forgot to make eyeholes in the bag,
the clerk told police. ``So he started pulling on the bag to try to
put some holes in it,'' Milam said. ``And then he asked for the
money.
   ``Well, she said she wasn't going to give him any money and he
left,'' Milam said. The clerk called police and Creswell admitted to
the botched holdup when he was arrested minutes later, Milam said.

   One of the largest processors of George Bush's
favorite snack food is hoping to catapult the product to national
popularity with a new brand: Presidential Pork Rinds.
   ``I'll be on the street with them next week,'' Bill Connor, sales
manager for Evans Food Products Co., said Friday.
   The brand is a take-off on the president's well-known
predilection for the porcine product. A gift jar of pork rinds
replaced Ronald Reagan's crystal container of jellybeans on the
table at Bush's first Cabinet meeting this week.
   ``George Bush has done wonders for pork rinds here this year,''
said Al Rickard, a spokesman for the Snack Food Association in
Alexandria, Va.
   ``My view is, `Skins are in. Pork rinds in '89,''' said Connor,
who sent 3,000 pounds of the crunchy, puffed snack to Washington for
the presidential inaugural ball and in return got an invitation to
the event.
   Pork rinds are fried pieces of hog skin, cooked in hog fat,
stored in pellets for 30 days and fried again for 60 seconds in oil
heated to 400 degrees, ``at which time they explode like popcorn,''
Connor said.
   Evans Food Products, with a plant on Chicago's south side,
supplies pork rind pellets to Dallas-based Frito-Lay, the largest
U.S. marketer of pork rinds, and other companies, Connor said.
   Evans handles about 50 million pounds of pork skin annually.
   He said pork rinds compare favorably to peanuts in fat content
and contain a high percentage of protein. Nutrition experts,
however, say the salted snack has enough calories, fat and sodium to
make it a poor food for all but the most physically active people
with the lowest cholesterol levels.
   The Snack Food Association said pork rind sales totaled $195
million in 1987, a figure dwarfed by sales of potato chips, which
enjoyed $3.8 billion in sales in the $8 billion salty snack food
market.

   The 8,100-acre Stanford University campus
has apparently became a popular place for cat owners to abandon
their pets, officials say.
   An estimated 1,500 cats live in storm drains, steam tunnels and
just about everywhere at the school, says Herb Fong, the manager of
grounds and custodial services.
   Fong said the university will place traps that won't hurt the
animals, beginning Feb. 22. Cats with identification tags will be
released, but those that appear to be untamed will be taken to the
Santa Clara County animal shelter.
   Fong said animal lovers often feed the cats.
   ``They're not tame enough to just take home,'' he said. ``There
are some areas that employees don't want to go into because of the
feral cats that are in there. You get a wild cat trapped in a
corner, they'll be biting and scratching their way out of there.''

   The collision of two vehicles that killed
three students and a man just 100 yards from the school has brought
many in the town together to mourn.
   Many students stopped by a salvage yard to see the smashed
remains of a classmate's car on Friday, a day after three people
were killed in the vehicle.
   School officials in the town 40 miles southeast of Tulsa called
off classes Thursday and Friday.
   The Rev. Dick Knox of Okay First Baptist Church said there was no
easy way to ease the sorrow felt by friends and families of the
victims.
   ``You just touch them. That's all I know, you just touch them. Be
available and try to be sensitive and touch them however you can,''
he said.
   The Rev. Opal Large of Okay Christian Fellowship said some of the
children had attended services at her church in the town of 600.
   ``It doesn't make any difference if they were in our church or
not. We feel close to everybody in Okay and we love them and want
them to know that,'' she said.
   The Oklahoma Highway Patrol identified the dead as Jason
Branchcomb, 17, of Wagoner; Stephanie Hamby, 17, of Okay; her
brother, Jason Hamby, 14, of Okay and James Risinger, 56, of
Wagoner. Branchcomb's brother, Jeffrey, 11, was in stable condition
at Muskogee Regional Medical Center.
   Troopers said the car driven by Jason Branchcomb went out of
control and collided with the pick-up truck driven by Risinger.
   Most of the 600 students in the school learned of the accident
from the wail of ambulance sirens.
   A school assembly was planned for Monday morning.

<TEXT>
   The debacle for Rajiv Gandhi's Congress
Party in a major state election this past week was the latest in a
series of reverses for the prime minister, who will face his own
voter test by the end of the year.
   Gandhi, 44, had a dream start as prime minister _ his party won
four-fifths of the 542 seats in Parliament in 1984 _ but allegations
of corruption, a belligerent opposition headed by a former Cabinet
colleague and successive defeats in state elections raise doubts
about his return for a second term.
   The Congress Party has lost 11 of its last 18 state elections.
The latest defeat was Jan. 21 in populous Tamil Nadu state, where it
won only 26 of the 234 state assembly seats.
   ``Gandhi's problem is a failure at the political level,'' said
Bhabani Sengupta, one of India's foremost political analysts. ``It's
a pity because he came in with a tremendous amount of goodwill and a
tremendous amount of promise.''
   In January 1985, the former airline pilot was sworn in as prime
minister after his Congress Party swept the highest number of
parliamentary seats ever won by a single party since India became
independent in 1947.
   The victory was ascribed mainly to the wave of sympathy for
Gandhi after his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was
assassinated three months earlier.
   But it was helped also by Gandhi's ``Mr. Clean'' image, which
sprang from his age and inexperience in what many people saw as the
dirty world of politics. His stewardship gave the government an
unprecedented honeymoon with the press. Even normally
anti-establishment newspapers were enthusiastic.
   ``The parliamenary election Gandhi won four years ago ... has
created an illusory world for him,'' the Hindustan Times, a usually
pro-government newspaper, said in an editorial this week. ``This
kind of mandate breeds dangerous smugness.''
   The cracks did not appear for almost a year. The first murmurs
against Gandhi began with his inability to solve the lingering
problem of a murderous Sikh insurgency in the northern state of
Punjab.
   The low point came in 1987, when newspapers claimed the Swedish
arms company AB Bofors paid $50 million in bribes to secure a
government contract for artillery guns.
   Gandhi denied involvement. A parliamentary committee cleared the
government of complicity, but the allegations persist and are still
under investigation. In the midst of the allegations, V.P. Singh,
who had held the defense and finance portfolios in Gandhi's Cabinet,
quit the party after building a reputation as a crusader against
corruption.
   Singh went on to win a parliamentary by-election as an
independent running on a clean-government platform. In the past six
months, he has been largely successful in persuading national
opposition parties and regional parties to form a national coalition
opposed to Gandhi.
   In India's 41-year history, no single opposition party has ever
posed a serious threat to the Congress Party. Instead, the
opposition has been splintered among powerful local parties and a
vast array of national parties.
   The only time Congress ever lost a national election was in 1977
when the opposition united after Mrs. Gandhi imposed an emergency
and banned political activity.
   ``If the opposition is united and can present itself as a
creditable alternative, then the Congress (Party) will be in very
serious trouble,'' said Sengupta, the political analyst.
   At least seven parties have joined the anti-Gandhi front, and
together they control seven of India's 25 states. Last week's polls
in Tamil Nadu voted the front's Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party into
power, and the Congress trailed a poor third behind another regional
party.
   ``It will be dangerous for the Congress to believe that what
happened in Tamil Nadu was only a regional phenomenon,'' the
Hindustan Times said. ``No state is out of the national mainstream.
What (happens) at the polling booth in Tamil Nadu has also an impact
on the rest of the country.''

<TEXT>
   America must be ready to use the ``crowbar'' of
retaliation to open world markets, says President Bush's nominee for
top U.S. trade negotiator, while Bush's choice as housing secretary
called the ``appalling problem'' of homelessness his top priority.
   ``Retaliation cannot be the goal of our policy _ in fact, it
signals the failure to open foreign markets,'' Washington attorney
Carla Hills said Friday before the Senate Finance Committee approved
her nomination as U.S. trade representative.
   ``But the credible threat of retaliation provides essential
leverage in our market-opening efforts,'' said the former secretary
of housing and urban development in the Ford administration. ``Thus,
actual retaliation will be used, albeit reluctantly, to preserve the
credibility of this threat.''
   Pledging to fight to open global markets ``with a crowbar if
necessary,'' she said: ``We have to have our agreements enforced,''
she said. ``And where our partners are violating our agreements we
must take action.''
   The panel was unanimous in recommending Senate confirmation of
the 54-year-old California native to succeed Clayton K. Yeutter, who
has been tapped by President Bush for secretary of agriculture. A
confirmation hearing has yet to be scheduled for Yeutter.
   Appearing before another Senate panel, former Rep. Jack Kemp,
R-N.Y., said about homelessness: ``I acknowledge that it is a very
severe problem _ it is an appalling problem. It is an emergency
problem, and I'm willing to treat it as the highest priority,
immediately, of my new leadership at HUD.''
   The 1988 candidate for the GOP presidential nomination avoided
committing himself on most specific spending questions but did
pledge to be an advocate for increased federal efforts to house the
poor.
   He promised to seek full funding of legislation passed by
Congress to provide emergency shelter for the homeless, called the
McKinney Act, and said he favored expanding it in some areas.
   Kemp said he visited privately with leaders of Miami's riot-torn
Overtown and Liberty City areas last weekend when in that city for
the Super Bowl. He said that if confirmed he planned to visit
blighted inner cities and places where the homeless cluster.
   The Senate banking committee took no vote on Kemp's nomination,
but the hearing was filled with bipartisan praise for the nominee,
who is expected to win confirmation easily. A committee vote may
come next week, after Kemp answers additional written questions.
   Mrs. Hills sought to dampen concern that she could become
vulnerable to conflict-of-interest charges because she and her
attorney husband, Roderick Hills, have represented foreign law
clients.
   ``Let me address the question of potential conflicts of interest
right away,'' she said. ``There are none.''
   Lawmakers seemed satisfied when she promised that she and her
husband would divest themselves of any business interests that could
present such a conflict. She also pledged to keep hands off cases
involving her former clients.
   Kemp's appearance was interrupted briefly by six demonstrators
from the Community for Creative Non-Violence, a Washington advocacy
group for the homeless. Two stood up holding a large sign saying
``Housing Now,'' while they and others shouted and turned on a
noisemaking machine.
   The four women and two men were charged with disrupting a
committee of the Congress and demonstrating within a Capitol
building, charges that carry a maximum $500 fine and six-month jail
term.

   Three congressmen with defense-related
committee assignments say they were unaware of receiving illegal
corporate contributions through a consultant who pleaded guilty in
the government's investigation of Pentagon corruption.
   ``The circumstances of this contribution were totally unknown to
me ... and I am returning it immediately,'' Sen. Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn., said in a statement after learning Friday that his campaign
had received $1,000 illegally.
   Rep. Richard Ray, D-Ga., said he was ``extremely upset'' by the
news that Joseph E. Hill, 76, of Mineola, N.Y., had given money to
his campaign. He said he too would send the money back.
   Between 1982 and 1988 Hill contributed over $25,000 to political
campaigns at the direction of his consulting client, Unisys Corp., a
giant computer company that does work for the Defense Department,
prosecutors said. Federal election law says individuals may give
$1,000 in general and primary campaigns, but corporations are
prohibited from donating money.
   Hill and Robert D. Barrett, a former Unisys executive, entered
guilty pleas to a variety of charges in U.S. District Court in the
latest development in the Pentagon investigation.
   Also pleading guilty before U.S. District Judge Claude A. Hilton
was Jack Sherman, a civilian purchasing official with the Marine
Corps. Sherman, 52, admitted he accepted bribes in exchange for
providing confidential information on pending contracts to
consultants and companies. He could face up to 20 years in prison
and a fine of as much as $500,000.
   Hill pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of making
political contributions in the name of another, namely his client.
He could face up to four years in prison and a fine of $400,000.
   Prosecutors said Hill was paid by Sperry, which later merged into
Unisys, and was ``asked by representatives of Sperry-Unisys to make
numerous contributions in his name.''
   Besides the campaigns of Sasser and Ray, Hill also contributed in
1987 and 1988 to the campaigns of Reps. Roy Dyson, D-Md., and
William Dickinson, R-Ala., prosecutors said.
   ``It angers me that someone would give my campaign illegal
money,'' Ray said. Ray, Sasser and Dyson said they knew nothing
about the source of the money when it was given. Dickinson's
spokesman, Mike Lewis, said his boss was also in the dark about the
contribution.
   Barrett, 55, pleaded guilty Friday to conspiracy to defraud the
United States and to aiding and abetting in making false statements
to the government. He could face up to 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine.
   Barrett, who first worked for Unisys' predecessor, Sperry Corp.,
in the Washington suburbs, was involved in a complicated scheme in
which $2,000 was funneled to the election campaign of former Rep.
Bill Chappell, D-Fla., prosecutors said.
   Chappell chaired the House defense appropriations subcommittee
until his defeat last November.
   Prosecutors said the contractor paid consultants with the
understanding that they would contribute an unspecified portion of
the funds to political campaigns. In December 1986, Barrett
collected two undated checks of $1,000 each from two men and steered
them to the ``Bill Chappell Campaign Committee.'' Chappell
repeatedly denied any wrongdoing while he was in Congress.
   Friday's pleas are part of the federal government's two-year-old
investigation into the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year procurement
practices. The case includes allegations that private consultants,
hired by defense contractors, bribed Pentagon officials to obtain
inside information that gave companies an edge in securing contracts.

<HEAD>Swift Action Needed on Insurance Fund, Congressmen Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are urging President Bush
to reassure savings and loan depositors by swiftly developing a plan
to pump more money into the ailing government insurance fund for
S&amp;Ls.
   ``Public confidence is so precarious today that it is imperative
that a comprehensive approach be presented soon,'' said Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa, the second-ranking Republican on the House Banking
Committee.
   ``The exact nature is not as important as the fact that a serious
package be presented,'' he said.
   Bush sought Friday to stem nervousness following scattered
reports that some S&amp;L depositors withdrew their money after learning
that the administration is considering a 25-cent fee on every $100
in federally insured accounts.
   ``The savings and loan deposits are backed by the full faith and
credit of the government and they are sound, they are good,'' Bush
told reporters at the White House. ``I want to assure the American
people of that and that's not going to change.''
   However, Bush said he has made no decisions on a plan for the S&amp;L
problem and would not rule out the deposit insurance fee.
   ``There seems to be some controversy around it, but that doesn't
mean that any thinking along those lines should cease,'' the
president said.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said in a statement that the Bush administration's
disarray on the S&amp;L crisis is contributing to a growing nervousness
among depositors.
   ``Savings and loans are receiving a heavy run of calls from
depositors who are confused and concerned about the reports of a new
tax on their deposits,'' Gonzalez said. ``In some areas there have
been higher than expected withdrawals of funds.''
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
disputed Gonzalez' assertion, saying it was based on ``an inartful
distillation of calls made by somebody on the (committee) staff.''
However, in an interview a day before, Wall said: ``There have been
cases where they (depositors) say, `I don't like what I heard on TV,
I'm taking my money out.'''
   Bank board spokesman Karl Hoyle said a survey of thrift
institutions Thursday night showed ``no outflows of any significance
that we can attribute to anything that's been said.''
   Gonzalez accused the administration of being ``extremely
careless'' in floating the deposit fee trial balloon and called on
Bush to ``take a personal hand in clarifying the administration's
proposal.''
   The Treasury Department has been studying the S&amp;L problem since
the fall and is expected to present Bush with its recommendations
next week. Department officials have been briefing members of
Congress on some of the options under consideration, in addition to
a deposit fee.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a senior member of the banking
committee, said Treasury is talking about borrowing about $45
billion, roughly the amount needed over and above the $38 billion
committed last year, and is examining the full range of options of
how to pay it off.
   The laundry list includes using interest on Federal Reserve funds
that is now paid into the general fund, or tapping the retained
earnings of the industry-owned regional Federal Home Loan Banks.
   Options in the reform package that will accompany any new money
include an administrative merger of the fund that insures commercial
banks with the S&amp;L fund, as well as additional control by federal
regulators over risky activities undertaken by state-chartered S&amp;Ls,
Parris said.

<HEAD>Study: Above Average Air Fare Increases at Hub Airports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air fares since 1985 generally have increased
much faster than average at airports largely controlled by single
airlines, according to a new government study of those hub
operations.
   ``The present situation at hub airports is intolerable,'' Sen.
John Danforth, R-Mo., said Friday in releasing the study prepared by
the Transportation Department.
   He blamed the increases on a lack of competition at some airports
in the wake of deregulation of the airline industry in the 1970s.
   Under deregulation, most airlines have adopted ``hub and spoke''
operations to help lower their costs. The concept involves having
flights from smaller airports feed into a central airport, or hub,
where passengers make connections for their ultimate destinations.
   The study found that air fares rose substantially above national
averages from 1985 to 1988 at more than a half-dozen hub airports
dominated by single airlines: St. Louis; Charlotte, N.C.;
Cincinnati; Detroit; Minneapolis; Raleigh, N.C.; and Salt Lake City.
   The increases, in most instances, were twice or nearly three
times greater than the air fare portion of the Consumer Price Index
during the same period. The study looked at average round-trip
ticket prices for passengers beginning or ending their flights at
the hubs.
   Fares rose an average of 11.1 percent across the nation from 1985
to 1988, the study said. It said fares for the biggest carriers at
two major airports either rose less than the national average or
dropped over the three-year period.
   From 1985 to 1988, according to the study:
   _Piedmont Airlines fares rose 34 percent over three years at
Charlotte, where the airline had 89 percent of the market last year.
   _Delta Air Lines fares rose 25 percent at Cincinnati, where the
company had 81 percent of the market.
   _Northwest Airlines fares rose 27 percent at Detroit, where the
airline had 62 percent of the market.
   _Northwest fares rose 21 percent at Minneapolis, where the
airline had 77 percent of the market.
   _American Airlines fares rose 35 percent at Raleigh, where the
airline had 67 percent of the market.
   _Delta fares rose 26 percent at Salt Lake City. The airline had
77 percent of the market.
   _Delta fares rose 5 percent at Atlanta, where the airline
controls 62 percent of the market.
   _USAir fares dropped 6 percent at Pittsburgh, where the airline
had 80 percent of the market.
   The study focused, however, on Lambert-St. Louis International
Airport and the effects of a 1986 merger that made Trans World
Airlines the dominant carrier of passengers in and out of the city.
   Don Morrison, a TWA spokesman in St. Louis, disagreed with
Danforth's reading of the report. He said the study did not link the
increases to the airline's control of the market at its St. Louis
hub.
   The DOT study found that TWA fares at Lambert for non-stop
roundtrip travel increased 22.7 percent from the first half of 1985
to the first half of 1988. The airline component of the CPI rose
11.1 percent during the same period.
   ``I don't there is any correlation between the fare increases and
the hub operation,'' said Morrison. He attributed the increases to
``market forces.''
   The report did not examine in detail the other airports. It cited
the fares at other concentrated hubs only to show that TWA's air
fares had not increased faster than comparable airports across the
nation.
   However, the study cautioned, ``Hub concentration alone does not
explain why fares change or how much they change.''

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Friday.
   Bush: Harmony and peace in here. (Laughter.)
   First, I sound worse than I feel.
   But let me _
   Q. What's wrong with you?
   A. A slight cold.
   But it's been a full week since inauguration.
   I just wanted to stop by, under our new policy, give you an
update.
   I've been talking this week about ethics, and the emphasis is
not, believe me, a fad or some passing fancy.
   We're going to be hearing more about it, I think a lot more.
   In broader terms, I'm trying to set high standards for government
service _ duty, honor, personal sacrifice for the common good.
   And I want to assemble a government that the people of this
nation can be proud of, that's our goal, that's our mission.
   We did appoint this week, as you know, a new commission on ethics.
   We've got two able chairman, vice chairman _ Judge (Malcolm)
Wilkey and General Griffin Bell.
   We appointed that commission, started a fresh, constructive
dialogue with Congress on both sides of the aisle.
   I'm pleased with the way those initial meetings have gone, and so
we're ready to roll.
   I think it's been officially announced that we're going to _
certainly to Tokyo, then on to China, which I'm looking forward to
very much.
   And then also we'll be stopping for a relatively brief stop in
Korea on the way back from China.
   We've had other invitations.
   That's about all we can do.
   And on a nostalgic basis, needless to say, we're _ Barbara and I
are looking forward in a very personal way to going back to Beijing.
   Now with no further ado, I'll be glad to take your questions.
   Terry?

<HEAD>WASHN: questions. Terry?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. President, you said, before you became president, that you
supported Ronald Reagan's decision on a 50 percent pay raise for
members of Congress, and that you might have something more to say
about it once you got to the Oval Office. Most of the polls show
that the vast majority of Americans oppose that pay raise. Now
you're president. What's your view on that pay increase?
   A. Well, I did say I supportd it, and I do support it.
   A raise is overdue; there's no question about that.
   There are some good things in this.
   The reform of the honorarium, payments for these speeches, I
think is very, very good.
   I think it's good government.
   It's a complicated formulation.
   There are some elements that bother people, including me.
   But the president did consider all this carefully.
   He went forward with the commission's recommendation.
   And that, because of the way it works in Congress, and the ball
is clearly in their court, it leaves us with either the commission
recommendation or nothing.
   And so seeing the problems as I do, I still feel that I should
not go about undoing the Reagan decision.
   Yeah, Helen?
   Q. Mr. President, your trial balloon on the S&amp;Ls taxing savings
and checking accounts has fallen like a lead balloon. Are you
dropping that plan? Do you have any other plans in the works?
   A. In the first place, I think it'sa little absurd to be
commenting on a facet, a possible facet, of solving a problem, when
it hasn't even come to me.
   You're talking about speculating on something that hasn't even
reached the desk of the president, even as an option, to say nothing
of its being a proposal.
   And so _
   Q. _ come from your people.
   A. Well, as an option, not as a proposal.
   And I think you're right, there seems to be some controversy
around it.

<TEXT>
   But that doesn't mean that any thinking along those lines should
cease.
   But, I'm going to reserve comment until I actually have it
presented to me.
   And I expect this is the first of many such things that's going
to happen of this nature.
   I will say this, that the savings and loans' deposits are backed
by the full faith and credit of the government.
   And they are sound.
   They are good _ dollar good.
   And I just want to assure the American people of that.
   And nothing is going to change in that regard.
   But, in terms of this one idea, let them float it around.
   It doesn't bother me for a lot of ideas to be considered and
debated.
   Q. The reaction is very negative; the public reaction and
congressional reaction. Will that enter into your decision?
   A. Anything I do on savings and loans or when we get into this
budget deficit reduction program _ look, I don't expect it's all
going to be sweetness and harmony and light.
   The minute we get those proposals up there on Feb. 9, I expect
we're going to have other firestorms swirling around.
   But, I have not made decisions on this one.
   I'll wait till I get all the facts, call them as I see them, and
hope that we can convince the American people that that's the way to
go.
   Yes, Brit?
   Q. Mr. President, you've set a tone of high-mindedness and
propriety this week with your emphasis on ethics, also
bipartisanship in your discussions with Congress. Beyond those
matters of process and tone, sir, what would you like the country
and the world to say is the message of your first week in office as
to what your administration is about?
   A. Reaching out to the Congress.
   I really am serious about this trying to get more of a bipartisan
foreign policy, for example.
   And though we haven't addressed that specifically in terms of
issues, I have addressed it in broad terms to the members of
Congress with whom I've met here and with whom I've met over in the
residence.
   And, so, I'd like to signal an era of real openness with Congress.
   Look, I know we're going to have conflicts, Brit, and I know
we're going to run up against each other.
   But, I want to start with that approach, and we're going to _
we're in a broad review, as you've heard from my various nominees as
they appear before the Senate, on specific areas of foreign policy.
   But a message would be taking steps to make clear to the
congressional leadership that that's what I want to do.
   The other one, as I mentioned, is trying to set a tone in terms
of conflict of interest that I hope will serve us in good stead.

   Q. Mr. President, there seems to be some question about just how
long your ``no tax'' pledge applies. Is that a one-year pledge, a
two-year pledge, a four-year pledge?
   A. I'd like it to be a four-year pledge.
   And _
   Q. Is it a four-year pledge?
   A. I'd like it to be a four-year pledge, yeah.
   Q. Mr. President, Yasser Arafat's been over in Europe meeting
with the foreign ministers of Spain, France, and Greece. Marlin has
said, and so has Brent Scowcroft, that it's too early for Arafat to
meet with Jim Baker. On what level would it be appropriate for
Arafat to meet with an American official? An assistant secretary of
state, for example?
   A. We changed the policy on the Middle East, on dealing with the
_ I mean, as change came about in the policy on communicating with
the PLO, it was based on their acceptance of three principles.
   As long as they stay hooked and stay committed to those three
principles, we will have, when appropriate, meetings with the PLO.
   I haven't given any thought at all to what _ what _ when a
meeting with the _ Chairman Arafat with an American official, is
appropriate.
   And I would wait to see how we go forward.
   The point in talking to them is to try to facilitate peace in the
Middle East.
   And it seems to me that if there's some logical step that
requires high-level sign-off by various participants over there,
then, and then only, would it be proper to elevate the meetings to
that level.
   We're just starting.
   You crawl before you walk.
   We're just starting to talk to them, because they have _
dramatically, I'd say _ agreed to the _ to the principles that are
part of our policy.
   Q. Let me ask you again in that regard. You said in a wire
service interview the other day that you needed to have some foreign
policy initiative early in your administration. It seems the Soviet
relationship is going on the back burner while you discuss the
nuclear force structure, for example. In what area are you going to
try to move forward? Central America? The Mideast? Where?
   A. All of them.
   But we've got to have a little time.
   We're not going to let this Soviet thing put us in a mood of _
mode of foot-draggers.
   We're going to be out front.
   There's no reason to suggest that all we have to do is react to a
speech by the general secretary.
   I want to take the offense in moving this relationship forward
and doing _ taking steps that are in the interest of the free _
freedom around the world, whether it's in Eastern Europe, or in
strengthening our alliance.
   But there's plenty of trouble spots.
   One of them, as you mentioned, I think _ Central America _ but we
need to complete the reviews.
   But I can't tell you, John, which one will become _ where you
will see the first major initiative, whether it's going to be the
Middle East, whether it's going to be Central America.
   We've got problems, of course, that afflict the whole continent
and other continents in this Third World debt problem; and then, of
course, the Soviet Union.
   But, no, I don't want to play defense, and I don't want to look
like we're foot-dragging, just waiting around to _ to, you know, let
others set the agenda.
   But, prudence is the order of the day.
   And when you're gunning for something as important as a
bilaterally supported policy in Central America, it does take a
little time.
   I've only been here less than a week.
   Yes?

   Q. As you know, the minimum wage has been frozen for even longer
than congressional pay raises. Since you support a large increase in
pay for the most affluent 1 percent of the country, will you favor
pushing for an increase in the minimum wage, which would benefit the
lowest income groups in the country, as part of your promise in your
inaugural address to reach out to all the people?
   A. I would _ I've always said that my position on minimum wage is
that I would want it linked to a training wage, to a differential of
sorts, so that you don't throw people out of work by raising the
minimum wage.
   And I'm not one who has felt that the minimum wage is the key to
economic prosperity for the lowest _ people on the lowest end of the
economic spectrum.
   But, as I indicated _ a certain flexibility on that question.
   And again, I'll wait for Elizabeth Dole, who takes office in the
next couple of days, to come in with her recommendations.
   Saul?
   Q. If I could just follow. Do you _ are you _
   A. How are we going to _ wait, let me ask you to stop the
proceedings _ don't take it out of their time.
   How are _ what would be the fair and noble way to handle
follow-up questions as we do these things?
   Would it be good to have them or not have them?
   Q. There should be two follow-ups.
   Q. Yes. One follow-up.
   Q. There should be one follow-up.
   Q. There should be two follow-ups.
   A. But then you've cut out _ but then if we do it, everybody else
doesn't get a chance to ask their question, becuase I'm about to
pull a rip cord on this thing. (Laughter.)
   No seriously, how do we _ I want some advice _
   Q. Come back every day! (Laughter.)
   Q. _ if you make a statement and not have anyone follow it up _
it just hangs out there.
   Q. Suppose you don't answer _
   A. You mean my first answer is less than precise _ (Laughter).
   Q. On occasion.
   A. On occasion _ (laughs).
   No, but I'm asking, we've got to get _ I'd like to get _ because
here we are, all of these _
   Q. _ to follow up _
   A. _ women and men who have to let that the Leubsdorf area
untested on the question.
   Q. One follow-up.
   Q. The standees.
   Q. We'll just have to be more precise.
   A. And the standees have gotten no time at all.
   Q. _ a true follow-up.
   A. Instead of yet another question, you mean.
   Q. You decide. When you think somebody's playing games with you,
say, ``I'm sorry.''
   A. I'll just say I've already answered that.
   Then what happens? (Laughter.)
   Saul?
   Q. Wait a minute _ where's my follow-up?
   A. (Laughs.) You didn't have a follow-up.
   Q. _ gets a follow-up then.
   A. All right.
   I've already answered that one.
   Yes, Saul? (Laughter.)
   No. Go ahead _ (laughter) _ go ahead.

   A. OK.
   Q. Are you concerned, from the standpoint of perception, that
you're supporting a pay raise for a high-income group and not
pushing on an equal basis for a lower-income group will give the
public's perception that you're lobbying for a wealthy sector of the
country?
   A. No, I'm not concerned about that perception because _ but I am
troubled by certain aspects of the proposal, as I think I've
indicated _ the pay raise proposal.
   But, we're down to the crunch here.
   The recommendation's up there on the hill _ it's either yea or
nay.
   I mean, it's one way or another.
   But, I don't think that would be fair at all.
   I think the main thing in terms of the question you raised _ jobs.
   How do we continue to create jobs, keep it going?
   And I've given you one ingredient that I think has to be a part
of the _ of any consideration of the minimum wage, but as I've
indicated, I'm flexible on how that should be accomplished.
   But, I'm not sure that one could make a connection between the
minimum wage and more employment.
   I think you can _ if you raise the minimum wage without this
difference, so I think you will reduce employment.
   So, I think the main thing in the area you're talking about is,
how do we increase economic opportunity?
   And maybe there is a way to do it, but I don't think it would be
fair to say, when you take a pay raise that affects a tiny fraction
_ judges and congressmen _ that that has a broad economic impact on
the country.
   I've expressed some concern about it, but for other reasons.
   Yes?
   Q. Do you agree with Senator Tower's testimony, in which he
doesn't seem to believe that the SDI program as envisioned by
President Reagan is likely? And if you do agree with it, can you
expand on that, please?
   A. No. I think I should wait and see a little more what John
Tower means.
   My position has not chaned on SDI.
   Q. Which is? John Tower said that he doesn't believe that a
large-scale SDI would protect the population as envisioned by Reagan
_
   A. I better _ yes?
   Q. Do you disagree with that?
   A. Saul, before I comment on Tower's testimony, I better read it.
   If he's talking about a shield so impenetrable that you have no _
that that eliminates the need for any kind of other defense, I
probably would agree with that, certainly short-run.
   But I better cover by waiting until I see what he said.
   The standees _ two standees alone.
   Q. Thank you. The first action taken by your secretary of state
was to order the boarding up of embassy in Kabul. Does that indicate
that this administration and this country then has no influence with
the rebels, and you are now fearful of chaos and massacres there?
And to what extent did you discuss this with Gorbachev the other day?
   A. I did not discuss it with him the other day.
   And what it indicates is a prudent policy to protect a handful of
American life.
   And it's a step that other countries have taken in Afghanistan.
   There is _ certainly I think we'd all agree _ there is
uncertainty about what follows.
   I'm convinced the Soviets will continue their withdrawal, and
well they should.
   But it is simply a prudent way in which to protect life.
   I think we've had meeting after meeting with Afghan rebels, and
there's no question in their mind how we feel about, say, a Soviet
presence in that country.
   But I think there's a lot of uncertainty, and there's enough
uncertainty that a secretary of state was taking prudent action in
this regard.

withdraw, in that country?

   Q. Mr. President, I'd like to try the pay raise one last time. As
you just said, it's not just for members of Congress and it's not
just for federal judges. It's for a lot of senior officials in the
government, political appointees. You also have told some reporters
in recent days that you're concerned about the long-term pension
implications of all these larger salaries. Wouldn't you be happier
with a pay raise that's a little bit less rich than 50 percent?
   A. I don't have that option to get into that now.
   I have, I think, expressed myself in the past on separating out
some of these categories.
   But we're not _ regrettably, you're never dealing with just the
way I would like it to be.
   And so I'll just leave it that what _ my earlier statement.
   Q. Sir, this is a thematic question. You've had a week on the
job. Has it been easier or tougher than you expected? Any surprises?
And did you find the note in your underwear?
   A. No note in the underwear.
   And it's been a good, easy week, and I expect it will change
dramatically in the days ahead.
   But my view is to _ if it weren't for the cold _ ``Smile and
enjoy it while you can,'' because I can already sense, you know,
looking forward to a little more _ a little more confrontation out
there.
   Q. Have there been any surprises, sir?
   A. None particularly, no.
   It _ it _ and I think one of the reasons is that I've been around
here in a different role for eight years, and then in and out on
other jobs.
   So it's _ but there's the, still the wonder of it all.
   I mean, it still feels different, but not surprises.
   Q. A follow-up, sir!
   A. You've already a follow-up!
   Nice try.
   Rita? (Laughter).
   Q. Mr. President, there seems to be some brouhaha about the fact
that Bill Bennett's not an actual member of the Cabinet, as are the
U.S.T.R. and the OMB directors. In light of the fact that you
emphasized drugs as an overriding consideration in your campaign,
and also that public opinion polls show consistently this is among
the top priorities of the public, why isn't he in the Cabinet? And
do you foresee that you might change your mind on that?
   A. No. The reason he isn't in the Cabinet is that I've tried to
reduce down the numbers of full Cabinet members.
   And I think that Bill Bennett's time is best spent not worrying
about agricultural subsidies, but _ when we have a meeting on
agriculture _ but concentrating on drugs.
   To the degree there's symbolism that this means I think it's less
important, I'd like to knock that down hard.
   And I have to do that in substantive ways, sitting at his side as
we meet with his peers at Cabinet level, making clear to them that I
will be insisting on cooperation as he asks for the support of the
defense secretary for military assets on interdiction; as he asks
for the support of the education secretary on certain educational
initiatives.
   But the Cabinet rank is there, giving him the standing that I
think the job not only requires, but demands, and I think his _ I
think the idea of not sitting through Cabinet meetings that have
nothing to do with that subject should be the reason that _ a
rationale for having Cabinet-level but not being in all those
meetings.
   I've seen _ I'm glad he mentioned this, because I think there's
been some feeling, ``Well, that means I'm less interested in drugs.''
   That's not right.
   I'm not _ I'm very interested in the economic statistics, but our
chief of economic advisers is not a Cabinet member, as he has been
designated by previous presidents.
   Our chief of staff, in whom I have full confidence, is not a
Cabinet member, but I think we have a very strong chief of staff
set-up.
   Over here, way up in the window _ an innovative stance.

<TEXT>
   Q. I wonder if I could just touch on the issue of Third World
debt. There are many experts who are saying that, if there is any
danger for the U.S. economy, it's in how greatly leveraged it is
opposed to terms of corporate indebtedness and Third World debt. And
they say that the S&amp;L crisis, for example, is simply a subsumed
feature of this. Do you see this as a real problem that you're going
to address aggressively? And what kind of steps would you take to
overcome the high proportionality of debt to equity that exists in
the economy now?
   A. The question of corporate debt _ the role _ on that one, the
role of th White House and the role of the federal government ought
to be to do its level best to keep a strong economy.
   And I don't believe that it's the government role to assign
levels beyond which a corporation can't borrow.
   In terms of Third World debt, we do have a responsibility, and a
lot of that's going to be working with the private banks and others,
and, again, that's going to be _ we'll have some recommendations.
   We have to have them pretty soon on that question.
   That _ I'm not sure I got to the substance of your question there.
   But I don't _ separating out those two things.
   Q. _ in the reported differences that you have with Alan
Greenspan's testimony in Congress earlier this week with regard to
interest rates and monetary policy?
   A. I'll be honest with you.
   I don't think I'm far apart from Chairman Greenspan at all _ far
apart.
   There may be some differences.
   He is, because of the plant capacity utilization, he is more
concerned about inflationary pressures than I am right now.
   Seems to me there's an area of difference.
   But basically and generally speaking, I think we're in _ we're
fairly close together.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, by spending your first week dwelling as you
have on ethics, aren't you voicing an implicit criticism of the
Reagan administration's record _ ethical record?
   A. No.
   Q. Then why else was it necessary to declare ``national ethics
week,'' so to speak?
   A. Because I feel strongly about it.
   Q. On that _ also on that line, sir?
   A. No, she's first and then you.
   Need to cool off on that one. (Laughter.)
   Q. Mr. President, during _ given your strong anti-tax stand in
the campaign, why are you allowing Mr. Brady to consider as an
option for the S&amp;Ls a tax increase?
   A. I'm not _ he has thrown out a lot of different possibilities
in discussions we've had.
   We have people that are experts on what a tax is.
   I would refer you to Richard Darman, who is the head of the OMB.
   And he's the guy that defined that very well up there, with the
``duck test'' on the hill.
   And _
   Q. So you don't think it's a tax?
   A. Well, I'm just saying I'm not prepared to say what I think on
it right now till I hear from it, because the more I discuss it, the
more you all go out and say this is something that I'm considering,
when I'm not.
   It hasn't come to me yet.
   But I've been around for a long time, and I don't remember
hearing people talk about the fee that went into covering the FDIC
or FSLIC as a tax.
   I don't remember people writing that before.
   But, I'm not trying to get into the fight anymore right now.
   I'll be back _ yes, Charles?
   Q. You've mentioned ethics in a number of ways, and you've talked
about the value of service. The last few days, we picked up the
headlines in the papers, and they've read, ``The president has _
President Reagan _ has a $5 million book deal. He's got a
$50,000-a-speech deal.'' With all respect for the office and the
former president, do you think it's appropriate to cash in on the
presidency?
   A. I don't know whether I'd call it ``cashing in.''
   I expect every president has written his memoirs and received
money for it.
   Indeed, I read that a former president _ was it Grant? Grant got
half a million bucks _ that's when half a million really meant
something.
   I mean, you know _ so I think there's plenty of tradition that
goes with presidents writing memoirs and being paid for it.

   Q. But, you've also talked about perceptions. Is there a
perception problem here?
   A. No, because I think there's been a long history of that.
   And, I don't think it's ever been challenged as inappropriate.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, would you try to clear up the continuing
controversy over the reports of disagreements on abortion between
your nominee for health and human services and yourself that _ are
you in sync? Is he in sync _
   A. Yes.
   Q. _ with you? Does it matter? Do you have to be absolutely in
sync as long as, once in office, he would support your position?
   A. Well, I think that last point is the important point.
   But, also, we are in sync.
   And, so, I have a person who has stood in front of you all when I
nominated him and said that.
   And I have no reason to think anything different.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, a few moments ago, you talked about, on your
no-new-taxes pledge, the idea that you'd like it to be a four-year
pledge. And that does appear to be a softening of language from the
campaign. I wonder, has anything that Mr. Darman or any of your
advisers told you changed your mind about the duration of that
pledge _ revenues needed and so on?
   A. No. That hasn't changed my mind _ anything in the last few
days of talking like that.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, we've been hearing a lot about your position on
abortion this week because of Mr. Sullivan. Are you planning any
initiatives from the White House related to abortion? Or are you
going to wait and see what the Supreme Court does, number one? And,
number two, as a person who's always, from what we know, had the
financial and emotional resources to know that you could raise your
children comfortably, do you feel any awkwardness about telling
other people, whose situations you don't know, how they should run
their lives?
   A. Not when it comes to the question of life.
   I do feel an awkwardness in terms of having been able to take
care of my kids when they were sick or raise them properly or
something like that; I feel a certain privilege.
   I feel a certain _ very fortunate in that regard.
   And I know a lot of people aren't.
   But, in some _ on this issue, I think we're talking here of
principle and I sure would like to put the emphasis on adoption.
   And that means a broader acceptance of that principle.
   Q. Are you going to have any White House initiatives or are you
going to wait for the Supreme Court?
   A. Oh, wait for _ I think probably wait, but I have been pledged,
as you know, to an amendment.
   But, I'd like to see the Supreme Court decision as soon as
possible.
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. One, two, three _
   Q. Mr. President, a Tehran radio report this morning seems to
indicate that they are rejecting your statement of a week ago today
that good will would beget good will. While you didn't specifically
mention Iran by name in your speech, what would your message to them
be on relations, and what would your message be to them about
helping get the hostages out?
   A. Well, I would make a broad appeal, transcending Iran, to
anybody that can be helpful to get the hostages out.
   Perhaps _ I haven't seen the wire copy, but perhaps they are _ if
there is such a story by them, maybe they're saying, ``Look, we're
not holding your hostages.''
   And I'd have to say, ``Well, from our intelligence, our
information, that's probably correct _ probably correct.''
   In terms of the future, there was a period of time when we had
excellent relations with Iran.
   And I don't want to _ want to think that the status quo has to go
on forever.
   But I do think that the renunciation of terror in any form, and a
facilitating to the degree they can the release of the hostages,
would be a couple of good steps they could take.

   Q. May I follow up, Mr. President? Follow up on that?
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. No, you don't get to follow his question! (Laughter.)
   Anne _ and then here.
   Q. Mr. President, reaching out _
   Q. You've _ you've spoken frequently about reaching out to
blacks, that you want that to be an important goal of your
administration. This week, the Supreme Court issued a decision that
may kill many of the minority set-aside programs that have been so
helpful to blacks across this country. Does that concern you? Are
you worried about these programs?
   A. I _ it didn't kill all set-asides, and it didn't kill off
affirmative action.
   I have been committed to affirmative action.
   I want to see a reinvigorated Office of Minority Business and
Commerce.
   I want to see our SBA program go forward vigorously.
   And so, I would say that that decision spoke to one set of facts,
in Richmond I believe it was.
   And _ but don't read in _ I will not read into that a mandate, to
me, to stop trying on _ on equal _ equal employment, and on
affirmative action generally.
   Yes?
   Q. You said during the campaign, Mr. President, that you would
roll back taxes on capital gains if elected. Now, as you begin to
look at the budget numbers, is that going to be a promise you can
keep when you make your submission to Congress, or is that no longer
affordable?
   A. I hope it _ affordable!
   It gains you revenue.
   And we've got a big argument with some people about that, they
don't want to go back and look at what happened in 1978 _ it gains
revenue.
   Now I know we've got all kinds of bureaucracies around here that
don't agree with that.
   But that was discussed in the campaign.
   I'm convinced it will bring in additional revenue and, in the
process, create additional jobs for men and women.
   So I would like to see it a fundamental part of whatever we do.
   Now, if your question is: can I get it done? _ that's something
else again.
   But I want to see it done.
   We _ there was an issue in that campaign where there was a clear
difference; that was one where there was a clear difference.
   The opposition was saying: My opponent is proposing something
that will cost the taxpayer $30 billion.
   And I'm saying it will create jobs.
   And, indeed, I've seen estimates by intelligent people thinking
it will bring in revenues in excess of $4 billion.
   And so I'm going to keep pushing that because I know it's right,
and I ran on it.
   Yeah, Robby?
   Q. Mr. President, once more on the pay raise. You've portrayed
yourself as a late-comer on the issue who has no real power to
affect it. But, a point of fact, I believe that you do have the
power, if you want to, to limit the pay raises that would otherwise
automatically go to your own staff. Will you do that, number one;
and number two, do you think both houses of Congress ought to vote
on it?
   A. Well, I think in a _ I think in the best of all worlds _
   Wait till I get _ wait till I _
   Q. It's a trick question, sir. (Laughter)
   A. (Laughs) He's a fair-minded guy! (Laughter.)
   No, I _ I think our _ our _ our chief of staff has tried to hold
the line on increases in hiring people.
   And I think you're all aware of that.
   And I think he's done a very good job on it.
   I don't know how the law affects the staff in terms of automatic
_ automatic increases.
   But there's a nice little problem that if you do go forward with
automatic increases, is there any money?
   That has to be appropriated in some way.
   So we'll have to talk about what we'll do.
   What was the other part of it?

   Q. Do you think both houses of Congress ought to vote on this
issue?
   A. In a _ in a _ in a perfect world, in a world where you were
starting over, yes, I'd have to say I do.
   But that isn't the proposal that's up there.
   And it's all or nothing.
   And in my view, I've told you where I come down on that.
   We've got time for a couple more because it's 38:57.89, 58.80 _
this thing is buzzing away up here. (Laughter.)
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, a few minutes ago, on the answer concerning the
hostages, you indicated that Iran was probably not holding the
hostages. Did you mean to say that we believe that Iran exercises no
control over the people who are holding the hostages?
   A. No. I mean to say, they are not holding the hostages.
   Do they have any control? We can get varying degrees of
intelligence on that, various assessments as to how much control
they have over Hezbollah or these families or whoever it is.
   And also, you've got different _ different groups involved in the
holding of these hostages.
   But, what I _ no, I'm glad to get a chance to clarify it, because
unless the information I have is wrong, Iran itself, the government,
is not actually holding these _ holding these people.
   And if they were, you know, I would just reiterate my view that
the way to improve relations is to let them go, give these people
their freedom _ they didn't do anything wrong.
   Q. And a follow-up, Mr. President. Do we believe that Iran can
exercise influence to gain the hostages' release?
   A. I think they can have influence.
   Yes, Jerry?
   Q. You inherited a budget from President Reagan that calls for
something like a 2 percent real increase in defense spending. In the
campaign, you seemed to think that maybe zero real growth in defense
spending would be adequate. Given the deficit pressures, do you
think there is some room for reduction in the Reagan defense budget
to fund some of the other programs, like the S&amp;L problem that you've
got to worry about?
   A. We are wrestling with that problem right now.
   I'm committed to a strong defense.
   I did say certain things in the campaign that fit into our
flexible freeze concept.
   And so, we will _ I will have to address that with some detail on
Feb. 9, and I will.
   We have time for just a couple of more.
   Q. Mr. President, in the back _
   A. This is 36 minutes here.
   Q. Mr. President, you said the other day that _
   Q. Just say ``no.''
   Q. _ education was the main way for dealing with drugs.
   A. Yes.
   Q. Isn't that a backing away from your commitment on drugs?
Certainly, there are other things than education to deal with the
problem.
   A. Absolutely.
   And I was surprised when I read that some interpreted what I said
as _ for suggesting that interdiction is not important, or
cooperation with foreign governments in terms of eradication at the
source is not important.
   They are very important!
   My point is, we are not going to solve the problem of drug use in
this country through interdiction alone, through cutting off the
supply alone.
   And a larger component of the solution lies in education and on _
and in that whole demand side of the equation, law enforcement at
home, these things.
   Last one, here.
   Q. (Inaudible).
   A. Look, this is a follow-up.

<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. President, how much money are you going to spend on drugs?
If it's the major problem that you say it is, certainly education
just one very small part of it?
   A. It's not a small part, it's a tremendous part.
   And the federal government can spend some on it and the private
sector has got to spend enormous amounts.
   The media has done a good job in terms of pro bono advertising.
   And that's got to be enormously stepped up.
   So it _ look, it has got to be a tremendous increase, not only on
the money, but the emphasis on the educational side.
   I do want to see _ find a way to step up the total funding on
anti-narcotics, and I want to get _ I'll go back to what I said on
Bill Bennett, because this question of Cabinet rank and whether that
shows less of an interest in narcotics troubles me.
   You will see me side by side with Bill Bennett on _ in putting
the proper emphasis from the Oval Office on my determination to do
everything in the government's power, federal government's power, to
eliminate this scourge.
   Last one! Carl?
   Q. Is there any _
   Q. Mr. President, you and your aides have talked about the need
for a fast start, and you've talked all week about ethics and about
bipartisanship. And yet, the week has been marked by unexpected
controversies over Dr. Sullivan's views on abortion and then the S&amp;L
issue, which is sort of a self-inflicted wound. Are you finding it
harder to control an agenda here than you thought you might?
   A. No, no. I'm just getting a preview of coming attractions and
it's been lovely. (Laughter.)
   And it's going to change and I know it.
   But, no, I think it's been a wonderfully harmonious week, and
these are just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm
pond.
   Q. You're not concerned that if you just talk about things that _
I mean, everyone approves of ethics, just about everyone approves of
bipartisanship, isn't there a danger of people saying that, you
know, there's not much meat behind the words?
   A. There's a danger of that, yeah, but people are _ realize that
you've been here four days of this week, or five, this is the fifth
day, in office after the weekend, and they understand that in things
like the foreign policy area, that it's prudent to have a review;
they understand that we've got to get our people in place.
   And so I _ there's some danger, I guess, Carl, but I wouldn't say
an overwhelming danger.
   I mean, we just go for it.
   If we just sat around and did nothing except be pleasant to
people on the hill or something, why, I could expect that would grow
a little old for you all.
   But, we're going to _ we're going to _ I think we did _ we've set
a certain tone and a certain outreach, and then go forward when _ as
soon as these specific proposals start up there, whether it's on
education or anti-narcotics or on foreign policy or on some
bilateral foreign visitor coming in, there will be plenty of _
plenty of time for controversy and plenty of time for lively debate
on substance.
   But I would simply say that will follow and follow pretty soon.
   Thank you all very much.
   The press: Thank you.

   Here at a glance are highlights from President
Bush's first formal news conference Friday:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>S&amp;L PROBLEMS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush said he was not disturbed by the flap in response to reports
that he was considering a fee that would be charged to S&amp;L
depositors to raise money for government efforts to deal with failed
institutions. ``It doesn't bother me for a lot of ideas to be
considered and debated. ... I have not made decisions on this one.
I'll wait till I get all the facts, call them as I see them, and
hope that we can convince the American people that that's the way to
go.'' He added: ``I will say this, that the savings and loans'
deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the government.
And they are sound. They are good _ dollar good. And I just want to
assure the American people of that. And nothing is going to change
in that regard.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush said of the Reagan-proposed $45,000 pay raise for judges,
members of Congress and other high-ranking government officials: ``I
do support it. A raise is overdue, there's no question about that.''
He added, ``I am troubled by certain aspects of the proposal ... but
we're down to the crunch here. The recommendation's up there on the
Hill _ it's either yea or nay. ... Seeing the problems as I do, I
still feel I should not go about undoing the Reagan decision.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>TRIP TO CHINA</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Asked about visiting China before responding to Soviet Leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's request for an early meeting, Bush replied: ``I
don't know what signal it sends in that regard, but let me just
remind you that I'm the one who does not believe in, quote, `playing
the Soviet card' or, quote, `playing the China card.' ... It just
seemed like an appropriate visit, but not to signal a playing of the
card to go one up on Mr. Gorbachev. There's nothing of that nature
in this visit. ... The visit stands on its own and does not have any
signaling that should be detrimental to anybody else's interest.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MINIMUM WAGE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush reiterated his position that any increase in the minimum
wage should be ``linked to a training wage, to a differential of
sorts, so that you don't throw people out of work by raising the
minimum wage. And I'm not one who has felt that the minimum wage is
the key to economic prosperity for the lowest _ people on the lowest
end of the economic spectrum. But, as I indicated, a certain
flexibility on that question. And again, I'll wait for (Labor
Secretary) Elizabeth Dole, who takes office in the next couple of
days, to come in with her recommendations.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>THE PLO</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush said meetings would be held with the PLO ``as long as they
stay hooked and stay committed'' to accepting Israel's right to
exist, renouncing terrorism and accepting two U.N. resolutions
affirming the right of all Middle Eastern states to live within
secure borders. ``If there's some logical step that requires
high-level sign-off by various participants over there, then, and
then only, would it be proper to elevate the meetings to that level.
We're just starting. You crawl before you walk. We're just starting
to talk to them, because they have _ dramatically, I'd say _ agreed
to the, to the principles that are part of our policy.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Might Open Cam Ranh Bay, Senator Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam is thinking of opening the sprawling
Soviet-operated military port of Cam Ranh Bay to all countries
including the United States, says a senator in contact with Hanoi
diplomats.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, also told reporters after meeting
Hanoi's U.N. ambassador that the envoy was ``very positive'' about
the idea of establishing an unofficial American presence in Vietnam
for humanitarian purposes, primarily help for Amerasian children
whose mothers were Vietnamese and fathers were U.S. servicemen
during the Vietnam War.
   Murkowski, who plans another in a series of visits to Vietnam in
March, talked to reporters Friday after meeting on Capitol Hill with
Vietnam's U.N. ambassador, Trinh Xuan Lang. Lang was the first Hanoi
official in Washington for official meetings since the northern half
of Vietnam became independent from France in 1954.
   ``I asked about the Soviet presence at Cam Ranh Bay,'' Murkowski
said, referring to the giant port built by the United States during
the Vietnam War and now the Soviet Union's largest overseas military
base.
   ``I was very pleased at the response that there is consideration
given to opening that port up to all the countries of the world,''
he said. ``I said sure, you'd find the United States interested in
occasionally calling in there.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last September offered to
dismantle the base at Cam Ranh Bay in exchange for the United States
giving up its key bases in the Philippines. Washington reacted
coolly and later agreed on terms with the Philippines for continued
use of its installations until 1991.
   Ambassador Lang, at a meeting with State and Defense Department
and National Security Council officials, promised that Hanoi would
continue to cooperate with U.S. efforts to account for about 1,700
American servicemen still missing in the Indochina War, the State
Department said Friday.
   The department relaxed rules restricting the U.N. envoy to the
New York City area to enable him to attend a Washington reception
and used his presence to stress U.S. concern about the POW-MIA
issue. State Department spokesman Charles Redman reiterated that
normalization of U.S. relations with Hanoi depends on complete
withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces from Cambodia.
   Lang said later he was ``very satisfied'' with his meetings,
which he said aimed ``at better understanding and reconciliation.''
   U.S.-Vietnam relations ``sooner or later'' will be normalized, he
told reporters on Capitol Hill.
   Murkowski urged U.S. efforts in the meantime to complete the
complicated finding and processing for entry to the United States of
thousands of people enduring hardship in Vietnam today because they
had American fathers or American connections during the war, and
their families.
   Murkowski said the ambassador told him Hanoi was agreeable to
allowing representatives of U.S. private voluntary organizations to
establish a ``humanitarian presence'' for such purposes in Saigon,
since renamed Ho Chi Minh City.
   The senator estimated 12,000 Amerasian children of American
fathers, now young adults, remain in Vietnam and that with family
members a total of up to 36,000 people could be involved. Estimates
of the number of Vietnamese marked as U.S. sympathizers and
subjected after the war to detention and ``re-education'' vary
widely and have run as high as 500,000.

   A federal judge has delayed the trial of
former PTL leaders Jim Bakker and Richard Dortch from February until
April to give defense lawyers more time to prepare their cases.
   Bakker and Dortch were indicted Dec. 5 on charges of mail fraud,
wire fraud and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. They are
accused of diverting more than $4 million in PTL money for their own
benefit and conspiring to defraud followers to support lavish
lifestyles.
   Earlier this month, Bakker and Dortch pleaded innocent to all
charges. Their lawyers Wednesday asked U.S. District Judge Robert
Potter for the delay.
   Federal prosecutors filed court documents Friday asking that the
government be informed if Bakker and Dortch intend to offer insanity

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The giant leatherback turtles of
Malaysia are nearing extinction, with only 40 nesting last year at
Rantau Abang on the South China Sea, down from 1,800 in the 1950s,
an official said today.
   ``In the near future, the sea turtles of Malaysia may only be
alive in pictures,'' warned Khir Johari, president of the World
Wildlife Fund's Malaysia office.
   ``This represents an incredible 98 percent decline over 30 years.
Indeed, if nothing is done to help save this magnificent creature, I
can safely predict that within the next few years, the giant
leatherback turtle will be an extinct species, at least in
Malaysia,'' he added.
   Khir said the wildlife fund of Malaysia, in cooperation with the
Trengganu state government and Fisheries Department, will launch a
``save the sea turtles'' conservation program in March that includes
a turtle sanctuary in Rantau Abang, 180 miles to the northeast.

   Actor Gary Busey ``still has a long way to
go'' in recovering from a severe head injury he suffered in a
motorcycle accident last month, his mother said.
   ``He's finally getting better, but it's been a terrible thing,''
said Ginny Busey.
   Busey, a Tulsa native, was thrown from his motorcycle and struck
his head against a curb in the Dec. 4 accident in Culver City,
Calif. He was not wearing a helmet.
   Mrs. Busey said Thursday she recently returned to her Tulsa home
after spending several weeks with her son at a private
rehabilitation center.
   Doctors have predicted that Busey, 44, will make a full recovery
from the accident, but Mrs. Busey said it will take time.
   ``A brain injury is extremely slow to heal. He still has a long
way to go,'' she said.
   Busey, who gained fame after performing the title role in the
1978 movie, ``The Buddy Holly Story,'' had spoken out against
mandatory helmet laws for adults.

   Actor Paul Newman has decided against
starring in ``Blaze,'' a movie about the romance between the late
Louisiana Gov. Earl K. Long and a New Orleans stripper.
   ``It was never an official agreement,'' Newman's spokesman Warren
Cowan said Friday. ``He had doubts about doing the movie for many
months. For whatever reasons, he's withdrawing.''
   Long and Blaze Starr had an affair in the late 1950s when Starr
was a stripper on Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Long died in 1960
at the age of 65.
   Director-writer Ron Shelton, who has not cast the part of the
stripper, now has to find a new leading man. Shelton wrote and
directed last summer's baseball hit movie, ``Bull Durham.''
   Tesa Laviolette, director of the Louisiana Film Commission, said
that Disney-Touchstone is still committed to the project and that
plans to begin filming in Louisiana in March should not be disrupted
by the cast change.

   Millionaire developer Donald Trump
may be trading in his noisy plane for a quieter model if an
organization he helped found has its way.
   The group, the Good Neighbor Council for Aircraft Noise Control,
said Thursday it will sue the county in 30 days unless it acts to
lower the volume of noise coming from Palm Beach International
Airport.
   Jets from the airport pass over posh Palm Beach and many West
Palm Beach neighborhoods at low altitudes, causing a deafening roar
that residents say makes it impossible to carry on a conversation.
   Trump's own private plane, a Boeing 727 he frequently lands at
the airport, might be banned should the proposed guidelines be
enacted. Trump has a home in Palm Beach.
   ``If that means Mr. Trump has to get a new airplane, he'll bloody
well have to get a new airplane,'' said the group's co-founder,
George Petty, a pulp and paper executive.
   Airport spokesman Jerry Allen said about 65 percent of the
aircraft using the airport are of a quieter type, such as Boeing
757s _ up from 25 percent in 1982.

   The governor said he and Snowe, both leaders of Maine's

years in our professional lives.''
   An inter-denominational ceremony is to be held Feb. 24 in
Lewiston.
   ``This seemed to be the best time possible for us, given our busy

   McKernan and Snowe served together in the U.S. House of
Representatives from 1983 to 1986 and in the Maine House of
Representatives during the 1970s, and have dated for several years.
   McKernan, 40, took office as chief executive in January 1987,
becoming Maine's first Republican governor in two decades, after two
terms in Congress.
   McKernan is divorced and the father of a teen-age son.
   Snowe, 41, entered the U.S. House in 1979 and was elected last

   Two aging Nazi war criminals
pardoned by the Dutch parliament arrived in West Germany after
spending 43 years in prison for sending thousands of Dutch Jews to
death camps, among them possibly Anne Frank.
   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker praised the Dutch
decision Friday to pardon the two war criminals, calling it a
humanitarian act. A government spokesman said the men would be
allowed to settle in West Germany.
   The Dutch decision to pardon and expel Franz Fischer, 87, and
Ferdinand aus der Fuenten, 79, ended two days of emotional debate.
Opponents of the pardon said the men should have remained in jail
the rest of their lives.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, head of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal
Center, wrote in a letter to Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers, ``It is
unconscionable to release such notorious individuals who perpetrated
heinous crimes and caused suffering to so many thousands.''
   Avraham Soetendorp, a prominent Dutch rabbi, added, ``We saw this
coming, but still it hit us very hard.''
   Fischer headed a local branch of the Nazi Security Service and
was held responsible for deporting 13,000 Jews to death camps. Aus
der Fuenten was an SS administrator who oversaw mass roundups of
Jews in the Netherlands.
   Soetendorp said aus der Fuenten ``may have been indirectly
responsible'' for sending Anne Frank to a concentration camp. The
girl and her family lived in an Amsterdam attic for two years before
they were discovered and sent to concentration camps.
   Her poignant work, ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' perhaps the most
famous personal document to come out of the Holocaust, was published
in 1947 and was turned into a play and movie. She died of pneumonia
in 1945 at age 15 in Germany's Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.
   A brief film clip on West Germany's ARD television network showed
the two frail-looking, grey-haired men step out of an ambulance.
   ARD did not say where the two men crossed the border into West
Germany late Friday and gave no other details. West German border
police referred all questions to the federal Interior Ministry, but
ministry spokesmen could not be reached late Friday.
   Aus der Fuenten's wife, Maria, lives in an apartment in a
working-class neighborhood in Duisburg, 36 miles from the Dutch
border. All the shutters were down and no one appeared to be in the
apartment late Friday.
   Some residents on the street reacted with anger and disbelief to
the news that aus der Fuenten had been released.
   Werner Dehnen, who lives across the street from aus der Fuenten's
wife, told The Associated Press: ``I can't help but think of the
victims' families and the pain this man caused.''
   Ute Dehnen, his wife, said: ``I've never spoken to her as a
matter of principle. I would have divorced that man and I can't
understand why any woman wouldn't.''
   Another neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said: ``This is
a quiet, decent street and we don't need people like him (aus der
Fuenten) here. For me he is still a mass murderer. They shouldn't
have set him free.''
   Fischer and aus der Fuenten were imprisoned for their roles in
the deaths of thousands of Dutch Jews during World War II. They were
sentenced to death in 1950, but a year later their sentences were
commuted to life in prison.
   Dutch Justice Minister Frits Korthals Altes said keeping the two
in jail any longer would violate the rule of law because the nation
has pardoned 106 other war criminals who had originally been
sentenced to death. Fischer and aus der Fuenten were the sole
surviving exceptions, he said.
   Only two major Nazi war criminals are held by authorities in
foreign countries _ Klaus Barbie in France and Josef Schwammberger
in Argentina.
   Barbie, called the ``Butcher of Lyon,'' is serving a life
sentence in France for war crimes committed in that country.
   Schwammberger, who prosecutors say was responsible for the deaths
of thousands of people, has been jailed more than a year in
Argentina after he was captured outside a German-Argentine village.
He is awaiting extradition to West Germany.
   One of the most notorious Nazi war criminals, Alois Brunner, is
reportedly living in Syria. Brunner, a close associate of Adolf
Eichmann, has been held responsible for the wartime murder of
100,000 Jews.

   Pakistan is so close to building a nuclear bomb
that the United States probably won't be able to certify this year
that the country doesn't have one, the Reagan administration
reportedly told members of Congress before the former president left
office.
   That certification is necessary if Pakistan is to receive U.S.
economic and military aid beyond the current fiscal year. The Reagan
administration had requested $621 million in aid to Pakistan for
fiscal 1990, as part of a $4.02 billion, six-year package.
   The Washington Post today quoted congressional sources as saying
they were told by Reagan administration officials that Pakistan was
so close to building a bomb that ``it had been a very close call''
when the administration in November renewed the certification that
the country does not have a nuclear bomb.
   The newspaper said that when the certification was renewed, a
letter was attached to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, saying the
administration was nearing its limits of being able to continue
making the certification.
   ``The Congress should be aware that as Pakistan's capabilities
grow, and if evidence about its activities continue to accumulate,
this process of annual certification will require the president to
reach judgments about the status of Pakistani nuclear activities
that may be difficult or impossible to make with any degree of
certainty,'' the Post quoted Reagan as saying.
   Without certification, required annually under the law, Pakistan
will not be eligible to receive U.S. economic and military aid
beyond the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   The newspaper said it was not known if President Bush will accept
his predecessor's conclusion about Pakistan's nuclear capabilities,
although Bush is known to be extremely concerned about the problem
of nuclear weapons proliferation.
   In his letter to Wright, the Post said, Reagan said he had made
his ``best judgment'' on the basis of available information to the
U.S. government, based on the standard set by Congress regarding the
Pakistani nuclear program.
   The standard, he said, ``is whether Pakistan possesses a nuclear
explosive device, not whether Pakistan is attempting to develop or
has developed various relevant capacities.''
   Reagan said in the letter that the United States remained
``extremely troubled'' by the continuing risk of a nuclear arms race
between Pakistan and India, the Post said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush visits China next month as an old
friend of China's top leaders who has helped the nations weather
some of their stormiest relations.
   Bush will be in Beijing for two days after the Feb. 24 funeral in
Tokyo of Japan's Emperor Hirohito.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in announcing the trip
Thursday in Washington, said Bush's close ties with China were an
element in the decision to visit Beijing just one month after taking
office.
   ``Undoubtedly there are some personal issues involved there in
terms of his relations with Deng Xiaoping,'' Fitzwater said, adding
that Bush will show support for Deng's economic reforms.
   Bush has known Deng, China's senior leader, since he headed the
U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing in 1974-75. Deng at the time was vice
premier but was soon to be purged by leftists in the dying days of
the disastrous 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   Deng was firmly in control when Bush, a candidate for vice
president, returned in 1980, a year after the United States and
China established diplomatic relations. Bush, Deng said, was a ``lao
pengyou,'' an ``old friend'' of the Chinese people.
   But his welcome was less than cordial. The Chinese were outraged
by statements by candidate Ronald Reagan that his administration
might restore official ties with Taiwan, and Bush was delegated to
convince the Chinese that there would be no backsliding in
U.S.-Chinese relations.
   ``Since we are old friends we must be very frank,'' Deng told
Bush. The official Xinhua News Agency later said Bush had ``failed
to reassure China over recent statements by Ronald Reagan.''
   But the visit also had its warmer moments. Bush and his wife,
Barbara, went shopping for teacups at the Friendship Store, the
special store for foreigners, and walked over to the International
Club. There, Bush renewed acquaintances with the barber, the manager
and the tennis court attendants he had known in 1974-75.
   Bush returned as vice president in May 1982, and told
then-premier and current Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, ``We
feel at home in Beijing. During our stay here we spent a great deal
of time on our bicycles touring the city. ... Those were happy days.
Those were good days, important days.''
   That visit, however, also was dominated by the Taiwan question.
Deng spoke of the ``dark clouds'' of bilateral relations caused by
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and Bush's mission was to defuse
Beijing's demand for a final date by which all arms sales to the
rival Nationalists on Taiwan would cease.
   At the beginning of his official talks with Deng, Bush asked for
a five-minute private meeting. Instead, the two spent two hours
together and emerged to tell waiting aides that there was no need
for further discussions.
   Three months later the sides signed a communique in which
Washington agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan.
   Bush's last visit in 1985 was decidedly more relaxed. He spoke to
students in Sichuan, took a boat ride down the scenic Li River in
Guilin and toured the prosperous southern cities of Canton and
Shenzhen. He also played tennis with then-Vice Premier Wan Li.
   ``I like what I see,'' Bush told Deng. ``We still have
fundamental differences, systematic differences with China. But
we're finding more and more things in common.''
   Chinese leaders, in a nation where personal ties often outweigh
ideological concerns, unabashedly favored Bush in the presidential
election and believe that the new administration will have better
understanding of and sympathy for China because of Bush's many
contacts here.
   Deng, in a meeting with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci in
September, startled U.S. officials by saying he hoped China's ``old
friend'' Bush would win the election.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the Soviets head home, a faint wind
of change is stirring at Kabul University, cradle of the Afghan
intelligentsia whose Marxist revolution this impoverished Moslem
country has rejected.
   At the semester that started last fall, a majority of academic
staff voted for the science and agriculture faculties to scrap
courses in Marxist-style ideology that have been compulsory for all
the 7,000 students since the 1978 revolution.
   Hard-line members of the governing People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan still hold key academic positions at the university,
which numbers among its graduates of the early 1970s Afghan
President Najib, a physician, and a dozen of his top political
associates.
   But for the first time since the revolution, deans who are not
party members _ five out of 13, according to the new engineering
dean _ were appointed last fall.
   Also, the U.S.-sponsored faculty of engineering is to reopen in
March at the end of the current extended winter vacation. It was
closed after Soviet troops arrived in Afghanistan in December 1979
to try to quell the rebellion.
   In a desolate building which houses the faculty, the laboratories
are stripped of most equipment and text books are more than a decade
out of date. The most talented lecturers long ago went into exile.
   At the entrance, two holes in plaster remain where
revolutionaries ripped down a plaque stating the faculty was a gift
from the United States.
   For five years until 1963, the faculty was linked to the
University of Wyoming and then sponsored jointly by 11 American
universities and technology institutes.
   ``Because the Soviet presence was so strong here, they (the
Afghan regime) wanted to pretend to them that anything that was not
Soviet-related was bad,'' said Ata Mohammad Nazar, the new dean of
the faculty.
   Nazar, 45, has a master's degree and doctorate in civil
engineering from Colorado State University and earns the equivalent
of $250 a month.
   Huddled over a single heater in a bone-chilling office, Nazar
nurtures a folorn hope: that U.S. universities will resume support
of the faculty even though Najib remains shakily in power as the
Soviets depart.
   The Soviets are due to leave by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mandated
agreement signed in Geneva.
   But there is no sign of peace, with Moslem rebels still fighting
Najib's regime. Western countries are withholding aid and refuse to
deal with a regime they believe will fall after its Soviet
protectors depart.
   The engineering faculty, the only one that taught in English
before the revolution, plans to resume teaching in English.
   With educational standards plummeting through years of war and
Russian more widely taught than English, Nazar faces a tough task.
   He complained that Western countries, which cut ties with the
university in 1978, now punish the wrong people.
   ``We feel isolated,'' he said. ``The Russians say they made a
mistake coming here, so why should we take the blame?''
   ``To remove this government and install another: is it worth it?
They will defend themselves. How many more Afghans should die?'' he
added.
   In a nearby administrative building, Dr. Mohammad Khamrani, 35, a
founding party member who has the title of vice chancellor for
social and cultural affairs at the university, has a blunt answer.
   ``It may take millions of lives,'' he said of the conflict in
which about 1 million people already have died. ``But I am certain
we will not collapse ... The system will survive.''
   He said the scaling down of political courses as more of an
administrative arrangement to accommodate extra numbers of
non-science students in the programs.
   Khamrani, a neurologist who graduated a few years behind Najib,
spoke with scarcely concealed impatience of ``barefoot peasants''
steeped in Islam, whom the revolution was to liberate.
   The West ``rudely interfered in our affairs,'' he charged. But
Khamrani added that he and his fellow revolutionaries made some
mistakes too, trying to change things too fast in a ``feudal,
agrarian and backward society.''
   Despite rebels operating within a few miles of the city and the
Soviets on their way out, he appeared not to contemplate possible
death or jail for being a high profile party member.
   ``The Soviets will help us,'' he said from his seat beneath a
portrait of Najib. ``They won't leave us alone.''

   Dave Roberts has trouble sleeping at
night. He dreams he is back in Vietnam more than 20 years ago going
down a dark river on a Navy patrol boat trying to ambush Viet Cong
soldiers.
   He is 19 years old and scared, having been wounded once already.
Startled, he awakens in his bedroom in Tacoma, Wash.
   Roberts, now 40, and seven other veterans from the Seattle-Tacoma
area are returning to Vietnam to revisit their bases and relive
their war days of two decades ago as treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder, which includes sleeplessness and restlessness.
   ``I want to come to peace with my mind, the country and the
people and put all that behind me because the war's over,'' Roberts
said Friday during a stopover in Bangkok en route to Hanoi on the
first leg of the group's two-week tour. ``I want to get on with a
lot of things in my life.''
   Another veteran, Bob Swanson, 39, a Marine who helped build U.S.
fire bases, wants to rid himself of guilt.
   ``There's apologies I feel I need to make to the people,'' said
Swanson. ``There were civilians who were caught in our fire, and
I've had guilt feelings about that. The other thing is to try to
leave the warrior part of me in Vietnam where it belongs. It doesn't
fit in the United States.''
   Accompanying the veterans are two therapists, Ray Scurfield, a
Vietnam veteran himself, and April Gerlock, and a film crew that
will make a documentary that could be used in therapy for other
veterans.
   The veterans will undergo therapy during the trip and for two
months after they return home. They had been required to attend
group therapy sessions once a week for the last five months in
preparation for their return to Vietnam.
   ``Basically we're utilizing sort of an extension of a very
accepted therapeutic practice in working with trauma survivors,''
said Scurfield, director of the PTSD program at the American Lake
Veterans Hospital near Tacoma. ``That is direct therapeutic exposure
to the trauma.''
   ``By coming over here, our assumption is it will trigger
repressed memories and feelings that they they need to get out
consciously and talk about,'' he said. ``In doing that it appears
they come to some kind of a peace.''
   Scurfield said many veterans picture Vietnam today as it was 20
years ago.
   ``By going now,'' he said, ``they have to substitute the reality
of Vietnam today. It's not the way it was 20 years ago. That's a
very important message for many veterans.''
   The veterans will see a new landscape devoid of U.S. artillery
and air bases, covered over by red dirt, with few reminders of the
more than half a million American troops who served there.

   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell asserted his
authority to compel testimony from President Bush or former
President Reagan, and plans to rule Monday on whether to throw out
subpoenas for the two in the trial of fired White House aide Oliver
North.
   The trial of North in the Iran-Contra case was still scheduled to
begin Tuesday after an interagency task force of intelligence
experts concluded that classified documents to be presented in the
case don't pose a serious national security risk.
   ``I guess we're ready to go,'' Gesell told lawyers for both sides
Friday. ``I'll see all of you at 9:30 Tuesday morning.''
   At a hearing, Gesell said that judicial authority to force Bush
or Reagan to testify is ``indisputable.''
   ``As far as the power of the court to require testimony'' of
Reagan or Bush is concerned, ``I do not think there is any
question,'' he said. ``The court has the power.''
   Justice Department official Stephen Saltzberg said that North's
subpoenas should be quashed because the former National Security
Council aide had not specified how Bush's and Reagan's testimony
would be relevant at trial.
   Gesell said he envisioned having the Reagan subpoena remain in
force, with Reagan ``on call'' but under no obligation to appear
immediately, and the government would be heard again before any
order for him to appear.
   Larry Simms, one of Reagan's lawyers, was in the courtroom for
the hearing. Former Justice Department official Theodore Olson is
the lead attorney representing the former president.
   North also is seeking presidential documents, including Reagan's
diary. John Keker, the lawyer who will prosecute North, said that
the White House counsel a year ago had prepared typed excerpts from
the diary. Lawyers from the office of independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh, for whom Keker works, reviewed the excerpts, but did not get
copies of them, said Keker.
   Gesell delayed a ruling on the documents subpoena. Saltzberg is
to contact Reagan's lawyers and make arrangements to have those
diary segments made available to North's lawyers as well.
   Meanwhile, an administration official said secrecy concerns would
not block North's trial.
   The interagency group of intelligence experts had identified some
documents that might pose problems if Gesell allowed their
disclosure in open court by North's lawyers.
   However, much would depend on Gesell's rulings from the bench
during the trial on the relevancy and admissibility of the
documents, said the administration official, speaking on condition
of anonymity. And he said government secrecy experts familiar with
the documents did not expect the sensitive material to be admitted
because it didn't appear relevant to the case.
   The official said administration officials planned to monitor the
trial closely in the event there was an attempt by North's lawyers
to introduce into evidence documents that would compromise national
security.
   Another government source close to the matter, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that one agency he declined to identify
had problems with some of the classified information in the case,
but that the other agencies represented on the intelligence task
force had refused to go along with the objections.
   North is accused of concealing from Congress and from former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III his efforts on behalf of the
Nicaraguan Contras and of covering up the NSC's role in diverting
money from the Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's good news for women rich enough to afford
the haute couture clothes shown by 20 high fashion designers in
Paris this week. After a few seasons of extravagance, the look is
pretty and wearable.
   The mood was strictly feminine in showings dominated by tender,
wispy chiffons and silks, bias cuts, body-hugging sheaths and
bustiers, oversized pants and plenty of pleats. Evening wear was
regal with generous use of embroidery, lace and jewels, and gold and
silver applique.
   It was adieu to oversized shoulders, mini-skirts and party poufs.
The lines are fluid and graceful, with fluttering chiffons and soft
crepes seen for both daytime and evening wear.
   Hems, for the most part, skimmed the knee, although Chanel opted
for the midcalf length worn under long tunic jackets reminiscent of
the 1930s.
   Dresses cost anywhere from $10,000 and up, and set trends for the
fashion industry worldwide.
   For some designers, like Givenchy, it was the year of the dress.
But pants lovers will find some in almost every collection. Yves
Saint-Laurent's showed plenty of his signature trousers cut to
perfection, stopping above the ankle, and Per Spook excelled at
easy-to-wear pajamas pants that covered the shoe.
   For the cocktail hour, look for Guy Laroche's simple black sheath
that plunges to the waist in the back and circled by gentle
white-tipped ruffling.
   Laroche was this year's winner of the Golden Thimble award for
the most beautiful collection, and he earned it with classy designs
in colors that exploded on the runway: sunbursts of yellow, juicy
reds and bright oranges melting into gentle pastels in the palest of
blue, green and pink.
   Saint-Laurent, too, did wonders with the basics, slitting skirts
from hem to waist and revealing lots of leg. Suit jackets necklines
dipped dramatically and his ultra-sheer chiffon blouses worn with
skirts bared all.
   Italian fashion king Valentino made his debut in the world of
French haute couture, ruffling feathers in Rome. Things only got
worse when his business partner, Giancarlo Giametti, defended the
decision saying Valentino couldn't afford to show for ``down-and-out
women and second-rate actresses.''
   Valentino showed the same clothes as he did in Rome, and they
were a hit with the French couture crowd. Christian Lacroix
abandoned the extravagance of his previous collections and came up
with feminine design in clouds of pastel. He draped reams of chiffon
in flowing pant-skirts, embroidered and bejeweled raw silk. He used
lace relentlessly and gathered organza into sumptuous mountains.
   Lacroix's palette was full of sandy beiges recalling desert
exoticism _ a replacement of his previous Provencal look _ mixing
melon and pistachio pastels, poppy reds, Persian blue, black, white
and navy.
   Unlike Givenchy, Laroche and Saint-Laurent who played up the
waist with drapery, belts and buttons galore, Lacroix minimized it
with trapezium and triangular shapes.
   Torrente maintained Parisian chic by day with polka dot pastel
dresses, kick pleats sometimes topped with a bow or tiered dresses,
and always, wide-brimmed hats. For after-dark, there were draped
chiffon and crepe, held at the shoulder or waist with jewels or a
bow.
   Hanae Mori was another toast to femininity. Her floor-length
yellow draped sheath was set off by a line of ruffles running from
shoulder to toe.
   For evening wear, Christian Dior went to the sari, using feathery
light fabrics like crepe georgette or shantung silk crepe in a
diagonal movement from waist to the opposite shoulder, and Indian
style, around the back to the hand.
   Pierre Cardin made the mini even smaller than before, then
covered it up, almost.
   Nini Ricci, not known as a trend-setter, produced a large
collection of simple but beautiful clothes for all times of day.
   There were wide, soft pants, pleated and swirling skirts and
cinched waists creating a kind of nostalgic girlish prettiness.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer revelled in pants, dressing them down for day
or up for night with lace and embroidery.
   For lovers of long skirts, there's perfection in Chanel's pretty
schoolgirl look, particulary good for daytime in navy and cream. The
new Chanel jacket is longer and collarless, fastening with a single
button just above the waist.
   Watch for the newest Chanel buttons in pearl, and the silky
smooth leather purse _ the latest in Chanel chic.

<HEAD>Vets Group Asks Pentagon to Declassify Records on MIAs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says no purpose would be served by
declassifying files on Americans missing in action in the Vietnam
war, as a veterans' advocacy group is seeking.
   The National Steering Committee for American War Veterans,
chaired by Ted Sampley of Kinston, N.C., said in a letter to
President Bush, ``Use your powers as president to help us liberate
the truth. ... Mr. President, you cannot just wish that the issues
of the Vietnam War will go away.''
   Sampley said the request to Bush was partly a response to a
report from the State and Defense departments just before the Reagan
administration left office that U.S. agencies ``have yet to find
conclusive evidence of the existence of live prisoners.''
   But Army Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, chief Pentagon spokesman on
issues affecting the missing, said in response to Sampley's request,
``I don't feel a proposal like you're talking about will do anything
to enhance these ongoing efforts'' for ``the fullest accounting'' of
what happened to U.S. servicemen.
   ``It's quite obvious'' that declassification would jeopardize
intelligence sources and collection techniques, Schneider said, and
``your sources quickly begin to disappear'' when that happens.
   Information bearing on individuals in the files has been shared
with families without revealing sources and techniques, he said.
   Meanwhile, in another development, Bob Dumas of Canterbury,
Conn., speaking for the Korean War Veterans Association, said a
delegation from that group would meet North Korean officials in New
York seeking an invitation to visit North Korea for discussions on
returning the remains of U.S. soldiers killed there.
   The Pentagon still lists 2,383 Americans as missing or
unaccounted for in Southeast Asia or nearby waters. Dumas said
remains of ``probably several hundred'' Americans were in North
Korea as a result of the 1950-1953 Korean War.
   On Monday, the Vietnamese government turned over remains believed
to be those of 23 Americans killed there.
   Sampley said his group's letter was in response to the
president's inaugural address and Bush's references to a ``new
breeze blowing.''
   Sampley's group has long maintained that Americans are in
captivity in Southeast Asia. Last fall, it sponsored an incursion
into Laos by two Americans, Jim Kopp and Donna Long, to spread word
of a $2.4 million reward being offered by 21 members of Congress for
anyone who freed an American.
   The two were caught on their first day and held for 41 days
before being released.

<HEAD>Union Rolls Steady; Percentage Of Work Force in Unions Drops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor unions represented a slightly smaller
share of the nation's work force in 1988 even though the total
number of union members increased, the government reports.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the number of Americans
belonging to labor unions rose by 100,000 to 17 million last year,
but the size of the overall work force increased even faster.
   Union members continued last year to earn more than non-union
workers. Full-time workers who were union members had median weekly
earnings of $480 compared with $356 for those who were not union
members, the department reported.
   The department said 16.8 percent of the 101 million wage and
salary employees in the United States last year were union members,
down from 17 percent in 1987 and 18 percent in 1985.
   The 100,000 new union members came from the ranks of black
workers, the Labor Department said.
   In fact, there were slight decreases in the number of whites and
Hispanics belonging to unions last year. Membership among black
workers rose from 2.44 million in 1987 to 2.55 million last year,
the Labor Department said.
   The membership gain, although slight, provided some solace to
union officials who have dedicated many of their efforts in recent
years to trying to reverse declining membership.
   ``We hope we have bottomed out, but we don't know yet for sure,''
said Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO.
   There were 10.7 union members in private industry last year and
6.3 million government workers in unions.

<HEAD>Opposition Proposes Referendum On Constitutional Reforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>By RODOLFO GARCIA</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition coalition has proposed
elections for Nicaraguans to decide if they want major
constitutional reforms, the newspaper La Prensa reported.
   The opposition newspaper said the president of the Nicaraguan
Democratic Coordinate, Carlos Huembes, signed the proposal, which
was sent to President Daniel Ortega on Friday.
   La Prensa said constitutional reforms sought by the opposition
group included free elections, democratic reforms and amnesty for
political prisoners.
   The referendum would ask ``if the government should ... accept
the constitutional reforms, considering the urgency of the
circumstances.''
   Ortega is scheduled to make ``transcendent announcements'' about
the country's economic policies today when he meets with leaders of
union, peasant and professional groups that support the ruling
Sandinista government, pro-government news media reported.
   Economic conditions in Nicaragua are deteriorating and shortages
of food and basic commodities are common.
   The leftist Sandinista government and the opposition deadlocked a
year ago on discussions of such proposed constitutional reforms.
   ``We hope that the government ... will see it is obligated to
soon make announcements about the policies that affect the social
base of all Nicaraguans,'' La Prensa quoted the letter as saying.
   The opposition group is formed by five opposition political
parties, two unions and a group of professionals.
   The opposition group said it hoped that a peace summit of Central
American presidents, canceled earlier this month, will be
rescheduled for Feb. 13-14.
   The summit was canceled after Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
asked for more time for President Bush to formulate his policy in
the region.
   Although various proposals have been made, no new date has been
set.
   Ortega, Arias and the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador and
Honduras were to resume stalled talks on a stalled Central American
peace plan.
   The August 1987 plan that Arias designed calls for an end to
civil wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, political
amensties and democratic guarantees in the five Central American
nations.
   The Sandinista government and U.S.-backed anti-communist rebels
agreed in March 1988 to suspend offensive operations, but talks
aimed at a permanent end to the 7-year war are at an impasse.

   Teacher Anne Kramer is seeing double these
days. She has four sets of twins _ three identical, one fraternal _
in her preschool.
   But Kramer's double trouble is not unusual in this town 90 miles
west of Detroit. The 457-student Fletcher Elementary School has 12
sets of twins.
   ``It's just strange to turn around and keep seeing the same
people everywhere,'' Kramer said. ``If I call them by the wrong
name, they'll ignore me or correct me. I usually try to see what
they have on when they come in.''
   Second-graders Tim and Jim Fraley, identical twins with blue
eyes, freckled noses and reddish-brown hair, admitted to mischievous
behavior when they were in the same class.
   ``We'd trick our teacher sitting in each other's desks,'' Tim
said Thursday. ``And sometimes we'd wear the same clothes,'' Jim
added.
   Homer physician Mark Booth and his wife, Jill, have 3{-year-old
twin daughters, Erin and Lisa, who attend preschool. Booth said he's
heard jokes that there must be something in the water or air at his
office.
   ``It's just the luck of the draw,'' Booth said. ``We will likely
go for quite a period of time now with no twins or relatively
infrequent twins in order to make the average come out right.''
   The chance of a woman giving birth to twins is about one in 90,
said Dr. Steven Migdal, a West Bloomfield obstetrician.

   An entrepreneur is dedicated to doing for toilet
stalls what Muzak has done to elevators _ invade the senses of those
with time on their hands.
   ``Everyone reads in the bathroom,'' says Jeff Rons, a 26-year-old
from suburban Scottsdale who believes the walls of stalls can be
used to promote everything from pantyhose to taxis.
   His company, In-Stall Ad Systems, has lined up space in the
restrooms of a theater, a tavern, restaurants, and three tour-bus
companies, he said.
   The businesses will recieve a cut of Rons' revenues for
installing up to 10 framed, 6-by-6-inch ads on the back of each
stall door. Advertisers will pay about $180 per month for a
five-stall display, with a captive audience guaranteed.
   Rons said the ploy enables advertisers to target just one gender
by advertising in one bathroom.
   Pat Hick, who manages the Celebrity Theater, said the pitch made
sense.
   ``The way he presented it, it's going to be very tastefully done
and very professionally done,'' she said.
   Van Nomikos, who runs Hightops, a Scottsdale sports bar,
disagreed.
   ``We're not going to take it,'' he said. ``It kind of looks tacky
in the bathroom, I think, to put advertising in the toilets.''
   Rons, who studied architectural design, said he and a friend came
up with the idea watching a television program on different
advertising mediums.

<HEAD>At 75 Below, Even Alaskans Think It's Cold</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was too cold for driving, too cold
for flying, too cold for just about everything. It was so cold, with
wind chill readings of up to 115 degrees below zero, that even dog
sled races were canceled.
   And that isn't just an Alaskan tall tale.
   In an arctic state where people take cold weather for granted,
where subzero temperatures are about as common as frost in the lower
48, a sudden plunge into brutally bitter cold has grabbed everyone's
attention.
   It was 75 degrees below zero Friday in McGrath, about 150 miles
west of Mount McKinley. It was 43 below in Fairbanks, where
electricity demand hit an all-time high. Far to the south in
Anchorage, the state's largest city, the high Friday was 15 below.
   ``We're not declaring an emergency yet,'' Gov. Steve Cowper said
with a stiff upper lip as Alaskans wondered whether the temperatures
would break the record of 80 below zero set in 1971 at Prospect
Creek.
   However, in a brief radio message, the governor gave instructions
on how to call for emergency help. And, he acknowledged, ``There's
no end in sight, apparently.''
   The National Weather Service held out a bit more hope, saying
temperatures could rise by the middle of next week. Forecasters said
they didn't know whether the cold air would have an effect on
temperatures elsewhere in the United States.
   The cold snap, carrying wind chills of up to 115 below, is being
caused by the southerly flow of the jet stream, which ordinarily
carries storms that bring relatively warm air into Alaska, the
forecasters said.
   By contrast, it remained unusually warm through the middle and
eastern sections of the nation Friday, with highs soaring into the
60s as far north as South Dakota. Records were set in many cities,
including Rapid City, S.D., with a high of 63, and Apalachicola,
Fla., where it was 77.
   The Alaskan cold forced school closures in some towns, and people
in some Kodiac Island communities replenished their household
heating fuel with supplies from well-stocked schools.
   In a state that relies heavily on air travel because of its size,
the cold forced the cancellation of some flights. Some rural grocery
stores reported dwindling supplies.
   The adjutant general of the Alaska National Guard, Maj. Gen. John
Schaeffer, said the guard would have difficulty making emergency
assistance flights because of the cold. However, he said planes
might be able to drop emergency supplies into settlements if
necessary.
   Schaeffer said most rural Alaskans stocked up on essentials
before the winter, and only the ``uninitiated'' were likely to get
caught short.
   The National Guard's diesel-powered trucks were among the few
vehicles still operating in McGrath, where the morning temperature
of minus 75 warmed to minus 59 by 11 a.m. Friday.
   A McGrath radio station featured an interview with a man who was
able to keep his Datsun pickup running. The hardy driver described
his technique, which involved the use of two heaters _ including one
that he moved back and forth under the truck.
   Even the Kuskokwim 300 sled dog race, which runs between Bethel
and Aniak, had to be postponed because of the cold.
   With temperatures of minus 45 in Bethel and considerably lower
elsewhere along the route, organizers decided to keep the 20 mushers
inside until the temperature rose to at least 25 below.

   President Bush concluded what he called a
harmonious first week in the White House by urging caution in
dealing with the Soviets and giving his support to a 50 percent pay
raise for Congress.
   Holding his first news conference as president on Friday, Bush
displayed ease and confidence in fielding reporters' questions in a
session that ranged in topics from abortion to foreign relations.
   Bush today was meeting with former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger for a briefing on his recent trip to the Soviet Union.
Kissinger met with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and delivered
personal greetings from Bush.
   Tonight, Bush's schedule includes an appearance at the annual
dinner of the all-male Alfalfa Club in Washington. The group each
year hosts a humorous dinner with remarks by prominent politicians
and business leaders.
   Despite the club's all-male membership, Bush ``will follow the
tradition of past presidents and attend,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The decision was criticized by Ann Lewis, a women's activist and
prominent Democratic political consultant, who cited the club as an
example of how women are excluded from opportunities to make
business connections.
   She also gave a copy of a rule in the federal personnel manual
that states ``federal personnel acting in their official capacities
shall not participate in any conference or meetings held in
facilities in which discrimination is practiced on the basis of sex,
religion or national origin, as well as race.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, is the outgoing president of the
club.
   In his news conference Friday, Bush deflected questions about
such controversies as a possible fee on deposits at banks and thrift
institutions, and the abortion views of Dr. Louis Sullivan, his
nominee for secretary of health and human services.
   ``I think it's been a wonderfully harmonious week,'' Bush said.
``And these are just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise
calm pond.''
   He downplayed the Treasury Department plan on the savings account
fee, saying that was ``an option, not a proposal.''
   Bush said the administration was reassessing all aspects of
U.S.-Soviet relations. He said he doesn't think the Soviets consider
``that as foot-dragging. I'm confident they don't.''
   Asked if he felt there still was a ``Cold War'' between Moscow
and Washington, Bush said he wanted to avoid the phrase.
   ``If someone says `Cold War' to me, that doesn't properly give
credit to the advances that have taken place in this relationship,''
the president said. ``But if it's used in the context of, are we
still unsure of _ in our predictions on Soviet intentions _ I'd have
to say, yes, we should be cautious.''
   During his campaign, Bush declared, ``the Cold War is not over.''
   On Friday, Bush said he wanted to take the offensive on foreign
policy rather than merely react to moves by the Soviets, adding,
``But prudence is the order of the day.''
   On other topics, Bush:
   _ Said of the pay raise that would bring salaries for members of
Congress to $135,000 a year: ``A raise is overdue, there's no
question about that.''
   _ Said Iran ``can have an influence'' in winning the release of
the American hostages in Lebanon even though it does not actually
hold them. He recalled ``a period of time when we had excellent
relations with Iran, and I don't want to think that the status quo
has to go on forever.''
   _ Discussed this week's Supreme Court decision that sharply
restricted the ability of state and local governments to reserve a
fixed percentage of contracts for minority businesses without proof
of past discrimination. Bush said, ``I will not read into that a
mandate to me to stop trying on equal employment and on affirmative
action generally,'' he said.
   _ Asked how long his campaign promise against any new taxes would
last, said, ``I'd like it to be a four-year pledge.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The local staff of the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut locked Ambassador John McCarthy in his office for three hours
to press for higher salaries, an embassy source disclosed today.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Lebanese staff, including guards armed with rifles, blocked all
entrances to the compound Friday afternoon in the suburb of Aukar.
   They ``prevented anyone from entering'' the ambassador's office.
``The ambassador was there alone all the time,'' the source said.
   He said the protest ``lasted for about three hours, after which
the Lebanese employees decided to call off the move for a week to
give the ambassador time to follow up their demands with
Washington.''
   He replied ``no comment'' when asked what the contingent of U.S.
Marines stationed at the compound did during the protest.
   The source said the local staff demanded ``increase of salaries,
and (were) protesting the lack of benefits for their families.'' He
would not elaborate.
   Some of the guards fired in the air ``in jubilation after the
ambassador promised to take up their demands with Washington,'' the
source said.
   McCarthy, 49, assumed his post on Sept. 24, eight days after his
predecessor, John Kelly, was flown out of the country with a heart
ailment.
   ``Today, the situation is normal at the embassy. But the
relationship (between the Lebanese and American employees) will
never be the same,'' the source added.
   He estimated the Lebanese staff at the embassy at 500, but said
he could not tell how many were involved in the incident. Most
junior U.S. employees have been withdrawn from war-torn Beirut for
security considerations the past four years.
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing and
presumed kidnapped in Lebanon. The longest held, Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was
abducted March 16, 1985.

   A truck carrying Haitian
sugar cane workers missed a curve on a cliff, overturned and plunged
into a ravine, killing at least 23 people and injuring 40,
authorities said.
   Military officials said the truck was traveling Friday to Santo
Domingo with about 78 Haitians who had been recruited for the annual
sugar harvest when it crashed in about 22 miles north of the
capital. The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti.
   The injured, including five children and three women, were taken
to Santo Domingo hospitals for treatment. Doctors said at least 13
people were listed in serious condition.
   Julio Guerrero, spokesman for the State Sugar Council which
operates 12 of the country's 16 mills, said the council was not
responsible for transporting the Haitians.
   Dominicans recruit Haitians at low wages for the tortuous work of
cutting sugar cane.

   Three million voters went to the polls
today in elections to fill 20 seats of the National Assembly and
provincial legislatures.
   The elections commission announced one of the seats for the
National Assembly, the lower house of Pakistan's parliament, had
been won because it was uncontested by a member of Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party.
   At stake are 13 seats in 237-member National Assembly and seven
in three of Pakistan's four provincial legislatures.
   The polls are taking place in districts where candidates in last
November's general elections won more than one seat, or the vote was
postponed because a candidate died.
   The outcome of the polls cannot dent the position of Ms. Bhutto,
who heads the federal government in Islamabad on the basis of her
sizeable majority, bolstered by support from smaller groups and
independent lawmakers.
   At the center of the opposition is Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, chairman
of 9-party Islamic Democratic Alliance, a rival of Ms. Bhutto's. He
is contesting for the national assembly from the rural Kot Addu
district of Punjab, the nation's biggest and richest province where
the democratic alliance rules.
   The by-election results will indicate whether the Pakisan
People's Party or the Islamic Democratic Alliance has lost or gained
in popularity since November's general elections.
   Polls opened at 8 a.m. and close at 5 p.m. Results were expected
Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Yan Naing, one of Burma's ``Thirty
Comrades'' who rebelled against British rule during World War II and
led the country to independence, died today of a heart ailment. He
was 71.
   The ``Thirty Comrades,'' led by the late national leader Aung
San, secretly went to Japan in 1940 for military training in
preparation for an uprising against British colonial rule.
   Later, the men turned against the Japanese occupation of Burma
during World War II and formed the core of politicians who led the
nation to independence in 1948.
   The nine surviving members of the group include retired strongman
Ne Win and Kyaw Zaw of the outlawed Burmese Communist Party.
   Yan Naing eventually turned against the military-dominated
government of Ne Win and took part in an insurgent movement from the
Thai-Burmese border. He returned to Rangoon in 1980 under a general
amnesty offered by the Ne Win government to several rebel groups.
   Yan Naing took part in some of the pro-democracy demonstrations
that were crushed last September in a military coup but did not join
any opposition political party.

<HEAD>Federal Medical Prison Looks More Like College Campus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE MALICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors and nurses scurry to make their
rounds and patients in wheelchairs and gurneys fill the halls. It
looks like an ordinary hospital but the patients are convicted
felons, among them swindlers and spies.
   The Federal Medical Center could just as easily be a college
campus with its open spaces, tree-lined walkways and outdoor
recreational facility that includes a basketball court, ice rink and
jogging path. The combined prison and hospital moved onto the
grounds of a former state hospital that closed in 1982.
   ``We want the appearance to be reasonably attractive,'' said
Warden Joseph Bogan. ``We think it would be unproductive and unwise
to tear down the trees, remove the grass and put in concrete.''
   The tranquil scene has its limits. The 55-acre center is
surrounded by a double razor-wire fence, patrol trucks carrying
armed guards circle the complex and computerized sensing devices
detect movement along the perimeter.
   But unlike most federal prisons, the Federal Medical Center
concentrates security on the perimeter and allows inmates relative
freedom inside the fences. There are no bars on the windows of the
low-to-medium-security facility and inmates do not need passes to
move about the campus.
   The prison, located in this southeastern Minnesota town of 60,000
that's home to the Mayo Clinic, admits federal convicts who need
medical or psychiatric care. The only similar institution, the
Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Mo., is a
high-security facility.
   In Rochester, guards within the perimeter do not carry weapons.
Inmates are aware of the prison's policy that it will not give in to
the demands of prisoners in the event of a hostage situation, John
Chreno, executive assistant to the warden, said recently. No one has
tried to escape since the first prisoners arrived in October 1984,
he said.
   ``You wouldn't even know you're in prison here,'' said Michael
Rosenow, who is serving a three-year sentence for tax evasion.
Rosenow works in the prison's business office during the day and
takes classes at night.
   Frederick Coffey, who is serving time for a fraud conviction,
described the atmosphere as ``much more relaxed'' than other prisons.
   ``My idea of being incarcerated was the bar (on the windows)
scene, but we're mostly free to move around here,'' he said.
   Bogan defended the prison against criticism that it coddles
criminals.
   ``Most of our inmates will be back among us eventually and it's
in society's best interests not to brutalize them,'' he said.
   The hospital, which employs eight full-time physicians, 57 nurses
and 72 other medical personnel, can treat most illnesses except
those requiring kidney dialysis, Chreno said. The prisoners often go
to the nearby Mayo Clinic for treatment, and clinic doctors come to
the prison for consulting work or to perform surgery.
   ``Patients come here for everything from severe mental disorders
to personality disorders to terminal cancer to orthopedic work,''
Chreno said. ``We represent a cross section of the illnesses of
society. There's nothing in society that's not represented by some
offender.''
   About half of the prison's approximately 580 patients work in the
kitchen, on the grounds crew or in a factory which makes cables for
the government.
   About 120 inmates are there for medical reasons, about 75 for
psychiatric treatment and others for chemical dependency.
   Criminals who have spent time at Rochester include FBI agent
Richard Miller, who was sentenced in January 1986 to life in prison
for spying for the Soviet Union; Lee Alexander, the former mayor of
Syracuse, N.Y., sentenced to 10 years for running an
extortion-kickback scheme; and Anne Pollard, who is serving a
five-year term for helping her husband sell documents to Israel.
   The prison drew opposition when the plans for it were announced.
Gertrude Tyce, who led the fight, said she still believes prisons
don't belong in neighborhoods.
   ``But it's here now and we're not going to sit and crab about it
forever,'' she said.

<HEAD>Investigators Call Off One Search for Bundy Victim's Remains</HEAD>

   Searchers who set out to find the remains
of two of serial killer Ted Bundy's victims were forced to postpone
one search until spring because of snow and frozen ground.
   ``We found some really promising places, but the snow's just too
deep,'' Carbon County Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Cowan said after a
daylong hunt for the remains of a victim believed to be 15-year-old
Susan Curtis.
   ``We've called it off until the spring. We need some snow melt,
and we'll wait until the ground is dry and we have warmer
temperatures,'' Cowan said.
   Meanwhile, a search for another victim's remains got under way
near Capitol Reef National Park and a third search was planned today
along U.S. 89 in central Utah. Yet another could begin next week
near Grand Junction, Colo.
   In an effort to make the most of Bundy's flurry of eleventh-hour
confessions, the FBI announced Friday it would convene a meeting of
law enforcement agents from around the country in an attempt to
clear up unsolved slayings linked to the executed killer.
   The meeting will take place in Quantico, Va., within three weeks
if the schedules of various investigators allow it, according to FBI
major case specialist Terry Green.
   In the days before his execution last Tuesday, Bundy, 42,
confessed to 23 killings. Investigators believe he may have
committed as many as 100 slayings beginning in 1969.
   Bundy has been suspected in killings, solved and unsolved, in
Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Florida, Vermont, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
   ABC's ``20-20'' on Friday aired an emotional telephone
conversation between Bundy's mother, Louise Bundy, of Tacoma, Wash.,
and the mother of victim Susan Rancourt. The conversation, arranged
by a Seattle television station, took place the day of Bundy's death.
   Mrs. Bundy, her voice quavering, told Vivian Rancourt of La
Conner, Wash.: ``I've said it before and I'm glad to be able to say
it again directly to one of the moms, we don't know why this
happened and we feel so desperately sorry for you. We didn't want
our son to do this. ... I am sorry.''
   ``I know you are,'' Mrs. Rancourt replied. ``And we (don't) hold
any resentment or hatred toward you or your family.''
   Mrs. Rancourt's 18-year-old daughter, a student at Central
Washington State College, disappeared in 1974.
   The following year, Susan Curtis disappeared while attending a
youth conference at Brigham Young University in June. In a
confession shortly before his execution, Bundy recalled taking a
girl from the Brigham Young campus in Provo, killing her and burying
the body south of Price, about 60 miles southeast of Provo.
   Before the search for Ms. Curtis' body was called off Friday,
more than 20 search and rescue team members pinpointed four
promising spots along a highway outside Price.
   Searchers using metal detectors scanned the snow in hope of
picking up signals from the girl's dental braces. But the only
positive signal was found to be from a piece of a steel-belted
radial tire, Cowan said.
   Officials from the Salt Lake County sheriff's office met with
investigators in Wayne County to search an area near Capitol Reef
National Park where Bundy said he buried 17-year-old Nancy Wilcox of
Holladay, who disappeared in October 1974.
   A third search, along U.S. 89, was planned today by Bountiful
police seeking to find the remains of Debi Kent, 17, who disappeared
in November 1975.
   Bundy confessed to the slayings of Ms. Kent and Ms. Wilcox and
disclosed the proximate locations of their remains during an
interview two days before his execution for the murder of Florida
schoolgirl Kimberly Leach, 12.
   He confessed to the third Utah slaying and the slaying of Denise
Oliverson of Grand Junction, Colo., during a tape-recorded interview
with Florida prison authorities 45 minutes before he was strapped
into the electric chair.
   Sgt. Greg Kuhn of the Grand Junction Police Department said
officials probably will decide Monday whether to search for the body.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has joined the
growing ranks of prosecutors and political leaders calling for the
resignation of U.S. Attorney Frank L. McNamara, who is under fire
for a variety of alleged improprieties.
   ``The situation has been an embarrassment for months and months
and months,'' Dukakis said Friday. ``I don't think this appointment
should ever have been made.''
   Twenty-eight of the 39 federal prosecutors in Massachussetts
called for the removal or resignation of McNamara, who is their
boss, saying his presence is jeopardizing the credibility of their
office.
   Criticism of McNamara, a 41-year-old Republican appointed by
President Reagan in 1987, has been growing since November, when the
Justice Department said it could find no basis for his allegations
that his predecessor, William F. Weld, smoked marijuana at a party.
   Shortly thereafter, McNamara admitted that he had smoked
marijuana as recently as four years ago. More recently, he has been
criticized for pressing investigations that were allegedly aimed at
discrediting Democrats, including Dukakis.
   McNamara declined comment Friday. Asked how he could continue his
duties under the circumstances, he replied, ``You have to address
that question to somebody else, because I don't have any comment.''
   Prosecutors in the Boston and Springfield offices under
McNamara's command sent a letter Friday to U.S. Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh urging him to fire the embattled chief prosecutor.
   ``Because Mr. McNamara will neither resign nor step aside
temporarily, the credibility and operations of this office will
continue to be damaged, perhaps irretrievably, unless he is
removed,'' the letter said.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said if no action is forthcoming from
the Justice Department, ``then I think (congressional) hearings will
be necessary.''

   Some anti-abortion protesters convicted on charges
stemming from last summer's demonstrations say they will not pay
their $500 fines, the leader of an anti-abortion group said.
   Nine men were convicted Friday in Fulton County State Court of
criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly for blocking entrances
and driveways at the Feminist Women's Health Center on Aug. 10.
   The nine were fined $500 each and given six months probation.
   But Michael Hirsh, local director of the New York-based
anti-abortion organization Operation Rescue, met with the men after
the trial and said later that several planned to refuse to pay the
fine.
   ``We will go toe-to-toe with the system at every opportunity and
we'll continue to until they lay us in our graves and outlaw
abortion,'' Hirsh said.
   The jury deliberated about 20 minutes after hearing two days of
testimony in the case, which stemmed from a series of demonstrations
organized in Atlanta by Operation Rescue that landed more than 1,000
protesters in jail.
   Lynn Wilson, vice president of the Georgia Abortion Rights Action
League, said the convictions set an important precedent.
   ``It's important as a symbol,'' Ms. Wilson said. ``I think it's
clear now that the public is not, and will not, be willing to accept
Operation Rescue and its illegal tactics.''

<TEXT>
   Several armed civilians who took
over an suburban army base escaped a military counterattack and may
be preparing another assault, Argentina's attorney general says.
   ``We know that in this attack more people participated than were
killed or arrested,'' Andres D'Alessio told a news conference Friday.
   D'Alessio said a former leader of the now-defunct People's
Revolutionary Army, Enrique Gorriaran Merlo, took part in the
attack, but offered no proof of his involvement.
   ``His participation is presumed, taking into account his former
guerrilla activity, his training and the connection he had in recent
times with (leftist groups),'' D'Alessio said.
   The government says 60 leftist guerrillas staged the assault. The
armed civilians battled soldiers for 27 hours, and 38 people died,
including 28 guerrillas. Eighteen of the attackers were captured.
   D'Alessio said police have interrogated the survivors and jailed
two more people. He said arrest warrants have been issued for five
others, including Gorriaran Merlo. He said more violence was
possible.
   ``An armed group that suffers a public defeat of this size in
general sees it as necessary to do something to demonstrate it's
still in condition to keep operating,'' he said.
   The People's Revolutionary Army clashed openly with Argentina's
army in the 1970s in an attempt to overthrow the government. The
guerrilla army was thought to be virtually decimated. It had
formally disbanded in 1980.
   Gorriaran Merlo fled to Nicaragua. According to police reports
and his own admission in a published interview, he participated in
the 1980 bazooka attack on a street in Asuncion, Paraguay, that
killed deposed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   Gorriaran Merlo, 47, has been wanted by Argentine police for
years. President Raul Alfonsin ordered his prosecution shortly after
taking office in December 1983.

<TEXT>
   A city councilman's campaign to buy back
semiautomatic assault rifles has taken a curious turn, with one
group of people turning in weapons shortly after buying them at gun
stores.
   The five people, who turned in seven assault rifles, intend to
donate the $2,100 they received to families of the victims in the
Stockton schoolyard shooting, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
   ``We do not want to profiteer or benefit from their tragedy,''
said Jeff Fox, spokesman for a group of Van Nuys real estate office
workers.
   Fox, 37, said the five parents were shocked by the Jan. 17
shooting that killed five children and wounded 30 others, including
a teacher at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton in northern
California.
   The killer, Patrick Purdy, used a semiautomatic AK-47 assault
rifle to shoot the pupils and then used a pistol to kill himself.
The incident has focused attention on the destructive capabilities
of the easily purchased weapons.
   City Councilman Nate Holden, who originated the buyback idea,
said a tally Friday evening showed that 42 AK-47s and two Uzi
machine pistols had been turned in.
   Holden, who will pay the value of the weapon up to $300, said he
paid a total of $9,841.88 for the weapons.
   The Los Angeles Police Department has supported the campaign
against the military style rifles favored by street gangs, and has
helped publicize procedures for safely bringing the weapons to its
stations.
   People with police receipts showing they had returned a gun were
paid from a $50,000 political committee fund that Holden, a mayoral
candidate, set aside Tuesday.
   Those who turned in weapons had a chance to pick up an additional
$300 by taking a copy of the police receipt to radio station KIIS-FM
in Hollywood from Thursday morning through Friday morning.
   Lynn Anderson-Powell, KIIS president and general manager, said
she didn't care if people made money off the giveaway.
   ``Our purpose was to decrease the number of guns on the street.
... We feel that's that many fewer lives that may be needlessly
taken in violence,'' she said.
   One woman bought 13 AK-47s and turned them in Thursday, not for
the $300, but ``to get them off the shelf,'' said Holden.
   Holden said the unidentified woman paid a total of $5,191.88 for
the 13 high-powered weapons, and didn't make a profit by turning
them in to authorities.
   She was paid $3,900, or $300 per rifle, by KIIS-FM, and Holden
said his office reimbursed her for the remaining amount.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., introduced
legislation in Congress on Friday to outlaw the possession of
semiautomatic firearms.
   Berman's bill would require civilian owners of fast-firing
weapons to turn them over to a law enforcement officer within 30
days after the bill takes effect. Violators would face $5,000 fines
and five-year prison terms.
   The National Rifle Association called Berman's plan a ``stupid
piece of legislation'' and said it would mount a strong lobbying
campaign to defeat the bill.

<HEAD>Americans, Soviets, Cubans Discuss 1962 Missile Crisis</HEAD>

   Cubans attending an international conference on the
1962 missile crisis criticized the conduct of their Soviet allies in
the incident, saying the Kremlin shut them out of some decisions, a
participant said.
   The Moscow conference, which opened Friday, is the first on the
topic to bring together representatives of the United States, Soviet
Union and Cuba.
   Each country maintains its own version of what happened in
October 1962, when the Soviets deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba and
the United States imposed a quarantine on the island and demanded
and obtained the removal of the missiles.
   Representatives at the conference include former U.S. Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara and former Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
A. Gromyko.
   At Friday's session, the Soviets and Americans clashed on whether
war was imminent more than a quarter-century ago.
   ``The American side cited conversations among themselves about
whether they'd live to see days in the following week to back their
contention that the threat of war was real,'' said a participant.
``On the Soviet side, Gromyko said the Soviets never at any time
acted under the belief that war was a real possibility.''
   The proceedings were closed to reporters, and the participant
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   During the session the Cubans complained that the Soviets did not
consult them sufficiently during the crisis, the participant said.
They also complained the United States should have used diplomatic
channels to express its demand that the Soviet missiles be withdrawn
and to clarify American intentions.
   Georgy A. Arbatov, head of the U.S.A.-Canada Institute, a Kremlin
think tank, told the conference Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev
erred in shipping nuclear missiles to Cuba because he hadn't
anticipated the U.S. reaction and that he humiliated his country,
the participant said.
   Other Soviet officials at the session, however, praised
Khrushchev as a ``great statesman'' who succeeded in getting the
Americans to pledge not to invade Cuba.
   The discussions are organized by Harvard University's John F.
Kennedy School of Government.
   At a conference sponsored by the Kennedy school in 1987,
Americans and Soviets met to review the crisis, but the meeting in
Moscow is the first to include Cuban representatives, led by Jorge
Risquet, a member of his Communist Party's governing Politburo.
   Seated around an oval table topped with blue felt, McNamara and
other U.S. participants _ including McGeorge Bundy, Theodore
Sorenson and Pierre Salinger _ are exchanging thoughts with Soviets
including Gromyko, Arbatov and Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the former
Soviet ambassador to Washington.
   President Bush, in a message read at the ceremony by Jack
Matlock, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, called the session the
``latest example of the new openness'' under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Bush said international security would be helped by closer study
of the Cuban missile crisis. ``This can only improve our mutual
understanding of just the sort of episode we must avoid in the
nuclear age,'' he said.
   In his own message of greetings, Gorbachev called on participants
to ``think over and draw lessons from this event that brought the
world to the brink of the nuclear precipice.''

<HEAD>Snow Piles Up In the Rockies, Thunderstorms Boom In Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow piled up in the southern Rockies today in a storm that
triggered tractor-trailer wrecks in Colorado, and scattered showers
and thunderstorms extended over the central and southern Plains.
   Clear skies prevailed over much of the nation.
   The Western storm left 8 inches of snow in Durango, Colo., and
Farmington, N.M., and 7 inches in Jemez Mountains northwest of Santa
Fe, N.M., on Friday. Denver and Colorado Springs, Colo., had light
snow.
   Winds gusted to 50 mph in the Colorado Springs area, and Pueblo,
Colo., had dense fog.
   Several tractor-trailer rigs jackknifed and there were a couple
of auto accidents on Interstate 25 in Colorado, but no serious
injuries were reported, said State Patrol communications officer
Donald Piquette. The interstate was temporarily closed because of
ice.
   A winter storm warning for heavy snow was in effect for the Four
Corners area of Colorado. Snow advisories were in effect for the
southern mountains of Colorado, the northern mountains of New Mexico
and the northwest Plains of New Mexico.
   Scattered thunderstorms fell across central and northwest Texas
today, and rain showers extended over central and northern Texas,
Oklahoma, central Kansas and south central Nebraksa. Dense fog
enveloped parts of Texas.
   Thunderstorms late Friday produced small hail near Andrews,
Texas, and at Hobbs, N.M.
   High-temperature records for Jan. 27 were broken Friday in seven
cities in the Midwest and Florida and tied in five. It was a balmy
60 degrees in Yankton, S.D., where the old record of 53 degrees was
set in 1909, and the 63-degree reading in Rapidy City, S.D., tied a
record set in 1896.
   The nation's high temperature Friday was 84 degrees in West
Kendall, Fla.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorm over much of
the southern and central Plains and western sections of the lower
and middle Mississippi Valley, with thunderstorms most numerous over
central and northeast Texas; snow over the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles, eastern Colorado and northeast New Mexico; scattered
snow over northern Maine; and strong, gusty winds along the eastern
slopes of the Montana Rockies.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 50s and 60s from the
middle and south Atlantic Coast to the Ohio and Tennessee valleys,
the lower middle Mississippi Valley, the southern two-thirds of
Texas, the desert Southwest and much of California; the 70s in
extreme southern Texas and much of Florida; and in the 30s and 40s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 12
degrees below zero at Idaho Falls, Idaho, to 70 degrees at Key West,
Fla., and McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.

   The coast guard today found two more bodies believed
to be crewmen of a freighter that collided with another vessel and
sank off western Japan, maritime officials said.
   The discovery brought to six the number of bodies recovered after
the 2,900-ton Catherine-Rose, a Panamanian-registered cargo ship
carrying 17 South Korean crew members, sank Thursday off
Yoshimi-cho, 530 miles west of Tokyo.
   The six had not yet been identified, said Yasushi Horie of the
Moji branch of the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard.
   Six boats, two helicopters and a plane were searching the area
today, Horie said.
   On Friday night, police arrested a deck officer of the other ship
_ the 2,400-ton Semba Wang of Singapore _ in connection with the
collision, Horie said.
   Choi Young-kyo, 48, was the vessel's duty officer at the time of
the accident, Horie noted. He declined to elaborate.
   Officials said none of the 16 men on board the Semba Wang, all
South Koreans, were injured, but the ship sustained ``heavy'' damage
to its bow.
   The Catherine-Rose, bound for the South Korean port of Pusan, had
a cargo of 3,000 tons of scrap steel.
   The Samba Wang was traveling from Yosu on South Korea's
southwestern coast to Mizushima, Japan, 350 miles west of Tokyo,
officials said.

<HEAD>Conyers: Miami's Overtown Has Been Shortchanged</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After touring the scene of Miami's recent riots, a
Michigan congressman accused police of being ``trigger-happy'' and
said he could sense the seeds of discontent among the area's black
residents.
   ``There's a lot of pent-up frustration in this (area), anger,
bitterness,'' Rep. John Conyers said Friday as he stood in front of
the charred ruins of a grocery store in the predominantly black
Overtown neighborhood.
   At another point he told a resident who was concerned about a
lack of jobs: ``Overtown has been shorted. The question is how did
it happen and what we can do.''
   Conyers, chairman of the Government Operations Committee and a
member of the Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional
rights, promised to help coordinate relief for Overtown.
   The fatal shooting of a black motorcylist by a Hispanic police
officer on Jan. 16 sparked three days of burning, looting and
violence. The motorcyclist's passenger died of injuries sustained in
an ensuing wreck.
   The unrest spilled over into the Liberty City area, and left one
dead, 11 wounded by gunfire and about $1 million in structural
damage, not including the buildings' contents.
   Conyers, who was invited to tour the area by Raymond Fauntroy,
president of the local chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, told cheering residents at a community meeting that
there are ``too many trigger-happy policemen abusing the rights of
black people in this area.''
   The Democrat also charged that federal funding the Carter
administration promised in the aftermath of riots in 1980 was later
cut by the Reagan administration.
   For example, he said, of $40 million in loans slated for small
business owners, only $16 million ever made it into the community.
Of $10 million for low-income housing, only $2 million came through
for Overtown, he said.
   ``It's part of the legacy of broken promises to Overtown,''
Conyers said.

   A convicted drug dealer has been arrested in
prison on charges of trying to arrange the killing of U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani.
   Salvatore Spatola allegedly plotted to kill Giuliani in a July 21
telephone call with an undercover New York City police detective.
Spatola was in prison at the time for an earlier drug conviction.
   Spatola, 40, and his brother, Federico, 45, of Scotch Plains,
N.J., were named in a racketeering indictment unsealed Friday.
   In addition to racketeering, both were charged in the 10-count
indictment with conspiracy, heroin trafficking and conspiring to
kill two people other than Giuliani in a murder-for-hire deal.
   Giuliani, who is scheduled to leave office next week, declined to
comment about the case.
   Salvatore Spatola was arrested Friday at the Federal Correctional
Institution in Lewisberg, Pa., where he is serving his five-year
sentence.
   Last October, Spatola pleaded guilty to state charges for his
part in the bungled 1987 rubout attempt on a defendant in the
massive Pizza Connection drug case.
   His brother was arrested at his Manhattan pizzeria. Prosecutors
sought to have him held without bail and U.S. Magistrate Nina
Gershon ordered him held pending a bail hearing Tuesday.
   In the racketeering counts, both brothers were accused of
plotting to distribute large quantities of heroin and also plotting
last year to have two people other than Giuliani killed.

   It was a simple oversight that ended the
career of habitual robber J. Douglas Creswell, a Louisiana
prosecutor says.
   Creswell, 51, forgot to cut eyeholes in the plastic garbage bag
he wore in a botched motel holdup last year, according to Keith
Milam, assistant district attorney for Beauregard Parish.
   State District Judge Homer L. Colthorp gave Creswell concurrent
25-year prison sentences Friday for two clothing store holdups a
week before the botched robbery at the Park Motel, Milam said.
   Creswell, armed with a knife, walked into the motel last May and
began pulling a garbage bag over his head, according to a statement
by motel clerk Monica Stroud.
   Creswell suddenly realized he had forgotten to make eyeholes in
the bag, the clerk told police.
   ``So he started pulling on the bag to try to put some holes in
it,'' Milam said. ``And then he asked for the money. Well, she said
she wasn't going to give him any money and he left.''
   The clerk called police and Creswell admitted to the botched
holdup when he was arrested minutes later, Milam said. Authorities
said Creswell previously had been convicted of four armed robberies
in Texas.

   A bomb tossed at a passing
police car from the roof of a nearby building exploded today,
killing one policeman and injuring two others, officials said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in the
border village of Sion Mills in west Northern Ireland, but suspicion
fell on the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting British rule in
the province.
   A spokesman at police headquarters in Belfast said the three
policemen were driving down the main street of the village when
someone standing in the doorway of a pub signaled for them to stop.
   Not realizing it was an ambush, the policemen halted their car
and one got out to investigate. An assailant then threw a bomb at
the car from the roof of a nearby building, wrecking the car, police
said.
   One of the two officers inside the vehicle died of his injuries
as he was being taken to a hospital, and the other officer inside
the car was badly hurt, police said.
   The third policeman was also slightly injured when about 200
people spilling out of a nearby discotheque pelted him with bottles
as he went to the aid of his colleagues, police said.
   A woman near the scene was treated for shock, police said.
   The noisy crowd also attacked army and police arriving at the
scene but was dispersed when the reinforcements fired a rubber
bullet, said the police spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with the mostly
Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   Two Navy fliers were killed when their
F-14 jet fighter crashed in a cotton field while on a training
flight from California to Louisiana, a military spokesman said.
   The cause of the crash, which occurred Friday about six miles
west of Arizona City, was under investigation, said Petty Officer
Barbara Vega, a Navy spokeswoman in San Diego.
   The plane was assigned to squadron VF-114 at Miramar Naval Air
Station in San Diego, she said.
   Identities of the pilot and the radar-intercept officer were
withheld pending notification of relatives.
   ``It was really an unfortunate accident. This squadron had just
finished flying five years without an accident,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Bob
Pritchard, another Navy spokesman in San Diego.
   Pritchard said the jet and another F-14 left Miramar Friday on a
routine training flight. He said the second F-14 landed at
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson and was to return to Miramar,
he said.
   There apparently was no communiciation with the second fighter or
air-traffic controllers before the crash, and it was not known
whether the victims tried to eject, Pritchard said.
   There were no other injuries at the crash scene and no buildings
were damaged, he added.

<HEAD>GNP Growth Strong For 1988; Dollar Continues Its Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street cheered a government report that indicated the
nation's economy lost some of its steam in the fourth quarter of
1988, easing fears that the pace of economic growth could fuel
inflation.
   The Commerce Department reported Friday that the nation's gross
national product slowed to 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter. The
figure was below Wall Street's expectations and provided fresh
evidence that the economy was slowing to a sustainable pace.
   The report also said the economy grew a healthy 3.8 percent for
all of 1988.
   Bond traders welcomed the fourth-quarter growth figure by bidding
up prices of long-term government bonds _ thereby pushing interest
rates lower _ which provided fresh momentum for Wall Street's
ongoing rally.
   Brokers said a rise in the dollar in foreign-exchange trading
Friday also helped stir investors' enthusiasm for stocks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 31.79
points to 2,322.86, bringing its gain for the week to 87.50 points.
   The government said the 1988 GNP figure benefited from a
narrowing of the trade deficit and a large increase in business
investment.
   The increase came even though growth slowed sharply in the final
three months of the year to the slowest quarterly performance in two
years.
   Commenting on the GNP report, the Bush administration said the
fourth-quarter slowdown was not a warning that the six-year record
peacetime economic recovery was in endangered and should not
overshadow the stellar performance of the economy for all of 1988.
   The GNP report also indicated inflation picked up during the
year, with a price index tied to the GNP rising by 4.2 percent, the
fastest increase since a 6.2 percent rise in 1982.
   Analysts said the Federal Reserve likely will consider the
inflation level too high and keep up its pressure on interest rates.
But Bush on Friday played down any differences between the
administration and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   ``He is more concerned about inflation pressures than I am right
now,'' Bush said at a news conference. ``It seems to me there is an
area of difference. But generally speaking, I think we are fairly
close together.''

   Singer Michael Jackson has apparently forsaken
the concert stage at age 30, giving what was billed as his last
performance.
   Jackson, appearing an hour late after being mobbed backstage by
celebrity well-wishers, took the stage Friday night amid a vapor
mist and the deafening roar of a capacity crowd at the Los Angeles
Sports Arena.
   ``Since this is the last concert there was a big mob scene
backstage,'' publicist Lee Solters said early today. ``A lot of
people were wishing him well.''
   Dozens of stretch limousines were on hand, carrying stars such as
actors Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Fonda, Raquel Welch and Michael Landon
and singers Phil Collins, Dionne Warwick, Tiffany and members of the
heavy metal group Motley Crue.
   Many fans said they had waited weeks to see Jackson, who canceled
December shows in Los Angeles because of strained vocal cords.
Tickets for the farewell show were fetching prices well beyond their
face value.
   Sylvia Smith, 35, who attended the concert with her 9-year-old
daughter, Barika, said she was offered $100 for her $27.50 loge seat
but turned it down.
   ``It was tempting since I could've let Barika go in with her aunt
and uncle,'' Ms. Smith said. ``But she said, `No Mommy, you gotta
go.' And I figured if it's Michael's last concert, I may as well be
part of history.''
   Although Friday's show was billed as a farewell performance,
Jackson's manager backed off from saying the reclusive performer
would never appear in concert again.
   ``I'm not saying he's not going to perform live again, but I
don't think we'll ever go out on tour like this,'' Frank Dileo said.
   The show marked the end of Jackson's ``Bad'' tour, a grueling,
16-month effort that took him around the world.
   Jackson, celebrated as widely for his eccentricities as for his
songs, vocals and choreography, intends to keep recording and is
considering film roles, Solters said.
   Jackson, who hasn't granted an interview since 1984, is said to
be interested in movies, writing, producing and directing.
   Taking the stage accompanied by bodyguards, Jackson sang and
danced his way through a number of his hits Friday night, backed by
dancers dressed as punk rockers, monsters and street gang members.
   He used his signature ``moonwalk'' movements to glide across
stage, singing such songs as ``Starting Something,'' ``The Way You
Make Me Feel'' and ``Man in the Mirror,'' as the audience howled and
stomped in approval.

<TEXT>
   The Polisario Front, which has been
fighting Morocco for independence of the phosphate-rich Western
Sahara for 13 years, announced today a unilateral truce on all
fronts throughout February.
   The announcement, made by the information ministry of the
``Saharan Arab Democratic Republic,'' the Polisario's
government-in-exile, is the group's contribution to improving
conditions for the summit of North African leaders next month in
Marrakech, Morocco, the statement said.
   The statement comes before further expected meetings between
Morocco's King Hassan II and the Marxist group's leaders. Two
meetings between Moroccan representatives and the guerrilla group
were held earlier this month in Marrakech.
   The Polisario statement said the organization had decided on ``a
unilaterial military truce during all of the month of February and
on all fronts of combat.''
   It said the Polisario's participation in the summit of the
Maghreb countries would be defined ``during the next meeting between
His Majesty Hassan II and the (group's) leaders.'' It did not
specify a date for the talks.

   North Korean naval ships today seized
two South Korean fishing boats with a total of 21 crewmen aboard in
international waters off the peninsula's western coast, government
officials said.
   North Korea's official media confirmed the capture but said the
ships were deep in its territorial waters. An investigation was
under way, the north's official Korean Central News Agency said in a
dispatch monitored in Tokyo.
   The agency said a navy patrol boat had captured the boats in the
Yellow Sea.
   Officials at the Office of Fishery in Seoul said the Taeyang No.
7 and its sister ship, the Taeyang No. 8, both 100-ton trawlers,
were taken to North Korea after being stopped near the territorial
limit.
   The Taeyang No. 7 carried 12 crewmen and the Taeyang No. 8 nine
crewmen when they were seized by North Korean naval vessels 30 miles
west of Paengyong-do, South Korea's western-most island in the
Yellow Sea, the officials said.
   The boats apparently were captured without a shot being fired,
they said.
   The South Korean fishing boats left their home port of Inchon on
Monday and stayed in international waters when North Korean naval
craft ordered them to change their course toward the north, they
said.
   The area is close to the sea extension of the Korean Military
Demarcation Line that separates the two Koreas roughly along the
38th parallel. North Korea seized many South Korean fishing boats in
the area in the past, but returned most of them.
   The incident took place at a time when the two Koreas are
negotiating to open several different channels of dialogue to ease
tension on the peninsula.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their land was
divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought a bloody
three-year war after the north invaded in 1950.

   The mouse game, as familiar to Maine
county fairgoers as Ferris wheels and cotton candy, is destined to
become a midway memory.
   Fair officials attending the annual meeting of the Maine
Association of Agricultural Fairs learned Friday that the mouse game
had been declared illegal _ just like the cow chip casino.
   In the mouse game, players buy numbered tickets in hopes that a
mouse, when released, will run down a correspondingly numbered hole
on the rim of a spinning table.
   The director of the state Animal Welfare Board, Clyde F. LeClair,
said any game of chance in which an animal is used to determine the
outcome is prohibited by statute. Horse racing is regulated by a
separate set of laws.
   The cow chip contest, in which a cow is turned loose in a
fenced-in area lined with numbered squares, became illegal in late
September when state police shut down a contest at the Cumberland
Fair. The proceeds were to help buy playground equipment at a local
school.
   The head of the licensing division, Sgt. Bruce Refnell, confirmed
that until the Cumberland Fair incident, he was unaware of the state
humane law prohibiting the use of animals.
   ``That got us thinking about the mice used at the fairs, and they
fall under the same rule,'' Refnell said
   Billy Burr of Billy Burr's Fun-O-Rama said his midways did not
use the mouse game last year.
   ``In fact, Maine was the only state that I know of that still
allowed the game,'' Burr said Friday. ``It's another tradition lost
but it won't affect me at all.''

<TEXT>
   Teamsters union leaders have been called to a
meeting in Washington today to discuss the federal government's
offer to settle a racketeering lawsuit, a newspaper reported.
   The Plain Dealer of Cleveland said the union's 16 international
vice presidents were notified Friday of the meeting in a message
from union President William J. McCarthy.
   The message said the meeting was to discuss ``pending
litigation'' and invited the vice presidents to bring their lawyers,
the newspaper said in today's editions.
   The meeting was called after U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani of
New York reportedly sent an 18-page settlement proposal to Teamsters
general counsel James T. Grady.
   Giuliani is leaving office next week and was described by one
Teamsters associate as eager to settle the lawsuit he filed against
the union in federal court last June, the Plain Dealer said. The
suit, which seeks the removal of top officers of the 1.6
million-member union, is scheduled for trial Feb. 27.
   The newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said the proposed
settlement calls for direct election of the union's president,
secretary-treasurer and international vice presidents. An
independent panel would oversee the elections and monitor union
activities.
   Teamsters have been electing leaders through delegates at
conventions every five years.

<TEXT>
   The two German war criminals
pardoned and returned to West Germany by the Netherlands had
``indirect responsibility'' for sending Anne Frank to her death, a
World War II historian said today.
   But there is no direct link between the Dutch Jewish girl who
died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and the two elderly
Germans freed from prison Friday, said Loe de Jong, considered the
nation's foremost authority on World War II.
   Franz Fischer, 87, and 79-year-old Ferdinand aus der Fuenten were
deported to West Germany after spending 43 years in a Dutch prison.
   The two were high-ranking Nazi officials responsible for sending
thousands of Dutch Jews to their deaths during World War II.
   Only 6,000 of the Netherlands' 150,000 Jews survived Nazi
persecution.
   ``The group that arrested the (Frank) family in Amsterdam
operated under the command of Aus der Fuenten and Aus der Fuenten
worked under the instructions of Fischer,'' De Jong told The
Associated Press. ``It would be correct to say they had indirect
responsibility'' for Anne Frank's fate.
   De Jong is the author of the 14-volume ``History of the Kingdom
of the Netherlands in World War II,'' a government-commissioned
study.
   Anne Frank and her family were arrested by a German police unit
known as the Green Police in August 1944, and were first deported to
the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-held Poland.
   Anne later was moved to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in
Germany, where she died of pneumonia in 1945 at age 15.
   From June 1942 until her arrest, Anne wrote her diary as the
Franks hid in a secret section of an Amsterdam canal house closed
off from the rest of the building by a bookshelf.
   The book, perhaps the most famous personal document to come out
of the Holocaust, was published in 1947 and was turned into a play
and movie.
   Fischer ran the Hague-based Jewish Section of the Nazi Security
Service (SS). In that capacity, ``he gave guidelines ... about which
Jews should be rounded up,'' De Jong said.
   Aus der Fuenten, an SS administrator who ran what was cynically
called the Central Directorate for Jewish Emigration, oversaw the
deportations of thousands of Jews from Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The
Hague.
   Fischer and Aus der Fuenten were sentenced to death in 1950, but
their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment a year later.
   They were the world's only war criminals who had been jailed
since World War II, according to the government, which said keeping
them here any longer would violate the principle of equality before
the law.
   The Netherlands has pardoned and freed 107 other war criminals
who had been sentenced to death.

<HEAD>Bill To Tame Tabloids Dies in Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons scuttled legislation intended
to protect individuals from intrusive newspaper reporting when the
bill's supporters failed to muster enough support to force a vote.
   Even some legislators whose private lives had become grist for
London's racier dailies spoke against the bill on Friday, and the
government said remedies already existed.
   The bill's sponsor, Conservative John Browne, said, ``Preserving
privacy is in the public interest. We hope this bill will put water
in the moat of everyone's castle.''
   After five hours of debate Friday, the bill fell one short of the
necessary 100 votes to close debate and vote on whether it should
move to the next parliamentary phase _ called a second reading. The
House of Commons has 650 members.
   The legislation would have created a statutory right of privacy
and permitted suits for breaches. It would have placed the burden on
the newspaper to show that its disclosures were for the public
benefit.
   George Galloway, a Labor Party member, said he and his family had
been subjected to what he called the ``rampaging rat packs of the
tabloid press'' following his admission in 1987 that he had had an
extramarital affair. But he still opposed the measure.
   Timothy Renton, minister of state in the Home Office, told
legislators there was growing resentment ``at the way some of the
tabloid press blatantly exposes private lives.''
   However, Renton said the bill in question could prove ``a clumsy
instrument.''
   Robin Corbett, a Labor member who once worked for the tabloid
Daily Mirror, denounced the government's apparent neutrality on the
issue.
   ``There is no doubt at all that the excesses of the sewer Sun and
other tabloids have reached such proportions in the quest for
sensation and sleaze that action must be now taken,'' Corbett said.
   Britain's tabloids far outsell such respected newspapers as The
Daily Telegraph or The Times. The Sun, with circulation of 4.2
million, is read by a quarter of all adults in Britain, according to
readership surveys made in 1986. The tabloid Daily Mirror reached 20
percent of adults, while the Telegraph reached 6 percent and The
Times 2 percent.

   A rules change adopted by Rotary
International will allow Rotary clubs worldwide to join their U.S.
and Canadian counterparts in accepting women members.
   Rotary International's council on legislation, meeting in
Singapore, adopted a change in the service club's constitution and
bylaws that will allow the 23,900 clubs in 164 countries to admit
women starting July 1, club officials said.
   The new provision will not require that women be included, and
clubs in some countries are expected to continue to ban them.
   U.S. clubs began admitting women in June 1987 after the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld a California law requiring service clubs to
admit women. Canadian Rotaries followed last November after clubs in
Montreal argued that exclusion of women violated the country's laws.
   Nearly 11,000 of the 420,000 Rotarians in Canada and the United
States are women.
   But until this week, international documents of the club still
called it an organization for ``adult male persons,'' Mim Neal, a
spokeswoman at the club's Evanston headquarters said Friday.
   The legislative council, with members from around the globe,
voted 328-117 to change the constitution and bylaws. The new
membership provisions will be sent to all clubs.
   If 10 percent of the clubs oppose the change, the decision will
be reconsidered at the Rotary International convention in Seoul in
May, Ms. Neal said.

   A buoyant Lech Walesa said today he was
satisfied with the government's offer to legalize Solidarity and
that the country's political outlook had changed.
   Speaking at a news conference after talks with the government
Friday, Walesa said the ruling Communist Party has provided
``political guarantees or political openness _ and I think it's
sufficient as a guarantee.''
   He also said upcoming talks between the government and
opposition, including Solidarity, should progress as quickly as
possible because Poland's problems are urgent.
   ``Lech Walesa is really scared,'' he said. ``The situation in the
country is very difficult.
   ``But there are terribly difficult and complicated problems and
they can't be solved that quickly,'' he added.
   The government and Solidarity leaders announced Friday in a joint
communique that talks on re-legalization of the banned Solidarity
trade movement and on political and economic reform would begin Feb.
6, according to the state news agency PAP.
   The statement also said Friday's session ``discussed the problems
of trade union pluralism, including Solidarity.''
   ``I am satisfied and very tired,'' Walesa had told reporters
after negotiating Friday for more than 11 hours to set the date for
the broader talks. ``I made hours of overtime.''
   The joint statement said a preliminary decision had been made to
set up three working teams for economic and social policy, political
reforms and union pluralism.
   Participants also agreed to set up groups on agriculture, mining,
legal and court reform, self-government, mass media and youth, the
communique said.
   Friday's talks were held in a secluded government house in the
woods in Magdalenka, a Warsaw suburb.
   The government first proposed the talks on Poland's future during
a wave of strikes in August, the country's worst labor unrest since
the government imposed martial law in December 1981 and crushed
Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's only independent trade union movement.
   The talks appear to be part of a government effort to bring the
opposition into the battle to reverse the economic decline that has
left Poland with chronic shortages, a daunting foreign debt and a
dispirited generation of young people.
   Walesa was accompanied to the negotiations by a group of seven
union activists and advisers, and three representatives of the
church.
   Others with Walesa included Gdansk Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski;
Zbigniew Bujak, the former underground Solidarity leader; and
Mieczyslaw Gil, chairman of Solidarity at the Nowa Huta steel mill
in Krakow.
   Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, Politburo member
Stanislaw Ciosek, and Janusz Reykowski, head of state-radio and
television, were among the representatives of the authorities, PAP
said.
   Walesa has said he would not hold talks on Poland's future until
the authorities made a political decision to make the union legal.
   In a dramatic reversal of policy last week, the Communist Party
Central Committee approved an offer to allow more than one legal
trade union to exist and opposition participation in the government.
   Solidarity, founded in 1980, was crushed in a December 1981
military crackdown and banned the next year.

<HEAD>West German Official Backs Nuclear Missile Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz told
NATO defense specialists he supports plans to modernize short-range
nuclear missiles in Europe.
   However, critics at the NATO session immediately fired back that
his speech was too vague in outlining West Germany's position on a
Pentagon call for extending the range of such missiles.
   U.S. Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., told Scholz that it appeared
``you kind of want to have it both ways.''
   In his speech to NATO defense experts meeting in Munich, Scholz
laid out a middle ground between the Pentagon proposals and West
German public opinion, which is strongly against such changes.
   Scholz said only that North Atlantic Treaty Organization missiles
``must be kept modern.'' He gave no details.
   The first day of the annual weekend strategy conference produced
heated debate over various issues facing the alliance's 16 members.
   When Scholz mentioned West Germany's resistance to picking up
more of NATO's expenses, U.S. participants charged that Europeans
have not been pulling their financial weight.
   U.S. Defense Secretary-designate John Tower got a round of
applause when he arrived at the conference but sat quietly through
the sharp exchanges.
   Another major issue was how the West should respond to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's disarmament overtures.
   A 1983 NATO decision to refit existing short-range missiles to
extend their range beyond the current limit of 300 miles is
increasingly unpopular among Europeans, especially West Germans.
Many of them see the plan as an obstacle to further arms control
reductions.
   Scholz echoed Pentagon skepticism about the Kremlin's willingness
to relinquish its military might but skirted direct mention of West
Germany's attitude toward missile modifications.
   In the dispute over NATO expenses, Rudman said that as much as 60
percent of the U.S. military budget goes for NATO-related defense.
He said European members must accept additional alliance costs.
   Edward Luttwak of Georgetown University told the gathering that
``in the last 20 years, other people have been living inside the
house of strategic security without paying the rent.''
   Scholz also drew fire from West German opposition Social Democrat
Karsten Voigt, who said the defense minister failed to take a clear
stand on the issue of missile modifications.
   ``You were really perfect when it comes to being vague,'' said
Voigt, who opposes the proposed modifications.

   George Bush was a dynamo of action, getting to
work early, staying late and saying there were no surprises to wipe
the smile off his face. On the other hand, he didn't have to make
any tough decisions in his first week as president.
   ``No one is naive enough to assume that what we think has been a
good two days will define the 1,458 days between now and
inauguration, 1993, but it is, I hope, the kind of quality that
could be expected,'' White House chief of staff John Sununu said in
an early assessment.
   It was a brisk first-week pace.
   Bush delighted congressional leaders of both parties with a
meeting that sparked talk of a honeymoon.
   He called dozens of foreign leaders.
   He scheduled trips over the next month to Canada, Japan, China
and South Korea.
   He stressed ethics in government.
   He met with the press three times.
   He went jogging and turned up at the Washington Cathedral, the
State Department and Constitution Hall.
   While refusing to draw a comparison with the detached, hands-off
style of Ronald Reagan, a White House official said one of the most
interesting aspects of the first week was that Bush demonstrated a
curiosity about what was happening.
   ``He's poked his head into several staff people to ask what
they're doing, to see how projects are coming,'' said the official,
who asked not to be identified by name. ``Most of the people on the
staff, by the end of the week, had received a note of one kind or
another from him that either told of a phone call he had made on a
subject of their interest or asked about a project in their area or
somehow identified he was involved in a project they were working
on.''
   Up before dawn, the new president was in the Oval Office around
7:15 a.m. each day and stayed until after 6 p.m. most nights.
   ``It's been a good, easy week,'' Bush said Friday at a relaxed,
fast-moving news conference. ``And I expect it will change
dramatically in the days ahead.''
   Suffering from a cold that left him hoarse, Bush said, ``If it
weren't for the cold _ smile and enjoy it while you can because I
can already sense, you know, looking forward to a little more _
little more confrontation out there.''
   The news conference provided a sharp contrast between the styles
of Bush and Reagan. For his infrequent meetings with reporters,
Reagan studied briefing papers and sample questions for days and
then held at least two dress rehearsals with his staff. Sometimes
Bush was among those in the audience to critique the answers.
   At the actual news conferences, Reagan often seemed ill at ease
and the sessions often turned out to have little news value.
   Bush, a veterans of more than two decades of government service
and a specialist on foreign policy matters, did not need much
preparation for his news conference, aides said. He was given a list
of some of the questions that had come up in the daily briefings of
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, but there were no practice
sessions.
   Standing in the press room, Bush seemed confident and in high
spirits, calling on many reporters by name and interrupting the news
conference at one point to turn the table on reporters and grill
them about the practice of asking follow-up questions.
   There were early tastes of trouble with a new controversy over
the abortion views of Dr. Louis Sullivan, his nominee for secretary
of health and human services, and an uproar over a Treasury
Department proposal to rescue the savings and loan industry by
charging a depositor fee. Bush brushed aside the flaps as ``little
ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm pond.''
   The ripples are likely to get bigger _ soon.
   By Feb. 9, the date of his address before a joint session of
Congress, Bush has to decide who wins and who loses in the battle
for federal funds, as he divides up a shrinking budget pie and
struggles to cut the deficit.
   Privately, White House officials are passing the word that there
won't be enough money for Bush to keep all his campaign promises for
education and other programs for his ``kinder and gentler'' nation.
   ``Look, I don't expect it's going to be all sweetness and harmony
and light,'' Bush said. ``The minute we get those proposals up there
on Feb. 9, I expect we're going to have other firestorms swirling
around.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., came away from Bush's
meeting with congressional leaders saying, ``We're going to get
tough when we get the specifics (on the budget) but there's no need
to get the specifics today.''
   Bush said at midweek he was putting in a lot of time on the
budget but that progress was slow. ``I think it's a little early to
make conclusions one way or another on all that,'' he said.
   House Minority Whip Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., said, ``The honeymoon is
still on _ two more days, three more days. Enjoy it while it lasts.''

   As Soviet troops withdraw from Afghanistan, the

   When night falls over this capital,
Afghan soldiers, shabbily dressed, but armed with Russian-made
Kalashnikov rifles, stop automobiles at every city block.
   Their jerky movements betray their nervousness.
   At the airport across the city, an Afghan army general sees off a
family on a flight to India.
   A man standing nearby, who assumes it is the general's family,
observes bitterly: ``See, he's getting them out _ he can afford to.''

   This is Kabul.
   As the last days slip away before the Soviet army is due to leave
Afghanistan by Feb. 15, a 10-year civil war rages on, nobody knows
what will happen next, suspicion and fear are widespread, and no one
looks like a winner.
   Without the Soviets, the survival prospects of the pro-Marxist
regime of President Najib are counted in months by most Western
diplomats in Kabul.
   The seven groups of Moslem rebels, whose commanders control great
swaths of the countryside as warlords, are divided among themselves.
   Hundreds of towns and villages are wrecked by Soviet and Afghan
bombing raids, an estimated 1 million people have been killed in the
conflict and 5 million _ a third of the population _ have fled to
Pakistan and Iran.
   The Soviet Union, whose costly military intervention began in
1979, stands condemned by the West and many Third World countries as
an occupying superpower that met with gallant resistance from
guerrilla fighters.

   On the drab, icy streets of Kabul, the Soviets look like wearied
colonial administrators in the dying days of an empire as they
distribute airlifted emergency rations from armored vehicles to cold
and hungry crowds who throng handout points, even though they say
they're delighted the Red Army is going.
   Soviet commanders, keen to publicize the handouts and coy about
the withdrawal and whether promises of continued military assistance
to Najib will include more bombing raids, grumble openly about
Afghan inefficiency.
   ``The local administration did not give out the orders in time
for when they needed to get food supplies,'' said Maj. Gen. Lev
Serebrov, No. 2 in the Soviet high command here, and the traders are
hoarding to raise prices.
   Still, he acknowledges that Moscow's Afghan adventure has gone
wrong.
   ``We came here with a very honorable task, with open hearts ...
we are leaving, and we have a sense of not having accomplished our
mission to the end,'' he told Western reporters.
   The Kabul mayor, Afghan army Gen. Mohammad Hakim, claims the city
has a three-month stockpile of food and fuel to withstand any
blockade by rebels _ now entrenched on the outskirts _ once the
Soviets go.
   But Western diplomats say reserves are virtually exhausted. U.N.
aid officials warn that without more emergency supplies the capital
of more than 2 million people, half of them war refugees from the
provinces, faces disaster.
   The West provides little more than token aid, refusing to deal
with Najib's administration.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, appear unwilling to ditch Najib, or to
take him off to Moscow in the hope of forging a last-minute
agreement on a coalition in which the rebel leaders would sit with
at least some of the Marxists.

   Despite the efforts of the Soviets, Najib's People's Democratic

   The small group of Western journalists in Kabul are gathered at
the Intercontinental Hotel, on a hillside overlooking the capital.
It is the sole hotel in the city with a telex and the only one left
with central heating.
   Even there, power cuts are frequent.
   The Foreign Ministry tries to keep a close watch on reporters,
assigning them guides-interpreters with English ranging for the
hesistant to the fluent.
   The cars supplied by the state operate on near-empty tanks
replenished a few gallons at a time on the black market by drivers
who pay with sheafs of local currency they haul around in carrier
bags.
   The Foreign Ministry, inundated with visa applications from
journalists, clamped down on issuing new visas in early January.
   Western diplomats suspect the move followed orders from the
Soviet high command seeking to pull troops out of the capital with
the minimum of publicity. The Foreign Ministry says it acted because
it does not have enough interpreters _ known by reporters as
``minders'' _ and cars to cope.

   Meanwhile, the quiet Soviet pullout continues.
   The Soviets have handed over some key perimeter posts round the
city to the Afghan army, stripped army recreation rooms at the
airport, and head north in armored columns up the 250-mile Salang
highway to the Soviet border.
   Under a U.N.-mandated agreeement, 50,000 Soviet troops in
Afghanistan left by Aug. 15 and the remaining 50,000 are to be gone
by the February deadline.
   Embassies, including the Soviet Embassy, have run down their
staffs and evacuated foreign families.
   Whatever happens after the Soviets go, it is hard to find an
Afghan who believes there will be peace.
   ``It's all been a big mistake, the war, the Soivets coming
here,'' said airline mechanic Anargul Eshaqza, as he waited in a
gasline fuel line.
   ``Peace? Maybe in another 10 years.''

   Now that he lives in Minneapolis, artist
John Berry has found that his works are becoming hot in his old town.
   Especially hot are three Berry paintings which used to hang in
the Old Rock River Cafe and Deli. Cafe co-owner Mike Leifheit says
he'd like to know where they're hanging now.
   ``He's become our most-stolen artist,'' Leifheit said recently of
Berry.
   The most recent theft occurred early this week, when a painting
depicting Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, was stolen from the deli's
front bar.
   It was the third work by Berry stolen from the cafe, where works
by two other artists also have been taken.
   Berry took news of the latest heist in stride. He noted wryly
that the thief has ``excellent taste'' in art.

<TEXT>
   Thirty years ago the communist bloc shattered with
the bitter rift between China and the Soviet Union. Today, the
world's two largest communist states are picking up the pieces of
their long-lost solidarity.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrives Thursday to
advance the accelerating process of political normalization between
the two countries.
   His visit is expected to lay the groundwork for Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's visit during the spring for the first
Sino-Soviet summit since Nikita Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung met for
bitterly divisive talks in 1959.
   Gorbachev's talks with senior leader Deng Xiaoping and other
officials will formally end a freeze on party and government
relations that began when the two nations split over ideological and
strategic differences in 1960.
   Economic and cultural relations have seen steady improvement
since the two sides first embarked on political normalization talks
in 1982. Trade last year was an estimated $2.8 billion, up from $300
million in 1982.
   The two countries will exchange nearly 1,000 scholars this year,
compared to 10 in 1983. Sister programs are being formed, joint
ventures established and tours conducted across borders once
demarcated by barbed wire and bayonets.
   China's hard-line stance toward the Soviet Union has softened in
the past year as it joins the world trend toward detente and
perceives major progress in what it labels the ``three obstacles''
to normal ties with Moscow.
   The most important obstacle, Soviet support for Vietnam's
invasion of Cambodia, remains the toughest to overcome. But in
August the two sides for the first time met face-to-face on the
issue and agreed it was time for Vietnam to get out. China, backer
of the anti-Vietnam resistance in Cambodia, has welcomed Hanoi's
plans to withdraw its troops by September.
   Gorbachev, who has actively pursued an end to Sino-Soviet
ill-will, has taken steps to remove the other two obstacles by
pledging to end the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and to reduce
by 200,000 men the Soviet troops in Asia _ mainly on the tense
Sino-Soviet border.
   Despite the heady progress, the real interests of China as it
strives to bring better lives to its 1 billion people remain in
furthering its economic, technological and even cultural ties with
the West.
   Chinese leaders insist they will never return to the Sino-Soviet
relations of the 1950s, when Beijing depended on Moscow's economic
largesse and obediently adhered to its strategic interests.
   That halcyon period, once described as ``lasting, unbreakable and
invincible,'' actually comprised only a brief interlude in a long
history of distrust and hostility between the two nations.
   Lenin and Stalin showed disdain for Mao's peasant-based
revolutionaries, and forced the Chinese communists to ally with the
stronger Nationalists in the 1920s and 1930s even when Chiang
Kai-Shek's Nationalists were bent on their destruction. The Soviets
called the Chinese ``radish communists'' _ red on the outside but
white on the inside.
   Moscow continued to send arms to the Nationalists during the
1937-45 war against Japan, even though Chiang spent most of his
energies fighting Mao's forces rather than the Japanese.
   In the early 1950s, shortly after the communist victory over the
Nationalists in 1949, the Soviet Union provided China with loans and
technical assistance for heavy industry and several thousand
military advisers.
   But relations rapidly deteriorated, in part because of personal
antipathy between Mao and Khrushchev, Stalin's successor.
   The turning point was Khrushchev's 1956 denunciation of Stalin.
   Mao thought Khrushchev was trying to usurp control of the
communist world and said his efforts to ease tensions with the
United States were undermining the unity of the communist bloc.
   Khrushchev believed Mao's communes and radical socialism were
nonsense.
   In 1959 Khrushchev rescinded on an offer to supply Beijing with a
``sample'' atomic bomb, and in the summer of 1960 the Kremlin
stopped all aid to China, pulling out more than 1,000 technicians
and effectively terminating more than 200 Soviet-backed industrial
projects.
   In 1962, aroused by Soviet propaganda, 60,000 Moslem Kazakhs in
the far western Chinese province of Xinjiang fled to the Soviet
Union, while others staged uprisings against Chinese troops. That
same year Moscow continued to supply advanced jets to India, then
fighting a border war with China.
   The two countries veered close to war in 1969, when fighting
broke out along their disputed 5,000-mile border. China claimed huge
tracts of land it said Tsarist Russia had seized in ``unequal
treaties'' of the 19th century.
   Chinese leaders, partly to unify a nation then in the throes of
the leftist Cultural Revolution, launched a campaign to store grain,
dig air raid tunnels and move factories into the hinterlands in
preparation for a Soviet invasion.
   The invasion never came, but throughout the 1970s both sides
maintained more than 1 million troops along the boundary. China's
assertion that the Soviet ``hegemonists'' represented the biggest
threat to peace was a key factor in the resumption of relations in
the 1970s with the United States.
   Relations with Moscow only began to improve after Mao's death in
1976 and the emergence of the pragmatic Deng Xiaoping, who says
there is no imminent threat of war and China must devote its
energies to economic development.

   A rare first edition of the 16th
century book ``Rimas,'' considered the Portuguese equivalent to the
works of Shakespeare, has vanished from Rio's Federal University,
officials said.
   The missing 1595 ``Rimas,'' or ``Rhymes,'' by Luis de Camoes, is
one of only six copies of the book known to exist, said Edwaldo
Machado Cafezeiro, head of the university's literature school.
   Its value is incalculable, Cafezeiro said in announcing Thursday
that the book was missing.
   ``It's worth a fortune to a collector _ $10 million is very
possible,'' he said. ``And there is a market for rare works.''
   The yellowed book disappeared after rains and floods last year
damaged the university library, Cafezeiro said. Rare books in the
collection were moved to dry rooms, but an inventory later showed
150 to 200 works were missing.
   Also among the missing was a valuable second edition of ``Rimas''
published in 1598, Cafezeiro said. However, the gem of the
collection, a copy of Camoes' other masterpiece, ``Os Lusiadas,''
was saved.
   After months of searching, the university called the federal
police. The investigation was kept secret at the request of police
until now.
   ``We need help to recover this work. It's a genuine treasure of
Brazil,'' Cafezeiro said.
   The theft of antiques is common in Brazil, especially the robbery
of carvings and precious metal ornaments from the many colonial-era
churches.

<HEAD>Officials Say Some Minority Programs Will Escape Supreme Court Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Many state and municipal governments say they are confident they
will escape the effects of last week's Supreme Court ruling striking
down a racial quota system for public-works contracts because their
plans are less strict.
   Boston and Atlanta are among the exceptions, and officials there
say some programs may be jeopardized.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, struck down a program in Richmond,
Va., that required white-owned companies bidding on any city
contract to set aside 30 percent of the contract's value for
minority-owned subcontractors.
   The ruling said rigid racial quotas must be supported by evidence
of past discrimination; for example, that black-owned enterprises
tried to obtain construction contracts but were denied them. Without
such evidence, the use of racial quotas violates the
equal-protection rights of whites, the court said.
   But many state affirmative action programs are voluntary, have
goals rather than mandatory targets for minority participation, or
were based on evidence of discrimination, said a sampling of
officials contacted by The Associated Press.
   Michigan authorities are confident the U.S. Supreme Court will
uphold their law, which requires 7 percent of all purchasing and
construction grants to go to minority-owned businesses and 5 percent
to go to businesses owned by women.
   State officials say they believe enough evidence about
discrimination was presented before the law took effect. ``It took
10 years of bill introductions and hearings to get it through the
Legislature,'' said John Roy Castillo, executive director of the
Civil Rights Commission.
   A California program that took effect this month should survive
an expected challenge because it sets goals, not absolute quotas, of
15 percent for minority participation in state business and 5
percent for women-owned companies, said Assemblywoman Maxine Waters.
   However, attorney John Findley of the Pacific Legal Foundation
said minority contracting plans in California have one thing in
common with the Richmond measure: ``There's no showing of past
discrimination and a program designed specifically to remedy it.''
   According to the state Department of Finance's population
research unit, California's 27.8 million population is 24 percent
Hispanic, 7 percent black, and 9 percent Asian and others.
   Baltimore requires prime contractors to subcontract 20 percent of
a project's worth to minority contractors and 3 percent to women,
but City Council vice president Jacqueline McLean said the city
addressed the high court's major objections to Richmond's law.
   ``We held lengthy hearings and established a clear and convincing
record of past discrimination against minority contractors,'' Ms.
McLean said. Baltimore is 54 percent black.
   The Supreme Court's ruling has an economic effect in Richmond.
   Richmond is 52 percent minority, according to City Manager Robert
C. Bobb. Before the ordinance went into effect, less than 1 percent
of the city's construction work was awarded to minority companies,
he said.
   During the life of the ordinance, minority companies were awarded
about 40 percent of the city's work. Since the law's suspension in
July 1987 because of the litigation, the percentage has dropped back
below 2 percent, Bobb said.
   The Georgia Supreme Court is considering a challenge to Atlanta's
35 percent minority business enterprise program, and officials of
the black-majority city fear the state court might take its cue from
the ruling in the Richmond case.
   ``The Atlanta program has almost exactly the same defects that
Richmond's has,'' said William O. Miller, president of the
Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative group challenging
Atlanta's program.
   Last year Atlanta awarded $24.9 million in jobs to minority-owned
businesses, 36.7 percent of all of its contracts. More than $300
million in city business has gone to minority contractors since the
35 percent minority set-aside program was established in 1975.
   Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said he feared the ruling could
jeopardize some of his city's affirmative action programs in
development, hiring and contracts.
   A city ordinance adopted in 1987 required Boston to award 15
percent of all contracts to businesses owned by minorities and 5
percent to businesses owned by women.
   Boston is about 35 percent minority. Minorities and women
received $27 million in city contracts in fiscal 1988, about 14
percent of the total eligible dollars, said Sheila Hubbard, director
of the mayor's Minority and Women Business Office. That compares
with $15.2 million in fiscal 1985.
   A Louisiana law guarantees minority companies 10 percent or more
of state and some local government business, and various localities
have similar laws.
   Angelisa Harris, executive director of Louisiana's Office of
Minority and Women's Business Enterprise, said that while the
Richmond ruling may force Louisiana to provide additional
documentation to justify its programs, she believes they will be
able to continue operating.

   Ron Brown says he will not pick a fight with
Jesse Jackson to demonstrate his independence as the new Democratic
party chairman, but that there are bound to be conflicts with the
presidential candidate he worked for in 1988.
   ``I'm not looking for it, trying to orchestrate it,'' Brown said
in an interview last week in advance of succeeding Paul G. Kirk Jr.
in the party post. ``I'm sure at one time or another I'll have the
opportunity to demonstrate independence from any of the potential
candidates in `92.''
   Brown's election to the party chairmanship was assured last week
when three of his four rivals for the post dropped out and endorsed
him. Only former Rep. Jim Jones of Oklahoma continued his challenge,
but there was near unanimous agreement within the party that Brown
will be a sure winner when the Democratic National Committee votes
Feb. 10.
   John Henry Anderson, the Georgia Democratic Party chairman who
had supported one of Brown's rivals, said there was ``no doubt'' in
his mind that Brown would win.
   To overcome the perception that the incoming chairman is too
liberal, Anderson said Brown must ``establish his independence from
any groups and find us a candidate in four years who will appeal to
the broad base of the electorate.''
   Opponents of the Washington lawyer-lobbyist, who will be the
first black politician to hold the top party post, cited his ties to
Jackson, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Gov. Mario Cuomo as evidence he
would give ammunition to those trying to paint the Democrats as too
liberal.
   ``What does it take to help us win?'' Brown asked rhetorically.
``It doesn't have anything to do with the ideology of the chairman.
(That is) a totally irrelevant consideration.
   ``We have fallen into a trap of allowing our enemies, our
opponents or adversaries to define us. I think it's time for us to
define ourselves and let the American people know what it means to
be a Democrat.''
   He said the party must do a better job defining its positions on
national security, crime and drugs.
   ``We've got to get out of the box of having some people in this
country believe that we are the party that blames America for
everything that's wrong in the world,'' said Brown.
   He said Congress would be the principal shaper of the party
message and that he hoped to participate in leadership discussions
on Capitol Hill.
   Brown described himself as ``one of the several messengers that
have the ability and skills to be a strong advocate.''
   He rejected the advice of many party activists that he must take
some symbolic action to demonstrate his independence.
   ``I don't believe that,'' he said. ``I've passed the test. I've
been judged to be a fair and reasonable and common sense person.
That's why it looks like we're going to have a celebration here in
February instead of a fight.''
   At the same time, he said, ``I am very sensitive to concerns that
people have raised about perception.''
   Brown said he would travel to the South soon ``and go to some
statehouses and meet with governors and Democratic Party leaders to
demonstrate that I want to reach out.''
   In the closing weeks of the campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination, Brown agreed to become convention manager
for Jackson and some party activists are concerned about the
perception that he is a Jackson partisan, a perception he says is
incorrect.
   When asked whether he felt he must do something to demonstrate
independence from Jackson, Brown replied: ``We've got to stop
treating Jesse like some kind of irrational being. He's a
reasonable, rational political figure, political leader.''
   Brown continued: ``I think he understands full well there might
be times the next four years where we disagree on something; where
by the nature of my position and my role and the nature of his
position and his role, it just makes sense that we'd be on different
sides and I don't know that's going to be such a traumatic thing.''

<HEAD>Russian Factory Ship Snaps up Herring Scorned by United States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GLOUCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet factory ship stationed two
miles off the coast has been a boon to local fishermen who find
herring plentiful but buyers scarce. Americans, they say, turn their
noses up at the stuff, but the Russians have a taste for it.
   ``Years ago, every worker went to work with a can of sardines in
his lunch box. Our eating habits have changed,'' said Spencer
Fuller, president of Resource Trading Co., the Portland, Maine,
company that set up the venture with the Russians.
   Americans now eat less herring than ever, according to Robert A.
Hall, who tracks seafood markets for the National Marine Fisheries
Service. In 1936, Americans consumed 1.3 pounds of sardines, or
young herring, per person; in 1987, that had fallen to 0.3 pounds
per person, he said.
   Russians, who figure they won't fill their processing ship here
until April, are the world's biggest herring eaters, followed by the
Eastern bloc countries, West Germany, and Japan.
   The main U.S. market for the adult fish is pickled herring, a
traditional German dish with only a limited following here.
   Making matters worse, a boom in the herring export market turned
to bust. In the mid-1970s, overfishing depleted the herring stock in
the North Sea, Europe's main fishing grounds, and a cheap dollar
boosted demand, increasing the price of New England sea herring to
$150 per ton.
   Then the North Sea herring population rebounded, the dollar rose
in the early 1980s, and the price of herring plunged to about $100
per ton. Canners and processors from Gloucester to Maine closed
their doors.
   ``So what's happening is, the herring stock is growing like mad,
but there's no one taking the fish,'' said Ambrose Alley, a
fisherman based in Vinalhaven, Maine.
   Alley said he is reduced to selling most of his catch for lobster
bait, and the rest as food for zoo animals.
   But lobsters are out of season, and the herring to be caught in
January are 9 to 12 inches long _ too big for seals, whales and
dolphins, Alley said.
   Alley sailed his 42-foot Night Owl to Gloucester last week, and
has already sold 400 tons of herring to the Russian factory ship
Sovetsk for $95 a ton.
   ``It means keeping busy,'' Alley said. ``It means making ends
meet a lot easier.''
   About four boats from Maine and two from Gloucester are fishing
each night, weather permitting, and pumping their catch directly
into the 330-foot factory ship, Alley said. With a crew of 91 men
and three women, the Sovetsk can process and freeze about 80 tons of
herring a day.
   It will also buy 500 tons of frozen herring from Gloucester's two
remaining processing plants, providing an outlet for trawlers that
snare herring while dragging for more profitable species, said Dan
McKiernan of the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, which
approved the Soviet ship's visit.
   The total 4,500-ton haul will be worth about $600,000 to local
fishermen and processing plants, Fuller said. The Soviets are paying
in dollars. ``I don't accept rubles,'' he said.
   Maine has permitted two previous excursions by Soviet factory
ships to process under-fished species.
   The Sovetsk's visit was approved by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in
November after state marine biologists determined that its 4,000-ton
catch would not deplete the herring stock, McKiernan said. Next
summer, an East German ship will be allowed to take 3,500 tons.
   Relations between the fishermen and the Russian crew have been
friendly, said Paul Palino, a fisherman from New Harbor, Maine, who
was invited into the Sovetsk's captain's cabin for a chat, through
an interpreter, and a glass of vodka.
   Fuller said he is trying to obtain visas for the ship's crew so
they can have shore leave in February. He said there is little fear
of defections.
   ``The Poles jump ship like rats, but the Russians, it's a good
berth for them,'' he said. ``They get paid well, and they get to see
the world. ... I'm trying to arrange for them to come ashore to shop
at the malls and be capitalists for a day.''

<HEAD>Walesa: Committed To Agreement In Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A buoyant Lech Walesa predicted Saturday
that authorities will legalize Solidarity next month and that the
union will play a key role in helping the government solve Poland's
economic problems.
   ``I'm convinced Poland needs understanding and first of all
agreement. We are committed to agreement. We must seek agreement ...
to get the situation under control,'' the Solidarity leader said at
a news conference.
   Solidarity officials and top government leaders on Friday set a
Feb. 6 date for long-awaited, broad-based talks on the future of the
banned union and reforms to combat Poland's economic and political
crisis.
   Walesa said Solidarity's aim is to deal with the government, not
usurp it. ``I said it in 1981 and I repeat it now. We don't want to
take over power. We can't. It would be fatal. But we have a deal to
make with this government.''
   He also said the talks, known as ``the round table,'' could help
open the way for other groups that, like Solidarity, do not have
Communist Party approval, to participate in trade union, economic
and political activities.
   ``Today, I'm thinking about our chances, and when I see we are
breaking the monopoly, I'm convinced we have great chances,'' Walesa
said.
   The talks appear to be part of a government attempt to bring the
opposition into the battle against Poland's economic decline, which
has led to chronic shortages, a massive foreign debt and an
apathetic populace.
   The government first proposed the talks in August during a wave
of strikes that marked Poland's worst labor unrest since Solidarity
was crushed in the martial law crackdown of 1981.
   The government banned Solidarity in October 1982, and Walesa
refused to agree to talks until it reinstated the trade union.
   In a dramatic reversal of policy last week, the Communist Party
Central Committee offered to legalize Solidarity if the union agreed
to obey the law and, among other conditions, stop accepting
financial aid from the West.
   Last Sunday, Solidarity's leaderhship agreed to negotiations on
the offer.
   Walesa said the talks should be kept as short as possible.
   ``As far as the round table goes, we have said many times and
repeat it, we want to make it as fast as possible. The tentative
time is six weeks,'' he said. ``But there are terribly difficult and
complicated problems and they can't be solved that quickly.''
   Walesa said he envisioned Solidarity becoming a strong trade
union with good relations with the government.
   ``We cannot say there will be no problems and no accusations,''
he said. ``They will be there, and we can only say we will do
everything to minimize them ... We are not seeking conflicts.
   ``We have to build Poland. We will not solve problems with
strikes.''
   In the past the authorities have accused Solidarity of acting as
a political movement, but Walesa said he was interested only in
developing ``a good trade union.''
   ``It's impossible to be a good trade union in our present
conditions,'' he said. ``We must have economic, legal and political
conditions to be a good union.''

   A man was sentenced to 30 years in prison
early Saturday after being convicted of aggravated kidnapping in the
abduction and gang rape of a woman who was forced to testify under
threat of jail.
   Felipe Chew, 29, was the second to be tried and convicted out of
10 men indicted after the 19-year-old woman reported being abducted
the night of March 26 and later raped by as many as 20 men. The
first was sentenced to 20 years.
   District Attorney Heriberto Silva asked the jury to deny
probation, saying: ``Would you let your daughter go out with him
knowing that? Would you let your sister? Would you invite him over
to your house tomorrow?''
   Chew showed little reaction when the guilty verdict was read
shortly before midnight Friday, after 5{ hours of deliberation, nor
when the jury returned with the 30-year prison sentence and $6,000
fine about 3 a.m. Saturday.
   Court-appointed defense attorney Jaime Garza called the
punishment excessive, and said he expects the verdict to prompt plea
bargains from the remaining eight defendants, all of whom have
pleaded innocent to charges ranging from sexual assault to
kidnapping to aggravated kidnapping.
   ``This is a judgment that for me is hard to digest,'' Garza told
the jurors while asking them to grant probation. ``I am far more
than an advocate. I firmly believe in his innocence.''
   He said the victim voluntarily got into Chew's car with Chew and
three other men on March 26, and offered herself to multiple sex
partners at a ranch where men had gathered for an illegal cockfight.
Garza said she fabricated the kidnapping and rape story out of fear
of her jealous husband.
   ``She got herself into a situation that she could not explain to
her husband, a very rough situation,'' Garza said. ``She took on a
lot of men.''
   The woman testified that Chew forced her to perform oral sex,
helped restrain her and held a light on her while other men raped
her on the hood of a car, and that he caught her when she tried to
escape.
   Two witnesses _ including a 12-year-old boy _ said they saw Chew
holding her down. One man said he saw Chew sexually violate her with
a beer bottle.
   The woman had asked not to testify Tuesday, saying publicity from
the case disrupted her personal life, but she took the stand after
the judge threatened to jail her for contempt of court. On
Wednesday, she was taken from the courthouse to a hospital, but
returned to testify Thursday.
   Since the attack, the woman has moved away from this city of
about 5,200, located in brush country about 85 miles from the
Mexican border, and has been separated from her husband since
October.
   An affidavit from the victim outlined her reasons for not wanting
to testify. She wanted to dismiss the kidnapping case, contending
that to testify again would be too much to endure.
   Defense attorney Garza unsuccessfully sought a mistrial after
learning that the affidavit, discussed outside the jury's presence,
had been taken into the jury room. He said he expects Chew to appeal.
   In September, Orlando Garza, 24, the first to be tried in the
case, was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to 20 years.
Chew also was indicted on a sexual assault charge, and faces an
additional charge for an alleged escape from the Duval County Jail.

   The military plans to ask Britain
to provide maps of recently discovered air defense tunnels built in
Malaysian jungles during World War II, the Bernama news agency
reported Saturday.
   The maps will help search teams trace the entrance to the
tunnels, which were discovered near Ipoh airport, the state agency
said, quoting army officials. Ipoh is 120 miles northwest of the
capital, Kuala Lumpur.
   Maj. Ismail Abdul Jalil said London will be asked to provide
information on other structures found at the site, including an air
raid shelter, a concrete fort and watchtower, a barracks and a
bunker, Bernama said.
   They were found by workers clearing the jungle in a $12 million
project to expand the airport. The government plans to preserve the
area for tourists in this former British colony off the southeast
tip of Asia.

<TEXT>
   Soviet planes today flew in emergency
food and fuel to the embattled capital, and more countries
considered joining the United States in closing their embassies
before the Red Army pulls out.
   The planes flew the emergency supplies to Kabul airport, and
convoys of at least 112 trucks hauled the food and fuel to silos and
gasoline stations, where long lines began forming at dawn.
   Some of the fuel trucks headed up the Salang highway, the only
land route open from Kabul to the Soviet Union. The 250-mile highway
passes through territory controlled by Moslem guerrillas who have
been fighting the Soviet-backed Kabul government the past decade.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a Moslem guerrilla leader charged today
that warplanes from Soviet bases have been bombing dozens of
villages in Afghanistan, causing hundreds of casualties.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, chief of a rebel faction known as
Jamiat-i-Islami, said the planes attacked targets that included
villages along the Salang highway.
   He said the raids on the northern provinces of Takhar and Baghlan
were made by warplanes flying from bases inside the Soviet Union. He
said other areas were hit by bombers from the Soviets' huge Bagram
airbase close to Kabul.
   He called for the United Nations to intervene in an effort to
halt the attacks.
   ``The bombing has been very severe for the last three days,
leaving hundreds of casualties, and destroying dozens of villages,''
he told a news conference through an interpreter.
   Western diplomats reported Thursday that Soviets and the elite
Afghan Special Guard bombed and shelled villages on both ends of the
highway's Salang Tunnel on Jan. 23. They quoted eyewitnesses as
saying that hundreds of civilians were killed in those attacks.
   Shortages have eased since the Soviet food airlift began last
week. But Afghans, many wearing only light cotton clothing and
sandals in the freezing weather, waited stoically in lines for bread
and gasoline.
   The latest airlift came a day after several more non-Communist
nations decided to close their embassies in Afghanistan.
   The first country to close its mission was West Germany a week
ago, but when the United States announced Thursday that it would
soon withdraw its diplomats, Britain, France and Japan followed
suit. Italian diplomats said their government was considering
similar action, and non-Western diplomats said Soviet allies would
probably leave as soon as the Soviet troop withdrawal is completed.
   In New Delhi, the Afghan Embassy said Austria also had decided to
close its mission in Kabul.
   Workers erected steel girders around the Iranian Embassy today,
but there was no immediate word whether Tehran planned to close its
diplomatic mission.
   About 2 million Afghan refugees live in Iran, which shelters and
supports some of the guerrilla groups fighting the Afghan
government. Another 3 million Afghan refugees live in Pakistan,
where a separate alliance of U.S.-supported guerrilla groups is
headquartered.
   The Soviets have said they intend to keep their embassy open, but
it will operate with about 100 staff members _ one-third of what it
was before the withdrawal entered its final stage.
   Two Soviet military transport planes left Kabul today with Soviet
families. Helicopter gunships escorted the planes over the hills
ringing Kabul airport. The planes dropped flares, which are designed
to deflect heat-seeking missiles fired by anti-government guerrillas.
   The U.S. State Department has said its last embassy staff members
would leave Kabul in a few days. Dependents and all but 11 diplomats
and security guards already have departed. In October, the embassy
had a staff of 21 U.S. citizens.
   A non-Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
called the U.S. decision to close the embassy ``all a part of
Washington's maneuvering, trying to show to the world that this
government is on the verge of collapse.''
   The United States has predicted that President Najib's government
will fall from power soon after the Soviet withdrawal is completed.
Moslem guerrillas, who get support from the United States, Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan, have vowed to keep fighting until Najib is
removed.
   Najib's government denounced the decisions to close embassies,
claiming it could provide necessary security even after the Soviets
leave.
   Under an agreement sponsored by the United Nations, the Soviet
Union is to complete the withdrawal of its troops by Feb. 15, ending
the Kremlin's military intervention that started in December 1979 to
prop up its client regime in Kabul.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet troopers were here when the
withdrawal began May 15 and the last 50,000 are to be gone by Feb.
15.
   They leave behind a conscript Afghan army plagued by desertion.
Diplomats say the army has been driven to dragging teen-agers from
their homes and pressing them into service.

   A fire at a Leeds hospital in northern
England early Saturday killed one patient. Police said they suspect
arson.
   Staff at the city's 1,500-bed St. James' Hospital evacuated 40
choking patients from four wards as acrid smoke swirled through a
hospital block.
   The 71-year-old victim is believed to have died from inhaling
smoke. Five of the 40 firemen needed medical treatment after
inhaling the smoke.
   Ian Donnachie, the hospital's general manager, said two fires
broke out shortly after midnight, one at each end of the block.
   West Yorkshire police said an arsonist probably started the fires.
   Donnachie said a nurse raised the alarm after spotting smoke
pouring into the block. He said the fumes funneled up a laundry
chute.
   St. James' is one of Europe's largest teaching hospitals. It is
part of Britain's state-funded National Health Service.

   The capital recorded its driest January on
record, and some city workers spent the month playing cards beside
idle snowplows.
   ``We never had such a warm, dry and snowless January in Oslo and
the surrounding Nordmarka forest area since 1897 when weather began
to be recorded here,'' said spokesman Gustav Bjoerbaek of Oslo's
Meteorological Institute.
   Oslo has had only 0.47 inches of precipitation during the month,
when the normal average is 1.93 inches. Last year it was 5.47
inches. Temperatures which normally hover in the lower 20s have been
in the mid-30s.
   The odd weather has increased poker-playing among city employees,
but it also forced the cancellation of some ski competitions in
eastern Norway.

   More than 300 demonstrators protesting the plight
of the homeless staged a sit-in at the new Washington Convention
Center, and police cited 48 demonstrators for trespassing.
   Demonstrators called their Friday night protest at the $186
million convention center ``Operation Homestead.''
   Police began citing people after they refused to leave the
convention's lower lobby area when the center closed at 8 p.m. The
demonstrators sat in a large circle on the floor, singing and
chanting.
   The 48 who refused to move were cited for criminal trespassing
and released, said police Capt. Jim Deschane.
   John V. Fox, 39, of Seattle, coordinator of the Seattle
Displacement Coalition, said there were about 4,000 homeless people
in Seattle and the number was growing daily.
   ``It is going to be an enormous problem in the future,'' he said.

   Space workers paid silent tribute
today to the seven astronauts who died in the Challenger explosion
three years ago.
   Flags at the Kennedy Space Center were lowered to half-staff at
11:38 a.m., the moment the space shuttle Challenger lifted off
launch pad 39B on Jan. 28, 1986. For 73 seconds, the length of the
fatal flight, all activity stopped as workers remembered the worst
disaster in the history of space exploration.
   Only about 1,000 of the center's 17,000 employees were at work
because of the weekend. Hundreds of visitors touring the space
center also joined in the tribute.
   Most workers were on duty Friday, and they paused briefly to
honor the Challenger crew a day before the anniversary.
   ``We won't forget the sacrifice made by these seven fallen
heroes,'' Forrest S. McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space
Center, told the workers in a brief televised message.
   ``We promised them we'd push on in the years to come, to fly the
space shuttle again, to continue the exploration of space as they
wanted us to,'' he said. ``We're fulfilling that promise.''
   Meanwhile, peace activists were gathering at a public park for a
demonstration this afternoon at the space center. Bruce Gagnon of
Orlando, the organizer, said the group will rally outside a center
gate to protest the launch of Defense Department payloads aboard the
shuttle.
   Discovery, which made the first post-Challenger flight last
September, is being readied to return to orbit in late February, the
first of seven flights planned in 1989. The target date is Feb. 23,
but preparations are behind schedule and officials expect a
postponement of at least two or three days.
   The launch could be pushed into March or later if engineers don't
learn soon why cracks developed in a main engine turbopump during
Atlantis' liftoff in December. Until the problem is resolved, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration will not clear
Discovery for launch. Shuttle managers were to assess the problem
over the weekend.

   The activities coordinator at Escambia
County Nursing Home is a clown.
   So is a professor of social work at the University of West
Florida.
   Ditto for one of the university's statistical research
assistants, a retired Navy officer and a couple of preschool
teachers in this Florida Panhandle city.
   They are among thousands of Americans who clown around in their
spare time.
   ``There's a little bit of clown in all of us. You just have to
bring it out,'' said Martha Morgan, a Montessori teacher who becomes
``Mo'' when she puts on her clown makeup.
   About 20 years ago, clowns were seldom seen outside circuses, and
even circus clowns were a dying breed.
   Then the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus established
its Clown College in Sarasota. Growth in clowning of all sorts has
been explosive.
   ``Our membership now is over 4,000,'' said Hunter ``Mr. Boots''
Stevens of West Bend, Wis., a director and past president of Clowns
of America. He said membership growns 600 or more a year.
   Janet ``Jelly Bean'' Tucker of Hammond, Ind., said some are
trying to lighten up their lives because they have straight-laced
occupations. She cited a funeral director as one example.
   ``I can't count the number of people who I have taught to clown
who quit seeing their psychiatrists,'' she said. ``When you clown,
it's the real you that comes out.''

   When the co-owner of Colorado Industrial Saw and
Carbide opened an envelope from the local utility, she spotted a
check for nearly $60,000.
   But it turned out to be fool's gold, and Public Service Co. of
Colorado told Karen Hudson ``to please not cash it, and to not think
about vacation plans.''
   Ms. Hudson and her husband, Dana, own the saw-sharpening shop,
and sometimes do work on PSC equipment. But they knew Friday when
they saw the check for $59,287.54 that this wasn't just another
payment.
   ``I knew that those Public Service bills are awful high. I
thought maybe they were sending me a refund,'' Ms. Hudson said,
tongue firmly in cheek.
   Ms. Hudson said it turned out her company's vendor number is the
same as another PSC customer's purchase order number.
   ``It was one of those one-in-a-million things that happens,''
said utility spokeswoman Peggy Morton. ``It was a small department
that handles about 16,000 payments a month. They were rushed at the
end of the month, so I guess they got a couple of numbers
transposed.''

   Rival Shiite Moslem militiamen fought a
90-minute gunbattle in the city's southern slums today, and Iran's
foreign minister flew to Syria in a bid to reach a peace accord
between the two groups.
   Police said one person was killed and three were wounded when the
Syrian-backed mainstream Amal militia and pro-Iranian fundamentalist
Hezbollah clashed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in
the early morning.
   Syrian troops in charge of security in Beirut's Moslem sector
enforced a truce.
   A car bomb in the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon wounded a
Syrian soldier and five Lebanese civilians, said a police spokesman.
   The bomb-laden car exploded this morning near the town of Barr
Elias. Victims were hospitalized in nearby Zahleh city, 25 miles
east of Beirut, the police spokesman said.
   Beirut's Voice of Lebanon radio reported 50 casualties in the
blast but gave no breakdown. Police denied that casualty figure.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   In a separate attack, a bomb at the entrance to a building in
Moslem west Beirut exploded later today, wounding six people, a
police spokesman said.
   The victims were rushed to a nearby hospital, the spokesman said
on condition of anonymity. No other details were immediately
available.
   The car bombing was the second in Lebanon this year. One on Jan.
13 killed seven people and wounded 15 in Beirut's Bir el-Abed suburb.
   Twenty such explosions last year killed 116 people and wounded
448 by police count.
   The new casualties in the militia fighting increased the toll to
173 killed and 340 wounded since the latest round of inter-Shiite
fighting broke out in Beirut on Dec. 31 and spread to south Lebanon.
   In Tehran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
that Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati left for Damascus to resume
talks on the inter-Shiite power struggle that has dragged on for
nine months.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Velayati as saying he
hoped this time to ``establish a comprehensive accord between the
groups with the cooperation of Syria and political and religious
personalities in Lebanon.''
   Velayati earlier in the week held several meetings with his
Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Sharaa, and Hezbollah officials in
Damascus. But no settlement was reached.
   Amal and Hezbollah are vying to dominate the 1 million Shiites
who are Lebanon's largest single sect.
   Clashes in April, May and November last year killed more than 500
people and wounded 1,500.
   Hezbollah wants to establish an Islamic republic patterned after
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolution.
   The more secular Amal resents Iran's influence and wants a
coalition government, including the Christians who traditionally
have dominated Lebanese politics.
   Syria has about 40,000 troops in the Moslem sector of Beirut and
in the eastern and northern provinces. It is seeking to end the
country's nearly 14-year-old civil war.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Said To Be Preparing Big Assault</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels are preparing assaults on
major military targets following the government's rejection of their
offer to participate in elections, according to official and
guerrilla sources.
   President Bush's new administration, meanwhile, is trying to
persuade Salvadoran leaders to soften their negative response to the
revolutionaries.
   The Marxist-led insurgents, who condemned and did all they could
to frustrate five national elections since 1980, offered Tuesday to
take part in this year's presidential balloting under certain
conditions.
   ``We have made a proposal. To the degree that the other side does
not respond positively, the masses see that the struggle must
continue ... The tendency toward violence is increasing,'' guerrilla
commander Ana Guadalupe Martinez told reporters in Mexico City.
   The proposal has caused intense debate in El Salvador and
Washington, which has given more than $3 billion in aid to El
Salvador. The country is the most favored recipient of U.S. funds in
the Western Hemisphere this decade.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte said Wednesday of the guerrilla
document: ``This is not a proposal for peace. It is a proposal for
war.''
   It was ``plagued with unconstitutionalities,'' he said, foremost
among them the guerrillas' demand that he postpone the elections
from March 19 to September to allow for reforms and their
participation. He also cited ``threats to aggravate the conflict''
if the proposal were rejected.
   ``We are preparing for a very strong military reaction,'' a
high-ranking army officer told The Associated Press. He said
military intelligence believes the rebels in the next two weeks will
hit at least one important strategic target, probably in the capital.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged
the elections proposal enhanced an image of rebel willingness to
pursue peace.
   That also is the consensus among diplomats. Even government
officials grudgingly admit it.
   But Duarte's government considers the guerrilla document tactical
and insincere. ``A pretense to intensify violence,'' was how the
official Sisal news agency described it.
   Ms. Martinez, in interviews taped in Mexico and broadcast in El
Salvador, indicated the rebels had little hope their proposal would
be accepted by the incumbent Christian Democrats or the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   The alliance, known as Arena, controls the legislature and leads
presidential polls. The leftist Democratic Convergence is a distant
third.
   Arena leaders rejected the rebel proposal out of hand as ``a
trap'' and ``a siren's song.''
   The guerrillas said they would back the Convergence in an
election. In the past, rebels denounced elections as a
``U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan.''
   A source close to the guerrillas said the proposal is legitimate,
but that it also is designed ``to underscore contradictions. It
shows the Christian Democrats and Arena for what they are, that they
are more interested in power than democracy and peace.''
   Major rebel attacks are imminent, he said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman on Thursday sought to
play down Duarte's rejection of key elements of the proposal. In
comments to Washington reporters, he emphasized Duarte's positive
assessment of the rebels' recognition of electoral legitimacy.
   ``Any proposal such as this is worthy of serious and substantive
consideration,'' said Redman.
   A Western diplomat in San Salvador said the Bush administration
is trying soften Duarte's emphatic rejection.
   ``It's hard to convince the American Congress and people that
there's a serious government and business class here when in less
than 24 hours they come out with a flat-out `no' to a significant
proposal,'' he said.
   A labor and farmworkers' union linked to the Christian Democrats
called Thursday for a plebiscite on the plan.
   Guillermo Ungo, the Convergence presidential candidate, told a
news conference Thursday, ``I ask myself what the mothers of the
tens of thousands of soldiers and guerrillas think of the
government's rejection of a proposal that could be an important step
toward peace.''
   Two radio stations on Thursday asked listeners to air their views
on the insurgent proposals. They fielded calls from 158 people.
   Eighty in the informal and unscientific survey expressed support
for the rebel proposal, while 78 said it should be rejected.

   The ghost of a man deposed three times
by the military is riding the campaign trail as Panama's opposition
tries again to defeat Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and bring civilian
rule to this country.
   ``It is going to be the people against the military,'' said
Guillermo Endara, 52, who is running for president under the banner
of a coalition formed in memory of the late Arnulfo Arias Madrid.
   The elections are scheduled for May 7.
   The government candidate, to be selected shortly, will be backed
by the resources of Noriega, head of Panama's military.
   In traditional Panamanian fashion, the Arias legacy is claimed by
several political factions, anti- and pro-government.
   Arias died in August at age 86, and his burial brought forth the
largest public demonstration ever of loyalty to a Panamanian
politician.
   Some of the opposition's leaders have been expelled from the
country, and the Endara coalition is counting on Arias' popularity
and the appeal of his widow, Mireya, for a strong showing in the
elections.
   Politicians and others interviewed last week by The Associated
Press said a ticket led by Endara, a former Arias collaborator, is
not the best strategy for victory. But they hope to turn the
elections into a referendum on Noriega.
   On the ticket as candidates for Panama's two vice presidential
posts are Ricardo Arias Calderon of the small but well-organized
Christian Democrat Party and Guillermo Ford of the Liberal
Republican Movement.
   ``We do not have any illusion about the elections, but they will
be another chance for the people to show their rejection of the
military regime,'' said Carlos Valencia, president of the
Industrialists Association and a member of the Civic Crusade, an
organization of civic and independent business groups.
   The military closed the offices of the Industrialists'
Association seven months ago. News media favorable to the opposition
were closed early last year.
   Opposition leaders say privately they do not expect Noriega to
surrender power if his supporters lose the elections.
   But they hope ``a political event will happen that will bring us
closer to democracy,'' said one politician, who requested anonymity.
``Maybe they will postpone the elections or Noriega will be
overthrown by other military.''
   Noriega has survived more than a year of U.S. attempts to
overthrow him, including an indictment on federal drug-related
charges in Florida and sanctions that have battered Panama's economy.
   He broke a general strike, crushed public demonstrations and
presented himself in this country and abroad as a defender of
Panamanian sovereignty.
   Noriega says the United States wants him out to make it easier
for it to renege on the Panama Canal treaties, which call for U.S.
forces to leave in the year 2000.
   He has been in command since 1983 and could run for president as
a civilian. But it is believed Noriega will back a civilian from the
government's Revolutionary Democratic Party.
   Since taking over, Noriega has deposed three presidents; he
installed the current president, Manuel Solis Palma, in February
last year.
   Noriega was in charge in 1984 when, in the first presidential
election in 16 years, Arias lost a close election tainted by charges
of fraud.
   Arias was overthrown by the military in 1941 after one year in
power, in 1948 after almost two years and in 1968 after 11 days.
   Endara and his group were expelled from Arias's Authentic
Panamanian Party by another faction that now is expected to field
its own opposition candidate.
   ``They (the opposition) will be divided again,'' said Tomas
Altamirano Duque, editor of the newspaper La Estrella and a
government party congressman.
   The government is confident it will win the elections, he said.

Saturday.
   The South Korean patrols followed the Finik Class vessel Friday
as it passed through the straits between Korea and Japan, said a
spokesman who by custom is not identified by name.
   No details were available of the ship's possible mission or

   More than 4,000 miners died in 1988, the worst
year for mine disasters in communist China's history, an official
newspaper said Saturday.
   Quoting from the China Labor and Personnel Journal, China Daily
said fatalities doubled from 1987, when about 2,200 people died in
mine accidents.
   It did not give specific numbers and the Labor Ministry does not
disclose casualties in mine accidents.
   The newspaper said that in November alone at least 477 miners
died in accidents, and 65 percent of the accidents were caused by
gas explosions.
   China is the world's largest producer of coal, but only half the
nation's coal mines are mechanized.
   Most accidents occur in the small operations run privately or by
rural collectives that ignore safety regulations or cannot afford to
implement them.

<HEAD>Death Row Inmates Had Mixed Feelings About Bundy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STARKE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ted Bundy was well-liked by many fellow death
row inmates, but some believed that his death might paradoxically be
a good thing for them, two of Bundy's former inmate neighbors say.
   James Doug McCray, who has been on death row for 14 years, said
some Florida State Prison inmates expressed hope that Bundy's death
last Tuesday would satisfy a public desire for executions and cause
support for the death penalty to recede.
   ``I think over the years with the `Kill Bundy' syndrome, I think
what has developed on death row is sort of a belief that if Bundy
were dead, then a great number of us would have a chance to live
because of society's misconceptions that we were a death row of Ted
Bundys,'' McCray told the Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville for an
article published Saturday.
   Another inmate once housed next to Bundy, Michael Bruno, said
there were varied opinions about Bundy's fate.
   ``A lot of people didn't like him. A lot of people thought he was
all right,'' said Bruno, who has been on death row since October
1987. ``Really, when it comes to sex crimes _ toward women and
children _ it's not looked good upon by other inmates.''
   Bundy, 42, was executed for the February 1978 murder of
12-year-old Kimberly Leach of Lake City. He was also sentenced to
death for two other murders in Florida, and authorities say he
confessed in his last week to more than 20 murders in other states.
In all, Bundy is a suspect in more than 100 murders and
disappearances.
   Both Bruno and McCray said they liked Bundy and enjoyed living in
cells next to him. McCray said he lived next to Bundy for about two
years. Bruno said he was housed next to Bundy for six months.
   Bruno, 37, said he and Bundy would play handball together in the
prison exercise yard, and Bundy always was respectful to Bruno's
relatives when they came to visit.
   Although the inmates never discussed Bundy's cases with him,
McCray and Bruno said they were surprised to hear him confess to
being a killer during an interview taped shortly before his
execution. By that time, Bundy had been moved to another area of the
prison.
   ``I find it hard to believe _ it's not the same Ted Bundy,''
Bruno said. ``Even when he started confessing to all these things, I
couldn't believe it.''
   McCray, 39, who was sentenced for the rape and murder of a
64-year-old woman in 1973, said he would talk into the early hours
of the morning with Bundy and found him to be witty and bright
rather than the killer he confessed to be in his final days.
   ``The Ted Bundy I knew here at FSP (Florida State Prison) for 11
years was not that person that committed those crimes,'' McCray
said. ``I never viewed Ted as a seething psychopath.''
   Bundy, who once attended law school and worked for the Republican
Party in Washington state, was sometimes harassed verbally by other
inmates, many of whom are black and poor, McCray said.
   ``Black men viewed Ted as being a disciple of the system, the
very system which we are fighting, because he had grown up with all
of the advantages,'' McCray said. ``Therefore, a grotesque form of
resentment occurred.''

   The jury in the Joel Steinberg murder trial
reviewed testimony about the fatal beating of his 6-year-old
daughter and gave indications that deliberations could stretch into
a second week.
   On Friday, the jury asked to review testimony that could help
them judge whether Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's former live-in
companion, was physically capable of causing the injuries that
killed Lisa Steinberg.
   It was the sixth note from the jury since it began deliberations
around midday Monday. The jury retired at 8 p.m. Friday and resumed
deliberations at 11:40 a.m. today.
   Indications were that the jury was far from a verdict. On
Thursday, the sequestered jurors asked the judge to allow relatives
to bring them changes of clothing for several days. On Friday,
several jurors inquired about weekend religious services. Others
told employers that they might not be at work on Monday.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred lawyer, was charged with murder for
allegedly fatally beating Lisa, whom he illegally adopted from an
unwed mother. Lisa was removed comatose from Steinberg's Greenwich
Village apartment Nov. 2, 1987, and died of a brain injury three
days later.
   The defense claims the girl was beaten by Ms. Nussbaum, 46.
   Prosecutors responded that Ms. Nussbaum, who testified against
Steinberg and was not charged, was herself too badly battered and
emotionally disabled to have beaten the child.
   The case has focused national attention on the duty and ability
of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report
evidence of child abuse.

   Laos and the United States held a
``cordial'' two-day meeting on the fate of 547 Americans still
listed as missing in action in Laos, a U.S. Embassy official said
Saturday.
   Harriet Isom, charge d'affaires of the American Embassy in Laos,
declined to disclose details in a telephone interview from Bangkok.
   The meeting ended Friday, she said.
   Earlier, Laos state radio said the two sides would discuss their
first annual plan to resolve the MIA issue and the provision of U.S.
humanitarian aid to the Southeast Asian nation.
   The United States over the past two years has provided more food
and medical aid to Laos, and the Vientiane government has
significantly increased cooperation in searching for the missing,
allowing several joint searches of wartime crash sites.
   Those efforts were criticized Friday by former North Carolina
Rep. William M. Hendon, who said ``everything the government has
tried has not for one reason or another succeeded'' in bringing out
American prisoners he believes still are alive in Indochina. A total
of 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA from wars in Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia.
   Hendon, of McLean, Va., is traveling this weekend to Thailand's
Mekong River boundary with Laos to continue publicizing a $2.5
million reward offered by 21 congressmen to any Indochinese who
returns a POW to American custody.
   ``The word is getting in there. We are doing our best to find an
honorable solution to a very difficult situation,'' he told
reporters.
   ``Tons of intelligence'' indicated that live Americans still are
held in Indochina, but excavating crash sites was not the way to go
about extricating them, said Hendon, who heads the private POW
Publicity Fund.
   Hendon said the United States was ``very close'' in 1983 to
getting POWs back, following a mission authorized by the White House
during which he helped bring $225,000 worth of medicine to Laos in
exchange for live Americans.
   The mission failed, Hendon claimed, because public exposures of
clandestine activities in Iran and Central America forced the
administration to abort such dealings around the world. The U.S.
government has criticized private groups' illegal forays into Laos
in search of POWs.
   Before the talks, the U.S. Defense Department said the meetings
would involve scheduling surveys and excavations following a January
agreement to establish ``a year-round POW-MIA work plan.''
   Ms. Isom led the American delegation, which included technical
experts from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the U.S.
Army Central Identification Laboratory.

   Followers of political cult leader Lyndon
H. LaRouche Jr. say they will hold a round-the-clock vigil near the
White House until he is released from federal prison. Government
lawyers say that won't happen for at least five years.
   LaRouche, 66, a three-time presidential fringe candidate, was
sentenced Friday to 15 years for scheming to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service and deliberately failing to repay loans from his
political supporters.
   Evidence showed LaRouche's fund-raising activities produced more
than $30 million and that he failed to repay $294,000 in such loans.
   He could have received a maximum of 65 years in prison and fines
totaling $3.25 million for his conviction on 13 counts of tax and
mail fraud and conspiracy.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham says LaRouche will serve a
minimum of five years in a yet-undecided prison before he is
eligible for parole.
   LaRouche and six associates were transferred in handcuffs from
U.S. District Court to the city jail in this Washington suburb
before being assigned permanently to a federal prison.
   The six associates received lesser penalties, ranging from three
to five years' imprisonment and fines of $6,000 to $11,000, for
their roles in the fund-raising scheme.
   LaRouche was convicted by a federal trial jury Dec. 16 on all 13
counts of an indictment charging him with tax and mail fraud
conspiracy. It was his first criminal conviction in a long and
controversial political career.
   While Chief U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. was imposing
sentences Friday, government prosecutors dropped all charges in a
related case in Boston against LaRouche, six aides and five
political organizations.
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Boston said that case, involving
allegations that LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign raised more
than $2 million through credit card and loan fraud, was being
abandoned because of the successful prosecution in Alexandria.
   LaRouche attorney Odin Anderson said all seven defendants are
appealing. Bryan denied their request Friday to be released on bail
pending the outcome of their appeals.
   Before his sentencing, LaRouche told the judge that ``in effect I
was consigned to hell'' because he had rejected a deal offered by
high-level figures in ``the Anglo-American liberal establishment''
with an implicit promise of lenient treatment in court.
   LaRouche did not say what the alleged deal involved, but said it
underscored his belief that government prosecutors were seeking to
``eliminate me from the political scene.''
   Bryan snapped that claims of political motivation behind the case
were ``arrant nonsense.'' But LaRouche said it was ``time for this
evil and reckless prosecution to be brought to a halt before further
damage is done'' to U.S. national security interests.
   The judge said he was bothered that none of the defendants had
conceded wrongdoing or expressed remorse over the millions of
dollars in defaulted loans they took from LaRouche supporters, many
of them elderly retirees whose life savings were lost.
   One of the seven defendants, LaRouche legal coordinator Edward
Spannaus, said that ``remorse should be felt by those who perverted
our judicial system for political purposes and trampled on the
Constitution.''
   LaRouche spokeswoman Dana Scanlon said a small group of
demonstrators had begun a nonstop vigil in Lafayette Park, across
Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, with a large, illuminated
sign reading ``Pardon LaRouche.'' She said the sign will be within
President Bush's view from the White House.
   In Mexico City on Friday, about a dozen LaRouche supporters held
a protest march in front of the Monument of Independence, also known
as the angel. They carried signs that read ``LaRouche is Innocent.''

   At one end of the exhibit hall, the video image of
former CBS News President Van Gordon Sauter soundlessly hawks
``Hotline,'' a glittery new game show that home viewers can play by
telephone.
   At the other end, 72-year-old retired Pennsylvania butcher Frank
Maturo makes Bloody Marys for passersby while his son tries to sell
their 60-second show, ``Your Minute Message on Meat.''
   What both booths at the annual convention of the National
Association of Programming Executives have in common is few buyers.
   They sat next to Joan Rivers and had their pictures taken, but
most station representatives had already committed themselves to
syndication hits such as King World's ``Wheel of Fortune'' or
Tribune Entertainment's ``Geraldo!'' and had little space on their
schedules for anything new.
   The annual NATPE convention, a syndicated television bazaar,
typically features more tackiness than trading. But this year's
convention reflected a downturn in an industry battling cable and
video alternatives.
   Still, the exhibit floor of the George Brown Convention Center
provided a sensory overload of lights, glamour and glitter. There
were celebrities, showgirls, life-size cartoon characters and live
animals, including a giant albino python helping pitch a program
called ``Monty's Traveling Reptile Show.''
   ``This is a shopping mall from hell,'' said Ron Powers, the
former ``CBS Sunday Morning'' media critic here on assignment for GQ
Magazine.
   Despite the state of the industry, NATPE had more than 7,300
participants, down only slightly from the 7,500 of last year.
   ``It was not a good year for both the buyer and seller. But what
did happen here, it's a chance to get together and cry in each
other's beer, so to speak,'' said NATPE President Phil Corvo.
   ``I would say it's somewhat more subdued in the last year or
two,'' said Norman Horowitz, president of MGM@UA Telecommunications
Inc., which was offering ``Hotline,'' the game show produced by
Sauter's company. ``Cable is taking a big bite out of ...
broadcasting. Video is taking a big bite out of ... everybody, so
that it is somewhat subdued. But it's a business with a lot of money
involved and a lot of people are going for it in whatever means
available to them _ glitzy booths, glitzy presentations. ... Last
year, with `Group One Medical,' we did a cholesterol test, and it
was a knockout.''
   ``Group One Medical'' was one of a wave of ``reality-based''
shows offered last year that did not make it through the season.
   ``The talk on the floor is that buyers are very apprehensive this
year because last year they got burned by `USA Today,''' said David
Sams, co-executive producer of ``Rollergames,'' one of the few new
shows drawing any interest this year.
   Last year's convention was abuzz over GTG Entertainment's $40
million seeming sure thing, ``USA Today: The Television Show,'' a
daily newsmagazine. But the critics rejected it, and the ratings
were disappointing. Many stations have dropped or moved the show.
   Reality shows continued to be the order of the day. The only new
genre seemed to be so-called ``crash TV,'' prompted by the success
of syndicated wrestling shows.
   ``American Gladiators'' at least offered a peek at its stars,
male and female athletes who will take on competitors in a series of
``trash-sport'' events. ``Rollergames'' had only a brief video clip
and a slick brochure that promised a combination of Roller Derby and
MTV.
   The pitch seemed to be working. Sams said his sales had climbed
from 57 percent of the country before the convention to about 75
percent.
   ``It's all about hitting a nerve,'' he said. ``It's all about
capturing attention.''
   Corvo predicted that syndication will suffer another down year
but rebound in 1990-91 when contracts are up and stations are
looking to replace programming.
   Over at the ``Your Minute Message on Meat'' booth, Frank Maturo's
meat-buying tips played incessantly on a monitor in the background
while son Sam tried to sell the spots _ and gave thanks they weren't
next to this year's cholesterol-test booth.
   ``We've been getting a lot of traffic,'' Sam Maturo said. ``I
don't think it's been a wasted trip. Trying to get into the larger
markets is tough. These people have to be sold.''

   Officials suspended municipal voting
today at scores of polling places around the country during an
outbreak in political violence that killed six people and injured
about 200, authorities said.
   Authorities had deployed 15,000 police and village guards to
protect polling stations in today's vote for 80 municipal councils,
Interior Ministry officials said.
   The officials said the mobilization came in response to campaign
violence that had already killed one person and injured 200 late
this week.
   A police official in Daka, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said at least five persons were killed and about 200 injured in
today's clashes involving police and rival candidates for some of
the 80 town councils.
   Another police officer in the southern town of Mongla said
clashes between groups of rival supporters left another person dead.
   Polling was suspended in scores of centers because of violence
and voting irregularities, said an election officer also speaking on
condition of anonymity. The officer said he did not know the precise
number of polling stations where voting was called off.
   Election officials could not give the voter turnout, but more
than 2 million people were eligible to vote for the 80 councils.
Voting in six towns was postponed by the election Commission because
of disputes over voting procedures and boundaries.
   Campaign marches and rallies were banned Friday night in
accordance with election tradition.
   Election commission sources said 388 candidates were running as
chairmen of the 80 councils and 3,000 others were contesting the
remaining 798 council seats. The councils serve three years, said
Abdus Salam, the election commission secretary.

<HEAD>U.S. Experts Criticize Germany For Lax Chemical Weapons Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. defense experts lashed out at
West Germany on Saturday, accusing the Bonn leadership of ``benign
neglect'' of chemical weapons controls and a cavalier attitude
toward its NATO responsibilities.
   The charges came during an annual conference for NATO military
strategists.
   The meeting opened with a cautious speech by Defense Minister
Rupert Scholz in which he gave only a hesitant endorsement to NATO
plans to extend the range of some European-based nuclear missiles.
   Scholz was attempting to straddle the fence between the U.S.
position that short-range missile ``modernization'' is necessary to
protect long-standing NATO defense strategies and the broadly held
view among West Germans that missile replacement is unnecessary
because of improving East-West relations.
   But his choice of a middle road was criticized by opponents and
supporters of modernization and was followed by harsh criticism of
West Germany's behavior in a scandal involving a suspected Libyan
chemical weapons plant.
   American charges that West German companies helped build the
plant in Libya have created serious tensions between the two NATO
partners.
   U.S. Sen. John S. McCain, R-Ariz., criticized Scholz and the
government for ``turning a blind eye'' to indications which he said
have long linked West German companies to efforts by Libya and Iraqi
to produce chemical weapons.
   ``I know the West German government is denying what went on in
Libya and the foreign minister is claiming to be shocked,'' McCain
told the gathering of 171 defense experts. ``But it seems
increasingly apparent that the West German government has been
denying what it has long known to be the truth.''
   McCain cast doubt on Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher's
claim that he knew nothing of the alleged West German role in the
Libyan plant until November and declared: ``We cannot tolerate
benign neglect.''
   West Germans were visibly stung by McCain's words, uniting across
party lines to deflect the criticism.
   Egon Bahr, arms control expert for the opposition Social
Democratic Party, said he was ``firmly convinced'' Bonn was doing
its utmost to investigate claims of wrongdoing by West German
companies.
   Scholz denied he or other Cabinet members had ignored warnings.
   A month ago, Scholz became embroiled in a major political
controversy in Bonn for saying modernization was probably inevitable.
   He put himself in for further criticism on Saturday by making
only one oblique reference to the issue in his speech, stating that
short-range nuclear missiles ``must be kept modern.''
   The 1983 NATO decision to refit existing short-range nuclear
missiles to extend their range beyond the limit of 300 miles is
increasingly unpopular among Europeans who believe that could block
further arms control progress.
   The opening day of the weekend conference churned up a debate on
the missile replacement proposal and other points of contention
among the 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Discussion was entirely dominated by the U.S.-West German
differences, with speeches by the foreign ministers of Britain,
Turkey and Italy largely ignored.
   Scholz gave American critics an opening by claiming an imbalance
within the alliance that exposes West Germany and other central
Europeans to greater risk than the North American member nations.
   Alfred Dregger, parliamentary leader of Kohl's Christian
Democratic Party, told the Americans that alliance burdens are ``not
just a matter of dollars.''
   Dregger and Social Democrat Karsten Voigt lamented the burdens of
hosting NATO missiles and maneuvers, including low-flying fighter
jet practices which have led to numerous accidents in their densely
populated country.
   The complaints prompted accusations from American participants
that Europeans have not been pulling their financial weight.
   Edward Luttwak of Georgetown University told the gathering that
``in the last 20 years other people have been living inside the
house of strategic security without paying the rent.''
   U.S. Sen. Warren Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican, accused
Scholz of wanting ``to have it both ways,'' in being skeptical of
Soviet disarmament overtures but sensitive to public opinion that
the Kremlin under Mikhail Gorbachev poses less of a threat to the
NATO alliance.
   Rudman said the United States devotes up to 60 percent of its
defense budget to NATO-related defense and said the huge federal
deficit facing the Bush administration mandates a more equitable
spread of the expense.
   John Tower, the U.S. Defense Secretary-designate, took no part in
the discussion. He was scheduled to speak Sunday.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, warned that ``rapidly changing views of
the German people'' pose a serious threat to NATO and called on the
Bonn leadership to ``address this problem.''
   He referred to recent polls showing that most West Germans sense
no serious threat from the East bloc, and 80 percent support for
removal of all nuclear weapons from Europe.
   The annual Munich conference, known as the Wehrkunde, brings
together military experts from all NATO countries for discussions on
strategy. This year's topic is ``Alliances in a Changing World.''

<HEAD>Impact on Health Programs Seen in Row Over Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Plans to place staunch pro-lifers in top posts
at the Health and Human Services Department could have deep impact
on family planning, fetal research and other key programs, say
activists on the abortion issue.
   ``Just about any abortion issue that has to do with the medical
delivery system will touch HHS in some fashion,'' Douglas Johnson of
the National Right to Life Committee said last week following an
agreement to ensure strong pro-life representation in the
department's top echelons.
   The agreement from the administration came in response to concern
among pro-life lawmakers that President Bush's nominee for HHS
secretary, Dr. Louis Sullivan, could be lacking in anti-abortion
fervor.
   ``There's no office aside from the presidency that's more
influential in advancing the right-to-life agenda,'' said Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., an fervent advocate of outlawing abortion.
   Humphrey, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn.,
struck a deal last week with the White House: They would agree to
Sullivan's nomination and Bush would fill other top slots at the
agency with pro-lifers.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu later announced that
Sullivan had recommended Constance J. Horner, head of the Office of
Personnel Management, as HHS undersecretary.
   James O. Mason, director of the Centers for Disease Control, was
Sullivan's choice fpr assistant secretary for health, a position
that oversees the National Institutes of Health, among other
agencies.
   Both are well known as foes of abortion, Sununu said.
   Administration sources also said Kay James, a former spokeswoman
for the National Right to Life Committee, has been recommended for
assistant secretary for public affairs.
   All three would be in positions to make and influence policy.
While Congress defines the broad outlines, its dictates on complex
health issues usually leave the department with ample room to
maneuver in enforcing the law and making rules and regulations.
   The system puts considerable power in the hands of department
officials.
   Concern among activists over the key positions is sharper than
usual because the Surpreme Court recently agreed to hear a case that
could narrow the legalization of abortion it decreed in the landmark
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   Sullivan, himself, was stung last week when one lawmaker quoted
the prospective secretary as saying he opposed overturning the Roe
vs. Wade ruling. A Capitol Hill flareup ensued, but Sullivan quickly
quelled the turmoil by meeting with with anti-abortion lawmakers and
assured them he supported Bush's pro-life position.
   Sullivan's nomination already had raised concerns of
anti-abortion activists earlier when he was quoted in a newspaper
article as saying he opposed abortion and he favored a woman's right
to choose. Later, he said he supported Bush's view that abortion
should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest and danger to the
life of the mother.
   Pro-choice forces say that even in the Reagan administration,
with ties to the anti-abortion movement, there have usually been at
least some restraints.
   Jo Ann Gasper, an abortion foe, was fired as deputy assistant
secretary for population affairs in 1987 when she tried to block
federal funds for Planned Parenthood family planning programs on
grounds the organization also advocates abortion.
   ``That shows the possibilities and the limitations,'' said Nancy
Broff, legislative and political director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League. ``It shows that people at that level have a
fair amount (of power) to do good or do harm, because the secretary
can't make every decision. But it also shows there can be some
limits on what they can get away with.''
   Those family planning grants are still an important issue at HHS.
After the Gasper firing, the department rewrote the guidelines for
the $138 million in grants to deny funding to programs that include
abortion counseling and referral in their services.
   Three lawsuits have been filed challenging the regulations. Two
federal courts have ruled against the regulations, one has ruled in
favor and appeals have been filed in all three cases.
   Abortions are covered by the Medicaid program, the federal-state
insurance program for the poor that is administered by HHS, only if
the life of the mother is in danger _ a relatively rare occurence.
In fiscal year 1988, federal Medicaid funds covered 84 abortions, at
a cost of $61,235, HHS said.
   An estimated 1.5 million legal abortions are performed each year.
   Abortion foes say that though Congress has restricted Medicaid
funding of abortions for the past 10 years, HHS administrators have
some discretion in deciding whether to allow coverage in their
case-by-case reviews.

<HEAD>Children Used In Train Robbery Ring, Authorities Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They may not rank with Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid, but authorities say they've uncovered perhaps the
youngest group of train robbers _ a ring involving 42 children
between the ages of 9 and 18.
   Gadsden County officials said Friday they had identified the
children and six adults from the Panhandle community of
Chattahoochee accused of robbing idle boxcars of everything from hog
livers to car tires.
   ``The thefts mainly took place after school and during
vacations,'' said Deputy Jimmy Hindman. ``Once the adults showed the
kids what to do, it became easy for them.''
   Only five or six people had been arrested by Saturday, said Maj.
A.J. Pickels, a spokesman for the county sheriff's department.
   Pickels said the ring had been in operation since September and
was responsible for an undetermined amount of stolen merchandise.
   ``What you've got is a few adults who were ringleaders and they
were using the young people, and they were reaping plenty of
benefits,'' Pickels said.
   Jewelry, clothes, cases of designer tennis shoes, leather hats,
car tires, beer, wine, fruit juices, 130 cases of sardines, cases of
frozen pork chops and at least 150 pounds of hog livers were stolen,
he said.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Pickels said. ``I think they were just
using it for their personal use, giving it to their friends or
selling it to their friends.''
   Hindman told the Gadsden County Times that cases of beer were
sold for $4 or $5 and wine went for as little as $1 a gallon.
   Children told authorities they burglarized boxcars parked on
sidings while workers repaired tracks betwen Chattahoochee and
Quincy, police said.
   Authorities aren't sure how widespread the thefts have been since
it takes railroad officials several weeks to learn if shipments have
reached their destinations intact.
   ``We'll probably bring it to a head next week sometime,'' said
Pickels, who predicted there could be more people involved than the
ones already identified.

<TEXT>
   The foreign minister has written to
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker proposing the two men confer on
how to prevent Libya from producing chemical weapons, the ministry
said Saturday.
   News of the letter comes amid U.S. accusations that West German
leaders looked the other way while German companies helped Libya
build a chemical plant allegedly capable of producing poison gas.
   West German leaders deny they ignored American charges that
German firms were involved in the Libyan plant and point out that
prosecutors are investigating a number of companies believed linked
to the complex.
   The letter from minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher appeared to be
part of West Germany's efforts to persuade American officials this
country is seriously concerned that German companies may have broken
export laws with shipments to Libya and other countries.
   In his letter to Baker, Genscher proposed ``joint discussions
over measures for the prevention of chemical weapons production in
Libya,'' the West German Foreign Ministry said in a telex to the
news media.
   The statement did not explain what measures those would entail.
   But the Welt am Sonntag newspaper said Saturday that Chancellor
Helmut Kohl plans ``an act of solidarity with Western industrial
nations to make sure that Libya does not receive missing
construction components and materials necessary for the production
of chemical weapons.''
   ``Kohl is making efforts in talks with the allies for such a
joint initiative,'' Welt am Sonntag said.
   Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz said before leaving
office last week that the Libyan plant had not reached the point of
production and that it might not get there if Western companies
heeded U.S. warnings.
   Libya claims the plant is intended for the production of
pharmaceuticals, and not poison gases.
   Welt am Sonntag said it got its information from ``sources in the
chancellor's office.'' The newspaper telexed copies of its report to
other news organizations in advance of Sunday's publication.
   According to the West German Foreign Ministry telex, Genscher
also has urged that the European Economic Community launch ``a joint
initiative ... with the goal of preventing the spread of chemical
weapons.''
   West Germany's export controls have come under increasing attack
in the past few weeks because of the Libyan scandal, reports of West
German help in building a suspected mustard gas plant in Iraq, and
alleged shipments of materials that can be used to make atomic bombs
to Pakistan.

   Despite attempts by Syria and Iran to stop
the violence in Lebanon, two bombs exploded Saturday and Shiite
Moslem militias battled once again. Two people were reported killed
and 20 injured.
   Police said one person was killed and 11 people injured,
including a Syrian soldier, when a car exploded in the Bekaa town of
Barr Elias.
   In a separate attack, a bomb exploded at a building in Moslem
west Beirut near a Syrian army checkpoint, wounding six people,
police said.
   A 90-minute firefight between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the slums of south
Beirut killed one person and wounded three, according to police.
   In an unprecedented incident at the American Embassy, local staff
locked Ambassador John McCarthy in his office for three hours on
Friday to press for higher salaries, an embassy source said Saturday.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said
Lebanese guards had mounted a ``work action'' but refused to give
details. ``The issues are economic and are being dealt with,'' she
said.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules,
said a Syrian army ambulance took the wounded Syrian soldier from
the site of the car bomb explosion to a Syrian field clinic in the
Bekaa valley.
   He described the wounded Lebanese as ``civilians.''
   Ambulances, their sirens wailing, evacuated the wounded Lebanese
to a hospital in the Bekaa valley town of Zahleh where they were
treated for ``minor wounds and discharged,'' the spokesman said.
   He said the car-bombing, the second in Lebanon this year, also
set ablaze eight parked cars and damaged 12 stores.
   The first car-bombing occurred in the south Beirut slum of Bir
Abed on Jan. 13, killing seven people and wounded 15. By police
count, 116 people were killed and 448 wounded in 20 car bombings in
Lebanon in 1988.
   The police spokesman said Amal and Hezbollah militiamen traded
machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades until 7:30 a.m., when
the Syrian command dispatched patrols to the contested region to
impose a cease-fire.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in the Bekaa and the northern province as well as in west and south
Beirut.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 173 killed and
340 wounded since a new round of Amal-Hezbollah fighting broke out
in south Beirut Dec. 31 and spread to south Lebanon's apple province.
   Amal and Hezbollah are vying for dominance of the 1 million
Shiites, the largest sect in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah, made up of Shiite zealots, seeks to found an Islamic
republic in Lebanon patterned after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
regime in Iran. The more secular Amal, Arabic for hope, favors a
multisect government that would give Moslems and Christians an equal
share of power.
   By police count, 500 people were killed and 1,500 wounded in
three previous major confrontations between Amal and Hezbollah since
April.
   The fighting continues despite a concerted effort by Syria and
Iran to set and enforce cease-fires in Lebanon.
   The American embassy source, who insisted on not being identified
further, said the ambassador was freed Friday night and promised to
take up the local employees' demands with Washington.
   He said the employees demanded ``increases in salaries and were
protesting the lack of benefits for their families.''
   During the protest, staff members _ including guards armed with
rifles _ blocked entrances to the embassy compound in the Christian
suburb of Aukur, the source said.
   It was not known how many of the 500-strong local staff joined
the protest. McCarthy, 49, took up his post Sept. 24 after the
previous ambassador, John Kelly, left because of illness.
   The situation at the embassy was normal Saturday, the source
added.

   New York City's biggest blowout of the new year
is scheduled this week as Princess Diana flies in for a three-day
stay that includes a visit with young AIDS victims as well as social
hobnobbing.
   It will be the first look at New York for the wife of England's
next king. Diana's previous visit to the United States, in 1985,
took her to the White House with her husband, Prince Charles.
   The princess, this time traveling without her prince, is
scheduled to arrive Wednesday. The following evening she will lure
battalions of beautiful people to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for
the American debut of the Welsh National Opera.
   Following the $1,000-a-seat performance of ``Falstaff,'' a line
of limousines will take the 850 ticket buyers back to lower
Manhattan for dinner with Diana at the Winter Garden atrium of the
World Financial Center.
   Among the lions at the festivities will be screen actor Michael
Douglas, Happy Rockefeller, widow of Nelson, a former vice
president, publisher Malcolm Forbes, developer Donald Trump and
social arbiter Brooke Astor.
   Less frothy fare is on the menu too _ a trip Thursday morning to
the Henry Street Settlement on the lower East Side for a look at day
care and a self-help group session; Friday morning a ride to Harlem
Hospital for a visit with children suffering from AIDS.

entertainer's daughter said.
   ``Dad is coming along, but he has suffered a massive heart attack
with extensive damage to his heart,'' said Patti Lee, who spoke from
St. Francis Medical Center where her father is being treated.
   Lee, described by his daughter Friday as about 72 years old, was
stricken Wednesday night during a performance of the
vaudeville-style Broadway musical ``Sugar Babies.''
   ``He was waiting in the wings for his final part ... when he said
`I don't feel good' and turned white,'' Ms. Lee said. ``He was
drenched in sweat and began to feel nausea and someone called a
medic. That was it.''
   Lee began his entertainment career at age 3, when he started
touring with professional child reviews. He went on to nightclubs,
Broadway, radio and television.

   A member of a small Amish community who
refuses to turn his 6-year-old son over to a hospital for cancer
treatment has been jailed on a contempt of court charge.
   Danny Mast argued that chemotherapy was not helping his son,
Amos, who has abdominal cancer, and that the boy has done much
better on ``natural medicine,'' such as herbs and vitamins, that he
learned at a clinic in Mexico.
   Mast, who lives 15 miles from Elizabethtown in Sonora in Hardin
County, was jailed Friday after a closed hearing before District
Judge Janet Coleman.
   ``This is not only his decision, it's the decision of the whole
group,'' said James Gregory, a court-appointed attorney for Mast.
``Religion permeates everything they do. They believe they are
better off to trust God then to get back in the chemotherapy, which
they feel would affect the remaining quality of this child's life.''
   The Amish religion teaches separation from the world, with plain
dress and living, and little reliance on modern conveniences.
   ``We try to do without what we think we can get along without,''
said Eli Troyer, one of the community's three preachers. ``We do
things like chemotherapy if we don't find anything better, but we
think we have.''
   Troyer said the chemotherapy was like a poison and made the boy
worse. Since beginning the natural medication, Amos is looking
better, Troyer said.
   Mast declined to comment.
   Mast's only requests at the jail were to be allowed to keep his
family Bible with him and to be put in a cell by himself, both of
which were honored, said Jailer Louis Lawson. ``The man was very
calm very polite, very well-mannered.''
   The child's physician at Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville
believes the boy is in danger without a medically proven treatment
and filed the petition in Hardin juvenile court seeking to resume
therapy in December. The hospital contacted the county attorney's
office again this month because the child had never returned.
   At a previous hearing, Mast produced an X-ray that he said shows
his son's tumor had shrunk as a result of the natural treatment.
   Gregory said the only way Mast could be released now is if the
boy is produced or the case is decided otherwise _ if the boy dies,
for example.
   But the lawyer said Mast has told him he does not know where the
boy is and will not produce his son.
   Mast is part of a conclave of 15 Amish families who moved from
Tennessee to southern Hardin County three years ago. German is
spoken in the community and homes lack electricity and running
water. The children attend a one-room Amish school.
   State officials say the family has hidden the boy and believe he
is in another Amish community. They said he would be taken into
state custody if he is found, and the chemotherapy treatments
resumed.
   However, friends and relatives who accompanied Mast to the
hearing said the boy would not be turned over.
   Mast's father-in-law, Monroe Miller, said he believes his
grandson is being helped by the natural treatment, but that if the
boy isn't going to recover he should be able to die in peace rather
than pain.
   Miller said he was not angered by the court ruling. ``Scripture
says if they strike your right cheek, you offer your left,'' he said
as he climbed into his buggy.
   Mast's wife gave birth to a son Wednesday and did not accompany
her husband to the hearing.
   Assistant County Attorney Chris Shaw declined to comment on the
case because it involves a juvenile. All records on juvenile cases
are also closed to the public.

   A man whose mother hid a note in her
underwear saying that her son killed her before she was found dead
two years ago has pleaded innocent to a new indictment charging him.
   ``There's no doubt he's depressed,'' Earl Gray, Richard Dziubak's
attorney, said after court Friday. ``Wouldn't you be having to face
charges again when you know you haven't done anything?''
   Dziubak, 36, originally pleaded guilty to manslaughter after he
admitted pushing his mother, May Hilda Speiser, 65, during an
argument at the top of the basement stairs in their home in February
1987. But experts later differed on whether it was the fall, or a
subsequent drug overdose, that actually killed the woman.
   Dziubak said that after she fell down the stairs, she rejected
his offers of help and walked up two floors to her bedroom. She was
found dead in bed the next day, having left a note stating, ``Dick
killed me threw me down basement.''
   Following his guilty plea, Dziubak was sentenced in June 1987 to
an 81-month prison term. Ramsey County District Judge Allan Markert
released Dziubak in November 1988 and allowed him to withdraw his
plea because of the experts' conflicting views on what had actually
killed the woman.
   On Wednesday, a grand jury indicted Dziubak on charges of
second-degree murder, second-degree manslaughter and third-degree
assault.
   On Friday, Markert let Dziubak remain free without bond because
the defendant had not fled the state after being released from
prison, had no record of violence and had a job.
   Gray said he will file a motion to dismiss the indictment for
lack of probable cause, and Markert set a hearing date of March 1.
Trial was scheduled for April 10.

<HEAD>Senior Communist Calls 1956 Revolution A Popular Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a startling contradiction of the
official view of history, a Politburo member said on Saturday that
the 1956 Hungarian Revolution was a popular uprising, not a
counterrevolution.
   Imre Pozsgay became the first Hungarian leader to publicly
contradict the official view that the revolution, which was
suppressed by Soviet tanks, was a foreign-instigated
counterrevolution designed to subvert the communist system.
   Pozsgay, who heads a Communist Party panel investigating
Hungary's postwar history, made his announcement in a radio
interview.
   His portrayal of the revolution as a popular uprising could
signal the government's readiness to rehabilitate the men who led
the upheaval. Premier Imre Nagy, Defense Minister Pal Maleter and
other top men in the short-lived revolutionary government were
executed in 1958 and buried in unmarked graves.
   In another development, Rezsoe Nyers, another reformer and father
of the 1968 economic reform, was quoted as saying he and other top
officials favor a center-left coalition to govern Hungary after the
1991 parliamentary elections.
   Nyers, who is also on the Politburo and in the government of
Premier Miklos Nemeth, made the statement in an interview carried in
the latest issue of the Vienna news magazine Profil to be published
Monday.
   The comments by Pozsgay and Nyers underscored once again
Hungary's current pioneering role in political and economic reforms
in the Soviet bloc.
   Pozsgay, speaking on Hungarian radio in the 1968 Hours news
magazine, made clear his comments reflect the fact-finding work of
the party's committee carrying out an inquiry into the Hungarian
history of the past 40 years.
   But he refrained from commenting on the Soviet role in crushing
the revolution, which led to heavy losses of life and a mass exodus
of Hungarians.
   The working committe he heads was installed by the party's
policy-setting Central Committee. At a meeting on Friday, the
committee said the ruling Communist Party must ``radically, once and
for all, break away from all remnants of Stalinism and sincerely
reveal the past, this being the only way to lay the groundwork for a
purified socialist policy,'' Pozsgay said.
   He also noted the forthcoming reburial in marked graves of Imre
Nagy and his associates was a humanitarian issue that concerns the
families and ``not a rehabilitation as such about which one ought
not to prophesy.
   ``Nagy was right on his 1953 program, in the 1954-55 power
crisis, though a dispute still exists about his 1956 rule,'' said
the official who was made a Politburo member in May 1988 when
longtime party chief Janos Kadar was ousted.
   ``But in October 1956 it was a popular uprising against a
humiliating oligarchic rule ... a definition that might bring
politics, scholarship and public opinion closer together,'' Pozsgay
said.
   He added, ``The term `counterrevolution' cannot stand its ground,
it is being revised ... a rethinking in under way, while the
international background is being looked into.''
   After the 1948-49 communist takeover in Hungary, Pozsgay
declared, ``bearings were lost, a series of crises ensued, failures
occurred and `the dictatorship of the proletariat' simply excluded
the workers' participation in handling their affairs following the
nationalization drive.''
   Pozsgay said the ``workers' councils'' set up by the 1956
insurgents ``gave workers the sense of acting again.''
   In the future, the party must ``learn to live together with other
parties, proceeding in coalition with them or having them in
opposition,'' he said, referring to a party law to be submitted to
Parliament by Aug. 1, 1989.
   Nyers, a respected economist and himself a onetime Social
Democrat, expressed similar views in the Profil interview he gave
after a meeting a week ago with Austrian Socialist Party leaders in
Vienna.
   Nyers was asked whether his ruling Communist Party should form a
coalition government with the recently revived Social Democratic
Party, while the Smallholders' Party, another re-emerging group,
remains in opposition.
   He replied, ``That would be conceivable, but we strive at present
for a broad coalition, one in which also the Smallholders' Party
plays a role as a positive center, that is a coalition of the left
and the center.''
   This, Nyers explained, would not be an all-party government but a
majority government since other parties may also come into existence.
   Under a recently enacted law on association, political groups may
be be formed, but their registration and activities will be governed
by the party law to be passed later this year.

<HEAD>Cubans, Americans, Soviets Still At Odds Over Missile Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twenty-six years after the world teetered on the
brink of a nuclear holocaust, the Soviets, Cubans and Americans who
guided their nations through the Cuban missile crisis still disagree
who was to blame.
   Though they smiled and chatted amiably, there was much
finger-pointing during an unprecedented two-day meeting among living
officials involved in the crisis, said one participant.
   ``I am not sure all people have learned all the lessons from the
1962 crisis,'' Theodore Sorensen, who was special counselor to
President Kennedy, said in the session at a trade union center in
southwest Moscow.
   Although he didn't name names, Sorensen said some speakers still
were overly concerned with ``national self-interest'' and
``justification,'' blaming everyone but themselves for letting the
superpower showdown get out of hand.
   ``There is plenty of blame to be shared by all countries
represented here today,'' said Sorensen, now a New York lawyer.
   Among those around the table were former Defense Secretary Robert
McNamara and former National Security adviser McGeorge Bundy on the
American side.
   The Soviet side included former Foreign Minister Andrei A.
Gromyko and Anatoly F. Dobrynin, former ambassador to Washington.
Gromyko and Dobrynin did not speak in the public session Saturday
that ended the meeting.
   For the first time, Cubans joined their superpower colleagues in
discussing the crisis. Their delegation was headed by Politburo
member Jorge Risquet, who proposed another review session be held in
Cuba.
   The focus was on October 1962, when the Soviets deployed nuclear
missiles in Cuba and the United States imposed a naval blockade on
the island and demanded and obtained the rockets' removal.
   Bundy, now a New York University history professor, said the
United States and the Soviet Union should have been more open about
their intentions. The Soviets have said they sent nuclear missiles
to Cuba because they feared a U.S. invasion of the island. Bundy
said Washington never had any such plan and was guilty of ``a deep
failure of communication.''
   ``It led you to do something we would never even think of,''
placing missiles in Cuba, Bundy told the Soviets. The incident
showed the danger of excessive secrecy in military matters, he said.
   ``There are still some who think secrets are their safety. More
often than not, it is the other way around.''
   In a plea for more openness, Scott Armstrong of a
Washington-based research group that obtained declassified U.S.
government documents about the Cuban missile crisis, appealed to the
Cubans and Soviets to release their files.
   Armstrong, of the National Security Archive, pointed to three
trunk-loads of U.S. documents placed on a nearby table.
   Risquet said his island had had enough of bullying by the
superpowers and wanted opinions of small countries such as his to be
respected.
   Sergo Mikoyan _ who was executive secretary to his father, former
First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan _ said even in disputes
involving small countries, the superpowers should know ``it is
impossible to assume that a regional conflict will remain regional.''
   Vitaly V. Zhurkin, who heads a new Soviet institute studying
Europe, said the Cuban missile crisis was unavoidable because of the
superpowers' approach to resolving conflicts at the time. But, he
said, the threat from both sides has been reduced because both
recognize that nuclear weapons are not needed and that the economies
of both no longer can sustain an arms race.

<HEAD>Special Prosecutor Asked In Double-Parking Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white off-duty police officer was suspended
after killing a black man in a dispute over the officer's
double-parked car, and a group of elected officials and clergy
called for a special prosecutor in the case.
   ``I wonder what would have happened if black officers had killed
an Italian grandmother in an Italian neighborhood, or if
African-American police officers killed a Jewish boy in a Jewish
neighborhood, or beat an Irish-American to death in an Irish
neighborhood,'' the Rev. Herbert Daughtry said Friday.
   Stephen Kelley, 62, was shot to death Monday by Officer Radames
Ortiz, 24, authorities said.
   The altercation started when Kelley honked his horn at Ortiz's
car, which was double-parked and blocking Kelley's van outside his
apartment building in Brooklyn, witnesses told police.
   One of Kelley's sons, Stuart, 25, said he heard shots and ran
outside, and that Ortiz told him: ``You better watch it or I'll
shoot you, too.''
   Ortiz was suspended Tuesday without pay and police say a grand
jury is considering criminal charges against him. His sister, Nancy
Silvestri, who also is a police officer, was with him and was
relieved of her gun and given modified duty, authorities said.
   Daughtry was joined at a news conference at the House of the Lord
Church in downtown Brooklyn by state Rep. Major Owens and
Assemblyman Roger Green.
   A spokesman for Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman
said a special prosecutor wasn't needed because a bureau already has
been established to investigate alleged misuse of force by police
officers, the Law Enforcement Investigations Bureau.
   The spokesman, Glenn Goldberg, promised ``a full, fair and
professional investigation.''

<HEAD>By-Elections Test Bhutto's Electoral Strength</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistanis voted Saturday in national
and regional elections that are considered the first test of Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto's popularity since she was elected in
November.
   No violence or other problems were reported when polls closed,
said a duty officer at Election Commission headquarters.
   There was no early estimate of voter turnout, said the officer,
who by custom is not named. Results are expected late Saturday or
Sunday.
   Three million of Pakistan's 48 million eligible voters were
entitled to vote for 13 of the 237 National Assembly seats and seven
seats in three of the country's four provincial legislatures.
   Earlier Saturday, the Election Commission announced one of the
National Assembly seats had been won by a member of Ms. Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party because it was uncontested.
   Voting took place in districts where candidates in November
general elections won more than one seat, or the vote was postponed
because a candidate died.
   The outcome cannot dent the position of Ms. Bhutto, who heads the
federal government in Islamabad on the basis of her sizeable
majority, bolstered by support from smaller groups and independent
lawmakers.
   At the center of the opposition is Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, chairman
of the nine-party Islamic Democratic Alliance.
   Ms. Bhutto's biggest rival is contesting for the National
Assembly from the rural Kot Addu district of Punjab, Pakistan's
biggest and richest province and the stronghold of Jatoi's Moslem
coalition.
   By-election results will indicate whether the two biggest parties
have lost or gained popularity since the general elections.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Who Prayed With Bundy To Leave Prison Ministry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor who prayed with Ted Bundy says
he is quitting the prison ministry program that led him to the
serial killer because of the disapproval of his constituents.
   Hundreds of phone calls and letters from people questioning State
Attorney John Tanner's involvement with Bundy before last week's
execution have reached the prosecutor's Daytona Beach office.
   Tanner said the reaction has turned from negative to ``90 percent
positive,'' but some people are discussing a recall attempt.
   ``A small percentage of the public is uncomfortable with it,''
said Tanner, a born-again Christian who exchanged letters with Bundy
for about two years and has been state attorney for about a month.
``They feel it's somehow inappropriate.
   ``I think public perception and trust is absolutely essential. I
want to keep public confidence in the office.''
   Bundy invited Tanner to visit after he wrote as part of his
prison ministry. While Bundy was on death row, Tanner visited him
about 50 times to pray and read the Bible.
   Tanner asked Gov. Bob Martinez to delay Bundy's execution last
week to give Bundy time to confess to dozens of murders he is
believed to have committed. Martinez refused, and Bundy was
electrocuted Tuesday for killing 12-year-old Kimberly Leach of Lake
City. Before his death, he confessed to 23 murders.
   Bundy's lawyer, James Coleman has said his client confessed since
1986 to ``two or three dozen'' murders in private talks with his
attorneys and psychiatrists.
   Tanner, a former criminal defense attorney, discussed his role in
Bundy's case Friday during a meeting of Volusia County police chiefs.
   He asked them to explain his role to their officers, saying:
``Please tell your people because I need their support, I need their
trust.''
   About 100 disgruntled residents pledged to attend a Sunday
meeting at the Ormond Beach home of Peggy Barbee, who said that
while the gathering is not necessarily a recall attempt, it may come
to that.
   ``We're just going to have a meeting to let people air their
feelings,'' she said.

   The guitar company that made instruments
for stars from Elvis Presley to Johnny Cash has been sold to a
Wisconsin company after two months of bankruptcy proceedings.
   Randall Corp., which makes electronic amplifiers, hopes to expand
its product line with the purchase of Guild Guitar Corp., said
Patricia Meyer, marketing services manager.
   The Wisconsin company paid $2.1 million for Guild at a
court-ordered auction on Tuesday, Meyer said. A U.S. bankruptcy
judge approved the transaction.
   Guild filed for Chapter 11 protection in November after losing
about $30,000 a month for several years, said court-appointed
trustee Michael Weingarten.
   The company will continue to operate its Westerly factory, which
makes about 25 guitars a day, a union official said. At its peak in
the 1970s, Guild was making about 100 guitars a day, said Dorothy
Gentile, president of the local Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union.
   Guild's acoustic and electric guitars have been plucked, strummed
and banged by, among others, Elvis, Johnny Cash, Eric Clapton and
members of the bands Def Leppard and Twisted Sister.

<HEAD>Irish Ambassador In Beirut To Check Hostage Release Rumors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ireland's Ambassador Patrick McCabe
arrived in Beirut on Saturday to investigate rumors that a kidnapped
Irish teacher may be freed shortly, but he said he was not hopeful.
   A pro-Syrian Beirut newspaper reported without elaboration that
efforts to free foreign captives were making progress.
   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, Foreign Minister Farouk
Al-Sharaa told reporters Saturday ``there is nothing now'' when
asked about a hostage release.
   He spoke after the arrival of Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati for talks on fighting between rival Shiite Moslem militias
in Lebanon. Asked the same question, Velayati said:``I hope all the
hostages will be released.''
   McCabe, who is based in Iraq, told reporters at Beirut
Airport,``I am here on behalf of my government to investigate rumors
... about a possible early release of Mr. Brian Keenan.'' He added:
``I don't know of any reasons which would make me particularly
hopeful.'' Keenan is a Belfast man with dual British and Irish
nationality whose release is also sought by the British government.
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in
Beirut and believed to be held mostly by pro-Iranian groups. McCabe
said he would meet with diplomats and others who he was not prepared
to identify.
   The left-wing daily As-Safir said Saturday that ``spiritual and
security sources expect positive developments at the level of
releasing some foreign captives held in Lebanon.'' It added that
``high-level contacts in this regard took place in the past two
weeks,'' but it did not elaborate.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio Friday described reports
of an imminent release as ``mere speculation based on rumors.''
   Lebanese newspapers recently have published several reports about
possible releases of foreign captives. None has proved accurate.
   As-Safir's report followed speculation in Beirut on Wednesday
about the imminent release of Keenan and of British hostage John
McCarthy.
   Keenan, 38, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 as he walked to the
American University of Beirut where he taught English. Six days
later, McCarthy, 32, of Barnet, north London, was kidnapped as he
drove to Beirut Airport in the Moslem sector. He is a British
television journalist.
   No group claimed their abductions.

   A state medical board committee found
sufficient evidence to warrant revoking the license of a fertility
specialist accused of telling women they were pregnant when he knew
they were not.
   A three-physician panel of the board decided at the end of a
five-hour informal hearing Friday that Dr. Cecil B. Jacobson of
Vienna violated the Virginia Medical Practices Act.
   The panel will tell the full board that it believes revocation of
Jacobson's license may be justified. The final decision would be
made after the full 16-member board holds a formal hearing.
   Jacobson, 52, credited with performing the first amniocentesis in
the United States, also was found to have defrauded six women who
paid him up to $5,000 each for fertility treatments, the panel said.
He recently closed his Tysons Corner clinic.
   Several former patients who went to Jacobson for fertility
problems and testified Friday had tears in their eyes and smiles on
their faces at the panel's finding.
   ``I couldn't figure out what I was doing to kill these babies,''
said Sharon Hayward, who owns a printing business in Camp Springs.
``I felt so guilty.'' Ms. Hayward said Jacobson told her three times
that she was pregnant when she was not.
   Jacobson's attorney, Tara McCarthy, said the accusations from the
witnesses and the nine lawsuits pending against Jacobson were the
complaints of disappointed women who had difficulty conceiving.
   ``The other side of the coin is that he has treated a lot of
patients ... who did get pregnant,'' Ms. McCarthy said. Jacobson had
no comment.
   The findings of the informal Virginia state hearing Friday will
be sent to Jacobson in writing. He then may surrender his license to
avoid further proceedings from the state board.
   The Board of Medicine charged Jacobson with injecting several
patients with a fertility drug on several occasions and conducting
numerous ultrasound examinations, telling them they were pregnant
when they were not. The drug causes symptoms that mimic pregnancy,
such as weight gain and postive urine tests.
   Jacobson also faces action from a federal agency. Earlier this
month, the Federal Trade Commission filed consumer fraud charges
against him, alleging that he told potential patients his
hormone-injection treatments had resulted in successful pregnancies
for 80 percent of his patients, when in fact no more than 40 percent
became pregnant.
   In all, said FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver, Jacobson treated
``several hundred women'' who lost a total of from $400,000 to $2
million or more. The FTC will be seeking a return of some of all of
those fees, Oliver said.
   Much of Friday's testimony concerned Jacobson's interpretation of
ultrasound tests on his patients, which seek to examine a pregnant
woman's growing fetus by the use of ultrasonic waves.
   Jacobson maintained that he detected an embryonic sac in the
ultrasound pictures, indicating pregnancy. However, he later
informed the patients that the pregnancy had ended and their bodies
had reabsorbed the fetus.
   Jacobson said he is not currently practicing and that he is
reviewing 25 years of work to prepare defense for multiple lawsuits.
   Some of the patients' complaints were the subject of a ``60
Minutes'' television segment last month.

<HEAD>Published Report Has IRS Joining Commodities Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has joined the FBI in
an investigation of illegal trading at the nation's two largest
commodities exchanges, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   A squad of 15 IRS agents will look for possible income tax fraud,
including the skimming of profits and concealment of income, the
Chicago Tribune reported.
   Citing unidentified sources, the newspaper said the agents had
joined the FBI in examining documents obtained by federal subpoenas.
   One investigator said some subjects of the inquiry face a dilemma
in filling out 1988 federal tax returns, the newspaper reported.
   They must decide whether to record possibly illegal earnings that
were documented by undercover operatives who investigated the
exchanges, or face charges of income tax evasion, the source told
the Tribune.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade
were targeted by a two-year federal investigation in which FBI
agents posed as traders and secretly tape-recorded conversations on
the trading floor.
   The FBI and U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas' office refused again
Friday to confirm or deny the investigation was under way.
   But published reports say some 200 subpoenas to appear before a
grand jury have been served on more than 200 prominent brokers,
traders and trading firms. Some witnesses are expected to cooperate,
broadening the scope of the investigation.
   Despite the wide-ranging investigation, the Mercantile Exchange
and its European partners are moving ahead with plans for a
worldwide trading system.
   Globex _ a project of the Mercantile Exchange and Reuters America
Inc. _ would link investors in North America, Europe and Asia via an
all-night electronic system for trading futures and options
contracts on currency futures, including the British pound, the West
German mark, the Swiss and French francs, Australian and Canadian
dollars, and the Japanese yen.
   Full trading worldwide is expected to begin in 1990, exchange
spokesman Andrew Yemma said Friday.
   The system would kick in at 6 p.m. _ after the Mercantile
Exchange closes at 3:15 p.m. _ and trade electronically with futures
markets on other continents until 6 a.m. _ before the exchange
reopens at 7:20 a.m., meaning Mercantile Exchange trading would be
conducted nearly 20 hours a day.
   Yemma labeled ``completely erroneous'' reports that several
European financial institutions backed away from the project because
of the federal investigation.
   The New York Mercantile Exchange voted Thursday to join the
venture.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that
regulates the industry, must approve Globex before it can begin
operations.

<TEXT>
   Fighting between rival political
candidates and their supporters forced officials to halt voting at
scores of polling stations Saturday after six people were killed and
about 200 injured, authorities said.
   Violence flared despite the deployment of 15,000 police and
village guards to protect polling stations where municipal elections
were being held.
   The Interior Ministry said it ordered the mobilization after one
person was killed and 200 injured Thursday in attacks with homemade
bombs and clubs.
   Despite the violence, the campaign was relatively peaceful
compared with past campaigns in Bangladesh.
   Representatives of the two major opposition parties boycotted
last year's parliamentary elections but are contesting these
elections. They are Sheik Hasina's Awami League and the Bangladesh
National Party of Khaleda Zia.
   Election Commission sources said 388 candidates were running for
chairmanships of the 80 councils and 3,000 others were contesting
798 council seats. The councils serve three years.
   Election officials could not give the voter turnout, but more
than 2 million people were eligible to vote Saturday.
   A police official in Dhaka, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said at least five people were killed and about 200 were injured in
clashes Saturday involving police and rival candidates.
   Another police officer in southern Mongla town said fighting
among rival supporters left another person dead there.
   Polling was suspended in scores of centers because of violence
and voting irregularities, an election officer said on condition of
anonymity. He said he did not know the precise number of polling
stations where voting was halted.

   The Rev. Ralph Abernathy joined local
government officials and well-wishers for the groundbreaking of a
national civil rights museum on the site where Martin Luther King
Jr. was assassinated.
   Construction is to begin this week on the $8.8 million
transformation of the rundown Lorraine Motel. It is scheduled to
reopen July 4, 1991, as a museum with exhibits on major civil rights
conflicts and a tour of Room 306, where King spent his last night.
   ``I need not pause to tell you how delighted I am to return to
these sacred grounds,'' Abernathy told a crowd of about 150 on
Friday. ``I'm just glad to be here on this occasion because you are
speaking so clearly and so profoundly to the South and the whole
nation: `Get your act together.'''
   While staying at the Lorraine, King was shot to death April 4,
1968, on a motel balcony.
   Abernathy, who succeeded King as president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, thanked supporters of the project
for ``building a memorial to the life of my dearest friend.''
   Memphis lawyer D'Army Bailey, who led the seven-year effort to
preserve the motel, called the decision to turn it into a museum a
victory over the ``unholy carnage'' that took place there.
   But a small group of protesters nearby said King would have
wanted to help the poor rather than make a museum. Some waived signs
such as ``Memphis, don't let his dreams die, too.''
   ``We feel our taxes could be better spent in some other way that
would be similar to Dr. King's believes,'' said a protester, Jon
McLaughlin.
   The $8.8 million cost of the museum is coming from the state,
city and Shelby County governments. Part of the motel building will
be razed and the wing where King stayed will be the centerpiece of
the museum.
   Opponents have suggested a homeless shelter or health clinic
instead. Bailey said he also favors better housing and health care,
but that the Lorraine is needed as a monument to the civil rights
struggle.
   The Lorraine began attracting visitors within months of the
shooting, after the motel's owner turned King's room into a shrine.
A city report in 1980 said 70,000 people visited the site each year
on organized tours.

   The turbulent struggles of a youthful Paul
Cezanne to develop his artistic style are spotlighted in a new
exhibition of the French master's early works, opening Sunday at the
National Gallery of Art.
   Harsh scenes of eroticism and violence appear among the
portraits, landscapes and still lifes in 57 paintings and 15
drawings from the least-known period of Cezanne's art, when he
abandoned law school and began painting in his 20s.
   Hardly any hint of Cezanne's future eminence as a major figure in
the impressionist and post-impressionist movements, or his prophetic
influence on cubism and abstract art, is evident in the exhibition,
which will run through April 30.
   Barbara Bush, wife of the president, was given a private tour of
the Cezanne showing and some other exhibits at the gallery on
Saturday.
   The show, organized by the British art historian Sir Lawrence
Gowing, debuted at the Royal Academy of Arts in London last April
and traveled to Washington _ its only U.S. appearance _ from the
Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
   Cezanne scholar John Rewald told reporters at a National Gallery
preview that the artist's early works, from the decade of the 1860s,
frequently have been dismissed as inferior to the great canvasses of
his mature years.
   But ``the early works can stand on their own feet,'' Rewald said.
``Even if he had died before his final period, we'd treasure him as
a great artist.''
   ``Whoever you pick as the father of modern art, the first father
has to be Cezanne,'' said gallery director J. Carter Brown.
   Charles Moffett, senior curator of paintings at the National
Gallery, said the exhibition is ``a portrait of the artist as a
young man'' and ``gets us into the head and mind of one of the
greatest painters of all time.''
   The paintings and drawings were selected from public and private
collections in the United States, Europe, the Soviet Union,
Australia, Brazil and Canada. To complement the show, the National
Gallery is displaying 25 later Cezanne paintings from its own
holdings and loans from the White House and three private U.S.
collections.
   The paintings in the auxiliary show are serenely contemplative,
after the emotional thrashing and self-doubts reflected in some of
Cezanne's early works next door, and they lead to another room where
Cezanne takes his place with the likes of Monet and Renoir.
   Among the later Cezanne oils is the National Gallery's ``Bend in
the Road,'' painted in the first decade of the 20th century with
pastel planes that are unmistakable precursors of the cubism of
Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso.

   Fifteen dead sea lions have
washed onto beaches in and near here since last weekend but
authorities have been unable to determine what killed the marine
mammals.
   The latest four carcasses, like the others, appeared to be
several weeks old and too decomposed to conduct a necropsy to
determine a cause of death, said Jim Lecky of the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
   Two sea lions were found Thursday night, the third was discovered
early Friday near, and a fourth Saturday morning, and a fourth
Saturday morning, all along the shore around Huntington Beach.
   ``Sea lion deaths are pretty common, although it's a little
unusual to see this many in this short a time,'' said Lecky.
   Last year, 18 dead sea lions were discovered on Orange County
beaches, most them washing ashore during the winter.
   Possible causes of death include drowning in fishermen's gill
nets, being shot at sea, attacks by white sharks or viral infections.

<HEAD>Prensa Latina Reports Gorbachev To Visit Cuba In April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
visit Cuba in the first week of April, the official Cuban news
agency reported Saturday.
   The visit was announced on Cuban television Saturday, the Prensa
Latina news agency said in an urgent dispatch monitored in Mexico
City.
   Gorbachev had planned a three-day visit to Cuba begining Dec. 9,
but canceled at the last minute after the devastating earthquake in
Soviet Armenia.
   Cuba sent a relief team to the stricken area and said the
invitation to Gorbachev still was open.
   There was no immediate announcement in Moscow about rescheduling
the visit, and Soviet sources have said the visit has been postponed
indefinitely.
   Although Cuban President Fidel Castro has made no secret of his
disdain for Gorbachev's reformist agenda, the Soviet leader's visit
was to feature Havana's grandest reception for a visiting dignitary.
At least 500,000 people were expected to line the route of
Gorbachev's motorcade.
   Castro's rejection of Gorbachev's economic reforms, which he said
``reek of capitalism,'' have led to speculation about a rift between
the Soviet Union and its closest ally in the Western Hemisphere.
   Cuba's economic performance is poor, and the island nation has
been a financial drain on the Soviets at a time when the Kremlin is
trying to channel resources to domestic needs. Castro also is
unsympathetic to Gorbachev's encouragement of more openness of
expression.
   Gorbachev was widely expected to try to persuade Castro to soften
his opposition to the new political thinking in the Soviet Union.
   ``We are not seeking to worsen our relations with Cuba,'' one
Latin American specialist at the Kremlin said in December. ``But
Gorbachev is a very persuasive man, and he will try to explain his
intentions.''
   The source said Cuba has become an embarrassment as well as a
financial drain on the Soviet Union. Castro is seen as an exporter
of revolution, a position that runs counter to new Soviet thinking.
   ``We are no longer supporting class wars or socialist revolution
in Latin America,'' said the Soviet specialist, who spoke to The
Associated Press in Moscow on condition of anonymity.

   A Republican fund-raising letter signed by
party chairman Lee Atwater criticizes a 50 percent congressional pay
raise endorsed by former President Reagan and President Bush, but a
spokeswoman says it was all a mistake.
   Atwater is ``not opposed'' to the pay raise, according to
Republican National Committee spokeswoman Leslie Goodman, who blamed
the mistake on Republican National Committee staffers.
   She said Atwater had ordered changes in the letter, including
deletion of the two paragraphs of pay raise criticism, but staff
members failed to follow the directions.
   The five-page letter was mailed to prospective contributors, and
found its way into the hands of the Democratic leaders.
   The letter, which appeals for donations and attacks Democratic
liberals, went out before President Bush endorsed the raise last
Friday, calling it ``overdue.'' But it apparently was written after
former President Reagan formally proposed the large raise in the
budget he submitted to Congress.
   It also was mailed before the House Republican leadership began
negotiatons with House Democratic leaders last week to allow the
raise to become law Feb. 8 without a vote in return for a package of
severe restrictions on outside income, including a ban on speaking
fees.
   The letter tells prospective contributors: ``There's also a move
afoot to let congressmen enjoy yet another whopping pay raise. In
this kind of atmosphere, how can President Bush hope to keep your
taxes low, cut the budget deficit and keep prosperity growing across
the land?''
   Ms. Goodman said the letter was written while Atwater was still
heading the Bush transition team and had not yet been formally
inaugurated as RNC chairman.
   She said it was prepared by Republican Party staffers under
former RNC Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. adding: ``It was a staff
error. It was one of those things that slipped. Atwater's new staff
requested changes be made before the final version was made out.
This particular one was not.''
   The White House press office had no comment and referred a
reporter to the Republican National Committee.
   Rank-and-file lawmakers would have their salaries raised from
$89,500 to $135,000 unless both houses of Congress vote to reject
the increase. Federal judges and top executive branch political
appointees also would receive 50 percent raises.
   At a news conference on Friday, Bush said: ``A raise is overdue.
There's no question about that. The reform of the honoraria payments
for these speeches, I think is very, very good.''
   Reagan's recommendation to Congress endorsed the proposal of a
presidential commission. Lawmakers, especially Democrats, were
surprised that Reagan did not reduce the amount, as he could have
done under the law.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, reportedly has been upset that
he has taken the brunt of public outrage against the size of the
raise, even after the two Republican presidents endorsed it and the
House GOP leadership began negotiating with Democrats on the
financial reforms.
   Wright spokesman Mark Johnson said a ``high ranking member'' of
the House Democratic leadership, whom he would not name, complained
to White House Chief of Staff John Sununu about the letter.
   ``We were subsequently told that Atwater was informed of the
president's position on this issue,'' Johnson said. ``We don't think
any political effort by the RNC is going to go any further.''
   The House has taken more heat than the Senate for the raise
because House leaders do not plan to allow a vote. The Senate will
have a vote _ probably meaningless _ that is almost certain to
reject the increase.
   Last week, the bipartisan House negotiators reached tentative
agreement on the outlines of the reform package, which would include
the honoraria ban affecting speeches, appearances and articles;
closing a loophole in federal law that has allowed 190 House members
to stash away more than $39 million in surplus campaign money for
their personal use; limits on travel paid for by special interests,
and restrictions on non-honoraria income.
   Majority Whip Tony Coelho and Rep. Vic Fazio, both D-Calif. have
been negotiating the package with two Republican counterparts: GOP
Whip Dick Cheney, R-Wyo. and Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.

<HEAD>Officers Scouting Central Utah Area For Bundy Burial Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEG McENTEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police officer on Saturday scouted a
central Utah site where serial killer Ted Bundy claimed, before his
execution, that he buried one of his victims.
   However, Bountiful Police Chief Larry Higgins said that, as in
the case of two unsuccessful forays Friday at other locations, a
full-scale search for the remains of Debi Kent would have to wait
until warmer weather.
   In confessions Sunday and early Tuesday at Florida State Prison,
Bundy used maps and descriptions to target areas where he buried the
bodies of three women killed during the mid-1970s while he studied
law at the University of Utah.
   On Friday, searchers seeking the remains of 15-year-old Sue
Curtis were were frustrated by frozen ground and snow cover
southeast of Price. Lawmen in Wayne County reported similar
conditions near Capital Reef National Park, where Bundy said he
buried the body of 17-year-old Nancy Wilcox.
   However, temperatures near Capital Reef, in south-central Utah,
are generally warmer than the other two sites and Wayne County Chief
Deputy Leon Brinckerhoff said a search could begin within a week to
10 days if the weather cooperates.
   ``If weather permits and the snow melts, we want to be right back
in that area. If there's a body there, we'll find it,'' he said.
   Brinckerhoff added that a rancher in the area remembered seeing a
man wearing a suit and matching Bundy's description, in the area in
the mid-1970s, but didn't think to contact authorities until he
heard of the execution.
   Higgins said his officer examined a stretch of U.S. 89 between
Fairview and Mayfield in hopes of narrowing the scope of a later
search for Kent's remains.
   ``All we're really doing is checking out the information provided
to us by Bundy in regard to the location, to see if we can locate
approximately the site,'' he said.
   Higgins said Bundy supplied a detailed description of the
gravesite, but declined to discuss specifics.
   ``We're going to have to wait until spring,'' he said. ``But I
think that we've got a pretty good chance for success, and we'll
make every effort to find Debi Kent's remains.''
   In the days before his execution last Tuesday, Bundy, 42,
confessed to 23 killings, but investigators suspect he may have
committed more than 100. He has been linked to slayings in Utah,
Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Florida, Vermont, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
   Bundy acknowledged involvement in eight Utah killings and
mentioned the names of Kent, last seen in a high school parking lot
on Nov. 8, 1975, and Wilcox, who vanished from the Salt Lake City
suburb of Holladay the previous October.
   Bundy also said he abducted a girl from the Brigham Young
University campus in 1975 and buried her body near Price, in
east-central Utah. Investigators believe that victim was Curtis, who
disappeared from a Mormon youth conference at BYU in June of that
year.
   But while Bundy mentioned eight killings in Utah, authorities
have been able to link him through evidence or confessions to only
five.
   Besides Kent, Curtis and Wilcox, investigators believe Bundy also
killed Melissa Smith, 17, of Midvale, who disappeared Oct. 19, 1974,
and Laura Ann Aime of Salem, also 17, who vanished 12 days later.
Their bodies were discovered in canyons of the Wasatch Range.

<HEAD>New Premier Calls For ``New Socialism'' In Yugoslavia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's Premier-designate Ante
Markovic on Saturday called for radical market-oriented reforms and
a ``completly new type of socialism'' to overcome the country's deep
economic and social crisis.
   ``I consider the open-market economy to be an ultimate
achievement of mankind for which no alternative has yet been
found,'' Markovic said, advocating closer links with ``the most
developed European countries.''
   He also revealed that this communist country, with inflation
running more than 250 percent and stagnating economic growth, is
again unable to repay foreign debts.
   ``The solution to our problems does not lie in cosmetic changes
to the existing system,'' Markovic said in his speech on state
television.
   ``We should develop a completely new type of socialism in this
country ... with maximum democracy, freedom and political
pluralism,'' Markovic said in his first public address since he was
designated premier by the state presidency.
   Markovic said he accepted the premiership on the condition he
have a free hand in choosing his Cabinet.
   He said it will take at least five years to consolidate his
reforms.
   Markovic is formally to remain in office until the end of
Mikulic's original four-year mandate that expires in May 1990. The
premier designate said he would need a full mandate to implement his
economic plan.
   Markovic on March 1 is to succeed Branko Mikulic, who resigned
with his entire Cabinet on Dec. 30. It was the first federal
government to step down since the communists took power after World
War II.
   Mikulic resigned following his failure to solve the country's
numerous social and economic problems, including a dramatic
escalation of labor and ethnic unrest.
   ``All 23 million citizens of Yugoslavia should have a right to
decide about (the future of) this country ...'' Markovic said in a
clear reference to the Yugoslav Communist Party members who occupy
all leading economic and political posts.
   In May 1987, Yugoslavia was unable to repay an installment of
about $400 million of a short-term foreign loan. Without giving
details, Markovic said Yugoslavia is now faced with a similar
problem.
   ``Unless Yugoslavia is able to increase its foreign currency
earnings to between $25 billion and $28 billion a year within the
next five years ... it will not be able to set aside 25 percent of
that figure to repay its foreign debt'' and simultaneously ensure
that its economy continues to function normally, he disclosed.
   At present, the country's foreign currency earnings are about $11
billion annually. It has to devote about $7 billion annually to
service and repay its $21 billion foreign debt.
   Markovic said that joint ventures with foreign partners must have
``absolute priority.''
   He also called for an ``urgent introduction of shares and bonds,
private initiative and entrepreneurship in the Yugoslav economy''
and an end to state interference in the running of businesses.
   Other reforms would include the reshaping the banking system
along Western lines, creating a capital market and an end to state
subsidies for money-losing companies.
   Markovic said that Yugoslav workers in profitable firms should be
``stimulated to work better'' through higher salaries because ``the
impoverished worker is ready to destroy the current system.''

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers on Saturday suspended their search for
about 20 miners buried for a week in a sabotaged Peruvian gold mine,
police said.
   Three miners have been found alive and six bodies have been
recovered since a rescue began Monday at the hillside mine near
Nazca, 230 miles south of Lima.
   Official sources now say no more than 30 miners were trapped and
presumed dead, after giving conflicting figures ranging from 15 to
300.
   Nazca police said they suspended operations because rescuers were
endangered by toxic fumes, smoke from a still-burning fire, and
feeble tunnel supports that caused several new cave-ins during the
week.
   The government is evaluating whether to renew efforts after 20
rescuers were treated for inhalation of smoke and toxic gas in the
past week, said police.
   Factions battling over a rich gold vein on Jan. 21 set ablaze
timbers supporting tunnels and smoke prevented miners from escaping
the Sol de Oro mine, officials said. Flames ate through the beams
and the mine collapsed Monday, further enclosing victims.
   Hope was revived briefly Tuesday when rescuers reported tapping
from caved-in tunnels. But those sounds have not been heard since.
   Officials said it is impossible to know exactly how many people
were trapped because about 900 farmers and other area residents have
been working the mine independently for more than a year, mining
when and where they like without any control.
   Commercial mining was halted there 40 years ago because of
falling profits, officials said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday discussed the Soviet
Union with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and then warmed
up for an all-male evening of humor by having lunch with a
businessmen's club.
   Kissinger, back from a recent trip to the Soviet Union, said
leaders there are ``very relaxed'' toward the Bush administration,
even though the president is calling for a go-slow approach to
expanding ties between the two nations.
   Kissinger shared his impressions of the Soviet Union with Bush at
their meeting Saturday, he said. He said the Soviets do not see
Bush's plan to review U.S.-Soviet policy as a bad sign and are not
impatient for quick action.
   ``I think they understand that a review has to be undertaken,''
he said. ``I have the impression that they have great confidence in
President Bush.''
   On his second weekend as president, Bush ventured out of the
White House for lunch with members of the Alibi Club a few blocks
away. The club consists of about 50 businessmen and Bush has long
attended its Friday lunches, said press aide Bruce Zanca.
   The event was switched from Friday to Saturday because most
members were in town to attend the evening's annual jokefest with
the all-male Alfalfa Club, said Zanca.
   Bush has attended the Alfalfa dinner in the past, along with
former President Reagan and a virtual who's who of administration
officials, business leaders and congressmen of both parties.
   Bush, who in his campaign pledged to be an advocate for women's
rights, planned to attend in ``the tradition of past presidents,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush's plan to attend the all-male Alfalfa Club was criticized by
Ann Lewis, a women's activist and Democratic political consultant.
She called the club an example of how women are excluded from
chances to make business ties.
   The 76-year-old club permits no press coverage, but The
Washington Post in past years has compiled the speeches and ribald
jokes as relayed by those on hand.
   In 1987, members raved about the speech delivered by Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-Ariz., but Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., was not amused.
   Domenici had quipped that women would throw their panties at him
when he spoke on the campaign trail. The Post quoted him as saying,
``It happened again just yesterday. I don't know what got into
Senator Mikulski.''
   By the time Bush left the Alibi Club on I Street, about 100
people had gathered across the street. He gave a wave and they
cheered.
   Meanwhile, Bush's motorcade kept up a new practice for casual
drives of stopping at traffic lights. In the past, the procession
has simply swept through while police halted ordinary motorists.
   Mrs. Bush caused a stir when she left the White House grounds
Saturday.
   Accompanied by about five companians and security personnel, she
decided to walk her English springer spaniel, Millie. When she
walked out to the front gate onto busy Pennsylvania Avenue, she was
chased by reporters and camera crews who had been waiting for
Kissinger.
   ``I'm going for a walk,'' she said as passersby stopped to stare.
``I'm going to do this all the time.''
   She apparently had planned to cross the street to Blair House,
where official White House guests usually stay. Informed that it was
closed, she turned and went back into the White House grounds.
   Mrs. Bush also was given a private tour of a National Gallery of
Art showing of youthful works by French impressionist master Paul
Cezanne. The 57 paintings and 15 drawings. The show opens to the
public Sunday.
   Bush on Sunday planned to travel to the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md., and spend most of the day there.
   The president was to be visited at Camp David by House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, said administration sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity. One characterized the meeting as purely
social and said Wright's wife would drive to Camp David with him.
   Since his election, Bush has made a point of friendly gestures
toward Congress in anticipation of a brewing storm over the federal
budget. The source, however, said no fiscal discussion was planned
for the Wright visit.

   Those who saw the Santa Barbara oil spill
blacken California's coast with sticky goo two decades ago still
have a residue of bitterness, environmental activism, and mistrust
of business and government.
   ``It looked like the world was covered by oil,'' recalled biology
professor Michael Neushul of the University of California at Santa
Barbara.
   ``It was a shock. It was horrible,'' said James ``Bud'' Bottoms,
a sculptor and co-founder of Get Oil Out, better known as GOO.
``Everybody stood along the beaches and cried because we thought our
environment was finished.''
   GOO scheduled a Saturday night dinner at the Montecito Country
Club to commemorate the big spill created when an offshore oil well
blew out in the Santa Barbara Channel on Jan. 28, 1969.
   Barry Lane, a spokesman for Unocal Corp. _ named Union Oil Co. of
California when well A-21 on platform A blew out _ said the accident
5{ miles south of Santa Barbara ``was not a pleasant experience for
the company.''
   Lane agreed with drilling foes that the accident _ which saw
oil-drenched birds and beaches televised nationwide and spurred an
eight-year drilling moratorium off Santa Barbara _ helped spur the
environmental movement.
   ``It was a social disaster. It was a governmental disaster,''
Neushul said. ``It was an industrial responsibility disaster. It was
the beginning of the environmental movement.''
   Yet, Unocal and its critics still disagree over the amount of oil
spilled, the extent of damage and the likelihood that improvements
in drilling technology spurred by the spill will prevent another
such accident.
   The spill ``spewed more than 3.25 million gallons of oil over 800
square miles of water, covered 100 miles of coastline and beaches
with a thick, tarry black goo, smothered thousands of birds, fish
and other sea life, and helped trigger a new age of environmental
awareness,'' a California Coastal Commission news release said last
week.
   Tallies by Neushul and his students concluded the spill killed
9,000 birds, 8.8 million barnacles, 30,000 mussels and 51,800
limpets, but they were unable to prove significant numbers of deaths
among fish, whales, elephant seals, sea lions or plankton, he said.
   ``The truth is that it was not an ecological disaster,'' Neushul
said.
   Lane said Unocal's best estimate is that 420,000 to 840,000
gallons of oil spilled and 30 miles of coastline were covered with
oil. Lawsuits stemming from the spill resulted in settlements
totaling about $16 million, he added.
   ``A number of scientific studies make it pretty clear as to what
the ecological impact was, and that is nothing,'' Lane said.
   Others disagreed.
   ``If that was not an ecological disaster, there is no such thing
as an ecological disaster,'' replied GOO's current president, lawyer
Robert Hopps.
   When the spill happened despite federal and oil company
assurances to the contrary, local residents were furious.
   ``Government was taken in by the big oil companies, no question
about that,'' said former GOO president and ex-state Sen. Alvin
Weingand, now 84.
   ``We don't trust our government as much as we used to, which is
great,'' Neushul said. ``It means they don't lie to us quite as
much.''
   But Lane said the spill had ``a tremendous impact'' on improving
drilling technology to make wells more controllable, led to improved
training for oil platform workers and made oil companies averse to
taking any risks.
   Unocal district production superintendent Jim Grimes said that
since the spill, ``there have been over 900 wells drilled offshore
California, and there's not been another incident like this.
Somewhere along the line there should be some confidence we can
drill without having a disaster.''
   Others are less confident.
   With nearly two dozen oil platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel
today, ``We all live in fear and anticipation that one will be hit
by a tanker or another blowout,'' Bottoms said. ``It's like having a
monster. It is a monster _ a giant oil monster.''

   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov discussed Moscow's
withdrawal plans with President Najib and other Afghan officials on
Friday and Saturday in Kabul, the official Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   Under a United Nations accord, the Soviets have until Feb. 15 to
end their nine-year intervention in Afghanistan, but diplomats who
requested anonymity told The Associated Press the withdrawal should
be completed within a week.
   Iran, which serves as a refuge for more than 1 million Afghans,
said its embassy will remain open, and workers on Saturday erected
half-inch-thick steel plates around the embassy's eight-foot walls.
   Other Moslem and Middle Eastern countries began planning for
increased security around their embassies in the besieged capital.
   ``This is not just a concern of the Western nations,'' said one
Moslem diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We could
count on the Soviets for security. Now we have to figure out what we
will do when they've gone.''
   The Soviets have said they intend to keep their mission open, but
Moscow's East bloc allies were considering closing. Most
non-communist nations have ordered their diplomats to leave
Afghanistan by Saturday.
   West Germany closed its mission a week ago, the first nation to
do so. The United States announced Thursday that it would withdraw
its diplomats, and Britain, Japan, France and Austria followed suit.
   At a news conference in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital,
Burhanuddin Rabbani, chief of the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla group,
accused the Soviets of sending warplanes into Afghanistan to bomb
villages.
   ``The bombing has been very severe for the last three days,
leaving hundreds of casualties, and destroying dozens of villages,''
he said.
   Rabbani appealed to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Peres de
Cuellar to stop the destruction.
   Villages along the strategic 260-mile Salang Highway, which leads
to Kabul from the Soviet border, were among the targets, Rabbani
said. The road is the main land route for the Red Army's withdrawal.
   Western diplomats reported Thursday that Soviets and the elite
Afghan Special Guard bombed and shelled villages on the northern and
southern ends of Salang Highway on Monday.
   They quoted eyewitnesses as saying that hundreds of civilians
were killed in those attacks. The area is dominated by guerrilla
commander Ahmad Shah Masood, who belongs to Rabbani's group.
   The guerrillas, backed by the United States and Pakistan, have
been fighting the Afghan government since a Marxist coup in 1978.
They are not a party to the U.N. agreement and are expected to close
in on Najib's government once the Soviet withdrawal is complete.
   For their part, the guerrillas have continued to rocket Kabul and
other major cities. They fired four rockets into the capital
Saturday, said a U.N. official who requested anonymity. He said no
one was killed in the shelling.
   The government's troops fired eight missiles into hills
surrounding the city. There were no reports of casualties.
   Two Soviet military transport planes carrying about 60 passengers
each flew out of Kabul on Saturday. Helicopter gunships escorted the
aircraft over the snow-covered hills and the planes dropped a
cascade of flares designed to deflect heat-seeking missiles fired by
the guerrillas.
   Other Soviet transport planes airlifted emergency food and fuel
to the embattled city.
   Convoys tailed by tanks hauled flour to silos and fuel to
gasoline stations, where lines as long as a half-mile began forming
before dawn.
   Shortages have eased since the Soviet airlift began last week,
but many Afghans, some wearing only light cotton clothing and
sandals, waited for hours in freezing weather for bread and
gasoline. Many went home without either.

   Robert B. Kelly, a retired Navy captain
whose combat experience as a PT boat commander in the Pacific during
World War II became the basis for the best-selling book and movie
``They Were Expendable,'' has died of pneumonia. He was 75.
   The former naval officer died Monday at Howard County General
Hospital.
   Kelly was executive officer of the famed Motor Torpedo Boat
Squadron 3. He won a Navy Cross, the Navy's highest decoration after
the Medal of Honor, for sinking a Japanese light cruiser off the
island of Luzon in the Philippines on the night of April 8, 1942.
   He was commander of the lead boat in the four-craft PT boat
squadron that evacuated Gen. Douglas MacArthur, his family and staff
by night from the island of Corregidor, where the U.S. forces were
trapped by the Japanese army, on March 11, 1942. He was awarded a
Silver Star for that effort.
   Later in the war, Kelly was commander of a PT boat squadron in
the Solomon Islands, where he won a second Silver Star for action in
combat against the Japanese. One of the men serving under him was
Lt. John F. Kennedy, whose boat, PT 109, sank after it was rammed by
a Japanese destroyer on the night of Aug. 2, 1943.
   Kelly was a native of New York City and a 1935 graduate of the
U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis.
   Author William L. White based ``They Were Expendable'' on the
experience of Squadron 3 in the Philippines, and actor John Wayne
played the part of Kelly in the 1945 movie.
   His wife, Barbara Lee Benedict Kelly, said her husband called the
Pacific fleet ``expendable'' because the Navy could get few supplies
to it around the Japanese forces.
   ``There was very little support for the Pacific fleet at the
time. He said, `We were expendable.' Human lives didn't mean that
much at the time,'' she said.
   After the war, Kelly taught marine engineering at the Naval
Academy and served at the Naval War College. He retired from the
Navy in 1961 after having served as deputy chief of staff of the
Navy's Caribbean command.
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons and one
daughter. Funeral services will Monday at Memorial Chapel at
Arlington National Cemetery, followed by a graveside service with
full military honors.

<HEAD>India To Broaden Role in Cambodian Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India will step up its efforts to end the
Cambodian conflict by sending a Cabinet minister to Indonesia to
take part in next month's informal peace talks, news reports said
Saturday.
   The Press Trust of India said K. Natwar Singh, minister of state
for external affairs, will leave Sunday for Jakarta, the Indonesian
capital.
   Singh's departure was announced a day after Vietnamese leader
Nguyen Van Linh ended a five-day visit to New Delhi.
   Linh, secretary-general of Vietnam's Communist Party, told
reporters Friday that India ``deserves a major role (in the peace
talks) because it is on the side of the developing countries and
newly independent nations.''
   The second round of informal talks aimed at the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia are to be held from Feb. 10-21 in
Jakarta. At least one of three factions opposing the Hanoi-backed
Cambodian government and the six members of the noncommunist
Association of South East Nations will attend.
   Resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk has said he will not
attend the meeting because Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen rejected
his proposal that an international peacekeeping force supervise the
withdrawal of Vietnamese forces.
   Preparations for the meeting were continuing and Indonesia is
awaiting word whether Sihanouk's son, Norodom Nararidh, will head
the delegation of his father's faction, Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said in Jakarta.
   The Khmer Rouge faction has not confirmed its attendance but Son
Sann, the leader of the third resistance group, will participate in
the talks, Alatas said.
   Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian delegations will also attend
the discussions.
   Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in 1978 and set up a pro-Hanoi
government in Phnom Penh. Vietnam says it will pull its 50,000
troops out of Cambodia by 1990 or perhaps sooner if a political
solution is reached.
   The Association of South East Asian Nations, which supports the
three-faction resistance coalition, groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.

   An 11-year-old was raped by her father
and 14-year-old brother and forced to watch her parents perform
sexual acts, police said.
   James and Eileen Robles, both 30, and their son were arrested
Friday night, said Southampton police Lt. Thomas Peyton.
   He said the girl had told friends of the family of the incidents,
and the friends called police. Investigators alleged that sometime
in September, and also on Thanksgiving Day, James Robles had sexual
intercourse with his daughter.
   Investigators also determined that the 14-year-old had sexual
intercourse with the girl on numerous occasions in September, Peyton
said.
   Mrs. Robles allegedly forced her daughter to watch her and her
husband perform sexual acts, Peyton said. She was charged with two
counts of endangering the welfare of a minor.
   Robles was charged with two counts of second-degree rape, incest
and two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor.
   The son, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile,
was charged with first-degree rape, sodomy and incest.
   Peyton said the daughter was placed in the state's protective
custody program.
   All three were arraigned Saturday and were being held in lieu of
$5,000 bail each, he said.

   The United Nations should arbitrarily set a
date for resuming Persian Gulf peace talks despite objections from
Iran, Iraq's foreign minister said Saturday.
   Tariq Aziz called on the U.N. officials to pressure Iran into
returning to the negotiating table.
   ``The secretary-general and his personal representative are
duty-bound now to fix a date for resuming the peace talks at a date
which they find appropriate, and they should not allow Iran to put
any preconditions on resumption of talks,'' Aziz said, according to
the official Iraqi News Agency.
   Tariq Aziz comments came at the end of the first day of talks
with a team of U.N. officials headed by special envoy Jan Eliasson,
who arrived from Tehran Friday on a mission to revive the stalled
negotations.
   A spokesman for the U.N. delegation, Gianni Picco, would not
comment on the content of Saturday's discussions or say whether the
face-to-face negotiations would resume soon.
   ``We are working to make progress in implementing U.N. Resolution
598,'' he said, referring to the Security Council resolution that
outlined a cease-fire and peace treaty in the 8-year gulf war.
   ``We will leave no stone unturned in trying to achieve that,'' he
added.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the gulf war took effect Aug. 20
but peace talks that began five days later in Geneva broke down
immediately over the issue of troop withdrawals to prewar borders.
   Two further rounds of negotiations brought no progress and no
date was set for them to resume.
   Earlier this week, Eliasson, held four days of talks in Iran with
officials there.
   Iran has demanded that before the peace talks resume, the two
sides should agree to full implementation of Resolution 598,
including the troop withdrawals.
   The U.N. resolution calls on Iran and Iraq to ``halt all military
activities'' and honor the truce, withdraw troops to pre-war
borders, exchange around 100,000 prisoners of war and start peace
talks.
   Iran has accused Baghdad of blocking a peace agreement by
refusing to withdraw from Iranian territory, but Iraq says it will
not pull out until Iran gives up the right to search Iraq-bound
ships in the gulf for war cargo.

<TEXT>
   Sinhalese extremists shot and killed a
candidate for next month's Parliament election, bringing to 10 the
number of candidates slain this month, officials said Saturday.
   Punchibanda Ratnayake was shot to death Friday night in Welimadu,
about 75 miles east of Colombo, police said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Ratnayake, a Sinhalese, was a member of the opposition Sri Lanka
Freedom Party.
   A senior election department official said 10 candidates for the
Feb. 15 parliamentary elections have been killed since nominations
closed Jan. 6.
   Police had put the total at 10 before Ratnayake was killed. But
the election official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that was incorrect.
   He said six of the slain candidates belonged to the Freedom
Party, two to the leftist United Socialist Alliance, one to
President Ranasinghe Premadasa's governing United National Party and
one to the Sri Lanka Tamil Congress party.
   Seven of the victims were Sinhalese, two were Tamils and one was
Moslem.
   Police blamed the latest killing and most of the others on the
People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group. However,
they said two Tamil candidates killed in the northern Jaffna region
were victims of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a separatist
guerrilla group that has been fighting the government since 1983.
   Both the Tigers and the People's Liberation Front have vowed to
disrupt the elections for the 225-seat Parliament.
   Police said the front has killed more than 60 people, most of
them political party supporters, in the last three days.
   The Tigers have rejected the government's offer of partial
autonomy for northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where most Tamils live.
The Tigers are seeking an independent homeland for their ethnic
minority.
   The People's Liberation Front started attacking the government
and other Sinhalese politicians last year, saying too many
concessions were being made to the Tamil minority.
   Sinhalese make up about 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people and dominate the government and military. Tamils comprise
about 18 percent and say they are discriminated against by the
Sinhalese.
   Most Tamils are Hindus, and most Sinhalese are Buddhists.
   The Moslems, who claim descent from Arab traders, account for
about 7 percent of the population.
   There is also a tiny Christian minority, consisting of
descendants of European colonists and converts among the Sinhalese
and Tamil communities.

<HEAD>Khamenei: Women In The West Are Pleasure Objects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei deplored
the plight of women in Western society on Saturday and said their
real rights are safeguarded only by Islam, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   ``In stark contrast to the honor and respect accorded to women in
Islam, the West has degraded women to the meanest level,'' the news
agency quoted Khamenei as saying.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted him as saying that women
in the West have been reduced to ``mere objects of pleasure,''
despite alleged strides toward achieving equal rights.
   The Iranian president was speaking at the opening of a seminar on
women held to mark the anniversary of the birth of Fatima, daughter
of the Prophet Mohammed who founded the Islamic faith.
   Khamenei criticized the Western ``culture of permissiveness and
nudity which gives man a free rein to exploit and insult woman's
personality,'' the agency said.
   Despite official claims that under the Islamic regime, Iranian
women enjoy more rights than ever, women are still considered
second-class citizens in Iran and are strictly segregated from men
in public.
   One of the first decrees of the Islamic revolution that overthrew
the Western-oriented government of the late Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi 10 years ago was that women should cover themselves from
head to foot in public.
   Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, also
reduced the legal age for women to marry from 18 to 13 soon after
coming to power in 1979.
   The tradition of ``siqeh,'' a form of legalized prostitution
which was frowned on by the Shah and is condoned by the Islamic
government, has become common practice in Iran.
   Permitted by Shiite Islam, the largest breakaway sect from the
orthodox Sunni Islam, the practice of ``siqeh'' allows ``a temporary
marriage of a night, a week, a month or a year,'' between men and
women.
   Under Islam, a man is also allowed four wives, but a woman is
only allowed one husband.

<HEAD>Historian Says Freed War Criminals Responsible For Anne Frank's Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Nazi war criminals freed after
43 years of imprisonment in the Netherlands were indirectly
responsible for sending Anne Frank to the death camps, a historian
said Saturday.
   But there is no direct link between the Dutch Jewish girl who
died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and the two Germans,
said Loe de Jong, considered the nation's foremost authority on
World War II.
   Franz Fischer, 87, and 79-year-old Ferdinand aus der Fuenten were
deported to West Germany on Friday. The two were high-ranking Nazi
officials responsible for sending thousands of Dutch Jews to their
deaths during World War II.
   Only 6,000 of the Netherlands' 150,000 Jews survived Nazi
persecution.
   ``The group that arrested the (Frank) family in Amsterdam
operated under the command of aus der Fuenten and aus der Fuenten
worked under the instructions of Fischer,'' De Jong told The
Associated Press.
   ``It would be correct to say they had indirect responsibility''
for Anne Frank's fate.
   De Jong is the author of the 14-volume ``History of the Kingdom
of the Netherlands in World War II,'' a government-commissioned
study.
   Anne Frank and her family were arrested by a German police unit
known as the Green Police in August 1944, and were first deported to
the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-held Poland.
   Anne later was moved to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in
Germany, where she died of pneumonia in 1945 at age 15.
   From June 1942 until her arrest, Anne wrote her diary as the
Franks hid in a secret section of an Amsterdam canal house closed
off from the rest of the building by a bookshelf.
   The book, perhaps the most famous personal document to come out
of the Holocaust, was published in 1947 and was turned into a play
and movie.
   Fischer ran the Hague-based Jewish Section of the Nazi Security
Service (SS). In that capacity, ``he gave guidelines ... about which
Jews should be rounded up,'' De Jong said.
   Aus der Fuenten, an SS administrator who ran what was cynically
called the Central Directorate for Jewish Emigration, oversaw the
deportations of thousands of Jews from Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The
Hague.
   Fischer and aus der Fuenten were sentenced to death in 1950, but
their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment a year later.
   They were the world's only war criminals who had been jailed
since World War II, according to the government, which said keeping
them here any longer would violate the principle of equality before
the law.
   The Netherlands has pardoned and freed 107 other war criminals
who had been sentenced to death.

<TEXT>
   Congress is poised to put President Bush's
pledge of bipartisanship to the test as it tackles the year's
overarching foreign-policy dilemma: How to be a world power on a
limited budget.
   Along with an agenda that includes placing new curbs on chemical
warfare, escalating the war on drugs around the world, and keeping
an eye on hot spots from Central America to the Middle East and
southern Africa, Congress may try to shoehorn growing U.S. financial
obligations into a shrinking foreign aid bill.
   ``That would be very dangerous, in my judgment,'' said Rep. Dante
Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
``You obviously reduce the influence of the United States. There's a
limit to the influence you can exert without money.''
   U.S. policy-makers have long found direct foreign aid among the
best tools for extending American influence abroad and encouraging
behavior friendly to American interests.
   ``Persuasion is good, but there comes a point where you have to
discuss programs,'' Fascell said in a recent interview. ``We are at
the very bottom limit. It affects posts abroad, morale, the way
other nations look at us.''
   On the other hand, foreign aid bills do not enjoy much popularity
in Congress because voters generally are not keen on sending U.S.
tax dollars to other countries.
   Some of the money goes for economic development and humanitarian
aid, some $5.2 billion in the current fiscal year. A larger amount,
$7.7 billion is classified as ``security assistance,'' and includes
grants of weaponry.
   But a severe financial squeeze is on the horizon. Bush and
congressional leaders have promised an array of potentially
expensive new domestic programs, from fighting drugs to alleviating
homelessness, at a time of severe budget constraints.
   In the foreign aid area, an increase in the flow of refugees
worldwide, new United Nations peacekeeping forces in southern
African and Afghanistan and new commitments to countries like the
Philippines where the United States maintains military bases will
put other aid programs into the budget vise.
   It is up to Fascell's committee, its Senate counterpart and the
House and Senate Appropriations committees to design programs and
policies that will fit into the new down-sized budget, a process
that is bound to be painful and strain bipartisanship.
   One possible avenue is to emphasize punishments, rather than
rewards, in seeking to influence other nations' behavior. But there
is broad disagreement on how well economic, diplomatic or trade
sanctions work.
   Fascell pointed out the drug problem as an example. Current U.S.
law calls for the president to certify annually, and for Congress to
accept, that countries on a State Department list of
drug-trafficking and producing points are ``fully cooperating'' with
anti-drug efforts.
   Such certifications have been hotly debated in the past, and
decertification action _ even if only threatened _ has damaged
relations with friendly countries. While pursuing one goal, the drug
war, objectives of economic and political stability are lost.
   Fascell said the certification system may need to be revamped,
and the United States may need to assume more of the responsibility
for its drug problem.
   ``We can't blame others for our problems,'' he said. ``We're the
problem. It isn't them. It is affecting our foreign policy
capability. We have to rethink how much of a sanction you can put on
another government.''
   Among other problems likely to be high on Congress' foreign
affairs agenda this year:
   _U.S.-Soviet relations. Lawmakers are of two minds: Some worry
that Bush will move too slowly and forfeit opportunities for further
arms control progress under the moderate leadership of Mikhail
Gorbachev; others fear that Gorbachev is merely taking a breather
before resuming expansionist policies and that he may be seeking to
split the NATO alliance.
   _War powers. Congress and the White House will continue their
long battle over who has the power to commit U.S. troops to world
hot spots. ``I can almost guarantee you that unless we find an
answer ... the hope and desire of both of us to have a bipartisan
foreign policy is going to be impossible,'' Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said at a
recent confirmation hearing for Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   _The spread of chemical weapons. Several members of Congress have
vowed to press for legislation that would penalize companies that
sell equipment used to produce chemical weapons, and to impose
sanctions on governments that use, produce or store poison gases or
biological weapons.
   _Central America. The focus is likely to shift from Nicaragua,
where the new Bush team seems to be taking a less confrontational
approach toward the leftist Sandinista government, to El Salvador,
which holds a presidential election in March. The right-wing Arena
party, which already controls the country's legislature and in the
past has been linked with death-squad activity, is heavily favored
to win the presidency.
   _Panama. It has been a year since ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega
was indicted by a U.S. grand jury on drug charges, but sanctions
have apparently not loosened his grip on the country. A 1991
deadline looms for U.S. approval of a native Panamanian commissioner
for the canal, complicated by continued bad relations between the
two countries.
   _Environmental issues. A growing group of senators want to put
environmental protection on the world agenda, hoping to create
multilateral forums to discuss issues like global warming, acid rain
and deforestation.

<TEXT>
   Mourners at the funeral of a
slain anti-apartheid leader on Saturday chased away police who tried
to remove a banner bearing the name of an outlawed political group.
   An estimated 5,000 people attended the funeral of Dr. Abu Baker
Asvat, a physician and a founding member of the Azanian Peoples
Organization. He was fatally shot in his medical office Friday in
the black township of Soweto.
   About a dozen white policemen in civilian clothes arrived at the
Avalon Cemetery, which is shared by Soweto and the Indian township
of Lenasia, and tried to pull away a banner with the group's name on
it from four mourners.
   Men began chanting in Arabic, ``God is great,'' and descending on
the policemen, some of whom pulled their guns. The officers then
turned and ran toward their van and drove away.
   No motive is known for the killing of Asvat, an Indian doctor who
ran programs for squatters and homeless people and participated in
education and health programs in Soweto.
   Police and relatives said two black men entered the doctor's
offices, one pretending to be a patient and giving a false name.
They left, returned later with a gun and fired two shots at Asvat,
killing him immediately, then fled.
   Leaders of the banned Azanian Peoples Organization, which
believes blacks should fight for their own political rights without
white help, blamed ``agents of the apartheid system'' for Asvat's
death in speeches at the funeral.
   The group is one of more than 30 anti-apartheid groups the
government banned in 1988.
   Meanwhile, a building housing three black trade unions in East
London, in the eastern Cape province, was gutted by fire Saturday
morning, the South African Press Association reported. It was the
fourth arson attack in as many months against black trade union
offices in the city.
   Police in the black homeland of Ciskei, near East London,
reported four bombs exploded Friday at a small airplane factory and
a post office. No one was injured.
   President P.W. Botha, recovering from a stroke he suffered 10
days before, walked around the garden of his Cape Town residence
Saturday and is recovering ``remarkably quickly,'' his medical team
reported.
   The 73-year-old Botha has been advised to rest for at least five
weeks, the doctors said in a statement.
   He has named Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis as
acting president and Heunis will open Parliament on Friday in a
subdued ceremony without the usual parades and pomp, the government
announced.

   A hundred Haitian cane
cutters were crammed ``like animals'' into a truck driven by a
drunken man who drove the vehicle off a cliff, survivors said
Saturday. The crash killed 48 people.
   The Central Workers Union and the Majority Workers Center
denounced the brutal treatment of Haitian cane cutters and accused
the government of ``practicing slavery.''
   Officials said it was the worst traffic accident ever in the
Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola
with Haiti.
   The truck plunged from a cliff early Friday about 22 miles north
of Santo Domingo. Those killed included six children and three women.
   In an interview published Saturday by the Santo Domingo newspaper
Ultima Hora, one of the Haitian survivors, Manuel Yang, said the
Haitians were recruited near the border by a Dominican
``trafficker'' and smuggled to a military barracks in the Dominican
border town of Dajabon.
   ``After being kept prisoners for two days, two tall men and two
soldiers took us out,'' he told the newspaper. ``We were fed and
loaded on a truck ... like animals.''
   Ultimo Hora quoted Yang as saying the truck driver told the
Haitians if they gave him money to buy rum they ``would not be taken
to cut cane but rather would be taken someplace else whre there was
better work.''
   Police on Saturday were still looking for the driver. Survivors
said he had been drinking when he missed a curve shortly after
midnight Friday and flung himself from the truck, which rolled down
a hill.
   Red Cross workers and soldiers found more than 20 bodies trapped
under the overturned truck 10 hours after the accident. Others were
sprawled around the area.
   The 36 people injured were being treated at Santo Domingo
hospitals.
   Every year Dominicans recruit about 19,000 poor Haitians at low
wages for the tortuous work of cutting sugar cane, the backbone of
the country's economy.
   Amnesty International and the International Organization of Labor
have accused the Dominican government of practicing slavery with
Haitian cane cutters.
   Before Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in
1986, he received more than $1 million a year from the Dominicans in
exchange for Haitian cane cutters, a practice widely condemned by
international human rights groups.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow In Colorado, Rain On Plains, Temp Records Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm spread up to 23 inches of snow across Colorado on
Saturday, making driving hazardous and slowing air traffic, and also
poured soaking rain across the south-central part of the nation.
   Temperatures hit record highs around the Great Lakes, while a
bitter cold snap continued in Alaska with an unofficial record
Saturday morning low of 86 below zero.
   Denver's Stapleton International Airport had flight delays
running about two hours Saturday morning, said airport operations
chief Richard Boulware.
   There were ``a lot of fender benders'' for motorists in the
Denver metro area, according to a dispatcher at the Colorado State
Patrol.
   Echo Lake reported 23 inches by midday, while Conifer had 18
inches Saturday morning. Fourteen inches had fallen in parts of
Aurora, with 13 inches near Evergreen and at Wolf Creek Pass, 8
inches at Stapleton airport and at Durango, and 6 inches at Fort
Collins and Walsenburg.
   Wind gusted to 52 mph in Colorado's southeastern foothills,
reducing visibility with blowing snow, and Teller County, south of
Denver, had near blizzard conditions early in the day with 1-foot
snowdrifts reported.
   A winter storm warning was issued for the Front Range of the
Colorado Rockies and at higher elevations west and north of Colorado
Springs.
   The storm, centered over south-central Colorado, pulled moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the central and southern
Plains, and the middle Mississippi Valley. A good soaking rain fell
across the eastern part of the central Plains and lower Missouri
Valley and showers and thunderstorms produced heavier rain over
north-central and northeastern Texas.
   One to two inches of rain fell in the Dallas-Fort Worth area
during the morning. Hico, in northern Hamilton County, measured 1.70
and Dallas reported 1.33 inches in the six hours up to 1 p.m. Flash
flood watches were issued.
   North of the rain, snow moved into southwestern Nebraska, with
isolated freezing rain over central Nebraska, and sections of
Interstate 80 were reported slippery.
   Temperatures were in the 40s and 50s across much of the nation
east of the Mississippi River, and around the Great Lakes record
highs included 45 at Alpena, Mich., 36 at Duluth, Minn., and 41 at
Marquette, Mich.
   But in Alaska, even through winters normally are cold, people
wrapped fuel-oil lines with insulation to keep the oil flowing and
called crews to thaw out buried sewer pipes as a week-old record
cold snap continued.
   Alaska's unofficial low for Saturday morning was 86 degrees below
zero at McGrath, which would break the old record for the date of 80
below set at Prospect Creek in 1971 if it were official, the
National Weather Service reported. The official low was 69 below
zero at Tanana. Other official lows included minus 24 at Anchorage
and minus 49 at Fairbanks.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 1 degree
below zero at Jackson, Wyo., to 83 at Naples, Fla. Saturday
morning's low in the lower 48 states was 15 degrees below zero at
Idaho Falls, Idaho, and Jackson, Wyo.
   For Sunday, widespread rain was forecast from the eastern half of
Kansas through the middle Mississippi Valley and Arkansas into the
lower Ohio Valley. Scattered showers and thundershowers were
forecast over the lower Mississippi Valley.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted in the central Intermountain
region between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges,
and across northern Maine; in the 50s over western Washington state
and the Black Hills of western South Dakota; in the 50s and 60s from
much of California across Arizona into New Mexico, and from the Rio
Grande Valley of Texas through Arkansas and the Tennessee Valley to
the mid Atlantic Coast; in the 70s over the northern California
valleys and in the Los Angeles basin, and from the southern tip of
Texas through the central Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic Coast
and northern Florida; in the 80s across southern Florida; and in the
30s or 40s across much of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Paper Says Government Troops Decimated in Border Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Angolan government troops was
``decimated'' in early January while setting up a monitoring post in
southern Angola near the Namibian border, the Lisbon newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The weekly Expresso said the troops were attacked while setting
up one of the posts designed to monitor an Aug. 8 cease-fire between
Angola and South Africa along the border.
   The paper said its information was first-hand from Luanda but
named no sources.
   Following the attack, Angola ``established intense diplomatic
contacts'' with South Africa to find out the cause of the incident,
but Pretoria denied its forces were involved, Expresso said.
   The rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
also has not claimed responsibility for the attack in its regular
statements issued in Lisbon.
   Angolan officials have accused South Africa of continuing to
supply the rebels through the unpatrolled border section.
   Pretoria claims the area allows activists of the South West
African People's Organization to slip in and out of Namibia.
   The Angolan rebels have their main Jamba base about 19 miles from
the Namibian border and claim control of the region.
   They have warned repeatedly that hostile forces found in the
area, including members of a 10-nation, U.N. monitoring force, would
be attacked.
   Angolan military officials have said they would have to send an
armed contingent into the unpatrolled area to oust the rebels, but
that would allow South Africa to accuse them of violating the
cease-fire agreement.
   The agreement states there can be no substantial troop movements
on either side of the border.
   Expresso did not say whether the attacked troops formed part of a
military operation against the Angolan rebels.
   Under accords signed Dec. 22 in New York by Angola, Cuba and
South Africa, Pretoria pledged to cease aid to the Angolan rebels
and to give independence to Namibia.
   In return, Angola promised to end support to African nationalist
activists and Cuba agreed to withdraw 50,000 troops that supported
Angola's Marxist government in its fight against the rebels.

<HEAD>Sharon Says No Peace Possible While Arafat Lives</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Rabin claiming U.S. support for
peace plan, details of death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon said Saturday
there will be no peace in the Middle East as long as Yasser Arafat
``runs around alive'' and that Israel must do more to counteract the
PLO leader's peace initiative.
   Sharon's comments in an interview with Israel radio reflected ``a
personal opinion that Arafat should be killed,'' his spokesman,
Moshe Behagon, told The Associated Press. ``He says many times that
if it were possible, he would want to kill him.''
   Also Saturday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said U.S. officials
support his peace plan that includes elections in the occupied
territories in exchange for a cease-fire in the Palestinan uprising,
Israel television reported.
   One Palestinian protester was reported fatally shot in the
territories Saturday. Arab news reports said at least 10 people,
including a boy, either were shot and wounded or beaten in clashes
between soldiers and stone-throwers in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   The army confirmed four woundings by plastic bullets.
   The death raised to 370 the number of Palestinians killed in the
nearly 14-month-old uprising. Fifteen Israelis also have died.
   Sharon's remarks come amid growing debate over the nation's
policy toward the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel's
response to the 13-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories.
   ``As long as Arafat runs around alive around us, there will never
be peace,'' Sharon said. ``No Arab leader will be ready to meet with
us for fear for his life. And no Palestinian will be ready to talk
because if he does so while Arafat is alive, his fate is sealed.''
   Sharon seemed to be alluding to repeated threats from leaders of
the PLO-supported uprising against Palestinians who cooperate with
the Israelis. More than a dozen alleged collaborators have been
killed during the uprising.
   Once the nation's defense minister, Sharon was forced from the
post in 1983 after Israel's militia allies in Lebanon massacred
Palestinians in Beirut.
   Israel denounces the PLO as terrorists and refuses to talk with
it. The nation protested bitterly when the United States opened
talks with the PLO last month. But there are growing calls for
Israel to change its policy.
   Rabin, a leader of the Labor party, said he has won support from
leading U.S. officials for a peace plan he published last week that
offers elections in the territories in exchange for a cease-fire in
the uprising, Israel television reported.
   The plan has been rejected by both the PLO and underground
leaders of the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But the television quoted Rabin as telling a reporter that U.S.
officials have indicated that the plan was a ``possible basis'' for
a settlement to the Palestinian issue.
   However, Sharon said: ``Any attempt in or out of the government
that tries to explain why we should speak to the PLO, only paves the
way for and lends legitimacy to other governments to talk to
Arafat.''
   Arafat began his latest peace initiative in December when he said
the PLO renounced terrorism and recognized Israel. Last week he
traveled to Spain, where he was received for the first time by
Western European leaders.
   Israel radio said a 23-year-old died after troops shot him in a
West Bank village near Bethlehem. The army confirmed the death but
said it was investigating the circumstances and gave no other
details.
   Two other Palestinians were wounded in the same clash in the
village of Sureif, while two others were wounded in a village near
the West Bank city of Nablus, the army said.
   Two Palestinian teen-agers from the Balata refugee camp near
Nablus were also treated for beating injuries to the face, said the
reports and an official at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus.
   At least four other woundings occurred in Gaza, Arab news reports
said. The army confirmed three, including that of a 3-year-old boy,
from plastic bullets fired at stone-throwing protesters.

<HEAD>Famed Poet Remembered On 50th Anniversary of His Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DRUMCLIFF, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Admirers of the great Irish poet and
playwright William Butler Yeats filled Drumcliff Church on Saturday
to mark the 50th anniversary of his death and remember his literary
legacy.
   A lone army piper played a lament and a choristers from a local
school sang as Yeats' son and daughter, Michael and Anne Yeats,
joined in the memorial service.
   On the poet's grave in the churchyard lay a single rose and a
wreath from the Yeats Society, bearing the brief inscription
``Memories.''
   Yeats, a founder of Dublin's renowned Abbey Theater and winner of
the 1923 Nobel Prize in literature, died in France on Jan. 28, 1939,
at the age of 73 and was buried there temporarily.
   After World War II, his body was returned to Ireland for burial
in a state funeral in 1948 where he wished to be buried _ at
Drumcliff in the shadow of Ben Bulben mountain by the church where
his grandfather had been rector.
   Archbishop of Dublin Donald Caird told the congregation: ``World
acclaim, the Nobel Prize and the offer to have his body buried in
St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin did not prevail against the poet's
simple wish to be buried in Drumcliff churchyard.''
   The churchyard is mentioned in Yeats' 1938 poem ``Under Ben
Bulben,'' which reads in part: ``Under bare Ben Bulben's head, in
Drumcliff churchyard Yeats is laid.''
   Yeat's epitaph, which he chose from the same poem, is seen by
thousands of visitors who pay their respects each year in this
County Sligo hamlet at the head of Drumcliff Bay on the west coast
of Ireland:
   ``Cast a cold Eye
   ``On Life, on Death
   ``Horseman, pass by!''
   Dublin-born Yeats was an ardent nationalist and traditionalist
who served as a senator in the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1928,
helped found the Irish National Theater Company, and with George
Bernard Shaw and poet-economist G.W. Russell founded the Irish
Academy of Letters in 1932.

<HEAD>Hungary Likely To Drop ``People's Republic'' From Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is likely to shed its
``people's republic'' designation and adopt its pre-communist coat
of arms, the Hungarian state news agency MTI reported.
   A parliamentary committee rewriting the constitution is
considering the move, as well as including human rights provisions
and political reform in the document that will likely be approved by
a voter referendum, the news agency said late Friday.
   Members of the panel said it was ``quite superfluous'' to add
epithets such as ``democratic'' or ``socialist'' to the designation
``republic of Hungary'' in a new constitution now being prepared,
MTI said Friday.
   Hungary's present official name is Magyar Nepkoeztarsasag or
Hungarian People's Republic. That name will be changed in the new
constitution, MTI said.
   Lawyers on the committee argued the constitution, not the
designation of the state, should reflect the democratic and
socialist system in Hungary, the news agency said.
   Lawmakers also proposed that the first chapter of the
constitution should lay down human rights and obligations, MTI
reported.
   Several deputies said a coat of arms, including the St. Stephen's
crown, which is kept in Parliament, would be the most suitable
symbol of statehood, while others favored the Kossuth coat of arms,
which does not contain the crown.
   The current Hungarian coat of arms was fashioned after the Soviet
model, featuring two sheaves forming a circle.
   The Kossuth coat of arms was used for a while in the wake of the
1848 uprising against Hapsburg rule.
   Constitutional committee members agreed that the prime minister
should in future be elected by Parliament and be obliged to
introduce his government to the chamber, MTI said.
   They also supported the idea that the president of the republic
should have genuine powers but he should not be entitled to dissolve
parliament, because a strong presidential system might lead toward a
personality cult.
   MTI quoted Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar as saying that the
draft of the constitution would be discussed by various
organizations, including alternative groups outside the ruling
Communist Party, in the coming weeks.
   After going before the party's policy-setting Central Committee
and then parliament on March 8, the text of the constitution will be
completed by June 8, presented ``for public debate'' in the second
half of the year and again submitted to Parliament in December this
year.
   ``If Parliament approves the new constitution, it will most
probably be subject to a referendum,'' MTI said.

   Space workers and tourists stood
silently Saturday for 73 seconds, the length of the fatal Challenger
flight, to remember the seven astronauts who died in the fiery
shuttle explosion three years ago.
   About 350 peace activists marked the anniversary with a rally
outside a Kennedy Space Center gate to protest the launch of Defense
Department payloads aboard space shuttles. Four women were arrested
for trespassing when they deliberately walked into an off-limits
area.
   Tour buses stopped in their tracks, and engineers, technicians
and support crews halted activity as flags at the Kennedy Space
Center were lowered to half-staff at 11:38 a.m., the moment when
Challenger lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986.
   ``It's an appropriate way to mark the occasion, leaving it to the
individuals on how they want to remember it,'' said Forrest S.
McCartney, the center director.
   Only about 1,000 of the center's 17,000 employees were at work
Saturday, but hundreds of tourists joined them in the tribute.
   Meanwhile, a Challenger memorial was dedicated Saturday in
downtown Miami.
   ``It wasn't until we lost Challenger that the American public
realized that space travel is dangerous,'' said U.S. Rep. Bill
Nelson, speaking at the Challenger Seven dedication at Bayfront
Park. Nelson, a Florida Democrat, rode on a shuttle mission just two
weeks before the Challenger disaster.
   The 105-foot white sculpture, shaped like a twisting girder, was
designed by Japanese-American artist Isamu Noguchi, who died in
December.
   On Friday, space workers at the cape paused briefly to honor the
Challenger crew a day before the anniversary.
   McCartney said in a televised message: ``We won't forget the
sacrifice made by these seven fallen heroes. We promised them we'd
push on in the years to come, to fly the space shuttle again. ...
We're fulfilling that promise.''
   The peace activist demonstration was organized by the Florida
Coalition for Peace and Justice. Among those participating was
former Apollo astronaut Ed Mitchell, who walked on the moon in 1971.
   Mitchell told the group that military reconnaissance and
navigation satellites have a place in space because they help keep
the peace.
   ``That's not true about putting weapons in space,'' he said,
specifically mentioning the Strategic Defense Initiative program
whose goal is to deploy an anti-missile system in orbit.
   Following an afternoon of speeches and songs, the demonstrators
had a peaceful confrontation with security guards at a center gate
near the headquarters building. After being warned that anyone
passing through the gate would be arrested, four women entered.
   They were booked and given a court appearance date. Organizers
had announced before the rally that some planned to trespass as part
of the protest.
   A group of men wearing Ku Klux Klan robes stood by to protest
what the demonstrators were advocating.
   Killed in the Challenger tragedy were Dick Scobee, Michael Smith,
Judy Resnik, Ellison Onizuka, Ron McNair, Greg Jarvis and
schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.
   McNair's brother, Eric McNair of Atlanta, said at a ceremony in
nearby Cocoa Beach Saturday and it is important to remember the
Challenger explosion ``so we will not forget what happened,
lessening the chances of it happening again.''
   The accident was blamed on a faulty booster rocket joint that
allowed flame to escape and touch off the shuttle's external fuel
tank.
   The three remaining shuttles were grounded for 32 months while
modifications were made. Discovery made the first post-Challenger
flight last September and was followed by Atlantis in December.
   Discovery is being readied for another flight in late February,
although engine turbopump problems could delay that mission.

<HEAD>Report Says Britain To Pull Troops From Gibraltar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper report that Britain will withdraw more
than half its troops from Gibraltar was described by the Ministry of
Defense on Saturday as ``speculative.''
   Early editions of The Sunday Times said the government would pull
more than 1,000 troops out of the British colony and shut down many
military facilities there.
   It said the foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, would announce
``a study to review British defense commitments'' during a visit to
Gibraltar on Monday.
   The paper said Defense Ministry and Foreign Office sources
confirmed a decision had been made to withdraw the troops _ more
than half the 1,900 British forces based there.
   A Ministry of Defense spokesman said Saturday night: ``This
report is speculative. Force levels are kept under constant review.
When ministers come to a decision on any change we will make an
announcement.''
   The Sunday Times quoted a Ministry of Defense source as saying,
``Now that Spain is a member of NATO, there are insufficient
military reasons to maintain such a large presence, which costs a
lot of money.''
   British control of Gibraltar is a highly sensitive issue between
Britain and Spain, which claims that the 2.2 square mile colony at
the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula is rightfully Spanish.
   Britain, which was ceded Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht,
has used it as a base for nearly 300 years, currently for troop
training and munition stores as well as for an airport, dockyards
and a navy base.
   The colony's 28,700 inhabitants have made clear they wish
Gibraltar to remain British.

<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A PLO official on Saturday
urged the United States to upgrade its talks with the Palestinian
group and perhaps move the discussions to Washington.
   ``We believe the dialogue must be on a higher level, that is if
we wanted to be serious,'' Mahmoud Abbas, a Palestine Liberation
Organization executive committee member, said in an interview with
The Associated Press.
   Abbas, also known by his guerrilla code-name of Abu Mazen, said
the PLO ``is trying to upgrade the level of the dialogue and to have
it held in other places.''
   Asked about alternative venues, he said,``Such as Washington.''
   In Washington on Friday, President Bush said that it was ``too
soon'' to consider moving U.S.-PLO contacts to a higher level.
   Former President Reagan in December assigned the American
ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau Jr. to open the dialogue.
The PLO has its headquarters in Tunis.
   The move ended a 13-year American ban on contacts with the PLO.
The ban was lifted after PLO chief Yasser Arafat's explicit
recognition in December of Israel's right to exist and his
renunciation of terrorism.
   Abbas said the PLO leadership had asked Pelletreau to fix a date
for the next U.S.-Palestinian meeting, which would be the first
under the Bush presidency.
   He said that when the issue of terrorism came up at the first
dialogue session, the PLO said it was against attacks on ``civilians
outside the (Israeli-)occupied territories... and against killing
civilians inside the occupied territories, the crime committed daily
by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people.''
   Abbas added: ``But our resistance against the Israeli military
occupation will continue and will not be suspended.''
   He was referring to the 13-month-old uprising by 1.7 million
Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defending government troops ran out of
ammunition and abandoned a southern Sudanese town besieged by rebels
for more than nine months, the army's general command said Saturday.
   The army statement said more than 1,700 army and rebel troops
were killed or wounded in the 37-week siege of Nasir in Upper Nile
region.
   The statement said the government troops were forced to withdraw
after bad weather stopped airdrops of much-needed ammunition and
supplies. Since the siege started, army aircraft have been dropping
supplies over the town and bombing rebel camps around it.
   In Addis Ababa, Sudan People's Liberation Organization spokesman,
Lam Akol, said the rebels had captured the strategic town after
seven days of intensive fighting and that they were in full control
of the garrison town.
   ``People are now rejoicing and dancing in the streets of the
city,'' Akol said.
   Six other government garrisons fell in recent months. In each
case the army explained the loss as a ``tactical withdrawal'' of its
forces.
   Nasir is about 500 miles south of Khartoum and 20 miles from
Sudan's border with Ethiopia, which has aided the rebels with
weapons, money and facilities since the uprising began in 1983.
   Nasir's loss is a major blow to the beleaguered Sudanese army's
war effort. Western military sources said late last year that in
rebel hands, Nasir would become a springboard for attacks on central
and western Upper Nile.
   The army statement said the Sudanese armed forces ``decided to
withdraw its troops from Nasir effective yesterday (Friday) after
they ran out of ammunition and it became impossible for them to
defend the town any further.
   ``It became totally impossible to supply the town with equipment
and men.''
   More than 1,000 ``outlaw forces'' _ government jargon for bush
fighters of the Sudan People's Liberation Army _ were killed or
wounded during the siege, the statement said. It put government
losses at more than 100 soldiers killed and more than 600 wounded.
   Army dead included Col. Mahjoub Mohammed Moussa, commander of the
Nasir garrison, ``whose plane crashed last week,'' the statement
said without giving details. Neither did it specify whether the
plane was shot by rebels.
   The rebel broadcast from Ethiopia claimed that Moussa was
captured when his men fled during the ``one hour of storm attack''
that finally took Nasir. ``SPLA forces are now in hot pursuit of the
remnants, who fled in disarray in different directions,'' the
broadcast said.
   Renegade army Col. John Garang formed the guerrilla army and
launched his rebellion against the Moslem-dominated central
government in early 1983.
   Rebel operations cover all southern Sudan's three regions of
Equatoria, Bahr el-Ghazal and Upper Nile, inhabited mostly by
Christians and animists. Garang wants economic and administrative
reforms in the south.

<HEAD>Turbopump Problem Could Delay Space Shuttle Launch</HEAD>

   NASA said Saturday it probably will
replace at least two of the three liquid oxygen turbopumps on
Discovery's main engines, a move that could delay the shuttle's late
February launch until March.
   A decision will be made before Discovery is rolled out to the
launch pad, a move scheduled for Thursday, National Aeronautics and
Space Administration spokeswoman Lisa Malone said.
   ``It is very likely we will pull at least two of the pumps,'' she
said.
   Sources reported that replacing two pumps could mean a delay of
10 or more days in the planned Feb. 23 launch.
   The problem stems from the December flight of shuttle Atlantis.
Post-flight inspection of Atlantis' engines disclosed two tiny
cracks in a bearing assembly in one of the turbopumps. Engineers
determined they were caused by stress corrosion, apparently
resulting from moisture that penetrated the metal during the curing
process.
   Extensive analysis has not revealed the source of the moisture.
Because two of Discovery's pumps may have been processed in the same
manner as the faulty Atlantis unit, NASA is leaning toward replacing
them with new, carefully inspected pumps.
   The third pump may be removed as a precaution, Miss Malone said.
   Such engine work usually is done when the shuttle is in the
horizontal position in a processing facility. But Discovery was
mated last week with its booster rockets and external fuel tank, and
the turbopump replacement would have to be done while the craft is
in the vertical position.
   Technicians have been working on new procedures to do the work in
that position.
   Too long a delay in Discovery's launch could affect the
subsequent Atlantis mission, which is to dispatch a probe to the
planet Venus on April 28. Discovery would have to be off the only
shuttle launch pad by about March 14 if NASA is to maintain the
April date.
   Discovery is to carry a crew of five astronauts who are to deploy
a communications satellite and conduct scientific and medical
experiments.

   A group opposed to nuclear testing
demonstrated Saturday to mark the anniversary of the first nuclear
test here in 1951 and 38 protesters were arrested for trespassing,
officials said.
   The protest by members of the American Peace Test Organization
coincided with the 38th anniversary of the first atomic test at the
Nevada Test Site. Members gathered in Las Vegas on Friday to mark
the actual anniversary date.
   The protesters were arrested for trespassing when they reached
the entrance of the test site, said government spokesman Jim Boyer.
   The demonstration lasted ``for only a couple of hours'' and about
60 protesters turned out, he said.
   The demonstration was part of an international campaign to
persuade President Bush to negotiate a comprehensive test ban
treaty, a protest spokesman said.
   There have been 687 announced tests at the site, 65 miles
northwest of Las Vegas, since testing began there Jan. 27, 1951.

<TEXT>
   For a week, the owners of Pixie, a
normally playful puppy, didn't know why she had slowed down and
would whine anytime she was picked up. The answer came when a
veterinarian removed the 7-inch long, serrated steak knife the dog
had somehow swallowed.
   ``If I had known a knife was in her, I would have freaked,'' said
owner Tony Strollo.
   The English bulldog-German shepherd mix was less than 2 months
old and weighed just over 10 pounds when she wolfed down the knife,
probably on Jan. 14.
   The knife apparently fell on the floor during a meal and nobody
noticed, Strollo's wife, Barbara, said. No one, that is, except
Pixie.
   Teeth marks found later on the knife testify to the fact the
puppy gnawed at it before she swallowed it.
   Dr. Jo Ann Helm, a veterinarian, who found and surgically removed
the utensil Jan. 21, said the knife lay neatly packaged down Pixie's
throat, with the handle pushing down on the stomach.
   The first signs that something was wrong came when the pup tried
to cough something up, but nothing happened.
   Then Pixie started acted funny. She couldn't coordinate her front
legs, and she would give a tiny yelp when people picked her up, the
Strollos said.
   A first trip to the vet revealed nothing. X-rays were taken on a
return visit and clearly showed the knife.
   ``Dogs swallow anything ... pantyhose, balls, sticks,'' Ms. Helm
said. ``Just like a young human child, a puppy explores with its
mouth.''

<HEAD>Report: Braniff Plans Headquarters Move To Orlando</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. plans to move its headquarters from
Dallas to Orlando, Fla., the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported
Saturday.
   The airline last year moved its principal hub operation from
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Kansas City, Mo.
   Since the airline was purchased by a Philadelphia and New York
investment group last summer, speculation on a location for the
company's new headquarters has centered on Kansas City and Orlando,
where Braniff has a smaller hub.
   The Star-Telegram quoted industry sources it did not name in
reporting that Braniff officials have decided to move the
headquarters staff of 120 to Orlando.
   ``They'll make the announcement probably sometime in February,
then move after school is out,'' one source told the newspaper.
   Braniff spokesman Don McGuire told The Associated Press on
Saturday a final decision has not been made.
   ``I have no way of knowing why their source said such things,''
McGuire said, adding no announcement is pending.
   BIA Acquisitions, an investor group formed by Paine Webber Group
Inc., bought Braniff in June for about $100 million and became the
airline's third owner since its 1982 bankruptcy court reorganization.
   The new owners immediately began an effort to rejoin the ranks of
the nation's largest carriers, pulling Braniff's primary hub out of
Dallas-Fort Worth because of competition from the giant hub
operations of American Airlines and Delta Air Lines there.
   The airline recently announced the purchase of 50 Airbus A300
planes, a deal valued at $3.5 billion that would nearly double its
fleet, with an option to buy 50 more.
   About 1,200 of Braniff's 4,000 employees work in Kansas City,
where the airline has 84 daily departures and is the region's
dominant carrier. About 1,000 work in Orlando, where Braniff has 34
daily departures, and another 1,000 in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
   The company earlier this month leased more than 26,000 square
feet in an abandoned terminal at the Orlando airport. But McGuire
told the Star-Telegram projecting that space as the site of the
company's new headquarters is ``reading in things that we've not
said.''

<HEAD>At Least 110 Drug Smugglers Hanged This Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran hanged seven more drug smugglers in
an anti-narcotics crackdown, bringing to at least 110 the total
number of drug-related executions this month, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Saturday.
   Six more drug traffickers were to be hanged before dawn Sunday
under a tough new narcotics law that went into effect Jan. 21, the
news agency quoted the daily newspaper Ettelaat as saying.
   The seven hangings took place Friday and Saturday in
Torbat-E-Heydariyeh in northeastern Khorasan province near the
Afghan border, said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   It said authorities seized 163 pounds of opium, 8.8 pounds of
heroin along with weapons, ammunition and a pair of military
binoculars when they arrested the seven smugglers.
   The agency said 69 other smugglers were arrested Friday in the
Khorasan region after local law enforcement authorities cracked four
drug rings.
   In those arrests, authorities seized about 132 pounds of opium,
22 pounds of hashish and 3 pounds of heroin as well as Soviet-made
weapons, gold and 11 vehicles, it said.
   An estimated 1,500 people have been arrested since the crackdown
on traffickers began in December. At least 110 have been hanged or
shot by firing squads this month.
   A new law mandating death for anyone found with small amounts of
drugs was announced Dec. 5 by the 13-member Expediency Council, a
body with special powers set up by Khomeini to speed up legislation
in Parliament.
   The law also provides for a minimum 20-year prison term for
anyone convicted of causing drug addiction in another person. Those
convicted of causing widespread addiction could also face the death
penalty.
   IRNA said that one million Iranians are believed involved in drug
abuse. It said prices of heroin have shot up since the start of the
campaign and that pushers were asking addicts to use the drug in
front of them to avoid being picked up during Komiteh raids.

<HEAD>Thousands Protest Government Labor Package That Allows More Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands supporting a
communist-dominated trade union marched through the capital Saturday
protesting a labor law package proposed by the center-right
government that would permit more layoffs.
   The estimated 20,000 demonstrators, waving banners and chanting
slogans dating from the country's 1974 leftist revolution, filed
slowly along downtown Lisbon's main boulevard Avenida da Liberdade
and into Rossio central square.
   They called for an eight-hour reduction in the present 48-hour
working week and a 13.5-percent increase in the national minimum
salary recently hiked to around $200 per month.
   The General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP),
Portugal's most powerful union, organized the march and other
gatherings across the country against laws they claim would allow
employers to hire and fire at will and deprive workers of job
security by the spread of temporary contracts.
   Anibal Cavaco Silva's Social Democratic government says the laws
are necessary that allow employers to dismiss workers for economic
reasons, in order to streamline the work force in Portugal's
labor-intensive and state-dominated economy.
   A socialist-inspired constitution adopted after the 1974
revolution currently makes it difficult for employers to dismiss
workers.
   Unions and employers' associations were initially slated to sign
an accord on the package Monday but the signing was called off, as
neither side could agree to final terms.
   The Socialist-associated General Union of Workers (UGT) had
worked out an agreement with the government, but it was later
rejected by employers.
   Both UGT and CGTP unions also object to a wages and prices
proposal based on what they see as unrealistic government forecasts
on inflation and have threatened a general strike if no acceptable
labor package can be found.
   The government based last year's wage claims on an inflation
prediction of around 6 percent. Inflation nearly hit an annualized
10 percent at the end of December.
   Cavaco Silva points out Portugal's growth rate of an estimated
4.2 percent in 1988 is almost double the European Economic Community
average and a 6 percent unemployment rate is relatively low for EEC
standards.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the Irish Republican Army's
legal political wing said the IRA killed an ``exceptional and
regrettable'' number of civilians last year.
   But Gerry Adams, president of the Sinn Fein party, told 600
delegates to the annual party convention that his rebuke did not
mean he was condemning the outlawed IRA and its armed struggle to
end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   In Northern Ireland, meanwhile, a police officer was killed
Saturday and two others injured in a bombing attack near the Irish
Republic border.
   And in London, an estimated 2,000 demonstrators marked the 17th
anniversary of ``Bloody Sunday,'' when British soldiers fatally shot
14 people during a Roman Catholic civil rights protest in Northern
Ireland.
   Sinn Fein supports the mainly Roman Catholic IRA's fight to unite
the province with the republic. But even some IRA supporters have
criticized the group for blunders that killed at least 20 civilians
in the past 14 months.
   Adams earlier this year told the IRA to ``get its house in
order'' after one of its bombs killed two of his Roman Catholic
constituents in West Belfast.
   ``Since the last (convention), there has been an exceptional and
regrettable level of civilian casualties and fatalities arising from
IRA operations,'' Adams said in a keynote speech at Dublin's Mansion
House.
   ``Our dismay, our regret and our sympathy with the plight of
families bereaved by the IRA is genuine,'' he said.
   Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's national executive
committee, told the conference the IRA is trying to resolve the
issue.
   He said the IRA dissolved one of its units to punish it after a
November bombing in Enniskillen in which 11 civilians were killed.
   Earlier, senior party official Danny Morrison said Sinn Fein may
set up pirate radio stations in the province to circumvent a
government ban on interviews with its members, news reports said.
   Sinn Fein commands about one-third of the Catholic vote in
Northern Ireland and won seats on 17 of the country's 26 local
authorities in the last elections in 1985. The next local elections
are in May.
   The convention is to end Sunday.
   In Northern Ireland, meanwhile, a policeman was killed and two
others were injured during a bomb attack in the border village of
Sion Mills in west Northern Ireland.
   A spokesman at police headquarters in Belfast said the three
policemen were driving down the main street of the village when
someone standing in the doorway of a pub signaled for them to stop.
   Not realizing it was an ambush, the policemen halted their car
and one got out to investigate. An assailant then threw a bomb at
the car from the roof of a nearby building, wrecking the car, police
said.
   One officer died and another was badly hurt in the blast. A third
was injured when scores of people spilling out of a nearby nightspot
pelted him with bottles as he tried to aid his injured colleagues.
   The noisy crowd also attacked army and police arriving on the
scene but the group was dispersed when reinforcements fired rubber
bullets, police said.
   Police said the march in London went ``extremely well,'' and four
people were arrested for public order offenses. Chief Inspector Roy
Symons said about 50 supporters of the extreme right-wing National
Front followed the march but there were no clashes.
   The British Army said the soldiers opened fire on an illegal
march organized by the Civil Rights Association in Londonderry on
Jan. 30, 1972, in response to sniper fire. A judicial inquiry
concluded that none of the dead or wounded had been proven to have
been shot while handling a firearm.

   A smoky fire erupted Saturday in the middle
of a landmark nine-story hotel, killing at least three people and
injuring 14, officials said.
   The fire started about 7:15 a.m. in a fifth-floor room at the
Bethlehem Hotel, and spread to the hallway and an adjoining room
before being extinguished before noon.
   Floors above suffered smoke damage and the fourth floor suffered
water damage, Fire Commissioner Carmen Oliver said. Robert Decker,
who owns the hotel with his wife, Dee, estimated damage in the
millions of dollars.
   Among those staying at the hotel were 20 residents of a nearby
apartment building for the elderly that was being renovated. Others
were business travelers and music teachers attending a convention.
   The fire started in the room of Murial Brooks of Croton Falls,
N.Y.
   ``I plugged an iron into the wall socket and there was a flash.
The chair caught fire and I tried to beat it out,'' said Brooks, who
was not injured.
   Oliver said officials had not yet ruled on the cause of the fire.
   ``There was no fire alarm, there was no sound,'' said Bob
Gregory, who was staying on the fifth floor while on business. ``I
knew where the door was and I could feel where the smoke was coming
from,'' he said in describing his escape.
   The Deckers said the fire alarms did sound and four hotel
employees went upstairs to knock on doors and alert the guests.
   ``We had four people who said (the alarms) were definitely going
off,'' Mrs. Decker said. ``The fire system is excellent. We updated
it when we bought the hotel four years ago.''
   ``You could see the flames going out the window,'' said Ruth
Edwards, who was staying on the ninth floor and attending Eastern
Division convention of the Music Teachers National Association.
   At least 100 rooms in the 126-room hotel were occupied by people
attending the convention, Mrs. Decker said.
   The hotel, which opened in 1922 and has been renovated in recent
years, also is the site of major social events in this eastern
Pennsylvania city about 60 miles north of Philadelphia.
   Two of the dead were identified as Monique Forbes, 58, who lived
at the hotel, and John Kelly, 75, a resident of the Monocacy Towers
retirement home, said County Coroner Joseph Reichel. The third
victim was identified as Charles R. Knouse, 69, said Lehigh County
Coroner Wayne Snyder.
   Six people were taken to St. Luke's Hospital for treatment,
including a 65-year-old woman from the retirement home who was in
critical condition. Six victims were taken to Muhlenberg Hospital
and two, ages 79 and 83, were in critical condition, said
spokeswoman Melissa Wright.
   An Easton Hospital spokeswoman, Faith Jendzeizwk, said two
victims were treated there and released.
   Three firefighters suffered minor injuries, Oliver said.

   Chicago millionaire Noah Robinson was
sentenced to the maximum 10 years in prison Saturday after being
found guilty of a felony in connection with the attempted murder of
a woman who witnessed a slaying.
   Robinson, half-brother of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a Greenville
native, was charged with murder and conspiracy in the death of Leroy
``Hambone'' Barber. State Circuit Judge James Moore declared a
mistrial on those counts when the jury failed to reach a verdict.
   The jury convicted Robinson of accessory after the fact of
assault and battery with intent to kill in connection with the
attempted murder of Janice Denise Rosemond.
   Robinson, 45, was accused of hiring someone to kill Ms. Rosemond,
who witnessed the 1986 murder of Barber. Ms. Rosemond survived a
stabbing attack.
   Moore sentenced Robinson to 10 years in prison, and Robinson was
led away in handcuffs to the Greenville County Detention Center.
   ``I've said all along I'm innocent of the charges but I'm
prepared to take the punishment the court will mete on me,''
Robinson said during sentencing.
   Moore declared a mistrial for the four other charges _ murder and
conspiracy to commit murder in the Barber slaying and criminal
conspiracy and accessory before the fact of assault and battery with
intent to kill in connection with the Rosemond attack.
   Solicitor Joe Watson, the prosecutor, said Robinson will face
another trial on those charges.
   Defense attorneys said they would appeal the conviction and an
appeal bond of $100,000 was set. Moore also reinstated bond of $1
million on the other charges. Robinson remained in custody late
Saturday, officials said.
   Robinson was accused of hiring members of the El Rukn gang of
Chicago to come to Greenville to kill Barber, a former employee and
childhood friend.
   Before beginning deliberations Saturday, the jury asked the judge
what would happen if they reached a verdict on only some of the
charges. Moore told the jurors a mistrial would be called only on
those indictments they couldn't decide.
   The jury spent 16 hours deliberating. The trial began Jan. 16.
   Earlier, defense attorney Robert Simone asked that one of the
jurors be removed because Watson had coached the woman's children on
a swim team. Moore denied the request.
   Simone said he was ``really upset about the sentence'' but said
there was ``logic behind that verdict.''
   ``I think the jury probably inferred'' that Robinson knew about
the attack on Ms. Rosemond, Simone said. ``But they did not reach a
conclusion that he was involved before or during the incident,'' he
said.
   During the trial Watson traced the history of Chicago's El Rukn
gang and its ties to Robinson.
   Witnesses testified that Robinson was a close friend of Jeff
Fort, the leader of the gang, who is serving time in a Texas prison
on drug charges. Witnesses also testified that Robinson wielded a
significant amount of power in the organization.
   Watson told the jury of Robinson's stormy relationship with
Barber, with whom Robinson had physically fought and whom Robinson
believed broke into buildings he owned in Chicago.
   Simone said Robinson was a victim of a misguided investigation.
The attorney argued that prosecutors had made deals with known
criminals, who in testifying ``to save their own skin'' had
implicated an innocent man.

   Supplies in outlying Alaskan villages
dwindled Saturday when delivery trucks were idled by flat tires
caused by a brutal cold snap that prompted the governor to declare a
state of emergency.
   The official low for the 12 hours ending at 4 p.m. Saturday was
69 degrees below zero at Farewell Lakes near McGrath. The weather
service said it also received an unofficial reading of 86 degrees
below zero at a lodge near McGrath, northwest of Fairbanks. The
state's all-time low is 80 degrees below zero, recorded at Prospect
Creek in 1971.
   Mid-day temperatures elsewhere in Alaska on Saturday included 25
below zero at Anchorage and 44 below at Barrow and Fairbanks. The
normal low for January is 6 degrees in Anchorage and 21.6 degrees
below zero at Fairbanks, according to the weather service.
   No serious injuries have been blamed on the cold, but Gov. Steve
Cowper issued an emergency declaration Saturday to help make state
funds available for emergency services.
   Delivery systems have been disrupted to rural villages statewide,
causing shortages of essential items, Cowper said. Other villages
were experiencing cold weather-related problems in the operation of
water, sewer, power and heating systems, he said.
   The American Red Cross said it opened an emergency shelter at
Port Graham on the Kenai Peninsula and would open a shelter in
Anchorage on Saturday because the cold wave threatened to force
people from their homes.
   The Anchorage shelter could handle about 100 people, said Joyce
Murphy, vice chairman of the Red Cross disaster committee. Another
facility in the city would be opened if response exceeded that
figure, she said.
   In Tanana, the driver of a truck that picks up groceries and mail
at the airport was unable to make his rounds. Pete Platten said the
record cold flattened three of the truck's tires.
   ``There's no give to the tires at this temperature,'' Platten
said. ``They get a flat spot from sitting and they pop the bead from
around the rim or crack at the base of the valve stem when you go to

   The operator of a store at Tanana predicted supplies would last
only a few days longer.
   ``Then we'll be running out of things _ bread, eggs and milk,''
Dale Erickson said. The store already was out of Blazo, a fuel for
portable heaters, he said.
   Because small planes cannot fly in extremely cold weather, many
of Alaska's 200 villages have been without mail and food delivery
for two weeks.
   The Alaska National Guard stood by to provide food and fuel
airlifts to villages needing them, Cowper said on Friday. Mail and
food supplies are stacking up in hub airports such as those at Nome
and Kotzebue, he said.
   In Galena, in central Alaska, students stayed home Friday after
the school was closed so workers could try to thaw a sewer line.
Superintendent Harry Purdy said oil in fuel lines at the school was
congealing. Water and sewer lines at several municipal buildings in
Galena froze.
   In Anchorage, a municipal sewage plant operator said that during
the last two weeks, calls had been coming in at the rate of 20 to 30
a night from residents with frozen sewer lines.
   Mail carriers in the city were told to stay outside for no longer
than 10 minutes at a time, then retreat to their vehicles or the
indoors.
   With wind chill factors, temperatures have been in excess of 100
below at several locations, including the North Slope on Alaska's
northern coast, officials said.
   The National Weather Service said the extreme cold could continue
for another week or two in interior Alaska. Meteorologists
attributed the brutal temperatures to a mass of cold air they call
the Omega Block.

<HEAD>Search Fails to Find Crew Of Japanese Cargo Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard and Navy searched the
northern Pacific Ocean on Saturday for a Japanese cargo ship's crew,
which apparently abandoned the vessel during a storm off the
Aleutian Islands.
   The Port Star sent a distress call to Japanese marine safety
officials Saturday morning, saying cargo on the deck of the 850-foot
vessel was lost and the 20-member crew was abandoning ship, said
Coast Guard spokesman Chris Haley.
   Coast Guard officials said the Port Star was caught in 30- to
40-foot seas and winds of 65 to 75 knots, or approximately 75-85
mph, at the time of the distress message.
   Japanese officials alerted the Coast Guard in Juneau and a P-3
aircraft from the Navy installation at Adak in the Aleutians began a
search. The Aleutians are a chain of islands that extend southwest
off the Alaska mainland.
   Haley said the Navy reported no sign of the crew aboard the
vessel, which was still afloat some 300 miles southwest of Attu in
the Aleutian chain.
   He said only one life raft remained aboard.
   The Port Star is owned by Nipponkai Steamship Co. Ltd. of Tokyo
and was transporting logs. The Coast Guard did not know the ship's
destination.
   Saturday's search was hampered by poor weather and visibility and
the search was expected to resume Sunday morning. Haley said the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship Miller Freeman
is expected to reach the scene late Sunday.
   A Coast Guard C-130 aircraft was unable to leave the ground in
Kodiak because of severe weather Saturday, Haley said. The Coast
Guard cutter Yacona was diverted and probably will not reach the
area of the Port Star's location until late Monday, he said.

   A railroad tanker filled with sulfur
dioxide leaked Saturday, spewing hazardous fumes with the stench of
rotten eggs and forcing evacuation of hundreds of people from the
downtown area for several hours.
   Authorities said the Union Pacific tanker car was on a siding
near the Boundary County Fairgrounds, adjacent to downtown, when it
sprang a two- to three-inch hole shortly after 6:30 a.m.
   An estimated 400 to 500 people, some elderly, were forced out of
businesses and homes, and sheriff's officers maintained roadblocks
to keep people out.
   Residents were allowed to return about 3:30 p.m., but were warned
they should leave again if they smelled any fumes, said Allen
Chrisman, a U.S. Forest Service official.
   ``Things are looking good,'' Chrisman said. ``All the folks have
been returned to their homes.''
   Among the evacuees was Boundary County Clerk Norma Estep, who
said there was no panic and praised civil defense personnel who
responded to the evacuation order.
   ``Our emergency crews did an excellent job,'' Mrs. Estep said.
``I'm really proud of them.''
   The tanker continued to leak Saturday afternoon, but Robert
Heffner of the state Communications and Poison Control Center in
Boise said it had been moved about five miles south of town and a
nearby farm house was evacuated as a precaution.
   Crews were venting the gas through barrels of lime to neutralize
the sulfur dioxide, Chrisman said. The crews planned to monitor the
situation through the night and eventually transfer the material to
another tank car.
   ``It was pretty thick this morning, but it's a lot clearer now,''
Jeannie Alonzo, a sheriff's dispatcher, said late Saturday morning.
``It just hurt to breath it.''
   Nine people people were treated for minor eye irritation and
respiratory problems at Boundary County Community Hospital, then
released, a nursing supervisor said. One person with a history of
respiratory ailments was admitted for observation.
   Another person who was downtown at the time of the leak later
died of a heart attack at the hospital, but officials were uncertain
if the death was related to the leak.
   Downtown residents were taken to the local high school and to a
Methodist church at the south end of town on a hill, sheriff's
spokeswoman Jane Kirby said. All the evacuees later were moved to
the church in the town of about 2,000 in the Idaho Panhandle, 26
miles south of the Canadian border.
   The rupture apparently resulted from a structural failure caused
by corrosion, said Scott Lund, a compliance supervisor for the state
Division of Environmental Quality's Hazardous Materials Bureau.
   A hazardous materials team from the Spokane, Wash., Fire
Department was on the scene, assessing the danger and beginning a
cleanup. A hazardous materials response team from British Columbia
also was sent, along with officials from the state Division of
Environmental Quality, the federal Environmental Protection Agency
and Union Pacific.
   Sulfur dioxide is a heavy, colorless, suffocating gas used as a
bleach, disinfectant, refrigerant or preservative. It also is used
in paper pulping and food processing.
   It is liquefied under pressure for shipping. Heffner said the
leak sent a bluish plume of vapor into the air, but the weight of
the gas kept it close to the ground.
   Prolonged exposure to the gas, which has a rotten-egg smell, can
cause nausea, vomiting or even death. When mixed with water, sulfur
dioxide forms a corrosive acid but Heffner said there did not appear
to be any immediate environmental danger.
   The tanker originated in Trail, British Columbia, and was bound
for Trentwood, Wash., near Spokane, said John Bromley, a Union
Pacific spokesman in Omaha, Neb. Lund said the sulfur dioxide was
the property of Cominco American.

   President Bush concluded what he called a
harmonious first week in the White House by urging caution in
dealing with the Soviets and giving his support to a 50 percent pay
raise for Congress.
   Holding his first news conference as president on Friday, Bush
displayed ease and confidence in fielding reporters' questions in a
session that ranged in topics from abortion to foreign relations.
   Bush today was meeting with former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger for a briefing on his recent trip to the Soviet Union.
Kissinger met with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and delivered
personal greetings from Bush.
   Tonight, Bush's schedule includes an appearance at the annual
dinner of the all-male Alfalfa Club in Washington. The group each
year hosts a humorous dinner with remarks by prominent politicians
and business leaders.

   America must be ready to use the ``crowbar'' of
retaliation to open world markets, says President Bush's nominee for
top U.S. trade negotiator.
   ``Retaliation cannot be the goal of our policy _ in fact, it
signals the failure to open foreign markets,'' Washington attorney
Carla Hills said Friday before the Senate Finance Committee approved
her nomination as U.S. trade representative.
   ``But the credible threat of retaliation provides essential
leverage in our market-opening efforts,'' said the former secretary
of housing and urban development in the Ford administration. ``Thus,
actual retaliation will be used, albeit reluctantly, to preserve the
credibility of this threat.''
   Pledging to fight to open global markets ``with a crowbar if
necessary,'' she said: ``We have to have our agreements enforced,''
she said. ``And where our partners are violating our agreements we
must take action.''

   Three congressmen with defense-related
committee assignments say they were unaware of receiving illegal
corporate contributions through a consultant who pleaded guilty in
the government's investigation of Pentagon corruption.
   ``The circumstances of this contribution were totally unknown to
me ... and I am returning it immediately,'' Sen. Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn., said in a statement after learning Friday that his campaign
had received $1,000 illegally.
   Rep. Richard Ray, D-Ga., said he was ``extremely upset'' by the
news that Joseph E. Hill, 76, of Mineola, N.Y., had given money to
his campaign. He said he too would send the money back.
   Between 1982 and 1988 Hill contributed over $25,000 to political
campaigns at the direction of his consulting client, Unisys Corp., a
giant computer company that does work for the Defense Department,
prosecutors said. Federal election law says individuals may give
$1,000 in general and primary campaigns, but corporations are
prohibited from donating money.

   Two aging Nazi war criminals
pardoned by the Dutch parliament arrived in West Germany after
spending 43 years in prison for sending thousands of Dutch Jews to
death camps, among them possibly Anne Frank.
   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker praised the Dutch
decision Friday to pardon the two war criminals, calling it a
humanitarian act. A government spokesman said the men would be
allowed to settle in West Germany.
   The Dutch decision to pardon and expel Franz Fischer, 87, and
Ferdinand aus der Fuenten, 79, ended two days of emotional debate.
Opponents of the pardon said the men should have remained in jail
the rest of their lives.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, head of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal
Center, wrote in a letter to Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers, ``It is
unconscionable to release such notorious individuals who perpetrated
heinous crimes and caused suffering to so many thousands.''

   Searchers who set out to find the remains
of two of serial killer Ted Bundy's victims were forced to postpone
one search until spring because of snow and frozen ground.
   ``We found some really promising places, but the snow's just too
deep,'' Carbon County Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Cowan said after a
daylong hunt for the remains of a victim believed to be 15-year-old
Susan Curtis.
   ``We've called it off until the spring. We need some snow melt,
and we'll wait until the ground is dry and we have warmer
temperatures,'' Cowan said.
   Meanwhile, a search for another victim's remains got under way
near Capitol Reef National Park and a third search was planned today
along U.S. 89 in central Utah. Yet another could begin next week
near Grand Junction, Colo.

   It was too cold for driving, too cold
for flying, too cold for just about everything. It was so cold, with
wind chill readings of up to 115 degrees below zero, that even dog
sled races were canceled.
   And that isn't just an Alaskan tall tale.
   In an arctic state where people take cold weather for granted,
where subzero temperatures are about as common as frost in the lower
48, a sudden plunge into brutally bitter cold has grabbed everyone's
attention.
   It was 75 degrees below zero Friday in McGrath, about 150 miles
west of Mount McKinley. It was 43 below in Fairbanks, where
electricity demand hit an all-time high. Far to the south in
Anchorage, the state's largest city, the high Friday was 15 below.
   ``We're not declaring an emergency yet,'' Gov. Steve Cowper said
with a stiff upper lip as Alaskans wondered whether the temperatures
would break the record of 80 below zero set in 1971 at Prospect
Creek.

   Many state and municipal governments say they are confident they
will escape the effects of last week's Supreme Court ruling striking
down a racial quota system for public-works contracts because their
plans are less strict.
   Boston and Atlanta are among the exceptions, and officials there
say some programs may be jeopardized.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, struck down a program in Richmond,
Va., that required white-owned companies bidding on any city
contract to set aside 30 percent of the contract's value for
minority-owned subcontractors.
   The ruling said rigid racial quotas must be supported by evidence
of past discrimination; for example, that black-owned enterprises
tried to obtain construction contracts but were denied them. Without
such evidence, the use of racial quotas violates the
equal-protection rights of whites, the court said.

   Ron Brown says he will not pick a fight with
Jesse Jackson to demonstrate his independence as the new Democratic
party chairman, but that there are bound to be conflicts with the
presidential candidate he worked for in 1988.
   ``I'm not looking for it, trying to orchestrate it,'' Brown said
in an interview last week in advance of succeeding Paul G. Kirk Jr.
in the party post. ``I'm sure at one time or another I'll have the
opportunity to demonstrate independence from any of the potential
candidates in `92.''
   Brown's election to the party chairmanship was assured last week
when three of his four rivals for the post dropped out and endorsed
him. Only former Rep. Jim Jones of Oklahoma continued his challenge,
but there was near unanimous agreement within the party that Brown
will be a sure winner when the Democratic National Committee votes
Feb. 10.

   U.S. defense experts lashed out at
West Germany on Saturday, accusing the Bonn leadership of ``benign
neglect'' of chemical weapons controls and a cavalier attitude
toward its NATO responsibilities.
   The charges came during an annual conference for NATO military
strategists.
   The meeting opened with a cautious speech by Defense Minister
Rupert Scholz in which he gave only a hesitant endorsement to NATO
plans to extend the range of some European-based nuclear missiles.
   Scholz was attempting to straddle the fence between the U.S.
position that short-range missile ``modernization'' is necessary to
protect long-standing NATO defense strategies and the broadly held
view among West Germans that missile replacement is unnecessary
because of improving East-West relations.

   A buoyant Lech Walesa predicted Saturday
that authorities will legalize Solidarity next month and that the
union will play a key role in helping the government solve Poland's
economic problems.
   ``I'm convinced Poland needs understanding and first of all
agreement. We are committed to agreement. We must seek agreement ...
to get the situation under control,'' the Solidarity leader said at
a news conference.
   Solidarity officials and top government leaders on Friday set a
Feb. 6 date for long-awaited, broad-based talks on the future of the
banned union and reforms to combat Poland's economic and political
crisis.
   Walesa said Solidarity's aim is to deal with the government, not
usurp it. ``I said it in 1981 and I repeat it now. We don't want to
take over power. We can't. It would be fatal. But we have a deal to
make with this government.''

<BYLINE>Wall Street Asks: New Bull Market? ^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the surprise of almost everybody, and the
consternation of more than a few, Wall Street is starting to look as
though the great bull market of the mid-1980s is back.
   Over the past few trading days, stock prices have staged a
runaway rise on heavy volume that evokes vivid images of January two
years ago.
   In the heady atmosphere that prevailed then, the Dow Jones
industrial average broke 2,000 for the first time and finished the
month with a net gain of 262 points.
   If the market is going to match that performance this month, it
will have to get even hotter than it has been in the two January
sessions that remain. Some analysts think it is overdue for a
breather.
   Still, it has been an impressive performance, especially when you
consider the uncertainty and skepticism that predominated in the
financial world as the new year began.
   To many investors, of course, the news is exhilarating, helping
to wipe out both the dollars-and-cents losses and the unpleasant
memories created by the crash in the fall of 1987.
   To others who had been cautiously waiting for ``better''
investment opportunities, however, it has been a nasty surprise.
   Consider the position in which many money managers at investing
institutions such as pension funds find themselves.
   In the chastened atmosphere that followed the crash, they
carefully marshaled cash reserves as a cushion against further
trouble ahead. Thus a lot of people were under-represented in stocks
when prices took off again.
   When your clients have suffered a drubbing in the market
collapse, how are they going to take it when you tell them they
missed out on the recovery?
   That kind of thinking, analysts say, has prompted a rush to get
into the market, and helped keep the rally going.
   There have been other favorable forces as well, including recent
talk in Washington of restoring a tax break for capital gains and
giving dividends better tax treatment as well.
   But the stocks that would benefit most directly from tax changes,
the smaller issues many individual investors like to buy, haven't
been the standout gainers in recent weeks.
   Instead, the top performers have been the blue chips and big-name
technology issues that are the common currency in which the
institutions deal.
   In the past week the Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip
industrials jumped 87.50 points to 2,322.86 for its best weekly
showing so far in the rally dating back to late November.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 3.62 to
164.78; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 6.34 to 397.96, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index rose 2.05 to 321.57.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 196.40 million shares a day, up
from 161.40 million the week before.
   Robert Stovall, president of Stovall-Twenty-First Advisors Inc.,
said catch-up buying by investing institutions has been a
predominant force in the market of late.
   ``The train is leaving the station and they have to get on,''
Stovall said. ``It's just a case of raw supply and demand.''
   The current resemblance to the early days of 1987 is a bit
spooky, he acknowledged, given the vulnerable position the market
reached that year and the debacle that followed.
   ``I think that anybody who jumps in now is coming late to the
feast,'' Stovall said. ``In this environment, it's dangerous because
the fundamentals haven't changed very much.''
