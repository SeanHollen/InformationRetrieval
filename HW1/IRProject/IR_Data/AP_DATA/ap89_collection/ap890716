   A pregnant Washington woman sitting on her
front porch was killed early Sunday by a stray bullet from what
police believe was a drug-related gunfight.
   Rhonda Anthony, 34, was killed about 2:30 a.m. as she and her
husband, Willy, sat in front of their house in the city's
southeastern section, police said.
   Charles Alton, 24, was charged with second-degree murder in the
woman's death, police said.
   According to police, the shooting occurred when Alton and another
man exchanged shots at a nearby corner that has been the scene of
drug-related violence in recent weeks.

   Most union miners in Appalachia decided to
return to work with their Midwestern and Southern colleagues Sunday,
but many stayed out of the West Virginia coal fields where wildcat
strikes began last month.
   Many United Mine Workers locals met Sunday and voted to heed
union President Richard Trumka's request that the miners return to
work. In southern West Virginia, however, union officials said there
were enough disgruntled miners to disrupt the coal fields again.
   ``Man, they're upset,'' said Danny Wells, a district board
representative in UMW District 17, the nation's largest with 6,000
miners. ``They are just upset with Trumka's call. They feel that's
nothing been won yet.''
   Angry miners began setting up wildcat pickets about 11 p.m. at
mine sites throughout Logan County.
   Wildcat walkouts by as many as 46,000 miners supporting 1,900
striking Pittston Coal Group workers have idled much of the nation's
coal production since June 12. The number of wildcat strikers fell
to 37,000 by the start of a union-sanctioned work stoppage last week.
   UMW President Richard Trumka on Friday called an end to the
five-day, contract-sanctioned stoppage and asked the miners to
return to work.
   About 16,000 miners _ all the miners in Alabama, Illinois and
Indiana and some in Kentucky _ were expected to return for their
next scheduled shifts.
   Union leaders in Pennsylvania said Sunday they believed the 7,500
miners in their state would return by Monday.
   That put pressure on miners in West Virginia, Ohio and Tennessee
because the protest had become a nationwide action, Wells said
Sunday. ``It would have to be nationwide to be successful,'' he said.
   With the loss of support elsewhere, it would not be wise to adopt
a strategy different from that at the UMW's national headquarters in
Washington, Wells said.
   ``You've got to have a leader, and everybody can't lead,'' he
said.
   In southeast Ohio, at least 700 striking coal miners planned to
return to work Monday and Tuesday, then resume observing a
contract-sanctioned stoppage Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, said
Charles Greer, president of a UMW local in New Lexington.
   Trumka ``ordered us back and we're going back,'' Greer said after
a meeting in Reinersville of about 600 miners Sunday night.
   In UMW District 19 in southeastern Kentucky and northeastern
Tennessee, about 950 miners were expected to return to work early
Monday, said district board member Cecil Michael Partin.
   Some of the miners in that district returned to work Sunday to
inspect mines in preparation for a return to work, Partin said. He
said that was a good indication that other miners in the district
would report Monday.
   In District 30 in eastern Kentucky, UMW local spokesman Terry
Varney, who attended a meeting Saturday of district and local
officials, said Sunday he was fairly confident miners would return
to work.
   In Madison, about 25 miles south of Charleston, UMW District 17
officials met Saturday with more than 400 local presidents and
members but were unable to persuade everyone to cease the wildcat
strikes, which began in West Virginia. A federal judge has ordered
the union to put an end to wildcat strike activities.
   The miners were protesting Pittston's failure to sign a contract
that prohibits Sunday work and mandatory overtime and guarantees
full medical benefits for pensioners. The 1,900 Pittston miners all
work in Kentucky, Virginia or West Virginia.
   Wildcat strikers also have been upset that UMW members and
supporters have been arrested, jailed and fined for civil
disobedience in the coal fields.
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Glen Williams asked Trumka and
Pittston president Paul Douglas to meet with him. Many of the miners
saw this as a break for the union and Williams' request seemed to
ease hostility on the lines.
   Meanwhile, several coal companies said they can't meet orders due
to the strike.
   Westmoreland Coal Co. of Philadelphia says it has told 11 foreign
customers that it will not be able to make coal shipments totaling
474,041 tons, at a price of about $40 a ton.
   Island Creek Corp. of Lexington, Ky., said it also is having
trouble filling orders. The company said that it may fail to meet
obligations ranging from 500,000 to 2 million tons if the strikes
continue.

   With more of its thin steel skin peeling away,
the Exxon Valdez moved into calmer seas off Southern California on
Sunday as scientists puzzled over a gooey substance oozing from the
damaged tanker.
   Battered by heavy swells, seven steel plates have wrenched off
the vessel's hull and dangled below the Valdez, which was towed
2,500 miles to Southern California waters from Alaska. The tanker
caused an 11 million-gallon oil spill in March when it struck a reef
in Prince William Sound.
   Because of the rough water and the hanging plates _ at least one
of which hung 70 feet below the water surface _ divers could not
enter the vessel's tanks to collect oil samples, assess damage and
clean.
   ``The danger is that the swells are creating surges of water
through the open holes (in the hull), and the divers can get sucked
through and across jagged steel,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Larry
Solberg.
   Authorities want to cut off the plates so that the Valdez can get
to its final destination, San Diego Harbor, for nine months of
repairs at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. But to do it
requires a protected inlet or cove.
   The harbor's depth is about 40 feet, Solberg said.
   Authorities towed the Valdez about 30 to 40 miles to calmer seas
Sunday to relieve ocean stress on the ship's increasingly exposed
steel framework.
   Meanwhile, a team of scientists was on the Valdez trying to
determine the composition of a substance that has oozed from the
ship.
   More tests were planned this week to determine whether the
substance is toxic, Solberg said.
   The tests assumed increased urgency after state Attorney General
John Van de Kamp filed suit to ensure the tanker remains outside
California waters until officials are satisfied it is free of toxic
materials.
   Van de Kamp said he filed the lawsuit Friday in San Diego
Superior Court to ensure the existence of ``an enforcement mechanism
for whatever agreement we are able to reach'' with the Exxon
Shipping Co.
   Coast Guard and other agency officials met over the weekend to
discuss contingency planning in case the Valdez breaks up in the
open ocean, Solberg said, stressing the ship was in no immediate
danger.
   ``There's a lot of things we can't see at present, so we do have
a little bit of concern,'' Solberg said.
   The top choice for a temporary anchorage is Pyramid Cove on the
southern side of San Clemente Island, which has a depth of 110 feet,
Solberg said. A decision would be made within 10 days, he said.

   Two hundred volunteers reported 1,100
dolphin sightings this weekend during the first of 40 surveys by The
Dolphin Project.
   ``Today, we had reports of dolphins coming up to boats, so close
people could touch them,'' said Beau Cutts, president of the
Marietta-based conservation group.
   The reason for the project is that a still unidentified disease
killed about half the Atlantic bottlenose population in 1987 and
1988. The Dolphin Project, designed to make four surveys each year,
is designed to try to provide scientists information on if and how
that population recovers from the disaster.
   A major part of the project is to photograph and identify
individual dolphins by coloration and markings on their dorsal fins.
   ``I don't I don't know of any other program of this type in the
world, especially when it's conducted by lay citizens under the
supervision of scientists,'' Cutts said.
   The first survey, with five-member teams in 28 boats, covered the
coast in a band 13 miles wide from St. Catherines Sound north to the
South Carolina line. The survey was from 5 miles offshore to 8 miles
inland up creeks and in marshes.
   Despite rain Sunday, 90 percent of the volunteers said they would
be back for the second survey, Oct. 13 through 15, from St.
Catherines Sound to the Darien area.

   A four-story apartment building apparently rocked
by a gas explosion collapsed Saturday, killing one person and
injuring seven others.
   Rescue workers pulled the body of a man from the rubble in
northern Manhattan, said Fire Department spokesman John Mulligan.
The victim had been thrown through a wall and covered with bricks,
he said.
   The man, who was not immediately identified, was pronounced dead
at the scene.
   The victim's brother was taken to the hospital with injuries from
falling debris and burns, Mulligan said. Five other people were
treated for injuries such as cuts from flying debris, while a
seventh person was in serious condition, officials said.
   Audrey Singleton, who lives nearby, said the explosion at about
3:30 p.m. sounded like ``a bomb.''
   ``Everything blew out of the building,'' she said. ``Half of the
stuff blew across the street. ... My whole house shook. It blew out
my windows _ all of my kitchen windows and two bedroom windows.
   ``It looked like a building blew up in a war. The building is
gone.'' Ms. Singleton said the windows were knocked out of buildings
on either side of the four-story brownstone.
   Sgt. Pete Berry, a police spokesman, said the collapse was
apparently due to a gas explosion.

   Wildcat strikes waned in the southern
Appalachian and Midwestern coal fields Saturday as a
union-sanctioned work stoppage expired, but some coal officials
worried that a union back-to-work order wasn't genuine.
   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka on Friday called an
end to a five-day non-paid holiday and asked 37,000 union coal
miners to end wildcat strikes that have idled much of the nation's
coal production since June 12.
   Miners in Alabama, Illinois and Indiana immediately heeded the
call and some returned for light work in the coal fields Saturday.
Most aren't scheduled to return to work until Monday.
   Illinois had 8,500 miners returning, Alabama had 5,000 and
Indiana 1,750.
   Officials of the largest UMW district in Pennsylvania on Saturday
asked 3,500 striking members to return to work at 12:01 a.m. Monday,
said District 2 president Nick Molnar, who met with most of the 54
union local presidents at the district's headquarters in Edensburg.
   Some of the strikers in Kentucky have agreed to go back to work
and the remainder are undecided. It wasn't certain on Saturday how
many of the remaining wildcatters in West Virginia, Ohio and
Tennesee would go back to work. Meetings were scheduled in those
states through the weekend.
   The wildcat strikes began June 12 in support of 1,900 miners in
West Virigina, Virginia and Kentucky on strike against the
Virginia-based Pittston Coal Group Inc. The strike against Pittston
began April 5 in a contract dispute.
   Pittston wants a contract separate from the national pact so it
can require Sunday work and mandatory overtime and cut medical
benefits for pensioners from 100 percent to 80 percent.
   At a rally Saturday attended by about 400 miners in Colcord, 40
miles south of Charleston, some members said they didn't want to go
back to work.
   ``If we stop now without accomplishing anything, we might as well
say `Here's our jobs, take 'em,''' said miner Joe James.
   In Madison, about 25 miles south of Charleston, UMW District 17
officials met Saturday with more than 400 local presidents and
members but were unable to persuade everyone to cease the wildcat
strikes. A federal judge has ordered the union to put an end to
wildcat strike activities.
   ``It was about 50-50, but some of them met again after they left
our place,'' said a union official speaking on a condition of
anonymity. ``Some will start back, and as they see how things are
going, others might go back.''
   The indecision fueled speculation by coal industry officials that
Trumka's plea for an end to the wildcat strike wasn't sincere.
   ``I think the whole situation is very suspect as to whether their
true intention is to return to work,'' said Mark Polen, a spokesman
for the West Virginia Coal Association, whose members have lost
15,000 workers to the strike.
   Polen said he suspected Trumka's call was not genuine because it
included a continued unpaid holiday in some places for no apparent
reason.
   The union did not say why it extended the holiday period in
places, but in the past some districts have been kept out longer in
attempts to even out the amount of time that workers were out. This
year, District 17 workers in southern West Virginia started the
wildcat strikes but those in northern West Virginia's District 31
didn't leave until the third day.
   ``Only time and the Sunday midnight shift will tell,'' Polen said.
   A spokesman for the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, which
includes most major coal companies except for Pittston and holds a
no-strike contract with the union, said he wouldn't comment at least
until Monday.
   The union's international executive board meets July 26 and
Trumka's back-to-work request said the miners should return to the
coal mines at least until then.
   The union's contract allows it to call 10 holidays, or ``memorial
days,'' a year. The union used five last week in what was to have
been a cooling-off period, but sporadic violence still disrupted the
coal fields.
   The miners apparently were encouraged that a federal judge in
Virginia invited both Trumka and Pittston President Paul Douglas to
meet with him Tuesday to discuss why negotiators reached an impasse
in early June.
   Trumka accepted Judge Glen Williams' offer. Pittston Coal Group
President Michael Odom said the company would have no comment.

   A bomb hidden in a truck in downtown
Kabul exploded Saturday, shattering the quiet of a Moslem holiday
and killing at least 20 people, officials said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the
Soviet-backed government blamed U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas and
unnamed ``foreign agents'' who support them.
   The bomb, which experts say may have contained as much as 1,100
pounds of dynamite, exploded at noon on Nader Shah Road near the
city's center, police and witnesses said.
   Nine people initially were reported killed in the blast and 11
people subsequently died while hospitalized during the night,
hospital sources said Sunday. About 40 people were reported injured.
   ``The death toll may go up, because we still have people in
critical condition,'' said a doctor at one hospital. He asked that
neither he nor the hospital be named.
   The explosion blew a crater 6 feet wide, 6 feet long and 3 feet
deep in the road, officials said. Fragments from the bomb flew about
400 yards, and windows in buildings 300 yards away were smashed.
   The normally busy steet was less crowded than usual because of
celebrations marking Eid al-Adha, the Moslem feast of sacrifice.
   ``Had it been a normal day, at least 100 or 200 people may have
died,'' said officer Mohammad Naim.
   After the blast, new checkpoints manned by police and soldiers
were put up around the city and all vehicles were stopped and
searched.
   ``The explosion is the work of our opponents and foreign agents
who support them,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi
Amani.
   Amani did not identify the alleged foreign agents. But the
government has long accused Pakistan of interfering in Afghanistan's
internal affairs, a charge the government in Islamabad denies.
   Pakistan, along with the United States, supports the Moslem
guerrillas trying to overthrow the Afghan government. The main
guerrilla groups are based in Pakistan.

   Typhoon Gordon spun across the
northern Philippines on Sunday, knocking down power lines, forcing
evacuations and triggering landslides, officials said. At least five
people were killed.
   Gordon came ashore in Cagayan province before dawn with sustained
winds of up to 116 mph, officials said.
   Power outages were reported in Cagayan, relief officials said.
The typhoon also washed out a bridge and blew off the roof of the
public market in the northern town of Paoay, they added.
   Landslides closed down the Naguilian Road leading to the northern
resort city of Baguio, spokesman Jose Calasan said.
   Corazon de Leon, Social Welfare Department undersecretary, said
the landslide forced 110 families to flee their homes. Another five
families in nearby La Union province were evacuated because of
floods, she said.
   Two carpenters were killed when their shanty was buried in mud
and debris in Baguio, city councilor Lito Pangilinan said. In the
nearby town of La Trinidad, 7-year-old Sammy Pelino died when he was
buried by a landslide, he added.
   Another person drowned in a lagoon in Baguio, Red Cross relief
supervisor Ireneo Zabala said. Landslides closed down the Naguilian
and Kennon Roads, two of the arteries leading to Baguio.
   In the neighboring province of La Union, lightning struck and
killed Arnel Medigoria, spokesmen of the government's Office of
Civil Defense said.
   Typhoon Gordon was expected to move away from the country by
early afternoon, said Harriet Labagnao, a government weather bureau
spokeswoman.
   At 10 a.m., Gordon's center was estimated to be 250 miles north
of Manila, she said. The sea along the northern Philippines was
``extremely dangerous'' for all vessels, she said.
   Philippine Airlines canceled four flights, mostly to the northern
provinces, because of the typhoon. Strong winds continued to buffet
Manila on Sunday.
   On Saturday, officials canceled all inspections, training and
other activities at the U.S.-run Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of
Manila. The base's emergency rescue and clean-up units were placed
on alert and non-essential personnel were ordered home.
   The U.S. military's Far East Network, which described Gordon as a
``super typhoon,'' said some military airlift command flights to and
from Clark were also canceled.

   Leaders of the world's seven largest industrialized
democracies wrapped up their abbreviated summit Sunday, saying
``decisive action is urgently needed'' to protect the environment.
   For the first time in 15 years, an extensive portion of the final
communique was devoted to environmental problems. The summit leaders
endorsed the Bush administration's strategy for solving the problem
of Third World debt and touted their efforts in improving the world
economy.
   The leaders, citing the harmony of the summit, were adjourning
earlier than planned. That, too, was unprecedented in the era of
economic summitry.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, the host of the three-day
gathering, read the final communique and indicated that the summit
had concluded.
   In his closing remarks, Mitterand said that the leaders of the
seven nations ``do not pretend to substitute ourselves for others.
We are women and men of good will. We want to put ourselves at the
service of all humanity. That is the significance of our work.''
   President Bush expressed his gratitude to the French president
and the host country, saying, ``we thank him for the way in which he
conducted the meeting and we thank his fellow citizens.''
   In a final communique, the leaders said, ``There is growing
awareness throughout the world, of the necessity to preserve better
the global ecological balance.''
   The leaders of France, West Germany, Britain, Japan, Canada,
Italy and the United States were caught off-guard Saturday by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's request that the Soviet economy be
linked to that of the West.
   ``Our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending toward
full and entire participation in the world economy,'' Gorbachev
wrote to Mitterrand. It ``is obvious that the rest of the world can
only gain by the opening to the world economy of a market such as
that of the Soviet Union.''
   The letter was the main topic of discussion among the leaders
Saturday night.
   They put the finishing touches on their final communique at a
morning plenary session Sunday.
   In the draft, the leaders said there is a ``serious threat to the
atmosphere, which could lead to future climate changes.''
   The leaders also expressed concern about the ``growing pollution
of air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas.''
   ``Protecting the environment calls for a determined and concerted
international response and for the early adoption, worldwide, of
policies based on sustainable development.''
   On economic issues, the summit nations also endorsed the U.S.
debt reduction strategy unveiled by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady on March 10. U.S. officials had hoped that Mexico, the plan's
test case, would come to agreement with its creditors before the
conclusion of the summit.
   While the so-called Brady plan was not mentioned by name, the
communique clearly endorsed it, urging commercial bankers to
``increasingly focus'' on reducing debt service costs to compliment
new loans to those countries.
   ``Our approach to the debt problems has produced significant
results, but serious challenges remain,'' they said.
   The leaders found much to boast about in the performance of the
economy this year, but they did call for ``continued vigilance''
against the problem of rising inflation.
   ``Inflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive a
firm policy response so that it will be put on a downward path,''
the communique said.
   It singled out the United States, Canada and Italy as countries
in which ``further reductions in budget deficits are needed.''
   ``Action will be taken to bring them down,'' the statement said.
``This may help reduce the savings-investment gap and external
imbalances, contribute to countering inflation and encourage greater
exchange rate stability in a context of decreasing interest rates.''
   The communique also addressed the growing drug problem with the
leaders saying the situation ``has reached devastating proportions''
and requires speedy action.
   ``We urge all countries, especially those where drug production,
trading and consumption are large, to join our efforts to counter
drug production, to reduce demand, and to carry forward the fight
against drug trafficking itself and the laundering of its
proceeds,'' the declaration said.
   The leaders ended their 27-page statement with a reference to the
international ethics committee on the deadly AIDS virus which met in
Paris in May. The communique made no recommendations or suggestions.
   But, as promised, the focus of the declaration was on the
environment, a subject in which President Bush has sought to take
the lead.
   Bush began his final full day in France by attending church
services at the 104-year-old American Cathedral of Paris. He joined
the congregation in praying for the economic summit, a better
dialogue between rich and poor nations and for the hostages being
held in Lebanon.
   Until the arrival of the Gorbachev letter, the debt problems of
Poland and of the Third World were the focus of the 15th summit,
being held amid a series of extravaganzas marking the bicentennial
of the French Revolution.
   In Gorbachev's letter, the Soviet leader said his policy of
economic restructuring, known as perestroika, means that the Soviet
Union wants ``full and entire participation in the world economy.''
   Gorbachev suggested cooperation in easing the Third World's $1.3
trillion debt, saying:
   ``We see points of convergence and complementarity in the
approaches to global problems, in particular the solution to Third
World debt.
   ``It doesn't matter who gets credit for the best initiative. The
essential thing is that there is a real possibility to contribute
together to the efficiency of practical measures in the domain of
debt.''
   The letter was the primary subject of discussion at Saturday's
working dinner under the gleaming glass Pyramid in the Louvre
Museum's Napoleon Courtyard.
   ``If there was a common element of reaction (to the letter),''
Mitterrand spokesman Hubert Vedrine told reporters afterward, ``it
was that if Gorbachev's initiative was inspired by the desire to
insert the Soviet Union progressively into the world economy, that
is a good thing.''
   U.S. officials were intrigued by the overture, and White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the summit leaders found it
``positive and supportive.''
   But the officials also saw the idea as impractical, and one said
``It's going to be tough until he has a convertible ruble,'' in a
joking reference to the weak Soviet currency.
   On Saturday, the summit leaders issued declarations on China,
East-West relations, terrorism and human rights.
   The East-West declaration stated their willingness to give aid to
Poland and Hungary in support of moves toward democracy and a free
market economy. The summit partners noted the food scarcity in
Poland, and a European official said shipments of surplus food from
European Common Market stocks could begin within two weeks.
   The summit leaders denounced Beijing authorities for crushing the
pro-democracy movement, and urged the World Bank to deny new loans
to China.
   They also pledged to guard against human rights violations and
condemned terrorism.
   Apparently referring to Iran and its surrogates in Lebanon and
Syria, the leaders called for those with influence over
hostage-takers to bring about the release of the captives. Fifteen
foreigners are being held in Lebanon, including the citizens of
three summit nations, the United States, Italy and Britain.
   The leaders also agreed to set up an international task force to
trace laundered money as a way of fighting the international trade
in illicit drugs.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the communique issued Sunday by
the leaders of the seven largest industrialized democracies at the
15th World Economic Summit.
   1. We, the heads of state or government of seven major industrial
nations and the president of the Commission of the European
Communities, have met in Paris for the 15th annual Economic Summit.
The Summit of the Arch initiates a new round of summits to succeed
those begun at Rambouillet in 1975 and at Versailles in 1982. The
round beginning in 1982 has seen one of the longest periods of
sustained growth since the Second World War. These summits have
permitted effective consultations, offered the opportunity to launch
initiatives and to strengthen international cooperation.
   2. This year's world economic situation presents three main
challenges:
   _The choice and the implementation of measures needed to maintain
balanced and sustained growth, counter inflation, create jobs and
promote social justice. These measures should also facilitate the
adjustment of external imbalances, promote international trade and
investment, and improve the economic situation of developing
countries.
   _The development and the further integration of developing
countries into the world economy. Whilst there has been substantial
progress in many developing countries, particularly those
implementing sound economic policies, the debt burden and the
persistence of poverty, often made worse by natural disasters
affecting hundreds of millions of people, are problems of deep
concern which we must continue to face in a spirit of solidarity.
   _The urgent need to safeguard the environment for future
generations. Scientific studies have revealed the existence of
serious threats to our environment such as the depletion of the
stratospheric ozone layer, excessive emissions of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases which could lead to future climate changes.
Protecting the environment calls for a determined and concerted
international response and for the early adoption, worldwide, of
policies based on sustainable development.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   3. Growth has been sustained by focusing policies on improving
the efficiency and flexibility of our economies and by strengthening
our cooperative efforts and the coordination process. In the medium
term, the current buoyant investment seen during this period should
pave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and help
reduce the dangers of inflation. The outlook is not, however,
without risks.
   4. Until now, the threat of inflation in many countries has been
contained, thanks to the concerted efforts of governments and
monetary authorities. But continued vigilance is required and
inflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive a firm
policy response so that it will be put on a downward path.
   5. While some progress has been made in reducing external
imbalances, the momentum of adjustment has recently weakened
markedly; there needs to be further progress in adjusting external
imbalances through cooperation.
   6. In countries with fiscal and current account deficits,
including the United States of America, Canada and Italy, further
reductions in budget deficits are needed. Action will be taken to
bring them down. This may help reduce the savings-investment gap and
external imbalances, contribute to countering inflation and
encourage greater exchange rate stability in a context of decreasing
interest rates.
   7. Countries with external surpluses, including Japan and
Germany, should continue to pursue appropriate macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms that will encourage non-inflationary
growth of domestic demand and facilitate external adjustment.
   8. All our countries share the responsibility for the sound
development of the world economy. Over the medium term, deficit
countries have to play a key role in global adjustment through their
external adjustment and increased exports; surplus countries have to
contribute to sustaining global expansion through policies providing
favorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports.
   9. The emergence of the newly industrializing economies and the
initiation of a dialogue with them are welcome. We call on those
with substantial surpluses to contribute to the adjustment of
external imbalances and the open trade and payments system. To that
end, they should permit exchange rates to reflect their competitive
position, implement GATT commitments and reduce trade barriers.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS AND COORDINATION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   10. Under the Plaza and Louvre agreements, our countries agreed
to pursue, in a mutually reinforcing way, policies of surveillance
and coordination aimed at improving their economic fundamentals and
at fostering stability of exchange rates consistent with those
economic fundamentals.
   There has been progress in the multilateral surveillance and
coordination of economic policies with a view to ensuring internal
consistency of domestic policies and their international
compatibility. The procedures to be used have been more clearly
defined and improved in cooperation with the International Monetary
Fund.
   11. The coordination process has made a positive contribution to
world economic development and it has also contributed greatly to
improving the functioning of the International Monetary System.
There has also been continued cooperation in exchange markets.
   It is important to continue, and where appropriate, to develop
this cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioning
and the stability of the International Monetary System in a manner
consistent with economic fundamentals. We therefore ask the finance
ministers to continue to keep under review possible steps that could
be taken to improve the coordination process, exchange market
cooperation, and the functioning of the International Monetary
System.
   12. We welcome the decision to complete the work on the ninth
review of the International Monetary Fund quotas with a view to a
decision on this matter before the end of the years.
   We note that the question of a resumption of SDR allocation
remains under consideration in the Executive Board of the
International Monetary Fund.
   13. Within the European Community, the European Monetary System
has contributed to a significant degree of economic policy
convergence and monetary stability.

<NOTE>IMPROVING ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   14. We will continue to promote measures in order to remove
inefficiencies in our economies. These inefficiencies affect many
aspects of economic activity, reduce potential growth rates and the
prospects for job creation, diminish the effectiveness of
macroeconomic policies and impede the external adjustment process.
   In this context, tax reforms, modernization of financial markets,
strengthening of competition policies and reducing rigidities in all
sectors including energy, industry and agriculture are necessary. So
are the improvement of education and vocational training,
transportation and distribution systems and further policies aimed
at giving more flexibility and mobility to the labor market and
reducing unemployment.
   Within the European Community, the steady progress toward
completion by the end of 1992 of the program contained in the Single
Act has already given a strong momentum to economic efficiency.
   15. The decline of saving in some of our countries in this decade
is a cause of concern. This lower level of saving can contribute to
high real interest rates and therefore hamper growth. Inadequate
saving and large fiscal deficits are associated with large external
deficits. We recommend, within the frameweork of policy
coordination, policies to encourage saving and remove hinderances
where they exist.
   16. Financial activities are being increasingly carried out with
new techniques on a worldwide basis. As regards insider trading,
which could hamper the credibility of financial markets, regulations
vary greatly among our countries. These regulations have been
recently, or are in the process of being, strengthened.
International cooperation should be pursued and enhanced.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TRADE ISSUES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   17. World trade developed rapidly last year. Yet protectionism
remains a real threat. We strongly reaffirm our determination to
fight it in all its forms.
   We shall fulfill the Punta de Este standstill and rollback
commitments which, inter alia, require the avoidance of any trade
restrictive or distorting measure inconsistent with the provisions
of the General Agreement and its instruments.
   We agree to make effective use of the improved GATT dispute
settlement mechanism and to make progress in negotiations for
further improvements. We will avoid any discriminatory or autonomous
actions, which undermined the principles of the GATT and the
integrity of the multilateral trading system.
   We also are pledged to oppose the tendency toward unilateralism,
bilateralism, sectoralism and managed trade which threatens to
undermine the multilateral system and Uruguay Round negotiations.
   18. The successful negotiation of the Trade Negotiations
Committee of the Uruguay Round in Geneva last April, thereby
completing the midterm review, is a very important achievement. It
gives a clear framework for future work in all sectors including the
pursuit of agricultural reform in the short term as well as in the
long term. It also gives the necessary framework for substantive
negotiations in important sectors not yet fully included in GATT
disciplines, such as services, trade-related investment measures and
intellectural property.
   Developed countries participated actively in these negotiations
and contributed to this success. All countries should make their
most constructive contribution possible.
   We express our full commitment to making further substantive
progress in the Uruguay Round in order to complete it by the end of
1990.
   19. We note with satisfaction the entry into force of the Free
Trade Agreeement betwen Canada and the United States, as well as
more recent initiatives to intensify the close economic relations
between the European Community and EFTA countries. It remains our
policy that these and other developments in regional cooperation,
should be trade-creating and complementary to the multilateral
liberalization process.
   20. It is the firm intention of the European Community that the
trade aspects of the single market program should also be
trade-creating and complementary to the multilateral liberalization
process.
   21. We note with satisfaction the progress that has been made in
strengthening the multilateral disciplines on trade and aid
distorting export credit subsidies. This effort must be pursued
actively and completed in the competent bodies of the OECD with a
view to improving present guidelines at the earliest possible date.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GENERAL PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPMENT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   22. Development is a shared global challenge. We shall help
developing countries by opening the world trading system and by
supporting their structural adjustment. We shall encourage too,
economic diversification in commodity dependent countries and the
creation of a favorable environment for transfers of technology and
capital flows.
   We underline the continuing importance of official development
assistance and welcome the increased efforts of summit participants
in this respect. We note the targets already established by
international organizations for the future level of official
development assistance and stress the importance of overall
financial flows to devlopment.
   We underline simultaneously the importance attached to the
quality of the aid and to the evaluation of the projects and
programs financed.
   23. We urge developing countries to implement sound economic
policies. A vital factor will be the adoption of financial and
fiscal policies which attract inward investment and encourage growth
and the return of flight capital.
   24. We note with satisfaction that there has been substantial
progress in the multilateral aid initiative for the Philippines that
was given special attention in the Toronto economic declaration.
   25. Faced with the worrying economic situation of Yugoslavia, we
encourage its government to implement a strong economic reforms
program that can command bilateral and multilateral support.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE SITUATION IN THE POOREST COUNTRIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   26. The enhancement of the International Monetary Fund Structural
Adjustment Facility, the World Bank special program of assistance
for the poorest and most indebted countries and the fifth
replenishment of the African Development Fund are all important
measures benefiting those countries having embarked upon an
adjustment process. We stress the importance attached to a
substantial replenishment of Intenational Development Association
resources.

   27. As we urged last year in Toronto, the Paris Club reached a
consensus in September 1988 on the conditions of implementation of
significant reduction of debt service payments for the poorest
countries. Thirteen countries have already benefited by this
decision.
   28. We welcome the increasing grant element in the development
assistance as well as the steps taken to convert loans into grants
and we urge further steps to this end. Flexibility in development
aid as much as in debt rescheduling is required.
   29. We attach great importance to the efficient and successful
preparation of the next general conference of the United Nations on
the least developed countries, which will take place in Paris in
1990.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>STRENGTHENED DEBT STRATEGY FOR THE HEAVILY INDEBTED COUNTRIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   30. Our approach to the debt problems has produced signficant
results, but serious challenges remain: In many countries the ratio
of debt service to exports remains high, financing for growth
promoting investment is scarce, and capital flight is a key problem.
An improvement in the investment climate must be a critical part of
efforts to achieve a sustainable level of growth without excessive
levels of debt. These improvements of the current situation depend
above all on sustained and effective adjustment policies in the
debtor countries.
   31. To address these challenges, we are strongly committed to the
strengthened debt strategy. This will rely, on a case-by-case basis,
on the following actions:
   _Borrowing countries should implement, with the assistance of the
Fund and the Bank, sound economic policies, particularly designed to
mobilize savings, stimulate investment and reverse capital flight;
   _Banks should increasingly focus on voluntary, market-based debt
and debt service reduction operations, as a complement to new
lending;
   _The International Monetary Fund and World Bank will support
significant debt reduction by setting aside a portion of
policy-based loans;
   _Limited interest support will be provided, through additional
financing by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, for
transactions involving significant debt and debt service reduction.
For that purpose the use of escrow accounts is agreed;
   _Continued Paris Club rescheduling and flexibility of
export-credit agencies;
   _Strengthening of the international financial institutions
capability for supporting medium-term macroeconomic and structural
adjustment programs and for compensating the negative effects of
export shortfalls and external shocks.
   32. In the framework of this strategy:
   _We welcome the recent decisions taken by the two institutions to
encourage debt and debt service reduction which provide adequate
resources for these purposes;
   _We urge debtor countries to move ahead promptly to develop
strong economic reform programs that may lead to debt and debt
service reductions in accordance with the guidelines defined by the
two Bretton Woods institutions;
   _We urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches in
their negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly to
conclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction,
debt service reduction and new money. We stress that official
creditors should not substitute for private lenders. Our governments
are prepared to consider as appropriate tax, regulatory and
accounting practices with a view to eliminating unnecessary
obstacles to debt and debt service reductions.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ENVIRONMENT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   33. There is growing awareness throughout the world of the
necessity to preserve better the global ecological balance. This
includes serious threats to the atmosphere, which could lead to
future climate changes. We note with great concern the growing
pollution of air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas; acid rain;
dangerous substances; and the rapid desertification and
deforestation. Such environmental degradation endangers species and
undermines the well-being of individuals and societies.
   Decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect the
Earth's ecological balance. We will work together to achieve the
common goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environment
in order to meet shared economic and social objectives and to carry
out obligations to future generations.
   34. We urge all countries to give further impetus to scientific
research on environmental issues, to develop necessary technologies
and to make clear evaluations of the economic costs and benefits of
environmental policies.
   The persisting uncertainty on some of these issues should not
unduly delay our action.
   In this connection, we ask all countries to combine their efforts
in order to improve observation and monitoring on a global scale.
   35. We believe that international cooperation also needs to be
enhanced in the field of technology and technology transfer in order
to reduce pollution or provide alternative solutions.
   36. We believe that industry has a crucial role in preventing
pollution at source, in waste minimization, in energy conservation,
and in the design and marketing of cost-effective clean
technologies. The agricultural sector must also contribute to
tackling problems such as water pollution, soil erosion and
desertification.
   37. Environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade,
development, energy, transport, agriculture and economic planning.
Therefore, environmental considerations must be taken into account
into economic decision-making. In fact, good economic policies and
good environmental policies are mutually reinforcing.
   In order to achieve sustainable development, we shall ensure the
compatibility of economic growth and development with the protection
of the environment. Environmental protection and related investment
should contribute to economic growth. In this respect, intensified
efforts for technological breakthrough are important to reconcile
economic growth and environmental policies.

<HEAD>Worst Artillery Duels in Two Months Leave Buildings Ablaze; One Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIAD KAHWAJI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockets and shells rained down on Beirut
on Sunday, leaving buildings and cars in flames as Syrian and
Christian gunners fought one of their heaviest duels in nearly two
months. Police said one person died and 27 were wounded.
   The bombardment began at dusk Saturday and raged through Sunday
in the streets of Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors.
   Tens of thousands of residents spent the night in basements and
bomb shelters as about 1,500 shells and rockets hit the city, which
has been without electricity and water for two days.
   There was a two-hour lull at daybreak, allowing people to venture
out to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. The shelling resumed at
midmorning.
   The new casualties raised the overall toll to 418 dead and 1,673
injured since the current round of fighting broke out March 8
between Syrian troops and the mainly Christian troops of Army Gen.
Michel Aoun.
   ``It's almost two months since we were pounded with such
intensity,'' said a resident of the Christian district of Sin el-Fil
in east Beirut. Refusing to be named, he said 40 rockets hit his
neighborhood in one minute.
   The duels began with a Syrian barrage on the coastline of the
Christian enclave. The Syrians have been shelling the coast in an
effort to prevent shipments of food, fuel and arms from reaching the
Christians.
   A spokeman for Aoun's command, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Syrian shelling targeted two ships that were
trying to enter the port of Byblos, 19 miles north of Beirut.
   ``One fuel tanker managed to slip through the Syrian barrage,
while the other ship that carried food supplies veered back toward
international waters,'' the spokesman said.
   He would not give the ships' identities or say who owned them.
   Police said Aoun's gunners struck back with 155mm howitzers,
targeting Syrian batteries along west Beirut's seaside districts of
Ein Mreisseh, Raouche and Ramlet al-Baida.
   ``The shelling then steadily escalated into random bombardment of
residential neighborhoods,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be
named under standing regulations.
   The Syrians insist on maintaining their blockade of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave, despite repeated pleas from the
Arab League for a cease-fire.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a Moslem Cabinet
vying for legitimacy with a Christian military Cabinet led by Aoun,
said he was ``deeply worried by the spiraling escalation of
hostilities.''
   He appealed to the Arab League to intensify its efforts to stop
the fighting.
   The Syrians maintain about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
Arab League mandate to end Lebanon's civil war, now in its 15th year.
   The latest round of violence broke out when Aoun blockaded Moslem
ports he said were depriving his government of $100 million in taxes
annually. The Syrians in turn blockaded Christian ports, and Aoun
vowed a ``war of liberation'' to drive the Syrian army out.
   Druse and Shiite Moslem militias allied with Syria are demanding
Aoun's removal as a precondition for any peace with the Christians.

<TEXT>
   Clear assessments of the costs, benefits and resource
implications of environmental protection should help governments to
take the necessary decisions on the mix of price signals (e.g. taxes
or expenditures) and regulatory actions, reflecting where possible
the full value of natural resources.
   We encourage the World Bank and regional development banks to
integrate environmental considerations into their activities.
International organizations, such as the OECD and the United Nations
and its affiliated organizations, will be asked to develop further
techniques of analysis which would help governments assess
appropriate economic measures to promote the quality of the
environment. We ask the OECD, within the context of its work on
integrating environment and economic decision-making, to examine
selected environmental indicators that could be developed. We expect
the 1992 U.N. Conference on Environment and Development to give
additional momentum to the protection of the global environment.
   38. To help developing countries deal with past damage and to
encourage them to take environmentally desirable action, economic
incentives may include the use of aid mechanisms and specific
transfer of technology. In special cases, ODA debt forgiveness and
debt-for-nature swaps can play a useful role in environmental
protection.
   We also emphasize the necessity to take into account the
interests and needs of developing countries in sustaining the growth
of their economies and the financial and technological requirements
to meet environmental challenges.
   39. The depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is alarming
and calls for prompt action.
   We welcome the Helsinki conclusions related, among other issues,
to the complete abandonment of the production and consumption of
chlorofluorocarbons covered by the Montreal protocol as soon as
possible and not later than the end of the century. Specific
attention must also be given to those ozone-depleting substances not
covered by the Montreal protocol. We shall promote the development
and use of suitable substitute substances and technologies. More
emphasis should be placed on projects that provide alternatives to
chlorofluorocarbons.
   40. We strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions of
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten to induce
climate change, endangering the environment and ultimately the
economy. We strongly suppport the work undertaken by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, on this issue.
   We need to strengthen the worldwide network of observatories for
greenhouse gases and supoport the World Meteorological Organization
initiative to establish a global climatological reference network to
detect climate changes.
   41. We agree that increasing energy efficiency could make a
substantial contribution to these goals. We urge international
organizations concerned to encourage measures, including economic
measures, to improve energy conservation and, more broadly,
efficiency in the use of energy of all kinds and to promote relevant
techniques and technologies.
   We are committed to maintaining the highest safety standards for
nuclear power plants and to strengthening international cooperation
in safe operation of power plants and waste management, and we
recognize that nuclear power also plays an inmportant role in
limiting output of greenhouse gases.
   42. Deforestation also damages the atmosphere and must be
reversed. We call for the adoption of sustainable forest management
practices, with a view to preserving the scale of world forests. The
relevant international organizations will be asked to complete
reports on the state of the world's forests by 1990.
   43. Preserving the tropical forests is an urgent need for the
world as a whole. While recognizing the sovereign rights of
developing countries to make use of their natural resources, we
encourage, through a sustainable use of tropical forests, the
protection of all the species therein and the traditional rights to
land and other resources of local communities. We welcome the German
initiative in this field as a basis for progress.
   To this end, we give strong support to rapid implementation of
the Tropical Forest Action Plan which was adopted in 1986 in the
framework of the Food and Agricultural Organization. We appeal to
both consumer and producer countries, which are united in the
International Tropical Timber Organization, to join their efforts to
ensure better conservation of the forests. We express our readiness
to assist the efforts of nations with tropical forests through
financial and technical cooperation, and in international
organizations.
   44. Temperate forests, lakes and rivers must be protected against
the effects of acid pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides. It is necessary to pursue actively the bilateral and
multilateral efforts to this end.
   45. The increasing complexity of the issues related to the
protection of the atmosphere calls for innovative solutions. New
instruments may be contemplated. We believe that the conclusion of a
framework or umbrella convention on climate change to set out
general principles or guidelines is urgently required to mobilize
and rationalize the efforts made by the international community.
   We welcome the work under way by the United Nations Environment
Program, in cooperation with the World Meteorological Organization,
drawing on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
and the results of other international meetings. Specific protocols
containing concrete commitments could be fitted into the framework
as scientific evidence requires and permits.

   An earthquake hit the northeastern Aegean
Sea early Sunday, frightening some islanders but causing no damage
or injuries, officials said.
   The tremor at 6:28 a.m. measured 4.1 on the Richter scale and was
centered in the sea near Lesbos Island, 180 miles northeast of the
capital, the Athens Seismological Service said.
   Island police said the quake caused some anxiety among the
residents and tourists but that no damage was reported.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a

<HEAD>Briton Convicted of Heroin Smuggling Loses Death Sentence Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British man sentenced to death
for drug smuggling has lost his last appeal and is likely to be
hanged soon, his lawyer said Sunday.
   Derrick Gregory, a 39-year-old painter from Middlesex, had his
appeal for clemency denied last week by the Penang state pardon
board, said his lawyer, Rasiah Rajasingam.
   ``After this, there are no more avenues for appeal. It is up to
the prison authorities to set the date for the hanging, normally
between two to six weeks,'' Rajasingam said in a telephone interview
from Penang, 180 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur.
   Gregory was convicted in March 1987 of possessing 20 ounces of
heroin, which was found hidden in his boots and underwear at Penang
airport in 1982. Since a law was passed in 1975 mandating the death
sentence for drug trafficking, 221 people have been sentenced to
death. Of these, 80 have been hanged.

   46. We condemn indiscriminate use of oceans as dumping grounds
for polluting waste. There is a particular problem with the
deterioration of coastal waters. To ensure the sustainable
management of the marine environment, we recognize the importance of
international cooperation in preserving it and conserving the living
resources of the sea. We call for the relevant bodies of the United
Nations to prepare a report on the state of the world's oceans.
   We express our concern that national, regional and global
capabilities to contain and alleviate the consequences of maritime
oil spills be improved. We urge all countries to make better use of
the latest monitoring and clean-up technologies. We ask all
countries to adhere to and implement fully the international
conventions for the prevention of oil pollution of the oceans. We
also ask the International Maritime Organization to put forward
proposals for further preventive action.
   47. We are committed to ensuring full implementation of existing
rules for the environment. In this respect, we note with interest
the initiative of the Italian government to host in 1990 a forum on
international law for the environment with scholars, scientific
experts and officials, to consider the need for a digest of existing
rules and to give in-depth consideration to the legal aspects of
environment at the international level.
   48. We advocate that existing environment institutions be
strengthened within the United Nations system. In particular, the
United Nations Environment Program urgently requires strengthening
and increased financial support. Some of us have agreed that the
establishment within the United Nations of a new institution may
also be worth considering.
   49. We have taken note of the report of the sixth conference on
bioethics held in Brussels which examined the elaboration of a
universal code of environmental ethics based upon the concept of the
``human stewardship of nature.''
   50. It is a matter of international concern that Bangladesh, one
of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world, is
periodically devastated by catastrophic floods.
   We stress the urgent need for effective, coordinated action by
the international community, in support of the government of
Bangladesh, in order to find solutions to this major problem which
are technically, financially, economically and environmentally
sound. In that spirit, and taking account of help already given, we
take note of the different studies concerning flood alleviation,
initiated by France, Japan, the U.S. and the United Nations
Development Program, which have been reviewed by experts from all
our countries. We welcome the World Bank's agreement, following
those studies, to coordinate the efforts of the international
community so that a sound basis for achieving a real improvement in
alleviating the effects of flood can be established. We also welcome
the agreement of the World Bank to chair, by the end of the year, a
meeting to be held in the United Kingdom by invitation of the
Bangladesh government, of the countries willing to take an active
part in such a program.
   51. We give political support to projects such as the joint
project to set up an observatory of the Saharan areas, which answers
the need to monitor the development of that rapidly deteriorating,
fragile, arid region, in order to protect it more effectively.

   52. The drug problem has reached devastating proportions. We
stress the urgent need for decisive action, both on a national and
an international basis. We urge all countries, especially those
where drug production, trading and consumption are large, to join
our efforts to counter drug production, to reduce demand, and to
carry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the
laundering of its proceeds.
   53. Accordingly, we resolve to take the following measures within
relevant fora:
   _Give greater emphasis on bilateral and United Nations programs
for the conversion of illicit cultivation in the producer countries.
The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC), and other
United Nations and multilateral organizations should be supported,
strengthened and made more effective. These efforts could include
particular support for the implementation of effective programs to
stop drug cultivation and trading as well as developmental and
technical assistance.
   _Support the efforts of producing countries who ask for
assistance to counter illegal production or trafficking.
   _Strengthen the role of the United Nations in the war against
drugs through an increase in its resources and through reinforced
effectiveness of its operation.
   _Intensify the exchange of information on the prevention of
addiction, and rehabilitation of drug addicts.
   _Support the international conference planned for l990 on cocaine
and drug demand reduction.
   _Strengthen the efficiency of the cooperative and mutual
assistance on these issues, the first steps being a prompt adhesion
to, ratification and implementation of the Vienna Convention on
illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.
   _ Conclude further bilateral or multilateral agreements and
support initiatives and cooperation, where appropriate, which
include measures to facilitate the identification, tracing,
freezing, seizure and forfeiture of drug crime proceeds.
   _Convene a financial action task force from summit participants
and other countries interested in these problems. Its mandate is to
assess the results of cooperation already undertaken in order to
prevent the utilization of the banking system and financial
institutions for the purpose of money laundering, and to consider
additional preventive efforts in this field, including the
adaptation of the legal and regulatory systems so as to enhance
multinational judicial assistance. The first meeting of this task
force will be called by France and its report will be completed by
April 1990.

   Hundreds of amateur artists on Sunday sang,
danced and staged dramas in a downtown park in a reenactment of the
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last month.
   While most groups re-created scenes of students braving bullets
and tanks, others ridiculed Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping, Yang
Shangkun and Li Peng by wearing masks depicting them.
   Twenty-five organizations, including bands, theater groups and
dance troupes sponsored and participated in the event, which was
attended by thousands of people.
   One group taught songs sung by Chinese students during the
pro-democracy movement, which was crushed June 3-4 in Beijing.
   Buttons with a Chinese flag in black or Chinese characters
reading ``counterrevolutionary clique'' were on sale. Organizers
said profits would go to Art Support, a non-profit organization

   Chinese education officials said teaching Marxism
should take priority over reading and arithmetic, newspapers
reported Sunday.
   ``Education must serve socialism,'' the Communist Party
newspaper, the People's Daily, quoted Education Minster Li Tieying
as telling college and provincial education officials Saturday at
the end of a three-day special meeting.
   ``We must not allow the lecture platforms of socialist
universities to be used for the wanton dissemination of
bourgeois-liberal views,'' Li said, referring to Western ideas. He
said colleges wrongly had put ``intellectual education'' before
ideological and moral teaching.
   Since crushing student-led protests for a freer society six weeks
ago, Chinese leaders have expressed determination not only to round
up those involved in the protests but to root out what they see as
the causes _ especially Western ideas.
   They have jammed radio signals from the U.S. government-run Voice
of America, turned off local hotels' reception of foreign television
broadcasts, and banned sales of foreign newspapers and magazines in
Beijing.
   But their greatest efforts have been directed at reeducating the
tens of thousands of students who marched nationwide under banners
demanding freedom and democracy, and who the leaders say were misled
by professors with anti-socialist ideas.
   ``We must be full of warmth toward the broad masses of students
but also make strict demands,'' Communist Party General Secretary
Jiang Zemin told party Youth League officials from around the
country.
   ``We must strengthen patriotic and socialist ideological
education and strengthen education in national pride, national
morality and (the correct) world view,'' television quoted Jiang as
saying at the meeting Sunday.
   In a separate forum, party secretaries from major universities
met with the editorial board of the Guangming Daily, a newspaper for
intellectuals, and puzzled over why so many products of a socialist
education system were dissatisfied with socialism.
   Several blamed Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted as party chief June 24
for allegedly supporting the protests.
   ``We must save those students who suffered spiritual damage due
to the ... 50 days of counterrevolutionary propaganda, rumors and
incitement,'' the paper quoted the deputy party secretary of Qinghua
University, He Meiying, as saying. Graduating seniors in Beijing
already have undergone several weeks of special political classes,
and underclassmen face a month of concentrated political education
in August and September.
   The impact of the classes remains to be seen. Even after the
government condemned the student protests as counterrevolutionary
and sent the army to crush them June 3-4, many students said
privately they had not dropped their goal of reforming China's
closed, one-party system.
   In other developments, a Shanghai worker was sentenced to 12
years in prison for attacking two drivers of a train that plowed
into a crowd of protesters June 6, killing six people.
   An angry crowd set the train on fire, and three men later were
convicted of arson and executed.
   The Shanghai-based Liberation Daily said Jiang Xidi, a factory
worker, was sentenced Friday by a city district court. The same
court sentenced a private tradesman to 3{ years in prison and a
peasant to four years for shouting reactionary slogans and letting
the air out of bus tires to barricade city roads.
   An unemployed man was sentenced to 11 years for shouting
reactionary slogans, incitement and spreading rumors.

<HEAD>Proposed EPA Rules Could Eliminate Sludge-To-Fertilizer Option</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Municipal waste treatment officials across the
nation fear proposed government standards for sewage sludge disposal
are so restrictive they will kill what many regard as the best way
to get rid of the waste: Turn it into fertilizer and compost.
   ``The new regulations make it just about impossible to do
anything with sludge'' except burn it or dump it in landfills, said
Paul F. Levy, executive director of the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, facing a law suit from
environmentalists to meet a congressional mandate, issued proposed
rules early this year to regulate the amounts of toxic materials in
sludge.
   But waste treatment officials have attacked the regulations,
saying they are based on flawed information and overly pessimistic
scenarios.
   ``The draft regulations have gone much further than is needed to
protect the public health, and by doing so the EPA will set back the
whole effort of beneficial use,'' said Robert R. Perry, deputy
director of the Water Pollution Control Federation, an association
of municipal waste officials and engineers. ``It will force more and
more communities into incineration or simply landfilling sludge.''
   John M. Walker, a scientist in the EPA's Office of Municipal
Pollution Control, agreed that the draft rules are excessive and
predicted the regulations will be changed before they are finalized.
   The EPA officials who drafted the regulations ``erred at being
too conservative, using worst-case scenarios that really couldn't
occur,'' Walker said.
   Perry called the draft regulations ``among the most complex and
controversial ever developed by EPA.''
   Levy said the regulations, as written, would force his agency to
scrap plans to transform Boston area sludge _ now being dumped into
Boston Harbor at a rate of 70 tons a day _ into fertilizer that
would be sold to citrus growers in Florida.
   ``We must be permitted to successfully recycle sludge and we must
have regulations permitting its use in a variety of beneficial
manners,'' he said. ``Without that ability, there will be no
environmentally safe and effective manner to dispose of sludge
without creating problems elsewhere.''
   The regulations also would kill programs already in place, such
as the sale of a sludge-to-compost product produced by the
Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. The Maryland-made compost,
which has been used on the White House lawn, has a waiting list of
potential customers.
   ``It's not that we're opposed to the concept of sludge
regulation. We support it,'' said Charles Murray, head of the
commission's sludge operations. ``The problem is (EPA's regulations)
have some fundamental flaws in the way they are developed which
resulted in regulations which really discourage beneficial reuse.
And that's contrary to EPA's own stated policy.''
   In designing its theoretical models, the EPA created a
``mega-eater'' who is simultaneously a teen-ager, a man, a woman and
a senior citizen, Levy said. This person is expected to consume
eight different vegetables every day for 70 years.
   Levy said restrictions on copper and zinc would reduce the use of
a sludge-to-compost product to a maximum of 0.04 inches thick, less
than the thickness of a sheet of paper.
   ``That's just not reasonable,'' said Perry. ``You would have to
put it on in such small quantities that the farmers wouldn't be
interested in doing it.''
   The Department of Agriculture recommends one-half inch to six
inches of compost.
   Levy also complained that requiring compost and fertilizer labels
to include the names and quantities of 22 pollutants would be
``meaningless and confusing and even could be intimidating to the
average user.'' He said a statement saying the product is in
compliance with EPA regulations should be sufficient.
   Municipal waste officials are optimistic EPA will change the
rules in the wake of the intense criticism.
   ``We're confident the agency will recognize those flaws and make
the appropriate changes,'' Murray said.
   Environmentalists at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which
has filed suit to push for sewer sludge regulations, said they had
not sufficiently analyzed the controversial draft rules for the land
use of sludge. But they quickly attacked as too weak proposed
regulations of sludge disposal in landfills and incinerators.
   ``We are quite concerned about the levels of risk the EPA appears
to consider acceptable for incineration and landfills,'' said
Jessica Landman, senior attorney at the environmental group.

   A 10,000-pound block of ice might not be
everyone's idea of a sweet gift, but for John Matar, it was the
essence of brotherly love.
   ``His nice side is coming out,''' said Matar, after the massive
ice cube was dumped in front of his South Side restaurant Friday, a
gift from brother Sam. ``I think he might have some feelings in him.
This is a big relief.''
   For the last 14 years, the brothers have engaged in a sibling
rivalry, expressed in birthday gifts, that has at times looked more
like civil war. The gifts they exchanged have included 100 skunks,
8-foot lizards, a herd of cows and tons of manure.
   Last year, Sam Matar, of Carmel, Calif., sent two truckloads of
plastic foam ``peanuts'' to fill John's living and dining rooms.
   Sam, who has received a ton of gravel, an orangutan and a
marching band playing ``Happy Birthday'' from his brother, said the
ice didn't mean their relationship was cool.
   ``He screams about the 100 skunks,'' Sam Matar said. ``But they
were cute.''

   The San Francisco Zoo's youngest koala has
been officially named after an Aborigine good-luck stone, after a
former zoo administrator's entry was chosen from a field of 15,000
contestants.
   Called ``Tjuringa,'' the stone also signifies creation, zoo
officials said.
   For the first seven months of his life, the koala was known as
Baby Schnooks. But the new name was chosen from thousands of entries
from as far away as Germany in a Name the Koala competition held by
the zoo.
   The winner was Ola Kupka, who left her job as associate director
of development for the zoo in December. Zoo officials said the name
was picked on its merits, however, not because of who thought of it.
   The baby koala snuggled in his mother's pouch Saturday, smelling
sort of like cough drops from the steady diet of eucalyptus.
   Kupka, who came up with the name by looking through an
encyclopedia, said in her entry letter that if she won the offered
six-day trip to Brisbane, Australia, she would take along several
disabled people from the Recreation Center for the Handicapped,
where she now works.
   Entries arrived from Mexico, Canada, Germany and throughout the
United States, said Kathleen Harper, who sifted through the
thousands of entries to narrow the field.
   ``People who'd seen it voted to name it Fuzzy or Cuddles or
Schnuckems,'' Harper said. Others took the Australian approach and
offered names like Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Crocodile Dundee,
she said.
   Harper narrowed the entries to five finalists and took them to 19
judges, she said.

<TEXT>
   Broadcasting and sales-pitch taboos may be falling
in response to rising public tolerance, but a Florida legal panel is
considering imposing the nation's most comprehensive restrictions on
lawyers' advertising.
   The proposal, expected to be presented to the Florida Bar board
of governors Wednesday, is touted by supporters as necessary to
return integrity to the profession.
   But others claim it's an obvious constitutional violation that
ultimately would be rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court, which opened
up broadcast and mail advertising to lawyers 12 years ago.
   ``It's really all a matter of their pocketbooks,'' said Harry
Jacobs, a personal-injury attorney in the Orlando area who has
advertised on television for two years. ``Many of the established
attorneys just don't like the idea of a younger attorney building up
the kind of practice in five or six years it took them 10 or 12
years to make.''
   Several other states have restricted lawyers' advertising. But
the Florida proposal has attracted national attention because of the
nearly $6.5 million the state's lawyers spent on commercials last
year and the widespread use by smaller practitioners of direct-mail
solicitations to accident victims.
   ``Lawyer advertising in Florida is bigger than in most states,''
said Bill Wagner, a Tampa attorney and president of the Association
of Trial Lawyers of America. ``There is a lot of concern about this
issue right now, and what happens in Florida could set the tone for
similar action in other states.''
   The proposal would prohibit background music and theatrics, such
as the re-enactment of accidents. Also banned would be endorsements
from celebrities or others not in the law firm.
   ``All that would be left would be to show a business card on the
screen _ no motion, no jingles, no slogans,'' said David W. Singer,
a personal-injury lawyer in southern Florida who is widely known for
his television commercials. ``These kind of restrictions are
unprecedented in this day and age.''
   In one of Singer's ads, a barber tells a squirming little boy
that if he doesn't sit still, ``I'll cut off your ear.'' The boy
spins the chair around and says that if the barber does, he'll call
Singer. The commercial then cuts away to Singer, who says ``no case
is too small.''
   The restrictions also would outlaw using addresses from police
accident reports for direct-mail solicitation. The Legislature this
year passed a bill banning the use of police reports for commercial
purposes.
   Stephen Zack, president of the 44,000-member state bar, said the
present system cannot adequately control misleading and fraudulent
claims. And he said it causes a high rate of juror disqualifications
because of people's negative perceptions of the ads.
   ``We've had people who see the ads and say they no longer have
any respect for our system,'' said Zack.
   But others claim that advertising benefits all attorneys by
disseminating information about legal rights and making lawyers
appear more accessible.
   ``We've had many people come in saying that they would have had
no idea how to contact a lawyer until they saw our ads,'' said
Singer. ``This is what they are trying to control? They are playing
with the First Amendment.''
   Even if passed by the 50-member board of governors, the
restrictions would still need approval from the state Supreme Court,
which must take note of earlier rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court
against strict limitations on attorney ads.
   In the latest challenge, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year
in a Kentucky case that a lawyer could engage in direct-mail
solicitations, but it said states could enact reasonable
restrictions.
   ``I would say the Florida situation would be on its way to the
Supreme Court,'' said Jerome Bogutz, a Philadelphia attorney and
president of the Advertising Commission of the American Bar
Association. ``Florida's rules go further than anyone else's. It's
like they are testing the court to see how far can they go.''

<HEAD>IRA Makes Railroad a Target</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KILNASAGGART, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just when it seemed safe to
ride the rails again, Irish Republican Army bombs have made train
service between Dublin and Belfast a day-to-day proposition.
   Service between the two capitals was disrupted again over the
weekend as the British Army gingerly removed a van abandoned beneath
a bridge at Meigh, about four miles north of the border of Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic.
   ``It was just a hoax,'' a spokesman for the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said Sunday afternoon, but it was one that took two
days to clear.
   IRA bombs often arrive in stolen vans, and the railroad has been
a prime target since the first explosion at the Kilnasaggart Bridge
on Dec. 16.
   Explosions and threats along the Northern Ireland side of the
border disrupted service for 53 days between Dec. 16 and mid-April,
and passenger traffic dropped 30 percent, according to Northern
Ireland Railways.
   Two months of peace ended June 17 when a bomb exploded near the
station at Garriaghy in suburban Belfast. There was another
explosion June 20 at another commuter station, and a flurry of false
reports that briefly closed the line.
   No one has been killed or injured in these incidents, though
there was a close call March 2 when a bomb exploded without warning
on a bridge four minutes before a passenger train was due.
   The recent problems have dented the railroad's hopes of
rebuilding traffic on the Dublin-Belfast line, a joint venture with
Irish Rail that normally carries 1,300 passengers a day on the
one-hour, 55-minute express journey. There is no scheduled bus or
air service between the cities.
   ``We always get passengers to their destinations,'' an executive
of Northern Ireland Railways said, though often that includes a bus
ride part of the way.
   Southbound trains from Belfast were stopped over the weekend at
Newry, and passengers were put aboard buses for a 12-mile ride to
Dundalk, in the Irish Republic, to resume their rail journey.
   The IRA, in a statement reported March 11 in the Belfast
Telegraph, said the bombings were ``part of a military strategy
aimed at forcing the British army out of fixed positions and border
bunkers.''
   The mostly Roman Catholic IRA, outlawed both by the British and
Irish governments, has waged a 20-year guerrilla campaign to drive
the British out of the Protestant-dominated province of Northern
Ireland and unite it with the Irish Republic.
   An explosion is often the bait to lure British soldiers near
other booby-trapped devices. One such trap, involving four explosive
devices, was planted in February at the Kilnasaggart bridge, which
is within 1,000 yards of the border.
   The area is known as ``bandit country,'' where narrow roads twist
and turn through pastures and thickets of trees, past walls
emblazoned with pro-IRA graffiti.
   The British army operates from hilltop forts, watching the
countryside from steel towers.
   On March 20, the IRA ambushed and killed two high-ranking
officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police
force, about three miles from Kilnasaggart.
   On April 12, explosives packed into a stolen van exploded without
warning in Warrenpoint, six miles to the northeast, killing a
19-year-old Catholic woman and causing extensive damage to property.
   Though little more than a wide place in the road, Kilnasaggart
has a rich deposit of history reflecting its strategic position
astride the Slighe Miodhluacdhra, the ancient route between southern
Ireland and the northern lands of Ulster.
   In a pasture below the bridge stands the Kilnasaggart Pillar
Stone, the 8th-century Christian carving on what appears to be a
prehistoric monolith.
   Above the bridge rises the ruined tower of Moyry Castle, built by
the British in 1601 during the suppression of a Gaelic rebellion led
by Hugh O'Neill.
   The bombings are ``sheer economic madness,'' says J.L. McCart, a
district council member for the Social Democratic and Labor Party,
the largest predominantly Catholic party in Northern Ireland.
   In his home in Warrenpoint, McCart proudly displays a silver

   The Smithsonian Institution was prepared to say
two University of Pennsylvania researchers invented the computer
until an Iowa congressman who helps hold the museum's purse strings
said Iowa State University should get the credit.
   The solution: Honor many ``early developments.''
   University of Pennsylvania researchers John W. Mauchly and J.
Presper Eckert completed building their ENIAC machine in 1945.
Utilizing thousands of vacuum tubes and taking up an entire
basement, it is often cited as the first electronic digital computer.
   But was it really?
   Rep. Neal Smith, the No. 3 Democrat on the House Appropriations
Committee, insists the credit should go to physicist John V.
Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry, who developed a
smaller machine at Iowa State University from 1937 to 1941.
   In an attempt to assuage Smith's wounded pride, the National
Museum of American History _ preparing a major exhibition on
information technology _ has decided to spread the credit among
several computer pioneers.
   ``We will not be presenting the ENIAC as the `original' or
`first' computer,'' said the museum's director, Roger M. Kennedy, in
a letter to Smith.
   He wrote that ``our presentation will rather show that there were
many early developments that led to the emergence of the computer
industry ... including of course the work of John Atanasoff and the
development of the ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania.''
   The exhibition also will recognize the pioneering work of Howard
Aiken at Harvard and George Stibitz at Bell Laboratories, Kennedy
said.
   What touched off the computer-inventor tiff was a newsletter
issued by the Smithsonian Institution, which runs the museum, saying
that the exhibition would include ``a walk through the ENIAC, the
first electronic digital computer.''
   Smith fired off a letter to Kennedy saying he was ``gravely
concerned'' that the exhibition would jeopardize the museum's
``unrivaled reputation ... for historical accuracy.''
   The congressman cited a 1973 federal court decision that
invalidated patents obtained by Mauchly and Eckert for ENIAC
(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). The court held that
``Eckert and Mauchly did not themselves first invent the automatic
electronic digital computer'' but instead derived their machine from
the work done earlier at Iowa State.
   ``I strongly urge you to review the documented facts of record
relating to Dr. Atanasoff's invention in the interests of avoiding
what would be both a historical inaccuracy and a monumental
injustice to a great American inventor,'' Smith wrote.
   In his reply, Kennedy said the museum was negotiating with Iowa
State for loan of the last remaining piece of the original
Atanasoff-Berry computer _ the memory drum _ and also a
``reconstructed breadboard model of the central unit.''
   ``These will be prominently displayed with appropriate
photographs and information about Atanasoff's role,'' he wrote.
   That was not enough for Smith. He still isn't satisfied.
   ``Mr. Kennedy's letter was welcome but it offered no new
information and failed to allay the concerns I had expressed,'' the
congressman said Friday in a statement.
   ``The central question is not whether Dr. Atanasoff's work will
be included in some minor way in the exhibition. The question is:
Will he be recognized as the inventor of the first electronic
digital computer, in accordance with the historical fact?''
   Smith suggested that the Atanasoff-Berry machine be exhibited as
the first electronic digital computer and the ENIAC as the first
programmable computer.
   ``The interests of both justice and history would be served and
the reputation of the Smithsonian for historical accuracy would not
be tarnished,'' Smith said.
   The corporate descendent of the ENIAC, meanwhile, is continuing
to side with Mauchly and Eckert. The University of Pennsylvania
researchers founded a company that was taken over by Sperry Rand in
1950, and Sperry subsequently merged with Burroughs to form Unisys
Corp.
   ``Complex inventions like the computer rarely have just one
parent,'' said John B. Wise, chief technology officer for Unisys.
``Encyclopedias generally start the history of the computer with the
invention of the abacus and list dozens of major contributors to
what is generally accepted as the first electronic digital computer,
the ENIAC.''

   A landslide buried a bus on a seaside road Sunday,
and news reports said eight people were killed and seven were
missing.
   The bus was traveling along the coast of the Sea of Japan in
Fukui prefecture, 200 miles west of Tokyo, when it was buried by
large rocks and dirt from an overhanging cliff, police spokesman
Noboru Tsujioka said.
   The landslide was caused by recent heavy rains, he said.
   Kyodo News Service said eight bodies were found under the
100-foot-wide landslide, and rescuers were searching for the other
seven people who had been on the bus.
   Kyodo News Service said the passengers were tourists returning
home from a resort where they had spent the night.
   Two other unoccupied vehicles parked along the road also were hit
by the landslide, Tsujioka said.

   Japanese women, angered by a new sales tax and a
series of scandals ensnaring the government, are suddenly tapping
their dormant political might and presenting a serious challenge to
Japan's male-dominated system.
   Record numbers of women are running in elections July 23 for
Parliament's upper house. Many of them, responding to the seaminess
in Japanese politics, are portraying themselves as ordinary
homemakers immune to corruption.
   Their potential clout is enormous. Among eligible voters, women
outnumber men by 2.7 million, and they are more likely to actually
cast ballots.
   ``Women are the only mobilizable political group in Japan
today,'' said Kuniko Inoguchi, a political scientist at Sophia
University. ``It's very dynamic _ a silent revolution.''
   Ironically, the prosperity and social conservatism maintained by
the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan's governing party for 34 years,
is undermining its position. ``Well-educated women, deprived of
professions, have plenty of time to think about politics. Men are
too busy with work,'' said Ms. Inoguchi.
   Kinuko Ofuchi, 44-year-old mother of two, defeated a Liberal
Democrat in a recent by-election in northern Niigata prefecture by
campaigning in pink suits as an ``ordinary wife and mother.''
   In elections July 2 for the Tokyo city legislature, analysts
attributed Liberal Democratic setbacks to an unusually large female
voter turnout.
   The disenchantment that has thrust so many women into the
political process has been linked in part to a new 3 percent sales
tax that hits many homemakers at the supermarket.
   The governing party also has been weakened by Noboru Takeshita's
resignation as prime minister last month because of allegations the
Recruit Co., an information services conglomerate, sought to
influence politicians with campaign contributions and low-cost stock
deals.
   Further, Takeshita's successor, Sousuke Uno, has been forced to
fend off calls for his resignation because of reports he paid for
mistresses.
   Uno continues to deny rumors he will resign over what the
Japanese press calls his ``woman problem.''
   The opposition Socialist Party, headed by a woman, Takako Doi,
seeks to tap the female protest vote as a way of ending the
conservative majority in the upper house, and perhaps challenging it
in subsequent elections for the more powerful lower house.
   ``We are giving financial affirmative action to women
candidates,'' said Yumiko Torii of the Socialists' women's bureau.
   All parties except the Liberal Democrats have entered a record
number of female candidates. The 146 women running, more than a
fifth of the total, compare with 82 in the last upper house election
in 1986.
   Currently, only 10 percent of upper house members are women, and
the lower house has only seven women to 505 men.
   The six-year terms of 69 Liberal Democrats in the upper house
have expired. To keep its majority, the party must win back 54 of
those seats _ a feat that analysts and pollsters don't expect.
   Polls show that, like the Republican Party in the United States,
the Liberal Democrats suffer from a ``gender gap'' and get
significantly weaker support from women than men.
   The governing party is seen as representing big business and
traditionally male spheres of influence. The Socialist and Communist
parties often are associated with consumers' and women's concerns.
   Women found even more reason to attack the governing party a week
ago when Agriculture Minister Hisao Horinouchi, stumping for Liberal
Democratic candidates, asserted, ``Women are useless in the world of
politics.''
   Front-page stories quoted him as saying: ``In the end, women's
task is to stay home and take care of their families.'' It added
that Ms. Doi was unqualified to head the government because she was
single and has no children.
   Horinouchi later apologized and was admonished by Uno for harming
public trust in politics.
   But Ms. Doi told Kyodo News Service, ``He still doesn't seem to
realize that (Liberal Democrat) politics are so rotten women can't
keep quiet any more.''
   A few years ago, statements such as Horinouchi's or alleged
affairs such as Uno's might not have caused much fuss. In a 1969
interview, the wife of then-Prime Minister Eisaku Sato said he used
to beat her and regularly cavorted with a geisha. The Japanese
public didn't seem to blink an eye.
   Now, Uno is besieged with protests from anti-prostitution groups,
his own staff has urged the government to appoint more women to
policy advisory councils, and thousands of women are demanding that
Horinouchi resign.

   Republican National Committee Chairman
Lee Atwater arrived here a day early for a lecture to 1,200 Young
Republicans so he could get in a few licks on the guitar with an old
buddy.
   Atwater, 37, and high-school friend Johnny Few belted out
classics such as ``Hold On, I'm Coming,'' and ``Stand By Me'' Friday
night at the Cannery, a Nashville nightclub. They were backed up by
Few's Band, the Far Betweens.
   ``I haven't seen him in 20 years,'' Atwater said. ``We were in
high school in South Carolina together.''
   Atwater, who managed President George Bush's campaign, spoke at a
Saturday night banquet at the Young Republicans' national convention.
   Atwater has parlayed his own guitar-playing into an appeal for
youthful GOP supporters.
   He invited legendary blues musicians to play at a Bush inaugural
celebration, and has played in public often since Bush took office _
at Carnegie Hall, on NBC's Late Night with David Letterman, and on
Saturday Night Live.

   Slawek Walesa, the 17-year-old son of
Poland's Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, says his interests are
music, learning English and watching television.
   ``I leave all the politics to my father,'' he said Friday through
an interpreter as he toured with the Jan Lewan Polish-American
Orchestra in northern Minnesota.
   Nevertheless, the second child of Lech Walesa was made an
ambassador of Solidarity during the Lewan concert at Ironworld
during Polish Day. He sang a rousing patriotic Polish song that had
some in the 1,000-plus audience in tears.
   Lewan introduced the young Walesa, who strolled onto the stage
and, grinning crookedly, stood arm-in-arm with the conductor as the
orchestra played the Polish national anthem, as well as ``America
the Beautiful'' and ``God Bless America.''
   Slawek said that as a child he helped his father run off
political pamphlets on a mimeograph, but didn't know what they were
about. He said his father is patient, ``but not my mother.''
   Danuta Walesa, the Solidarity leader's wife, was in Philaelphia
earlier in the month to pick up an award won by her husband.

   Singer Melba Moore entertained more than
10,000 people at a conference stressing the need to reinforce black
family values.
   The Black Family Reunion Celebration, sponsored Saturday by the
National Council of Negro Women, was one of five to be held across
the country this summer.
   Moore gave a stirring rendition of the Negro anthem, ``Lift Every
Voice and Sing.''
   ``The environment here is charged and positive,'' she said.
   Dorothy I. Height, the president of the council, said the purpose
of the meeting and the four planned in other cities is to stress the
positive values of black life, including traditions developed in
Africa.
   ``We have heard the negatives and we are ready to speak for
ourselves. We are a people with history, values, and traditions _
that has helped us to be survivors,'' she said.
   Height said the black community has the strengths to deal with
drug abuse, teen-age pregnancy and crime. ``We must be more caring
of all children, not just our own,'' she said.
   Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner of NBC-TV's ``Cosby Show'' and his
mother, Pamela Warner, are honorary chairs of the reunion
celebrations. She said black families had to ``make an investment of
time, attention, and love'' to their children to give them the
motivation to become leaders.
   Height praised Warner as ``a single parent who has carried her
load alone and raised a strong young black male as a positive role
model.''
   The other events were to be held in Washington, D.C.; Atlanta;
Los Angeles; and Cincinnati.

   Pianist Van Cliburn was showered with
acclaim for his three concerts in the Soviet Union, but says the
highlight of his trip was receiving a degree from the Moscow
Conservatory.
   ``In the future, I will be inextricably tied'' to the
conservatory, said Cliburn, 55, who returned home to Fort Worth on
Saturday after the concerts July 2 and 3 in Moscow and July 9 in
Leningrad.
   The degree of master of fine arts was awarded in a private
ceremony in the conservatory's small concert hall.
   The pianist, who ended a 10-year absence from the stage when he
played with the Philadelphia Orchestra in June, said he plans to
keep a part-time residence in Moscow. It was there, in 1958, that
the 23-year-old Cliburn created a sensation by winning the
Tchaikovsky Competition for young pianists.
   The Ministry of Culture and Raisa Gorbachev, the wife of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, are searching for an apartment for him and
his mother, he said.
   Cliburn, whose style is heavily influenced by Russian piano
masters, said he had faith that the thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations
would last.
   ``I never invest where I don't have faith,'' he said.

   Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke was released from the
hospital Sunday, even though tests failed to reveal the cause of
chest pains, a spokesman said.
   The mayor went through a stress test Sunday morning, and ``he
came out fine,'' said spokesman Clint Coleman. While the exact cause
of Schmoke's problems are not known, doctors on Saturday ruled out a
heart attack.
   Schmoke, 39, was meeting with staff members Friday afternoon when
he became short of breath and said he felt dizzy, Coleman said. He
was taken by ambulance to Mercy Medical Center, about four blocks
from City Hall.
   The mayor had been intensely involved in efforts to reduce the
population of the City Jail, where officials said overcrowding
threatened to cause a serious disturbance a few days ago. The city
is under a federal court order to cut the number of inmates by Aug.
15.
   Aides and family members, including Schmoke's wife, Patricia, who
is an ophthalmologist, urged the mayor to rest during his
hospitalization and take a break from his usually busy schedule.
   Schmoke said he planned to return to work Monday, although he
will maintain a reduced schedule.

   Bush said neither he nor his summit partners interpreted
Gorbachev's weekend letter as a request to join next year's summit.
``It was saying, `Let's do something in a common way about solving
problems around the world.'''
   In his letter, Gorbachev said it is ``obvious that the rest of
the world can only gain by the opening to the world economy of a
market such as that of the Soviet Union.''
   Bush, attending his first summit as president, hailed the
sessions as a ``clear success.'' The summit focused not only on
economic growth, improved trading procedures and plans for an effort
to safeguard the environment as well as a denunciation of China's
repression of a democratic movement.
   Bush said he was ``touched by what I saw and heard'' in his two
stops in Eastern Europe, and said, ``People yearning for freedom and
democracy deserve our support, and it's because of the community of
values shared by these summit countries that we were able to agree
to meet soon to discuss concerted action that will help Poland and
Hungary.''
   Bush grappled several times with questions concerning Gorbachev's
letter, conceding at one point that some unnamed western leaders
briefly considered the possibility that it was mischief-making. He
said that was dismissed, however.
   ``People concluded that it was just one more manifestation of the
changing world we are living in,'' he said.
   ``They are moving towards our system,'' he said.

   Brothers David and James Taggart will get
to tell their side of the story this week in their trial on charges
of evading taxes on money diverted from the PTL ministry to finance
their lavish lifestyle.
   After more than a week of compelling prosecution testimony in the
brothers' federal trial on tax-evasion and conspiracy charges,
defense attorney Ben Cotten will begin his case sometime Monday.
   ``I think there will be some surprises, just as there have been
some surprises on the prosecution side,'' Cotten said during a break
Thursday.
   He said in his opening statement that the case was not about
taxes, but was ``a case about authorization, intent and doubt.'' He
said witnesses and documents would show his clients had
authorization to use PTL credit cards and take out cash advances
from the highest levels at PTL.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter gave the jury the day off
Friday. The prosecution was expected to rest its case after about
two hours of additional testimony Monday.
   It's been more than two years since the Taggarts were fired by
PTL following the resignation of Jim Bakker, the founder of the
television ministry which once took in more than $175 million in
annual donations.
   Bakker and Richard Dortch _ his former top deputy at the
now-bankrupt television ministry _ are scheduled to go on trial Aug.
28 in Charlotte on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy.
   The Taggart brothers joined PTL in the late 1970s as piano
players. Within a few years, David, 32, was Bakker's top personal
aide and James, 35, became PTL's interior decorator.
   Both were fired when the Rev. Jerry Falwell took over at the
television ministry after Bakker resigned in March 1987 following
revelations of the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.
   Following a 16-month grand jury investigation into PTL's
operation under Bakker's leadership, the Taggarts were charged last
December with conspiracy and evading $487,000 in taxes.
   They are accused of diverting more than $1.1 million in PTL money
to their own use from 1984 to 1987 by taking large cash advances and
using blank ministry checks to pay off personal bills, and not
reporting that money on their tax returns.
   PTL financial officers have testified that David Taggart
routinely took large cash advances and failed to provide receipts to
substantiate the advances, which was PTL policy.
   Peter Bailey, PTL's vice president of finance during most of the
time the Taggarts were at PTL, testified that he once wrote off
$215,000 in unsubstantiated cash advances to David Taggart.
   Bailey testified the younger Taggart used four blank PTL checks
to pay $140,000 in American Express bills.
   Witnesses also testified that James Taggart was paid $10,000 a
month for his design work at PTL's Christian retreat in nearby Fort
Mill, S.C.
   Dozens of shopkeepers and friends of the Taggarts testified that
the defendants went on spending sprees in the most exclusive stores
in New York City, Florida, California and Europe.
   They always stayed at the nicest hotels and dined in the most
expensive restaurants, prosecutors say. On one occasion, they
chartered a private jet to take them and a friend to dinner in
Laguna Beach, Calif.
   Prosecutors charge the Taggarts also used money donated to the
tax-exempt religious organization to buy a $640,000 condominium in
New York. They also owned a $330,000 home in Charlotte and regularly
purchased hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of jewelery and
designer clothes for themselves and friends, prosecutors say.
   If convicted, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 25 years in
prison and face fines totaling more than $1 million.

<HEAD>Landlord Thought FBI Agents Were Drug Dealers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lew Lutz was convinced they were drug
dealers, the two men who had rented his building for two years and
were operating a ``military surplus store'' that never did any
business.
   The windows of the store were covered with canvas, but the men
always paid their rent on time, and in cash. Sometimes with crisp
$100 bills.
   ``I watch `Miami Vice.' I know what's going on in the world,''
Lutz said.
   But on the day the authorities came to close down the shop, they
greeted the two with handshakes, not handcuffs.
   Lutz' tenants were federal agents, who had been operating a sting
operation from the store to nab traffickers in stolen military
equipment.
   The two-year operation near Hill Air Force Base, about 20 miles
north of Salt Lake City, ended with the July 10 arrest of two
military policemen, one of their wives, and sealed indictments
against 12 other people.
   The two enlisted men allegedly tried to sell three stolen F-16
fighter engines to agents posing as operators of a military surplus
store that promised ``Cash For Surplus.''
   Lutz, who also owns a bar next door to the shop, had rented it in
1987 to a man he knew as Jim Palmer. Bounced checks and late
payments had been the legacy of earlier tenants, but Palmer was
different, said Lutz, who knew the second man only as Tom.
   ``At first I thought they were Mormons because they'd come in and
order a meal but never any beer,'' said Lutz.
   Months passed and Lutz could see business next door was terrible.
When he'd send bar patrons interested in camping equipment to the
surplus store, they'd come back saying it was closed.
   ``I even offered one of them a part-time job because I could see
they weren't doing any business,'' Lutz said. ``He said, `No, I'm
looking for another kind of job.''
   ``These guys put this thing together real good,'' he said. ``If I
was looking for somewhere to sell something that was stolen, that
would be it.''
   Lutz decided his tenants were running a drug operation. But he
said he did nothing about his suspicion, believing it wouldn't do
any good. ``Drug dealers never get caught,'' Lutz said.
   In retrospect, Scott Lewis also thought the shop's tenants were
suspecious. From his nearby jewelry store he saw ``Jim Palmer'' come
and go in his four-wheel-drive vehicle, but rarely a customer.
   ``He was undercover very well. He looked the part. He was
bearded. He looked like he was from the Vietnam era,'' Lewis said.
   Operation Punchout, as it was dubbed by the FBI, turned up more
than 100 suspects at 15 military bases. Helmets, military clothing,
computers, radios, bullet-proof vests and night-vision devices were
among the items being stolen and sold to the wholesalers that were
the agency's prime target.
   ``It's strictly money. You have people who have access to very
sensitive and marketable equipment equipment. Basically it's a greed
issue,'' said Robert Bryant, special agent in charge of the FBI's
Salt Lake office.
   Bryant believes pilferage of military hardware could run into the
billions of dollars. Undercover operations may act as a deterrent,
he said.
   Bryant said five agents worked in the operation, including an
undisclosed number who were not FBI. He would not say what other
agency or agencies were involved.
   The store's legally obtained inventory was mere window-dressing,
but legitimate customers had to be dealt with, Bryant said. The
``salesemen'' tried to quote inflated prices, but that didn't always
work.
   ``If people came in and insisted on buying something, they (the
agents) won salesman of the month _ not an honor they wanted,''
Bryant said.

<HEAD>Import Quotas Now Have Little Impact, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. steel industry has returned to
``normal levels of profitability'' and ending import quotas in place
the past five years would have little overall impact, according to a
congressional research agency.
   ``The effect of the quotas has declined substantially and the
vast majority of them are now going unfilled,'' the General
Accounting Office said in a report released Sunday. ``While
expiration of the quotas might effect the market for a few
individual steel products ... it would likely have little impact on
the market as a whole.''
   Twenty separate quota agreements covering steel imports from 29
countries are due to expire Sept. 30. President Bush is expected to
announce a new steel policy soon after he returns from the Paris
economic summit.
   Senators from states with agricultural and other major exports
have been campaigning against the quotas while those from
steel-producing states have been urging a five-year extension. There
have been reports that the White House is weighing proposed two- and
four-year extensions.
   ``The main effect of extending the quotas would be to protect the
steel industry from possible future adverse exchange-rate changes or
wage increases,'' the GAO report said.
   It said the major cause of the industry's plight when the quotas
were adopted in 1985 was the recession earlier in the decade, a
situation made worse by a surge in imports and the soaring value of
the dollar.
   American producer shipments declined from 1974 to 1985 by 44
million tons. Of the decline, 54.5 percent stemmed from reduced U.S.
consumption, 18.2 percent from increased imports, 15.9 percent from
mini-mill competition and 11.4 percent from reduced exports.
   The quotas were designed to limit steel imports to a U.S. market
share of no more than 20.2 percent annually. According to the
American Iron and Steel Institute, import penetration was 26.4
percent at its height in 1984, falling to 25.2 percent in 1985, 23
percent in 1986, 20.9 percent in 1987 and 20.3 percent in 1988.
   Since 1985, the GAO said, ``the industry has regained
competitiveness principally as a result of the substantial decline
in the value of the dollar, improvements in labor productivity and
reductions and slower growth in wages and benefits.''
   Industry analysts acknowledge that the surge in imports has died
down and that American steelmakers are back in competitive form but
stress that a downturn in the world market could be near.
   In the event of a downturn, the analysts said, the United States
could again become a target for dumping _ a reason for keeping the
quotas in place.
   However, the GAO report said existing trade laws provide remedies
in cases where the steel industry needs protection from subsidized
or imports ``dumped'' in the United States at prices below those in
the home market.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who requested the GAO study, said it
``flatly rejects the steel industry's big lie that it is sick and
needs import protection to survive.''
   ``We now have a report that tells us that the steel industry's
problems stemmed from its own inefficiencies, an overvalued dollar
and an economy-wide recession,'' Wilson said.

<HEAD>A Decade Later, Still No Agreement on Results</HEAD>

   The jury remains out on Agent Orange even
though a decade has passed since Congress told government scientists
to determine whether a link exists between the herbicide and
ailments among Vietnam veterans.
   Hearings last week on Capitol Hill showed that while veterans
demand compensation for ills _ including cancer, birth defects, and
miscarriages _ they maintain are linked to exposure to the
dioxin-containing substance, scientists are disputing how to go
about a study.
   There were charges of political concerns eclipsing scientific
ones, and pleas for science to yield to human concerns. Critics of
the Centers for Disease Control, where most research is done, say
results and action are long overdue.
   ``It's just terribly frustrating,'' said Paul S. Egan,
legislative director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. He said
veterans were literally ``drenched'' with Agent Orange and nothing
has happened, yet ``we're alarmed if there seems to be dioxin in
coffee filters.''
   Action is possible in the next year or two, due in part to a
decision by Edward J. Derwinski, secretary of the new Veterans
Affairs Department.
   The former congressman was put on the spot when U.S. District
Judge Thelton E. Henderson in San Francisco ordered the VA
department to revise how it determines the possible health effects
of exposure to Agent Orange.
   Henderson said the VA had imposed an ``impermissibly demanding
test'' for connecting Agent Orange with health problems.
   Derwinski decided against an appeal, meaning there will be new
rules in October.
   The new rules would affect the claims by nearly 35,000 veterans
who say they have disorders caused by Agent Orange. Only five claims
have been allowed, and those were all for a skin ailment known as
chloracne.
   The Senate may pass legislation that would provide interim
temporary payment of VA benefits to Vietnam veterans suffering from
non-Hodgkins lymphoma and soft tissue carcinoma, both cancers linked
to Agent Orange.
   Already, because of legislation passed in 1981, lower-income
veterans ``who believe'' their health problems are caused by Agent
Orange may receive VA care, the VA says.
   The Senate had passed an interim payment measure last fall, but
it was opposed by the Reagan administration and died in the House.
The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee approved a new bill last week.
   The sponsors, Sens. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., and Thomas Daschle,
D-S.D., take Derwinksi's decision on the appeal as a good sign.
   On the House side, the outlook is questionable. Tim Sechrist, an
aide to Rep. Douglas Applegate, says Applegate wants to look at the
VA's new regulations. The Ohio Democrat is chairman of the Veterans'
Affairs subcommittee on compensation pension and insurance.
   VA Committee chairman G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery of Mississippi
told his hospitals and health care subcommittee Monday: ``I am
concerned that too many times the emotion surrounding this topic is
the result of apparent mismatches between hoped-for results and the
actual scientific results of studies of Agent Orange. ...
   ``In the other body, there is legislation pending that deals with
compensation for certain diseases on the basis of feared exposure to
Agent Orange. We should not act until exposure is known and the link
between exposure and disease is assessed. We know we cannot simply
rely on service in Vietnam as an indicator of exposure.''
   Those were the issues government scientists were supposed to
start addressing 10 years ago. Hearings Monday and Tuesday showed
what has happened.
   CDC scientist Dr. Vernon N. Houk said a study is impossible
because its results can't be validated. The result was cancellation
in 1986 of a massive epidemiological study undertaken in 1983, with
$19 million of its cost unspent.
   VA was given some $3 million of that last year to conduct blood
tests on Air Force veterans of Ranch Hand, the Agent Orange spraying
operation in which 1,200 people participated. The Air Force, in an
ongoing study criticized by outsiders, says so far the death rate
among Ranch Handers is no different from that of the general
population and there is no proof of a link to cancer.
   Houk said there was no way to prove where a soldier was when 12
million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed over Vietnam between
1965 and 1970 to destroy the dense foliage that provided cover to
the enemy.
   Witnesses, including former government scientists, challenged the
CDC in a hearing Tuesday of an oversight subcommittee of the
Government Operations Committee. They said CDC ignored detailed
records of spraying and troop movements available in Washington and
elsewhere, and tried to water down both the Agent Orange study and a
separate Vietnam Experience Study.
   Government scientists, in turn, criticized a study done by
Columbia University scientists Jeanne and Steven Stellman for the
American Legion.
   The study, matching a mail survey of 6,810 veterans with
government records on troop movements and herbicide spraying, found
a correlation between Agent Orange and various health complaints
reported by the veterans. There were no results on cancer.
   Congress' Office of Technology Assessment said the American
Legion self-reporting study suffered from inaccurate recollections
by veterans 20 years after service, imprecise depiction of
locations, and spray paths that are too wide to be useful.
   Governments officials say more will be known next spring when CDC
releases a study of the incidence of selected cancers in Vietnam
veterans. They also say scientists are better able to test blood for
dioxin and they have a better idea how long dioxin remains in the
body.
   Whatever those results, one scientist says an open mind is the
answer. ``As long as there are millions of veterans and family
members who have a legitimate health concern regarding this issue,
it is incumbent upon us to consider any and all possibilities, and
certainly to consider new technology and lateral approaches in this
area,'' said Dr. Michael E. Kafrissen, former visiting scientist at
CDC.

   A man fed money to ducks outside
Sweden's royal palace Sunday and then broke into the castle,
smashing antique Chinese urns and breaking down doors before he was
arrested, Swedish media reported.
   King Carl XVI Gustaf, Queen Silvia and their three children were
in southeastern Sweden on vacation at the time.
   ``What is most serious is that the man was able to move all over
the castle, even into the apartment of the royal family,'' police
spokesman Ulf Magnetorp told the national news agency TT.
   The intruder was not identified.
   Swedish radio and TT said the 36-year-old man was incoherent when
arrested at the 17th century Drottningholm Royal Palace, about 10
miles west of Stockholm.
   The reports said he had been released from a mental institution
six months ago. TT said police took him to the institution following
his arrest.
   Following standing orders, guards at the palace called police
instead of intervening when the intruder burst in a main entrance,
Magnetorp said. He said those orders should be changed.
   ``The guards would have acted differently had the royal family
been in the castle,'' Curt Johansson, acting head of the Royal
Guards, told TT.
   Earlier in the morning, the man was seen near the castle feeding
ducks. It was later discovered he had fed them bank notes.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The special bouquet of roses that Barbara Bush
received Sunday will help her remember Paris _ and help Paris
remember America's first lady.
   Bernadette Chirac, wife of the mayor of Paris, presented her
guest with a bouquet of the newly named Barbara Bush roses from the
famed Bagatelle rose garden in the Bois de Boulogne.
   ``It's almost like having a baby. I feel like a grandmother with
a new child,'' said the delighted Mrs. Bush as she sniffed her
eponymous bouquet of carmine and cream-colored roses.
   ``They'll still be here when I'm gone,'' Mrs. Bush reflected with
a smile. ``Thank you. I adore them. I love the color combination.''
   The rose has already won an award for its creators, the George
Delbard company, France's premiere rose-bush specialists, with 3.5
million bushes a year.
   Horticulturist Henri Delbard, who cross-bred the flowers, said,
``It takes ten years to create a new rose.''
   ``Obviously we didn't know Mrs. Bush would be the president's
wife ten years ago,'' Delbard confessed. ``But we found the colors
of this rose particularly fitting and fashionable for patriotic
reasons _ red and white.''
   The garden in the Bois de Boulogne is a favorite tourist stop,
and Mrs. Bush made her visit there on a sunny day while her husband
and other world leaders wound up their economic summit.
   In addition to the thick bouquet of cut roses, Mrs. Bush was also
promised bushes of the newly christened rose.
   The first lady, who has a world-famous Rose Garden back home at
the White House, said, ``We'll have to plant it.''
   The Barbara Bush rose will be in good company. Among the 6,500
bushes in the Bagatelle garden are roses named after Charles de
Gaulle, John F. Kennedy and Princess Grace of Monaco. This is a
first named for the wife of an American President.
   Mrs. Chirac also has a rose in the Bagatelle garden named after
her.
   The new Barbara Bush rose, according to Delbard's description,
``comes into bloom early in the season and continues unceasingly to
bloom. It is particularly resistant to disease.''
   Now known as a ``roseraie,'' the park with a small pavilion
chateau existed back in the l8th century, when it was ``a scene of
libertinage and loose living among the courtiers,'' according to a
guidebook.
   At one time it was home to the paintings of collector Richard
Wallace.
   The city of Paris bought Bagatelle in 1905 and cultivated it as a
public garden.

<HEAD>Civil Damage Case May Answer Questions About 1983 Incident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A trial begins Monday in which surviving family
members claim Korean Air Lines is liable for damages stemming from
the 1983 incident in which one of its planes strayed into Soviet
territory and was shot down, killing all 269 aboard.
   Families of the passengers killed in the shootdown of Flight 007
say the plane's crew engaged in willful misconduct that makes the
airline liable for damages in excess of the $75,000-per-passenger
limit normally permitted under international agreement.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization concluded Flight
007 had been off course for nearly 5{ hours before it was destroyed.
   The jumbo jet was flying from New York to Seoul, South Korea when
a Soviet military jet tracking the Boeing 747 attacked it over
Sakhalin Island, a site of Soviet military installations.
   There were 61 U.S. citizens among the passengers.
   The U.S. government said the plane was lost due to a navigational
mistake and that its pilot did not know he was over Soviet
territory. The Soviet Union contends the plane intentionally flew
its course to photograph sensitive military installations.
   The civil jury trial will take place before U.S. District Court
Judge Aubrey Robinson.
   Lawyers for the families will present expert witnesses, including
airline pilots who fly the North Pacific route take by Flight 007.
   The families suggest in court papers that:
   _Crew members aboard Flight 007 should have known shortly after
leaving Anchorage, Alaska, on the last leg of their journey, that
because of an error they made before take-off, they were operating
without a reliable Inertia Navigation System. The three computerized
devices aboard the aircraft were the primary means of navigating the
flight.
   _Instead of temporarily aborting the flight to reprogram the
system, the crew may have decided to navigate the flight without it,
in clear violation of proper piloting procedure.
   _Flight 007's crew members may have been motivated by a desire to
conceal their initial error that caused the system to be
misprogrammed or misaligned. If they had had to correct their error,
they would have had to dump much of their fuel over the North
Pacific, a procedure for which other KAL pilots had been disciplined.
   KAL says the only inference that can be drawn from the ``assumed
deviation'' from a normal flight path is that the crew was negligent
in failing to notice it had gone off course. The judge said in a
ruling last November that negligence may not be the only explanation.
   ``A failure to notice that the flight was off-course at Point A,
or point B, or Point C ... might be evidence only of negligence,''
said Robinson. ``But a failure to notice that the flight was
off-course at Point A and point B and Point C ... is susceptible to
a different interpretation.''
   That ``different interpretation'' is that ``the crew was aware of
its deviation but elected not to report it and take corrective
action,'' suggested the judge.
   Robinson found sufficient evidence for a conclusion that the crew
of Flight 007 knew the navigation system aboard the plane was
unreliable.
   KAL said there was no evidence to indicate whether the system was
functioning properly and no evidence the alleged misprogramming or
improper alignment of the system was deliberate.
   ``The first claim is clearly erroneous,'' said Robinson. ``The
second misses the mark ... the law does not require ... that the
crew must have intentionally misprogrammed or misaligned the INS
system.''

   With a letter outlining the Kremlin's hopes for
closer economic ties with the West, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev stole the limelight at the summit of the world's seven
wealthiest democracies.
   The Moscow missive captured the attention of the kingpins of
capitalism at the 15th World Economic Summit, prompting both
promises of Western support for perestroika and skepticism that the
Soviet economy will ever mesh with free markets.
   ``We talked about it a great deal,'' President Bush told a
post-summit news conference Sunday. ``People concluded it was just
one more manifestation of the changing world we're living in.''
   Bush seemed impressed that Gorbachev brought his concerns to the
summit in a letter appealing for eventual integration of Eastern and
Western economies.
   But summit leaders suggested it will be a long time before the
Soviet economy has enough in common with the West to pull up a chair
at the seven richest nation's annual conference on the financial
health of the world.
   ``We welcome the interest shown in the letter,'' Bush said. ``But
this was not an application for admission to the G-7.''
   Any talk of inviting Gorbachev to next year's summit in the
United States is ``a little premature,'' said Bush.
   Asked if the Kremlin leader's message might have been intended to
drum up publicity for perestroika or upstage the summit, the
president replied, ``I can't say that that never occurred to us.''
   But he emphasized that the summit partners decided the letter had
good intentions and engendered hope for a continued warming trend
between East and West.
   Gorbachev has long contended that the success of his reform
movement known as perestroika, or restructuring, depends in part on
the willingness of Western nations to cooperate with credits, joint
ventures and other projects that could earn the Soviets hard
currency.
   ``Our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending toward
full and entire participation in the world economy,'' Gorbachev
wrote French President Francois Mitterrand, the summit chairman.
   The Kremlin chief deemed it ``obvious that the rest of the world
can only gain by the opening to the world economy of a market such
as that of the Soviet Union.''
   Gorbachev's letter caused a stir among the democratic leaders,
but it broke no new ground in Soviet policy, and some doubts were
expressed over the chances for closer economic ties.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she wished the
Soviets every success in their reforms, ``But I don't see the time
she (the Soviet Union) will join us because of her (having become) a
great free-market economic success.''
   Gorbachev often addresses international gatherings to wish them
well in their undertakings and to offer his own views of how global
relations can be improved.
   He has said repeatedly that creating economic links between
socialist and capitalist countries would make the two political
blocs more interdependent, thereby enhancing predictability and
stability.
   Reflecting the West's riveting interest in every hint that the
Kremlin could be creeping toward capitalism, the seven summit
leaders made Gorbachev's letter the hot topic of conversation at
their gala dinner on Saturday. Most remarked on it in their
valedictory news conferences.
   ``This marks the first time that the leader of a country that
contests the economic systems of the seven shows himself as an
interlocutor, not as an opponent,'' Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco
De Mita told reporters Sunday.
   ``We wish success to the process of democratization in the Soviet
Union,'' Mitterrand commented. ``We salute the courage of this
enterprise and even though it's not up to us to implement it, we
will contribute to its success in any way we can.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was pleased that
Gorbachev recognized ``the responsibility of the Soviet Union in
resolving world economic problems.''
   Gorbachev wrote that he saw ``points of convergence'' on how to
resolve the Third World debt crisis, but he offered no specifics.
   The Soviet economy has been slow to recover from years of
stagnation imposed by over-centralization, corruption and a
sprawling bureaucracy.
   Since taking power in March 1985, Gorbachev has introduced an
array of reforms, but they have produced more social successes than
financial improvements.
   National income, productivity and industrial output remain
relatively low, and the average skilled worker earns only the
equivalent of about $300 per month.
   ``It was an invitation to dialogue, and in that regard I view it
positively,'' Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said.
   He described Gorbachev's letter as ``a constructive and
innovative gesture'' of a political nature, but noted that the
economic systems of East and West are so different that tightening
cooperation will prove difficult.
   ``It's going to be tough until he has a convertible ruble,'' said
one U.S. official, who insisted on anonymity.

   Lighting the Paris sky with an explosion of color,
France wrapped up a three-day, $50 million celebration of the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution and disproved critics'
predictions the fest would fall flat.
   President Bush, in Paris for bicentennial festivities and a
meeting of the leaders of the world's seven richest democracies,
told the congregation at the American Cathedral on Sunday that both
events reaffirmed ``the right of all men and women to be free.''
   The night before, bouquets of color from 170,000 rockets washed
the sky over the Eiffel Tower in a 45-minute display that culminated
in a 200-foot-wide tableau of the ship of Paris, the city's symbol,
in the blue, white and red colors of France.
   Police said 400,000 to 500,000 people viewed the fireworks
display, one day after a 1 million people mobbed the Champs-Elysees
to see a whimsical, avant-garde parade that was the centerpiece of
the festival.
   Critics had predicted the economic summit would detract from the
revolution's message of liberty, equality and fraternity, or even
insult more than two dozen leaders of developing nations in town for
the bicentennial.
   There also were fears the parade created by advertising star
Jean-Paul Goude and broadcast to hundreds of millions of TV viewers
worldwide would be an embarrassment.
   But the consensus was that it was a hit. Even the staunchly
conservative daily Le Figaro, usually hostile to any initiative of
the Socialist government, ran a banner headline reading ``The
Triumph of the Revolution'' _ but with a cartoon showing a housewife
grumbling over the cost.
   Premier Michel Rocard sent a message to the president of the
Bicentennial Mission, Jean-Noel Jeanneney, congratulating him for
the ``exceptional success.''
   Culture Minister Jack Lang said the French gave a ``frank and
giant `Yes''' to the bicentennial.
   ``We offered modernity at the risk of derision,'' Jeanneney
acknowledged. But ``the commemoration became national and
planetary.''
   Goude's parade, called ``The Marseillaise'' after the national
anthem, featured African drummers, dancing Soviet bears,
cheerleaders and an American marching band that moonwalked down the
avenue.
   American opera star Jessye Norman sang the French national anthem
midway through the evening.
   ``The gamble was without doubt a little crazy, but it was won,''
Le Monde wrote, calling the parade ``surprising and original.'' It
``did not give the idea _ to say the least _ of a chauvinistic and
xenophobic France.''
   Mitterrand, asked Sunday at a news conference what he thought of
the criticism, replied: ``What counts is the result.''

<HEAD>Permanent Memorial To Honor San Ysidro Massacre Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN YSIDRO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five years after an unemployed security
guard killed 21 people at a McDonald's restaurant, local residents
have agreed on a memorial to the victims of the massacre, one of the
nation's worst.
   The site at the heart of San Ysidro's business district has
changed from the day James Oliver Huberty turned it into a
slaughterhouse before a police sniper killed him.
   The fast-food restaurant has been replaced by a temporary
building for a junior college satellite campus, with a patch of bare
ground set aside for the memorial once the $50,000 needed to erect
it has been raised.
   A sign, nearly impossible to read from the street, marks the spot
where the restaurant once stood. It reads:
   ``This Site Reserved for a Memorial to Honor Victims of the
Tragedy of July 18, 1984.''
   It was the single-day worst massacre by a single gunman in the
nation's history.
   The 41-year-old Huberty _ armed with a shotgun, a semiautomatic
rifle and a semiautomatic pistol _ shot at anything that moved
inside or outside the crowded restaurant, which was a few blocks
from his apartment.
   He fired 245 rounds during a 77-minute rampage that ended the
lives of people as young as 8 months and as old as 74.
   In the intervening years, there has been a string of seemingly
senseless mass killings by gunmen in different parts of the country.
The latest, when gunman Patrick Purdy opened fire Jan. 5 in a
schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., killing five people and injuring
about 30 before ending his own life, spurred a rash of legislation
to limit private use of automatic weapons.
   McDonald's Corp. razed the San Ysidro site almost immediately and
donated it to the city of San Diego, which governs this
predominantly Hispanic border community. McDonald's opened another
restaurant about a half-mile north.
   When the City Council voted to sell the lot in June 1987, a
200-square-foot area was reserved for a victims' memorial.
   Eight months later, council members approved the sale for
$136,000 to the Southwestern Community College District, which last
year opened San Ysidro's first college building.
   Among the school's first projects was a contest among
architecture students for a massacre memorial. The winning entry was
designed by Roberto Valdes Jr., who now attends an architecture
school in Mexico City.
   The proposed memorial consists of 21 tall, marble-covered
hexagons that resemble obelisks. The hexagons lean toward one in the
center that points skyward.
   ``We hope the memorial will be in place by the end of the
calendar year,'' said district spokeswoman Susan Herney. ``The
design has been approved, the (plan specifications) have been
engineered and we're pursuing the funding.''
   Sale of the property followed months of emotional public debate,
and left some bitterness with several people who lost family members
and wanted the entire parcel turned into a memorial park.
   Others opposed any type of monument, arguing that it would
memorialize the killer. But the satellite campus' dean, Serafin
Zasueta, said such sentiments aren't heard much anymore.
   ``There was a great deal of dissension among the community about
a college coming here,'' he said. ``I've seen a great deal of change
in some people's attitude toward the college and their acceptance of
it.''
   Some 1,200 students are expected to enroll in more than 90
courses for the upcoming fall semester. With only seven classrooms,
Zasueta said, the existing building already is almost too small.
   A few students who attended last year were relatives of massacre
victims, but Zasueta said, ``we don't make a special tribute to
them.''
   The trauma that gripped the community after the slayings has
waned noticeably over five years, said Andrea Palacios Skorepa,
executive director of Casa Familiar, a social service agency that
counseled survivors and victims' families throughout the aftermath.
   ``Obviously, for each of the families, it's an ongoing healing
process. But as a community, we've kind of worked through that
healing process,'' she said.

toppling buildings, killing at least one person and injuring 10, a
report said Sunday.
   The quake occurred early Saturday and sent residents on the
island running from their homes in fear, the Kompas newspaper said.
   The temblor, which measured 6 on the Richter scale, damaged or
destroyed an undetermined number of homes, churches, schools and
public health centers, the newspaper quoted an island official, A.
Dally, as saying.
   He said one person was killed and 10 people were seriously
injured and that rescue workers were searching for more victims on
the island, which is 1,265 miles east of Jakarta and about 30 miles
off the north coast of Timor.
   Meteorological officials said the quake was stronger than one
that struck the island in 1987, killing 45 people, injuring more
than 100 and damaging or detroying more than 2,600 houses.
   A quake measuring 6 on the Richter scale can cause severe damage
in populated areas. The scale is a guage of the energy released by
an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer, elected as a reform
candidate who pledged to end the days of Gov. Huey Long's
Depression-style populism, is getting nowhere in his 18-month
attempt to overhaul Louisiana's tax system.
   By now, Roemer had hoped to be touting a ``New Louisiana'' with
jobs created by businesses attracted by lower taxes. Instead, he is
dealing with political acrimony from legislators as the 1991
election begins to loom closer.
   ``You've got politicians drawing lines in the dirt and this
state's going to hell,'' state Sen. Don Kelly said as the
Legislature ended a six-day special session last Monday.
   This year's regular legislative session and the special extension
were marked by battles over a temporary sales tax, budget cuts and a
state lottery. The lottery and most of the budget cuts failed but
the temporary sales tax went through.
   Roemer campaigned in 1987 on the theme of ``reforming''
Louisiana's tax system, including a lower homestead exemption, more
reliance on local governments to pay for some programs, and reduced
business taxes.
   Louisiana businesses pay 96 percent of the state's property taxes
and the state handles many programs that other states leave up to
local governments.
   The homestead exemption _ thought up by Long during the
Depression so people wouldn't lose their homes _ exempts the first
$75,000 of the value of a house in which the owners live. Above
that, houses are assessed at only 10 percent of their fair market
value; for a house valued at $76,000, the local tax rate would be
applied to $100 _ 10 percent of $1,000.
   In 1982, the average tax in Louisiana on homes valued at $100,000
with FHA mortgages was $150 in Louisiana, $1,260 nationwide.
   Not only are property taxes for homeowners low to start with,
property values are depressed now. And, on top of all of that,
assessors are elected.
   The downturn in the oil and gas industry left the state with an
$800 million accumulated deficit that was paid off through a bond
issue last year. Louisiana has ranked near the top of the nation's
unemployment list for months and had the highest rate in the nation
_ 9.4 percent _ in May.
   The Legislature rejected Roemer's first tax plan during a special
session in October. Another special session in March did produce a
plan, but voters rejected it, 55 percent to 45 percent.
   That plan's defeat left the state with a projected budget deficit
this year of $700 million.
   The Roemer administration responded with a balanced budget
proposal calling for closing many state schools and hospitals.
   What the legislature produced instead was a $341 million sales
tax, imposed for a year. The rest of the deficit was overcome mostly
through higher projected oil prices, a $101 million surplus from
last year and a requirement that state agencies cover cost increases
associated with inflation.
   The temporary sales tax actually is an exemption removed: food,
utilities and gasoline normally are exempt from the state's 4-cent
sales tax, but 3 cents of the exemption was removed.
   Roemer points to accomplishments during his 18-month-old
administration, including a teacher pay raise plan, a tough clean
air act, laws designed to reduce workers compensation costs and
anti-drug legislation. The state also has a balanced budget for the
second straight year.
   But next year, when the temporary sales taxes expire, the state
will fall more than $800 million short, according to a Legislative
Fiscal Office report.
   ``We're going to have to get together and try to figure out some
permanent solution and try to figure out a plan that can pass this
Legislature. Whether that can be put together, I don't know,'' said
Sen. B.B. ``Sixty'' Rayburn, a legislator since 1948.
   On the outskirts of the tax fight is a long debate on a state
lottery, which three-term former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who says he
will run again in 1991, advocated during his last campaign. Polls
have shown widespread support for a lottery.
   Although he has opposed the idea, Roemer allowed the lottery to
be debated during the special session. The House and Senate both
rejected the measure.
   Roemer believes a lottery would take the most money from people
who can't afford it, and says the notion that it's a cure-all for
the state's money troubles is an illusion.

<HEAD>Pentagon Push-Pulled on US Troops in South Korea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney faces pressure
this week from a delegation of top South Korean military leaders
determined to counter congressional moves to cut U.S. troops in that
key allied nation.
   At the same time, the secretary has to deal with demands from
some in Congress that the Pentagon sharply reduce its military
commitment in the economically prosperous Asian country.
   Cheney, who has repeatedly said the Pentagon has no plans at
present to reduce forces in South Korea, is not expected to make any
formal commitment during his meetings with South Korean Defense
Minister Lee Sang-Hoon.
   The minister has told South Korea's national assembly defense
committee he wants to get the United States to sign a joint
communique promising to maintain its troops at current levels, which
costs the United States $2.6 billion a year.
   But given the atmosphere of reduced superpower tensions and
ever-tightening budgets _ and increasing pressure from Capitol Hill
_ the Pentagon has begun to think about how to plan for a reduction
in the more than 43,000 U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula,
officials say.
   ``There's been some discussion in the building, of looking down
the road,'' said a senior defense official, who spoke on condition
he not be identified by name. ``It's still fairly nebulous, and
early in the game. ... It's conceptual and still a small cloud on
the horizon.''
   The official hastened to add that there is ``no thought'' about
withdrawing totally from the area, in which there were more than
500,000 U.S. troops during the height of the Korean War in the 1950s.
   Any reduction probably would be couched in ``a wide-angle look''
and restructuring of U.S. forces in the entire Pacific region that
could be years, if not decades, away, the official said.
   That would mark a significant change in the way past
administrations have been able to deal with the question.
   A proposal for troop reductions put forward by President Carter
was quickly scuttled after it met fierce opposition on Capitol Hill.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee called last month for steep cuts in South Korea-based
forces to 10,000 troops.
   Sens. Bennett Johnston, D-La., and three other Democrats _ Dale
Bumpers of Arkansas, Jim Sasser of Tennessee and Patrick Leahy of
Vermont _ wrote to Cheney last month that his upcoming meeting with
his South Korean counterpart would be an ideal opportunity to
``begin discussions on reducing our military presence in Korea.''
   Bumpers told a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Defense
Subcommittee that reductions were justified because South Korea's
gross national product is seven times that of its rival North Korea,
its population is twice that of North Korea and it only spends 5
percent of its GNP on defense.
   ``I have become increasingly convinced that debate ought to begin
about our presence in Korea,'' he said.
   Cheney, in his appearance before the committee, did not rule out
consideration of the problem, noting President Bush's proposed
withdrawal of U.S. troops in Europe and saying a similar assessment
of U.S. forces in Asia could occur.
   And Secretary of State James A. Baker III _ asked about possible
cuts in South Korea during an appearance Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This
Week With David Brinkley'' _ also noted that Bush has proposed
reductions in Europe and said, ``To the extent that we can see some
correlative moves with respect to the status of forces in the
Pacific, maybe those kind of things can be considered in the future,
but right now the United States policy remains what it has been.''

<TEXT>
   With barely concealed relief, the leaders of the
world's seven richest democracies ended their economic summit early,
skipping a gastronomic gala Sunday night at the discreet suggestion
of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The leaders issued their final 22-page communique at lunchtime
Sunday and scrapped a 90-minute plenary session scheduled for the
afternoon, as well as their farewell dinner at the Palais d'Elysee.
   The official explanation was that the leaders completed their
work faster than expected because they got on so well together.
   Despite the harmony, no one seemed to want to linger on.
   They'd set forth their views on the world economy, drugs and the
environment and, apparently, that was all they had to say.
   ``We were kind of running out of gas,'' said President Bush, who
came to Paris on the heels of a four-day swing through Poland and
Hungary.
   ``I tell you it's been a vigorous experience in physical fitness
for me. ... I wasn't about to argue we needed more time and nor was
anyone else,'' Bush told a post-summit news conference.
   Privately, aides said there were smiles all round after host
French President Francois Mitterrand mentioned to Kohl during an
informal gathering Saturday that he would not be offended if his
guests took a rain check on the dinner.
   Kohl sounded out the rest.
   According to official sources, Britain's Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher looked incredulous for a moment and then sent fast word to
ready her official aircraft for Sunday afternoon; Bush clasped his
hands and smiled broadly.
   While the others hastened to get out of town, Bush got a free
afternoon and evening in Paris before heading to the Netherlands on
Monday.
   ``Things are going faster than foreseen ... There have been no
obstacles. I repeat, there is no other explanation,'' French
government spokesman Hubert Vedrine said late Saturday in announcing
the first word of the early ending.
   It had been a long weekend.
   A string of parades, ceremonies, lunches and dinners started
Thursday as Mitterrand dovetailed the summit with the spectacular
celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French revolution.
   By the time they finished Saturday night's dinner at the Louvre
Museum, the leaders of the United States, Japan, France, Britain,
West Germany, Canada and Italy had eaten six extravagant meals
together in elegant venues.
   The French organizers said no food would go to waste from the
cancellation of Sunday night's repast.
   ``We made all the arrangements three months ago. But we didn't
have to throw anything away because we realized Saturday that they
wouldn't have the Sunday dinner,'' said Muriel de Pierrebourg, a
spokeswoman for the organizers.
   British officials were particularly anxious to quash rumors that
Mrs. Thatcher precipitated the early exit.
   She'd made a controversial entry declaring that the French
revolution was the beginning of a bloody reign of terror rather than
the foundation of human rights, as Mitterrand sees it.
   With British newspapers suggesting Mrs. Thatcher had offended the
French _ London's Sunday Times called her ``the John McEnroe of
diplomacy'' _ and been snubbed in return, she didn't want to look
like the spoiler at the end of the party.
   Thatcher aides said she'd planned on staying through the dinner
and flying out at midnight on Sunday.
   The seven leaders' 1987 summit in Venice was curtailed in advance
_ and with less harmony. The final dinner was canceled because Mrs.
Thatcher said she had to leave early for an election campaign and
Mitterrand wanted to catch the finals of France's national soccer
cup.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress tackles a full slate of business this
week, from foreign policy to the HUD scandal, while also laboring to
complete major money bills before taking its annual August recess.
   A House Government Operations subcommittee continues its
investigation of the scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, with former HUD Secretary Carla Hills, now the U.S.
trade representative, scheduled to testify.
   Hills was named in sworn testimony last week as among those who
intervened to ease department restrictions on DRG Funding Corp., a
private lender whose participation in HUD programs had been
restricted over its violation of department rules.
   The restrictions on DRG, which is now under federal criminal
investigation, were lifted in 1985 after Hills intervened directly
with HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   The House is scheduled on Wednesday to take up the annual
appropriations bill that puts money into HUD programs, as well as
the Department of Veterans Affairs, for the 1990 fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   In addition to a likely discussion of the HUD scandal, amendments
are expected on evicting drug dealers and their families from
federally subsidized public housing projects.
   Thirteen appropriations bills have to be passed each year to
provide money for the full range of government operations. So far,
two of them _ for energy and water, and for Interior Department
programs _ have been approved by the House and await Senate action.
   Agriculture and foreign aid appropriations also are likely to
come up in the House this week in addition to the HUD-Veterans
measure..
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has said he hopes to
complete ``all or nearly all'' of the money bills before lawmakers
leave Washington Aug. 5 for a month-long recess.
   The Senate is likely to devote most of the week to completing a
State Department authorization bill. The routine measure is often
used by lawmakers as a vehicle to express their feelings about world
events.
   At least two hot issues are likely to arise:
   _ Whether the United States should continue its talks in Tunis
with officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization who have
past links to terrorism.
   _ Whether to impose strong prohibitions on enlisting other
countries to advance foreign policy aims that the U.S. government is
barred from doing itself, as the Reagan administration did during
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The Senate also is expected to take up rural development
legislation that would create loans for rural businesses and provide
up to $315 million over five years for upgrading rural water and
sewer systems. Other aid would be provided to rural schools and
hospitals.
   A House subcommittee, meanwhile, will continue hearings on the
Supreme Court's ruling protecting the burning of the American flag
as a form of political speech. And another panel will receive the
Bush administration's latest economic forecast from Budget Director
Richard Darman.
   In other action:
   _ The House ethics committee will meet, probably on Thursday, to
take up the case of Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the No. 2 ranking
House GOP leadership official. Gingrich has been accused in a
complaint by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., of violating house rules
that prohibit receiving gifts from indidviduals with a direct
interest in legislation.
   The complaint stems from investments in a partnership formed to
promote a book Gingrich co-authored, ``Window of Opportunity.'' The
complaint strongly parallels the ethics complaint Gingrich brought
against former House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Gingrich has
dismissed it as politically motivated retaliation.
   _ House and Senate negotitators continue meeting in an effort to
resolve differences in separate savings and loan industry bailout
bills. After breaking a procedural deadlock last week, the conferees
tentatively agreed to adopt the most stringent features of each bill
intended to prevent a recurrence of the S&amp;L crisis. But they
remained divided on a new regulatory structure for the industry and
are in a virtual stalemate on how to finance the rescue package.

<HEAD>Locals Grow Tired of Paula Sims Case, But Want Truth to Come Out</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Townsfolk are tiring of the publicity
surrounding their community, where Paula Sims claimed a masked
gunman had abducted her firstborn infant daughter in 1986.
   But they hope a charge in a neighboring county that she murdered
her second daughter _ who she claimed was abducted this spring under
similar circumstances _ finally will answer some questions.
   Mini Gray refused to open her front door to talk to a reporter
about the case.
   ``I'm too close to it,'' explained a tearful Mrs. Gray. It was to
her that Mrs. Sims ran on June 17, 1986, to report that a masked
gunman had abducted her 13-day-old daughter, Loralei Marie, while
her husband was at work.
   ``I hope they find out the truth,'' Mrs. Gray said through a
window. ``And if they're guilty, I hope they're severely punished.''
   Skeletal remains thought to be Loralei's were found only 150
yards from the Sims home a few days after the baby disappeared in
1986. Sims and her husband, Robert, moved to Alton in neighboring
Madison County not long afterward.
   Then, 3{ months ago, Mrs. Sims repeated the masked gunman story
to police investigating the disappearance of 6-week-old Heather Lee.
The baby's body was found May 3 in a trash can across the river in
West Alton, Mo. An autopsy found she had been frozen after being
suffocated.
   Witnesses have said Mrs. Sims wanted sons and was unhappy with
daughters. The Simses' 1-year-old son, Randy, was taken into state
custody in May.
   Mrs. Sims, 30, has been charged with obstructing justice in both
deaths, accused of concealing the homicides and lying to
investigators.
   But murder charges have been brought, at least so far, only in
Heather's death. A grand jury in Madison County indicted Mrs. Sims
last week on two counts of murder, charges that could mean the death
penalty if Mrs. Sims is convicted. She was jailed without bail.
   Robert Sims, 37, faces no charges. But the Madison County grand
jury left open the possibility of bringing charges against him.
   Mrs. Sims has pleaded innocent to all charges. Her attorney,
Donald Groshong, refuses to comment. At a hearing Friday in the case
of Heather's death, he filed motions asking that the trial be moved
from Madison County because of news coverage. He's also seeking to
have police and prosecutors barred from publicly discussing the case.
   Two months ago, townspeople in Brighton talked freely of the Sims
case. Reticent now, some wish the story and reporters would go away,
but not before they learn what happened.
   Even Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom, who swore he would never
close the file on Loralei, is quiet these days.
   ``I could say a lot of things, but I need to hold my emotions
together. I don't want to hurt the case any,'' he says.
   ``This thing about Paula Sims, it's created so much publicity
after a while you get tired of it,'' says former Sims neighbor Gene
Trail of Alton, who reluctantly joined his wife, Bonnie, in talking
to a reporter.
   The Trails are relieved someone finally has been charged with
murder.
   And while they are not sure of Mrs. Sims' guilt _ they wonder if
she is covering up for her husband _ others have no doubt.
   ``No trial _ just hang her,'' says Robert Groves, who lives down
the road from the former Sims home in Brighton. ``If they give her
the death penalty, I'll be satisfied.''
   Some Brighton residents, like Emil Watts, worry that the
publicity surrounding the case gives the town a bad name.
   ``I'd just like to see it come to a conclusion,'' he said. ``I
think it's in the best interest of everybody.''

   Obscured perhaps by an unexpected overture from
Moscow and the fireworks from France's $50 million birthday party
were two promising achievements that emerged from the weekend's
smooth and abbreviated Western economic summit.
   The democracies, freed for the moment from pressing economic
concerns of their own, pledged to address the environmental problems
that threaten the planet and focused on aiding the faltering
economies of the communist bloc and the Third World.
   The seven leaders endorsed a significant strategic switch in the
way rich countries should wrestle to resolve the Third World's
staggering $1.3 trillion debt.
   They pledged economic and food assistance to Eastern Europe, and
gave a distant embrace to the unsolicited call by Mikhail Gorbachev
for a greater Soviet role in the global economies.
   The environmental discussions prompted President Bush to describe
the meetings as a ``watershed'' event.
   For the first time, the administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, William Reilly, participated _ symoblizing Bush's
interest in a worldwide campaign to protect the ozone layer, save
forests and combat global warming.
   Bush said the summit generalities would be backed up by specific
recommendations when he hosts next year's summit in the United
States.
   Still, the cautious approach taken here raised some questions
whether the good intentions might go for naught.
   Skeptical environmental activists may have in mind the conflict
of rhetoric and action among summit partners on the subject of
terrorism over the years.
   In London in 1984, the summiteers first went on record against
terrorism. It was a strongly worded declaration but a general one.
   Three years ago in Tokyo, the campaign led by the United States
picked up steam and got specific.
   The leaders were nudged into shaking off their resistance to
naming names and branded Libya a supporter of terrorism. They
proposed such ``maximum efforts'' as an arms embargo against such
nations as well as improved extradition procedures.
   And yet, France recently delivered to Libya spare parts for
Mirage jet fighters paid for long ago. And West German firms
assisted Libya in developing a plant near Tripoli to produce
chemical weapons.
   Such contradictions notwithstanding, one Western official,
attending his sixth summit, rejected a suggestion that summits
produce only words. This veteran diplomat insisted: ``Diplomacy is
language, and you keep jacking up the language gradually and
progressively.''
   As it turned out, except for what Secretary of State James A.
Baker III termed ``a little debate'' over an international
conference on Poland and Hungary to be held later this summer, there
was no evidence of discord.
   That sped the summit to an early conclusion.
   Baker, who has been to nine such sessions, called this year's
``the most harmonious and one of the most productive summits that I
have attended.''
   Bush, at his post-summit news conference Sunday, said ``it went
smoothly.'' He was not sorry to have the summit end early,
acknowledging that after a four-day visit to Hungary and Poland
before participating in French bicentennial festivities and the
summit meetings, he was ``running out of gas.''
   Are these annual summits worthwhile?
   Most of those who participate are inclined to believe their time
was well-spent.
   Taizo Watanabe, the Japanese spokesman, stressed the unstructured
nature of summit meetings as helpful in coordinating policy among
the seven nations.
   ``This is something we could not find anywhere else,'' he said.
   Helmut Haussmann, the West German economics minister, was more
philosophical. ``Those who attend summits think they are very
important as long as they are active participants,'' he said. ``When
they no longer participate they no longer think they are important.''

<HEAD>Former Connecticut Gov. John Dempsey Dies at 74</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KILLINGLY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. John N. Dempsey, an Irish
immigrant who became one of the state's most beloved politicians and
championed the mentally retarded, died at home Sunday. He was 74.
   Dempsey's son, Ed Dempsey, said his father was surrounded by
family members when he died about 4 a.m. Sunday.
   Dempsey had entered a hospital which bears his name in
Farmington, outside Hartford, on June 16. At the request of his
family, the hospital never released the nature of his illness, but
it was widely reported that he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He
returned Friday to his home in northeastern Connecticut.
   Dempsey served as governor from 1961 to 1971, only the second
person in Connecticut history to serve a full decade in office.
Throughout his political career which began in the 1940s, Dempsey
said, he lived by a simple credo: ``You've got to help people. I
love people.''
   ``With the passing of John Dempsey, Connecticut has lost one of
its great public figures and I have lost a great friend,'' Gov.
William A. O'Neill said in a statement. ``My association with John
began more than 25 years ago, but my admiration for him began much
earlier.
   Dempsey was dubbed ``Man-O-War'' by the late state and national
Democratic Chairman John M. Bailey because of his ease at winning
elections.
   Dempsey emerged a winner in his first foray into local politics
when he convinced the Putnam town fathers that his street needed a
street light in the 1940s. That little victory prompted townsfolk to
persuade the young Democrat to run for the city council when he was
21. He later served as mayor for 12 years, and also served three
terms in the state House of Representatives.
   In 1954, he ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket headed by
Abraham A. Ribicoff. Ribicoff won but Dempsey lost in separate
balloting, but Ribicoff made Dempsey his executive aide.
   In 1958, he and Ribicoff ran together and this time, both of them
won.
   Dempsey remained mayor of Putnam while serving as lieutenant
governor, but left that post when he took over as governor when
Ribicoff headed to Washington in 1961 to join the new Kennedy
administration.
   He was twice elected to a full four-terms, in 1962 and 1966.
   ``I had hoped to give all the people in Connecticut the
opportunity that Connecticut gave me,'' Dempsey once said. ``I came
here in short pants as an immigrant at the age of 10 and I saw what
this country did for me.''
   Born in Cahir, County Tipperary, Ireland on Jan. 3, 1915, Dempsey
arrived in the United States in 1925 and settled with his parents in
Putnam.
   He insisted that his decision not to seek a third term as
governor in 1970 had nothing to do with the state's budget crisis at
the time, a $400 million deficit. Rather, he said, he thought it was
time to open things up to younger Democrats and ``I (was) going to
set the example.''
   Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, Mary; two other
sons; a daughter; and nine grandchildren.

<HEAD>Summit Ends With Call for `Decisive Action' Against Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's seven richest industrial nations called
for ``decisive action'' to fight global pollution on Sunday as they
completed a harmonious economic summit that will be remembered more
for bicentennial fireworks than concrete achievements.
   There was so little disagreement that the leaders had time to
discuss an unexpected letter from Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev
and still wrap up ahead of time.
   President Bush labeled his first economic summit a ``clear
success.''
   The closing communique addressed a number of Bush initiatives,
including aid to the communist East bloc, endorsement of the
administration's Third World debt plan and a call for greater
efforts to clean up the environment.
   It also called for concerted efforts to fight narcotics, a
problem it said had ``reached devastating proportions.''
   The leaders of the other summit countries _ Britain, France, West
Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada _ also praised the outcome of the
three days of meetings, which took place amidst the pageantry of the
200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dismissed reports that she was
slighted by the host, French President Francois Mitterrand, because
of remarks she made disputing the importance of the French
Revolution.
   Contending that she got along well with Mitterrand, Mrs. Thatcher
said, ``I have not had anything that could even remotely be termed a
slight.''
   Mitterrand, who lost in a bid to get agreement for a North-South
summit between rich and poor nations, said in a final statement that
the leaders of the summit countries were ``women and men of good
will. We want to put ourselves at the service of all of humanity.''
   The summit gave all the leaders, not just Bush, a chance to take
some victories back to the voters.
   Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, under fire for alleged
flings with geisha girls and badly in need of a political uplift,
termed the meetings ``splendid'' and said they had given him the
opportunity to explain a $35 billion new aid program for developing
countries.
   During the traditional reading of the final communique, Bush gave
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl a thumbs up signal as the section
on the environment was read; Mrs. Thatcher and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney nodded approvingly.
   A third of the 22-page final document addressed environmental
problems, the first time in the 15-year history of the summits that
a non-economic issue figured so prominently in the joint statement.
   ``Decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect
the earth's ecological balance,'' the leaders declared. ``We will
work together to achieve the common goals of preserving a healthy
and balanced global economy.''
   The communique called for concerted action to deal with the
depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, loss of forests and
ocean pollution, but it offered few specific proposals on how to
accomplish these goals.
   Environmental groups said they were pleased with the high profile
the summit gave these issues but disappointed that nothing more
concrete was offered.
   ``The heads of state have failed to propose the decisive actions
necessary to confront the deteriorating trends,'' said Rafe
Pomerance, senior associate at the World Resources Institute, a
Washington policy group.
   But Bush took issue with that view, calling the environmental
language in the summit document a ``watershed'' event.
   In the document, the summit leaders urged an acceleration of
research into anti-pollution technologies and said the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of the major
industrial countries, should be asked to pursue the development of
objective measurements of environmental pollution.
   Bush, at an outdoors news conference at the U.S. ambassador's
residence, said the summit leaders were intrigued by Gorbachev's
letter addressed to the summit gathering requesting closer links
between the Western countries' economies and that of his country.
   ``We would welcome any movement by the Soviet Union towards
market-oriented, Western economies. There is no question about
that,'' Bush said. He said Gorbachev would receive a ``very
courteous and thoughtful'' reply from Mitterrand,.
   The communique also called for creation of a task force to study
ways to halt money laundering by drug kingpins.
   On economic issues, the summit nations endorsed the
administration's strategy to reduce the $1.3 trillion debt burden
being carried by Third World nations by offering incentives for
commercial banks to forgive a portion of the debt. The new approach
was unveiled by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on March 10.
   While the so-called Brady plan was not mentioned by name, the
communique left no doubt that it was endorsing the concept. The
president quipped that if it works, ``we may call it the Bush plan.''
   The United States, along with Italy and Canada, came in for some
mild criticism for their large budget deficits. The summit document
exhorted them to do more to balance their books.
   Japan and West Germany, on the other hand, were urged to do more
to boost domestic economic growth as a way of providing a market for
foreign goods and thus slimming their huge trade surpluses.
   The document also had a veiled criticism of U.S. trade policies,
attacking moves to what it called ``unilateralism,'' efforts by one
country to go outside recognized international forums for resolving
trade disputes.
   While the United States was not mentioned by name, the language
was an obvious reference to the administration's targeting of Japan,
Brazil and India for alleged unfair trade practices and threatening
sanctions against those nations unless they removed trade barriers
to U.S. goods.
   Despite the small hints of disagreement, the leaders were able to
agree on the final language of the communique in quick order. The
leaders, who began their formal meetings Friday, dispensed with
Sunday's final plenary session, the first time any of these annual
gatherings has ended early.
   Bush welcomed the break. After touring Poland and Hungary and
taking in the festivities of the bicentennial of the French
revolution as well as the summit, Bush allowed that he was ``kind of
running out of gas.''
   The United States will host next year's summit, and Bush, who
hails from the Lone Star state, said it was a ``distinct
possibility'' that San Antonio or some other city in Texas would be
the site for the gathering.

   A fight between two men who bumped into
each other at a dance at the University of California at Berkeley
erupted into a melee involving about 300 people early Sunday, police
said.
   Fourteen people were arrested after the crowd left the campus and
windows in a dozen businesses were smashed, a city police spokesman
said.
   The initial fight occurred during a dance at a campus pub that
serves beer and wine in a student union building.
   University police ejected the individual believed responsible but
an hour later were called to protect the victim, who was accosted by
several people at the dance, said university police spokeswoman
Linda Allen-Torres.
   The officers tried to put the victim into a police car to take
him to a hospital for treatment of a broken hand, but they were all
attacked by a larger crowd.
   By then, a number of fights had broken out among 300 people who
had filled Sproul Plaza.
   Police called for more officers, and the crowd moved from the
plaza onto nearby Bancroft Avenue, where at least 13 businesses were
damaged. Most had broken windows and there was some minor looting,
said the city police spokesman, who declined to give his name.
   University police said they were not aware of any injuries to
police or civilians other than the original victim's broken hand.
   The 10 adults and four juveniles arrested were released after
being booked for investigation of inciting a riot, a misdemeanor.

<TEXT>
   Fans of the rock group Pink Floyd, including
Woody Allen and Tom Cruise, more than doubled the population of this
canal city to see the band perform on a floating stage near St.
Mark's Square.
   But the square lay awash in trash Sunday after the concert the
day before, and residents were complaining about violence, drug use
and littering during the show that drew an estimated 200,000 people
to this city of 83,000.
   ``Venice has been desecrated. Excrement on the streets, filth
everywhere, violence, and drugs. Venetians can take no more of
this,'' said Augusto Salvadori, president of the Committee for the
Defense of Venice.
   But fans complained about the lack of services, saying the city
provided no special facilities such as toilets or special emergency
vehicles at the concert. A 24-hour transport strike exacerbated
problems, causing chaos for inhabitants and tourists alike. Many
concert-goers slept in the streets.
   Police said 80 people suffered minor injuries in a scuffle in the
square shortly before the concert began, when a group of fans broke
through a barrier. Scattered cases of vandalism also were reported.
   The 90-minute show, performed on a floating stage in the Venice
lagoon, included laser lights and old and new hits.
   It was broadcast live in Italy and 23 other countries, reaching a
total audience of 100 million people, according to the state-run RAI
network. It was not broadcast in the United States.
   The concert set an attendance record as Italy's largest rock
event and attracted more visitors to the historic city than did the
annual Carnival festival.
   City preservation officials had threatened to deny permission for
the concert. But on Thursday they dropped their objections when
concert organizers agreed to measures to reduce potential damage to
the surrounding buildings.
   The stage was pulled farther from the shore than previously
planned and the rock group reduced its volume to a maximum of 60
decibels instead of 105 as planned.
   Italy's vice premier, Gianni De Michelis, spoke out in favor of
the concert.
   ``Venice must give space to all cultural languages, including
that of rock music,'' he said.

   A hand grenade exploded early Sunday on
the crowded dance floor of a nightclub, killing one man and wounding
37 people, police said.
   The explosion came during weekend celebrations marking the 10th
anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution.
   Lt. Alberto Castillo said the explosion occurred at a bar and
restaurant in the working class neighborhood of Ciudad Sandino.
Castillo identified the victim as Juan Antonio Murillo Ortega, 48.
   Amanda Vanegas, a nurse in charge of admissions at the Lenin
Fonseca Hospital, said 11 of the more seriously hurt were being
treated there and 26 others were admitted to the Manolo Morales
Hospital.
   ``It was horrible. There were wounded all over the place. Some
people fainted after one look,'' said the janitor of the nightclub,
who refused to give his name.
   Since Friday night, Nicaraguans have celebrated the anniversary
of the 1979 revolution. A decade ago on July 19, forces of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front overthrew rightist Gen.
Anastasio Somoza, whose family had ruled Nicaragua for 42 years.
   Castillo, who is in charge of the investigation, said he did not
think the attack involved the U.S.-supported Contras, who have
fought the Sandinista government for the past seven years.
   Many Nicaraguan youths serving in the military or recently
discharged take weapons and hand grenades with them home, or carry
them to parties.
   Castillo said he is trying to find out if there was some kind of
argument between people on the dance floor. Government radio urged
people to report ``any person they know is keeping war material at
home.''
   In August 1987, a conscript hurled a hand grenade onto a dance
floor in Ocotal, a city 140 miles north of Managua. One person died
and three people were wounded.

<HEAD>Summit Calls for Intensified War on Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the world's seven largest democracies,
declaring that ``the drug problem has reached devastating
proportions,'' called on Sunday for an intensified war on narcotics,
including creation of a financial task force to fight money
laundering.
   The final communique of the seven summit nations reflected the
widening sense of alarm among the Western nations about the menace
that drugs pose to their societies.
   The summit nations _ the United States, France, West Germany,
Britain, Canada, Italy and Japan _ urged all countries, ``especially
those where drug production, trading and consumption are large, to
join our efforts to counter drug production, to reduce demand, and
to carry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the
laundering of its proceeds.''
   ``There is a new sense of urgency in our determination to tackle
this evil,'' British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told
reporters. ``It can only be solved by cooperation.''
   She noted that the summit endorsed Britain's plan to hold an
international summit next year on dampening the demand for drugs,
mainly through education.
   The new task force will examine the effectiveness of existing
international efforts aimed at preventing traffickers from using
banks and other financial institutions to launder the money from
their drug sales.
   The task force will also ``consider additional preventive efforts
in this field,'' including new laws and regulations to block money
laundering.
   A summit source said the leaders decided that it probably easier
to trace drug money than the drugs themselves.
   The first meeting of the new task force will be at an unspecified
date in France, and its report is due by the end of next April.
   The summit nations indicated they plan to increase support for
efforts of countries who request help to fight the illicit
production and trafficking inside their borders.
   The communique emphasized a bigger role for the United Nations in
the drug war ``through an increase in its resources and through
reinforced effectiveness of its operation.''
   The communique did not specify what shape the new financial task
force would take, but British sources said earlier that it probably
would operate under the aegis of the International Monetary Fund,
the Bank of International Settlements and the 24-nation Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.

<TEXT>
   FRANKLIN TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Ann Flannery Hudak doesn't believe in
wasting anything _ not even excess skin. So far she has shed 150
pounds and when she loses 110 more pounds, she plans to donate her
excess skin to burn victims.
   Mrs. Hudak, 41, began a high-protein diet in April when she
weighed 386 pounds. Sh has slimmed her 5-foot-3 frame from a size 52
to a 40.
   ``I'm so glad I've finally taken control of my life,'' Mrs. Hudak
said in a recent interview. ``I was fat the first half of my life.
I'm going to be thin the second half.''
   She remains a long way from her goal of 125 pounds, but intends
at that point to undergo skin reduction surgery to remove excess
skin from her stomach, chin, legs and arms.
   She plans to donate the skin to St. Agnes Burn Center in
Philadelphia.
   ``I think it's very laudable that people want to donate these
things,'' said Dr. Fredrick DeClement, director of the burn center.
``Every little bit helps.''
   She initially couldn't find a skin bank willing to take her skin
but persevered when she heard of a similar donation by a Chicago
man, who had excess skin removed after he dieted and lost 170 pounds.
   ``I'd like to see burn victims able to have healthy skin from
people,'' Mrs. Hudak said.
   Mrs. Hudak hopes to donate at least 4 square feet of skin.
   Doctors use donated skin as a temporary treatment while burn
patients regenerate their own skin. The borrowed skin then sloughs
off.
   ``It's a temporary ... dressing,'' DeClement said. ``The ultimate
cover has to be the patient's own skin.''
   DeClement said tissue removed from cadavers is typically used as
temporary skin for burn victims. He said it is not cost-effective
for the center, which treated more than 600 patients last year, to
accept everybody's donated skin.
   A commitment to helping others is nothing new for Mrs. Hudak.
   A decade ago, the former systems analyst signed a donor card
pledging to donate her body for scientific research when she dies.
She also donates blood every 56 days. ``I do as much as I can,'' she
said.

   Here, at a glance, is what the participants in the
Paris summit had to say about the outcome of the 15th annual
meeting, which ended Sunday.

<NOTE>President Bush, The United States</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush, attending his first economic summit, said the meetings were
``intensive and productive'' and in his view ``a clear success.''
   ``I am the new boy, the new kid in school, but the point I found
most interesting was the unstructured part,'' he said. ``The part
where you sit with the world leaders and tell them what you think,
listen to what they think. The more emphasis we place on that kind
of interaction, the better it would be.''
   Bush noted with satisfaction that the summit leaders agreed to
follow the U.S. lead in supporting the reform process in Poland and
Hungary. ``Democracy and economic growth go hand in hand,'' he said.
   He also said the summit marked a ``watershed on the
environment,'' and that he was pleased that his colleagues shared
his ``sense of urgency'' in the war against drugs.
   Bush said it was ``very interesting'' that Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev wrote to the summit, but that it was premature
to welcome the Soviets into the club of economic summitry.
   As to why the summit ended early, Bush said, ``We were kind of
running out of gas.''

   ``It was a very friendly and worthwhile summit ... All the hopes
that we brought to this summit have been fulfilled,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said.
   ``All in all an excellent summit with a tremendous willingness to
work together on the problems of the world economy, the environment
and drugs.''
   She said she was particularly pleased that the summit endorsed
``Britain's call'' for a framework convention on global climate
change, and its call for existing international bodies to be
strengthened rather than for the creation of new bodies.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the leaders were able to come to rapid
agreement on environmental concerns because they have ``become much
more imperative.''
   ``There was no question of people being in difficulties at home.
Whoever is in charge of politics must deal with the environment.''
   Asked about her treatment by the French in the wake of her
remarks playing down the importance of the French revolution, Mrs.
Thatcher said, ``I have not had anything that could even remotely be
termed a slight. Indeed I have received every attention.''
   She added, ``There is an excellent relationship between President
Mitterrand and myself.''

   Mitterrand, the host of the summit, was clearly pleased with the
outcome of the summit, which he scheduled to coincide with the
bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   ``To describe the work, the climate was excellent,'' the French
president said.
   Mitterrand said it was easier for the seven leaders to reach
agreement than in the past and that there was ``a great resolution
to coordinate policies.''
   He said that in this, the 15th year of these sessions, the
leaders had entered ``a new era and a new turning.''
   ``We have come to a different period. The precedent summits, more
or less yielded the desired results. Today, we see the achievements
... and also a certain number of menaces.''
   He said this is a period of consolidation of achievements from
the past which has allowed the seven to widen their interests to
things such as the environment or drugs.

   ``It was a splendid summit,'' Uno said. ``It was my first summit
and I was able to talk to all leaders gathered here. We were able to
trade views satisfactorily.''
   Uno noted that the final political declaration of the seven
followed the lines of Japan's views on the subject by condemning the
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators but avoiding the isolation
of China.
   Uno said his biggest contribution to the summit was Japan's
decision to expand by $35 billion its program to assist developing
countries.
   He said, ``the leaders were very appreciative of the untied
aspect'' of the aid.
   The program began in 1987 to distribute $30 billion in three
years, and Uno's extension brings the total to $65 billion over five
years.

<NOTE>Chancellor Helmut Kohl, West Germany</NOTE>

   Kohl deemed the Paris gathering a success because the leaders
addressed in their final communique a number of environmental issues
championed by the Bonn government.
   ``Seldom have I had such intensive discussions about
environmental protection as in the last days,'' Kohl told reporters.
   Referring to the summit's statements on curbing pollution, Kohl
said: ``I welcome this as I have attempted during all of the summits
in which I have participated to bring these important and urgent
themes into broader discussion.''
   Kohl also applauded the summit's moves to consolidate aid to East
European countries that have embarked on a reform course.
   ``We do not want to interfere in these processes, but the nations
that are for political and social reform and have decided for more
market economics should know that they can count on our
solidarity,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl restated his concern about inflationary tendencies in some
countries. All seven summit nations have witnessed varying degrees
of inflation over the past decade, including more than doubling of
prices in Italy.
   ``Good economic policy in this situation means to head off
inflation in good time,'' Kohl said.

<NOTE>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Canada</NOTE>

   Mulroney said Canada's goals for the summit ``have been achieved
in substantial measure. I am particularly gratified that the
environment was discussed at such considerable length.''
   He said he was struck by the ``urgency with which leaders from
around the world insisted that these (environmental) matters be
dealt with.''
   He said ``a part of the prescription'' for the U.S. and Canadian
economies was to reduce their budget deficits. ``In Canada, we will
resolutely persevere in our policy to bring the deficit down.''
   Mulroney said that of the five summits he has attended, this
year's was ``the one that achieved the largest degree of consensus.''
   Some leaders' interests were more directed toward environmental
matters, than economic ones, he said. ``That indicates a major
change in attitude from the first time I went to a summit when the
environment wasn't mentioned.''
   He said he was concerned that the leaders would not have enough
time to discuss key issues because of the side events of the French
bicentennial.
   But he said, ``It was an extremely productive summit,
well-organized.''

<NOTE>Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita of Italy</NOTE>

   De Mita viewed the summit a success because of its approach to
the problem of Third World debt, which totals some $1.3 trillion.
   ``The most significant thing in economic terms are the
conclusions about debt,'' he said.
   ``The problem has been addressed more completely,'' he said. ``We
have injected a discipline that is not just cosmetic.''
   As for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's letter seeking a
link between his country's economy and that of the West, De Mita
said, ``This marks the first time that the leader of a country that
contests the economic systems of the seven shows himself has an
interlocutor not as an opponent.
   ``We have in fact already responded to Mr. Gorbachev in our
East-West statement of yesterday,'' he said. ``It was a response in
favor of a dialogue.''

   Here is the text of President Bush's news conference
Sunday at the conclusion of the economic summit.
   Well, we've just concluded 2{ days of intensive and productive
meetings with the summit counterparts on economic and political
issues. And let me take this opportunity first of all to thank
President Mitterrand for his most gracious hospitality.
   The summit, in my view, was a clear success. We met in a time of
sustained economic growth, and agreed that the prospects are good
for the continued expansion without inflation of that growth. It was
against this backdrop that we conducted a wide-ranging discussion on
critical global issues, from East-West relations to the growing
environmental challenge that we face.
   We came to Paris at a truly remarkable moment. The winds of
change are bringing hope to people all around the world. And who
would have thought just a few short years ago that we would be
witness to a newly elected senate in Poland, or political pluralism
in Hungary? I was really touched by what I saw and heard in those
two countries _ people determined to keep their dreams alive, people
determined to see a Europe whole and free. And that's why America
brought to this summit our determination to support the reform
movement in Hungary and Poland.
   People yearning for freedom and democracy deserve our support,
and it's because of the community of values shared by these summit
countries that we were able to agree to meet soon to discuss
concerted action that will help Poland and ngary.
   Democracy and economic growth go hand in hand, whether in Eastern
Europe, the Summit 7, or the developing world. And therefore, much
of our discussion here in Paris centered on economics. We reaffirmed
our international economic cooperation and our whole policy
coordination process. Our strengthened debt strategy was firmly
supported. We reaffirmed our determination to maintain and improve
the multilateral trading system, calling for the completion of the
Uruguay Round by the end of 1990, and extending the GATT to new
areas including agriculture.
   This summit marked a watershed in the environment, and we agreed
that decisive action is urgently needed to preserve the earth. We
committed to work together as well as with the developing world to
meet our responsibility of global stewardship. The measures we've
agreed to in Paris are timely, and they lay the groundwork for
further specific steps when we meet again next year in the United
States.
   And finally, I was especially pleased to find that my colleagues
share our sense of urgency and sense of the importance of the
worldwide fight against drugs. Among other steps, we agreed to
establish a financial action task force to find new ways to track
and prevent the laundering of drug money.
   I look forward to meeting my summit colleagues in the United
States next year as we continue working on these and other priority
issues, build on the progress that we made genuine progress that I
think was made here in Paris. And I might say that I was very
pleased that this meeting coincided with the bicentennial here. It
was a very moving experience for all of us. Now, I will be glad to
take any questions. ...
   Q. Mr. Gorbachev wants to play a part in the world economic
discussions. Would he be welcomed at the next economic summit table?
   A. Well, I think that's a little premature, but it was very
interesting, I found, that a leader of the Soviet Union would
address a letter to the French president as head of this year's
summit. We talked about that letter a great deal. There's an awful
lot that has to transpire in the Soviet Union, it seems to me,
before anything of that nature would be considered. We're talking
about free market economies here and _ but I hought _ I found
fascinating the very fact of the letter. But there was no _ there's
certainly I don't think any indication that the next _ that he will
be attending the next summit. He'll get a very courteous and very
thoughtful reply from Mr. Mitterrand.
   Q. How about the poor countries, Bangladesh? Would they ever be
welcome?
   A. Well, this is an economic summit of countries whose economies
are drawn together by the free economies of the West and so I don't
think there's a question at this point of expanding the summit.
There is concern about the economies in the world that aren't doing
so well. Bangladesh is a country that does need aid and indeed the
communique addressed itself to trying to help Bangladesh. ...
   Q. Mr. President, you consulted with the NATO allies for military
matters in Brussels and then you had an economic summit here in
Paris. What's left before you sit down with Mr. Gorbachev for a
superpower summit?
   A. A little more time, I think.
   Q. But isn't there anything that you were _ any _ don't you have
anything to discuss with him now that you've gotten all this
groundwork laid?
   A. Oh, sure. Let me explain to those who aren't familiar with the
policy that Secretary Baker has met a couple of times with Mr.
Shevardnadze. There will be another such meeting of that nature, and
at an appropriate time I will have a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. But
I don't think anything at the summit influenced the bilateral _ that
bilateral meeting. ...
   Q. Mr. President, the summit calls for decisive action on the
environment but various environmental groups are saying that you did
not take decisive action. Could you respond to that?
   A. Well, I did see some _ one or two groups. They didn't think I
took decisive action when I sent _ or took proper action _ when I
sent a very far-reaching clean air proposal up to the Congress. And
_ so some have been critical. Many have been supportive on the broad
_ the very fact _ I'll tell you where we got a lot of support is the
very fact that the communique addressed itself with some specificity
to various environmental oals. The whole concept of cooperation on
research, technology and transfer to the LDCs, the prevention of
pollution, the idea of setting up monitoring stations so we can
better predict, and thus avoid, environmental disaster.
   There were _ there was a lot of common ground _ in fact, I would
say that on that and perhaps anti-narcotics, there was most fervor.
And so, I think many environmental groups see the very fact that
this matter was on the front burner as being _ as being very
positive. And the summit did take _ make strong enough statements to
commit all of our members, and hopefully others around the world, to
sound environmental practice. So I don't _ you get criticized, but I
think generally speaking it's been very, very forward-looking.

   Sudan's new military leader has asked the Soviet
Union to equip his armed forces with sophisticated weapons, a
newspaper said Sunday.
   The leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir, was quoted as
saying he asked ``the Soviet charge d'affairs in Khartoum to relay
our request to the Soviet leadership for modernizing the Sudanese
army's weaponry.''
   ``We also expressed our desire to return our relationship with
the Soviet Union to its pre-1970 level,'' he told the Kuwait daily,
Al-Seyassah.
   In that year, a pro-Moscow military officer, Maj. Hashem Atta,
staged an abortive coup against then-President Gaafar Nimeiri. The
attempt caused lasting Sudanese hostility toward the Soviet Union.
   ``We asked Moscow to overhaul all Soviet projects in Sudan and
build new projects. We also have Soviet arms and military equipment
which need maintenance,'' el-Bashir told the newspaper's reporters
in Khartoum.
   El-Bashir toppled Premier Sadek el-Mahdi's civilian government
June 30 and formed a 15-member military junta to rule the country.
   The newspaper quoted el-Bashir as saying that better relations
with Moscow also would ``eventually help resolve the rebellion issue
in the south.''
   Rebels in southern Sudan, who are supported by Ethiopia's
communist government, have been fighting since 1983 for greater
autonomy and for economic and administrative reforms.
   El-Bashir was quoted as saying the new military regime has
received economic aid from Arab countries in the form of fuel, flour
and medicines, but that it is looking for military aid as well.
   ``We believe that Arab states are interested in enabling Sudan to
have strong armed forces and effective police. Therefore, we expect
to receive arms from them,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.

   Q. Mr. President, you promised in Poland and Hungary that you
would seek concerted action on the part of the countries meeting
here to help those countries, and there seems to have been a pledge
that there would be concerted consideration of action _ no dollar
figure attached, and no specified action promised, and a meeting
apparently planned. Do you feel you got what you wanted, sir?
   A. I think so, and you'll notice ... that in both Poland and
Hungary, I stopped well short of setting dollar figures or
challenging others to meet dollar figures. But on this one, let
there be no doubt _ there was unanimity that we should address
ourselves to the problems of Poland and Hungary. And so, I was not
disappointed. I didn't go in there with a specific package of _ with
dollar figures on it. And I think an early meeting to do just that
is good. It calls for food aid to Poland _ that's specific. Doesn't
have a figure on it. But no, I think we got what we sought, and
there was no rancor on that question _ and no division on the
question. But there was unanimity that we have to move on it. ...
   Q. Can you tell us, since you said that you spent a lot of time
last night talking about Mr. Gorbachev's letter, can you tell us a
little bit about those discussions? And can you tell us what your
view is? What is an ppropriate response from the West to such an
extraordinary request by Mr. Gorbachev to become part of the economy
of the Western democracies?
   A. We would welcome any movement by the Soviet Union towards
market-oriented or Western economies. There is no question about
that. And there's nothing begrudging about our saying ... that I
don't expect Mr. Gorbachev to sit as a member of the _ at next
year's summit. But the discussion was started off by, ``What do you
think he means by this?'' And a lot of discussion _ ``We'll get the
experts to analyze it.'' And all of that took place, and people
concluded that it was just one more manifestation of the changing
world we're living in. And that, I think, was the main message.
   And then where we go from here _ his _ some of that has been
addressed in the communique, because we talked in there about help
for the Third World. And some of his letter, as you know, was on
that very subject. So it was _ when it came in, Mr. Mitterrand read
it off to the group there and then said, ``Well, what will we do?''
And my suggestion was, which he had intended to adopt anyway, that
he, as the man to whom the letter was addressed, would reply to it.
So that's the way it was.
   And the fact that it's happening, taking place _ the president of
the United States can go to Eastern Europe and witness the very kind
of change we're talking about. I'll tell you ... but the most _
almost the most dramatic for me was when Mr. Nemeth, the prime
minister of Hungary, handed me that piece of barbed wire, tearing
down the Iron Curtain between Hungary and Austria. Now, who would
have thought that possible? And this letter _ just one more
manifestation of the exciting times we're in _ of change. They're
moving towards our open system, our free system, our system of free
elections. And that's the way I would look at the letter, in that
context.
   Q. Mr. President, in connection with next year's summit, there's
been some talk among some of your people about possibly having it in
your home state of Texas, possibly in San Antonio. And I wondered
whether you'd like to see that.
   A. Well, I'd have to run that by the Dallas Morning News and see
how they felt about it, but that's a distinct possibility. However,
it's too early. No decision has been made. The fact that Jim Baker's
from Houston, and I'm from Houston, and Bob Mosbacher's from Texas
should have nothing to do with where the next summit's going to be.
And there has been no decision.
   Q. That wouldn't mean some discrimination against Dallas because
of your roots?
   A. No, none whatsoever. You get that down _ the fall elections
are up in 1990. ...
   Q. Let me follow on the question about summits. These things have
gotten a lot bigger than they were originally planned to be _
hundreds of your people, thousands of us. It's your first summit,
but you've got to host the next one. Have you given any thought to
how you want to do it, in terms of style?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No, but I'll tell you the part _ and I'm the new
boy, the new kid in school _ but the part I found most interesting
was the unstructured part, the part where you sit with these other
leaders, tell them what you think, listen carefully to what they
think, and that happens sometimes in the corridors or sometimes
before a structured seminar, sometimes at a meal. And I would like
to think that the more emphasis we placed on that kind of
interaction, the better it would be. But there was no discussion by
the Soviet _ by the summit interlocutors on how to restructure it.
   Indeed, it went smoothly. And it _ I will again say that Mr.
Mitterrand handled the formal part very well. But for me, I'd like
to see more just plain unstructured interaction between the leaders,
where you don't just have to talk on the agenda items. ...
   Q. It will be 20 years ago next Thursday that man first landed on
the moon. There are some people in your administration that would
like for you to announce on Thursday that we're going to go back to
the moon, possibly even to Mars. Can you and Dick Darman find that
kind of money in the budget?
   A. Well, you put your finger ... on some of the real problems,
the major problem on setting major goals for space _ space
exploration. And whether we will be ready by next week and@or later
this week to make any momentous announcements, I'm not sure. I have
not made a decision on what we will say on that historic day.
   Q. ... with the Soviets on it, though?
   A. Well, that has been suggested, but _ and some, as you know,
some discussions have gone on, not, I don't think recently between
us on the Soviets on this, but certainly the concept of
international is not offensive to me. But we'll have to wait and
see, because no decision _ we're going to go right across and then
work our way back down here.

   Q. Mr. President, Friday's economic indicator showed some
weakening of the U.S. economy. Apparently, some of your summit
partners expressed some concern about that. What assurances did you
give them and can you give us that we're not headed for a recession?
   A. Well, you know, ironically, none did express to me their
concern about the US economy stalling out. We really didn't get into
that discussion. I must say that from time to time, it is a matter
of concern to me, and thus, I've tried to think through with our
secretary of the Treasury and others the concept of how the interest
rate structure should be. But I've had no indication from home, nor
have we picked up any here that they felt that the U.S. economy was
going to move towards a recession. And that's the thing, of course,
that you'd want to guard against.
   Our growth has not been as robust as the growth in some other
countries, but it _ we're still moving. And when you have a several
trillion dollar gross national product, you take a small percentage
of growth, and it makes for enormous dollar figures in growth.
   Q. Mr. President, how much change would the Soviet Union have to
make before they could earn an invitation to next year's economic
summit? If you can't answer that specifically, at least could you
give us some sense of scale?
   A. Well, one, as you know, I welcome the reforms that are taking
place in the Soviet Union, but I don't _ this concept of the Soviets
coming to a G-7 summit has never been, to my knowledge, thought much
about until this letter appeared. So, there's no standards for
entrance into he G-7. The Soviet economy needs a lot of work, and I
say that not to be critical, but certainly, that's an objective
judgment. The economy is in bad, bad shape, far worse shape than the
Western economies.
   And so, I think what we ought to do is to encourage the kinds of
economic changes in Eastern Europe, and to the degree the Soviets
would not consider that an intervention into their internal affairs
in the Soviet Union, and that _ those should be the next steps.
Welcome the interest that was shown by this letter. This wasn't an
application for admission to the G-7. It was saying, ``Let's do
something in a common way about solving problems around the world.''
   And so, I wouldn't set a standard right now. I'd simply say let
each of us try to get our economies in order, and as soon as that
happens, and as soon as we see the manifestations of freedom break
out there in terms of demonstrably free elections all over _ you
know, then we start talking about democratic change, and then they
approach us. But, I don't think _ I think it's very premature to
start laying down guidelines from here as to what we need to do on
that. ...
   Q. Mr. President, you've talked about a whole and united Europe.
And Mr. Gorbachev has talked about a common European home. Are they
the same concept or what is the difference? Is _ does there _ the
difference between the role of the U.S. in those two statements?
   A. Europe whole and free is our concept. His common European home
is fine _ so long, as I said earlier, you can move from room to
room. And that means a coming along further on human rights. That
means much more openness. It means support him when you see them
move towards perestroika and glasnost. But it means an evolution in
the Soviet Union, and it means an evolution in Eastern Europe. And
we've begun to see it.
   A Europe whole and free does not visualize a Europe where you
still have barbed wire separating some people, or you still have
human rights abuses in one or two of the countries that are
egregious. And so, it _ it is whole and free. And the ``common
home'' theme is a good one. I mean, that's a very good theme, and we
should encourage it. But we want to see these countries continue to
move towards what works, and what works is freedom, democracy,
market economy _ things of that nature.
   Q. In the meeting of the G-7, is there room, or does _ did you
sense the countries want U.S. leadership, or they want the U.S. to
be a co-equal partner?
   A. You mean, with the Soviets? No, I sense that they _ that those
colleagues feel that we have disproportionate responsibility. I
think there's a keen interest in how I will work with the Soviets _
there's no question about that. I felt that very clearly.
   Q. At the risk of seeming fixated by Mr. Gorbachev, when you
discussed his letter, was there a suggestion from anybody that it
might have been a bit of mischief, or an attempt to get some
publicity out of the Western summit?
   A. I can't say that that never occurred, but I don't think that
after people thought about it rationally, that anyone was prepared
to say that and that alone was what motivated this letter. There is
change taking place, and I think for some time people really
wondered whether I was a little begrudging in recognizing that
change and encouraging that change. But I think, now that has been
laid to rest, so when you see something of this nature, you take a
look at it and you assess it, and then you _ but you don't discount
it in a cynical fashion.
   But I think there was _ the timing _ this summit has been planned
for a long time, and this letter might have come in earlier on for
more serious sherpa consideration, as every other issue was
subjected to marvelous work by the sherpas _ who, incidentally, did
a superb job, and this one didn't. So, I _ I think people would
excuse a reasonable degree of cynicism, but I don't think the
conclusion was cynical.

   Q. Mr. President, going back to the other day in Poland. An
elderly man said that, ``When people who talk to you boast about
change, just remember that the Communists still have the bayonets.''
So my question to you is, do you believe that countries like Poland
and Hungary are really going to have serious and permanent change,
or is there a line that their leaders and Moscow just won't go past?
   A. Well, no. I think that you've already seen serious change. I
think you see the political situation in Hungary, for example, is
absolutely amazing compared to the way we used to view _ view
Hungary. And if the Soviet Union, instead of taking their troops out
of Hungary had tried to tighten down, I don't expect we'd see the
kind of change in Hungary that we're seeing today. And so I'd say
that we're a long way from what Gorbachev has spelled out as a
common European home, but it's moving. So let's encourage the
progress. I hink maybe I missed the nuance of your question.
   Q. That there ought to _ that there is a course that's going to
lead to a permanent change; or again the question is, are the
Soviets going to step in and pull the rug out from under it _
   A. Well, I would quote Mr. Gorbachev's words back to him on that.
What he told me in New York and what Jim Baker has heard from
Shevardnadze and what everybody who interacts with the Soviets here,
and that is that perestroika is for real. You cannot set the clock
back. It is going to go forward, and so I would see that as what
guides now. However, I have said as long as there are enormous
imbalances in conventional forces and in certain categories of
strategic forces, the West should keeps its eyes wide open. And
indeed there was some reference to that in this communique. here was
unanimity on the part of the NATO allies that we ought to be
cautious and that we _ and so to answer your question, it's not _
it's not a done deal. And that's, I think, what was being reflected
there in Poland. ...
   Q. Mr. President ... I wonder, as you put all of this together,
what you said about Poland and Hungary, and Gorbachev asking to join
the world economy, as a matter of policy do you see the Cold War
over, and do you think the West has won it?
   A. I don't like to use, quote, ``Cold War,'' unquote. That _ that
has a connotation of worse days in terms of East-West relationship.
I think things have move forward so that the connotation that those
two words conjure up is entirely different now. And yet, I don't
want to stand here and seem euphoric, that everything is hunky-dorey
between the East and the West on arms, or on differences in economy,
or on how we look at regional problems. We have some big differences
still. But let's encourage the change and then I can answer your
question in a few more _ maybe a few more years more definitively.
...
   Q. Mr. President, the ``Summit 7'' leaders are celebrating a
gathering that was so successful it went 2{ days instead of three.
Could you not find another half day's worth of problems to discuss
and maybe resolve, sir?
   A. We were kind of running out of gas. I'll tell you, it's been a
vigorous experience in physical fitness for me, and I try to stay in
pretty good shape. But this one, when you couple the summit with the
bicentennial and then tack on Poland and Hungary, I wasn't about to
argue we needed more time, and nor was anyone else. I think the fact
that this rather complex agenda was completed in harmony is the fact
that ought to really carry the spotlight, not the fact that we
finished in advance.
   There's going to be plenty of opportunities to discuss a lot more
problems that exist around the world. But we had an agenda, we
addressed it, we finished it on time and it was done harmoniously.
So, I think that's why it worked out and that is exactly what
happened. We did complete it, and we had a lot more opportunity
because of the bicentennial to have interaction with the other
eaders. More so than at any other summit.
   Q. Do you feel, sir, you accomplished all you could?
   A. We accomplished what we set out to accomplish.
   Q. Mr. President, the stealth bomber had a couple of setbacks
this week. And Senator Nunn, as I understand it, indicated he's not
going to pay for a plane that just taxis. Do you have faith in this
project or are you alarmed by the recent developments?
   A. Well, it's Senator Nunn and 250 million other Americans that
pick up the bill for it. But he's not going to pay for it _ I mean
it's a _ it's a decision that the Congress is going to have to take
collectively. If Senator Nunn decides that it isn't a good idea,
it's going to be a whale of a fight. But I think that legitimate
questions have been raised about the bomber, and Secretary Cheney
has addressed them very forcefully, giving the administration's
position.
   Being gone, I don't have quite as sensitive a feel as I would if
I were back home, of the nuances of the battle. But we have gone
forward with our proposal and now it's up to the Congress to decide
what they're going to do. And when I saw Dick Cheney in essence
saying, ``Make up you minds,'' I think he was doing the right thing.
When I saw Senator Nunn expressing his reservations, we have to
understand he's doing what he is obligated to do as chairman of that
committee. But it'll be sorted out, I think. ...

   Q. Mr. President, you're giving away money to Poland and Hungary,
and you're talking about spending more money on the environment, and
there are a lot of needs at home, and now you're in a new budget
cycle. Is this the time _ and you promised today to reduce the
deficit, the U.S. budget deficit. Is this the time to announce that
it's necessary to raise taxes in the United States?
   A. No.
   Q. But how are you going to do it, then? How are you going to _
   A. Well, we've already got a proposal up on the Hill, and look at
it very carefully. And our director of the OMB has done a very good
job in sorting out priorities. He's worked _ and our Cabinet has
given him full cooperation, and the proposals that I have made can
be and are included in our budget thinking, not just for this year
but beyond.
   But you put your finger on something that does trouble me when I
come to countries like Poland and Hungary. I wish we did have more,
more funds with which to help others, encourage private investment
and public-private partnerships and privatization. I wish we had
much more to do there, or if speedily applied to environmental
concerns or anti-narcotics cooperation.
   So, I don't want to sound like we have it all made at all. We've
had to sort through priorities in a very complicated way. But, to
answer your question, you have to go up to the question that was
earlier asked about the economy itself, and I do not want to risk
screeching growth, modest though it may be, to a halt by raising
revenues in the way that some have suggested. ...
   Q. Mr. President ... in Eastern Europe, you talked about two big
concept links. One, encouraging democracy and moves toward a market
economy; and two, that you weren't there to try to raise tensions
with the Soviet Union or challenge them in any way. But my question
is, if what you want is carried out, moves to democracy and a market
economy, aren't you really talking about the dissolution of the
Soviet empire, and is that what you mean when you call for a Europe
that is whole and free?
   A. The Soviet empire, if you mean the imposition of a Marxist
system, or socialism _ in their definition _ system on others, yes,
I'd like to see Europe whole and free. And _ but, with the Soviets
moving towards market _ and they're not there _ towards more
freedom, towards more openness, they themselves have recognized that
their system doesn't work. So, you don't run the risks or have the
same tension that we might have had 10 years ago talking about the
very same themes I talked about in Poland, in Hungary. I went to _
some of you were on this trip _ went to Vienna several years ago,
and gave a speech. And a man _ the speech was on differentiation.
And _ and I will spare him identification _ but a Hungarian official
told me that he personally _ befriended us, and we talked carefully
_ had gotten a lot of grief over the fact that we had singled out
Hungary as a country that was moving _ even then, even those short
years ago _ moving in a way that their changes could be accommodated
by closer relationships with the West. And that conversation I had
on this trip showed me how clear, how dynamic the change. So, we're
_ I don't think there's a risk of _ if we're right in our assessment
that change is going forward, I on't think there is this risk. ...
   Q. Is Mr. Mitterrand free to reply to the Gorbachev letter
himself, or will it be circulated, or would you like to see the
letter? How would you like that to go forward?
   A. No, I think that he should reply to it himself. He has a good
relationship with Mr. Gorbachev. Gorbachev was here. They've had
some follow up, I believe, and the letter was addressed to him,
albeit as president of the summit. And so, I think that _ I think
it's fitting that he simply use his good judgment and reply to it in
any way he wants, and that's exactly what he is going to do,
incidentally. That was discussed. ...
   Q. Mr. President, did you _ well, in this summit, did you achieve
all your goals? Do you have the feeling of being the winner, No. 1,
of this summit?
   A. Well, I've pointed out before we came over here that something
of this nature ought not to be judged in terms of winners and
losers. Your question sounds very much like some that we engage in
at home _ who's up, who's down; who's ahead, who's winning; who's
more popular, who's ahead in the poll _ Bush or Gorbachev in Eastern
Europe or Connecticut ... and it doesn't really have much to do with
that. What _
   Q. But are you satisfied _ if you are very satisfied _ did you
meet your goals?
   A. I am very satisfied. I am very satisfied that the summit
achieved its goals. Every other summit leader tells me that it was
the best summit they have attended. And I again would salute the
president of the French Republic for the way in which he conducted
the meetings. But, yes, I am very, very satisfied. And there aren't
any winners or losers or who's up or who's down.
   We got _ we're together is how we approached the East. We're
together is how we approached the environmental questions. I didn't
take a question here on Third World debt, but there's a strong
endorsement for the Brady Plan. And there was no dissension on that
approach. So it came together very, very well. Mr. Brady _ and I
shouldn't say this _ I know this is going to get me in real trouble.
But if the Brady Plan looks like it's going to be successful, we may
call it the Bush Plan.
   Thank you all very, very much.

<HEAD>Trade Unions Plan Protest of Parliamentary Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The largest black labor
federation Sunday threatened a week of protests prior to
parliamentary elections in September and demanded the government
repeal restrictions on trade union activity.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions completed a four-day
conference with a call to ``intensify our campaign of resistance''
aimed at dismantling apartheid and capitalism.
   The congress said that unless the government repeals the
controversial Labor Relations Act by Sept. 1, member unions will
take ``sustained action'' against parliamentary elections set for
Sept. 6.
   Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the 921,000-member congress, did
not say what tactics the group would use. Similar calls in the past
have resulted in mass strikes.
   Whites, Asians and people of mixed race will vote for the three
separate houses of Parliament in segregated elections. Under
apartheid, the country's 28 illion blacks have no voice in national
affairs.
   Naidoo said a ``workers' summit'' would be convened in August to
develop campaigns against the elections and the Labor Relations Act.
   The year-old legislation has strengthened management's ability to
end strikes through court action and allows companies to sue unions
for losses incurred during a strike.
   Naidoo also said the congress, banned from political activity,
wants to play a leading role in creating a huge anti-apartheid
coalition.
   The congress will seek to arrange a conference no later than
October, Naidoo said. The conference was suggested by the National
Union of Mineworkers, which has about 300,000 members and is the
largest affiliate of the congress.
   Anti-apartheid groups have been attempting to form unified
strategies since the July 5 meeting between President P.W. Botha and
jailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela, leader of the African
National Congress.
   Some organizations have called the meeting a positive
development, while others maintain it is merely government
propaganda.
   ``There has to be a clear signal from the apartheid regime that
it is interested in genuine negotiations,'' Naidoo told a news
conference. ``This has not happened.''
   Local newspapers have said that Naidoo and the president of the
congress, Elijah Barayi, are among several dozen people that Mandela
has requested to see at Victor Verster Prison on Tuesday, his 71st
birthday.
   Naidoo and Barayi said they would welcome the opportunity to meet
Mandela but have not received permission from prison officials.
   The congress supports the ANC, the main guerrilla group
attempting to undermine the white-led government. However, the
organizations disagree on some issues. For example, the ANC says it
will accept a mixed economy in South Africa while the labor
federation says it is committed to socialism.
   The meeting, attended by almost 2,000 delegates, reaffirmed its
support for comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South
Africa. It also called for foreign companies operating in South
Africa to divest and turn over their property and equipment to the
local community.

   A security guard disappeared with more than $1.5
million in cash belonging to a tour company after he picked it up
from a jet at Heathrow Airport, and he may have been abducted,
police said Sunday.
   Ports and airports throughout Britain were told to be on the
lookout for Philip Cedric Wells, 44, who disappeared Friday evening
after collecting the money from a TAP Air Portugal flight.
   Wells, who is employed by Chalmers Security Systems Ltd., was to
drive the money from the plane to an airport warehouse. Wells never
showed up and his van was found abandoned a few miles away, police
said.
   Inside the van, police found more than $8,000 in pay packets
Wells was supposed to deliver to his colleagues. Wells' own pay
packet was missing, police said, as was the travel agency's money.
   A Scotland Yard spokesman said Wells may have been abducted after
picking out his own pay packet in the usual way.
   The missing money belonging to the Thomas Cook travel agency
consisted of several currencies and was packed in nine shoe
box-sized packages in gray canvas sacks.

<HEAD>Policeman Serves As Ear and Voice For Deaf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Folks in the neighborhood call Dan Levin ``the
sign-language policeman,'' and he may be the only one in the nation.
   His interest in communicating with the deaf has helped Levin nab
suspects and even a wife, a deaf woman he met while investigating
house vandalism.
   ``I never caught the offender,'' he says. ``I just caught the
victim.''
   That meeting 12 years ago launched Levin's career as a
sign-language police officer, working with deaf victims and
defendants in a city with an estimated 26,000 deaf people.
   ``Dan is invaluable,'' said Diana Thorpe, president of the
Illinois Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. ``Can I underline
that? Fourteen zillion times? Anything from a parking ticket to
murder, all you have to say is, `Go see Dan Levin.'''
   Representatives of deaf organizations in Chicago, New York, Los
Angeles and Washington, D.C., say they know of no other certified
sign interpreter in the country who also works as a police officer.
   Like many police officers, Levin once worked a beat car, but he
now works out of police headquarters where he uses a specially
equipped telephone with a typewriter keyboard to take calls from
deaf crime victims.
   His abilities helped solve the murder of deaf woman, Linda
Sanborn, whose body was found in her apartment. Her special
telephone for the deaf, a video game and household items were
missing.
   Investigators later learned that four deaf people had discussed
the woman's death days before her body was found in November 1987.
   Officers called in Levin to interpret for a deaf witness, who
could remember only the first name, Danny, of one of those who
discussed the woman's death.
   Levin had had contact several times with a Danny Lord, and two of
the incidents involved burglaries. Police found Lord, who later
confessed to the killing.
   Because Levin was able to advise Lord of his rights in sign,
Lord's attorney was unable to attack the confession in later in
court. Lord could get the death penalty when he is sentenced
Wednesday.
   ``I thought I'd be able to attack the credibility of the
interpreter,'' said Assistant Public Defender James Mullenix. ``But
after talking to two certified court interpreters and a private guy,
they all said the same thing; `Dan Levin is an excellent
interpreter.' It was unfortunate for us.''
   By night, Levin has interpreted a class for a hearing-impaired
medical student, related the ``bedside chats'' of doctors to deaf
patients, served as courtroom interpreter for deaf witnesses, and
translated therapy sessions for adolescent psychiatric patients.
   The extra money is helpful. Levin and his wife have two children,
ages 2 and 4. The children are not deaf, but they are learning sign.
   ``I feel I have the best of both worlds,'' he said. ``It's very
broadening to me individually. It's rewarding. I feel I'm lucky to
be in this position. Sometimes, I can hardly believe it myself.''
   It all began in 1977, when Levin volunteered to help a deaf woman
whose home was being pelted repeatedly by rocks.
   Levin had remembered some finger-spelling from his boyhood, when
he watched his best friend converse in sign language with his deaf
parents. So he agreed to put the home of Janice Roberts on special
patrol.
   On his second visit to the house, he asked Ms. Roberts for a book
on sign language.
   ``After a couple of months, I thought I learned enough sign
language to aske her out,'' Levin said. About three years later,
they were married.
   ``I was intrigued,'' Levin said. ``She seemed to have a nice
quality about her. I don't know how else to describe it. Something
clicked.''

<HEAD>Parliament Speaker Says Iran Doesn't Want to Export Revolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has no intention of exporting its
fundamentalist revolution, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani was
quoted Sunday as saying.
   ``We do not want to strain relations with the countries which
would like to have healthy ties with us,'' Rafsanjani said in an
interview with the Jomhuri Islami daily.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
Rafsanjani told the newspaper Iran will continue to promote Islam
but ``this doesn't mean interference in the affairs of others.''
   Rafsanjani's remarks indicated Iran is eager to allay fears it is
committed to establishing Islamic regimes in other Moslem nations.
   Both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have distanced themselves from Iran
on grounds that Islamic extremists were seeking to undermine their
pro-Western governments.
   Rafsanjani, considered a moderate in comparison to Iran's
hard-liners, is the overwhelming favorite in a presidential election
to be held July 28.
   He is a close political ally of President Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
another reputed pragmatist, who was elected Iran's spiritual leader
after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on June 3.
   Rafsanjani reiterated earlier statements that Iran would steer a
political course that was ``neither East nor West.''
   Rafsanjani said Iran was committed to making peace with Iraq
after the gulf war, halted by a United Nations-mediated cease-fire
last Aug. 20, but had set no date for resuming peace talks ``because
the talks are still immature.''
   The negotations are stalled over various issues.
   Rafsanjani also admitted that Iran is in critical need of
technical experts and managers to develop the economy. Thousands of
skilled Iranians left the country and educational standards declined
during the years of revolutionary fervor and the eight-year war with
Iraq.
   ``We particularly suffer from an acute shortage of researchers,''
he said.
   He noted that industries were running at 30 percent to 40 percent
of capacity because of severe shortages of ``materials, energy or
parts.''
   Rafsanjani said he plans to focus the country's economic future
on developing its vast natural gas reserves ``as the best and
richest sources of energy.''
   Building up gas as a major export and energy source will involve
major foreign assistance.
   Rafsanjani's moves to end Iran's isolation suffered a setback in
February when Khomeini sentenced British author Salman Rushdie to
death for his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' Some said the book
insulted Islam. The death order led to a break in relations between
Iran and Britain.

<DATELINE>LIMA, PERU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army attacked a guerrilla training camp and
killed 22 rebels in two clashes in the coca-growing region of Peru's
jungle, a government communique said Sunday.
   The communique said the clashes occurred Thursday and Friday in
the province of Leoncio Prado, 180 miles northeast of Lima.
   On Thursday, army troops in helicopters discovered and attacked a
training camp of the leftist Shining Path and killed 17 guerrillas,
according to the communique. The troops followed some guerrillas
that fled and killed five more on Friday, it said.
   It was the fourth major military operation against the guerrillas
in two weeks in Huanuco, a department that encompasses much of the
Upper Huallaga river valley, where most of Peru's illicit coca crop
is grown.
   The military says a total of 97 Shining Path guerrillas have been
killed in the attacks, carried out by the army and the air force.
One soldier has been killed and two wounded, officials say.
   The Maoist-inspired Shinig Path began its armed insurgency in
1980 in the southern highlands area around Ayacucho, 235 miles
southeast of Lima. The guerrillas' influenece since has spread
through much of the Andean highlands and the coca-growing region of
the northern jungle.
   The government has said narcotics traffickers pay the rebels for
permission to operate in the area.

<TEXT>
   A man identified by police as a ``viable suspect''
in the Green River serial murder case says in a statement from jail
that authorities ``made me out to be a very bad person, and I am
not.''
   The Green River killings apparently ended in 1984, but public
attention was focused on the case last week with the release of an
affidavit used to obtain a search warrant in the case.
   William Jay Stevens II ``is a colorful character, but he's no
murderer,'' his lawyer said after authorities labeled Stevens a
suspect in the nation's worst serial slaying case and seized his
travel receipts, 1,800 videotapes and police paraphernalia.
   The killer, named for the stream south of Seattle where the first
victims were found, has been blamed by police for the deaths of 40
young women and the disappearances of eight others, many of them
prostitutes, from 1982 to 1984.
   Stevens, 38, jailed in Seattle on other offenses since January,
has not been charged in any of the deaths and disappearances.
   But the affidavit signed by Al Mathews, a King County deputy
prosecutor, described the former Gonzaga University law student as
``a viable suspect in the Green River homicides, and possibly (17)
others in the Pacific Northwest.''
   Stevens' lawyer, Craig Beles, accused the task force of
``grasping at straws'' and said his client ``is concerned he's being
singled out as the answer to a longtime investigation.''
   In a statement issued by Beles late Saturday, Stevens denied any
connection to the case.
   ``I am not the Green River killer. The Green River Task Force has
not treated me or my family fairly,'' the statement said. ``They
have made me out to be a very bad person, and I am not. People
should know the fact that I have never hurt anyone in my life.
   ``I will discuss this matter in an orderly and honorable fashion
in a court of law.''
   When asked if Stevens was considering legal action against King
County, Beles told The Seattle Times: ``I think he is contemplating
that.''
   Beles said his client is ``a character and he's got friends and
he's got enemies.''
   King County police Capt. Robert C. Evans, commander of the Green
River Task Force, said it would take a month to examine the material
taken under search warrant last week from two Spokane homes used by
Stevens. The 55 bags and boxes seized did not, however, include any
clothing, jewelry or other effects from Green River victims, Evans
said.
   Stevens is jailed in Seattle, serving a one-year term for a 1979
burglary and additional time for walking away from a work-release
center in 1981. He was rearrested in January on the old charges
after a telephone tip was received when a television program on the
Green River case was broadcast.
   Stevens, who served two years as president of the student bar
association at Gonzaga University in Spokane, was described in the
affidavit as a former Army military police officer and unsuccessful
police job applicant.
   Police seized Seattle and Portland, Ore., police uniforms, law
enforcement badges, and 1,800 videotapes, of thus-far undisclosed
subjects. Investigators had long suggested the killer might have
been someone posing as a police officer.
   In the lengthy affidavit, friends of Stevens are quoted as saying
he believed prostitutes were spreading AIDS, wanted to make films of
hookers being dismembered and told others the killing of Green River
victims had been filmed.

<HEAD>Peace Talks Resume Between Marxist Government And U.S.-Backed Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace talks aimed at ending the 14-year
civil war in Angola resumed Sunday with negotiators seeking a way to
stabilize a cease-fire between the Marxist government and
U.S.-backed rebels.
   Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro Van Dunem led the Angolan
delegation, which pulled out of the talks two weeks ago claiming
guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi's forces were violating the
cease-fire. The guerrillas also have accused the government of truce
violations.
   Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, arrived in the Zairean capital Sunday morning for a
meeting with President Mobutu Sese Seko, said Zairean government
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Savimbi has excluded himself from direct participation in the
peace negotiations.
   Savimbi and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos agreed to
the cease-fire and negotiations June 22 at a meeting in Mobutu's
ancestral village of Gbadolite.
   Under the agreement, sealed with a handshake by Savimbi and dos
Santos, the cease-fire was to begin June 24 and a commission was to
be established to discuss peace terms.
   Since the direct talks broke down, however, both sides have
disagreed over exactly what they agreed to at Gbadolite.
   The government insists on Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's
version that Savimbi agreed to leave Angola during a transitional
period leading to national reconciliation. Guerrilla officials in
Lisbon, Portugal, denied that Savimbi made any such pledge and
called proposals for the rebel leader's exile ``an insult.''
   The guerrillas have been fighting to share control with the
government since the Marxists took power and declared a one-party
state shortly after the country's independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Under the terms of U.S.-mediated peace accords signed in December
by Angola, South Africa and Cuba, South Africa pledged to halt aid
to the guerrillas and grant independence to Angola's southern
neighbor, Namibia.
   In return, about 50,000 Cuban troops supporting the Angolan
government have begun a gradual withdrawl from Angola.

   From Margaret Thatcher to Francois Mitterrand: it
was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
   Or at least that's the opening of the celebrated book, Charles
Dickens' ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' that the British prime minister
left as a farewell present for her French host as she departed the
economic summit Sunday.
   Thatcher, who ruffled her hosts with derogatory comments about
the French revolution when she arrived for the Paris summit, gave
Mitterrand a copy of the novel that contrasts revolutionary Paris in
1789 with the tranquility of London.
   Mrs. Thatcher insisted before returning to London that her
relationship with Mitterrand was ``excellent.''
   But she stuck to her view that the French revolution, which
sparked a reign of terror, was not the origin of the concept of
human rights.
   ``I can't change history, neither can you,'' she said at a press
conference.
   She dded that perhaps the original concept belonged to neither
Britain's Magna Carta of 1215 nor the French revolution.
   ``I pointed out that the first one was the Ten Commandments and
the Sermon the Mount,'' she said.

   A playful President Bush said Sunday there was ``a
distinct possibility'' that he might choose his adopted state of
Texas as site of next year's economic summit.
   No decision has yet been made, said Bush, adding, ``The fact that
(Secretary of State) Jim Baker's from Houston, and I'm from Houston,
and (Secretary of Commerce) Bob Mosbacher's from Texas should have
nothing to do with where the next summit's going to be.''
   The question was raised by a reporter for the Dallas Morning News
at Bush's news conference following completion of the 15th annual
economic summit of the world's seven largest industrialized
democracies.
   Asked if he might bring the world leaders to Texas, possibly to
San Antonio, the president remarked, ``That's a distinct
possibility. However, it's too early. No decision has been made.''
   In 1983, during the United States' last turn to host the event,
former President Ronald Reagan chose colonial Williamsburg, Va., as
the site of the meetings, which annually draw thousands of
reporters, diplomats and financial leaders from around the world.
   Meanwhile, back in the Lone Star state, Texas officials said it
sounds good to them.
   ``I think that's a great idea,'' said state House Speaker Gib
Lewis, who recommended his hometown of Forth Worth as ``a super
city'' for a summit.
   Mike Toomey, chief of staff to Gov. Bill Clements, said, ``Texas
would love to host such a summit.''
   ``The hospitality of Texans is universally and internationally
known. We certainly could take care of everybody who joins the
summit,'' Toomey said.
   Although born and raised in New England, Bush moved to Texas as a
young man after World War II and college to enter the oil business.
   He still maintains Houston as his voting residence, although he
stays in a hotel room when he visits. The only home Bush owns is his
oceanfront retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people filled a large arena
Sunday for an enthusiastic opposition rally that opened Chile's
first presidential election campaign in 19 years.
   Voters in December will pick a succeessor to military President
Augusto Pinochet, who took power in a bloody military coup in 1973.
   Patricio Aylwin, the candidate put forward by a coalition of 17
opposition parties, spoke to the estimated 10,000 people who crammed
the Caupolican Theatre. About 5,000 more listened to loudspeakers
set up in nearby streets.
   Aylwin stressed the need for a united opposition to restore
democracy in Chile.
   ``My government will not be the government of my own party, the
Christian Democracy, nor the government of the opposition
coalition,'' the 70-year-old law professor and former senator said.
``I want to be the president of all Chileans.''
   The presidential and congressional elections are scheduled for
Dec. 14. The new government is to take office on March 11, 1990. It
will be the first presidential election since Chileans chose
Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist, in 1970.
   Gen. Pinochet called the elections after losing an October
referendum in which voters rejected a proposal to extend his rule
until 1997. Pinochet, has said, however, he intends to remain as
army commander after the election.
   The opposition has united behind Aylwin, and opinion polls show
him leading government candidates by a wide margin.
   Pinochet supporters have become increasingly divided and have
failed to agree on a presidential candidate; two former ministers in
Pinochet's Cabinet are vying for the spot.
   National Renewal, the largest conservative party, nominated
Sergio Jarpa, 68, a former interior minister, while the Independent
Democratic Union chose Hernan Buchi, 40, a former finance minister.
   Aylwin said at the rally that if elected, his government's
economic policies would emphasize aid to the nation's poor.
   Although the civilian government in Chile will inherit an economy
that is one of the strongest in South America, wages have dropped by
35 percent since 1981. About 38 percent of the country's 12 million
people live below the poverty line and 22 percent live in extreme
poverty, according to the Center for Studies on Development, a
private resesarch institute.
   Aylwin said he also would seek ``truth and justice,'' not
revenge, for human rights violations under Pinochet's military
regime.
   After seizing power, the military began a harsh repression of
leftists who supported the Allende government. Church and human
rights groups have said at least 750 people disappeared after being
arrested following the coup.
   Aylwin on Monday was to fly to Arica in northern Chile, where he
was to begin a campaign tour of the provinces.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain Causes Flooding Along East Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain fell over the central East Coast on Sunday, causing
scattered flooding that forced residents from one apartment building
and closed some rural roads, and an apparent tornado caused damage
in Durham, N.C.
   Showers and thunderstorms were widespread from North Carolina
into southern New York state. The ground in much of that region was
already saturated after recent heavy rain.
   Flood watches were posted through the night for parts of
Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and the District of Columbia.
   Officials evacuated 18 to 20 residents of one apartment complex
in Chapel Hill, N.C., when a nearby creek rose out of its banks.
   Law enforcement officials in Granville County, N.C., said some
secondary roads washed out after an estimated 3 to 3.5 inches of
rain fell in six hours.
   In Durham, a police officer reported seeing a funnel cloud touch
down and a 50-foot section of a concrete storage building was
destroyed, authorities said. The National Weather Service said a
tornado had not been confirmed.
   On the North Carolina coast, a waterspout was reported in Pamlico
Sound between Hatteras and Ocracoke islands. Also, a thunderstorm at
the Alligator River Bridge caused wind gusts of up to 50 mph, the
weather service said.
   High water closed four rural highways in central Perry County,
Pa., authorities said.
   Storms dumped around 5 inches of rain at Madison, Va., about 4.25
inches at Kinsale, Va., 3.80 at Whalleysville, Md., and 3.06 at
Hollywood, Md. Patuxent River, Md., picked up 3.97 inches in four
hours.
   Landisburg, Pa., got 4.25 inches of rain and 3.30 inches of rain
was reported at Blain, Pa., while 4.20 inches fell in Cumberland
County in central Virginia.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms spread from southern
Mississippi into South Carolina and covered much of Florida.
Apalachicola, Fla., got 1.79 inches of rain in the six hours up to 2
p.m. EDT.

   An American rabbi and four students
wearing concentration camp uniforms protested Sunday on the grounds
of a Roman Catholic convent near the Auschwitz death camp and
demanded that the nuns leave.
   It was the second such protest by the group in three days. On
Friday, convent workers dragged the demonstrators off the grounds.
   ``Jews have a right to walk anywhere in Auschwitz!'' shouted
Rabbi Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of New York. ``Get out
of Auschwitz! The blood of our brothers and sisters cries out for
justice!''
   The four-hour protest ended peacefully when the group climbed
back over the 7-foot-high fence they had scaled to enter the
grounds. About 50 Poles looking on clapped and cheered.
   ``When we return, it will be in the tens, hundreds, thousands. We
want Christian-Jewish dialogue, but it can't be fostered as long as
the convent is here,'' Weiss said.
   Earlier Sunday, the men delivered a protest letter to the
residence of Cardinal Franciszek Macharski in nearby Krakow. They
also protested peacefully outside a Krakow church, donning prayer
shawls and singing in Hebrew as Mass was conducted inside.
   Under an agreement signed by 18 international Catholic and Jewish
leaders, Macharski was to have moved the nuns from their living
quarters _ a former Nazi warehouse a few feet from the barbed wire
fence of Auschwitz. An estimated 4 million people, including 2.5
million Jews, died at the concentration camp from 1940 to 1945.
   But a Feb. 22 deadline for moving the convent passed, and Jewish
leaders have continued to protest the convent, saying it is deeply
offensive to them.
   On Friday, Weiss and six students spent five hours on the convent
grounds before workers dragged them out.
   Weiss said his group planned to go to Warsaw to deliver a letter
to Polish Primate Jozef Glemp. He also said they would march on
Parliament on Monday and return to the convent with more supporters
this weekend.
   Several dozen Jewish tourists from Canada joined the protest from
outside the gates Sunday, singing in Hebrew with the men on the
convent veranda.
   ``The Holocaust is uniquely Jewish,'' said one, who identified
himself only as Rabbi Zeitz. ``We consider the convent on this
ground as an abomination, a desecration.''
   Five people who had been let into the convent by the nuns shortly
before the protest began could be seen laughing from a second-floor
window.
   A police car passed by and plainclothes police watched from
across the street. An earlier, smaller gathering of about a dozen
Poles also stood by, among them an elderly woman who yelled ``Juden
raus'' or ``Jews get out'' in German.
   The Poles watching said they could not understand objections to
the convent.
   Poland is a predominantly Roman Catholic country.
   The cloister, founded in 1984, is a few feet from the barbed wire
fence and guard towers of the death camp. The convent lawn, with a
23-foot wooden cross in the middle, is a former gravel pit where
prisoners were gunned down by Nazi executioners in 1940 and 1941.
   Reports in the state-run Polish press have made no mention of the
protesters being dragged out Friday.
   The government newspaper Rzeczpospolita described the protest as
``denominational fanaticism,'' said the nuns were terrified and
implied they were trapped inside.
   Macharski reportedly was on vacation. Telephone calls to his
residence and office were not answered.
   The protesters unfurled American and Israeli flags on the convent
veranda and put on concentration camp shirts with the yellow stars
that Jews were forced to wear while targets of Hitler's ``Final
Solution.''
   ``We have returned to this place just 48 hours after being beaten
as a statement that the Jews will never bow to the church. Auschwitz
is ours,'' Weiss said.
   He knocked on the convent door, but no one came out.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Looking at Matamoros Drug Cult Link to Chicago Mob</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents are investigating
suspected links between syndicated crime bosses in Chicago and a
cult-influenced drug ring blamed for 15 slayings near Matamoros,
Mexico, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Charles Harrison, agent in charge of the U.S. Customs regional
office in Houston, confirmed his agency is investigating a
relationship between Chicago mobsters and suspects in the Matamoros
drug and killings case, The Brownsville Herald reported.
   ``We can acknowledge we are looking into a relationship, but I
really can't go into any details,'' Harrison said. ``It's an ongoing
investigation.''
   Agents are looking into a possible narcotics and money laundering
enterprise involving the cult figures, the Chicago-based syndicate
and Manuel ``Poncho'' Jaramillo, who lives in Mission, Texas, the
newspaper reported, citing court transcripts, indictments,
affidavits and police records filed in drug and racketeering cases
from south Texas to Illinois.
   Jaramillo's associates include Albert Caesar Tocco, a reputed
Chicago mob boss arrested in January by FBI agents and charged in a
48-count federal racketeering indictment, the Herald reported.
   Other Jaramillo associates include members of the Matamoros-based
Hernandez family, which Mexican and U.S. agents believe was central
to a gruesome cult accused of slaying 15 people, according to
federal investigators. Some of the victims were sacrificed in
rituals intended to protect a narcotics ring, police said.
   Dennis Yates, a Houston attorney representing Jaramillo, called
drug and racketeering allegations against his client ``harassment.''
   ``Those accusations, as far as we're concerned, are absolutely
untrue,'' Yates said. ``They aren't substantiated, they have not
been substantiated and they never will be substantiated.''
   Mexican Federal Judicial Police arrested Serafin Hernandez
Garcia, 22, and his uncle, Elio Hernandez Rivera, 22, during an
April 9 drug raid at the family's ranch close to the Rio Grande near
Matamoros. There, they found the remnants of the ritual slayings and
unearthed 13 bodies.
   Police later found another two victims on a nearby ranch.
   Police have said the narcotics ring smuggled tons of marijuana
and cocaine into the United States.
   A principal figure in the Texas-Chicago investigation is Michael
Habiniak, 37, of Harlingen, the Herald reported. Habiniak was
convicted Jan. 11 in Corpus Christi on federal charges of conspiracy
and possession with intent to distribute marijuana on board a U.S.
vessel under American jurisdiction.
   Customs agents on Aug. 20, 1988, arrested Habiniak on a boat in
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and confiscated 597 pounds of
marijuana.
   A government motion filed in Habiniak's case alleged ``a criminal
enterprise connection between some of (Habiniak's) associates in the
Rio Grande Valley and in Chicago, Illinois, with Albert Caesar Tocco
of the Accardo organized crime family.''
   An investigation by the customs office in Corpus Christi revealed
Habiniak was a business partner of Ramona A. Jaramillo, Manuel
Jaramillo's wife at the time, in a Texas-based corporation named La
Esperanza Mining Co.

<HEAD>Japan Denies Being Villain As Leaders Urge Environmental Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan made a fervant pitch to escape being cast as
the villain of the environment Sunday as it joined the world's seven
richest nations in urging action to save the threatened earth.
   Leaders ending a three-day summit called for stronger steps to
save rainforests, the atmosphere, and the seas, lakes and rivers,
saying species were endangered and societies threatened by damage.
   The environment must win a higher place on the agenda of economic
decision-makers, they said at the conclusion of the first summit
that gave such priority to environmental issues.
   Defending Japan, spokesman Taizo Watanabe angrily attacked
criticism of his country's record on the environment, telling
reporters that Japan was not guiltless but was trying to change.
   While credited with cleaning up its own pollution, Japan has been
viewed as a black sheep among nations environmentally for its
reluctance to give up whale hunting and its prodigious use of
tropical rainforest products and chlorofluorocarbons that destroy
the earth's protective ozone layer.
   Recently, however, Japan has begun making changes, including
sharp increases in spending to protect the environment.
   The fact that Japanese officials devoted a news conference solely
to environmental issues spoke of the country's new emphasis.
   Another sign was the $2.25 billion in environmental-related aid
to developing nations that Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno
unveiled before the meeting.
   ``I resent very much this kind of perception that Japan must be
the villain in destroying the precious environment,'' Watanabe said.
``Japan is behind no nation in its concern for the environment.''
   Watanabe acknowledged that Japan is the largest importer of wood
from the threatened rainforests but said ``that is something we
would like to cope with by extending cooperation with the
International Tropical Timber Organization, which is concerned with
preserving forests and planting new trees.''
   In their final statement, the seven summit nations targeted the
depletion of the atmospheric ozone layer, global warming,
deforestation, and acid rain.
   ``Decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect
the earth's ecological balance,'' they said, pledging to work
together to preserve the environment.
   ``Environmental considerations must be taken into account in
economic decision-making,'' said the statement, urging the World
Bank and development banks to ``integrate environmental
considerations into their activities.''
   The summit nations called for:
   _More scientific research on environmental issues and improved
technology to reduce pollution.
   _Development of substitutes for chloroflurocarbons and joint
efforts to limit carbon dioxide emissions.
   _Promotion of energy efficiency and tougher safety standards for
nuclear power plants.

<HEAD>Israel to Reopen Many Schools in West Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel said Sunday it will allow nearly half the
1,200 schools closed for most of the 19-month Palestinian uprising
to reopen this week, but hinted they would be closed again if
students join protests.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir failed in an effort to hold a
Cabinet vote that he had hoped would bolster the credibility of his
peace initiative.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Palestinian assailants beat and
stabbed to death an Arab man, apparently for collaborating with
Israeli authorities, Arab reports said.
   His death raised to 565 the number of Palestinians killed in the
uprising against Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank. Most died of army gunfire, but at least 70 were killed by
Palestinians who suspected them of cooperating with Israel. In
addition, 36 Israelis have been killed.
   In the occupied territories, four Arabs were wounded by army
gunfire Sunday, Arab hospital officials said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said elementary schools and
12th-grade classes in the Gaza Strip and West Bank will be allowed
to reopen Saturday.
   Twelfth-grade was included to help high school students graduate.
Grades seven to 11 are to reopen in coming weeks. Colleges remain
closed.
   Israel radio said, however, that security officials were worried
that activists of the fundamentalist group Hamas may force children
to boycott classes.
   Israeli officials said they closed schools because they consider
them hotbeds of nationalist violence.
   Israel radio said authorities were under strong pressure from the
United States and European countries to reopen them. The U.N. Relief
and Works Association said West Bank schools have been open only 40
days in the current academic year.
   ``We hope these schools ... stay open so that Palestinian
children do not suffer any further harm from the suspension of the
learning process,'' the agency's commissioner-general, Giorgio
Giacomelli, said in a statement issued earlier this week from his
headquarters in Vienna.
   Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank's military
administration, told Palestinian students not to demonstrate when
the schools open. ``Remove studies from the cycle of violence and
take every opportunity to learn,'' he said.
   ``We will not agree in any way to violence, we will not agree in
any way to anything but studies,'' Erez said, speaking on Israel
television's Arabic language news service. ``This is a one-time
opportunity.''
   He met Sunday with principals of West Bank schools and urged them
to warn students not to hold political demonstrations in or near
schools.
   Erez said almost half the West Bank's 220,000 students will begin
studies Saturday.
   ``It's our right to have an education,'' said Mustafa Natche,
former mayor of the West Bank town of Hebron. ``It was a violation
of our human rights to close the schools, so we are happy they are
to reopen.''
   At Israel's weekly Cabinet meeting, Shimon Peres, leader of the
left-of-center Labor Party and vice prime minister, blocked efforts
to end a crisis that began earlier this month when Shamir's
right-wing Likud block set conditions for a government peace plan.
   Shamir tried to call a Cabinet vote to stipulate that the party's
conditions did not change the initial peace plan. But Peres and
other Labor Party members blocked the vote, and the meeting ended
with no decision.
   Peres wants a clear statement from the government that the Likud
conditions are not part of the plan. But he said a compromise may
still be reached that would cancel his party's threat to pull out of
the coalition and topple the government.
   Shamir's plan calls for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to elect representatives to negotiate peace with Israel.
Likud's hard-line conditions say, however, that the uprising must
end before any elections are held, and Israeli-annexed Arab east
Jerusalem will be excluded from voting.
   In comments Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
Secretary of State James A. Baker said the Bush administration
believes the Shamir plan stands as originally announced, despite
Shamir's separate agreement with his party's hard-liners.
   ``We are now convinced by having talked to ... representatives of
the Israeli government that they are fully supportive of their
original elections proposal and initiative as they originally
announced it, and we are going to continue ... to work very hard to
make it happen,'' Baker said.
   In Jerusalem, the director-general of the Prime Ministry, Yossi
Ben Aharon, said the United States must decide between its support
for the peace initiative and the dialogue it began with the PLO last
December.
   ``The two are mutually incompatible,'' Ben Aharon told The
Associated Press.
   In another development, the Haaretz newspaper said the army plans
to build new prison camps and enlarge existing ones to house
Palestinians detained, arrested or convicted of nationalist crimes,
such as belonging to the Palestine Liberation Organization or
attacking Israelis.
   Haaretz said the army plans to have camps to house up to 20,000
prisoners by 1990.
   A military spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would
not confirm the report, but said the army now houses 8,633
Palestinian prisoners.

   A moderate earthquake hit Alaska early
Sunday, but no significant damage was reported, authorities said.
   The quake measured 4.6 on the Richter scale, and its epicenter
struck 20 miles north of Palmer, or 60 miles northeast of Anchorage,
said Bill Zitek, a geophysicist at the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.
   The earthquake hit at 6:09 a.m., Zitek said, and was ``sharply
felt'' in Palmer.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in a local area, 4 can cause moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
and 6 can be severe. A 7 reading is a ``major'' quake, capable of
widespread heavy damage.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. George Stallings Jr. on Sunday
rejected a unity appeal by black Roman Catholic bishops and went
ahead with services for what he says is a brand of Catholicism that
better serves blacks.
   Stallings, who is black, held a pair of celebrations for his
Imani Temple, and about 2,500 persons attended. Imani is Swahili for
``faith.''
   After the first such services on July 2, Stallings was suspended
by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. That means that
Stallings is not sanctioned by the church to say Mass in either
public or private and no longer has church authority to perform
sacraments.
   Stallings accuses the church of being racist and of failing its
black parishioners. He wants to form an African-American Catholic
Rite, which he says would still be part of the Catholic Church.
   Last week, 13 black bishops asked Stallings to abandon his
movement. In a statement, they said, ``we sincerely hope (Stallings'
followers) are not commingling personal disappointment, individually
felt frustrations, and personal anger under the banner of racism.
Racism is a sin which the church must address. It is too serious an
issue to be used as a cover for selfish concerns.''
   But Stallings rejected that appeal, telling his audience, ``I
don't have anything against white folks, but one thing about white
folks is they stick together. You wouldn't have 13 of them coming
out and writing a letter.''
   Stallings said he is following God's direction, ``and God didn't
tell me what bishop I should be listening to.''
   The clapping congregation joined Stallings as he chanted,
``enough is enough is enough.''

<HEAD>Discoverer of Cave Painting Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jacques Marsal, who discovered the famed
prehistoric paintings of the Lascaux cave with three young friends
in 1940 and became the cave's guardian for life, has died. He was 63.
   Marsal died Saturday in a Bordeaux hospital after a long illness,
his family said. The cause of death was not disclosed.
   On Sept. 12, 1940, the 14-year-old Marsal was playing in an oak
forest outside the village of Lascaux, along with a neighbor and two
12-year-old Parisians who had fled to the region 300 miles south of
Paris at the outbreak of World War II.
   Their dog disappeared into a hole and began barking furiously,
and the boys attached Marsal's neighbor to a rope and lowered him
down. When they lifted him out, he was filthy and shaken, and
claimed to have seen ghosts.
   The other boys were skeptical and they returned the next day to
explore. They found a vast cave whose walls were decorated with
colorful paintings of leaping stags, buffalo and prehistoric horses.
   Archaeologists determined the paintings dated from about 14,000
B.C. The artwork drew visitors from around the world until 1963,
when it was determined that carbon dioxide in their breath was
harming the paintings.
   Marsal was a guide at the cave when it was open to the public,
and he became its guardian after it closed. He lived at the site and
escorted chiefs of state and other distinguished visitors on special
tours.
   A replica of the cave, built nearby, opened in 1983.
   Funeral services were planned for Monday in nearby Montignac. The
family did not release details of survivors.

   The Bush administration will increase the
supply of arms to resistance fighters in Afghanistan as a response
to an increase in Soviet military shipments to the Kabul government,
the Washington Post reported Sunday.
   The new weapons will give the guerrillas the ability to destroy
government airfields and aircraft, the newspaper said, quoting
unnamed administration officials.
   The decision was made after the Soviets increased military
shipments following the final withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan on Feb. 15, the Post said.
   Fifteen months ago, both superpowers agreed to end outside
interference in Afghanistan.
   Since the Soviet withdrawal, the Soviets are sending $200 million
to $300 million worth of arms monthly to Kabul, the Post quoted U.S.
officials as saying.
   Some Soviet-Afghan aerial tactics have changed and now involve
the use of high-flying planes to attack rebel positions. The higher
flights mean the attackers are outside the range of the
U.S.-supplied Stinger anti-aircraft missiles used by the guerrillas.

<HEAD>State Seeks to Tax Drinks on Airlines Passing Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's attempt to collect sales tax on
drinks sold on aircraft flying over the state is more than one
airline wants to swallow.
   Northwest Airlines, which merged with Republic Airlines in 1986,
is fighting an assessment against Republic for drink taxes between
1981 and 1984.
   In a case in Dane County Circuit Court, the Wisconsin Revenue
Department contends that airlines must pay the state's 5 percent
sale tax on items sold aboard planes flying over the state or the
western half of Lake Michigan. Wisconsin's boundary extends to the
middle of the lake, the state argues.
   At stake is the state's claim that Northwest owes almost $69,000
in sales and use taxes on liquor, soda and peanuts sold or given
away on flights that passed over but did not land in Wisconsin.
   The figure was computed by applying the percentage of the
airline's passenger miles in Wisconsin to its systemwide liquor
sales. In addition, the state is claiming more than $21,000 in
interest.
   Northwest is not contesting the state's right to tax airborne
liquor sales on planes that land in Wisconsin, but is contesting
Wisconsin's assessment of the tax on flights that merely pass over
Wisconsin, said attorney Frederic J. Brouner, who is representing
Northwest.
   If Wisconsin wins, the state presumably could impose the tax on
sales aboard transcontinental flights of airlines that didn't even
serve Wisconsin, said James L. Greenwald, a revenue department
lawyer.
   The Wisconsin case may be the first in the nation testing a
state's attempt to tax liquor sales in the air, said Brouner.
   ``We've looked pretty carefully, and this is the only case of its
type we're aware of in the United States,'' Brouner said.
   A spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the national trade
organization of major airlines, agreed.
   State taxation of sales on overflights ``is not a widespread
phenomenon, I can tell you that,'' said an official in the
association's Washington office who asked not to be identified.
   The state won a preliminary victory earlier this year when the
Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission upheld the high-flying tax.
Northwest appealed the decision in circuit court.
   However, the commission denied the state's claim to a 5 percent
use tax on peanuts given away to passengers. Peanuts are food and
thus are exempt from the tax, the commission ruled. The revenue
department is appealing that part of the decision.

<HEAD>First Word Spoken on Moon Was One Giant Leap for Houston</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Apollo Anniversary, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As millions watched and listened to man's first
landing on the moon, the first word they heard helped change this
city forever.
   ``Houston ... The Eagle has landed.''
   That was one small step for man, one giant leap for a
little-recognized regional city with big aspirations in 1969.
   ``Wherever I've gone in the world since the moon landing,'' says
former Mayor Louie Welch, ``when I say I'm from Houston, I don't
need to say Texas or U.S.A. Houston has become a world city.''
   International recognition represents only part of the benefit the
Houston area has reaped from having NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center
_ now the Johnson Space Center.
   The center also has given the area's economy a tremendous
infusion of money and jobs, as well as enhancing the city's social
growth.
   When Houston was designated as the site for the space center in
September 1961, federal officials said its selection over 20 other
cities rested on such factors as availability of scientists at local
and state universities, Houston's industrial base and skilled work
force and an ideal site on 1,023 acres donated by Rice University.
   But local and state officials acknowledged the key factor was the
political clout of former U.S. Rep. Albert Thomas, backed by Vice
President Lyndon Johnson, both Texans.
   Sociologist Stephen Klineberg of Rice University said the space
program gives Houston ``a sense of the future and puts it at the
center of the breakout into space, the great human adventure of the
21st century.''
   Being at the forefront of space technology provides one key to
Houston's emergence ``at the end of the old era of an oil-based
economy and easy economic growth into the global economy of the
information age,'' Klineberg said.
   Walt Cunningham, an Apollo astronaut, describes the effect of the
moon landing: ``If the whole world sees it as an accomplishment for
mankind, if Americans see it as a national accomplishment, think how
focused it becomes down here where it's in our back yard.''
   Economist Robert Hodgin of the University of Houston-Clear Lake,
an expert on the space station's impact on the Houston area's
economy, says benefits have gone well beyond identity and pride.
   For the past three years, he said, the Johnson Space Center has
annually generated $850 million to $950 million in business
expenditures in the area, including the space center, the 65 local
aerospace contractors and ancillary businesses.
   The space program is producing about 27,400 jobs in the Houston
area, Hodgin said, including about 3,400 jobs at the space center.

<HEAD>City Council Restores Cable Channel, Will Allow KKK To Broadcast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite angry protests by black and
inner-city leaders, the City Council voted to restore a public cable
channel that will allow the Ku Klux Klan to broadcast on the channel.
   The council had eliminated the channel in June 1988 as a way of
keeping the Klan off the public access channel of American
Cablevision. They backed down in light of a First Amendment lawsuit
filed against the city by the American Civil Liberties Union.
   The council voted 7-3 in favor of the measure Thursday night.
Three members were absent. Before the vote, the city's lawyers said
they thought the city would lose the case, which was scheduled to go
to trial in September.
   ``If there is a victory today, it is a victory for the First
Amendment,'' said Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the ACLU of
Kansas and Western Missouri.
   The ACLU lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, asked that the
public access channel be re-established so that the Klan could
broadcast a white supremacist program called ``Klansas City.''
   Local governments typically require cable companies to have
public access channels before before granting them operating
licenses.
   For nearly half an hour during the meeting, more than a dozen
inner-city leaders and residents filled the council chambers with
civil rights songs, interrupting the proceedings.
   The Rev. Mac Charles Jones told the council that allowing the
Klan on cable television would represent a grave setback for race
relations in Kansas City.
   ``Whatever trust has been built up will have been lost,'' Jones
said. ``Don't betray us as people, as a community, as a city.''

<TEXT>
   Government officials said a Soviet nuclear
submarine apparently caught fire off Norway's coast Sunday and was
under tow, but Soviet authorities reportedly said the incident was
just an exercise.
   A Norwegian research vessel reported that smoke was coming from
the sub's observation tower about 5 p.m. and that a Soviet tugboat
had been dispatched to help the vessel, said a Norwegian Defense
Ministry spokesman, Erik Senstad.
   Other Soviet naval vessels were in the area, in international
waters 75 miles off Norway's coast, and the submarine did not appear
to be in serious danger, the Norwegian Supreme Command said.
   The Command did not say whether it believed any sailors had been
injured.
   The Norwegian state television station NRK showed the submarine
sailing under its own power and reported no outward signs of an
accident.
   Soviet rescue officials said the submarine was only engaged in an
exercise and that the ship had never been in trouble, according to
NRK.
   However, Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg said at
a news conference: ``We have heard nothing official to indicate that
this was an exercise. And exercise or not, it would have made sense
to warn us.''
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry responded to a Norwegian request for
information by saying there had been no problems on Sunday aboard
any Soviet submarines off Norway, said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Oeyind Nordsletten.
   It was the third time in less than four months that a Soviet
nuclear-powered submarine has been involved in an incident off
Norway's coast.
   Norwegian authorities said that as in the previous cases, the
Soviets did not alert them Sunday.
   Norwegian officials said nothing about whether they believed the
submarine's nuclear reactors were damaged or whether the ship
carried nuclear weapons.
   The submarine was identified as an Alfa-class submarine, which is
powered by two nuclear reactors and capable of carrying
nuclear-tipped torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Soviet Embassy was
contacted to find out if there was any danger of radiation.
   The ship was spotted in the Barents Sea about 75 miles east of
the Norwegian town of Vardoe and north of the Kola Peninsula. The
ship was in international waters, 30 miles north of Soviet
territorial waters.
   Senstad said it was ``regrettable'' the Soviets had not issued a
warning to Norwegian authorities. ``I hope this is the last time
something like this happens without us being warned,'' he said in a
television interview.
   The Norwegian government said last week it was drafting a treaty
that would require the Soviet Union to inform Norway of military
accidents. The Soviets have similar agreements with the United
States, Britain, West Germany and France.
   Stoltenberg summoned the Soviet ambassador for a meeting late
Sunday, the national NTB news agency reported.
   On June 26, a fire broke out aboard a Soviet Echo II class vessel
that was sailing 70 miles off Norway's coast in the Norwegian Sea.
   Norwegian scientists later said small amounts of radiation leaked
from the sub and that its reactor may have come close to a meltdown.
   The Soviet news agency Tass first said four sailors from that sub
were hospitalized and were being examined for possible radiation
poisoning. But the news agency later said the four ``were healthy
and have no excess radiation.''
   Another accident involving a Soviet sub occurred April 7 when a
MIKE class nuclear sub sank in the Norwegian Sea, killing 42 Soviet
sailors.
   The accidents led to criticism within the Soviet Union about the
condition of the nation's submarine fleet and the training of its
officers.
   Ilya B. Kolton, a 30-year veteran aboard Soviet subs, blamed the
April and June accidents on ``construction deficiencies, imperfect
crew rescue equipment, plus the startling slowness and inertia of
the naval agencies in introducing new ideas.'' His remarks appeared
in the Communist Party youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   The Supreme Command said the ship involved Sunday was an
Alfa-class sub, which has two reactors cooled by liquid metal.
   Five such ships are known to be assigned to the Northern Fleet.
They usually are armed with torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles of
the type SS-N-15, the command said.
   ``Both types of weapons can carry nuclear warheads. In the West,
this 2,900-ton type of sub is considered to be very fast and can
move at great depths. It is assumed that the hull is made of
titanium,'' the command said.

   A hot air balloon struck a power line and erupted
in flames Sunday, killing one man and critically wounding another.
   The survivor was transported by helicopter to Hermann Hospital,
where he was listed in critical and unstable condition with
third-degree burns over 95 percent of his body, said hospital
spokeswoman Katherine Byard.
   The names of the victims were not immediately released pending
notification of relatives.
   Sheriff's investigators said the collision with the 40-foot power
line apparently severed the balloon from the wicker gondola,
possibly dislodging one or more propane burners.
   Leland Want, working at a construction site nearby, said he
pulled the survivor from the wreckage before it exploded.
   ``The other guy was still inside, where all the fire was inside
the basket, and there was some kind of propane tank on top of him,''
said Want. ``He wasn't moving or anything so I figured he was dead.''

   Musicians and fans around the world
mourned the death Sunday of conductor Herbert von Karajan, and even
a critic who denounced the maestro's membership in the Nazi Party
had some kind words.
   Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said the music world had lost
``one of its very greatest.''
   American singer Jessye Norman, in Paris for bicentennial
celebrations, said in a statement: ``Herbert von Karajan always
rolled out a magic carpet for us, the singers. It was enough for us
to take our place, and with him, our musical work took on another
dimension.''
   In West Berlin, where Karajan led the Berlin Philharmonic for 34
years, Mayor Walter Momper said his death Sunday left behind
``sadness and the wish to be able hear him make music again.''
   He said the celebrated conductor had been ``Berlin's musical
ambassador around the world.''
   Greek virtuoso pianist Dimitris Sgouros said: ``I express my
sincere sorrow for the loss of one of the greatest maestros and
musical geniuses of our century.
   ``We first worked together on Brahms' Second Concerto in 1982 and
cooperated almost annually since, in concert and on records. He was
indeed a great maestro.''
   American conductor Erich Leinsdorf, referring to Karajan's career
conducting the Berlin Philharmonic and his departure in April, said:
   ``I'm very, very sorry. I think he must have died from the
frustration of his recent experiences. He died a psychological
death.''
   Karajan died three months after leaving the Berlin Philharmonic
amid differences over his contract.
   He cited health reasons when he resigned. Karajan had long been
ill, and serious back pain made it difficult for him to walk unaided
to the podium.
   Leinsdorf, who first met Karajan in 1930 when he took a class
taught by the conductor in Salzburg, Austria, recalled Karajan as a
man who was ``very proud'' of his years with the Berlin orchestra.
   Horst Koepke, a music writer for the Frankfurter Rundschau
newspaper in Frankfurt, praised Karajan for his ability to ``prepare
an orchestral work so that it pleases not just a small circle'' of
knowledgeable people.
   But Koepke, often a critic of the conductor, pointed to what he
said was a darker side of Karajan.
   He suggested Karajan joined the Nazi Party during Hitler's reign
in Germany to further his career.
   Karajan was ``aware of his capabilities very early ... and was
determined to make a career,'' Koepke wrote in a Monday newspaper
commentary sent by facsimile machine in advance to the AP.
   Karajan himself once acknowledged he joined the Nazi Party to
avoid jeopardizing his career, but he said he had no political
sympathy for the Nazis.
   Koepke also criticized Karajan for his choice of music, saying he
usually offered a ``very limited'' concert program.
   ``Always Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and Richard Strauss, and
also sometimes Johann Strauss,'' Koepke said.
   West German music critics have long been sharply divided in their
views of Karajan.
   Many say he deserved his worldwide fame. But others have been
disturbed by his membership in the Nazi Party and his thirst for
publicity.
   ``He was a great musician and a great music teacher,'' Wolf von
Lewinski, a respected music critic who knew Karajan, told The
Associated Press from his home in Ludwigshafen.
   ``He was a brilliant conductor with a special sense for tone,''
Lewinski said.

   A memorial was unveiled Sunday to more
than 300 people killed nearly 45 years ago when huge explosions
rocked a Navy ammunition depot in one of World War II's worst
stateside disasters.
   The servicemen and civilians who died in the July 17, 1944, blast
at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine were remembered with a half-hour
service and the dedication of a simple marker containing a piece of
twisted metal from the disaster.
   ``I'm sorry for the men who died and their families, but I'm
pleased with the memorial because they didn't die exactly
forgotten,'' said 73-year-old Gordon Koller, who was a chief bosun's
mate at the base in 1944.
   Koller and two of the other four remaining survivors were among
200 people who took part in the service at the base, now called
Concord Naval Weapons Station, about 30 miles northeast of San
Francisco.
   The dead were honored with a color guard, a military band and a
wreath laid before the marker, which is part of a larger planned
memorial.
   The marker stands on the shore of Suisun Bay, where 10,000 tons
of ammunition exploded, killing 320 people and injuring another 390
up to 15 miles away. It consists of concrete slab bearing a granite
plaque, a yardarm and the piece of metal from a ship that was blown
apart in the disaster.
   The three blasts occurred as men loaded two cargo ships at the
magazine's Pier 1, destroying the pier and both the SS E.A. Bryan
and the SS Quinalt Victory and sinking a Coast Guard fire barge.
   The blast lit the sky for miles around and rattled windows as far
away as San Jose 35 miles to the south.
   Navy investigators never determined the cause of the blast, but
said a worker may have triggered it by dropping a depth charge.
   The dead included members of the Coast Guard, the U.S. Merchant
Marine, Navy and Marine Corps, as well as civil service employees
and civilians.
   The Navy Armed Guard Veterans' West Coast division held the first
memorial service at Port Chicago last year, and has since led a
drive for the memorial. About $5,000 has been raised so far,
according to Carl Winder of the veterans group.
   The memorial was suggested by the family of a blast victim after
they visited the site, and saw there was no marker other than the
stubs of the destroyed pier, said Capt. Lonnie F. Cagle, commanding
officer of the weapons station.
   The marker is in memory of Port Chicago as well as the 320 who
died, Cagle said. ``If ever a town deserved a Purple Heart, Port
Chicago did,'' he said.
   The town, which was two miles away from the pier, suffered
extensive damage from the blast.
   Port Chicago was ``wounded in action'' in 1944 and ``killed in
action during the Vietnam War,'' when the Navy bought the town and
razed it to create a safety zone, Cagle said.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India
said Sunday that regional stability lies in friendship, not military
strength, and called for an end to the longstanding conflict between
his nation and Pakistan.
   ``It falls upon us to silence the guns that have given no peace
and to seek the enduring solutions that only peaceful coexistence
can ensure,'' Gandhi said at a banquet held for his visit by Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   Since the predominately Moslem Pakistan was carved from
Hindu-dominated India in 1947, the two nations have gone to war
three times.
   Ms. Bhutto told a news conference earlier in the day that
Gandhi's visit was the first step in a long process toward
reconciliation.
   ``You know for a long journey, you have to take a first little
step and only then can you reach your destination,'' she said.
   At the banquet, Ms. Bhutto said: ``We should ensure that south
Asia remains free of nuclear weapons.''
   Tensions between the nations have been exacerbated in recent
years with reports that both countries have programs to make nuclear
weapons.
   Pakistan and India, which has successfully tested a nuclear
device, deny they are making nuclear arms but refuse to open their
facilities to international inspection.
   Gandhi, who was given a 19-gun salute upon his arrival earlier in
the day, met with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and later with Ms.
Bhutto.
   The substance of the talks between the prime ministers was not
disclosed, but one topic was believed to have been the 10-year war
in neighboring Afghanistan. Another was believed to have been the
disputed region of Kashmir.
   Ms. Bhutto and Gandhi are to hold a joint news conference Monday
morning before Gandhi's return to India.
   Eleven political parties from Kashmir organized a protest march
in the nearby city of Rawalpindi to coincide with Gandhi's arrival.
   ``We want a unified Kashmir whether it is part of Pakistan or an
independent state,'' said Sultan Mahmood Chowdry of the Azad Moslem
Conference.
   Indian and Pakistani troops face each other from outposts at the
disputed northern end of Kashmir in the Himalayan Mountains.
   Chowdry said Kashmir residents want to put into effect a 1949
U.N. resolution calling for a plebiscite on the future of region.
   Gandhi arrived in Pakistan from a visit to Moscow, the major
backer of the communist government in Afghanistan. Pakistan and the
United States are the main supporters of the Afghan guerrillas.
   Pakistan wants a political settlement that excludes the current
rulers in Kabul.

   A minor mechanical problem that stalled
the maiden flight of the B-2 stealth bomber was repaired by Sunday
and Air Force officials were preparing the craft for another
attempted takeoff Monday morning.
   An Air Force spokesman said only that the problem was located in
a device called the heat exchanger in the fuel system of the bomber.
   ``I had our technical people try to explain it to me and it went
right over my head,'' said Air Force Col. Doug Kennett.
   Officials at Northrop Corp., builder of the controversial plane,
were unavailable for comment.
   A low fuel pressure reading aborted the scheduled Saturday
morning flight as the radar-evading bomber revved its engines
awaiting clearance for takeoff from Air Force Plant 42.
   After the flight was called off, workers began checking out the
bat-winged aircraft, which is already 18 months behind schedule and,
at a budgeted price of $500 million each, the most expensive plane
in history.
   The fuel problem was fixed, and officials were preparing the
radar-evading bomber for a Monday morning takeoff from Plant 42,
with a landing at nearby Edwards Air Force Base, said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jerry Fergeson.
   Plant 42, in the Mojave Desert 40 miles north of downtown Los
Angeles, is the Air Force's primary research and development
facility.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, approving President Bush's
$305.5 billion defense-spending request for fiscal 1990, stipulated
Friday that no new money be spent on the B-2 until it flies. The
Pentagon is seeking $8 billion for the bomber in the coming fiscal
year.
   ``If that plane doesn't fly, the debate is over,'' Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said Friday. ``It is far too expensive
to be a stealth taxi.''
   The government has invested about $22.4 billion in the bomber so
far.
   The aircraft, Northrop and Air Force officials say, is the most
thoroughly tested in history without having been flown. It has
undergone years of hangar testing in computer flight simulations.
However, it is not unusual for problems to materialize when an
airplane is ready for flight.
   The cost of each of the 132 bombers sought by the Air Force is
more than $500 million over the life of the program.
   The Air Force and Northrop estimate that the production cost of
the stealth bomber in 1989 dollars, not adjusted for future
inflation, to be about $274 million apiece.
   So-called stealth technology combines advanced materials and a
special shape to create a plane that will not show up on enemy
radar. Though the bomber is still in the development stage, stealth
fighters have been in operation for several years.

   Abortion rights advocates gain a platform on
national television this week when their friend and supporter Ted
Turner broadcasts their pro-choice video on his SuperStation TBS.
   Turner is not shy about his pro-choice agenda. Last week he
called abortion foes ``idiots'' and ``Bozos,'' predictably raising
the ire of pro-lifers and drawing attention to the coming broadcast.
   ``Abortion: For Survival,'' produced for the Fund for the
Feminist Majority, is a half-hour program that frames abortion as an
issue of public health, family planning, population control and
women's rights. It focuses on the effect of U.S. abortion policies
not just on American women but on women in other countries as well.
   The program will be aired on Turner's TBS channel Thursday night,
again next Saturday afternoon and on Sunday morning. It will be
followed by a one-hour studio debate moderated by journalist Martin
Agronsky. On the panel will be two pro-choice activists and two
abortion foes.
   Jennifer Cole, a spokeswoman for the National Right to Life
Committee, called Turner's decision to air the pro-choice program
but not a pro-life film ``very irresponsible journalism.''
   Right-to-life groups want Turner to balance his broadcast by
showing ``Eclipse of Reason,'' a film showing the results of a
24-week abortion.
   That film and its precursor, the better known ``Silent Scream,''
which uses a sonogram to show a fetus being abbrted, have been aired
by local and regional cable TV systems in various parts of the
country.
   In September 1985 ``Silent Scream'' had a national audience as
part of a three-hour Public Broadcasting Service program that
included a trilogy of advocacy films for and against abortion.
   ``Abortion: For Survival'' was unveiled in April, in time for a
pro-choice march that brought several hundred thousand demonstrators
to the nation's Capitol to protest Bush administration efforts to
overturn Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing
abortion.
   The court's ruling earlier this month giving states broad powers
to restrict abortions has mobilized forces on both sides of the
issue and kept the issue on front pages of newspapers across the
country.
   The pro-choice film takes a straightforward look at abortion as a
medical procedure, beginning with the taping of an actual abortion.
The woman is 6 weeks pregnant and the abortion takes one-minute, 24
seconds.
   ``To lawmakers, I would like to say that there are hundreds of
thousands of women whose lives are being affected. It's not a
political thing, it's not a philosophical thing. It's women's
lives,'' the woman says when the procedure is completed.
   The video, hosted by actress Christina Pickles, attempts to
debunk the ``myth'' she says is perpetuated by pro-lifers that many
abortions are performed late in term. She says 91 percent of
abortions on American women are performed before the 12th week, 8
percent in the second trimester and 1 percent in the third.
   In one segment, the contents of a uterus emptied of an 8-week old
fetus are displayed: an unrecognizable mass of red tissue.
   The video also depicts the effects of U.S. abortion policy
overseas, where governments fearful of losing U.S. family planning
funds won't offer women information on birth control or abortion.
   By reducing contraception opportunities, these women are risking
illegal abortions and many are dying, according to the medical and
public health experts on the program.
   They espouse a common theme: Without access to legal abortions,
women will die from illegal abortions. In one sequence, physicians
recall women they treated for infections incurred from botched
illegal abortions before the 1973 Supreme Court decision.
   ``The lesson is very simple: If you legalize abortion, the
nation's health improves. If you restrict abortion, the nation's
health suffers,'' David Grimes, a professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at the University of Southern California.

<TEXT>
   A retired KGB colonel said in a memoir published
Sunday that he regretted taking part in his agency's suppression of
dissidents and urged security workers to abandon such practices.
   In an article in the weekly Ogonyok, Col. Ya. Karpovich said he
sought to fill what he called the ``black holes'' in the history of
the KGB, the Soviet secret police and intelligence agency.
   ``These black holes are connected with the tragedy of our
people,'' Karpovich wrote.
   ``The most important thing is to be united in the struggle to
cleanse the organs of government security ... And it is important
for all the workers of the organs of state security to realize that
they must say a definitive `No!'' to the past,'' he said.
   The list of scientists, poets and writers Karpovich said the KGB
unjustly suppressed read like a Who's Who of the 1970's dissident
movement: Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov, Yevgenia
Ginzburg, Vasily Aksyonov, Giorgi Vladimov, Pyotr Grigorenko, Josef
Brodsky, Mikhail Chemyakine, Vladimir Voinovich, Dmitri Dudko, Gleb
Yakunov and Ernst Neizvestny.
   Many have been rehabilitated under Gorbachev and several who were
exiled abroad have returned to the Soviet Union on visits.
   ``Was this really a job for Soviet organs of state security?''
asked Karpovich.
   ``Sakharov's `Thoughts' appeared (in the West). This deserved ...
an effort by the authorities to engage in a well-meaning dialogue.
No! Exile,'' Karpovich wrote, referring to Sakharov's exile without
trial to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980.
   ``And there's one more international disgrace: the psychiatric
internment of normal people,'' he wrote in detailing the case of a
retired general who was placed in a psychiatric hospital because of
his dissident views.
   Publication of the article followed an extraordinary session of
the Soviet legislature on Friday at which lawmakers questioned KGB
chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov. He was subsequently confirmed in the
post he has held since last fall.
   It was the first time a KGB chief faced a public accounting.
   The Ogonyok article and a lengthy report Sunday in the newspaper
Sovietskaya Rossiya that detailed the legislative session were steps
toward opening one of the Soviet Union's most secretive areas.
   Until now, little has been disclosed about the KGB, despite the
political and economic reforms of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Karpovich said that after working as an investigator in a
prosecutor's office for five years, he joined the KGB in 1955, three
years after the death of dictator Josef Stalin.
   He spent the next three years reviewing the 1937-52 period,
apparently helping to reverse the convictions of millions of Soviets
imprisoned under Stalin and released after his death.
   Karpovich said he then began to investigate what he called
``current cases.''

   A torrent of water washed away a bus
stranded on a causeway spanning a flooded river in southern India on
Sunday, and at least 20 passengers were feared drowned, news reports
said.
   The bus had stalled and was swept away in the river, located
about 990 miles south of New Delhi in the Andhra Pradesh state, the
Press Trust of India news agency said.
   About 12 passengers swam to safety as the bus started to sink,
the news agency said quoting officials.
   The bus was diverted to the causeway because a bridge on its
regular route had been washed away, United News of India news agency
said.
   The state-owned bus was traveling from Hyderabad, the state
capital, to Deverkonda, a provincial town 125 miles to the south.
   Several southern and eastern Indian states have had heavy rains
with the onset of the monsoon last week.

   The Mormon Tabernacle Choir on Sunday
marked the 60th anniversary of its live radio program with a show
that included videotaped praises from President Bush and former
President Ronald Reagan.
   With 3,126 broadcasts, ``Music and the Spoken Word'' is the
longest-running program on American radio.
   The 325-voice choir performed at the inaugurations of both Reagan
and Bush, who called the choir ``one of the world's greatest
treasures.''
   ``For six decades the choir has been heard around the world
opening hearts. ... It's the the choir that marks a special day,''
Bush said in his broadcast message.
   Reagan said, ``No one sings the anthems of America like the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir.''
   After the former president's remarks, the choir performed the
arrangement of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' that was sung
during Reagan's 1980 inaugural parade.
   The choir also sang popular tunes such as ``You'll Never Walk
Alone'' and ``The Sound of Music.'' On the classical side, it
performed the Hallelujah Chorus of Handel's ``The Messiah.''
   Except when the choir is on tour, ``Music and the Spoken Word''
is broadcast live from the Tabernacle on Temple Square in downtown
Salt Lake City.
   The program is carried by about 400 domestic stations, in Europe
on Armed Forces Radio Network and in a dozen nations with
English-speaking programs. The choir also is seen on scores of
syndicated telecasts.
   NBC carried the program from 1929 to 1932, when Utah's KSL Radio
switched to CBS Radio. Since then, CBS has provided the program to
its affiliates as a public service.
   Nancy Whitman, president of the CBS Radio Network, said the
broadcasts have reflected many of the major historical events of the
20th century. In 1934 a special performance was broadcast to
explorer Rear Admiral Richard Byrd at the South Pole. In 1942
shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, a performance was
dedicated to Americans in the Hawaiian Islands, she said.
   ``I believe we helped thaw the Cold War a little bit with our
broadcasts behind the Iron Curtain,'' Whitman said.
   The choir was created in 1847 only months after Mormon pioneers,
led by Brigham Young, settled in the Salt Lake Valley.
   Choir members must be active in the 6.7 million-member Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As with the faith's lay clergy,
choir service is considered a ``calling.''

   Opposition leaders met with government
delegates Sunday to try to end a political crisis over the
leadership of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Mediated by diplomats from the Organization of American States,
the meeting was the first time the military, which had vowed not to
talk with the civilian opposition, sat down to listen to its demands.
   The opposition is calling for the ouster of Noriega, who as head
of the Panamanian Defense Forces is the country's de facto leader. A
1{-year political crisis over Noriega's leadership worsened after he
annulled the May 7 presidential election.
   International observers said Noriega rigged the election and had
it annulled when it became apparent that opposition candidate
Guillermo Endara had won.
   Noriega has refused to step down, saying his position was ``not
negotiable.''
   Participants gave no details of what was discussed at Sunday's
talks.
   ``There was no debate. Each side expressed its points of view in
all frankness,'' Endara said after the three-hour session at the
offices of the Organization of American States. ``I am optimistic.''
   Another opposition source said there was tension at the start of
the meeting but that the atmosphere became more relaxed. The source,
who asked not to be identified, did not elaborate.
   A second session was scheduled for Monday morning.
   Before Sunday's session, Endara, who led the opposition
delegation, had said, ``We come here in good faith. If there is any
reciprocity, we might finally have a united, reconciled Panama.''
   Three high-ranking officers of the Defense Forces who attended
the meeting declined to comment. Noriega did not attend.
   Carlos Duque, the government candidate in the annulled elections,
avoided reporters after the meeting.
   Before it began, he said: ``We hope to start a dialogue to seek a
national agreement. We have no agenda for the meeting and no
preconditions.''
   Endara, of the Authentic Liberal Party, was accompanied by his
vice presidential candidates Ricardo Arias Calderon of the Christian
Democratic Party and Billy Ford of the Nationalist Liberal
Republican Movement.
   Duque attended the meeting as a representative of acting
President Manuel Solis Palma, whose term ends Sept. 1. Duque was
accompanied by vice presidential candidates Aguilino Boyd and Ramon
Sieiro of the ruling Revolutionary Democratic Party.
   Lt. Col. Julio Ow Young and Majs. Luis Cordoba and Armando
Palacios represented Noriega's Defense Forces. All three came
dressed in civilian clothes and refused to talk to journalists.
   Wives of military officers jailed by Noriega after an attempted
coup in March 1988 carried protest banners and gathered across from
the building where the talks were held.
   The Organization of American States has been trying to mediate a
solution to the election crisis since the Noriega-controlled
Elections Tribunal claimed there had been vote fraud and annulled
the May balloting.
   Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez of Ecuador led the diplomatic
mission to Sunday's talks. It also included foreign ministers Mario
Palencia of Guatemala and Sadeo Badseo of Trinidad-Tobago, as well
as OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares of Brazil.
   The United States has been trying to pressure Noriega to step
down since February 1988, when two federal grand juries in Florida
indicted the strongman on drug-trafficking and money-laundering
charges.
   Washington obtained a public condemnation of Noriega from the
OAS, which also blamed him for post-election violence, including
attacks on the opposition candidates.
   The U.S. government has frozen millions of dollars worth of
Panamanian assets in American banks, suspended payments _ including
tolls collected from the Panama Canal _ and refused to talk with any
government official while Noriega is in power.
   Former President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega soon
after the indictments, but the following day, Noriega had the
National Legislature fire the president instead. Solis Palma took
over from Delvalle.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as Panama's
legitimate president.

   An explosion and fire erupted aboard a
Panamanian tanker anchored near a city pier Sunday, seriously
burning two crewmen, the Coast Guard said.
   The fire aboard the Yamato Spirit was put out about 25 minutes
after it was reported around 1:50 p.m. by three Coast Guard boats, a
fire boat and a helicopter, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Chuck
Wullenjohn.
   The Yamato Spirit, which had 24 crewmembers on board, is owned by
Compania Naviera Rose SA of Panama, according to the Lloyd's

   The injured crewmen, whose names were not released, were taken to
San Francisco General Hospital.
   One was in critical condition with second- and third-degree burns
on his face, hands and feet, said a nursing supervisor at San
Francisco General Hospital who refused to give her name. The other
was in serious condition with second- and third-degree burns on his
hands and feet.
   The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office is investigating the cause
of the explosion.

   Security forces had rounded up people in
the Somali capital of Mogadishu following clashes with Moslem
worshipers that left 23 dead and 59 wounded, residents of the city
said Sunday.
   The residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they did
not know how many people were picked up, who they were or why they
were detained.
   The clashes broke out Friday, a day after security forces
arrested Moslem leaders. The residents said occasional gunfire had
continued into early Sunday but subsided later in the day.
   Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre Sunday offered his
condolences to the relatives of those who died and said ``things are
back to normal.''
   In his brief address over state radio, Barre appealed for calm
and said Somalis should ``cooperate with the security forces in
maintaining stability.''
   The clashes occurred near a mosque in a neighborhood of western
Mogadishu, according to Somali state radio. Casualties included
``troublemakers'' and members of the security forces, according to a
state radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi, Somalia's western
neighbor.
   A resident said it appeared troops opened fire as Moslem
worshipers left the mosque. Islam is the state religion in the
impoverished East African nation of about 9 million.
   Security forces apparently were outside the mosque to forestall
any protests of Thursday's arrests of the Moslem religious leaders.
   It was unclear why the religious leaders were detained or whether
there was any connection between their arrests, the weekend violence
and the July 9 assassination of Mogadishu's Roman Catholic Bishop
Salvatore Pietro Colombo, the residents said.
   The Italian government Saturday provided transportation out of
Mogadishu for 40 Italians visiting relatives working on Italian aid
projects in Somalia, according to the Italian news agency ANSA.
   The government has not allowed journalists to visit Somalia in
more than a year.
   Somalia, on the horn of East Africa that juts into the Indian
Ocean, has been led by the autocratic Barre as a one-party state
since 1969.
   Since 1981, his government has battled the Somali National
Movement, a northern insurgency that demands Barre's removal.
Intensified fighting between the insurgents and the government over
the last 18 months has driven more than 200,000 Somalis into refugee
camps in neighboring Ethiopia.

   Will Steger and a team of international
explorers left aboard a Soviet transport plane Sunday night for the
first trans-Antarctica trek by dogsled.
   After hugging relatives, waving good-bye to a several dozen
well-wishers and gathering for a team photo, the six-member crew
boarded the plane at 8:30 p.m.
   The plane carrying 42 dogs and about 13,000 pounds of equipment
departed from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport one hour
later.
   The grizzled Minnesota adventurer and five companions from five
countries are probably as prepared as humans can be for the
continent's perils.
   ``I consider driving in Minneapolis rush-hour traffic much more
dangerous than Antarctica,'' he said in an interview Friday. ``In
Antarctica, things are in your control.''
   After several stops in Latin America, their seven-month,
4,000-mile trip across the bottom of the world was due to begin Aug.
1, weather permitting. The team hopes the grueling journey from west
to east will rivet attention on international cooperation, as well
as the continent's stark fragility.
   At the same time, Steger, 44, wants to pursue a dream he says has
lurked inside him for years: to conquer the world's last untamed
frontier.
   ``I've traveled north for so many years now, and I've been drawn
to these areas,'' said Steger. ``It's the frontier, it's the white
spots on the maps, the adventure and the exhilaration of traveling
in those unknown places that draws me.''
   Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snow
tractors, but this will be the first unmechanized attempt.
   The venture has also drawn lots of publicity and money, with
corporations in the United States and France contributing nearly $10
million. A $3.5 million aluminum boat will serve as a floating
embassy and communications base.
   The team has been plucked from all corners of the earth through a
combination of nationalities and outdoor skills. The members are
Steger, co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne of France, Soviet scientist
Victor Boyarsky, Englishman Geoff Somers, Keizo Funatsu of Japan,
and Qin Dahe of China.
   The trip south is to includes stops in Havana; Lima, Peru; and
Buenos Aires, Argentina.
   Finally, from the tiny Argentine city of Rio Grande, the crew
will wait for the proper weather to fly to King George Island near
the tip of the Antarctic peninsula, where the Chinese will be
hosting the trek's launch at the Great Wall research base. The
arbitrary point of Seal Nunataks was chosen as the trek's launching
pad.
   But even the best plans can't completely shield the crew from
Antarctica's temperatures _ hovering at 50 degrees below zero _ or
its blinding winds that reach gusts of 100 mph.
   ``The challenge is going to be the constant wind that may blow 10
to 15 miles an hour against you in your face, and the storms that
literally rip apart your tent,'' Steger said.
   The hazards don't stop there. Crevasses up to 150 feet deep await
the crew, avoidable only by painstaking attention to dips in the
snow or changes in color that signal light coming through.
   While money and letters from well-wishers have poured in, the
expedition has also drawn its share of criticism.
   Jack Talmadge, head of polar coordination and information at the
National Science Foundation, worries that Steger's well-publicized
efforts on the continent would bring in more people.
   ``We think the expression by Will Steger of a basic human need to
explore is admirable,'' he said. But if tourism to the Antarctic
developed further, he said, wildlife could be disrupted.
   Such concerns are pointless, said expedition spokeswoman Jennifer
Gasperini. ``We're not trying to promote tourism. ... We need to
generate an awareness of Antarctica, to make people understand the
pristine nature of its environment and therefore preserve it.''
   This won't be Steger's final expedition, but it will be the last
of its magnitude, the adventurer said.
   ``It will be a pinnacle of major Arctic expeditions. There's
really nowhere you can go to top this one.''

   It will contain accounts of Nixon's meetings with world leaders
and advice about running for office, winning and governing. It also

   Typhoon Gordon lashed the northern
Philippines on Sunday, killing at least five people and destroying
dozens of houses with floods and landslides, officials said.
   Most of the deaths, including that of a 7-year-old boy buried in
a landslide, were reported in the resort city of Baguio, Red Cross
and local officials said.
   More than 100 families fled their homes due to floods and
landslides, Red Cross officials said.
   The typhoon, the strongest storm to hit the country this year,
came ashore in Cagayan province before dawn Sunday with winds of up
to 116 mph, officials said. It brought heavy rain to the main island
of Luzon, where Manila is located.
   Strong winds swept the city but there were no reports of deaths
or damage.
   The storm was heading away from Manila late Sunday. Storm
warnings were lowered in urgency in five provinces along Gordon's
path as the typhoon headed northwest at 14 mph toward the South
China Sea, according to the government weather bureau.
   In Baguio, two carpenters were killed when their shanty was
buried in mud and debris, city official Lito Pangilinan said.
Another person drowned in a lagoon, said Red Cross relief supervisor
Ireneo Zabala.
   In the nearby town of La Trinidad, Sammy Pelino, 7, was killed by
a landslide, Pangilinan said.
   In the neighboring province of La Union, lightning killed Arnel
Medigoria, officials in the government's Office of Civil Defense
said.
   The typhoon felled trees and electric lines in several provinces,
officials said. Philippine Airlines canceled four flights, mostly to
the northern provinces.
   On Saturday, officials canceled all inspections, training and
other activities at the U.S.-run Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of
Manila. The base's emergency rescue and cleanup units were placed on
alert and non-essential personnel were ordered home.
   The U.S. military's Far East Network, which described Gordon as a
``super-typhoon,'' said some military airlift command flights to and
from Clark were canceled because of the storm.

   The Unit 2 reactor at the Diablo

a leaky pipe in the ocean water cooling system, a utility spokesman
said.
   The leak occurred in a heat exchanger in a ``non-nuclear''
portion of the system, said Clyde Walthall, spokesman for Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric.
   Repairs were expected to take two or three days.
   The reactor was running at 50 percent power for routine cleaning
of the ocean water cooling system when the leak was discovered,
Walthall said.
   The repairs will prevent salt water from leaking into part of the
cooling system where it does not belong, he said.
   The plant's other reactor, Unit 1, remained operating at 100
percent power.

<HEAD>Judge's Decision in Time Case Provides Possible Guidelines for Future</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   While Paramount Communications Inc. appeals a
judge's decision allowing Time Inc. to proceed with a $14 billion
tender offer for Warner Communications Inc., lawyers and corporate
executives have begun studying the opinion to see how it might
affect transactions between other firms.
   Friday's decision by Delaware Chancery Court Judge William T.
Allen disputed the claim by Paramount _ which is trying to buy Time
in a $12.2 billion hostile tender offer _ that Time directors put
the company up for sale when they agreed to a friendly stock-swap
merger with Warner last March.
   After Paramount announced its bid for Time on June 6, Time and
Warner amended their earlier stock-for-stock transaction to provide
for the $70-a-share tender offer.
   Paramount and some of Time shareholders who also sought to stop
Time's offer for Warner are appealing Allen's ruling to the Delaware
Supreme Court, which could affirm, modify or overturn his decision.
The state's highest court will hear arguments from both sides on
July 24.
   But while it is not yet known if Allen's 79-page opinion will
stand, corporate lawyers and executives are nonetheless interested
in what it says. Many of the nation's biggest companies are
incorporated in Delaware and are subject to its laws and court
decisions. Delaware laws also have been used as models for statutes
in other states.
   Allen's opinion dealt with several issues raised by Paramount as
it attempted to prove that Time management and directors acted in
bad faith.
   For example, in arguments before Allen during a hearing last
week, Paramount contended that Time executives, including Chairman
J. Richard Munro and President N.J. Nicholas Jr., used a merger with
Warner as a way to protect their own jobs.
   Time executives and directors testified that they sought to have
Nicholas ultimately serve as chief executive of the merged company,
Time Warner Inc., rather than a Warner executive because they were
concerned about preserving the journalistic integrity of
publications such as Time and People magazines.
   Paramount claimed these concerns were actually a disguise for
management entrenchment, but Allen took a broader view of the
situation.
   ``There may be at work here a force more subtle than a desire to
maintain a title or office in order to assure continued salary or
prerequisites ...,'' the judge wrote.
   ``The mission of the firm is not seen by those involved with it
as wholly economic, nor the continued existence of its distinctive
identity as a matter of indifference,'' he said.
   His ruling gives other executives more leeway to consider their
own roles when they structure a transaction.
   Another issue raised by Paramount was whether Time put itself up
for sale because, after the proposed created of Time Warner Inc.,
the former Warner stockholders would own more than 60 percent of the
company while former Time shareholders would own 40 percent. Time
was transferring control of itself to Warner, Paramount argued.
   Allen called the unequal stock positions irrelevant. ``Control of
both (companies) remained in a large, fluid changeable and changing
market ... Effectuation of the merger would not have subjected Time
shareholders to the risks and consequences of minority share.''
   If Allen's ruling stands, companies contemplating similar
stock-for-stock mergers can rely on this statement as support for
the way they set up their own deals.
   Allen acknowledged that the outcome of the Time-Paramount fight
has implications that go beyond this case and that mergers under
different circumstances could run into trouble.
   Paramount had argued that Time management, by undertaking a
series of defensive steps, had opened the company up to other bids,
including the Paramount offer.
   Allen agreed that ``Time management and its board had, at all
times, one eye on the takeover market, considered that market in all
they did, and took steps to afford themselves the conventional
defenses,'' but he added, ``I do not regard that fact as darkly as
do the plaintiffs.''
   But the judge, referring to the fact that takeover defenses can
make a company vulnerable, included a warning in his opinon:
   ``It is inevitable today for businessmen to be mindful of this
factor.''

<TEXT>
   Robert Leventhal, former chairman of Western Union
Corp., has been named dean of the undergraduate and graduate
business schools at the University of Washington.
   Leventhal, 62, takes over the $130,000-a-year post in September,
replacing Nancy Jacob, who resigned as dean last September and has
returned to the faculty.
   David Thorud, dean of the Forestry School and chairman of the
committee that selected Leventhal, said the panel wanted someone who
could work with the business community ``in developing support, both
financial and otherwise, for the business schools.''
   Leventhal, who spent 20 years in the Navy before retiring with

<HEAD>Schedule Increase Means Increased Workload For Eastern's Pilots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Plans by strikebound Eastern Airlines' to boost its
schedule in August have meant around-the-clock training sessions and
some of the industry's longest flying hours and quickest advancement
for pilots, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Miami-baesd Eastern wants to put enough planes in the air in
August to prove to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland that it
should be given a chance to revive the airline.
   Fewer than 300 of Eastern's 3,800 union pilots have come back to
work since the March 4 walkout by the Machinists union members,
pilots and flight attendants.
   Meanwhile, Eastern has hired 835 pilots, 559 of whom still are in
training. The company said 215 are flying, and 61 have flunked out
or left the program for other reasons.
   The Palm Beach Post reported in Sunday's editions that the
accelerated program to prepare for the expanded August schedule
means:
   _Pilots will have to fly nearly 30 percent a month more than
Eastern's chief competitors, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines,
and more than any other major airline.
   _About 25 percent of Eastern's pilot recruits are being promoted
to captain within a few months. At other airlines it takes more than
10 years to reach such status. Eastern downplays the significance,
saying it's just providing advancement opporunities to qualified
pilots.
   _Eastern's schedule could become rife with canceled flights
because of its pilots' inexperience. The National Transportation
Safety Board has recommended that airlines avoid pairing pilots with
little experience together. Eastern is using such crews and has said
it will have to cancel flights in certain kinds of bad weather.
   The issue of pilots and safety has exacerbated the hostile
relations between Eastern and the strikers. The airline says the
pilots union has hired pilots to infiltrate the program and
encourage other trainees to drop out. The union says it's main goal
is to protect the public and to expose Eastern's rebuilding plan as
unworkable.
   Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
five days after its unions walked out, wants its creditors to
approve a rebuilding plan that would leave it two-thirds it
prestrike size.
   Many of the union members have sworn never to work for the
airline as long as it is owned by Texas Air Corp. and its chairman,
Frank Lorenzo. The union also threatens to blacklist the
strikebreakers from ever working for any of the 40 airlines with Air
Line Pilots Association labor contracts.
   Using its national network of union members and aviation sources,
the pilots union says it has established its own ``intelligence
agency'' to hunt down any recruits with what it calls questionable
records.
   The rush to hire pilots has opened the doors to candidates that
the union has called unqualified. Eastern disagrees.
   Eastern, which once flew to 102 cities, plans to rebuild its
schedule to 65 cities by Aug. 1 and 77 cities by the end of the
year. The August schedule requires 580 pilots for 390 daily flights.
   The original plan submitted to the judge called for 850 pilots to
be onboard by August, but last month Eastern President Phil Bakes
conceded in congressional hearings that the airline would be lucky
to have 550 to 600 pilots by August. In testimony June 30 before the
House subcommittee on aviation, Bakes said the company will make up
the difference by requiring pilots to fly more hours.
   Eastern has since revised the figures to 90 to 92 flying hours
per month. The FAA limits pilots to flying no more than 100 hours a
month or 1,000 hours a year.
   Based on Eastern's roster of captains and first and second
officers and its focus on developing an Atlanta hub, the union
estimates that captains would have to fly 105 hours per month, and
first officers would have to fly 111 hours _ both above the FAA
limit.
   But the two sides differ on how successful the training program
will be. The union estimates the company will train 245 pilots by
Aug. 1 and field a total of 540. The company expects to train 300.

<HEAD>$600 Million Impact Seen from Dog Racing In Wisconsin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD EGGLESTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the first greyhounds begin circling
racetracks in Wisconsin next year, they will be chasing an estimated
$600 million a year into the state's economy, officials say.
   The five tracks approved by the State Racing Board among initial
applicants for dog-track licenses would represent a total investment
of $121.6 million, thousands of construction jobs and nearly 2,700
permanent track jobs, according to documents submitted to the board.
   But economists, track developers and state officials say the
total impact would be far greater as dollars spent at race tracks
spread in the economy like ripples across a pond.
   The $600 million economic splash, calculated from figures
projected by track licensees, does not include the construction of
new hotels or other developments the tracks are expected to spawn.
   ``Within a few years, the total economic impact could be in
excess of $1 billion,'' said Terence M. Dunleavy, executive director
of the Racing Board.
   The overall impact of racing could be greater than that of many
comparable investments because much of the business will come from
out of state, and it does not compete directly with
already-established enterprises, Dunleavy said.
   Track developers say they expect their operations to complement
rather than compete with other tourism-related businesses.
   Kenosha has no existing attraction that draws 8,000 visitors a
day to town, and Dairyland Greyhound Park outside of the city will
give the community the advantage of a major attraction without
traffic problems and other disadvantages, sad John Serpe, the
assistant track manager.
   Because Dairyland, Croixland and two of the other three tracks
expect to cater heavily to out-of-state tourists, and attract people
who otherwise might have visited tracks in Iowa, the economic ripple
effect in Wisconsin will be greater, said William A. Strang,
associate dean of the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of
Business.
   The effect could be the same as a new, $600 million-a-year
company coming to Wisconsin, Strang said.

<HEAD>Motorola Reports Record Earnings for Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. reported record earnings of
$154 million for the second quarter, based largely on increased
sales of its communications and semiconductor products.
   Motorola Chairman Robert W. Galvin said the results ``give us
confidence about the future.''
   Second-quarter earnings of $154 million, or $1.18 per share,
compared with a profit of $120 million, or 93 cents a share, during
the same period last year, Galvin said Friday. Sales increased 14
percent, from $2.09 billion to $2.39 billion.
   For the first six months of 1988, the company reported earnings
of $277 million, or $2.13 a share, on sales of $4.56 billion,
compared with a year-ago profit of $234 million, or $1.81 a share,
on sales of $4.05 billion.
   Earnings and sales for both the second quarter and first six
months were records, the company said.
   George Fisher, chief executive officer and president, said
quarterly sales in the company's communication sector increased 8
percent, with international orders growing sharply.
   He said sales of semiconductor products improved 9 percent.
Orders increased in all major market areas, he said, led by the
continued growth in consumer, communications and personal computer
industries in Asia and the Pacific.
   Galvin said the company is optimistic about capturing a greater
share of sales in international markets.
   ``We expect more rapid growth in Asia and in Europe than in the
United States,'' he said, ``and we have taken steps to manage our
businesses accordingly.''
   Motorola's products include two-way radios, cellular telephones,
electronic components and data processing equipment.

<HEAD>Ely Resigns From Unisys, Yansouni Promoted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. has named Cyril Yansouni as
the new president of the computer giant's Network Computing Group,
replacing Paul Ely, who resigned for health reasons.
   Yansouni, 47, who will be a senior vice president of the computer
company, will report to W. Michael Blumenthal, Unisys' chairman and
chief executive, the company said. He will be promoted from
corporate vice president of Unisys and vice president of products
and systems of the networking group.
   Ely, 57, announced Friday he was leaving the company and the
board of directors for health reasons.
   Yansouni spent 19 years with Hewlett-Packard before joining
Convergent, Inc. as president in 1986. He was named a Unisys
corporate vice president and networking group vice president after
Unisys bought Convergent, of San Jose, Calif., last December.
   The Network Computing Group, which Yansouni will lead, is
expected to exceed $2 billion in revenue in 1989.
   Ely was chairman of Convergent before the buyout.
