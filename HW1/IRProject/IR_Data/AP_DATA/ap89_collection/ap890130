<HEAD>Tehran's Traffic Chaos Tames, Agency Says</HEAD>

   Order may truly be emerging from chaos in
Tehran's traffic-jammed streets, which have long been a lethal cross
between a rodeo and the Pamplona bull run.
   ``It's unbelievable, but it's true. Traffic in Tehran is getting
organized,'' Iran's official and normally staid Islamic Republic
News Agency reported on Sunday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported that for the first
time in years authorities are trying to regulate traffic in the
capital of 7 million.
   During the eight-year war with Iraq, halted under an Aug. 20
cease-fire, traffic problems were left to sort themselves out:
   Motorists flagrantly disregarded normally accepted rules of the
road, usually reducing traffic to a crawl on main thoroughfares.
Pedestrians and cyclists wove with almost suicidal abandon between
trucks and buses on fume-choked streets.
   On Sunday, Tehran's traffic department began supervising the
city's 10 busiest intersections in an apparent move to end the
pandemonium, IRNA said.
   ``Taxis and buses stopped exactly at their designated stations,
cars halted at traffic at pedestrian crossings and at red lights and
pedestrians waited for the green light or used long-forgotten
pedestrian bridges,'' IRNA reported.
   It quoted a Tehrani motorist, Siroos Rasooli, as saying with
astonishment in the teeming Azadi Square: ``For the first time I saw
people ... waiting for the traffic lights before crossing the
street.''
   The agency said that in recent days 7,261 motorcyclists have been
stopped and fined for running red lights, driving on sidewalks,
failing to have licences and other offenses.
   To combat the congestion, the government resumed work in 1986 on
a 62-mile subway system with more than 140 stations. Work first
began on the system in 1979 but became another victim of the war.
   It is not known when the subway is due for completion.

<HEAD>Trophies for `Working Girl' and `Rain Man' Provide Oscar Momentum</HEAD>

   ``Working Girl'' and ``Rain Man''
emerged as top Oscar prospects after they dominated the Golden Globe
awards, which often serve as predictions for the Academy Awards.
   ABC's mega-miniseries ``War and Remembrance'' dominated the
awards for television excellence.
   Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman won top male acting awards, and
Melanie Griffith won for best comic actress. In a three-way tie,
Shirley MacLaine, Jodie Foster and Sigourney Weaver each were
honored for best dramatic actress during Saturday night's ceremonies.
   Actor Clint Eastwood got the directing trophy for ``Bird,''
beating out Mike Nichols of ``Working Girl'' and Barry Levinson of
``Rain Man.''
   Other pre-Oscar favorites were Golden Globe losers.
   The civil-rights film ``Mississippi Burning'' and the Australian
melodrama ``A Cry in the Dark'' each had four nominations but left
empty handed.
   ``Running on Empty'' went in with five nominations but got only
one, a screenplay award for Naomi Foner, and ``The Accidental
Tourist'' and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' got none.
   The best foreign-language film went to Denmark's ``Pelle the
Conqueror.''
   The Golden Globes, presented annually by the 80-member Hollywood
Foreign Press Association, is viewed as a barometer for movies in
contention for the Academy Awards. Oscar nominations will be
announced Feb. 15.
   Although considered less prestigious than the Academy Awards, the
Golden Globes attract major stars to the ceremony and play a crucial
role in film advertising campaigns and in setting the stage for the
Oscars.
   In 1988, ``The Last Emperor'' won Golden Globes for best dramatic
motion picture and best director, and then went on to win movie and
director Oscars. Cher, Michael Douglas, Sean Connery and Olympia
Dukakis all won top Golden Globes and Oscars in 1988, too.
   One recent noted exception was in 1986, when Steven Spielberg won
a Golden Globe for directing ``The Color Purple,'' but did not an
Oscar.
   ``Rain Man,'' the chronicle of a scheming car salesman who learns
to understand his autistic brother, won two Golden Globes: best
dramatic motion picture and top dramatic actor (Hoffman).
   ``You are everything an actor could ever hope for,'' Hoffman said
in an emotional acceptance speech giving special thanks to director
Levinson.
   Miss Weaver won as best supporting actress in ``Working Girl''
and tied for best dramatic actress in ``Gorillas in the Mist: The
Adventure of Dian Fossey.''
   There were several ties, including a three-way split for best
actress in a dramatic motion picture. Miss Weaver split the prize
with Miss MacLaine of ``Madame Sousatzka'' and Miss Foster of ``The
Accused.''
   Hanks, who played a teen-ager whose body grows up overnight in
``Big,'' and Miss Griffith, the savvy secretary yearning for a
better job in ``Working Girl,'' got the comedy acting trophies.
   For Miss Griffith, the daughter of actress Tippi Hedren, her
award marked a milestone in what she has described as an arduous
career.
   ``I've been an actress for 16 years, and it's the first time I've
ever won anything,'' Griffith said.
   ``This is probably the happiest I've been in my whole life,'' she
said of her award and imminent remarriage to Don Johnson.
   Actor Martin Landau took the trophy for best performance by an
actor in a supporting role for his appearance in ``Tucker: The Man
and His Dream,'' Francis Ford Coppola's study of American car maker
Preston Tucker.
   In television categories, ABC-TV's ``War and Remembrance'' won
three trophies. The epic won as best TV miniseries, and John Gielgud
and Barry Bostwick tied for best supporting actor in a miniseries.
   Jill Eikenberry, Michael J. Fox, Ann Jillian, Candice Bergen,
Judd Hirsch, Richard Mulligan, Katherine Helmond, Ron Perlman and
the shows ``thirtysomething'' and ``The Wonder Years'' also won TV
honors.
   The honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award for outstanding contribution
to the industry went to Doris Day, star of such films ``The Pajama
Game,'' ``The Man Who Knew Too Much'' and ``Pillow Talk'' and TV's
``The Doris Day Show.''

war for The Associated Press and has just completed his second
reporting visit to the country since the war ended in 1975.

   Former Viet Cong fighters carried
legless comrades on their backs and led the blind to welcome
American enemies who returned in peace long after the terrible war.
   They were faceless to each other on the battlefield, each a
possible statistic on the other's casualty report. Now they met, at
the Tay Ninh Rehabilitation Center, and spoke of pain and sorrow.
   The Americans looked at the Viet Cong guerrillas they had feared
and hated, who had killed their buddies. They saw men and women, in
or near middle age, learning to live without lost arms, legs, hands
or eyes.
   ``I wanted to shake people's hands and there weren't hands to
shake,'' said Kevin Bowen of Boston.
   ``Vietnam so deeply affected the conscience of America,'' said
William R. Kimball of South Lake Tahoe, Calif., founder of Vets With
a Mission, which brings groups of veterans back to Vietnam.
   ``It's a place that I don't think you could ever really leave
behind,'' he said. ``It was inevitable that America come back and
you're seeing the first trickle of a flood that's going to take
place in the next few years.''
   Four years ago, it was rare to see an American in Vietnam. Now
increasing numbers of veterans, relief workers, physicians and
surgeons return on goodwill missions.
   They build health clinics, perform plastic surgery on disfigured
children, deliver medical supplies and Bibles, walk old battlefields
to call attention to unexploded shells and mines that remain deadly
14 years after the war ended.
   ``It took the Vietnam veterans themselves to build the memorial''
in Washington, D.C., and ``recognize the terrible loss that
occurred,'' said Ralph Timperi, now assistant public health
commissioner of Massachusetts.
   ``It's Vietnam veterans who are taking the leadership to get our
country to recognize the terrible loss the Vietnamese have
suffered,'' he said.
   Bowen and Timperi represented the Joiner Foundation of the
University of Massachusetts, which aids hospitals and the disabled
in Vietnam. They met with disabled veterans in Hanoi and Tay Ninh
Province.
   ``By returning and working with the people as friends rather than
enemies, we can do the kind of work we thought we were doing to
begin with,'' Timperi said. ``We thought we were doing something
good when we were in the war. It turned out we weren't. By returning
and doing what in our idealistic framework we see as what Americans
ought to be doing, it helps us find ourselves again.''
   A new group of Americans arrives almost every week. Some just
come for peace of mind, to put their war to rest.
   Five former U.S. Marines revisited bases around which their
battalion, the 11th Marines, planted 100,000 mines. They did not
remove the mines and unexploded shells that still kill and maim
civilians, but will report their findings to the Vietnamese and U.S.
governments in hopes of action.
   The Marines also unfurled the Stars and Stripes and honored their
dead in brief ceremonies at two former U.S. bases.
   Nine born-again Christians delivered 5,000 Bibles to the
Protestant Church of Vietnam on behalf of Kimball's Vets With a
Mission and met some of their former enemies at a reconciliation
dinner.
   ``You're not really going to find a true healing and a true
reconciliation until we're able to face our former foe and to shake
hands and to find a mutual understanding,'' Kimball said. ``I think
that is what is taking place.''
   Vets With a Mission hopes on future visit to build a
rehabilitation ward and repair a therapy pool in an orphanage for
polio victims, and to build a Christian day care center.
   ``It seemed like every corner I turned I bumped into an
American,'' said Bill Johnson of Manchester, Conn., one of the
Marine engineers. ``I'm really amazed at how many groups are here.''
   Vietnam has opened its doors to Americans more than at any time
since the war. It hopes the United States will extend diplomatic
recognition, bringing desperately needed aid and the end of an
economically disastrous trade embargo.
   Vietnamese officials express optimism that ambassadors will be
exchanged within two years. They say U.S. demands that Hanoi
withdraw all its troops from Cambodia, which Vietnam has occupied
for 10 years, will be met by next year.
   Some veterans acknowledge Vietnam uses their visits to further
its goal of recognition, but they feel much more is involved.
   ``I think too many things happened,'' Johnson said. ``I think our
effort was a good effort and we're showing that Americans would like
to come here. I'm not speaking as a politician. Veterans want to
come back and see this country for personal reasons.''
   Even though the Marines did not represent the United States
officially, they were put in a government guest house and met with
high officials.
   By contrast, they also went to a cafe one night and drank beer
with Vietnamese veterans.
   ``When we left, they told us the war's over and they're very
happy to see us,'' Johnson said. ``They embraced us and they almost
kind of held on as we were trying to walk away. We had meetings like
that with people on the street.''
   Kimball said: ``We have no political objective or agenda. We
don't come with any self-serving motives. I think all the men have a
real heartfelt burden to do something constructive, to reconcile and
to heal the lingering wounds.''
   Bowen stood at the foot of Nui Ba Den, a forbidding mountain
around which many Americans died, and reflected:
   ``I just had a lot of memories. I lost friends. I wanted to come
back just to honor their memories, to affirm they were here.
   ``The war was a long time ago. Sometimes it's like, `Was the war
real?'''

   A stinging cold wave continued Sunday in
Alaska, prompting travel warnings and leaving some isolated villages
with dwindling fuel and other supplies, and little relief was in
sight, a meteorologist said.
   McGrath, a community 150 miles west of Mount McKinley, was the
state's coldest spot, with the temperature plummeting to 64 degrees
below zero late in the day. In Anchorage, it was 30 degrees below
zero, the coldest January day since 1975, the National Weather
Service reported.
   Records were set at Tatalina, minus 51; Kodiak, minus 15; Healy,
minus 52, and Homer, minus 24. Fairbanks reported 47 below zero;
Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean reported 51 degrees below zero.
   The wind-chill factor at Cantwell was 125 degrees below zero,
making the heavily traveled Parks Highway between Fairbanks and
Wasilla unsafe because of the threat the cold could make cars break
down and strand motorists without heat, state troopers said Sunday.
   The severe cold grounded small planes, keeping supplies and
repair people from reaching some isolated communities.
   The extreme cold can congeal lubricants in differentials and
transmissions, freeze tires and freeze coolant in radiators.
   Anchorage police said they rushed to answer calls about stalled
vehicles. ``It's too cold to be left sitting in a car,'' said a
spokeswoman.
   It appeared to be warming up a few degrees in some parts of
Alaska's Interior, said meteorologist Pat Poole of the National
Weather Service.
   ``In some places, you're talking 10 degrees warmer; it's like 50
below,'' he said. ``But every 10 degrees is important.''
   However, he said there was no substantial relief in sight, at
least in the five-day forecast, from the week of extreme cold caused
by a high-pressure area over Alaska's Interior.
   ``There's a new high-pressure area that's moving down across the
northern Siberian coast,'' Poole said. ``It'll be coming in over
Alaska in the next few days. I'm sure it's going to be pretty cold.''
   Firefighters called out to battle several blazes Sunday in
Anchorage had frozen pumps on their trucks and other cold-related
problems, a spokeswoman said. ``Most of our fires are being caused
by people trying to thaw pipes,'' she said.
   The American Red Cross opened emergency shelters at Port Graham
on the Kenai Peninsula and in Anchorage. About a dozen people stayed
in the Anchorage facility, mostly victims of frozen pipes, officials
said.
   Plumbers were doing land office business.
   ``You can't get a plumber for the price of gold,'' said
veterinarian Joyce Murphy, who was trying to thaw pipes in her home
Sunday. ``You can't find one.''
   Chuck Renfro, owner of Curtis Plumbing and Heating in Eagle
River, said he had been getting 150 calls a day since the cold snap
started a week ago. ``This is some kind of record for us,'' he said.
   Refueling of aircraft at Anchorage International Airport was
slowed during the weekend by frigid temperatures and balky hydraulic
systems. Several freight flights were canceled and 270 passengers
aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from Chicago to Tokyo were
stranded; after landing in Anchorage to refuel, one of the engines
jammed, officials said.
   A list of cold-related problems released by state emergency
services officials included dwindling fuel supplies, congealed
heating fuel, frozen water and sewer lines and non-delivery of
checks and federal food stamps.
   Telephone communications with Akhiok, Buckland, Eek, Kongingig,
Port Moller, Selawik and Whittier were cut off because the
communities' diesel-powered generators were out of fuel or out of
order, said Alascom spokesman Tom Jensen.
   Communications with about 30 other communities were impaired,
Jensen said.
   Various school districts opened their buildings to people in need
of shelter.
   In Bethel, the Kuskokwim 300 Sled Dog Race scheduled to start
Thursday was postponed until at least Monday by the cold, the first
such delay in the race's 10-year history.

<HEAD>Authorities Identify Two Children And One of Two Fatally Beaten Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Investigators have identified one of two
women whose severely beaten bodies were found in a rural area as the
mother of a boy who was found abandoned a few hours later in a
neighboring county.
   The other woman has not been conclusively identified, but Denton
County and Wise County authorities and the Texas Rangers are trying
to determine if she is the mother of a 14-month-old girl who also
was found wandering alone and is the cousin of the young boy.
   Two brothers, who are the estranged husbands of the two
children's mothers, were being questioned by investigators Saturday
night, but Denton County Sheriff Kirby Robinson would not say if
they were being considered suspects in the slayings of the women.
   The woman who has been identified, through fingerprints on file
with the Texas Department of Public Safety, is Claudia Medina, 22.
Officials say she and the other woman were bludgeoned with some sort
of pipe and left in a culvert near Decatur, in rural Wise County
about 30 miles northwest of Fort Worth.
   Ms. Medina has been identified as the mother of a small boy found
alone in Denton County, north of Dallas, on Thursday. Damion Medina
Gamez had his first birthday on the day his mother's battered body
was found.
   The two brothers being questioned have been identified as Damion
Gamez, the boy's father, and Silvio Rojas Gamez, the father of
14-month-old Silvia Rojas Gamez.
   The girl's mother is Erlinda Martinez Gamez, authorities said.
   Robinson said at a news conference that investigators began
searching for the two brothers on Saturday night after a man
identified only as Pablo said he thought he knew the two slain women.
   According to Robinson, Pablo is a neighbor of the women and had
seen them the night before they were found dead.
   Robinson said the women were seen leaving their Frisco residence
in a vehicle, and at least one of the children was seen leaving with
them.
   The Gamez brothers, who are both construction workers, turned
themselves in to authorities after investigators began searching in
Frisco and Little Elm for them. The two men told police their wives
and small children were missing, Robinson said.
   Frisco Police Chief Roger Wingo said the search was conducted in
that area because the brothers had listed residences there during
previous arrests for public intoxication in his city.
   The children have been in foster care since they were found.
Caseworker Leigh Ann Pulley, said the boy had seemed to be in good
spirits and was saying ``Momma,'' but the girl had been silent.

<HEAD>Burger, Some Senior Judges Due For Raises For No Court Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A fifth of all senior federal judges including
former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger stand to collect their largest
pay raises in a decade even though they no longer handle any court
cases, The Associated Press has learned.
   This windfall _ increasing Burger's salary by $60,000 to $175,000
a year, for example _ stems from a complex retirement system that
allows federal judges to reduce their caseloads sharply while still
qualifying for active-duty pay increases. In stepping down from
full-time duty, they accept a title of ``senior judge.''
   Aside from Burger, the 305 other senior judges also stand to see
their salaries rise by about 50 percent unless Congress disapproves
the package of raises for top federal officials.
   Judges who retire through resignation _ the other option provided
by Congress _ keep for life the same salary they received on their
last day of work. In Burger's case, it would have been $108,400.
   Senior status is the vastly more popular option, and experts
believe the federal court system might be hopelessly clogged without
the part-time contributions of these jurists.
   But administrative records obtained by the AP indicate that
roughly one in five of the nation's 306 senior judges do no judicial
work whatsoever. They get the raises but are as hard to find on the
bench as the 13 former judges who chose full retirement through
resignation.
   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead, a member of
a House subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary. The
California Republican, whose skepticism last year sidetracked a bill
to lower the eligibility age for senior status, said, ``We need to
look into this much further.'' Congress may want to study
``establishing some minimum work to qualify for the raises,'' he
said.
   As the law stands now, there is no such minimum. A senior judge
may work as much _ or as little _ as he wants. A federal judge
cannot be forced to resign; the Constitution says a judicial
appointment is for life.
   Under recommendations by then-President Reagan, the highest-paid
federal officials will receive their largest raises in a decade on
Feb. 8 if Congress does not disapprove.
   Comparatively unnoticed in the political controversy over the 50
percent congressional pay raise are equal increases for federal
trial judges and raises nearly as generous for the rest of the
judiciary.
   Federal district judges would see their salaries rise from
$89,500 to $135,000; appellate judges from $95,000 to $140,000; and
Supreme Court justices from $110,000 to $165,000. Senior judges get
the same salaries.
   Stephen Gillers, professor of legal ethics at New York
University, said he saw no ethical problem for the non-working
senior judges but ``it may be the statute should be changed. It may
be unwise or bad management. It's a question whether the public is
getting its money's worth.''
   Congress created the senior judge category in 1919. By luring
older jurists out of their lifetime appointments, lawmakers hoped to
ease court workloads and open jobs for younger appointees to the
bench.
   In large measure, senior judges pitch in just as Congress
intended.
   As a group, they handle between 10 and 15 percent of all federal
cases. ``The federal judiciary would be a mess without the help of
senior judges,'' said Frank Coffin, an appeals court judge from
Portland, Maine, who plans to maintain a substantial caseload once
he claims senior status.
   Some, like 91-year-old Elbert P. Tuttle of Atlanta, are on the
bench almost as often as their 750 active colleagues. Tuttle does
about 70 percent as much work as the active judges in the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, according to circuit executive Norman
Zoller.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the only public report on
the subject of senior judge workloads, compiled by the
Administrative Office of the Courts. Identifying each senior judge
only by a code number, with no names listed, the report showed that
in the year ending June 30, 1987, 56 of 271 senior judges, or 21
percent, handled no cases. Forty nine of the 56 were over 75 years
old.
   David Cook, who keeps track of such statistics for the office,
said office policy bars him from releasing information on individual
judges by name or more recent coded data. But he said, ``If you did
the survey today, I don't think things would be much different.''
   Senior status is available to any judge who is at least 65 with
15 years experience or 70 with 10 years. There are now a total of
306, including Burger, and Cook said the patterns found in 1987 are
``not out of date.''
   For those senior judges who do not work, reasons can differ
dramatically.
   James Noel Jr., a senior judge in Houston, performed his last
judicial duty in 1978 when his annual salary was $54,500 _ $80,500 a
year less than the salary he stands to begin receiving next month.
   Noel, 79, took senior status in 1976 when he was 66, after 15
years as a federal trial judge. Asked why he chose senior status and
not resignation, Noel told AP, ``It was just a matter of choice.''
   Noel regularly travels to his downtown office to manage his
``extensive investments.'' When asked about his impending pay raise,
Noel said, ``I was expecting it.''
   Owen Cox, appointed as a federal trial judge in Texas by
President Nixon in 1970, took senior status in 1981. Jesse Clark,
the district court's clerk, said Cox did substantial work for most
of a year until ``his health failed and he had difficulty getting to
the office.''
   ``He's been hospitalized for three years. He's on a life-support
system,'' Clark said.
   Cox's salary would rise to $135,000 next month. Had he resigned
in 1981 his salary would have been frozen at $67,100.
   Burger left the Supreme Court bench in September 1986 to serve as
unpaid chairman of the commission celebrating the bicentennials of
the Constitution and Bill of Rights. He declined to answer questions
about his impending pay increase and his judicial workload other
than to pass along that, ``I'm too busy to sit.''
   When he retired, his salary was $108,400. Had he resigned,
Burger's annual salary would have been frozen for life at that
figure. But Burger, who has spent much of his career campaigning for
higher salaries for judges, chose senior status. As a result, he
qualifies for whatever pay raises are extended to his successors as
chief justice.
   In 1987, the chief justice's salary was raised to $115,000, and
Burger got the increase along with Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
Under the new proposal, Rehnquist and Burger each would be paid
$175,000.
   Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said Burger has not been
asked to hear any cases because, she presumed, Rehnquist is aware
that Burger works full-time as chairman of the bicentennial
commission.
   By contrast, Rehnquist assigned former Supreme Court Justice
Lewis Powell to serve on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, Va.. Powell also will sit next month on the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Florida.
   ``As a lawyer and law teacher I would be troubled if judges were
being paid for doing nothing and getting increments for doing
nothing unless Congress made a conscious decision that even judges
in total retirement should get pay raises,'' Professor Gillers said.
   He said nothing in law or judicial standards makes it unethical
for a senior judge to do no work and collect pay raises.
   ``I can't speak to the personal propriety,'' he said. ``Every
judge has to make that decision for himself.''
   Coffin, the federal appeals court judge, said, ``It's a good
theoretical question'' whether the system is fair. ``If there were
more frequent pay raises for judges I'd be more bothered.''

   Elbert P. Tuttle, a fabled champion of civil
rights, became a federal judge in Georgia at age 57. He's 91 now,
and the South is a very different place. But he's still on the bench.
   ``He is an amazing man, a national treasure,'' said Norman
Zoller, circuit executive for the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   In his 1981 book ``Unlikely Heroes,'' author Jack Bass named
Tuttle as one of four federal appellate judges most responsible for
racially desegregating the South by building on a landmark 1954
Supreme Court decision.
   Bass described the bald, bespectacled Tuttle as ``a quiet,
somewhat formal and unfailingly courteous man who practices
old-fashioned virtues.''
   Tuttle, now a senior judge, still carries about 70 percent of the
normal caseload for an active judge on the 11th Circuit Court. He
and his wife, Sara, still live in Georgia.
   Tuttle once summarized his own philosophy in a speech to law
students. ``The professional man is in essence one who provides
service,'' he said. ``Like love, talent is only useful in its
expenditure and it is never exhausted. But never confuse the
performance, which is great, with the compensation _ be it money,
power or fame _ which is trivial.''

<HEAD>Woman Breathing Easier After Piece Of Metal Removed From Lung</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL C. BUELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELLEVILLE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vickie Schenk is breathing easier these
days, now that a piece of metal that was lodged in her right lung
for 36 years has been removed.
   The 41-year-old Belleville woman inhaled the foil-thin piece of
1{-by-1 inch aluminum when she was 5, and forgot about it.
   About three years later, she began to develop breathing and
health problems. They lasted until July, when doctors at St. Marys
Hospital Medical Center discovered the piece of metal and removed it.
   ``The last three years or so were really bad. Every six weeks or
so I was going to the doctor for some type of chest infection or
cold,'' said Ms. Schenk, an attendant at a health care center near
her southern Wisconsin hometown.
   Ms. Schenk and her mother, Victoria, said they remembered Ms.
Schenk inhaling the piece of metal, which had been to wrap a ribbon
or lace.
   ``I came up to her one day when she was playing with her dolls
outside and asked her what she was chewing on,'' Victoria Schenk
said. ``She swallowed it right there. Like any other kid that
swallows something, like a nickel, it usually passes and you forget
about it.''
   Ms. Schenk said she forgot about the incident and never linked it
to her health problems because of the time lapse and the incidence
of asthma in her family.
   In the years that followed, Ms. Schenk began to suffer chronic
coughing during strenuous activity or in the middle of the night.
   The coughing fits, some of which would last for 45 minutes, led
to frequent and lengthy bouts of wheezing and shortness of breath,
Vickie Schenk said.
   She underwent years of allergy shots to alleviate her problems.
   ``She had been on medication, including steriods, for most of her
life because of this,'' said Dr. William Donovan, a lung specialist.
   The disability kept Ms. Schenk out of strenuous school activities
during her childhood. She exercised in an effort to strengthen her
lungs, but most of the time wound up coughing painfully.
   ``It's unbelievable. I've had hundreds of X-rays in my life and
it (the metal) never showed up,'' Ms. Schenk said.
   The object probably never showed up because there was fluid
around it, giving it a density similar to body tissue, and because
aluminum is sometimes not as easily detected by X-rays, doctors said.
   Last July, she developed a severe infection that required surgery
to drain fluid from between her lungs and ribs.
   When doctors performed a bronchoscopy, in which a lit tube is
inserted down the throat to look into the lungs, doctors saw the
object and surgically removed it.
   ``When we took it out we still didn't know if her problems were
over. She could have had asthma anyway. But she has had no problems
since then,'' Donovan said.

<HEAD>Earthquake Of Magnitude 5.4 Rocks Utah</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An earthquake shook most of Utah and parts
of western Colorado and Wyoming Sunday night, rattling homes and
knocking objects off walls, but no major damage or injuries were
reported, authorities said.
   The quake was centered about 140 miles south of Salt Lake City,
16 miles southeast of the central Utah community of Salina, and had
a magnitude of 5.4 on the Richter scale, said Russ Needham, a
geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake
Information Service in Golden, Colo.
   ``It was pretty strong. It was knocking stuff off the walls,''
said Utah Highway Patrol Dispatcher Marty Estrada in Price, about 70
miles southwest of the epicenter.
   ``We've got people checking for damages right now, but we haven't
heard any actual reports of damages,'' he said.
   The quake, which occurred at 9:06 p.m. MST, was felt by residents
from Salt Lake City south to Moab and as far east as Grand Junction,
Colo., and Rock Springs, Wyo., said Sue Nava, senior staff
seismologist at the University of Utah Seismograph Stations in Salt
Lake City.
   The quake also was felt in northern Arizona, said the information
service in Golden, which characterized the quake as ``moderate.''
   The most recent quake of significant size in Utah was a temblor
of magnitude 5.3 that occurred Aug. 14 and was centered 48 miles
southwest of Sunday's quake, Nava said.
   Seismograph Stations Director Walter Arabasz said Utahns could
feel some aftershocks in the ensuing hours.
   ``From historical experience ... there's about a 2 percent chance
that an earthquake of this size would be followed by a larger
earthquake,'' he said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   A 14-month-old girl was hospitalized with a
skull fracture and stab wounds after two boys, ages 4 and 5,
attacked her with a screwdriver, a shovel, a hammer and a brick,
police said Sunday.
   The girl was in critical but stable condition at Cardinal Glennon
Children's Hospital, a nursing supervisor said.
   The girl lost a lot of blood in the attack Saturday, in which she
was stabbed in the face, an ear and the back of her head,
authorities said.
   Authorities did not release the names of either the victim or the
two boys, who are brothers. One of the boys told authorities they
had assaulted the girl ``because she was ugly; we liked doing it.''
   The girl was being cared for by her mother's boyfriend while her
mother was being held at the St. Louis County Adult Correctional
Institution awaiting trial on charges of felony theft and
misdemeanor assault, police said. The mother has been in jail since
Dec. 23.
   The girl was assaulted early Saturday afternoon in the basement
of her south St. Louis home. Several children and adults were
upstairs at the time, police said. The boys and some family members
were visiting the home.
   The Missouri Division of Family Services will conduct a further
investigation, police said.

<HEAD>Burger, Some Senior Judges Due For Raises For No Court Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fifth of all senior federal judges including
former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger stand to collect their largest
pay raises in a decade even though they no longer handle any court
cases, The Associated Press has learned.
   This windfall _ increasing Burger's salary by $60,000 to $175,000
a year _ stems from a retirement system allowing federal judges to
reduce their caseloads sharply while still qualifying for
active-duty pay increases. In stepping down from full-time duty,
they accept a title of ``senior judge.''
   Aside from Burger, the 305 other senior judges also stand to see
their salaries rise by about 50 percent unless Congress disapproves
the raises due for top federal officials on Feb. 8.
   Judges who retire through resignation _ the other option provided
by Congress _ keep for life the same salary they received on their
last day of work. In Burger's case, it would have been $108,400.
   Senior status is the vastly more popular option. Burger, for
example, already has received one raise, in 1987, to $115,000.
   Administrative records obtained by the AP indicate that roughly
one in five of the nation's senior judges do no judicial work
whatsoever. They get the raises but are as hard to find on the bench
as the 13 former judges who chose full retirement.
   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' said Rep. Carlos Moorhead, a member of
a House subcommittee overseeing the federal judiciary. The
California Republican, whose skepticism last year sidetracked a bill
to lower the eligibility age for senior status, said Congress may
want to consider ``establishing some minimum work to qualify for the
raises.''
   As the law stands now, a senior judge may turn down any work he
doesn't want. A federal judge cannot be forced to resign; the
Constitution says a judicial appointment is for life.
   Stephen Gillers, a New York University legal ethics professor,
said he sees no ethical problem for the non-working senior judges
but ``it may be the statute should be changed. It may be unwise or
bad management. It's a question whether the public is getting its
money's worth.''
   Congress created the senior judge category in 1919 to ease court
workloads and open jobs for younger appointees, by luring older
judges out of their lifetime appointments.
   In large measure, senior judges pitch in just as Congress
intended.
   As a group, they handle between 10 and 15 percent of all federal
cases. ``The federal judiciary would be a mess without the help of
senior judges,'' said Frank Coffin, an appeals court judge from
Portland, Maine.
   Some, like 91-year-old Elbert P. Tuttle of Atlanta, are on the
bench almost as often as their 750 active colleagues. Tuttle does
about 70 percent as much work as any of the active judges in his
circuit, according to circuit executive Norman Zoller.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the only public report on
senior judge workloads, compiled by the Administrative Office of the
Courts. Identifying each senior judge only by a code number, with no
names listed, the report showed that in the year ending June 30,
1987, 56 of 271 senior judges, or 21 percent, handled no cases.
Forty nine of the 56 were over 75 years old.
   David Cook, who compiles the statistics, said office policy bars
him from releasing information on individual judges by name, or more
recent coded data. But he said, ``If you did the survey today, I
don't think things would be much different.''
   Cook said the 1987 patterns are ``not out of date.''
   For those senior judges who do not work, reasons can differ
dramatically.
   James Noel Jr., a senior judge in Houston, performed his last
judicial duty in 1978 when his annual salary was $54,500 _ $80,500 a
year less than he stands to begin receiving next month.
   Noel, 79, took senior status in 1976 when he was 66, after 15
years as a federal trial judge. Asked why he chose senior status and
not resignation, Noel said: ``It was just a matter of choice.''
   Senior status is available to any judge who is at least age 65
with 15 years experience or 70 with 10 years.
   Noel regularly uses his downtown office to manage his ``extensive
investments.'' When asked about his impending pay raise, Noel said,
``I was expecting it.''
   Owen Cox, a federal trial judge in Texas since 1970, took senior
status in 1981. Jesse Clark, the district court's clerk, said Cox
did substantial work until his health failed.
   ``He's been hospitalized for three years. He's on a life-support
system,'' Clark said.
   Cox's salary would rise to $135,000 next month. Had he resigned
his salary would have been frozen at $67,100.
   Burger left the Supreme Court in September 1986 to serve as
full-time but unpaid chairman of the commission celebrating the
bicentennial of the Constitution. Burger, who has spent much of his
career campaigning for higher judicial salaries, declined to answer
questions about his own impending pay increase and his judicial
workload other than to say, ``I'm too busy to sit.''
   Gillers said nothing in law or judicial standards makes it
unethical for a senior judge to do no work and collect pay raises.
   ``I can't speak to the personal propriety,'' he said. ``Every
judge has to make that decision for himself.''

   ``Shirley Valentine,'' a Broadway-bound comedy, and
Leonard Bernstein's classic 1956 Broadway musical ``Candide'' took
top honors in this year's Laurence Olivier awards.
   The theater awards, presented Sunday, are London's most
prestigious.
   Sir Alec Guinness received a lifetime achievement award during
the nationally televised ceremony, and representatives of two
winning companies from the Soviet Union _ the Kirov Ballet and the
Maly Theater of Leningrad _ delivered acceptance speeches in Russian.
   Guinness, who is playing a Soviet diplomat in the American play
``A Walk in the Woods,'' told the black-tie audience at the Dominion
Theater ``the theater was my first love and it will certainly be my
last'' as he received his award from guest of honor Princess Diana.
   ``Shirley Valentine,'' Willy Russell's one-woman play about an
emotionally unfulfilled Liverpool housewife, was named comedy of the
year. Pauline Collins, its lone performer, was chosen actress of the
year in a new play or comedy.
   ``Hang in there, girls; it may yet happen,'' said an exuberant
Collins, best-known for playing the maid Sarah on the long-running
series ``Upstairs, Downstairs.'' The actress will make her Broadway
debut when the Russell play opens Feb. 16 at New York's Booth
Theater.
   In a noticeably weak year for musicals, a limited-run revival of
``Candide'' won for musical of the year and for actress of the year
in a musical _ Patricia Routledge.
   Mickey Rooney and Ann Miller, both of whom were nominated for the
commercially unsuccessful London run of the broadway ``Sugar
Babies,'' failed to win an award.
   Timberlake Wertenbaker's ``Our Country's Good,'' a play set in a
community of Australian convicts, was named play of the year over
such works as David Hare's ``The Secret Rapture,'' which opens in
New York next fall, and ``A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing.
   ``Our Country's Good'' netted the actor of the year award for its
star David Haig.
   Unusually, none of the shows to win the top three awards is still
running in London.
   The Royal Shakespeare's Company's ``Titus Andronicus,'' long
considered one of Shakespeare's most difficult plays, won awards for
its director Deborah Warner and its star, Brian Cox, named best
actor in a revival.
   The award for actress of the year in a revival went to Harriet
Walter for three plays at the Royal Shakespeare Company: ``Twelfth
Night,'' ``Three Sisters'' and ``A Question of Geography.''
   The international flavor set by the Soviet awards for ballet and
theater continued with the award for outstanding achievement in
opera, which went to Romanian singer Leontina Vaduva, who starred in
``Manon'' at the Royal Opera House and delivered her acceptance
speech in French.
   The award for outstanding supporting performance _ by a man or
woman _ went to Eileen Atkins for two plays at The National Theater:
Shakespeare's ``Cymbeline'' and Harold Pinter's ``Mountain
Language.''
   The awards are named after the 81-year-old actor celebrated as
Britain's greatest. Olivier gave the world its definitive Hamlet,
Henry V and Richard III.

<HEAD>Wounded in Assassination Attempt, Brady now Retiring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James S. Brady, who remained on the government
payroll as Ronald Reagan's press secretary for nearly eight years
after being severely wounded in an assassination attempt, is
retiring.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said this week that
President Bush talked with Brady's wife, Sarah, about the former
press secretary's retirement plans before his inauguration.
   ``At the end of the (Reagan) administration he and Sarah had put
together a retirement program ... from a number of various
outlets,'' Fitzwater said.
   Brady, 48, who has held a variety of government jobs since coming
to Washington in 1968 as a communications consultant to the House,
is entitled to a government pension.
   He was shot in the head on March 30, 1981, during an attempt on
Reagan's life, and uses a wheelchair.
   Reagan kept him in the title of press secretary and he continued
to receive his salary of $89,500 per year as an assistant to the
president.
   He reported to the White House about one day a week to visit with
associates, sign autographs and pose for pictures.
   Deputy Press Secretary Larry Speakes became the chief White House
spokesman with the title of principal deputy press secretary. When
Speakes resigned in 1987, Fitzwater was named spokesman with the
title of assistant to the president for press relations.
   In announcing on Nov. 29 that he would retain Fitzwater as his
spokesman, then-Vice President Bush restored to him the traditional
title of press secretary.
   Asked at that time whether Brady would have a role in the new
administration, Fitzwater said, ``I know the vice president is very
interested in Jim and concerned about his well-being'' and that Bush
and his advisers ``have some ideas of things they would like him to
do.''
   When asked about this again on Monday, Fitzwater said that before
his inauguration Bush ``talked to Sarah about it, and so did I, and
a number of people are interested in putting together whatever they
would like to do.''
   ``Let's just say we're talking to Jim and we'll see what can be
worked out, but something that protects his retirement system in the
planning that they have done privately,'' he said.
   The White House press office said Mrs. Brady was not available to
talk to a reporter about the retirement plans.

<TEXT>
   Renewal of a U.S.-China technology agreement is
being delayed because of Chinese opposition to copyright protection
for computer software and patent protection for drugs, American
officials say.
   The decade-old accord is to expire at the end of this month, but
a State Department official involved with the talks said it is
likely the earlier pact will be extended in hopes of reaching
agreement through additional negotiations.
   This official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified,
said it was ``too strong'' to say the talks were at an impasse.
   ``We've exchanged information and talked a lot, but we've only
had one negotiating session,'' he said. ``We certainly anticipate
that we'll have some additional negotiating sessions, trying to
bring our positions closer together.''
   He said further talks are expected next month in Beijing,
following up on a session held in Washington on Jan. 12-13.
   At that meeting, the delegations were headed by Peter J. de Vos,
deputy assistant secretary of state for science and technology
affairs, and Duan Ruichun, deputy director of China's Department of
Science and Technology.
   President Bush will be traveling to China next month, but there
is no indication whether the science and technology agreement is
among the issues he plans to raise with the Chinese.
   The Chinese have taken the position that there is no provision in
their law for copyright protection of computer software. They made
it clear that ``they would not sign any agreement that said we agree
that software is protected by copyright,'' said Marybeth Peters, an
official with the U.S. Copyright Office.
   ``They told us they will not enact any kind of a law _ at this
point, and maybe in the future _ that says computer software is
protected by copyright, and even in the agreement, it may not say
`copyright,''' Ms. Peters said.
   The Chinese have contended that software exporters should rely on
contracts with buyers to protect their programs.
   That position has drawn sharp criticism from the Computer and
Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, a Washington-based
computer industry trade group, which points to a growing number of
complaints about software piracy in China.
   ``Contracts do nothing to impede third-party infringers,'' said
John L. Pickitt, president of CBEMA. ``The most effective and
internationally accepted protection for software is copyright.''
   Some U.S. software manufacturers have responded to the stalemate
over copyright by deciding to halt further sales in China.
   ``The risks for U.S. software exporters may have risen to a level
where participation in the PRC (People's Republic of China) market
is not justified for them,'' Pickitt said.
   On pharmaceuticals, Chinese patent law will protect the specific
process for manufacturing a drug, but not the drug itself.
   Ms. Peters said that ``since in many cases there are many ways of
processing the same drug, that really is not very effective
protection.''

<HEAD>Likely Enforcement of Erosion Rules Questioned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private conservationist says federal programs
are already having an impact on soil erosion but there are some
fears that the Agriculture Department may have trouble enforcing the
rules in the future.
   One other area of concern is the old problem of city sprawl, of
rapidly growing roads, parking lots and housing tracts eating up
millions of acres of some of the nation's best farmland.
   Robert J. Gray, policy director for the non-profit,
Washington-based American Farmland Trust, said ``the jury is still
out'' on how strict USDA will be in enforcing the 1985 farm law's
requirements to protect land and water resources.
   Among others, those require farmers to have conservation plans
completed to help protect and land and water resources, or risk
losing price supports and other federal benefits.
   ``They claim that they are going to have all the plans in place
by 1990,'' Gray said last week.
   Gray's comments followed release of an updated USDA report
outlining goals through 1997. At the top was soil erosion, a
longstanding priority, with water quality given equal ranking.
   The report said the 1985 law's Conservation Reserve Program, or
CRP, which calls for 40 million to 45 million acres of highly
erodible cropland to be planted with protective grass and trees by
the end of 1990, already is saving 530 million tons of soil each
year, thus reducing total erosion by 15 percent.
   By 1995, the report said, CRP could be saving 800 million tons of
soil annually.
   ``It they do that, then we're almost a third reduction in
erosion, which is really significant,'' Gray said.
   The final report didn't make a big point of land loss to urban
development, but neither did it reject some of the assertions made
when a draft of the report was released for public review in 1987.
   In the 1987 document, USDA said city sprawl and other
non-agricultural uses were gobbling up farmland at an annual rate
that could equal the size of Missouri by the year 2030.
   About 1.5 million acres are converted to non-agricultural use
each year, and 64 percent of that is cropland. At that rate, the
1987 report said, the nation's cropland base could be reduced by
nearly 48 million acres, or 12 percent, between 1982 and 2030.
   Gray said the figures in the draft report are still meaningful
and of concern to many professionals. Some authorities have
discounted the creep of roads, housing, parks and other
non-agricultural uses on grounds that the United States has much
land that could be put into food production if needed.
   One of the arguments includes the CRP land itself, millions of
acres that are being taken from production for 10 years. But Gray
said those acres for the most part are marginal to begin with _ land
that is too fragile for crop use.
   Meanwhile, he said, when cities grow or new roads are needed,
those spread across farmland whether it's marginal or prime, and
it's often some of the best, most productive land in the area.

   An analysis by the Agriculture Department shows
that the nation's farmer-owned cooperatives still have a long way to
go in recovering from the sharp business declines of recent years.
   In calendar 1987, according to an annual review, co-op business
volume rose slightly to $59.3 billion from $58.4 billion in 1986.
But that was still far below the record high of $73 billion reached
in 1984.
   Randall E. Torgerson, administrator of the department's
Agricultural Cooperative Service, said the 1987 increase was held
down mostly by the reduced number of crop acres in production that
year.
   Overall, prices received by farmers in 1987 were up slightly, but
the number of cooperatives continued a long downward trend.
   Total co-op business volume includes marketing, or the value of
products sold; the sales of farm supplies such as fertilizer,
chemicals, fuels and feed; and receipts from services such as
trucking, storage, grain drying and ginning.
   Torgerson said the drop in the number of farm cooperatives to
5,174 in 1987 from 5,369 in 1986 was due mainly to reorganizations,
including mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, and to some
co-ops going out of business.
   Memberships totaled 4.39 million in 1987, about the same as in
1986. Many farmers belong to more than one co-op.
   The average membership per co-op increased to an average of 848
in 1987 from 820 the previous year.

   Thailand is a major producer of tobacco in Asia
as well as an established market for the United States, although
there is ``great uncertainty'' about future sales, says an
Agriculture Department report.
   ``Unlike some of its neighbors in Asia where trade liberalization
has already led to widespread structural changes, Thailand's
cigarette industry still enjoys the protection afforded by a virtual
ban on imports,'' the report said. ``As a result, a thriving black
market exists in higher quality foreign cigarettes.''
   The report by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said
cigarette use is increasing in Thailand and may have accelerated
last year by as much as 10 percent from 1987.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Still Adjusting to Being at the Top</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 12 years, George Bush dreamed and worked to
reach the heights of his chosen profession. Now he is there and,
like many others who go from being No. 2 to being No. 1, he
sometimes finds himself ill at ease.
   Not often, he says.
   ``There's still the wonder of it all,'' Bush said at his first
presidential news conference Friday. ``It still feels different. But
not surprising.''
   ``He's enjoying the job,'' said presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater. ``The only problem is containing his enthusiasm.''
   But sometimes ...
   There are a couple of examples, including one that Bush told on
himself.
   Minutes after he took his oath at the Capitol, Bush told
congressional leaders, he heard the House sergeant at arms call out,
``Mr. President.''
   As he had for eight years as vice president, Bush waited for
President Reagan to respond. But President Reagan was now former
President Reagan. The call was for President Bush.
   A poke in the ribs from first lady Barbara Bush got the point
across.
   Reporters observed the other instance. Reagan had left Bush a
note in the Oval Office, and they asked the new president to read it
to them.
   Before doing so, Bush turned to Fitzwater. ``Am I violating any
rules here, Marlin?'' he asked.
   ``They're your rules, sir,'' said a reporter.
   ``Oh, I set the rules,'' Bush said. Then he went on to read the
note aloud.
   So, does the new president have the willies?
   Not at all, says Fitzwater. ``He's very excited by the whole
situation.''
   On the other hand, says a political scientist who doubles in
psychology, Bush would be an exception to the rule if he didn't
experience some stress in a job he has tried for so long to get.
   ``Psychologically, it is often rather overwhelming, because their
whole life is built around the struggle to get there,'' said Gary
Weaver, a professor of international relations at American
University who has also taught psychology.
   ``Once they get there, it's over with.''
   It doesn't seem to be over with for Bush, who has been setting a
hectic pace since his inauguration.
   But for some, said Weaver, the consequences can be much more
severe than just forgetting who sets the rules or not realizing who
is being addressed.
   ``Even if you look at articles on suicides of famous people _ and
I'm not suggesting that at all _ what we do find is that it very
seldom occurs as they are struggling to get to the top; it occurs
when they get to the top and are overwhelmed.''
   So, although Bush certainly has shown no signs as serious as
that, said Weaver, ``I guess you could say that for him it's
probably pretty overwhelming, because you know he's been struggling
for a long time, and one ought to assume that there would be some
personality change once he gets there. He's not going to be the old
George Bush.''

<HEAD>Two Teamsters Leaders Quit In Exchange For Dismissal From Lawsuit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Teamsters leaders quit their posts to avoid
trial in a racketeering case alleging close ties between the union
and organized crime, but the Teamsters' governing board rejected a
government proposal to settle the entire case.
   The resignations and rejection of the proposed settlement came on
a weekend that included a hastily arranged Saturday meeting in
Washington between Teamsters President William J. McCarthy and the
vice presidents of the nation's largest union.
   It was at that session that the Teamsters general executive board
voted to reject what two union sources said was a proposed
settlement calling for internal union election reform and the
resignations of a handful of the vice presidents.
   That same day, Ronald Holmes of Detroit and John H. Cleveland of
Washington informed McCarthy they were resigning as vice presidents
of the 1.6-million member union.
   Holmes made a public announcement of his decision; Cleveland's
decision to quit was confirmed privately Sunday by a union official
after a Justice Department spokeswoman said both men quit as part of
agreements with prosecutors.
   The spokeswoman, Deborah Corley of the U.S. attorney's office in
New York, said Holmes and Cleveland reached oral agreements with
prosecutors that they would be dropped as defendants in the suit if
they resigned.
   Prosecutors this week will ask a judge to approve the deals, Ms.
Corley said Sunday. She would neither confirm nor deny the existence
of a government offer to settle the entire case.
   Both Holmes and Cleveland were on the losing side last summer
when McCarthy defeated union Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis in
the race to succeed Jackie Presser as Teamsters president. Presser,
before his death, had designated Mathis as his choice for the job
but McCarthy won on a 9-8 vote.
   McCarthy, of Arlington, Mass., was head of the Teamsters in New
England and one of the union's 16 international vice presidents when
the suit was filed in New York seven months ago.
   It alleges that more than two dozen reputed organized crime
figures have had dealings in Teamsters affairs, including using mob
influence to control union elections.
   The suit is scheduled for trial Feb. 27. It asks that the court
remove the Teamsters leadership, place the union under trusteeship
and prohibit the alleged mob figures from any future dealings with
the union.
   Twenty-six reputed organized crime figures were named in the suit
but 10 were dropped as defendants last year after signing agreements
in which they promised to avoid dealings with the union.

<HEAD>Cleanup Program Relying Too Heavily On Outside Contractors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private contractors are making large profits
from the federal toxic waste cleanup Superfund, while government
supervisors of the project generally are underpaid, a congressional
study reports.
   ``It's clear that the Superfund program is still falling far
short of its promise,'' said Rep. John D. Dingell, chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee and a persistent critic of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Dingell released the study on
Sunday.
   Outside contractors have received $4 billion, or 80 to 90 percent
of the Superfund money since the program was begun eight years ago,
said the report by the Office of Technology Assessment.
   The congressional agency noted that funds for the EPA staff,
which oversees the program, remained virtually flat while the
outside spending escalated.
   Dingell called that a failure of the EPA, but the OTA report
itself said Congress shares the blame, noting that ``the dependence
on contracting is an outcome of both congressional and EPA decisions
in the early 1980s.
   ``Originally, there was general agreement that Superfund had to
be implemented quickly and would be only a short-term program and
that the necessary technical expertise existed in the private
sector. Therefore, heavy reliance on contractors seemed to make
economic and environmental sense.
   ``But we now know that Superfund will be needed for many
decades,'' the report said.
   The interim OTA report, part of a massive Superfund study to be
completed later this year, said some cleanup companies have shown
income growth of 300 percent annually, ``with net income often
rising at a much higher rate.''
   The OTA said that while much of the actual cleanup work must be
assigned to contractors, too much policy and oversight
responsibility is being parceled out to the private sector.
``Contractors do a lot of work in these areas ... that go far beyond
supportive information and analysis,'' it said.
   Meanwhile, according to the report, ``there has been a steady
drain of people with experience and expertise away from government
to contractors that compromises the environmental performance of
Superfund, because it makes it harder for EPA to supervise
contractors adequately.''
   For example, it said, one EPA regional office reported that
because of two new, large contracts, the office expects to lose 20
percent of its technical staff.
   ``Low funding for EPA staff in general has resulted in low
salaries for key Superfund people,'' it said. Some project managers
make less than $20,000 annually, even though they may be responsible
for several sites, involving multimillion-dollar contractor studies
and cleanups, the report said.
   The OTA suggested that Congress consider temporarily reducing
Superfund spending for contractors by 30 to 50 percent, roughly $400
million to $600 million, while beefing up the government's staff.

<HEAD>European Farmers Caught In Hormone Dispute With U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Walking through his barn, Jozef Fagard
slapped the heavily muscled flank of a breeding cow he uses to
produce hormone-free beef.
   Skittish calves pressed closer to their mothers on the 170-acre
farm in the ancient town of Tongeren, 55 miles east of Brussels.
   Fagard's special breed of cattle are raised free of the growth
hormones widely used in the United States but banned in Europe.
   When European nations refused to accept hormone-treated meat, the
United States retaliated with stiff duties on some European imports.
   ``People want hormone-free food. ... Thanks to this breed we can
compete without giving hormones,'' said Fagard, whose family has
been farming in Tongeren for more than 200 years.
   On Jan. 1, the European Economic Community banned imports of beef
from cattle treated with growth hormones.
   The 12-nation trading bloc earlier had blocked their use in
Europe because of consumer worries that the additives pose a health
risk. Hormones, natural and synthetic, are injected into animals'
ears to boost growth rates.
   In flouting the ban, the United States has argued that hormones
used by its farmers are safe. The EEC has warned it will impose
tough tariffs on American walnuts and dried fruit if no progress is
made by Feb. 20 to end the dispute.
   ``There is a trade war hanging (over us),'' said Odiel
Zwaenepoel, economic adviser to the Belgian Boerenbond, the farm
union.
   Joseph Yverneau, president of the Committee of Professional Farm
Organizations, the umbrella group for farm unions in the Common
Market, said: ``We don't want a war with the United States. But we
are forced to respond.''
   Without the ban, European farmers would be at a competitive
disadvantage, Fagard said. The farmers also said, however, the ban
may be too stringent.
   ``We found the regulation is too severe,'' said Yverneau, who
farms in northern France. ``There are certain natural hormones ...
which could be authorized.''
   Fagard said the 50 or so calves on his farm, if raised with extra
hormones, would weigh about 200 pounds more at the time of slaughter.
   Hugo Schrevens, who operates a dairy farm northwest of Fagard's
farm, said: ``Everyone knows you have a better financial result when
you use hormones.''
   But, Fagard said, ``The pressure is such that governments and
politicians cannot yield to the small group of producers who might
want to use hormones.''
   There have been recent cases in Europe in which farmers allegedly
bought hormones on the black market to fatten their cattle. The
farmers interviewed doubted the practice was widespread because of
stiff penalties for violators.
   The hormone ban is expected to block $100 million worth of U.S.
beef imports, a small part of the $166 billion trade estimated
between the European Economic Community and the United States last
year.
   ``It is a mini-problem actually,'' said Friedrich Rode, a German
farmer and vice president of the European farm organization.
   In fact, the hormone dispute is overshadowed by a larger fight
between the United States and Europe over farm subsidies.
   The United States wants the Common Market to end import barriers
and export and domestic subsidies that it says distort trade.
   It initially demanded the subsidies be eliminated by the year
2000 but has since said the date is negotiable.

   The dollar gained strong ground against the Japanese
yen Monday, while share prices reversed an earlier trend and plunged
in reaction to the falling yen.
   The dollar closed at 129.73 yen, up 1.08 yen from last Friday's
finish of 128.65 yen. The currency opened the week at 129.58 yen and
traded in a range of 129.55-130.03 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues shed 111.57 points, or 0.35 percent, for 31,567.50
by the end of the trading day. The main market barometer had closed
at a record 31,679.07 Saturday after winning 32.94 points during the
half-day session.
   The Nikkei had gained during trading in the morning, but fell as
institutional investors stepped to the sidelines in concern over the
yen's decline on the foreign exchange market, dealers said.
   The index's recent rapid rise also made participants shy away
from major moves, said one trader with a major securities firm in
Tokyo.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's jump at the start of Tokyo
trading followed a similar trend on overseas markets at the close of
trading last week, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``The dollar is still strong although the U.S. GNP figure was not
that good,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The currency's surge on overseas markets has made Japanese
investors realize the dollar's strength despite the
lower-than-expected GNP figure, which prompted their buying Monday,
the dealer added.
   According to the U.S. Commerce Department Friday, the country's
gross national product, the total value of all goods and services
produced, grew by 2 percent in the last quarter of 1988, down from
2.5 percent in the previous three-month period. It grew 3.8 percent
during 1988, up from 3.6 percent in 1987, the department's report
said.

<HEAD>West Germans Duck Modernization Issue at Defense Strategy Session</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO troops and arms are increasingly
unpopular among West Germans, so it was no surprise when Bonn
officials carefully ducked the issue of modernizing short-range
nuclear missiles at a NATO defense strategy session.
   Government sources said privately that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had
instructed senior West German officials attending the annual
conference to stay mum on whether Bonn supports extending the range
of battlefield nuclear missiles.
   Most of the defense experts taking part in the weekend conference
strongly support the 1983 plan adopted by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to improve the missiles, chief among them the Lance,
which was first introduced in 1972 and has a range of just over 60
miles.
   They also appeared to support U.S. calls for a cautious response
to Kremlin disarmament initiatives, though the conference did not
produce a statement.
   The issue is extremely sensitive for the Bonn government, which
is unlikely to shirk its commitments within the 16-nation alliance
by openly opposing modernization despite strong public opposition.
   But by remaining silent on the issue, the Bonn leadership may be
encouraging unrealistic hopes among West German voters that the
modernization question is still open. It was left to left-wing West
German politicians to speak out on the issue at the conference, and
they voiced resistance.
   Members of the opposition Social Democratic Party told the group
of 171 NATO defense experts that West Germans oppose modernization
and have serious problems with the size of the NATO force posted in
their country.
   As Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gains in popularity
among West Germans _ 71 percent give him a favorable rating _ public
support for defense spending and the NATO troop presence has waned.
   Most conference delegates attacked what they saw as a dangerous
complacency that could weaken defenses.
   U.S. Defense Secretary-designate John Tower told the conference
that NATOshould maintain a ``healthy skepticism'' about Kremlin
disarmament overtures and keep the West's nuclear options open.
   The Texas Republican said the alliance runs the risk of
mortgaging its security if it fails to modernize its nuclear forces
because of perceived improvements in relations with Moscow.
   Tower said the Soviet Union remains a powerful adversary with
superior military capability and the West must not lose sight of
that imbalance in its euphoria over disarmament prospects.
   ``If we fail to consider that capability, or if we fail to
consider its relevance in terms of their intentions, then we do so
at our peril,'' he said.
   Social Democrats like Egon Bahr, the party's arms control expert,
and Karsten Voigt drew fire from American participants when they
explained many West Germans are increasingly critical of NATO
doctrine.
   Even Defense Minister Rupert Scholz mentioned his country's
concerns about the possibility of having to share a greater burden
of the NATO budget, though he avoided mentioning modernization.
   Tower met privately with Scholz on Sunday morning but apparently
accomplished little in the way of persuading his allied counterpart
to show stronger support for NATO policy.
   ``We just illuminated some problems. We didn't come to any
solutions,'' Tower told The Associated Press after the meeting.
   He declined to say what particular issues were covered or whether
he was able to get an assurance from the West German minister that
Bonn would support modernization.
   The West Germans also were taken to task for their response to
U.S. intelligence reports alleging that West German companies helped
Libya develop a chemical weapons potential.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., accused Bonn of ``benign neglect'' in
the Libyan scandal and suggested senior West German officials have
been lying to cover up their culpability.
   On Sunday, the conference focused on the new and mounting threats
to alliance unity posed by Gorbachev's ``charm offensive'' in the
West.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner raised the concern voiced
by many other influential defense strategists that Gorbachev could
fail and be replaced by a far more conservative leader.
   ``We cannot entrust our security to one person alone or to
intentions,'' Woerner said. ``Both can change overnight.''
   Britain's defense secretary, George Younger, warned that the West
was ``being offered disarmament by the leader of the nation that has
been arming and rearming for years.''

   A military transport flying 18 Canadian
special services soldiers to the U.S. military's massive ``Brim
Frost'' exercises crashed late Sunday, killing at least seven
aboard, authorities said.
   The Hercules C-130 carrying eight crewmen and 10 paratroopers
crashed into a snowbank and broke in two just short of the runway at
Fort Wainwright's airfield southeast of Fairbanks, said U.S. Army
Capt. Jim Rodgers.
   The crash killed at least seven, said Rodgers. Army Maj. Sherrell
Mock initially reported nine dead.
   Five were seriously injured and six sustained minor injuries,
said Army Maj. Jim Tillman. They were being treated at Bassett Army
Community Hospital.
   It was to have been the second of three Canadian planes to land
at the airport, authorities said.
   The plane's last contact with the control tower was at 6:47 p.m.
(10:47 p.m. EST). It crashed a few minutes later.
   With temperatures at minus 48 degrees, emergency vehicles
careened through heavy ice fog to reach the crash site.
   There was no evidence of fire.
   The first of the three Canadian planes landed safely at
Wainwright. The third Canadian plane was diverted to Fairbank's
civilian airport.
   Canadian Forces spokesman Maj. Luigi Rossetto in Edmonton,
Alberta, said the plane had left from Edmonton's Namao Base.
   The soldiers belonged to Force Mobile Command and were part of a
500-man paratroop force that was to support the 1st Brigade, 6th
Infantry Division (Light), in a major land battle that is the
centerpiece of the Brim Frost ground exercises near Fairbanks.
   About 26,000 servicemen, 120 aircraft and 1,000 vehicles from the
U.S. Army, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, reserve
units and Canadian Forces are participating in Brim Frost '89. The
$15 million cold-weather training exercise began Jan. 20, and is
scheduled to continue through Feb. 1.
   The giant C-130s, which have wingspans of more than 130 feet, is
a workhorse of the military fleet and is used to transport troops
and equipment. They were first delivered in 1956 and have been
involved in several crashes in recent years.
   In June, a C-130 plunged into a soybean field and burst into a
fireball about a mile short of the airport in Greenville, Miss.,
killing six Air National Guardsmen aboard as they completed a series
of touch-and-go landings.
   A C-130 practicing touch-and-go landings crashed in September
1986 at Fort Campbell, Ky., killing three of the five National
Guardsmen aboard. A survivor said the plane had lost an engine.
   In March 1985, a C-130 from Little Rock crashed near Fort Hood,
Texas, killing six crewmen.
   Before that, seven airmen were killed when a C-130 exploded and
crashed near Judsonia, Ark., on May 12, 1982.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega can expect
little support from Nicaragua's business community _ support he
sorely needs to salvage an economy in crisis _ as he unveils his
government's economic plan for 1989.
   The austerity package Ortega was to announce today reportedly
includes a three-month wage and price freeze aimed at curbing
inflation, which the president says reached 20,000 percent last year.
   The Sandinista government has desperately sought the support of
capitalists and workers to brake Nicaragua's rapid slide into
economic chaos.
   ``There's a general awareness that the problem belongs to the
whole country,'' and that the government alone cannot rescue the
economy, said Bayardo Arce, a member of the ruling Sandinista
National Directorate.
   ``We must establish a harmony of interests, outlining the
responsibilities of the government, private enterprise and workers,
so we can face the country's problems,'' he said in an interview.
   On Dec. 31, the president announced sweeping budget cuts for the
Defense Ministry and security forces. The government has not said
how many jobs will be eliminated as a result of the cuts.
   Opposition leader Enrique Bolanos, a cotton grower and former
president of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, said
Nicaraguan business leaders would not support the plan because they
distrust the Sandinistas.
   ``The government is saying to us, `We're drowning, toss us a
lifesaver,''' Bolanos said in an interview. ``But this time all
we're going to throw them is an anvil, so they finish sinking.''
   Ortega has fared little better with labor organizations.
   A meeting Saturday between Ortega and labor groups that was to be
open to the news media suddenly was closed, indicating negotiations
were not going as smoothly as the president had hoped.
   During a similar meeting Jan. 15, which was open to the media,
labor leaders complained about numerous layoffs of government
workers.
   Sharp currency devaluations and official price hikes have cut
Nicaraguans' purchasing power. This month, the official exchange
rate has gone from 920 cordobas to the dollar to 2,300 cordobas per
dollar. The minimum wage is 3,748 cordobas a day, about $1.63.
   The price of a liter of milk rose from about 54 cents at the
beginning of the month to 87 cents. Effective today, a gallon of
gasoline sells for $2.08, up from 87 cents.
   The Sandinistas blame Nicaragua's economic crisis on the war with
U.S.-supported Contra rebels that began in 1981. The two sides
signed a tentative cease-fire in March, but a permanent truce
remains elusive.
   The government also says Nicaragua's economy has suffered from a
U.S. trade embargo imposed in 1985, and Hurricane Joan, which
devastated the country in October.
   Opposition leaders cite poor government management and planning
for the state of the economy.
   Since riding a 1979 revolution to power, the Sandinistas have
seized many private businesses, and foreign and domestic investment
has plummeted. Under U.S. pressure, Western lending agencies have
halted Nicaragua's access to funds because of its ties to the Soviet
Union.

<HEAD>Investigation Of Alleged Wiretaps Under Way In Cincinnati</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city and a grand jury are investigating
allegations that the phone company and police illegally wiretapped
hundreds of phones, including those of Black Muslims, a federal
judge and a billionaire.
   The taps, the subject of a U.S. District Court trial that began
last month, allegedly were placed to allow police to monitor
investigations and to eavesdrop on suspected subversives.
   ``There are allegations that these things happened 10 years ago,
but I have a feeling that the evidentiary trail is cold,'' said
Mayor Charles Luken. ``The city doesn't have any records to indicate
that these things happened.''
   Still, the mayor has directed City Manager Scott Johnson to
conduct an internal investigation into charges that a secret
Cincinnati police intelligence unit cooperated with Cincinnati Bell
Telephone Co. on illegal wiretaps. A federal grand jury also is
investigating the allegations.
   Johnson said Friday he planned to hire private investigators to
help with the probe.
   But two of the nine city council members _ Democrat Peter
Strauss, and Republican John Mirlisena _ are calling for a special
prosecutor, contending that the city's plans are inadequate.
   ``To give it credibility it should be totally independent. The
only time our people should be in the room is when they are being
questioned,'' Mirlisena said.
   Cincinnati Bell and its parent company, Cincinnati Bell Inc.,
deny knowledge of such illegal eavesdropping or that they
participated in or authorized any such activity.
   The allegations were raised by two former Cincinnati Bell
employees _ Leonard Gates, a supervisor fired in 1986 for
insubordination, and ex-repairman Robert Draise, who quit as part of
a plea bargain in 1979 after he was charged in connection with an
illegal wiretap.
   Gates and Draise said Cincinnati Bell security officials ordered
them to install more than 1,200 illegal wiretaps between 1972 and
1984. The men said the wiretaps were put in place to help security
supervisors and Cincinnati police.
   Those whose telephones allegedly were tapped include a Black
Muslim organization, U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin of Cincinnati
and billionaire Cincinnati financier Carl Lindner Jr.
   Police officials have denied the wiretapping.
   But former policemen Harold Mills, Gary Simpson and Elmer
Dunaway, and former Hamilton County Commissioner Allen Paul last
year filed a $112 million lawsuit against Cincinnati Bell Inc., its
officers and directors and the phone company, alleging that their
phones were illegally tapped.
   The lawsuit, whose U.S. District Court trial began in December,
was filed as a class action on behalf of everyone whose telephones
might be shown to have been illegally tapped.
   Cincinnati Bell during the past two weeks responded with two
countersuits seeking a total of $4 million countersuit. One of the
countersuits denies any involvement in illegal wiretaps. The other
accuses Gates and Draise of lying and trying to hurt the company.
   Gates and Draise responded that Cincinnati Bell is merely trying
to get back at them for making their allegations public.
   The $112 million lawsuit recently was amended to include the city
as a defendant. The city filed a motion Jan. 26 denying the
allegations and asking that the lawsuit be dismissed.
   In a deposition, police Sgt. Howard Cade _ a former member of the
secret police intelligence unit _ said he participated in four
wiretaps while working for the intelligence unit. Cade, a 23-year
officer now assigned to the police communications section, said he
knew of no court authorizations for the wiretaps.
   Only federal judges may authorize installations of electronic
eavesdropping equipment.
   Cade reportedly received immunity from prosecution in exchange
for testifying before the federal grand jury.
   Some of the revelations in the depositions have been leaked to
Cincinnati news media. Lawyers for Cincinnati Bell and the city have
asked U.S. District Judge David Dowd Jr. to seal the depositions
from public access pending the trial. Lawyers for the news media
oppose those efforts.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains More Than One Yen, Stock Prices Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained more than one yen against the
Japanese currency for the second consecutive trading day today,
while stock prices plunged amid concerns over their recent sharp
uptrend, dealers said.
   The dollar closed at 129.73 yen, up 1.08 yen from Friday's
128.65-yen finish. It opened at 129.58 yen, and ranged between
129.55 yen and 130.03 yen.
   On Friday, the dollar shot up 1.13 yen.
   The dollar's rallies on overseas markets had made Japanese
investors realize its strength despite the lower-than-expected U.S.
gross national product figure released Friday, a dealer with the
Bank of Tokyo said.
   The dollar also gained despite dollar-selling intervention last
week by U.S. and European monetary authorities last week, he said.
   Other dealers said Japanese institutional investors were the main
dollar buyers, while speculative investors were only adjusting
positions.
   A dealer a major securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the majority of market players, not finding
incentives to change the direction of trading, bought dollars in
line with current market sentiment.
   On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department reported that the
nation's GNP, the total value of all goods and services, grew by 2
percent in the last quarter of 1988, down from 2.5 percent in the
previous three-month period. It grew 3.8 percent for all of 1988, up
from 3.6 percent in 1987, the department reported.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
plunged 111.57 points, or 0.35 percent, to 31,567.50. It had closed
Saturday's half-day session at a record 31,679.07 points.
   ``Investors were cautious over the index's recent sharp increase,
which already has pushed share prices quite high,'' said a Daiwa
Securities dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   While institutional investors remained on the sidelines,
individual investors bought low-priced smaller issues but failed to
reverse the market's decline, the dealer said.
   Investors also were nervous about recent fluctuations in foreign
exchange dealings, he added.
   Trading was moderate, with the first section volume estimated at
800 million shares.

   Americans favor tough new anti-terrorist
measures, including military strikes, to combat attacks against
international flights, but most say poor airplane maintenance is a
greater threat, a poll has found.
   The national Media General-Associated Press survey found that a
majority backed U.S. military strikes against countries that support
terrorists only if the support were proved and innocent civilians
were not killed.
   The poll found opinion sharply divided on whether military
retaliation would deter terrorists or spur them. But a majority said
the government can stem terrorism, and 57 percent said it is not
doing enough now.
   The survey of 1,162 adults had a 3-point margin of error. It was
conducted Jan. 4-12, after a terrorist bomb downed Pan Am Flight 103
over Scotland, killing 270 people.
   In response to the bombing, the Federal Aviation Administration
ordered U.S. airlines to X-ray all checked baggage on flights from
Europe and the Mideast. The poll found support for other steps, some
considerably tougher:
   _Ninety-six percent said foreign airlines should be required to
X-ray checked baggage.
   _Nearly three-quarters favored requiring airlines to hand-search
all checked baggage on international flights, even if that meant
passengers had to check in three hours early. That is the practice
on El Al, Israel's airline, which has long experience in
anti-terrorism efforts.
   _Half of those polled supported banning carry-on luggage on
international flights. Such a ban has been used sporadically by
British Airways on flights into Belfast, Northern Ireland, during
times of political tension.
   The survey also found some sentiment for greater public
disclosure of terrorist threats against airlines, even if the
threats are frequent and unverifiable.
   That issue arose when it was revealed that U.S. officials had
been warned before the Pan Am attack that a bombing was imminent,
but did not publicly reveal the threat. Officials said later that
announcing the threats could cripple the airline industry because
warnings virtually are received daily.
   Respondents were split evenly on the question. Asked if the
government should announce all terrorist threats it receives against
airlines, even if it gets them daily and cannot tell if they are
legitimate, 45 percent said yes, 45 percent said no. The rest
weren't sure.
   However, 57 percent said the airlines should be required to
announce all terrorist threats they receive. Thirty-eight percent
opposed such a requirement; the rest had no opinion.
   Even with their support for tougher security and disclosure by
airlines of threats, respondents did not view terrorism as the chief
danger to air travelers. A solid 64 percent said inadequate
maintenance poses a greater danger, while just 24 percent chose
terrorism as the greater hazard. Twelve percent had no opinion.
   On military responses to terrorism, 55 percent said the United
States should strike against other nations if it has proof they
supported terrorists who attacked Americans. That sentiment spanned
ideologies, but was backed more strongly by men, 64 percent, than
women, 45 percent.
   Still, nearly a third of those who supported military strikes
said they would change their view if the action might kill innocent
people. That left just 33 percent overall favoring retaliatory
strikes in which civilians could die.
   Moreover, an overwhelming 84 percent opposed military retaliation
if the United States lacked direct proof of another nation's
involvement, even if U.S. officials believed the other country was
involved.
   Opinion was split on the efficacy of military retaliation. Nearly
one-third said striking countries that support terrorism would only
increase the number of terrorist attacks, while a third said it
would be a deterrent. The rest either said it would have no effect
or had no opinion.
   Nonetheless, 61 percent said the United States can take steps to
reduce terrorist attacks significantly, and only 31 percent said the
government is doing all it can now to protect Americans from
terrorism.

<HEAD>Castro Said to Have Asked Khrushchev to Launch Missiles Against U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At the height of the Cuban missile crisis, Fidel
Castro was convinced a U.S. invasion was imminent and urgently asked
Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev to launch an immediate nuclear
strike against the United States, a key Soviet source reportedly
told some American colleagues.
   The Cuban leader was said to have sent his message to Khrushchev
after spending the night of Oct. 26, 1962 in the bomb shelter of the
Soviet embassy in Havana, so convinced was he that war was about to
break out.
   Castro supposedly told Khrushchev the invasion would come within
48 hours.
   The account from the Soviet source was relayed by Pierre
Salinger, who was President Kennedy's press secretary at the time of
the 1962 crisis. It came from a weekend meeting in Moscow of U.S.,
Soviet and Cuban participants and scholars who have studied the
world's brush with nuclear war 26 years ago.
   Salinger would not identify the Soviet official, who was said to
have imparted the information in a private conversation, and the
account was later denied by at least two Soviets who took part in
the conference.
   Among the revelations for Americans attending the session was a
Soviet general's disclosure that 20 missiles and warheads _ which he
said constituted one-third of his country's nuclear arsenal at the
time _ were on Cuba at the time. However, he and another Soviet
official said the warheads had not been mounted on missile launchers
and were not ready for firing.
   An American source said, however, that he and other former U.S.
officials learned for the first time at the conference that the
warheads not only were on the island but could have been mounted and
fired within hours. The source asked not to be identified.
   The New York Times today quoted unnamed Americans as saying the
report about Castro requesting the nuclear strike originated with
Sergei Khrushchev, son of the former Soviet premier. It said Sergei
Khrushchev subsequently denied making the comment.
   The report also was denied by Aleksandr I. Alekseyev, Soviet
ambassador to Cuba in 1962.
   Salinger, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press and
on ABC News, for which he is a special correspondent, said the
conference that brought together participants from all three sides
for the first time showed the world was ``closer to nuclear war than
we believed at that time.''
   Other participants said the discussions also disclosed the Soviet
nuclear arsenal was smaller than American intelligence believed at
the time and that there were four times more Soviet troops in Cuba
than the Kennedy administration thought.
   A Cuban official disclosed that 270,000 Soviet and Cuban troops
had been ready to go to war with the United States and that 100,000
casualties were expected, former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert
McNamara said Sunday.
   At a news conference wrapping up the conference Sunday, he said
the figures on Cuba's war readiness and casualty estimate were
provided by Jorge Risquet, a member of Cuba's ruling Politburo.
   McNamara said that of the troops, 40,000 were Soviet, four times
higher than U.S. intelligence estimated at the time.
   Risquet cited the figures to show his country seriously believed
that a U.S. invasion of his island was imminent. McNamara said no
such invasion was ever contemplated, but speaking of the Cubans, he
added: ``If I had been in their shoes, I would have believed the
same thing.''
   American officials have said they were never sure whether any
Soviet nuclear warheads had actually reached Cuba but that they
assumed they had.
   Col. Gen. Dmitri A. Volkogonov, director of the Defense
Ministry's Institute of Military History, said 20 Soviet nuclear
warheads were on Cuba during the crisis and another 20 were headed
there aboard a Soviet ship that was caught in the U.S. naval
blockade.
   Volkogonov made the remarks in a closed session of the conference
Saturday, and they were reported to the AP by Raymond Garthoff, who
was a State Department official at the time of the crisis.
   Garthoff, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said Volkogonov reported 20 nuclear missiles were on
Soviet territory targeted at the United States.
   The total stockpile of Soviet nuclear warheads designed to fire
on the United States at that time was 60, Garthoff quoted Volkogonov
as saying.
   Volkogonov said the warheads in Cuba were not ready for firing,
and Viktor G. Komplektov, a deputy Soviet foreign minister, said
their presence on the island did not mean they would be put on
launchers in preparation for attack.
   ``At no time, not before, not during the beginning of the crisis,
or in the most acute moments of the crisis, neither from the Soviet
command there in Cuba nor in Moscow was there, or could there have
been an order to mount nuclear warheads on the missiles,'' he told
reporters.
   Khrushchev eventually withdrew the missiles in exchange for
President Kennedy's pledge not to invade Cuba.

<HEAD>Second Woman Says She Performed Sex Acts For Swaggart</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A stripper performed explicit sexual acts for
Jimmy Swaggart while he was involved with a prostitute, Penthouse
magazine says, but the television evangelist's attorney called the
story a fabrication.
   Catherine Mary Kampen said Swaggart gained her trust as a
spiritual adviser, then emotionally manipulated her into acting out
his sexual fantasies, the magazine said in its March issue.
   ``The whole thing's made up,'' Swaggart attorney's Phillip A.
Wittman said Sunday.
   Wittman said Swaggart would file a libel lawsuit, probably this
week, against the men's magazine.
   ``Jimmy Swaggart doesn't even know Miss Kampen,'' said Wittman.
``He's never met her, never seen her.''
   Wittman said Swaggart was returning home to Baton Rouge from a
weekend crusade in Atlanta.
   According to Penthouse, Swaggart approached Kampen, a homemaker
and performer of striptease telegrams, at a roadside telephone in
July 1987.
   Kampen said Swaggart told her he could help her with her marriage
and personal life, and promised to help her financially while
demanding she perform sexual acts for him.
   Like Debra Murphree, the prostitute whose account Penthouse
published in July, Kampen claimed that Swaggart asked her to perform
explicit sex acts while he watched.
   Murphree said Swaggart wanted her 9-year-old daughter to watch
them have sex; Kampen said the evangelist asked to have sex with her
13-year-old daughter.
   Like Murphree, who said she was involved with Swaggart from
October 1986 until October 1987, Kampen claimed she posed for
Swaggart but kept her daughter away from him.
   Unlike Murphree, who said she and Swaggart attempted to have sex
one time, Kampen told the magazine she and Swaggart never had sex
during their six-month relationship.
   She said she asked him if he wanted to.
   ``And he said, `Oh sure, but that would be cheating. What we're
doing here is just playing _ it's fun and games, it's not cheating.
You understand that, don't you,''' Kampen quoted Swaggart as saying.
   Wittmann said his law firm conducted its own investigation of the
allegations after Penthouse asked about them more than a month ago.
   ``We advised Penthouse that in our view the story was a
fabrication, and we were under the impression that they were not
going to release the story,'' he said.
   ``They in fact had asked us for further information which we were
in the process of assembing for them,'' said Wittmann, adding that
he was shocked the story had been published.
   Last February, Swaggart confessed that he had sinned against his
church and his wife, but never gave specifics.
   Murphree has said Swaggart was talking about her, but Kampen said
she thought Swaggart was talking about her.
   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God in April because
he disobeyed the Pentecostal denomination's order that he not preach
for a year and returned to the pulpit three months later.

<TEXT>
   A retarded man who has spent nearly 32
years in a state mental hospital will soon be released because the
Utah Supreme Court says he was mistakenly ruled insane after he
confessed to a 1955 slaying.
   ``He was just a convenient suspect,'' attorney Brooke Wells said
of client Bernt Murphy, a 51-year-old man with the mental capacity
of an 8-year-old.
   Third District Judge Pat Brian is expected to rule by Feb. 6 on
how much freedom Murphy should be granted. Brian last week received
recommendations from a committee appointed after June's order by the
state Supreme Court to release Murphy.
   Wells said Murphy should fare well in a group home with other
retarded adults. But the man who supervised Murphy's treatment at
Utah State Hospital in Provo for the past seven years doesn't think
he'd be happy there.
   ``Personally, I think it is cruel to send him away after this
many years. We have taken care of his needs, cared about him and
loved him. It makes me a little sad to be required to kick him
out,'' said George Brinkerhoff, who also sat on the committee.
   Murphy was 19 when he was arrested in 1957 for questioning in the
rape of a 5-year-old Salt Lake City girl. He subsequently confessed
to the 1955 slaying of a 23-year-old woman he met while both were
students at a state training school for the retarded.
   Wells said there is little evidence linking Murphy to the slaying
of Jocelyn Hickenlooper and that had there been a trial before
Murphy was declared insane, he most likely would have been cleared.
   Wells said notes from the 1957 investigation convinced her that
police interrogators either suggested to Murphy that he was involved
in the Hickenlooper killing or posed questions in such a way that
the confused suspect just tried to satisfy them with his answers.
   As a teen-ager, Murphy lived at the State Training School, an
institution for the retarded in American Fork about 35 miles south
of Salt Lake City. He was released in 1957.
   ``There was no place in the state we could send him,'' school
Director Vernon Houston said in 1957. ``Utah has no institutions for
such people. ... All we can do is release them to society and they
remain there until they commit a crime which sends them to the state
prison.''
   In October 1957, Salt Lake City Police Chief W. Cleon Skousen
said Murphy had confessed to Hickenlooper's slaying during routine
questioning after the 5-year-old rape victim identified him as her
attacker.
   Skousen said Murphy told officers he had hitchhiked from the
school to Hickenlooper's Salt Lake City home the morning of June 11,
1955, and had asked her to go on a walk with him. When she rejected
his advances, he killed her by choking her and hitting her with a
rock, the chief said.
   The body was found two weeks later in a shallow grave 15 miles
from the Hickenlooper home.
   Until Murphy confessed, the crime had been unsolved and police
were heavily criticized. Then-Mayor Earl Glade said he was
embarrassed by police fumbling.
   Third District Judge Stewart M. Hanson declared Murphy insane
later in 1957, and ordered him sent to the state hospital.
   Murphy was entitled to a yearly review, but was repeatedly denied
freedom or even a hearing.
   In 1985, Wells took the case to the state's highest court.
   The years have not been kind to Murphy, the attorney said. A
strapping 6-footer in 1957, he now is a ``kind of a withered little
person,'' Wells said.
   Brinkerhoff said he believes Murphy is very much the same sort of
person he was three decades ago, and can be ``very caring and
loving.'' When there is a death in a family or a birthday at the
hospital, Murphy alone among the residents always buys a card.
   The committee was unable to predict the outcome of Murphy's
release, some members of the panel said.
   ``The problem I foresee is him running away and coming back to
us,'' said Brinkerhoff, noting that Murphy has no family or friends
outside the hospital.
   ``He has been told that being released is what he ought to want,
but it is very frightening for him,'' said Brinkerhoff. ``Some days
Bernt is excited to leave here and thinks he needs an apartment by
himself, but other days he just wants everyone to leave him alone.''

   Billie Dawn lives.
   The quintessential ``dumb broad'' of ``Born Yesterday'' has
returned in triumph to Broadway in a polished, perceptive and almost
perfect revival of Garson Kanin's comedy of political corruption,
circa 1946.
   Kanin's Washington fable is nearly indestructible, but it helps
that Billie, one of the most endearing and enduring characters in
modern American theater, is played by Madeline Kahn. Miss Kahn, who
hasn't been on Broadway in more than 10 years, is an inspired
actress who also happens to be very funny.
   Her Billie, the uneducated ex-chorus girl who makes good, is more
than comic. She's sexy, intelligent and just a little bit shy. You
get a sense of the uncertainty underneath her street smarts. Still,
it is Miss Kahn's bits of comic business that makes her so
entrancing.
   Watch Miss Kahn's entrance at the beginning of Act 1. Wrapped in
white fur and clutching a Valentine box of bonbons, the actress
teeters in on the highest of high heels. The funny yet flirtatious
walk is all showgirl, a woman on display for the appreciation of any
male who happens to be around.
   Or take a gander at the ferocious way she plays gin rummy _
forever rearranging her cards, squeaking out the title song from
``Anything Goes'' and then gleefully announcing when she has
trounced her opponent. Sublime.
   Kanin's play, which opened Sunday at the 46th Street Theater, is
a combination of Cinderella and Pygmalion. Billie is the mistress of
Harry Brock, a self-made millionaire junk dealer who has come to
Washington from New Jersey to bribe senators and influence
legislation.
   Brock, a loutish man, wants his girlfriend to learn ``couth'' so
he hires a young, idealistic magazine writer to educate her. Billie
learns too well. Before long, she is on to Harry's unpatriotic
schemes and able to turn the tables on the man who has kept her down
so long.
   Ed Asner, in a difficult assignment, blusters and bellows
effectively as Harry, the unrepentant heavy in Kanin's mortality
play. He's a pin-striped villain, unwillingly to believe that some
people can't be bought. Harry is crude, rude and more than a little
violent. When he slaps Billie, the audience gasps. Asner gets that
meanness exactly right without having the play slip into melodrama.
   Daniel Hugh Kelly as Billie's crusading tutor makes a fine
romantic foil for Miss Kahn. He's not wimpy or overly intellectual,
just the kind of guy you'd think Billie eventually would fall for.
   Franklin Cover, as the junkman's boozy yet realistic lawyer,
delivers with gusto some of Kanin's most acerbic lines about the
morality of Washington officeholders. John Wylie is all smarmy
venality as a corrupt senator, while a pop-eyed Peggy Cosgrave, as
the senator's priggish wife, has a wonderful bit of comic business
with Asner on a couch.
   As for ``Born Yesterday,'' it's apparent that the play is
fortysomething. Those four decades show in its leisurely exposition,
its large cast (12 actors in 15 roles), and particularly in its
forthright idealism. The comedy basks in the glow of confidence that
arrived with the end of World War II. Anything could be accomplished
if you worked hard enough and really cared.
   Since then, McCarthy, Watergate, Irangate, Pentagon scandals and
other Washington follies have frittered away the voters' faith in
elected public servants. Still, director Josephine Abady, who
apparently had assistance from John Tillinger during the later
stages of the play's long tryout tour, makes sure everything is
played straight. There's no condescension, even when the actors are
reciting dialogue that sounds like a lesson in civic responsibility.
   The suitable single setting by designer David Potts is an
expensive Washington hotel suite with the Capitol dome just outside
the window. Ann Roth has garbed Miss Kahn in a variety of costumes
with just the right amount of show-business gaudiness, expensive
glad rags an ex-chorus girl definitely would wear.
   When ``Born Yesterday'' first opened on Broadway more than 40
years ago, it starred Paul Douglas and an unknown comedian named
Judy Holliday. The play, which ran for more than four years, made
Miss Holliday a star. She also appeared in the excellent film
version and won an Oscar. It's that memory that Miss Kahn, Asner and
others in this revival must compete with. They are all up to the
task.
   In other reviews:
   The Daily News' Howard Kissel wrote: ``In our cynical era, the
play's uncomplicated idealism makes it even more moving. What made
`Born Yesterday' an instant hit, of course, was not its faith in the
common man, but its brilliant humor, which the revival serves
beautifully. ... At times the pace slackens. ... Quibbles aside,
it's great to have one of the best of American plays back on
Broadway.''
   Clive Barnes wrote in the New York Post: ``It's Comedy Tonight.
... Both (Asner) and Miss Kahn play the game as if it were a hand of
gin rummy, and both of them very well know the deal. They are
delicious.''
   But Frank Rich of The New York Times wrote: ``The required
freshness is entirely absent from the elephantine current
production, which, arriving in New York after an extended road tour,
lumbers about the stage like a dusty old Packard in search of a
100,000-mile overhaul.''

<HEAD>Jackson's Half-Brother Convicted of Accessory Charge In Stabbing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors say physical evidence was lacking
in the murder and conspiracy case against Chicago millionaire Noah
Robinson, who was convicted as an accessory in the stabbing of a
gangland murder witness.
   Robinson, the half-brother of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, received
the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison following Saturday's
conviction of accessory after the fact of a felony.
   State Circuit Judge James E. Moore declared a mistrial on the
other charges against the 45-year-old Greenville native: murder,
conspiracy to commit murder, criminal conspiracy and accessory
before the fact of assault and battery with intent to kill.
   Solicitor Joe Watson said Robinson would be retried on those
charges.
   Defense attorneys said they would appeal. An appeal bond of
$100,000 was set, and Moore reinstated bond of $100,000 on the other
charges.
   The murder and murder conspiracy charges stemmed from the 1986
shooting death here of childhood friend and former employee Leroy
``Hambone'' Barber. The criminal conspiracy and accessory charge
resulted from the 1987 stabbing of Janice Denise Rosemond, who
witnessed Barber's slaying by reputed Chicago gang members. Ms.
Rosemond survived.
   Jurors, who deliberated for 16 hours over three days, said after
the trial that the Rosemond portion of the case was bolstered by
physical evidence, but the Barber portion was not.
   They said panel members leaned against convicting Robinson of
murder and conspiracy because some didn't believe prosecution
testimony by former members of the El Rukns, a powerful Chicago
gang. Three former gang members charged with murder in Barber's
death testified on condition the prosecution not seek the death
penalty against them.
   ``I just was expecting a whole lot more evidence,'' said Monica
Burrell, who voted to acquit Robinson of the Barber charges.
``Basically what they had was a bunch of testimony from gang
members, and I just found it hard to base my opinion on that.''
   A juror who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Greenville
News the panel convicted Robinson on the accessory charge because of
physical evidence that the businessman's associate Holandus ``Jake''
Oliver wired money to relatives of Freddie Sweeney, who was charged
with assault and battery with intent to kill Ms. Rosemond.
   Sweeney, a former employee of Robinson, testified that Robinson
offered him $5,000 to kill Ms. Rosemond because she reportedly
testified about Barber's murder before a grand jury in Chicago.
   Watson placed into evidence copies of money orders wired from
Robinson to Sweeney after Sweeney allegedly attacked Ms. Rosemond.
   Robinson, whose business interests include a construction
company, has maintained that he is a victim of a political
conspiracy caused partly by Jackson's success.

<HEAD>Pope Criticizes Abuses in Church Functions by Lay People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today warned against
excessive use of lay people in priestly functions and said the
Vatican is studying the entire question of non-ordained ministries.
   In a 196-page document on the role of the laity in church and
society, the pope also urged women to play a greater role in the
church _ though not as priests _ and said the Vatican was tightening
control over lay movements and organizations.
   The 42,000-word document, entitled ``The Lay Members of Christ's
Faithful People,'' is the pontiff's response to issues raised by
Roman Catholic bishops from around the world at the 1987 synod on
the laity at the Vatican.
   The synod, which convenes every few years to advise the pope on
various issues facing the church, was dominated by the women's issue
and the question of non-ordained ministries. These include lector,
acolyte and altar server _ people who assist during Mass.
   During the synod, U.S. bishops made proposals to open up
non-ordained ministries to women. Others, especially African
bishops, opposed the idea.
   Under church law, women are barred from those functions. But in
the United States and some other countries, women and girls
sometimes fill those roles informally, without installation.
   In his document, the pope disclosed that a commission had been
formed to study the entire question of lay ministries. Until the
commission completes its work, he urged local churches not to act on
their own, saying they should ``faithfully respect'' the current
regulations.
   The pope said the distinction between clergy and laity is
sometimes blurred, leading bishops to criticize the
``too-indiscriminate use of the word `ministry'...the lack of
observance of ecclesiastical laws and norms...and the tendency
towards a `clericalization' of the lay faithful.''
   He said there have been abuses of the church law allowing laymen
to carry out certain functions in ``situations of emergency and
chronic necessity,'' such as lack of priests or deacons. These
functions include presiding over liturgical prayers, conferring
baptism and distributing communion.
   The pope said pastors should exercise ``maximum care'' in
assigning these roles to lay people.
   A senior Vatican official said the pope appeared to be firing
``warning shots'' indicating there could be more controls over
non-ordained ministries rather than a decision to open them to women.
   ``He's certainly not saying, `Hold on girls, your time is
coming,''' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``The statements tend more toward a restrictive presence of lay
people in ministries.''
   The pope devoted 17 pages to the role of women but broke no new
ground in his position, most recently set out in his document ``On
the Dignity of Women'' issued in September.
   He condemned all discrimination against women but reaffirmed that
they cannot be ordained as priests.
   The pope praised the ``decisive'' role that women have played
throughout the history of the church, adding, ``It is necessary that
this history continue, indeed that it be expanded and
intensified....''
   John Paul said women can play a greater role in decision-making,
noting that church law allows them to serve on various diocese-level
councils. At the same time, he noted that some bishops had expressed
concern that focusing on women would neglect the role of men.
   ``In reality various sectors in the church must lament the
absence or the scarcity of the presence of men, some of whom
abdicate their proper church responsibilities, allowing them to be
fulfilled only by women,'' the document says.
   The pope also addressed the bishops' concerns about lay
movements, which have become more vocal in recent years, especially
in Europe and Latin America.
   The pope said there is a need for ``clear and definite criteria
for discerning and recognizing such lay groups,'' including
guidelines calling for ``strong and authentic communion'' with the
pope and conformity to church teaching.
   He said the Vatican is preparing a list of officially approved
associations.
   The document touched on many of the pope's familiar themes,
urging lay people to work for peace, justice, human rights and
religious freedom and to combat secularism, atheism and abortion.

<HEAD>Councilman Says Supreme Court Ruling A Blow To Black Community</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down
an ordinance mandating city contracts for minority companies could
boost unemployment and violent crime here, a black business leader
says.
   The Supreme Court last Monday ruled that the ordinance, which
requires that 30 percent of the value of all city contracts be set
aside for minority companies, unconstitutionally discriminated
against whites.
   The ruling ``is going to ruin quite a few businesses and it is
devestating to the economic fiber of the black community,'' said
Gladys Jackson-Weston, executive director of the Metropolitan
Business League, the leading black business association in the
Virginia capital.
   ``There will be an increase in unemployment and welfare ... the
murder rate in the city is now tied to economics and folks who have
lost their dreams, and we'll have more people out there who have
lost their dreams,'' Ms. Jackson-Weston said recently.
   There are nearly 1,000 minority-run contractors and related
businesses in the metropolitan area, Ms. Jackson-Weston said. She
said she believes one-third of that number won't survive without the
ordinance.
   She said her group would step up training of minority contractors
on keeping books, using computers and reducing overhead.
   Former Mayor Henry L. Marsh III, who was instrumental in pushing
the ordinance through in 1983, believes the ruling will prolong
discrimination in the traditionally white-dominated construction
industry.
   ``It's a big blow,'' Marsh said. ``Discrimination against
minority constructors is a serious problem in Richmond as in other
communities.
   Marsh, now a city councilman, and other city officials point to
statistics as proof the ordinance was needed.
   Richmond's population of 632,015 is 52 percent minorities,
according to City Manager Robert C. Bobb. Before the ordinance took
effect, less than 1 percent of the city's construction work was
awardedm to minority companies, Bobb said.
   While the ordinance was in effect, minority companies were
awarded about 40 percent of the city's work. Since its suspension in
July 1987, the percentage has dropped back below 2 percent, Bobb
said.
   ``There has been little or no progress,'' he said. ``I find that
very discouraging. Without the program in place we're furthering a
very closed system. Firms that are historically locked out will
continue to be locked out.''
   ``Obviously people wanted to do the work,'' Marsh said. ``They
did it when the ordinance was in effect. There were no complaints
that the work was not done well or that there was an inordinate
expense.''
   At least one minority contractor believes the ruling will ruin
his business, which employs nine people.
   ``I was expecting it to go the other way,'' said Merlin Hargrove
of United Unlimited Construction Co. ``I guess the only thing you
can do is pray.''
   Marsh said City Council members are discussing possible
affirmative action programs that would conform with the high court's
ruling.
   John Payton, a Washington attorney who represented Richmond
before the Supreme Court, said the city would have to comply with
the court's order that it make detailed findings of specific
discrimination before implementing a program that includes any kind
of racial preference.
   ``You have to make rigorous findings of discrimination,'' he
said. ``We thought we showed it. But the court said the numbers
don't matter. You have to find actual evidence.''
   Payton said he thought the city would be able to prove actual
discrimination to meet the court's standards.

<HEAD>Young Woman Apparently Killed By Shark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXNARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young woman whose battered body was found
floating in the Pacific off Channel Island Harbor probably was
killed by a shark, authorities said.
   The body of the unidentified woman 18 to 26 years old was spotted
Saturday by the crew of a sailboat six miles from the island.
   She apparently had been dead one to two days, said Dr. F. Warren
Lovell, Ventura County coroner.
   A 13-inch piece of flesh was missing from the woman's left thigh,
said Lovell, who described the wound as a ``classic shark bite.''
   ``There were a number of other shark bites. There was a fresh
bruise on the back of her right hand,'' he said Sunday.
   Lovell said the bruise appeared to have been caused when the
woman tried to fight off the attacking shark in the ocean 50 miles
northwest of Los Angeles.
   Lovell said her lungs ``did not show the classic findings
associated with drowning'' but the bites apparently occurred before
the woman died.
   Authorities said the woman may have been windsurfing as Southern
California was having warm and sunny weather.
   A check of law enforcement agencies showed no missing person
report who matched the woman's description, said Lovell.
   The last fatal shark attack off California was in September 1984
when an abalone diver was mauled 40 miles south of San Francisco.
   John McCosker, a shark expert and director of the Steinhart
Aquarium in San Francisco, said the latest attack may have been by a
Great White shark, which have been known to exceed 20 feet and 3{
tons.
   ``If this was in fact a Great White attack, it would be the first
that we know of to have occurred south of Santa Barbara,'' McCosker
said.

   Riot police charged into crowds of
radical students, who hurled firebombs and screamed ``American
troops get out!'' as they tried to march through Seoul to demand the
removal of U.S. troops.
   Several troopers were set on fire in Sunday's protest as the
bombs exploded in balls of orange flame. Armored vans sprayed tear
gas at the protesters and police had to charge three times to block
them from marching through the city.
   Police officials had no immediate word on arrests or injuries.
They said 10,000 police were deployed across Seoul to block the
protest.
   The violence Sunday began when about 6,000 labor union activists
and radical students tried to march to the city center following
separate rallies.
   Workers and students, marching to the beat of brass gongs and
drums, called for the fall of President Roh Tae-woo's administration
and the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan on corruption
charges.
   Police halted the marchers after several hundred yards. Shoving
and pushing occurred, but the marchers could not get through.
   Students then attacked police. Fighting lasted more than one
hour. The labor activists, who were protesting against the
government's alleged exploitation of workers to produce cheap
exports, did not take part.
   Earlier Sunday, several youths hurled firebombs at a court
building and yelled radical slogans before fleeing, police said. The
bombs caused slight damage but there were no reports of injuries,
they said.
   Dissident leaders who addressed the student rally, which
attracted fewer than 2,000 people, demanded the removal of the
42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense
treaty.
   They also demanded an immediate end to annual U.S.-South Korean
military exercises. The drills practice bringing in U.S.
reinforcements in the event North Korea invades again. The communist
North's 1950 invasion started a three-year war.
   The radicals, who lack broad public support, contend the United
States supports military rule in South Korea and keeps troops in the
nation to block reunification with the North.
   Roh, a former general, took office in February 1988 after winning
presidential elections. He succeeded Chun, another former general,
who took power with military backing in 1980.

<TEXT>
   Strong winds blew across the eastern slopes of the Rockies in
Montana, and Santa Ana winds whipped through Southern California
today as rain fell across much of the rest of the nation.
   The Montana winds gusted up to 65 mph Sunday, and were expected
to top 70 mph today. High winds were also forecast for the mountains
of northwest Wyoming, where a high wind watch was in effect.
   Santa Anas gusted to 30 mph at Fontana and Banning in California,
where a wind advisory remained in effect for valleys and areas below
mountain passes.
   Showers and some thunderstorms extended along a cold front from
southeast Texas to northern Louisiana, middle Tennessee and West
Virginia.
   Rain fell in southern New England, while freezing rain and snow
fell in parts of northern New England. Drizzle and fog extended
across much of the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley.
   Temperatures remained mild in the eastern two-thirds of the
nation. But Alaskans struggled with frozen pipes, food and fuel
shortages and wind chills of minus 125 degrees in a record cold
spell that showed no sign of relaxing its 2-week-old icy grip.
   The coldest place in the state Sunday was McGrath 150 miles west
of Mount McKinley, where it was minus 64. It was 61 below zero in
Tanana, 60 below in Fairbanks and minus 45 in Deadhorse. In
Anchorage, the temperature was 30 below, the coldest January day
since 1975.
   A high-pressure system with clear skies, stinging cold and wind
heading southeast from Alaska's interior, and another high-pressure
system moving toward Alaska from Siberia threatened to prolong the
cold snap.
   Elsewhere, today's forecast called for scatered showers and
thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast; showers extending from much of
the Atlantic Coast to the southern Appalachians and the Tennessee
Valley; snow in northern Maine; and rain along the coast of
Washington state.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 20s in southern Idaho;
30s and 40s from the northern and central Rockies to the northern
Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, upper Ohio
Valley and northern New England; 50s and 60s from much of California
to the southern Rockies, Kansas, the southern Plains, Missouri, the
lower Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee Valley and from southern
New England to the mid-Atlantic Coast; 70s along Southern
California's coast and in southwest Arizona, southern Texas,
southeast Louisiana, Florida and along the southern Atlantic Coast.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 0 degrees at
Idaho Falls, Idaho, to 74 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<TEXT>
   Officials in Boston and Atlanta fear some affirmative action
programs may be jeopardized by the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling
against a racial quota system for government contracts, but leaders
elsewhere hope slightly different plans will survive.
   In a 6-3 vote last Monday, the Supreme Court struck down a
program in Richmond, Va., that required white-owned companies
bidding on any city contract to set aside 30 percent of the
contract's value for minority-owned subcontractors.
   The high court said rigid racial quotas must be supported by
evidence; for example, that black-owned enterprises tried to obtain
construction contracts but were denied them. Without such evidence,
the use of racial quotas violates the equal-protection rights of
whites.
   But many state affirmative action programs across the nation are
voluntary or have goals to aim for rather than mandatory targets for
minority participation in government contracts, or they were
instituted on the basis of evidence, said a sampling of officials
contacted by The Associated Press.
   Before Richmond's quota went into effect, less than 1 percent of
the city's construction work was awarded to minority firms,
according to City Manager Robert C. Bobb. Richmond is 52 percent
minority,
   During the life of the ordinance, minority firms were awarded
about 40 percent of the city's work. Since the law's suspension in
July 1987, the percentage has dropped back below 2 percent, Bobb
said.
   The Georgia Supreme Court is considering a challenge to Atlanta's
35 percent minority business enterprise program and officials of the
black-majority city fear the state court might take its cue from the
ruling in the Richmond case.
   ``The Atlanta program has almost exactly the same defects that
Richmond's has,'' said William O. Miller, president of the
Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative group challenging
Atlanta's program.
   Last year Atlanta awarded $24.9 million in jobs to minority-owned
businesses, 36.7 percent of all of its contracts. More than $300
million in city business has gone to minority contractors since the
35 percent minority participation goal was set in 1975.
   Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said he feared the ruling could
jeopardize some of his city's affirmative action programs in
development, hiring and contracts.
   An ordinance adopted in December 1987 required Boston to award 15
percent of all its contracts to businesses owned by minorities and 5
percent to businesses owned by women.
   Boston's population is about 35 percent minority. Minorities and
women received $27 million in city contracts in fiscal 1988, about
14 percent of the total eligible dollars, said Sheila Hubbard,
director of the mayor's Minority and Women Business Office. That
compares with $15.2 million in fiscal 1985.
   Michigan authorities, however, are confident the U.S. Supreme
Court will uphold their law, which requires 7 percent of all
purchasing and construction grants to go to minority-owned
businesses and 5 percent to go to businesses owned by women.
   State officials say they believe enough evidence about
discrimination was presented before the law took effect. ``It took
10 years of bill introductions and hearings to get it through the
Legislature,'' said John Roy Castillo, executive director of the
state Civil Rights Commission.
   A California program which took effect this month should survive
an expected challenge because it sets a goal of 15 percent for
minority participation in state business and a 5 percent goal for
women-owned companies, not an absolute quota, said state
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, the bill's sponsor.
   However, attorney John Findley of the Pacific Legal Foundation
said minority contracting plans in California have one thing in
common with the Richmond measure: ``There's no showing of past
discrimination and a program designed specifically to remedy it.''
   According to the state Department of Finance's population
research unit, California's 27.8 million population is 24 percent
Hispanic, 7 percent black, and 9 percent Asian and others. About 51
percent of the state is female.
   Baltimore requires prime contractors to subcontract 20 percent of
a project's worth to minority contractors and 3 percent to women,
but City Council vice president Jacqueline McLean said the city
addressed the high court's major objections to Richmond's law.
   ``We held lengthy hearings and established a clear and convincing
record of past discrimination against minority contractors,'' Ms.
McLean said. Baltimore is 54 percent black.

   Security has been tightened for the trial of
Richard Ramirez, the drifter accused of 1 Satanic slayings in the
``Night Stalker'' serial murder case that terrorized California four
years ago.
   Deputy District Attorney Philip Halpin was scheduled to give the
prosecution's opening statement today, six months after jury
selection began.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan told the 12-member jury to
anticipate two years of testimony.
   When the courtroom opens, spectators will have to pass through
metal detectors, similar to the devices used in airports. Ramirez
will be restrained by leg shackles while seated in court.
   Halpin requested extra security measures last August when the
Sheriff's Department informed him Ramirez had allegedly threatened
to kill him in court with a smuggled gun and then turn it on
spectators.
   Ramirez, 28, a pale, shaggy-haired drifter from El Paso, Texas
who was arrested after an angry mob chased him down, is charged with
13 counts of murder and 30 other felonies, including rape, robbery
and attempted murder stemming from the 1985 crime spree. He could
receive the death penalty if convicted.
   His trial was recently delayed by a controversy over the racial
makeup of the jury. The defense had accused prosecutors of
systematically excluding Hispanics and black women while the
prosecution had accused the defense of excluding whites and Asians
from the jury. Six Hispanics and six blacks were impaneled.
   The unpredictable Ramirez once yelled ``Hail, Satan!'' in court
and flashed an inverted pentagram, a five-point star often
associated with devil worship, on his palm. He has been more subdued
recently and taken to wearing black clothing and sunglasses that he
uses to peer at the crowd.
   The charges stem from a 1985 summer crime spree in which a
nocturnal killer entered homes through unlocked windows or doors,
raped women, killed both men and women with execution-style gunshot
blasts to the head and stole jewelry and other valuables.
   The killer was dubbed the ``Night Stalker'' by the press and fear
swept the city, then throughout the state as the crimes spread north
to San Francisco and south to Orange County, where Ramirez also is
charged.
   The crimes were especially gruesome. One of the victim's eyes was
gouged out and several females victims testified the killer made
them ``swear to Satan'' as they were being sexually assaulted.
   Ramirez was arrested after he was chased and beaten by an angry
east Los Angeles mob during the 1985 Labor Day weekend. His picture
had just appeared in newspapers as the prime suspect in the ``Night
Stalker'' crime spree.

<TEXT>
   In an office set in central New Jersey's
farmland, researchers are drawing blueprints for space communities
built from moon rock and powered by huge solar satellites.
   It may sound like science fiction, but Gregg Maryniak says such
dreams could become reality at the start of the next century.
   ``We're trying to change from thinking of space as a void to
thinking of it as a font of energy and material resources that makes
it a good place for people,'' says Maryniak, executive vice
president of the Space Studies Institute.
   Maryniak and Gerard K. O'Neill, a nuclear physicist and professor
emeritus at Princeton University who founded the institute in 1977,
are among those driven by the belief that man is rapidly consuming
the Earth's natural resources and making it uninhabitable with
pollution and garbage.
   They believe new energy sources could be developed in space.
   ``I see this kind of activity as one of the few bright rays of
hope in a situation that otherwise appears to be hopeless,''
Maryniak said in an interview at the institute, which is housed at a
former rocket engine plant.
   Since it's too expensive to carry materials into space,
scientists must develop construction materials that are already
available there, he said. The closest source is the moon.
   The private, non-profit institute already has developed three
prototypes of a ``mass driver'' _ a machine used to launch
baseball-size fragments of mined moon rock to a central collection
place in space. Maryniak describes the collection spot as a
``celestial catcher's mitt.''
   He says moon rock, composed mainly of oxygen, silicon and metals,
can be broken into building materials and fuel using solar energy.
   The latest mass driver is a tube 1{-feet wide and 500 feet long
that propels material into space at a rate of 1{ miles per second.
   The moon rock could be used to build solar power satellites that
would collect sunlight, convert it to electricity and beam it to
earth.
   Such satellites, up to 5 miles long and 1{ miles wide, could
produce as much electricity as three or four nuclear reactors and
provide all the energy needs of a city the size of New York or
Chicago, Maryniak says.
   Totally self-sufficient space cities could be built with
agricultural areas, controlled atmosphere, water supplies and
gravitational field. Such cities would house tens of thousands of
people and have trees, rivers and birds.
   Ivan Bekey, special assistant at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's office of exploration in Washington, said the
institute's projects are possible but probably won't be reality for
20 to 40 years.
   Maryniak said people will choose to live in space because of the
clean environment, greater security and the possibility of
customizing cities to fit specific needs.
   ``At first ... they are going to be in places where the
inhabitants are real pioneers,'' he said. ``The second generation of
people will think it's very normal and won't be particularly
interested in going back to see old Mother Earth.''
   Maryniak said the first step probably will be much smaller, and
could come in three years. Plans are under way to send a prospecting
capsule to the moon to determine whether there is ice at the poles.
Finding water would be a major breakthrough because it's needed for
life and rocket fuel.
   O'Neill worked with NASA in the mid-1970s to study the
feasibility of space colonies, Maryniak said. The space agency also
considered solar generators during the Arab oil embargo, but
abandoned them as too costly.
   Maryniak said a solar generator can be built from moon rock at a
fraction of the cost of building one with materials shipped from
Earth.
   In December, Maryniak traveled to the Soviet Union and signed an
agreement with the Moscow Aviation Institute, the country's leading
aerospace training institution, to perform joint research on the
effects of gravity, energy transmission and a lunar probe.

   An Israeli in a khaki uniform killed another man
and wounded a woman on a beachfront north of Tel Aviv today, then
fired randomly as he was chased by police and soldiers, police said.
A bystander was killed by a soldier giving chase.
   The gunman surrendered after he was shot by police, said Tel Aviv
police spokeswoman Ahuva Ivri.
   ``Police who arrived chased him. He ran away firing in all
directions and at police,'' Ms. Ivri said.
   Police and soldiers pursued the assailant for a few miles before
he was wounded and raised his hands in surrender, Tel Aviv police
commander Eli Yitzhaki told Israel radio.
   An initial report said the attacker killed two people, but Ms.
Ivri said one of the dead was a man accidentally shot by a soldier
during the chase.
   The shooting began just before noon on the beachfront in Tel
Baruch, an area known as a hangout for prostitutes about a mile
north of Tel Aviv's sprawling resort tourist center, Israel radio
said.
   The attacker first opened fire on a prostitute who was with a
man, killing the man and wounding the woman, Ms. Ivri said.
   She did not identify the assailant but said he was born in 1964
and was from Ofakim, a town in the southern Negev Desert.
   The man's motive was not known, said Ms. Ivri. She said it was
believed all the victims were Israelis.
   A man in his 20s, believed to be the assailant, was brought to
Ichilov Hospital with a gunshot wound in the foot, a doctor at the
hospital said.
   An initial report on the radio said the attacker was a
``terrorist,'' meaning a Palestinian assailant. But later reports
and police said he was Jewish.
   Yitzhaki said on the radio that police had an initial report the
man was wearing an ammunition belt, leading them to believe he was a
Palestinian guerrilla.
   ``We got armed forces in the area on alert and got out armed
soliders to deal with it,'' he said.

   A C-130 crashed into a snowbank and
split in two during a landing in a thick, icy fog, killing eight
Canadian soldiers heading to a major U.S.-Canadian military
exercise, officials said.
   The Canadian Hercules C-130 was carrying eight crewmen and 10
special service paratroopers from Edmonton, Alberta, when it crashed
just short of the runway at Fort Wainwright's airfield, said U.S.
Army Capt. Jim Rodgers.
   ``The weather was quite bad,'' said Rodgers. At the time of the
crash, he said, a thick, icy fog blanketed the runway and the
temperature registered around 60 degrees below zero.
   Six of the troops aboard were pronounced dead on arrival at
Bassett Army Community Hospital on the base and two others died
while receiving treatment at the hospital, Army Maj. Sherrel Mock
said.
   Three soldiers were in critical condition, one was listed as
stable, and the remaining six had minor injuries but were being held
for observation, Mock said.
   After the crash, Mock said, Canadian officials canceled their
forces' participation in the exercise, Brim Frost '89, and recalled
remaining Canadian aircraft and servicemen.
   Investigators, including explosives experts, examined the
wreckage overnight, Mock said. The plane's cargo included training
ammunition.
   The four-engine Lockheed Corp. turbo-prop aircraft, one of the
longest-running planes in continuous production, generally is not
designed for the cold weather, said H. David Crowther, vice
president of corporate communications in Calabasas, Calif.
   U.S. and Canadian investigators had not determined whether
weather caused the crash, Mock said.
   ``We've been landing aircraft for the past two weeks in the same
conditions,'' said Mock. ``The runway, as far as I know, was not
icy.''
   The troop transport plane's last contact with the control tower
was at 6:47 p.m. (10:47 p.m. EST). There were no distress calls from
the plane before it crashed a few minutes later, Mock said.
   The plane split in two after the crash and there was no evidence
of fire, Rodgers said.
   It was the second of three Canadian planes heading to the
exercises Sunday. The first landed safely at Wainwright; the third
was diverted to Fairbank's civilian airport.
   The plane took off from Edmonton's Namao Base, said Luigi
Rossetto, a Canadian Forces spokesman.
   The soldiers belonged to Force Mobile Command and were part of a
500-man paratroop force that was to support the 1st Brigade, 6th
Infantry Division (Light), in a major land battle that is the
centerpiece of the Brim Frost ground exercises near Fairbanks.
   About 26,000 servicemen, 120 aircraft and 1,000 vehicles from the
U.S. Army, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, reserve
units and Canadian Forces are participating in the cold-weather
training exercise. The $15 million exercise began Jan. 20 and is
scheduled to continue through Feb. 1.
   The giant Lockheed C-130, which has a wingspan of more than 130
feet, is a military workhorse that's used to transport troops and
equipment. First delivered to the U.S. military in 1956, they have
been involved in several crashes in recent years.
   In June, a C-130 plunged into a soybean field about a mile short
of the airport in Greenville, Miss., killing six Air National
Guardsmen aboard as they completed a series of touch-and-go landings.
   A C-130 also practicing touch-and-go landings crashed in
September 1986 at Fort Campbell, Ky., killing three of the five
National Guardsmen aboard. A survivor said the plane had lost an
engine.
   In March 1985, a C-130 from Little Rock crashed near Fort Hood,
Texas, killing six crewmen.
   That same month, two C-130s collided near a base in Edmonton,
killing 10 Canadian servicemen.
   On May 12, 1982, seven airmen were killed when a C-130 exploded
and crashed near Judsonia, Ark.

   A former Nazi SS soldier has shocked West Germans
by leading a tiny right-wing extremist party to a strong showing in
West Berlin state elections on a platform of ridding the city of
foreigners.
   Sunday's vote also will send two members of the Republican Party
to the federal parliament next year, the first time that the extreme
right will be represented in Bonn since 1953.
   ``Kick out the Nazis, foreigners stay,'' several thousand people
chanted as they marched through West Berlin late Sunday to protest
the Republican Party's success.
   In the balloting, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian
Democrats lost their majority in West Berlin's legislature and said
they now plan to form a governing coalition with the left-of-center
Social Democrats. Kohl told the ARD television network that he was
``alarmed'' by the showing of the Republicans.
   The 5-year-old Republican Party captured 11 seats in Sunday's
voting for the 138-member West Berlin state legislature. West Berlin
is considered a state under the West German system, but its
representatives in the national parliament have limited powers.
   Former Nazi SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber, the Republican leader,
had led a campaign to oust Turks and other foreign workers from West
Berlin. Foreigners make up about 10 percent of the city's population
of 2 million.
   West Germans often have expressed concern about the growing
number of foreigners in their country, but Sunday's vote provided
the most dramatic example in years of a major election success for a
party with strong opposition to foreigners.
   It was the first state election in West Germany since the October
death of Governor Franz Josef Strauss of Bavaria, the
arch-conservative who is credited with keeping smaller right-wing
extremists groups in check. Many people had predicted his death
would create the possibility for the smaller rightist groups to have
a shot at success.
   Schoenhuber, 66, told rallies during the election campaign that
the Christian Democrats were ``drifting further and further to the
left.''
   The Republicans won 7.5 percent of the vote on Sunday, according
to nearly complete official returns. The Christian Democrats won 38
percent of the vote and 55 seats, losing 12 seats from the last
election four years ago.
   Christian Democratic Mayor Eberhard Diepgen's coalition partners,
the Free Democrats, lost all 12 of their seats by failing to muster
the 5 percent of the vote necessary for representation.
   The Social Democrats won 37 percent of the vote for 55 seats and
the left-wing Alternative List party won 17 seats with a 12 percent
showing, a gain of two seats.
   Diepgen said the Republicans' successful bid to enter the
legislature ``should not be allowed to cast the city and its
residents in a false light.''
   West German news media reacted with shock to the results in West
Berlin.
   The Frankfurt-based Hesse State Radio broadcast a special report
today that which concluded that while the Republican Party showed
far-rightist tendencies, it was far from the Nazi party that gained
hold in Germany in the 1920s.
   The Republican Party was formed in 1983, and its previous best
success was a 3 percent share of the votes in 1986 state elections
in traditionally conservative Bavaria.
   Sunday's surprise success will send two Republican Party members
to the federal parliament after national elections next year. West
Berlin's 22-member delegation in the federal parliament can vote in
committee but has very limited voting rights in full sessions.
   They will be the first right-wing extremists in the Bonn assembly
since 1953. The German Reich Party had five members during the first
West German legislature starting in 1949.
   Just under 80 percent of West Berlin's voters cast ballots on
Sunday, according to television forecasts, compared with 83.6
percent in 1985.
   West Berlin is a separate state of West Germany surrounded by
East German territory. It was formed from Western zones of Berlin
occupied by the Allied forces in World War II.

   Following are excerpts from Pope John Paul
II's document on the laity from the official English-language text
provided by the Vatican:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On the role of laity in the world today:
   A new state of affairs today both in the Church and in social,
economic, political and cultural life, calls with particular urgency
for the action of the lay faithful. If lack of commitment is always
unacceptable, the present time renders it even more so. It is not
permissible for anyone to remain idle.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On lay participation in priestly roles:
   When necessity and expediency in the Church require it, the
pastors, according to established norms from universal law, can
entrust to the lay faithful certain offices and roles that are
connected to their pastoral ministry but do not require the
character of Orders.
   However, the exercise of such tasks does not make pastors of the
lay faithful: in fact, a person is not a minister simply in
performing a task, but through sacramental ordination.
   In the same Synod assembly ... a critical judgment was voiced ...
about a too indiscriminate use of the word ``ministry.'' The
confusion and the equating of the common priesthood and the
ministerial priesthood, the lack of observance of ecclesiastical
laws and norms, the arbitrary interpretation of the concept of
``supply,'' the tendency towards a ``clericalization'' of the lay
faithful and the risk of creating, in reality, an ecclesial
structure of parallel service to that founded on the Sacrament of
Orders.
   In the first place, then, it is necessary that in acknowledging
and in conferring various ministries, offices and roles on the lay
faithful, the pastors exercise the maximum care to institute them on
the basis of Baptism in which these tasks are rooted. It is also
necessary that pastors guard against facile yet abusive recourse to
a presumed ``situation of emergency'' or to ``supply by necessity,''
where objectively this does not exist or where alternative
possibilities could exist through better pastoral planning.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On lectors and acolytes:
   (A) Commission was established to respond to this desire voiced
by the Synod fathers, specifically to provide an in-depth study of
the various theological, liturgical, juridicial and pastoral
considerations which are associated with the great increase today of
the ministries entrusted to the lay faithful.
   While the conclusions of the Commission's study are awaited, a
more ordered and fruitful ecclesial practice of the ministries
entrusted to the lay faithful can be achieved if all the particular
churches faithfully respect the above mentioned theological
principles, especially the essential difference between the
ministerial priesthood and the common priesthood, and difference
between the ministries derived from the sacrament of Orders and
those derived from the sacraments of Baptism and Confirmation.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On lay movements:
   It is exceedingly opportune that some new associations and
movements receive official recognition and explicit approval from
competent Church authority to facilitate their growth on both the
national and international level.
   The Pontifical Council for the Laity has the task of preparing a
list of those associations which have received the official approval
of the Holy See, and, at the same time, of drawing up, together with
the Ponitifical Council for the Union of Christians, the basic
conditions on which this approval might be given to ecumenical
associations in which there is a majority of Catholics, and
determining those cases in which such an approval is not possible.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On women:
   In her participation in the life and mission of the Church a
woman cannot receive the sacrament of Orders, and therefore, cannot
fulfill the proper function of the ministerial priesthood. This is a
practice that the Church has always found in the expressed will of
Christ, totally free and sovereign, who called only men to be his
apostles.
   Above all the acknowledgment in theory of the active and
responsible presence of woman in the Church must be realized in
practice. With this in mind this exhortation addressed to the lay
faithful with its deliberate and repeated use of the terms ``women
and men'' must be read. Furthermore the revised Code of Canon Law
contains many provisions on the participation of women in the life
and mission of the Church: they are provisions that must be more
commonly known and, according to the diverse sensibilities of
culture and opportuneness in a pastoral situation, be realized with
greater timeliness and determination.
   An example comes to mind in the participation of women on
diocesan and parochial Pastoral Councils as well as Diocesan Synods
and particular Councils.

<TEXT>
   The Panchen Lama, the paradoxical figure many
Tibetans revered as a religious leader but despised for cooperating
with the Chinese, has died in his homeland. He was 50.
   Tibetan Buddhism's second ranking religious leader died Saturday
of a heart attack in Xigaze, China's official Xinhua news agency
reported.
   At the time of his death, the 10th Panchen Lama was vice chairman
of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, and honorary
president of the Chinese Buddhists' Association.
   He lived in Beijing but had traveled to Xigaze to officiate at
the opening of a rebuilt great stupa, the shrine that contains
remains of the fifth to ninth panchen lamas.
   It had been destroyed and the remains defiled during the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, when Chinese leftists destroyed temples and
persecuted many religious Tibetans.
   Unlike his superior, the Dalai Lama who fled into exile after a
1959 uprising against the Chinese, the Panchen Lama stayed and
backed the Chinese. But he refused to denounce his self-exiled
spiritual mentor and was caught in a dilemma of being trusted by
neither side.
   He also presented a dilemma to Tibetans, especially after he
became China's chief Tibetan spokesman for Sino-Tibetan unity and
denied charges by Tibetan exiles that their people continue to be
arrested and persecuted for voicing opposition to Chinese rule.
   ``Although he has been a collaborator with the Chinese, we
consider him a true Tibetan because he had no choice,'' said a
refugee in Dharmsala, the Indian home-in-exile to the Dalai Lama and
some of the 100,000 Tibetans who fled with him.
   On Sunday, exiles walked the streets of the city in a teary-eyed
daze and shopkeepers lowered their shutters in honor of the dead man.
   Despite his support for the communists, the Chinese jailed the
Panchen Lama for 20 months during the Cultural Revolution and kept
him under house arrest for nine years. He was allowed to return to
Tibet only in 1982.
   In the past several years, however, he began openly discussing
the sufferings of Tibetans since the communist army occupied the
sparsely populated mountain area in 1950.
   One of his strongest statements came last week. On Wednesday, two
official Chinese dailies quoted him as saying Tibetans have paid too
high a price for their development under the Chinese.
   He said Chinese communists' mistakes were greater than their
successes in Tibet. Some officials ``had completely forgotten the
tragedy (of the Cultural Revolution) and others had even begun to
repeat the mistakes,'' he said.
   The Panchen Lama also echoed the position of the Dalai Lama in
calling for more autonomy for Tibetans.
   The Dalai Lama has been recognized from the 15th century as the
spiritual and temporal ruler of Tibet, which remained a theocracy
until 1950. The Panchen Lama traditionally held the powerful post of
chief abbot of the Tashi Lump Monastery near Xigaze, Tibet's second
largest city.
   Kesang Tseten was born in February 1938 in Qinghai, the province
northeast of Tibet which also has a large Tibetan population. At age
3, he was named by Tibetan religious leaders as one of three
candidates considered possible reincarnates of the ninth Panchen
Lama, who died in 1937.
   After several years of wrangling, and championed by the Chinese
communists, Kesang was approved as the 10th Panchen Lama on June 3,
1949.
   It could take several years to determine the 11th Panchen Lama.

   U.S. diplomats lowered the Stars and

departing Soviet troops headed north in what one Moscow envoy said
could be the last truck convoy home.
   Afghan troops and Moslem guerrillas continue to fight for control
of the Salang Highway, the only road linking the capital and the
Soviet border.
   Insurgents based in Pakistan said Sunday that Soviet bombing and
missile attacks along the 260-mile highway had killed 600 civilians
and injured 1,200 in the past several days.
   ``The mangled bodies are still under the debris,'' the Afghan
News Agency, operated from bordering Pakistan by a guerrilla group,
said in a telexed statement.
   Official Radio Kabul, monitored in Pakistan, said Afghan troops
had carried out ``successful military operations'' with civilians
who want to keep the rugged Salang Highway open.
   Later in the day, a car bomb and a truck bomb injured several
people in the capital, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Not many'' people were injured, he said, but declined to give
the exact number or say exactly where the explosions occurred.
   Just north of Kabul on Sunday, a convoy of Soviet soldiers in
armored personnel carriers and trucks loaded with missile launchers
cruised through a Soviet bunker checkpoint as helicopter gunships
hovered nearby, offering cover.
   A Soviet diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said,
``This could be the last convoy.'' He refused to elaborate.
   Two fighter jets streaked overhead and disappeared behind the
snow-covered mountains just beyond the hills surrounding Kabul.
   The remaining Red Army troops apparently are leaving on transport
planes, completing a withdrawal begun eight months ago under a
U.N.-brokered agreement to end the Soviet's nine-year intervention
in Afghanistan.
   Moscow sent about 115,000 troops into Afghanistan in December
1979 to prop up Marxists who seized power in a coup the previous
year.
   Soviet diplomats in Kabul say the remaining 15,000 to 20,000 Red
Army troops could be gone by the end of the week, about 10 days
before the U.N. deadline of Feb. 15.
   The guerrillas are not a party to the U.N. agreement and have
vowed to overthrow the government of President Najib once the
Soviets are gone.
   At the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, American diplomats said they would
return once peace is restored in this war-torn counry.
   ``Today we leave at a moment that is both happy and sad,'' said
the charge d'affaires, Jon D. Glassman, after a flag-lowering
ceremony in the embassy's snow-covered compound.
   ``We are pleased that the people of Afghanistan are going to be
relieved of their suffering, but we know their struggle is not over.
The people of the United States are with them,'' he said. ``We will
be back as soon as the conflict is over.''
   At the ceremony, three Marine guards took down the U.S. flag,
folded it and handed it to Glassman.
   The State Department last week ordered the 11-member embassy
staff to leave, citing fears the Afghan army may not be capable of
protecting foreign diplomats once the Soviets leave.
   West Germany, Britain, Japan, France and Austria all have
withdrawn or are withdrawing their embassy staffs. Italy and some of
Moscow's East bloc allies are considering similar action.
   Glassman declned to say when the U.S. staff would leave Kabul
aboard a chartered flight to India. The airport was closed today due
to snow and fog.
   After the embassy staff departs, 10 Americans will remain in
Kabul. All are missonaries.
   The Afghan government has denounced the embassy closures as
unnecessary and aimed solely at encouraging the U.S.-backed Moslem
insurgents to intensify their fighting.
   At a Soviet checkpoint about 12 miles north of Kabul on Sunday,
Afghan soldiers paced nervously along the Salang highway as the
Soviet convoy rolled past.
   ``How's everything going?'' one Afghan officer was asked.
   ``Very bad,'' he said.
   Earlier Sunday, Afghan soldiers said, guerrillas had fired on a
convoy of about 350 trucks carrying flour, eggs, diesel fuel,
gasoline and other supplies down the highway to Kabul. One driver,
an Afghan, was slightly injured by a bullet that grazed his leg,
they said.
   The Soviets have assured the Najib government that they will
continue to provide military assistance after the last Soviet troops
return home.
   Tass said Sunday that a Soviet delegation led by Yuri Maslyukov,
a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo, had arrived in Kabul
for talks with Najib on Soviet economic aid.
   It said the discussion focused on how Moscow would help the
Afghans ``thwart the opposition's plans to establish an economic
blockade of the capital'' and that Moscow would supply food, fuel
``and essentials.''

<HEAD>Go After S&amp;L Officials Liable in Crisis, Senator Dixon Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials trying to bail out the fund that
insures deposits in federal savings and loan institutions should go
after executives of those institutions who contributed to the
problem, and get rid of unsound institutions, the chairman of a
Senate Banking subcommittee said today.
   ``We ought to be seeing to it that those people who are driving
around in Jaguars and have big yachts and belong to fancy country
clubs come up to the bar now and pay up,'' Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.,
said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``There are a lot of people that were executives of thrifts
around the country that are personally liable and we ought to be
getting after them,'' said Dixon, who heads the Banking subcommittee
on consumer and regulatory affairs.
   ``We ought to invoke safety and soundness rules against states
that are liberalizing investment laws for thrifts and endangering
the security of those institutions,'' he continued.
   ``And we ought to be putting some money into the FSLIC (Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. fund and reducing the number of
thrifts in the country, getting rid of the bad ones and supporting
the good ones.''
   Asked if there was any chance Congress would approve a proposal
floated by the Bush administration to charge depositors at banks and
S&amp;Ls a fee of 30 cents per $100 deposited to help pay for insurance,
Dixon said ``none whatsoever.''
   ``I haven't heard of anybody that likes the idea and I think that
idea is born dead,'' he said.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu said Sunday that the
proposal remains a live option despite widespread congressional and
industry opposition. He also said on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' that ``there are a variety of options being examined.''
   Noting that financial institutions have long paid a fee for
federal deposit insurance, Sununu said the plan under study was
simply a matter of ``taking the current fee and adjusting it to
affect the reality.''
   If financial institutions were to pass along such an increased
fee directly to depositors, American savers still would be getting a
bargain for having their savings insured by their government, he
said.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said on the same program ``that trial balloon of putting
a tax on deposits was really very foolish.''

<HEAD>First of Britain's Two Cruise Missile Depots Deactivated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOLESWORTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first NATO cruise missile base to
be disarmed under provisions of the intermediate nuclear forces
treaty was officially deactivated today.
   The depot, operated by the U.S. Air Force 303rd Tactical Missile
Wing, had been one of two in Britain for storing American cruise
missiles. The last of the base's 16 operational missiles and two
spares were removed in November.
   They were among the 2,700 Soviet and U.S. land-based nuclear
missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles to be scrapped by 1991
under terms of the nations' arms control treaty.
   ``To me, this is a milestone of the INF treaty. This was the
first operational cruise missile unit to be inactivated,'' said Maj.
Gen. Marcus Anderson, commander of the 3rd Air Force.
   However, he said, there is always a little sadness in seeing a
unit deactivated. ``A unit takes on an identity and a pride in doing
its job,'' Anderson said.
   The 600-acre site at Royal Air Force Base Molesworth in
Cambridgshire, 50 miles north of London, was designated as a depot
in 1980, along with Greenham Common in Berkshire, 50 miles west of
London.
   The depots were designated for the storage of 160 American cruise
missiles but Molesworth never reached its full complement of 64. It
will remain a U.S. base, although officials have not yet said how it
will be used.
   The Defense Ministry said the Greenham Common depot will close
later. The 96 missiles there are to be removed sometime this year.
   The cruise missiles began leaving England Sept. 8, less than a
year after they arrived at Molesworth. All were flown to Davis
Monthan Base in Tucson, Ariz., to be destroyed under the watch of
Soviet inspectors.
   The warheads do not have to be destroyed under the treaty, and
U.S. officials said they eventually will be returned to the United
States.
   The arms control agreement was signed by then-President Ronald
Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in December 1987 and
ratified by the U.S. Senate in June 1988.
   The Soviets began removing some of their SS-20 missiles targeted
at Western Europe in February 1988. The first American missiles,
nine Pershing 2s, were removed Sept. 1 from a base in West Germany.
   The first cruise missiles arrived in Europe in November 1983 and
were deployed at Greenham Common. The Molesworth missiles were the
last to be deployed, shortly before the arms control treaty was
signed.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Central Committee today
rejected demands to debate the resignation of party leader Stipe
Suvar, who then went on the attack against hardline policies
associated with his main rival.
   Opening a meeting called to discuss the resignation demands and a
possible shakeup in the ruling elite, Suvar criticized his chief
political rival, Serbian Communist leader Slobodan Milosevic,
without mentioning him by name.
   ``Socialist political pluralism or neo-Stalinism: those are the
two alternatives'' offered by different factions within the party
leadership as the way out of Yugoslavia's economic and political
crisis, the national party chief said.
   The meeting of the policy-setting body is shaping up as a
showdown between party liberals and the hardline coalition led by
Milosevic, the party chief in the largest of Yugoslavia's six
republics.
   Suvar today launched a scathing attack on what he called
``dogmatic'' policies generally attributed to the Serbian leader.
   Milosevic's supporters suffered an initial setback at today's
meeting. In a show of hands, participants overwhelmingly rejected a
Serbian proposal to discuss demands for Suvar's resignation.
   In the speech that followed, Suvar called for more ``political
pluralism, which is conditional on the competition of ideas.'' He
contrasted that with ``the dictatorship of the Communist Party''
which would use ``bureaucratic'' methods to run the country.
   Suvar and several non-Serbian Politburo members have recently
come under fire from Milosevic supporters for what they call
anti-Serbian policies and for denouncing growing nationalism in the
republic.
   Milosevic's supporters spearheaded a wave of nationalist Serbian
protests last year that forced resignations of party leaders in
several areas around the country. In addition to calling for party
and economic reform, the protesters demanded more Serbian control in
Kosovo province, where they say Slavs are threatened by an ethnic
Albanian majority.
   Suvar said growing nationalism creates worries for ``the survival
of Yugoslavia.''
   The late President Tito created the federal system that balances
the competing ethnic groups in a loose federation of six republics
and two nominally autonomous provinces.
   In today's speech, the party president painted the attack on him
and other ruling Politburo members as a clash between different
political and economic concepts of Yugoslavia's future development.
   The battle represents ``a fundamental dispute between reformist
and anti-reformist forces'' within the party, Suvar said.
   He is supported by the liberal northern republics of Slovenia and
Croatia, which favor increased political pluralism, more democracy
and radical market-oriented reforms.
   Yugoslavia's woes include a 250 percent inflation rate and a
sharp drop in living standards in addition to an alarming increase
in labor and ethnic unrest.
   Milosevic, who has called for more centralized party control over
the country's affairs, draws his support from Yugoslavia's poorer
southern regions.
   They fear that market-oriented reforms would end state subsidies
for sometimes unprofitable industries and lead to many layoffs and
more unrest.
   In a clear reference to the policies of Serbia and Milosevic,
Suvar said such people ``pay lip service to open markets and the
restructuring (of Yugoslavia's economy), while supporting obsolete
industrial plants and subsidizing giant, unprofitable factories.''

   Iran has deported a British technician for
involvement in illegal activities, an official report said today.
   Samuel Williams was ``arrested recently because of unlawful and
illegal activities and was expelled after being tried,'' said the
Islamic Republic News Agency. It did not elaborate on the alleged
offenses, nor provide dates of Williams' arrest, trial or
deportation.
   IRNA identified the deportee only as a ``technical expert'' who
worked in eastern Khorasan province for ``several years.''
   Williams is barred from returning to Iran for 10 years, when his
case will be reconsiderd, it added.
   Iran's relations with Britain, like those with most Western
countries, have been shaky since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
Islamic revolution toppled the pro-Western Iranian monarchy in
February 1979.
   Tehran and London restored diplomatic ties last November after a
17-month strain.
   A few weeks later, one of two Britons imprisoned in Iran was
freed. Nicholas Nicola, 23, was arrested in September 1986, near the
border with Pakistan and tried and convicted of illegal possession
of weapons.
   Nicola was sentenced to 3{ years' jail. Iran's official media
said he was released Dec. 7, 1988, for ``good conduct.''
   After his release, he told reporters he traveled to Iran from
Pakistan to join Afghan guerrillas fighting Soviet troops in
Afghanistan.
   Another Briton, Roger Cooper, 52, remains in jail in Iran.
Cooper, who worked in Iran for 20 years, was detained in November
1985 for overstaying his visa. He later was charged with espionage,
but no date has been set for his trial.

   An unmanned Soviet research probe is orbiting Mars
on a research mission to learn more about the planet's climate and
soil, the official news agency Tass reported.
   Phobos II went into orbit Sunday after a six-month,
111-million-mile voyage from Earth, Tass said.
   The spacecraft is carrying instruments and experiments prepared
by 12 countries and the European Space Agency. Soviet officials say
the mission will help them prepare for a manned mission to Mars in
the early 21st century.
   Phobos II was launched July 12 in an ambitious program to unlock
mysteries of the Red Planet and its largest moon, Phobos.
   The probe is supposed to record daily and seasonal temperature
changes on Mars, make a temperature map of the surface, and identify
areas where the soil is permanently frozen, Tass said. Data on the
planet's minerals and atmosphere also will be collected.
   The spacecraft is to approach within 50 yards of the moon Phobos
in early April to analyze its soil with a laser and drop two small
landing craft onto the surface.
   The Phobos program is the most ambitious of nearly 20 U.S. and
Soviet unmanned missions to study Mars, believed to be the planet
most like Earth after Venus.
   But problems have marred the $480 million mission.
   In September, a Soviet ground controller sent an erroneous
computer command to a sister ship called Phobos I. That spacecraft,
launched July 7, froze in space and ground controllers have been
unable to communicate with it.
   The probes carry similar equipment, but Phobos I also is equipped
to study neutron radiation and the magnetic field around Mars.
   Last month, Tass said some instruments aboard Phobos II had
failed but that most have been fixed. It said the problems would not
prevent completion of its research.
   Tass said Phobos II is the first spacecraft to orbit Mars.
However, U.S. officials say American probes orbited Mars during the
Viking missions of the 1970s.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who canceled
a visit to Cuba after a devastating earthquake in Soviet Armenia,
will travel to the island nation in early April, Pravda reported
today.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper did not give specific dates
for the trip.
   Gorbachev first planned to visit Havana in December after he
traveled to the United States to address the United Nations and meet
with the outgoing U.S. president, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush,
then the president-elect.
   He cut short his U.S. visit and returned home upon learning that
thousands of people had been killed in the Armenian earthquake that
leveled towns and cities on Dec. 7.
   The Soviet leader also had planned to visit Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher of Britain during that trip. Soviet officials have
not announced plans to reschedule that meeting.

<TEXT>
   Alaskans struggled with frozen pipes,
shortages of fuel and food and wind chills of minus 125 degrees in a
record cold spell that showed no sign of relaxing its 2-week-old icy
grip.
   A high-pressure system with clear skies, stinging cold and wind
heading southeast from Alaska's interior, and another high-pressure
system moving toward Alaska from Siberia threatened to prolong the
cold snap.
   ``Basically, we can expect the same kind of cold to continue,
with temperatures way below normal,'' National Weather Service
meteorologist Dan Keeton said Sunday night. ``Any increase in
temperature would be slight to moderate by the end of the week.''
   With the temperature hovering around 60 degrees below zero, a
C-130 crashed in a thick, icy fog Sunday night just short of a
runway at Fort Wainwright southeast of Fairbanks, killing eight
Canadian soldiers and critically injuring three others.
   ``The weather was quite bad,'' said U.S. Army Capt. Jim Rodgers.
However, Army Maj. Sherrel Mock said investigators had not
determined whether weather caused the crash.
   After the accident, Canadian military officials recalled defense
forces and aircrft that had been participating in an exercise with
U.S. forces.
   The Coast Guard, citing gusts up to 100 mph, icing and a wind
chill of 70 degrees below zero, canceled a port security exercise
Sunday at Whittier.
   A second, 1,550-mile test of an unarmed U.S. cruise missile over
northern Canada that had been scheduled to begin early today was
delayed because of the extreme cold weather, Canadian officials said.
   The coldest place in the state Sunday was McGrath, 150 miles west
of Mount McKinley, where it was minus 64. It was 61 below zero in
Tanana, 60 below in Fairbanks and minus 45 in Deadhorse. In
Anchorage, the temperature was a ``balmy'' minus 30, the coldest
January day since 1975, the weather service said.
   During the weekend, 17 all-time record lows fell across the
state, Keeton said. ``In Dillingham, they just shattered theirs,''
he said. ``It had been 36 degrees below; now, it's 53 degrees below
zero.''
   The normal temperature for January in Fairbanks is minus 13
degrees, according to the weather service.
   Wind chills down to 125 degrees below zero prompted warnings that
motorists avoid the heavily traveled Parks Highway that connects
Fairbanks and Anchorage.
   Other problems included fuel and food shortages, power outages,
frozen water and sewer lines, congealed fuel oil and grounded planes
in rural areas, state officials said.
   ``There are no immediate life-threatening situations ... but
there are some communities enduring considerable hardship and
inconvenience,'' the state Division of Emergency Services said
Sunday.
   Gov. Steve Cowper signed a declaration of emergency Saturday so
that state assistance funds will be more readily available if
requested.
   At King Cove on the Alaska Peninsula, residents with frozen fuel
lines were using open buckets of fuel with copper tubing to feed
furnaces, officials said Sunday.
   Mankotak officials said they were running out of heating fuel,
and Lower Kalskag on the Kuskokwim River was running out of fuel and
food.
   The cold weather and balky hydraulic systems slowed aircraft
refueling at Anchorage International Airport. Several freight
flights were canceled and 270 passengers aboard a Northwest Airlines
flight from Chicago to Tokyo were stranded; after landing in
Anchorage to refuel, an engine jammed, officials said.
   In Anchorage, firefighters trying to fight fires wrestled with
frozen pumps on their trucks and other cold-related problems.
   The cold spell heated up business for plumbers, who had long
waiting lists of people with frozen water pipes and balky furnaces.
   The Red Cross opened emergency shelters in Anchorage and at Port
Graham on the Kenai Peninsula. Residents of the Kodiak area borrowed
fuel from schools to keep warm.

   Scotland Yard refused to confirm or deny a
newspaper report today that three officers penetrated the grounds of
Buckingham Palace and eluded capture during a test of security for
the royal family.
   However, the agency said, security systems at the palace ``have
not been found wanting.''
   Today, a London tabloid, reported three officers climbed over a
wall at the palace two weeks ago, deliberately set off alarms and
then sat in a tree waiting to be caught. Although the intruders even
talked and smoked cigarettes, they were not discovered and
eventually left on their own, the newspaper said.
   Scotland Yard said the story ``was based on a recent exercise by
the royal palace's division officers at Buckingham Palace,'' the
royal family's official London residence.
   ``There will be no major security shake-up following this
exercise,'' Scotland Yard said in a statement.
   A Scotland Yard spokeswoman was evasive about the newspaper
report. ``We are not saying that it is totally false, and we are not
saying it is totally true,'' she said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A Buckingham Palace spokesman said they never comment on security
matters.

   Skid Row denizens snatched a purse, a wallet
and two jackets from three accident victims, including an off-duty
police officer, as the victims awaited help after a collision at a
downtown intersection.
   ``The homeless people descended on them like vultures going to a
piece of meat,'' police Lt. Dan Hills said Sunday.
   Two of the victims, trapped in an overturned truck, were hanging
upside down by their seat belts; the officer was briefly
unconscious, Hills said. The victims, whose names were withheld,
were slightly injured.
   The pickup truck, according to Hills, ran a red light and smashed
into the officer's car before midnight Saturday.
   ``As she's coming to, what she remembers is a door opening and
somebody asking `Are you OK, baby?' and she sees her handbag being
removed,'' he said.
   The bag contained her police revolver, badge and other personal
belongings. None of the items were recovered as of late Sunday,
Hills said.

   A cast of stars including Liza Minnelli and

Soviet Armenia.
   Most of the profit will be given to the Armenian Relief Society
for direct donation to victims of the quake that left about 25,000
people dead and 500,000 homeless.
   ``We can do what we usually do in life to raise money,'' Miss
Minnelli said Sunday before stepping into a recording studio at
Paramount Pictures. ``We can't do anything politically. When I saw

   Pia Zadora, Irene Cara, Connie Stevens, Ray Parker Jr. and
members of the Doobie Brothers and Toto were among the nearly 100
performers who collaborated on ``For You, Armenia.''
   The song was written by songwriters Charles Aznavour and George
Garvarentz and translated from French to English by Paul Williams.
   Michael Masser and Joel Cohen are producing the record and Peter
Bogdanovich and Laszlo Kovacs will film the one-hour documentary and

   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack. Saade's
party is a major force in the Christian camp that has been fighting
Syrian-backed Moslems in the nearly 14-year-old civil war.
   Also today, leaders of the country's Shiite Moslem factions
signed a peace treaty intended to end the nine months of Shiite
militia fighting in which more than 500 people have died.
   The official Syrian news agency said the agreement signed by the
Syrian-backed Amal and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah calls for an
immediate cease-fire. The pact also provides for the exchange of
prisoners, an end to hostile propaganda, formation of a joint
operations center in south Lebanon to counter Israel and creation of
a committee to regulate relations between the two factions.
   The Shiite battle has aggravated Lebanon's civil war and strained
ties between Syria and Iran. Previous cease-fires arranged by Syria
and Iran have fallen apart.
   Saade's motorcade was on a boulevard in the Furn el-Shubback
residential district when a red Renault packed with 110 pounds of
TNT blew up at 10:30 a.m., police said.
   About 10 cars were destroyed in the blast, including two vans
belonging to Middle East Airlines, the country's national carrier.
   An hour after the blast, Saade reassured his partisans in a
statement broadcast over the Phalange's radio station, Voice of
Lebanon.
   ``My car was destroyed but I wasn't hurt, praise be to God,''
Saade said.
   ``I don't believe I was the target of an assassination attempt
because no one could possibly have known that I was going to be
driving through this particular area,'' Saade added.
   ``The route I took this morning is not the road I usually take to
my office,'' Saade said. ``I decided only minutes before leaving my
house to take this route to visit (police chief) Brig. Antoine Nasr
to offer my condolences for the death of his mother.''
   He said he believed the car bombing was aimed at disrupting
efforts by the Arab League to resolve a political crisis that
threatens to formalize the partition of Lebanon.
   An Arab League committee is trying in Tunis to reconcile Moslem
and Christian government leaders to resolve the crisis that has
prevented parliament from meeting to elect a head of state.
   The term of President Amin Gemayel's, a Christian, ended Sept. 23.
   Elias Elias, commander of Saade's 12 bodyguards, told reporters
he and other surviving comrades ``ringed Saade's car, firing in the
air to prevent any one from approaching while we helped him out of
his damaged car.
   ``We then put him in another car and sped off,'' he added.
   It was the third car bombing in Lebanon this year. Eight people
were killed and 30 wounded in the two previous blasts since Jan. 13.
   Police say 116 people were killed and 488 wounded in 20 car
bombings in Lebanon last year.

<HEAD>Inmate Uprising Quelled At DeKalb County Jail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Less than four days after the DeKalb County
sheriff staged a political protest against jail overcrowding, his
inmates staged their own protest, setting fires and smashing
furniture.
   About 240 maximum-security inmates who staged a Saturday night
uprising at the DeKalb County Jail were returned to their cells
after cleaning up the water and fire damage.
   ``Sheriff (Pat) Jarvis ordered them down on their hands and knees
and whatever it took'' to clean up the mess, said Maj. Winston
Pitmann of the DeKalb County Sheriff's Department.
   The rampage _ at least the eighth disturbance in county and state
prisons in Georgia in recent weeks _ was quelled after about four
hours, when police entered the jail in suburban Atlanta and fought
hand-to-hand with prisoners.
   No hostages were taken and only superficial injuries were
reported.
   The jail, with a capacity of 920, was packed with 1,300 inmates
Saturday, about 250 of whom were awaiting transfer to the
overcrowded state prison system.
   ``It's been brewing. The tension's been building,'' Pitmann said.
``We knew something was going to happen. We tried to warn people.''
   Some inmates said the disturbance erupted in protest of their
dinner, chili, rice and green beans. ``We checked. That was just an
excuse,'' Pitmann said.
   On Wednesday, Jarvis took 69 nonviolent prisoners to the state
Capitol to demonstrate to lawmakers the need for new prisons. Gov.
Joe Frank Harris proposed budget includes no money for six new
prisons requested by the state Department of Corrections.
   ``I don't want a running feud with Gov. Joe Frank Harris,''
Jarvis said Sunday. ``The symbolic posture I took last week ... was
strictly business.''
   ``We all need to sit down and really look at a solution'' to the
prison overcrowding situation. ``And a solution has got to come
quickly.''
   Pitmann said no financial estimate of Saturday's damage has been
prepared. Some criminal charges may be filed following
investigations, he said.

   A Rembrandt and another
17th-century Dutch painting were stolen from a government art
warehouse, and police today arrested a warehouse employee and her
boyfriend as suspects, officials said.
   The two paintings, ``Man with Beard,'' a 1647 work by Rembrandt
and ``Winter Landscape With Skaters,'' a 1649 painting by Jan van
Goyen, were reported missing from the warehouse in this city on Jan.
20, according to police spokesman Nico Laterveer.
   Rembrandt, whose full name was Rembrandt van Rijn, is the
best-known of all 17th-century Dutch painters.
   The disappearance of the paintings was only made public today
``so as not to jeopardize the investigation'' Laterveer said.
   The two suspects, identified only as a 22-year-old administrative
employee of the warehouse and her boyfriend, remained in custody.
However, a search of their apartment failed to yield the paintings,
which remain missing.
   The incident was the latest in a series of art thefts in the
Netherlands that began last May, when three paintings, including a
work by Vincent van Gogh and one by French impressionist Paul
Cezanne, were stolen from Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum. Those
paintings were later recovered.
   On Dec. 12, three Van Goghs were stolen from the famed
Kroeller-Mueller Museum in the eastern Netherlands. No trace of
those three paintings has been found.
   Laterveer estimated the value of the latest two missing paintings
at between $474,000 and $711,000.
   They were reported missing from a warehouse vault containing
dozens of art works, according to Culture Ministry spokeswoman
Annemarie Stordiau.
   No traces of a break-in were found at the vault or the downtown
warehouse, which Ms. Stordiau described as ``very secure.''
   ``It all leads to the conclusion that somebody with regular
access to the vault must have taken the paintings,'' Laterveer said.
   He said the Rembrandt measures only about 10-by-9 inches and the
Van Goyen is only about 8{-by-9{ inches.
   ``Somebody could easily have taken the paintings out of the
building hiding them under a coat,'' Laterveer said.
   The warehouse is one of about 12 owned by the Government Art
Agency, which takes care of about 150,000 government-owned art
works. The agency gives the art works on loan to Dutch and foreign
museums, and its collection includes some of the valuable
17th-century Dutch master works on display in Amsterdam's
Rijksmuseum.

   Leaders of Shiite Moslem factions in
Lebanon today signed a peace treaty to end nine months of fighting
that have killed more than 500 people.
   The pact says Syrian-backed forces should control security in
south Lebanon and Moslem parts of Beirut, according to the official
Syrian Arab News Agency.
   The agency said the eight-point agreement was signed by Syria's
ally, the Amal militia, and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
   Fighting between Amal and Hezbollah has aggravated Lebanon's
civil war and strained ties between Syria and Iran. The inter-Shiite
fighting has been halted several times through cease-fires arrange
by Syria and Iran, but the battles have repeatedly broken out again.
   The latest peace accord was completed at a meeting in the Syrian
Foreign Ministry attended by leaders of the rival militias, Foreign
Minister Farouk Sharaa of Syria and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati of Iran. It followed a week of negotiations during clashes
in Lebanon.
   In what appeared to be a setback for Hezbollah, the Syrian news
agency said the peace agreement gives Amal control of security in
south Lebanon and emphasized that Syria is the sole security power
in Moslem sectors of Beirut.
   The report said the pact provides for an immediate cease-fire,
exchange of prisoners, an end to hostile propaganda, formation of a
joint anti-Israeli operations center in south Lebanon and creation
of a committee to regulate relations between Amal and Hezbollah.
   Asked if a peace agreement might open the door to freeing Western
hostages in Lebanon, Velayati said: ``We hope that all hostages,
whatever their nationalities, will be released very soon on the
basis of humanitarian aspects.''
   He did not elaborate. Most of the 15 foreigners missing in
Lebanon are believed held by Iranian-backed Shiite factions linked
to Hezbollah.
   However, Hezbollah leader Sheik Ibrahim Amin said Sunday that the
hostages are not linked to a peace accord. ``This matter has no
relation to us, nor with the agreement,'' he said.
   Velayati said before today's talks that ``Syria and Iran will
guarantee the implementation and fulfillment of the agreement''
between their Lebanese allies.
   Amal and Hezbollah, which have been battling for control of
Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, agreed late Sunday to end the fighting
after they handed over to Syrian forces alleged assassins of leaders
on both sides.
   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military intelligence chief in
Lebanon, said Hezbollah delivered gunmen who killed Amal's leader in
south Lebanon, Daoud Daoud, and two of his lieutenants, in a south
Beirut ambush Sept. 22.
   He said an Amal man accused by Hezbollah of the reprisal
assassination of Sheik Ali Krayyem in east Lebanon also was handed
over to the Syrians.
   He did not identify the men or say what will happen to them.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, considers that country
its sphere of influence and vital to its regional ambitions.
   Tehran has long sought to establish an Islamic-style Islamic
republic there through Hezbollah.
   The more secular and nationalist Amal seeks a Lebanese government
that would share power between Moslems and traditionally dominant
Christians.

<HEAD>Federal Grand Jury Investigating Resale Of Uncertified Plane Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal task force and grand jury are
investigating whether used or bogus airplane parts are being resold
with false certification papers to unknowing aviation companies.
   No crashes have been traced to defective parts, but investigators
said such evidence often is destroyed by crashes.
   ``We're not saying a particular part is defective, but there's a
system set up to ensure their integrity and when that system is
breached that compromises the integrity,'' said U.S. Attorney Gene
Anderson.
   Anderson's office is conducting the investigation along with
agents of the FBI, Internal Revenue Service, Defense Criminal
Investigative Service, Air Force and Navy, The Seattle Times
reported Sunday in a copyright story.
   Anderson would not name companies targeted in the investigation
or reveal any pending indictments. He said the task force, nicknamed
NORDECON for Northwest Defense Contractors although the scope now is
national, originally was formed to examine fraud in defense
contracts in the military and aerospace industries.
   Major contractors such as The Boeing Co. in Seattle may be
victims, not targets, Anderson said.
   The task force is focusing on the production, purchase and resale
of surplus and used aerospace parts. It's also looking at possible
use of counterfeit parts, which don't necessarily meet
specifications.
   Boeing has been subpoenaed by the grand jury and is cooperating
with investigators, said spokesman Paul Binder.
   The investigation stems from a similar inquiry last year in which
a Florida company was convicted of misusing Boeing surplus
electrical connectors, said Ed Easter, senior manager of Boeing's
surplus property operations.
   Miami-based Southeast Connectors Inc. and its officers were
prosecuted for buying the surplus connectors and reselling them as
new material to the Defense Department and other customers. The
company's two top executives are serving prison terms in Florida.
   The question of counterfeit and defective parts has emerged as a
national issue over the past few years in several aircraft and
defense investigations.
   Boeing was identified as a recipient of uncertified parts in a
lawsuit filed in September, when a Connecticut company accused a Los
Angeles company of selling 10,000 counterfeit ball bearings to
Boeing.
   According to a Boeing statement filed in that suit, at least
2,000 of the counterfeit bearings were installed in new commercial
jets and the AWACS radar surveillance planes.
   ``Our quality-control people, in inspecting shipments, tripped
over it,'' said Jack Gamble, spokesman for Boeing Commercial
Airplanes.
   Defective bearings have been replaced, and there were no reports
of them jeopardizing the safety of any aircraft, he said.

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. and its biggest stockholder, Carl
Icahn, have reached a truce that management says will allow the oil
giant to focus full attention on remaining a leader in the energy
business.
   Announcement of the pact came Sunday as Texaco took one of the
final steps in its huge restructuring program by proposing to pay
$1.9 billion in special dividends to shareholders, a step Icahn
applauded.
   The company said it had signed a standstill agreement with Icahn,
who hinted broadly in recent months he might try for a second time
to gain control of Texaco. Similar bids failed last year.
   ``Why fight when management is doing the job for you?'' Icahn
said in a telephone interview.
   Texaco stock fell $4.75 a share to $49.75 in early New York Stock
Exchange trading today. There had been speculation the stock might
decline once Icahn reached his agreement, because it was seen as
lessening the chances of a takeover battle that could boost Texaco's
price.
   The seven-year agreement provides that Icahn will not add to his
estimated 17 percent stake in Texaco, and will not launch or support
any proxy fights against management.
   Under the agreement, Texaco and Icahn agreed to settle pending
litigation. Texaco sued Icahn last spring, accusing him of
securities law violations.
   Icahn said he felt Texaco management had done well in recent
asset sales, particularly the $3.24 billion sale of its Texaco
Canada interests.
   ``I think top management at Texaco during the last year has done
a good job in making Texaco leaner and more productive,'' he said.
   Icahn said he also liked the idea that Texaco would put the
special dividend and any possible changes in its ``poison pill''
defense to a vote of shareholders. A poison pill is a measure for
preventing a hostile takeover by making acquisition of a company
prohibitively expensive.
   Icahn declined to say whether he planned to sell his Texaco
stock, but noted the agreement places limits on how he may do so.
   The special dividends, which will be submitted to shareholders
for a vote at the annual meeting in May, are part of Texaco's
restructuring plan that has seen the company sell about $7 billion
in assets since June.
   Texaco proposed to pay two special dividends, one of $4 a share
in notes and a second of $3 a share in cash and $1 a share in
preferred stock, for a total of $8 per share. The company has about
240 million shares outstanding.
   In addition to the special dividends, Texaco said it planned to
buy back $500 million of its stock by August 1990.
   James Kinnear, president and chief executive of Texaco, noted the
asset sales generated more than the $5 billion originally planned.
   ``We have successfully completed one of the most extensive
restructurings of assets in history, measurably improving our
competitiveness and profitability,'' he said.
   Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane Jr. said the agreement will permit
management to focus ``100 percent on the petroleum business.''
   Texaco announced its restructuring after emerging from bankruptcy
law protection last spring, saying it intended to distribute about a
third of the proceeds to shareholders. The combination of the
dividends and the stock buyback exceeds that.
   In addition to the $3.24 billion Texaco Canada sale, Texaco
agreed to sell Deutsche Texaco AG for $1.2 billion and expects $1.8
billion from its formation of a joint venture with Saudi Arabia to
refine, market and distribute Texaco products in 23 East and Gulf
Coast states.
   The White Plains-based company filed for bankruptcy protection in
1987 to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous security bond in
its court battle with Pennzoil Co.
   Pennzoil claimed that Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co.
interfered with Pennzoil's plans to buy part of Getty. In 1985, a
Houston jury awarded Pennzoil $10.3 billion. Texaco appealed but
settled for $3 billion.
   In June, Icahn lost a struggle for control of Texaco's board.
   Icahn, known as a corporate raider, is also head of Trans World
Airlines. He took control of TWA in 1985. He took it private last
year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today predicted ``jobs in
abundance'' in the years ahead and called for a new spirit of
volunteerism in America.
   ``John Kennedy challenged us to ask ourselves what we could do
for our country,'' Bush said at a swearing-in ceremony for Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole. ``And let us each day ask, what can I do
for another person? How can I make someone else's load a little
lighter?''
   Bush said government service ``plays a vital role, but it must
complement individual service.''
   Bush began the second week of his presidency nursing the
persistent cold that had forced him to cancel a Sunday visit to the
presidential retreat at Camp David with House Speaker Jim Wright.
   ``Pardon my voice,'' a hoarse Bush told his audience at the Labor
Department.
   He told the gathering, largely made up of Labor Department
employees, ``You look out for the working people of America.''
   ``I want this adminstration to be about working people,'' he
added. ``Part of that will be excellence and responsiveness in
goverment. Part of that will be holding the line on taxes. And part
of it will be a new volunteerism: people helping people.''
   ``...I think of the secretary who after a day at the office takes
the time to volunteer and help a child in the neighborhood learn how
to read,'' he said.
   With her husband, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., at her
side, Mrs. Dole picked up on Bush's theme of volunteerism and budget
restraint.
   ``We don't have unlimited funds, which means we must make the
funds we do have work for us,'' said Mrs. Dole, who was
transportation secretary in the Reagan administration.
   Mrs. Dole said she was committed to a goal of moving beyond full
employment to ``fulfilling employment'' for all who seek a job.
   Bush said there was ``a lot to feel good about on the labor
front'' with civilian unemployment currently at its lowest level in
14 years, 5.3 percent in December.
   ``There'll be jobs in abundance but we'll have to make sure our
workers have the skills that they need to fill those jobs with
excellence,'' Bush added.
   With one week as president under his belt, Bush was expected to
get down to serious talks on budget options this week with Budget
Director Richard G. Darman.
   One of those options could be a proposed new fee on deposits to
help come up with some of the estimated $100 billion needed to shore
up the nation's ailing savings and loan industry.
   Chief of Staff John Sununu said in a broadcast interview on
Sunday that the fee remains an option, despite what he called a
firestorm of opposition on Capitol Hill.
   Critics say the proposal for a $2.50 fee on each $1,000 on
deposit in federally insured financial institutions would violate
Bush's no-new-taxes pledge. Bush and other administration officials
said it wouldn't be a tax, with Sununu calling it ``an adjustment
upward of the current premium structure.''
   Sununu, interviewed Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David
Brinkley,'' suggested that some leading Democrats in Congress are
``positioning (themselves) to deal with eventual failure'' on a
bipartisan budget agreement.
   ``If that's the attitude going in, then none of us will
succeed,'' he said. He said Bush still intends to come up with a
budget plan that meets deficit-reduction targets without raising
taxes.
   The first major test of Bush's leadership could come on Feb. 9,
when Bush will outline his budget plans to a joint session of
Congress.
   The president is expected to propose numerous modifications to
the $1.15 trillion fiscal 1990 budget presented by former President
Reagan.
   The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law requires a shortfall of no
more than $100 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
Failure to reach that target would result in mandatory,
across-the-board spending cuts taken equally from domestic and
military programs.

<TEXT>
   A pro-Solidarity priest died today in a
fire that swept his home in the northeastern city of Bialystok, a
human rights activist said.
   The Rev. Stanislaw Suchowolec apparently died of smoke
inhalation, said Zofia Romaszewska of the Solidarity Commission for
Intervention and Law Abidance. The cause of the fire was not known.
   Ms. Romaszewska said Suchowolec had informed the commission that
he had been assaulted and that his car had been tampered with in the
past. The commission keeps a record of human rights violations in
Poland.
   A priest who shared the house in the Immaculate Heart of Mary
parish said he found Suchowolec's body early this morning.
   Authorities had arrived to investigate, the priest said in a
telephone interview on condition of anonymity. He said he believed
an electric spark started the fire.
   ``I got up in the morning, there was no electricity, and I saw
the doors blackened with soot on the outside. I forced the door open
and he was already dead,'' the priest said.
   ``Everything was burned up ... Everything points to the fact that
it was caused by an electric spark, because there was no light,'' he
said. ``The curtains and coverings were all burned, so it seems he
must have inhaled carbon monoxide.''
   Suchowolec was an active supporter of the banned trade union
Solidarity and is the second priest within 10 days to die in unclear
circumstances.
   On Jan. 21, a sacristan found the body of the Rev. Stefan
Niedzielak, 74, a priest who maintained a shrine to Poles killed in
the Soviet Union.
   Officials have not finished their investigation into Niedzielak's
death, but murder has not been ruled out.
   Suchowolec was a priest for six years and had served as vicar in
Sucho Wola, village of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the
pro-Solidarity priest murdered by security police in 1984.
   He also organized pilgrimages to Popieluszko's gravesite in
Warsaw.
   No Roman Catholic Church officials were available to comment in
Suchowolec's parish and church officials in Warsaw declined to
comment. Local authorities also could not be reached immediately.

<TEXT>
   Frank L. McNamara Jr., dogged by investigations
into his actions as U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, resigned today,
just three days after the majority of his assistant prosecutors
demanded his removal.
   ``The work of this office is far too important to be sidetracked
by any controversy,'' McNamara said in a brief statement that didn't
mention his assistants' demand.
   McNamara, who said he intended to return to private law practice,
said he believed President George Bush and Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh ``should be afforded the opportunity to appoint a person
of their own choosing.''
   McNamara, a 41-year-old Republican, has been the target of a
Justice Department investigation since November, when charges that
he saw his predecessor smoke marijuana backfired. Investigators
found no evidence to support his allegations; McNamara admitted to
smoking marijuana himself.
   Additional investigations questioned whether McNamara used his
office as a political tool. Over the weekend, he denied urging
politically motivated investigations of prominent Democrats and
vowed not to resign under pressure.
   On Friday, 28 of the 39 assistant U.S. attorneys under his charge
wrote to Thornburgh urging him to expedite McNamara's departure.
   ``Mr. McNamara's conduct and performance while United States
attorney is resulting in a loss of confidence in the adminstration
of justice,'' the letter said. ``Because Mr. McNamara will neither
resign nor step aside temporarily, the credibility and operations of
this office will continue to be damaged ... unless he is removed.''
   McNamara has been dogged by controversy since he was nominated by
President Reagan to replace William F. Weld in April 1987, when Weld
was promoted to head the Justice Department's criminal division.
   McNamara's confirmation was held up while the FBI investigated
irregularities in his congressional campaign finances and his
failure to pay income tax for 1983 and 1984 until 1986. He ran
unsuccessfully against U.S. Rep. Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., speaker of
the House, in 1982.
   During the confirmation process, McNamara said he believed Weld
was trying to scuttle his nomination and told investigators that he
had seen Weld drunk on several occasions. He also alleged he had
seen Weld smoke a marijuana joint at a 1982 wedding party.
   A Justice Department investigation failed to support McNamara's
charges, and McNamara was forced to admit that he had smoked
marijuana himself at a later date.
   In November, several assistant prosecutors said McNamara pursued
an investigation of a prison land deal by the administration of Gov.
Michael S. Duakakis in an attempt to discredit Dukakis, then the
Democratic nominee for president.
   Over the weekend, McNamara denied allegations that he urged a
federal investigation into marijuana-smoking charges against U.S.
Rep. Joseph Kennedy II and Robert Farmer, the top fundraiser for

   McNamara said the allegation stemmed from an unsubstantiated FBI
report that was leaked to reporters.

   Israel will go ahead with plans to build eight
new Jewish settlements in the occupied lands this year despite the
Palestinian uprising and a slashed budget, an adviser to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today.
   Michael Dekel, the prime minister's adviser on settlements, said
there was no shortage of ``idealistic pioneers'' to develop five new
settlements in the West Bank and three in the southern Gaza Strip.
   The coalition agreement signed by the new government of Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc and the center-left Labor Party calls for the
building of five to eight Jewish settlements.
   ``The moment people oppose you, you cannot raise your hands and
surrender _you have to struggle,'' Dekel told The Associated Press,
referring to the 13-month Palestinian revolt against Israeli
occupation in the territories.
   ``The settlement of the state of Israel is very important because
of _ not despite _ the intefadeh,'' he said, using the Arabic word
for uprising.
   Dekel said he hoped the government's economic austerity plan,
which cut more than $600 million from the state budget, would not
take a toll on the settlement movement.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers already live in the West Bank and
Gaza, which Israel seized during the 1967 Middle East war.
   Many of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories fear
Israel wants all their land, and the settlers have become frequent
targets of stonings and firebombings. They have called on the
government to take harsher steps against Arab rioters.
   Although settlers have received government incentives to move to
the occupied lands, many have strong ideological commitments to the
territory, believing it is their God-given birthright.
   Also today, an Arab mukhtar, or traditional village leader, was
stabbed to death in the occupied West Bank village of Beit Lid, a
military spokeswoman said today.
   An Arab reporter said Mahmoud Salem Mahmoud, 65, went to work on
his farm Sunday. Relatives began searching for the mukhtar when he
failed to return home as planned, and found his body, which was
``stabbed in many places,'' he said.
   Although the reason for the killing was unclear, Arab reporters
said Mahmoud may have been slain because he was suspected of working
for the Israelis.
   Army officials say 30 Palestinians have been killed during the
uprising by fellow Arabs because they were suspected collaborators
or informants.
   In addition, underground Palestinian leaders of the uprising have
called for overthrowing traditional village leaders to make way for
younger, more radical ones.
   Including the alleged collaborators, 370 Palestinians have been
killed since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. Fifteen Israelis also
have been killed.
   Also today, Israeli news reports said an army officer was
sentenced to three months in prison and six months probation for the
shooting death of a Palestinian protester in the Gaza Strip last
August.
   The officer, a second lieutenant, shot at a fleeing man who had
led a violent protest, Israel army radio said.
   A military court judge said the soldier did not have to shoot at
the Palestinian because the man was not endangering his life or
those of other troops.
   ``We're not talking about a mission that must be carried out at
any cost,'' the judge wrote in his opinion, according to army radio.
   Israeli newspapers also reported that Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin would hold a series of meetings with local Palestinian leaders
to push his plan for elections leading to partial autonomy for the
occupied territories. The Palestine Liberation Organization has
rejected the proposal.

<HEAD>Minister Back In Pulpit 3 Years After Leaving In Disgrace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A minister who left his church after
admitting he committed adultery, leaving a schism in his
congregation that prompted the Rev. Jerry Falwell to step in, now
wants to start a new church in the same city.
   The Rev. Herman ``Buddy'' Frankland returned to preaching Sunday
with a sermon on ``Lessons Learned: Lessons Applied'' to about 50
people in a motel room, and said he was seeking a place to rent for
his new Messiah Temple.
   The fundamentalist minister has avoided the spotlight since
leaving the Bangor Baptist Church in disgrace in 1985.
   ``I have learned a lot of lessons. It's been a tough three
years,'' he told the congregation. ``But I'm back because of your
letters ... I've made mistakes, but I don't want to go into the
valley again.''
   One woman said afterward that Frankland was the most inspiring
preacher she had ever heard. ``Thank God he's back. We need him,''
she said.
   Frankland stepped down from the pulpit of the Bangor Baptist
Church, which he had founded 19 years earlier and built into one of
the largest in New England, after announcing publicly he had
committed adultery.
   Following his fall from grace, a split occurred within the
congregation, prompting Falwell, a fellow fundamentalist known
nationally for his television show and politics, to step in as
acting pastor in an attempt to straighten out what he saw as chaos.
   Asked by reporters after the sermon what prompted his return,
Frankland said he had received an inspiring letter from a former
parishioner and felt guilty for having left his congregation.
   He acknowledged that some people say he does not belong in Bangor
but said, ``A shepherd should not leave his flock. I don't care what
people say.''

   For the first time since jurors began
deliberating his fate a week ago, Joel Steinberg entered the
courtroom smiling amid speculation that he had been acquitted of the
most serious charge _ murder _ he faces in the death of his
illegally adopted daughter Lisa.
   Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, is accused of fatally beating the
6-year-old girl he and his live-in companion, Hedda Nussbaum, had
illegally obtained at birth from a Long Island teen-ager and raised
as their own.
   The death of Lisa Steinberg, raised in an upper-middle-class
family, has focused a new light on the issue of child abuse, and the
case has received international attention.
   Jurors began their eighth day of deliberations today, amid
speculation that they had acquitted Steinberg of second-degree
murder and were considering the less serious charges of first- and
second-degree manslaughter.
   Steinberg faces four charges: second-degree murder; first-degree
manslaughter; second-degree manslaughter, and criminally negligent
homicide.
   Steinberg grinned broadly as he entered the courtroom shortly
before 8 p.m. Sunday, when the judge sent the jurors home for the
evening. Several hours earlier, the jury had sent out a note asking
for clarification of the terms ``intent'' and ``serious physical
injury'' _ elements of manslaughter.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax had told jurors not to
consider manslaughter unless they unanimously acquitted Steinberg of
second-degree murder.
   Defense lawyer Ira London said Steinberg, 47, feels the jury is
giving him ``a fair shake. ... What we feel good about is that this
has not been a lynching.''
   At 11 a.m., the jury began rehearing about two hours' worth of
testimony they had requested concerning Steinberg's actions between
the time Lisa was injured on Nov. 1, 1987, and the next morning,
when Emergency Medical Service workers were called and took Lisa to
a hospital, where she died several days later.
   That testimony includes statements from police officers, EMS
workers and hospital employees who had testified about Steinberg's
explanations for Lisa's condition and his reaction to her prognosis.
   The jury also specifically asked to rehear Ms. Nussbaum's
testimony of what happened the night Lisa was injured. Among other
things, Ms. Nussbaum testified that Steinberg told her he hit Lisa,
which he has denied.
   The last note the jury sent out Sunday indicated that they were
considering the possibility that there was no intent on Steinberg's
part to cause injury to Lisa.
   Second-degree manslaughter does not include an element of intent,
but is the reckless disregard of a substantial risk of death to
another, such as Steinberg's delay in getting medical help for Lisa.
   First-degree manslaughter is applicable when a person intends to
seriously injure someone and in the process, the victim dies.

<TEXT>
   A 20-year-old self-styled commando who
``always wanted to join the army'' has confessed to three murders in
the Midwest and one killing and four other sniper attacks on Long
Island, police said.
   In a two-hour videotaped statement, Yusef Abdullah Rahman
admitted to shootings that killed one man and wounded three others
in December on eastern Long Island, Suffolk County District Attorney
Edward Jablonski said Sunday.
   Rahman, Jablonski said, also claimed to have killed three people
in Kansas City, Mo., although police there said he is wanted for
only one murder.
   Rahman was arrested Saturday afternoon in Wyandanch after a brief
foot chase, Jablonski said. Rahman was linked to the Long Island
shootings after several guns belonging to him were found in a car in
Southampton about a week before his arrest.
   He was held without bail on one count of second-degree murder,
three counts of attempted murder in the second degree and one count
of reckless endangerment in the first degree.
   The Long Island shootings occurred Dec. 5 to 8 within a two-mile
radius in the towns of Southampton and Riverhead. The two towns are
about 75 miles east of New York City and near exclusive beach
communities favored by the city's wealthy.
   Friends and relatives of the victims, all in their 30s, described
them as hard-working family men and couldn't suggest a motive.
   Police Capt. John McElhone said Rahman, a Riverhead resident, was
``playing out his fantasy'' with the random shootings.
   He said Rahman liked to wear commando-style outfits, such as
black clothing and a bullet-proof vest. Jablonski said he rode a
bicycle when he did the sniping, and carried a knife strapped to his
leg.
   ``He always wanted to join the army but his parents wouldn't
allow him,'' said Detective George Horvath.
   Jablonski said Rahman would peer through the windows of homes
before firing. He said Rahman even asked one victim afterward about
the shooting.
   Rahman also was accused of shooting at a police car on Jan. 1
``to renew public interest in his actions,'' McElhone said.
According to Jablonski, Rahman said he aimed at the headlights but
nearly hit an officer in the head.
   In Kansas City, Rahman is wanted for first-degree murder and
armed criminal action in connection with the 1987 slaying of
Frederick Beard, said Sgt. Pete Edlund.
   Beard's body was found slumped over the steering wheel of his car
on Aug. 3, 1987. Edlund said Beard had been shot several times.

   A bomb exploded in a bar and killed an
employee in an attack the government blamed on South Africa, a
government-controlled newspaper said Monday.
   A cleaning woman was killed in Sunday's blast in the Bush Baby
Bar in downtown Livingstone near the border with Botswana, South
African-controlled Namibia and Zimbabwe, said the Times of Zambia.
   The paper quoted State Security Secretary Alex Shapi as saying
investigators were treating the blast as part of a campaign of
bombings and sabotage attacks by agents of the white-run government
of South Africa. The attacks have occurred in black-governed nations
that give sanctuary to South African exiles.
   On Jan. 24, a Zambian night guard died and another was wounded
when a mail bomb exploded at a hotel in Livingstone. In December,
two people were killed and 13 others were injured in a car bombing
outside another hotel in Livingstone.

   British revelers invaded a luxury
resort hotel and hauled off paintings and other objects in a night
of ``silly horseplay'' that drew banner headlines Monday in the
nation's leading tabloid.
   The Blick newspaper said 50 to 60 jeering partygoers entered the
hotel lobby Saturday night to the wail of bagpipes and ``tried to
take away everything that wasn't nailed down.''
   Some climbed to the roof and tried to haul down the Swiss flag
and others tried to steal a Rolls-Royce parked at the hotel, the
newspaper said.
   Authorities said paintings also were taken.
   Police described the events as the ``turbulent outcome of a
wager.'' They said the attack stemmed from a dinner party in nearby
Samaden, where a prize was promised to the person removing the
``most beautiful object'' from the Palace Hotel.
   About 20 people were detained but released without charges,
police said.
   ``It was more or less silly horseplay,'' said police officer
Werner Haffner.

   A man who did not seek medical treatment for a
rattlesnake bite received during a church service has died,
authorities said.
   Ernest W. Short, 41, of Teetersville died at his father's home
Sunday, Harlan County Coroner William Venable said.
   A 2{- to 3-foot snake bit Short during a service Saturday at Ages
Pentecostal Church, Venable said. Members of some strict
fundamentalist Protestant churches believe the Bible directs them to
handle poisonous snakes as evidence of their faith in Christ.
   Under Kentucky law, handling snakes during religious services is
a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $50 to $100. But charges are
rare, and snake handling is a regular practice in some churches
throughout the mountains of eastern Kentucky and Appalachia.
   The last known death from a snake bite during a church service
occurred in Harlan County on Feb. 13, 1986.

<HEAD>Pope Makes No Commitment on Women Assisting at Mass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II announced Monday the
Vatican is studying the question of lay people assisting at Mass but
made no commitment to open those roles to women, which U.S. bishops
have sought.
   In a document on the role of the laity in church and society, the
pope condemned discrimination against women, said they can play a
greater role in church affairs, and reaffirmed the ban on women
priests.
   On other issues, the pope warned against excessive use of lay
people in priestly roles, said the Vatican was tightening control
over lay movements and associations, and urged the laity fight for
social justice in the political arena.
   ``Those who look for new things and concrete solutions in the
document may be disillusioned,'' said Cardinal Eduardo Pironio, the
president of the Pontifical Council on the Laity.
   The Argentinian prelate said the pope ``wisely and prudently''
asked for further study of the ``burning issues'' raised at the last
synod.
   The document, ``The Lay Members of Christ's Faithful People,'' is
the pontiff's response to issues raised by Roman Catholic bishops
from around the world at the 1987 synod on the laity at the Vatican.
   American bishops at the assembly proposed that women be
officially allowed to serve in non-ordained ministries, such as
lector, acolyte and altar server _ people who assist at Mass.
Others, especially African bishops, opposed the idea.
   Church law bars women from such roles, but in the United States
and some other countries women and girls sometimes fill those
positions informally, without installation.
   The document disclosed a Vatican commission had been formed to
study the question of the lay ministries. Until the panel completes
its work, local churches should ``faithfully respect'' the current
regulations, it said.
   At a Vatican news conference to present the document, officials
stressed that the commission was studying all elements of
non-ordained ministries, including the possibility of creating new
``minor orders'' apart from lector and acolyte.
   Belgian Archbishop Jan Schotte, secretary-general of the synod,
said he is president of the commission.
   Asked if the panel was considering opening the ministries of
lector and acolyte to women, Schotte replied, ``No.'' But later he
said, ``We are studying everything. Nothing is excluded and nothing
is decided.'
   Earlier, a senior Vatican official said the pope appeared to be
firing ``warning shots'' indicating that there could be more control
over non-ordained ministries rather than a decision to open them to
women.
   ``He's certainly not saying, `Hold on girls, your time is
coming,''' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``The statements tend more toward a restrictive presence of lay
people in ministries.''
   The pope did not go beyond his position set out in September in
his document ``On the Dignity of Women,'' including the
reaffirmation of the ban on ordination of women priests.
   The pope condemned the treatment of women as an ``object to buy
and sell, as an instrument for selfish interests or for pleasure
only.''
   The document said women can play a greater role in
decision-making, in particular by serving on various diocese-level
councils.
   Asked whether the U.S. church would be disappointed on the
women's issue, Maria da Graca Sales of Portugal, a lay Vatican
adviser, said: ``Concrete steps are very relative. What might be
considered concrete in the United States might be inapplicable in
Asia or Africa.''
   The pope also said the role of men should not be neglected.
   ``In reality various sectors in the church must lament the
absence or the scarcity of the presence of men, some of whom
abdicate their proper church responbilities, allowing them to be
fulfilled only by women,'' the document said.

<HEAD>SDI Has Launched Debate, if not a Missile Shield</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Strategic Defense Initiative hasn't put any
anti-missile defenses in orbit but has launched a healthy debate on
the future of U.S. nuclear forces, says the Air Force general who is
retiring Tuesday after nearly five years as head of the program.
   Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson leaves the Air Force and the Star Wars
program scarred from his battles with critics but still deeply
committed to building defenses against nuclear missiles.
   That goal has changed substantially, however, since President
Reagan called in March 1983 for the development of a space-based
ballistic missile defense system. That speech, Abrahamson said in a
farewell interview, ``touched off a very significant debate on our
deterrence policy.''
   The debate, on the possibility of switching from a purely
offensive nuclear deterrence to a mixture of offensive and defensive
systems, continued last week during Senate confirmation hearings for
Defense Secretary-designate John G. Tower.
   Tower noted that aides to President Bush are reviewing all
strategic weapons and told the Senate Armed Services Committee he
personally does not ``believe that we can devise an ... umbrella
that can protect the entire American population from nuclear
incineration. I think that's unrealistic.''
   One member of the panel, Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., noted that
Tower's account ``represents a view markedly different from the
public's perception of President Reagan's advocacy of a perfect
defensive umbrella.''
   Tower's remarks did reflect a vision of strategic defense that
Abrahamson has been advocating for several years.
   ``What we are adding ... is an improved form of deterrence,''
Abrahamson said in the interview. No strategic defense, he added,
can provide an impermeable shield against a nuclear barrage.
   ``The president gave us a daunting goal, to make it thoroughly
reliable,'' said Abrahamson. ``That means, let's reexamine the
strategy.''
   Abrahamson's defense of SDI earned him a lot of enemies, and he
gives himself ``the worse grades'' in garnering support for the
program.
   ``I have gotten a lot of scars ...,'' said Abrahamson, who will
be replaced by another three-star Air Force general, George L.
Monahan Jr.
   Abrahamson was considered for energy secretary under Bush, and
has been mentioned as a possible head of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. But so far his retirement plans include
only windsurfing. ``I love it,'' he said.
   SDI, which Abrahamson has headed since its start in April 1984,
has spent $16 billion on research. Recently, scientists have been
concentrating on less exotic weapons for the near term.
   For instance, an early system might use land-based missiles,
similar to the 100-missile system the Soviets have around Moscow.
That is the limit set by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
   Abrahamson listed these other upcoming tests:
   _The $130 million Delta Star or Delta 183 test of a forerunner of
the Boost Surveillance Tracking Satellite, to be launched ``sometime
this year,'' using infrared, ultraviolet and visible waves to spot
boosters.
   _A $520 million Airborne Optical Adjunct, a Boeing 767 fitted
with an 86-foot cupola containing an infrared sensor designed to
spot warheads as they reenter the atmosphere.
   _Forerunners of the High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor, to
be tested this year, and the Exoatmospheric Interceptor System, to
be tested in 1990. Both are missile systems designed to hit warheads
as they near targets.
   _The first test in space of a particle beam, part of the $45
million Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket, a 1.25-ton accelerator
designed to shoot particles so that scientists can study their
behavior in space. Researchers believe particle beams can be used to
discriminate warheads from decoys in space, and that higher-power
beams may ultimately be able to destroy missiles in flight.
   _A relay mirror experiment in which ground stations will bounce
laser beams off a satellite with a two-foot diameter that is
supposed to reflect them to a point 12 miles from the point of
origin. One SDI plan calls for ``battle mirrors'' to reflect
powerful laser beams at enemy rockets.

<HEAD>More Than 11,500 Blocked from Joining Armed Forces</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department blocked more than 11,500
people from joining the armed forces last year because they tested
positive for drug or alcohol abuse.
   The testing program, mandated by Congress over Pentagon
objections, began last June 1. Even though it tagged more than
11,500 recruit applicants during the first seven months, some
defense officials say privately that the program isn't worth its
cost.
   The Pentagon statistics, obtained late last week, show that only
about 3.5 percent of those tested from June 1 to Dec. 31 were found
to have abused marijuana, cocaine or alcohol. The armed forces
rejected 11,279 people for testing positive for marijuana or cocaine
use and another 265 for alcohol abuse.
   The Defense Department spent $3.1 million to develop the program
and to conduct the tests from June through September, and expects to
spend another $4.8 million in fiscal 1989, which opened Oct. 1.
Congress did not provide any money to start the program, forcing the
services to divert money from other parts of their budgets.
   The statistics show that during the seven-month period, the
Pentagon tested 322,256 people for marijuana and cocaine use and
331,040 for alcohol abuse during the same period. The totals differ
because the alcohol test is done with a breath device and results
are immediate, while the urine exam for drug use requires laboratory
analysis.
   The 3.5 percent positive rate for recruits compares with a rate
of about 4.8 percent for people already on active duty.
   ``The number of recruit positives is well below the active-duty
rate, which demonstrates what we already knew _ those coming in are
no longer aggravating the drug problem,'' said one defense official,
who declined to be identified.
   ``It's nice to be able to test but it's not cheap. And as time
goes on, the number of people who test positive is going to drop as
applicants realize that everyone is going to get tested at this
point and you can't escape it,'' the official said.
   The Pentagon opposed recruit testing from the beginning because
of the expense and because once in uniform, all those in the service
face periodic, random urine tests. Those tests are credited with
helping drive drug use within the military to record low levels.
   Military officials also objected to the testing of recruit
applicants because the tests would not be random or a surprise; all
recruits are tested when they show up at a military entrance
processing command station.
   Despite those arguments, Congress embraced legislation sponsored
by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., in 1987 and ordered the Defense
Department to begin testing all recruit applicants.
   Hollings has described the program as ``logical and long
overdue,'' adding: ``The time to start catching the users is before
they join the armed forces, when the government has no obligation to
them.''
   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, in a directive last
spring implementing the law, said the armed services, at their
discretion, could give a second chance to people who flunk the first
test.
   He specified, however, that anyone who flunked the test for
marijuana or alcohol abuse could not be offered a second chance for
six months, and that someone who flunked for cocaine use had to wait
at least one year.
   Maj. David Super, a Pentagon spokesman, said it was too early for
any results to have been compiled on second tests.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has recommended
conservative federal appeals judge Kenneth W. Starr as the new U.S.
solicitor general, department sources said Monday.
   If nominated by President Bush and approved by the Senate, Starr,
42, would serve as the federal government's chief representative
before the Supreme Court.
   ``I understand it's a done deal,'' said one department source,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Bush hasn't done anything on
it, but we wouldn't have recommended it formally if we didn't think
it suited his personnel people.''
   A senior department official said Starr, who was born in Vernon,
Texas, was ``at the top of our list'' for the solicitor job.
   Starr was a clerk for former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and
later a partner with the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp;
Crutcher. He served as counselor to Attorney General William French
Smith from 1981 until his appointment to the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1983.
   His secretary said Monday he would not be available for
interviews.
   Starr had been mentioned as a possible Supreme Court nominee
following the 1987 retirement of Justice Lewis Powell.
   Moving from a federal judgeship to the solicitor general post has
been a route to the Supreme Court in the past. Justice Thurgood
Marshall gave up a seat on the 2nd Circuit to become solicitor
general in 1965. Two years later, President Johnson named him to the
high court.
   The solicitor general is the government's chief appeals lawyer,
arguing cases before the Supreme Court and deciding whether to
appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies.
   In legal circles, the solicitor is known as the 10th justice
because the high court traditionally has relied upon him to provide
legal guidance.
   Bruce Fein, a conservative columnist and an attorney who was an
associate deputy attorney general during President Reagan's first
term, hailed the recommendation of Starr, who he said in a November
1988 column ``epitomizes the Reagan judicial legacy.''
   He said Monday that Starr has ``the perfect temperament and style
for advocacy before the Supreme Court'' and ``resists flamboyance or
extravagant statements.'' His opinions ``have been earmarked by
conservative instinct, yet open-mindedness. There's no ideological
fervor,'' Fein said.
   Colleen O'Connor, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said Starr was ``a question mark'' but ``all the signals that
have come out of the Bush administration's Justice Department do not
seem all that different from what we've seen in the past.''
   In some recent cases, Starr has joined with other appellate court
members to uphold First Amendment rights. In one, he helped reject a
libel suit against The Washington Post by the former president of
Mobil Corp., and in another, he wrote that critical comments about a
Marxist professor included in a Rowland Evans and Robert Novak
column were ``entitled to absolute First Amendment protection.''
   In other cases, he helped overturn court-imposed limits on the
number of inmates housed in the District of Columbia's prisons and
helped throw out the D.C. Fire Department's affirmative action
hiring plan.
   Starr received his bachelor's degree from George Washington
University in 1968, got a master's degree from Brown University in
1969 and was graduated from Duke University Law School in 1973.
   If approved, Starr would succeed Charles Fried, who has left the
solicitor office to return to Harvard University Law School.

<TEXT>
   The leader of the ultra-rightist
party that stunned the nation by gaining seats in the West Berlin
legislature was a Nazi SS soldier and a journalist before he turned
to politics.
   Franz Schoenhuber, a burly man with bushy eyebrows and a
swashbuckling manner, rejects charges that his party is racist and
hates foreigners. After Sunday's vote, the 66-year-old butcher's son
said the Republicans stood for ``patriotic'' causes.
   His Republicans, who campaigned for sharply reducing the number
of foreign workers and Third World asylum-seekers in the nation, won
7.5 percent of Sunday's vote and gained 11 seats in West Berlin's
138-seat legislature.
   Born in the Bavarian village of Trostberg, Schoenhuber
volunteered for Adolf Hitler's air force in 1942 at age 19 but was
ruled unfit to fly.
   He then became a Nazi SS soldier and received training in an
elite, hand-picked unit that initially served as Hitler's personal
guard.
   Schoenhuber fought in France and on the Eastern front before
spending 1{ years in British captivity.
   After the war, he worked as an actor and a sports reporter. He
later worked as columnist for the Munich mass-circulation newspaper
Abendzeitung and in 1972 became editor-in-chief of another Munich
tabloid, TZ.
   Later that year, Schoenhuber went to work for the Bavarian state
radio, Bayerische Rundfunk, and eventually became the moderator of a
popular show in which politicians faced questions from citizens in a
Munich tavern.
   In 1981, he published ``I Was There,'' a book that described his
service with the Waffen SS. The controversial book sold 60,000
copies and became a best-seller, but Shoenhuber was forced to resign
his radio job and the chairmanship of the Bavarian Journalists Union.
   Schoenhuber joined the Republican party shortly after it was
founded in 1983.
   The founders quit the party in 1985, saying his views on
foreigners were too extreme. They accused Schoenhuber of trying to
model the party after the organization of French right-wing
extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen, who advocates limiting the number of
foreign workers in his country.
   While disputing the label ``extremist,'' Schoenhuber proudly
acknowledges that his party is ``rightist-conservative.''
   Under his guidance, the Republicans made headlines by winning 3
percent of the state vote in Bavaria in 1986.
   The party's platform for the West Berlin elections said foreign
workers' contracts should have strict time limits and that they
should not be allowed to bring their families to West Germany.
   ``We are not the social welfare office of the Third World,'' the
Republicans' national spokesman, Harald Neubauer, said after the
election. ``We are for humane reunions of families of foreigners _
in their home countries.''

   A judge today ordered the government to free
on $2 million bail a Korean-born American businessman charged with
attempting to export tons of nerve gas bombs.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin said the government failed to
convince him that Juwhan Yun would flee prosecution if he were
released on bail.
   Yun, 48, has pleaded innocent to charges of conspiring to violate
the Arms Export Control Act by seeking to ship overseas 500
quarter-ton bombs of sarin, a nerve gas. The government says the
bombs may have been intended for Iran.
   ``Nothing is more abhorrent to our free society than the spectre
of persons accused of crimes being confined in prisons before trial
and conviction,'' Sarokin wrote in an opinion ordering Yun's release.
   ``The right to be free on bail before trial is what distinguishes
our democracy from totalitarian governments,'' he added.
   Yun has been in custody since his arrest Jan. 12.
   Under the bail agreement, Yun was ordered to forfeit his passport
and those of his family. He also agreed to be confined to his home
and to have all international telephone calls to his home monitored
by the U.S. attorney's office.
   A magistrate revoked bail for Yun on Jan. 20 after prosecutors
said the classified government documents written in English and
Korean were found on a desk at his import-export business, Komex
International Corp., in Summit.
   Yun's attorney, Stephen Dratch, argued last week that his client
was a victim of entrapment, claiming the government had overstepped
its bounds during the investigation.
   Sarokin made his decision after reading transcripts of taped
conversations and copies of intercepted facsimile messages provided
by the government.
   Yun, Sarokin said, would be unlikely to flee because his wife and
three children and his mother reside with him.
   Bail will be secured by Yun's house in Short Hills, worth
$650,000, and a New York City condominium, worth $250,000, the judge
said.

   Chicago was deemed the most polite city in America by business
executives in Mrs. Stewart's fifth annual survey.
   ``Chicago has such healthiness, such feeling, such spirit,'' the
manners maven said Monday from her Kewanee home in western Illinois.
   The ``little courtesies'' shown by service people from waiters to
cab drivers add up, she said. ``We really all are ambassadors for

   Chicago replaces Pittsburgh, last year's winner. The rest of the
Top 10 are Seattle, New York, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, Denver,
Charleston, S.C., Boston, Peoria, Ill., and Dallas.
   Mrs. Stewart is the author of 16 books on etiquette and founder
of a company that conducts courses on manners in 800 cities. Her

   A university food center is trying to
concoct a better beef stew to combat the unsavory reputation of C
rations.
   Rutgers University's Center for Advanced Food Technology, backed
by a $1.5 million grant from the Department of Defense, is seeking
to come up with food palatable to the armed forces as well as the
civilian population.
   Beef stew has been declared the first new C ration creation.
   ``All told, we envision a process that with a minimum of change
could make what the armed forces want in pouches and what the
consumer wants in other products,'' said Jack L. Rossen, associate
director of the Rutgers center.
   The 5-year project will employ researchers from industry and the
university who hope to develop highly automated processes that would
allow America's larger food-processing companies to enter combat
ration production, Rossen said. The market is now dominated by
smaller companies because product demand is so low.
   But why beef stew as a benchmark?
   Because it's ``tasty, popular, and has a lot of variations,''
Rossen said.

received the call he thought it was a prank, but there really were
eight stray cows roaming the highway.
   The cows fell out of a moving truck, forcing the closure of
Interstate 75 for about an hour Sunday as authorities played roundup.
   Huggins, partner Garth Burnside, state Department of Natural
Resources conservation officer Dan Walzak and police from Taylor and
Southgate, captured the cows and placed them in a makeshift corral
in the I-75 median.
   ``We're all cowboys at heart,'' said Huggins. He said authorities

   A body found in a junkyard Monday was
the fifth in the area since two brothers were discovered shot to
death earlier this month, police said.
   ``The search is definitely continuing,'' said Kanawha County
Sheriff Art Ashley. ``We specifically want to go through that same
vicinity thoroughly.''
   The unidentified body found Monday, by a specially trained dog,
was about 200 yards east of where three other bodies have been
found. Another victim was found in her home a short distance away,
and police have been searching for two other people missing since
autumn.
   Mark Southern McCallister, 19, is being held in the Kanawha
County Jail without bond on murder charges in two of the deaths. He
is charged with the Jan. 8 shotgun slayings of Billy and Otis
Sanson, who lived in a trailer compound.
   Otis, 25, was shot in the back and left in a camper trailer. The
body had been covered with cushions and the camper door nailed shut,
said assistant Kanawha County Prosecutor Reagan Whitmyer.
   Billy, 27, was shot in face and left in a makeshift dog pen.
   The body of their sister, Bonnie Sanson, was found by search dogs
Jan. 21 buried on the grounds of an abandoned motel. An autopsy
revealed she was killed by a shotgun blast to the back of the head.
   McCallister's grandmother, Charlotte Ruby Ferrell, 69, was found
in the bedroom of her St. Albans home Jan. 13, shot in the head with
a shotgun and wrapped in sheets and a curtain.
   Missing are Bonnie Sanson's boyfriend, Jimmy Price, and Michael
Schillings, a North Carolina man who linked up with the compound's
residents last spring.
   Three other people who lived there _ the Sansons' mother, her
daughter and Bonnie Sanson's daughter _ moved last week to South
Carolina, officials say.

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case said today
that former President Reagan should remain ``subject to call'' in
the trial of fired National Security Council aide Oliver North and
that portions of Reagan's personal diary might be needed at North's
trial.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell quashed North's subpoena for
President Bush to testify. He said North had made no showing that
Bush ``has any specific information relevant and material'' to the
charges against North.
   Gesell refused to quash North's subpoena for Reagan's testimony
but said in his three-page order there would be further proceedings
if it is found necessary to call the former president as a witness
in the trial.
   The judge said there shall be ``no restriction placed upon''
Reagan by the subpoena unless the court entered another order, after
hearing objections from the Justice Department and private counsel
to Reagan.
   Gesell, acting a day before North's trial on 12 felony charges
begins, quashed, with ``one narrow exception,'' North's subpoena for
Reagan's personal diary.
   But the judge said portions of the diary might become part of the
trial ``if at some point'' North's defense team ``supports a claim
that President Reagan ordered, directed, requested or, with advance
knowledge, condoned any of North's'' alleged criminal activities in
the diversion of Iranian arm-sales profits to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   In that event, said Gesell, ``an appropriate production
procedure'' must be developed for reviewing the former president's
diary and determining whether any of the entries support North's
assertions.
   North contended in testimony at the congressional Iran-Contra
hearings in 1987 that all of his activities were authorized by
superiors in the Reagan administration and that he reported to
former national security advisers Robert McFarlane and John M.
Poindexter.
   Gesell's order implemented a tactic he had indicated at a hearing
Friday he would use with regard to Reagan's testimony.
   ``President Reagan shall remain subject to call on the ...
subpoena'' served by North's lawyers last month for the
ex-president's testimony, said today's order.
   Gesell said Friday that circumstances may change as evidence is
introduced at the trial and that testimony of certain individuals
may become relevant.
   Gesell said that with regard to North's subpoena for Bush, the
former NSC aide's lawyers have ``made no showing that President Bush
has any specific information relevant and material to the charges of
the indictment which makes it necessary or appropriate to require
his appearance.''
   Since North's indictment last March, his lawyers won dismissal of
four of the original 16 counts _ including the key charges arising
from the diversion of the money to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But the retired Marine lieutenant colonel still faces a host of
other charges that carry a maximum possible sentence of 60 years
imprisonment and fines totaling $3 million. His trial is set to
begin Tuesday.
   The dismissal earlier this month of charges that North conspired
with Poindexter and two arms dealers to finance the ``secret war''
in Nicaragua with arms-sale proceeds basically leaves allegations
that he covered up his activities by lying.
   The former National Security Council aide is charged with making
false statements to congressional committees in 1985 that were
investigating reports he and others were helping the rebels in
violation of a ban on such assistance.
   Three false-statement and obstruction charges allege that North
prepared false responses to written queries from congressional
committees. The letters denying that North or other NSC staffers
were improperly assisting the Contras were signed by McFarlane, then
national security adviser.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding
information from Congress and is expected to testify against North
as a witness for Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   North also is charged with obstructing an August 1986 inquiry by
the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He is accused
of falsely denying, during a meeting with panel members at the White
House, that he helped the Contras.
   Four other obstruction and false statement charges stem from
actions North allegedly took after the Iran-Contra affair became
public in November 1986.
   He is charged with obstructing the presidential inquiry ordered
by President Reagan by making false statements to then-Attorney
General Edwin Meese III and by destroying National Security Council
documents while Justice Department investigators were conducting the
probe.
   The false statements included North's denial that the NSC staff
was involved in the diversion of arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan
rebels, known as Contras, the indictment charges.
   An obstruction of Congress charge alleges that North helped
prepare a false chronology of the U.S.-Iran arms sales for an
appearance by Poindexter before the House and Senate intelligence
panels.
   Prosecutors also hope to prove that North personally benefited
from his involvement with the Iran-Contra affair. North is charged
with accepting the installation of a $13,000 security fence around
his Great Falls, Va., home that was allegedly paid for by arms
dealer Richard V. Secord, another co-defendant. The offense carries
a two-year sentence.
   One of the four charges dropped against North was an allegation
that he prepared false documents to obstruct the grand jury's
investigation of the fence. U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
ruled that the charge was legally defective because the alleged
obstruction occurred a month before the Iran-Contra grand jury was
impaneled on Jan. 28, 1987.
   He is also charged with converting to his personal use at least
$4,300 of the $90,000 in travelers checks that Contra leader Adolfo
Calero gave him to help defray costs of helping the rebels.
   That offense carries a 10-year sentence and a $250,000 fine. Most
of the other charges carry five-year sentences, including a charge
that he conspired to use a tax-exempt foundation illegally to help
raise money to arm the Contras.
   Two conservative fundraisers, Carl ``Spitz'' R. Channell and
Richard R. Miller, have pleaded guilty to related charges and are
prepared to testify against North about efforts to raise $3.2
million from private donors for the non-tax exempt purpose of
financing the Contras.
   Poindexter, Secord and arms dealer Albert Hakim are to be tried
separately from North.
   It is likely that the major Iran-Contra conspiracy charges will
be dismissed against them as well, because the government is
unwilling to allow disclosure of classified information contained in
prosecution exhibits.
   Poindexter, the former national security adviser, is charged with
obstructing Congress and making false statements to various
congressional investigations. Secord and Hakim are also charged with
conspiring to pay illegal gratuities by installing the security
fence and setting up a Swiss bank account for North's children.

   A car bomb exploded as the motorcade of
Phalange Party leader George Saade passed a cemetery Monday in
Christian east Beirut, killing three people and wounding 17, police
reported. Saade escaped injury.
   The right-wing Christian leader said later he did not believe it
was an assassination attempt because ``the route I took ... is not
the road I usually take to my office. ... I decided only minutes
before leaving my house to take this route.''
   In Damascus, Shiite Moslem militias sponsored by Syria and Iran
signed a peace agreement aimed at ending a 9-month-old war in south
Lebanon and Beirut's Moslem sector in which more than 500 people
have been killed and nearly 2,000 wounded.
   Saade, 57, was riding in a bulletproof blue Alfa Romeo driven by
a chauffeur and escorted by three carloads of bodyguards. Two
bodyguards were among the dead and about 10 cars were destroyed.
   No group claimed responsibility immediately for the third car
bombing in Beirut this month. Eleven people have been killed and 47
wounded.
   A broadcast on Voice of Free Lebanon radio owned by the Lebanese
Forces, the main Christian militia, accused the Syria's intelligence
service. It said the Syrians, ``or their secret hands, are again ...
resorting to the cowardly car bombing method that has filled their
bloody record in Lebanon.''
   There was no response from Syria, which has 40,000 soldiers in
Lebanon and has become its chief power broker during more than 13
years of sectarian civil war.
   More than a dozen car-bomb assassination attempts have been made
on Moslem and Christian government leaders, politicians and militia
commanders since the civil war began.
   A red Renault packed with an estimated 110 pounds of TNT exploded
as Saade's motorcade moved along a boulevard near a cemetery in the
Furn el-Shubback residential distriict, police said.
   Elias Elias, chief of Saade's 12 bodyguards, told reporters they
surrounded the Phalangist leader immediately and ``fired in the air
to prevent anyone from approaching while we helped him out of his
damaged car. We then put him in another car and sped off.''
   Saade, whose party is a traditional force in the Christian
community, said on his party's Voice of Lebanon radio later that he
did not believe the bomb was meant for him.
   He said he thought is was intended to disrupt Arab League efforts
to resolve a political crisis that threatens Lebanon with permanent
partition along sectarian lines.
   ``Some people wanted to scuttle this initiative,'' he said, but
did not elaborate.
   An Arab League committee in Tunis is trying to reconcile
Lebanon's rival Moslem and Christian governments so Parliament can
name a president to replace Amin Gemayel, whose six-year term ended
Sept. 22. Gemayel's father, the late Pierre Gemayel, founded the
Phalange.
   The Voice of Lebanon quoted Gen. Michel Aoun, acting prime
minister of the Christian cabinet, as saying from Tunis the bombing
was directed at the reconciliation meetings and ``legitimate
security'' in Christian east Beirut.
   In Damascus, the mainstream Amal militia and fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God _ sponsored by Syria and Iran
respectively _ signed an eight-point peace accord at the Foreign
Ministry, Syria's official news agency reported.
   Leaders of the militias and the two foreign ministers worked out
the agreement, which calls for an immediate cease-fire and exchange
of prisoners. It also decrees an end to hostile propaganda and
provides that a joint operations center against Israel be
established in south Lebanon.
   Amal, which means Hope in Arabic, and Hezbollah have been
struggling for supremacy among the 1 million Shiites who make up
Lebanon's largest sect.
   In an apparent setback for Hezbollah, the agreement gives Amal
control of security in south Lebanon and emphasizes that the Syrian
army is responsible for security in Beirut's Moslem areas.
   Hezbollah was seeking to set up an Islamic republic in south
Lebanon along the lines of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei's Iran, and
also had been trying to expand into west Beirut from its base in the
south Beirut slums.
   Under the agreement, both sides also agree not to harm U.N.
peacekeeping forces ``or the personnel of international
organizations'' in Lebanon, the Syrian news agency said.
   Fundamentalist Shiites have clashed frequently with U.N.
peacekeepers in south Lebanon and several foreigners working for
humanitarian agencies have been kidnapped.
   Sheik Ibrahim Amin, a Hezbollah leader, said there was no
connection between the peace agreement and Western hostages in
Lebanon. ``This matter has no relation to us or with the
agreement,'' he said.
   Most of the 15 missing Westerners, who include nine Americans,
are believed held by Shiite factions linked to Hezbollah.

<HEAD>Journalists Call for Legal Underground Publications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official journalists' union called
for legalizing underground publications and invited back members
expelled for independent political views, a news report said Monday.
   The calls come after months of increasing openness in the
domestic press and growing debate among national leaders over social
and economic reform.
   In an unusual admission of a personal change of heart, the
Communist Party's chief ideologist, Janos Berecz, told the
journalists' gathering he realized he must now stand ``on the side
of reform,'' said the Magyar Nemzet daily.
   He has been considered a conservative hardliner, but he has made
recent remarks that were surprisingly pro-reform.
   His statement at the journalists' conference suggested that
reformers have gained the upper hand in the party in the battle over
social and ecnomic changes.
   Over the weekend, Politburo member Imre Pozsgay made the
startling statement that the 1956 uprising that was crushed by
Soviet tanks should be seen as a popular revolt. Officials have
called it a ``counterrevolution'' for 30 years.
   During a weekend conference, the state-run journalists' union
said journalists should be allowed to make their own decisions
without waiting for approval from higher officials. Berecz appeared
to sanction this stand.
   He said the party ``is not quite capable of directing the
processes,'' the newspaper reported. It also quoted him as saying,
``The media are not open enough to give free scope to fresh
initiatives.''
   Hungary's official media has become increasingly open, reporting
on issues once considered taboo. New publications have sprung up
that would not have been permitted a year ago.
   At its weekend meeting, the 6,000-member union also condemned
discriminatory policies toward samizdat, or underground publications.
   ``We recognize the right of the `samizdat' publications to
existence, even if, until recently ... such newssheets were
harassed,'' the newspaper quoted the meeting's final document as
saying.
   The conference also expressed support for a proposal to readmit
union members who were ``unjustly discriminated against'' after the
communists took power in 1948, the 1956 uprising, and Hungary's
participation in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Scores of journalists were expelled from the union for their
independent views after those events.

<HEAD>Tibetans Accuse Chinese Of Killing Panchen Lama</HEAD>

   Police on Monday arrested 24 Tibetan
demonstrators who accused the Chinese of killing the Panchen Lama,
the second-ranking leader of Tibetan Buddhism, Press Trust of India
said.
   In Switzerland on Monday, the exiled Dalai Lama, who is spiritual
and temporal leader to the Tibetans, eulogized the Panchen Lama as a
``freedom fighter.''
   His announcement was a surprise. When the Dalai Lama fled Tibet
after a failed uprising in 1959, the Panchen Lama backed the
communists, became their chief spokesman on Sino-Tibetan unity and
was considered a collaborator.
   China's official Xinhua news agency reported the 50-year-old
Panchen Lama, who lived in Beijing, died Saturday of a heart attack
in the Tibetan town of Xigaze. He had traveled there to dedicate a
shrine.
   Press Trust of India quoted a spokesman for the arrested Tibetans
as saying the Panchen Lama had no history of heart trouble.
   The spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, claimed Chinese
authorities killed the Panchen Lama ``because he could not be a
puppet.''
   Indian police arrested the Tibetans, who were demonstrating
outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi, and charged them with
breaking the peace.
   At the time of his death, the 10th Panchen Lama was vice chairman
of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, and honorary
president of the Chinese Buddhists' Association.
   He often had denied charges by exiles that Tibetans continue to
be arrested and persecuted for voicing opposition to Chinese rule.
In recent years, however, Tibet's second-highest priest openly
discussed the sufferings of Tibetans since the communist army
occupied the sparsely populated mountain area in 1950.
   ``The Panchen Rinpoche fought for the rights of the Tibetan
people during the most difficult period,'' said a statement from the
Dalai Lama's European headquarters in Zurich. ``He was indeed a
freedom fighter. His sudden demise is a great loss and I am deeply
grieved.''
   He declared three days of mourning to be observed in Dharmsala,
the Indian home-in-exile shared by the Dalai Lama and some of the
100,000 Tibetans who fled with him.
   ``As recently as last week, the Panchen Lama admonished China's
repressive rule in Tibet,'' said the statement. ``He noted that
China's mistakes in Tibet were greater than their successes.''
   It was one of the Panchen Lama's strongest statements and was
quoted by two official Chinese dailies, which reported that he also
said Tibetans have paid too high a price for their development under
the Chinese.
   Recently, the Panchen Lama had echoed the Dalai Lama's calls for
more autonomy for Tibetans.
   Kesang Tseten was born in February 1938 in Qinghai, the province
northeast of Tibet that also has a large Tibetan population. At age
3, he was named by Tibetan religious leaders as one of three
candidates considered possible reincarnates of the ninth Panchen
Lama, who died in 1937.
   After several years of wrangling, and championed by the Chinese
communists, Kesang was approved as the 10th Panchen Lama on June 3,
1949.
   Despite his support for the communists, the Chinese jailed the
Panchen Lama for 20 months during the Cultural Revolution and kept
him under house arrest for nine years. He was allowed to return to
Tibet only in 1982.
   It could take several years to determine the 11th Panchen Lama.

   Olympic diver Bruce Kimball was sentenced
today to 17 years in prison for killing two people and injuring four
others when his car plowed into a group of teen-agers last August.
   The 1984 Olympic silver medalist, who was legally drunk at the
time, must serve an additional 15 years probation, Hillsborough
Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe ruled.
   ``You must be punished,'' Coe told Kimball after the 3{-hour
sentencing hearing. ``You must suffer the consequences of drunken
driving, and we must stop it.''
   The 15-year probation will include community work aimed at
teaching young people the dangers of alcohol, Coe said.
   Kimball, 25, has been in jail since earlier this month, when he
pleaded guilty to two drunken driving manslaughter and three great
bodily injury counts.
   Today, he changed the plea to no contest, a technical move aimed
at making it easier for victims to recover damages from his
automobile insurance company.
   Kimball, dressed in a blue jail uniform, stood impassively before
the judge during the hearing. He did not react visibly when the
sentence was read.
   Under state sentencing guidelines, Kimball's penalty had to fall
between seven and 22 years.
   Coe, who also revoked Kimball's license, noted that most
prisoners serve only 20 percent to 30 percent of their sentences.
Under those circumstances, Kimball could be free in as few as three
years.
   Prosecutors said Kimball, who had a blood alcohol count of twice
the legal limit, was driving 75 mph on a darkened road near Brandon
just outside of Tampa on Aug. 1 when his car plowed into a group of
teen-agers gathered at a dead end.
   Assistant State Attorney John Skye said Kimball ``was not just a
little careless, he was not just a little negligent.''
   The accident occurred while Kimball was in training to qualify
for the 1988 U.S. Olympic team. He was released on bond. Families of
the victims attended the Olympic trials in Indianapolis to protest
his quest for a place on the team. Kimball failed to qualify.
   About 25 people, including attorneys and members of both
Kimball's and the victims' families, stood before the bench as Coe
read the sentence.
   Kimball's parents had tearfully asked for mercy for their son.
   Coe indicated he listened to their plea, noting that the sentence
had to reflect punishment and deterrence, but ``at the same time
show credit for honesty and lack of intent'' in the accident.

   A black fedora worn by the ``Bad'' boy of pop,
Michael Jackson, sold for $1,400 at an auction held by a former
sister-in-law.
   ``This was my birthday present, my Christmas present and my
anniversary present,'' said Donna Frieden, a voice-over artist who
snapped up the hat at Sunday's auction. ``I'm not going to buy any
clothes for a long time.''
   The fedora was among ``warehouses and warehouses'' of Jackson
clan memorabilia that Enid Jackson said she was awarded in her
recent divorce from Michael Jackson's older brother Jackie. She said
she planned to sell off the items because she didn't want to pay for
their storage and maintenance.
   Eager fans also bought a jumpsuit, a tiger-skin patterned leotard
and several gold and platinum records at the auction at the North
Hollywood warehouse.
   The biggest buyer was Brian Murphy, in charge of buying rock
memorabilia for display at Hard Rock Cafe clubs. Murphy spent about
$12,000 for more than a dozen Jackson items for the cafe's London
restaurant and branches under construction in Washington and Boston.

   Actress Kathleen Turner and comedian
Robin Williams have been named 1989 Man and Woman of the Year for
making ``a lasting contribution to the world of entertainment,''
Hasty Pudding Theatricals announced Monday.
   The group of Harvard University students, the nation's oldest
college theatrical organization, bestows the honor each year.
Previous recipients include Elizabeth Taylor, Lucille Ball, James
Stewart and Paul Newman.
   Ms. Turner, currently appearing in ``The Accidental Tourist,''
was called a ``stellar and versatile acress whose combination of
sass and glamour has defined her as a leading actress of our
generation.'' Ms. Turner, also known for such films as ``Body
Heat,'' ``Romancing the Stone'' and ``Peggy Sue Got Married,'' will
be honored Feb. 14 with a parade through Cambridge.
   Williams was cited as ``probably the only actor who can claim to
have portrayed a cartoon character, a real-life character and an
alien.'' His work includes the movies ``Popeye,'' ``The World
According to Garp'' and ``Good Morning, Vietnam.'' He played an
alien in the TV series ``Mork and Mindy.''
   Williams will be honored Feb. 21 at the premiere of ``Whiskey
Business,'' Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 141st annual musical.

   When Lt. Columbo returns to television after a
10-year hiatus, he'll be older but otherwise unchanged, says the
actor who made the rumpled and rambling investigator famous.
   The same old raincoat, the same old car _ only the dog had to be
changed for the upcoming ABC Mystery Movie, Peter Falk said in an
article he co-wrote for the Feb. 4 issue of TV Guide magazine.
   ``Making sure the show would be exactly the same after a 10-year
absence wasn't easy,'' Falk wrote. ``I must say my mouth fell open
when I heard Universal Studios, which makes the show, sold Columbo's
car.''
   Universal was able to track down the Ohio couple who owned the
Peugot that had been used in the show, and they lent it to the
studio for the new episode.
   The dog will have to be updated, however. The original bassett
hound had died; a much younger replacement was aged with makeup,
Falk wrote.
   Although the world has changed around Columbo in the last decade,
the disheveled detective is not about to alter his style, Falk said.
   ``Columbo in 1989 is not thinking about giving up cigars. He's
just thinking, `Gee, it's getting harder and harder to bum a
match.'''

   Matt Biondi, holder of five world swimming
records and winner of seven Olympics medals, was used to wearing a
wetsuit, but the cape, crown and trident that went with it were a
bit much.
   Biondi admitted to being a little embarrassed at his King Neptune
regalia as he presided Sunday over a Mississippi River boat parade
that was part of early Mardi Gras festivities.
   ``You've got to realize that the things I've been doing for the
past three months were coat-and-tie. Autograph things,'' he said. ``
... And here I am dressed up like Spider-man.''
   The cloak and crown were picked up at a costume shop, but his
blue-and-gray wetsuit and trident had to be custom-made for his
6-foot-6 frame. Organizers said the tridents from the costume shops
looked like salad forks in his hands.
   Although swimming no longer dominates his life, Biondi has hardly
become a land-lubber. He had plans to take a Caribbean scuba cruise
and start training for the U.S. water polo team for the 1992
Olympics.

   Peter Duran was moved to rewrite the language read
by blind North Americans when he presented awards to four women who
had translated a math book into Braille.
   He gave one woman an award for translating questions into the
literary code; another got an award for translating equations into
the math code; the third award was for handling the text code for
geography; and the last was for translating computer exercises.
   ``None of these ladies could read the other's code, yet an
11-year-old is supposed to get all this stuff,'' Duran said. ``This
was the final straw!''
   Duran and four other blind men from academia and industry have
launched a battle to unify the system of dots into one consistent
language.
   ``The current Braille system is one of the blind child's greatest
handicaps,'' according to the first newsletter from Braille Research
and Literacy Inc., Duran's group. ``BRL intends to remove this quite
unnecessary burden by creating a single unified but simple Braille
code.''
   Floyd Cargill, chairman of the Braille Authority of North
America, the standard-setting organization for Braille, says Braille
works and does not need fixing. The National Federation of the Blind
has not taken a stance one way or the other.
   Braille patterns of one to six raised dots in various
combinations represent the letters A through Z, and 37 other
combinations form common contractions or symbols. The 64th possible
``cell'' is a blank space.
   The five common Braille codes _ literary, math, computer,
geography and music _ share the 26 symbols representing the
alphabet, but the other 37 can have entirely different meanings from
code to code.
   A semicolon in the literary code is a 2 in the math code, and
some contradictory symbols are much more confusing. A blind student
may grow up believing there are different kinds of periods but be
unable to distinguish between open or closed parentheses _ a
significant handicap when working with a computer.
   ``In print you almost have an infinite variety of squiggles that
you can use to form letters and numbers and punctuation,'' not to
mention type styles, said Abraham Nemeth, the blind designer of the
internationally recognized Nemeth Braille Math Code.
   ``Those 64 Braille symbols have got to make do for all the
notations that you have in print,'' Nemeth added.
   He said a unified Braille code could encourage some blind people
to rely less on tape recordings and audio computer programs in
business and education.
   Tim Cranmer, director of research for the National Association
for the Blind and a designer of the computer code for Braille,
supports unifying the Braille codes by building on the existing
modes.
   ``It would be a mistake to invent a new code,'' Cranmer said.
``What we want to do is combine the best elements of the existing
codes so there would be very little learning to do.''
   But as far as Duran and his associates are concerned, developing
the new code, with the help of a computer programmed for coding
theory, is the easy part. Convincing people of the need to adapt is
the hard part.
   When they've accumulated adequate backing, Duran, physicist John
Covici, computer programmers Richard Gage and Robert LaGrone, and
job placement specialist Don Breda will launch a national effort to
sway people toward a better Braille.
   Duran noted that many magazines and technical manuals are never
read by the blind because they are too complicated to translate, and
said a unified code could make it easier to produce more current
reading material.
   ``The reality is that there's so few books and it takes so long
to produce them that they're out of date,'' said Duran, 46, whose
computer products company provides computer access to the blind and
visually impaired through audio accessories and large-print screens.
   ``We have to convince adults that there's more to read. ... If
they're willing to change a litle and to grow, they'll have more
access to the world than they ever realized.''

   Americans favor stringent new anti-terrorist
measures to bolster international airline security, but by a wide
margin they say poor airplane maintenance is a greater threat than
terrorism, a poll has found.
   A majority in the Media General-Associated Press survey said
current airline security is inadequate. Nearly three-quarters
favored mandatory hand-searches of all checked bags, and half backed
a ban on carry-on bags.
   Still, terrorism was not seen as the chief danger to air
travelers. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents said inadequate
airplane maintenance was a greater threat than terrorism, while just
24 percent saw terrorism as the greater hazard. Twelve percent had
no opinion.
   The national survey of 1,162 adults found majority backing for
U.S. military strikes against countries that support terrorists, but
only if the support were proved and innocent civilians were not
killed.
   Opinion was sharply divided on whether military retaliation would
deter terrorists. But majorities said the United States can take
steps to reduce terrorism.
   The survey, which had a three-point margin of error, was
conducted by telephone Jan. 4-12, the month after a terrorist bomb
downed Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland, killing all 259 aboard and
11 on the ground.
   In response to the attack, the Federal Aviation Administration
ordered U.S. airlines to X-ray all checked baggage on flights from
Europe and the Mideast. The poll found support for other steps, some
considerably tougher:
   _ Ninety-six percent said foreign airlines should be required to
X-ray checked baggage.
   _ Seventy-three percent supported requiring airlines to
hand-search all checked baggage on international flights, even if
passengers had to check in three hours before takeoff. That is the
practice on Israel's El Al airline, the leader in anti-terrorist
measures.
   _ Half supported banning carry-on luggage on international
flights. Such a ban has been used by British Airways on flights into
Belfast, Northern Ireland, during periods of political tension.
   Fifty-seven percent said airlines should be required to announce
all terrorist threats they receive, but respondents were split
evenly on whether the government should announce all threats it
receives against airlines.
   That issue arose when it was revealed that U.S. officials were
warned before the Pan Am attack that a bombing was imminent, but did
not reveal the threat. Officials said they get warnings virtually
daily, cannot verify them and could cripple the airline industry by
announcing them.
   The poll asked if the government should announce terrorist
threats even if it gets them on a daily basis and cannot tell if
they are legitimate. Forty-five percent said yes, 45 percent said no
and the rest were not sure.
   On military retaliation, 55 percent said the United States should
strike against other nations if it has proof they supported
terrorists who attacked U.S. citizens. The sentiment spanned
ideologies, but was backed more by men, 64 percent, than women, 45
percent.
   However, nearly a third of those who supported military strikes
said they would change their view if the action might kill innocent
people. Only a third of the respondents favored strikes in which
civilians could die.
   Moreover, an 84 percent opposed military retaliation if the
United States lacked direct proof of another nation's involvement.
   Opinion was split on the effect of a U.S. attack on a nation that
supports terrorism. Nearly one-third said that would only provoke
more terrorist attacks, while a third said it would be a deterrent.
The rest either said it would have no effect or had no opinion.
   Still, six in 10 said the United States can take steps to reduce
terrorist attacks significantly, and 57 percent said the government
should be doing more to protect Americans from terrorism.

   Foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq may meet
in New York next week if the United Nations secretary-general
believes it would be helpful, a senior Iraqi official said Monday.
   The two sides have agreed to hold direct talks on curbing
violations of the Aug. 20 gulf war cease-fire, but no date has been
set for the military committee to meet.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz plans to be in New York next
week when the U.N. Security Council reviews the mandate for its 350
cease-fire observers, Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon told The
Associated Press.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati also is expected
there, he said. He added that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar would decide on a bilateral meeting.
   Jan Eliasson, the U.N. special envoy, said Sunday the decision
would be made after Perez de Cuellar assesses results of the talks
in Iran and Iraq.
   Eliasson, Sweden's U.N. ambassador, left Baghdad for New York on
Monday.
   His talks were aimed at resuming U.N.-sponsored peace
negotiations that broke down Aug. 25 over troop withdrawals and
ownership of the Shatt al-Arab waterway.
   Before leaving, Eliasson said the two sides agreed to form a
joint military working group to include commanders from Iran and
Iraq as well as U.N. peacekeepers. It would work on military
problems of a technical nature along the 740-mile cease-fire line,
he said.
   Hamdoon said the agreement was a step forward, but others were
needed.
   ``It helps to stabilize the cease-fire, but we don't think it
will be sufficient just to have a committee and sit back without an
(peace) agreement,'' he said.

   Unknown gunmen fired submachine guns
and pistols at the front of the residence of the Nicaraguan
ambassador, but no injuries were reported, police sources said
Monday.
   Ambassador Francisco Lacayo Parajon and his family were in
Managua, Nicaragua, when the attack occurred before dawn Sunday,
said embassy spokesman Juan Jose Membreno.
   The only damage was to the outside wall, according to the police
sources, who asked not to be identified.
   The shooting followed the killings this month of a Contra rebel
leader, the country's former top military leader and the lawyer for
a reputed drug baron.
   Membreno accused Nicaraguan Contra rebels in Honduras of the
latest shooting.
   ``The Contras accused my government of responsibility in the
assassination of anti-Sandinista chief Manuel Rugama and announced
they would take actions against our diplomatic representatives,''
Membreno said.
   A Contra source, who asked not to be identified, said, ``We did
not have anything to do with this attack.''
   Also today, police deactivated a homemade bomb in a building that
housed the offices of the Honduran National Cattlemen's Association
until 1988.
   Police sources said the four sticks of dynamite were defused
after they received a call from the construction company that now
occupies the building.

   Canada pulled out of joint cold-weather
military exercises Monday, the morning after eight soldiers were
killed in the crash of a C-130 transport plane trying to land in icy
fog at 50 degrees below zero.
   The four-engine Hercules was carrying eight crewmen and 10
paratroopers from Edmonton, Alberta, to participate in Brim Frost
'89 when it crashed Sunday night at the end of the runway at Fort
Wainwright, said U.S. Army Maj. Sherrel Mock.
   Three men were in serious condition, one was listed as stable and
six others were being held for observation at the base's Bartlett
Army Community Hospital, Mock said Monday.
   ``We don't know if the cold weather had anything to do with it,''
Mock said. ``Teams are out there right now, going through the
wreckage.
   ``The investigation is still in its early stages. They're
wondering if it was the weather or something mechanical.''
   A 450-man Canadian paratroop force was to support the U.S. Army's
1st Brigade, 6th Infantry Division (Light), in a major land battle
that was the centerpiece of the Brim Frost ground exercises near
Fairbanks.
   But after the crash, Canadian officials canceled their forces'
participation and recalled their remaining aircraft and soldiers,
Mock said.
   ``They canceled because of the equipment they lost (in the
crash),'' Mock said. ``The aircraft was bringing in equipment
ranging from snow machines to cold weather gear.''
   Military planners call Brim Frost ``the premier cold weather
training exercise in the free world.'' But temperatures plunging to
more than 60 below zero during the past two weeks have been too much
of a test.
   The bitter cold has caused metal fatigue and rubber fatigue in
trucks and aircraft, stalling equipment and generally slowing
maneuvers, Mock said.
   ``But we've been able to land aircraft,'' he said.
   ``Another Canadian C-130 had landed an hour earlier,'' he said.
``The third aircraft in the flight was diverted to the Fairbanks
airport because the runway was blocked.''
   The plane's last contact with the control tower was at 6:47 p.m.
There were no distress calls from the crew before the crash, Mock
said. There was no explosion or fire after the plane broke in two
and skidded to a halt about a quarter-mile down the runway, he said.
   ``They were able to get into the aircraft as soon as the
emergency vehicles began arriving,'' Mock said. ``With that type of
crash, with the fuselage burst, you have a problem with cold
weather. But to my knowledge, none of the injuries was due to the
cold.''
   Six victims were dead on arrival at the Army hospital and two
others died later, he said.
   About 26,000 servicemen, 120 aircraft and 1,000 vehicles from the
U.S. Army, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, Civil
Air Patrol, reserve units and Canadian Forces were participating in
the arctic training exercise. The $15 million exercise began Jan. 20
and is to continue through Feb. 1.
   Lockheed C-130s, which have a wingspan of more than 130 feet, are
military workhorses used to transport soldiers and equipment. First
delivered to the U.S. military in 1956, they have been involved in
several crashes in recent years.
   In the most recent crash before Sunday, a C-130 plunged into a
field in June about a mile short of the airport in Greenville,
Miss., killing the six Air National Guardsmen on board.
   But Joe Dabney, a spokesman for Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.
in Marietta, Ga., said Monday the Hercules has been one of the most
popular and longest-running transport planes ever produced.
   More than 1,870 C-130s in more than 50 versions have been
delivered to operators in more than 60 nations, Dabney said.
   He said C-130s were introduced to the Antarctic in 1960 and are
flown in both the arctic and Antarctic by the U.S. military.
   ``The C-130's safety and reliability record in both polar regions
has been outstanding. The C-130s used in the arctic and the
Antarctic are ski-equipped as well as wheeled versions of the
Hercules aircraft,'' Dabney said.
   ``The Lockheed C-130 is one of the world's safest and most
reliable transports, and is the most widely used airlifter of its
type in the world.''

<HEAD>Blind Broncos Fan Keeps Season Ticket, Thanks To New Friends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A price hike was a blessing in disguise for a
68-year-old blind man who had been prepared to sell a prized
possession _ a season ticket on the 45-yard line to Denver Broncos
games.
   After 22 years as a season ticket holder, Bobbie Shepard figured
the football club's $40 boost in saeason ticket prices was too much
for his meager income. He placed a classified ad in The Denver Post
on Sunday, offering to sell his $300 season pass.
   But after a story in Sunday's Post detailed his problem,
Shepard's phone began ringing.
   ``The first one came at 6:30 in the morning,'' Shepard said. ``I
tried to eat my breakfast, but I couldn't get it eaten. Every time I
took a bite the phone would ring again.''
   By the time it stopped, Shepard had 15 offers to pay for his $300
ticket.
   By 10 a.m., Boulder lawyer Dan Caplis had arrived at Shepard's
home and handed him a check for the $300, and offered to pay for the
ticket every season Shepard wants it.
   ``I'm happy to do it,'' Caplis said. ``I think the Broncos need
more fans like Bobbie. It just seemed to me that he was a gutsy,
courageous guy, and he should be there. It only seems right.''
   The whole experience left Shepard a little overwhelmed.
   ``I think this shows there are a lot of good people out there.
I'm so thankful. I don't really know what to say.''

<HEAD>Daughter of Cult Leader Apparently Kills Self</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police are investigating the apparent suicide of
the estranged daughter of the founder of a polygamist cult because
of the cult's reputation for ``blood atonement'' against defectors.
   Lillian Chynoweth, 33, a daughter of the late Ervil LeBaron,
founder of the Church of the Lamb of God, was shot once in the head,
Lt. Richard Holland said.
   Mrs. Chynoweth was found dead in her Houston home Saturday by her
13-year-old daughter, who was awakened by the gunshot. A
.357-caliber pistol was nearby.
   The pistol, Holland said, had been given to Mrs. Chynoweth's
14-year-old son by a family friend _ for protection in light of the
killings last June of Mrs. Chynoweth's husband, her brother-in-law
and a niece.
   There were no signs of forced entry or foul play, Holland said.
In addition, he said, Mrs. Chynoweth had been seeking treatment for
depression and had recently talked of suicide.
   Preliminary evidence points to suicide, ``but the investigation
is ongoing,'' Holland said. ``We are approaching it cautiously
because of the history of the family.''
   Last June 27, Mrs. Chynoweth's 36-year-old husband, Mark, was
found shot dead in his office at his Houston appliance store.
Minutes later, his brother, Duane, 31, and Duane's daughter,
Jennifer, 10, were found shot to death in the driveway of a vacant
home, where they had been called under the guise of delivering a new
washing machine.
   At the same time, Eddie Marston, 32, one of Ervil LeBaron's
stepsons and charged but never convicted as a killer for LeBaron,
was shot in Irving.
   The killings remain unsolved.
   ``It is reasonable to conclude that some of the things that
caused her depression were related to the murder of her husband,''
Holland said.
   Mrs. Chynoweth's brother, Isaac LeBaron, 20, committed suicide in
1983. He had suffered ``massive depression'' and had been released
from a hospital the day before his death.
   Isaac LeBaron was instrumental in the conviction of Ervil
LeBaron, sentenced to life in Utah State Prison in 1979 for ordering
the murder of Utah polygamist Rulon Allred. He later died in prison.
   Ervil's death in 1981 prompted the Chynoweths' defection from the
cult and their move to Houston, Holland said.
   Ervil believed he was ``the one mighty and strong prophet of
God'' and vowed in 1970 after a split with his brother, Joel, that
``blood will run to solve our problems.''
   The LeBaron group is believed responsible for at least 18
killings. The current leaders appear to operate from Mexico.

<HEAD>Disease Strikes Dogwood Seedlings at Test Site Near Camp David</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush may not be seeing the dogwoods
bloom this spring at Camp David because of a devastating fungus
disease that could become a national epidemic among the native
trees, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   USDA plant geneticist Frank S. Santamour said that the disease
has swept through native dogwood seedlings at a test site near the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains. The seedlings
were from 17 states and proved highly susceptible to anthracnose
disease.
   ``They all declined in vigor, and after two years 75 percent were
dead,'' Santamour said. He predicted that all of the test seedlings
will be dead by the end of 1989.
   Santamour, who works for the department's Agricultural Research
Service at the National Arboretum in Washington, said no North
American flowering dogwood trees of the species Cornus florida are
known to resist the disease.
   Asiatic or Chinese dogwood, Cornus kousa, which produces flowers
similar to C. florida, showed some leaf spotting from the disease
but otherwise were said to have performed well in Santamour's study.
   The fungus that causes dogwood anthracnose has not been
identified exactly, he said. But there appears to be no insect
carrier of the fungus, as with Dutch elm disease. The dogwood fungus
depends on wind and water to spread from tree to tree.
   Santamour said the origin of the disease outbreak is obscure. It
began in the late 1970s on the West Coast among C. nuttallii
dogwoods and the C. florida on the East Coast, he said.
   ``However, we can probably rule out environmental stress as a
casual factor,'' Santamour said.
   A 1984 survey of nearly 50,000 dogwoods in Catoctin Mountain Park
by the U.S. Park Service and USDA's Forest Service confirmed
scattered reports of the new devastating disease among the native
dogwoods.
   Santamour there is probably little hope for finding native
dogwoods resistant to anthracnose.
   ``If the disease continues to spread, nursery workers should be
cautioned against premature judgments on relative resistance of
plants that may have merely escaped the path of infection,'' he said.
   But Santamour said he found that dogwoods planted on lawns and
parks in the Catoctin area seem to have a better survival rate that
those in the forest.
   Dogwoods in the study were grown from seeds from Alabama,
Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

<TEXT>
   Michel Virally, an arbitrator at
the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal and a world renowned authority on
international law, has died at the age of 67, the tribunal said
Monday.
   Virally, a Frenchman who died Saturday in Paris, had gone on sick
leave in July for stomach surgery, and had been ailing since,
according to tribunal sources. The exact cause of death was not
disclosed.
   Virally had been one of the three third-nation arbitrators at the
tribunal, which was established by the 1981 Algiers Accords.
   There were three American and three Iranian arbitrators on the
nine-man Hague panel, which is charged with settling billions of
dollars of financial disputes between the United States and Iran
arising out of the 1979 Iranian revolution.
   Virally, who took up his tribunal post July 1, 1985, was a
professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in
Geneva. He also had served as professor of international law and
head of the Department of Public International Law and International
Organizations at the university.
   A holder of the French Legion of Honor, Virally also was an ad
hoc judge at the International Court of Justice here. He had been
named to that post for a border dispute case involving El Salvador
and Honduras.
   Virally is survived by his wife, Danielle, a son and daughter. A
memorial service is planned in Paris.

<HEAD>Halsted Street Twins Offer Fresh Rolls, Frosted with Insults</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ben and Al Kohn serve up a little sass with the
coffee and sweet rolls at the break of dawn, jolting customers awake
before the caffeine can.
   For four years the 70-year-old Kohn twins have opened the doors
of the storefront coffee shop on Halsted Street at 3 a.m. and
dispensed insults and bad jokes along with the java, newspapers,
cigarettes, gum and other small items they sell.
   ``I guess people feel they can face anything the day brings after
facing the twins at 4:30 in the morning,'' said police Lt. Wayne
Wiberg, a longtime patron.
   Another officer on the beat, Sgt. Henry Pate, joked, ``They have
only one driver's license between them. One day we'll have to
fingerprint them to figure them out.''
   Although the store is only a few years old, the twins have lived
on the block all their lives. No one calls them Ben or Al because no
one knows which is which. They are known simply as ``the twins.''
   The two were born in a building across the street from the cafe,
the youngest of 12 children. They ran their father's handrolled
cigar and cigarette business in that building and sold hotdogs and
beer at two ballparks for 22 years.
   When the building burned down four years ago, the Kohns began the
coffee shop. They sleep in back on twin beds. Ben Kohn is divorced,
his brother a widower.
   The place, which has no name out front, is simple _ three
mismatched counters, a big space heater that switches on and off as
people warm their backsides, a dozen bar stools, a cash register and
two worn chairs where the twins sit and look out onto the street
when things are quiet.
   Despite the yelling inside the store, the twins have an
understated tolerance of ethnic differences in the blue-collar
neighborhood. They have learned to yell, curse and say ``Good
Morning'' and ``Get out, ya bum'' in Yiddish, Spanish, Lithuanian,
Polish, Italian and Greek.
   They go to sleep at 10 p.m., wake up about 1 a.m., pick up the
fresh rolls and open by 3 a.m., seven days a week.
   ``Retirement ain't for us,'' Al Kohn said one morning, sitting by
the sink.
   ``Routine. We're master of routine,'' said his brother as the two
lit cigarettes at the same time. ``Everyone knows we're always
here.''

<DATELINE>MOLESWORTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last NATO base to receive U.S.
cruise missiles was the first to be deactivated Monday under the
terms of the superpowers' arms control treaty.
   In a short ceremony at the Molesworth base, 70 miles north of
London, members of the U.S. Air Force 303rd Tactical Mission wing
were advised: ``Mission complete.''
   Reporters and photographers, including several from the Soviet
news media, were then permitted to tour the four empty bunkers that
until last year housed 16 operational and two spare cruise missiles.
   ``To me, this is a milestone in the implementation of the INF
treaty,'' said Maj. Gen. Marcus Anderson, commander of the 3rd Air
Force, referring to the arms control agreement signed by former
President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The treaty, signed in December 1987, calls for the elimination by
1991 of 2,700 Soviet and U.S. land-based intermediate-range nuclear
missiles _ those with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles.
   ``This was the first operational cruise missile unit to be
inactivated,'' Anderson said. ``The treaty is being implemented in
the timetable that was presented.''
   Anderson said the removal of the cruise missiles represented to
him ``the fact that we can successfully negotiate treaties for arms
reduction.''
   Molesworth was one two bases in Britain designated in 1980 to
receive a total of 160 U.S. cruise missiles, although only 16 of its
planned 64 operational missiles had arrived before the treaty was
signed.
   The other base, Greenham Common, 50 miles west of London, houses
96 missiles, which are scheduled to begin leaving ``towards the end
of this year,'' said British Defense Ministry spokesman Martin Helm.
The base will be deactivated at an unspecified time before 1991,
Helm said.
   The missiles and their launchers left Molesworth between
September and November last year for Davis Montah Base in Tucson,
Ariz., to be destroyed under the watch of Soviet inspectors.
   The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament welcomed the removal of
cruise missiles from Molesworth, said spokeswoman Sheena Philips.
``But we remain concerned about NATO's plans to bring in new
generations'' of nuclear weapons.
   Spray-painted in big red letters on a highway overpass near the
base is the slogan ``What about the nuclear warheads?''
   The missile warheads, which are not covered by the treaty, remain
on site, although U.S. officials have said they will be returned to
the United States eventually.
   Molesworth was not closed, since 160 of the its 800 American
airmen and women are waiting to be reassigned. And, under the
treaty, Soviet inspectors have the right to inspect the base until
2001 to ensure the missiles have not returned.
   Molesworth, a Royal Air Force base, is expected to remain in
American hands, although the British, American and NATO officials
responsible for the decision have not announced how it will be used.
The 600-acre site, a World War II bomber base, was renovated to
house cruise missiles at a cost of $79 million.
   The first cruise missiles arrived in Europe in 1983 and were
deployed at Greenham Common. The Molesworth missiles were the last
to be deployed, in November 1987.
   The Soviets began removing some of their SS-20 missiles targeted
at Western Europe in February 1988. The first American missiles,
nine Pershing 2s, were removed Sept. 1, 1988, from a base in West
Germany.
   The last of the 16 operational and four spare cruise missiles
stored in Belgium left Dec. 13, making it the first Western country
to have all the required weapons withdrawn under the U.S.-Soviet
treaty.
   NATO was to have deployed 572 cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in
five European countries.
   Officials at NATO, at the U.S. Air Force's British and its
European headquarters, and at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers,
Europe, were unable Monday to say how many had so far been removed.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson in Soviet Union to Organize Telethon for Quake Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Monday he met with an
adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials
in an attempt to organize a superpower telethon to aid victims of
Armenia's earthquake.
   Jackson arrived in the Soviet Union on Sunday to promote his plan
for the fund-raising broadcast and also to gauge political and
economic reforms made under Gorbachev, Soviet leader since March
1985.
   It was the first trip to the Soviet Union for Jackson, who met
with Gorbachev at the Geneva summit in 1985.
   The two men had been scheduled to meet again during Gorbachev's
December visit to New York, but the Soviet leader cut short his trip
and returned to Moscow because of the Armenian earthquake.
   ``The paradox is that this crisis gave us the opportunity to
serve, to help melt the icy walls of the Cold War,'' Jackson said.
   He told reporters he hoped the Armenia benefit telethon would
raise money to help buy prefabricated housing for some of the
500,000 people left homeless by the Dec. 7 quake that killed 25,000
people.
   Jackson declined to reveal details of his plans for the telethon,
saying he preferred to have everything organized first. But his
spokesman, Eric Easter, said organizers had been in touch with
entertainers Cher, Bill Cosby, B.B. King, Eddie Murphy and others.
   ``We would like it to be a simulcast, say from Armenia, Moscow,
New York and Los Angeles,'' Easter said. He said organizers hoped
the telethon could be organized for broadcast in March or April.
   Jackson, the former Democratic presidential candidate, met Monday
with various Soviet officials, including Gorbachev adviser Anatoly
F. Dobrynin, the former Soviet ambassador to Washington, and with
the Soviet minister of culture, to secure the participation of
Soviet entertainers in the telethon.
   He also said he met for about 1{ hours with human rights activist
Andrei D. Sakharov, the 1975 Nobel Peace laureate.
   Jackson said Sakharov expressed support for organizing aid to
Armenia, but was concerned about the fate of Armenian activists who
had been arrested following the earthquake.
   Jackson said he would meet Tuesday with Alexander M. Yakovlev, a
member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo, and with the head of
Gostelradio, the Soviet state broadcasting committee.
   Jackson is also scheduled to visit the earthquake zone in Armenia
and to meet with Vasgen I, the head of the Armenian Apostolic
Church, before leaving the Soviet Union on Friday.

   A Jewish organization said Monday it appeared
the Vatican will miss a deadline for removing a convent from the
grounds of the World War II Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.
   ``We are severely dismayed and disappointed because it appears
the convent will not be moved as stipulated'' in a 1987 agreement
between the Roman Catholic Church and Jewish groups, said Elan
Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress.
   Steinberg said a Jewish delegation visited the area of Poland
near the death camp, where the Vatican undertook to build a center
of prayer and education about the Nazi Holocaust, ``and not a spade
has been put in the ground.''
   Under the agreement, the center was also to house nuns from
Auschwitz and would be built within two years.
   A dozen nuns set up a convent in 1984 in what had been a theater
at the camp where millions of Jews were killed during World War II.
   Their move stirred a protest among Jews, who regard the site as a
memorial to the Holocaust and believe it should be left undisturbed.
   The archbishop of the French city of Lyon, Cardinal Albert
Decourtray, said last week that the nuns would move into a new
convent but he did not say where or when the building would go up.
   Steinberg called the cardinal's comments ``an apparent effort to
buy time'' in view of the Feb. 22 deadline.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration accused the Soviet
Union on Monday of pursuing a ``scorched earth'' policy in
Afghanistan as its troops head home from the war-torn country.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the Soviets
were conducting bombing raids in various areas, using both planes
based in Afghanistan and others flying from Soviet territory, while
also launching Scud missile attacks.
   By contrast, Redman said, U.S.-armed Afghan rebels were showing
restraint toward the departing Red Army, which is committed to
complete the withdrawal by Feb. 15.
   Redman gave no assessment of how fiercely the rebels were
pursuing their war against the forces of the Soviet-backed Kabul
government, nor did he offer assurances the Bush administration
would promote restraint.
   ``We support various efforts by the Afghan resistance to
formulate a political structure to replace the illegitimate regime
in Kabul,'' Redman said. ``But it is their structure. ... We don't
have a particular plan of our own.
   ``We can be helpful, but in the end this is something for the
Afghan people to determine,'' Redman said.
   Some 50,000 Soviet troops are quitting Afghanistan after nine
years of fighting alongside the Kabul government against the rebels,
who have received U.S. weapons through Pakistan.
   Both superpowers are continuing their military support.
   The withdrawal was stalled temporarily late last year by Moscow
in response to intenstified rebel attacks on the Soviet troops. The
Soviets, meanwhile, stepped up their own bombing and missile attacks.
   ``The Soviets continue what might even be called a scorched earth
policy, as they continue very, very intensive air activity,'' Redman
said.
   The attacks, he said, were ``both from aircraft based inside
Afghanistan as well as with aircraft based in the Soviet Union.''
   The U.S. spokesman added, ``We just don't believe that this kind
of a policy is what is called for at the time when Afghanistan ought
to be looking to the future.''
   With tensions rising, the United States decided last week to
temporarily close its embassy in Kabul and remove the staff of 11
American diplomats and security guards. The U.S. flag was hauled
down Monday, but the embassy staff did not leave.
   Redman said that bad weather closed the airport and that the
Americans ``are going to leave whenever weather conditions permit.''
   The embassy is near the presidential palace, the state radio and
secret police headquarters, all of which would be prime guerrilla
targets in a battle for the city.
   President Najib's government accused the United States of closing
the embassy as a means of inciting the guerrillas to more intense
warfare after the Red Army departs.
   But Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y. and the chairman of the House
Foeign Affairs Asian subcommittee, said the pullout was ``entirely
justifiable.''
   The departure of the embassy staff will leave 10 Americans in
Afghanistan, all missionaries.

   President Bush says he's not ready yet to
reveal his views on the best way to reform the savings and loan
system, but the report of a study group he headed in 1984 may be a
guide to his thinking.
   Bush's staff director for the Task Group on Regulation of
Financial Services, Washington attorney Richard Breeden, joined the
Whitst week and is expected to play the key role in
shaping the administration's S&amp;L plan, which the president hopes to
outline in a Feb. 9 speeche House staff la.
   Much has changed since Bush, then vice president, signed the task
group report. The magnitude of S&amp;L insolvencies had not yet come to
light.
   But, if the group's recommendations are any indication, they
suggest the president will take a cautious approach to reform rather
than advocate a wholesale restructuring of the industry.
   The 1984 study recognized what since has been identified as a key
contributor to the problem: permissive laws in some states that
allowed S&amp;Ls to stray into risky areas far removed from their
traditional business of making home mortgage loans.
   But rather than call for new regulation, the group emphasized a
system of incentives _ including risk-based insurance premiums and
hignd keeping
three separate insurance funds: for banks, thrifts and credit unions.
   But, it offered a mechanism for the financial system to evolve.
Thrifts that stuck primarily to mortgage lending would remain part
of a separate system. At a certain point, S&amp;Ls that entered enough
new areas, becoming more like banks, would have to join the bank
regulatory system with its stricter oversight.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, looking for
Palestinian support for a peace plan, said Monday he was willing to
work for elections in the occupied lands even if Arabs did not
immediately halt the uprising.
   An influential Moslem fundamentalist leader in the occupied Gaza
Strip said he supported the proposal.
   In Gaza, meanwhile, soldiers shot and wounded 15 Palestinians in
stone-throwing clashes, including a 16-year-old girl and a
15-year-old boy who were in critical condition, Arab doctors said.
   A 12-year-old boy was taken to a hospital in Israel with a
gunshot wound to the head, the doctors said. The army said it was
checking the reports.
   Rabin, speaking on army radio, said he was willing to drop his
earlier condition that Palestinians halt the violence of the
13-month uprising for several months before Israel would talk about
holding elections.
   Palestinians have rejected attaching preconditions to elections,
which would be the first in the territories since 1976.
   Rabin told legislators of his left-leaning Labor Party he was
willing to hold talks immediately with Palestinians. Only after
agreement was reached would hostilities have to end, he said.
   ``When there's agreement on the process, then a calm period will
have to begin, because to my mind if you want free elections they
cannot take place in an atmosphere of violence,'' Rabin said.
   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the leader of Moslem fundamentalists in the
Gaza Strip, said he supported the proposal.
   ``If there will be international supervision, there will be more
freedom for the Palestinians and this is the right way. There is no
other way to elect the representatives of the Palestinian people,''
he said on Israel Television's Arabic-language show.
   Yassin's statement apparently was aimed at the Palestine
Liberation Organization. The Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement is
competing with the PLO over influence in the occupied lands.
   The latest conflict came Monday when PLO activists persuaded
Palestinians to ignore a Hamas-declared strike.
   Yassin also said he supported meetings between Palestinians and
Israeli officials. ``There is no escape from a dialogue,'' he said.
   The Moslem leader said he would meet with Rabin if he received an
invitation, said TV reporter Yoni Ben-Menachem, who interviewed
Yassin at his Gaza home.
   Israeli leftists have called for talks with the PLO. But the
right-wing Likud bloc and leaders of the mainstream Labor Party have
rejected the group, which most Palestinians say must be their
representative in negotiations.
   Likud legislators Monday criticized Rabin for authorizing a
meeting between pro-PLO leader Faisal Husseini, who has been jailed
for most of the 13-month uprising, and Rabin's top adviser on the
territories, Shmuel Goren.
   ``I think Husseini is not an appropriate route (for talks). I
think if he were, the defense minister wouldn't have had him sitting
in jail for his part in the riots and violence,'' said Likud
legislator Binyamin Begin, son of former Prime Minister Menachem
Begin.
   Husseini said after the meeting he believed the PLO would support
elections in the territories, but that the balloting would have to
be on the question of statehood and not for local representatives as
suggested by Israeli leaders.
   Also Monday, an adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
announced Israel will go ahead with plans to build eight Jewish
settlements in the occupied lands this year despite the Arab
uprising and budget cuts.
   Michael Dekel, Shamir's adviser on settlements, said there was no
shortage of ``idealistic pioneers.''
   ``The moment people oppose you, you cannot raise your hands and
surrender, you have to struggle,'' Dekel said in an interview.
   Now, about 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers
live in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Israel seized the territories in the 1967 Middle East war, and
U.S. officials have criticized the settlements as obstacles to peace.
   The uprising is in protest of Israeli rule of the lands. Since
the revolt began, 370 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.
   The army said Monday that an Arab mukhtar, or village leader, was
found stabbed to death in the West Bank village of Beit Lid.
   The circumstances of the slaying Sunday were unclear, but Arab
reporters said Mahmoud Salem Mahmoud, 65, may have been killed
because he was suspected of working for Israeli authorities.
   Army officials say more than 30 Palestinians have been killed
during the uprising by Arabs who suspected them of being
collaborators or informants.

<HEAD>Communist Party Chief Battles Calls to Resign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Stipe Suvar
battled calls for his resignation Monday and told the Central
Committee the country faces a stark choice between more democracy or
``neo-Stalinism.''
   As liberals and hard-liners clashed, Adm. Petar Simic of the
armed forces warned the military might play a more active role in
``the battle for Yugoslavia.''
   The action took place at a key meeting of the policy-setting
Central Committee, called to discuss demands for Suvar's resignation
and a possible shake-up in the ruling elite.
   Suvar indirectly hit out at his chief political rival, Serbian
party leader Slobodan Milosevic, although he did not identify his
opponent in keeping with the convention of party solidarity.
   But his speech was a scathing attack on ``dogmatic'' policies
generally attributed to Milosevic, party chief in the largest of
Yugoslavia's six republics.
   ``Socialist political pluralism or neo-Stalinism _ those are the
two alternatives'' offered by different factions in the Communist
Party leadership to guide Yugoslavia out of its economic and
political crisis, Suvar said.
   Speaking hours later, Milosevic defended his stands and called
for sweeping changes in the leadership he blames for the current
crisis.
   ``It would be honest and intelligent that those who have clashed
with the people should allow themselves to be replaced by better and
more capable men,'' Milosevic said.
   Serbs demand Suvar's resignation and accuse him of opposing the
people's will by criticizing recent mass rallies organized by
Milosevic supporters.
   The street gatherings have torn at the country's fragile ethnic
balance and led to the ouster of several opponents of Milosevic, who
defends the rallies as a popular instrument of change.
   Milan Kucan, party chief of liberal Slovenia, told the meeting
``a feeling of revolt can be expressed on the streets, but a way out
of the crisis cannot be found there.''
   ``Yugoslavia will become a democratic community, or it will not
exist,'' said Kucan.
   The pragmatic Suvar is supported by Slovenia and his native
Croatia, which favor political pluralism, more democracy and radical
market-oriented reforms as a solution to Poland's protracted crisis.
   Yugoslavia's woes include a 250 percent inflation rate, a sharp
drop in living standards and an alarming increase in labor and
ethnic unrest.
   Milosevic, who has called for more centralized party control over
the country's affairs, draws his support from Yugoslavia's poorer
southern regions.
   They fear that market-oriented reforms would end state subsidies
for their loss-making industries and lead to massive layoffs.
   Milosevic supporters suffered an initial setback at Monday's
meeting, which in a show of hands overwhelmingly voted down a
proposal to air calls for Suvar's resignation before the party
chief's speech.
   Suvar called for more ``political pluralism which is conditional
on the competition of ideas'' as against ``the dictatorship of the
Communist Party.''
   Adm. Simic, the political chief of the armed forces, appealed to
the meeting for party unity and indicated the army might take a more
active role ``in putting a stop to confrontations between the
republics.''
   ``What some describe as the battle for Yugoslavia will not be
waged without the Yugoslav army,'' he said.
   The army has remained on the sidelines in recent political
conflicts, but senior officers show increasing unease.
   ``The situation in Yugoslavia is rapidly approaching its
culmination ... the party is losing battle after battle ... the
political system is breaking apart ... and (anti-communist)
opposition has openly entered the political scene,'' Simic said.

   A hawk intent on making a meal of two
tiny finches plunged through a bedroom window, and all three birds
emerged shaken up but unscathed.
   ``There is a hole in the glass where he was diving in. There was
glass all over the bedroom,'' said Amy Perciful.
   Ms. Perciful said she heard the ``enormous crash'' about 5:30
p.m. Sunday.
   Rushing to a bedroom, she and a friend, Terry DeLoach, found her
three-tier, bamboo finch cage swinging wildly and a gray-and-white
hawk struggling to return to freedom.
   ``He wasn't cut, but he was so scared. Terry said the hawk's
heart was beating so fast. The main thing on his (the hawk's) mind
was getting out,'' she said.
   DeLoach threw a towel over the bird, carried him outdoors, and
released him.
   Ms. Perciful cared for her finches. ``My poor little birds. I
don't know why they didn't die of a heart attack.''
   The bird probably was a goshawk, which spend the winter along the
eastern coast, said Charlie Zemp, regional marine biologist for the
state Wildlife and Marine Resources Department.

<TEXT>
   Temperatures fell as low as 64 degrees
below zero again Monday but Alaska's record cold eased in some areas
as a mass of frigid air from above the Arctic Circle headed toward
the Lower 48 states.
   Movement of the huge cold air mass that has covered Alaska for
about two weeks generated high wind that produced extremely low wind
chill factors in southern and south-central Alaska.
   And because of the wind, the Coast Guard on Monday closed the
continent's northernmost ice-free port, Valdez Harbor, to oil tanker
traffic and said it may remain closed for two days.
   The Alaska Division of Emergency Services reported continuing
problems in rural Alaska with such things as congealing fuel oil and
shortages of fuel and food. Some villages reported power outages and
freezing water and sewer pipes.
   But the division said it knew of no immediate life-threatening
situations.
   The Alaska National Guard has been on 24-hour alert to help deal
with the cold. 2nd Lt. Mike Haller said Eskimo scouts were helping
chop wood near Elim, where there was a critical fuel shortage, and
the Guard had loaned fuel to the village of Tuntutuliak in western
Alaska.
   Haller said four Alaska Air National Guard C-130 aircraft have
been on round-the-clock alert to deliver food or fuel to remote
areas if needed. Small planes have been grounded by the cold and
thick ice fog.
   ``The story now is not going to be just the cold, but the cold
and the wind,'' said Bob Hopkins, a meteorologist with the National
Weather Service in Anchorage.
   The coldest temperatures in the state were recorded in interior
communities and near the Canadian border. At Tanana, the coldest
spot in Alaska early Monday, it was 64 degrees below zero. The
school in the town at the confluence of the Yukon and Tanana rivers
was closed for the day.
   ``Sixty-four? It was 76 below here one morning,'' said Tanana Cab
Service owner Arvin Kangas. ``It's not too bad.''
   During the weekend, 17 all-time low temperature records across
the state fell, the weather service said.
   Some of the cold air had pushed 575 miles to the southeast and
nipped Juneau. The temperature there was reported at one degree
below zero. The cold air was expected to reach the Lower 48 by later
in the week, Hopkins said.
   At Valdez, Petty Officer Kim Arbaugh of the Marine Safety Office
said wind gusts had been clocked at 93 mph, making the Valdez
Narrows between the port and Prince William Sound dangerous.
   Without tankers picking up oil, Tom Brennan of the Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co. said flow through the trans-Alaska oil pipeline
from Prudhoe Bay to the marine terminal at Valdez would be reduced
by 65 percent, to 775,000 barrels daily.
   ``At 775,000 barrels, we have two and a half days' storage
capacity,'' he said.
   The temperature at Valdez was a moderate 1 degree below zero, but
that combined with the wind to produce wind chill factors to 55
below zero.
   Anchorage warmed to one degree below zero by early Monday, but
30-knot wind produced a wind chill effect of 45 degrees below zero.
``That is expected to last until at least tomorrow,'' Hopkins said.
   Tanana Commercial Co. co-owner Dale Erickson said the cold has
sparked a run on items such as matches, kerosene and electrical
heating tape to wrap around propane lines. ``It's so cold the
propane won't work.''
   Mayor Curtis Sommer said a few people had been forced out of
their homes because of the cold, but most seemed to be faring well.
   ``The last time it was like this was 15 or so years ago,'' Sommer
said. ``When it gets up to 40 or 50 below it feels like springtime.''
   Upriver in Nenana, the temperature early Monday dipped to 62
degrees below zero and schools there also were closed.
   The temperature in Bethel warmed to 24 degrees below zero, and
Kusko 300 Sled Dog Race officials said that contest would begin at
noon. It had been scheduled to begin last Thursday, but was delayed
by the cold.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher unveiled a bust of
assassinated Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi on Monday and vowed
to keep helping India fight terrorists.
   In a ceremony honoring Mrs. Gandhi, Mrs. Thatcher said, ``I think
we both understood what to some people is a paradox: that one can be
warm, human, loving, knowing all the little things of life _ and at
the same time firm, determined, decisive.''
   The ceremony at the Indian High Commission in London came on
Indian Martyr's Day, the anniversary of the murder of independence
leader Mohandas K. Gandhi in 1948.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Mrs. Gandhi, whose father Jawaharlal Nehru was
also a prime minister, both were students and honorary fellows of
Oxford University's Somerville College.
   Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh militants in 1984. Mrs.
Thatcher called her death ``another occasion when terrorism deprived
us of a greatly loved and respected figure.''
   Britain has suffered repeated terrorist attacks mounted by the
Irish Republican Army.
   Mrs. Thatcher pledged to continue helping India, now led by Mrs.
Gandhi's son Rajiv, in fighting extremists.
   ``The close cooperation that we have built up between the Indian
and British governments in the fight against terrorism is a very
significant development. I am determined to see it grow closer
still,'' the prime minister said.

<HEAD>Classes Resume At Academy Where Overworked Cadet Was Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGAWAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Classes resumed Monday at the police academy
where one cadet died and 16 others fell ill following a boot
camp-style workout of pushups and laps last fall.
   The 37 recruits of Class 13 were given haircuts and a lecture on
nutrition Monday, a far cry from the strenuous regimen their
predecessors underwent their first day, according to the new head of
the state Criminal Justice Training Council, which oversees the
training of municipal police officers.
   ``What happened here at Agawam was an extreme and not at all
representative of what the training council intended to go on,''
Patrick M. Hamilton said.
   Class 13 is the first at the academy since the training session
that left 16 cadets hospitalized in September from exhaustion and
dehydration. Cadet Timothy Shepard of Pittsfield collapsed the first
day of class, Sept. 19, and died Nov. 2 from his injuries.
   The other cadets were released and allowed back to class for the
remainder of the 14-week course, but several were barred from
physical training because of the injuries.
   Attorney General James Shannon, who investigated the training,
said he found a ``massive failure'' of the bureaucracy overseeing
it. A legislative investigation into police training is under way,
as is a grand jury investigation into the training council's
financial dealings.
   An inquest into Shepard's death is expected to conclude this week
and District Judge Irving Goldblatt said he plans to issue a report
in a few weeks on whether criminal charges should be brought against
the state troopers who were in charge of training the class of 50
cadets.
   The tragedy, however, has already changed the way municipal
police are trained in Massachusetts.
   The latest class of recruits from 19 police departments in
western Massachusetts opened with four hours of inspections,
instructions on rules and regulations, haircuts and marching drills,
according to David Dacyczyn, who took over as academy director in
the shakeup following the injuries to the cadets.
   On Tuesday, the cadets begin physical training at the Springfield
YMCA, where they will undergo an hour of swimming, aerobic workouts
and other physical training daily, Dacyczyn said.
   Gone are the confusing orders shouted at cadets and hundreds of
pushups meted out as punishment. ``They will be treated as adults
and physical education will not be used as a disciplinary tool,''
Hamilton said.

<HEAD>US Invites Iran To Open Dialogue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department reaffirmed Monday its
willingness to open a dialogue with Iran and took issue with an
Iranian official's contention that Washington is to blame for the
continuing impasse in relations.
   Restating what had been the Reagan administration position,
department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States is
prepared to open an ``authoritative dialogue'' with Iranian
officials on a formal end to Iran's war with Iraq, an end of Iranian
support for terrorism and freedom for American hostages held by
pro-Iranian forces in Lebanon.
   The administration believes that Iran may have some influence
over the groups holding the hostages.
   The advent of the Bush administration in Washington has
heightened speculation about the possibility of an easing of
tensions between the two countries and an Iranian effort to help
secure the release of the nine hostages.
   In his inaugural address, President Bush appealed to Iran for
help in freeing the hostages and promised a reciprocal gesture of
good will if Iran was receptive to the idea.
   Since then, however, the two sides have disagreed on which one
should take the first step.
   Redman's comments Monday were touched off by remarks by Iran's
deputy foreign minister for European and American affairs, Mohammad
Javad Larijani, who called on the United States to show good will by
making some unilateral gestures.
   Specifically, Larijani said the United States should pay at least
token compensation to families of the 290 people, mostly Iranians,
who died when a U.S. Navy vessel shot down an Iranian airliner last
July over the Persian Gulf.
   Redman said that the United States remains committed to
compensation but that Iran has not responded to U.S. requests for
information about the families. He said information is needed to
help U.S. officials decide on compensation levels and methods of
distributing the funds.
   Larijani also said the United States could show good will by
releasing ``undisputed'' funds tied up in litigation in the
U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal at the Hague. Redman denied that there are
any undisputed funds being discussed in that forum.
   As an example, Redman cited a tribunal decision concerning
military property owned by Iran but held by the United States. He
noted that the tribunal decided that the United States was not
obligated to return the property but to pay its value as of March
1981.
   ``We are currently trying to determine the value for the
thousands of items involved. Iran and the United States will each be
filing its position on value to the tribunal in due course. It's a
complicated matter and it's not undisputed,'' he said.
   The tribunal was set up in 1981 as part of the settlement that
led to the release of the 52 American hostages in Iran. It is
designed to resolve financial and property claims the two countries
have against each other.

<TEXT>
   Britain's defense secretary said Monday it will
withdraw all or most of an infantry battalion stationed in
Gibraltar, nearly halving the colony's garrison.
   Reducing the garrison likely will raise fears among the 30,000
residents that Britain may give up the disputed colony, over which
Spain claims sovereignty.
   ``As part of the continuing drive for cost effectiveness, we are
considering restructuring and rationalizing our forces in Gibraltar
and their supporting infrastructure,'' Defense Secretary George
Younger said in a written statement in the House of Commons.
   ``Subject to the outcome of detailed studies, we plan to withdraw
in due course all or the major part of the infantry battalion
stationed there,'' he said.
   Younger's brief statement did not say when the battalion will be
withdrawn from the colony at the southern tip of Spain.
   The announcement came as British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe began a 24-hour visit to the colony, a giant rock which Britain
used until recently as a military fortress at the strategic Strait
of Gibraltar guarding the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea.
   Now it is used for troop training and munition stores.
   British officials say the garrison is an unnecessary defense
against Spain, a fellow member of the 16-nation NATO alliance.
   The Gibraltar garrison consists of 781 soldiers and support
troops, 529 naval personnel and 387 air force members.
   It generates about $72 million a year for the local economy _
about half the Gibraltar administration's annual budget.
   Spain's leading daily, El Pais, said Monday that Gibraltar Chief
Minister Joe Bossano may press Howe for compensation for the loss of
1,700 jobs held by Gibraltarians who work for the British Defense
Ministry.
   During his visit, Howe was expected to urge Bossano to approve an
agreement giving Spain access to Gibraltar airport, located on land
between the 2.25 square mile rock and the Spanish mainland. Bossano
opposes the agreement.
   Earlier, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez
said a British troop reduction in Gibraltar would be significant,
but ``really doesn't affect the status of Gibraltar as a British
colony.''
   Since Britain and Spain signed an agreement in 1984 to discuss
the colony's future and sovereignty, officials have met periodically
in London and Madrid.
   Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in 1713 at the end of the War of
Spanish Succession.

   Observers in Congress, universities and public
interest groups questioned the fairness and wisdom Monday of giving
big pay raises to dozens of senior federal judges who, like former
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, do no legal work.
   All 306 senior federal judges _ even those who no longer wield a
gavel _ will see their salaries rise by about 50 percent unless
Congress disapproves raises due for top federal officials Feb. 8.
   Burger's salary, for example, will increase by $60,000 to
$175,000 a year.
   ``We need to look into this much further,'' said Rep. Carlos
Moorhead, who last year sidetracked an effort to lower the
eligibility age for senior status.
   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' said the California Republican, who
sits on the House courts subcommittee and is a member of a national
commission studying the future of the federal judiciary.
   Moorhead said the commission might look at the issue, and
Congress may want to study ``establishing some minimum work to
qualify for the raises.''
   David Keating of the 150,000-member National Taxpayers Union, a
public interest group that promotes tax and spending reduction,
decried giving more money to all senior judges.
   ``It's appalling that they're getting huge salaries for doing
nothing and now are receiving substantial pay raises for continuing
to do nothing,'' Keating said. ``There ought to be some minimum
standard of work to qualify for any pay raise.''
   Older federal judges who opt for senior status qualify for
active-duty pay raises even after stepping down from full-time duty.
When he retired as chief justice in 1986, Burger's salary was
$108,400. He chose senior status, and in 1987 his judicial salary
rose to $115,000 when his successor's pay rose to that level.
   Burger, who is working full-time as the unpaid chairman of the
anniversary celebration of the Constitution, declined to discuss his
pay increase other than to say, ``I'm too busy to sit.''
   Judges who retire through resignation _ the other option provided
by Congress _ keep for life the same salary they received on their
last day of work.
   Senior status is available to any judge who is at least 65 with
15 years experience, or 70 with 10 years.
   Administrative records obtained by The Associated Press indicate
that roughly one in five of the nation's senior judges do no
judicial work whatsoever. Only 13 former judges have passed up
senior status to choose full retirement.
   The law allows senior judges to turn down any work they don't
want.
   Robert Raven, a San Francisco lawyer and president of the
American Bar Association, emphasized that senior judges ``as a whole
do so much for the federal judiciary'' but said a senior judge
receiving pay raises for no work ``is a little disturbing in any one
instance.''
   Lloyd Cutler, a prominent Washington attorney who chaired the
commission that recommended the pay raises, said this pay system was
intended by Congress and will have little impact on the giant
federal deficit.
   But Cutler added, ``You may have a point that if they don't work
they shouldn't receive more than retired judges. I hadn't thought
about that before.''
   Monroe Freedman, a legal ethics professor at Hofstra University,
said, ``It doesn't look good when judges appear to be taking
advantage of the law. But it may well be too much to ask of people
who consider themselves having been underpaid for so long to pass up
(senior status).''
   Another legal ethics professor, Stephen Gillers of New York
University, said he saw no ethical problem for the non-working
senior judges but ``it may be the statute should be changed. It may
be unwise or bad management. It's a question whether the public is
getting its money's worth.''
   Congress created the senior judge category in 1919 to open jobs
for younger appointees by luring older judges out of the lifetime
appointments the Constitution grants them.
   Congress counted on the senior judges to help with rising
workloads, and in large measure they have.
   As a group, senior judges handle between 10 and 15 percent of all
federal cases. ``The federal judiciary would be a mess without
(their) help,'' said Frank Coffin, an appeals court judge from
Portland, Maine.
   For those senior judges who do not work, reasons can differ
dramatically.
   James Noel Jr., a senior judge in Houston, performed his last
judicial duty in 1978 when his annual salary was $54,500 _ $80,500 a
year less than he stands to begin receiving next month.
   Noel, 79, took senior status in 1976 when he was 66, after 15
years as a federal trial judge. Asked why he chose senior status and
not resignation, Noel said: ``It was just a matter of choice.''
   Noel regularly uses his downtown office to manage his ``extensive
investments.'' Asked about his impending pay raise, Noel told AP,
``I was expecting it.''
   Owen Cox, a federal trial judge in Texas since 1970, took senior
status in 1981 and did substantial judicial work until his health
failed.
   ``He's been hospitalized for three years. He's on a life-support
system,'' court clerk Jesse Clark said.
   Cox's salary would rise to $135,000 next month. Had he resigned
his salary would have been frozen at $67,100.

<HEAD>Bush Sees ``Jobs in Abundance'' in Years Ahead</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday said there would be
``jobs in abundance'' in the years ahead and called for a new
national spirit of volunteerism.
   Speaking at a ceremonial swearing-in for Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, Bush said he wanted his administration ``to be about
working people.''
   ``Part of it will be a new volunteerism, people helping people,''
Bush said, adding:
   ``John Kennedy challenged us to ask ourselves what we could do
for our country. And let us each day ask, what can I do for another
person? How can I make someone else's load a little lighter?''
   Bush said government service ``plays a vital role, but it must
complement individual service.''
   ``I think of the secretary who after a day at the office takes
the time to volunteer and help a child in the neighborhood learn how
to read,'' he said at the Department of Labor ceremony attended by
several hundred agency employees.
   ``I know a great many of you, on your own time, do work for
churches and in your communities and for charities. And I want to
thank you and I want to encourage everybody to be involved in this
kind of work,'' he said.
   With her husband, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., at her
side, Mrs. Dole picked up on Bush's theme of volunteerism and budget
restraint.
   ``We don't have unlimited funds, which means we must make the
funds we do have work for us,'' said Mrs. Dole, who was
transportation secretary in the Reagan administration.
   She said she was committed to a goal of ``advancing from the
promise of full employment to the promise of fulfilling employment.''
   It was Bush's first public appearance as he began the second week
of his presidency; and it was clear he still had the cold that
plagued him since the middle of last week.
   ``Pardon my voice,'' a hoarse Bush told his audience. White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was feeling better after
a day of rest on Sunday but was still taking decongestant.
   Bush said there was ``a lot to feel good about on the labor
front'' with civilian unemployment currently at its lowest level in
14 years, 5.3 percent in December.
   ``There'll be jobs in abundance but we'll have to make sure our
workers have the skills that they need to fill those jobs with
excellence,'' Bush added.
   Bush also stressed the theme of volunteerism in a meeting with
officials from the new White House office of national service,
headed by Gregg Petersmeyer. ``The concept of one American helping
another is a valid concept,'' Bush said.
   He said his administration would be ``sensitized to how we all
feel about this. I'm convinced we can do great things.''

<UNK>Broadway Director Morton Da Costa Dies at 74</UNK>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morton Da Costa, who directed some of
Broadway's biggest hits in the 1950s including ``The Music Man,''
``Auntie Mame,'' ``No Time for Sergeants'' and ``Plain and Fancy,''
has died of a heart attack. He was 74.
   Da Costa, who lived in West Redding, died Sunday in Danbury
Hospital.
   Although known primarily as a director, Da Costa began his
Broadway career as an actor. He had a small role in the original
1942 production of Thornton Wilder's ``The Skin of Our Teeth'' and
understudied Montgomery Clift in the comedy.
   Da Costa played Osric in Maurice Evans' 1945 production of
``Hamlet'' and later, with Evans' encouragement, turned to
directing. At the New York City Center, he directed revivals of such
plays as ``The Alchemist,'' starring Jose Ferrer, ``She Stoops to
Conquer'' with Brian Aherne and Celeste Holm and ``Dream Girl'' with
Judy Holliday.
   After directing the national tour of the comedy hit ``Sabrina
Fair'' in the early 1950s, Da Costa had four big successes in a row
on Broadway, starting with ``Plain and Fancy.'' The musical, set in
Pennsylvania Amish country, ran more than a year and had a London
production, which Da Costa also supervised.
   In 1955, Da Costa directed ``No Time for Sergeants,'' Ira Levin's
comedy about Army life that made a star of Andy Griffith. In 1956,
he had another hit with ``Auntie Mame,'' an adaptation of the
Patrick Dennis novel about a madcap aunt and her young ward.
Rosalind Russell played the title role.
   The following year, Da Costa had his biggest Broadway success
with ``The Music Man,'' which starred Robert Preston as the
irrepressible con man. It ran for more than four years and won a
Tony award as best musical.
   Among Da Costa's other musicals were ``Saratoga,'' an adaptation
of Edna Ferber's ``Saratoga Trunk,'' starring Howard Keel and Carol
Lawrence in 1959; ``To Broadway With Love,'' a lavish revue shown at
the 1964 New York World's Fair, and ``Maggie Flynn,'' starring
Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy in 1968.
   In recent years, Da Costa directed an all-star revival of Clare
Booth Luce's ``The Women'' with Alexis Smith, Myrna Loy, Rhonda
Fleming, Dorothy Loudon, Kim Hunter and Jan Miner. His last Broadway
show was the 1985 comedy ``Doubles,'' which starred John Cullum, Ron
Leibman, Austin Pendleton and Tony Roberts.
   He also directed the film versions of ``Auntie Mame'' and ``The
Music Man.''
   Da Costa is survived by two sisters, Lillian Nath, of Englewood,
N.J., and Marian Gordy of Atlantic City, N.J. A memorial service
will be announced.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marine guards lowered the flag for the
last time Monday and the U.S. Embassy staff prepared to depart
before the Red Army leaves Kabul's fate to Afghan soldiers and
Moslem guerrillas who wait in the hills.
   ``As we say goodbye, we say, `God bless the United States,'''
said Charge d'Affaires Jon D. Glassman, the ranking American
diplomat still in Kabul, at the solemn ceremony.
   ``Today we leave at a moment that is both happy and sad, pleased
that the people of Afghanistan are going to be relieved of their
suffering, but we know their struggle is not over.
   ``The people of the United States are with them,'' Glassman said,
raising the folded flag above his head in a salute. ``We will be
back when the conflict is over.''
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan's civil war nine years ago
and are to be gone by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
Moslem insurgents, who get most of their support from the United
States and Pakistan, were not parties to the agreement and predict
victory soon after the Red Army is gone.
   Efforts for a political settlement continued. President Najib
wrote an open letter published by the English-language Kabul Times
that urged the insurgents to negotiate. The guerrillas rejected the
offer, the paper said, as they have previous government and Soviet
proposals.
   Yuri Maslyukov, Soviet deputy premier, arrived to meet with Najib
just after Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov ended a three-day
visit to Kabul. A Western diplomat in Islamabad, Pakistan, said the
visits were meant to ``boost the sagging morale of the communist
government.''
   Embassy officials would not say when the American staff of two
diplomats, four Marine guards and five others would leave on a
chartered flight to New Delhi, India. The Kabul airport was closed
Monday by a three-inch snowfall.
   The State Department said last week the embassy would be closed
because of fears that Afghanistan's conscript army could not protect
foreign diplomats after the Soviets leave.
   The building is in the heart of Kabul near the presidential
palace, the state radio and secret police headquarters, all of which
would be prime guerrilla targets in a battle for the city.
   The departure of the embassy staff will leave 10 Americans in
Afghanistan, all missionaries.
   West Germany was the first country to withdraw its diplomats.
After the U.S. closure was announced, Britain, France, Japan and
Austria followed suit.
   Britain held its farewell ceremony Monday and the other three are
expected to close their missions this week, along with Italy.
   The Soviet Embassy has said it will continue operating after the
military withdrawal, but with a greatly reduced staff. Some of the
Kremlin's East European allies have indicated they may leave.
   India is evacuating relatives of embassy staff but says it won't
close its mission.
   In Washington, Rep. Stephen Solarz, chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, said the decision to
close the U.S. Embassy was ``entirely justifiable'' because of the
potential danger.
   ``In the long run, U.S. influence in Afghanistan is likely to be
limited, but I do believe the support we provided to the freedom
fighters (guerrillas) will surely be remembered by the people of
that country,'' the New York Democrat said.
   Najib's government accused the United States of closing the
embassy as a means of inciting the guerrillas to more intense
warfare after the Red Army departs.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978. Soviet soldiers arrived in December 1979 and totaled an
estimated 115,000 when the withdrawal began May 15. Half were gone
by Aug. 15.
   Although the rest have until Feb. 15 to leave, the final Soviet
convoy is expected to head north later this week on the Salang
Highway, the 250-mile route through the rugged Hindu Kush mountain
range to the Soviet burder.
   Guerrillas control the countryside and are camped in the hills
around Kabul. They have attacked food and fuel convoys trying to
reach the city on the Salang, and periodically fire rockets into the
capital.
   Kabul has suffered severe shortages. Long lines form at bread
stores and gasoline stations. People in ragged shawls and sandals
wait for hours in the snow and bitter cold.
   An emergency Soviet airlift was started Jan. 21 to bring in flour
and fuel.
   Moscow also has said it will give the Afghan army military aid
after the withdrawal because of continuing U.S. And Pakistani
asistance to the rebels.
   Four Soviet tanks rumbled past only momemts before the closing
ceremony was conducted in the U.S. Embassy compound, behind walls
seven feet high and toped with coils of barbed wire.
   Marine guards brought down the Stars and Stripes, gently folded
the flag and handed it to Glassman, who walked to a small slab of
marble on the other side of the compound that honors Adolph Dubs,
the former U.S. ambassador.
   Dubs was kidnapped, then killed along with his abductors when
soldiers tried to rescue him Feb. 14, 1979. U.S. officials still do
not know the motive.
   ``His mortal remains lie in Arlington National Cemetery, but his
spirit is here with us in Kabul,'' Glassman said.

<HEAD>Reagan ``Subject to Call'' in North Trial, Which Begins Tuesday</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Reworks top 12 grafs to emphasize trial beginning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial will begin
Tuesday with President Bush free of a subpoena seeking his testimony
but with former President Reagan still ``subject to call,'' the
judge in the case said Monday.
   Portions of Reagan's diary also might be required as evidence,
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell ruled. However, he rejected
North's subpoena seeking Bush's testimony in the trial in which
North faces 12 criminal charges.
   When North, who was indicted last March, walks into the U.S.
courthouse near the foot of Capitol Hill, he will become the first
figure in the Iran-Contra affair to stand trial.
   Many of the same witnesses who testified in the nationally
televised congressional hearings two years ago are expected to be
called by the prosecutors, including former Attorney General Edwin
Meese III and North's secretary, Fawn Hall.
   At North's side will be Brendan Sullivan, an aggressive
Washington lawyer who also represented North before the
congressional panels investigating the Iran-Contra affair.
   At a hearing Friday, the government had sought to quash North's
subpoenas seeking testimony from both Reagan and Bush as well as
records from Reagan.
   Gesell said North's lawyers have ``made no showing that President
Bush has any specific information relevant and material to the
charges of the indictment which makes it necessary or appropriate to
require his appearance.''
   But ``President Reagan shall remain subject to call on the ...
subpoena'' served on him by North in December, Gesell said in a
three-page order.
   The judge said Reagan wouldn't be called as a witness ``unless
and until'' the court issues another order after giving the Justice
Department and Reagan's lawyers an opportunity to list their
objections at a hearing.
   Gesell quashed North's subpoena for Reagan's diary, except for
what he described as a ``narrow exception.''
   The judge said the diary subpoena would be ``subject to renewal''
if North's lawyers support a claim that ``President Reagan ordered,
directed, requested or, with advance knowledge, condoned any of
North's alleged false statements, document-removal or destruction''
or other alleged crimes in the affair.
   In congressional testimony in 1987, North said he had
authorization from higher-ups in the administration for all of his
actions.
   Gesell said Monday that if North can support a claim of
presidential authorization for his actions, ``consideration must
then be given to develop an appropriate production procedure for
determining whether or not any aspect of such a claim finds support
in the diary and to the need to seek supplementing testimony from
President Reagan'' through written questions and answers or other
means.
   Unless North can do better than his broad request for information
from the diary, Gesell said, ``President Reagan's knowledge, would,
generally speaking, be irrelevant and immaterial in the light of the
limited precise counts that still remain in the case.''
   Gesell said Reagan has cooperated with independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh and ``been responsive to requests for documents. He
remains willing to assist.''
   Lawyers from Walsh's office were permitted to review typewritten
excerpts from Reagan's diary a year ago, it was disclosed at a
hearing Friday.
   North is accused of concealing from Congress in 1985 and 1986 his
efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of falsely telling
then-Attorney General Meese that the National Security Council had
no role in diverting money from the Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   The former Marine and White House aide also is accused of
illegally accepting a $13,800 security system at his home from
co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to his own use at least
$4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader Adolfo Calero and
conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue in connection with
charitable contributions supporting the Contras.
   Gesell on Jan. 13 dismissed the two central charges against
North, conspiracy and theft counts accusing him of illegally
diverting more than $14 million in U.S. Iran arms sale proceeds to
the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Those charges were dismissed after a panel of intelligence
experts in the Reagan administration, citing national security
concerns, refused to declassify many portions of classified
documents that were deemed necessary for the prosecution or defense.
   North was indicted last March along with former National Security
Adviser John Poindexter and arms suppliers Secord and Albert Hakim.
In June, Gesell ordered separate trials for them.

<HEAD>Mulroney Announces Cabinet for Second Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Monday he will
keep his external affairs and international trade ministers for his
second term, which he won in a campaign waged over a historic trade
pact with the United States.
   In announcing his new Cabinet, however, the Progressive
Conservative leader said he would change his defense minister.
   The new 39-member Cabinet retains Joe Clark as external affairs
minister, John Crosbie as international trade minister, and Michael
Wilson as finance minister.
   Defense Minister Perrin Beatty was moved to health, and Bill
McKnight was moved from Indian affairs to defense.
   Reporters asked Mulroney if the shift of defense ministers meant
an upcoming change for the major pending defense program, the plan
to acquire nuclear-powered submarines for Arctic patrol.
   ``The government is committed to the policy ... but that, like
everything else, will be reviewed no doubt by the new Cabinet,'' the
prime minister said.
   Mulroney's party won a second consecutive majority government
Nov. 21 after a campaign bitterly fought over the free-trade
agreement that Mulroney signed in January 1988 with former President
Reagan. Parliament returned in December to complete legislation for
the agreement, which took effect Jan. 1.
   The new Cabinet includes six new ministers, mostly to replace
Conservatives who lost in last fall's elections.

   In true ``Miami Vice'' fashion, actor Don
Johnson nabbed an intruder in a hotel room as the man rifled through
the purse of his fiancee, actress Melanie Griffith, police said
Monday.
   Johnson, 39, who portrays a hard-nosed but flashily dressed
undercover cop on the TV series, discovered the intruder when he and
Miss Griffith opened the door to their room at the Hotel Bel-Air on
Sunday night, said police Capt. Clayton Mayes.
   The purse contained expensive jewelry, but the couple surprised
the man before anything was taken, he said.
   ``Don Johnson took the suspect into custody and held him until
hotel security officers could detain him until police arrived,''
Mayes said.
   ``He moved real fast,'' added Detective Doug Sims.
   Arrested and booked for investigation of attempted burglary was
David Johnson, 34, no relation to the actor, Mayes said.
   Miss Griffith, 31, received a Golden Globe award Saturday night
for best comic actress for her performance in the film ``Working
Girl.'' She and Johnson were married previously and have decided to
remarry.

<HEAD>Group Says One-Fifth Of Gas Stations Likely To Close</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly one-fifth of the nation's gas stations
may be forced out of business as a result of new environmental
safety rules, an industry group said Monday.
   The Petroleum Marketers Association of America said the closures
probably would not put a squeeze on gas supplies but would _
particularly in rural areas _ force up prices and make motorists
drive farther to fill up and get car repairs.
   The group, representing fuel wholesalers who also own gas
stations, said a survey of its membership indicated that at least
26,250 outlets are being closed or will be closed as a direct result
of the Environmental Protection Agency rules. It said more than half
of those are in populations centers of 10,000 and less.
   There are about 150,000 retail gasoline outlets in the United
States, the group said.
   The regulations at issue require owners of underground petroleum
storage tanks, such as those at retail gas outlets, to prove,
through pollution liability insurance or other means, that they can
pay damages in the event their tanks leak.
   The EPA rules also set stricter technical standards for new and
existing storage tanks, but it is the financial responsiblity rules
that the marketers group says will force stations to close. It said
the biggest problem for the station owners is that pollution
liability insurance either is too expensive or is not available.
   ``The problem can be summed up in one word: insurance, or, more
specifically, the lack of it,'' said Phillip R. Chisholm, the
group's executive vice president.
   An EPA official, responding to the marketers' complaint, said the
agency agreed that the tank owners face a problem but that adequate
solutions could be found.
   Ron Brand, director of the agency's underground storage tank
program, said insurance was likely to become more available and
affordable as an increasing number of state governments set up trust
funds to help pay for pollution cleanup. He said 25 states already
have set up such funds or are arranging to do so.
   Brand said there was no reliable estimate of the extent of
environmental harm caused by leaks in the 2 million underground oil
and gasoline storage tanks nationwide.
   The petroleum marketers group said it projected at least 26,250
gas station closings on the basis of survey responses last November
from 2,128 members in 35 states. It called the projection
conservative and said the figure could go as high as 35,000.
   Those totals are only for independent marketers, which are
defined as wholesalers who distribute gasoline and other petroleum
products to retail outlets, often including stations they own
outright. They own about one-third of all gas stations.
   The survey results did not include possible closings by retail
gas dealers who buy directly from oil refiners, nor those of
stations owned by refiners. Chisholm said some of these stations
might also be closed as a result of the EPA regulations.

<HEAD>Pro-Solidarity Priest Found Dead After Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-Solidarity priest was found dead
Monday morning after fire swept through his home in the northeastern
city of Bialystok, said church officials and the state-run news
agency PAP.
   The Rev. Stanislaw Suchowolec, 31, of the Immaculate Heart of
Mary parish in Bialystok apparently died of smoke inhalation,
according to results of an investigation by the local prosecutor and
church officials, PAP said.
   Investigators had not determined the cause of the fire.
   The Rev. Maciej Pawlik, parish provost, said a neighoring priest
found Suchowolec's body.
   Suchowolec, an active supporter of the banned independent union
movement Solidarity, had reported harassment in the past, union
officials said.
   He was the second priest to die of unnatural causes in the past
10 days.
   On Jan. 21, a church lay worker found the body of the Rev. Stefan
Niedzielak, 74, who maintained a shrine to Poles killed in the
Soviet Union.
   The Warsaw prosecutor said Niedzielak died of a broken neck, but
the circumstances of his death have not been disclosed.
   The priest who found Suchowolec's body said he believed an
electric spark started the fire.
   ``The curtains and coverings were all burned, so it seems he must
have inhaled carbon monoxide,'' the priest said on condition of
anonymity.
   In his early years as a priest, Suchowolec served as vicar in
Sucho Wola, the home village of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the
pro-Solidarity priest who was murdered by security police in 1984.
   Suchowolec organized pilgrimages to Popieluszko's gravesite in
Warsaw, about 119 miles southwest of Bialystok.
   ``He was a wonderful Solidarity priest,'' said Zofia Romaszewka
of the Solidarity Commission on Intervention and Law-Abidance, which
keeps a record of human rights violations in Poland.
   Romaszewska said Suchowolec told the commission in the past that
his car had been tampered with and that he had been assaulted.
   According to Zdzislaw Krol, chancellor of the Warsaw curia,
Niedzielak had received anonymous threats before his death.
   More than 5,000 people attended Niedzielak's funeral in Warsaw.

   Two officials of private U.S. relief groups
will visit southern Sudan this week to advance plans for providing

   That official and a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi
declined to identify the officials or their organizations. However,
the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
the supplies would come from the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
   Richard Mula, secretary general of the rebels' Sudan Relief and
Rehabilitation Association, told The Associated Press the officials
plan to visit the rebel-held southeastern towns of Kapoeta, Ikoto,
Pachala and Pibor.
   ``They want to go and make initial assessment of the needs of the
people,'' Mula said, adding that they plan to leave Wednesday and
are awaiting clearance from the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   The army is the military wing of Sudan People's Liberation
Movement. The rebels have been fighting the government since 1983,
and U.N. officials say the war has caused a famine that killed more
than 5,000 people last year.
   Officials in Washington said last week they were exploring ways
of providing emergency relief to rebel-held parts of southern Sudan.
U.S. officials say they are providing relief to government-held
southern towns.
   Mula said supplies for rebel areas would be distributed by
private groups, ``but if they can't, our field staff will do so.''
   He said about 2 million people in rebel-held areas need at least
20,000 tons of food, as well as clothing and medicine.
   The rebels say they control about 90 percent of the largely
Christian or animist South. They are demanding reforms from the
Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum.
   During the fighting, a third of southern Sudan's 6 million
civilians have fled to the north or to neighboring countries.

   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said Monday that a warning about the Soviet Union by
defense-secretary designate John Tower did not reflect the
conclusions of a U.S. review of policies toward the Kremlin.
   Fitzwater said Tower ``was, of course, speaking for the
administration in the sense that he was our nominee for the
secretary of defense. ... They (the remarks) don't reflect the
conclusions of a government-wide review but they certainly reflect
his views, and as secretary of defense he'll have a very strong role
in the positions that are taken and in the reviews that take place.''
   Tower, at a NATO conference in Munich, said Sunday that Moscow
remains a powerful adversary. He urged NATO officials to remain
skeptical of Moscow's disarmament overtures and to keep the West's
nuclear options open.

<HEAD>Right-Wing Whites Threaten Indian Family That Moved Into Their Neighborhood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Monday told people to
avoid vigilante tactics after whites brandished a noose and sprayed
racist slogans on the walls of a house that an Indian family bought
in their neighborhood.
   The neighborhood, Mayfair, is classified as whites-only, although
many people of Indian descent have moved there in recent years in
violation of the Group Areas Act.
   Police officers came to the area Sunday when several dozen
right-wing whites staged a protest outside a house bought by an
Indian electrical engineer. A noose was draped over a wall near the
house, windows had been broken, and racist slogans had been painted
on the building.
   Police headquarters said charges of malicious damage to property
were being investigated and that anyone with a grievance should file
a complaint with police rather than take the law into their own
hands.
   The South African Press Agency reported Sunday that the Indian
owner, who has a wife and two children, recounted the incident in a
telephone interview on condition he not be identified.
   ``I told them (the white protesters) that I was a non-violent
person who did not want any trouble,'' the man was quoted as saying.
``They continued to use the foulest of language.''
   Residents of the neighborhood told SAPA that furniture was moved
into the house on Sunday morning and was removed several hours later.
   Among those joining the protest was Hendrick Claasan, who who
represents the neighborhood on behalf of the extreme-right
Conservative Party on the Johannesburg City Council.
   He told police that residents were entitled to enforce provisions
of the Group Areas Act, which mandates racial segregation of
residential areas.
   Newspapers reported that several of the whites at the protest
threatened violence if the Indian family moved in.

<TEXT>
   No help from abroad is needed for last week's
earthquake in Tadzhikistan, an official said Monday. The Soviet
Union accepted at least $100 million worth of aid after the
disastrous Armenian quake in December.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said the temblor
Jan. 23 in a rural area of the Central Asian republic had ``limited
consequences.'' It caused a landslide that buried three mountain
villages and killed 274 people.
   Nearly 100 times as many people were killed by the Dec. 7 quake
in Armenia, after which aid arrived from more than 70 countries. It
was the first time World War II the Soviets accepted help from
abroad because of a disaster.
   Gerasimov said offers of aid came after the Tadzhikistan quake
from the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, Italy and many
other countries.
   ``We appreciate this and we are thankful to the countries,
organizations and individuals who have offered their help, but the
nature and the consequences of the earthquake in Tadzhikistan are
limited,'' he told a news conference.
   ``The number of people who need medical aid is not that large, so
there is no special need for equipment or the presence of foreign
experts or specialists in the area,'' he said. Officials said 75
victims of the Tadzhik quake had been hospitalized.
   Sharora village, 18 miles southwest of Dushanbe, capital of the
republic, was dedicated as a common grave for the victims, many of
whom were buried alive by a wall of mud.
   Officials said destroyed villages would be rebuilt elsewhere.
Tass, the official news agency, said homeless people were being
housed in mobile units, shepherds' cottages and tents.

<HEAD>Quayle Says God-Hating Communist System Brought Evil into World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle told religious
broadcasters Monday that the Soviet government system, rooted in
``hatred of God,'' has brought much evil into the world.
   He quoted Communist revolution leader Vladimir Lenin as saying
the idea of god is ``unutterable vileness ... of the most dangerous
kind.''
   ``That was Lenin and unfortunately his gospel is still actively
pursued in the Soviet Union,'' Quayle said.
   He also said that if Moscow's planned international human rights
conference occurs, the United States must ensure that it ``is not
just a public relations extravaganza for the Soviet leadership.''
   ``We must insist that all the agreed-upon conditions for such a
conference are met _ conditions such as free contact of Soviet
citizens with delegates and visitors _ and that all scheduled
meetings take place in conditions of unimpeded access and openness.''
   Quayle made his comments in a speech to the annual conference of
the National Religious Broadcasters.
   President Bush has said he would follow through on former
President Reagan's agreement for U.S. participation in the
conference, but also has said that Soviet human rights performance
will be monitored in the meantime.
   Quayle quoted Bush's campaign comment that the Iron Curtain
separating the East and West still exists, but that it is beginning
to rust.
   Then the vice president went on to attack the Soviet system,
saying that Soviet citizens are now speaking out against the
concentration of power by the Communist Party.
   ``How did the Communist Party gain such appalling confidence in
its own wisdom, indeed, its own omniscience. I think the root of the
matter all comes back to a hatred of God, to a rejection of the
entire concept of a religious system,'' Quayle said.
   He contrasted the Soviet and American revolutions, saying that
founders of the United States had a ``belief in the existence of a
creator whose laws have placed irrevocable limits on the power of
the state.''
   ``Look how much good has come into the world as a result of the
first revolution and how much evil has entered the world because of
the second,'' Quayle said.
   His comments, in language and tone, differed from those Bush has
made recently about the Soviets. However, Bush has urged a cautious
approach to U.S.-Soviet relations, which seemed to be rapidly
improving as Reagan's term came to an end.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Quayle's
comments were not inconsistent with administration policy.
   Quayle also mentioned his upcoming three-day trip to Venezuela
and El Salvador.
   ``My message will be democracy, democracy and more democracy,''
he said.
   He will attend Thursday's inauguration of Venezuela's new
president, Carlos Andres Perez, where he will be in the company of
some two-dozen heads of state and will confer with some.
   The El Salvador stop on the way back Friday will be focused on
emphasizing human rights, officials said. Elections are scheduled in
that nation in just over a month.

   Cutting back on fertilizer and killer chemicals
to take care of bugs and weeds isn't a step backward at all, and may
be the start of a long future journey for American farmers, an
Agriculture Department conference was told Monday.
   Will Erwin, an Indiana farmer and member of the federal Farm
Credit Assistance Board, said that so-called low-input, sustainable
agriculture _ called LISA by advocates _ does not mean returning to
the era of horse power and manual labor on the farm.
   ``We cannot look back, we cannot look at it as going back,''
Erwin told the conference.
   But there are some good reasons _ economic and environmental _
why farmers can and should trim back on some of the the items they
use, such as fertilizer and pesticides. And the manner in which
those items are used.
   ``Farmers are only 2 percent of the population,'' Erwin said. ``I
think one of the base problems we have as farmers is that we still
think we are the powerful farm bloc. Subconsiously, we want to
believe that. We don't have that kind of clout anymore.''
   Erwin said farmers also ``are perceived as being carried'' by the
federal government through various programs and subsidies.
   ``There is a growing force in our society that says to farmers
that we paid you not to produce while you used chemicals and
fertilizer to produce more and more _ and we want lower cost
programs and a safer ennvironment,'' he said.
   The concept of low-input, sustainable agriculture has been around
for a long time. It has grown since the energy crunch of the 1970s,
and as environmental issues such as soil and water pollution have
taken a deeper hold.
   Congress in the 1985 farm law authorized USDA to conduct research
and education programs in ``alternative farming systems,'' often
referred to as low-input or sustainable agriculture. In 1987,
Congress appropriated $3.9 million to push the LISA concept.
   The two-day conference at the department attracted about 150
registrants to hear farmers and other talk about their experiences
with low-input production methods. More than 100 of those registered
represented special interest groups, USDA agencies and other federal
offices.
   Vivan Jennings, deputy administrator of the Extension Service,
called LISA ``an issue whose time has come'' but cautioned that no
one should expect miracles.
   ``We should recognize it's not a panacea,'' Jennings said. ``It's
not going to solve all of our problems, and we need to remember that
as we move ahead.''
   Luther Berntson, a North Dakota farmer who uses the low-input
approach for years on his 2,000-acre operation, said that federal
farm programs helped put production agriculture into a rut.
   ``I don't need to remind you that the government farm programs of
the past have not rewarded the best management practices,'' he said.

   A coalition of Michigan advertisers and
newspaper readers said Monday it will ask a federal appeals court to
reconsider a three-judge panel's decision to allow a partial merger
of Detroit's major daily newspapers.
   Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press will ask the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to block the
merger of The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press until all 13
judges can rehear the appeal, said attorneys for the organization.
   The three appeals judges, in an opinion issued Friday, said the
newspapers qualified for a partial exemption from federal antitrust
laws and could implement the proposed joint operating agreement.
   William Schultz, one of the coalition's attorneys, said the
500-member organization would argue that ``this is a case of
exceptional importance'' that deserves a hearing by the full appeals
court. He said the panel's decision puts newspaper competition in 26
other cities in jeopardy.
   If the decision is allowed to stand, any corporation ``with a
deep pocket can go in there and cut prices,'' forcing financial
losses and setting up the conditions necessary to apply for a joint
operating agreement, Schultz said.
   The News, owned by Gannett Co. Inc., and the Free Press, owned by
Knight-Ridder Inc., have said they will merge their business and
production operations beginning Feb. 6. Knight-Ridder had said it
would close the Free Press if the partial merger were disapproved.
Both the News and the Free Press have reported heavy losses over the
past few years.
   There was no immediate comment Monday from Gannett, Knight-Ridder
or The News.
   Free Press Publisher David Lawrence said the papers would go
ahead with the JOA unless another stay is issued by the court.
   ``After almost three years, it's time for our lives to go
ahead,'' he said. ``Every issue has been heard. ... Fair is fair,
and we need to proceed.''
   The agreement, approved last year by the Justice Department but
stalled by the appeal, allows the newspapers to combine advertising,
circulation, production and other business operations to cut costs.
Their news and editorial departments would remain separate as
required by the Newspaper Preservation Act, a law intended to
preserve competing editorial voices when one of the newspapers is in
danger of financial failure.
   The newspapers have announced their intent to raise newsstand
prices should the agreement go into affect and also have said they
expect advertising rates would rise under a partial merger.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Monday called for
international pressure on Iran to halt torture and political
executions, which the human rights group says have totaled more than
1,000 since July.
   The London-based group also expressed concern about Iran's
anti-drug crackdown, in which at least 113 people convicted of
trafficking or possession have been shot or hanged since the first
of the year.
   Amnesty submitted the information in a statement to the U.N.
Human Rights Commission, which began its annual meeting Monday in
Geneva.
   Amnesty International said other human rights violations that
have persisted in Iran include detention without trial and
amputation, usually of the four fingers of the right hand, of which
it said 21 instances ofhad been recorded.
   The organization said the amputations were ``judicial punishment
for repeated theft.''
   The group also said it was concerned about a massive anti-drug
crackdown and said about people were unfairly convicted.
   Tehran radio reported Sunday that 22 more drug smugglers were
hanged publicly in various Iranian cities in the previous three
days, raising the total to 113 in the crackdown launched two weeks
ago.
   ``Amnesty International urges the international community to use
whatever channels are available to persuade the Iranian government
to put an end to the present wave of public executions and to
implement and observe judicial and other procedures to safeguard the
human rights of its citizens,'' the group said in its statement.
   ``Since the end of July 1988, Amnesty International has recorded
over 1,000 names of political prisoners who have reportedly been
executed,'' it said. ``And further reports are still being
received.''
   The group said it expected a prisoner amnesty for the 10th
anniversary of the founding of the Islamic Republic in February but
that any positive impact of such a move would be ``muted because
hundreds, if not thousands of prisoners will be killed before the
amnesty comes into effect.''
   Revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has pardoned
4,500 convicts imprisoned in the northeastern province of Khorasan
and plans to start releasing them Tuesday when celebrations begin,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency has said.
   Amnesty said it appealed to Iran on behalf of hundreds of
prisoners at risk and asked for comment on reported victims, but it
received no responses.
   The wave of executions apparently was sparked by an incursion
into western Iran from Iraq by the National Liberation Army, a group
backed by the opposition group People's Mujahedeen Organization of
Iran, Amnesty said.
   Many victims were from that group and other opposition parties
and groups involved in armed opposition to the government, the
statement said.
   Many were imprisoned for years before they were shot to death or
hanged ``and among them there were a large number of prisoners of
conscience and others serving prison terms imposed after unfair
trials for their non-violent political activity,'' the statement
said.
   It said more people connected with opposition groups were being
reported detained without charge, young people were being singled
out for random searches on the street by Revolutionary Guards and
floggings remain common.

   The chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee
on Monday rejected a private group's request to delay the
confirmation vote on Commerce Secretary-designate Robert Mosbacher
until more is known about his campaign fund-raising for George Bush.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., sent a letter to the group,
Common Cause, saying action on Mosbacher's nomination would not be
postponed because it would be wrong to ``raise sand'' over conduct
that was allowed under federal election law.
   The committee is scheduled to vote Tuesday on Mosbacher's
nomination.
   Common Cause said the vote should be postponed because the
Republican National Committee has yet to release a full and accurate
list of the individuals and corporations that donated at least
$100,000 each to the ``Team 100'' fund-raising drive led by
Mosbacher, who was Bush's chief fund-raiser.
   The Republican National Committee released a list of individuals
who had made contributions, but said much of the money was given on
behalf of corporations which were not identified.
   In a letter to Hollings, Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer
said the information about corporate donors was needed ``to allow
the public to be able to identify any possible connections that
might arise between the soft-money contributions and any direct
interest the contributors may end up having in issues before the
Commerce Department under Mr. Mosbacher's leadership.''
   Hollings said that while he would not postpone action on the
nomination, he planned to introduce legislation to limit spending in
federal elections.
   ``The fault here lies with the Congress and not with Mr.
Mosbacher,'' he said.

   The Navy on Monday began the administrative
process required to fire a Marine Corps purchasing official who
pleaded guilty last week to bribery charges in connection with a
Pentagon fraud investigation.
   Jack Sherman, the Marine Corps executive, was served with a
written notice advising him of the government's decision ``to
terminate (his) federal employment,'' the service said in a brief
statement.
   ``Federal personnel regulations require that employees proposed
for removal based on a criminal conviction or guilty plea be
provided written notice and at least seven days in which to comment
before final action is taken.''
   The 52-year-old Sherman appeared in federal court Jan. 27 and
pleaded guilty to accepting bribes in exchange for providing
confidential contract information to consultants and companies.
   He could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of as much as
$500,000 when sentenced April 7.
   Sherman, until identified in court papers last summer in
connection with the probe, worked as a contracting officer in the
corps' installation and logistics department in Washington. After
being identified in federal search warrants, he was transferred to
another administrative job that did not involve the award of
contracts.
   The federal investigation, known as Operation Ill Wind, has been
underway for at least two years. It focuses on allegations that
private consultants, hired by defense contractors, bribed Pentagon
officials to obtain inside information that gave companies an edge
in securing contracts.
   The first indictment in the case was handed down Jan. 6, naming
one defense contractor and a handful of individuals. In addition,
another company and eight individuals have entered guilty pleas to
various charges.
   Sherman, before being transferred to new duties, had a range of
contacts with consultants and companies.
   For instance, prosecutors said last week he received a total of
$43,500 between October 1986 and June 1987 from an unnamed
consultant who was working for the FBI. The bureau provided the
money for the bribes, which Sherman said he put in a savings account
and used to build a room on his house.
   Agents recorded 16 meetings between the consultant and Sherman,
prosecutors said.
   They did not divulge the names of the consultants or the
companies that paid Sherman, but an affadavit released earlier said
he had links to William Parkin, a defense consultant who has been
indicted.
   Parkin and his associates were seeking to buy and sell
information about the Advanced Tactical Air Command Central, an
$80-million contract sought by a number of defense contractors.
   Sherman was joined in entering a guilty plea last week by two
other men with ties to the Unisys Corp., the giant computer maker.
   The Navy announced Monday it had forwarded information about
those two men to the ``Navy Debarment Committee and to the Defense
Contract Audit Agency for identification and recovery of any sums
improperly charged the government under defense contracts.''
   Robert D. Barrett, a former executive at Unisys, and Joseph E.
Hill, a consultant paid by Unisys, pleaded guilty to making illegal
campaign contributions to members of Congress.

<HEAD>Cuba, Palestinians Among Topics At Commission's Annual Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission on Monday opened
an annual session expected to focus attention on alleged violations
in Cuba and the Israeli-occupied territories.
   Opening speakers at the six-week session cited encouraging signs
in regions long subject to the 43-nation panel's scrutiny _ Iran,
Afghanistan and Namibia _ and in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Jan Martenson of Sweden, U.N. under secretary-general for human
rights, said the 43-nation meeting ``takes place at a time of great
hope and expectation,'' although the world remains ``plagued by
daily violations of human rights.''
   But Amnesty International, in a statement to the commission on
Monday, called for international pressure on Iran to stop a wave of
more than 1,000 political executions since July. The London-based
human rights group also expressed concern about at least 113
executions this month in Iran's crackdown on drugs.
   The commission's 45th session runs through March 10 and will
culminate with the annual passing of a package of resolutions.
   Delegates are to consider its first special report on Cuba, a
result of unprecedented pressure by the Reagan administration at the
last two sessions.
   The traditional debate on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip is likely to be sharpened by the 15-month Palestinian
uprising. About 370 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed in
the rebellion.
   New reports are also scheduled from special investigators on
Afghanistan, Iran, Chile, Guatemala and El Salvador. Other reports
will deal with torture, summary executions and religious intolerance.
   The panel is to vote on two longstanding projects: a draft
convention on the rights of the child and a proposed amendment to
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights calling for
abolition of the death penalty.
   Restating Washington's position, Richard Williamson, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs,
recently said a ``crucial test'' for the commission's credibility is
whether it decides this year to continue scrutiny of Cuba.
   He said the Cuba report is expected to show that Fidel Castro's
government ``does indeed deprive its citizens of most of the basic
human rights.''
   But a group of commission envoys who visited Cuba last year to
gather information and testimony from alleged victims of abuse has
failed so far to agree on a final report.
   U.N. officials say the report will be presented by midsession and
is expected to be less critical of Cuba than the United States hoped.
   Armando Valladares, a former Cuban political prisoner, heads the
U.S. delegation for the second straight year.
   Cuba at this session begins a three-year term on the commission
after a five-year absence.

<HEAD>Handbook Aims to Increase Minority Presence on Campuses</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Adds note at end on how to obtain book.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A first-of-a-kind handbook designed to promote
ethnic diversity and defuse racial tensions on campus should be ``on
the shelf of every university president in America,'' Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos said Monday.
   The 181-page book, compiled by the private American Council on
Education, is meant to help colleges and universities bolster their
minority student and faculty populations at a time when black
enrollment is stagnating.
   ``This is the first time we've put together a comprehensive
approach. Our role is trying to set an agenda,'' said the council's
president, Robert Atwell. ``Many, many institutions around the
country are addressing this problem... At the same time, others out
there are really looking for help.''
   The hardcover book, called ``Minorities on Campus: A Handbook for
Enhancing Diversity,'' says that the last several years ``have
brought a disturbing increase of racially and ethnically motivated
violence and conflict on campuses across the country.''
   Atwell said the absence of role models, instances of outright
racism and ``so much indifference'' among students too young to have
lived through the civil rights movement combine to create major
problems on some campuses.
   A campus climate can be overtly hostile but the problems are more
likely to be subtle, the handbook says. ``Minority students often
feel marginal, conspicuous and isolated from the mainstream of the
institution,'' it says.
   The book says universities should demonstrate a commitment to
ethnic diversity through hiring practices, reward systems and the
inclusion of minorities in all phases of campus life. And it warns
administrators to ``pay attention to symbols,'' such as Confederate
flags and fraternity slave auctions, that minority students may find
deeply offensive.
   The book says institutions should examine the racial makeup of
their governing boards, faculty, senior and mid-level administration
staffs, department chairmen and unit heads, professional staff,
support staff and undergraduates.
   The book goes on to discuss how to recruit minority students and
faculty members and how to make campuses more hospitable to minority
groups.
   The book says college presidents must set the tone for their
campuses, and with actions as well as words.
   ``I hope that this document is on the shelf of every university
president in America today,'' Cavazos said at a briefing on the
book. ``If the leadership doesn't come from the top, it's not going
to happen. So I would say to my colleagues, to college presidents,
`Pay attention.'''
   The council, a private group representing the nation's colleges
and universities, released the handbook a week after issuing a
report citing a substantial drop in black male enrollment and
continued slim representation of other minority groups among
students, teachers and administrators.
   The best way to assure minority students' success is to ``build a
critical mass of minorities on campus'' of about 30 percent
enrollment, the book says. It acknowledges that is not a realistic
goal for most institutions but offers suggestions to bolster the
minority presence on campus. Among them:
   _Develop a recruiting plan that reaches to the elementary school
level and views adults as prospective students as well.
   _Consider grades, community service, leadership record, essays
and interviews in addition to test scores as part of the admissions
process.
   _Help minority students apply for admission and financial aid.
   _Provide more work-study programs and fewer loans to minority
students, and offer budget counseling and emergency loan services to
needy students.
   In the past decade the balance of student financial aid has
shifted from mostly grants to mostly loans, with grants now
accounting for about 40 percent of federally sponsored aid, as
opposed to 83 percent 10 years ago, according to the organization.
Cavazos has said he wants to reverse the trend but cautioned Monday
that ``you're not going to turn around that issue overnight with the
budget restraints we face. We have to be realistic.''
   Overall college enrollment increased from 11 million to 12.5
million from 1976 to 1986. but black male enrollment dropped by
34,000 students, from a 4.3 percent share to a 3.5 percent share.

<HEAD>Four Families, Church Camp Operators Settle Lawsuit in Bus Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KERRVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operators of a church youth camp and
the families of four teen-agers who drowned in a 1987 flooding
accident settled three negligence lawsuits Monday.
   Terms of the deal reached in Kerrville, where the civil lawsuits
totaling $11 million were being heard, were not released.
   The families of John Bankston Jr. and Leslie Gossett, plus
sisters Stacey Smith and Tonya Smith, had filed the lawsuits.
   Named in the lawsuit were the Pot O' Gold Ranch Camp and its
operators, Huisache Avenue Baptist Church in San Antonio, and two
camp administrators.
   The July 1987 accident occurred when the bus drove along the
rain-swollen Guadalupe River. Ten Dallas-area teen-agers died, but
33 others in the bus and van survived in dramatic rescues.
   The trial of the civil lawsuits began one week ago in Kerrville.
The families alleged camp administrators were negligent for allowing
the vehicles to try to leave the camp during the flooding.
   Other lawsuits stemming from the drownings are pending.

<HEAD>Study Says Electric Power Shortages Possible in 1990s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation may face an electricity shortage in
the 1990s unless power companies build more new generating capacity
than currently planned, a trade group said Monday.
   Based on conservative projections of growth in electricity
demand, the nation will need an additional 50,000 megawatts of
generating capacity by 1997 in order to avoid a shortage, a newly
published American Gas Association study said.
   That amount would be needed in addition to the 32,500 megawatts
of capacity currently under construction, the study said.
   Using an assumption of faster electricity demand growth over the
next decade, which the gas group said it considered to be more
realistic, an additional 105,000 megawatts of plant capacity would
be needed to avoid shortages.
   The study said 71 percent of capacity additions planned in the
1979-88 period were canceled.

<HEAD>Review Sought of Bridge-Inspection Rule Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An auto-safety advocacy group and relatives of
people killed in a New York bridge collapse filed a petition Monday
asking the Federal Highway Administration to reconsider a bridge
inspection rule they said showed ``a callous indifference toward
public safety.''
   The rule, passed last August and affecting some 122,000 bridges
nationwide, allows states to inspect bridges every four years
instead of every two years _ as previously required _ and requires
an underwater inspection every five years.
   The federal agency ``has issued the final rule despite the
documented inadequacies of state bridge inspection programs covering
576,000 bridges,'' Clarence M. Ditlow III, executive director of the
Center for Auto Safety, said in a letter accompanying the petition
by the center and relatives of three victims of the 1987 New York
State Thruway bridge collapse.
   ``For example, the National Transportation Safety Board, which
opposed the rule, identified insufficient state inspection practices
as a major contributing factor in the deadly collapse of the
Schoharie Creek bridge,'' he said.
   The span fell into the Schoharie Creek on April 5, 1987, after
days of rain and flooding. Four cars and a tractor-trailer plunged
into the water, killing 10 people. A year later, the chairman of the
National Transportation Safety Board made an urgent call for highway
bridge inspections, noting that 43,000 bridges in the United States
had not been inspected within two years, as was then required by the
Federal Highway Administration.
   Henry Jasney, a spokesman for the Center for Auto Safety, said
Monday that the highway agency had no data or engineering analyses
to support changing its bridge inspection rule.
   ``Essentially what it does is it pinches pennies and saves some
money on inspections, but at the cost of better safety,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mandate Renewed; Israel Accused of Allowing `Inexcusable' Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council extended the U.N.
peacekeeping mandate in Lebanon for six more months Monday. The
secretary-general said Israel was allowing ``inexcusable'' violence
against U.N. forces.
   The 15-member council renewed the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon
despite the high cost and Israel's refusal to leave the border
``security zone'' it maintains with the aid of the South Lebanon
Army, a surrogate militia.
   Council members accepted the recommendations of Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, who recommended last week that the
operation continue.
   His report to the council contained his strongest criticism of
Israel to date in connection wiith UNIFIL.
   Perez de Cuellar cited numerous violent acts against the force,
including the abduction by a pro-Iranian group last February of Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins, a U.S. military observer attached to it.
   The secretary-general also said: ``No less inexcusable are the
daily firings close to UNIFIL positions and vehicles.
   ``Most ... are the work of the SLA. The Israeli authorities, who
arm, pay, train and direct the SLA, have repeatedly been urged at
all levels to ensure that this dangerous practice is brought to an
end.''
   Israeli efforts to curb the SLA six months ago lessened the
danger, he said, ``but I regret that the incidence of firings close
to UNIFIL positions has since risen close to its former level.''
   UNIFIL was created in March 1978 to confirm the withdrawal of an
Israeli invasion force, restore security in south Lebanon and help
the Lebanese government regain authority there. The force of 5,889
soldiers and other personnel from nine nations costs about $11.7
million a year.

   Two ``very tiny polyps'' were removed from
Gov. William A. O'Neill's colon Monday and sent for laboratory tests
to determine if they are cancerous.
   Test results are due later in the week, according to a statement
issued by St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford.
   O'Neill, 58, went to work at his office after the procedure and
told reporters he felt fine.
   A year ago, his doctors found three colon polyps, one of which
contained a small cluster of cancer cells. In June, three more were
removed, all benign.
   ``Sometimes they recur and sometimes they do not,'' O'Neill said.
``These happened to have recurred and hopefully everything will be
OK.''
   The hospital statement said Dr.rdinator of
gastroenterology, and Dr. David Walters, coordinator of colorectal
surgery, examined the governor's large intestin Jay Benson, cooe.
   ``The governor's physicians report that the one-hour examination
went very well,'' it said.
   Carole Stasiowski, a hospital spokeswoman, said colon polyps
recur in about 15 percent of such cases.
   O'Neill also has had heart problems. He suffered a heart attack
in 1981 and later had bypass surgery.

   Conservative politicians said Monday they may have
lost touch with like-minded voters after surprising legislative
election victories by a tiny ultra-right party led by a former Nazi
SS soldier.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his governing Christian Democrats
would have to ``take care of conservative voters'' who defected.
   The conservative Republican Party captured 11 of the West Berlin
legislature's 138 seats in Sunday's balloting. It also will have two
seats in the federal parliament in Bonn after next year's national
elections, giving the ultra-right its first representation in
parliament since 1953.
   Police said more than 10,000 people demonstrated in downtown West
Berlin late Monday to protest the Republicans' showing. There were
isolated rock- throwing incidents and vandalism, but no violence or
arrests, they said.
   The Republicans, guided by former Nazi SS soldier Franz
Schoenhuber, campaigned on a platform of ridding West Berlin of
foreign workers such as Turks and giving preferential treatment to
Germans seeking jobs.
   Foreigners make up more than 10 percent of the city's population
of 2.1 million.
   West Germany also has been the destination of many asylum-seekers
from the Third World, and the Republicans called for sharp limits on
their numbers.
   Sunday's balloting marked the first time the Republican Party,
formed in 1983, won elective seats at the state level. Schoenhuber,
whose party headquarters are in Munich, did not run.
   The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper called the
victories ``frightening.'' West German Jewish leader Heinz Galinksi
said they were a ``heavy defeat for democracy.''
   However, Greens Party leader Antje Vollmer said the Republicans'
``good showing ... is a challenge, but it won't kill democracy.''
   Thousands of people chanted ``Kick out the Nazis! Foreigners
stay!'' in a march through West Berlin late Sunday in protest of the
party.
   Kohl said told reporters in Bonn the party's showing was
worrisome and indicated West Germans are increasingly concerned
about the growing number of foreigners competing for jobs, housing
and social services.
   ``There is an urgent need to discuss these problems and come up
with better solutions,'' Kohl said. He also said ``reasonable
solutions'' had to be found for the large number of asylum-seekers.
   Kohl added that Christian Democrats would not work with the
Republicans. ``The Republicans are no partners of ours,'' he said.
   Eberhard Diepgen, a Christian Democrat and mayor of West Berlin,
called the elections a ``bitter loss'' and said support for the
ultra-right poses a serious challenge for the nation's mainstream
political parties.
   Some conservative lawmakers said they thought their ranks had
drifted too far to the left.
   Theo Waigel, head of the Christian Social Union, told West German
TV that the Christian Democrats ``must pay more attention to the
national-conservative spectrum of voters.''
   Juergen Todenhoefer, a Christian Democratic member of parliament,
charged that his party had been moving toward the left.
   Heiner Geissler, general secretary of the party, said the
strength of the far-left and the ultra-right in Berlin aided the
Republican showing.
   ``It's like a scissors movement similar to what happened in the
Weimar Republic'' that preceded the Nazi era, he said. ``The
radicals from the left and the right pick up support and constrict
the democratic middle.''
   Karl Dietrich Bracher, a prominent West German historian, played
down the comparison with the short-lived Weimar Republic.
   ``You cannot seriously compare the two,'' he told The Associated
Press in an interview in his Bonn office. ``We have no economic
crisis now, and the Nazi past is itself a control on the growth of
nationalism.''
   He said Sunday's results were ``a reaction to the left, which is
especially strong in Berlin.''
   The Republicans won 7.5 percent of the vote, according to nearly
complete official returns.
   The Christian Democrats won 38 percent of the vote and 55 seats,
losing 12 seats from the last election four years ago. The Free
Democrats, who ruled in a coalition with the Christian Democratics,
lost all 12 of their seats by failing to muster the 5 percent of the
vote necessary for representation.
   The Social Democrats won 37 percent of the vote for 55 seats and
the left-wing Alternative List party won 17 seats with a 12 percent
showing, a gain of two seats.
   Kohl said the Christian Democrats planned to form a coalition
government with the left-of-center Social Democrats.
   West Berlin is a separate state of West Germany surrounded by
East German territory. It was formed from Western zones of Berlin
occupied by the Allied forces in World War II.
   West Berlin's 22-member delegation in the federal parliament can
vote in committee but has very limited voting rights in full
sessions.

   More than 180 Haitian refugees crammed aboard a
sailboat were detained Monday after being intercepted eight miles
off Miami, authorities said.
   The group reportedly included two pregnant women and a child,
said spokesman Gary Starks.
   A tugboat spotted the wood-hulled vessel at about 2:30 p.m., and
the Coast Guard immediately dispatched a patrol boat to meet it,
Starks said.
   It was not known how large the sailboat was or the condition of
the Haitians aboard. The boats are usually hand-made and ramshackle.
The vessel was allowed to continue toward shore, and immigration
officials were to interview the people aboard while the board
remained in international water, Starks said.
   ``I think clearly it indicates the terrible conditions that still
exist in Haiti socially, economically and politically,'' said Perry
Rivkind, district director of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   A boat with 96 Haitians arrived in Marathon about a month ago,
and the Coast Guard has interdicted a ``massive'' number of would-be
Haitian immigrants closer to their homeland, Rivkind said.
   The Coast Guard said it intercepted 4,712 Haitians last year and
has stopped more than 18,000 since the program began in 1981. Almost
all were immediately returned to Haiti.
   Monday's boatload arrived just a day after about 200 Haitians
protested the treatment of their compatriots at the Krome Avenue
Detention Center in southwest Dade County. Nearly 300 Haitians are
being held there pending review of their asylum requests.
   The demonstration was sponsored by the Haitian organization
Veye-Yo. The protesters said black refugees were more likely to be
held for deportation than are white immigrants.
   Immigration officials have maintained that most Haitians entering
the United States are not eligible for asylum because they are
seeking economic refuge and not fleeing political persecution.
   Rivkind said Krome is at capacity and it would be difficult to
place Monday's arrivals there.
   ``We could put people there on an emergency basis and
subsequently move them out,'' he said.

   USAir Group, parent company of USAir and
Piedmont airlines, said Monday it will complete the merger of
Piedmont into USAir on Aug. 5 and the Piedmont name will disappear
on that date.
   The two airlines have been operated separately since USAir Group
acquired all the stock of Piedmont in November 1987.
   Some parts of the airlines have already been merged. Patricia A.
Goldman, spokeswoman for the parent company, said a single sales
force now serves both airlines.
   At some point before Aug. 5, she said, flight operations will be
joined and on that date the Piedmont name will be replaced by the
USAir name on the 190 Piedmont aircraft, some of which already are
using the USAir silver-and-red color scheme.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Says Union Can Be Called Solidarity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has decided Solidarity
can be used in a trade union name, which has been forbidden since
the Soviet bloc's first free union was outlawed in 1982, the
official news agency PAP said Monday.
   ``A name of a trade union, apart from a name of an enterprise,
branch, kind of work or profession, may also contain additional
names such as the word `Solidarity,' according to the decision made
by the Supreme Court,'' the agency reported.
   ``It was decided that this decision will have the form of a law,
obligatory for all courts.''
   An appeal of a lower-court decision that a Solidarity committee
could not be registered at an accounting company in Lublin,
southeastern Poland, was the basis of the ruling. The October 1982
law outlawing Solidarity limited the words permissible in a trade
union's name.
   The Supreme Court said the Lublin court based its decision on the
1982 law and a State Council resolution, but the justices declared:
   ``Such limits have no confirmation in the law. The law, according
to the Supreme Court, based on the principle of pluralism, allows
the organization of more than one union at an enterprise.''
   ``If there are several trade union organizations at an
enterprise, each of them should have a name which would identify it,
which would be impossible if a name contained only elments defined
by the State Council resolution,'' the court said, according to the
PAP report.
   Rzeczpospolita, the government daily, said the court made its
ruling on Saturday.
   Lech Walesa founded Solidarity during the strikes of August 1980.
It was suppressed after the martial law was declared in December
1981, then outlawed.
   In a policy reversal Jan. 18, the Communist Party Central
Committee said more than one union would be allowed in an
enterprise, opening the way for Solidarity to be made legal again.

<HEAD>Comptroller Says Buyout Loans Being Repaid `as Anticipated'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government study of debt-financed corporate
takeovers involving loans from 16 large banks found that most of the
loans were being repaid ``as anticipated,'' the comptroller of the
currency said Monday.
   Comptroller Robert L. Clarke, in a speech at a meeting of the
Association of Reserve City Bankers in Washington, said the study
was begun last spring to examine how banks handle buyouts and other
highly leveraged transactions.
   In a preview of the study's results, Clarke said bank examiners
found that most of the banks had special units to analyze and
package the loans but did not have separate policies for approval of
highly leveraged transactions.
   He said most of the banks surveyed reported ``generally
satisfactory portfolio performance, that is to say, most of the
portfolio is performing as anticipated.''
   The banks also reported ``reasonable levels of classified and
problem loans and minimal losses,'' he said.
   Full results of the study are to be released in February, he said.
   In a leveraged buyout, an investment group borrows heavily to buy
out stockholders and take over the target company. Sometimes the
buyouts are proposed by managers in an effort to thwart hostile
takeovers.
   The company's new owners often either cut costs or sell off
pieces of the company to pay back loans. Critics of the practice
fear that the high debt levels could endanger both the bought-out
company and the financiers of the transactions.
   Last month, Clarke, whose office regulates about 4,400 of the
nation's 14,000 commercial banks, ordered his examiners to monitor
bank involvement in leveraged buyouts more closely. He told the
examiners to make sure banks had policies ensuring that they are not
too heavily involved in LBOs, do not lend too much to single
borrowers and do not lend too much to a single industry.

Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Fewer hens were on hand in December, some 273 million birds
against 286 million in Dec. 1987, the report said. But those worked
harder, averaging 2,131 eggs per 100 hens, compared with 2,116 a

<HEAD>Alaska's Cold Coming Our Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bitterly cold temperatures continued Monday in Alaska, with the
cold air headed toward the northern Rockies and Plains, and rain was
scattered from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast.
   A high pressure area centered over Fairbanks, Alaska, kept
northern and central parts of the state in the deep freeze for the
15th straight day. Low temperatures across the region included 62
degrees below zero at McGrath, 59 below at Fort Yukon and Northway,
51 below at Fairbanks and 44 below at Barrow.
   A cold front curving across south-central and western Canada was
expected to sag across the northern Rockies and northern Plains over
the next few days and guide the arctic air from Alaska southward.
   Strong gusty wind whipped over the eastern slopes of the Rockies
from Montana into Wyoming, caused by a strong pressure changes
between low pressure over southwestern Saskatchewan and high
pressure over northern Utah.
   Gusts in Montana were clocked to 105 mph near Choteau and to 102
mph near Augusta, west of Great Falls. Gusts reached 96 mph at Cut
Bank, 80 mph at Livingston and Browning, and 65 mph at Del Bonita,
north of Cut Bank.
   In Wyoming, wind gusted to 63 mph at Cody.
   A cold front swept into the Atlantic Coast region with numerous
showers ahead of it. New York City got a half-inch of rain in the
morning.
   The cold front extended into the central Gulf Coast and showers
and isolated thundershowers were scattered across Georgia into
southern Alabama. Amounts were less than an inch.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 13
degrees at Gunnison, Colo., to 83 at West Palm Beach, Fla. Monday
morning's low in the 48 contiguous states was 24 degrees below zero
at Jackson, Wyo.
   For Tuesday, showers were forecast across the Pacific Northwest.
Scattered snowshowers were forecast from northern Montana through
North Dakota into Upper Michigan as the leading edge of much colder
air plunges southward. Scattered showers were forecast across
north-central and northeastern New York state into northern Vermont,
with snowshowers scattered over northern Maine.
   Highs in the 20s and 30s were predicted in southern Idaho and
from the northern high Plains through the northern Plains into the
northern Great Lakes, and across northern Maine; in the 40s from the
Pacific Northwest into the central Intermountain region between the
Sierra Nevada and Rockies, and from the upper Mississippi Valley
through the Great Lakes into New England; in the 70s from the
central high Plains into Texas and the western Gulf Coast, over the
Los Angeles basin, and across northern and central Florida; in the
low 80s across southern Florida; and in the 50s and 60s across much
of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Doctor Wants Death Row Prisoners To Become Organ Donors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man awaiting execution on Oklahoma's
death row wants to donate his organs, and a physician thinks he and
other condemned criminals should be allowed to do so.
   ``A single condemned criminal can truly recompense society by
saving the lives of at least five other dying persons,'' said Dr.
Jack Kevorkian. ``Every time you execute someone in this country you
lose two kidneys, two lungs and a heart.''
   The Royal Oak doctor has quit pathology to devote time to helping
Richard J. Rojem Jr. and others like him.
   Rojem, 31, is awaiting execution in the Oklahoma State
Penitentiary after his 1985 conviction for the rape and murder of
his 8-year-old stepdaughter the previous year. Rojem said he wants
to be an organ donor, but prison officials have been slow to act on
his request.
   The convict said he has six more legal appeals in Oklahoma before
his death sentence could become final. Jerry Massie, a spokesman for
the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, speculated that the request
would not be granted ``for security reasons.''
   Kevorkian is working to change laws to provide for execution by
``irreversible anesthesia'' _ a condition that would be similar to
so-called brain death. That method would permit surgeons to take
organs while they are healthy and transplantable.
   Organs often are worthless for transplant purposes after death by
electrocution, hanging, firing squad or lethal gas, he said. After
lethal injection, the method of execution in Oklahoma, only corneas
and kidneys can be used _ if they are removed immediately, Kevorkian
said.
   Many doctors say they have reservations about irreversible
anesthesia because it would directly involve them in an execution.
   ``I want nothing to do with it,'' said Dr. Darrell J. Campbell
Jr., a transplant specialist at the University of Michigan Medical
Center in Ann Arbor.
   Rojem's request comes at a time when more than 16,000 Americans
need new organs, according to the United Networks for Organ Sharing
in Richmond, Va.
   ``He (Rojem) has the right to make an organ donation,'' said
Henry Schwarzschild, spokesman for the American Civil Liberties
Union in New York. ``But it is not an absolute right. The state of
Oklahoma's position may be that he is free to do so, but it doesn't
have an obligation to provide facilities.''

<TEXT>
   The Smithsonian Institution will mark the 500th
anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America with a $5 million
series of television documentaries on Latin American history and
culture, written and narrated by Mexican author Carlos Fuentes.
   Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian, told a news
briefing Monday that the five one-hour TV programs entitled ``The
Buried Mirror'' are scheduled to premiere in the fall of 1991.
   Adams said the TV series will ``explore Latin America past and
present, focusing on themes, institutions, beliefs and symbols that
have endured or changed.'' He said the programs will ``seek to
capture the many ways in which Latin Americans have seen themselves
in the past and see themselves today.''
   The executive producer of the series will be Michael Gill, whose
previous TV and film credits include Sir Kenneth Clark's
``Civilization,'' ``The Treasure Houses of Britain'' and ``Alistair
Cooke's America.''
   The bulk of the $5 million cost of the documentaries will be
financed by a group of private investors led by Spanish publisher
Jesus de Planco. Adams said the Smithsonian will contribute an
estimated $2 million.

   An Afghan insurgent leader was quoted
Monday as saying guerrillas besieging Kabul, Kandahar, and Jalalabad
will ``refrain from storming these cities to save the lives of
innocent people.''
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the Jamiat-i-Islami insurgent
group based in Pakistan, also was quoted by the Kuwait newspaper
Al-Anbaa as saying the Soviets ``have no alternative but to quit
Afghanistan.''
   Soviet troops have helped Afghanistan's Marxist government fight
Moslem guerrillas for nine years, but are withdrawing from the
country Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   Mohammad Karim Khalili, spokesman for a coalition of eight
insurgent groups based in Iran, said any one-sided or unrealistic
plans for Afghanistan's future ``are doomed to failure.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying
any agreement should include both the coalition in Iran and the
alliance of seven factions based in Pakistan, ``as well as other
independent groups, or else it is sure to fall through.''
   None of the guerrillas were parties to the withdrawal agreement,
signed April 14, 1988, in Geneva. They have rejected offers of a
compromise political solution and predict the government of
President Najib will fall soon after the Red Army is gone.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Khalili spoke at a news
conference Sunday at Isfahan, Iran.
   Leaders of the two guerrilla alliances now are organizing a
council of several hundred members to choose a government to take
over from the Najib regime. Khalili and Rabbani, whose group belongs
to the coalition in Pakistan, said the council would be named Feb.
10.

<TEXT>
   A friend of a Marine who died after he
was left in the Mojave desert at the end of a training exercise
testified Monday he had asked about his friend's absence a day
before he was reported missing.
   ``Everybody was like spazzing'' when they realized Lance Cpl.
Jason Rother was not at the camp, Lance Cpl. Kevin Robertson said at
the special court-martial of Rother's platoon sergeant. ``They
didn't know where he was, and it was total confusion.''
   Sgt. Christopher Clyde is charged with dereliction of duty and
disobeying an order.
   Rother, 19, of Minneapolis, died when he was left at his post
after a training exercise Aug. 30. He was not reported missing until
nearly two days later and his remains were not found until Dec. 4.
   The government rested its case Monday, and defense attorney
William Fisher asked to have some of the charges dismissed.
   Judge Kent Smith said he would consider the dismissal request,
along with a defense request for a delay in the court-martial to
give the defense time to respond to some new evidence presented
Monday.
   A hearing is scheduled Tuesday for 1st Lt. Allen Lawson, who also
is charged with dereliction of duty. His general court-martial is
expected to start Feb. 7. A third Marine, Sgt. Thomas Turnell, faces
a special court-martial Thursday.
   Turnell was Rother's squad leader. Lawson was in charge of
placing road guides, of which Rother was one, on the evening of Aug.
30 at the Marine base at Twentynine Palms, Calif.
   During the military exercise ``Rother wasn't making it. He fell
behind. He was suffering bad back pain and becoming a heat
casualty,'' Robertson testified.
   He said Clyde told him the night of Aug. 30 he had placed Rother
on an easy work detail, an apparent reference to the road guide
assignment, in which Rother was to direct a convoy through the
desert. He was not picked up when the exercise was over.
   Robertson said at about 2 p.m. on Aug. 31 he asked Turnell and a
corporal where Rother was. Turnell said Rother was on a working
party and the corporal said he would check on Rother, Robertson said.
   Rother was not in his bunk at Camp Wilson when Robertson awoke on
Sept. 1. Robertson said he reported Rother's absence to Clyde, who
said he would check.
   At about 4:30 p.m. on Sept. 1, Clyde told him Rother was missing,
Robertson testified.
   The corporal said he knew Clyde tried to send Rother to the rear
during the exercise to let Rother rest and that it was Clyde who
determined Rother was missing. ``He's a leader and a good one,''
Robertson said of Clyde.
   Lt. Christopher Johnson, who also was involved in the exercise,
testified Monday that he asked Clyde about Rother's whereabouts the
day after the exercise. But Johnson said he was not worried because
another road guide was also not back yet.

   Jurors considering whether Joel Steinberg killed
his illegally adopted 6-year-old daughter deliberated for an eighth
day Monday, rehearing testimony on his comments about the girl's
fatal injuries.
   The panel in state Supreme Court in Manhattan also sent a note
asking for a definition of reasonable doubt. The judge replied that
reasonable doubt is ``not just guess or surmise'' but a doubt based
on logic and reached after a conscientious review of evidence.
   Earlier, the jury reheard testimony from nine witnesses,
including Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's battered former live-in
companion.
   The testimony, also from police, paramedics and hospital workers,
focused on Steinberg's comments after Lisa was found comatose in his
Manhattan apartment on Nov. 2, 1987. She died three days later.
   Ms. Nussbaum testified that Steinberg told her he hit Lisa. He
could be convicted even if the jury found he did not hit her but
showed ``depraved indifference'' to her life by leaving her
unconscious on the floor overnight.
   Steinberg's lawyers contended during the trial that it was Ms.
Nussbaum who hit the girl, and that Steinberg, 47, did not summon an
ambulance because he did not realize she was injured.
   If it rejects the murder charge, the jury could convict Steinberg
of first-degree manslaughter, meaning he meant to hurt Lisa but not
to kill her; second-degree manslaughter, meaning he did not mean to
hurt her but showed reckless disregard for her life; or criminally
negligent homicide.
   There was speculation over the weekend, when the jury sought
clarification of terms that are elements of manslaughter, that the
panel had determined Steinberg was innocent of the murder charge.
State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax had told jurors not to
consider manslaughter unless they unanimously acquitted Steinberg of
second-degree murder.

   Contra leaders insisted Monday that the Bush
administration supports them, and strenuously denied the existence
of a CIA probe into their possible misuse of secret political funds.
   Contra director Adolfo Calero said the Nicaraguan rebels have not
had official contact with the president or his aides since the
inauguration. But he said he talked informally to Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower and Republican Party Chairman Lee
Atwater, and had received assurances that Bush would continue the
Reagan administration's support of the Contras.
   Bush has yet to appoint an assistant secretary of state for Latin
American affairs, and has made no initiatives or policy changes on
aid to the Contras since taking office 11 days ago.
   ``The message ... is that the resistance would not be abandoned,
that the resistance is a reality and is part of any policy that the
United States would develop,'' Calero said.
   He angrily denied a Los Angeles Times story that quoted
unidentified government and Contra sources as saying the CIA has
begun an audit into the possible personal use of money it gave the
anti-Sandinista rebels for political work outside the United States.
The story identified Calero as a main target of the audit.
   ``It is false, it is defamatory and I am going to proceered.''

   President Bush hopes to spell out plans for
dealing with the savings and loan crisis in his Feb. 9 address to
Congress but might not be ready with details by then, his spokesman
said Monday.
   ``He'll address it in his speech. I'm not willing to say how
specific his speech will be,'' said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady met privately Monday
with House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and other key Democrats
concerning the S&amp;L situation.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said Brady described alternatives being considered
for coming up with the money _ experts say it may require as much as
$100 billion _ to close insolvent savings institutions while
protecting depositors against losses.
   ``Everybody's looking for the path of least resistence,''
Rostenkowski said, adding that Brady told the group meeting in
Wright's office that Bush has not made up his mind,
   But Rostenkowski said the plan that Brady floated as one option
last week on Capitol Hill _ to levy an insurance fee on depositors _
``is as flat as a pancake.''
   One alternative could be to raise the premiums that banks and
savings and loan associations now pay for federal insurance.
   ``The healthy institutions won't be for increased premiums,''
Rostenkowski said. ``There's no solution that's not going to be
painful.''
   Fitzwater also said Bush would continue to seek advice from
members of Congress despite complaints by Chief of Staff John Sununu
that lawmakers had leaked discussions of a fee on deposits.
   ``Consultations are a very important part of the process,''
Fitzwater said. ``President Bush has been reaching out to Congress
in many forms. We would expect that to continue.''
   Sununu suggested on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley'' on
Sunday that certain members of Congress may have violated the
administration's trust in leaking word that the depositor fee was
being considered.
   That enabled critics of the plan to seize the iniative and ``put
the worst foot forward'' late last week, Sununu said.
   Fitzwater said that Bush was ``very concerned about leaks'' but
didn't have any particular problems in this instance.
   In fact, Sununu himself discussed the proposed fee as an option
at a White House briefing last Wednesday.
   ``It just happened. It was one of the options and so the governor
discussed it because you asked him. I don't blame anybody. It just
happens,'' Fitzwater said.
   Disclosure that the fee was under consideration caused a
firestorm of protest, both on Capitol Hill and in the banking and
savings and loan industry.
   On Monday, Democrats chided Sununu for saying over the weekend
that the fee plan remains a live option.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee, said he was ``utterly amazed'' that the administration
was standing by the proposal. Senate Banking Committee member Jim
Sasser, D-Tenn., said the idea ``won't fly,'' but said he was glad
the Bush administration was addressing the nation's savings and loan
problem.
   ``Ronald Reagan, I never heard him utter one word on the crisis
in the savings and loan industry,'' Sasser said.
   Republicans displayed sympathy toward Sununu. Rep. Jim Leach,
R-Iowa, a banking committee member, said that by defending the plan,
Sununu was merely performing his function of presenting the
president with all the options.
   ``There's a big difference between having one's feet in concrete
on a proposal, and assessing the ... options,'' Leach said.
   Another GOP banking panel member, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida,
also said he expected the plan to not be implemented, but added that
it would be helpful to study all proposals.
   ``The choices are very narrow,'' he said. ``My view is let's look
it over. There might be some constructive way of dealing with it.''
   The plan would call for a fee of about $2.50 for each $1,000 on
deposit in a federally insured institution. The proceeds would go
toward the $100 billion that federal regulators say could be needed
to deal with the nation's insolvent savings and loans.
   Fitzwater said such a fee _ which some critics say would violate
Bush's no-new-taxes pledge _ remains an option under consideration
by the administration.
   However, he added that other options were also being ``worked on
and developed'' and that no specific plan had yet come to the White
House for Bush's review.
   He said the president has been meeting with Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady daily.
   Fitzwater said Bush would talk about the savings and loan
situation in his budget address to a special House-Senate session on
Feb. 9.
   However, because of the complexity of the problem, the complete
administration proposal for dealing with the situation may not be
ready by then, Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Top Statistician Says Perestroika Improving Economic Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite empty shelves, long lines and grumbling
consumers, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for efficiency is
improving the performance of the Soviet economy, the top government
statistician said Monday.
   Mikhail Korolev, chairman of the State Committee for Statistics,
wrote in Pravda that the gross national product is growing and
production of many food items is increasing.
   He said this is proof that Gorbachev's campaign for
``perestroika,'' or restructuring, is having a positive impact on
the Soviet economy.
   But he said the effectiveness of perestroika is difficult to spot
in the shops because the Soviet consumer's demand for goods and
services has grown even faster than production.
   ``Despite the increase in the output of consumer goods, the
sharply increased demand has not been met to the full,'' Korolev
wrote in the Communist Party daily.
   He said the Soviet gross national product grew 5 percent last
year and was 13.3 percent higher than in 1985. The national income,
a Soviet measurement of economic performance that excludes some
services measured under GNP, increased in 1988 by 4.4 percent over
the 1987 figure, Korolev wrote.
   The government announced this month that Soviet GNP in 1988
totaled 866 billion rubles, or $1.4 trillion. That was less than
half of the 1985 U.S. GNP of $3.8 trillion.
   To show that perestroika has been successful, Korolev compared
the average yearly grain harvest during the ``perestroika'' years of
1986-88, taken as a whole, with the average in 1981-85.
   He said the current annual average was up 14 percent over the
pre-perestroika period.
   Last week, however, a Soviet official estimated the 1988 grain
harvest at 195 million tons, down from 210 million tons in 1986 and
1987.
   Korolev also said average annual meat production in 1986-88 was
16 percent higher than in 1981-85. He said the yearly average
production of eggs for the same periods had increased by 11 percent
and milk by 10 percent.
   The official also cited significant increases over the last three
years in the production of keenly sought consumer goods such as
televisions, radios, tape players, sewing machines, washing
machines, motorcycles and bicycles.
   He also said Soviets are now earning more.
   ``The monetary incomes of the population grew by 8.5 percent in
1988 alone and by 16.7 percent over the three years of the current
five-year plan period as a whole,'' Korolev wrote.
   He did not give figures for current average incomes or say
whether the increases were adjusted to take inflation into account.
In 1988, government figures said the average Soviet factory worker
was earning about 200 rubles a month, or about $333 at the official
exchange rate.
   Korolev also said Soviets were now working more productively.
   ``It is important that the economy has begun to turn toward an
intensive way of development,'' he wrote. ``Higher labor
productivity has been achieved in all key branches of the economy.''

<TEXT>
   Government officials acknowledged
Monday that a West German company shipped a toxic chemical to Iraq,
but they disputed a report that the amount was enough to make
biological weapons.
   Another West German company confirmed it shipped materials to
India that could be used for nuclear purposes, but it said the
delivery was approved by the federal government.
   West German officials also said they are looking into U.S.
allegations Iran used its embassy in Bonn to arrange shipments of
supplies for the production of poison gas.
   ``We are examining this matter, but we have no official
indications'' that the allegations are true, a government official
said on condition of anonymity. ``Before we do anything, we must
have something in our hands.''
   There has been a flurry of allegations in recent weeks that West
German companies were involved in illegal exports that could be used
to produce chemical, biological and atomic weapons.
   Some American congressmen say West German leaders looked the
other way while such shipments were made, an accusation the federal
government angrily denies.
   Der Spiegel magazine reported the Frankfurt-based Degussa company
shipped 210 pounds of beryllium to India in 1984, which the magazine
said could be used in nuclear weapons.
   The company, in a statement, said the Indian government provided
them with ``detailed accounts of where the material would go and for
what purpose it would be used'' and that it was not for military
purposes.
   Dieter Vogel, a spokesman for the federal Economics Ministry,
said the government export permits were issued because India agreed
to provide documentation on the use of the materials.
   Beryllium, a metal, can be used to intensify nuclear explosions.
   In another recent article, Der Spiegel reported Iraq is
developing biological weapons with German assistance.
   The magazine said the Bavarian company Sigma Chemie delivered
more than 200 milligrams of the toxic substance Mykotoxin to Iraq in
1987 even though the federal government in Bonn knew it can be used
to make biological weapons.
   Friedhelm Ost, the chief government spokesman in Bonn,
acknowledged Mykotoxin, derived from poisonous mushrooms, was sent
to Iraq but said the amount ``can only be used for scientific and
laboratory purposes.''
   In Baltimore, a U.S. attorney said Monday a chemical weapons
component manufactured by a Baltimore company wound up in Iran.
Reports say such shipments were arranged through the Iranian Embassy
in Bonn.
   Breckinridge L. Wilcox, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, said
Alcolac Inc. of Baltimore agreed to plead guilty to one count of
knowing violation of export laws in connection with the export of
thiodiglycol, a substance that when combined with hydrochloric acid
produces lethal mustard gas.
   Alcolac officials said the chemicals were sent to the Middle East
without their knowledge. Willcox said authorities traced one
shipment of the chemical to Iran and suspect four other shipments
were sent through Jordan to Iraq.
   The New York Times said investigators found that a Bonn-based
Iranian diplomat directed the West German company Chemco GmbH to buy
the chemicals from Alcolac, and that the shipments were secretly
routed through Greece and Singapore.
   The Iranian Embassy in Bonn, contacted by telephone, referred all
questions to a spokesman but said he would not be in until Tuesday.
Officials at Chemco GmbH did not respond to messages left on its
answering machine Monday.

   A man fired into a parked car with a
submachine gun Monday, wounding a prostitute and killing her client,
and an army officer killed a construction worker he thought was the
gunman, police reported.
   Police and people at at Tel Baruch, a beach known as a hangout
for prostitutes, thought at first the gunman was an Arab, but all
those involved were identified as Jews. The beach is about a mile
north of Tel Aviv's resort center.
   Authorities said they did not know why the gunman started
shooting. They identified him as Pinchas Vaknin, 25, of Ofakim in
the Negev Desert, southern Israel.
   Yair Yitzhaki, district police commander, said several dozen
police officers and soldiers chased Vaknin for miles before a shot
hit him in the leg and he surrendered. Police said he fired at his
pursuers until he was hit.
   He said a construction worker _ later identified as Yisrael
Lazar, 45, of Beersheba _ ``participated in the pursuit, waving a
hoe. At this stage, an army officer mistook him for the gunman,
fired a single bullet and killed him.''
   Yitzhaki, speaking on Israel Television, described the gunman as
a ``criminal suspected of many property offenses in the south and in
Tel Aviv'' but said the motive for Monday's attack was not clear.
   Police and witnesses said Vaknin wore a khaki uniform and was
armed with a British-made Sten submachine gun.
   ``He still had 300 bullets left,'' Yitzhaki said. ``He also had
an ammunition belt, nine knives and other kinds of equipment.''
   Vaknin began shooting just before noon at the prostitute and
Mordechai Lalo, 30, of Tel Aviv, who was in the car with her and was
killed.
   Another prostitute said, ``I thought he was a terrorist.''
   Witnesses said authorities thought the same in the beginning and
brought in about 50 police vehicles, 15 ambulances and an
anti-terrorist squad. Soldiers from nearby bases joined the chase
and the gunman fled across a grassland with three helicopters
circling overhead, they said.
   Bianka Lederman, deputy director of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital,
said Vaknin suffered multiple leg fractures. He said the wounded
woman was unconscious and in very serious condition.

   There is rampant corruption in the Bureau of
Indian Affairs and among many tribal leaders, an Indian activist
told Congress on Monday.
   ``Within the past two years, I have personally attempted to
assist seven Indian reservations located in the Southwest, Northwest
and Northern Plains with economic development,'' said Russell Means,
head of the American Indian Movement.
   ``The investors I represented were from various groups interested
in establishing banks, resorts, Indian-owned public relations firms,
factories, fishing ports and international trade.
   ``I know that the tribal governments do not want economic
development unless graft is a major ingredient,'' said Means.
   Means did not volunteer the names of the seven tribes, nor was he
asked. Means group has pushed hard for Indian rights and has long
been critical of the BIA.
   Means said both the poorest and the richest reservations suffer
from ``mismanagement, a bloated patronage system and no checks and
balances.''
   He said many tribal officials are honest men and women, but ``a
vast majority of the tribal officials parasite on the incestuous
world of tribal politics. ... It's embarrassing.''
   He also contended that there is widespread sexual abuse of
children on Indian reservations, but said, ``And all you hear are
whispers.''
   In his testimony before a special investigative committee of the
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, Means called for
abolishment of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and said management of
the tribes should be the sole responsibility of tribal elders as
traditional customs dictate.
   Means was among five Indian leaders to appear before the
committee on its first day of hearings into a wide range of
allegations of corruption on Indian reservations. The subcommittee
will hear later form the BIA.
   Though he was the only one to advocate abolishment of the BIA,
the agency came under heavy fire from the others.
   Wilma Mankiller, chief of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, said
it was an anachronism which has barely changed since its inception,
despite changes among the tribes.
   ``The BIA structure does not support Indian efforts. Funds are
eaten up by the bureaucracy.'' she said. ``It should be radically
streamlined.''
   Twila Martin-Kekahbah, chief of the Turtle Mountain Band of
Chippewa Indians in North Dakota, said tribes throughout the country
are at various levels of development and the BIA, as it now
operates, is not creative enough to help them all.
   The hearings, expected to last several weeks, were prompted by a
series in The Arizona Republic newspaper detailing fraud in
contracting, gaming, law enforcement on reservations and among
tribal leadership.
   The committee also will examine charges of child sex abuse in
Indian schools and poor-quality education on reservations.
   The committee staff conducted more than 1,000 interviews by
telephone and in person and received briefings and documents from
every federal agency that administers Indian programs.
   The committee also examined more than 900,000 pages of documents
and conducted dozens of depositions.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the special
investigative committee, said he did not know if the hearings would
result in restructuring of the BIA.
   ``It's too early to tell,'' he said. ``But we will be making
recommendations.''
   A congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
material gathered by the committee would be turned over to the
Justice Department and could be use to seek indictments.
   DeConcini said he was most troubled by reports of child sexual
abuse among Indians and the use of Indians as fronts by companies
trying to qualify as minority contractors.
   He said the panel is still pursuing allegations in the newspaper
series that billions of dollars in oil royalties were illegally
diverted.
   But DeConcini said the dollar amount of the possible diversion
appears overstated.
   Later, Leonard Garment, a Washington attorney who served as a
consultant on Indian affairs to President Nixon from 1969 to 1974,
advocated establishment of an Indian Trust Counsel Authority as a
means of assuring adequate legal representation for Indians.
   ``In some matters on which the United States government must go
to court, the position adopted by the Department of Justice does not
take account of the interests and claims of American Indians .... A
trust counsel authority would insure that, in situations of
conflict, the Indians would receive separate U.S. government
representation in the courts,'' he told the panel.
   The establishment of such a position was unsuccessfully advocated
by Nixon while he was in office, and in a letter to the committee,
dated Jan. 26, 1989, the former president expressed hope Congress
will reconsider the idea.

<HEAD>Newspaper Publishes Letters for Hostages; Irish Envoy Hopeful For
Releases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newspaper An-Nahar on Monday published
some of the more than 10,000 holiday greetings sent to American
hostages in Lebanon. The Irish ambassador expressed optimism one or
more hostages may be released soon.
   ``Keep hanging in there,'' said one postcard from a student in
Colorado that was among the cards and letters the daily newspaper
said have arrived at its mailing address in Moslem west Beirut since
Dec. 1.
   They are addressed to eight of the nine American hostages held in
the Lebanese capital. Only Edward Austin Tracy, a Vermont writer who
lived in Lebanon for many years before his October 1986 kidnapping,
did not receive any messages.
   One letter signed by Rep. Donald J. Pease, D-Ohio, appeals to the
captors to provide an address for letters to hostages.
   ``Although it's not an easy period for you, I want you to know
that you are always in our prayers,'' Pease told Associated Press
correspondent Terry Anderson, the longest-held of the 15 foreign
hostages in Lebanon. Anderson was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   A letter from teacher Joyce Suger accompanied postcards sent by
her students at Windsor High School in Fort Collins, Colo., to
hostage Thomas Sutherland.
   ``One of the boys said to me, `I know at least one card will get
through and I know it will be one of ours,''' said her letter. ``If
he can believe in miracles, so can I. I hope you'll be back with
your family soon.''
   Sutherland, whose hometown is Fort Collins, was acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut when he was
kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem organizations.
   Irish Ambassador Patrick McCabe said Monday that after meeting
with ``a number of people'' in Beirut he had no hard information
indicating hostages including Brian Keenan of Ireland will be
released soon. But he declared, ``I have hope.
   ``I think it's too early to be less than hopeful,'' McCabe told a
late night news conference at his hotel in Brummana, a Christian
mountain resort east of the capital.
   ``Nothing I have heard puts me in a position to conclude that the
rumors of an early release of one or more hostages lack any
substance,'' said McCabe, who added he plans to stay one more week
in Beirut to pursue his efforts.
   He declined to identify who he met or where he met them.
   McCabe, who is Ireland's ambassador to Iraq and Lebanon, arrived
from his base in Baghdad on Saturday in an effort to verify reports
Keenan and possibly British journalist John McCarthy were about to
be freed.
   Keenan, 38, of Belfast, an English language teacher at the
American University of Beirut, was kidnapped April 11, 1986. He also
holds British citizenship.
   McCarthy, 32, of London, a producer for the London-based
Worldwide Television news agency, was abducted six days later as he
drove to Beirut airport to catch a flight to London.
   No group has claimed to be holding either man.
   He also said he received ``no hard information'' on Anglican
Church envoy Terry Waite.
   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving a west Beirut
hotel for an appointment with the captors of Anderson and
Sutherland. No group has claimed responsibility for his abduction.

   The District of Columbia City Council, trying
to stem the city's rising homicide rate, on Monday proposed making
handgun manufacturers and sellers liable for injuries and deaths
caused by those weapons.
   Sponsors of the legislation said it will be the first of its kind
in the nation.
   ``The purpose of this legislation is not just to make gun
manufacturers pay, to the limited extent that money can compensate,
for the suffering that their products cause,'' said Council Chairman
David Clarke, the bill's original sponsor. ``This legislation is
designed to force gun manufacturers to consider carefully the
purposes for which handguns are manufactured.''
   The plan would hold handgun manufacturers, importers and dealers
liable for damage caused by handguns, in the same manner some states
hold tavern owners or party hosts liable for injuries caused by
drunken drivers.
   The bill is supported by 12 of the 13 council members in a city
whose officials are worried about a rising murder rate.
   January is already the bloodiest month in city history, with 49
killings through Monday. That grim trend was established in 1988
when 372 persons were killed in the nation's capital, the highest
yearly total ever.
   Police blame up to 60 percent of the killings on drug-related
violence.
   Clarke said he expects stiff opposition from the National Rifle
Association, but he predicted that the NRA and other pro-gun groups
will try to block the measure in the House of Representatives, which
reviews about legislation from the council.
   ``This is a very stupid idea, another in a series of attempts by
the D.C. Council to divert attention from the city's abysmal record
in fighting crime,'' said NRA Assistant General Counsel Richard
Gardiner. ``It's very clear that their intent...is to outlaw private
handgun ownership.''
   Gardiner promised to fight the matter before the city council,
and said it is likely his organization will continue its battle in
Congress.
   The district already has a complete ban on handgun purchases, and
prohibits registration of any weapon not purchased before 1976.

   Here are thumbnail sketches of people involved in
the case of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>JOEL STEINBERG:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Disbarred attorney who illegally adopted 6-year-old Lisa when she
was infant. Age 47.
   New York University Law School said he attended from the summer
of 1962 to the spring of 1964, then returned in the summer of 1968
and graduated in February 1970.
   Joined Air Force in April 1965 and was discharged as a first
lieutenant in March 1968.
   Prosecuters have claimed he blackmailed law clients for drugs and
appeared in court while high on cocaine. Assistant District Attorney
John McCusker accused Steinberg of using cocaine on an almost daily
since 1981 or '82.
   He also said Steinberg physically abused his common-law wife,
Hedda, for nearly all of the 15 years they spent together.
   Prosecutors said Steinberg had accumulated at least $2 million in
assets, although his accountant said he saw no way Steinberg could
have accumulated more than $600,000 in assets legally.
   Held since his arrest in protective custody at Rikers Island,
Steinberg was convicted of first-degree manslaughter on Jan. 30,
facing 8 1-3 to 15 years in prison.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HEDDA NUSSBAUM:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Steinberg's live-in companion. Age 46.
   Nussbaum initially also was charged with Lisa's death. Charges
were dropped after prosecutors determined she was too physically and
mentally incapacitated to be responsible.
   Grew up in Manhattan, majored in English at Hunter College, and
taught elementary school in the mid-1960s.
   Began living with Steinberg in 1970. She wrote several children's
books and in 1974 joined Random House, rising to senior editor of
the publisher's juvenile books division.
   Her behavior became increasingly erratic, she was frequently
absent and often came to work with facial bruises. In 1982 she was
fired.
   Authorities said she was a cocaine user at the time of Lisa's
death.
   After she was arrested, Nussbaum was hospitalized with a
gangrenous right leg, broken ribs, a broken jaw and nose, cigarette
burns, and bruises. Her face was flattened, she had a cauliflower
ear, split lip and chunks of hair missing.
   After her discharge, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital,
where she still lives.
   She testified that Steinberg beat and brainwashed her and
inflicted bizarre punishments on her for imagined wrongdoings.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LISA STEINBERG:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Lisa, described as a mature, bright and outgoing girl, died at
age 6 of a brain injury three days after she was removed unconscious
from the apartment of Joel Steinberg and Hedda Nussbaum.
   Lisa was obtained at birth from an unmarried teen-ager, but never
legally adopted. Steinberg and Nussbaum reportedly kept Lisa after a
couple refused to pay Steinberg $50,000 for her.
   Investigators found reports of child abuse and neglect
unsubstantiated, but witnesses allege Lisa had been a victim of
abuse for years.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MICHELE LAUNDERS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Lisa's biological mother. Age 27, she was an unmarried teen-ager
when she paid Steinberg $500 in what he called ``filing fees'' to
place Lisa with a middle-class Catholic couple. She saw the baby for
less than a minute after birth.
   Launders sued for custody of Lisa's body and buried her in a
family plot. She has attended the trial regularly. Defense attorneys
asked that she be barred because of her emotional reactions to
testimony but the request was denied.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MITCHELL STEINBERG, renamed Travis Christian Smigiel:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Second child illegally adopted by Steinberg. Police found the
17-month-old boy tethered to a chair in Steinberg's apartment the
night Lisa was taken to the hospital. The boy, now 2, has since been
returned to his biological mother, Nicole Smigiel, and was renamed
Travis Christian Smigiel. His biological father, Mark Urban, has
visitation rights.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>NICOLE SMIGIEL:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Mitchell's 20-year-old biological mother. Arranged with Peter
Sarosi, a gynecologist, to have her illegitimate child adopted. She
sued for custody of the boy after he was taken from the Steinberg
home and placed in foster care.
   Her mother, Graceann Smigiel, came to the trial regularly,
sitting with Launders.
   Sarosi has since pleaded guilty to illegally placing the child
with Steinberg and Nussbaum, and was sentenced to 100 hours of
community service, fined $1,000, and put on probation for three
years.

<HEAD>Tourists Rescued From Ship Grounded In Antarctica, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tourists and crew members were rescued Sunday
after an Argentine tour ship ran aground off the Antarctic Peninsula
some two miles from a U.S. research station in Antarctica, the
National Science Foundation announced late Monday.
   The NSF statement said 81 tourists, including 46 Americans, were
flown from Antarctica bases Sunday to Chile and then on to Buenos
Aires in Argentina.
   Officials identified the ship as the Bahia Paraiso, a 400-foot,
double-hulled vessel that doubles as a supply and tour ship. It ran
aground Saturday two miles from the U.S. research outpost, Palmer
Station, just after it had made a stop there. The site is about 600
miles south of Cape Horn, the tip of South America.
   The NSF announcement said there were only a few minor injuries to
crew members and none to the passengers.
   ``Most of 316 passengers and crew were flown to South America on
Sunday, after spending Saturday night aboard cruise ships which
transported them to an Antarctic airfield at a Chilean base,'' the
announcement said.
   About 104 Bahia Paraiso crew members remained at Palmer Station
on Monday, the statement said, to assist in efforts to salvage the
ship.
   The ship was said to be leaking diesel fuel which is killing some
krill, a shrimp-like crustacean that lives in the Antarctic waters.
The fuel also is affecting sea birds, the announcement said.
   In addition to the tourists, the ship carried jet fuel, gasoline
and other supplies bound for the Argentine Esperanza station near
the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
   The statement said the passengers and crew were rescued by
motorized lifeboats from nearby cruise ships and from Palmer
Station. From there, the passengers and some of the crew were taken
by two other cruise ships to the Chilean base Teniente Marsh on King
George Island. From there, they were flown by Chilean military
aircraft to Punta Arenas, Chile, on Sunday, and then on to Buenos
Aires by Argentine military aircraft, the announcement said.
   Many of the crew members are using makeshift housing at Palmer
Station, a NSF-supported research center designed to accommodate
only 40. Temperatures, in the region's, were said to be 30 to 40
degrees Fahrenheit. Because of the large numbers of people at the
U.S. station, officials said food was being rationed.
   An Argentine naval ship is expected to arrive at the stranded
ship by Friday to rescue the rest of the tour ship crew and to pump
the fuel oil from the vessel, the NSF announcement said.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. James Alexander Forbes Jr., a black
clergyman known for his preaching skill, has been named to lead
famed Riverside Church and its vigorous social-justice ministry.
   The interdenominational church announced the choice Monday after
a year-long search for a successor to the Rev. William Sloane
Coffin, a civil rights and anti-war activist.
   The 2,200-member church, built by the late John D. Rockefeller in
1930, has had a line of noted pastors, beginning with the late Harry
Emerson Fosdick.
   Forbes, 53, professor of preaching at New York's Union
Theological Seminary where he has taught for 12 years, was described
as being a theologian of eloquence and keen social concern.
   ``He is an eminent preacher, committed to pluralism, inclusivity
and social justice,'' the ``key characteristics for our senior
minister,'' said the head of the search committee, J. Richard Butler.
   He told the congregation Sunday that the committee had concluded
that Forbes was the man ``to lead this congregation through the next
decade and into the 21st century.''
   The selection, already approved by the church's board of deacons,
remains subject to affirmation by members, but that is expected to
be a formality next Sunday when they vote to discharge the search
committee.
   The church, with a $6 million annual budget, has become an
increasingly ethnically mixed congregation, with a diversified
program of help to the poor and homeless and working for racial
justice and disarmament.
   Although jointly affiliated with the American Baptist Churches
and the United Church of Christ, the congregation is a composite of
denominational backgrounds.
   Coffin stepped down a year ago, after a decade of leading the
church, to become president of a disarmament group, Sane-Freeze,
based in Washington, D.C.
   For the last year, an acting senior minister, the Rev. George
Hill, drawn out of retirement in Claremont, Calif., had filled the
pulpit until a successor to Coffin was chosen.
   Forbes, prior to joining the seminary faculty, had led an
innovative pastoral training program in Washington, and previously
led congregations in Richmond, Va., and Roxboro, N.C.
   In Washington, he had been director of Interfaith Metropolitan
Theological Education Inc., a seminary-without-walls for ministry in
Protestant, Catholic and Jewish traditions.
   Last year he joined in protests in Washington and New York
against South African apartheid and was among several seminary
professors arrested.
   Born in Burgow, N.C., Forbes holds theological degrees from
Colgate-Rochester Divinity School in Rochester, N.Y., and New York's
Union Seminary and had clinical pastoral training at the Medical
College of Virginia.
   He was ordained both in the American Baptist Churches and the
Original United Holy Church, International, a black Pentecostalist
body.
   Forbes says religion has a key role to play in national life.
   ``No government can function without a living vision of what it
means to be human'' and religion should keep that vision alive, he
said in a recent interview with The Washington Post.
   He said religion should provide a ``prophetic critique'' of
government and also provide ``guidelines and principles by which we
assess the kind of character that leaders ought to have.''

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega on Monday
announced a severe austerity plan for 1989 that nearly cuts the
federal budget in half, restricts credit and slashes capital
investment in a bid to curb hyperinflation and increase productivity.
   ``I appeal to the sensibility and honesty of all Nicaraguans so
this proposal doesn't turn into a political confrontation,'' Ortega
said at the end of a two-hour, 40-minute speech before the National
Assembly.
   ``Otherwise, we'll be paying with the blood and the future of our
people.''
   Ortega said that if inflation, which reached 20,000 percent last
year, is not brought under control and production not increased, the
government might implement a ``war economy'' policy.
   He did not elaborate.
   Ortega said the budget will be cut by 461 billion cordobas, or
about 44 percent, including deep cuts in capital investment and
government credits to the agricultural and business sector.
   Consequently, state-run banks will provide new loans ``only to
those who can pay,'' Ortega said. He acknowledged that tighter
credit could prompt dissent from business leaders, but he said the
government has ``been stimulating private producers, regardless of
their political positions.''
   The president did not say how many government workers would be
laid off because of the budget cuts. But in a telephone interview
with the newspaper El Nacional in Caracas, Venezuela, Ortega said
35,000 public employees would be laid off, of which 23,000 beloing
to the Sandinista army and the Interior Ministry and 12,000 to other
public institutions.
   Those laid off will be given monetary help for two months and
offered agricultural work, he said. About 10,000 workers are needed
for the coffee harvest, he noted.
   Ortega said the government plans cuts in subsidies for basic
goods, but did not provide details. He said urban areas would be hit
hardest by the cuts and suggested Nicaraguan laborers consider
moving to rural areas to find employment.
   Ortega also announced that the official and parallel rates of
currency exchange will be merged into one rate per dollar in an
effort to eliminate black market demand for dollars. He did not say
what the rate would be.
   Currently, the official rate, 2,300 cordobas per dollar, is used
to calculate payment for exports, and the parallel rate, at 4,400
cordobas, is used for those selling dollars. The dollar now fetches
about 5,500 cordobas on the black market.
   The president blamed Nicaragua's runaway inflation on the war
with the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. He said
the government had to finance its military operations while the
United States pressured multilateral lending institutions to cut off
financing to Nicaragua.
   The United States imposed a trade embargo against Nicaragua in
1985.
   Ortega told Nicaraguans to expect continued hard times and called
for the cooperation of workers and private business. He assured
landholders that government confiscations of property were a thing
of the past.
   ``The (confiscated) land already distributed to the peasants will
not be returned,'' Ortega said. ``On the other hand, there's no
(longer) reason to take away an inch of land from anybody,'' he said.
   About 85 percent of farmland in Nicaragua is in private hands,
and only 15 percent is owned by the state, he said.
   Also Monday, the official Sandinista newspaper Barricada reported
that the government and a private sugar company reached a tentative
agreement to solve a dispute over the confiscation of the company's
sugar mill last July.
   In its lead article, Barricada cited unidentified government
sources in reporting that the deal with Nicaragua Sugar and the
State Sugar Corp. was worked out over the weekend and included
``realistic compensation'' to the firm.
   The general manager of Nicaragua Sugar, Carlos Pellas, confirmed
that a tentative agreement was reached with the government, the
opposition newspaper La Prensa reported Monday.
   La Prensa reported that Pellas declined to reveal details of the
agreement. He did say that returning the sugar mill to its owners
``was not a viable option'' and that longtime workers would not be
fired, the report said
   Repeated attempts by The Associated Press to reach officials of
Nicaragua Sugar by telephone were not successful.

   Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz said
Monday the leadership has not yet decided that the revolt of 1956
was a popular uprising, despite a Politburo member's weekend
declaration.
   Soviet troops put down the revolt. Its leaders, including Imre
Nagy, premier of the short-lived government, were executed in 1958.
   Imre Pozsgay, a Politburo member and leading reformer, said in a
startling announcement after a weekend meeting of a party committee
that the events were a popular uprising and not, as officially
termed, ``counterrevolution.''
   Pozsgay said his comments reflected the work of the committee,
which he heads. It is reviewing the past 40 years.
   The official news agency MTI quoted Grosz as saying Monday: ``I
do not know what motive led Mr. Pozsgay to formulate this single
element of the four decades of analysis.''
   When chosen to head the committee last year, Pozsgay said it
should review 40 years, thus indicating he favored a review of the
1956 events. Grosz appeared to want a shorter period covered.
   Grosz, returning from a trip to Switzerland, said Monday a
re-evaluation of the political consequences of 1956 was the job of
the party Central Committee, not of one person or a temporary
committee.
   ``This debate is still to be held,'' he said. ``I believe that
perhaps Mr. Pozsgay and the committee have documents on which they
base this statement. I have not come across such documents so far.''
   He said he did not exclude ``in principle'' the formulation of
``a new political qualification'' about 1956, MTI reported.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth noted in an address Monday to the Chamber
of Commerce that Pozsgay's committee had made ``a partial study.''
   ``If there is something that we have to learn from the past it is
that if we use one-word terms to qualify the always extremely
complex occurrences or processes of history, it is a grave error
which can lead to more serious ones,'' MTI quoted him as saying.

   Joel Steinberg's manslaughter conviction Monday
in the death of his illegally adopted daughter won't have any
positive, lasting effect in preventing such cases, a leading
advocate against child abuse said Monday.
   ``Now that Lisa's case is over with, it will all be business as
usual,'' said Dr. Vincent Fontana. ``Children will continue to die
at the rate of two or three a week (in New York City) and in another
10 years we'll have another milestone case.''
   Steinberg was convicted of first-degree manslaughter in the death
of 6-year-old Lisa. Fontana, chairman of the Mayor's Task Force on
Child Abuse for more than 20 years, said he should have been
convicted of the more serious charge of second-degree murder.
   ``It's a sad day for the kids who are being abused in this
country,'' said Fontana after learning of the verdict. ``I just feel
sorry for the kids, because all those people who are batterers and
child murderers will feel this is a signal, that because the legal
system is such, you might get away with it.
   ``The child protective system failed her, the schools system
failed her and now the judicial system has failed her,'' he added,
referring to Lisa.
   Fontana said he thought Steinberg's longtime live-in companion,
Hedda Nussbaum, also should have been prosecuted for Lisa's death.
Charges against Ms. Nussbaum were dropped because the prosecution
concluded that she was too emotionally and physically battered
herself, allegedly by Steinberg, to have harmed or helped Lisa.
   ``I believe if there are two parents involved, they're both
guilty _ one is the passive abuser and one is the active abuser,''
he said.
   Dr. Samuel Klagsbrun, Ms. Nussbaum's psychiatrist at Four Winds
Hospital in Katonah, N.Y., said Ms. Nussbaum was a victim, not a
criminal.
   ``There is a double human tragedy in this story. One is the death
of a child and other is an almost longtime death of a woman,''
Klagsbrun said.
   A week before the verdict was issued, Klagsbrun had said Nussbaum
would interpret ``any verdict except murder as `they didn't believe
me.' ''
   Ms. Nussbaum testified that she was severely beaten by Steinberg
and said that he told her he hit Lisa. Prosecutors said she was not
responsible for Lisa's death, but defense lawyers alleged that she
had attacked Lisa in a jealous rage over Steinberg's attention for
the child.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who once said that boiling child abusers in
oil was not punishment enough, said of the verdict Monday: ``This
jury has done a remarkable job in sorting out the evidence. They
took a long time but they took whatever time was necessary to do a
good job, to evaluate the evidence against the charges. Hats off to
this jury.''

   Some of the jurors who convicted Joel Steinberg
of manslaughter Monday made it clear from the start of deliberations
they would never convict him of murder, the panel's foreman said.
   Steinberg faces from 8 1-3 to 25 years in prison on the
first-degree manslaughter charge, but was found innocent of
second-degree murder, a charge that carries a maximum of 25 years to
life.
   Jury foreman Jeremiah Cole said some of the jurors ``made it
clear at the outset that they would never vote for the second-degree
murder count.''
   At a news conference after the verdict was announced, Cole said
the jurors often found themselves in heated argument during the
eight days of deliberations.
   The jurors had become so angry at one another that by the time
they settled on the manslaughter conviction minutes before the
verdict was announced, they asked the court for a few minutes to
``kiss and make up,'' Cole said.
   The deliberations, he said, took such a toll on him that ``it's
impossible for me to remember when anything happened (during
deliberations).''
   ``The past week is a blur for me,'' he said.
   He said he was among the jurors who did not want to convict
Steinberg of murder.
   But he said the three-month trial had given him ``a clear picture
of what happened in that apartment that night and I have that
picture beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   Six-year-old Lisa Steinberg, the disbarred lawyer's illegally
adopted daughter, was found comatose in his Manhattan apartment on
Nov. 2, 1987. She died three days later.
   Steinberg and Hedda Nussbaum, his longtime live-in companion,
were charged in the girl's death. Charges against Ms. Nussbaum were
dropped after prosecutors determined she was too physically and
mentally incapacitated to be responsible.
   She testified against Steinberg for seven days but Cole said, ``I
think it's safe to say we put Hedda's testimony aside.''
   Another juror, Helena Barthell, 36, said the jury had ``virtually
ignored'' Ms. Nussbaum's testimony. Mrs. Barthell said she wanted
Steinberg convicted of murder.
   ``Certainly a murder two verdict would have sent a stronger
message,'' she said.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax instructed the six men
and six women of the jury that they must consider Ms. Nussbaum an
accomplice in Lisa's death. As such, her testimony had to be
supported by other evidence in order to secure a murder conviction.
   ``I felt sorry for her but to some extent as an adult, as a
woman, she accepted these conditions,'' Mrs. Barthell said.
   The juror said she understood the effects of mind-control and
brainwashing on a person but ``you always kind of hope that some
spark of instinct would prevail to protect a child.''
   Cole added, ``It was a key question whether Hedda deserved
blame.''

<HEAD>Navy Says Soviet Subs Keep Intruding, Says `May Be Action'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The navy commander charged Monday that
Soviet submarines from secret Baltic bases continue to violate
Swedish waters, national television reported.
   ``We are approaching situations where there may be action,'' Vice
Admiral Bengt Schuback said in a television interview.
   He said experience from several sub-hunt incidents had improved
the navy's chances of catching intruders and that a trapped
submarine may try to shoot its way out.
   ``We are prepared for the risk,'' Schuback said.
   Sweden has not officially accused any nation of violations since
1983, when the government protested Soviet sub incursions to Moscow.
Two years earlier a Soviet submarine ran aground outside a naval
base in southern Sweden.
   The TV said a report about foreign underwater intrusions in 1988,
due to be presented in two weeks, showed that violations continued
at about the same rate as earlier this decade.
   A week ago, the navy said it had ``indications'' that a submarine
had penetrated waters outside Stockholm.
   Schuback said there was no firm evidence, but that ``the vessels
must come from Soviet areas of the Baltic.''
   ``These underwater vessels come from secret bases. ... There is
no possibility that western countries have such hidden
bases,''Schuback said.
   The Swedish defense gradually has reinforced its submarine
defense since the incident in 1981. But stepped-up efforts to catch
intruders, including the use of depth charges and mines, so far have
failed to produce results.
   The military has said new weapons, experience and adjustment of
rules to allow for quicker decision-making is bringing them closer
to catching intruders.

   Communist guerrillas ambushed a truck
carrying government troops and a civilian guide, killing 10 people
and wounding five, a military report said Tuesday.
   The soldiers were responding to a kidnapping report when their
truck hit a landmine Sunday morning in Roxas, about 150 miles
southeast of Manila, the report said.
   Seven constabulary soldiers, two policemen and guide Leonilda
Mapalad died in the attack by New People's Army rebels in San Rafael
village, the report added.
   Lt. Felixberto Castillo, who led the troops, and four others were
wounded in the incident. A constable was also missing and believed
taken hostage by the attackers, the report said.
   The rebels fled with 12 M-16 and M-14 rifles and a grenade
launcher taken from the slain troops, the report said.
   In another incident, five people were killed in a grenade blast
Monday on the southern island of Mindanao, the military said.
   Businessman Roberto Ihaon, his wife and three of their children
were killed when a grenade was thrown into their house in Ozamis
City while they were eating supper. Three other children were
seriously wounded, Lt. Col. Teofisto Salcedo reported.
   The motive and identity of the attackers was not immediately
known.

   Hundreds of suspected leftist guerrillas
rounded up residents of a southern Andean town and gunned down seven
people, including three officials, police said Monday. Five people
were reported killed elsewhere.
   An estimated 300 guerrillas believed to belong to the Maoist
movement Shining Path rounded up the residents of San Jose de
Azangaro in the department of Puno on Sunday and killed a police
chief, a mayor, a city councilman and four other people, police said.
   Before leaving, the guerrillas set fire to public buildings and
looted shops in the town 600 miles south of Lima, the nation's
capital, the police said. The names of the victims were not
available.
   In Ayacucho, 200 miles southeast of Lima, six masked men broke
into a home on Monday and fatally shot a couple and two of their
children, said police, who said they had no clues to the motive in
the highland city or the identity of the attackers.
   Police said the attackers killed the father, son and daughter as
they slept in upstairs bedrooms and then shot to death the mother in
the kitchen, where she was making breakfast.
   The killers dragged away a 9-year-old boy who was not related to
family but was in the home at the time, witnesses said.
   The father taught at a high school and the mother worked at an
elementary school. The children went to the state university in
Ayacucho.
   Police identified the victims as Juvenal Farfan, 56; his wife
Eldeliza Gonzales, 46; a son, Juvenal, 23; and a daughter, Julia,
18, police said.
   Farfan was not known to support any particular party. However,
his brother is an Ayacucho correspondent for a small leftist paper
in Lima.
   Ayacucho is the birthplace and stronghold of the Shining Path, a
Maoist political movement whose nine-year guerrilla war has taken
more than 12,000 lives.
   Since July, an anti-communist death squad called the Rodrigo
Franco Command also has emerged and threatened city journalists and
public figures viewed as leftists.
   Police blamed the Shining Path for the murder Sunday night of
19-year-old Alipio Velarde, who was shot to death by two masked men
who forced their way into a house in a shantytown outside Ayacucho.
   The gunmen said they were looking for his brother, Eugenio, mayor
of a small village 20 miles east and a member of the governing
center-left Aprista Party.

   A federal judge on Monday temporarily stayed
his $2 million bail for a Korean-American businessman charged in an
alleged international conspiracy to illegally export nerve gas.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin said the government failed to
offer convincing evidence that Juhwan Yun, 48, of Short Hills would
flee prosecution, but was persuaded to stay his order until noon
Tuesday, said one of Yun's attorneys, Jeremy Littman.
   The delay gives government prosecutors time to consider appealing
the release order to an appeals court.
   ``Nothing is more abhorrent to our free society than the spectre
of persons accused of crimes being confined in prisons before trial
and conviction,'' Sarokin wrote in an opinion ordering Yun's
release. ``The right to be free on bail before trial is what
distinguishes our Democracy from totalitarian governments.''
   Yun has pleaded innocent to charges of conspiring to violate the
Arms Export Control Act and attempting to ship 500 quarter-ton bombs
of sarin, a nerve gas. The destination may have been Iran, the
government said in court papers.
   Yun has been in custody since his arrest Jan. 12.
   Under the bail agreement, Yun forfeited his passport and those of
his wife and three children. He also must remain in his home and all
international telephone calls will be monitored by the U.S.
attorney's office.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer, who is handling the case for
the government, declined to comment.
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald J. Hedges revoked bail for Yun on Jan. 20
after prosecutors said classified government documents written in
English and Korean were found on his desk at Komex International
Corp., his import-export business.
   Dratch has argued that his client is a victim of entrapment and
that the government overstepped its bounds during the investigation.
   In his opinion, Sarokin said tape recordings submitted as
evidence by the government ``appear to be incriminating,'' but that
he could not tell from the transcripts how strong the prosecutor's
case would be.
   He said that in a Jan. 4 conversation between Yun and
co-defendant Charles Caplan of London, ``both parties seem to be
abandoning the sarin transaction, because they appear to realize
that export from the United States may be prohibited.''
   Prosecutors contend that Yun was trying to obtain a bogus license
to export the bombs and other military equipment, including missiles
and radar tubes.

<TEXT>
   Police said two 17th-century
paintings, one of them a Rembrandt, were stolen nearly a year ago
from a government art warehouse and were retrieved on Monday, a
police spokesman said.
   The paintings' disappearance was only made public Monday ``so as
not to jeopardize the investigation,'' said police spokesman Nico
Laterveer.
   The retrieval of the two paintings, ``Man With Beard'' done by
Rembrandt in 1647, and the 1649 ``Winter Landscape With Skaters'' by
his contemporary Jan van Goyen followed the arrest of four Hague
residents in an early morning raid on Monday, said Laterveer.
   The art works, whose value Laterveer estimated at as much as
$711,000, were apparently stolen from a warehouse storing
government-owned art works in April by one of the suspects, a woman
who was working there temporarily as an administrative assistant,
Laterveer told reporters at a news conference.
   ``The lady told us that she took the paintings from one of the
warehouse's vaults and got them out in a shopping bag,'' Laterveer
said.
   After the theft, the suspects searched for a buyer, but they
failed ``because the paintings were so well-known,'' Laterveer said
at a Monday news conference.
   Several weeks ago, they gave the paintings to a friend, a
37-year-old man from The Hague, who kept them in his home, Laterveer
said. After hearing on Monday that the two others had been arrested,
he hid the art works in the trunk of his car, where police found
them after the man's arrest.
   The paintings were undamaged, said Laterveer.

   A former clothing store chain owner who
faked his own death in a $1.5 million insurance scam was apprehended
Monday after a nationwide manhunt, authorities said.
   An attorney for the arrested man denied his client is Melvin
Hanson, a co-founder of Just Sweats, a Columbus, Ohio,-based
athletic clothing store chain, who has been a fugitive since
mid-1988.
   Columbus police detective James Lanfear said the man U.S. Customs
Service officials arrested at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport was Hanson traveling under an alias. The detective said it
is believed that Hanson was returning from a visit to a plastic
surgeon in Acapulco, Mexico.
   The lawyer, Danny Burns, said his client is Wolfgang Eugene von
Snowden, as indicated on the passport he was carrying.
   ``We are going to say they have the wrong person,'' said Burns,
adding, ``We are trying to block extradition to Ohio and get the
bond lowered.''
   The arrested man was charged with theft by fraud on a warrant
from Ohio. U.S. Magistrate Gene Grant set bond at $5 million, and
the man was jailed.
   Burns said his client told him that he was living in St.
Petersburg, Fla., last April, when Hanson was reported to have died.
   Hanson, 47, and his business partner, John B. Hawkins, 25, have
been wanted by police since they discovered that Hawkins had
disappeared and the body believed to be Hanson's was proved by
fingerprint to be someone else's.
   Hanson and Hawkins were accused of insurance fraud and theft by
Farmers New World Life Insurance Co. of Mercer Island, Wash., which
paid Hawkins $1 million in death benefits. Hawkins was Hanson's
beneficiary.
   Hanson and Hawkins also are accused of stealing about $2 million
from Just Sweats, which they founded in 1985. Just Sweats has filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy
laws.
   Glendale, Calif., police have said they are investigating as a
homicide the death of a man whose body Hawkins claimed from a
doctor's office and had cremated on April 17.
   Police later discovered that the corpse's thumbprint did not
match the print on the back of Hanson's California driver's license.
The body was later identified as Ellis H. Greene, a former Ohioan
who lived in California.
   After authorities began questioning the identity of the body,
Hawkins fled in July without collecting $500,000 from two other
insurance companies, authorities said.

<HEAD>Angry Gunman, Named Noid, Arrested In Botched Domino's Robbery, Say
Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMBLEE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man named Noid, apparently upset about the
like-named character in Domino's Pizza commercials, held two
hostages at gunpoint nearly five hours Monday in a bungled holdup at
a Domino's outlet, police said.
   Two shots were fired by the gunman, who was taken into custody
around 5 p.m., but no one was injured, police said.
   Kenneth Lamar Noid, 22, of Albany was ``having an ongoing feud in
his mind with the owner of Domino's Pizza about the `noid'
commercials,'' said Sgt. Mark Bender, a police detective.
``Apparently, he thinks they're aimed at him.''
   The advertisements urge customers to buy pizza from Domino's in
order to avoid a ``noid,'' an animated, caped gremlin who, the ad
says, turns pizzas cold and makes the cheese stick to the box.
   The standoff in this northeast Atlanta suburb began at noon
Monday when the gunman tried to rob the pizza place but failed,
Police Chief Reed Miller said.
   Two shots were fired shortly after police arrived, but the gunman
apparently was not trying to hit anything and his hostages, both
employees of the pizza place, simply ran out of the store shortly
before 5 p.m.
   ``He (the gunman) turned his back for a minute and one ran out
the door,'' Miller said. ``The second one then ran for the door, and
fortunately he was not shot at.''
   Miller said the man wanted $100,000 and an unidentified library
book in return for the hostages' release. He said the man acted
irrationally at times, making it difficult for police to communicate
with him.
   Noid was being charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault and
theft by extortion in connection with the hostage-taking incident.
No bond had been set.

<HEAD>Turner Says It's Testing To Colorize `Citizen Kane'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orson Welles pleaded to a friend just
before his death to preserve his 1941 classic ``Citizen Kane,''
saying: ``Don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons.''
   Turner isn't listening. His Turner Entertainment Co. said Monday
it is seeking to tint the black-and-white account of a newspaper
publisher, which many film critics consider the best American movie
ever made.
   ``Orson said to me at lunch, about two weeks before he died _ I
remember this vividly: `Please do this for me. Don't let Ted Turner
deface my movie with his crayons,''' said film director Henry Jaglom.
   At the age of 25, Welles starred in, wrote and directed the
movie, his first feature film. He shared an Oscar for the script and
was nominated for best director and actor. The film also starred
Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorhead and Everett Sloane.
   Two companies are coloring test scenes of ``Citizen Kane'' to see
if the process will work on the celebrated saga, a Turner
spokeswoman said.
   ``The tests ... are to determine whether coloring is feasible at
all _ whether we have the elements required to do a top-quality
job,'' spokeswoman Alison Hill said.
   Ted Turner, head of the Turner broadcasting empire, has said
previously that he wants to color ``Citizen Kane'' but he has been
slowed by technical hurdles. No original 35mm print could be found,
he said. Such prints are essential in making first-rate video copies
employed in the computerized colorization process.
   Turner obtained the rights to ``Citizen Kane'' when he acquired
the 3,650-title film library of MGM in 1986.
   Film purists already had been outraged by Turner's tinting of
such black-and-white classics as ``It's a Wonderful Life,''
``Casablanca'' and ``A Christmas Carol,'' but Turner has said he is
free to do what he wants with the films.
   ``This is sickening, just sickening, that people would take the
finest products of the film world and treat them so casually, so
contemptuously,'' said Elliot Silverstein, chairman of the Directors
Guild of America's presidents committee and a critic of coloring.
   Welles, who died in October 1985, directed a number of films but
was best remembered for ``Citizen Kane,'' a staple of film history
classes. In his book ``Filmgoer's Companion,'' the late film expert
Leslie Halliwell said of the movie, ``there isn't a dull scene in
the film's 119 minutes.''

   A fifth of all senior federal judges including
former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger stand to collect their largest
pay raises in a decade even though they no longer handle any court
cases, The Associated Press has learned.
   This windfall _ increasing Burger's salary by $60,000 to $175,000
a year, for example _ stems from a complex retirement system that
allows federal judges to reduce their caseloads sharply while still
qualifying for active-duty pay increases. In stepping down from
full-time duty, they accept a title of ``senior judge.''
   Aside from Burger, the 305 other senior judges also stand to see
their salaries rise by about 50 percent unless Congress disapproves
the package of raises for top federal officials.

   A congressionally mandated drug-testing program
has prevented more than 11,500 men and women from entering the armed
forces during its first seven months of operation, Pentagon
statistics show.
   That number, while fairly large, amounts to only 3.5 percent of
the individuals tested from last June 1 to Dec. 31 and is generating
rumblings inside the Pentagon about whether the program is worth the
expense.
   The Defense Department spent $3.1 million to develop the program
and to conduct the tests from June through September, and expects to
spend another $4.8 million in fiscal 1989. Congress did not provide
any money to start the program, forcing the services to divert money
from other parts of their budgets.

   The national Media General-Associated Press survey found that a
majority backed U.S. military strikes against countries that support
terrorists only if the support were proved and innocent civilians
were not killed.
   The poll found opinion sharply divided on whether military
retaliation would deter terrorists or spur them. But a majority said
the government can stem terrorism, and 57 percent said it is not

<HEAD>Italy's Drive Against Mafia Loses Momentum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after gaining the convictions of
338 mobsters in Italy's so-called ``maxitrial,'' a government drive
against the Mafia has lost momentum.
   Since those verdicts, the Mafia seems to have moved a step or
more ahead of the state as the mob schemes to safeguard its
interests, which include billion-dollar international drug
trafficking and control of lucrative public contracts in developing
southern Italy.
   Investigators also suspect the king of the Corleone crime family
_ there actually is one _ comes and goes as he pleases in Palermo,
Sicily's capital and largest city.
   The last photograph investigators have of the Corleone leader,
Salvatore Riina, is 30 years old, and for all they know, the man
believed to be the most powerful Mafioso in Sicily today, probably
has had plastic surgery to change his looks.
   Alberto Di Pisa, the chief anti-Mafia prosecutor, notes that the
Sicilians' fear of Mafia revenge and their mistrust of the state
make it unlikely an ordinary citizen would turn Riina in.
   The Corleone family gets its name from a Sicilian town. The
American author Mario Puzo used that name for the main character in
his novel ``The Godfather'' and it was used as well in Godfather
movies. While the Corleone clan has its roots in the town, its power
base is believed to have shifted to Palermo.
   The claim that Riina moves boldly and openly in parts of Palermo
was made on state television recently by Salvatore ``Totuccio''
Contorno, a Mafioso-turned-informer. His testimony helped convict
the 338 defendants, many of them top mob bosses, on murder, drug and
other charges in Italy's largest-ever case against the mob.
   The interview was made in the United States where Contorno lives
under a secret identity provided by U.S. authorities after he
testified for them.
   Italian investigators ruefully acknowledge that the state of the
anti-Mafia front in Italy is so dismal that Contorno's claim may
well be true.
   Among the setbacks in the past year in the war against the mob:
   _The slaying of Judge Antonio Saetta, who had been assigned to
hear the appeals of the maxitrial this year. The Mafia this decade
has assassinated several investigating magistrates but until Saetta
was killed the mob left presiding judges alone.
   _A court ruling that prosecutors can't automatically try mob
suspects in one mass trial on the sole basis that the Mafia is
directed by a Palermo-based ``commission,'' which the state did in
the maxitrial. Prosecutors say the ruling weakens their ability to
present stronger, more comprehensive cases that are more likely to
hurt big-time mob bosses.
   For many prosecutors and police officials, the appointment of
Domenico Sica as the high commissioner against the Mafia was
virtually the only bright spot. Sica earned national fame as a
prosecutor assigned top domestic and international terrorist cases.
   But Sica, in a speech in January summing up his first six months
as Italy's top anti-Mafia fighter, complained that he needs more
experienced consultants and said the quality of information from a
special intelligence unit at his disposal was unsatisfactory.
   ``We can't provide a detailed picture of the Mafia today,'' said
Guido Lo Forte, an investigating magistrate, in a recent interview
in Palermo's Palace of Justice.
   He said the mob now appears to be circulating less and less
important information within its ranks one way of eliminating the
risk of witnesses.
   At the same time, the lack of a government witness protection
program discourages potential informants. Two of informant
Contorno's brothers-in-law were killed by the mob in Palermo in
recent months.
   What investigators would especially like to know is new Mafia
strategies for avoiding tightened financial checks.
   ``Iron Tower,'' a joint U.S.-Italian investigation, disclosed in
December that South American cocaine was being sent to Italy in
exchange for heroin, some of it shipped in liquified form in wine
bottles.
   According to investigators, such bartering avoids incriminating
bank records.
   Authorities say the Sicilian mob's share of worldwide drug trade
has declined in the past few years. One reason is U.S. and Italian
prosecution; the other is competition from South American and Asian
crime syndicates.
   ``The biggest chunk of Mafia earnings today comes from political
corruption and public contracts,'' says Pino Arlacchi, a sociologist
who studies organized crime.
   Laws were enacted in the early 1980s requiring those bidding for
public contracts to prove they had no Mafia links, but Lo Forte says
the mob got around the restrictions in some cases by intimidating
``clean'' Sicilian businessmen to front for Mafia enterprises.
   Prosecutors also say that since the investigation that led to the
maxitrial, police work has yielded nothing of real substance; four
top anti-Mafia detectives were slain by the mob in the last few
years.

<TEXT>
   MOUNT HERMON, Israeli-Annexed Golan Heights (AP) _ Drivers ignore
the sign: ``Closed Military Area.'' Hundreds of cars loaded with ski
equipment climb the winding road each weekend to the only
snow-capped mountain available.
   Mount Hermon borders on Syria and Lebanon and affords the Israeli
army with a strategic look into enemy territory. But that has not
prevented the mountain from becoming a popular ski resort for
Israelis, most of whom rarely see snow and are more accustomed to
sun-drenched Mediterranean beaches.
   As skiers whizzed down Israel's side of Mount Hermon one recent
weekend, soldiers with submachine guns gingerly stepped around
toddlers on sleds, brought to the resort by parents who might have
driven four or five hours just so the youngsters could get their
first taste of fun in the snow.
   ``It's not much, but it's all we've got,'' said veteran skier
Aryeh Morris.
   Morris said he first learned to ski in 1968, a year after the
Golan Heights were captured by the Israelis from Syria. There were
no cable cars then and no ski resort, but there was an army base and
a shack at the top of the 6,000-foot mountain.
   ``I used to hitch a ride up in a command car with troops, and
then I skied down. That's how I learned how to ski,'' he said.
   Since then he has joined the Israel Ski Club and has taken annual
trips to European resorts.
   Crowding takes some of the pleasure out of skiing at Mount
Hermon. One complaint is the snow blanket has been worn thin by too
many skiers, but there also is grousing about short trails, high
prices and an irregular policy on opening.
   A day of skiing costs the equivalent of about $80, a price one
Israeli characterized as ``an arm and a leg.'' Israel's average
monthly wage is $800.
   When there's a heavy snowstorm the resort is usually closed for
the day because the owners can't clear access roads. Other times the
army closes the mountain without warning for security reasons.
   Skiers also complain that their compatriots are rude on the
slopes. Indeed, there seems to be no Hebrew equivalent for ``Passing
on the right!'' or ``Coming by on your left'' _ only an occasional
grunt, which usually comes too late.
   ``They're wild animals, I wanted to clobber one kid,'' said
Shmuel Shene, a 52-year-old Israeli businessman, who prefers skiing
in Chamonix, France. ``They're just like they are on the roads,
trying to show off.''
   The army usually doesn't enforce the ``Closed Military Area''
warning, but security is tight. Soldiers man the cable car stations,
using the mountain tops as lookout points to scan the area.
   ``We live inside the army,'' said Eli Sagron, who manages the
resort. ``They need us and we need them.''
   Mount Hermon is popularly known in Israel as ``the eyes of the
nation,'' a name that stuck after it was captured in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war and an army officer used the phrase to stress the
mountain's strategic importance.
   Israel annnexed the Golan Heights in 1981, though Syria still
claims the territory. The ski-lift is just two miles from the border
with both Syria, Israel's most hardline foe, and Lebanon, where
guerrilla attacks often originate.
   On the recent weekend, troops spotted a man parachuting onto the
slopes and were about to open fire when they were told he was a
soldier who had permission to make the jump. The soldiers thought he
was a guerrilla using a new method to infiltrate.
   Last year, just about 10 miles southeast of Mount Hermon, a
Palestinian guerrilla hang-glided into Israeli from inside Lebanon
and attacked an army base, killing six soldiers. Nearby Mount Dov
has been the site of numerous Arab infiltration attempts from
Lebanon.
   But with all the troops on Mount Hermon, said one soldier, ``This
is probably the safest place in Israel.''
   At least 300,000 visitors flock to the mountain each year during
the December-April season, according to Sagron.
   ``Ninety-five percent of them don't ski,'' Sagron said. ``They
come to play in the snow, sled on the little plastic sleds and go up
the cable car to see the view.''

   Iranian leaders of all stripes are calling
for greater political and social freedom now that the war with Iraq
appears over and the Islamic revolution reaches its 10th anniversary
Feb. 11.
   As the country prepares to face the challenges of peace after
eight years of war in the Persian Gulf, progressive religious
figures are urging fresh interpretations of the sharia, Islam's
religious laws and cornerstone of Iran's rigid political and social
system.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's supreme authority, has thrown
his weight behind the trend.
   In a decree Jan. 4, he stressed the need for Islam to adapt to
the modern world. His decree was seen as one of his most important
pronouncements since the revolution that toppled Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi in 1979.
   He called on the conservative Council of Guardians, which has
repeatedly blocked key economic legislation on the grounds it
violated Islam's tenets, to avoid obscure theological arguments that
will ``drive us to dead ends.''
   Khomeini, 88 years old, was reflecting a groundswell of sentiment
among influential religious and political leaders seeking to move
Iran toward a ``Decade of Dawn.''
   The revolutionary patriarch, who during the war with Iraq
repeatedly appealed to his bickering officials for unity, refused
requests in November that he settle a fierce debate over economic
policy. He urged open discussion.
   He decreed that ``academic argument should be given a high place
in Islam and encouraged, rather than suppressed'' because of
``dogmatic interpretations and authoritarian outlooks.''
   The progressive moves are taking place at the same time as a new
wave of dissident executions, in which by most accounts hundreds
have died.
   The executions, along with the prospect of a power struggle for
supremacy in the post-Khomeini era and the influence among 50
million Iranians of the deeply entrenched mullahs, or Shiite Moslem
priests, have made many people skeptical about just how far Iran
will progress along a progressive course.
   Travellers from Tehran, the capital, say many Iranians refer to
the next 10 years (the Decade of Dawn to officials) as the ``Decade
of Suffering.''
   Nonetheless, there are clear indications the winds of change are
blowing stronger.
   Freedom of expression and other liberties were widely restricted
during the Persian Gulf war, but with the cease-fire restrictions
appear to have been relaxed.
   Hojatoleslam Mohammad Javad Hojati Kermani, a middle-ranking
cleric who has become Iran's most popular newspaper columnist,
recently chided traditionalist mullahs.
   ``In the same way that permitting what God has forbidden is
forbidden, forbidding what God has permitted is also forbidden,'' he
wrote in Tehran's Ettela'at newspaper.
   ``I am puzzled why our religious authorities consider the safe
course to be obsessively guarding the fortress of what has been
forbidden rather than guarding the flower garden of what is indeed
permitted by God.''
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, viewed as the government's
leading pragmatist and architect of efforts to open up Iran after a
decade of isolation, noted in a recent speech: ``We still have a lot
of unanswered questions with regard to society.
   ``We have not come forward with clear principles in our foreign
policy ... or in religious matters that vastly differ today from
earlier eras of Islam.''
   After the sacrifices of the war, in which by some estimates 1
million Iranians were killed, Iranians want to enjoy the fruits of
peace.
   Scheherazade Daneshku, a Paris-based Iranian analyst, noted that
leaders like Rafsanjani understand that now ``some of the more
puritanical and uncompromising aspects of Islamic rule will almost
certainly have to be dispensed with.''
   Khomeini's designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri,
who has long urged wider freedoms, told Islamic students last
October: ``Freedom of expression ... is the natural and
constitutional right of every individual.
   ``The officials of this country and the revolution, who
experienced the bitter taste of repression under the monarchy,
should take notice of this and avoid the assumption we no longer
need freedom of expression.''
   Montazeri warned: ``Should we grow intolerant to challenges to
our ideas, these challenges will inevitably turn into bullets.''
   Parliament member Elias Hazrati declared during a debate on
postwar reconstruction and the future shape of society: ``Ten years
after the revolution, we have to bitterly admit that we have not
been successful in developing and reforming the systems we inherited
from the former regime.''
   Cleric Kermani noted in one of his columns: ``There are still
people who refuse to listen to the radio, watch television or
believe that women should not participate in marches and Friday
prayers, let alone Parliament.
   ``Some citizens are still heard complaining about the songs aired
on the radio and TV. They are against women appearing on television
as newscasters, interviewers and actresses and doubt the
advisability of consorting with foreign non-Moslems, infidels,
communists and women who do not wear the chador (cloaklike dress).''
   Khomeini said in a letter Oct.5 to Hojatoleslam Mohammad Hussein
Qadiri, a senior religious scholar at the Qom seminary who
questioned the ayatollah's ruling that chess and musical instruments
were permissible under Islamic law: ``According to your reverence's
interpretation of the hagiological tradition, modern civilization
should be destroyed and people should go back to mud huts or live in
deserts forever.''
   Khomeini urged Qadiri to ``avoid being affected by sanctimonious
and illiterate mullahs'' whom many Iranians criticize for burying
religion in inflexible tenets and medieval interpretations of the
Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Kermani noted that Khomeini's precepts are ``the start of a new
revolution in our deep-rooted ... traditional theology. ... Now is
the time to explicitly say that there must be a transformation, a
revolution in the way that the huge resources of the rich Shiite
theology are being exploited.''
   He said the brand of theology presented by backward-looking
clerics is ``not capable of managing a home or a village, let alone
a country!''
   Mohammad Hashemi, Rafsanjani's brother and head of the state-run
television and radio network, called in a November for greater media
freedom to air grievances and criticism of the government.
   Official action, he added, in an interview published by his
network's Soroush magazine, had prevented his organization from
``doing our duty in reflecting criticisms to the extent that our
mission requires.''
   Soroush also carried an interview with Mahdi Nasari,
editor-in-chief of Kayhan, Iran's largest selling newspaper, in
which he said the press has not done enough to criticize the
revolution's shortcomings.
   ``If a society is deprived of the blessing of criticism and
critical encounters ... throughout the mass media, then it can be
said that it is a society facing gradual death and at the very
least, decline,'' he said.

   Iran's leaders are trying to woo tens of
thousands of skilled exiles home to help with the massive task of
postwar reconstruction. But few emigres seem ready to risk it.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered the most
powerful figure in Iran after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and
others are moving to encourage political and social liberalization,
in part to entice educated Iranians home.
   Rafsanjani declared at a recent Tehran rally: ``If we give up
some of the short-sightedness, ... some of the crude aspects which
were the requirements of the early stages of the revolution, and
which we do not need today, we will attract them back.''
   At least 2 million Iranians, including scientists, technocrats,
managers and academics, fled after Khomeini's 1979 Islamic
revolution toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and during the 8-year
war against Iraq.
   They included many young men dodging military service who were
often smuggled out of the country illegally, monarchists, leftists
and disaffected middle class businessmen.
   Unofficial estimates indicate that only about one-fifth of
Iranians sent abroad to complete their studies have returned home.
   Iran badly needs technical expertise for reconstruction.
   Few of the exiles, ranging from former government and
revolutionary leaders to shopkeepers and students, contacted in
several countries by The Associated Press showed any desire to
return to Iran now.
   _Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, the Islamic republic's first president who
fled to France in 1981 amid a bloody purge of liberals and leftists,
said: ``I don't think these appeals will have any result. These days
there are executions ... by the hundreds and all the reactions to
the appeals has been negative.''
   _Shahpour Bakhtiar, the last Iranian prime minister under the
shah who is also living in France, said: ``No exile in a financial
position to return would do so the way things are at present.
   ``Security is more precarious, the law less respected, than at
any time since the shah's days. ... The way the leaders of the
country treat internal opposition does not inspire trust.
   ``As long as the government _ and I don't think there is one _ is
not able to respect the rights of people, I don't think that anyone
who has a certain value, a certain effectiveness ... will have a
desire to return.''
   _Mohammad Vavood, a spokesman for the opposition Mujahedeen
Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, in Cologne, West Germany, said:
``I know of no one who's planning to return. It would be suicide to
go back to Iran now.''
   _Abol Ghassem Kargar, 67, who runs a supermarket in Los Angeles
now after fleeing through Turkey said when reached while back in
Turkey: ``If the mullahs go, I'd go back and so would 80 percent of
the exiles I know.''
   Kargar said he fled Iran in 1983 after Revolutionary Guards
killed his son Sina, along with 130 women and 440 men in a Tehran
prison when they staged a protest demanding better conditions.
   He said his son, a graduate of the University of California at
Los Angeles, was a civil engineering professor at Tehran University
when he was arrested by the Revolutionary Guards for allegedly not
including Islamic teaching in his classes.
   Kargar said the guards later seized two private girls' schools he
owned and ran in Tehran for 20 years, along with the family villa on
the Caspian Sea.
   He was in Istanbul seeking to take his sister, Fatima, 55, to the
United States. His three daughters, who now live with him in
California, had fled Iran via Pakistan and Afghanistan after he got
out.

White House aides. (Nofziger, who was sentenced to 90 days in prison
and fined $30,000, is appealing his conviction.)
   Today's birthdays: Movie director Joseph L. Mankiewicz (``All
About Eve'') is 80. Author Sidney Sheldon is 72. Actress Eva Gabor
is 68. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, is 68. Actor Burt Reynolds is
53. Musician Sergio Mendes is 48.
   Thought for today: ``In the intellectual order, the virtue of
humility is nothing more nor less than the power of attention.''
--Simone Weil, French philosopher (1909-1943).

<HEAD>Brown Looks to Victory, Not Ideology as Democratic Chairman</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ronald H. Brown doesn't intend to lead the
Democratic Party as a symbol, although he'll be one _ or as a
liberal, although he is one.
   He is about to become the first black chairman of a national
political party and he vows to build the Democrats a campaign
organization that can help win the White House, something they have
managed only once since 1964.
   Brown is a sure thing to be elected chairman of the Democratic
National Committee on Feb. 10 to succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr.
   Brown, 47, an urbane lawyer-lobbyist with a lengthy political
resume, says the chairman's job is not a pulpit for any ideology,
left or right. He promises even-handed leadership at the national
committee, especially when candidates begin lining up for the 1992
presidential campaign.
   One of them is likely to be Jesse Jackson, Brown's candidate in
1988 when he served as convention manager for the black challenger
to nominee Michael Dukakis. They are allies and friends, but Brown
says his new role will lead inevitably to differences.
   ``I'm not looking to set up a fight to prove something,'' he said
in an interview. Brown said that when his new responsibilities
require saying no to Jackson, that's what he'll do.
   Setup or not, that will send a useful signal to his southern and
conservative opponents, who insist that race is not a factor but
that Brown's liberal ties send the wrong message to the voters who
have chosen Republican presidents in four of the last five elections.
   Again and again, Brown has pointed out that the Jackson campaign
was a 90-day assignment in a long political career. But it was the
most visible, as he negotiated for Jackson in televised glare of the
Atlanta convention, and it now is the one with which he is most
widely identified.
   Not that his earlier affiliations win points with the party's
more conservative wing. After working at the National Urban League,
Brown served as a committee aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, and as a
deputy manager in the Massachusetts senator's losing bid for the
1980 Democratic presidential nomination.
   Kirk was Kennedy's campaign manager that year. There's no sign
that Kennedy has reaped any benefits from the fact that one former
aide has been party chairman and another is about to take over the
job.
   As chairman, Kirk made his mark with a relatively low profile. He
engineered the elimination of mid-term conventions, issues
conferences which had become forums for ideological warfare. He also
ended party recognition of special interest caucuses, calling them
political nonsense. Neither of those steps fit the liberal agenda.
   Party chairmen often are little known outside Washington and
political circles. Brown will be out front as chairman. That's
obviously his preference, but the lower profile wouldn't be an
option even if he sought it. As the first black chairman he is sure
to be a spokesman on issues and topics that go beyond the nuts and
bolts business of political organization.
   ``I've got to be one of several messengers,'' he said, a
spokesman as well as a technician. Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell and House Speaker Jim Wright are the ranking messengers.
Brown said he already has discussed his role with them.
   Now he has to sort it out with skeptics, with Democrats who see
him as the wrong representative to choose after a presidential
election in which the L word _ liberal _ was used by Republicans as
a political curse. To that end, even before the committee election,
Brown plans a swing across the South, ``to reach out ... raise the
comfort level.''
   He knows the Democrats have problems on issues like national
defense, law and order, federal spending. But he says copying
Republicans is no answer. ``The last thing this country needs is two
Republican parties,'' Brown said. ``One is quite enough.''
   That has a familiar ring. As newly-elected chairman in 1985, Kirk
said much the same thing, and immediately went South, saying he
didn't need to wait for an invitation to go fence-mending.
   ``Today marks the end of the soul-searching, the end of the
identity crisis of the Democratic Party,'' Kirk said four years ago
when he became chairman.
   Not quite.

<HEAD>Uncut `A Raisin in the Sun' to Premiere on PBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 30 years ago an explosive drama by a unknown
young black woman defied the odds, the experts and the money men to
open on Broadway.
   Lorraine Hansberry's ``A Raisin in the Sun,'' which starred
Sidney Poitier, went on to win critical raves, and established
itself as a cornerstone in Amnerican theater.
   While the story of a black Chicago family's move from the ghetto
into a white neighborhood has been produced thousands of times and
has captivated millions of theater patrons and moviegoers worldwide,
Hansberry's original play has never been seen in its entirety.
   However, a new, uncut production will be broadcast by PBS on Feb.
1. It stars Danny Glover and Esther Rolle. It is the year's first
production in the ``American Playhouse,'' now in its eighth season.
   The new production will include nearly an hour's worth of
restored material, including themes of feminism, African nationalism
and black pride.
   ``Nothing that was cut was cut to censor the play,'' said Robert
Nemiroff, the late playwright's husband and literary executor.
``Pressures were enormous to keep the play as tight and streamlined
as it could possibly be.''
   When the play opened on Broadway in 1959, Walter Kerr, writing
for the New York Herald Tribune, called it ``an impressive first
play, beautifully acted ... relieving and wonderfully caustic
comedy.''
   Directed by Lloyd Richards, it ran for two years and received the
New York Drama Critics Award for best play. It is the story of a
family whose prospects for the future brighten considerably when
misfortune strikes. The death of Walter Younger Sr. leaves his wife
with a $10,000 life-insurance policy and the problem of how to use
it.
   Her son, a chauffeur, wants the money to start a new business,
and her daughter needs money for medical school. Another option, the
wife sees, is buying a new home for the family.
   In one restored scene a neighbor comes in with a newspaper story
about the bombing of a black family's house after they had moved
into a white neighborhood.
   ``This obviously shows the danger the Youngers are facing at the
curtain,'' said Bill Duke, director of the PBS production. ``It
makes clear that for all the joy and affirmation of the family's
inner triumph at the end, it is anything but a traditional happy
ending.'' The scene was cut from the Broadway production to save the
added cost of another actor's salary.
   It took producer Philip Rose nearly two years to find a
co-producer and the money to stage the production. Even with the
money in hand, Broadway theaters were not willing to rent to the new
production until it had proved itself out of town, Nemiroff said.
   But once on stage, the shortened play _ which with an uncanny
prescience foresaw the rise of black pride and nationalism in the
United States and Africa _ became a hit with both blacks and whites.
   ``Never before in the entire history of the American theater had
so much of the truth of black people's lives been seen on the
stage,'' the late author James Baldwin wrote.
   While not autobiographical, ``Raisin'' had its origins in
Hansberry's own childhood experiences in Chicago in the 1930s when
her family moved into a white neighborhood. They were evicted from
their home by an Illinois court, but her father, a prosperous
real-estate broker and banker, fought the case to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which outlawed the restrictive covenant.
   After trying her hand at painting and determining she had no
talent, Hansberry moved to New York in 1950 where she concentrated
on her writing, but made little effort at publishing, and earned a
living with a number of odd jobs. Although she wrote extensively,
she completed only two plays during her brief life, ``A Raisin in
the Sun'' and ``The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window.'' She died of
cancer in 1965 at the age of 34.
   Nemiroff, who married Hansberry in 1953, has devoted much of his
life since her death to editing and shaping her works into
publishable form, including the well-received ``To Be Young, Gifted
and Black'' and ``Les Blancs.''
   Hal DeWindt, a teacher, director and associate producer of the
PBS production of ``Raisin,'' said that aside from the restoration
of the original material, this newest version differs from many
previous productions in one important respect.
   ``Every moment is motivated by love, as opposed to it being a
competition between people,'' he said. ``In other productions it was
more a fight to see who was more powerful. The message is much
clearer and much more universal. If it hadn't been done that way, it
would have been just another play about who is more powerful than
who.''
   Rose and David Susskind produced the movie version in 1961.
Directed by Daniel Petrie, it starred Poitier, Ruby Dee, Claudia
McNeil, Diana Sands and Lou Gossett Jr.

<DATELINE>CHALCO, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Throughout the 700 or so years of its
recorded existence, Chalco has had its share of troubles _ erupting
volcanos, conquests by the Aztecs and then the Spaniards, and
hangings during the Mexican Revolution.
   Now it has troubles it never knew before.
   ``Crowding, crime and muggings, addiction and unemployment, the
ecology, and a lack of schools, drinking water, electricity, sewage,
police and paving _ you name the problem, we have it,'' said Mayor
Javier Tellez Sanz.
   All the problems afflicting modern Mexico seem to have converged
on Chalco, whose population has swelled from 1,200 in the early
1900s to 6,000 in 1975 to 50,000 now.
   The chief reason is that Chalco, less than 20 miles from the
great volcanic cones of Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl, is just a bus
commute away from overcrowded Mexico City. Thousands of poor have
poured in from the countryside and made Chalco a ramshackle bedroom.
   The town is one more sign that Mexico is changing from a mostly
rural to a mostly urban society.
   In 1930, less than 20 percent of Mexicans lived in urban areas;
Mexico City's population was just over 1 million. In 1985 the urban
population was 56 percent and climbing; Mexico City's population is
19 million.
   Mexico City, already polluted and chaotic, has spread deep into
the dusty valleys that surround it.
   And Chalco county, a spread of 7,410 acres about 40 miles
southeast of Mexico City, now includes 14 villages and more than 20
hamlets and has become home to a fast-growing population of about
450,000.
   ``In many ways, Chalco is a microcosm of Mexico's many woes,''
said Francisco Xalpa Benitez, the county's honorary historian.
   Benitez, an anthropolgist, is Mayor Tellez's uncle, although both
are 42 years old.
   In a joint interview, they said Chalco's troubles began about 20
years ago when the county's six ``ejidos,'' or ancestral community
farms, fell to urban development.
   Word quickly spread and thousands started flocking in from the
countryside, most of them as squatters who built tar paper shacks.
They commuted to Mexico City, a 90-minute bus ride away, where jobs
were plentiful and the pay almost double that of their home villages.
   They came from the south, the west, and from as far north as the
state of Zacatecas, 500 miles away.
   ``During the last five years the situation turned explosive,''
Tellez said. Chalco's population has been growing by about 20
percent a year _ compared to about 2 percent nationally.
   In the city, about half the population lacks drinking water,
electricity and sewage. Only five streets have blacktops.
   There is a shortage of clinics, hospitals and classrooms; two
years ago, Benitez said, he quit his job teaching high school
history because of unruly students. He now runs an appliance repair
shop.
   ``It used to be a pleasure watching kids learn, but no more,'' he
said.
   Chalco has small weaving, electronics, metal-stamping,
pharmaceutical and scissors and knife industries, but some of the
plants are polluting the area's few remaining waterways. The
industries can't provide enough jobs: combined unemployment and
underemployment runs about 60 percent in the town.
   Added to the alcoholism, drug addiction and crime are the sharks
and con men who have been selling forged deeds to squatters' plots.
   ``Chalco has always had more than its share of misfortune,''
Benitez said. ``But even though now things appear to be less
manageable, we're not fazed.''
   The valley where Chalco sits has been buried at least 18 times by
volcanic eruptions, the last time around 1300 when Iztapalteyotl
blew its top.
   About half the population died when the Aztecs conquered the town
in 1485. Forced labor and disease brought in by the Spanish Conquest
less than half a century later reduced the population from 6,000 to
3,000 by the 19th century. Hundreds were shot and hanged during the
1910-1920 Mexican Revolution, slashing the city's population to
1,200.
   Lumbering did away with the evergreen, oak and eucalyptus forests
in the lowlands and late in the last century dictator Porfirio Diaz
started doing away with the lake.
   ``Diaz started draining Lake Chalco just to increase the acreage
of his son-in-law's ranch,'' Benitez said. ``Before that, you could
navigate all the way to downtown farmers used to
send their crops to market in barges.''
   By the 1940s the lake was down to a marsh and the government in
Mexico City decided to drain it, Mexico City and leaving dry land that
swirls into
huge, gritty dust storms in winter.
   The result was more runoff and reduced irrigation, leaving
farmers unable to grow multiple crops in the same year.
   ``Now we're lucky if they get one good crop a year,'' Benitez
said.
   Some 400 artesian wells take water to Mexico City. So much water
is taken from the wells that, Benitez says, ``one day the entire
county could just collapse down to the bottom of the earth.''

   Hundreds of new pupils have entered
the battered classrooms of Pace Community College, signaling the
rebirth of a private high school that was once a showpiece of U.S.
investment in black education.
   When Pace opened in 1982, the $6-million, tan brick building
gleamed like a well-endowed institution in a wealthy American
suburb. Despite the grassy, 22-acre campus separating it from
Soweto's dirt streets and shabby bungalows, the school now seems to
belong to an inner-city slum.
   Offering commercial studies as an alternative to Soweto's rundown
state schools, Pace suffered during the 1984-87 period of nationwide
black unrest and school boycotts against apartheid. Militants
advocating ``people's education'' tagged Pace as elitist. Politics
and violence distracted the students and few passed their exams. The
school closed for several months.
   Principals came and went, vandals invaded the building, U.S.
companies that had built the school withdrew their support, the
staff served without pay, and enrollment shrank.
   As the new term began Jan. 25, the roof leaked and the telephone
didn't work. Toilets and lockers were broken. Books, chairs and
teachers were scarce.
   Two derelict cars stood in the driveway. Weeds had grown
waist-high in the tennis courts. A handwritten note taped on a
classoom door recalled an extracurricular struggle: ``Don't push us,
turkeys, `cause you'll never get away with it.''
   But Pace has human assets: Wilkinson Kambule, 68, the new
principal, and Lekgau Mathabathe, 63, chairman of a new school board
composed entirely of Soweto residents. Both were school principals
in Soweto in 1976, and from their schools came leaders of student
riots against Afrikaans-language instruction imposed by the
white-minority government.
   Both resigned to support the student protest, Kambule becoming a
university mathematics teacher, Mathabathe joining a food-processing
company.
   Kambule retains a reputation as an insirational teacher who gets
results, and his arrival at Pace in mid-1988 was particularly
welcomed by Sowetans.
   ``Parents have confidence. Children started coming back from
private schools in Johannesburg,'' Kambule said in an interview.
``I'm budgeting for the full number of 600 students and I've had to
send hundreds away.''
   Some of Pace's U.S. corporate backers have divested and left
South Africa, but those that remain are showing renewed interest.
   ``We no longer have any say in running the school but we have
recommended to our members that they become involved financially
again,'' said Adrian Botha, executive director of the American
Chamber of Commerce in South Africa. ``One company has already
appointed a fund raiser for Pace.''
   Students are required to pay only half their annual fees of 3,000
rand ($1,250) and company donations are expected to make up the
balance. Mathabathe said Pace needs 60,000 rands ($25,000) a month
to stay open, and much more to renovate the building and increase
salaries.
   The school increasingly has encouraged community involvement.
Civic groups use the gymnasium, and the auditorium is rented out for
church services, wedding receptions and taxi drivers' meetings.
   But Kambule emphasized that Pace's goal remains the same: to
provide a superior education to blacks seeking middle-management
business jobs. The first Pace students to take final high school
exams under Kambule's direction numbered only 55 but 31 passed, by
far the best percentage of any Soweto school last year.
   ``I'm interested in children setting out on their own for the
future, through education,'' Kambule said. ``I tell them, `Don't
call me principal, I'm your employee, I'm in your service.' But
there's lots of discipline.''
   He appears to have ended Pace's political isolation from Soweto's
young militants.
   ``People have been asking for alternative education. I explain
that this is an alternative school,'' Kambule said.
   ``Politics in the school aren't over. The revolution is still on.
But they shouldn't treat us like they treat a government school.''
   Kambule said he allowed a youth group to use the auditorium last
year to celebrate the birthday of the imprisoned black leader Nelson
Mandela.
   ``They came to me afterward and said, `We didn't think you'd let
us.' I replied, `Why not? It's your school.'''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Gridlock in the vast open skyways? Well, it's not
that dire yet, but aviation officials are worried that today's
airports won't be able to handle the amount of traffic expected in
the next decade or so. Further, little is being done about it. Here
is a report from an AP reporter who covers the aviation beat in
Washington.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the day before Christmas, some 2 million
people rushed to airports across America, expecting turmoil or
delays. They often found both.
   That kind of airport crush, now usually seen only on Thanksgiving
and Christmas, is likely to become commonplace by the year 2000 when
the airlines expect to carry nearly 800 million passengers a year,
an average of more than 2 million every day.
   Hello, gridlock.
   Yes, aviation officials are beginning to worry about a logjam in
the air.
   Once the domain of businessmen and the well-heeled, the airlines
have become a mass transit system. A record 455 million passengers
boarded commercial aircraft in 1988, nearly 1.2 million people a
day, compared to 243 million in l977.
   Three of every 10 adults took an airline flight last year, and
nearly three of every four adults had flown at some point in their
lives.
   Yet, no major new airports have been built since 1974, when the
Dallas-Fort Worth airport was constructed on 18,000-acres of Texas
prairie. And while local officials have received agreement on a
massive, futuristic $3 billion airport at Denver, the airlines there
have balked because of the cost.
   Add to that an air traffic control system still struggling to
recover from a 1981 strike, plus federal budget constraints.
   The holiday passenger crunch ``gives us all a glimpse into the
future of air traffic,'' bemoans Herbert Kelleher, chairman of
Southwest Airlines. He says the air transport system of today
``lacks the capacity to handle that volume of traffic on a daily
basis.'' He also says there are scant signs that anything is being
done about it.
   ``I think the single biggest concern in aviation is the capacity
issue,'' agrees John Lauber, a member of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
   The traffic demands also raise safety worries, he says,
especially since it is unlikely that dozens of new runways and
airports will be constructed and broad modernization of the air
traffic control system is years away.
   ``There are real questions as to how we are going to accommodate
this growth,'' Lauber warns.
   He acknowledges that there are ways to solve the congestion
problem short of pouring new concrete. But, he says, ``the danger is
that these things will be done before all of the ramifications are
thought through from a safety standpoint. The pressure is there.''
   Among the short-term solutions being considered by the Federal
Aviation Administration are adopting new technology to allow more
planes to land in a shorter time span and increasing use of
computers to predict traffic flow.
   Indeed, the overcrowding is being felt both in the air and on the
ground.
   Seventeen airports used by 40 percent of the flying public were
classified in 1988 as ``seriously congested'' because they handled
160 percent of the traffic for which they were designed. By the year
2000 that number could go as high as 58 airports used by nearly
three out of every four travelers, according to the FAA.
   Officials at Boston's Logan International Airport say as far as
they're concerned aviation gridlock already has arrived.
   Last summer, the Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs Logan,
imposed a new fee structure that makes it too expensive for owners
of small planes and even some commuter airlines to land. The local
officials argue that in an era of scarce resources priority must be
given to large jetliners carrying hundreds of people.
   The federal Transportation Department has called the action an
interference with national commerce and threatens to withhold
federal airport funds if the fees are not reversed. The Logan
officials, meanwhile, are standing firm and intend to fight the DOT
ruling in court.
   The FAA is still trying to recover from the 1981 strike by air
traffic controllers in which 11,400 were fired and had to be
replaced by inexperienced recruits. While senior managers have drawn
up new flight patterns and adopted a system of central ``flow
control'' to better manage airspace with fewer controllers, problems
persist.
   Only last fall, controllers at Chicago's busy O'Hare
International Airport began making errors so frequently that the
federal government ordered a cut in flights. As a result, the number
of delays jumped.
   Furthermore, the agency's seven-year focus on damage control and
government-wide budget constraints have delayed for several years
the long-range modernization of its air traffic control system.
   The overhauled system is now scheduled for completion in the late
1990s at a cost of $16 billion to $24 billion.
   But many airline executives complain that the capacity crunch is
already here.
   ``We tend to be making a conscious effort to do everything
possible to restrain the transportation system that lies at the core
of travel and tourism,'' complains Robert Crandall, chairman of
American Airlines.
   Problems with air traffic control and restrictions of various
kinds already stifle competition, he argues.
   ``Today, American can't compete with Eastern, Pan Am or Donald
Trump (who recently bought the Eastern shuttle) between Washington
and New York. We can't add flights to and from Chicago, nor can we
operate the ones we already have there with the slightest assurance
that they will either arrive or leave on time.
   ``Even in Nashville our flights often sit on the ground waiting
for a slot in the sky. The reality is we are making air travel
harder and harder rather than making it easier and easier.''
   The airlines for more than a year have warned of impending chaos.
But a $15 million grass-roots campaign to persuade business and
political leaders to push for new airport capacity has so far
produced little.
   ``I don't see a hell of a lot of difference between our aviation
problems a year ago and our aviation problems today except today
they are worse,'' Crandall said at a recent industry conference.
   The industry is especially critical of the government's handling
of the billions of dollars that are collected each year through an 8
percent ticket tax. The money goes into a special trust fund, but in
recent years much more went in than has come out.

   The Aviation Trust Fund's surplus has grown to $6 billion, a
reserve that its critics complain has helped the Reagan
administration hide some of the federal deficit. If the trust fund
were handled that way by a private trustee, complained Kelleher of
Southwest, ``he would have been indicted for misappropriation of
funds.''
   An effort to separate the aviation fund from the overall federal
budget failed last year, but the airlines have vowed to try again in
the new Congress.
   But the airlines are not free of fault either, according to their
critics.
   Most of the capacity problems that exist today _ as well as many
of the problems envisioned for the years to come _ stem largely from
the strategies the airlines have devised under deregulation.
   Their concentration of flights at ``hub'' airports has caused
massive peaking of traffic in and out of cities such as Chicago,
Denver, Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth. Since 70 percent or more of
the passengers in many cases are only passing through these
airports, layover time is minimized and a large number of planes
must land and depart in a short time.
   On the other hand, airports at smaller cities often beg for more
business.
   ``We don't have a lack of airport capacity. We have a lack of
airport capacity the way we use it today,'' argues Charles Barclay,
executive director of the American Association of Airport
Executives, a trade group representing airport managers.
   Barclay maintains that many airports in mid-sized cities are
underused and are often ignored as possible hubs. Officials in
Columbus, Ohio, have offered $30 million over 10 years to any major
airline that would start a hub there, but there have been no takers,
he says.
   The airlines argue that they need significant local traffic to
make a major hub successful.
   As traffic increases, Barclay predicts, pressure will mount for
carriers to seek out the smaller cities as well.
   The airlines also have been criticized for not following up on
their own rhetoric on the construction of new airports. They cite
the example of the proposed Denver airport.
   Planners foresee no fewer than 12 runways, although half that
many would be built initially for the scheduled opening in the
mid-1990s.
   But both United Airlines and Continental Airlines, who are the
major carriers at Denver, have balked, arguing the plan is too
grand, too expensive and unneeded at this time, especially in light
of the region's economic downturn.
   Airports are largely financed through the issuance of bonds,
which are paid off from fees assessed to the airlines. Continental
claims the new Denver airport would add $36 to the price of a
ticket, compared to the $4 surcharge at the current Stapleton
International Airport.
   Mayor Frederico Pena, who has staked his political career on
getting the airport built, makes no secret of his anger toward the
airlines.
   ``Either we have a crisis in air transportation in this country
or we don't,'' he said.
   The irony of the airlines' position in Denver has not been lost
on Washington bureaucrats.
   Jim Burnley, transportation secretary under Ronald Reagan, called
the airlines' stand in Denver as well as the industry's lukewarm
attitude toward developing a third major airport in the Chicago area
``irresponsible and hypocritical'' at a time when the industry talks
of a capacity crisis.
   ``It's time those who come to conferences in Washington and sound
off about the perceived shortcomings of the federal government in
this area to get their own houses in order if they want to see
capacity of the system grow in the years to come,'' Burnley said in
an interview.
   Spokesmen for both Continental and United insist the two airlines
continue to favor construction of a new Denver airport, but the
question is one of cost.
   ``We'd like to build one that we can afford and we'd like to
build it in the time frame that we need,'' Martin Shugrue, president
of Continental, said in an interview.
   Airline reluctance to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into a
new airport may be understandable, suggest industry analysts, in
light of other costs facing the air carriers. As of last October,
the scheduled air carriers had orders and options for 1,301 new
aircraft worth $59 billion and the airlines are still ordering new
jetliners, according to Airline Economics Inc.
   And there are competitive questions that come into play at an
airport such as Denver, where United and Continental dominate, or
Chicago, where American and United are supreme.
   ``If you own the hub,'' says FAA Administrator Allan McArtor,
``you're not too interested in adding capacity so somebody can come
in and share your nest. That's just a fact of life.''
   That may be one reason why the industry has yet to develop a
master plan as to where any new airports should be built. Gabe
Philips, executive vice president of the Air Transport Association,
the airline trade group, says such a master plan ``would be
difficult to get agreement on'' because of the costs involved.
   Nevertheless, insist the airlines, the greatest barrier to the
construction of new runways and airports is not the industry, but
local opposition _ or the ``NIMBY folks'' as they have been called.
   The ``not in my back yard'' philosophy is not likely to go away
soon, says Henry Duffy, president of the 40,000-member Air Line
Pilots Association.
   And if new airports and runways are not built, Duffy predicts the
government will have no choice but to restrict traffic where there
isn't enough capacity.
   ``We'll have de facto re-regulation whether we call it
re-regulation or not,'' Duffy says.
   The answer, in the view of many industry executives, is for the
federal government to become more aggressive in pushing for new
airports or airport expansion where the lack of capacity is seen as
impeding commerce.
   Burnley calls suggestions that a new runway or airport might be
forced on a community as ``hopelessly naive'' and adds:
   ``You're simply not going to be able to politically run roughshod
over the rights of neighbors of airports. The Congress would not let
us do that.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Once upon a time, wizardry at an early age was
apt to get channelized into such nerdy outlets as violin lessons or
differential calculus on a slide rule. Fortunately for Leo Schwab,
his birth coincided roughly with that of the personal computer where
the master could fulfill his dreams on the wondrous keyboard of an
electronic slave. Schwab has become the consummate hacker. The last
of three articles.

   ``You probably ought to go see Leo
Schwab,'' said the phoner, a member of Silicon Valley's vast
brotherhood of computer hackers. ``He's a wizard. Even wears a
cape.''
   So, off to see the wizard, following if not the Yellow Brick Road
the _ too good to be true _ Golden Gate Bridge en route.
   The wizard, capeless, opened the door of a brand-new suburban
town house. His lair _ absent clouds of steam or a wizardly
switching panel _ was equipped with California wall hangings and
laid-back furniture. Schwab himself, lanky-tall, whose unlined face
of 24 years was framed by an auburn beard, was further deflationary:
   ``I'm not a wizard. Maybe a semi-wizard.''
   Schwab was to demonstrate, however, that he could make a computer
_ essentially only an electronic box that can either say yes or no _
pirouette magically under his spell.
   ``Computers consume almost all my waking hours,'' said Schwab,
whose ``sleep phase'' runs from about 3 a.m. to 10 a.m.
   This is one of the identifying field marks of the hacker breed.
Dedicated, long, oddball hours.
   ``I want to write software and make a lot of money (a common but
not always present field mark of a hacker) and (almost an invariable
hallmark of the species) have fun.''
   Fun at the expense of the nation's computer networks that
transfer billions of dollars of bank money daily, monitor heartbeats
in hospitals, command satellites in space, switch all those zillions
of phone calls, is not what hacking is about. Hackers resent being
grouped with those who maliciously plant worms and viruses that
befuddle computers. Hackers call them crackers.
   Schwab has been too engrossed getting a unicycle to juggle red
balls on a computer screen to waste time goosing Ma Bell.
   Leo's apotheosis to semi-wizardry is not untypical.
   He's a native of the San Francisco Bay area where kids absorb the
binary system almost before they learn to stay afloat in hot tubs.
Hacking, of course, is now worldwide, but its Bethlehem was at MIT
in Cambridge, Mass., and then Silicon Valley. Leo's father was a
mechanic, his mother a housewife. They produced a Leo gifted with a
vivid imagination.
   ``I talked to myself a lot and daydreamed, usually with me in the
starring role.''
   Once upon a time, wizardry at an early age was apt to get
channelized into such nerdy outlets as violin lessons or
differential calculus on a slide rule. Fortunately for Leo, his
birth coincided roughly with that of the personal computer where the
master could fulfill his dreams on the wondrous keyboard of an
electronic slave.
   If you could afford one. Leo couldn't.
   But the Byte Shop had just become Marin County's first computer
store. Leo became its first ``pest'' or embryonic wizard alias
freeloading hacker.
   ``They were permissive. They let me run anything. I played Pong
in color on an Apple. Amazing! It was a black art then.''
   In the ninth grade Leo was introduced to the computer lab at San
Rafael High. ``I spent every spare moment there. I wanted to realize
things in my imagination on the screen. I had a lot of kooky ideas I
couldn't realize in other ways. I rarely achieved this because my
mind was three years ahead of the technology.''
   Leo made do buying $6 disk drives for Paleozoic computers while
waiting for the industry to catch up. He meanwhile devised his first
computer game while daydreaming in algebra class.
   ``Then I graduated and suddenly was without a machine. A
Computerland threw me out for the last time.''
   What was an apprentice wizard to do?
   Leo had had a newspaper route. ``Everyone on it found their paper
precisely where they wanted it. Every day.''
   Such diligence had earned him the scratch to buy a $1,200
Commodore computer when they first came out. Computer games had been
sweeping the country, making their teen-age inventors almost as rich
as rock stars or junk bond salesmen.
   The computer's combination of speed, programmability and endless
permutations makes it a natural for games by quick minds. One of the
first was concocted in the late 1950s by the three young programmers
at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. The idea of the game, dubbed
Core War, was to wipe out the memory of an opponent's computer. All
in fun, of course.
   One of the players, ironically, was Robert Morris, whose son is
suspected of having infected a major computer network last fall in
what he may have thought was a hack but others think a crack.
   In the '70s, computer games did for electronics what the rumble
seat once did for necking. Everyone wanted to try out the new
technology. By the original Hacker Ethic evolved first at MIT and
described by Steven Levy in his landmark history, ``Hackers,''
computers were a gift from the gods to man's ingenuity and should be
thus forevermore free. Money got its nose in the tent, however, with
the rage for game software, Donkey Pong, Pac-Man, Frogger.
   Levy describes how Ken Williams, a college dropout, came to found
On-Line Systems in the Sierra foothills where pubescent and
post-adolescent programmers created fun and games in an atmosphere
of anarchy and funny-smelling smoke so laid-back it risked toppling
into the Pacific. Bob Davis, a one-time musician and hash-house
cook, signed on after meeting Williams in a liquor store where he
was working and taught himself to become a wizard game programmer.
   John Harris, facing a nerdified future as son of a banker in San
Diego, came of age just as games did and went to work for On-Line
with a more generous royalty agreement than salary. One of his games
at one point paid him $36,000 in royalties in a single month.
   Leo Schwab just missed the gold rush.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The very words ``Outward Bound'' prompt visions
of campfires and river rafts. But in New York City? It's a fact. The
venerable wilderness movement has set out to tame the asphalt
jungle.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   On a wall in the small office of Rudy Rodrigues,
a leader of Outward Bound, hangs a detailed map of the wilderness
his charges must conquer in pursuit of survival through
self-confidence.
   This challenge is particularly tough. The map is of New York City.
   America's large cities are asphalt jungles all right, at least in
metaphor. But for more than a quarter-century in America, Outward
Bound has evoked images of well-heeled executives and well-scrubbed
youths in expensive hiking boots breathing clean air on faraway
mountains.
   So what's a nice program like that doing in a place like this?
   ``It's long overdue,'' says Rodrigues, ``or would appear so from
the results of our first year. This is no experiment. We're
committed now, and going all out.''
   Actually, Rodrigues says, urban Outward Bound programs are a
return to first principles. The organization was founded to teach
resourcefulness, confidence, compassion, perseverance and
self-esteem, but always has tried to include the ideal of service as
well.
   ``It's not easy to stress the service ideal in the wilderness,''
he says.
   ``The traditional Outward Bound schools cater to the more
privileged, so this is a shift from the traditional. In the city, we
serve. Our focus right now is on inner-city youth and the homeless.''
   Serving, Outward Bound crews have renovated shelters, picnicked
with homeless children, distributed food. But, on the theory that
most urban discord results from people of varied ethnic and economic
stripes threatening and fearing one another, relieving social
tensions, Rodrigues feels, might be the best service of all.
   Indeed, Outward Bound is so satisfied with its work in concrete
canyons that a staff is already setting up a similar program in
Chicago and others are planned in Boston, Baltimore, Los Angeles and
Minneapolis.
   A typical New York Outward Bound program matches a dozen or so
corporate executives with an equal number of disadvantaged persons
of various ages and cultures and turns them all loose on the town
for a few days with an instructor.
   The haves live, work and discourse with the have-nots, an
unlikely get-together in any town. The haves, moreover, must make do
without cab fare, credit cards or carpet slippers.
   They will sleep outdoors in blankets, walk where they want to go
or ride the subway if they have a token. They find meals as best
they can, and as cheaply.
   Without exception, participants report that the experience gave
them a new, less judgmental perception of the lower crust, even a
bond with them, and thus a clearer view of the city's social
problems.
   For their part, the inner-city folk discarded long-held
prejudices among themselves. ``Black kids and Hispanic kids in New
York grow up believing that white kids are weak,'' one 18-year-old
black reported. White participants weren't aware of that.
   The corporation picks up the Outward Bound tuition for its own
execs and also for their classmates, $60 a day each, same fee as the
traditional courses out yonder.
   The course relies on proven wilderness techniques transferred to
the cityscape with, of course, some compromises.
   Instead of testing endurance by dashing across mountain meadows,
for example, the New Yorkers take laps around the Central Park
reservoir. Instead of going hand over hand across a chasm, they
climb in the rigging of a four-master at the South Street Seaport
museum. Instead of a white-water raft adventure, they row an
eight-oar lifeboat up the East River.

   The lessons apparently have the same results. Says one graduate,
``In the boat, all of us were strangers, but until we discovered
that we had to pull together we went in circles.''
   On one expedition, 18 men and youths recruited from a shelter for
the homeless in Harlem were taken to Fort Tryon Park _ not exactly
Yosemite, but it did afford a 40-foot rock wall. All 18 scaled it.
   ``In the shelter,'' one recalled afterward, ``we didn't trust one
another. We fought. We were selfish.
   ``Out there on that rock there was a guy on top with a rope and
my safety depended on him. When it was over, the relationship we had
with one another was totally different.''
   That lesson, and even more so the lifeboat lesson, harks back to
the origin of Outward Bound.
   During World War II, the head of a British shipping firm,
Lawrence Holt, decided that too many of his sailors, despite
lifeboats, were being lost at sea when their ships were sunk.
   He consulted Kurt Hahn, operator of a prominent boys' school.
Hahn, in 1941, opened a school in Wales to teach young mariners
self-confidence, small-boat handling, route-finding, rescue _ and
community service.
   Holt named the program Outward Bound, a nautical term for the
point at which a ship leaves safe harbor for the open sea.
   Now Outward Bound programs thrive in 36 countries. Only two
others, Britain and the Netherlands, include urban programs, but
according to Rodrigues, the New York director, neither has the scope
of the New York operation.
   ``We conducted 10 programs last year and so far this year we have
planned 16 weekend courses and two 16-day courses which will be a
blend of the wilderness and the city,'' he says. ``These will run
April through November.''
   Meanwhile, says Rodrigues, beaming, his curriculum includes
continuing programs in four of New York's polyglot high schools
which have had racial and ethnic clashes.
   The high school programs, not surprisingly in New York, use
techniques of the theater. Students act out roles, exposing
bigotries and foolish fears. The results are especially satisfying
to the executive director.
   Rudy Rodrigues was born in Kenya in 1941 when it was a British
colony. His father was a British civil servant, born in Goa, a
Portuguese colony in India. His mother was born in Karachi, then a
part of India.
   Rodrigues is a lean, swarthy man with vivid brown eyes behind
aviator glasses. A mane of thick, black, curly hair lit with strands
of silver brushes the neck of his sweater. Jeans and sweaters are
the work clothes of his staff as well, in characteristic contrast
with the three-piece suits and straight skirts predominant in the
mid-town Manhattan skyscraper where they work.
   `When I was a boy,'' Rodrigues was saying the other day, ``all
the various races in Kenya lived and grew up and worked in isolation
of one another. After 10th grade, I went to Outward Bound. It was my
first opportunity to be together with people of different races and
backgrounds.
   ``One of my instructors was a British army officer. He kept
talking about this place called Sandhurst, the Royal Military
Academy. He told us only the best, the creme de la creme, could get
in.
   ``Here I was a kid from a colony, non-English. What chance had I?
But because of my Outward Bound experience I decided, hell, I think
I'll go. I knew it was up to me. So I went.''
   After an army tour and a stint with the United Nations fighting
famine, Rodrigues moved to New York. The notion of an urban Outward
Bound program fascinated him.
   ``I believe the urban backdrop has a much more exciting dynamic
to it than the wilderness,'' he says. ``The wilderness is
predictable. The mountains are always there, and the rivers.
   ``But the environment in the city is constantly changing. I
believe the challenges posed in the city are far greater.
   ``For every reason Outward Bound belongs in the wilderness, it
belongs here as well.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In celebrating his recent re-election, Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney spoke of a new Canada that is proud of
its abilities and ready to compete internationally. Indeed, the
United States' younger neighbor to the north seems to be shedding
its inferiority complex.

   Painfully slowly at times, a strong sense of
national pride and identity seems to be emerging in Canada.
   Canadian native Kate Nelligan recently appeared on stage here en
route to a bravura performance on Broadway in ``Spoils of War.''
   The actress was making her first professional appearance in
Canada after triumphs elsewhere, but she professed surprise that
anyone would find that quirky fact about her career interesting or
relevant.
   When a new owner purchased the Toronto Argonauts of the ailing
Canadian Football League, the local speculation was rampant that he
was interested not in the club but in the lease for the city's
spectacular new Skydome to bring in a National Football League
franchise.
   The sale terms finally were produced to show that he would not
have any such rights to the stadium even if the Argonauts folded.
   Canada, the world's second largest country, has its complexes.
   When Prime Minister Brian Mulroney emerged in his hometown of
Baie-Comeau, Quebec, for a resounding victory celebration after the
Nov. 21 election, he spoke of a new Canada that was proud of its
abilities and ready to compete internationally.
   By contrast, this is what Canadian media expert Marshall McLuhan,
who died in 1980, wrote to then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in
1968:
   ``Canada is the only country in the world that has never had a
national identity. In an age when all homogeneous nations are losing
their identity images through rapid technological change, Canada
alone can `keep its cool.''' The campaign was fought over such
issues of national identity and purpose, summed up in the question
of whether Canada should go ahead with the free-trade agreement with
the United States signed by Mulroney and President Reagan in January
1988.
   The election outcome with a second consecutive majority
government for Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party cleared the
way for the trade agreement.
   The election brought Canada an unusual amount of attention
internationally, something of a surprise to most Canadians who
routinely say their country is of only limited interest to the
world. It also served domestically as a rare episode of intensive
debate and soul-searching.
   Perhaps the greatest surprise was the pride both camps felt in
Canada.
   For Mulroney and the pro-free traders, Canada was a land of
competence and hard work, ready to take on competitors in the United
States without the protection of tariffs despite being outnumbered
nearly 10 to one.
   For anti-free traders, Canada was a caring country and unbridled
market forces _ seen here as being American _ could threaten its
traditions of generosity and protection for its people.
   No line brought greater applause to Liberal Party leader John
Turner, who ran a fervent campaign against the free trade agreement,
than when he roared: ``When you walk into a Canadian hospital, they
don't check your credit card before they check your pulse.''
   A certain smugness could be noted in Canadians running down their
list of concerns about too much contact with the United States, from
the cleanliness of Canadian cities and lower crime rates to their
belief that government exists to take care of and provide services
for its citizens.
   The ``L'' word for liberal that is buried so often in U.S.
politics is nothing to be feared in Canada. Indeed, the comparable
word game played here is to point out that the emphasis in
Progressive Conservative Party should be on progressive.
   Although free trade overwhelmed all other issues this fall, one
of the major controversies expected in the coming months is about
the government's role in providing child day-care.
   Writer and popular historian Pierre Berton believes geography and
history have created a firm identity in Canada and too much has been
made of a national inferiority complex.

   ``We are a different kind of people than the Americans,'' he said
in an interview, adding that he opposed the free-trade agreement
because of its potential threat to national identity and culture.
   Peter Newman, a senior columnist for the national news weekly
Maclean's, said the fall election was the most heated race in
generations and predicted that its impact will linger.
   ``What we already have is a very precious thing,'' he said in a
phone interview from British Columbia. ``We like what we have here,
and we want to keep it.''
   The youthfulness of Canadian institutions plays a key role in
national perceptions.
   The nation dates to 1867 when its four original provinces joined,
but British colonial institutions lingered far longer. The maple
leaf flag was adopted in 1964, and the last vestiges of colonial
status were eliminated with the passage of the Constitution Act of
1982.
   The conference room at the Ottawa headquarters of Heritage
Canada, a national, non-profit organization formed with government
support in 1973, is decorated with paintings from each of the
country's regions.
   The scenes are impressive and picturesque, from an ornate
courtyard in the city of Quebec to a small town in Ontario to homes
built during the Gold Rush in the Yukon's Dawson City.
   ``Let us celebrate our diversity,'' Constance Johnson, the
organization's spokeswoman, cheerfully told a visitor. ``But it
sounds more like coping _ at the moment we're not quite ready to
celebrate.''
   Canadians like to emphasize that they chose instead of the
American-style melting pot to retain a cultural mosaic, adding in
dozens of immigrant societies to the basic English and French
differences and their persistent tensions.
   There also is great interest in the vast, sparsely populated
northern portions of Canada as a contributor to national identity.
   ``Few have seen the cliffs of Baffin or the eskers of the tundra
but we all live cheek by jowl with the wilderness; and all of us, I
think, feel the empty and awesome presence of the North,'' Berton
wrote in his book, ``Why We Act like Canadians.''
   The bulk of the Canadian population of 26 million lives in cities
and towns stretched from the Atlantic coastal provinces to British
Columbia on the Pacific, most not more than 200 miles from the U.S.
border.
   With or without the free-trade agreement, the $150 billion annual
exchange between Canada and the United States already is remarkable
as the largest two-way trading relationship in the world.
   Each is the other's No. 1 trading partner, but Canadians complain
that they are ignored by the United States and expect that to happen
again now that the uproar over free trade has subsided.
   ``I think the Americans will overlook us, as they always do,''
Newman said. ``Unless you make some noise, they just take it for
granted.''
   Canadian economic growth, fueled by trade _ mostly with the
United States _has lasted and at times boomed during the past six
years.
   The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development says growth was 4.25 percent for 1988, trailing only
Japan's 5.75 percent growth rate among the Group of Seven industrial
democracies. The forecast was for a decline to 3 percent growth in
1989.
   The government's Statistics Canada found that Canadians' standard
of living was 90 percent of that in the United States through much
of this decade.
   The economist John Kenneth Galbraith, a native Canadian who left
to go to graduate school more than half a century ago, once wrote
that Canada has nothing to fear from too much trade with the United
States.
   ``The American influence is there, no-one can doubt, but it is a
fact of geography, not trade,'' he wrote in the 100th anniversary
edition of the monthly Saturday Night magazine. ``Those Canadians
who really fear American influence should insist on another location
_ it is what one also tells the Poles.''

   Here are some facts at-a-glance about Canada and the new
free-trade agreement with the United States:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CANADA _ The nation of 26 million people is the world's second
largest in territory, spanning seven time zones. It has 10
provinces, the most populous being English-speaking Ontario, trailed
by French-speaking Quebec, and two territories. The economy has
grown steadily since the recession of 1981-82.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE TRADING PARTNERS _ Canada and the United States already are
each other's largest trading partner. The annual exchange of $150
billion makes it the largest two-nation trading partnership in the
world.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE AGREEMENT _ U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney signed the agreement Jan. 2, 1988. It eliminates any
remaining tariffs between the countries over a 10-year period,
dismantles many investment barriers, frees up trade in energy and
services, and creates Canadian-U.S. panels to settle disputes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOCIAL PROGRAMS _ Domestic opponents of the agreement charge that
Canadian social programs such as medicare, unemployment insurance
and pensions ultimately will be affected by the need to compete on
an equal footing. Supporters maintain social programs are unaffected
by the agreement and protected by international trade law.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EMPLOYMENT _ Supporters forecast as many as 250,000 new jobs in
Canada during the first 10 years of the agreement. Opponents charge
that Canada would pay too high a price under the agreement for a
relatively small number of lower-paying jobs in the service sector
that would be created by increased trade.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES _ The United States would gain
non-discriminatory access to Canadian energy supplies. Opponents
argue this could lead to Canada losing control of its vast energy,
water and other natural resources and being reduced to a source of
raw materials for the U.S. market. Supporters maintain the agreement
means Canadian energy exports will no longer face the future threat
of U.S. trade sanctions that could limit sales and that Canada still
would control its resources in the event of shortages.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE FUTURE _ Opponents of the trade agreement paint a grim
picture of Canada losing control of its economic future and say
political sovereignty could suffer as a result of the agreement.
They say Canada already is too dependent on the United States as a
customer and should develop markets in other countries instead.
Supporters say access to the larger U.S. market must be guaranteed
to ensure future Canadian prosperity. They argue that without the
agreement Canada risks becoming an isolated international backwater,
the smallest industrial nation without participation in a larger
trading bloc.

   The forces that fought the free-trade agreement
with the United States say they have no intention of giving up on
the issue despite their election loss to Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney.
   ``There is a continuing trade agenda before us,'' Tony Clark,
director of the Pro-Canada Network, said in an interview. ``I think
it boils down to how much more political and economic depending can
Canada take on the greatest economic power in the world.''
   The coalition of some 20 national organizations, including church
groups, environmentalists and women's groups, was formed in 1987 to
battle the trade agreement.
   Its publicity, especially a comic book outlining the trade
issues, was among the most visible during the campaign that ended
Nov. 21 with a majority government for Mulroney's Progressive
Conservative Party.
   That cleared the way for the trade agreement he signed in January
1988 with U.S. President Ronald Reagan to proceed, but the opponents
plan to keep dramatizing the changes they believe it will force on
Canada.
   Clarke said the activist groups that form the anti-free trade
coalition met again after the election and pledged to continue ``for
what we call the long haul'' of at least the next four or five years.
   ``There was credible commitment and resolve to continue,'' he
said.
   The greatest concern during the campaign focused on the impact
that the trade agreement could have on Canada's more extensive
network of health and social programs.
   The anti-free traders plan to put the spotlight on any incidents
in which they believe the government backs away from its pledge that
programs won't be affected.
   Also getting attention will be any workers who lose their jobs as
a result of the trade agreement.
   The supporters of free trade forecast a net increase of as many
as 250,000 jobs over 10 years, but concede that some plants will be
closing as business and industry restructures to serve a wider North
American market.
   Many of the questions about what constitutes government subsidies
remain to be decided in U.S.-Canadian negotiations over the next
several years.
   ``The battle is not over,'' Mel Hurtig, publisher of ``The
Canadian Encyclopedia'' and a vocal opponent of the agreement, said
in a phone interview from Edmonton, Alberta. ``We consider that
we're bloodied and bruised, but we've only lost one major battle in
the war.''
   The majority government that Mulroney won means there won't be
another election for about four years, but anti-free traders predict
that the issue once again will be the dominant one in the next
campaign.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Its graduates include include some of the biggest
names in beer _ Stroh, Busch, Pabst. Indeed, training for a career
in beer is what Siebel Institute of Technology is all about.
Breweries from around the world send aspiring brewmasters to the
Chicago school of suds where quaffing on the campus is not against
the rules.

   Hoist a frothy stein to Siebel Institute of
Technology _ Brewmaster U. _ where all the students strive for
better beer.
   ``I would call it the Harvard of the brewmaster schools,'' says
recent graduate James Whilt Timper of Belleville, Ill.
   Since 1901, excluding Prohibition of course, the Siebel Institute
has been turning out many of the world's brewmasters, who create the
beer that's quaffed at the corner tap.
   ``The people at Siebel's have my highest admiration. It's unique
in the country,'' says Michael Lewis, a professor of brewing science
at the University of California-Davis.
   And the graduation pictures that hang on the second floor carry
some of the biggest names in suds: John W. Stroh Jr., class of '59;
August A. Busch III, class of '61; August Pabst, class of '67.
   Siebel Institute is an arm of J.E. Siebel Sons' Co., whose roots
date to 1868 when the city of Chicago's chief chemist, a husky
German immigrant with a flowing beard, started a small laboratory to
introduce European brewing techniques to the United States.
   The North Side lab, a few feet from the screeching wheels of
elevated commuter trains, moved downtown after World War II, and
then to its current site among large homes and small industries
Chicago's far Northwest Side in the 1950s.
   In the basement, staff scientists have their own micro-brewery,
which produces 22 liters of beer a few times a month for research
purposes.
   The two-story, brick building modestly bears the name Siebel over
the entrance, giving no hint to passersby that the great-grandsons
of J.E. Siebel Sr. are now at the helm of a company that trains
brewmasters and acts as a consultant to breweries big and small,
from Guatemala to Detroit, Canada to India.
   Each fall, Siebel Institute accepts 25 to 30 students for an
11-week course in ``brewing technology.'' Most are employees of
breweries around the world sent to Chicago for classroom and
laboratory training and then promoted to brewmaster or assistant
brewmaster when they return.
   All expenses _ tuition, hotel and food _ are normally paid by the
student's brewery.
   The $5,650 course is divided into eight subjects: raw materials,
brewhouse theory, fermentation, storage, packaging, quality control,
laboratory and taste.
   While there are many brewing academies in Europe, especially West
Germany, the Siebel Institute has few peers in the United States.
The University of California-Davis offers undergraduate degrees in
food science with an emphasis on brewing, but the Chicago school
says it's the only one that takes people from inside the industry
and turns them into brewmasters.
   The school accepts few students who do not have a brewing
background, though some with a ``fair amount of self-study and high
degree of determination'' can get through the door, says Executive
Vice President William R. Siebel.
   ``What they're taught here is the theory and the science behind
malt beverages, from the various raw materials to their ultimate use
in the brewhouse,'' says Siebel, who can't recall anyone who didn't
pass the course. ``We're not teaching any specific formulas to make
certain beers. At their breweries, they use their own formulas. The
art is learned on the job.''
   To the armchair drinker, a beer occasionally might taste bad. But
at Siebel Institute, students are taught to determine if a beer
tastes fruity, skunky, burnt or grainy.
   It's not all work. During lunch or after classes, students are
usually found in the second-floor ``bierstube'' where they quiz each
other about the day's lessons or play pool, while eating snacks and
downing mugs of free beer, compliments of big-name beer companies.
   ``When you get a student from Tasmanian,'' says Siebel, referring
to an Australian brewery, ``and a novice from California, they're
going to pick up all kinds of insights.
   ``They're talking beer all the time.''
   Cynthia L. Bauer has worked at a Stroh Brewery plant in Van Nuys,
Calif., for four years and was recently promoted to assistant
brewmaster.
   Beer, she says, is a language everyone understands.
   ``You can talk about beer to anybody; I'm not talking about
high-tech lasers,'' she says. ``On the other hand, it's very
scientific. There are 1,000 different ways to skin a cat and 1,000
different ways to make beer. That's why we're here.''
   Ms. Bauer, 28, was one of two women who graduated in the
most-recent class. Does she feel like a pioneer in an industry
dominated by men?
   ``What's your image of a brewmaster?'' she replies. ``An old guy
with a bit of a belly. Well, these guys are retiring, moving on.
Granted there are not too many women, but we'll make it.''
   Unlike most of his classmates, Timper, 31, is unemployed and
simply wants to get his foot back into the business. He was a
production worker at Stag Brewery in Southern Illinois, but it
closed a few months ago and Timper was not transferred.
   He had to borrow money for the Siebel tuition.
   ``I had a choice: stand in a long, unruly unemployment line or be
a student,'' Timper says. ``Siebel is considered a very good
steppingstone to further a career or start one. It has the market
cornered. This whole thing is a gamble I needed to take.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The insular American has a lot to learn. When he
confronts a foreigner he might find to his astonishment that they
are literally oceans apart. Simple gestures, ordinary habits might
be offensive to others. Here's a military school that teaches how to
edit your body language.

   The best advice to Americans abroad
is to keep your hands in your pockets, lest you be gravely
misundstood.
   For instance, a thumbs up might mean ``OK'' or ``right on'' to
you, but it's an obscene gesture in the Middle East.
   And the ``A-okay'' sign of the forefinger and thumb in a circle
can get you into all kinds of trouble. It means money in Japan. But
in France it means you think someone is a ``zero'' and in Malta,
heaven forfend, it's an invitation to have homosexual sex.
   Goodness knows how they might take a ``high five.''
   That's why Capt. Mike Rafferty has his hands full teaching a
cross-cultural communications course at this Air Force base in the
Florida Panhandle. He's trying to avoid misunderstandings when
American servicemen teach foreign military personnel the intricacies
of U.S. military equipment and procedures.
   Just when you want to deliver a compliment to a foreign student,
you might be picking a fight.
   The five-day course is taught at the Air Force Special Operations
School. The school also offers more specific courses for personnel
being sent to particular parts of the world such as Latin America or
Africa, but Rafferty's class gives troops an insight into cultural
differences around the world.
   For instance, patting children on the head may be a sign of
endearment to an American, but in some Asian cultures, where the top
of the head is considered the home of the soul, it's an insult.
   ``In most other cultures the development has been different,''
Rafferty says, noting many have changed little over thousands of
years. ``In the United States the emphasis is on individual rights.
In other cultures it's the survival of the group that's important.''
   This difference shows up in the classroom. Individualistic
Americans are taught to ask questions, figure things out for
themselves and that their instructors don't know everything, says
Rafferty, who hails from Stockton, Calif.
   In many non-Western countries, students learn by rote and don't
ask questions or admit they failed to understand something because
they don't want to be considered different from the rest of the
group.
   ``We have a saying in this country that `the squeaky wheel gets
the grease,''' Rafferty says. ``In Asia, the saying is `The nail
that stands up gets hammered down.'''
   The individual competitiveness of Americans is one of the first
things foreign students notice, Rafferty says. They often see it as
a negative factor that takes away from the importance of the group.
   Other countries tend to stress group competition, perhaps refined
to an ultimate by the Japanese, Rafferty says.
   The group emphasis also makes the family more significant in many
countries. In the Middle East, for example, elders are respected,
revered and sought out for advice.
   Time and space are other important differences.
   In Arabian, African and Latin American countries, arriving 30
minutes or more after a meeting was scheduled to start may be
considered ``on time,'' while in the United States it would be
insulting to show up so late, Rafferty says. On the other hand, a
Swiss-German would get there early.
   While Americans feel uncomfortable when others invade their
space, many foreigners, particularly Arabs and Latin Americans, like
to get up close and personal.
   When that happens to an American at a social function with
foreigners he is likely to back away, but the foreigner again will
close the gap, Rafferty says.
   ``There's a little dance that goes on,'' he says.
   Same-sex touching also is common in the Middle East and Asia,
where it has none of the sexual connotation it has in America.
   Rafferty recalls a personal experience. When attending the
Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery,
Ala., he was good friends with an officer from Thailand. They played
on the same soccer team.
   While dressed in their soccer shorts they were sitting in the
stands and talking when the visitor reached over and put his hand on
Rafferty's bare thigh.
   ``That was real uncomfortable for me,'' Rafferty says.
``Everybody in the stands behind me was laughing, but it wasn't a
problem.''
   Americans also don't like too much direct eye contact,
particularly between men and women. Hispanics and Arabs, who share
some cultural similarities because of the 700-year Moorish
occupation of Spain, like eye contact.
   ``They feel they can tell a lot about an individual if they can
look into his eyes,'' Rafferty says.
   Some foreigners get into trouble in the United States when
strangers interpret their stares as a challenge, he says.
   Foreigners and Americans often have stereotyped views of each
other that are untrue.
   The most commonly held view of the United States is that it is
the great melting pot. As a result, some foreign visitors are
surprised when they discover exceptions to racial, ethnic and sexual
equality, Rafferty says.
   Often, foreigners try to bridge the gap by dressing and acting
like Americans, but that can be misleading.
   ``We tend to think, `He looks like us, he must think like us,
too,' '' Rafferty says. ``That's a big, big mistake.''

   Don Knotts has been reunited with his old pal
Andy Griffith on television and you might notice a little of Barney
Fife in his new role.
   Knotts honed his familiar characterization from his earliest days
in television, when he was the tense little man on ``The Steve Allen
Show.'' He twitches and fidgets and speaks in a voice that rises in
nervous inflections.
   Then in the 1960s on ``The Andy Griffith Show'' he won five Emmys
as Deputy Barney Fife, the bumbling lawman with childish pretensions
and a nervous tic. The character got another incarnation as Ralph
Furley, the bombastic landlord on ``Three's Company.''
   Now, Knotts, who first teamed with Griffith in ``No Time for
Sergeants'' on Broadway and in the film, is back with Griffith in
NBC's ``Matlock.'' He plays Les Calhoun, a retiree and
self-described ``king of plastics,'' who moves in next door to Ben
Matlock, the crime-solving Southern lawyer played by Griffith.
Calhoun is a man frequently in trouble because of his inability to
leave well enough alone.
   Knotts, in person, displays none of the hilarious and sometimes
exasperating mannerisms. His voice is soft and his manner is almost
courtly.
   ``It sure is fun to work with Andy again,'' he says. ``In the
first show we had a chance to sit down and do some of the things we
used to do in `The Andy Griffith Show.' Just talk. That was real fun.
   ``I try to keep him different from Barney, but some of it'll
creep in. Working with Andy it's hard to stay away from it. And I
don't know that I should stay totally away.''
   Knotts and Griffith had last worked together three years ago in
the NBC movie ``Return to Mayberry,'' a reunion of the gang from
``The Andy Griffith Show.''
   ``I got a call from Andy in North Carolina last summer during the
writers strike,'' Knotts says. ``He said he'd been talking to the
producers about working me into the show. I thought he was kidding.
But he wanted to add something to the show. He kept calling.
   ``I was in Traverse City, Mich., doing a play. He called me again
after the strike was over and said we need to talk business. And I
realized then that he really meant business. I wasn't sure.''
   When Knotts got home from doing the play the first script had
already been written.
   ``It went through a lot of rewriting,'' he says. ``People don't
realize it but Andy does a lot of rewriting. The stuff we had talked
about he made sure got in there.''
   Knotts quit ``The Andy Griffith Show'' at the end of five years,
but returned regularly for guest appearances.
   ``Andy said he was going to leave after five years, so I said I
would, too,'' he recalls. ``Universal offered me a picture deal. I
left, but Andy changed his mind and stayed. I spent five years at
Universal doing one picture a year. Then I did my variety show on
NBC but it didn't do very well. It did go the full season, and after
that I free-lanced. I sort of wound up with a picture contract at
Disney. They guaranteed me a picture a year.''
   Then came five years on ABC's ``Three's Company.'' He also did
half a season as the school principal on the syndicated comedy
``What a Country!''
   Knotts grew up in Morgantown, W. Va., where he was called
``Spider'' because of his wiry build and excelled in basketball and
wrestling. He was attending the University of West Virginia when he
was drafted during World War II.
   He was in the Army show ``Stars and Stripes'' and toured the
South Pacific with a comedy act. After the war he returned to get
his degree and do postgraduate work at the University of Arizona.
   But he was soon in New York doing radio.
   ``I played the old-timer on a Western series,'' he says. ``I
borrowed Gabby Hayes's voice and the guys used to kid me about it.
One day Gabby visited the studio and the guys set me up. I was
rehearsing and he burst through the door and gave me hell for using
his voice. I was scared to death. Then everybody started laughing.''

   Tony Lo Bianco gives casting directors, not to
mention audiences, fits.
   Most can't quite remember what he looks like or where they saw
him before. They have seen him as young and old, short and tall,
skinny and fat.
   He has played gangsters, prizefighters, communists, cowboys,
policemen, soldiers in ancient Rome, longshoremen, psychopaths,
baseball players and scores of others in productions by everybody
from Eugene O'Neill to Sylvester Stallone.
   After critics raved about his performance as the hot-headed Eddie
Carbone in the 1983 Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's ``A View
from the Bridge,'' he was offered a lot roles as tough Italian
fathers. Now he's bracing for a different kind of part.
   ``I'll probably get a slew of short, fat roles,'' Lo Bianco says.
   The reason?
   The actor is starring in ``Hizzoner!,'' a one-man show based on
the life of New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and currently on view
at Broadway's Longacre Theater.
   ``Now they'll say, `Tony has gone to pot,''' the 52-year-old Lo
Bianco says. ```He's gotten fat.'''
   And shorter, too.
   The 5-foot-9 Lo Bianco, a one-time Golden Glover, plays the
5-foot-3 LaGuardia without losing an inch.
   ``I do it smaller on stage,'' the actor laughs. ``That's the fun
of it. You can appear to shrink.''
   The actor did gain a little weight for the show. But then, he has
also taken off pounds if the role demanded it.
   ``You have to move your body around to conform to what you're
going to play,'' Lo Bianco says. ``As an actor, you should be a
marshmallow or a piece of sponge. You've got to push your face and
body around to pay tribute to the script and the character someone
wrote.''
   LaGuardia, a non-stop worker, was one of New York's best-known
and most colorful mayors. During his three terms in office, from
1934 through 1945, he followed fire trucks to fires, read the
funnies over the radio when there was a newspaper strike, supervised
many large building projects, including what came to be known as
LaGuardia Airport, and even balanced the city's budget.
   The difficulty with playing LaGuardia, who died in 1947, is that
many people still remember the way he looked and the way he talked.
Not only from their own memories, but from newsreels, old radio
programs and even Tom Bosley's Tony award-winning portrayal of him
in the 1959 musical ``Fiorello.''
   ``Hizzoner!,'' which was written by Paul Shyre, has been in the
works since 1983 when it was commissioned by a New York public
television station. Shyre thought of Lo Bianco for the role. The two
men had known each other since they worked together in Harold
Clurman's acting classes.
   It was decided to do ``Hizzoner!'' on stage first, so the play
had several incarnations over the years at regional theaters in
Albany and Syracuse before making the trip to New York.
   The refinement of the play became a selection process.
   ``You're dealing with a man who was mayor for 12 years and a
congressman for seven terms, so there's a lot to talk about,'' Lo
Bianco says.
   ``We wanted to give an understanding of why this man accomplished
what he accomplished and what in his background made him think the
way he did. What triggered things that made him be the kind of human
being he was _ a tremendously honest and caring human being, in the
true sense, a public servant. In all the books and all the stories
I've read about him, I find no dark shadow in his closet.''
   Lo Bianco's research took him to the LaGuardia archives in Queens
to pore over their material and photographs to capture the man's
expressions. He read books about the man as well as LaGuardia's
autobiography, ``The Insurgent.''
   Still, it took the actor a while to decide to do the role. He
worried about not only having to capture the man's physical
mannerisms but the sound of his voice as well.
   He would practice the voice every day at home. One day, when his
wife came home she thought there was an intruder in the apartment.
It was Lo Bianco, changing into the character.
   Now, before each performance, Lo Bianco listens to various tape
recordings of LaGuardia's voice to keep in tune with his cadence and
the high pitch of his voice.
   What sold him on the role was the man himself.
   ``He was a human being who cared,'' Lo Bianco says. ``That kind
of battler I love.''
   The play begins on LaGuardia's last day in the mayor's office and
flashes backward to his youth, to his days as a lawyer and a
congressman when he upset the corrupt Democratic machine and won
election as a Republican, and finally to his election as mayor.
   The Brooklyn-born Lo Bianco doesn't remember LaGuardia but
remembers his father, a taxi driver, remembering LaGuardia. The
actor recalls his parents' romanticized stories of the tough times
during the Depression and at the center of these troubles was
LaGuardia. Now, his own passion for the man is just as fierce.
   ``It's a cause,'' the actor says. ``I don't look at doing this
play as just doing a play. It's more than that to me. What LaGuardia
stood for _ truth, honesty and no corruption _ is something that we
should all aspire to live in our lives. He almost never leaves me. I
feel it's as exciting for me to play the role as it was for him to
be mayor.''

<TEXT>
   After 13 years of war, peace is a step
closer in Angola and if it comes the nation's economic prospects
could be one of the brightest in Africa.
   A prolonged period of peace and stable government holds the
promise of undreamed of prosperity for a people who have known only
conflict and hardship since winning independence from Portugal in
1975.
   Angola has abundant reserves of oil, iron ore and diamonds _ many
of them untapped _ and a rich soil that could turn it into a
breadbasket of Africa. It is about twice the size of Texas but has a
population of only 8.9 million, just a million or so more than New
York City.
   But since independence and the installation of a Marxist
government, the country has been embroiled in guerrilla warfare that
has made development and exploitation of many of its natural
resources, particularly agriculture, difficult if not impossible.
   Rene Pellisier, a French authority on Angola and author of
several books on the country, describes the nation's mineral wealth
as ``truly astonishing,'' and says it ``should insure a viable
economy, provided that the country can find investment, technical
skill and can recover its internal peace.''
   Even before independence, Angola had been disrupted by an
anti-Portuguese guerrilla war since 1961. In 1975, the
anti-Portuguese guerrilla organizations split along ideological
lines. The Marxist Angolan Popular Liberation Movement took power in
Luanda and the pro-Western National Union for Total Independence of
Angola, also known as UNITA, went into the bush to fight.
   The Marxist government won the support of the Soviet Union, which
has provided military supplies and advisers, and Cuba, which sent in
troops. UNITA's main support came from the United States and South
Africa.
   The war has reached a virtual stalemate, and on Dec. 22, Angola,
Cuba and South Africa agreed to a phased withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban
troops. In exchange, South Africa agreed to grant independence to
Namibia on Angola's southern border.
   UNITA has vowed to continue its fight but there are signs of
negotiations that could bring an internal settlement.
   Should peace come and stable government take hold, the way will
be open for Angola to prosper as few other African nations can.
   Angola's oil sector is the largest in sub-Saharan Africa after
Nigeria, and conservative estimates put known reserves at 1.84
billion barrels.
   The 375,000 barrels a day pumped mainly by an Angolan-U.S.
consortium off the Cabinda enclave near the mouth of the Congo River
account for 90 percent of Angola's export earnings.
   Under the Portuguese, Angola exported 5 to 8 percent of the
world's diamond production and was Africa's second-largest coffee
producer.
   Proven reserves of a billion tons of high-grade hematite iron ore
remain in the Cassinga mines in southern Angola where invading South
African forces turned much of the area into a no-man's land.
   Diplomats and international aid officials say that with the
signing Dec. 22 of agreements by Angola, Cuba and South Africa, a
fresh start could be at hand.
   ``We're hoping that people who have seen Angola as a no-go
proposition will come here and see some optimism,'' said Kieran J.
O'Cuneen, head of the European Economic Community's development
program, the largest in Angola.
   Foreign experts, government officials and local expatriate
entrepreneurs all recognize that the obstacles to development are
enormous. Peace in the countryside and production centers is
considered imperative if reconstruction is to begin.
   UNITA is not party to the December agreements, in which the
United States played a third-party role, says it will not lay down
its arms until the Marxist government of President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos in Luanda agrees to meet at the negotiating table.
   The United States, which conditions its recognition of dos
Santo's government on a settlement with UNITA and the complete
withdrawal of Cuban troops, still is giving UNITA $15 million a year
in military aid.
   South Africa says it stopped its aid to UNITA following the
December accords. But Angola's defense minister, Pedro Maria Tonha,
claims South African supplies continue to arrive at UNITA bases in
the southeastern part of the country.
   The Cuban troops are to be out of Angola by July 1991. As of Jan.
15, about 3,000 had left the country.
   Dos Santos recently called for a cease-fire with UNITA and has
offered a year-long amnesty beginning Feb. 4.
   But the 52-year-old Moscow-educated petroleum engineer says UNITA
leader Jonas Savimbi, portrayed by some as a pro-Western crusader
against the Marxist government, is a special case and must be dealt
with separately.
   In early January, before his inauguration, President Bush wrote
to Savimbi assuring him of continued U.S. support. President Kenneth
Kaunda of Zambia called on Bush to offer political asylum to the
54-year-old UNITA chief, who enjoys strong conservative backing in
the U.S. Congress.
   Outside experts say neither side can hope for a clear victory.
   Continued clashes between the two sides since mid-January have
claimed a reported 200 lives.
   Foreign aid officials say the threat of continued UNITA attacks
prevents them from making surveys to determine how much money will
be needed to underwrite key projects, such as the rehabilitation of
the Lobito corridor.
   The corridor includes the strategic Benguela railway running from
the Atlantic port of Lobito into the heart of Africa and the copper
mines of neighboring Zaire and Zambia.
   Most of the 809-mile railroad has been out of commission for
years because of blown up bridges, track damage and a lack of
security.
   European Economic Community officials said following an aid-donor
conference Jan. 26-27b in Luanda on the Lobito corridor that $20
million had been earmarked for the project, whose final cost is
estimated at $600 million.
   Angola, which is expected to join the United Nations-affiliated
International Monetary Fund in June, has a $4-billion foreign debt,
three-quarters of it to the Soviet Union, mainly for military
equipment and salaries to Soviet advisers.
   The IMF is expected to demand at least a 100 percent devaluation
of Angola's currency, the kwanza, as a condition for membership. But
such a move could throw into turmoil the vital but fragile local
business structure, much of it run by foreigners with assests in
black market kwanzas.
   Since independence the official value of the kwanza has been
pegged at 29.62 to the dollar, but the black market rate of 2,200 is
the common denominator in nearly all unofficial transactions.
   Fighting in the countryside has disrupted agricultural production
and distribution. The only way to get agricultural produce to Luanda
from the relatively unscathed southwestern corner of the country is
by weekly boat from the port of Namibe.
   Once an exporter of food, Angola received 187,000 tons of
emergency food aid in 1987-88.
   Since the internal guerrilla war broke out in 1975, more than 60
percent of what Angola spends on imports has been for military
supplies.
   Not much has been left to invest in infrastructure, education,
health care and agricultural and industrial development.

<HEAD>West Germany Ready for New Economic Ties with Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German leaders have declared a new
readiness to improve economic ties with Poland. But the German help
for the beleaguered nation hinges on settlement of emotional issues
smoldering since World War II.
   During a recent visit to Bonn by Premier Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski
of Poland, Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced that it was his
``political goal'' to visit Poland this year _ the 50th anniversary
of the invasion of Poland by Adolf Hitler's troops, which began
World War II.
   Officials said President Richard von Weizsaecker of West Germany
could also visit Poland this year, perhaps on the Sept. 1, the day
in 1939 that the Germans invased.
   Weizsaecker, a respected statesman known for his eloquent calls
for West Germans to face up to the Nazi past, served as an
infantryman in the invading army.
   Aides to Weizsaecker say the president believes such a visit
would be an ``important symbolic gesture'' of reconciliation that
could cap efforts begun by Willy Brandt, the former socialist
chancellor who in 1970 knelt in penance before the memorial to
victims of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.
   During his visit to Bonn, Rakowski made it clear Poland wants
economic help in return for concessions on several long-standing
disputes.
   He appealed to government and industry leaders for ``concrete
support and understanding'' in decreasing Poland's $39-billion
foreign debt.
   Relations between Warsaw and Bonn have stagnated in recent years,
in large part because of Poland's economic decline and intransigence
on both sides in dealing with the ethnic and legal legacy of
Germany's loss of terrorities after its defeat in World War II.
   Lack of movement in Polish relations has been a nagging foreign
policy disappointment for Kohl's coalition government, which has
built on earlier agreements with other East European countries and
considerably expanded its political, economic and cultural ties in
the region.
   The human suffering and devastation inflicted on Poland during
the war and the forced expulsion of thousands of Germans from East
Prussia and other territories after 1945 also continues to haunt
relations. East Prussia is now part of Poland and the Soviet Union.
   ``There are many on both sides who still harbor a deep sense of
bitterness and mistrust,'' said Eberhard Schulz, an expert on West
German-Polish affairs with the Bonn-based German Foreign Policy
Institute.
   ``Because of our history, our (postwar) relations with Poland
have always been a delicate matter,'' said Claus Wunderlich, a
spokesman for the West German Foreign Ministry.
   Kohl's chief foreign policy adviser, Horst Teltschik, has been
assigned to meet with Polish leaders to clear the way for the
chancellor's visit.
   Financial officials will work on a package of economic aid to
help rescue Poland's deteriorating economy, and representatives of
other Bonn ministries will try to resolve cultural and ethnic
issues, government sources said.
   In return, West Germany wants Warsaw to acknowledge the existence
of an ethnic German minority in Poland and to allow its members to
keep their heritage alive.
   Bonn also wants Polish leaders to allow official documents such
as birth certificates to list both the Polish and former German
names of cities in terrorities ceded to Poland after the war.
   The documents issue goes to the heart of a tangled postwar legal
legacy that has preoccupied Bonn and irritated Warsaw.
   Under the terms of a 1970 treaty, West Germany renounced its
claim to vast tracts of former German territory incorporated into
Poland at the end of the war.
   The treaty also recognized Poland's western border with communist
East Germany.
   However, the West German Parliament in a joint declaration two
years later emphasized that the treaty created no legal basis for
the borders.
   The nation's constitutional court later upheld the declaration
and ruled that Germany's 1937 boundaries still applied in
determining legal issues such as citizenship and claims against the
former German Reich.
   It also forms the legal foundation for possible future border
realignment discussions in the event Germany is one day reunited.
   The decision angered the Polish government at the time and
remains a sore point, although the West German government has
repeatedly stated that territorial claims agreed to in the treaty
are not at issue.
   Under Kohl's conservative leadership, Bonn officials have taken
great pains to assuage those suspicions, and Bonn officials say
Rakowski's government has signaled that most of these disputes can
be settled. The spokesman for the Polish Foreign Ministry, Stefan
Staniszewski, said in late January that ``issues which have been
open until now will be solved.''
   But West German officials say privately that coming up with an
acceptable economic package in return will be difficult.
   While the West German government has indicated its readiness to
work out new debt restructuring agreements with Poland, finance
officials say they are not eager to risk massive new credits.
   Warsaw is having trouble repaying a 1-billion-mark ($546-million)
credit made in 1975 and wants West Germany to agree to repayment in
zlotys, the Polish currency, which could be used for new German
projects in Poland.
   Meanwhile, West German officials are working to avoid the
suggestion of a potentially embarrassing linkage between symbolic
gestures of conciliation during the anniversary year and financial
assistance to Warsaw, which the respected Frankfurt Allgemeine
newspaper bluntly described as ``reconciliation in exchange for the
influx of capital.''
   ``Our relations with Poland are far too complex to reduce them to
the one-dimensional contention that we will only achieve
improvements with a fat check in our hand,'' said Foreign Minstry
spokesman Wunderlich.
   But government officials believe Bonn's economic clout carries
almost overwhelming leverage in gaining concessions.
   ``In the final sober analysis,'' said one, ``they need us more
now than we need them.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Pelle the Conqueror''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Scandanavians are unsurpassed at filming epic dramas against
the harsh beauty of northern landscapes. Ingmar Bergman has proved
the master of such films. Other contributions have included Jan
Troell's ``The Emigrants'' and ``The New Land'' (about Swedish
farmers in Minnesota), Bo Wilderberg's ``Elvira Madigan'' and last
year's Academy Award winner, ``Babette's Feast.''
   Now ``Pelle the Conqueror'' joins that select group. Written and
directed with rare skill by Danish filmmaker Bille August, it is an
impressive achievement, austere yet reachable, sorrowful but
elevating for the soul. The film displays Max Von Sydow at the peak
of his talent. It's hard to imagine any of the world's actors
performing the role with such conviction.
   ``Pelle the Conqueror'' (a confusing title suggesting Arnold
Schwarzenwegger in loincloth) is based on the first volume of the
famed saga by Martin Andersen Nexo. The story is told through the
eyes of Pelle (Pelle Hvenegaard), a subteen Swedish boy who
accompanies his widower father, Lasse (Max Von Sydow), on a perilous
adventure early in the century, seeking a new life in the Danish
farm country.
   Their arrival portends the grimness of their future. The farm
owners hire able-bodied immigrants, dismissing Lasse as too old and
his son as too young. Finally the brutal manager of the Stone Farm
agrees to take on the pair.
   Pelle finds his new home both thrilling and forbidding. Like most
outsiders, he is reviled and beaten by his schoolmates. But he is
intrigued by drama all around him: the free spirit who challenges
the foreman and pays for it; the womanizing landowner who is
periodically tainted by the mother of his out-of-wedlock child; the
long-suffering landowner's wife who bestows kindness on Pelle and
savage retribution on her husband.
   The boy also watches with growing sorrow his father's frustration
with his mean existence. Every hope that Lasse uncovers turns to
dust. When he finds a woman who could make a home for him and the
boy, her husband, believed lost at sea, returns. Despairing of his
luck and ashamed of his cowardice, he turns to drink.
   This brief resume might sound depressing, but ``Pelle the
Conqueror'' isn't. August's script is laden with surprises, some
funny, some thrilling, and his camera captures the raw grandeur of
the Danish countryside.
   Von Sydow has never performed more impressively. His Lasse is
downtrodden yet somehow noble, a man befuddled by his inability to
make a better life for himself and his son. Young Hvenegaard, who
never acted before, is miraculous; his bright face mirrors the
wondrous things he sees.
   Released in this country by Mirimax Films, ``Pelle the
Conqueror'' is subtitled in English. There is no rating. Running
time: 138 minutes.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Defense of the Realm,'' ``Monkey
Shines.''
   
   ``Defense of the Realm'' (Nelson Home Entertainment. VHS-Beta.
Rated R)
   
   Like ``The Whistleblower,'' an equally tidy little thriller,
``Defense of the Realm'' is long on atmosphere. It's worth the
rental if only to see how a Another Western Democracy has its own
dirty obsessions with state secrets.
   Gabriel Byrne plays the reporter who tumbles to the Big Story
after an old sot of a colleague (Denholm Elliott) stumbles onto it
first and dies mysteriously, apparently for a secret the shadow
government thinks is worth killing him to protect.
   It's effective to see the young reporter start to pull at the
ends of the story until a strand works loose, then put the strands
of the story together until finally ...
   Ah, but that would be telling, eh?
   Some might fault the movie's abrupt ending, but let's admonish
these curmudgeonly souls with the old '60s epigram: ``It ain't
paranoia if they really are out to get you.''

   ``Monkey Shines'' (Orion Home Video. VHS-Beta. Rated R)
   
   ``There's something ... unnatural about you and that monkey!''
   Yup, that line actually is uttered in this amazingly unscary yawn
by ``Night of the Living Dead'' writer-director George Romero.
   Of course, the female monkey has been getting secret injections
from a crazed, high-foreheaded medical researcher who wants to
augment her mental abilities.
   And of course, the embittered, paralyzed law student meets a
gorgeous physical therapist with a trapeze. Whoa, time for some
sexual frustration here! Aw, you knew that was coming, didn't you?
   But the hopped-up monkey has assumed an eerie doppelganger
relationship with her master. And she's jealous. Uh-oh! ... Cue the
scary music ... Put the camera on a handtruck and run it around on
the floor! Get the physical therapist in the rack! Get her up on
that trapeze! TASTEFULLY!!!
   Of course there's that inevitable and none-too-suspenseful
showdown between man and beast. But you knew that, eh?
   Will the good guy win and get the gorgeous physical therapist?
And how will he get her down off that trapeze? Will he ever ``walk''
again?

   ``Living Years'' (Atlantic) _ Mike + The Mechanics.
   
   No doubt there is sincerity in the lyrics of ``In the Living
Years,'' a song co-written by Mike Rutherford and B.A. Robertson not
long after their fathers died. Unfortunately, there is little
originality in its description of the communication gap between
father and son (``It's too late when we die, To admit we don't see
eye to eye''). And when the music swells for the refrain and a
children's choir joins in, it sounds uncomfortably like another
Artists for Trendy Causes benefit project.
   Aside from that overdose of FEELING, the most striking feature of
this second album by Genesis guitarist Mike Rutherford's other band
is that there is nothing very striking about it. The tunes are
catchy, the production is smooth, the overall sound is perfectly
listenable and the lyrics contain simple, easy-to-understand
messages: ``Nobody's Perfect,'' love is worth believing in, a ``Poor
Boy'' deserves a break.
   There's a life-is-beautiful-because-we're-in-love song, and a
too-bad-we-couldn't-make-love-last song. Each is pleasant to listen
to, each is easy to hum along with, each sounds vaguely as though
you've heard it before.
   Paul Carrack, best known from Squeeze, and Paul Young from Sad
Cafe share the lead vocal duties. Their voices blend together well
enough to give the band a recognizable sound, and the differences in
their styles are used to good advantage to match the lyrics.
   All the songs are well put together and could easily become hits.
Catchy, smooth, listenable, pleasant, hummable hits. Nothing wrong
with that, unless by chance you're tired of '80s music and looking
for something new.

   ``C.G.P.'' (Columbia) _ Chet Atkins
   
   Chet Atkins, despite his enormous talent and legendary status
among guitarists, has made a fair number of dull albums in his long
career. ``C.G.P.'' is another one of them.
   On most of the songs, Atkins sounds content to lay back and
pleasantly pick through a selection of light, pseudo-jazz
arrangements. It's backround music, a soundtrack of your last visit
to an office waiting room.
   The Atkins-Mark Knopfler duet on ``Imagine'' says a lot about the
album. The combination has enticing potential, but the two
guitarists approach the John Lennon song in such an easygoing,
gentlemanly manner (as if each one is politely waiting for the other
to take off) that it never gets off the ground.
   More successful are ``Jethreaux,'' in which Atkins' snappy
playing proves that easy-listening doesn't have to mean
sleep-inducing, and ``Put Your Clothes On,'' featuring some lovely
interplay between Atkins and fiddler Johnny Gimble.
   Atkins also delivers a heartfelt vocal on the plaintive ``I Still
Can't Say Goodbye,'' in which the singer recalls his late father.
   The title of the album is an acronym for Certified Guitar Player,
which Atkins certainly is. But on ``C.G.P.'' the music rarely rises
above that of a P.O.R. _ Pretty Ordinary Record.

   ``Victory Day'' (RCA) _ Tom Cochrane &amp; Red Rider
   
   ``Victory Day'' is a record filled with intelligent lyrics about
alienation and resiliency. Unfortunately, the creativity reflected
in the lyrics is missing from most of the music, which sounds like a
generic imitation of Springsteen, John Cougar Mellencamp and Bryan
Adams.
   The album is the sixth from the Canadian sextet Tom Cochrane &amp;
Red Rider. Songwriter Cochrane's way with words is apparent from the
opening cut, ``Big League,'' sung by a father whose plans for his
son are ruined by a car wreck. Also stirring is the title cut, about
a girl who tries to temper her boyfriend's dreams of grandeur by
arguing that life is about ``small moments ... all strung together.''
   Ironically, while Cochrane ventures beyond the ordinary when
choosing the subjects he sings about, most of the guitar-dominated
arrangements on ``Victory Day'' are utterly predictable. One
exception is ``Good Man (Feeling Bad),'' a simple ballad that allows
a great bass line and Cochrane's singing to carry the song.
   Most of the other cuts are uptempo, but the band sounds
restrained and a little stiff. It's evident that Tom Cochrane &amp; Red
Rider have talent _ Cochrane sings with a certain swagger, and the
band sparkles occasionally, such as on the soaring guitar break of
``Sons Beat Down.'' But next time the guys should cut loose and take
a few chances.

<TEXT>
   For an actor who starred in the two most
controversial movies in the past years, Willem Dafoe remains
remarkably cool.
   Dafoe's career exploded two years ago with ``Platoon,'' which won
him an Academy nomination and elevated him from a little-known
character actor to full-fledged star. Last year he found himself at
the center of a firestorm of protest over ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' in which he portrayed Jesus Christ.
   Now Dafoe is starring with Gene Hackman as two FBI agents of
differing styles in ``Mississippi Burning,'' a fictional account of
the investigation of the murders of three civil rights workers in
the turbulent 1960s. Black leaders and have assailed the film for
overlooking black participation in the civil rights struggle, and
others who took part in or reported the events have decried the
alleged distortion of history and the glorification of the FBI.
   Director Alan Parker and others associated with the Orion
Pictures movie have emphasized its fictional nature. During a recent
visit to Los Angeles, Dafoe, who lives in New York, declined to be
drawn into the controversy. But he did reflect on his participation
in two headlined movies.
   ``There's no clever anecdote about `Mississippi Burning'; I just
read the script and responded to it,'' he said. ``I was aware of
(the civil rights struggle) in 1964, when I was nine years old. I
don't remember the actual event, but I do remember a lot of trouble
in the South.
   ``Then in 1968, I remember being very conscious, even by reading
the newspapers at 13 and growing up very comfortably, of the feeling
that the world was coming apart. That was the time of Richard Specht
and the murder of those nurses (in Chicago) and the assassinations
of (Martin Luther) King and (Robert) Kennedy. So it's an era that I
don't really know first-hand, because I wasn't an adult. But I think
it points to things that we're concerned with today.''
   ``Mississippi Burning'' was filmed in the same general area where
the events took place.
   ``We got a surprising amount of support from the people down
there,'' said Dafoe. ``I think some people, particularly in our
locations in Mississippi, were eager to cooperate with us, kind of
as a gesture to let people know that things had in fact changed.
   ``But certainly there were people who commonly said, `Why do you
want to bring these things up again? It's over.'''
   Why indeed bring these things up again?
   ``I don't know. I'm not so good at lessons. But I think the
bottom line is: Sure, we can remember things by having this
presented to us again. Remember, it is fiction, but it is based on
the Shelby County murders.''
   Volunteers from around the country were invited to take part in
the ``Freedom Summer'' to help register black voters in segregated
Mississippi. One was 20-year-old Andrew Goodman, a student at Queens
College. On Sunday, June 21, Goodman and two members of CORE
(Congress of Racial Equality), Michael Schwerner and James Chaney,
were driving to the town of Lawndale where a black church had been
burned.
   They were stopped for speeding near Philadelphia and jailed for
several hours. After being released that night, the workers
disappeared. Their bodies were discovered Aug. 4 on a farm outside
of Philadelphia.
   Dafoe's engagement for ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' seems
equally as casual as his appearance in ``Mississippi Burning.''
Returning from the Thailand locations for ``Off Limits,'' he was
summoned to a meeting with Martin Scorsese. After talking to the
director and reading the script, ``I knew pretty much right then and
there that we were going to do this together.''
   The actor realized the perils of portraying Jesus on the screen
and that it was a work that was bound to arouse the wrath of
fundamentalists.
   ``But a man's gotta do what he's gotta do,'' Dafoe said with a
chuckle. ``I felt like I was the right person to do that role. Sure,
I knew that the ... book was controversial, and I knew there had
been a rough history of trying to get this film done.
   ``I must say I was surprised by how the protest manifested
itself. I didn't think the controversy was really going to happen.
Maybe I was just putting it out of my mind because I had some work
to do and that was the important thing.''
   Dafoe was born in Appleton, Wis., and had an early ambition to
act in films. That may have started when he sat through three
screenings of ``Gone With the Wind,'' from morning to night. He
dropped out of high school to join Milwaukee's avant-garde Theater
X, then settled in New York to work with the Wooster Group, with
which he is still associated.
   His early films (``Streets of Fire, ``To Live and Die in L.A.'')
usually cast him as a delinquent or killer. But Oliver Stone saw
something benign in the young actor and cast him as the almost
saintly Sgt. Elias in ``Platoon.'' He has since starred in three
films, but he says that the pace hasn't been too fast.
   ``Nothing's ever too fast,'' he laughed. ``I've been working a
long time, actually. I've been a theater actor since I was 18 years
old, still am. I've been making pictures since 1980.
   ``Sure, things change, life is different. More things are
available to me. Certainly I have a higher profile. But so far it
hasn't bitten back. It's only been good, really.''

   The Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Ellen Taaffe
Zwilich was commissioned to create a new music piece for the Chicago
Symphony because two trombone players wanted her.
   Sir Georg Solti will conduct ``Concerto for Trombone and
Orchestra'' when the Symphony premieres it this month.
   ``The orchestra has a very fine first trombonist, Jay Friedman,
and now has a wonderful bass trombone player, Charles Vernon. They
both asked for me. I love the instrument and I think it's a
wonderful solo instrument _ with a very small repertoire,'' said
Zwilich, the only woman ever to be awarded a Pulitzer for music.
   ``To me it's an instrument that should have the stature of the
violin or piano as a soloist. So I was thrilled. It's nice to feel
you're making a contribution.''
   When it came to composing, Zwilich said, ``What I decided to do
was write very different pieces. The one for tenor trombone is very
interactive with the orchestra.
   ``The other, that I'm working on, is for bass trombone and
strings and very little percussion. It is less interactive and more
brilliantly virtuosic.'' The piece will be premiered next season.
   Her ``First Symphony'' won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1983.
   Zwilich, who is 49, played violin for seven years in the American
Symphony. She played trumpet in school and has had experience with
each family of instruments. She didn't play trombone.
   ``I think one of the wonderful things that's available to a
composer today is the good advice of musicians you respect,'' she
said in an interview.
   ``Both Jay and Charlie have had very strong impact on the pieces
I was writing for them. I've sat down with them, with and without
instruments. We talk on the telephone. Someone who spends his or her
life playing an instrument always has insights the outsider can
never have.
   ``I also sat down with Solti. We talked about other people's
music for trombone and orchestra and he told me what he thought the
problems were.''
   The New York Philharmonic premiered Zwilich's ``Symbolon'' last
June in the Soviet Union. It's the first American composition to be
premiered there. This season, the Philharmonic will perform that
work and the composer's ``Concerto Grosso 1985'' at Lincoln Center.
Based on a theme of Handel, it was commissioned by the Washington
Friends of Handel.
   Zwilich went on the Philharmonic tour. She relates that one
Soviet man said he was surprised to hear a powerful piece composed
by a woman. ``The translator sort of giggled. She, as well as I,
thought it was quaint.'' However, Zwilich said, Americans also ``are
sometimes surprised that women composers would have what might be
considered a powerful statement to make.''
   As the trombone concerto was composed for a particular player and
orchestra, ``Symbolon'' was tailored for its debut.
   ``Two things were uppermost in my mind,'' she said. ``One was
that I wanted it to be a piece that would exploit the New York
Philharmonic's virtuosity. I wrote a bass solo because the principal
contrabass player is from Leningrad.
   ``The fact it was going to receive its premiere in the Soviet
Union was very touching to me. I knew the piece would reflect the
powerful and sometimes conflicting emotions that I have about the
current world political situation.
   ``It's a piece of music. People can listen many different ways.
It's not a piece where I think it's necessary to know the
background. The title is an old Greek term which refers to two
parties breaking something in two and each keeping half. The
implication is that it's a token of friendship and good will. There
is a sense of needing the other to complete things.''
   If elements of Russian music crept into ``Symbolon,'' Zwilich
didn't stop it. ``I left that to the unconscious. I really just
focused on writing a piece.''
   Two recordings of Zwilich music will be released soon. The New
York Philharmonic recorded ``Symbolon,'' ``Concerto Grosso 1985''
and ``Concerto for Trumpet and Five Players,'' conducted by Zubin
Mehta, and ``Double Quartet for Strings,'' conducted by the
composer, for New World Records. The Louisville Symphony recorded
her ``Second Symphony'' for Louisville Heritage Records.
   ``The experience I have as a composer is something I can sit down
and talk about with a poet, painter or writer and we're at the same
level of understanding,'' Zwilich said. ``You have techniques you
master. You have goals to focus on. Some days are better than
others. It is a process that involves all of you.
   ``It's a process in which you're doing something you've never
done before, even though you've done that type of thing before. It's
like sailing out into the ocean without an absolutely clear course.
That's very exciting and a lot of fun. It has difficulties and
terrors, too.''
   Zwilich was born in Miami, has bachelors and masters degrees in
composition from Florida State University and was the first woman to
receive a doctorate in composition from the Juilliard School.
   ``As soon as I could climb up to the keyboard, I did and started
to press down,'' she said. ``I always knew I would be a musician. At
the earliest stage, I was making music for myself. Then I began to
make music for other people, then for other people to play. My life
has been one that came more and more into focus, where composing
became more and more important to me, to the point where about 10
years ago I stopped playing and teaching music theory.''
   Zwilich met her husband, violinist Joseph Zwilich, in a
restaurant after she had performed with the American Symphony and he
had played in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. He died in 1979.
   She composes in the mornings and after 2 p.m. turns to meetings,
proofreading scores for publication, writing program notes.
   As to whether her music is melodic, Zwilich said, ``I'm
interested in the long line but I am a 20th century person. There
are things I think are melodies that people who only know Italian
opera would not recognize as such.''

   Steve Miller's newest album, ``Born 2B Blue,''
was a work of love for the veteran musician. It was something he
just wanted to do, rather than a job to create hits.
   The album, his 18th for Capitol Records, includes such staples of
pop and jazz as ``When Sunny Gets Blue'' and ``Willow Weep for Me.''
But there are no Steve Miller tunes on it.
   ``My own artistic sense told me I could sing that stuff pretty
good,'' the 45-year-old singer-guitarist-composer said. ``I couldn't
play it.'' But he got help from a long-time friend, pianist Ben
Sidran.
   ``It's a forward-looking album. I feel like my audience is ready
for this. I've been ready for this for a long time.''
   He'll tour the world for the album next summer. ``We need about a
$3 million budget to get it ready to take around the world. I think
we can do it. If it works we make lots of bucks and on we go for
another five-10-20 years. I'd like to be performing the rest of my
life. I'd like to drop dead on stage, or off-stage and they can
announce, `Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Miller has just left the
building and the planet.'''
   Miller plans to open the shows solo and acoustically, doing a few
of his big rock hits. Then Sidran will join him.
   ``It'll be the Steve and Ben show for awhile,'' he said. ``Then
his band will come in. We weave our way through blues, jazz and
rock. We've got a real good jazz-rock arrangement on `Space Cowboy.'
We'll invite jazz and blues musicians in that town to solo on `God
Bless the Child' and `When Sunny Gets Blue.' It'll be a well-rounded
evening. I'd like to bring it on Broadway.''
   Sidran and Miller met in 1961 when both studied comparative
literature at the University of Wisconsin. ``He worked on my first
album, `Children of the Future,' and co-wrote `Space Cowboy' with
me,'' Miller said. ``This album has enabled us to work together on a
mature level.
   ``His band came out to play Jazz Alley in Seattle. We brought his
band over to my studio on five afternoons. I would sing. They would
work on the arrangements.'' That was August 1986.
   ``They went on tour. I kept the tapes around. Then I started
listening to them.'' Miller decided he'd like it to become his next
album. ``Ben was down in Los Angeles with the guys. We cut some
more. I asked Ben if he would introduce me to some jazz players.
   ``That's Milt Jackson playing vibes on `Born to Be Blue.' Phil
Woods plays solo on `When Sunny Gets Blue' and `Red Top.' I think
`Red Top' is going to be the most popular song on the record.''
Later, after some live dates with Sidran, Miller redid some vocals
and strings were added.
   ``Born to Be Blue'' was difficult, Miller said, because he had to
run scales and practice. ``It's a Mel Torme tune. I tried to make
things seem seamless and effortless. It was a real job. I found out
how great Mel is.''
   Miller had early musical roots. His mother was from a musical
family and one of his uncles played violin in Paul Whiteman's
orchestra and another uncle played guitat. His father, a doctor and
tape recorder fanatic, was best man at Les Paul and Mary Ford's
wedding. When Miller was 5, the couple showed him guitar licks and
harmonizing.
   ``I wanted to be Les Paul,'' Miller said.
   Miller's father and T-Bone Walker became friends. ``When I was
11, T-Bone taught me how to play guitar behind my head while doing
the splits. I started my first band when I was 12. We played
intermissions at fraternity dances at Southern Methodist. I taught
my older brother to play bass so he could drive me to the gigs.
   ``I went to college, studied in Copenhagen a year, started my
rock 'n' roll career. I was too young and too stupid to go back and
see T-Bone. I wish I had. He totally shaped the way; I am a pupil of
T-Bone Walker when I play lead guitar.''
   Miller decided not to get a doctorate in comparative literature
and instead went to Chicago.
   ``My grad work was done at the University of Blues on the south
side of Chicago,'' he said. ``I spent two years competing with Muddy
Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Junior Wells and Buddy Guy for work in
nightclubs. They tried to steal my gigs and I tried to steal theirs.
We jammed together a lot. It was a very healthy blues scene. It was
getting national attention. Paul Butterfield went East and played
with Dylan. I heard about what was going on in San Francisco; I
headed West.''
   Miller has five platinum albums and, according to Billboard
magazine, three No. 1 singles: ``The Joker,'' ``Rock 'n' Me'' and
``Abracadabra.''
   His commercial success is all rock 'n' roll. ```Fly Like an
Eagle' is rock 'n' roll. I'm going to play it in my jazz show; it'll
go over great.''
   Miller once spent three years away from the business. ``What I
did was finish 14 years of touring. We'd do 11 months a year. It's
the way we sold records. I had done the world 15 times. I had six
Top 10 singles in a row. I remember in 1979 walking off a stage from
an audience of 40,000, handing the guitar to an assistant and
saying, `I don't care if I ever do this again.' I was so tired.
Nothing was spontaneous.
   ``I was rich. I bought a farm in Oregon. In 1982 I moved to
Seattle and started back to work.''
   But Miller had a difficult time making ``Circle of Love.'' He had
just been divorced from his first wife (he has since remarried) and
was not very happy. ``It was not a great album. I just had to make a
record and get going. I received a lot of stinging criticism for
that record,'' he said.
   ``As a reaction I turned around and did `Abracadabra,' the No. 1
selling single in the world in 1983. I felt like, `I can do hit
singles and I'm not washed up.'''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Immigrants and the Rise of Hollywood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The celebrated writer Ben Hecht once said that
the ``persistent banality of the movies is due to the `vision' of
their manufacturers.''
   This, he said, ``is usually a man who has no taste to be violated
or intelligence to be distorted. He admires with his whole soul the
drivel his underlings produce in the factory.''
   Hecht, co-author of that irreverent look at the news business,
``The Front Page,'' and a major screenwriter of the 1930s and '40s,
was assailing the studio bosses who ruled Hollywood during its
``Golden Age.''
   But the transformation of Hollywood from cow town to tinsel town
could not have happened without such men as Adolph Zukor, Louis B.
Mayer, Harry Cohn and Harry and Jack Warner. They were all
immigrants, Jewish immigrants who arrived in this country in the
late 19th century.
   ``The story is the story of not only Jewish immigrants, but all
immigrants,'' said film critic Neil Gabler, author of ``An Empire of
Their Own'' (Crown, $24.95) which chronicles the role played by
Jewish immigrants in the rise of Hollywood.
   ``These individuals created their own alternate America. It's not
particular to just five individuals, it's particular to 5 million.''
   Zukor was born in Hungary in 1873. Orphaned at an early age, he
was raised by an uncle who was a rabbinical scholar. Mayer was born
in Russia around 1885 and would later claim the Fourth of July as
his birthday. His father, Jacob, was a peddler unable to keep his
family out of poverty.
   Harry and Jack Warner were born in Poland, but ended up traveling
around the United States while their father pursued a career as a
cobbler. They would eventually settle in Youngstown, Ohio. Harry
Cohn was born in 1891 in New York City, the son of a tailor. He quit
school at 14.
   They were determined to succeed, to break out of the cycle of
poverty and failure that had marked their childhoods. But for a
Jewish immigrant at the turn of the century, the options were
limited.
   ``They couldn't go to most universities,'' Gabler noted. ``They
couldn't enter most professions, not even law. There were two Jewish
lawyers in all of Southern California.''
   So one by one, they drifted into the film business, which at the
time consisted of nickelodeon houses.
   Some came in by accident. Zukor wandered into a Chicago theater
in 1897, saw a film of a scene from the Broadway hit, ``The Widow
Jones,'' and was impressed enough to eventually open his own arcade.
Cohn, and others, were brought into the business by relatives.
   The industry began to take hold the following decade as
nickelodeons gave way to feature films. By the '20s, movies were big
business and the Jewish immigrants were in charge of the major
studios. Zukor headed up Paramount, the Warners formed Warner Bros.,
Mayer ran MGM and Cohn was in charge of Columbia.
   But the studios were more than a business for the immigrants;
they were an extension of the moguls' own personalities. Zukor
identified with sophisticated and smart, Gabler said, and Paramount
specialized in slick, romantic comedies such as Ernst Lubitsch's
``Trouble in Paradise'' (1932), with Herbert Marshall and Miriam
Hopkins, and his ``The Smiling Lieutenant'' (1931), with Maurice
Chevalier, Miriam Hopkins and Claudette Colbert.
   The hostile, belligerent Cohn liked his films tough and Columbia
became the home of the fast-paced comedies of Frank Capra and Howard
Hawks. Jack and Harry Warner considered themselves outsiders and
their studio specialized in gangster films, starring actors who put
the T in TOUGH _ James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson.
   MGM was the most ``Hollywood'' of all the studios, with its white
sound stages nd art deco administration building. Sentimental films
such ``Boys Town'' and the Andy Hardy pictures reaffirmed Mayer's
own old-fashioned values. It was also the studio that made ``Gone
With the Wind.''
   ``Those pictures were the fullest expressions of the Mayer
personality,'' Gabler said. ``He wanted to be father to the world,
although in a very 19th century, patriarchal kind of way. He treated
his actresses that way. `What are you wearing?' `Who are you going
out with?' He treated his stars like children.''
   Mayer was benevolent compared to the other studio heads, who
followed Cohn's motto: ``I don't get ulcers, I give 'em!'' But
Gabler saw underlying reasons for their ruthless style.
   ``Out of context Harry Cohn is a beast, if you only look at his
behavior. The same thing may be true of Mayer and Zukor and
others,'' Gabler said. ``If you look at them as a group if
individuals who felt the culture was against them, then their
behavior takes a different context.''
   The ending for most of the studio heads was more Shapesperean
tragedy than Hollywood epic. By the '50s the immigrants had been
pushed aside in favor of younger men.
   ``As Hollywood became increasingly democratized, they were like
King Lear, too old to govern. It's a young man's business, for
people who have the iron will to succeed. All these various factors
contributed to their decline. The thing they most feared did happen;
the industry was taken away from them,'' Gabler said.
   He spent five years writing and researching ``Empire of Their
Own.'' He would learn firsthand about the power of the immigrants'
``vision'' after interviewing Norma Shearer, one of MGM's biggest
stars of the '30s and the wife of Irving Thalberg, the studio's
celebrated production head.
   Gabler and Danny Selznick, the son of producer David O. Selznick,
visited the actress at the Motion Picture Home in California not
long before she died.
   ``She was a tiny woman and had no recollection of Thalberg,''
Gabler said. ``After the interview, we took her back to her room and
put her on her bed. Danny said, `Do you mind if I kiss you?' and she
said, `No not at all.' She turned her head and said, `This is my
good side.'''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Stand By Your Man? Not Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three firebrand sisters say two-timing
men need this advice: Get lost.
   Stand by your man? Not these singing siblings.
   The Burch Sisters are a trio of feisty Georgians who give the
term southern belle a more combative connotation.
   Discussing the shrinking violet lyrics that women in country
music often sing, Cathy Burch says: ``I'm sick to death of, `You
have left me so alone.' It's about time somebody said, `Look buddy.
I don't have to put up with this. There are too many fishes in the
sea.'''
   Mirroring this assertive attitude was their first single release
last fall, ``Everytime You Go Outside, I Hope It Rains.''
   The song is about a broken-hearted woman and her sentiments
toward her former lover. Some of the lyrics:
   ``I'm not going to wish you all the best.
   ``I hope you'll be lonesome, stay worried and depressed.''
   In their current record, ``I Don't Want to Mention Any Names,''
they make intimidating remarks at an aggressive woman eyeing their
man. Among the lyrics:
   ``She's asked him to slow dance way too often.
   ``She's made suggestions I don't like at all.''
   Finally, they warn:
   ``If she don't back up, there's going to be some trouble.''
   This blunt approach comes from Cathy, Charlene and Cindy Burch,
who offer fresh perspectives on men-women relationships in their
first album, ``New Fire.''
   ``There are a lot of girl groups out there,'' says Charlene, who
has worked as a licensed practical nurse. ``The Forester Sisters are
fine. Then you've got the McCarters. And the Judds. But there's
room. The Forester Sisters sing mostly about home and families. The
McCarters are mostly about love and then ours is ``look buddy, get
out of my hair.'''
   Their road to a recording contract is the grist for a country
song itself. The three pooled hard-earned wages of $17,000 to go
into a studio in Atlanta and make a demonstration record. Their
producer brought it to the attention of Mercury-Polygram Records
which signed them to a contract in late 1987.
   ``It was a nice Christmas present,'' said Cindy, at age 24 the
youngest, who has worked as a radiology technician for five years.
   She said she had little reservation about risking the money.
   ``I wanted to be able to say we did everything possible, we
tried, so now we can get married and have our babies,'' she said.
   Added Cathy, ``If we hadn't tried, we'd have been 60 years old
sitting on the front porch, wondering.''
   They sing straight-ahead country music that accents their crisp
harmonies. Background instruments are used at a minimum. Cathy, a
Glenn Close lookalike, sings lead vocals and plays piano but all
three switch singing parts.
   They've been singing together for as long as they can remember.
They were originally from Jacksonville, Fla., born three years
apart. They later moved to Screven in southeast Georgia where they
sang at nightclubs, fairs and special events.
   ``We were raised on the farm and there was nothing else to do,''
Cindy said. ``We had to entertain ourselves somehow or we'd beat
each other up. Singing didn't hurt so bad.''
   After completing their formal education, they pursued separate
career interests but lived close enough to each other that they
could continue singing as a trio. Charlene and Cindy entered the
medical profession while Cathy became a licensed cosmetologist and
hairdresser. She also worked in a restaurant and farmed.
   None has ever been married but Charlene and Cindy tease Cathy
about several engagements.
   One of the cuts on their album is ``Open Arms,'' a song made
famous by the rock n' roll group Journey.
   ``We've been singing it for a while,'' Cathy said. ``A lot of our
friends are country, country, country. You can call them rednecks if
you want to. They listen to country and nothing else. They don't
know there are good tunes on the rock 'n' roll stations. A friend of
mine said she loved that song, and it gave me the idea.''

   ``Wanted: People aged 18 to 29 to take recreational
drugs as part of a scientific study. Earn up to $400 in four

   That recent newspaper advertisement is on the up and up. It's
part of the quiet battle waged by drug companies and the federal
government to find ways to curb recreational use of prescription
drugs.
   Scientists hire the volunteers to learn what makes some drugs so
pleasant that they are likely to be abused. They hope to use that
knowledge to develop drugs that are as effective but not
pleasureable enough for illicit use.
   Drug companies use the studies to decide whether to market a new
drug, and in what dosages. Federal agencies use the data to decide
whether to approve a drug for sale or impose certain restrictions on
how it may be prescribed.
   If the drug made subjects euphoric, they are asked whether they
would take it again for pleasure, and how much they would pay for it
on the street.
   The four categories of drugs that cause the most trouble, and are
most scrupulously tested, are painkillers, diet and sleeping pills
and anti-anxiety drugs, said Dr. John J. Boren of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse.
   Drug companies have been trying for years to develop painkillers
as effective as morphine but not as addictive, Boren said. But
pharmacologists have been able to invent new sleeping pills that are
less habit-forming than the traditional sort, barbituates, he said.
   Abuse-proof drugs are medically desirable. But they can also be
immensely profitable, since doctors are likely to prescribe them
with a freer hand.
   One such money-maker is the anti-anxiety drug BuSpar, which was
tested in Boston by Dr. Jonathan O. Cole, chief of
psychopharmacology at McLean Hospital, a psychiatric facility which
is a Harvard University teaching hospital.
   ``The question was,'' Cole said, ```Gee, do people who like
downers like this stuff?'''
   Most of Cole's volunteers are college students.
   ``When they call up we try to get histories from them of what
they use and don't use,'' he said. But reseachers must be careful
because would-be volunteers tend to offer the medical history they
think is wanted.
   ``We want people who have taken sedative drugs recently and taken
them often enough that we're reasonably sure nothing's going to
happen to them,'' Cole said. Occasional users and those who appear
mentally unstable are rejected. Usually about one-third of the
applicants are accepted.
   For the BuSpar study, Cole recruited subjects who had taken
Valium or barbituates for pleasure but seemed stable. On four
different afternoons, they were given Valium, BuSpar, Quaaludes or a
placebo, a ``dummy'' pill with no effects, but were not told which
they had taken.
   The subjects found the Quaaludes very euphoric, the Valium about
half as euphoric, and the BuSpar not much different from the placebo.
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug for sale in
1986, and it is now one of the most successful drugs that
Bristol-Myers has ever launched, according to the company's Janet
Lindholm, manager of consumer affairs.
   BuSpar now competes with other anti-anxiety drugs including
Valium, Zanax and Atavan in a market worth $600 million to $700
million per year, said Scott Litherland, another company spokesman.
Sales figures are kept secret, but more than 3 million prescriptions
have been written, he said.
   Bristol-Myers uses the fact that it is not likely to make
patients high as a selling point with physicians.
   The best results have been with patients who have never taken
anti-anxiety drugs because some long-term patients associate feeling
less anxious with the sedation and euphoria that drugs like Valium
produce, Litherland said. ``They can pop a Valium and they feel
better, but that's not the anti-anxiety effect. It's the side effect
that they think makes them feel better.''
   Bristol-Myers recommends doctors wean such patients from
sedatives before they prescribe BuSpar, he said.
   Depending on the type of drug being tested, scientists may
recruit college students, prisoners, recovered junkies or people in
methadone programs, said Frank Vocci, chief of the drug abuse staff
of the FDA. Some are regulars.
   ``You will have people who have assorted drug histories who'll
try to get into every study that's being run,'' Vocci said. ``..
.They sit around on this little ward and play Nintendo and enjoy
themselves for a week.''
   In addition to human testing, each year about 250 experimental
drugs are tried on animals to see if they are physically or
psychologically addictive. In one common test, monkeys are trained
to push a lever that injects them with a drug. They are then allowed
to give themselves as many injections as they like on the premise
that if the monkeys take it, so will people.
   Drugs that flunk may be abandoned unless their benefits outweigh
their addictive potential. They may be subject to restrictions,
including production limits or bans on telephone prescription or
automatic refills, said Vocci.
   Tests also help regulators decide whether to ban or loosen
controls on drugs that are already approved.
   Congress banned Quaaludes in 1984 after authorities concluded
they were habit-forming and a hit on the black market, Vocci said.
The drug, known by the generic name methaqualone, had been under
tight controls since 1973.
   The FDA permitted loperamide, a diarrhea drug sold under the
brand name imodium, to be sold over the counter after a study in
which recovered narcotics addicts given up to 30 times the usual
dose told researchers they did not think what they took was a drug,
Vocci said.
   ``If you really do a good job on prevention, you never hear of
this drug again because it never gets introduced to the market,''
Boren said. ``This is one place where better science and technology
is paying off without meeting the public's eye.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Higher Reading Levels For Speech-Trained Deaf Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By R.B. FALLSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debate over whether to teach deaf children
how to speak is unlikely to wane, educators say, despite a recent
study showing that reading scores were strongly higher for those
able to speak.
   ``It's a very emotional controversy,'' said Jean Moog, principal
of Central Institute for the Deaf, where the federally funded study
was done last year. ``I think what we're trying to do is bring some
rationale to the topic.''
   In the study of 100 profoundly deaf 16- and 17-year-old students
who had been taught speech, reading scores were five grade levels
higher than the third-grade nationwide average for profoundly deaf
students. Thirty of the 100 read at or above the 10th-grade level,
said Ann Geers, who led the research.
   ``That means they were functioning for all practical purposes
like normal-hearing adolescents, which is rather outstanding
considering the severity of their deafness,'' Geers said.
   Profoundly deaf people, even with the most powerful hearing aids,
cannot understand speech without special training, though they may
hear some sounds.
   The report has been well received by supporters of teaching the
deaf to speak, but Moog said those who favor total communication,
combining speech and sign language, are less enthusiastic. That is
used in 90 percent of schools.
   The hit movie ``Children of a Lesser God'' dealt with the moral
question of whether the deaf should be integrated, sometimes against
their will, into the speaking world. Sign language is easier to
teach than speech, but may be of little or no use except among other
deaf people.
   According to Helen Bayer, coordinator of the St. Louis County
Special School District deaf education program, choosing between the
two extremes and a myriad of choices between depends on factors such
as intelligence, other learning disabilities and family support.
   ``I've enjoyed great success with some profoundly deaf students
in teaching them to talk, and I've interacted with others where it
was a very painful experience in which their self-confidence was
destroyed,'' Bayer said.
   In the typical total communication program, research has shown
that students depend too much on sign language, Moog said. ``They
make noises, they vocalize, but speech is not intelligible without
the signs.''
   Deaf children in total communications programs also don't read as
well because they aren't given intensive instruction in speech and
language, Geers said. If deaf students are to reach their full
potential, they must be taught to speak at an early age, before
signing is learned, she said.
   To participate in the study, teens had to have been profoundly
deaf before they learned language. They had to have been educated in
an oral setting only, and to have a normal I.Q. with no significant
educational handicaps.
   In reading ability, Moog said, ``What appeared to make the most
difference was their facility with English, the extent to which they
mastered vocabulary, understood syntatic structure and how to form
complex sentences, how to write them, how to speak them, and how to
understand them when they were spoken.''
   Of the 20,000 profoundly deaf people under age 21 in the United
States, only about 10 percent are taught in oral communication
programs that emphasize the limited hearing they have, lip-reading
and speaking.
   ``If you want deaf children to talk, it takes a lot of work on
speech,'' Moog said. On average, children in a total communication
program receive two or three half-hour speech lessons a week, and
end up using mostly sign language.
   ``The profound effect will come within the next 10 years when all
deaf children being educated in total communication programs are not
talking,'' she said. ``There will be an entire generation of deaf
children who will be angry that they were not given the instruction
to talk.''
   Proponents of total communication say that teaching speech takes
more time and effort, and that many preschool children in oral-only
programs are unable to communicate in any form for a few years.
   ``I've always referred to it as a religious war,'' Bayer said.
``It's sort of like finding passages in the Bible that will support
your position.''

<HEAD>Dinosaur Expert Takes Aim At Movie, Toy Makers' Accuracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Weishampel started out to do a little
research to advise Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions on buying
dinosaur toys, and came away with some advice for the makers of
books, toys and movies: Consult the experts.
   Few dinosaurs dragged their tails and many had muscular legs with
feet, ``not just telephone poles with little blobs at the end,''
said Weishampel, 36, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine anatomy
professor and paleontologist.
   And despite depictions of dinosaur-hunting cavemen, ``the last
dinosaur departed the earth 65 million years ago. The first
prehistoric human existed roughly 4 million years ago. No way did
cave men or women clobber dinosaurs.''
   Weishampel's role as protector of the saurian image hasn't come
easily. After all, his 3-year-old daughter Amy collects dinosaurs
and 8-year-old Sarah enjoys last year's dinosaur movie, ``The Land
Before Time.'' He doesn't want to be a spoilsport, even though the
film portrays known plant-eating dinosaurs as ``real killing
machines'' that attack babies, and shows them with ears.
   ``They stuck them on to add cuteness,'' he said. ``Baby dinosaurs
would have been rather cute. They don't need mammal heads to make
them cute.''
   In the toy market, Weishampel said, ``There are companies that
put out dinosaur toys or books that try and demonstrate some
educational value to their product, that say it's educational or
museum quality. That just isn't true.''
   Tyco, a Moorestown, N.J.-based company that makes ``Dino
Riders,'' is a ``pretty nifty example,'' he said. ``They market
mechanical dinosaurs that they claim are museum-quality and are
scientifically accurate. The worst thing about them is they combine
their products with alien life forms, laserguns, little saddles you
can strap on.
   ``The narrative is bad guys from some planet arrived on earth,
co-opted dinosaurs, then the good guys fought off the bad guys, also
co-opt dinosaurs and therein lies the forum for kids to play with.
   ``Where does the science stop and where does the fantasy begin?''
   Tyco senior vice president of marketing Jim Alley, creator of
Dino Riders, defended the line as offering accurate models in a
fantasy context. Alley isn't worried that Weishampel's gripes will
hurt sales _ $40 million last year in the United States for the 15
different dinosaurs _ or that they are misleading.
   ``There were absolutely no cavemen alive when there were
dinosaurs, and every kid knows that,'' Alley said. ``Our purpose
here was to make authentic dinosaurs kids could play with. I'm
adding the fantasy to it.''
   A comic book accompanying Dino Riders details the scenario of
good and bad aliens passing through a space-time portal into the
dinosaur world, and Alley said he figured historical models alone
would bore most children.
   ``Why is sticking in humans or humanoids going to enhance play?''
asked Weishampel. He called the explanation on the package merely
``your 7-cent version of articulating some science to the kids.''
   Dinosaur popularity has been high before _ in the 1930s, for
example _ and scientists now are in the midst of a ``sort of
dinosaur renaissance,'' he said. About 40 percent of all known
dinosaurs have been discovered and named in the past two decades,
including a small plant-eater Weishampel and a colleague discovered
and named last summer in Montana _ Urodromeus, or mountain runner.
   With the field in a vigorous state, he said, ``if dinosaurs
really excite kids and it's a good way to get them educated, do it
right.''
   However, Weishampel spares some portrayals. Fred and Wilma
Flintstone, for example, and their pet dinosaur Dino. ``In the
Flintstones, the association of cavemen and women with dinosaurs
certainly doesn't work in terms of what we know about in the fossil
record.
   ``But it's not really purported to be educational.''

<HEAD>Footprints From First Humans On Moon Should Last A Half Million Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The footprints left on the moon 20 years ago
by Neil Armstrong and Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin should be visible for
another half-million years, says a chemist who studies lunar erosion
rates.
   ``The moon is a quiet place, lacking an atmosphere and therefore
free of wind and rain,'' said James R. Arnold, a ``cosmochemist'' at
the University of California, San Diego.
   But even without an atmosphere, the moon's surface is slowly
eroded _ by bombardment from meteorites and cosmic rays. Arnold said
they eventually will obliterate the footprints left on the lunar
surface when Apollo 11's Armstrong and Aldrin became the first
humans on the moon in July 1969.
   Arnold and his colleagues studied moon rocks retrieved during six
Apollo missions to develop techniques to measure the rates at which
meteorites and solar and galactic cosmic rays erode lunar rocks and
soils.
   The information ``bears directly on many questions about the
evolution of our solar system, including the Earth,'' he said. His
findings were presented during the recent annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Analysis Shows Narrowing Of Male-Female Difference In Math Skills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The intellectual gap between men and women
has almost closed, with females doing almost as well as males on
tests of mathematical and spatial skills, and men's verbal abilities
nearly matching women's.
   Marcia Linn and and Janet S. Hyde analyzed hundreds of studies of
sex differences and reasoning abilities conducted during the past
two decades and concluded ``the differences are now so small as to
be negligible,'' Linn said at the meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
   ``The relatively poorer performance of women compared with men on
tests of spatial and mathematical ability has often been used to
explain the much greater access of men to scientific fields and
higher earning power,'' said a statement by the University of
California, Berkeley, where Linn is a professor of education. Hyde
is a University of Wisconsin psychologist.
   Spatial abilities involve reasoning about images, such as
locating a single figure embedded within a more complex geometric
design.
   Men still outdo women in one major math test _ the Scholastic
Aptitude Test taken by high school seniors _ but it is being revised
to remove any bias that may work to the disadvantage of women, Linn
said.

<HEAD>Ultrasound Microscope Expected To Improve Disease Diagnosis</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Joie is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $375,000 ultrasound microscope that
bounces sound waves off cells or larger samples of body tissues
should speed and improve doctors' ability to diagnose cancer and
other diseases, a scientist says.
   Pieces of suspected tumors or other tissues removed during
surgery or biopsy normally must be fixed, or preserved, and then
stained and placed on a glass slide _ a time-consuming process.
   ``With acoustic microscopes, you essentially throw the hunk of
tissue in the microscope and look at it,'' said Dr. Joie Jones, a
radiology professor at the University of California, Irvine, College
of Medicine.
   The microscope, which operates something like a submarine's
sonar, probes samples of human tissue by bombarding them with sound
waves with frequencies 500,000 times higher than sounds perceptible
by the human ear.
   The waves are changed as they pass through samples, and the
returning waves are converted into a visual picture that can be
viewed directly, photographed, stored on a computer disk or strung
together to create movies.
   By determining the density and elasticity of a cell's membrane,
the microscope can indicate the cell's permeability, or ability to
transport chemicals in and out. The permeability changes when cells
become cancerous, so the microscope can be used to diagnose and
track cancer, Jones said.
   Such uses ``will lead to improved diagnoses of diseases and much
more rapid diagnoses without the elaborate tissue preparation that's
required today,'' he said during a recent interview.
   Jones also said that because the device doesn't destroy the cells
it examines, as X-rays can, it will let scientists watch living
cells in previously unknown detail, and even make movies of cells
dividing.
   Only two of the microscopes exist in the United States. Jones
said the second is used in secret military research at Sandia
National Laboratory in New Mexico, apparently to examine electronic
circuits and other sensitive hardware.

<HEAD>Dealing With Constipation May Take Simple Surgery, Change In Diet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN PLATERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Steven Wexner treats patients
with fatal diseases like cancer, but his specialty is a less deadly
malady that because of its nature is rarely discussed openly.
   Wexner calls it Young Executive Tight Sphincter Syndrome. His
patients are usually 25 to 55 years old and professionals or
business executives.
   Most people call it constipation.
   ``It begins with a type-A personality, the type who eats a
low-fiber, high-junk-food diet and can't take a few minutes to relax
on the toilet,'' he said.
   Such habits lead to irregularity, constipation and, finally,
straining during bowel movement. Repeated straining against a tight
anal sphincter causes the delicate skin to crack and bleed, a
condition called a fissure.
   Bowel movements become so painful that people try to avoid them.
``Ignore the symptoms and you'll be worse off,'' warned Wexner,
whose Cleveland Clinic Foundation lab is one of a few specializing
in constipation and incontinence.
   Sufferers often wrongly assume they have hemorrhoids when they
discover bleeding, and ``then they buy those preparations which do
nothing,'' he said.
   The cure for those with YETSS, he said, is minor outpatient
surgery. A small cut is made to relax the sphincter and ease bowel
movement. Most patients are able to return to work the day after.
   Surgery isn't always necessary if the patient seeks medical help
at the first sign of anal bleeding and persistent constipation. In
its early stages, constipation can be resolved through diet and
relaxation.
   To maintain ``normal'' bowel movements _ anything from three
times a day to three times a week _ Wexner urges a high-fiber diet
of fruits, vegetables and bran, along with regular exercise and
eight to 10 glasses of non-alcoholic beverages a day. ``And don't
get in the habit of taking laxatives and enemas because the colon
gets addicted to them after prolonged abuse.''
   Individuals suffering from constipation often have other medical
problems, too, such as ulcers, high-blood pressure and nerves.

2,695,836 Japanese vehicles, or 44.1 percent of Japan's total motor
vehicle exports.
   He said the yen's rise against the U.S. dollar made the Japanese
cars more expensive and less competitive in the United States. In
addition, Japanese car makers produced 869,556 cars in the United
States last year, some in joint ventures with U.S. makers, up 18.2
percent from the previous year, Nakayama noted.
   Japan's total vehicle exports declined 1.9 percent in 1986 and
4.5 percent in 1987. Since September 1985, the yen has climbed from
240 yen to one U.S. dollar to less than 130 yen now.
   Nakayama said 1988 exports included 4,431,888 passenger cars,
down 1.7 percent; 1,626,576 trucks, down 7.7 percent, and 45,688
buses, up 29.9 percent from 1987.
   He said Japan exported 2,051,319 passenger cars to the United
States, down 7.0 percent; 644,514 trucks, down 26.8 percent, and
three buses, an increase of two.
   Japan also exported 1,705,363 vehicles to Europe, up 3.8 percent;
473,749 to Southeast Asia, up 36.4 percent; 230,275 to Africa, up
55.5 percent; 225,483 to the Middle East, up 10.7 percent; 105,385
to Central America, down 29.7 percent, and 98,121 to South America,
up 20.5 percent.

<HEAD>Ministry Unveils Measures To Trim Trade Surplus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea will send purchase missions
to the United States with shopping lists worth $4 billion to help
ease trade frictions with its big trading partner, Trade and
Industry Minister Hahn Seung-soo said Monday.
   The minister said he feared that the new administration of
President Bush might mount pressure on Korea to further appreciate
its won currency to correct bialteral trade imbalances favoring
Korea.
   Seoul prefers increases in imports to steep revaluation of the
won because the latter approach would tend to slow down Korean
exports while stimulating imports.
   The minister said Korea needs to take steps to expand imports
from the United States before May when Washignton is to designate
unfair trading countries under the tightened U.S. trade law.
   He said that an electronics import mission and a general purchase
mission will tour the United States in March, followed by a farm
products purchase mission in April and another import mission in May.
   The four missions intend to purchase $2.1 billion of electronics
equipment and parts, $1.4 billion of general machienry and parts and
$500 million of aircraft and parts, he said.
   Korea hopes to narrow its overall trade surplus this year,
setting a target of $5 billion, down from $8.9 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Texas Eastern Board Rejects Coastal's Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Eastern Corp.'s board of directors is urging
stockholders not to tender their shares to Coastal Corp. after
rejecting as ``clearly inadequate'' Coastal's $2.6 billion cash
offer.
   In a special board of directors meeting Sunday, Texas Eastern's
board was told by financial advisers they should wait for a better
offer.
   Coastal announced Jan. 16 it was making a cash tender offer of
$42 per share for all of Texas Eastern's outstanding common shares.
Since then, Texas Eastern's stock has soared, closing Friday at $48
a share.
   The tender offer is set to expire on Feb. 14.
   Dennis R. Hendrix, Texas Easten's president, said Coastal's offer
``is clearly inadequate.'' He said the board's action are designed
to protect shareholders from ``pressure tactics designed to stampede
them into a decision before they can service a better offer.''
   Hendrix added that the board's decision in no way prevents
Coastal from raising its bid.
   ``If there's only one short-fused bid on the table, shareholders
don't have a choice,'' Hendrix said in a prepared statement, ``they
have an ultimatum. It may be more than what they had, but we don't
believe it is the best they can get.''
   Coastal's president, James R. Paul, said in a statement, ``It's
obvious that after two weeks Texas Eastern still does not have a
better offer than coastal's $42 a share.''
   He said Coastal plans to respond and make further comment after
reviewing documents that Texas Eastern indicated it would file
Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In a court hearing last week in Houston, Texas Eastern officials
said the company might use a ``white knight'' to block the Coastal
bid and had a list of more than 50 possible buyers.
   Coastal officials later suggested that the comment was designed
to inflate stock prices and make their offer appear inadequate.
   Paul has said Coastal has asked Texas Eastern for information
that would justify a higher offer, but said the only response has
been ``rhetoric and a stonewall meeting last Sunday.'' Paul met with
Texas Eastern's board last weekend.
   Analysts have said they doubt that there may be a large number of
serious contenders to take over Texas Eastern, a Houston-based
natural gas company.
   Houston-based Enron Corp., which operates the nation's largest
natural gas transmission system and long had been considered a
possible candidate for a Texas Eastern takeover, will not say
whether it is talking to the company.
   During the court hearing before U.S. District Judge Lynn N.
Hughes, the judge denied a Texas Eastern request to delay a Feb. 7
hearing date in a Coastal lawsuit desinged to prevent Texas Eastern
from using anti-takeover measures.

<HEAD>Oman Ready To Reduce Oil Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Omani Oil Minister Saeed Al-Shanfari said
Monday his country was ready to reduce its oil exports to help
stabilize world oil prices following a meeting between OPEC and
independent oil producers last week.
   The minister's pledge was made in a statement to his country's
Arabic-language daily Oman and broadcast by Muscat Radio, monitored
in Bahrain.
   Meanwhile, Syria said it plans to boost its oil exports from
80,000 barrels a day in 1988 to around 130,000 to 140,000 barrels a
day this year.
   Oman's announcement followed a meeting last week in London
between oil experts from six OPEC countries and 13 non-OPEC
countries.
   ``Oman is ready to reduce its exports within the framework of a
general agreement for oil producers outside OPEC,'' Shanfari was
quoted as saying. He did not give any percentage.
   A statement issued after last Thursday's meeting called for
non-OPEC oil producing nations to cooperate with the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in stabilizing world oil prices.
   The statement also urged non-OPEC producers to continue this
``initial effort'' in the second half of the year.
   OPEC agreed last November, after oil prices slumped to near 1986
levels, to cut production to 18.5 million barrels a day and help
return Middle East crude prices to an $18 target from below $12. The
new quota was to take effect Jan. 1.
   Although prices have risen more than $3 a barrel since the
agreement, various reports suggest that OPEC production is still
higher than the 18.5 million barrel mark.
   OPEC has said it cannot stabilize prices alone and has called for
the cooperation of non-OPEC producers. Last week's meeting capped
OPEC's latest effort to garner support from producers outside the
cartel.
   Shanfari stressed that a unilateral adherence to such a request
would be pointless as it would have no impact on the market and
price stability. ``All should cooperate,'' he said.
   The non-OPEC participants, who included Angola, China, Colombia,
Egypt, Malaysia and Mexico, among others, said they agreed on an
unspecified set of actions but wished to advise their own ministers
before revealing them to OPEC.
   At a first meeting of the two sides last April, independent
producers suggested a five percent cut.
   Shanfari told the newspaper that his country was playing ``an
important role'' in such coordination.
   The Sultanate produces about 600,000 barrels per day of which it
exports about 550,000 barrels. It has in the past also restricted
its output to help OPEC stabilize the market.
   According to the Middle East Economic Survey, a respected
industry publication, Syria's exports will be made possible by an
increase in production from 270,000 barrels a day in 1988 to 350,000
barrels a day in 1989.
   The increase will come from the startup ``during the next few
weeks'' of the Omar field in northeast Syria with a capacity of
about 100,000 barrels a day, the newsletter reported.
   The new field is operated by the Al-Firat Petroleum Co. owned 50
percent by the state-owned Syrian Petroleum Co. and by U.S. Shell's
Pecten subsidiary (15.6 percent), Royal Dutch Shell (15.6 percent),
and Deminex (18.75 percent). Royal Dutch Shell is the operator.
   The publication said exports from the new field would start in
February or March mixed with crude oil from another producing field.

   Americans' personal income rose 0.9 percent in
December after a slight decrease during the previous month, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said income rose $37.1 billion to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.2 trillion last month,
following a decline of 0.2 percent in November and a 1.5 percent
increase in October. November's decrease had been the first since
January, when incomes dropped 0.4 percent.
   Personal income for all of 1988 was up 7.5 percent from the
previous year, the biggest increase since a 9.5 percent rise in 1984.
   The December increase was bolstered by an increase in farm
subsidy payments. Excluding those subsidies, personal income rose
0.8 percent in December and 0.5 percent in November, both fairly
strong gains.
   October's unusually large 1.5 percent jump in personal income
also had been boosted by a surge in farm subsidy payments and
bonsues to auto workers.
   Personal consumption spending, which includes everything except
interest payments on debt, rose 0.9 percent in December to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.34 trillion last month after a
0.3 percent gain a month earlier.
   The biggest increase in spending last month was for durable goods
_ ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years. The
category rose 4.1 percent, followed by a 0.7 percent increase in
spending for services and a slight decrease in spending for
non-durable goods.
   Disposable, or after-tax income, rose 0.9 percent in December
following a 0.3 percent decrease a month earlier that was the first
decline since April, when annual income tax payments depressed
personal income by 1.4 percent.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, were up
0.6 percent to $2.53 trillion in December following a revised 0.3
percent gain a month earlier. Manufacturing salaries edged up 0.2
percent after falling 0.6 percent in the previous month.
   The volatile category of farm income soared 73.2 percent to $23.9
billion after plunging 66.8 percent in November.

   James A. Baker III made his first public
appearance today as secretary of state, opening a conference on
environmental problems with a five-minute speech calling for steps
to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency and reforestation.
   ``We face some very dificult problems,'' he said. ``It's also
true we now recognize them to be problems, and that's at least half
of the battle.''
   In Baker's audience at the State Department was William K.
Reilly, named by President Bush as the administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Baker spoke at the opening of a
2{-day conference on climate change attended by officials from
various countries and U.S. agencies.
   Touching on the international scope of climate problems, Baker
said `'this is a transnational issue. We all are in the same boat.
...The tides and winds can spread environmental damages to
continents and hemispheres far removed from the immediate
disasters.''
   ``We probably cannot afford to wait until all of the
uncertainties have been resolved,'' Baker said. ``Time will not make
the problem go away.''

   Fairchild Industries Inc. Monday announced it
has taken additional steps to protect itself from a takeover,
including paying $75 million to repurchase stock and other
securities from the Soros group, its largest shareowner.
   George Soros and Harvey Karp agreed to resign from Fairchild's

Fairchild stock for 10 years as part of the deal, the Chantilly,
Va.-based aerospace company announced.
   In addition, Fairchild said it was selling 1.6 million shares of
stock to its own employee stock ownership plan, using the shares
that it is buying from the Soros group.
   The sale will mean employee plans will have 23 percent of the
company's common stock and 19 percent of the outstanding voting

   The company noted that the transactions would make it harder for
the company to be acquired except in a deal approved by the board of
directors.

<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. today issued $300 million
of stock to a private investor group and said it would buy back $1.1
billion of its own stock in an apparent move to block a hostile
takeover by Shamrock Holdings Inc.
   A spokesman for Shamrock, a Disney-owned company that has been
pursuing Polaroid since last July, would not comment immediately on
the program's substance, but said the plan's objective was clear.
   ``We have to take a look at the announcement, but I think it's
absolutely obvious that it's an effort to block Shamrock,''
spokesman John Grimaldi said.
   But Polaroid officials denied the convertible stock issued to
Corporate Partners L.P., a firm managed by New York investors Lester
Pollack and Ali Wambold, was a defensive move.
   ``It's designed simply to deliver a portion of the company's
current value while enhancing the growth prospects for its values,''
Polaroid spokesman Sam Yanes said.
   Polaroid was at $40.25 in mid-morning composite New York Stock
Exchange trading, up 12.5 cents from its opening price today.
   In addition to the sale of preferred stock, financing for the
repurchase program likely will be provided in part by cash on hand
and borrowing from a syndicate of banks led by Morgan Guaranty Trust
Company of New York and possibly other sources, Polaroid said in a
statement.
   Companies often buy back their own stock to reduce the number of
shares outstanding and raise the per share price. Such practices
have become common among companies seeking to discourage a takeover.
   Yanes said the common stock's conversion price would be $50 per
share and would have voting rights on an as-converted basis, but did
not say over what time period the stock would be purchased.
   Convertible preferred stock can be exchanged at a specific ratio
by its holder at any time for shares of a corporation's common stock.
   Eugene Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York, said the stock issuance would concentrate a sizeable
percentage of the voting rights with groups friendly to Polaroid.
   ``And that will make it significantly more difficult for Shamrock
to obtain the 51 percent they would require in a proxy fight,''
Glazer said.
   Polaroid officials one week ago rejected as inadequate Shamrock's
sweetened $45 per share offer for all Polaroid stock, including 9.7
million shares issued under Polaroid's controversial employee stock
ownership plan.
   Shamrock officials vowed last week to proceed with plans to
nominate a slate of candidates for election to Polaroid's board at
the company's annual meeting on May 9.
   If elected, Shamrock's candidates would be committed to selling
the company either under Shamrock's offer or to any third party that
made a higher bid.
   Last July, the Burbank, Calif.-based company offered $40 per
share in a friendly but unsolicited bid.
   Shamrock, a television and radio concern wholly owned by the Roy
E. Disney family, is scheduled March 16 to appeal in Delaware
Supreme Court a lower court's recent ruling upholding the employee
stock ownership plan. Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware.
   Shamrock contends the employee stock was issued to block a
takeover. It if it invalidated, Shamrock has promised to raise its
offer to $3.36 billion, or $47 per share.

   Futures prices for wheat were higher, while corn
was lower and soybeans mixed in early trading today on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Wheat was the market leader with prices advancing on the forecast
of colder temperatures at the end of this week in the U.S. growing
area and the signs of more life in the export market, analysts said.
   Overnight, Tunisia was seeking 175,000 tons of U.S. wheat.
   But Egypt's purchase of 100,000 tons of U.S. corn didn't keep
futures prices for that commodity from falling.
   Soybean prices were depressed by reports of scattered showers
improving the South American crop, but gains were made on technical
factors and a spill over in buying from wheat, traders said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 3} cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.42 a bushel; corn was { cent to
1\ cent lower with March at $2.70} a bushel; oats were unchanged to
3 cents lower, with March at $2.12 a bushel; and soybeans were 2
cents higher to 2{ cents lower, with March at $7.53 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat prices advanced in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, cattle were .05 cent to .63 cent higher, with
the contract for delivery in February at 73.72 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent to .45 cent higher, with March at 83.60 cents a
pound; live hogs were unchanged to .50 cent higher with February at
42.60 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to .45
cent higher, with February at 39.05 cents a pound.
   On Friday, cattle prices surged but live hogs and frozen pork
bellies were mixed.

million, or $3.44 per share, up 80 percent from earnings of $352
million, or $1.85 a share, in 1987. Sales jumped to $4.29 billion
from $3.59 billion.
   The results included $136 million of pre-tax expenses, including
$62 million for pension plan improvments.
   For the year, Dow Chemical netted $2.39 billion, or $12.76 per
share, on sales of $16.68 billion. That compared with income of
$1.24 billion, or $6.47 a share, and $13.37 billion in sales.
   Frank Popoff, Dow president and chief executive officer, said the
company had strong gains in all sectors, and he predicted the same
for this year.
   ``The business environment remains strong as we enter 1989,'' he
said in a statement. ``Prices are firm and demand is healthy, with
most products in tight supply.''

   Toyota Motor Corp. may keep using the Lexus name
for its forthcoming line of luxury cars, except in national
advertising, until a decision is handed down in a trademark
infringement case, a federal appeals court said Monday.
   Mead Corp.'s Mead Data Central Inc. has sued Toyota, charging
that the Lexus name infringes on its Lexis trademark for a
computerized research service.
   A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
heard arguments Monday in Toyota's appeal of a ruling last month by
a federal judge, who had sided with Mead and issued an injunction
that would prohibit Toyota from using the name Lexus or impose
severe conditions on its use.
   The appellate panel said Toyota can use Lexus, except in national
advertising, until the court issues a decision on the merits of the
case. Under an earlier stay of the injunction, Toyota had been
uncertain whether it could use the Lexus name in letterheads and
when answering the phone, according to its lawyer, Arthur Gray.
   Mead, based in Dayton, Ohio, is not claiming that anyone would
confuse a Lexus car with its Lexis research service. Instead, it is
suing under a New York state law that protects trademarks from
``dilution.'' Toyota says Lexus does not break the New York law.
   The Lexus line, which is scheduled to go on sale in September, is
intended to be Toyota's answer to Honda Motor Co.'s Acura and Nissan
Motor Co.'s forthcoming Infiniti line of luxury cars.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Jan. 4-12 with 1,162 adults in the
continental United States.
   The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20.
The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 4 points for men, for
example.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Generally, do you think airline security on international
flights is adequate, or not? Yes: 28 percent. No: 56 percent. Don't
know or no answer: 16 percent.
   2. The federal government has directed U.S. airlines to X-ray all
checked baggage on flights from Europe and the Mideast. Should
foreign airlines be required to do the same thing? Yes: 96. No: 2.
DK-NA: 2.
   3. Would you support or oppose requiring airlines to hand-search
all checked baggage on international flights, even if that means
passengers have to show up three hours before takeoff? Support: 73.
Oppose: 22. DK-NA: 5.
   4. Would you support or oppose a ban on carry-on luggage on
international flights? Support: 49. Oppose: 45. DK-NA: 7.
   5. Should the U.S. government publicly announce all terrorist
threats it receives against airlines, even if it gets such threats
on a daily basis and cannot tell if they're legitimate? Yes: 45. No:
45. DK-NA: 9.
   6. How about the airlines _ should they be required to announce
all terrorist threats they receive? Yes: 57. No: 38. DK-NA: 6.
   7. If the United States has proof that another country supported
a terrorist group that attacked U.S. citizens, should the U.S. take
military action against that country? Yes: 55. No: 30. DK-NA: 15.
   a. (If yes) Would you feel that way even if the U.S. military
action might kill innocent people in the other country? Yes: 60. No:
31. DK-NA: 10.
   8. If the United States believes that another country supported a
terrorist group that attacked U.S. citizens, but has no direct
proof, should the U.S. take military action against that country?
Yes: 9. No: 84. DK-NA: 7.
   9. If the United States strikes militarily against countries that
it believes support terrorism, do you think that will increase
terrorist attacks, decrease them, or make no difference? Increase:

   A 30-inch oil pipeline was out of service for
at least one day Monday after a break and fire that injured six
people, the national oil company said Monday.
   A spokeswoman for Petroleos Mexicanos, also known as Pemex, told
The Associated Press on Monday that the fire had been extinguished
but the pipeline was to be out of service until the break was
repaired, probably by Monday afternoon.
   The spokeswoman, who did not want to be identified by name, said
Pemex had not determined how much oil had been lost as a result of
the damage.
   In a news release Sunday, Pemex said six employees of the Aguilar
Silva construction company were injured in the accident.
   Pemex reported that the pipeline broke when two Aguilar Silva
tractors dropped a section of pipe on the functioning pipeline. The
company is constructing another 48-inch pipeline at the site in
southern Oaxaca state, Pemex said.
   Pemex said that its employees diverted the spilled oil into a
ditch and put out the fire on Sunday.
   Pemex said the accident occurred on the line between the pumping
station at Neuvo Teapa in Veracruz state and the Salina Cruz
refinery.
   The rupture occurred 90 miles from the pumping staton near the
town of Donaji in southern Oaxaca state.

   Futures prices for soybeans advanced, while wheat

   Wheat prices moved ahead at the start of the day but pulled back

<HEAD>First Labor, Now Business Seeks Revisions to Inflation Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's business sector is beginning to join
labor in grumbling about the government's successful
inflation-busting program, especially the program's wage-price
freeze.
   Business also has been critical of new taxes imposed under a
federal tax reform plan and increasingly is calling for reversal of
Mexico's free trade policy aimed at fighting inflation.
   For more than a year the government has counted on business
support of the Economic Growth and Stability Pact to counter labor's
anger over the wage freeze.
   The program was implemented after inflation reached 159.2 percent
in 1987, and it cut inflation to 51.2 percent last year _ with
prices growing at a much slower rate by the end of the year.
   The pact's wage and price freezes come up for renewal in July,
and labor has been unhappy with what it considers pro forma minimum
wage hikes of 3 and 8 percent since February 1988.
   Private sector leaders had supported the pact, but complaints
about price controls and profit squeezes surfaced last week when
Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche denied the government had
agreed to lift price controls.
   ``There is no formal commitment of any nature in that sense,''
Serra Puche told a news conference last week. ``What I can assure
you is that inside of six or seven months, there simply will be a
new agreement and we will have, as the president has said, a
permanent effort to find a solution to the problems of this
economy.''
   Vicente Bortoni, director of the influential Confederation of
Industrial Chambers and a member of the pact's supervisory
committee, suggested business would agree to another pact extension
only if the government begins ``to liberate the economy'' and free
prices.
   Another industrialist complained that nationalized banks are
refusing to follow the program.
   Ignacio Munoz, president of the National Association of
Industrialists in Transformation, said last Thursday that bank loans
for new investment carry interest rates of about 80 percent, while
the banks' own borrowing costs run around 49 percent.
   High interest rates discourage new private investment, Munoz
said, while businesses have been forced to absorb a 40 percent
increase in electricity rates, January's 8 percent wage increase and
a 35 percent jump in social security contributions.
   The Business Confederation of the Mexican Republic and the
Coordinating Council of Industrial Associations joined the chorus to
protest a new 2 percent tax on fixed assets.
   The 2 percent tax, part of a tax reform promised by President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, seeks to reduce the government's fiscal
deficit. But the Confederation and Council contended that the tax
only worsens the private sector's ability to make new investments.
   Further, more industrialists are citing a liquidity squeeze in
urging the government to impose restrictions on imports, a move that
would reverse a 2-year-old trade liberalization policy.
   Former President Miguel de la Madrid employed free trade as a key
anti-inflation tool. Through August, consumer goods imports surged
by 133 percent and capital goods imports by 57 percent, helping to
suppress prices but wiping out Mexico's trade surplus.
   Official data have yet to be published for September, when most
economists believe Mexico began running a trade deficit.
   ``If this problem persists and gets worse, the capital goods
industry in Mexico, which has already been hurt, is going to see the
crisis deepen,'' Elias Meckler, president of the Coordinating
Council, told local reporters last week.
   But Serra Puche ruled out trade barriers. Free trade has been one
of Salinas' key weapons in trying to make Mexico's manufacturers
more efficient, and success in that goal would reduce prices in
Mexico and increase exports.
   Serra Puche declined to say what changes may be in store for the
pact, but said ``the agreement is fundamental, it's been very useful
for the Mexican economy and it will continue being the standard of
the (Commerce) department.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. on Monday reported increased
income and sales for the fourth quarter of 1988, despite expenses
incurred in the company's planned sale to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co.
   For the quarter, RJR Nabisco's net income was $411 million, up 11
percent from $370 million in the final quarter of 1987. Net income
per common share came to $1.78, up 22 percent from $1.46 a year
earlier. Sales were $4.7 billion, up 7 percent from fourth quarter
1987 sales of $4.4 billion.
   The Atlanta-based cigarette and food products giant also reported
record sales and profits for the year 1988.
   The company reported 1988 net income of $1.4 billion, up 15
percent from $1.2 billion in 1987. Net income per common share was
$5.92, up 26 percent from $4.70 a year earlier, and sales were $17
billion, up 8 percent from $15.8 billion in 1987.
   RJR Nabisco's companies include R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Nabisco
Brands, Del Monte Foods and the Planters LifeSavers Co.
   The 1988 results ``were adversely affected'' by tax provisions
for repatriation of some foreign earnings, advisory fees and
``certain other expenses ... incurred in anticipation of the
previously announced merger of the company'' with a corporate arm of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, said a statement from RJR Nabisco's
corporate headquarters.
   After a bidding war of several months, sparked by a takeover
attempt by RJR Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson, the RJR board late
last year agreed to a $109-per-share takeover offer from KKR. The
$25 billion deal will be the biggest corporate takeover in history.
   Without the tax provisions and expenses the company cited, 1988
net income would have been $1.5 billion, up 26 percent, with
per-share net income of $6.47, up 38 percent, the statement said.
Fourth-quarter net income would have been $539 million, up 46
percent, with per-share earnings of $2.33, up 60 percent.
   The company's tobacco sales in 1988 were up 11 percent, to $7.1
billion, from $6.3 billion a year earlier. The company's food
business recorded sales of $9.9 billion, up 5 percent from $9.4
billion in 1987.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was weighed down most of

   ``The market is actually pretty amazing,'' said Bill Raftery, an

   President Bush, in a speech, predicted ``jobs in abundance'' in

   Analysts said the market got a bit of a boost from the robust
dollar and falling prices of oil and gold, although stocks were
fueled mostly by their own steam.
   ``Nobody cares about anything except the market itself,'' said
Michael Metz, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   The dollar's recent strong showing has revived foreign investors'
interest in the stock market, and they and others are poised to jump
into the action in the near future, Metz suggested.
   ``There are buyers waiting in the wings,'' he said. ``There's
plenty of money still waiting to get in.''

   USX Corp. said Monday that Charles A. Corry, a
tax lawyer and corporate planner who once aspired to little more
than middle management, has been elected to succeed David M.
Roderick as chairman and chief executive of the oil and steel giant.
   The move has been expected since last February when Corry, as

was given the title of president of the entire company and assistant
to Roderick.
   Corry, 56, will take the top job June 1, the day after Roderick,
65, retires as mandated under company policy.
   ``Chuck Corry has worked closely with me on the restructuring of
the corporation during the 1980s. This experience makes him uniquely
qualified to lead USX into the decade of the 90s,'' Roderick said.
``I am pleased that the board chose him, and he has my strong
support.''
   On the New York Stock Exchange, USX rose 37{ cents a share to
$32.50.
   Roderick led the transition from U.S. Steel Corp., which was
largely dependent on steelmaking, to USX, which derives two-thirds
of its $15 billion in annual sales from oil and gas yet remains the
nation's largest steel producer.
   Corry has described himself as an unemotional person and not one
to willingly sacrifice his personal life for his career.
   ``I work more than I would prefer,'' he said in March 1988 of a
routine that kept him in the office from 7:10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.
   In that interview with The Pittsburgh Press, Corry said he places
personal values ahead of material success.
   ``I feel sorry for people who no matter how successful ... are
not happy,'' he said. ``I have been a happy person all my life. I am
content with myself and I always have been. I've made peace with
myself a long time ago, and we all have to find that peace so that
when we lay our head down on the pillow at night we sleep soundly
and we are content with ourselves.''
   Corry said he once tried to plot his career.
   ``I figured out that if everybody retires when they should and if
I move up as I should ... I was going to be tax manager at about 46
years old, and I would have thought that was a pretty successful
career,'' he said.
   The board did not make a new selection for the office of
president, a post Corry will vacate June 1 when he becomes chairman
and chief executive. The position was empty from the retirement of
William Roesch in November 1983 until Corry's appointment last year.
   A Cincinnati native, Corry began his USX career in the tax
department of the former American Steel and Wire Division in
Cleveland in 1959. A series of tax and finance assignments in
Pittsburgh and New York led to his promotion to tax department
general manager in 1975 and assistant comptroller in 1978.
   He became vice president of strategic planning in 1979, and
senior vice president and comptroller in 1982, the year U.S. Steel
acquired Marathon Oil Co.
   While still responsible for corporate planning, Corry oversaw
much of the asset sales from the non-oil and non-steel businesses
assembled in the Diversified Group.

<HEAD>Investors, Feeling Cheated, Concerned About Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERI PRASSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calls to a commodities industry complaint hotline
have jumped by about 27 percent from a year ago since the public
disclosure of a federal fraud investigation centering on the
nation's biggest futures exchanges, hotline officials said Monday.
   The calls to the National Futures Association hotline _ which are
up to about 630 a day _ reflect how investors who feel they may have
been cheated by commodities traders are anxiously watching the
federal investigation.
   ``It's been very busy around here, I can say that,'' said Tony
Rose, the director of the hotline.
   The two-year investigation at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
Chicago Board of Trade involves allegations that as many as 100
brokers and traders systematically cheated customers out of millions
of dollars.
   Some market watchers say investor reaction to the burgeoning
scandal could vary, partly because there is no real indication who
may have been cheated or for how much.
   The action on the floors of the Merc and Board of Trade is a
rapid, chaotic process involving traders and brokers who represent
individual investors, pool investors, banks, investment firms,
multi-national corporations, farmers and argicultural merchants.
   ``To the extent that there are victims, they would be the public
customers ...a doctor, a lawyer, an Indian chief, John Q. Public,''
saidStephen Selig, a commodities law professor at New York
University and former chairman of the New York Bar Association's
committee on futures regulation. ``They either paid more than they
should have when they bought, or got a lower price than they should
have when they sold.''
   For example, suppose an investor puts in an order to buy soybeans
at the market price. At the time the trader receives the order, the
price of soybeans is $7 a bushel and moving higher.
   The trader is bound by law to execute the customer's order before
trading for his own account. But an unscrupulous trader could buy
for his own account at $7 a bushel and sell the soybeans to fill the
customer's order at $7.01 a bushel moments later.
   Although traders are suspected of raising the price only by a
quarter-cent or half-cent when skimming illegal profits, investors
say the difference adds up.
   ``When I was a buyer, I felt the fill (or an order) they gave me
was a cent above the market,'' said Jim Lovdahl, president of
Monmouth Grain and Dryer Co. in western Illinois. But his losses
totaled more than one cent.
   ``For example, on 100,000 bushels, that would be $1,000,''
Lovdahl said.
   Gary Martin, president of the Peoria-based Ostrum Martin Inc.
grain elevator company, said, ``It's like I've got a guy shoveling a
barrel of corn and what does it hurt if he takes a handful out of
each shovelful? Well it does hurt.''
   Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the large Decatur-based agricultural
concern whose complaints reportedly led to the federal
investigation, repeatedly has refused to talk about its role.
   Other large interests, such as the investment firm Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., are concerned about possible losses, but are waiting
for more information before pointing fingers, said Dean Witter
spokesman Jim Flynn.
   At the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency
that regulates the futures markets, officials said it was too early
to pinpoint who may have been burned by futures traders.
   ``Hypothetically it could come off the back of the little old
lady in tennis shoes who lives in Des Moines, ...but it's hard to
say a farmer, or a little old lady or a dentist in Peoria or ADM
itself got hurt,'' said CFTC spokesman David Gary.

<HEAD>London Shares Close Sharply Higher But Down From Peaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices enjoyed another exceptional day on the
London Stock Exchange Monday, soaring to new heights amid heavy
demand from institutional investors.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 37 points, or 1.85 percent, at 2,042.9, after surging as much
as 66.8 points in the afternoon.
   At its minimum the index was up just 9.4 points at the opening.
   ``There are quite a lot of institutions who are still underweight
(in equities). They've got too much cash,'' one dealer said.
   The rise in prices was once again exacerbated by a shortage of
stock on the part of market makers, who sought to draw out a few
sellers in order to fill in their books, market observers said.
   But prices fell off their peaks on profit-taking, dealers said.
   ``One or two institutions have been quite happy to sell some
stock'' to take profits after the market's 13.9-percent rise since
the new year, the dealer said.
   A tentative opening on Wall Street also helped to push prices
down from their best levels.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 27.5 points higher at
1,666.4. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 19.37 points to
1,148.75.
   Volume was heavy, with 1.06 billion shares changing hands, down
from 1.17 billion shares on Friday.

   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. said Monday it
agreed to divest some duplicate product lines it would acquire in
its $24.53 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. under a tentative
agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission.
   The buyout firm said either RJR Nabisco or Beatrice Co., another
consumer products firm owned by KKR, would sell some of their assets
and businesses after the merger.
   The asset sales would take place within 12 months of final
approval from the FTC commissioners and would include duplicate
products such as respective brands of ketchup, oriental entrees, soy
sauce and packaged nuts, KKR said.
   Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco accepted KKR's $109-a-share offer last
November over a slighlty higher management-led bid. The holding
company, RJR Holdings Corp., has since been formed for the takeover.
   FTC spokeswoman Anna Davis said her office could neither confirm
nor deny that a tentative agreement was reached with KKR.
   The FTC reviews many propsed mergers to determine the effects on
competitiveness and often requires acquiring companies to divest
certain businesses.

<HEAD>Fourth Quarter Helps Defense Company Offset Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp. on Monday reported strong
fourth-quarter 1988 earnings that helped the company counter losses
it incurred during a 103-day strike at its Electric Boat division in
Groton, Conn.
   Despite the fourth-quarter comeback, net earnings decreased 12.6
percent for the year. Also adversely affecting the results, the
company said, were up-front investments in its advanced tactical
fighter and advanced tactical aircraft projects in Fort Worth, Texas.
   Significant improvements in its Cessna Aircraft and Land Systems
divisions helped General Dynamics post after-tax fourth-quarter
earnings of $110.2 million, or $2.64 per share, on sales of $2.5
billion.
   The company's net income was up 15.6 percent from 1987's amount.
Net earnings for the Oct.-Dec. 1987 period were $95.3 million, or
$2.27 per share, on sales of $2.5 billion.
   For the fourth quarter of 1988, earnings included tax benefits of
$25 million, or 60 cents per share, compared with similar benefits
of $20 million, or 48 cents per share, for the period in 1987.
   General Dynamics' net earnings for all of 1988 were $379 million,
or $9.03 per share, down from $437.3 million, or $10.26 per share,
for all of 1987.
   The company's sales in 1988 were $9.6 billion, compared with $9.4
billion in 1987. Net earnings for the year included tax benefits of
$85 million, or $2.03 per share, compared with those of $80 million,
or $1.88 per share, in 1987.
   Stanley C. Pace, chairman and chief executive officer for the
defense contractor, said orders for more than 100 jet aircraft
received during the year by Cessna brighten the company's future
outlook.
   General Dynamics was recently awarded the construction contract
for the first SSN 21-class Seawolf attack submarine, giving it
lead-ship construction for 16 of the Navy's 19 classes of nuclear
submarines.
   ``This win gives us a decided head start on future construction
contracts in competing for the remaining 29 ships the Navy plans to
build,'' Pace said. A $400 million contract awarded General Dynamics
during the fourth quarter for construction of one SSN 688-class
attack submarine was General Dynamics' 33rd in the class, Pace said.
   General Dynamics' funded backlog at the end of 1988 was $18
billion and its total backlog, funded and unfunded, was $24.5
billion, representing approximately 2.6 years of sales compared with
$17 billion and $22.8 billion at the end of 1987.

   Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Dennis R. Patrick, acknowledging concerns on Capitol Hill about a
proposal to revamp the way AT&amp;T sets its prices for interstate
services, on Monday postponed a decision on the plan until March.
   A decision by the FCC on a so-called rate cap method of pricing
for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s long-distance services had
been scheduled for Monday. But after members of Congress said the
FCC may not have legal authority to make such a change, Patrick
issued a statment prior to the meeting saying he would defer a vote
until March to give lawmakers more time to study the plan.
   ``Given the importance of this docket, the complexity of the
docket and in order to accommodate the interest in some additional
briefings and the provision of some additional briefing information,
I have agreed to reschedule this item for the meeting on March 16,''
Patrick said at Monday's hearing.
   ``I believe it is very important for the commission to craft
regulations which will improve the incentives that are facing
dominant carriers,'' Patrick said. ``On the other hand, the Congress
is intensely interested in this docket. ... I would hope that in the
spirit of the new administration that we can use this as a
foundation to establish a more constructive dialogue with members on
both sides of the aisle with respect to this matter and other
matters that are pending before the commission.''
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, which oversees telecommunications matters,
welcomed Patrick's decision to delay.
   ``I think the commission acted wisely,'' Dingell, who had
criticized the FCC proposal, said in a statement. ``The Congress had
a number of concerns about the impact of the price caps proposal and
the FCC appears to be addressing them. As the details of the plan
receive public scrutiny and go through the congressional hearing
process, I hope the spirit of cooperation with Congress will
continue.''
   Since the early 1960s, the government has allowed AT&amp;T a certain
profit beyond its costs. But the FCC proposed replacing this
so-called rate-of-return regulation for ``dominant carriers'' such
as AT&amp;T with ceilings on prices. That would include the seven
regional Bell companies that AT&amp;T spun off in 1984.
   The commission said its proposal would encourage greater
efficiency and innovation and save customers $1.6 billion over four
years if all the dominant companies participated. The FCC last May
proposed that AT&amp;T be allowed to raise rates 3 percent less than
annual inflation.
   AT&amp;T said in a statement it was ``disappointed and frustrated''
by Patrick's deferral, and that every day a decision was delayed,
``the public loses.''
   BellSouth, one of the seven regional phone companies that would
be affected by the new pricing scheme, said ``the commission appears
to have stepped away from an opportunity to save telephone users
billions of dollars.''
   Another regional company, Bell Atlantic, said ``we are sorely
disappointed that the FCC and Congress have been unable to resolve
their differences over how to best implement a price cap plan that
will benefit consumers, the telecommunications industry and the
nation.''
   Lawmakers had been skeptical of the new plan.
   ``As currently structured, the price cap scheme will permit
carriers to set prices that may deviate significantly from costs,''
said a report last November from the Democratic staff of the House
Energy and Commerce telecommunications subcommittee.
   ``There is no assurance that rates would remain even with a
`zone' of reasonableness.''
   On Jan. 19, in an attempt to allay lawmakers' concerns, Patrick
sent a letter and supporting documents to the chairman of the
telecommunications panel, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and to
Dingell.
   He assured Markey and Dingell that the price cap proposal had not
been rushed through by his staff and that he had recommended a
number of changes in the plan, including a delay in implementing the
proposal for the regional Bell companies and other local exchange
carriers.
   He said he also would recommend establishing separate price cap
``baskets'' for AT&amp;T's business and residential customers to prevent
the company from raising residential prices to finance rate
reductions for businesses.
   He also proposed an ``automatic stabilizer,'' which he said would
operate to ensure that local carriers' earnings ``remain within the
zone of reasonableness and that consumers share in the efficiency
gains price cap regulation is designed to generate.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. corporate takeover activity hit record
$311.4 billion last year and Wall Street firms reaped an all-time
high of $1.28 billion in fees for their roles in the deals, a
financial information service said Monday.
   Data compiled by IDD Information Services showed a total of 3,637
mergers and acquisitions were completed in 1988, revising upward its
Jan. 4 estimate that showed a total of 3,310 transactions worth
$282.4 billion were completed.
   The revised figures showed a 41.6 percent jump over the 1987
level of 3,565 deals worth $219.5 billion.
   IDD said fees for merger-related work earned by investment
banking firms, an important source of business in the aftermath of
the October 1987 stock market crash, rose 39 percent last year from
the 1987 level of $801.6 million.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. retained its position as top financial
adviser for the third straight year, working on 158 deals worth
$93.4 billion, IDD said.
   First Boston Corp. ranked second, advising on 153 deals worth
$78.23 billion, despite the loss of its senior executives in charge
of mergers-related work, Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, who
formed their own firm.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ranked third, with 211 deals worth
$74.15 billion; Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. ranked fourth, with 125 deals
worth $74.06 billion; Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ranked fifth, with
158 deals worth $39.04 billion, the IDD figures showed.
   Other members of the top 10 included: Wasserstein &amp; Perella,
sixth, with 19 deals worth $35.65 billion; Lazard Freres &amp; Co.,
seventh, with 59 deals worth $34.73 billion; Salomon Brothers,
eighth, with 124 deals worth $31.83 billion; Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
ninth, with 1l6 deals worth $24.82 billion; and Kidder Peabody &amp;

   Fear of a frosty Florida helped spark a rally of futures prices
for frozen concentrated orange juice Monday on the Cotton Exchange
in New York.
   The spot contract for delivery in March rose 515 points or $5.15
cents in active trading.
   ``Basically, there were two reasons _ a correction of oversold
conditions and weather concerns as colder weather is expected to
push into the eastern half of the United States,'' said Judy Ganes,
an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The market has been on the selling side since the first of the
year because of price cuts by processors and expectations of an
abundant Florida crop, Ms. Ganes said.
   Orange juice settled 4.75 cents to 5.15 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $1.41.90 a pound.
   Futures prices for soybeans advanced, while wheat was widely
mixed and corn steady on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices moved ahead at the start of the day but pulled back
at the end of the session, although contracts for delivery after May
finished up to a nickel higher on fears of winter crop damage,
traders said.
   ``Commission house buying and prospects of colder air moving into
the Midwest sent prices ahead. Then the old crop was struggling,
mainly because of no new export business with the Soviets,'' said
Dale Gustafson, a grains analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Soybean prices made gains on technical factors and a spillover in
early buying in wheat, said Jerry Gidel, another Chicago analyst,
with G.H. Miller.
   Wheat settled 4\ cents lower to 5{ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.37\ a bushel; corn was } cent
lower to { cent higher with March at $2.71 a bushel; oats were 3{
cents to 4{ cents higher, with March at $2.15} a bushel; and
soybeans were 5{ cents 8{ cents higher, with March at $7.60{ a
bushel.
   Cattle prices advanced sharply and pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Higher prices on the wholesale and cash markets, plus a ``bullish
cattle-on-feed report on Thursday'' all helped to bolster cattle
futures, which climbed as much as 135 points or 1.35 cents, said Tom
Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights,
Ill.,
   Some of the cattle rally spilled over into the live hogs pit and
frozen pork bellies ``were mainly marking time,'' Morgan said.
   Cattle settled .50 cent to 1.35 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in February at 74.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.50 cent to 1.10 cents higher, with March at 84.27 cents a pound;
live hogs were .10 cent lower to .50 cent higher with February at
42.60 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 2.00 cents lower
to .15 cent higher, with February at 39.75 cents a pound.
   Precious metals prices fell on the Commodity Exhcange in New York.
   Futures prices for gold and silver continued to tumble in early
trading after Friday's slump, but they recovered somewhat toward the
end of the session as traders decided the market had been oversold,
said Sharon Ziemian, a trader in New York for Citibank.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 80 cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in February at $395.30 a troy ounce; and silver was 5.3
cents to 7.8 cents lower, with February at $5.83.2 a troy ounce.
   Energy prices were mostly lower in futures trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil settled 27 cents to 45 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in March at $17.29 a barrel; and heating oil was .91
cent lower to .61 cent higher, with February at 52.59 cents a gallon.

   The dollar slipped Monday, giving up part of the
gains achieved in Friday's powerful rally in spite of bullish
economic news. Gold prices edged down after Friday's plunge.
   The dollar began to lose ground after traders who had loaded up
on the currency on Friday decided it did not seem to be following
through on the rally as they had hoped, dealers said.
   The dollar failed to rise in response to a Commerce Department
report that Americans' personal income rose 0.9 percent in December,
a figure that ``should have helped the dollar,'' said Bob Morrissey,
senior trader of the Bank of Boston in New York.
   There was no evidence that central banks had intervened to sell
dollars, as they had in an attempt to stem Friday's rally, said John
McCarthy, chief dealer of Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York.
   Earlier in Tokyo, where the business day ends before London's
begins, the dollar rose to 129.73 Japanese yen, up 1.08 yen. In
London Monday the dollar traded at 129.85 yen. In New York the
dollar fell to 129.30 yen from 129.38 Friday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the pound. One British pound
cost $1.7605 Monday, less expensive for buyers than Friday's late
$1.7655. But in New York the pound rose to $1.7625 from $1.7595 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late
rates, included: 1.8595 West German marks, down from 1.8650; 1.5808
Swiss francs, down from 1.5875; 1.1813 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1835; 6.3235 French francs, down from 6.3358; and 1,360.5 Italian
lire, down from 1,364.5.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Friday's
late rates were: 1.8660 West German marks, up from 1.8570; 1.5884
Swiss francs, up from 1.5743; 6.3500 French francs, up from 6.2875;
2.1085 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0880; 1,365.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,352.37; and, 1.1820 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1853.
   Gold bullion prices in London were trading at $394.50 a troy
ounce, down from the closing price of $398.25 Friday.
   Gold in Zurich was trading at a late price of $394, down from a
late bid price of $398.75 a troy ounce Friday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $395.96 bid, down from
$403.99.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $395.30 a troy ounce from $396.10.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was
bid at $394.35 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST. Friday's price was
unavailable.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.83 bid a troy ounce,
down from $6.02. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $5.832 a troy ounce from $5.883 on Friday.

<HEAD>Goldman, Sachs Cutting Back 66 Positions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. said Monday it was cutting
back 66 positions in its domestic fixed-income division because of a
slowdown in bond trading and sales.
   The investment firm said the cuts involve less than 1 percent of
its 6,600-person worldwide staff.
   ``This move reflects an industry-wide slowdown in fixed-income
market activity and does not imply any change in direction in our
basic fixed-income business strategy,'' the firm said in a statement.
   Goldman spokesman Ed Ryan said the cuts affect trading, sales and
administrative staff. He said some employees may be given other jobs.
   The cuts, which began in December and are near completion,
primarily affect Goldman's U.S. government bond and mortgage
operations. Ryan said the reductions do not include the firm's
high-yield or municipal bond areas.
   Goldman said the cuts affect about 5 percent of the domestic
fixed-income division, but employees said privately the division
workforce totals about 700, placing the layoffs at close to 10
percent.

   Momentum from last week's impressive rally lifted
the stock market Monday in active trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.25 points to
2,324.11, its highest close since the market crash in October 1987.
   The closely watched blue-chip indicator was restrained to some
extent by a $4 drop in shares of Texaco Inc., one of its components.
But the broader market rose convincingly.
   Advancing issues edged declines by about 3-to-2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 876 up, 570
down and 533 unchanged.
   ``The market is actually pretty amazing,'' said Bill Raftery, an
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``There's no
profit-taking going on; they're hanging in there.''
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 167.83 million
shares, down sharply from 254.87 million in Friday's session _ which
saw the heaviest trading in seven months.
   Analysts described the advance as a continuation of Friday's
surge, when a wave of institutional buying lifted the Dow Jones
average over 2,300 for the first time since the October 1987
collapse.
   On Monday, the drop in Texaco shares dampened the Dow's rise.
Investors were disappointed by news late Sunday that Texaco's
management had struck a truce with its biggest shareholder and
long-time nemesis, financier Carl Icahn, who said he would not try
to buy the oil giant or wrest control away from its board of
directors.
   Texaco, the second-most actively traded issue on the Big Board,
tumbled 4\ to close at 50\.
   The Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal income
rose 0.9 percent in December after a slight decrease during
November. Analysts said the report stirred some inflationary concern
in the bond market but was largely shrugged off by Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market got a bit of a boost from the robust
dollar and falling prices of oil and gold, although stocks were
fueled mostly by their own steam.
   ``Nobody cares about anything except the market itself,'' said
Michael Metz, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   The dollar's recent strong showing has revived foreign investors'
interest in the stock market, and they and others are poised to jump
into the action in the near future, Metz suggested.
   ``There are buyers waiting in the wings,'' he said. ``There's
plenty of money still waiting to get in.''
   Among other actively traded issues on the NYSE, volume leader RJR
Nabisco jumped 2 to finish at 98. The investment firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. said it agreed to divest some duplicate product
lines it would acquire in its $24.53 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco
under a tentative agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade
Commission.
   Union Carbide rose | to 28|, IBM jumped 1~ to 128}, Ford Motor
climbed 1[ to 53| and Polaroid was up | at 40|.
   AT&amp;T fell 1 to 30{, Phillips Petroleum slipped [ to 20{, Illinois
Central dropped 1\ to 21[ and Southern Co. was unchanged at 23~.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 202.66 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $9.60 billion, or 0.33
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.58 at 165.36.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index increased 1.41 to 340.96, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 1.17 to 294.99.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.26 to 399.22. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 321.88, up 0.31.

<HEAD>Import Dealer Group President Blasts Iacocca</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outgoing president of an import car
dealers organization on Monday criticized Chrysler Corp. Chairman
Lee Iacocca for backing a move to stick a 25 percent tariff on
imported vans and sport utility vehicles.
   The Treasury Department in Washington is considering a plan that
would reclassify the hot-selling vehicles as trucks, instead of
cars. That would raise the import tariff from 2.5 percent to 25
percent of the vehicle's value, and add an estimated $2,000 to
$3,000 to price tags.
   Iacocca, General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith and Ford Motor
Co. Chairman Donald Petersen signed a joint letter to Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady on Jan. 16 saying that without the change,
the domestic industry would be hurt and the Treasury would lose
millions of dollars in potential revenue.
   Robert McElwaine, who has been president of the American
International Automobile Dealers Association for 19 years, accused
Iacocca of backing the move only to benefit Chrysler.
   Boosting tariffs on the foreign vehicles could prompt customers
to buy domestically-produced alternatives.
   ``Lee Iacocca thinks Americans should feel ashamed and humiliated
because the Treasury Department didn't cave into his little scheme
that would cost consumers more than a billion dollars a year and,
not incidentially, add a half-billion to Chrysler Corp.'s already
swollen profits,'' McElwaine said during a speech.
   McElwaine and others in New Orleans for the National Automobile
Dealers Association convention said changing the tariff would be
disasterous for some importers and import dealers.
   One such company is Range Rover of North America Inc., whose
luxury sport-utility vehicle made in England is the only vehicle the
company sells in the United States. President Charles Hughes said
the Customs Service classified the vehicle as a car in 1984, when it
first was introduced in the United States.
   The price of a Range Rover, if the 25 percent fee is imposed,
would climb past $40,000.
   ``I don't think anybody can look us in the face and say a $40,000
vehicle is designed to haul goods,'' Hughes said.
   The ruling also could affect dealers such as Herb Overstreet, who
sells Nissans in Lakeland, Fla. Nissan now imports its Pathfinder
from Japan.
   ``It (the Pathfinder) is a small percentage of my business,''
Overstreet said. ``We just have not had the availability.'' He also
said he now sells all the Pathfinders he can get and would like to
have more.
   ``It (the new tariff) would just kill sales,'' he said. ``We have
our fingers crossed.''
   Nissan's Tom Mignanelli, executive vice president for operations,
said one of the company's options is to move production of the
Pathfinder to its plant in Smyrna, Tenn. That move would take about
a year, but would enable Nissan to avoid the increased tariff on the
vehicle, he said.
   ``One way or another, we will not give up an inch in
Pathfinders,'' he said.
   But the future for Nissan's Axxess minivan, to be introduced in
March as a 1990 model, isn't as guaranteed, Mignanelli said.
   ``There is the possibility that if the tax stays on, Axxess is in
jeopardy,'' he said.

   Americans' after-tax incomes shot up 3.8
percent last year, with some of the extra money going to raise the
nation's personal savings rate from the 40-year low it had hit just
a year before, the government said Monday.
   The Commerce Department said the gain in income, adjusted for
inflation, was the best since a 3.9 percent gain in 1986 and more
than double 1987's 1.7 percent.
   In other economic news, the stock market continued its march past
pre-crash levels Monday, while a new survey showed the cost of
employer-sponsored health-care plans increased dramatically last
year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.25 points to
2,324.11, its highest close since the market crash in October 1987.
   The health-care survey by A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co. in New York
found that health-care costs rose 18.6 percent per worker last year
after increases of 7.7 percent in 1986 and 7.9 percent in 1987.
   In December, personal income totaled $4.2 trillion, with much of
the $37.1 billion jump from November resulting from farm subsidy
payments. Without those outlays, the government said, December's
total income would have been up 0.8 percent.
   Last year's income gains spurred both spending and saving:
   _Consumer spending rose 2.8 percent after adjusting for
inflation, following increases of 2.7 percent in 1987 and 4.3
percent in 1986.
   In December alone, spending rose 0.9 percent, with the biggest
increase, 4.1 percent, posted for durable goods _ ``big ticket''
items expected to last three or more years.
   _The average personal savings rate rose a full percentage point,
from 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent, the highest since the 4.4 percent
set in 1985.
   The 1987 rate was the smallest since a 3.1 percent rate in 1947.
   In all, economists said the figures were a good sign for
continued economic strength in the coming year.
   ``There's a balanced picture for consumers, with a strong
increase in income, a solid increase in spending and some increase
in savings,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co.
``All three of those ... are quite desirable if the expansion is
going to keep on rolling along.''
   Added Robert G. Dederick, an economist with Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago:
   ``People continue to fill their wallets and then they continue to
empty them and this clearly should provide the impetus for a further
push in growth in the first half of 1989.''
   However, Lawrence Chimerine, head of the WEFA Group, an economic
consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., cautioned that much of the
year's income growth came from increases in employment and could not
be expected to continue unabated. Joblessness was at a 14-year low
in 1988.
   ``Once we run out of people to put into the labor force, we'll
see much smaller growth in income,'' Chimerine said.
   Both Dederick and Chimerine said the savings rate still was too
low and that while the spending and income picture for 1988 was
generally good, high levels of spending have made it more difficult
to narrow the nation's trade deficit as consumers fail to curb their
appetite for foreign goods.
   The year ended on a strong note as personal income in December,
before adjusting for inflation, rose 0.9 percent.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of income, were up 0.6
percent to $2.53 trillion in December following a revised 0.3
percent gain a month earlier. The volatile category of farm income
soared 73.2 percent to $23.9 billion after plunging 66.8 percent in
November.
   Sinai said the year-end strength ``was impressive and suggests
that consumers will have the wherewithall to keep spending for a
number of months.''
   ``There are no impediments in sight to continued good growth in
income and consumption,'' he said. ``The consumer is supportive of
our expansion at this point, neither spending in a boom-like way nor
showing any signs of a fade in spending.''

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices closed mixed in uneventful
trading Monday as investors continued looking for signals that would
spur prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled 45
cents lower at $17.29 a barrel. Other contract months also fell.
   Among refined products, the February contract for heating oil
surged 0.61 cent to close at 52.59 cents a gallon, while other
contract months were mixed.
   The February contract for unleaded gasoline fell 0.71 cent to
settle at 48.88 cents a gallon as other contract months also lost
ground.
   Traders said forecasts of cold weather and sub-freezing
temperatures in Alaska helped strengthen heating oil prices.
   ``The Alaskan pipeline is partially closed because of the storms,
shutting down 1 million barrels of exports,'' said Bob Baker, an
energy futures analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   In the crude market, investors waited for further word from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries following last week's
meeting between technical experts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries.
   The meeting focused on possible production cuts by non-OPEC
producers in an effort to stabilize prices. The experts agreed on
the need to take further steps to support prices, but took no
definitive action to do so.

<HEAD>United Artists, United Cable Keep Talking But Expect to Miss Deal
Deadline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A pair of Denver-based cable companies, United
Cable Television Corp. and United Artists Communications Inc., said
Monday they cannot meet the Feb. 28 deadline for their
previously-announced merger but that are continuing their talks on a
business combination.
   Analysts said they expect the deal to proceed but possibly at a
slightly higher price than the $1.6 billion value they had placed on
the original deal.
   The proposed merger, which involves a complicated cash-and-stock
swap, would create the nation's third-largest cable concern.
   The companies, who cancelled an all-stock merger plan after the
October 1987 stock market crash, announced last March they had
agreed to a cash-and-stock merger.
   But on Monday, the companies said in a joint statement that
because of ``delys resulting from regulatory requirements,'' the
deal could be terminated by either party because the closing cannot
occur by the Feb. 28 deadline specified in the agreement.
   The companies also said they were ``discussing on what terms any
business combination between United Cable and United Artists could
go forward.''
   A spokesman for United Artists Communications said he could not
elaborate on the statement. A call was placed to United Cable but it
was not returned.
   One official familiar with the discussions but speaking on
condition that he not be identified said the delays involved
securing Securities and Exchange Commission approval for a proxy
statement outlining the terms of the deal.
   ``It's a process that seems to have taken longer than
anticipated,'' he said. He said the Feb. 28 deadline could not be
met because the companies must allow 20 business days after mailing
proxy statements before a shareholder vote can be taken on the deal.
   The proposal would allow United Cable's shareholders to convert
their shares into either $35 in cash or stock in the new company
with a separable right to sell a share of the new company's stock at
special terms. The cash portion of the deal was available on up to
49 percent of United Cable's 46.4 million fully diluted shares.
   United Artists shareholders would have the right to convert their
stock on a one-for-one basis into stock of the new concern, which
would be called United Artists Entertainment Co.
   Sharon Armbrust, a senior analyst for the media research concern
Paul Kagan Associates Inc. of Carmel, Calif., said the companies
have invested too much time and energy in the deal to let it fall
through but said it may proceed on renegotiated terms.
   ``There may be a little more money on the table for the United
Cable shareholder,'' she said.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, United Cable rose 12{
cents a share to $35.25 while United Artists Communications fell 50
cents a share to $30 in national over-the-counter trading.
   Each of the companies have about 1.2 million subscribers, and the
combination would put the new company third in terms of subscribers
behind cable industry leaders Tele-Communications Inc., based in
Englewood, Colo., and American Television and Communications Corp.,
a unit of Time Inc.
   United Artists Communications also is one of the nation's biggest
motion picture operators.
   Tele-Communications owns 65.5 percent of United Artists
Communications and 23.7 percent of United Cable, and would own about
52 percent of the new company.

   Boeing Co. said Monday its profit rose 23.4
percent in the fourth quarter and 28 percent for the full year,
citing higher sales, lower federal tax rates and lower spending on
research and new-business expenses.
   Fourth-quarter earnings were $174 million, or $1.14 a share, up
from $141 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter sales rose 5 percent to $4.87 billion from $4.64
billion in 1987.
   For the year, Boeing earned $614 million, or $4.02 a share, up
from $480 million, or $3.10 a share, a year earlier.
   Sales for the year totaled $16.96 billion, 9.4 percent higher
than $15.50 billion in 1987.
   Boeing said the factors that helped boost earnings were partially
offset by ``significant performance problems'' on some military
programs, increased cost-share expenses on government contracts, and
increased costs of research, development and building up production
rates at Boeing's deHavilland Canadian subsidiary.
   Boeing set industry records in 1988 for new commercial jets
ordered: 636 planes worth about $30.1 billion. The previous records
were 461 planes ordered in 1978, and new orders valued at $20.2
billion in 1987.
   The backlog of firm orders totaled $53.6 billion at Dec. 31,
compared with $33.2 billion at the end of 1987.
   The company delivered a total of 337 commercial airplanes,
compared with 299 in 1987. Boeing plans to deliver a total of 401
planes in 1989, including 57 747s.

<BYLINE>Britain's Brewing Industry Faces Major Shake-up</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brewing industry is getting ready for a major
shake-up of the 239-year-old ``tied house'' system under which most
of Britain's 80,000 pubs are owned by brewers and generally only
sell beer made by the owner.
   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is expected to decide
Friday that the system should be relaxed so that pub operators also
can sell beers made by the owner's competitors.
   Such a decision also could invite further competition from
foreign brewers such as U.S. giant Anheuser-Busch Inc.
   There also is speculation the commission might go as far as
recommending that brewers be limited to ownership of 500 pubs each.
   The commission, which will submit the findings of its more than
two-year study to Trade Secretary Lord Young, is unlikely to
recommend blocking brewers from owning pubs altogether, the way U.S.
liquor companies are prohibited from owning bars.
   ``The idea is that there would be greater choice and cheaper beer
for consumers,'' said a spokesman for the National Licensed
Victuallers' Association, which has 18,000 tenants as members.
   Virginia Graham, a spokeswoman for the Consumers Association,
said: ``It's unrealistic to think that the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission is going to end the whole system. But I think it may make
some far reaching changes to it.''
   She added: ``We have always felt that the existence of tied pubs
does limit consumer choice.''
   Ahead of the monopolies commission's anticipated decision,
brewers already are reaching agreements to sell each other's more
successful brands as so-called ``guest beers'' through their own
pubs.
   Small brewers only have a few brands so they are eager to be able
to offer big sellers such as Bass PLC's Carling Black Label;
Fosters, which is owned by Australia's Elders IXL and also brewed by
Grand Metropolitan PLC; and Harp, owned by Guinness PLC.
   Britain's two other ``Big Six'' brewers are Allied-Lyons PLC and
Whitbread PLC.
   Beer's share of Britain's alcohol market has declined to 56
percent in 1987 from 71 percent 10 years earlier.
   Britain consumed 38 million barrels of beer in 1987, 53.8 percent
of it ale and stout, and 46.2 percent of it lager, which Americans
know as beer.
   Concurrently, competition has heated up in the brewing industry.
The monopolies commission now is reviewing a $3 billion hostile bid
by Elders for Scottish and Newcastle Breweries PLC.
   The tied house system dates to 1750 but really expanded in the
late 19th century, when brewers sought reliable outlets for their
beers and licensing authorities tried to limit the number of pubs,
the Brewers' Society said.
   At the same time, pubs turned to brewers for loans to upgrade
their premises and meet new regulatory standards requiring, for
example, bathrooms.
   About 40 percent of Britain's pubs now are tied houses, owned by
brewers and managed by tenants, according to the society. Some 20
percent are ``managed houses,'' owned by breweries and run by their
employees.
   The remaining 40 percent are so-called free houses which can buy
and sell any beer they like. But many of the free houses are enticed
with financial lures, such as favorable loans, to do business with
only one supplier.
   Predictably, the Brewers' Society, which represents most of the
nation's brewers, argues for the tied system, saying it ensures that
small brewers remain competitive with bigger rivals. It also says
the system means a tenant's investment and rent are much lower than
if he were in business by himself.
   The tenant and consumer associations said they would like to see
pubs allowed to serve more kinds of beer, but they also want the
tied system somehow maintained to protect small brewers'
independence.

   A group of rivals to International Business
Machines Corp. predicted Monday that new personal computers based on
the so-called EISA standard would be on sale by the end of 1989.
   The group's Extended Industry Standard Architecture is intended
to challenge IBM's Personal System-2 by offering some of the same
features as IBM's computers while sticking closer to the old PC
standard.
   Members of the group include Compaq Computer Corp., Tandy Corp.,
Zenith Electronics Corp. and Japan's NEC Corp.
   The group said all key aspects of the EISA specification have
been agreed upon and sent to more than 100 manufacturers and
developers. It said enegineering samples of key chips would be
available from Intel Corp. in the April-June period, and production
shipments would be available in the second half of the year.

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. has removed the Icahn millstone from
around its corporate neck, but questions remained Monday about
whether the ``new Texaco'' created in the process will be the
improved company promised by management.
   A number of analysts believe that after two years of bankruptcy
reorganization, a massive restructuring and a new weekend trce with
Carl C. Icahn, its largest shareholder, Texaco has emerged a leaner,
more efficient company.
   But there are questions about where the nation's third largest
oil concern will go from here, and the extent of the benefit to
shareholders from the latest move.
   Pressure from Icahn to boost shareholder value or face a takeover
had helped inflate the company's stock price over the last year from
about $36, on speculation that he would mount a buyout attempt.
   After a series of secret meetings with management, Icahn agreed
this weekend not to boost his 16.6 percent stake in Texaco for seven
years or to make another takeover move. Texaco in turn agreed to pay
$2.4 billion in special dividends to shareholders and to buy back
some of its stock.
   Icahn stands to gain some $300 million if the plan is approved by
shareholders.
   On Monday, Texaco fell $4.25 a share to $50.25 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading as speculators sold off their stock,
analysts said.
   The agreement restricts how Icahn can dispose of his holdings,
said Dennis O'Dea, attorney for Texaco's shareholder committee, who
believes the agreement was ``a good compromise in response to
different shareholder groups.''
   While all shareholders would receive the dividend, Sarah Teslik,
executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Council of
Institutional Investors, said she sees the agreement as a type of
``greenmail,'' because Icahn forced Texaco into a payout it
otherwise would not have made.
   Greenmail is an antitakeover maneuver in which the target company
buys back a raider's stock at a price higher than that paid to other
stockholders.
   ``If it was done for shareholders, I don't know what the
shareholder reasons are other than to get him (Icahn) off their
backs,'' said Teslik, whose trade association represents 65 large
pension funds with $300 billion in assets.
   ``It's not clear that it's in the shareholders' interests to take
money now or whether it can better be used in the long-term interest
of the company,'' said Teslik.
   Michael Young, an analyst with the investment firm Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co., said the plan, which must receive shareholder
approval, was not the preferred route of Texaco management and that
the prospect of a special dividend was orchestrated by demands from
Icahn.
   Smith Barney on Monday lowered its rating of Texaco from a buy
stock to neutral, Young said.
   ``We're hard-pressed to see how the company benefits in the
longer term,'' Young said.
   Nevertheless, many analysts and investors believe Texaco has
learned from its mistakes and that with Icahn off its back
management can focus more on the oil business.
   In the early 1980s, a struggling Texaco unable to find oil to
replace its dwindling reserves purchased the reserve-rich Getty Oil
Co. Pennzoil Co. sued claiming Texaco's acquisition interfered with
its prior contract to buy Getty.
   A Houston jury's $10.3 billion judgment against Texaco forced the
company into bankruptcy to avoid posting a potentially ruinous
multibillion dollar security bond to continue its appeals of the
award. Shareholders helped force a reluctant management to settle
with Pennzoil for $3 billion, a key element in the company's
bankruptcy reorganization.
   Almost immediately, a legion of disgruntled shareholders led by
Icahn moved to wrest control of the company, claiming management was
not doing enough to increase the value of the stock.
   That pressure, spearheaded by Icahn, led to the current
restructuring.
   Last week, Texaco completed one of the final steps in its
restructuring with the sale of its 78 percent stake in profitable
Texaco Canada Inc. for nearly $4 billion, including special
dividends. With the sale of its Deutsche Texaco A.G. for $1.2
billion and 50 percent of its refining and marketing assets to Saudi
Arabia as well as smaller properties, Texaco will collect more than
$7 billion in proceeds.
   ``I think it's going to become an operating company now,'' said
Earl Gould, portfolio manager and energy analyst with Atlantic
Richfield Co. in Los Angeles, which owns 100,000 shares of Texaco
stock.
   But while the restructuring leaves Texaco on sounder footing, it
remains to be seen whether it will be a competitor in the oil
business in the 1990s.
   ``The real dilemma for thisas to find oil. That
will determine its future value,'' Young said.

   Polaroid Corp. said Monday it planned a
$1.1 billion stock buyback and would issue $300 million in new
preferred stock to a private investor group, in what analysts
labeled defensive moves to help thwart a hostile takeover by
Shamrock Holdings Inc.
   Polaroid also indicated it had invited two members of the
investor group, Corporate Partners L.P., to join its board of
directors.
   The instant photography pioneer since July has been fighting a
hostile buyout offer from Shamrock, which now is offering $45 a
share in a tender offer that values the company at about $3.2
billion.
   Shamrock also has indicated it will wage a proxy fight for
control of Polaroid's board at the company's annual meeting in May,
and if successful would force the sale of Polaroid either under its
offer or any higher third-party bid.
   Shamrock president and chief executive officer Stanley Gold
called Polaroid's actions irresponsible and a sign of management
entrenchment.
   ``The placement of preferred stock, together with the proposed
stock buy-back program, is clearly a defensive action designed to
park even more Polaroid shares in `friendly hands' at the expense of
Polaroid's public shareholders,'' Gold said in a prepared statement.
   Polaroid closed Monday at $40.62{, up 62{ cents in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Polaroid spokesman Sam Yanes denied the stock issuance was a
defensive move designed to discourage the Burbank, Calif.-based
company's advances.
   ``It's designed simply to deliver a portion of the company's
current value while enhancing the growth prospects for its values,''
Yanes said.
   Companies frequently buy their own stock to reduce the number of
shares outstanding and raise the share price. Such practices have
become common among companies seeking to discourage a takeover.
   Some analysts said Polaroid's stock buyback was unlikely to
attract shareholders unless the market price of Polaroid stock tops
the $45 a share offer already made by Shamrock.
   ``There's no incentive for people to sell the Polaroid stock,''
said Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Bache Inc. in New
York.
   Henderson said stockholders would do better to tender their stock
to Shamrock and wait for the market price to rise. If the stock
appreciates, he said, stockholders could withdraw the tendered
shares and sell them on the open market.
   ``The catalyst to all this restructuring is Shamrock, whether
(Polaroid officials) admit it or not,'' he said.
   Peter Enderlin, an analyst with New York's Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co., predicted Polaroid's stock price would rise due to the
repurchase plan and that the company was prepared to pay more than
the $45 offered by Shamrock.
   ``Unless Shamrock comes back with another increase I think
definitely the pendulum has swung to Polaroid protecting their own
company,'' said Charles K. Ryan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets.
   The preferred stock to be issued to Corporate Partners, a firm
managed by New York investors Lester Pollack and Ali Wambold, is
convertible to common stock at a price of $50 a share.
   The group also received warrants to purchase 635,000 shares of
Polaroid common stock at $50 a share.
   Polaroid has 71.6 million common shares outstanding.
   Polaroid's board of directors last week rejected as inadequate
Shamrock's sweetened $45 offer, which includes 9.7 million shares
issued under Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan.
   Shamrock, a television and radio concern owned by the Roy E.
Disney family, is appealing a Delaware court ruling that upheld the
Polaroid employee stock ownership plan. Polaroid is incorporated in
Delaware.
   Shamrock contends the employee stock was issued specifically to
block a takeover. If the plan is invalidated, Shamrock says, it will
raise its offer to $3.36 billion, or $47 per share.

   American Brands Inc. has agreed to sell its
Southland Life Insurance Co. to GeorgiaUS Corp. for $440 million,
the companies said Monday.
   Southland, a part of American Brands' Franklin Life Insurance Co.
subsidiary, has assets valued at $1.1 billion and insurance in force

book of business and an excellent outlook, and we believe Southland
... will now be more valuable to its new owner,'' American Brands
said.
   Lynn Johnston, president and chief executive officer of
GeorgiaUS, said in a statement issued at his company's Atlanta

potential from a strong customer base.''
   GeorgiaUS is part of Nationale-Nederlanden NV, based in The

<HEAD>Dow Fourth-Quarter Earnings Soar 80 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong sales of basic chemicals and
plastics as well as industrial and consumer goods helped Dow
Chemical Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings soar nearly 80 percent, the
company said Monday.
   Dow reported earnings of $635 million, or $3.44 a share, in the
three months ended Dec. 31, up from $352 million, or $1.85 a share,
in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Sales for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up from $3.6 billion in
the year-earlier period.
   Frank Popoff, president and chief executive officer, said the
gains came from strong domestic and overseas performances in each of
Dow's four business segments.
   For all of 1988, Dow reported net income of $2.41 billion, or
$12.76 a share, up 93 percent from $1.25 billion, or $6.47 a share,
in 1987.
   Sales rose to $16.68 billion from $13.38 billion in 1987.
   In addition to basic chemicals and basic plastics, Dow makes
industrial specialities, such as Styrofoam insulation and
polycarbonate materials for uses such as auto parts.
   The company also produces consumer specialties such as plastic
wrap, glass cleaner and pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutical products
include Nicorette gum to aid in quitting smoking, and Seldane, a
non-sedating antihistamine.
   Popoff said all four business segments set income records for the
year, though detailed figures on the segments, or on Dow's
performance domestically compared with other markets, will not be
available for several days.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Order Against Tyson In Bid For Holly Farms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge issued a restraining order
against Tyson Foods Inc. on Monday, saying the company may have
violated federal securities law to gain an undue advantage over
ConAgra Inc. in their billion-dollar fight to acquire rival poultry
processor Holly Farms Corp.
   Tyson, which has offered to buy Holly Farms for $1.15 billion,
was ordered to refrain from making false, misleading, inaccurate or
incomplete statements involving Holly Farms.
   Senior Judge Richard Robinson issued the order in U.S. District
Court here at the request of Omaha-based ConAgra. Holly Farms has
agreed to be acquired by ConAgra in a $1 billion stock swap, but
invited both of its suitors to submit further bids.
   Kirk Blecha, a Tyson attorney, said the decision was being
reviewed by company lawyers.
   ``There does appear that there was a serious breach in Tyson's
obligation under federal securities law which resulted in Tyson
attaining an unfair advantage in its efforts to acquire Holly
Farms,'' Robinson said.
   He said his temporary restraining order would extend until Feb.
9, the date for a hearing on whether to make it permanent.
   ConAgra alleged that Tyson officials issued false statements in
interviews and press releases Jan. 19 and 20.
   The statements indicated Holly Farms' board had recommended
accepting Tyson's offer of $63.50 per share, ConAgra officials said.
   At the time, ConAgra said, the only tender offer before
shareholders was $60 per share.
   ConAgra said the information caused heavy trading in Holly Farms'
stock and that Holly shareholders were induced to sell their stock
prematurely. The number of shares of Holly stock tendered to Tyson
increased from nearly 1.3 million to 5 million.
   ConAgra said Holly shareholders were mistakenly tendering their
shares at $60 a share, thinking Tyson's tender offer was $63.50 per
share.
   The statements were aimed at preventing ConAgra's merger with
Memphis, Tenn.-based Holly Farms, ConAgra charged.
   Tyson, based in Springdale, Ark., said information in press
releases it issued was correct at the time it was issued, and that
at one point in its negotiations with Holly Farms, the Holly Farms
board had accepted its $63.50-per-share offer.
   The Holly Farms board later issued a statement that it would not
accept Tyson's offer of $63.50 per share.
   Tyson said ConAgra was trying to prevent Tyson from disclosing
any information about its offer to Holly.
   Robinson said his order requires only that Tyson exercise
``circumspection'' in making statements to inform shareholders and
investors.
   Tyson is the nation's largest poultry processor, while ConAgra
ranks second and Holly Farms is third.
