   Here is a glance of the key
developments in the mass exodus of East Germans to West Germany
through Hungary:
   _ Hungary announces Sunday it will allow thousands of vacationing
East Germans to leave for West Germany, and the exodus through
Austria begins shortly thereafter. Hungarian border guards at
Hegyeshalom, about 120 miles northwest of Budapest, are instructed
to let all East Germans through with only cursory checks.
   _ East German refugees, many crammed in private cars, begin
arriving in Passau, West Germany, early Monday after an all-night
drive. More than 2,000 arrive in West Germany by midday. The West
German newspaper Die Welt reports in its Tuesday edition that about
10,000 East Germans crossed into the West on Monday.
   _ East Germany's state news media Monday denounces Hungary's
action as ``illegal'' and charges that its Warsaw Pact ally ``under
the guise of humanitarism is engaging in organized smuggling of
humans.''
   _ West Germany's ZDF television network reports East German
leader Erich Honecker is in failing health after his gall-bladder
surgery three weeks ago. ZDF also says ``critics in the Politburo
reportedly are charging that Honecker misjudged the meaning and
scope of the wave of refugees.''
   _ West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a speech Monday in
Bremen, calls on his countrymen to welcome the East German refugees
and to have faith in the future of a reunified Germany.

<HEAD>Three Men Accused in Catholic Death in Belfast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two soldiers and a taxi driver
appeared in court Monday accused of killing a Roman Catholic who
allegedly was targeted after security documents were leaked to
Protestant militants.
   Both soldiers belong to the British army's locally recruited
Ulster Defense Regiment. One also was charged in the murder of a
second Catholic in June, the court heard.
   Police charged Pvt. Andrew Neville Browne, 25, with murder in the
deaths of Loughlin Maginn, 38, and barman Liam McKee, 36, shot at
his home in Lisburn south of Belfast on June 24.
   Pvt. Andrew David Smith, 29, and Edward Charles Jones, 25, a
self-employed taxi driver, were charged with murder in Maginn's
death, police told the court.
   An outlawed Protestant extremist organization, the Ulster Freedom
Fighters, claimed to have used a leaked security document to select
Maginn as their target. Gunmen broke into his home at Rathfriland,
County Down, on Aug. 25 and killed him.
   The extermists tried to back up their claim that Maginn worked
for the Irish Republican Army by producing a stolen security file,
which alleged he was a suspect.
   Maginn's family denied he was an IRA member.
   More than half the Ulster Defense Regiment's 6,500 members work
part-time, mostly in rural counties along the Irish Republic's
border, and 97 percent of them are Protestants.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to drive the British from Northern
Ireland and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
   The three accused men appeared separately at a 9-minute hearing
in Banbridge Magistrates Court, and all were were ordered held until
a further court appearance in Belfast on Sept. 22.
   All three appeared in court in handcuffs, and all have pleaded
innocent, police told magistrates.
   The three were taken to the court in Banbridge, 19 miles
southwest of Belfast, in an armored convoy of police vehicles.
   In Belfast, a judge sentenced Damien Martin Nicell, 20, to life
in prison after he was convicted of the March 21, 1988, killing of
policeman Clive Graham in Londonderry. He was also sentenced to 92
years to be served concurrently on other charges ranging from
hijacking to arson.
   In Dublin, a statement issued by Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey's Cabinet said it was ``deeply concerned'' at claims about
leaks and wanted to concentrate solely on security matters during
Friday's session of the Anglo-Irish conference.
   The meetings between Irish and British officials are held under
the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, giving the republic a say in
Northern Ireland's affairs.
   ``At this meeting, the government will be insisting on a full
review of these matters, and their far-reaching implications, with
particular reference to the role of the UDR (Ulster Defense
Regiment).''

<HEAD>Gabrielle Still Weakening; New Depression Being Watched</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout TO UPDATE with storms' 10:30 p.m. EDT position,
speed and motion; no pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gabrielle, dwindled from a hurricane to a tropical
storm, lost more its punch Monday while forecasters began watching a
new tropical depression shaping up in the area where Gabrielle got
its start.
   Gabrielle, lingering south of Nova Scotia, lost its hurricane
status late Sunday when its maximum sustained wind speed dropped
below the 74 mph minimum. By Monday evening, it had slowed to 45 mph.
   The depression, the 11th since the 1989 Atlantic Hurricane season
began June 1, formed from a tropical wave off West Africa. It had a
maximum sustained wind speed of 45 mph and was expected to reach
tropical-storm strength of 39 mph by noon Tuesday. It would be named
Hugo.
   ``This is the peak of the tropical storm season and these
tropical waves are moving off the coast of Africa every three or
four days like clockwork,'' said forecaster Max Mayfield of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Neither it nor Gabrielle posed any immediate threat to land,
although Gabrielle's wind still created unusually high surf
conditions along the southern coast of Nova Scotia and the U.S. East
Coast north of Boston.
   During the weekend, swells, undertow and waves up to 15 feet high
lashed the coast from Maine to New York, and three people apparently
drowned and at least six others were missing.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of Gabrielle was near latitude 41.0
north, longitude 60.0 west, or about 195 miles south southwest of
Sable Island, Nova Scotia. It was drifting north-northeast at about
12 mph and was expected to continue that course through the day.
   Also at 10:30 p.m., Hugo's center was near latitude 12.5 north
and longitude 31.5 west, or about 485 miles west southwest of the
southernmost Cape Verde islands, where many strong, peak-season
storms like Gabrielle are born. It was moving west at about 20 mph.
   Gabrielle was the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season and the fourth hurricane.

<HEAD>Bureau Agents to Get 10mm Pistols</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI will soon join many police departments
in arming its agents with high-capacity semi-automatic pistols,
according an interview with the director.
   The bureau's 9,700 agents will be issued 10mm pistols that can
fire at least 12 rounds before reloading, said Director William S.
Sessions in an interview Monday with reporters and editors of The
Washington Post. Currently, agents carry six-shot revolvers.
   A report on the interview appeared in Tuesday editions.
   Many police departments have switched from revolvers to 9mm
semi-automatics to match the greater firepower being deployed by
drug gangs.
   A revolver, considered by many departments more likely to fire if
contaminated with dirt, cannot hold more than five or six rounds in
the calibers needed for police use. Semiautomatics may carry many
more rounds stacked in magazines that may extend out the bottom of
the butt of the weapons.
   The interview account quoted unidentified FBI officials as saying
Sessions ordered the switch to the new firearms about three months
ago following a review that began in 1986 when two agents were
killed in a shoot-out with drug dealers in Miami. The change should
be accomplished next year.

<HEAD>Experts Restore Iraq's Oldest Islamic Monument</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Experts are restoring the spectacular
centuries-old castle of Al-Ukhaidir, a crumbling architectural
masterpiece and Iraq's oldest Islamic monument, as part of an
ambitious program to revive the nation's ancient glories.
   The $120-million restoration program also calls for the
conservation of other small palaces in the western desert, not far
from the Shiite Moslem shrines at Karbala and Najaf 100 miles south
of Baghdad, the capital.
   The restorations will make Iraq's early Arab heritage more
accessible to visitors and provide a contrast with the renowned
ancient sites of Ur, Babylon, Nimrud and Nineveh in the north of the
country, the conservators say.
   President Saddam Hussein is striving to bolster Iraq's image by
promoting its ancient greatness and its history of civilization that
dates back at least 6,000 years.
   During the 8-year war against Iran in the Persian Gulf, Saddam
portrayed Iraq as an Arab bulwark against Persian aggression by
recalling Assyrian and Babylonian victories over the Persians in the
first millenium B.C.
   Al-Ukhaidir characterizes that ancient glory. With its 48 towers
and thick walled fortifications still rising 65 feet above the
desert, it looms as a striking landmark visible for miles.
   The British scholar Gertrude Bell, who visited Al-Ukhaidir in
1909, called it ``a solitary magnificence which rose out of the
desert.''
   Two years later she concluded that the architecture was ``the
logical outcome of the period of cultural transition'' when Arabs
switched from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle.
   Historians and archaeologists differ on how old the castle is,
but agree it was built by an Arab emir or caliph in the century
after the Islamic conquest of Iraq in the mid-7th century A.D.
   ``Whoever built it, the castle testifies that the first Islamic
builders assimilated neighboring civilization ... an assimilation
which later expressed itself in a high order of artistic impulse,''
said Abdul Aattar Al-Azawi, head of the restoration team.
   The complex was built of rough stones hauled from surrounding
areas, with mud brick used for interior walls. It was coated with
gypsum, a soft white plaster, for protection against rain and the
sandstorms that still howl in from the desert.
   The palace filled most of the interior of the complex, featuring
a huge banquet hall, guest suites, guardrooms, a mosque and baths,
as well as two large assembly areas. The stairways on the walls were
broad enough for defenders to ride horses up to the battlements.
   The restorers, aided by a small army of Sudanese and Egyptian
laborers, are using traditional materials for the reconstructions,
including trunks of date-palms to replace missing roofs. Villagers
in the region still use that method in roofing their mud brick
houses.
   Al-Azawi said the castle was the ``first important structural
monument'' built by the Arabs after they established themselves in
areas formerly ruled by the Sassanian and Byzantine empires.
   ``No doubt the interaction and even borrowing from these
civilizations are still evident, but the Arab contribution can
easily be detected,'' he said.
   Warriors from the Arabian peninsula set out in the 7th century to
conquer the Sassanian empire.
   They occupied Iraq, but it was another century before the
Abbasids broke free from the Syrian-led Umaiyad dynasty and
transformed Iraq into Islam's most prosperous region.
   There are no inscriptions or records by which archaeologists can
establish the date the castle was founded. Oddly for such a
monumental building complex, Al-Ukhaidir isn't mentioned by early
Islamic poets or historians.
   Azawi is also working to piece together evidence suggesting the
castle stood at a crossroads of caravan routes across the desert,
linking trading centers in Iraq and Syria.
   When Gertrude Bell visited the castle she found Bedouin nomads
camped in the ruined palace.
   They were evicted in the 1930s when the first restorations were
made. But they still flock to the area for water from nearby springs
and wells and for pasture for their cattle.

   Neighbors who saw four youths enter an
80-year-old deaf woman's home cornered them with a shotgun, baseball
bats, hoes and rakes until police arrived, authorities said.
   The neighbors decided to act because Katie Bell's home had been
broken into five times in 1{ months, Police Chief Jerry Melton said
Monday.
   ``They said they weren't getting away this time,'' Melton said.
   A detention hearing for the four boys was scheduled for today.
   The youths entered the home several times and took money after
spotting Ms. Bell in her back yard.
   Neighbors surrounded the house after seeing four boys enter it
Saturday evening, he said.
   Some of the teen-agers were prodded from hiding places beneath
beds inside the house when neighbors poked them with hoe handles,
Melton said.
   Three boys, ages 14, 15 and 16, were taken to a detention center
in Texarkana, and a 13-year-old was held at a counseling center in
Dermott, Melton said.

<HEAD>Man Loses Bid to Share In Congressman's Estate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man claiming to be the late Rep.
Stewart B. McKinney's lover lost an attempt to share the
congressman's estate.
   Arnold R. Denson, an unemployed real estate agent living in
Georgia, said his lawyer is studying whether an appeal of Monday's
probate court decision would be filed.
   Probate Judge Earl F. Capuano ruled that McKinney's widow, Lucie,
is entitled to the $387,000 that her husband borrowed from her trust
fund at a Bridgeport bank. The ruling effectively wiped out the
Connecticut Republican's estate.
   Capuano also denied Denson's request that Mrs. McKinney be
removed as administrator of her husband's estate.
   Denson claims he was McKinney's lover for five years. McKinney
died of AIDS in 1987 during his ninth term. He left a 40-percent
share of his Washington home and a 1975 Chevrolet to Denson.
   McKinney's family has steadfastly denied he was a homosexual, and
his doctor said at the time of his death that he had contracted AIDS
from a blood transfusion after heart surgery in 1979.
   Denson, 34, said in August that he and McKinney lived together in
McKinney's Washington home and kept their relationship secret from
the congressman's family to protect them.
   Mrs. McKinney's lawyer, Lawrence J. Halloran, said he hopes
Capuano's ruling ends the matter.
   ``You pay your bills before you make gifts under the probate
law,'' he said. ``There just was no blood in this stone for Mr.
Denson.''

<HEAD>Missing Turtle Turns Up After 13 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A turtle, presumed dead for 13 years, has been
found alive and well in her compartment at a zoo in Devon, the
curator says.
   Colin Bath said Amy, an Oriental soft shell turtle who
disappeared in 1976 from Paignton Zoo, 130 miles southwest of
London, was found last week hiding in a silted pond after a gardener
spotted her stealing meat.
   ``How she survived for 12 or 13 years without food is a bit of a
mystery,'' said Bath, who described Amy as now full size with a
large, bobbing neck and a 12-inch grey, soft, pliant shell.
   Zookeepers were amazed at Amy's excellent condition especially
since the turtle's primary diet is meat and there was no meat in the
Tropical House until last week, when meat-eating birds arrived.
   They said she probably survived by stealing fruit from the bird
cages and eating the odd insect or mouse.
   Bath believes it was the lure of the meat that finally brought
Amy to their attention.
   ``She couldn't resist the diced beef, her first square meal in 13
years,'' Bath said.``So she risked the daylight raid.''
   Amy and a mate arrived at the zoo in 1973 when, Bath said, she
was probably only a couple of years old and 3 inches long.
   For the first two years the turtles lived in a grass tank where
they did not flourish.
   ``They are not the easiest creatures to keep,'' said Bath,
Paignton's curator for 25 years.
   In 1975 the Tropical House, a huge planted aviary, was opened and
the turtles were transferred to their shrub-filled compartment with
its 10-foot-square, shallow pool.
   Soon after the move the turtles, natives of Asia, disappeared.
   The fate of Amy's mate was still unclear.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel has gained the upper
hand in a tax war with Palestinians who refused to pay taxes as part
of their revolt against Israeli occupation.
   Israel's army-run civil administration has forced payment of
taxes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip by demanding proof of
tax payment for almost all official documents, ranging from birth
certificates to travel permits and export licenses.
   Soldiers and tax collectors have raided homes to seize television
sets and stereos and have seized cars at checkpoints in lieu of tax
payments.
   Makram Saad, a pharmacist in Bethlehem who has endured a series
of tax raids, said Israel's policies have only strengthened his
determination.
   ``You pay taxes to a legal government that is elected and you get
services in return,'' said Saad. ``We are getting nothing. We get
closed schools, arrests. Why should we pay to have more guns to kill
my people?''
   But Israel's determination to force tax payments has worn down a
boycott launched in early 1988 as part of a civil disobedience
campaign.
   By both Palestinian and Israeli estimates, most of the 1.7
million Arabs in the occupied lands are now paying income and sales
taxes. Underground leaflets no longer insist on compliance with the
boycott.
   An Israeli military official said more Arabs were paying taxes
now than before the Palestinian uprising, or intefadeh, that began
Dec. 8, 1987, even though Arab tax collectors quit after being
threatened by PLO groups.
   Because of a sharp decline in the economy as a result of the
uprising's strikes and boycotts, however, the army has not yet
collected enough money to finance the pre-uprising annual budget of
$239 million of the Civil Administration.
   ``In real terms. we have succeeded in coming close to what we
collected before the intefadeh, but a lot now goes to repairing
damaged buildings, utility poles, etc., and little to new
development,'' said the military official, who could not be
identified in keeping with army regulations.
   Israeli sources said Yasser Arafat's PLO had funneled at least
$200 million to the occupied territories in 1988 to compensate
Palestinians for losses. But they said the figure was only about
$100 million in 1989 because donations from Arab oil states
declined, making the continued tax boycott more difficult.
   Dr. Abdel Fattah Abu Shokor, a Palestinian economist at An Najah
University in the West Bank, estimated the gross domestic prodcut of
the occupied lands fell 20 to 30 percent in the past 20 months from
about $1.5 million in 1987. The jobless rate is also about 30
percent, up from a pre-uprising level of 10 percent.
   He estimated 60 percent of Palestinians avoided paying taxes in
1988, but conceded there was less compliance with the boycott now.
   ``The Israeli measures are not easy to avoid,'' he said.
   The Israeli military official said the tax battle continues to be
a ``real war'' even though most Palestinians are now paying taxes.
   For example, on Aug. 14, an Israeli tax collector was fatally
burned and three colleagues injured in a firebomb attack on their
car in the West Bank.
   Some Palestinians say they will not pay taxes regardless of the
pressure.
   Saad, 30, whose pharmacy is near Bethlehem's Manger Square, said
a squad of soldiers raided his home last year, seizing the family's
22-inch TV set and a 1987 Peugot 104 in lieu of tax payments.
   In the past year, tax collectors also raided his store three
times to confiscate medicine and cosmetics, finally clearing all the
shelves on July 11, he said.
   Saad estimates the raids cost him about $100,000 and said he has
spent 17 days in jail for refusing court orders to pay taxes.
   The pharmacist maintains that some of the property seized
belonged to relatives, not to him. A military official, however,
said Saad and three other pharmacists, all leftist activists,
transferred their property to relatives at the same time in an
attempt to fool tax collectors.
   What infuriated him most, Saad said, was the raid on his home in
nearby Beit Sahour, where he was ordered at gunpoint to sit in the
living room while soldiers rummaged through the house looking for
valuables to take as compensation for not paying taxes.
   ``This was an attack on my home, in front of my wife and child.
It's harder to take than confiscating things in the pharmacy. It's
where you live and sleep,'' he said.

<HEAD>Search Begins for Broadway's New Orphan Annie</HEAD>

   She must be between 3-foot-10 and 4-foot-4, sing
loudly and clearly, be able to act and tap dance, look 10 or 11
years old and, of course, not be afraid of dogs.
   The search for Broadway's new Annie began as 29 little girls
walked on stage at the Golden Theater to face Martin Charnin,
director of ``Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge,'' the new musical
about the world's most famous orphan.
   ``Why are we doing this mad thing?'' sighed composer Charles
Strouse as he prepared to listen to endless renditions of a little
melody he wrote called ``Tomorrow.'' ``We should be playing poker.''
   The girls on hand Monday morning were the first batch of
youngsters to audition for Charnin, Strouse, casting director Pat
McCorkle, choreographer Danny Daniels and others connected with the
$7 million musical that is to open March 1 on Broadway.
   Some girls waited for more than more than four hours before they
were let into the theater. The audition was open to anyone with
enough courage to be there.
   Nine-year-old Brandie Gray of Louisville, Ky., and her mother,
Teresa, arrived at the theater at 5:30 a.m. to stake out their place
in line.
   ``We got up at 3 a.m.,'' said Mrs. Gray, ``for the last leg of
the trip.''
   Right behind them was 9-year-old Jill McEachern of Jackson,
Miss., who with her mother, Carolyn, showed up at 6:30 a.m. Jill
confided she never had appeared in ``Annie,'' but ``I watched the
movie a lot.''
   Like most of the girls, Jill was not even born when the original
``Annie'' opened on Broadway in 1977. It ran 2,377 performances
before it closed in January 1983.
   The show's first star, Andrea McArdle, is now 25, married and the
mother of a year-old daughter. She last appeared on Broadway in
``Starlight Express'' in 1987.
   The first Annie ended with the nasty Miss Hannigan, the orphanage
matron, going off to prison. The sequel picks up the story six weeks
later, though producers aren't saying much about how Miss Hannigan
gets, or tries to get, her revenge.
   As the girls hoping to follow in Ms. McArdle's footsteps were
sent to the stage Monday, parents were relegated to the back of
theater where they whispered nervously.
   ``One of the things you want to get a sense of is how these kids
function by themselves without their parents,'' Charnin said. ``Some
of them instantly reveal that they are frightened to death and are
not trustworthy enough to be alone.''
   The girls were lined up across the stage, standing in front of a
yellow ribbon hung at 4 feet, 4 inches above the floor, some of them
towering above it.
   ``One of the things I learned from the last `Annie' was to cast
smaller,'' Charnin said. ``It didn't have to be younger, but it had
to be smaller. There's just so much of a hem of a dress you can let
out.'' Still, even the too-tall girls got a chance to show their
singing and dancing skills.
   Charnin described his role during the audition as ``Pied Piper
and psychiatrist. I get a sense of where their heads are and hear
their voices.''
   The girls first sang the ubiquitous ``Tomorrow'' in groups of
five. Charnin then asked each her name and age, and they got a
chance to do a couple of simple dance steps, again in groups of five.
   The moment of truth came when Charnin had the girls solo on four
bars each of ``Tomorrow.''
   ``This is the hard part,'' he told the girls. ``This is where we
have to pretend that this is not `Annie' but `A Chorus Line.''' The
girls who didn't make the cut got a thank-you and an ``Annie 2''
button.
   By midday, four youngsters had made it through the first hurdle
and got invited to come for a second look. Neither Jill nor Brandie
made the first cut.
   Charnin and company continued to look at hopefuls through the day
Monday and planned to repeat the audition process today and
Wednesday in New York and next Monday in Washington.
   ``By the end of all of this, I hope to have 25 kids who will then
take specific material that we will want them to look at, and come
back for a concerted audition,'' he said. ``From that group, our
Annie will be picked.''

   Andy Warhol is making waves in London, 2{ years
after his death. Posters with his magic name are everywhere.
   Six exhibitions devoted to the American master of pop art opened
this month. Also taking place were a retrospective of his
avant-garde films and a two-day conference on his film-making at the
National Film Theater, a six-week series of lectures at the Chelsea
School of Art and Design and, next month, a dance at Sadler's Wells
inspired by his helium-filled floating silver pillows.
   ``I cannot remember such a concentration on a single artist
before, and it reflects Warhol's stature as one of the great artists
since the Second World War,'' said Andrew Dempsey, assistant
director of the Hayward Gallery, which is staging Britain's first
comprehensive retrospective Warhol exhibition.
   The Hayward is the big draw: 183 works assembled by the Museum of
Modern Art in New York.
   Visitors streamed in as soon as the doors opened on Thursday,
even at $6.65 _ nearly as expensive as a modest theater seat in the
West End.
   The show runs through Nov. 5 and then goes to Cologne, West
Germany; Venice, Italy, and Paris.
   The Hayward works include the celebrated images of Chairman Mao,
Marilyn Monroe, Jacqueline Kennedy, Elvis Presley and Elizabeth
Taylor. There are the Campbell soup cans, the repetitive dollar
bills and the 210 Coca-Cola bottles that are all slightly different.
   There are the early paintings derived from comics, and chilling
images of the electric chair and auto and aircraft crashes.
   Other galleries are showing Warhol's drawings as a successful
commercial artist in the 1950s, the self-portraits which occupied
him from the start of his career to the last year of his life, an
exploration of his attitude toward sex, the years at the Factory
where he and his acolytes worked in New York and, at Liberty's
department store, a window display he designed for Bonwit Teller's
New York store in 1961.
   ``These six shows reflect Warhol's importance,'' said Dempsey.
   ``He made an extremely interesting contribution, not just as an
artist but as a creator and reflector of his period _ the 1960s to
the 1980s. It was not an accident _ he was quintessentially an
artist of his time.''
   Dempsey described Warhol as an extremely radical artist who could
also reach a wide public.
   ``Artists like that are rare. Clearly, he had the magic, and was
extraordinarily interesting and innovative,'' he said.
   Warhol was born in Pittsburgh on Aug. 6, 1928, of Czechoslovak
immigrant parents who had settled in the United States seven years
earlier.
   When he died, world-famous on Feb. 22, 1987, after a gall bladder
operation, he had been so successful in obscuring details of his
life that obituaries could not agree on the year of his birth, the
Hayward show notes.
   Although the Times of London reporting on Warhol this month spoke
of the ``genius of the ultimate salesman,'' the artist does not get
a unanimous chorus of acclamation.
   Peter Fuller, one of Britain's top critics and editor of the
country's most popular art journal, Modern Painters, called Warhol
``trivial, empty, banal and vacuous and therefore not worth
attending to.''

<TEXT>
   Caravans of security vehicles tear
through the streets, machine guns poke out the windows and troops
whistle to keep other cars and pedestrians away from the whirlwind.
   A limousine passes, and life in Bogota's Santander Park returns
to what passes as normal during an unprecedented war between the
government and Colombia's drug chieftans.
   ``Don't you think this is a lot of noise for nothing?'' asks
Maria, who sells sweets at a candy stand.
   ``People abroad think we're running around shooting each other,''
laments a salesman at a photo shop.
   Several people in the park, who ask only that their first name be
used, complain more of the damage the nearly monthlong showdown has
done to tourism rather than to its victims.
   ``This terrorism stuff is hurting my business,'' said Alvaro, a
man in a red cap, as he shined shoes. ``It's keeping tourists away.
But then, even petty thievery is down.
   ``Around here, you have to look ahead, because if you look behind
you, it's frightening,'' he said, laughing.
   Other Bogota residents try to joke or shrug their way through the
wave of bombings, shootings, arson and other drug-linked violence
terrorizing this South American republic.
   In middle and upper class neighborhoods, many parents keep their
children out of school, and restaurants report business is down by
40 percent.
   Most violence is in Medellin, 150 miles northwest of the capital,
where bombs have gone off in restaurants, factories and shops.
   But despite the headlines, life in this bustling city hasn't much
changed _ except for the police motorcades and the resulting traffic
jams.
   In a seedy section of town, prostitutes as young as 12 sell their
bodies for as little as 50 cents.
   Pickpockets and the ever-present ``gamines'' _ as the street
children are called _ still prey on unsuspecting pedestrians and, of
course, tourists in this city of 6 million.
   The few visitors at traditional tourist attractions arrive in
charter buses. They hurriedly enter and exit, back to the safety of
the bus.
   In the Gold Museum, where a wealth of pre-Colombian artifacts
lure thousands of visitors every year, business is down 30 percent,
said a ticket seller who didn't want his first name known ``for
security reasons.''
   Employes from other museums agree.
   Santander Park is filled with its usual characters: the old
snake-handler doing tricks with his defanged pet, the ``scar man''
who rolls on a bed of glass, the native Indians selling blankets and
ponchos.
   Dressed in a white guayabera tropical shirt, a fortune teller
sitting on a chair brags he can tell the future and starts to spark
the interest of onlookers when, suddenly, the circle around him
breaks up. He is removed, hands pinned behind his back, to a remote
corner of the park.
   He's accused of stealing a policeman's wallet.
   ``This is part of everyday life,'' Alvaro said.
   In the northern residential sector, site of yuppies, BMW's and
discos, the good life appears to go on, with many outdoor cafes and
restaurants brimming with well-dressed young customers.
   Entrance is only restricted at government buildings, where
soldiers search visitors and packages, apologizing for the
incovenience.
   ``Sir,'' said one young soldier, ``here in Colombia, we all want
this to end.''

<HEAD>`Uncle Buck' Still No. 1; `Kickboxer' Opens Strongly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Uncle Buck'' was the No. 1 moneymaker in the
nation's theaters for the fourth consecutive weekend. The
independently distributed ``Kickboxer'' made a strong debut in third
place.
   Universal's ``Uncle Buck,'' which stars John Candy as an
obnoxious relative brought in to supervise his two nieces and a
nephew, grossed $4.6 million, according to figures released Monday
by Exhibitor Relations Co.
   Director Ron Howard's ``Parenthood,'' the family comedy with
Steve Martin, Jason Robards, Mary Steenburgen and Rick Moranis,
finished in second with sales of $4.4 million.
   The martial-arts film ``Kickboxer,'' starring Jean-Claude Van
Damme and distributed by Cannon, finished a surprising third on
revenues of $4.1 million. It was followed by the romantic comedy
``When Harry Met Sally...,'' which collected $3.1 million.
   Falling into fifth place and losing momentum with $2.9 million
was the underwater adventure epic ``The Abyss.'' After five weeks of
release, ``The Abyss'' has now netted $44.6 million and has yet to
recoup its production costs.
   ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' reuniting Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as
unconventional police officers, came in sixth with $2.6 million.
   In seventh was the acclaimed character study ``sex, lies and
videotape,'' which earned $2.14 million last weekend.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Turner &amp; Hooch,'' in eighth with
$2.12 million, ``Batman'' in ninth with $1.9 million, and
``Relentless' in 10th on $1.4 million.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.

   Preliminary peace talks between the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front and Ethiopian officials on Monday neared
the end of their fourth day at the Carter Center.
   Center spokeswoman Carrie Harmon said the delegations met
separately Monday morning before reconvening in the afternoon for
further talks at the center. She said the two sides would resume
discussions again Tuesday.
   On Sunday, the chief of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
said he was optimistic that the discussions in Atlanta would end
soon, but he said there were were still several points prolonging
the talks.
   Isaias Afwerki said that although Eritreans ``have reason to
believe they are getting close to a solution,'' another round of
negotiations for the end of the 28-year war in the Horn of Africa is
unlikely for several months.
   ``If we agree and finish these preliminary negotiations, we will
want to go back to Eritrea and do our homework for the next phase of
the process,'' Afwerki said Sunday. ``There should be enough time
for everyone to prepare their positions.''
   With former President Jimmy Carter acting as a neutral observer,
the visiting Ethiopian and Eritrean delegations are trying to map a
plan for future peace talks.
   In the war over the independence of Eritrea, an estimated 1
million people have died in combat or in the famine that has
resulted from blocked delivery of relief supplies.

   After six years of what he calls ``the
clandestine thing,'' Al Pacino is returning to public view.
   The star of the two ``Godfather'' films and ``Dog Day Afternoon''
says in Vanity Fair magazine's October issue that he spent much of
the past six years in dark glasses, false moustaches and disguised
stage roles.
   Out of sight since filming ``Scarface'' in 1983, Pacino stars in
the upcoming romantic thriller, ``Sea of Love,'' with Ellen Barkin,
and plays a surprisingly lighthearted cameo as the bad guy in Warren
Beatty's ``Dick Tracy.''
   He also has agreed to play the Michael Corleone for the third
time after director Francis Ford Coppola told Pacino he'd come up
with a new concept for the third ``Godfather'' film. Diane Keaton,
with whom Pacino has had a relationship for several years, again
will play Corleone's estranged wife.
   Pacino, 49, said he relished his time in disguise. ``There's a
feeling that you experience when you put on glasses and a moustache
and you blend in,'' he told the magazine. ``I felt so free. I was
excited.''

   Actress Jamie Lee Curtis says motherhood, a happy
marriage and a satisfying career have given her ``the life I have
always wanted.''
   But getting there wasn't easy, she says in Redbook magazine's
October issue. Among the difficulties, she recalled, was having
famous parents.
   When she was in seventh grade, her father was arrested for
marijuana possession and her schoolmates taunted her with the words:
``You're father's Tony Curtis and your mother's Janet Leigh, your
father just got busted but your mother still is free.''
   Ms. Curtis' career got off to a rocky start with some ill-fated
television shows. After playing the screaming baby sitter in two
``Halloween'' movies, she starred in a big-budget movie with John
Travolta, ``Perfect,'' that bombed.
   After starring in a few smaller films, Ms. Curtis came into her
own as a comedian in ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' in which she played a
sexy con artist.
   Ms. Curtis, 30, is married to actor Christopher Guest, with whom
she has an adopted daughter. ``I have a family I love and the kind
of work I like to do,'' she said. ``Everyday I tell myself, `I did
it!'''

   Isabelle Adjani thinks one actress has cornered
the market on English-speaking roles that require foreign accents.
   ``Meryl Streep is the most effective customs and immigrations
officer,'' the French actress says in Vanity Fair's October issue.
``She stands there and says, `You can't come in _ I'll do the
accent.'''
   Adjani's latest film, ``Camille Claudel,'' was the biggest film
in France last year and opens in this country in December.
   The 31-year-old actress won a Cesar, the French equivalent of the
Oscar, for portraying Claudel, the mistress, muse and competitor of
French sculptor Rodin. Claudel was a formidable sculptress and
artist herself, but her stern Catholic family had her committed to
an insane asylum for the last 30 years of her life.

   The Lyric Opera of Chicago role originally
assigned to operatic superstar Luciano Pavarotti this fall has been
split between his fellow Italian Giuseppe Giacomini and Icelandic
tenor Kristjan Johannsson.
   Pavarotti was scheduled to perform the role of painter and
revolutionary Mario Cavaradossi in the Lyric's season premiere of
Giacomo Puccini's ``Tosca'' on Saturday opposite soprano Eva Marton
in the title role. But he cancelled his Chicago appearances,
pleading illness.
   Lyric General Manager Ardis Krainik said Monday that Pavarotti,
who has cancelled 26 of his 41 scheduled Lyric appearances in recent
years, would no longer be welcomed by the company.

   Officials have located a politically
correct dog to sniff out drugs: a gentle spaniel.
   Last May, City Council reversed a long-standing policy against
using dogs to fight crime. But the council refused to allow dogs
such as German sheherds, which stirred memories of attacks on
civil-rights workers in the South.
   The city had trouble finding a small dog until its search made
news last month and offers began pouring in.
   The sweet-tempered spaniel will be flown in from Southern
California on Tuesday and will attend the City Council meeting that
night, city spokeswoman Peggy Sullivan said.
   The spaniel's specific breed will be a secret until then, she
said.
   Berkeley officials are pleased about finding the drug-sniffing
spaniel, Sullivan said, because it ``maintains the city's commitment
to a humanitarian approach'' in the drug war.

   When Dr. Mitchell Bush talks to the animals at
the National Zoo, they run for cover.
   ``I don't think there's any animal in the zoo that likes me,''
the zoo's chief veterinarian says ruefully.
   The same furry creatures that would have nuzzled the jovial
Doctor Doolittle cringe in fright when Bush appears, even though he
fought a valiant but unsuccessful round-the-clock battle last
weekend to save the life of the zoo's newest panda cub.
   Hsing-Hsing, the zoo's giant male panda, ``knows my voice,'' Bush
said. But when Bush starts talking, Hsing-Hsing lumbers down to his
moat and paces worriedly back and forth.
   Cheeky orangutans who cadge soft drinks from zoo visitors
scramble for safety when Bush shows up. The great apes, he says, can
spot him in a crowd of several hundred tourists and squeeze into a
blind corner in their cage, out of harm's way.
   ``My colleagues ask me, `how can you practice if none of your
patients likes you?''' Bush said.
   ``I don't relish being the villain, but that's just a fact of
life. I've become used to it. The reality of performing my job is
that it's not conducive to making friends with the animals.''
   A friendlier cageside manner might help, Bush concedes. But let's
face it, he says. Who can blame the animals? Who would you prefer?
The veterinarian with his probing fingers and hypodermic needles? Or
the keeper who brings food, maid service and small talk into the
cage?
   ``Most animals like their keepers,'' Bush says.
   A big, bearded bear of a Californian, Bush, 48, came to the
National Zoo from the faculty of Johns Hopkins Medical School early
in 1972, just before Hsing-Hsing and his panda mate, Ling-Ling,
arrived from China as a gift to President Nixon for the American
people.
   Over the years, Bush has presided over most of Ling-Ling's
heartbreaking attempts to breed successfully in captivity. She has
lost five cubs since 1983, most of them victims of their mother's
recurring kidney or uterine infections.
   The latest cub, an unnamed male, died last Sunday after 39 hours
of fighting an infection transmitted by Ling-Ling. Assisted by a
dozen or more zoo veterinarians and pediatric specialists from
nearby Children's Hospital, Bush injected the premature cub with
antibiotics and a serum containing Hsing-Hsing's antibodies to
bolster its fragile immune system.
   The cub, which weighed only 3.1 ounces at birth, was removed from
its 250-pound mother and placed in an oxygen-rich incubator. There
it was fed a special formula through a tube into its stomach and
cuddled by a rubber glove filled with warm water to simulate
Ling-Ling's motherly paw.
   ``Every effort was made to pull this cub through its illness,''
said zoo director Michael Robinson.
   Bush says the giant panda couple probably will be mating early
next spring, and once again he'll be crossing his fingers.
   Meanwhile, Bush is working seven days a week treating everything
from elephants and rhinos to tiny hairy-footed hamsters. ``It seems
like one thing after another,'' he says.
   Among his more memorable challenges were performing a root canal
on a polar bear and playing midwife to a pregnant bongo, an African
forest antelope that tips the scales at 600 pounds and requires
three operating tables to lie on. ``A very stressful procedure,''
Bush says.
   Of all his animals, Bush says the bears are his happiest
patients. ``Bears just seem to go on and on and on, and they never
give us any problem,'' he said. The most difficult to treat are
giraffes, which tower 16 to 18 feet and risk injury or death when
they fall to the ground under anesthesia, even with ropes erected as
a safety net.
   How does he treat a giraffe for a sore throat?
   ``With benign neglect,'' Bush replied. ``You very rarely hear a
giraffe get vocal, except when they're young. I haven't heard them
say a thing, so I assume there's no complaint.''

<TEXT>
   Crying, laughing and cheering with
happiness, thousands of East Germans poured across the border into
Austria early Monday after Hungary broke with a Soviet bloc ally and
let them emigrate.
   They began driving across the border at midnight as Hungary,
ending a weeks-long diplomatic stalemate, removed the frontier
barriers to allow more than 7,000 East German refugees to escape to
the West.
   The largest mass emigration of East Germans to West Germany since
the Berlin Wall went up in 1961 began after Hungary announced Sunday
evening that it would allow them to leave for West Germany, their
final destination.
   The first East German cars arrived in Passau, a West German city
on the Austrian border, nine hours later. Most carried young couples
or families with babies or toddlers.
   Some refugees said they were heading for one of several nearby
tent communities set up more than a week ago by West German Red
Cross workers. Others planned to seek shelter with relatives as far
away as Hamburg.
   Hungary on Sunday became the first East bloc government to help
the citizens of another Communist country freely leave their
homeland, for which East Germany promptly accused Budapest of
``directly interfering'' in its internal affairs.
   ``The Hungarian government has chosen to illegally allow East
German citizens to travel to West Germany in violation of
international treaty,'' the state-run news agency ADN said.
   It said Hungary, ``under the guise of humanitarianism, has
engaged in the organized smuggling of human beings.''
   West Germany, which offers East Germans automatic citizenship and
help getting settled, said Hungary made a ``humanitarian'' decision.
It had refugee camps set up in Bavaria just over a week ago to
handle the expected influx.
   At this frontier town 120 miles northwest of the Hungarian
capital, border guards gave only cursory checks to East Germans.
   As the first groups crossed, hundreds of others waited in their
cars, forming growing lines at the main border crossings.
   And as the first convoys made they way across the border, new
East German arrivals were reported by Hungarian and West German
volunteers at several Hungarian camps used to house and marshall the
refugees since mid-August.
   An estimated 60,000 East Germans were in Hungary when the exodus
began.
   Eight of 18 lanes at the Hegyeshalom crossing were open as the
jubilant East Germans drove through. They honked their horns,
cheered and whistled, releasing emotions pent up by days and weeks
of waiting for a decision by Hungarian authorities.
   Some refugees waved bottles of foaming champagne from the car
windows.
   Austrian customs officials said more than 2,000 East Germans in
cars had crossed into Austria over six entry points in the first
five hours of the mass exodus. Others arrived at the border by bus
and train.
   ``It's wonderful, it's terrific,'' refugees shouted to reporters
and border guards. One man, overcome with emotion, tried to smile as
tears rolled down his cheeks and couldn't speak.
   Dozens of people who had taken taxis from Budapest waited to
cross into Austria on foot. A group of youths among them held up a
sign saying, ``Give it up Erich!'' referring to East German
Communist leader Erich Honecker.
   Once on the Austrian side of the massive border barrier, many
East Germans jumped from their cars and danced with joy.
   In a small tent on the Austrian side, Red Cross workers handed
out steaming cups of tea, crackers and maps showing the quickest way
to the West German border to anyone who asked.
   Crowds of Austrians gathered to welcome the emigres, cheering and
clapping as each car passed. A woman stood at the roadside holding
up a sign offering free beds for a refugee family with children.
   A statement Sunday by the official Hungarian news agency MTI
said: ``Hungary has decided to make it possible for the East German
citizens staying in Hungary and refusing to return home to leave to
any country which is prepared to let them through or receive them.''
   ``Interior Minister Istvan Horvath instructed the police and
border guards to let East German citizens leave Hungary with their
East German travel documents'' at any border point.
   The Hungarian foreign minister, Gyula Horn, suggested on
Hungarian TV that tens of thousands of other East Germans now
vacationing in Hungary might join the exodus.
   To make the exodus possible, he said, Hungary decided to suspend
a 1969 agreement with East Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally, saying
Hungary should not take into account West Germany's claim to East
Germans.
   The fate of the refugees had been discussed for weeks by East and
West Germany, with Hungary insisting it was primarily a bystander
interested in seeing a solution. The communique said, ``The talks
between East Germany and West Germany ended in failure.'' It did not
elaborate.
   ``There are about 60,000 East Germans now in Hungary,'' Horn said
in the television interview, referring to thousands who have not
registered with the West German Embassy in Budapest to leave and are
formally in Hungary as vacationers.
   ``I cannot tell you how long it will last, but it surely won't be
(just) for an hour,'' Horn said when asked how long the refugees
would be allowed to leave simply by showing their East German
passports to Hungarian border guards.
   Austrian television said a special Hungarian train carrying only
East German refugees had left from a camp in southwestern Hungary
for the border late Sunday and four more trains would follow.
   In Frankfurt, West Germany, Federal Railways spokesman Klaus
Vollmer said that his Austrian counterparts moved 50 railway cars,
with room for 90 people in each, to border points with Hungary.
   Also, 40 West German railroad cars were moved to Passau and
Freilassing, two Bavarian cities near the Austrian border, and 70
Austrian buses were standing by, Vollmer said.
   ``This is a humanitarian decision and an act of European
solidarity. I am deeply thankful to the Hungarian government,''
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said in Bonn.
   The refugee problem was a difficult one for Hungary, which wanted
to show it is committed to Western concepts of human rights but
reluctant to anger hard-line Communist leaders in East Berlin.
   Hungary recently began implementing democratic reforms similar to
those being adopted by Poland and the Soviet Union, but East Germany
has not.
   Hungary's reform course has also caused tensions with
Czechoslovakia and Romania, two other hard-line Soviet bloc
countries.
   About 6,000 East Germans had already fled their communist
homeland this summer by crossing from Hungary, where they were
vacationing, to Austria. Budapest began dismantling border
fortifications in May in keeping with its new commitment to human
rights and more democracy.

<HEAD>Rushdie Sees U.S. As Land `Hungry for Gods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie, the author who was driven into
hiding by a death threat from Moslem extremists, describes the
United States in a newly published book review as a ``secular nation
hungry for gods.''
   Rushdie, in the latest of his occasional reviews for The Observer
weekly since he was forced out of sight in February, on Sunday
praised the new novel ``Billy Bathgate'' by American author E.L.
Doctorow.
   The story of the rise and fall of gangster Dutch Shultz is told
by the young narrator Billy Bathgate, an apprentice.
   ``A secular nation hungry for gods, America made of men like the
Dutchman, dark deities in whom it desparately wanted to believe, as
15-year-old Billy ... wants to believe in Shultz,'' he wrote.
   ``But what America loves most, needs most, more than light or
darkness, more than gods or demons, is the myth of itself.
   ``Mythical America, its writers tell us constantly, is the real
America, and myth demands, among other things, that heroes fall as
well as rise. Billy Bathgate is the story of the Dutchman's long,
last dive,'' said the review.
   Rushdie called the novel Doctorow's ``most brilliant proof'' to
date of the fact that American novelists have always been more ready
than their European counterparts to demonstrate that the art of
literature can adopt the form of popular entertainment without
losing an iota of seriousness.''
   Rushdie's own novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' drew him a ``death
sentence'' from the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran for
alleged blasphemy of Islam.
   Rushdie was forced into hiding with a $5.2 million bounty on his
head and given police protection. His American wife, Marianne
Wiggins, who is also a writer, said last month that they had
separated because of the strain.

<HEAD>Eritreans Optimistic, But Says Fighting Would Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front says he is optimistic about the conclusion of preliminary
peace talks, but the civil war in Ethiopia probably would continue.
   Isaias Afwerki said although Eritreans ``have reason to believe
they are getting close to a solution,'' another round of
negotiations to end the 28-year war is unlikely for several months.
   ``If we agree and finish these preliminary negotiations, we will
want to go back to Eritrea and do out homework for the next phase of
the process,'' Afwerki said Sunday. ``There should be enough time
for everyone to prepare their positions.''
   Ethiopia's delegation did not have any immediate comment. Since
the talks began Thursday, there has been little public comment by
either side.
   With former President Carter acting as an observer, the
delegations are trying to arrange future peace talks.
   The Eriteans are fighting for independence from the east African
country. During the war, an estimated 1 million people have died in
combat or in the famine that has resulted from blocked delivery of
relief supplies.
   Afwerki said that even though Carter has discussed the
possibility of a cease-fire, the EPLF probably would continue
fighting until substantive negotiations begin.
   The groups took a break from the negotiations Sunday, although
Carter Center spokeswoman Carrie Harmon said the former president
met privately with both delegations.
   She said the talks would continue through Tuesday, although
Afwerki said they may last three or four more days.

<HEAD>Flag-Burning Legislation Stands Good Chance of Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outrage over the Supreme Court's flag-burning
decision is subsiding, but legislation to undo the ruling still
stands an excellent chance of approval in Congress, lawmakers say.
   ``If you vote against this law, they could say you're for burning
of the flag,'' said Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., voicing the
concern of many lawmakers that the issue remains potent despite
evidence the uproar that greeted the June 21 ruling has subsided.
   Even though House and Senate leaders expect legislation to pass,
many lawmakers who spent August at home on recess say they heard
little about the issue from constituents.
   ``My constituents couldn't care less about a superficial issue
like flag-burning,'' said Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y.
   Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., said the matter was ``an abstraction to
most people. I doubt you can find one person in a million who has
witnessed someone desecrating the flag.''
   But many Americans, particularly veterans' groups, are still
angry. ``People are incensed,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.
``They still want to see action quickly.''
   In its 5-4 ruling, the court overturned a Texas law under which a
protester was charged for burning a flag at the 1984 Republican
National Convention in Dallas.
   With legislation to protect the flag ready to begin moving
through Congress this week, the only question appeared to be whether
Congress would submit a constitutional amendment to the states for
ratification in addition to widely expected passage of a law.
   An amendment would have to be approved by a two-thirds majority
of the House and Senate and by 34 of the 50 states, while a law
requires simple majority votes of the House and Senate and the
president's signature.
   The proposed law, on which House debate begins Tuesday, would
impose unspecified fines and up to a year in prison for anyone who
``knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns or tramples upon any flag of
the United States.''
   Democratic leaders say enactment of a law could defuse a
potential political bombshell without eroding First Amendment
rights, although civil libertarians and the American Bar Association
say the proposed law is still too restrictive.
   But President Bush and other Republican leaders, backed by
veterans' groups including the American Legion, say they doubt the
legislation would survive a court challenge. They are pushing a
constitutional amendment.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has scheduled a Senate
vote on the amendment for Oct. 16. In the House, Republicans and
Democrats were exploring a tradeoff in which the leadership would
allow a vote on the constitutional amendment and the GOP minority
would drop plans to oppose the statute.
   While Republicans appeared to view the issue as a political plus,
many Democrats voiced discomfort at the prospect of having negative
votes on the statute or the amendment used against them in future
campaigns.
   ``My sense is that people are concerned that Republicans will use
the issue in the same unprincipled but politically effective way in
which they used the Pledge'' of Allegiance against Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis last year, said Rep. Ted Weiss,
D-N.Y.
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., chairman of the House GOP campaign
committee, said Democrats have good reason to worry. ``I'd like to
see a lot of Democrats voting against (the amendment) because I do
think it would make them vulnerable,'' he said.
   Democrats who vote for the statute but against the constitutional
amendment would not be immune from attacks, Vander Jagt said,
adding, ``They would have voted against the only viable solution,
the only real way to protect the flag.''
   But some Democrats say they believe most voters would be
satisfied with a statute.
   ``I think the momentum to build up to a constitutional amendment
has diminished substantially,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla. ``A
statute will suffice. Even veterans' groups ... are telling me right
now they think a statute's sufficient.''

<HEAD>Budget Disputes Straining Bush-Congress Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relations between President Bush and Congress _
cordial so far _ are showing the first major signs of strain in
mounting disputes over how to finance his anti-drug plan and a host
of other programs.
   With two key budget deadlines fast approaching, Congress has yet
to vote a dime for any Bush proposal other than an emergency savings
and loan rescue plan.
   By week's end, Bush, who promised ``an age of the offered hand''
in January, was railing at ``carping'' Democrats, accusing critics
of losing the war on drugs and issuing campaign-like statements
slamming Democrats for wanting to raise taxes.
   For their part, Democrats accused the president of tossing out a
multitude of costly proposals without proposing realistic ways to
pick up the tab.
   With the unveiling of his $7.9 billion anti-drug initiative last
week, the president essentially completed his first-year's
legislative agenda.
   Some further items are still expected: a $1.9 billion five-year
high-tech computer program, a food safety package, a set of
incentives to encourage adoptions, and an assortment of minor
measures.
   But the president has now put forth the bulk of the major issues
he raised during last year's campaign and showcased in his February
budget outline to Congress.
   He has sent Capitol Hill major proposals on education, crime,
drugs, clean air, child care, capital gains taxes, strategic
weapons, ethics and foreign aid.
   ``We've got a lot of balls in the air,'' conceded Frederick D.
McClure, who as Bush's assistant for legislative affairs must try to
shepherd the proposals through the congressional labyrinth.
   McClure said the White House will step up its lobbying efforts in
the days ahead because of the anticipated fiscal crunch.
   Although the start of fiscal 1990 is but three weeks away,
Congress still has not enacted any of the 13 appropriations bills
required to fund the government. As of Friday, the Senate had acted
on only five of the measures.
   That raises the prospect of another sprawling catchall bill that
both the administration and congressional leaders say they hope to
avoid.
   Furthermore, hard on the Oct. 1 deadline for funding the
government is an Oct. 15 deadline for acting to avoid mandatory
spending cuts that will be triggered by the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing bill.
   Congress approved a $1.2 trillion budget for 1990 that carries
out an April agreement between the White House and Congress calling
for $28 billion in savings to get the fiscal 1990 deficit down to
$100 billion _ the target of the budget-balancing law.
   Any projected deficit over $110 billion will trigger automatic
across-the-board cuts in all federal programs on Oct. 15.
   Since that April budget agreement, Congress and the
administration have had few discussions on budget policy; still,
billions of dollars in additional spending has been proposed in Bush
administration initiatives.
   ``The problem is whether this is all fiction or reality,'' said
Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   In addition to formal Bush proposals since the April budget
accord, Bush has thrown out a number of other tidbits, including a
proposal for a manned space flight to Mars and another moon landing.
   ``If there is a serious effort to make some of these efforts
real, then Congress is going to have a tough time coming up with the
funding to be able to support these initiatives,'' Panetta said.
   In many ways, Panetta said, despite the ``kinder and gentler''
rhetoric, the Bush administration is harder to deal with on budget
issues than was the Reagan administration.
   ``Reagan was much more direct on the stuff. Bush gets awfully
wishy washy,'' Panetta said. ``I think President Bush identifies the
areas of need; but then when you look behind every initiative,
there's nothing there.''
   Is Bush's honeymoon over?
   ``I don't believe it's over,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan. ``I think the president is going to stay right in
there. He's going to continue to provide the leadership.''

   Jewish leaders are backing Frederick V. Malek
for a White House role after hearing the business executive's
apology for an incident in the Nixon administration with
anti-Semitic overtones.
   The White House said Sunday that President Bush wants Malek to
run next year's economic summit of Western industrialized nations,
expected to be held in Texas.
   Malek, 51, a central player in three major business deals this
year, including the nearly $4 billion takeover of Northwest
Airlines, said he still must make arrangements with his partners
before taking on the part-time White House post.
   But Malek has cleared one possible hurdle in a series of private,
fence-mending meetings with leaders of major Jewish organizations.
   Malek said he both explained and apologized for his role in the
1971 incident in which he complied with a Richard Nixon request to
find out how many top Bureau of Labor Statistics officials were Jews.
   Malek resigned as a top Bush campaign adviser and deputy
Republican chairman last Sept. 11 after reports about the memo
resurfaced.
   He denied charges of anti-Semitism, but said then he was
relinquishing his posts ``because of my belief that nothing should
interfere with the vice president's victory in November.''
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations, said Malek ``made a mistake 18
years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by President
Nixon.''
   But Reich added that Malek ``has taken pains to assure the Jewish
community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm. I
believe he is sincere ... and that he intends to serve the president
and the country with integrity and with respect for all Americans.
We wish him good luck in his new assignment.''
   ``He did make one mistake and he's apologized for it,'' said
Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith. ``I think he's put it behind him.''
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said: ``The president has
spoken to Fred Malek about (the summit post). The president would
like him to do it. No final decisions have been made. We do expect
it to occur.''
   Malek, 51, who ran last year's Republican convention in New
Orleans, said he wrote the memo only after ignoring several earlier
demands from Nixon for the information.
   Nixon had complained to aides that a ``Jewish cabal'' within the
bureau was trying to undermine his economic policies, and demanded
to know how many top officials were Democrats and Jews.
   Malek said he provided the data on Democrats after a check of
voter registration rolls, but balked at fulfilling the rest of
Nixon's query.
   ``I refused four times,'' Malek said Sunday. ``The fifth time he
came back and gave me a direct order through (chief of staff H.R.)
Haldeman, so I gave him a number.''
   ``I regret my compliance. It was a mistake,'' said Malek, a West
Point graduate who was a special assistant to Nixon in 1970-73 and
then deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget until
1975.
   ``I don't think anyone has ever found any shred of evidence of
bigotry or anti-semitism in my life, except this footnote,'' Malek
said in a telephone interview from his McLean, Va., home.
   Before accepting Bush's offer, Malek said he first must make sure
his other business obligations allow him to take on the job of
summit coordinator and that there are no conflicts of interest.
   Malek is a former Marriott Corp. executive and president of
Marriott Hotels.
   In addition to the Northwest Airlines takeover, he was a
principal in two other recent major business deals: the purchase of
Coldwell Banker's commercial real estate operations from Sears for
$300 million and the $800 million sale of Marriott's airline
catering business to Malek and executives of the catering division.
   Bush attended a party at Malek's home overlooking the Potomac
last month to mark the first anniversary of the GOP convention.
   The last summit was in Paris in July. Bush is believed intent on
holding the next in Texas _ probably San Antonio or Houston _ in
late spring. Neither the date nor site is firmly set.

<HEAD>Evacuation of US Embassy in Beirut Won't Affect Intelligence, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon
will have little effect on Washington's ability to gather
information about American hostages because the diplomats had been
isolated for months, experts say.
   Since civil war erupted full-force in Lebanon in early March,
diplomats at the embassy in Christian-controlled East Beirut were in
contact with Moslem-controlled West Beirut only by telephone, said
George Malleck, a State Department spokesman.
   The eight American captives in Lebanon are believed to be held by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems, all linked to the Hezbollah umbrella
group.
   Another State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the diplomats were ``limited in their movements'' in
Lebanon, confined primarily to the embassy compound and their
apartments.
   Neil Livingstone, a private consultant who has written
extensively about the hostages, said it was doubtful embassy
personnel had much to do with the hostage situation. ``The options
and decisions to be made are done in Washington. They are done at a
high level,'' he said.
   Any indirect contacts with hostage-holders or their Iranian
sponsors usually take place in European capitals, he said.
   Ambassador John McCarthy and 29 American diplomats were evacuated
by helicopter Tuesday.
   On Friday, McCarthy met with Secretary of State James A Baker III
to discuss the situation in Lebanon where heightened hostilities
have claimed the lives of 827 people over the last six months. U.S.
diplomats fled, first shredding documents and destroying electronic
coding equipment, after Christian factions besieged the embassy,
claiming that the Americans had not done enough to protect from the
Syrian army and its Moslem allies.
   Thomas Cicippio of Norristown, Pa., the brother of hostage Joseph
Cicippio, said the family had heard nothing about the captives, but
they were worried. ``We just have to keep our fingers crossed,'' he
said.
   Joseph Cicippio's wife, a Lebanese-born woman employed at the
embassy, continued to work with other foreign nationals who stayed
to run the embassy compound, officials said. Thomas Cicippio said he
had not been in touch with his sister-in-law because of the
difficulty in making telephone calls. Regular mail service also is
sporadic.
   The American aid program, most of it consisting of food and other
supplies, is in the hands of local private voluntary organizations.
The program totalled about $16 million in the fiscal year that ends
this month.
   Cicippio, 58, was threatened with death, but granted a reprieve
in early August, shortly after a group calling itself the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth released a videotape showing
Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in a noose. American officials confirmed
the picture showed Higgins, but his corpse has not been returned.
   Livingstone said the hostages are moved around among various safe
houses, probably no more than a dozen, operated by the captors. At
different times, the hostages reportedly have been held in the
southern suburbs of Beirut and in the Bekaa Valley, northeast of
Beirut.
   President Bush focused on the hostage issue in early August after
the death of Higgins, prompting a flurry of optimism about their
possible release. When none were released, the Bush administration
took another tack, announced that it would lower the decibel on
discussions about the hostages.
   ``We would like to lower our voices a little and let these issues
play out for a few days and see what happens,'' Bush spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said on Aug. 11.
   In an interview published Tuesday in The Washington Post, Sheik
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual leader of the Shiite
Moslems in Lebanon, said Bush would have to make the first gesture
of good will toward Iran.

<HEAD>Government Will Decide if Valdez Cleanup Adequate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will have the final word next
spring on whether Exxon has adequately cleaned up the
11-million-gallon oil spill caused by one of its tankers in Alaska,
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly says.
   ``There's a lot still to do,'' Reilly said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet
the Press'' program. ``Exxon is going to have to go back in the
spring, as they intend to do, and survey what the problems are and
if there's remaining work to do, to do it.''
   If the government determines more cleanup is necessary and Exxon
refuses to go along, the EPA chief said, ``We'll take the road which
has always been open which is to undertake the direct cleanup
ourselves and to bill Exxon for the cost.''
   The company has announced it is pulling out thousands of cleanup
workers this week because of the limited daylight and rough weather
of Alaska's early winter.
   Exxon has been in disagreement with state and federal agencies
over the adequacy of the company's cleanup efforts since the Exxon
Valdez struck a reef in Prince William Sound on March 24, spilling
nearly 11 million gallons in the nation's worst crude oil spill.
   The company says it has treated more than 1,000 miles of
shoreline and only four miles remain to be treated. State
authorities say the company is overstating the work it has done and
is leaving before the job unfinished.
   Reilly defended Exxon's decision to withdraw its cleanup workers
now. ``My sense is that the weather is such there that it would be
very risky to leave a lot of those folks in that exposed position,''
he said.

<HEAD>Debate Heats Up Over Political Ambassadorial Appointees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among State Department officials, there is no
shortage of anecdotes about the moral and intellectual shortcomings
of political activists who won prestige assignments as ambassadors.
   Some of the more noteworthy tales:
   _One recent ambassador to a European country had his bedroom
covered with mirrors. He often frolicked there with call girls
imported from a neighboring capital.
   _When Maureen Reagan, the former president's daughter, showed up
in an African country a few years ago, the local U.S. ambassador
received her at the airport in an advanced state of drunkenness.
   _An ambassador to an Asian country a decade ago was so ignorant
about world affairs he was unaware that there were two Koreas and
had never heard of the heads of government of either France or West
Germany.
   The debate over political appointees versus those chosen from the
career diplomatic service heats up each time a new administration
takes office, and President Bush's accession is no different.
   The union of career diplomats is so upset with some of Bush's
nominees that it is accusing the State Department in a lawsuit of
covering up background information about some of the choices in
order to avoid embarrassing disclosures.
   The State Department declines comment on the suit but cites a
1970 ambassadorial appointment by President Nixon to defend the
practice of going outside the foreign service for some key
diplomatic posts.
   The assignment was U.N. ambassador and the appointee was a
defeated Senate candidate named George Bush.
   The career service has never argued against political appointees.
Indeed, the list of such ambassadors is long and distinguished. Mike
Mansfield, who recently completed a 12-year tour as ambassador to
Japan, is but one example. Otto Reich, who left Venezuela in July
after a three-year stay, initially encountered official hostility in
Caracas because he was thought to be a right-wing extremist. When he
left, he took with him Venezuela's highest decoration.
   Also, political appointees sometimes have the ear of their
president, an asset few career diplomats can claim. They are
sometimes more reliable in carrying out the president's policy than
their more cautious colleagues in the foreign service.
   Tony Motley, who as President Reagan's top aide for Latin America
policy had almost 30 ambassadors under his scrutiny, said the best
of them were equally divided between career and political appointees.
   At issue now, however, are the credentials of a handful of Bush's
selections, usually Republican activists who helped Bush in the 1988
campaign but who are untutored in diplomatic matters.
   Examples are Joseph Zappala, a Florida developer who was
nominated ambassador to Spain after contributing a reported $126,000
to the campaign.
   Another Florida businessman who made a similarly generous
contribution was Melvin Sembler, nominated to be Bush's man in
Australia.
   Della Newman won an appointment as ambassador to New Zealand
after helping Bush carry Washington state. Peter Secchia, who helped
deliver Michigan to Bush, was rewarded with the embassy in Rome.
   He quickly alienated many Italians by suggesting that the Italian
Navy now boasts glass bottom boats ``so they can see the old Italian
Navy.''
   Confidence in the process was not enhanced with the answers given
by Sembler and Zappala when they were asked to write their special
qualifications to be ambassadors.
   Sembler wrote: ``I have been known as a coalition builder, able
to organize my peers to action in support of worthy civic,
charitable and political causes.'' Zappala's response was almost
identical.
   It was episodes such as this that prompted Sen. Paul Sarbanes,
D-Md., to dismiss the system as ``insulting.'' And in going to court
over the issue, the career diplomats' union, known formally as the
American Foreign Service Association, believes the law is on its
side.
   A 1980 law says ambassadorial nominees should be knowledgeable
about all aspects of the country of their assignment and that
political campaign contributions ``should not be a factor'' in the
selection process.

   The man who would be king of a
northwestern Ohio community is not going to get the chance.
   Tom Wigle was the only person in the community of 200 to file for
November's election for the Village Council's six seats.
   Wigle says he could have declared himself council president,
become mayor by default _ and perhaps made himself king, since there
would be no one to disagree with him.
   ``They're starting to call me the king. I'm getting a hell of a
kick out of that,'' he said.
   But publicity about the possibility prompted Ida Lawrence to file
for election, and Mayor Pat McKee said she would run as a write-in
candidate.
   Wigle, 63, who has lived here for 30 years, said no one else
wanted to run because they were too afraid of offending someone they
knew.
   ``Everybody who lives here is damn near related,'' Wigle said.
``You can't get nothing done because nobody wants to make their
relation mad. Since you can't get nothing done, there's no use
running.''

   Montana's livestock may be getting tired of
statehood centennial celebrations.
   A week ago, nearly a thousand sheep were paraded down the
6-block-long main street of Reedpoint to the cheers of 12,000 sheep
partisans. Since then, about 2,700 cows have been herded by 2,400
drovers during a week-long cattle drive from Roundup to Billings.
   Now it's the pigs' turn. The Great Montana Centennial Swine Drive
is set for Oct. 1 in this southeastern Montana community, where two
families live, according to Kerry Gardner, an organizer of the
event. The drive is a fund-raiser for repairs to the community hall,
damaged in a June hail storm. Cattle and sheep already had been
taken and there's no glamour in chickens, so pigs won out, Gardner
said.
   Promotional fliers say there could be 5,000 porkers on the drive,
but sponsors admit they would prefer a lot fewer. For people who
don't own their own, pigs will be available for rent.

   Romance gave way to reality, but love found a way
for 773 couples to celebrate 50 years of wedded bliss with Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin at Holy Name Cathedral.
   ``Sometimes you feel like it isn't worth it, sure,'' said Samuel
Smith, who will be married for 50 years in November. ``But you say
you're together for better or worse and deal with it.''
   The theme was the more the merrier, as about 2,000 children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren were packed into the nearby
Cathedral School auditorium to watch the Mass Sunday on
closed-circuit television.
   The main focus of the Mass was to balance some of the negative
press about marriage and divorce, said Marsha Ross, a volunteer for
Marriage Encounters for Family Ministries.
   ``This balances that with a real vision of the commitment that
you see 773 times 50 years represents,'' Ms. Ross said. ``I mean its
a very powerful witness to ... well, marriage.''
   Catherine and Joseph Bergthold were married Sept. 9, 1949, and
now have 10 children, 25 grandchildren and seven
great-grandchildren. They say the secret to a successful marriage is
to concentrate on family, togetherness and working together to solve
problems.
   ``It certainly keeps you together,'' Catherine Bergthold said.
``The key is to get mad and get over it.''

<HEAD>Maryland Town Fighting Home Builders Group's Plan for Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER BRANDLON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MARYLAND CITY, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A construction industry group's
proposal for overcoming homelessness would be little more than a
concentration camp for the unfortunate, opponents say.
   But officials of the Home Builders Association of Maryland say
the $6.9 million complex of modest apartments they want to build on
surplus federal land would show people who have nowhere to live how
to become independent.
   ``We have the expertise and ability to help the homeless, and
innovative techniques that could be used if the government would
just let us,'' said Frank Miano, executive vice president of the
association's non-profit subsidiary, Housing America Through
Training.
   Residents and local officials have lined up against what Anne
Arundel County Executive James Lighthizer said would quickly become
a regional site serving hordes of the homeless from Washington,
D.C., and elsewhere.
   ``They have to yank these people out of the cities where they
come from and concentrate them in a remote section of a suburban
county. It's a concentration camp for people who are down on their
luck,'' Lighthizer said.
   No one need go homeless in the county because the county
government will pay for a motel room for anyone who cannot be
accommodated in shelters, Lighthizer said.
   But the home builders group contends its ``transitional housing''
would be far more than a shelter. Residents would be taught
construction trades and building management skills so that they
could help build and maintain the complex.
   The organization obtained conditional approval from the federal
Department of Health and Human Services on July 28 to build up to
300 units on a 35-acre surplus parcel of Fort George G. Meade, about
halfway between Washington and Baltimore.
   At the request of U.S. Rep. Tom McMillan, the Democrat who
represents Anne Arundel County, the General Services Administration
delayed release of the property to the federal department while
environmental issues were investigated.
   In a victory for the home builders, the GSA on Sept. 1 authorized
the department to begin lease negotiations with the home builders'
association.
   ``We've never doubted the applicant's compassion. We simply doubt
their common sense,'' said Brad Fitch, McMillan's spokesman.
   The thickly wooded site lacks water and sewage service, has no
access to public transportation or social services and is accessible
only by a dirt road.
   Housing America Through Training has pledged to build its own
road and sewage treatment plant, dig a well and organize a shuttle
bus service. The home builders' proposal also includes a day-care
center, a playground and social service workers to help residents
find jobs and homes of their own.
   The group applied to lease the parcel under the McKinney Act,
which requires the government to make surplus land available for
uses that benefit the homeless.
   Laurie Betz, spokeswoman for the builders, pointed out that it
was Congress, not her group, that made the land available for the
homeless.
   ``I think a lot of people think if we withdraw the proposal, it
will go away,'' she said. ``It won't.''
   Maryland City's 8,500 residents _ already living near a prison, a
juvenile detention center and an emergency homeless shelter _ resent
the implication that they are hard-hearted because they object to
this project, said Ray Smallwood, president of the Maryland City
Civic Association.
   ``Most people here would take someone into their homes if they
were in trouble,'' Smallwood said.
   ``We come out as the criminals _ against everything that's good,
apple pie and everything. But it's the most far-fetched thing we've
ever heard of,'' he said. ``It's not fair to the truly homeless.
They're going to be in a spot where nobody likes them. ... No one's
going to accept them.''
   Even though they would be on federal land, occupants would become
a burden to county taxpayers because they would use local services
and send their children to county schools, Smallwood said.
   Because the site is federal property, Housing America Through
Training officials say they would be exempt from local codes and
regulations that add to construction costs, making it possible to
experiment with less expensive building techniques.
   ``The whole purpose of the (McKinney) act is to take restraints
off. If they amend it, they're defeating the whole purpose, which is
to provide affordable housing,'' Betz said.
   But Lighthizer said he will ask Maryland's congressional
delegation to do just that. The county executive said the
legislation should be reworded to give local government some power
over projects proposed in their jurisdictions.
   That might well put an end to the project, both sides say.

<HEAD>Debate on Clean Air Bill Begins in Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal to rid cities of
smog, spare lakes and trees from acid rain and control poisonous
airborne chemicals begins a long and tortuous journey through
Congress this week.
   Upcoming clashes over the clean air bill will pit
environmentalists against industry, region against region and
powerful lawmakers against their colleagues. But when the fight is
over, the nation may have the first major revision in the law since
1977.
   A House subcommittee Tuesday will be the first panel to tackle
the Bush legislation, which proposes to reduce the main component of
acid rain, sulfur dioxide, by 10 million tons over the next decade,
and force severely polluted cities to take pollution-cutting
measures that would change residents' lifestyles.
   Also, for the first time, the measure would control poisonous
chemical substances that can cause cancer and other devastating
diseases.
   Other key issues before Congress this week are the president's
defense budget, the controversial nomination of Donald P. Gregg as
ambassador to South Korea, a permanent smoking ban on domestic
airline flights and a proposed statute to prohibit flag burning.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., member of the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee, said, ``there's going to be a lot of
posturing'' in the panel's hearings this week. Before compromises
are made, ``there are politics that have to be considered as well as
personal friendships of people who are going to have long careers
together,'' he said.
   Synar is among nine Energy and Commerce Committee members trying
to steer a middle ground between the two main combatants:
subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., the champion of
environmental organizations; and the chairman of the full committee,
John D. Dingell, D-Mich., who usually expresses concerns of the
auto, utility and other industries.
   Among the issues to be argued before the subcommittee:
   _Should the Bush anti-pollution requirements for cars be made
tougher over objections of the auto industry? Waxman wants to drop a
proposal to average pollution emissions by engine categories. He
wants to double the current manufacturers' warranty on
anti-pollution equipment from 50,000 miles to 100,000 miles. And he
favors expanding a Bush proposal for requiring use of alternative
motor fuels.
   _Toxic chemicals. Should the legislation cover more substances
than the Bush legislation, force companies in all cases to install
expensive anti-pollution equipment, direct the chemical industry to
better prepare for accidental spills, and eliminate economic
considerations in setting emissions standards?
   _Acid rain. Should customers of polluting power plants in nine
states pay a disproportionate share of the cost of cleaning up acid
rain emissions? Under the Bush legislation, the brunt of the cost
would be paid by electric customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana,
West Virginia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, and Georgia.
   On Sunday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William
Reilly defended the proposal to require alternate fuels in the
worst-polluted cities, saying ``there is no other way'' to curb smog.
   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Reilly said alternative
fuels such as methanol and ethanol can compete economically with
gasoline.
   The petroleum industry contends the alternative fuels proposal
would put its members at an unfair disadvantage against the makers
of the other fuels. Methanol, for instance, is derived from natural
gas or coal.
   Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee is to
vote Tuesday on the president's defense package that stresses
big-ticket items such as Star Wars, the B-2 stealth bomber and the
MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles.
   The full Senate is to vote on the Gregg nomination as ambassador
to South Korea. The one-time aide to then-Vice President Bush has
denied under oath allegations that he was involved in Oliver North's
secret operation to resupply the Nicaraguan rebels.
   An $11.9 billion transportation spending bill before the Senate
includes language to prohibit cigarette smoking on all domestic
airline flights. The current ban on smoking aboard flights lasting
two hours or less is scheduled to expire in April.
   The House has scheduled consideration of a law to ban
flag-burning in response to the Supreme Court ruling June 21 that
said that said such protests are constitutional. The Bush
administration and many lawmakers have pushed for a constitutional
amendment rather than a statute.

<HEAD>Wheat Harvest Could Reach Six-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moisture conditions have improved so much in
the nation's bread basket that private analyst John Schnittker says
the 1990 wheat harvest could reach a six-year high of 2.5 billion
bushels.
   That would be up nearly one-fourth from this year's harvest of
2.04 billion bushels and 38 percent from the drought-smitten 1988
production of 1.81 billion bushels.
   Schnittker, a veteran agricultural economist and head of his own
Washington-based consulting firm, says his optimism is based in part
on ``massive rains'' in Oklahoma and southern Kansas in the past two
or three weeks, along with more recent moisture in northern Kansas,
Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri.
   These are prime winter wheat areas where 1989 yields were reduced
sharply by drought conditions.
   ``Except for some little locations that may be missed _ and there
are always some of those _ winter wheat in the main belt will be
going into the ground in very good condition,'' Schnittker said in a
telephone interview.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and is harvested the
following summer. It comprises about three-fourths of the total U.S.
wheat supply. Kansas, Schnittker's native state, is the traditional
leader.
   The USDA says winter wheat planting is under way now in the
central and southern Great Plains, and in Idaho and Montana.
   ``I would say prospects are good, both for acreage and for
(growing) conditions,'' Schnittker said. ``But that was true a year
ago, too. We had a fair start a year ago and then it quit raining.''
   As a result, young wheat plants withered and were not able to
gain enough moisture to see them through the winter. Kansas
production dropped 35 percent to 209.3 million bushels from 323
million in 1988, based on last month's estimate.
   Norton D. Strommen, the USDA's chief meteorologist, said there
has been so much rain recently that ``it looks like we're going to
have a slow, wet harvest through most of the major grain belt this
fall.'' But he added that prospects for 1990 winter wheat have
improved greatly.
   ``There's no question on that,'' Strommen said. ``We're in better
shape now, moisture-wise, than we were at any time last fall. We did
get some very timely rains to help with planting, germination and
establishment of the (winter wheat) crop last fall, but then it
turned dry.''
   Strommen said there has been enough rain in huge areas of the
winter wheat region so that ``even some of the subsoil moisture
levels are starting to increase, and that's very encouraging.''
   Part of Schnittker's production outlook is based on USDA's
decision to ease the land-idling requirement for 1990 to 5 percent
of a farmer's base acreage from 10 percent for 1989. That is the
amount of land that must be taken from production in order to
qualify the farmer for federal price supports and other program
benefits.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has been under some
pressure, primarily from domestic wheat users, to relax the 1990
wheat program even further to help rebuild diminished U.S. and world
stockpiles.
   One option being considered is a ``contract modification''
authorized under farm law which could allow farmers to boost
plantings from their normal program acreage. This additional wheat,
however, would not qualify for federal price supports, direct
payments or be used to compute a producer's acreage ``history'' for
future years.
   Schnittker said he thought Yeutter has postponed a decision on
further expansion of the 1990 wheat program until after revised
production and use figures are announced on Tuesday, Sept. 12. He
predicted no changes will be made.
   ``The world wheat situation is tenuous but not dangerous yet, and
next year's prospects are improving,'' Schnittker said. ``So they
will leave the rules like they are, I think.''
   Carl Schwensen, executive vice president of the National
Association of Wheat Growers, which does not favor a further
expansion for 1990, said he thinks the odds right now favor some
kind of ``contract modification'' but declined to speculate on what
the details might be.
   One of the underlying fears of the association has been that
wheat production can soar in relatively short order and that a
significant rise in U.S. inventories will drive down prices again.
   According to USDA projections last month, wheat market prices
nationally are expected to average $3.85 to $4.25 per bushel in the
marketing year that began on June 1, up from $3.72 in 1988-89 and
$2.57 in 1987-88.

   The number of inmates in U.S. prisons jumped by
a record 7.3 percent during the first half of 1989 to a total of
673,565 inmates, the Bureau of Justice Statistics says.
   The six-month increase of 46,004 inmates was higher than any
full-year increase recorded during the 64 years that the government
has counted prisoners, the bureau said Sunday.
   The largest annual increase ever recorded was in 1981-82, when
the national prison population grew by 41,060 inmates, from 344,283
to 385,343, said Tom Hester of the bureau.
   The surge in prison population during the first half of 1989 was
brought about by increases of 7 percent in the number of men
imprisoned and 13 percent in the number of women, the bureau said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the increase was ``an
indication that more criminals, many convicted of drug-related
offenses, are being caught and punished.''
   ``The criminal justice system is working,'' Thornburgh said in a
statement. ``People who break the law do pay the price.''
   The figures dramatize the need for almost 1,800 new prison beds a
week, the bureau said. ``Congress needs to act swiftly on President
Bush's violent crime legislation, which provides for the
construction of more than 24,000 new federal prison beds,''
Thornburgh said.
   The national drug control strategy, announced by Bush last
Tuesday, echoed the crime legislation Bush called for in May in
seeking $1.2 billion in 1990 budget authorization for additional
federal prison space.
   Most of the increase from Dec. 31, 1988, to June 30, 1989,
occurred in the state prison systems, where the population grew by
41,214 or 7.1 percent, from 577,633 at the end of 1988 to 618,847 at
the end of June. During the same period, the federal prison
population expanded by 4,790, a 9.7 percent increase from 49,928 to
54,718.
   During the six-month period, nine jurisdictions reported
double-digit growth in their inmate populations: Rhode Island, 20.3
percent; South Dakota, 19.9 percent; Connecticut, 18.4 percent;
Utah, 13.2 percent; the District of Columbia, 12.1 percent; Idaho,
11.3 percent; Mississippi, 10.6 percent; Missouri, 10.4 percent; and
Kentucky, 10.2 percent.
   Two states experienced declines in prison populations _
Tennessee, down 2.3 percent, and North Dakota, down 2.1 percent. And
Texas had such a small increase, only 2 prisoners more, that the
change was listed as 0 percent.
   Since 1980, the number of state and federal prisoners serving
sentences of more than one year _ known as sentenced prisoners _
more than doubled, from 315,974, while four states recorded a
tripling of such inmates _ California, New Hampshire, Alaska and New
Jersey.
   An additional 25 states and the District of Columbia doubled
their prison populations.
   Overall, the number of sentenced prisoners as of June 30 was 260
per 100,000 population, with 18 of them in federal prisons and 242
in state institutions. On Dec. 31, 1980, there were 139 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 population, the bureau said.

   Dissident Roman Catholic priest Rev. George A.
Stallings Jr. is calling on parishioners at his unsanctioned church
to boycott The Washington Post and its advertisers in retaliation
for articles about Stallings' alleged homosexual relationship with
an altar boy.
   News cameras and some reporters were barred from Sunday's service
of Stallings' Imani Temple in suburban Washington. The church later
released a videotape of parts of the service.
   ``Let me tell you something, Washington Post, we're going to hit
you where it hurts,'' Stallings shouted. ``We're going to start with
your advertisers one by one by one ... You're messing with the wrong
man.''
   Stallings also urged more than 1,000 churchgoers to cancel their
subscriptions, the Post reported today.
   A week ago the newspaper reported that a man, now 28, said he
repeatedly had sex with Stallings in a Washington church rectory in
1977 when the man was a 16-year-old altar boy.
   At Sunday's service, the Post said Stallings said he would not
respond to any allegation. ``I will not dignify it with a response.
As African Americans, we refuse to allow you to set our agenda.''
   In response, Washington Post Managing Editor Leonard Downie Jr.
said Sunday, ``We believe we have treated the Rev. Stallings
fairly.'' Downie added that the Post and other news media ``have
repeatedly sought ... to give him the opportunity to explain his
actions fully.''
   Stallings was suspended from performing sacraments by Washington
Cardinal James A. Hickey shortly after Stallings formed the Imani
Temple in July. Stallings contended the Catholic church did not
serve the needs of black parishioners.

   The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen
Monday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended
marginally lower after regaining most of its morning losses.
   The dollar closed at 147.77 yen, up 1.15 yen from Friday's
146.62-yen finish. The currency began trading at 147.75 yen and
ranged between 147.50 yen and 148.03 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained most of
its earlier losses and ended down 2.15 points, or 0.006 percent,
closing the day's trading at 34,113.66. It lost 36.75 points Friday.
   ``The index fell largely due to the yen's recent weakness against
the dollar,'' said Tsuneo Ishii, a Nomura Securities stock analyst.
   The dollar's opening Monday was its highest since a 150.30-yen
opening June 15.
   Except for some winners including steels and construction issues,
prices generally fell as participants were discouraged by the yen's
depreciation, he said.
   Dealers said the yen's decline made market players also worry
about possible hikes in domestic interest rates, while a series of
reports on the U.S. economic performance, including trade figures
for July and the retail price index for August, are due out toward
the end of this week.
   Following a similar uptrend in New York since Friday the U.S.
currency remained strong despite the Bank of Japan's dollar-selling
market intervention to stop the dollar's further rise, said a Bank
of Tokyo trader.
   He said the Bank of Japan intervened at around 147.70 yen ``in an
attempt to prevent the dollar from surpassing the 148-yen level.''
   The amount of the currency sold by the central bank was unknown.
The central bank does not comment on its monetary activities.
   ``The dollar's strength will probably last at least until it
reaches as high as 148.50 yen,'' he said. But the currency moved
little Monday as market players were almost evenly divided into
those buying at the 147.50-yen level and those selling for
profit-taking just below the 148-yen level, the trader said.

   At least seven Palestinians were killed in the
occupied territories on Sunday, six by Israelis and one by a fellow
Arab as a suspected collaborator with authorities, the army and Arab
reports said.
   Twenty-nine Palestinians were reported wounded _ including an
18-month-old _ by soldiers dispersing stone throwers, hospital
officials said.
   Late Sunday, troops raiding the West Bank village of Kafr Quddum
six miles west of Nablus shot and killed a Palestinian youth and
arrested two Arabs, an army spokesman said.
   The spokesman said troops entered the village to make arrests and
opened fire after they were attacked by youths with metal bars and
stones.
   Arab hospital officials identified the Arab as Sahed Shetawi, 20.
   Arab reports said the raid was carried out by about 10 settlers.
They said the settlers, who usually carry army issued automatic
weapons for self-protection, entered the village in a Volkswagon
minibus and apparently opened fire when they were hit with stones.
   At least four other villagers were treated for gunshot wounds,
hospital officials said.
   At least 566 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
22-month-old uprising against Israeli rule. Thirty-nine Israelis
also have been killed.
   Another 112 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs during
the uprising as accused collaborators, prostitutes or drug dealers.
   Three prominent Palestinians will travel to Egypt this week to
urge the PLO to allow Arabs from the occupied territories to hold
peace talks with Israel, newspapers reported. Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat will be in Cairo, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
   The daily Haaretz said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will
propose a Palestinian delegation of 12 people from the occupied
territories, including two deported by Israel.
   The proposal apparently gets around a PLO refusal to have
Palestinians represented only by negotiators from the occupied
territories, since the deported men could be seen as representing
Palestinians abroad.
   The Yediot Ahronot independent daily quoted Energy Minister Moshe
Shahal as saying Israel most likely would agree to meet such a
delegation about an Israeli plan to hold elections in the occupied
lands.
   In the occupied West Bank, three Palestinians were killed in
clashes with soldiers including a 19-year-old youth who was shot
trying to throw a firebomb at troops in Nablus, the army said.
   Sunday's unrest in Nablus, the occupied West Bank's largest city,
broke out after soldiers lifted a weeklong curfew that confined the
city's 120,000 residents to their homes.
   After the shooting, seven people were wounded by army gunfire as
rioting spread through Nablus and two nearby refugee camps, the army
said.
   Amid the shooting, an 18-month-old baby was reportedly shot in
the eye with a rubber bullet and seriously wounded, hospital
officials said. The army said it was investigating the report.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers clashed with Arabs near the El Farouk
Mosque in Rafiah, killing 20-year-old Attala el Mashrahe, the army
said.
   In a separate incident, Mohammed Salim Sharab, 17, was fatally
shot in the chest by an armed guard of a civilian fuel truck in Khan
Yunis, the army said.
   ``The guard opened fire after youths hurled stones and metal bars
at the truck and the matter has been handed over to the police,'' an
army spokesman said.
   Overnight, a lone Palestinian assailant reportedly stabbed to
death Abdullkah Hajeh, 27, near his home in Tal village outside
Nablus, hours after his house was hit with a firebomb.
   Hajeh had been accused of collaborating with the Israeli
authorities in helping to raze olive groves and recruiting
Palestinians for Israeli intellience, sources in Nablus said.
   The army confirmed the death but said the motive for the slaying
was criminal, not alleged collaboration.
   In Jerusalem, police said a Palestinian suspected of stabbing an
Israeli bus driver in an attempt to drive a passenger bus over a
cliff had slain a Jewish man three days earlier in Tel Aviv.
   The suspect, whose name is being withheld, led police to a
building site where the body of a 38-year-old Jewish man was found,
spokesman Uzi Sandori said. He told police he killed the man out of
``nationalist motives,'' Sandori said.
   The attempt to commandeer the bus Saturday night occurred as the
Jerusalem-bound vehicle was seven miles from Tel Aviv. On July 6, a
Palestinian forced a bus off a cliff, killing 16 Jews, including an
American tourist.
   On Saturday, a disaster was averted when several elderly
passengers grabbed and beat the assailant, witnesses said.
   The driver, Shlomo Assor, 40, was stabbed twice in the abdomen
and once in the arm, but managed to stop the bus safely.

<HEAD>Survivors of Fatal Ship Fire Unite As Controversy Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAUL REYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has been 55 years since a mysterious fire
aboard the luxury liner Morro Castle killed more than 130 people as
thousands watched in horror from the New Jersey shore.
   But the years have not erased the controversy over what really
happened in the blaze on Sept. 8, 1934.
   Six survivors met Saturday at the Maritime Museum to commemorate
the disaster and recall the sordid tale of arson, a dead sea
captain, gunrunning to Cuba, international intrigue and a
recalcitrant federal government unwilling to divulge all it knows
about the disaster.
   Ruth Coleman recalls the tragedy as a ``horrible thing.''
   ``It was a nightmare. I couldn't believe that this was happening.
It was something you read about; that happens to other people,''
says Mrs. Coleman, who was 23 at the time.
   Hours before the fire, Capt. Robert Wilmott was found slumped
across his bathtub. Flames broke out about 2:45 a.m., but it was 30
minutes after people on shore spotted the burning ship that the
acting captain, William Warms, ordered an SOS message be sent.
Already, people were jumping off the flaming decks.
   By sunrise, thousands along the coast saw the ship cast an eerie
glow as it drifted toward Asbury Park.
   While the tragedy led to an overhaul of maritime safety
guidelines, many believe the truth of what happened aboard the ship
has never been told.
   Thomas Torresson was an 18-year-old assistant purser on the ship.
He says news accounts through the years have been slanted against
the crew and the ship's owners.
   ``Thousands and thousands of words have been written that are not
true,'' Torresson said.
   The acting captain, he says, did the best he could under very
trying circumstances.
   The only safety violation that Torresson concedes is that the
captain did not conduct lifeboat drills.
   ``The truth is that when reporters wrote their stories, they
jazzed them up,'' Torresson said.
   But for Agnes Margolis, who was on the cruise with her sister,
Ruth Coleman, the truth may lie in records the government continues
to withhold.
   ``There has definitely been a coverup despite the fact that there
is a Freedom of Information Act,'' said Mrs. Margolis, who was 28 at
the time.
   ``There is even talk that the munitions which we took to Havana
were to be diverted to Germany,'' she said. ``Maybe that is one
reason they are withholding this information.''
   Robert McDonnell and Fred Rasmussen, who are researching a book
on the Morro Castle, have sued the government in federal court in
Trenton, N.J., to win release of records that might solve the many
of the mysteries.
   They say the ship's owners hired a man to burn the vessel to
collect insurance. Complicating the case is that the arsonist,
George Rogers, was probably a government operative or informant and
that the liner sometimes carried arms to the Cuban dictator at the
time, the researchers say.
   Rogers, who had a criminal record before he worked on the ship,
later was convicted of trying to kill his boss, who suspected Rogers
of setting fire to the ship. He was paroled but sentenced to life in
prison for the bludgeoning deaths of his neighbors.
   The Morro Castle, bound for Pier 14 in Manhattan, was returning
from a ``Forget the Depression'' cruise to Cuba.
   With Wilmott dead and the fire raging, acting captain Warms,
apparently trying to get the ship near shore, turned it into strong
winds that quickly stoked the fire out of control.
   Survivors claimed that the crew did little to help the
panic-stricken passengers. Lifeboats that arrived on shore were
filled with mostly crew members and few passengers.
   The ship's officers and an official of the Ward Line of New York
were convicted of willful negligence in a federal court trial but
their convictions were overturned.

   ``We're free! We're free! It's
unbelievable!'' shouted young East Germans who piled out of
Hungarian taxis early today in a wave of arriving refugees
celebrating with cheers, tears, champagne and honking horns.
   ``It's wonderful, it's terrific,'' refugees shouted to reporters
and border guards after Hungary opened up its Austrian frontier at
midnight to allow thousands of East Germans to go West, to the
dismay of East Berlin.
   Some of the cars stopped just inside Austria, disgorging laughing
and yelling East Germans swinging foaming champagne bottles.
   Several of the refugees, their nerves frayed after weeks of
waiting, broke into tears of joy on arrival in the West.
   One man, overcome with emotion, tried to smile as tears rolled
down his cheeks and couldn't speak as he arrived in this border town
50 miles southeast of Vienna.
   Crowds whistled, cheered and clapped as other East German cars _
some with sleeping toddlers oblivious to the commotion _ followed.
   In a rust-brown Lada, a Soviet-made car, the male driver, along
with another man and two women, grinned broadly at the Austrian
border booth and waved, transfixed in the glare of television camera
lights, before moving on.
   One group of youths, just before crossing the opened red and
white border barriers, held up a sign saying ``Give it up Erich'' _
a reference to East Germany's Communist leader, Erich Honecker.
   With open arms, Austrians met the new refugees whose mass
emigration to West Germany _ where citizenship is automatic _ is the
largest of East Germans since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 to
stem the flow across the border.
   Some of the Austrians offered to feed or shelter those wanting to
rest before continuing their journey. One woman stood by the side of
the road with a hand-lettered sign offering room and board for a
refugee family with children.
   Red Cross workers in Nickelsdorf handed out steaming cups of tea,
crackers, maps _ and advice _ to the East Germans. Many of the
refugees said they planned to drive directly to the West German
border, 400 miles to the north, where tent communities awaited them.
   At the Nickelsdorf crossing, Austrian customs agents told
reporters that about 2,000 people crossed the frontier in cars alone
in the first five hours of the exodus.
   One veteran Red Cross volunteer told reporters the nighttime
border influx reminded him of the thousands of Hungarians who fled
over the same border in 1956, after Soviet tanks crushed the Soviet
bloc's bloodiest revolt.

   Declaring the futuristic church a ``Star Wars
system for the Lord,'' the Rev. Fred Price led 8,100 congregants
into the first service inside one of the nation's largest churches.
   ``Hallelujah! Jesus just hit a grand-slam home run! Oooh, you
look good!'' Price exclaimed Sunday as he marched into the $9
million geodesic building dubbed the Faith Dome.
   ``This place is breathtaking,'' said John W. Smith of Hawthorne.
   With room for 10,145 people in theater-style seats, the Crenshaw
Christian Center in south-central Los Angeles is among the most
spacious church sanctuaries in the nation. The congregation is Los
Angeles' largest with 16,000 members.
   Price announced plans for the building eight years ago when the
congregation bought the original 28-acre Pepperdine University
campus for $14 million.
   In defense of the amount spent on the project, Price pointed out
the U.S. government spends billions on arms. He said the
church-in-the-round is, in a way, ``a Star Wars program for the Lord
... a stealth bomber for Jesus!
   ``And instead of killing folk, we're going to show them how to
get life, and life more abundantly.''
   Price, 57, is an independent clergyman in the Pentecostal
movement. His weekly services are televised nationwide.

<HEAD>President Roh Proposed Three-step Unification Plan for Korean Peninsula</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo today proposed a
broad three-step plan for unifying communist North Korea with the
capitalist south and ending four stormy decades of tension,
hostilities and confrontation.
   Roh called on North Korean leaders to help form a Korean
Commonwealth, an interim association which would work for eventual
national unification, ending the ``tragedy of division (which) is
unbearably painful.
   ``Just as the barrier of division is tall and thick, so the path
to unification is steep and rugged,'' Roh said in a televised
address to the opening of the National Assembly. But he said ``the
reality is that it will be impossible to achieve unification
overnight.''
   He offered no timetable, but said he hoped a summit would be held
soon and a charter for the commonwealth signed by August 1990, the
45th anniversary of partition.
   Roh has called for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung
before, but there has been no positive response.
   Political observers doubted that North Korea would accept Roh's
proposal, and some opposition lawmakers said it did not reflect the
views of all South Koreans. The government claimed it conducted a
poll of 15,000 citizens to help formulate the proposal.
   Many Koreans have long hoped for reconciliation between the north
and south, separated in 1945 at the end of World War II. The two
Koreas share a common culture, language, and history and thousands
of families have been separated by the border.
   Roh's latest unification proposal comes at a time when the
government is under increasing pressure from dissidents and radical
students for not making stronger efforts toward unification with the
north.
   A radical student and a dissident clergymen are in prison for
making unauthorized visits to the north to discuss unification.
   Radical students have staged violent demonstrations in support of
North Korea's unification proposal, which includes calls for
immediate withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea
under a mutual defense pact.
   The north's plan calls for a confederation under which there is
one nation for military and diplomatic matters but both sides
maintain their different political and social systems. The south has
called that ``unrealistic.''
   Roh's new three-step plan took into account North Korea's
demands, according to officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
and it also changed the basis of past South Korean proposals.
   Under Roh's new proposal, delegates to the interim governmental
bodies would be equally divided between the north and the south and
all issues would get equal consideration.
   In the past, the Seoul government has said that because the south
has twice the population of the north it should have a larger
representation in a new government.
   It has also said it wanted to deal with economic and humanitarian
issues before moving onto political and military matters under
unification.
   Roh's plan did not mention the U.S. troops stationed in South
Korea, though he said measures should be taken to build confidence
and control arms with the goal of ending the costly arms race and
confrontation.
   The first step in Roh's plan calls for establishing a Korean
National Community, for agreeing essentially that there is a
national community. This includes a north-south summit and the
signing of a National Community Charter.
   The charter would outline the Korean Commonwealth, stage two in
the unification plan.
   The Korean Commonwealth would include a Council of Presidents, a
20-member Council of Ministers, a 100-member Council of
Representatives and a joint secretariat, which would all be equally
divided in membership between the North and South.
   A secretariat, perhaps stationed in a new ``Peace Zone'' city in
the Demilitarized Zone, would serve as a working level body to
handle routine business for the commonwealth, Roh said.
   Liason offices operating much like quasi-diplomatic missions
would be set up in Seoul and the north's capital of Pyongyang, he
said.
   In the final step, the commonwealth would draw up a constitution
and set up elections for a united nation, Roh said.
   A cease-fire ended the 1950-53 Korean War, but a peace treaty was
never signed between the north and south.

<HEAD>Former President Continues Recovery From Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan is rapidly
recovering from surgery to remove fluid from the surface of his
brain but won't be released from St. Marys Hospital until at least
Tuesday, his spokesman said.
   Reagan will ``go home when the doctors tell him he can,''
spokesman Mark Weinberg said Sunday.
   Weinberg said he knows of no further procedures planned for
Reagan.
   The 78-year-old former president had a restful night and awoke
shortly after 6:30 a.m. Sunday, Weinberg said. After breakfast, he
read newspapers and visited with his brother-in-law Dr. Richard
Davis, then had lunch with his wife, Nancy, Weinberg said.
   Reagan also walked unassisted outside his room, watched football
on television, wrote letters, posed for a photographer while wearing
a Minnesota Twins cap and read some of the hundreds of greeting
cards he has received since entering the hospital Friday.
   ``The team of Mayo Clinic physicians and nurses managing
President Reagan's care ... report that he continues to make an
excellent recovery,'' Weinberg said.
   On Friday, surgeons drilled a hole in Reagan's skull to remove a
buildup of blood. Weinberg said the problem stemmed from a July 4
accident in which Reagan was thrown by a bucking horse and hit his
head. The fluid was detected during a routine physical examination.
   Reagan's neurosurgeon, meanwhile, said an earlier brain clot had
been detected but it had healed on its own without an operation, The
New York Times reported today.
   The neurosurgeon, Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt, said Sunday the first
clot was smaller and in a different area of the brain than the one
removed Friday. Because of the first clot, brain tests were included
as part of the checkup, Sundt said.
   Reagan's spokesman had not previously disclosed the earlier blood
clot, detected in early July by doctors in Los Angeles, where Reagan
lives.
   The Reagans on Saturday sent a message of good wishes to Mother
Teresa, who was hospitalized in Calcutta, India, after suffering a
heart attack.
   President Bush telephoned Reagan on Saturday evening from Camp
David and spoke with his predecessor for about five minutes,
Weinberg said.
   ``The president wished him well,'' said White House spokesman
Roman Popadiuk. ``President Reagan sounded strong and very well. He
said he had no pain. He stated that he hopes to get out soon and
expressed his appreciation for the flowers the president and Mrs.
Bush sent.''
   Many others also have sent flowers, Weinberg said, including the
king of Morocco and the White House executive residence staff.
   Because of the limited space in Reagan's room, Weinberg said the
flowers were being shared with other patients.

   Alexander Haig, the feisty career Army
officer and former cabinet member, says his life in zoo-like
atmospheres prepared him well for his stage debut as a narrator for
``Carnival of the Animals.''
   On Sunday night, Haig and his wife, Pat, narrated Ogden Nash's
verses that accompany Camille Saint-Saens' ``Carnival of the
Animals.''
   The performance with the California Chamber Virtuosi ended a
three-day music festival celebrating the fifth anniversary of
Leisure Village Ocean Hills, a 1,200-unit retirement community. Haig
sits on its board of directors.
   The four-star general, failed presidential candidate, former
secretary of state and one-time Nixon aide was persuaded by Leisure
Village developer Michael Tenzer to participate.
   Haig said it shouldn't surprise Americans that a former
politician is trying his hand at acting.
   ``It's a first for me in this category, but as an ex-politican I
have been acting in the recent past, rather expensively though,''
said Haig, who owns an international marketing firm in Washington,
D.C., and lectures frequently about global issues.
   ``I am a departure from the norm in Los Angeles, though, where
some go from acting to politics and I go from politics to acting,
but I don't find it unfamiliar ground because if you look at this as
the `Carnival of the Animals' I've just left the greatest zoo in the
world _ Washington D.C.''
   The nearly 1,000 people at the performance heard the Haigs
narrate passages describing lions, turtles, elephants, kangaroos,
birds, swans and mules.
   The narrations were followed by piano music that brought alive
the world of apes; a string quintet that transformed the stage into
a managerie of lions, elephants, mules, roosters and swans; a
flutist who took the crowd to ocean depths; a clarinetist whose
backstage cuckooing delighted the audience; and a percussionist's
instruments that captured the dances of prehistoric fossils.
   Wearing a navy blue suit with a white shirt and yellow tie, Haig
stood before the musicians like a general, frequently glancing at
them and the audience while clutching a black notebook containing
his script.
   He listened intently to the music. Then, taking cues from
conductor Henri Temianka, Haig read his lines. Delighting in some,
he smiled and blushed after hearing the crowd chuckle and clap.
   ``In the world of mules, there are no rules,'' he read quickly
and loudly as dueling violins brought the sounds of mules to life.
   Another verse was a tongue-twister, but Haig read it without
stumbling.
   ``Come crown my brow with leaves of myrtle,
   ``I know the tortoise is a turtle.
   ``Come carve my name in stone immortal,
   ``I know the turtoise (sic) is a tortle (sic).
   ``I know to my profound despair,
   ``I bet on one to beat a hare.
   ``I also know I'm now a pauper,
   ``Because of its tortley turtley torpor.''

   A shouting match between homosexuals and
fundamentalist Christians erupted into a brawl during Orange
County's first gay-pride festival.
   Six people were arrested Sunday for investigation of failure to
obey police during the scuffle, which involved 30 to 40 people in a
gay-pride parade and an unspecified number of protesters, said
police department spokesman Lt. Robert Helton.
   No serious injuries were reported, Helton said.
   ``We hoped this would be a healing, gentle day. Unfortunately, it
didn't work out that way,'' organizer Janet Avery told the crowd at
Centennial Park.
   During the noontime parade, protesters stood on the edge of the
park, holding signs urging ``Sodomite back to your closet'' and
``Turn or burn'' while male couples stood holding hands nearby.
   The festival attracted about 1,200 people on Saturday and up to
3,000 on Sunday, police said.

   The writer, who reported from Afghanistan in June
1980, six months after the Soviet intervention, recently spent five
weeks there to assess changes after the Soviet pullout nine years
later.

<TEXT>
   Some of the hatred heaped on the Soviet
Union during its nine-year military intervention has shifted to the
United States, the chief supplier of the guerrilla rockets that kill
far more civilians than soldiers.
   Six months after the Soviet withdrawal, many Afghans sought out a
visitng American journalist to accuse the United States of financing
death, not promoting peace.
   ``I hate the American government because they are assisting the
opposition groups in our country. They're killing our people. We
want peace to come to Afghanistan,'' said 22-year-old Takar.
   He lost three relatives in the failed guerrilla assault on the
southeastern city of Jalalabad that began after the last Soviet
troops withdrew on Feb. 15.
   Public hostility to the Soviets was so strong after their troops
poured into the country in December 1979 that few soldiers or their
families ventured out into downtown bazaars and restaurants.
   When Soviets passed by, Afghans shouted insults, sometimes
accompanied by a shove, pinch or handful of tossed pebbles. In
contrast, for American visitors Afghans reserved smiles and pleas
for the United States to supply anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons
to Moslem guerrillas.
   Soviets remain unloved and still keep a low profile, but they are
no longer the enemy interloper. The Soviet Embassy compound remains
a favorite guerrilla rocket target, even though the rebels seem to
keep missing it, and some Afghans blame the Soviets as well as the
Americans for prolonging the fighting.
   ``All people think the Soviet Union and the United States want
war in our country _ they don't want peace in our country,'' said
Dr. Mohammad Nasser, a doctor in Kabul. ``We don't want any more
revolution. We just want Afghanistan for the Afghans.''
   In the dusty bazaars and crowded tea houses of Kabul, where nine
years ago Afghans spoke of fighting Soviet troops, the conversation
now centers on fear of rockets, leaving the city, high food prices
and prospects of a political settlement _ which inevitably brings up
the United States.
   The United States is now viewed by many Afghans as the key player
in the war: U.S.-supplied rockets are terrorizing Kabul.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have failed to topple the government
of President Najib, as Western diplomats had predicted and as many
Afghans had expected, and the rebels' internal feuding had turned to
warfare.
   The United States closed its embassy in Kabul before Soviet
troops left, citing security concerns, and there are only a handful
of Americans in Kabul full-time, all missionary health workers.
   For some Afghans, the opportunity to confront an American visitor
was not to be missed.
   Several times, an American journalist was surrounded by crowds of
20 to 30 Afghans, many shouting that President Bush should stop
giving weapons to the guerilla mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   A few Afghans, out of earshot of their fellow countrymen, backed
the Americans but said Washington wasn't doing enough to get rid of
Najib.
   Nine years ago, Kabulis complained there was nothing to do in the
capital and there is even less choice now. The only discotheque at
the Continental Hotel has closed and so have most restaurants.
   Curfew is now an hour earlier, at 10 p.m.
   By day, Kabul is a noisy Oriental bazaar where men in turbans sip
tea and haggle over Japanese cameras, Russian watches and sides of
lamb.
   By night, the incoming rockets, outgoing Soviet Scud missiles and
shots fired by sentries shatter dreams.
   The rebels communicate clandestinely, as they did nine years ago,
through ``night letters'' circulated after curfew. One of the
single-page letters in early August urged Kabul residents to leave
the city for two weeks to avoid heavy rocketing.
   Afghans have traditionally fought any foreign interloper and the
Soviets were no exception. They were non-believing Communists who
threatened the traditional Moslem way of life.
   Najib has gone to great lengths to rebuild mosques destroyed by
his Communist predecessors, to precede all his speeches with prayers
by a mullah, and to be photographed praying toward Mecca.
   With the Soviets gone and Najib espousing Islam, some guerrillas
have made peace with the government, saying their fight against the
infidels has been won. But many Afghans still grumble.
   Afghan troops have replaced their Soviet counterparts on the
streets of Kabul and other major cities. Qargah Lake, outside Kabul,
a favorite Soviet swimming hole, is now a fish farm.
   But the Afghan government is more dependent than ever on Moscow
for food, fuel, weapons and ammunition. The Soviet airlift continues
with 30 to 200 flights a day, according to diplomatic sources, and
hundreds of trucks rumble down the Salang Highway from the Soviet
border to Kabul.

<HEAD>Tom Mix's Horse `Ridden' Off ... Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trail's gone cold for the rustler, but
folks here say they will replace the stolen statue of a horse ridden
by movie cowboy Tom Mix. For the third time.
   ``We're not going to give in to this stealing,'' said Billy
Earley, spokeswoman for the Pinal County Historical Society.
   Last month, a statue of Tony the Wonder Horse was stolen from the
Mix memorial along U.S. 89 between Oracle Junction and Florence.
   That statue had replaced the original, which was taken in 1980
after someone sawed it off its stone pedestal.
   The original statue, depicting a horse with its head lowered and
its saddle empty, was put up in 1947 by the Florence Chamber of
Commerce at the site where Mix died in a one-car accident Oct. 12,
1940.
   It was never found, and sheriff's deputies said last week the
leads aren't much better in the hunt for Tony II.
   Ms. Earley said the historical society, which provided materials
for the second Tony statue, has been working with the Arizona
Department of Transportation to produce Tony III.
   ``Whether you liked him or not, Tom Mix was an idol for many,
many people, and we want to keep that monument in place,'' Ms.
Earley said. ``We hope to have the new horse in place by next
month.''
   Tom Teague, area maintenance superintendent for the Department of
Transportation office in Globe, said the agency would provide sheet
metal for Tony III _ and for a backup.
   ``We had one piece of sheet metal and we bought another one so we
could have another horse cut out while we're at it,'' Teague said.
``That way we'll have a backup if it gets ripped off again.''
   He said Arizona State Prison inmates who made Tony II will cut
out the two new statues at a cost of about $100 per horse.
   Teague and Ms. Earley said they knew of no way to protect Tony
III from thieves, because the site is remote and can't be guarded
full-time.
   `` And you couldn't fence it. They'd just cut the fence,'' Ms.
Teague said.

<HEAD>Police Seize 8.8 Pounds of Uranium Allegedly Offered for Sale to
U.S. Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today that they seized the 8.8 pounds of
uranium that was offered for sale to the U.S. Embassy in a case that
has already netted seven arrests.
   The uranium was seized Sunday at a food dealer's house in in
Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, 560 miles southwest of the capital.
   It was contained in 41 glass bottles in six X-ray prevention
bags, said an official of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department,
who spoke anonymously.
   The official said police experts on chemical materials analyzed
the substance discovered and found it was natural uranium.
   On Sept. 1, police arrested five people on charges of illegal
possession of nuclear substances after they took a capsule
containing about 3.5 ounces of uranium to the U.S. Embassy in early
August and proposed to sell another 8.8 pounds of the same substance
for $83 million.
   Two more people were arrested on Tuesday and Friday and an eighth
person, Mitsuteru Tomoda, a 51-year-old antique art dealer, was put
on a wanted list.
   Another police official, also requesting anonymity, said the food
dealer told investigators Tomoda had asked him to keep the uranium.
   The first official said the food dealer, whose name was not
disclosed, reported the uranium case to local police after
consulting with a lawyer.
   He identified the arrested group's leader as Toshiko Nishijima, a
43-year-old woman who owns several small companies.
   Uranium, a radioactive element, can be used in concentrated forms
to make nuclear weapons and run nuclear power plants.
   Police have said analysis of the uranium seized earlier showed it
was refined natural uranium of 70.7 percent purity.
   The Science and Technology Agency's analysis said only 0.7
percent of the uranium was uranium-235, the element used for power
generation and for bombs, while the rest was uranium-238.
   Nuclear experts said nuclear power generation needs uranium
containing more than 3 percent uranium-235 and an atomic bomb
requires uranium that contains more than 90 percent uranium-235.
   Police still were investigating the source of the group's uranium
and why the group tried to sell it to the U.S. Embassy at more than
2,000 times its market value of $275 an ounce.
   In Japan, the handling of uranium is strictly regulated by law.

<TEXT>
   The big drive of '89 ended with a sigh as
well as a whoop.
   ``It was too soon,'' said wagon master Dave Stephens. ``I wish
the city limits would have been another 50 miles down the road.''
   Many of the 2,400 real and would-be cowboys who rode the six-day,
60-mile trail from Roundup to Billings with Stephens clearly felt
the same way. Hundreds lingered Saturday to savor the memories.
   The Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive, celebrating Montana's
statehood anniversary, brought 2,700 cattle across open range with
the help of 2,400 horseback riders and 200 covered wagons.
   ``I feel proud,'' said trail boss Jay Stovall. ``I know there
were skeptics, but I knew we could do it all the time.''
   Two cattle died, one just before the drive began on Labor Day in
the town of Roundup. Two calves were born along the way. Five people
were injured seriously enough that they had to leave the drive. A
couple of wagons were disabled.
   Stovall's 105 drovers brought the herd through a huge welcoming
crowd along Billings' Main Street on Saturday as if they did it
every day. Police estimated the throng at 25,000 to 30,000 _ more
than a fourth of the city's entire population.
   The cattle, mostly longhorns, climaxed a spectacular parade of
the riders and covered wagons.
   ``It all went very well, although it didn't go according to
plan,'' said Police Chief Gene Kiser.
   Police said not only was there no huge traffic snarl, as feared.
There also were no traffic accidents, injuries, or arrests.
   Only some of the wagons were supposed to join the parade, but on
Friday night Barry McWiliams, one of the drive's originators,
announced in camp that all would go.
   ``Some bureaucrats said that it would cause too many problems,''
he told the assembly. ``I told them either we all go or none of us
go.''
   Latigo Corp., the non-profit company created to put on the drive,
turns now to tabulating the costs and incomes. Any money above
expenses is to go into an endowment fund to help finance a variety
of rural projects.
   Latigo officials had said earlier the drive would cost $400,000
to $1 million and that final figures could not be determined until
after the drive.
   An auction of Western memorabilia and art was held Saturday
afternoon, and the grand finale of the drive was a country music
concert Saturday night that drew 4,200 people to see such musical
stars as Lee Greenwood, Sheb Wooley and Hoyt Axton.

<HEAD>W.Va. Governor Blamed for Defeat of Three Referendums</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two state officials who campaigned
against a referendum that would have eliminated their jobs said the
results of the special balloting show voters are disenchanted with
Gov. Gaston Caperton.
   But that assessment by Secretary of State Ken Hechler and
Agriculture Commissioner Cleve Benedict, who fought hard against the
amendments, was disputed by Caperton and state Democratic Party
Chairman Lloyd Jackson.
   They maintained the amendments failed because voters were fooled
by an anti-amendment campaign that unfairly said Caperton was power
hungry.
   One of the amendments would have eliminated the jobs of secretary
of state, treasurer and agriculture commissioner. Eleven percent of
those voting supported that amendment. The results were 217,582
against and 28,095 for with 99 percent of the vote tabulated.
   The other amendments would have brought the state Board of
Education under Caperton's control and allowed county governments to
restructure.
   The education amendment was defeated 217,727 to 28,670, with 88
percent of the voters saying no. The county reorganization amendment
was defeated 199,507 to 46,573, with 81 percent voting against it.
   West Virginia House Speaker Chuck Chambers said the 30 percent
voter turnout showed that voters are fed up with state government.
   Chambers said Caperton is unpopular because of a record $392
million in tax increases the governor pushed through the Legislature
this year.

   The dollar opened higher but fell back on
profit-taking today in early European trading. Gold prices were
lower.
   Dealers said the dollar was higher at the opening but failed to
break the important psychological barrier of 2 German marks.
   They said the dollar retreated on short-term profit-taking and
position adjustments although they said it was likely to resume its
advance after the U.S. market opened.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.15 yen to a closing 147.77 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a rate of 147.65 yen.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.5408 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5505 late Friday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Friday:

   Hundreds of supporters of Ferdinand Marcos
attended a birthday party for the former Philippine president as he
remained hospitalized in critical condition.
   The celebration was held outside his home Sunday, the day before
his 72nd birthday.
   Earlier Sunday, his wife, Imelda, attended Mass with him in his
room at St. Francis Medical Center.
   ``When we got to the hospital early this morning, the president
was without fever and his blood pressure was normal,'' Mrs. Marcos
told the cheering crowd.
   It was Marcos' fourth birthday in exile. The Marcoses were exiled
here in 1986 when a popular revolt led Corazon Aquino to take over
the presidency. She has refused to let Marcos return, citing
national security concerns.
   They face federal racketeering charges in the United States for
allegedly looting more than $100 million from their country to buy
art and real estate in New York.
   ``If it is the last thing that I will do in my life, I would try
to vindicate the sacred honor and the good name of Ferdinand Marcos
and the entire republic,'' Mrs. Marcos said.
   Among those at the party was Philippine singer Imelda Pappin, who
had a birthday wish for Marcos.
   ``I wish that he will live longer,'' Ms. Pappin said.
   Marcos, who was hospitalized in January, is suffering from lung,
heart and kidney failure. Marcos' medical condition has led him to
be seperated from the racketeering case.

<HEAD>Soviet Ambassador Confirms Gorbachev Will Meet The Pope</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs of background.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet Pope John Paul II for
the first time when the Soviet president travels to Italy in
November, the Soviet ambassador to Italy says.
   ``Yes, why not,'' replied Ambassador Nikolai Lunkov when
reporters in Genoa asked him Saturday if Gorbachev would meet with
the pope during the visit.
   Although such a meeting has been considered likely, neither the
Vatican nor the Kremlin had confirmed it will take place. The
Polish-born pontiff earlier this year said he would be ready to
receive Gorbachev.
   It would be the first meeting between the leader of the world's
850 million Roman Catholics and the head of the Soviet Communist
Party, which disparages religion.
   The Soviet ambassador spoke to reporters in Genoa at the Italian
Communist Party's annual festival. The party's newspaper, L`Unita,
also quoted Lunkov as praising the Roman Catholic Church's efforts
for peace in the world.
   Asked whether Moscow would open an embassy to the Holy See,
Lunkov said such things take time. ``One must be realistic about
everything.''
   The Vatican has reportedly been preparing for a Gorbachev visit
since the Soviet leader sent a letter to the pope in August.
Gorbachev expressed interest in meeting the pontiff to ``talk
business'' about historically troubled Vatican-Soviet relations,
according to a senior Vatican official.
   In Moscow, Soviet sources said Gorbachev is expected to visit
Italy starting Nov. 25.
   The Vatican official said the letter from Gorbachev was delivered
to the pope last month by Yuri Karlov, an aide to Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Chief topics for a Gorbachev-pope meeting, the Vatican official
said, would be the Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania, where
there are large numbers of Roman Catholics, and the Ukrainian
Catholic Church, which is a major stumbling block to improved
Vatican-Moscow ties.
   The Vatican does not recognize the annexation of Lithuania by the
Soviet Union in 1940, and a Lithuanian exile mission is accredited
to the Holy See.
   The Ukrainian Catholic Church was forcibly merged with the
Russian Orthodox Church under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1946.
But there is a strong underground Ukrainian church and Ukrainian
faithful have been carrying out public protests seeking official
recognition of their church.

<HEAD>Dingell, Bliley Say Cooperation Has Been Grudging and Limited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two generic drug manufacturers have not
cooperated fully with a House subcommittee and have misled
investigators, leaders of the panel told a federal judge who will
sentence former officials of the companies.
   ``The industry has misbehaved seriously,'' Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee, said today on NBC's ``Today'' show, also charging that
the FDA ``has not done its job as it should have.''
   ``Questions now exist as to whether or not these drugs are
bioequivalent,'' said Dingell. ``And unfortunately, we're now in the
position where we can't say they're safe. The process has to be
redone and we have to find out just what is going on here.''
   Dingell and Thomas Bliley, R-Va., the panel's ranking Republican,
said in a letter to U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove in
Baltimore that the companies' cooperation has been ``grudging and
limited.''
   The congressmen released the letter Sunday.
   Ashok Patel, former senior vice president of Par Pharmaceuticals
Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., and Dilip Shah, former president of
Quad Pharmaceutical Inc., an Indianapolis-based subsidiary of Par,
pleaded guilty to bribing Food and Drug Administration chemists to
win approval for generic drug applications.
   The subcommittee's inquiry into the generic drug industry has
resulted in charges against three FDA employees and action to take
dozens of generic drugs off the market.
   Current and former officials of the two companies were subpoenaed
to testify before the subcommittee Monday.
   FDA officials also were scheduled to testify about recent
inspections at the plants of 11 generic drug companies being
investigated by the agency.

   The Justice Department says a teen-ager who
disarmed a student holding 70 people hostage and a girl who saved a
tourist from drowning in Hawaii will receive the 1988 Young American
Medals for Bravery.
   Ruben Ortega, 19, of Alhambra, Calif., disarmed a student who
brought an assault rifle into an English class at San Gabriel High
School on April 26, 1988 and held 70 students hostage for a half
hour.
   Ruben, who was one of the hostages, risked his life by grabbing
the rifle and the gunman, wrestling him to the ground.
   The youth and other students held the gunmen to the ground until
police arrived.
   Angela Marie Campanoli, now 12, dove into rough waters near her
home in Maui last Oct. 5 to save a Japanese woman who was being
swept out to sea. The girl held the woman's head above water until
help arrived, the department said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said that the two youths would
be given the awards by President Bush at a date to be announced

<NOTE>Republican Congressman Accuses CIA of Bungling</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Congressman is charging that the CIA and
Pakistani intelligence have bungled the war in Afghanistan,
threatening to turn what appeared to be a victory by anti-Communist
guerrillas into a triumph for the Soviet-backed government there.
   ``The CIA has secretly pursued a wrongheaded Afghan policy for
years,'' the chairman of the Republican Task Force on Terrorism and
Unconventional Warfare, Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, charged in an
article published Sunday in the editorial section of the Washington
Post.
   The most recent blunder, he wrote, was to shut off the supply of
U.S. arms while pressuring Afghan guerrillas into launching an
assault on the Afghan city of Jalalabad near the Pakistani border.
   At the same time, the Soviet Union continued massive arms
supplies to its client in Kabul, enabling that government to
withstand the assault.
   The siege of Jalalabad has turned into a stalemate that threatens
to stall the entire resistance movement.
   The key mistake by the Central Intelligence Agency and the State
Department was to give control U.S. arms shipments to the guerrillas
to Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence, that nation's equivalent
of the CIA, McCollum wrote.
   ``Why the CIA gave ISI its proxy was easier to understand in the
beginning,'' as the United States began to arm the Moslem
guerrillas, or mujahedeen, after the 1979 Soviet invasion, McCollum
wrote.

   Gro Harlem Brundtland's governing Labor Party
braced for an election setback as Norwegians cast ballots today in a
hard-fought parliamentary election.
   Pre-election surveys predicted the non-socialist opposition
parties would win a majority. But disagreements may prevent them
from negotiating a common program, and Mrs. Brundtland could
continue as prime minister by default.
   Mrs. Brundtland voted shortly after polls opened at 9 a.m. under
bright sunshine. ``It's a good day for an election,'' she said.
   The prime minister arrived with her husband Arne Olav Brundtland,
who was wearing a campaign badge for the opposition Conservative
Party. The political division in the Brundtland family is the butt
of much national humor.
   Asked if she won any new supporters over the breakfast table,
Mrs. Brundtland said she didn't eat breakfast this morning.
   The first election results, based on computer projections and
pre-election surveys, were expected shortly after the polls close at
9 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT).
   Final results may become clear only Wednesday because of a new
election system that adds eight seats, apportioned according to
nationwide results, to the 157 seats elected by 19 regional
districts.
   Some 3.2 million people are eligible to vote for parliament,
which sits four years. There is no mechanism for early elections.
   Based on the three latest polls, the NTB news agency on Sunday
forecast that the non-socialist parties would win 85 seats, while
Labor and the Left Socialist Party would take a total of 80 seats.
   ``There is a clear non-socialist majority. The question is
whether they can translate that into a clear majority in
parliament,'' said Bernt Ole Aardal, of the Institute for Social
Research.
   He said Mrs. Brundtland has regained some of her lost support
during the campaign, which some critics have described as unusually
dirty for this easy-going Scandinavian country. ``She has run a
strong campaign. If she ends up with 35 percent, that would be a
success,'' Aardal said.
   Campaigning was abruptly suspended after Friday's crash of a
chartered aircraft carrying Norwegian shipping company workers on a
celebration flight to West Germany to christen a new ship. All 55
people on board died.
   Mrs. Brundtland, who was briefly prime minister in 1981, has
headed a minority Labor government since a three-party non-socialist
coalition resigned in 1986.
   Her support has dropped from 40.8 percent in the 1985 election to
around 33 percent in some recent surveys, as she appeared to be
paying for the excesses she blamed on her predecessors in the
free-spending days when oil wealth poured in from North Sea fields.
   She has been hurt by public discontent with high taxes, high
prices and a social welfare system which seemed on the verge of a
breakdown.
   Norwegians pay as much as 62.7 percent income tax in the top
bracket, and international surveys list Oslo as the most expensive
city in Europe.
   At the same time, waiting lines for public hospitals have
lengthened, there is a shortage of day-care centers and critics say
education standards have plummeted.
   Economists have praised Mrs. Brundtland's tough wage-restraint
program, which helped halve inflation since 1987 to 4.8 percent and
turned a balance of payments deficit into a surplus.
   But unemployment nearly tripled to a record 5 percent in two
years and the benefits of an improving economy have not filtered
down to the public.
   Though she chaired the U.N. World Commission on Environment and
Development, the prime minister has come under sharp attack at home
for letting industries contaminate some of Norway's once pristine
fjords.
   To replace Mrs. Brundtland, Conservative Party leader Jan P. Syse
must rely on the support of the maverick Party of Progress, which
has made dramatic gains on a platform of sharply cutting taxes and
privatizing public companies and services.
   The Progress Party is led by Carl I. Hagen, a 45-year-old
British-educated former marketing executive who has become the star
of the political stage with his television good looks and
unrestrained attacks on the establishment.
   Hagen won just 3.7 percent in 1985, but he took 12 percent in
local elections in 1987 and had about 20 percent support in opinion
polls as late as last month. The most recent polls showed him
sliding back to below 15 percent.

<HEAD>Dollar Hits Three-Month High Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar shot up to a three-month high against the
Japanese yen today despite the central bank's dollar-selling
intervention, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell
marginally.
   The dollar closed at 147.77 yen, up 1.15 yen from Friday's
146.62-yen finish. It opened at 147.75 yen and ranged between 147.50
yen and 148.03 yen.
   It was the dollar's highest close since 151.30 on June 15. It has
gained 4.69 yen since Aug. 30.
   Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said that
after its high opening, the dollar moved little, ``mainly because
Japanese participants who were afraid of central bank intervention
avoided major moves.''
   The Bank of Japan sold the U.S. currency to support the yen, but
the amount it sold was unknown. The bank does not comment on its
exchange market activities.
   ``The market is expecting the dollar to climb as high as 148.50
yen, but it won't happen overnight,'' Ms. Takeuchi said.
   ``Because of a steady dollar-selling drive among those who had
kept too many dollars, the currency will rise only slowly ... but
surely, because the dollar-buying demand is much stronger,'' she
said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 2.15 points,
or 0.006 percent, finishing at 34,113.66. The market rallied in the
afternoon after losing 77.30 points in the morning and 36.75 points
last Friday.
   Dealers attributed the index's fall largely to the yen's recent
weakness against the dollar.
   Genjiro Sasaki, a stock dealer with New Japan Securities Co.,
said the index started to recover as foreign investors bought Nikkei
index issues as part of arbitrage deals.
   He added that some investors also helped the index's recovery by
picking up issues that had fallen earlier.
   ``The majority of market players, however, remained on the
sidelines, discouraged by the weak yen and falling bond prices,''
Sasaki said.

<HEAD>Strike Ends in Soviet Azerbaijan, Still on in Moldavia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan ended
a weeklong strike today that had been called to protest Kremlin
control of a disputed territory.
   Leaders of the Azerbaijan People's Front, a nationalist group
that called a republic-wide strike more than a week ago, said on
television Sunday night that most of their political demands had
been met, local activists and journalists said.
   The People's Front will be officially recognized and allowed to
speak at a special session of the republic's Supreme Soviet
legislature on Friday, group spokesman Ekhtibar Mamedov said.
   The legislature is to address the strikers' principal demand, the
return of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani
control, Mamedov said, speaking by telephone from Azerbaijan's
capital, Baku.
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis have been locked in a dispute over the
mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh for more than 18 months. The
conflict has cost 100 lives and forced thousands to flee their homes.
   Moscow took the region, which is in Azerbaijan but populated
mainly by ethnic Armenians, under its direct control last winter to
try and calm the area, but both sides continue to press their claims
to it.
   Azerbaijan's idled railroads resumed operating today and workers
at all enterprises went back to work, journalist Nazim Ragimov said
from Baku. The city's many oil refineries were reported to be at
least partially functioning throughout the strike.
   Trains were running everywhere in Azerbaijan except on routes to
the neighboring Caucasus republic of Armenia, Ragimov said.
   In the republic of Moldavia, the newspaper Pravda said today that
organizers called for an end to a 3-week-old walkout, but the
republic's strike committee issued a statement this morning denying
the report.
   Committee member Dmitri Kondratovich charged the account in the
Communist Party daily was part of ``a campaign of disinformation
aimed at stifling and splitting the strike movement.''
   Many ethnic Russians and other minorities work in the republic
went on strike in mid-August to protest a proposed bill that would
make Moldavian the republic's official language.
   Most strikers went back to work after the republic's legislature
passed a compromise law recognizing the use of some Russian, but
Kondratovich, speaking from the largely Russian city of Tiraspol,
said employees at more than 200 factories remained off the job.
   The Pravda report quoted strike leader Vladimir Rylyakov as
saying the strike already achieved its goals. ``We called the
attention of everyone in the republic, even in the country, to the
increasing nationalist and extremist phenomena'' in Moldavia, he
said.
   The strikes demonstrated the economic damage that can result from
the explosive relations between the Soviet Union's scores of ethnic
groups.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned in a televised speech
Saturday night that strikes could lead to ``dangerous consequences
for society'' and that the country ``should not tolerate the huge
economic losses'' they create.
   The Azerbaijani strike was reported to have cost the economy $192
million in lost industrial production alone. Mamedov said the
People's Front estimates the total damage thus far at almost $480
million.
   Mamedov said the threat remains that the strike will be renewed.
``If anything unforeseen happens, we'll resume the strike,'' he said.

   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia goes on trial this week
on charges he, his wife and her lawyer extorted $185,000, including
a diamond and emerald necklace, from Wedtech, the now-defunct
defense contractor.
   The 56-year-old Democrat is accused of using his position to
obtain the payoffs from Wedtech, once acclaimed as a model of
minority-owned businesses.
   This is likely to be the last of seven trials from the Wedtech
scandal. Already convicted were such figures as Rep. Mario Biaggi,
D-N.Y., and Stanley Simon, borough president of the Bronx.
   Jury selection was set to begin today in federal court; opening
arguments are scheduled a week later. Garcia faces up to 20 years in
prison.
   Garcia was indicted in November, three days after Biaggi drew an
eight-year sentence in a Wedtech racketeering case. Biaggi resigned
from the U.S. House and is in prison.
   Garcia, his wife, Jane Lee, and lawyer Ralph Vallone Jr. are
accused of a bribery-extortion scheme to get $185,000 from Wedtech
officials in checks, interest-free loans and, for Mrs. Garcia, a
jeweled necklace.
   Because of illness, Vallone's trial was postponed until the
spring, The New York Times reported today.
   The government is expected to present witnesses who will testify
that Garcia demanded payments from Wedtech that were routed through
his wife's political consulting business.
   The indictment said the payments were demanded to influence
Garcia's ``performance of official acts for and on behalf of
Wedtech.''
   Garcia, the son of a Pentecostal minister, since 1978 has
represented a a district that includes the South Bronx.
   Wedtech, once a small South Bronx machine shop, grew into a $100
million government contractor through a federal program that set
aside contracts without bidding for minority-controlled companies.
   Evidence at earlier trials showed Wedtech continued to receive
no-bid contracts through bribery even after it ceased to be
minority-owned. It went out of business in 1986 after allegations
about illegal activity were made public.

<HEAD>Time: Former HUD Secretary Pierce Denies He Tolerated Misconduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce says he
played no favorites in his years with the Reagan administration.
   A congressional investigation has found numerous irregularities
at the Department of Housing and Urban Development under Pierce,
including political favoritism in awarding of contracts and
embezzlement by real estate agents.
   The former HUD secretary said in this week's Time magazine: ``No
request was to be given any special advantage because it was
submitted by a Republican. ... My decisions were based on facts, law
and logic, not on political party.''
   During his tenure, Pierce was known as ``Silent Sam,'' the
invisible man of the Reagan Cabinet who preferred to sit in his
office and watch television.
   But Pierce said, ``Such characterizations are lopsided. They
disregard the assignment President Reagan gave me _ to reduce the
size and the cost of government while helping the most needy _ and
they bypass my achievements.''
   Among other things, Congress has found that GOP consultants were
paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to win contracts for
well-connected developers.
   While Pierce said he never intervened in the awarding of
lucrative contracts, he acknowledged writing memos to his staff
telling them to give ``careful consideration'' to certain projects,
Time reported.
   In a related matter, The New York Times reported today that
Pierce ordered broad financial concessions for a luxury apartment
complex in Chicago despite the objections of a senior federal
housing official.
   The official, the newspaper reported, became so concerned about
the $23 million deal that he refused to sign mortgage documents.
   Documents indicate that Pierce issued the 1987 order after the
intervention on the project's behalf by a White House official, two
members of Congress, a former secretary of defense and the
University of Chicago, the Times said.
   Thomas T. Demery, former assistant secretary of housing, told the
Times that he felt the concession provided to the owner of the
Regents Park apartments ``were unfair to the taxpayer.''
   The apartment complex was built in the 1970s with nearly $26
million in federally insured mortgages, the Times reported. When the
original owners had financial problems, the title was transferred to
Bruce E. Clinton, who made extensive repairs under an agreement that
reduced the mortgage payments due to HUD, the paper said.
   Demery told the Times that he didn't think the concessions were
necessary.

   Boris Becker defeated top-ranked Ivan Lendl to
win his first U.S. Open and give West Germany a sweep of the singles
competition at the Grand Slam tennis tournament.
   In a struggle that lasted nearly four hours and with temperatures
on court climbing to 110 degrees, the second seed won 7-6, 1-6, 6-3,
7-6. The 21-year-old Becker won his third Wimbledon crown in July.
   ``This is much more exhausting,'' Becker said, comparing the Open
to his July victory at Wimbledon. ``It's even more exhausting than
the French Open, with the heat, the planes and the spectators.''
   Becker's Open victory earned him $300,000. Lendl, 29, a Czech who
now lives in Greenwich, Conn., earned $150,000.
   On Saturday, West German Steffi Graf came from behind to defeat
Martina Navratilova 3-6, 7-5, 6-1.
   In the women's doubles championship finals, Navratilova and Hana

   The condition of East German leader
Erich Honecker, who underwent gall bladder surgery last month, has
deteriorated badly, West German news media reported today.
   Government officials in Bonn declined comment on the reports.
   The ZDF television network today quoted Western diplomatic
sources in Hungary as saying Honecker's medical condition ``has
deteriorated considerably.
   ``According to information that allegedly comes from Communist
Party officials, Honecker has no mental verve and no wish to get
better,'' the network said. Honecker has been recovering from gall
bladder surgery he underwent last month.
   Honecker, 77, has staunchly resisted the reforms sweeping much of
the Soviet bloc. Tens of thousands of East Germans are fleeing their
country because of dissatisfaction with the political and economic
situation there.
   ``Critics in the Politburo reportedly are charging that Honecker
misjudged the meaning and scope of the wave of refugees,'' ZDF said.
   ZDF previously had said there were indications that Honecker was
``no longer fully able to reason.''
   Today, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said in its front-page
headline: ``Honecker Wants to Die.''
   The Hamburg-based newspaper added: ``The condition of the
Communist leader has worsened badly.'' Citing unidentified sources
in East Berlin, Bild said that Honecker ``has lost the will to
live.''
   Bild is published by the giant Springer concern, which has been
bitterly at odds with Communist East Germany for decades.
   In East Berlin over the weekend, Communist party sources said
there were ``clear signs'' that Honecker's mental capacity was
failing and that his health problems had delayed several top-level
decisions.
   The sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also told
The Associated Press that it was difficult to gauge Honecker's exact
condition.
   In Bonn, Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog told the AP
in a telephone interview that reports on Honecker's condition are
``pure speculation. We have no first-hand information on this.''
   Western intelligence sources two weeks ago said Honecker's gall
bladder surgery had to be abandoned due to weakness of surrounding
tissue. News reports also speculated that Honecker has cancer.
   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN said early this month
that Honecker had been released from the hospital and taken a
vacation to recover. ADN has not carried any other recent reports on
the Communist leader's health.

<TEXT>
   A Volkswagen-sized rock lodged in the mangled
hull of the Exxon Valdez is among the obstacles workers face today
when they begin repairs on the tanker that caused the nation's worst
oil spill.
   During the nine-month repair job, 3,200 tons of steel will be
used to patch the hull of the 29,000-ton tanker that struck a reef
March 24 in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   Reporters were allowed to view the hull Saturday for the first
time as workers at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. prepared
to start the repairs, estimated at $25 million.
   The Valdez is sitting 5 feet off the ground in a dry dock on
dozens of concrete pylons. Massive hydraulic shorings are also
supporting the tanker along its starboard side.
   By far, the largest visible damage was to a 300-by-80-foot
section of the starboard side. The area is a rusted patchwork of
scraped metal, tatered, gaping holes and twisted shards of steel.
   ``It's a very humbling experience to stand here and see what
Mother Nature can do to three-quarter-inch steel,'' NASSCO president
Richard Vortman said. ``There is damage to the structure in addition
to just the skin of the ship.''
   The Valdez was built by NASSCO in the same dry dock and launched
in 1986. It would cost up to $150 million to build a new tanker the
same size, Vortmann said.
   ``We have never done repairs to a ship anywhere near as
extensively damaged as this ship,'' he said. ``This will be a lot
more difficult than building a ship from scratch. It's harder to
build the bottom floors of a building when the upper floors already
exist.''
   One rock ``about the size of a Volkswagen Bug'' and another that
weighs an estimated 6,000 pounds are lodged in the torn hull,
Vortmann said.
   Both rocks are part of the reef that the Valdez struck while
loaded with nearly 53 million gallons of oil. The puncture sent
nearly 11 million gallons of crude pouring into the water.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congress Turns From Scandal to Money Decisions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS ``are to be repaired'' to ``is to be repaired'' in
graf 6, Billions are.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a steamy summer ends, the
Democratic-controlled 101st Congress is turning from its earlier
preoccupation with scandal to face the reality that the demands
before it far exceed the ability to pay for them.
   As Congress steps up the pace after its summer recess, the calls
upon it seem endless.
   Poland's newly installed non-communist government wants American
cash to bring quick change to a crippled economy and build its
strength for the future.
   Billions are needed for the war on drugs; billions are needed for
the war on AIDS.
   President Bush wants billions to spur the development of new
American technology, not to mention finding a way to send a space
expedition to Mars.
   Billions are demanded to house the homeless. Billions will be
required if the nation's aging superstructure of highways and
bridges and sewers is to be repaired and replaced.
   The Pentagon seeks billions for the B-1 stealth bomber and the
Midgetman mobile missile.
   Money is demanded for pay raises for federal judges and civil
servants and congressmen. The Senate is earmarking a few million to
improve its subway system so senators can zip more quickly from
their offices to the Senate floor to avoid missing roll-call votes.
   Some of the money will be found, including billions to bail out
the savings and loan industry. Without new taxes, most of it will
not.
   And if the deficit reduction goals of the Gramm-Rudman law are to
be met, many existing and popular spending programs must be cut.
   But congressional Democrats are not about to seek the funds by
attacking President Bush's ``no-new-taxes'' political fortress.
   ``We're not going to have a light cavalry charge into the face of
a certain veto,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said last
week.
   But Mitchell said Bush may find himself on the wrong side of a
credibility gap if he continues to propose costly new programs
without saying how he proposes to pay for them.
   ``We face these constant and, it seems, accelerating, pressures''
to reduce the federal deficit and ``deal with these emerging
demands,'' Mitchell said.
   ``The president wants to go to Mars, but there is no plan, no
timetable, no price given.''
   ``I think that what is going to happen is that the appeal of the
president's position is going to erode. The gap between his rhetoric
and action, words and deeds, continues to grow,'' Mitchell said.
   While Congress is unhappy at the ``real pain'' involved in
attempting to deal with superpower problems in a tight-money age,
many are pleased that the focus seems to have shifted to substance,
that most of the purely personal controversies that dominated the
early months of the session appear to have been left behind.
   These include the Senate fight that saw the defeat of John
Tower's nomination as the nation's defense chief and the battle over
ethics that led to the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright.
   To Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., Congress seems less ideologically
torn this year in spite of the bruising political struggle over
Wright.
   And the principal friction now remaining between the Capitol and
White House, Hamilton said, ``is that the president seems unwilling
to back his good intentions with money.''
   But the hope remains that crippling distractions such as the
fights over Tower and Wright are now over.
   ``Members welcome the change from the paralyzing obsession with
scandal and ethics,'' he said.

   Hurricane Gabrielle was downgraded to a tropical storm in the
north Atlantic after its far-flung swells capsized boats from Maine
to New York and swept beachgoers out to sea.
   At least six people were missing, and three others apparently
drowned.
   ``People shouldn't be out there,'' said Jarred Randall, a
Narragansett, R.I., police sergeant who rescued two teen-agers from
the water Saturday night. ``It's just so majestic and inviting, but
it isn't safe.''
   Though hundreds of miles from land, Gabrielle's silent, windless
surges stirred waters along the Northeast over the weekend.
Officials attributed the deaths to the sea swells, undertow and
waves that reached 15 feet, even on rivers.
   By late Sunday, Gabrielle's highest sustained wind had decreased
to 65 mph, below the 74 mph threshhold for hurricanes, the National
Hurricane Center in Florida said. Gabrielle had reached 135 mph at
its height last week.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, its center was located near latitude 38.8
north, longitude 62.5 west, or about 375 miles south southwest of
Sable Island, Nova Scotia.
   Gabrielle had remained almost stationary for more than a day and
was expected to weaken further because it was over water too cold to
provide energy for its circulation.
   Meanwhile, another tropical depression formed and appeared headed
for storm status, forecasters said today. Its center was near
latitude 13.0 north and longitude 25.7 west, or about 150 miles
south-southwest of the southernmost Cape Verde islands of Africa. It
was moving west at about 17 mph with wind estimated at 35 mph.
   ``This is the peak of the tropical storm season and these
tropical waves are moving off the coast of Africa every three or
four days like clockwork,'' said hurricane specialist Max Mayfield
at the hurricane center in Coral Gables.
   Gabrielle has been churning in the Atlantic since Aug. 31. Its
vastness and power has prompted comparisons with last year's
Hurricane Gilbert, which devastated Jamaica.
   Jeff Waldstreicher, a meteorologist at the National Weather
Service in Boston, said the waves and undertow were fierce up and
down the coast.
   ``You have these strong, 100-plus mile an hour winds that
generate all these waves and long after the waves have crested you
have all this energy, moving the water from east to west,''
Waldstreicher said.
   A 19-year-old Cushing, Maine, woman apparently fell into the surf
while walking with her brother and cousin Saturday night along the
rocky shore at the fishing village of Tenants Harbor, the Coast
Guard said.
   The two men went into the water after her and also were quickly
swept away from shore. A fishing boat picked them up. Despite a
Coast Guard search, the woman remained missing Sunday.
   A Coast Guard helicopter rescued two surfers who got in trouble
off New Hampshire on Sunday. At the time, the chopper was heading to
Salisbury Beach, Mass., to search for a missing swimmer, said Coast
Guard Quartermaster 1st Class David Jersey in Boston.
   No one was found, Jersey said.
   And north of Boston, an Ipswich police patrol boat searched for a
25-year-old man who vanished in the rough waters of the Ipswich
River north of Cape Ann. The man was with two other men and a baby
sailing in an 18-foot motor boat Saturday when the vessel capsized,
the Coast Guard said. The others were rescued by a passing vessel.
   Off New York, divers searched the Atlantic for a 37-year-old man
missing after a houseboat capsized two miles out.
   Authorities recovered the body of a 58-year-old woman who was on
the houseboat when it capsized. She apparently drowned.
   Two fishermen in their 30s were swept off a New York City jetty
Saturday afternoon by a large wave. Searchers could not find the men.
   In New Jersey, a man died after being pulled unconscious from
heavy surf Sunday at Barnegat Light, said police. A woman who was
pulled out with him was revived and under intensive care at a
hospital.
   A man drowned at Normandy Beach, but no other details were
available, Dover Township police said.

   Soviet maverick Boris N. Yeltsin said today that
Mikhail Gorbachev has about six months to a year to achieve domestic
progress or face revolution.
   Unless the Soviet president can show progress during that time,
Yeltsin said, ``We're going to have some very difficult times. And
this is something I want to discuss with the American
administration.''
   Yeltsin said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that by
``difficult times'' he means ``movement from below. It means
revolution from below.'' He added it already has begun in the form
of strikes, which are isolated but could spread and affect the
entire country.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
asserted that Yeltsin was expressing his own views and not those of
the Soviet government.
   Yeltsin and other deputies of the Soviet parliament on visits to
the United States ``are all unofficial delegations,'' Gerasimov said
at a news conference.
   A deputy has a right to his opinion, Gerasimov said, ``but it
doesn't necessarily coincide with the government's point of view.''
   ``If you want the official point of view, listen to the Foreign
Ministry,'' he said. ``If you want pluralism, listen to the
deputies.''
   On Sunday, Yeltsin said newly elected Soviet officials will take
power from the Communist Party into their own hands as Gorbachev's
fortunes decline.
   ``We're having an economic crisis, a financial crisis, a
political crisis, the living standard is falling,'' Yeltsin said at
a news conference Sunday during his first trip to the United States.
   ``We need a person who is more decisive than Gorbachev,'' he
said, adding that a revolution by the masses would be needed because
``we're not really getting a revolution from above.''
   But Yeltsin, chairman of a newly-formed independent caucus in the
Soviet Congress, ruled out the possibility of a coup.
   ``A coup d'etat is pretty unrealistic,'' said Yeltsin, who
arrived in New York on Saturday to begin a private trip of about two
weeks sponsored by the Esalen Institute's Soviet-American Exchange
Program.
   Yeltsin, 58, lost his position as Moscow's Communist party chief
in 1987 after criticizing the slow pace of change under Gorbachev.
But this year he was elected with 90 percent of the vote to the
Soviet Congress, where he is an outspoken member of a radical bloc.
   He said his country should learn from American democracy while
changing its own political system.
   ``We have to take what is positive ... from America's more than
200 years of democratic experience, and on the basis of that create
a new model of socialism,'' he said on CBS News' ``Face the Nation.''
   ``I think you have a very healthy society here,'' he said. ``It
seems as if capitalism is not rotting away and will not soon rot
itself into extinction as we were told _ rather it seems to be
prospering.''
   Yeltsin said he hoped to meet with President Bush to discuss how
the United States ``could participate in measures to rescue
perestroika.''
   But he said he has received no indication from the White House
about the possibility of such a meeting.
   Roman Popadiuk, a White House spokesman, said he was not aware of
Yeltsin's desire to meet with Bush and that there were no plans for
such as a meeting.
   Yeltsin said the Soviet Union needs a new model of socialism,
possibly including a multi-party system.
   ``We have to stop being so dogmatic as we were before,'' he said.
   He said the countries of Eastern Europe that were once ``pulled
along'' by the Soviet Union have now ``overtaken it.''
   ``They're now pulling us along, because they can at least feed
and clothe their own citizens.''
   The $25,000 fees sponsors say Yeltsin will receive for speeches
during his tour will help fund AIDS research in the Soviet Union.
   Appearances have been announced in New York, Philadelphia,
Chicago, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Dallas, Miami and
Washington, although final details of the schedule were not set.
   Sitting with reporters in the Central Park apartment of his
American host, Yeltsin said he felt ``twice as free'' after circling
the Statue of Liberty in a helicopter.
   His 24 hours in New York had changed his ideas about America from
``the impression which has been pounded into my head in the
U.S.S.R.,'' he said.
   ``Americans are in no way aggressive or badly behaved _ in fact,
they are very polite and optimistic, lively, well-intentioned and
know how to live and know how to work.''

   Six months ago Mayor Edward I. Koch was an
anyone-can-beat-him underdog. Now he's a comeback-of-the-year
contender in his quest for an unprecedented fourth term.
   Polls have the three-term incumbent running nearly even with his
prime opponent, Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, in
Tuesday's Democratic primary. Strategists on both sides said their
ability to turn out voters would decide the election.
   ``I think it's going to be very, very close,'' said David Garth,
Koch's political and media adviser. Asked his plans for last-minute
appeals, he joked: ``We're going to ask the people to join us in
prayer.''
   ``It's neck and neck. I don't think you can ever count out an
incumbent who has been in office as long as Ed Koch,'' said Bill
Lynch, Dinkins' campaign manager. He claimed a slight lead,
confirmed by most polls.
   A survey conducted Friday and Saturday by WABC-TV and the Daily
News found 49 percent for Dinkins and 45 percent for Koch. But the
margin of error for that poll was 6 points, and previous polls
showed the race within the margin of error.
   Koch has declared: ``A big turnout, I win.'' But he also
expressed more anxiety about this race than any other in his career.
   Meanwhile, he presides over a troubled city.
   When Koch was elected to his third term in 1985, only a few
investigators were aware of city corruption scandals about to break
open. Crack was virtually unknown. The full devastation of the AIDS
epidemic was not yet generally apparent. There were fewer homeless
people. Crime rates had not hit the historic levels they're at now.
   The Democratic primary is about all those issues, said Rep.
Thomas Manton, Democratic leader of the borough of Queens and a new
Koch supporter. ``But more than anything, it's a question of the
incumbent and his record.''
   Whatever the primary's outcome, it will make history. Dinkins
would be the first black nominated by a major party for mayor in New
York; Koch would be the first mayor nominated for a fourth term.
   The Democratic nomination usually means election, because five
Democrats are registered for each Republican. But Rudolph W.
Giuliani, a popular former federal prosecutor, is front-runner for
the GOP nomination and could mount a serious challenge in the Nov. 7
general election.
   Attention for the moment was riveted on the Democratic race, a
contest of style as much as substance between the reserved,
unflappable Dinkins and the outspoken, occasionally outrageous Koch.
   But while he trailed badly in early polls, Koch appears to have
regained many of the voters who had left him for the now-faltering
candidacy of city Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin. Goldin and a
fourth candidate, former transit chief Richard Ravitch, trail badly,
as does Giuliani's only challenger in the Republican primary,
cosmetics company heir Ronald Lauder.
   ``Koch's campaign has been focused on his record. His TV ads are
about what Ed Koch has done,'' said Lee Miringoff, pollster at the
Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ``The net effect of
that seems to be to have driven down his negative rating somewhat.''
   Dinkins got help recently from Jesse Jackson, who received 45
percent of the New York City vote in last year's Democratic
presidential primary.
   Jackson came back ``to energize our support,'' said Lynch, but he
has not played a major role because of his negative appraisal by
many Jews, another important voting group.
   Jews may make up 25 percent of the Democratic vote; blacks, up to
a third. Koch himself is Jewish.
   The greatest energizer of the black vote may prove to be the Aug.
23 killing of a black youth, Yusuf Hawkins, by a white gang. Koch
drew sharp criticism by suggesting that protest marches after the
killing had exacerbated racial tensions.
   Even before the killing, Dinkins stressed harmony and
conciliation as his themes, and since then he has maintained a
soothing response. But some analysts have suggested that the
protests by militant blacks may give Koch a white backlash vote.
   Said Lynch: ``I can make an argument for it hurting, or helping.''
   Certain help for Dinkins will come from a major get-out-the-vote
effort on his behalf by most of the city's largest unions, including
teachers, municipal employees and Teamsters.
   Koch, with less union support and fewer volunteers of his own, is
unlikely to approach Dinkins' strength on the streets. Koch's aides
express concern on this point, and Dinkins' campaign manager called
it crucial.
   ``In a race that's neck and neck,'' Lynch said, ``turnout is
going to be the issue.''

   The retail price of a gallon of gasoline
dropped more than a penny in the past two weeks, but wholesale
prices are up, meaning an increase at the pump is possible this
fall, an industry analyst says.
   The nationwide average price for all grades at full- and
self-service pumps was $1.09.07 per gallon Aug. 25 to Sept. 9, a
drop of 1.37 cents, said Trilby Lundberg.
   Wholesale prices rose 0.33 cents as wholesalers' inventories,
stockpiled after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, returned closer to
normal, said Ms. Lundberg, director of the Lundberg Survey of 12,000
gasoline stations.
   Competition has dissuaded retailers from passing along the price
increase, but that could change, Ms. Lundberg said. ``It now appears
that gasoline retailers' operating margins are being squeezed and
that more of them may soon pass along the increases in the way of
higher street prices,'' she said.
   The average price of a gallon at the pump has dropped 9.33 cents
since it peaked May 19, Ms. Lundberg said.

<HEAD>Japan to Screen Economic Migrants From Vietnam</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will not grant refugee status to Vietnamese
and other Indochinese escaping to this country solely for better
economic prospects, officials said today.
   Beginning Wednesday, Japan will adopt a new screening process
based on an international agreement in Geneva in June, said Toshio
Tsunozaki, director of the Foreign Ministry's Human Rights and
Refugee Division,
   ``We are implementing the measures to exclude the pseudo-refugees
and distinguish genuine refugees,'' he said. ``We would like to
prevent abuse of very generous treatment by the Japanese side.''
   Many of the Vietnamese boat people who arrived recently in Japan
told officials they came to escape poverty, not because of
religious, political or racial persecution.
   Tsunozaki said those already granted refugee status would be
allowed to stay.
   Japan would not push arriving boats back out to sea, he added.
Those who are refused refugee status would be detained in
immigration centers until they can be repatriated, he said.
   More than 1.8 million Indochinese refugees have been settled in
some 30 countries, but more than 165,000 were still in camps in Asia
as of April.
   So far this year, 2,950 Vietnamese boat people have arrived in
Japan, compared with 219 in all of 1988.
   Justice Ministry officials have attributed the recent increase to
Japan's former refugee policy.
   Unlike the United States, as well as many Asian nations, Japan
has never distinguished between Indochinese fleeing political
persecution and those fleeing poverty.
   Tsunozaki said people from other nations fleeing political
persecution also could apply for refugee status, but would be
handled separately from Indochinese undergoing the screening process.
   The Geneva conference adopted a plan to screen all new arrivals
from Indochina to determine whether they should be granted refugee
status or repatriated. The conference also called for encouraging
voluntary returns.
   Meanwhile, 32 Chinese arrived by boat on Sept. 3 seeking refugee
status so that they could find jobs in Japan, Toshiki Eguchi, an
official of the Justice Ministry's refugee section, told The
Associated Press.
   ``None of them was a political refugee. They were illegal
aliens,'' Eguchi said.
   Chinese also have been found masquerading as Vietnamese refugees
on some of the boats that have arrived from Vietnam since May 29.
   So far, 639 Chinese, including the 32 who arrived Sept. 3, have
been detained in eight immigration centers waiting to be sent back
to China, Eguchi added.
   Some have said they fear punishment for fleeing if they are sent
back.
   Tsunozaki said, ``It's not discrimination toward the Chinese. We
don't want them to come to Japan by boat illegally.''
   Kyodo News Service reported that some of the 32 Chinese from
Fujian province had borrowed heavily to pay a broker in China to
arrange their trip to Japan.
   Quoting unnamed immigration officials, Kyodo said one of the 32
told of borrowing $4,865 at 36 percent interest to pay for the
passage.
   Also, each paid $1,215 to another Chinese broker for Japanese
immigration documents that turned out to be fake, Kyodo said.
   In the Geneva conference, Japan pledged to take 1,000 more
Indochinese refugees as permanent residents over the next three
years. So far, 6,222 Vietnamese have settled in Japan as permanent
residents.

   American students have little incentive to
achieve good grades as many are lured into low-paying jobs to earn
money for designer clothes touted by television advertisers, the
head of the nation's largest school administrator group said today.
   Scott Thomson, executive director of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, examined the learning conditions in
America and compared them with those in South Korea and West Germany.
   Concluding that ``American society doesn't measure up,'' Thomson
prepared a ``National Report Card'' in the October issue of the
association's journal that awarded South Korea an A-minus and West
Germany a B-plus. The United States received a C-plus.
   Thomson pointed to a 1988 North Carolina survey that found half
of the high school juniors were working, with 67 percent of these
students holding jobs 20 hours or more a week.
   In South Korea, he said students ``simply do not hold jobs while
attending school.'' In West Germany, students through all 13 years
of schooling are not employed in the job market except perhaps
informally in family businesses.
   ``Compared to their international counterparts, most American
students not only have fewer incentives to achieve good grades, they
also have more incentives to hold jobs during the school week,''
Thomson said in the article.
   ``A high demand for cheap labor and a premium on teen-age
consumption lure students into the job market,'' said Thomson, who
examined five broad categories that researchers say consistently
affect learning.
   As for television, Thomson said 71 percent of 13-year-old Korean
students consistently watch science programs, while only 37 percent
of Americans of similar age watch science programs, the lowest of
any group studied in an international assessment of math and science
schooling.
   Thomson said the market analysis firm, Teenage Research
Unlimited, found that television's focus on the teen-age consumer
market has now dropped from age 18 to 15 because the typical high
school junior has nearly $60 a week in spending money from jobs and
allowances.
   ``Brand loyalties are established at an early age, hence the hard
sell to youth. The American television industry tends to view
children and youth as consumers rather than as learners,'' he said.
   The pressure on students to consume may soon extend to the school
classroom as well, said Thomson. Whittle Communications, a
subsidiary of Time-Life Publishing Corp., is offering schools a
daily 10-minute news show with two minutes of advertising in return
for an offer of free television monitors.
   America received a D for prevalence of illegal drugs and Bs for
the percentage of Gross National Product devoted to public
education, place of schooling in family value structure and the
percentage of families below the poverty line.
   The only A for America was in the percentage of youth age 16 in
school.

   Syrian forces hammered Lebanon's
beleaguered Christian heartland with artillery, rockets and tank
fire early today, setting pine forests on fire and trapping
thousands of people in mountain towns.
   Police said 11 people were killed and 34 wounded in the shelling
duels in the central mountains that form the eastern flank of the
enclave and in clashes along Beirut's dividing Green Line.
   That raised the casualty toll to at least 844 killed and 2,508
wounded since March 8, when fighting erupted between Christian
leader Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and the Syrian army.
   Two Syrian gunboats intercepted a merchant ship carrying food
supplies to the enclave about 20 miles off the coast at mid-morning,
police reported.
   The gunboats escorted the unidentified ship to the
Syrian-controlled port of Tripoli in north Lebanon. But police said
they had no details of the ship's nationality.
   The Syrian navy has turned back several ships trying to run the
blockade of the Christian sector in recent weeks. Eight vessels have
been sunk or set on fire by Syrian artillery as they tried to run
the 6-month-old blockade.
   Police said the artillery battles that intensified Sunday night
after several days of sporadic clashes were the heaviest in the
mountains since the United Nations Security Council issued a vain
appeal for a cease-fire Aug. 16.
   The surge of violence that raged through the night came two days
before an Arab League mediation committee was due to meet in Saudi
Arabia to discuss reactivating a stalled peace initiative.
   Christian radio stations blamed the Syrians for the escalation,
claiming they were out to sabotage the three-nation committee's
efforts.
   ``We're back to the same old game,'' said an announcer on the
Voice of Free Lebanon radio. ``Whenever the committee schedules a
new meeting, the Syrians let all hell break loose while publicly
pledging cooperation to defuse the fighting.''
   The centers of the fighting during the night were Ein el-Tuffaha,
18 miles east of Beirut, and the Christian strongpoint of Souk
el-Gharb, 16 miles to the south.
   The two towns control road networks leading into the besieged
Christian heartland from the predominantly Shiite Moslem Bekaa
Valley and the Druse Moslem hinterland in the Chouf mountains.
   Syrian guns battered the Christian town of Bikfaya, hometown of
former President Amin Gemayel, for seven hours through the night,
setting surrounding pine forests on fire.
   A police spokesmen, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said Bikfaya's estimated 15,000 people were trapped in
basements throughout the battle because the fires blocked all escape
routes from town.
   Both sides battled with tanks around Souk el-Gharb, under siege
by Syria's Moslem allies since 1983.
   The Syrians and their militia allies have been increasingly
pressuring the Christian defenses along the 66-mile mountain front
over the last few weeks.
   But so far there has been no sign that they plan a major ground
offensive into the 310-square-mile enclave where an estimated 1
million Christians are trapped with their backs to the Mediterranean
Sea.
   Along the Green Line, Syrian and Christian troops clashed with
automatic weapons behind howtizer and mortar barrages that kept most
of Beirut's remaining 150,000 people in bomb shelters from dusk to
dawn.
   The rest of the battered city's 1.5 million people have fled over
the last six months, seeking refuge in north, east and south Lebanon.
   The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria, which
form the Arab League committee on Lebanon, were scheduled to meet
Wednesday in Jeddah on the Red Sea following weeks of high-level
diplomatic efforts by the Soviet Union and France.
   It will be the committee's first meeting since July 28, when it
said its efforts had been stymied by Syrian intransigence.
   Since then the Soviets and French have sought to persuade the
committee to try again.
   Aoun, who wants to mobilize international support for his ``war
of liberation'' against the Syrians, suffered a setback Sept. 6 when
the Americans withdrew their diplomats from Beirut to climax a
growing rift between the Christians and Washington.
   With Aoun and Syrian President Hafez Assad deeply entrenched,
there were no clear signs that a renewed Arab effort will succeed in
ending the carnage and finding a settlement of the 14-year-old
Lebanese civil war where previous attempts failed.
   The Syrians have refused to withdraw their 40,000 troops deployed
in mainly Moslem areas of Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate
to quell the civil war.

   At least 150 passengers were killed when
their Romanian pleasure boat collided with a Bulgarian tugboat on
the Danube River and sank, the Yugoslav state news agency reported
today from Bucharest.
   Romanian officials did not immediately confirm the Tanjug report,
which gave no sources.
   The accident occurred Sunday near the port city of Galati, about
125 miles northeast of Bucharest. The Romanian ship sank ``in
conditions of poor visibility,'' the official Romanian Agerpres news
agency reported Sunday.
   Agrepres said 18 of the ship's 169 passengers were rescued. The
Romanian report was unclear on whether the 13 crew were among those
saved.
   Tanjug said the cruise ship sank so fast that only 18 people
could be rescued. Tanjug also said the ship had only 10 crew members.
   The reports did not give the nationalities of the passengers. A
British newspaper reported that Western tourists were likely aboard
the Romanian ship, the Mogosoaia, when it sank.
   The Bulgarian state-run news agency BTA said the Mogosoaia
collided with the Bulgarian tug Peter Karaminchev, which was hauling
a convoy of loaded barges, then capsized and sank.
   ``After the alarm was sounded by the Bulgarian ship, its crew and
the crew of the ships in the proximity ran to help,'' BTA said.
   It said there were no reports of casualties aboard the tug.
   There was no report on what caused the boats to collide, but
Agerpres said the ship sank ``in conditions of poor visibility.''
   In London, The Independent newspaper said that apart from the 13
crew, most of the 169 passengers aboard the Mogosoaia ``were almost
certainly Western tourists.'' The newspaper report from Vienna
quoted Danube shipping officials in the Austrian capital.
   Pleasure cruises on the Danube are one of Romania's few sources
of hard currency, it said.
   Agerpres said rescue operations were continuing and a government
commission was established to investigate the accident.
   The Independent said blamed Agerpress for ``sparse details'' of
the sinking, which only began to emerge 10 hours afterward. It said
the Bulgarian BTA news agency ``was no more informative.''
   Tanjug said the accident received only scant attention in the
state-controlled Romanian media, with the government daily Romania
Libera today publishing a brief communique on its last page.
   In the Bulgarian capital of Sofia, an official at the U.S.
Embassy said: ``There's been almost nothing on this in the papers.''

   Labor turmoil in which
protesters burned trailers, hurled rocks and overturned cars has
some officials questioning the state's commitment to squelching
violence.
   Residents in this town of 6,500 tried Sunday to rebound from
Saturday's rampage by pro-union activists, who for weeks have been
incensed at a contractor's use of non-union labor on a $535 million
expansion of Boise Cascade Corp.'s paper mill.
   Damage was estimated at $1.3 million in the biggest disturbance
since an estimated 150 union workers at the mill went on a wildcat
strike in July. Five people were injured and 32 arrested, and
officials criticized Gov. Rudy Perpich for not calling out the
National Guard.
   Authorities planned more arrests after reviewing videotapes, and
Perpich said evidence would be sent to the U.S. attorney's office
for possible federal charges.
   ``Yesterday was a sad day for us in International Falls,'' the
Rev. Robert A. Kitchen, pastor of Faith United Church of Christ,
said Sunday. ``It was a day of desperation, of anger, of
hopelessness, perhaps.''
   Kitchen described the unrest as ``an open wound that we know has
ripped our community apart,'' and he prayed that the community pull
together and denounce the violence.
   About 370 non-union workers in five buses entered the
construction site under police escort early Sunday. Police reported
no problems.
   On Saturday, about 45 police officers used tear gas to disperse
about 400 protesters, dozens of whom stormed housing trailers that
had been evacuated the night before.
   Law enforcement officials requested the National Guard. The
governor put troops on alert but decided not to deploy them after
calm was restored.
   Perpich acknowledged Sunday that intelligence reports a few days
earlier indicated potential trouble over the weekend. But Perpich
said the state could not send in the Guard simply in anticipation of
trouble.
   ``The only place where there is complete safety is in East
Europe, because the army's there all the time. That way you have
perfect control,'' Perpich said in St. Paul. ``This is a free
society. ... And you do not use the National Guard for law
enforcement. It's a military organization.''
   Union officials have not sanctioned the strike and say they have
tried to dissuade protesters from violence or mass demonstrations.
   Bill Peterson, head of the Minnesota Building Trades Council,
said Sunday that his union group planned a rally for next weekend in
the capital, St. Paul.
   ``We think any rally at International Falls ought not be held
because we were sure that, tensions running as high as they were,
there could be some problems,'' he said.
   Boise spokesman Andrew Drysdale said the Guard should have been
called out because violence could erupt again. ``I think it's highly
likely this won't be the last thing they'll pull,'' he said.
   And Sheriff William Elliott said he's unsure local law
enforcement agencies have the manpower to quell future disturbances.
   ``The problem we have in northern Minnesota is we're so far away
from help,'' he said. ``We need an early response and the law
enforcement agencies are so spread apart we may have difficulty
getting that.''
   Mark Shields, superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension, said eight agents were sent to International Falls a
few days ago based on reports of potential violence.
   ``We were present,'' Perpich said. ``And it's because of our
presence that those people who were responsible are all going to be
brought to justice.''

<HEAD>Game Officials Alarmed at Killings of Ugly Ducklings</HEAD>

   The homely Muscovy duck has exposed a
cruel streak among Floridians.
   Muscovies in recent weeks have been beaten to death, shot with
steel-tipped darts, and, in one instance, kicked and hacked to
pieces in front of a group of children.
   ``Something needs to be done uniformly to stop the mutilation,''
said Cindy Mosling, who heads the Bird Emergency Aid &amp; Kare
Sanctuary, or BEAKS.
   Normally found around the ponds of parks and apartment complexes,
the heavyset Muscovies are best known for waddling after children,
eating huge amounts, hissing like snakes and breeding like rabbits.
They grow up to 15 inches high and have dark feathers with white
splotches and red wattling above their beaks.
   The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission is drafting a
policy on how the state should deal with the Muscovies as well as
other ``nuisance fowl,'' which include urban mallards.
   Officials say they suspect property owners are killing the ducks
because of their droppings. There are ``records and records and
records'' of violence against the ducks, said Ms. Mosling.
   ``We as a society wouldn't condone it if dogs and cats were
mutiliated on the streets,'' she said. ``For some reason, people can
justify cruelty if it's a homely victim.''
   Muscovies, which can fly short distances, are native to Latin
America. Twenty to 25 years ago, they were brought to Florida as an
ornamental species to liven up the ponds and lagoons around
residental communities, said Rich Turnbull, a state waterfowl
biologist.
   Because they are not native to Florida, the Muscovies are not
protected by state wildlife laws. But they are protected under laws
against cruelty to animals.

<HEAD>Congressman Will Try to Amend Capital-Gains Tax Cut Measure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Ways and Means Committee member said
today he will attempt to amend a capital-gains tax cut that the
panel is expected to approve this week so none of the benefit would
go to people with incomes over $200,000 a year.
   ``If we are going to offer a capital-gains exclusion, we should
offer it to those wno need it,'' Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., told
a news conference. ``Those who have incomes in the millions can well
afford the modest top tax rates under today's tax system.''
   Dorgan's limited capital-gains reduction would be financed by
raising from 28 percent to 33 percent the maximum tax rate that
applies to all types of income earned by wealthier taxpayers.
   The Ways and Means Committee will resume consideration Tuesday of
a plan, endorsed by President Bush, that would allow investors to
avoid tax on 30 percent of capital gains, which are profits from the
sale of stock and other assets. Congressional staff experts estimate
that 80 percent of the benefit of such a reduction would go to those
with annual incomes above $100,000.
   That proposal, sponsored chiefly by Reps. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., and
Bill Archer, R-Texas, apparently has the support of a bare majority
of the Ways and Means Committee.
   Dorgan said he would prefer no change in taxation of capital
gains, which now are taxed at the same rates as other income. He is
offering the alternative, he said, only because it appears the
committee will approve a capital-gains cut.
   Under Dorgan's proposal:
   _Thirty percent of capital gains would be excluded from taxation
for couples with total income of $100,000 or less.
   _The portion of the gain that would be excluded from taxation
would decline gradually as income rises between $100,000 and
$200,000. At $150,000 income, the exclusion would be 15 percent.
   _No exclusion would be allowed once total income exceeds $200,000
a year.
   _A quirk in the 1986 tax law that has some people paying a lower
rate as income rises would be eliminated. For example, a couple with
two children and taxable income of $300,000 now paying a 28 percent
rate on all above $201,500 would have to pay 33 percent on all above
that level.
   That rate change would affect only the wealthiest 1 percent of
taxpayers, Dorgan said.

   Attackers today shot and killed a former
mayor of Medellin, the heart of the nation's cocaine industry and
focus of most of the violence in the country's narcotics war, police
said.
   At least two attackers dressed in black shot Pablo Pelaez
Gonzalez as he was being driven to his office, where he operated a
local plywood company, the Medellin police said by telephone.
   Pelaez' driver was killed also, said a police spokeswoman who
declined to be identified.
   Radio stations reporting from the scene of the shooting said the
killers, apparently on foot, fired 9mm automatic pistols at the
ex-mayor's BMW sedan, shed their black outer garments and fled.
   Pelaez, 45, was mayor of the city of 2 million, Colombia's second
largest, until 1986.
   No group immediately asserted responsibility for the killing. It
is the latest in a string of daily bombings and shootings in
Medellin, where wealthy drug lords have focused efforts to terrorize
Colombians following an unprecendented government crackdown on
traffickers announced Aug. 18.
   The most-wanted cocaine chieftains remain at large and it doesn't
appear the government knows where they are despite a $250,000 reward
offered for information on their whereabouts. Colombia on Sunday
signed extradition papers for three alleged traffickers.
   The crackdown has been supported by President Bush and is the
focus of a U.N. meeting that opened today in Vienna on the issue.
   ``If Colombia were to lose this war (against the traffickers), we
should all be lost,'' Margaret J. Anstee, director general of the
U.N. Office in Vienna, told top government and law enforcement
officials from 100 countries.
   During the weekend, the army kept on confiscating the lavish
properties the fugitive cocaine traffickers left behind.
   At least five properties were seized, along with Olympic-sized
swimming pools, 600 head of cattle, 200 exotic tropical birds, 80
fighting cocks, show horses, trucks and an idyllic estate on a
so-called ``Fantasy Island'' on the Magdalena River running through
Colombia's midwest.
   The properties are said to belong to the top two and most wanted
drug lords, Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. They are
worth billions and the seizures are not believed to have drastically
diminished the reputed drug barons' wealth.
   For the first time since the drug sweep began, eight A-37 jets
donated last week by the United States were used in reconnaisance
flights over the properties, Colombian television reported.
   ``We are going to keep the seizures up,'' said an officer with
the 4th Army Brigade, one of the units carrying out the anti-drug
operations. He asked not to be identified for security reasons.
   He said 49 properties, including ranches, mansions, and estates,
have been confiscated and 26 people arrested in the past two weeks.
   The three alleged traffickers who Colombia says are wanted in the
United States are not believed to be high-ranking but are said to be
active in the Medellin cartel, supplier of most of the cocaine sold
on U.S. streets.
   An official of the government's Drug Council, created to deal
with narcotics trafficking, said authorities signed the extradition
order on the three _ two men and a woman _ who are accused by the
United States of cocaine trafficking and money laundering.
   The official, who asked not to be identified because the
government has not made the extradition order public, identified the
three as: Ana Helena Rodriguez, 37; Bernardo Londono Quintana, 47,
and Alberto Orlandez Gamboa, 37.
   The first reputed high-ranking Colombian drug figure to be
extradited to the United States in more than 2 years, Eduardo
Martinez Romero, was flown to Atlanta on Wednesday to stand trial on
charges of laundering millions of cocaine dollars for the Medellin
cartel.
   The three awaiting extradition have five days to appeal the
order. Martinez appealed and lost.
   The drug cartels have vowed to kill judges and businessmen if the
government keeps up its crackdown, which began on Aug. 18 after
drug-backed assassins killed Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading
presidential candidate and an anti-drug crusader.
   But the Barco government has defied the threats and enlisted the
support of the United States, the largest drug consumer.
   The Bush administration is giving Colombia's narcotics forces $65
million worth of military equipment, which includes planes,
helicopters, jeeps and weapons, for the campaign.
   But in the three weeks of fighting, neither the government nor
traffickers appear to be making much headway and cocaine-linked
violence.
   On Sunday, assailants killed the foreman of a ranch belonging to
Carlos Ossa Escobar, the head of the Agrarian Reform Institute, and
set the property ablaze. Ossa Escobar advocates giving seized drug
traffickers' property to landless peasants.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Bar has opened preliminary
disciplinary proceedings against Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who
recently admitted paying a male prostitute for sex, the Washington
Times reports.
   The proceedings were triggered when George Washington University
professor John F. Banzhaf III last week filed a complaint with the
state's Board of Overseers.
   Assistant Board Counsel Terence Troyar told The Times in an
interview from Boston on Friday, ``The board's proceedings are
confidential, and I can neither confirm or deny that proceedings are
under way against any individual.''
   But Troyar confirmed that such proceedings are automatic once a
complaint has been filed. Frank has 20 days to respond in writing,
and Banzhaf may then submit a counter-response.
   A bar inquiry could produce sanctions as serious as disbarment.
Frank has never practiced law and is listed as an inactive lawyer by
the board.
   Such inquiries are normally kept confidential, but Banzhaf has
asked Frank to agree to open them.
   ``He says the matter should be cleared up,'' Banzhaf said.
``Certainly, the public wants to know, and the best way is through a
relatively neutral forum (the Board of Overseers), which has the
expertise to resolve these kinds of issues.
   Frank, who is gay, admitted last month that he paid prostitute
Stephen Gobie for sexual services, then hired the man to be his
personal aide. Frank said he knew Gobie was continuing to work as a
prostitute, but denied knowledge that Gobie was running a
prostitution service from the congressman's basement apartment on
Capitol Hill. He said he fired Gobie in 1987 when he found out.
   Frank also said he wrote several letters to Gobie's probation
officer seeking to suspend the prostitute's probationary period, and
that he used his congressional immunity to void Gobie's traffic
tickets.
   Frank himself has called for an investigation into the matter by
the House ethics committee, saying he wants to clear the public
record.

   The body of a Palestinian man was found today in
a West Bank village raided by the army, raising to seven the number
of Arabs killed by Israeli security the previous day.
   It was one of the bloodiest days of the 21-month Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and West
Bank.
   In southern Lebanon, Israeli troops today killed two guerrillas
in a clash, the second gun battle there in three days, Lebanese
security sources reported.
   They said two Israeli soldiers were wounded in the firefight near
the village of Kfar Kila in Israel's self-designated ``security
zone.''
   An Israeli army spokeswoman in Jerusalem confirmed the clash but
said only three soldiers were wounded and one guerrilla was captured.
   The Lebanese National Resistance Front, a loose coalition of
pro-Syrian leftist and Palestinian guerrillas, claimed
responsibility for the shootout in a statement that gave no other
details.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, meanwhile, said he thought a
proposal by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak could be the basis for
opening talks with Israel on Middle East peace. Peres is head of the
left-leaning Labor Party.
   His stand will likely heighten debate in Israel on Mubarak's plan
since Labor's coalition partner in the government, the right-wing
Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, is opposed to the
Egyptian proposal.
   The victim of the army raid in the West Bank, identified as
Zuhair Abdul Halim, 28, was found dead under a tree in the village
of Kafr Quddum with gunshot wounds in the neck and stomach, Arab
reporters said.
   Residents of Kafr Quddum said Abdul Halim apparently was killed
in yesterday's clash in which another villager also died and six
were wounded.
   Villagers said Kafr Quddum was raided by about 10 men in civilian
cloths, but the army issued a statement saying an army patrol opened
fire in the village when it was attacked by Palestinians youths
during an arrest raid.
   The army spokesman's office said it was checking the report of a
second death.
   Abdul Halim's death was the seventh reported in scattered clashes
Sunday. It was the highest one-day toll since May 19, when eight
Palestinians were shot and killed in a series of clashes with
soldiers.
   The heaviest day of casualties in the uprising occurred on April
16, 1988, when 18 Palestinians were shot and killed in riots that
followed the assassination in Tunis of PLO military commander Khalil
Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad.
   Abdul Halim's death raised to 567 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israelis in the uprising. Forty Israelis also have died in
the violence.
   In other violence, the body of a Palestinian suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities was found in an orange grove
in the Gaza Strip.
   The death raised to 113 the number of Palestinians slain by
fellow Arabs during the uprising as accused collaborators,
prostitutes or drug dealers.
   Arab hospital officials said five Palestinians were wounded in
clashes with Israeli troops today, including a 17-year-old youth
from the West Bank village of Tamoun in critical condition with a
bullet in the back.
   The latest discussion on the stalled Middle East peace process
concerns Mubarak's proposal designed to get Palestinian backing for
Israel's call for elections in the occupied territories.
   His 10-point peace plan includes Israeli acceptance of the
U.S.-backed concept of trading land for peace and allowing the
140,000 Arabs of east Jerusalem to vote in the elections Israel is
proposing to choose Palestinian negotiators.
   A Lebanese security source said today's 90-minute border clash
broke out after the guerrillas had infiltrated the Israeli-occupied
area one mile west of the Israeli border, ``possibly with the
intention of attacking an Israeli post there when they were
spotted.''
   The source, who requested anonymity, said about 120 Israeli
soldiers backed by 20 armored personnel carriers and tanks and two
helicopters later carried out a search operation around Kfar Kila
for more guerrillas.
   Israel carved out the six- to 10-mile-deep border zone when it
withdrew the bulk of its army in 1985 after a three-year occupation
of south Lebanon.
   The zone, patrolled by Israeli troops and militia allies, serves
as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israeli
settlements.

<TEXT>
   Typhoon Sarah blasted through eastern
Taiwan today, triggering landslides and leaving four people dead and
two missing after it killed at least 16 in the Philippines,
authorities said.
   Weather forecasters said the storm's winds intensified to 108 mph
after it battered the Philippines, where in addition to the dead
more than 1,000 families were left homeless.
   Police said the dead in Taiwan included an Australian, Jonathan
B. Watts, who was swept into Hualien harbor, 112 miles southeast of
Taipei. Two Americans and one Canadian also were swept into the
harbor but were rescued and taken to a hospital, police said.
   Police said said two Taiwanese men were swept out to sea and a
woman died of electrical shock in east Taiwan. The body of one of
the men was not found and he was listed as missing.
   Earlier, police said an elderly woman drowned in a fishing port
in Suao, 30 miles south of Taipei, and a university student was
swept out to sea at a scenic formation in Taitung, 120 miles
southeast of Taipei.
   Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau warned of floods at major river
banks and coastal areas later today, when Sarah was expected to
sweep across the island.
   Taipei's domestic Sungshan Arport was closed and most train
services were halted in expectation of strong wind and rain,
officials said.
   In Manila, the Office of Civil Defense said the storm spawned a
tornado in Zambales province on Sunday. The tornado injured three
people and destroyed $90,000 worth of crops and property, officials
said.
   By late afternoon today, the storm was centered about 168 miles
north-northeast of Batanes, the Philippines' northernmost province,
and was moving northward at 9 mph.
   Although the storm skirted the Philippines, weather officials
said it triggered widespread squalls and storms that lashed northern
provinces of the main island Luzon with strong winds and heavy rains.
   About 44 villages suffered floods and landslides which affected
more than 6,000 families, Red Cross officials said. About 130 houses
were destroyed, the Office of Civil Defense said.
   At least nine people were killed in Ilocos Sur province and seven
were missing after floodwaters swept away their homes, officials
said. Another person drowned in neighboring Kalinga-Apayao province,
they added.
   Five people were killed in landslides in Benguet province and one
person was electrocuted when winds blew down a power line in La
Union province.

   The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, whose clock has
ticked a few minutes before nuclear midnight for 42 years, says it
will begin taking environmental dangers, poverty and other threats
into account in moving the hands.
   During the Cold War and detente, the clock represented the
world's proximity to nuclear annihilation. With the easing of
U.S.-Soviet tensions, the clock will also reflect other dangers to
survival, said editor Len Ackland.
   ``It's a recognition that international security has to be
thought about in more than simple military terms,'' Ackland said.
``It doesn't mean in any way that military security is less
important.''
   The ``clock'' isn't a real timepiece; it is a logo of a clock
face printed in the bulletin. Beginning this week with the October
issue, the ``Doomsday clock'' logo will soon consist of the clock
face superimposed on a globe.
   The clock, which first appeared in 1947, has represented an
estimate by the editors and an international board of scientists of
the world's proximity to the nuclear destruction. The hands have
been reset 12 times.
   The closest it ever got to midnight, 11:57, was in 1951, after
the Soviets exploded an atom bomb, and again in 1983, when
U.S.-Soviet arms talks were suspended.
   The clock has remained at 11:54 since January 1988, when the
United States and Soviet Union signed a treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   ``In the past year and a half, we have certainly seen progress in
improving the U.S.-Soviet Union arms control negotiations,'' Ackland
said in a telephone interview from his suburban Oak Park home.
``Once tensions dropped down, it enabled us to take a look around
and recognize there are many other dangers that threaten our
survival, and environmental concerns are probably the most
conspicuous.''
   ``We felt this was a very important time to redefine what
national security is,'' Ackland said Sunday.
   ``We need to also recognize there are a lot of connections with
environmental issues, economic depression and poverty around the
world because those are the kinds of things that could escalate
quickly.''
   John Peoples, director of the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory near Chicago, said the change in focus is necessary and
important, if not tardy.
   ``Irrespective of whether the Cold War is dissolving, one has to
pay attention to the environment,'' he said. ``Certainly things like
Chernobyl ... and Bhopal, they have to have equal priority.''
   In 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union
exploded, spewing radiation that killed at least 32 people and
eventually swirled around the globe. A gas leak from a Union Carbide
pesticide plant killed more than 3,400 people in Bhopal, India, in
1984.
   The journal began as a newsletter among scientists of the
Manhattan Project _ the top-secret U.S. effort during World War II
to develop the atomic bomb before the Axis powers.
   The first six-page Bulletin was published in 1945. Today's
journal, about 50 pages long, is published 10 times a year. Though
paid subscribers are relatively few _ about 20,000 in 70 countries _
they have included members of of lawmaking bodies around the world.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen believed to be radicals of the
Sinhalese majority killed the security chief at a university Monday
and then stormed the vice chancellor's office and shot him to death,
military officials said.
   Police said they believed the attackers, who escaped on a
motorcycle, belonged to the People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese
extremist group trying to overthrow the government.
   Military officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules
said two men entered the office of Chandraratne Patuwathavitane at
Moratuwa university in southern Sri Lanka and opened fire.
Patuwathavitane, a 60-year-old engineering professor, was hit in the
head and killed, they said.
   The gunmen shot the university's security chief at the campus
entrance before entering the vice chancellor's office, the officials
said.
   A total of 55 people were reported killed since Sunday in ethnic
violence on this Indian Ocean island.
   The victims included nine members of a former Tamil rebel group,
the Eelam People's Liberation Front, who died Monday in an ambush by
a rival rebel group, military officials said.
   The attackers were believed to be members of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which is fighting for a separate nation for
the Tamil minority.
   Also reported killed were five Indian peacekeeping soldiers and
three Sinhalese militants shot by security forces, a government
statement said. It did not release details.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa has called a meeting Wednesday
aimed at resolving the ethnic problems, which have claimed more than
16,000 lives in the past six years.
   Premadasa sent invitations to all 23 recognized political
parties, but three opposition parties _ the Trotskyte Lanka Peoples'
Party, the Communist Party and the New Peoples' Party _ said they
will boycott the meeting.
   The two main Tamil guerrilla groups, the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam and the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam,
plan to attend.
   ``The decision to participate in the all-party conference is
prompted by our desire to cooperate with the government of Sri Lanka
in its genuine efforts to find solutions to the complex problems
that beset the island,'' said a statement released by the Tigers,
who held separate peace talks with the government earlier this year.
   The Tigers, who are demanding an independent homeland in the
north and east for the Tamil minority, have been fighting Indian
soldiers sent to the island two years ago to enforce an accord aimed
at ending the Tamil war.
   The accord offered the Tamils limited autonomy if they would
surrender their weapons. The Tigers rejected the accord, saying it
did not meet their expections.
   Sinhalese militants said the accord granted too many concessions
to the Tamils and began fighting the Sinhalese-led government.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people and
claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who
comprise 75 percent of the population and dominate the government
and military.

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Moslem students opposed
to pop music clashed with police outside a concert, and at least 22
were arrested, officials said Monday.
   Police Superintendent Salleh Gomu told reporters the 22 students
were released on $185 bail each and could be charged with taking
part in an illegal demonstration.
   The placard-carrying students demonstrated Sunday night outside
the University of Malaya's main hall, where popular singer Sheila
Majid was performing. They told reporters the pop and other songs
she was singing were un-Islamic and that only holy songs or cultural
songs should be allowed.
   When the students refused orders to disperse, about 25 police
charged them with batons. Some cars were damaged as students
scrambled over them while fleeing, but no injuries were reported.
   The students were mainly from the Islamic Undergraduates
Association.
   The school's deputy vice chancellor, Abdul Rashid Ahmad, said the
students had sent a memorandum demanding cancellation of the
concert, held to raise funds for the university's cultural fund.
   Despite the protests, he said, more pop concerts would be held.
   He said all shows are screened by university authorities. ``We
just don't allow heavy metal and such groups, as they are a bad
influence,'' he added.

   Prime Minister Geoffery Palmer of New
Zealand said relations between the United States and New Zealand
have deteriorated because of New Zealand's non-nuclear policy, a
newspaper said Monday.
   The newspaper, Ilta-Sanomat, quoted Palmer as saying U.S. leaders
had ``systematically'' refused to engage in normal talks with New
Zealand.
   ``This is rather strange treatment toward a nation which in the
American view is, after all, friendly and democratic,'' Palmer said.
   Palmer said political relations between the United States and New
Zealand had cooled since a decision in 1984 by then-Prime Minister
David Lange's government to only allow maritime visits by vessels
that verifiably carry no nuclear arms.
   Palmer, who was Lange's right-hand man in the previous Cabinet,
was elected prime minister a month ago after Lange resigned.

   A major key to good health is good lifestyles
passed from parent to child, a top federal health official said
today.
   ``I urge you to return to your communities with the message that
a major component of the family's legacy ought to be the example of
lifestyle and personal behavior that, in today's world, can be the
keys to good health,'' said Dr. James O. Mason.
   ``How ... can a father who smokes teach his children to avoid
cigarettes, or a mother who abuses alcohol teach her children not to
drink?'' he asked.
   Mason, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health
and Human Services, spoke at the opening session of the first
National Conference on Access and Health Care Financing Alternatives
for Minority Populations.
   The HHS Secretary, Dr. Louis Sullivan, was outlining
administration initiatiaves on minority health later at a hearing of
Sen. Edward Kennedy's health committee after joining the
Massachusetts Democrat at a news conference.
   Sullivan also was addressing the minority health conference on
its closing day Wednesday.
   Mason recited an array of statistics showing minorities in
general have poorer health and less access to care than whites.
   One thing that would help for all groups, he said, is strong
family involvement.
   ``Physical and mental well-being, education, perspective and a
sense of self all begin in and are nurtured by the family,'' he
said. ``In the family are the first examples of how we should
conduct ourselves.''

   Five Americans accused of helping the
Medellin cartel smuggle cocaine into the United States went on trial
today, while the big names _ the ring's reputed Colombian
masterminds _ remained at large.
   The trial has been dubbed the ``Son of Lehder'' case because it
is a spinoff of the smuggling trial last year of Carlos Lehder
Rivas, a Colombian boss of the cartel.
   Among those indicted but missing from the trial were reputed
cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria, Jose Gonzalo Rodriquez Gacha,
Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez. They are on the U.S.
list of most-wanted drug barons.
   Others indicted but not here to face charges are U.S. financier
Robert Vesco, who lives in Cuba, and Everette Bannister, an
associate of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling.
   Jury selection began with U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II
questioning the first of 65 prospective jurors about how much they
knew about the Lehder case.
   In that trial, which lasted 7{ months before Lehder was
convicted, witnesses implicated others in a conspiracy that the
government said began in 1974 and continued until this year.
   Lehder, 40, believed to have been one of the leaders and
architects of the Medellin cartel, was convicted of operating a
continuing criminal enterprise and was sentenced to life in prison
without parole. He is in isolation at the federal prison in Marion,
Ill.
   The five defendants on trial here are accused of helping the
cartel in one way or another over the past 15 years.
   Lehder was convicted of operating a cocaine-smuggling operation
that used the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay as an ``aircraft
carrier'' to fly 20 tons of cocaine into the United States from
Colombia from 1978 to 1981.
   The indictment charges that in October 1984, Lehder sent a
messenger from Nicaragua to Cuba asking Vesco to use his influence
in Cuba to arrange for Lehder's aircraft to fly over Cuba on
smuggling runs from Nicaragua to Andros Island in the Bahamas.
   A few days later, Vesco supplied Lehder's messenger with a
document approving the cocaine overflights.
   Vesco, who was indicted on one count alleging he conspired to
import cocaine, is believed to have lived in Cuba since 1982. He has
been wanted in the United States since 1973 on charges of looting an
investment firm of $224 million.
   Also at large was Bannister, a Nassau resident accused of taking
money from the cartel to allow the Bahamas to be used as a way
station for drug imports.
   Facing trial today are Jack Carlton Reed, 58, who was convicted
with Lehder on one conspiracy count and sentenced to 15 years in
prison; Thomas Howard Herington, 35, of Mill Valley, Calif.;
attorney Barry Kane, 52, of Hyannis, Mass., and Fort Lauderdale;
Donald Kenneth Lady, 41, of Pomona, Calif.; and Samuel Thomas
Stewart, 53, of Anaheim, Calif.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to prison terms of 10 years
to life.
   Lehder's former wife, Yemel Nacel, 34, of New York City, and nine
others have pleaded guilty to conspiracy and are among the 98 people
on the government's witness list.
   Prosecutors expected the trial to last two months.
   The Medellin cartel is described as the world's largest illegal
cocaine operation. It is believed to supply 80 percent of the
cocaine sold in the United States.
   In Atlanta today, Eduardo Martinez Romero, the Colombian who
federal officials say helped the cartel launder $1.2 billion in drug
profits, pleaded innocent to fraud and money-laundering charges in
federal court.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of ecstatic East German
refugees poured into West Germany today after Hungary defied a
Warsaw Pact ally and boldly threw open a door to the West.
   ``You made it!'' yelled one young emigre, hitting the hood of his
Wartburg minibus after arriving in the largest mass migration from
East Germany since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961.
   East Germany angrily denounced the exodus and accused Hungary of
``smuggling'' human beings.
   Hungary opened its border to the West at midnight to the East
Germans. The decision came despite Hungary's concerns that the
nation could become a conduit for tens of thousands of other
refugees from Soviet bloc nations.
   In Yugoslavia, meanwhile, about 100 Romanians who have fled from
their Communist country gathered today at a U.N. office in Belgrade,
applying to be resettled in the West.
   Bavarian border police said more than 2,000 East German refugees
_ mostly young couples or families with young children _ had arrived
from Hungary through Austria by midmorning, with hundreds more
streaming in later in the day. The total reportedly could top 10,000.
   Austrian border officials said more than 5,700 refugees had
crossed the border into Austria by midafternoon. In Budapest,
officials of the West German charity running the refugee camps said
the last bus carrying the remnants of the about 7,000 registered at
the Hungarian camps left this afternoon.
   West Germany's ZDF television network said the total number
expected to reach the West in the current exodus could be ``well
over 10,000.''
   A 40-year-old Leipzig man, who would not give his name, said: ``I
decided on escaping 27 years ago, and today it worked. It's a
feeling that's just tops, just wild.''
   The emigration came despite efforts by die-hard Communists in
East Berlin to dissuade Hungary's reform-minded leaders.
   As it took place, a West German newspaper and television network
today reported the condition of East German leader Erich Honecker,
who underwent gall bladder surgery last month, has deteriorated
badly. Government officials in Bonn declined comment.
   Hungarian radio compared the East Germans' noisy departure by
car, bus and train to a New Year's Eve celebration ``with horns
blaring and people shouting.''
   Thousands of East Germans had flooded into Hungary on tourist
visas after it tore down its border fence with Austria in May.
   East Germany accused Hungary of interfering in its internal
affairs by allowing the mass flight and becoming the first East bloc
government to help citizens of an ally freely leave their homeland.
   The state-run news agency ADN said Hungary, under the guise of
humanitarianism, ``has engaged in the organized smuggling of human
beings.''
   There have been news reports that the East German government was
planning to curb travel to Hungary, but the East Berlin leadership
has denied it intends to impose such restrictions.
   But while Hungary risked worsened relations with an East bloc
ally, it could develop closer and potentially lucrative ties with
Common Market member West Germany.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whose
country offers East Germans automatic citizenship and help getting
settled, hailed Hungary's move as representative of ``its humane
policies.''
   An estimated 60,000 East Germans were in Hungary on Sunday and
the Hungarian foreign minister, Gyula Horn, suggested that many more
than the 6,500 formally registered as wanting to leave might cross
into Austria.
   Even as the first convoys of refugees made their way into
Austria, new East German arrivals were reported at several refugee
camps in Hungary.
   In Bavaria, the refugees lined up to register with charities and
border authorities. As parents stretched, filled out forms or cupped
hands around containers of coffee handed out by volunteers, children
lined up in the morning mist for teddy bears, picture books and
other donated playthings.
   West German Red Cross workers had braced for the onslaught by
hastily erecting tent communities in several Bavarian towns last
month. But most of those arriving early today opted to drive on to
relatives in cities as far away as Hamburg.
   For many of the thousands who began crossing into Austria shortly
after midnight, leaving Hungary was occasion for tumultuous
celebration.
   Lines of cars, horns honking, formed on the Hungarian side, with
some passengers waving champagne bottles out of car windows. On
arrival in Nickelsdorf, an Austrian border town, dozens jumped from
their cars to dance in the street, cheered on by a growing crowd of
Austrians.
   While the crossing into West Germany was more subdued for most,
some of the East Germans again were overtaken by emotion.
   A man from Thueringen, accompanied by his wife and their
3-year-old son, told reporters of the joy he and his countrymen
experienced when told Sunday night that they could leave for the
West.
   ``My wife and I bawled, and the little one laughed,'' he said,
chuckling.
   ``This is great!'' shouted Udo, a 26-year old from Dresden, one
of a group of four East Germans in their 20s who shared a car for
the freedom convoy.
   ``We applied to leave three years ago, and we got rejected a
month ago,'' he said, explaining his decision to flee through
Hungary.
   For those without cars, the Austrian Federal Railways had readied
90 rail cars capable of carrying 8,000 people, West German rail
officials said.
   West Germany moved an additional 40 railway cars to several
border points, while Austrian transport officials had more than 50
buses ready.
   The fate of the refugees had been discussed for weeks by East and
West Germany, but Hungary said without elaboration that the talks
had failed.
   ``The Hungarian government has chosen to illegally allow East
German citizens to travel to West Germany in violation of
international treaty,'' ADN charged Sunday night.
   Hungary decided to suspend a 1969 agreement with East Germany
that says Hungary should not take into account West Germany's claim
to East Germans, said Horn.
   Horn said Hungary decided to act unilaterally after East Germany
rejected its calls to treat emigration applications by those
returning home favorably.
   About 6,000 East Germans had already fled to the West this summer
through Hungary, which with Poland is gradually liberalizing while
neighbor East bloc governments resist the more freer climate under
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, clinging to authoritarian ways.
   Several hundred East Germans, seeking safe passage to the West,
are now holed up in West Germany's embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.

<DATELINE>MARSEILLE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's most celebrated matador
regained consciousness Monday but remained paralyzed after being
thrown by a 1,210-pound bull.
   Christian Montcouquiol, 35, struck his head Sunday when the bull,
his second of the day at a tournament in the nearby town of Arles,
lifted him on its horns and flipped him over.
   The bull quickly turned and butted the motionless Montcouquiol
before rescuers could distract it. The matador was not gored.
   Montcouquiol suffered four broken or dislocated vertebrae that
paralyzed his arms, legs and respiratory system, said neurological
specialists at La Timone hospital in Marseilles.
   Initially in a coma, Montcouquiol underwent neck surgery Sunday
night. He was conscious Monday but remained on artificial breathing
support in guarded condition, doctors said.
   Montcouquiol, who goes by the ring name Nimeno II, killed his
first bull at the age of 15 and has been a full-fledged matador
since 1977.
   He is a star in arenas throughout southern France, where the
sport is popular, and was one of the first French matadors of his
generation to appear in bull-fighting tournaments in Latin America
and Spain.
   Montcouquiol has killed more than 800 bulls and is considered by
afficionados a technical master who employs an especially dramatic
pose with the banderillas, short spears used by matadors to taunt
bulls.

   Jim Bakker once bought a 12-carat, $22,000
raw diamond to provide for his retirement and took out insurance on
a series of ever-larger boats, witnesses said at the evangelist's
trial today.
   Ernest Perry, owner of Perry Jewelry Emporium in Charlotte, said
Bakker told him that the 12-carat stone, as well as an eight-carat
diamond Bakker purchased, would be ``a good investment for his
retirement.''
   Another witness, Carolyn Smith, of the Jerry Tuttle Insurance
agency in Charlotte, testified the Bakkers' homeowners policy valued
their personal property at $134,000 for the period June 1, 1986,
through June 1, 1987.
   The policy covered such things as a $45,000 diamond ring, a
$27,000 diamond ring and a $29,000 diamond bracelet, and the premium
was paid by PTL, she said.
   Ms. Smith said Jim and Tammy Bakker also insured successively
larger boats: in 1978, an 18-footer valued at $8,600, in 1984, a
19-footer valued at $10,000, and in 1986, a 22-footer valued at
$29,000.
   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and
faces 120 years and prison and more than $5 million in fines if
convicted. Prosecutors say he used nearly $4 million in ministry
funds to finance a lavish lifestyle.
   Mrs. Bakker, in an interview broadcast on the ``Donahue'' show
this morning, denied the couple did anything wrong. She has not been
charged in the case.
   ``We know inside we are not guilty,'' she said in an interview
with Phil Donahue taped in Charlotte on Friday and broadcast today.
``If I was guilty, I'd hide my head, but when you're not guilty
you're not guilty.''
   The growing evangelical empire, which included the Heritage USA
theme park near here as well as their nationally televised religious
program, ``got to where it didn't even feel a part of us,'' Mrs.
Bakker said. ``We almost couldn't catch up with it. ... I felt like
a little girl who didn't know where she was supposed to be.''
   A former top executive at the TV ministry was scheduled to
testify this week against Bakker. Until Richard Dortch pleaded
guilty Aug. 8, prosecutors were planning to try him with Bakker.
Dortch was sentenced to eight years in prison.
   In cross-examining other witnesses, Bakker's attorney, Harold
Bender, has sought to create an impression that Dortch directed some
of PTL's most excessive spending.
   Dortch, who was released from a Florida hospital last week after
five days for treatment of an undisclosed ailment, is expected to
testify that Bakker called the financial shots.
   Bender and co-counsel George T. Davis aren't saying whether
Bakker will take the stand, and neither is Bakker, who quit PTL in a
sex and money scandal in 1987.
   Also expected to testify this week against Bakker is former aide
James Taggart, who, with his brother, David, was convicted in July
of tax evasion and conspiracy over their use of PTL cash advances
for personal purchases.
   On Friday, David Taggart was sentenced to more than 18 years in
prison and James to more than 17 years.
   Mrs. Bakker will not testify, lawyers said.

<DATELINE>TYLER, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Watson William Wise, a Texas oilman and
philanthropist who was appointed a United Nations delegate by
President Dwight D. Eisenhower, has died. He was 89.
   Wise died Saturday at Mother Francis Hospital, but officials
there would not release a cause of death.
   A native of Ohio, Wise graduated from Yale and moved in 1925 to
Texas, where he started Wise Operating Inc., Wise Drilling Inc. and
Watburn Oil Co. He later wrote three books about his world travels.
   Wise funded dialysis centers in several Texas cities, Paris and
Seoul in memory of his father, William A. Wise, who died of kidney
failure in 1946.
   In 1984, he donated the Watson W. Wise Medical Library at the
University of Texas Health Center at Tyler.
   Wise also funded the Watson W. and Emma Wise Cultural Arts Center
and Wise Auditorium at Tyler Junior College, where he served on the
board of trustees from 1950-70. He also donated a wing to a library
at Yale University.
   In 1958, President Eisenhower appointed Wise a delegate to the
United Nations' 13th General Assembly. He later served as special
counsel to NATO.
   Survivors include his wife, Emma Wise, of Tyler, a son, daughter
and several grandchildren.
   A funeral service is scheduled for Tuesday at First Presbyterian
Church.

<HEAD>Report: Pilot Error Caused July Air Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilot error and bad weather caused a
Philippine Airlines plane to overshoot the runway and slam into a
busy highway last July, killing eight people, according to a report
released Monday.
   About 90 people were injured when the twin-engine BAC 1-11 jet
plowed through a concrete wall, slammed into four vehicles along
Manila's South Expressway and came to rest on railway tracks. All
the dead were in cars on the highway.
   The government's Air Transportation Office released a 13-page
report on the July 21 accident after completing six weeks of
investigation.
   ``The probable cause of the accident was that the pilot exhibited
poor judgment during landing and that the weather was a contributory
factor,'' said the office chairman, Oscar Alejandro, who read the
findings to reporters.
   Analyses of the flight recorders showed the pilot twice told
tower controllers he could not see the runway because of heavy rains
as he made his approach after a flight from Zamboanga City, 540
miles to the south, Alejandro said.
   When the airplane was 150 feet above the runway, tower
controllers saw the plane and told the pilot to accelerate,
Alejandro said.
   ``It was at this point that the air traffic controllers told the
pilot to make a misapproach, in other words, to go around and try
for another landing,'' Alejandro said. ``Instead, the pilot decided
to land.''
   Alejandro said that under Philippine law, testimony in the report
cannot be used against the pilot, Capt. Ricardo Misa, in any civil
suits.
   ``Our investigation is not punitive. We just want to know what
happened so we can correct them, so that it does not happen again,''
Alejandro said.
   The report recommended that approach and landing lights be
repaired both at Manila and the international airport in Cebu City.
Alejandro said there were conflicting reports if the lights were
actually on during the accident.

   A landslide that sent 25,000 cubic yards
of rock tumbling into a gorge has caused the formation of a lake in
the Siskiyou National Forest.
   The unnamed lake apparently was formed last year and was
discovered three weeks ago by U.S. Forest Service surveyors.
   ``It's pretty impressive,'' said Galice Ranger District
hydrologist Patricia Carroll, who estimates the lake may be 40 to 50
feet deep and 2,000 feet long when Silver Creek is high.
   The lake is one mile downstream from Silver Falls and about 25
miles west of Grants Pass. It probably too small and shallow to
provide prime fish habitat. But Carroll and others think it can
become a fine recreation area. Nearby falls, rich vegetation and the
dramatic sheer rock and cliff formations make for striking scenery.

<TEXT>
   Two top-ranking officials of the
South-West Africa People's Organization returned from exile in
Angola on Monday and were expected to be joined later in the week by
Sam Nujoma, president of the once-outlawed group.
   Secretary-General Andimba Toivo ya Toivo and National Chairman
David Meroro, accompanied by dozens of other officials from the
organization, arrived at the Windhoek airport on a flight from
Luanda.
   ``Home, sweet home,'' ya Toivo said after kissing the tarmac.
``It is very sweet to be back.''
   The group waged a 23-year bush war against South African rule of
Namibia. Late last year, South Africa agreed to grant independence
to Namibia, which it has ruled since World War I.
   As part of the transition to independence, elections are
scheduled in November for an assembly that will draft a constitution
for a new nation. SWAPO is favored to win the most seats in the
assembly.
   No independence date has been set, but it is likely to be early
next year.
   Registration for voting ends Friday, and Nujoma is scheduled to
end his 30 years of exile Thursday so he can participate in the
polls.
   Ya Toivo, considered the group's second-ranking official, was one
of its founders in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
   He was convicted of terrorism under South African laws in 1967
and served 17 years in South African prisons until his release in
1984. Ya Toivo, 65, returned briefly to neighboring Namibia, then
left under self-imposed exile.
   Meroro has been the organization's national chairman since 1964
and has lived outside Namibia since 1975.

   Jury selection began today in the
trial of a former nurse's aide accused of smothering five nursing
home patients in a pact with her lesbian lover.
   Circuit Judge Roman Snow rejected defense requests to move the
trial outside the county and to dismiss the charges based on a
private polygraph test.
   Gwendolyn Graham, 25, is accused of smothering five women
patients in 1987 during her overnight shift at Alpine Manor Nursing
Home in suburban Walker. She is charged with five counts of murder
and one of conspiracy and could be sentenced to life in prison.
   The key witness is expected to be her alleged accomplice and
former lover, Catherine Wood. Last week, she pleaded guilty to one
count each of murder and conspiracy. Other charges were dropped in
exchange for her testimony.
   In previous court appearances, Wood has said she and Graham
discussed killing as many as 20 patients. She described how Graham
chose patients whose poor condition would leave no signs of a
struggle and used a washcloth she carried in her back pocket to
suffocate them.
   Wood said Graham told her that killing the patients helped her
relieve tension. Wood, 27, said she agreed to go along with the
killings, sometimes acting as a lookout, because she hoped it would
bind her with her lover.
   ``She was always happy when one of them died,'' Wood testified.
   Wood also said that Graham took a souvenir from each victim _
including earrings, anklets and handkerchiefs _ and that the two had
planned to select victims whose initials spelled ``murder,'' but the
plan failed because some victims struggled too much.
   Graham's attorney said he believes Wood is a pathological liar
and made up the story to get even with Graham for leaving her for
another woman.
   Police began investigating late last year after Wood's ex-husband
reported she told him she took part in the slayings.
   The deaths of the five patients, ages 60 to 97, had been
attributed to natural causes and no autopsies were performed. Three
of the five were cremated; the two other bodies were exhumed, but
autopsies found no definitive evidence of suffocation.

<TEXT>
   Forest fires caused by tank and artillery
battles raged in the hills around Beirut on Monday, trapping
thousands of people in mountain towns ringed by flames. At least 11
people were reported killed in the latest fighting.
   In the waters off the Christian sector, Syrian gunboats seized a
ship carrying supplies to the beleaguered Christians. A senior Iraqi
official said Iraq will urge Arab League ministers to call an
emergency Arab summit to press Syria to leave Lebanon.
   The second gunfight in three days erupted in south Lebanon, where
Israeli troops killed at least one guerrilla.
   The mountain fighting centered on Ein el-Tuffaha, 18 miles east
of Beirut, and the Christian stronghold of Souk el-Gharb, 16 miles
to the south. The two towns sit on roads leading to the Christian
enclave from the predominantly Shiite Moslem Bekaa valley.
   Syrian guns above Ein el-Tuffaha hammered the Christian town of
Bekfaya for seven hours, setting the surrounding woods afire.
   Bekfaya's estimated 15,000 people were trapped in basements
because fires blocked all escape routes from the town. Another 5,000
people were stuck in nearby Ein Saadeh, said a police spokesman.
   Both sides battled with tank fire overnight and through the day
Monday around Souk el-Gharb, ringed by Syria's Druse allies.
   Along Beirut's dividing Green Line, Syrian and Christian troops
clashed with automatic weapons as howitzer and mortar guns thundered
overhead, keeping the city's remaining 150,000 residents in bomb
shelters.
   Most of Beirut's 1.5 million people have fled the battered city
over the past six months, seeking refuge in north, east and south
Lebanon.
   Police said 11 people died and 34 were wounded in the latest
Syrian-Christian duels. That raised the casualty toll to at least
844 killed and 2,508 wounded since March 8, when fighting erupted
between the soldiers of Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun
and the Syrian army.
   The mountain battles were the heaviest since the U.N. Security
Council appealed for a cease-fire Aug. 16.
   In recent weeks, the Syrians and Druse militiamen have been
pressuring the Christian defenses along the 66-mile mountain front
forming the eastern flank of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave,
where an estimated 1 million Christians are trapped with their backs
to the Mediterranean.
   Two Syrian gunboats intercepted the merchant ship Carla about 20
miles off the coast of the enclave at mid-morning as it tried to
bring supplies to the Christians, a police spokesman said.
   The vessel was escorted to the Syrian-controlled port of Tripoli
in north Lebanon, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He had no information about its nationality or owners.
   The Syrian navy has turned back several ships trying to reach the
Christian sector. Eight vessels have been sunk or set on fire by
Syrian artillery.
   Christian radio stations blamed the Syrians for the escalation in
fighting, claiming they want to sabotage peace efforts of an Arab
League committee.
   ``We're back to the same old game,'' said an announcer on the
Voice of Free Lebanon radio. ``Whenever the committee schedules a
new meeting, the Syrians let all hell break loose while publicly
pledging cooperation to defuse the fighting.''
   The foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria, the
three members of the committee, are to meet Wednesday in Saudi
Arabia in an effort to reactivate peace efforts.
   It will be their first meeting since July 28, when they said
efforts to reach a cease-fire had been stymied by Syrian
intransigence.
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate to quell the civil war. Aoun says the
Syrians betrayed their peacekeeping mission by siding with the
Moslems in the civil war. The Syrians refuse to withdraw their
troops.
   A senior Iraqi official in Baghdad, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press his country believes an
emergency Arab League summit is the best way to end Lebanon's
14-year-old war.
   He said Iraq will urge Arab League ministers to call the summit
to press Syria to leave Lebanon.
   Iraq is Syria's archrival in the Arab world and backs Lebanon's
Christians.
   In south Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said Israeli soldiers
killed two guerrillas in a firefight in Israel's self-declared
``security zone.'' The Israeli army said one guerrilla was killed
and another captured.
   The sources said two Israeli soldiers were wounded. The Israeli
army reported three soldiers wounded.
   The Lebanese National Resistance Front, a loose coalition of
pro-Syrian leftist and Palestinian guerrillas, claimed
responsibility for the shootout in a terse statement that gave no
other details.
   A source said the guerrillas infiltrated the security zone
``possibly with the intention of attacking an Israeli post there
when they were spotted.''
   Israel carved out the 6- to 10-mile-wide strip to protect itself
from guerrilla raids.

<HEAD>Pentagon Agency Looking Beyond Texas For Testings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Nuclear Agency says it will look
beyond Texas for a site to conduct deep-underground explosions,
after abandoning its preferred location at a Del Rio ranch, the
state's senators said Monday.
   After local residents complained the tests might affect the only
source of water in the border community, the DNA said last month it
would discontinue studying the Buck King Ranch site, but that it
would evaluate other sites in Texas.
   In a letter released today by Sens. Lloyd Bentsen and Phil Gramm,
the DNA's new director, Maj. Gen. Gerald G. Watson, said the
Pentagon agency has stopped all test drilling operations at the
site, is shutting down the drilling rig and has begun clean-up
operations.
   ``Currently, we are re-examining our geologic and hydrologic data
base outside Texas for the purpose of finding the next best site for
the program,'' Watson said in a letter dated Sept. 8.
   The Pentagon agency had spent two years before chosing the Buck
King Ranch for additional evaluation to determine its suitability
for the non-nuclear explosions. The tests are designed to simulate
the impact of nuclear blasts on subterranean missile silos and to
evaluate the hardness of U.S. and Soviet deep underground command
and control facilities.
   ``This is a good decision, easing our concerns about possible
damage to the water supply in an area where water is scarce and
responding to the strong community opposition,'' said Bentsen, a
Democrat.
   Gramm, a Republican, said he was ``delighted that the DNA has
reached a final decision to pack up and look elsewhere for a test
site. It's clear from the director's latest letter that the
unanimity of local opposition had a strong specific impact on the
DNA's decision.''

   Ten Harris County Jail inmates remained
hospitalized Monday, eight with flu-like symptoms and two with the
same bacterial infection that has killed two other prisoners,
authorities said.
   The eight inmates' symptoms, which included fever, dizziness and
nausea, could be early signs of the same deadly bacteria or they may
just be indications of the flu or a mild infection, Ben Taub
Hospital spokeswoman Nora Shire said.
   One of the two inmates who has the bacterial infection was in
very critical condition, Ms. Shire said. He has a fever, congestion
and is on a respirator.
   Jail inmates say they have been in near panic since the outbreak
began last week, with guards reportedly shunning anyone with a runny
nose or other symptom of the pneumococcus bacteria infection.
   ``This thing is either going to kill us, or we're going to kill
each other,'' inmate Mike Reese told the Houston Chronicle. He was a
cellmate of one of the men who died of the illness Thursday.
   Preliminary autopsy results indicate the two dead men had
pneumococcus or pneumococcal sepsis, a bacterial infction that
affects the lungs.
   Neither of the men who died had a spleen and that is believed to
be a contributing factor in their deaths. Removal of the spleen,
which helps clean the blood, can impair the immune system.
   The inmate in critical condition also does not have a spleen,
said jail medical administrator Lanny Chopin.
   Chopin said county authorities have not found a common source of
the infection. The dead inmates were in separate cellblocks on the
ninth floor, officials said.
   At least two representatives of the federal Centers for Disease
Control were to fly to Houston to help investigate the illnesses,
Ms. Shire said.

crashed.
   The driver of one of the trains was killed instantly, the

Nine of the injured were in serious condition.
   The railway said the crash was the result of human error because
one of the trains was mistakenly directed onto the track the other

<TEXT>
   A pile of more than 1 million used tires
caught fire for the second time in five years and spewed acrid,
black smoke today.
   John Gifford, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency
Management, said it could take days or even weeks to put out the
blaze at the seven-acre dump.
   Gov. Judd Gregg this morning called the fire ``a disaster waiting
to happen, and it happened.''
   Another fire burned at the site for days in 1984, and state
officials later seized the dump in an attempt to clear it. The blaze
broke out as a company hired by the state in July was about to get
rid of the tires, said Gregg, who earlier this summer declared the
gargantuan pile ``a plague on Danville and the state.''
   About 175 firefighters from 48 communities removed tires from the
fire's path and dug trenches. About one-third of the pile was on
fire.
   The fire, whose cause had not been determined, broke out about
7:30 p.m. Sunday. At midmorning, flames were visible a mile away and
smoke could be seen from eight miles.
   About 50 people were evacuated from their homes Sunday and early
today, and several roads in the rural area 40 miles north of Boston
were closed.
   Amy Juchatz, a toxicologist in the state Division of Public
Health Services, said smoke from burning tires could contain harmful
lead and zinc, as well as chemicals that can cause cancer.
   An Environmental Protection Agency team was being rushed from New
Jersey to assist, Gifford said.
   The state sued Ernest Hunt, who began collecting the tires about
15 years ago, after the 1984 fire, and later seized control of the
dump from him.
   At one point, Hunt was declared financially unable to clean up
the dump, but he was later indicted on perjury charges stemming from
what he said during that hearing, authorities said. His whereabouts
are unknown, officials said.
   After seizing the dump, the state contracted with Integrated Tire
of Buffalo, N.Y., to shred the tires and ship them to Greece to fuel
a cement plant.
   The blaze was so severe that firefighters quit using water on it
this morning, because even at 2,500 gallons per minute, it vaporized
immediately.
   Instead, a hastily assembled fleet of 22 large trucks began
dumping 25-ton loads of dirt onto the fire from a nearby
sand-and-gravel pit.
   Fire Chief Bill Timmons said the dumping would continue for at
least a couple of days.
   Paul Groulx of EPA's regional office in Boston said $500,000 from
the agency's Superfund program was allocated this morning to help
pay for the firefighting because of the potential for contamination
of the air and ground.

   Noting that 10 children were among the 112
victims of a jetliner crash in Iowa, U.S. Rep. Jim Lightfoot on
Monday called for federal regulations requiring the use of child
safety seats on airplanes.
   ``There's good reason to believe that if some of those children
had been better restrained, they would have survived the crash,''
said Lightfoot, an Iowa Republican who sits on the House Aviation
Subcommittee.
   Lightfoot called for the Federal Aviation Administration to write
new rules requiring all children under 2 to be restrained in an
approved seat.
   ``Most states mandate the use of safety seats in cars, yet we
don't extend the same protection to children who fly, even though
they're extremely vulnerable to the hazards inherrent in air
travel,'' he said in a news release.
   Ten children, including two infants, died when United Airlines
Flight 232 crashed July 19 in Sioux City.
   Lightfoot said he is writing a letter to FAA Administrator James
Busey to ask that the agency review its regulations on the safety
seats and he is asking the House Aviation Subcommittee to hold
hearings on the issue.
   FAA spokesman Dick Stafford said from Washington Monday that the
agency has been reviewing its policy on child restraints since the
Sioux City crash. He said he was not familiar with Lightfoot's
proposal, and could not speculate on what regulations might be
adopted in the future.

<HEAD>Tutu Meets With U.S., 13 Other Diplomats; Police Promise No More

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Monday they will
stop using whips against anti-apartheid protesters because of
``negative reactions'' at home and abroad.
   Two prominent critics of the police, Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, discussed their concerns in Cape
Town with diplomats from the United States and 14 other countries.
   Tutu said he asked the diplomats to ``categorically condemn the
brutalities of the security forces.''
   Activists claim at least 23 and as many as 29 black and
mixed-race people were killed Sept. 6 in election night violence
allegedly instigated by police in townships near Cape Town.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok has called Tutu a liar and
disputed the activists' figures. Vlok says 10 people were killed in
black-on-black factional fighting and that five other deaths are
under investigation.
   ``Even if we dealt only with (the police) figure, it is a
scandal,'' Tutu said. ``Fifteen is a massacre.''
   U.S. Ambassador William Swing was among the diplomats meeting
with Tutu and Boesak.
   ``My government believes it is important to listen to their
concerns and their points of view, particularly about the recent
deaths in the Cape Town area,'' Swing said afterward. ``We are
saddened by the reports of the deaths and we deplore this and all
violence.''
   Relatives of several victims say police were responsible for the
killings. Journalists and residents saw police marching through the
townships firing live ammunition.
   Police and demonstrators have clashed almost daily since a
nationwide campaign to defy anti-apartheid laws began Aug. 2. The
protests were designed to mobilize opposition to the segregated
parliamentary elections, which excluded blacks, but activists have
vowed to continue the campaign.
   Police have used whips, live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear
gas to break up recent protests.
   The whips often were employed because ``as a rule it may result
in less serious injuries than, for example, batons,'' a police
statement said.
   But, the statement added, ``the use of quirts has resulted in
negative reaction from the public, also internationally, (so) it has
been decided to stop its use.''
   Among those alleging police brutality is a mixed-race police
lieutenant, Gregory Rockman, who said riot squad members acted like
``wild dogs'' when they beat schoolchildren and bystanders during a
peaceful pre-election protest.
   Rockman said he received a telephone call Monday at the police
station where he works and was told he would be killed.
   A march protesting police violence is planned in Cape Town on
Wednesday, when the Electoral College is expected to give acting
President F.W. de Klerk a full five-year term.
   Cape Town Mayor Gordon Oliver and several anti-apartheid members
of the city council say they will help lead the march along with
Tutu and Boesak, a mixed-race minister who is president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   Oliver has urged police to ``stay away, or if they must be there,
they should take a low-profile role and not intervene.''
   A pro-government newspaper, Beeld, called Monday for a full
accounting of the election violence.
   ``Did those who maintain law and order commit all those deeds
attributed to them?'' Beeld asked in an editorial. ``Are Archbishop
Tutu and Dr. Boesak's allegations totally false, or do they contain
a grain of truth? Even a grain would be too much.''

<TEXT>
   Jury selection began Monday in the
trial of a former nurse's aide charged with killing five nursing
home patients in a bizarre pact with her lesbian lover, who has
pleaded guilty.
   Gwendolyn Graham is charged with five counts of first-degree
murder for allegedly smothering the women at Alpine Manor Nursing
Home in suburban Walker. She also is charged with one count of
conspiracy to murder.
   Kent County Chief Circuit Judge Roman Snow denied defense motions
to move the trial to another county and to dismiss the charges based
on results of a private polygraph test.
   Prosecutors are basing most of their case on the confessions of
Graham's alleged accomplice and former live-in companion, Catherine
Wood.
   Wood pleaded guilty last week to one count each of second-degree
murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Two counts of first-degree
murder against her were dropped in exchange for her testimony
against Graham. Wood faces up to life in prison, with a chance of
parole in 10 years.
   Wood has said she and Graham discussed killing as many as 20
patients during their overnight shifts at Alpine Manor in 1987.
   Graham, 25, is accused of smothering the victims with washcloths,
choosing those patients whose poor physical condition would leave no
signs of a struggle. Almost all of the patients were bedridden, and
many suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
   Wood, 27, said Graham told her killing the patients helped her
relieve stress. She said she agreed to go along with the killings,
sometimes acting as a lookout, because she hoped it would bind their
love.
   Graham and Wood allegedly took souvenirs from each victim _
including earrings and handkerchiefs _ and had planned to spell
M-U-R-D-E-R with the victims' initials. That plan failed because
some targeted victims struggled too much, Wood testified.
   Graham's attorney, James Piazza, has said he believes Wood made
up the story to get even with Graham for leaving her. Graham left
Michigan for her hometown of Tyler, Texas, after the two split up in
July 1987.
   Walker police began investigating late last year after Wood's
ex-husband told them his former wife had confessed to her part in
the slayings.
   When the five patients died from Jan. 18 to April 7, 1987, their
deaths were listed as natural and no autopsies were performed. Three
of the alleged victims were cremated; the two other bodies were
exhumed, but autopsies revealed no definitive evidence of
suffocation.
   Nursing home administrators had given both employees high marks
and Wood had been promoted to nursing aide supervisor. Both women
quit their jobs before the investigation began.
   The trial is expected to last about two weeks.

<HEAD>White House Says No Combat Role Envisioned in Latin America War on
Drugs</HEAD>

   A secret directive signed by President Bush
dealing with U.S. military involvement in the war on drugs does not
envision using U.S. forces in any combat role in Latin America, the
White House said today.
   A member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, however, said the
military will provide protection to U.S. drug enforcement agents and
other law enforcement officials operating in such nations as Bolivia
and Peru.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed Bush
recently signed a directive outlining the goals and limits of
military involvement in the war on drugs, but he said it does not
authorize the use of U.S. troops in combat.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said the directive authorizes the
military ``to be physically involved with units in the field where
we have been invited to have our law enforcement people.''
   He said such protection is designed to prevent incidents similar
to the torture and murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, in
Guadalajara, Mexico, in Febuary 1985.
   ``We can't afford another Camarena,'' said DeConcini, a member of
the intelligence committee.
   Presidential spokesman Fitzwater also threw cold water on a
statement by drug enforcement administrator John Lawn that the
administration is reconsidering whether to ban the sale of assault
weapons produced in the United States.
   ``We aren't aware of any reconsideration,'' Fitzwater said. ``By
that I mean there's none in the White House. ... I know the White
House position has been given to me by the highest authorities.
   Fitzwater declined to give details of the secret directive on the
drug war.
   ``These documents do not contemplate the use of troops,''
Fitzwater said.
   However, he refused to disclose what the documents actually
authorize. Asked if the directive left the door open for the use of
troops under some conditions, Fitzwater said, ``I really can't go
beyond that it doesn't contemplate the use of troops. I think the
interpretation can fairly be made that it doesn't authorize troops,
either.
   ``We can argue about words, we can argue semantics, but the fact
is, it doesn't not contemplate the use of troops,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said the approximately 30 U.S. advisers involved in
anti-drug efforts in Colombia do have the right to defend
themselves. He said that is the standard policy for U.S. troops
anywhere in the world.
   ``They are there. There is a risk. Colombia is a very dangerous
place to be these days,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush sent security advisers to Colombia as part of a $65 million
package designed to help that nation fight cocaine, and he said last
Tuesday that an additional $261 million in security aid could go to
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia for the drug war.
   Drug czar William J. Bennett said in a televised interview Sunday
that Bush is willing to send Special Forces advisers to the Andean
nations.
   ``There is no plan for any Special Forces to accompany troops in
Peru or Bolivia into combat missions,'' Bennett said in the ABC-TV
program ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   ``That is not in the plan. ... There is no such plan,'' Bennett
said.
   Bennett said ``we see now in Colombia the presence of American
trainers working with the Colombians, giving them advice, training
them on equipment. This is the kind of thing we would anticipate if
Peru and Bolivia take the steps.''
   On the issue of assault rifles, the administration has banned
their import, but Bush has said he opposes a ban on domestic weapons.
   Lawn, appearing on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' was asked about
Colombia's request that the United States stem the flow of U.S.-made
assault weapons to that country.
   ``We must look now at our own procedures here in the United
States,'' Lawn said. ``...I believe it is something that is under
review, and certainly citizens feel very strongly about the gun
issue ... We in the law enforcement community feel very strongly
when we're out there on the firing line, and our view isn't always
necessarily the view of our leaders.''
   About two dozen members of the U.S. Special Forces based in
Panama have been rotating into Bolivia's Chapare Valley, training
anti-narcotics police there, but they have been barred from patrols.
   The Washington Post, in its Sunday editions, said the directive
would allow the advisers to accompany Bolivian drug forces on
patrol. However, an administration source said ``the military is not
allowed to go out into the jungle on patrol. That is the way it has
been and the way it remains.''
   The Post report quoted an unidentified senior administration
official as saying that ``several hundred'' U.S. military advisers
could be sent to the three nations under the ``Andean initiative''
announced by Bush.
   Bennett said the military advisers in Colombia, although they
were barred from combat, were in ``a dangerous environment. They are
not going to seek out combat or conflict. And we just all hope that
nothing befalls them.''
   A possible expanded U.S. military role in Latin America received
mixed reviews from Democrats in Congress.
   ``It could be a good idea,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del.,
who has emerged as Democratic spokesman on Bush's plan for a war on
drugs. ``I can say that I do not dismiss the notion of using U.S.
troops in certain circumstances in the Andean effort.''
   But Rep. Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat who represents New York
City's Harlem section, which is plagued by drug-related violence,
said, ``It outrages me to think that every time there is an
international problem, we have to talk about the introduction of
American troops.'' Biden and Rangel appeared on the ABC-TV program.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Says Bush Slowing Progress on Arms Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze accused
President Bush on Monday of depriving the world of major arms
control agreements by not taking advantage of opportunities created
by the Reagan administration.
   Shevardnadze made the harsh criticism in an interview with the
government daily Izvestia in advance of his Sept. 22-23 meeting with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The criticism was remarkable because it dealt not only with arms
control but the U.S. attitude toward perestroika, President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reform program. It constrasted with generally upbeat
comments by Soviet officials lately about U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``I think that because of the restrained, indecisive position of
the American administration, both the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R., as
well as the entire world community, have lost a lot,'' Shevardnadze
said in the interview, which was splashed across a half-page.
   He contrasted the ``constraint and timidity'' of the Bush
administration on arms control with progress made during the
presidency of Ronald Reagan, which ended in January.
   ``After recent stormy years, a peculiar lull has set in. The
tempo of movement toward new agreements, in any case on the key
directions of real nuclear disarmament, don't satisfy us,''
Shevardnadze said.
   The Soviet envoy contrasted the 1987 superpower agreement to
eliminate medium-range nuclear weapons with a lack of progress under
Bush on pacts to reduce strategic nuclear weapons and ban nuclear
weapons tests.
   In June, he said, Soviet negotiators entered resumed talks on
strategic arms with fresh proposals, but despite ``promised `new
ideas,' our American partners frequently preferred to cite a lack of
principle decisions in Washington,'' he said.
   The result, Shevardnadze said, has been the Geneva talks are
``frozen,'' further from an agreement now than during the previous
U.S. administration. He told Izvestia the negotiations should have
resumed by building on the foundation laid last fall but instead are
``going around it without an apparent goal.''
   A major dispute in the talks has been over U.S. plans for
space-based missile defenses. The Soviets want to limit the
so-called Star Wars, or Strategic Defense Inititative.
   Disagreement also persists on long-range nuclear-tipped cruise
missiles based at sea. Moscow wants to include them in a treaty but
Washington refuses, saying compliance could not be reliably verified.
   On domestic policy, Shevardnadze said some people in the United
States want to stop perestroika because they think that would
strengthen the U.S. position in the world. Among them, he said, are
people who hope for the ``restoration of capitalism here and the
undermining of the Soviet federation.'' He did not identify the
critics.
   The foreign minister also lamented ``an unrealized series of
possibilities'' for U.S.-Soviet economic ties and accused Washington
of being ``one of the participants in the senseless bloodletting''
in Afghanistan.
   The United States supplies rebels fighting Afghanistan's Marxist
government, which in turn is supplied by the Soviet Union.
   Shevardnadze also accused the United States of using ``dictate
and threats'' in Central America.
   Still, he said his talks with Baker in Wyoming should ``open new
horizons to Soviet-American dialogue'' and added that he and Baker
have been told ``to clear the road for a new Soviet-American summit
meeting.''
   Gorbachev and Bush last met in New York in December. Bush was
vice president at the time.

   Barbara Bush, long a champion of efforts to
teach adults to read, confessed Monday that she's struggling to
overcome a literacy problem of her own _ computer literacy, that is.
   At a White House fete for participants in the Second National
Adult Literacy Congress, the first lady told the dozens of adult
learners that she understands what they're going through.
   She said that this summer, on the theory that ``you never stop
learning in life ... I decided to take up the computer.''
   ``That's just like taking up literacy,'' she said. ``They speak a
language I don't know. There seems to be some code in there I don't
understand. And young people say to me, `Oh, that's easy.'''
   The 150 people in the East Room of the White House laughed.
   The weekend conference attracted literacy experts and adult
students.
   Mrs. Bush said she hadn't mastered the computer, but when she
gets ``really discouraged'' she remembers ``there are a lot of
people out there trying to learn how to read and it's just as
complicated for them, and they're learning so I guess I can.''
   For Estel Sizemore, 58, a great-grandfather who sought help three
years ago, it was his second visit to the White House in less than a
year. The one-time sheet-metal worker was among those honored at a
November ceremony.
   Sizemore, a farmer's son who never got beyond first grade,
attends one-on-one classes at Scarlet Oaks High School in Cincinnati.
   ``It's all free,'' Sizemore said. ``It's embarrassing to get
there, but once you get inside the door, it's like a family.''
   Judy Sawyer, 48, of Pringle, S.D., didn't know the meaning of
``literacy'' until last year when she sought help in Custer, S.D.
   Mrs. Sawyer, a homemaker who has worked as a truck driver and
waitress, said she never learned to read growing up in Moab, Utah.
   ``I finished the ninth grade. How I got there I'll never know,''
said Mrs. Sawyer, who now reads at nearly a fifth-grade level.
   Her goal is to get a high school equivalency diploma and become a
school volunteer to ``find the small children that are having the
hard time and help them so they won't have to go through what I went
through.''
   ``This is like a miracle,'' she said, looking around the
glittering ballroom. ``I used to feel like I was the dumbest thing
that ever walked, that I couldn't do anything.
   ``I didn't know there was so many like me. I thought I was the
only one in the world like me. It felt so good not to be dumb no
more.''
   The conference was sponsored by Laubach Literacy Action, Literacy
Volunteers of America, the International Reading Association and
other groups.

   The reputed finance chief of the Medellin cocaine
cartel pleaded innocent to money laundering today and was jailed
without bond after prosecutors argued he might flee the country no
matter how high his bail.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero _ the first of Colombia's
``Extraditables'' to be brought to the United States for trial _
entered the plea before U.S. Magistrate Joel M. Feldman. Martinez,
36, was extradited under heavy guard on Thursday.
   ``Colombia is hardly the only country in the world where Mr.
Martinez could live, and live quite comfortably with the millions of
dollars to which he has access,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Wilmer
Parker III said in arguing against bail.
   Martinez is accused of helping launder $1.2 billion in drug
profits through U.S. banks for the Medellin cartel, which supplies
80 percent of the cocaine in the United States. It is based in the
Colombian city of Medellin.
   He is the first suspect extradited to the United States in a drug
crackdown begun in Colombia last month. Martinez is among the
so-called ``Extraditables,'' a list of drug figures wanted in the
United States.
   Defense attorney Ed Garland said that Martinez, under an apparent
agreement between the U.S. and Colombian governments, could face 30
years in prison if convicted, the maximum under Colombian law. Under
U.S. law, the maximum would be life in prison and a $4 million fine.
   Garland and co-counsel Oscar Rodriguez of Miami told the
magistrate their client has a graduate degree in marketing, has been
married 15 years, has four children and has held legitimate jobs at
Medellin banks.
   ``He has never come to the United States other than to bring his
children to Disney World on a vacation,'' Rodriguez said.
   Garland asked the magistrate to put Martinez under house arrest.
He argued that Martinez was accused only of laundering drug money, a
``financial transaction'' not serious enough to keep him without
bail.
   But the magistrate disagreed. ``It is well recognized that money
is what oils the machine that allows these unlawful activities such
as cocaine distributing ... to go on,'' he said. ``It is a very
serious offense.''
   Rodriguez said Martinez is being held in solitary at an
undisclosed location. The hearing was postponed to today after
Martinez said last week that he speaks only Spanish and did not
fully understand the charges.
   The case was assigned to U.S. District William C. O'Kelley, who
imposed a gag order on lawyers on the case. Garland had complained
that American anti-drug hysteria might prevent a fair trial.
   No further proceedings were immediately scheduled.
   Weldon Kennedy, agent in charge of the FBI office in Atlanta, has
said agents are on ``an increased state of alert'' against any
retaliation from the cartel. Latin America's drug barons have
carried out bombings and shootings in Colombia in recent weeks.
   Drug traffickers are said to fear extradition to the United
States because they believe they will not be able to escape
conviction and prison.
   Martinez was indicted in March as a result of a 2{-year
investigation dubbed Operation Polar Cap. The investigation resulted
in charges against 127 people and two Latin American banks. Martinez
is reputed to be the cartel's coordinator of a complex, competitive
business that has laundered at least $15 billion.
   The Atlanta-based undercover operation used Drug Enforcement
Administration agents to act as Americans interested in laundering
cocaine profits from Colombia. Court documents said the agents had
an informant who provided details of cocaine and marijuana smuggling
from within the cartel's higher ranks.
   Martinez was arrested during the first weekend of Colombia
President Virgilio Barco's crackdown on drug traffickers. That
crackdown was triggered by the Aug. 18 assassination of a
presidential candidate who was a foe of the drug trade.

   A medical student hurled a bomb into the

no injuries, police said.
   Istanbul Police Chief Hamdi Ardali said consulate guards
apprehended Pembegul Binbir after she tossed the device into the
courtyard of the consulate building in the Tepebasi district at 7:10
a.m.
   The blast broke windows in a consulate car, Ardali said.
   A police statement carried by the Anatolia news agency said the
explosive device contained dynamite stuck in a steel pipe. Ardali
said it was designed to make noise but not to cause much damage.
   The police statement identified the woman as a student who
participated last year in the occupation of the Istanbul University
president's office by leftist students.
   It made no mention of a motive for the attack.

   Reputed Medellin cocaine cartel money man Eduardo
Martinez Romero pleaded innocent Monday to charges of laundering
millions of dollars in drug money in the United States _ a country
he claims to have visited only to vacation at Disney World.
   Martinez was ordered held without bond during a hearing before
U.S. Magistrate Joel M. Feldman, who agreed with prosecutors that
Martinez would flee the country no matter how high the bail. No
trial date was set.
   Martinez, the first of Colombia's ``extraditables'' brought to
the United States, is accused of laundering at least $15 million in
U.S. banks and of being the financial expert behind efforts to hide
$1.2 billion in drug profits earned by the Medellin cartel.
   The cartel is believed responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine
smuggled into the United States.
   Martinez was extradited from Colombia under heavy guard Thursday.
   At Monday's hearing, defense lawyers Ed Garland of Atlanta and
Oscar Rodriguez of Miami sought to portray the 36-year-old Martinez
as a highly educated businessman with a loving wife and four
children.
   They said he has a graduate marketing degree from a Colombian
university, had held several management positions in Medellin banks
and had never come to the United States to set up money-laundering
arrangements.
   The defense attorneys asked Feldman to place Martinez under house
arrest pending his trial.
   ``Obviously, he cannot return to his country because he has been
extradited,'' Rodriguez said. ``He has never been accused of any
crime in Colombia. He has never come to the United States other than
to bring his children to Disney World on a vacation.''
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Wilmer Parker III contended that
Martinez would likely flee if released on bail, no matter how high.
   ``Colombia is hardly the only country in the world where Mr.
Martinez could live, and live quite comfortably with the millions of
dollars to which he has access,'' the prosecutor said.
   Parker noted that Martinez escaped an arrest attempt in Panama in
March shortly after his indictment. He also said Martinez would
likely continue to direct the cartel's money-laundering if released.
   Garland argued that Martinez was accused only of laundering drug
money, a ``financial transaction'' not serious enough to keep him
without bail.
   But Feldman disagreed. ``It is well recognized that money is what
oils the machine that allows these unlawful activities such as
cocaine distributing ... to go on,'' he said. ``It is a very serious
offense.''
   Rodriguez said Martinez is being held in solitary confinement at
an undisclosed location, which is believed to be in the Atlanta area.
   Martinez could receive 30 years in prison under Colombian law, or
life under U.S. law. Garland said it is not yet clear which law
applies.
   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley,
who has prohibited attorneys in the case from commenting. O'Kelley
cited widespread publicity as the reason for the gag order.
   Weldon Kennedy, agent in charge of the FBI office in Atlanta, has
said agents are on ``an increased state of alert'' against any
retaliation from the cartel. Latin America's drug barons have
carried out bombings and shootings in Colombia in recent weeks.
   Security at the federal building was not particularly stringent
Monday despite those concerns.
   Drug traffickers are said to fear extradition to the United
States because they believe they will not be able to escape
conviction and prison. Martinez is among the so-called
``extraditables,'' reputed drug figures wanted in the United States.
   Martinez was indicted in March by a federal grand jury in Atlanta
as a result of a 2{-year investigation dubbed Operation Polar Cap.
The investigation resulted in charges against 127 people and two
Latin American banks.

<HEAD>South Korean President Proposes Unification Steps With North</HEAD>

   President Roh Tae-woo on Monday
proposed new steps toward North-South Korean reunification and said
he hoped a charter for a ``Korean Commonwealth'' could be signed by
next August by the long-divided and hostile sides.
   ``I hope that a South-North summit will take place as quickly as
possible to successfully launch joint efforts ... for opening an era
of full-fledged inter-Korean cooperation and unification,'' Roh said
in a televised address to the National Assembly.
   But, he added, ``the reality is that it will be impossible to
achieve unification overnight.'' He urged North Korea to ``abandon
its policy of unification through communization of the South.''
   Roh said he wants a charter for the commonwealth, an interim
stage for merging the two Koreas, signed by next August. He also
called for measures to build confidence and control arms in an
effort to end the arms race between North and South.
    There was no immediate response from the Communist North, and
South Korea's leading opposition group, the Party for Peace and
Democracy, said Roh's peace gesture failed to reflect the views of
all South Koreans, some of whom demand the removal of U.S. troops
from the South.
   The opposition party called for a ``detailed and active''
government role in easing military confrontation with North Korea.
   North Korea has demanded the withdrawal of U.S. forces stationed
in South Korea, contending American troops are a major obstacle to
unification talks.
   It has called for a confederation under which there would be one
Korea for military and diplomatic matters but each side would
maintain its own political and social system.
   Over the past several decades, unification talks have been held
on and off, but little progress has been made.
   In recent years, South Korean dissidents have called for stronger
efforts toward unification. They want free travel across the heavily
guarded border and the immediate withdrawal of the 43,000 American
troops in the South.
   A radical student, a dissident clergymen and an opposition
lawmaker are in jail for making unauthorized visits to the North.
   Roh's new proposal calls for interim governmental bodies equally
divided between the two Koreas, changing his earlier position that
the South should have a larger representation because it has twice
the population of the North.
   The first step in his plan calls for establishing a Korean
National Community, with the holding of a summit and the signing of
a National Community Charter.
   The second step would be formation of a ``Korean Commonwealth,''
made up of a council of presidents, a 20-member council of
ministers, a 100-member council of representatives and a joint
secretariat.
   The secretariat, perhaps stationed in a border ``Peace Zone,''
would help handle routine commonwealth business, with liaison
offices operating in the capitals of the two nations as
quasi-diplomatic missions, Roh said.
   In the final step, the commonwealth would draw up a constitution
and set up elections for a united nation, he said.
   Five years after Korea was divided in 1945, the North invaded the
South, starting the 1950-53 Korean War. A cease-fire ended the war,
but no peace treaty has been signed.

   Singer Rita Coolidge visited a crime-ridden,
heavily vandalized housing project Monday, walking over dirt paths
littered with broken bottles and looking through paneless windows in
abandoned apartments.
   ``This is a wasteland of available housing,'' she said during a
trip to call attention to conditions in the St. Thomas Housing
Project and the plight of the homeless. She is in New Orleans for a
concert Wednesday to benefit the homeless.
   ``Since 1980, the government has taken $30 billion out of the
housing budget, while the number of homeless has gone up,'' said
Coolidge. ``The housing budget is now only $7.5 billion.
   ``If Congress would just put 15 percent of the defense budget
into housing, these problems could be solved in a matter of years.''
   Another solution, she said, would be to eliminate many tax
deductions used by the rich, and said she plans to tell her
accountant she wants to pay more taxes.
   ``It's no excuse. I intend to do that immediately,'' she said.

   Billionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes took a
weekend motorcycle trek down the Natchez Trace Parkway and stopped
at a plantation home, and described the experience as a 400-mile
``drive-in history lesson.''
   ``It's a beautiful run. It's hard to believe it's as relatively
undiscovered as it is,'' Forbes said Sunday after his ``Capitalist
Tools'' motorcycle club pulled up in front of the antebellum columns
of Melrose Plantation.
   Forbes said the trip was designed to generate publicity for the
historic parkway, following a route once used by pioneers, traders
and trappers headed from Nashville, Tenn., to the Mississippi River
port of Natchez, Miss., and for a national park planned for Natchez.
   ``When people discover it, it's going to be one of the favored
runs in the nation,'' the magazine publisher said.
   The Melrose home will be part of the Natchez National Historic
Park. The park was established by Congress during the past year, and
work to turn the idea into reality is still in the early stages.

   Mayor Don Fraser saw an aide chasing a thief
who had grabbed her purse, so the 65-year-old mayor figured the only
thing to do was join the chase.
   Wearing a suit and tie and leather shoes, the mayor bolted down
office building steps Sunday, raced around the back of a house and
headed up a side street.
   ``As I was running, I was thinking about what I would do if I
caught him,'' Fraser said. ``I don't know. I guess you just have to
do what you can do.''
   But Fraser wasn't quite fast enough. Witnesses said the thief
hopped into a waiting car and was gone.
   Katie Fournier, whose purse was stolen, was impressed with
Fraser's efforts.
   ``He wasn't out of breath,'' she said. ``He must be in good
shape.''

   Alexander Haig, four-star general,
failed presidential candidate, former secretary of state and
one-time aide to Richard Nixon, now has made his debut on stage.
   On Sunday night, Haig and his wife, Pat, narrated Ogden Nash's
verses that accompany Camille Saint-Saens' ``Carnival of the
Animals.''
   The performance with the California Chamber Virtuosi ended a
three-day music festival celebrating the fifth anniversary of
Leisure Village Ocean Hills, a 1,200-unit retirement community. Haig
is on its board of directors.
   Haig said it shouldn't surprise Americans that a former
politician is trying his hand at acting.
   ``It's a first for me in this category, but as an ex-politican I
have been acting in the recent past, rather expensively though,''
said Haig, who owns an international marketing firm in Washington,
D.C., and lectures frequently about global issues.

   The Rev. Jerry Falwell denounced a group of
abortion rights activists as skinheads, Nazis and homosexuals who
deserved one another. Falwell, speaking to worshipers Sunday at the
Rehoboth Baptist Church, also called the National Organization for
Women ``the National Order of Witches'' and the American Civil
Liberties Union the ``Anti-Christian Liberties Union.''
   The television preacher from Lynchburg, Va., was invited by the
church's pastor, who is a trustee at Falwell's Liberty University.
   About 70 sign-carrying pro-choice advocates shouted ``don't go
in'' to the congregation and spoke out against Falwell's support for
Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion organization.
   Falwell told his audience he had heard that the protesters
included ``skinheads, Nazis, pro-abortionists and gays. ... They
probably deserve each other.''
   He also criticized Congress for including AIDS victims in
legislation aiding the handicapped.
   Protester Jack Pelham, founder of the Coalition Against Operation
Rescue, said he was protesting Falwell's visit because ``he stands
against reproductive rights. Every time we hear about his being in
town, we go out and protest.''
   William Adams said he came because ``I am really put off by his
statements on AIDS being a curse from God. I also happen to be very
religious. Everything I hear him say comes off as being hate. The
God I know is about love.''
   Falwell said Operation Rescue's adherents ``demonstrate on the
basis of love for unborn children and little mothers-to-be who are
about to do something that will kill their baby and injure them
emotionally.''
   After the service in this eastern Atlanta suburb, Falwell said he
does not oppose homosexuals. ``I'm opposed to what they do. I lead
gays to Christ every day. Then they change their lifestyle.''

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on Monday
visited Mother Teresa in the Calcutta hospital where the Nobel Prize
laureate was admitted after a heart attack last week.
   Doctors said the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun, still in the
intensive care unit of the Woodlands Nursing Home, was feeling
``much better.''
   ``Mother Teresa had a good night's sleep. Her heartbeat is
regular and she has no temperature,'' said a hospital statement.
   Hospital officials said she was responding well to antibiotics
and a temporary pacemaker, an electronic device that artificially
stimulates contraction of the heart muscles.
   Gandhi and his wife, Sonia, flew to Calcutta from New Delhi to
see Mother Teresa, who gave up a comfortable life as a convent
teacher to care for the poor and dying in the slums of this eastern
Indian city. She won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work.
   During the 10-minute visit in her hospital room, Mother Teresa
put her arms around Gandhi and told him: ``I have seen you as a boy
and now you have grown up,'' according to administrator Deba Prosad
Barooah.
   Gandhi talked with hospital officials about Mother Teresa's
health and asked if they needed anything for her treatment, Barooah
said.
   Earlier, Mother Teresa was examined by Dr. Vincenzo Bilotti, her
longtime friend and cardiologist who arrived from Rome on Monday.
   ``Her condition is good (but) we will have to be careful about
her for a week,'' Bilotti said. He did not elaborate.
   Mother Teresa became ill Sept. 3 and was hospitalized two days
later with a high fever and irregular heartbeat. She suffered a
heart attack Friday.
   Pope John Paul II sent a telegram to Mother Teresa on Sunday,
offering ``assurances of his prayers and spiritual participation''
in her suffering, the Vatican said.
   She also received a message from President Bush wishing her a
quick recovery.

<HEAD>Staying Home: East Germans Who Spurned Freedom Train Fear Crackdown</HEAD>

   East Germans expressed fear Monday that the mass
migration of thousands of their countrymen will mean more hardships
for the millions who stayed behind.
   ``I have this feeling that I have missed the last train to the
West,'' a worried student in East Berlin told The Associated Press.
   Other East Berliners, all speaking on condition their names not
be revealed, expressed the same fear.
   ``Somehow or another those up above (government officials) must
react,'' said a teacher.
   A pastor said conditions in East Germany would become
``unbearable'' if the hard-line Communist government decides to
close off its border with Hungary to stem any future flow of
refugees to the West.
   After Hungary's decision to allow all East Germans vacationing
there to go West, more than 2,000 East German refugees arrived in
West Germany on Monday and more were on their way.
   News reports say the final number of East Germans arriving from
Hungary could top 10,000.
   It was the first time a Warsaw Pact country had aided a mass
exodus of refugees from another East bloc nation.
   The refugees point to repression and the East German government's
staunch resistance to reforms as their reasons for leaving.
   The East German government on Monday angrily denounced Hungary's
actions.
   ``The Hungarian government has chosen to illegally allow German
Democratic Republic citizens (East Germans) to travel to the Federal
Republic (West Germany),'' state-run news media said.
   It said Hungary ``under the guise of humanitarianism is engaging
in organized smuggling of humans.''
   The criticism appeared in East Germany's Neues Deutschland and
Junge Welt newspapers and was broadcast on radio and television.
   Junge Welt, the East German Communist youth newspaper, also
charged that Western media were misinterpreting the defection of
East Germans ``as a judgment against socialism.''
   On Sunday, the Communist-run news agency ADN charged Hungary had
violated a 1969 agreement with East Germany that forbids allowing
each other's citizens from crossing their borders to go West without
official permission.
   Hungary is one of the most popular places for East German
tourists, especially since that East bloc country has been adopting
political reforms.
   East German citizens can easily cross into Hungary, but many are
denied the right to visit the West.

<TEXT>
   The trial of several Americans accused
of helping a Colombian cocaine cartel opened Monday with a judge
questioning potential jurors on their knowledge of the trial here
last year of convicted drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas.
   The case grew out of testimony from Lehder's cocaine-smuggling
trial, which lasted 7{ months and saw witnesses implicate others in
a conspiracy the government says began in 1974 and continued until
this year.
   Lehder, the Medellin cartel participant who was extradited from
Colombia, was convicted of smuggling tons of cocaine into the United
States.
   The Medellin cartel, named for the Colombian city where it is
based, is considered the world's largest illegal cocaine operation
and is believed to supply 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the
United States.
   Many of the best-known leaders of Colombian cocaine cartels are
defendants in the trial, but are still at large.
   Facing trial are Jack Carlton Reed, 58, who was convicted with
Lehder on one conspiracy count and sentenced to 15 years in prison;
Thomas Howard Herington, 35, of Mill Valley, Calif.; attorney Barry
Kane, 52, of Hyannis, Mass., and Fort Lauderdale; Donald Kenneth
Lady, 41, of Pomona, Calif., and Samuel Thomas Stewart, 53, of
Anaheim, Calif.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to prison terms of 10 years
to life.
   Absent defendants include cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria,
Jose Gonzalo Rodriquez Gacha, Jorge Ochoa Vasquez and Fabio Ochoa
Vasquez. They are on the list of the government's most-wanted
Colombian drug kingpins and remain at large in Colombia.
   Others indicted but not present are financier Robert Vesco, who
lives in Cuba, and Everette Bannister, an associate of Bahamian
Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling. U.S. officials have
unsuccessfully sought Bannister's extradition.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II began the jury-selection
process by questioning the prospective jurors about their knowledge
of Lehder's trial and whether they had read anything about this case.
   Lehder, 40, believed to have been one of the leaders and
architects of the Medellin cartel, was convicted in May 1988 of
operating a continuing criminal enterprise and was sentenced to life
in prison without the possibility of parole. He is being held in
isolation at the federal prison in Marion, Ill. He allegedly flew 20
tons of cocaine into the United States from 1978 to 1981.
   The indictment in this case charges that in October 1984, Lehder
sent a messenger from Nicaragua to Cuba asking Vesco to use his
influence in Cuba to arrange for Lehder's aircraft to fly over Cuba
on smuggling runs from Nicaragua to the Bahamas.
   A few days later, Vesco allegedly supplied Lehder's messenger
with a document approving the cocaine overflights.
   Vesco, indicted on one count alleging he conspired to import
cocaine, is believed to have lived in Cuba since 1982. He has been
wanted in the United States since 1973 on charges of looting an
investment firm of $224 million.
   Bannister, a resident of Nassau, the Bahamas, is accused of
taking money from the cartel to allow the Bahamas to be used as a
way station for drugs.
   Lehder's former wife, Yemel Nacel, 34, of New York City, and nine
others have pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges and are among the
98 people on the government's witness list.

<HEAD>Dollar-Stabilizing Effort Failing, Imperiling Trade, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The international effort to stabilize the value
of the dollar is in shambles, raising the risk that America's trade
deficit will soar as U.S. products are priced out of overseas
markets, a Washington research group said Monday.
   The Institute for International Economics said the Bush
administration must share in blame for the currency coordination
breakdown, which has allowed the dollar to rise by 20 percent
against the Japanese yen since the first of the year.
   A rising dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive on foreign
markets while cutting the price of imports to American consumers.
Economists view both developments with alarm since they would make
America's still-huge trade deficit even worse by boosting import
purchases and slowing export sales.
   A string of record trade deficits in the 1980s transformed the
United States into the world's largest debtor nation as billions of
dollars were handed over to foreigners to pay for imported goods.
   The Reagan administration launched an effort with the world's
richest industrial nations in 1985 to push the dollar lower as a way
of curing America's trade problems and fending off growing cries in
Congress for protectionist trade barriers.
   The effort by the United States and the other countries in the
Group of Seven _ Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and
Italy _ was credited with reducing the deficit sharply in 1988 as
American manufacturers enjoyed a boom in export sales. However, the
improvement has slowed this year and economists at the private
institute predicted the deficit would begin worsening again in 1990
because of the dollar's jump in value.
   The G-7 countries have been frustrated in their efforts to
stabilize the dollar at much lower levels.
   In trading Monday in Tokyo, the dollar shot to a three-month high
against the Japanese yen despite dollar-selling intervention on the
part of the Bank of Japan.
   ``The financial markets now view the G-7 process as having lost
all of its credibility,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the
private Institute for International Economics. ``They have violated
their own target zones (for the dollar's value) and have made no
serious or concerted effort to preserve them.''
   Bergsten, who was assistant Treasury secretary for international
affairs in the Carter administration, blamed the unruly dollar in
part on a failure by the Bush administration and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady to make international economic coordination a top
priority.
   ``One reason the G-7 process is in shambles is because the U.S.
government is not giving it the kind of push that (former Treasury
Secretary James A.) Baker did in 1985 through 1987,'' Bergsten said.
   The institute released a new book Monday aimed at raising the
political profile of the problem by getting Congress and other
agencies of the executive branch more involved in setting dollar
policies.
   The book, ``Dollar Politics: Exchange Rate Policymaking in the
United States,'' urged that the current process for setting dollar
policy be broadened beyond the small group of officials at the
Treasury and the Federal Reserve who are now making the decisions.
   It proposed setting up new congressional oversight committees in
both the House and the Senate to review decisions made by the
executive branch, building on reporting requirements established by
the 1988 Trade Act.
   The institute also proposed greater involvement by Cabinet
agencies responsible for trade matters in helping Treasury formulate
dollar policies and called for the creation of a private task force
to provide advice to government policymakers.
   The book said that from the Nixon administration forward, the
history of international dollar policy in this country has been one
of periods of neglect followed by hurry-up efforts seeking to repair
the damage caused by improper dollar polices.
   One such period occurred in the early part of this decade when
the Reagan administration ignored a surge in the dollar's value
until 1985 even as the high dollar was pushing the trade deficit to
record heights.
   ``Exchange rate policymaking needs to be substantially improved,
in order to avoid repeating in the coming decade the mistakes and
unnecessary risks of the 1980s,'' wrote I.M. Destler and C. Randall
Henning, the authors of the book.
   Destler is a professor in the School of Public Affairs at the
University of Maryland and Henning is a research associate at the
institute, which receives financing from foundations in the United
States and other countries to conduct studies of various
international economic issues.

<TEXT>
   Two of the nation's longest-serving mayors face primary election
challenges Tuesday, and while Detroit's Coleman Young is expected to
glide into a November runoff, New York's Edward Koch is fighting for
his political life.
   In Texas and California, voters will fill House seats left vacant
by the resignations of two tainted but popular Democratic leaders,
Speaker Jim Wright and Majority Whip Tony Coelho.
   There also are mayoral primaries in Minneapolis and St. Paul,
Minn., Buffalo, N.Y., and New Haven, Conn., among other places.
   Koch, who was written off as a political has-been a few months
ago, has battled back to within striking distance of his main
Democratic primary challenger, David Dinkins. Both men are out to
make history, Koch as the city's first four-term mayor and Dinkins
as its first black mayor.
   Their paths crossed Monday at a school dedication, where Koch
pulled Dinkins aside to call for a unity rally on Wednesday, no
matter who wins.
   ``I think that's a nice gesture,'' said a smiling Dinkins. ``I
mean, he recognizes that the likelihood is that I'm going to
succeed, and he offers to help me, I think that's fine.''
   Koch, who thinks a big turnout of mainstream Democrats will carry
him to victory, said it was important for his party to work on
defeating Republican Rudolph Giuliani, the former federal prosecutor
who leads cosmetic heir Ronald Lauder in the GOP race.
   ``We gotta get started on Giuliani,'' Koch said. ``This guy's got
clay knees, and the reporters are only up to his ankles.''
   In both Texas and California, Democratic congressional candidates
are basking in the support of the disgraced congressmen they are
trying to succeed.
   Although Wright and Coelho resigned because of alleged ethics
violations, both remain popular in their old districts and have been
central figures in the special election campaigns to fill their
seats.
   Wright has campaigned for Fort Worth lawyer Pete Geren, a former
aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas. The Republican candidate, Dr.
Bob Lanier, a television medical commentator, has countered with
endorsements from two other prominent Texans _ President Bush and
former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry.
   Lanier said he initially worried that Wright's endorsement of
Geren would be a major factor in the race, but now believes ``it
hasn't been quite as much as we anticipated.''
   Still, he conceded that he's ``swimming upstream'' as a
Republican in a district with a long history of sending Democrats to
Congress.
   In California's San Joaquin Valley, Coelho has endorsed
Democratic state Assemblyman Gary Condit in a low-key race against
Republican Clare Berryhill, a former assemblyman and state
agriculture chief.
   Berryhill and Condit are considered the leading candidates in a
field of six. Unless one candidate gets more than 50 percent of the
vote, there will be a runoff between the top two vote-getters.
   In Detroit, Young is trying to brush off challenges to his bid
for a record fifth term in office.
   His challengers include Rep. John Conyers, a brash 12-term
Democratic congressman who says Young has been in office too long.
Conyers, who like Young is black, has benefited from the vocal
support of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who exhorted a crowd on Monday to
``keep hope alive'' by voting for Conyers.
   A poll released Sunday showed Young well in front of the pack of
13 candidates, with Conyers running neck-and-neck with accountant
Tom Barrow for second place. The top two finishers advance to the
November general election.
   Nine candidates are battling to succeed St. Paul Mayor George
Latimer, who is quitting after 12 years in office to become a law
school dean. Across the river in Minneapolis, Mayor Don Fraser is
facing six challengers.
   The top two vote-getters in each city will advance to the Nov. 7
general election.
   Buffalo Mayor James Griffin is assured of appearing on the
November ballot. The maverick Democrat, who is being challenged by
two other candidates in the Democratic primary, is also running
unopposed for both the Republican and Conservative party nominations.
   In New Haven, state Sen. John Daniels is trying to become the
first black mayor of the mostly white Connecticut city. Daniels is
locked in a tough fight with John DeStefano Jr., the hand-picked
candidate of Mayor Biagio DiLieto, who is retiring.

<HEAD>Bar Official Says Review Of Complaint Against Congressman Would Be

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state agency that disciplines lawyers would
automatically review any complaint filed against U.S. Rep. Barney
Frank, who recently admitted paying a male prostitute for sex, an
official said Monday.
   But Daniel Klubock, bar counsel for the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, refused to confirm or deny if a complaint against
Frank had been received.
   George Washington University Professor John F. Banzhaf III last
week said he had filed a complaint against Frank, D-Mass., with the
state's Board of Bar Overseers, which investigates complaints
against lawyers.
   Klubock said the board's proceedings are confidential. But
Klubock, who said his position is roughly similar to that of a
prosecutor with the board acting similar to a court, said his office
reviews all complaints.
   ``Our investigation can be limited to reading it and saying this
is nonsense,'' Klubock said, or it can evolve into a full-scale
investigation.
   He said the board, if it decides to take action against an
attorney, can issue a private reprimand itself. He said the most
severe disciplinary action, such as disbarment, is done by the state
Supreme Judicial Court on recommendation from the board.
   Frank has never practiced law and is listed as an inactive lawyer
by the board.
   Banzhaf has asked Frank to agree to a public hearing. ``He says
the matter should be cleared up,'' Banzhaf said.
   Frank himself has called for an investigation into the matter by
the House ethics committee, saying he wants to clear the public
record.
   Frank, who is homosexual, last month said he paid Stephen Gobie
for sexual services, then hired the man as his personal aide. Frank
said he did not know Gobie was running a prostitution service from
the congressman's Capitol Hill apartment. He said he fired Gobie in
1987 when he found out.
   Frank also said he wrote several letters to Gobie's probation
officer and used his congressional immunity to void Gobie's traffic
tickets.

   Good grades have taken a back seat to American
students' desire for designer clothes and trendy gadgets, the head
of the National Association of Secondary School Principals said
Monday.
   Executive Director Scott Thomson blames mainly the job market and
the television industry in an article written for the October issue
of the association's monthly journal.
   ``Compared to their international counterparts, most American
students not only have fewer incentives to achieve good grades, they
also have more incentives to hold jobs during the school week,''
Thomson wrote.
   ``A high demand for cheap labor and a premium on teen-age
consumption lure students into the job market,'' said Thomson, who
examined five broad categories that researchers say consistently
affect learning.
   Thomson examined the learning conditions in America and compared
them with those in South Korea and West Germany, concluding that
``American society doesn't measure up.''
   A ``National Report Card'' prepared by Thomson awarded South
Korea an A-minus and West Germany a B-plus. The United States
received a C-plus.
   Thomson pointed to a 1988 North Carolina survey that found half
of the high school juniors were working, with 67 percent of these
students holding jobs 20 hours or more a week.
   In South Korea, he said students ``simply do not hold jobs while
attending school.'' In West Germany, students through all 13 years
of schooling are not employed in the job market except perhaps
informally in family businesses.
   As for television, Thomson said 71 percent of 13-year-old Korean
students consistently watch science programs, while only 37 percent
of Americans of similar age watch science programs, the lowest of
any group studied in an international assessment of math and science
schooling.
   ``The teen-age culture is influenced dramatically by broadcast
television, rock video, and popular music,'' he said. ``It would be
difficult to find any support for educational values in the lot.''
   Thomson said the market analysis firm, Teenage Research
Unlimited, found that television's focus on the teen-age consumer
market has now dropped from age 18 to 15 because the typical high
school junior has nearly $60 a week in spending money from jobs and
allowances.
   ``Brand loyalties are established at an early age, hence the hard
sell to youth. The American television industry tends to view
children and youth as consumers rather than as learners,'' he said.
   The pressure on students to consume may soon extend to the school
classroom as well, said Thomson. Whittle Communications, a
subsidiary of Time-Life Publishing Corp., is offering schools a
daily 10-minute news show with two minutes of advertising in return
for an offer of free television monitors.
   America received a D for prevalence of illegal drugs and Bs for
the percentage of Gross National Product devoted to public
education, place of schooling in the family value structure and the
percentage of families below the poverty line.
   The only A for America was in the percentage of youth age 16 in
school.

   Katrin Windt took a 24-hour
motorcycle ride to freedom in West Germany, awe-struck that her new
home was ``so clean and so colorful'' compared with the drabness of
her native East Germany.
   ``It was so confusing at first, all the electronics shops, the
lights, the advertisements, all the cars, we never saw anything like
that before,'' said the 20-year-old woman, who made the trip with
her twin brother Volkmar.
   They were among the thousands of East Germans who arrived in West
Germany in an exodus that has drawn the wrath of the Communist
leadership in East Berlin.
   The twins said they had obtained vacation visas for Hungary, but
they were still at a border crossing in Czechoslovakia on Sunday
when they heard Hungary opened its borders to the West.
   ``We had visas for Hungary, so we went there and from Hungary we
drove straight here,'' Volkmar said of the trip that took them
through Austria and into West Germany's Bavaria state.
   ``We did not really plan to come here,'' Volkmar said. ``But when
we heard about the opening of the border, we decided this was a
chance.''
   The twins said they had left relatives behind in East Germany.
   ``We have left our parents and a sister in Leipzig. I think our
mother realized that we may decide to cross. We have talked about it
a little bit, but I don't know what my father will say,'' Katrin
said.
   ``We have lost all hope of reforms in East Germany,'' she added.
   Katrin said she was overwhelmed by the sights greeting them in
the West.
   ``This is our first time in the West. My first impression is that
it is so clean and so colorful, especially after you come from East
Germany and Czechoslovakia,'' she said.
   The twins spoke to a reporter shortly after they had crossed
through the Passau border crossing between West Germany and Austria.
   They made the trip from their home in Leipzig on an
East-German-made 250cc MZ motorcycle outfitted with two luggage
boxes on the back.
   Volkmar said he is a carpenter and that he had to help build
stands at Leipzig's autumn trade fair, which ended Saturday, before
he could leave.
   The pair said they hoped to travel south of Passau to resettle in
Bavaria.
   Asked if she was worried about finding a job, Katrin, who worked
taking dictation for state television in Leipzig said: ``I'm a bit
concerned about the future, it's so different, we'll need someone to
advise us how things work here.''
   Simone Thannert, 24, a waitress from the town of Bautzen near the
Polish border, was asked what she planned to do in West Germany. She
said she would take any type of work.
   ``Whatever the case, it can't be worse than in the GDR (East
Germany),'' she said.

   A 5-year-old boy last seen riding his
tricycle near his home was killed by a mountain lion that was later
tracked down and killed, authorities said Monday.
   The body of Jake Gardipe was found Sunday night just 30 yards
from his home, said Missoula County Sheriff's Lt. Greg Hintz.
   Tracking dogs later found a female mountain lion nearby that was
then shot, said Rick Schoening, a game warden for the Montana
Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The animal had blood in its
mouth and claws, he said.
   Jake was last seen at 3 p.m. Sunday, playing near his rural home
two miles north of the tiny community of Evaro in mountainous
western Montana. He was reported missing shortly before 7 p.m. and
his body was found a short time later.
   Fish and Wildlife officials for the Confederated Salish and
Kootenai Tribes, whose reservation boundary runs through Evaro,
joined Missoula County Search and Rescue members in looking for the
boy.
   Residents have spotted two mountain lions in the area recently
and reported that two dogs have been killed.
   Efforts were made Monday to catch the other lion, Hintz said.
   Two fatal lion attacks have been reported in recent years in
California, Kerry Murphy of the Wildlife Research Institute at
Yellowstone National Park said.

   Leftist guerrillas said Monday
they will observe a cease-fire for 11 days to create a favorable
climate for peace talks with the government.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said in a a
communique that the cease-fire, which it termed unilateral, would
begin at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday and end at midnight September 23.
   Representatives of the rebels and the government of President
Alfredo Cristiani, who took office June 1, are to meet in Mexico
City beginning Wednesday. The exchange will be the first peace
discussions between the government and the insurgents since October
1987.
   The FMLN is waging a nearly decade-old revolution against a
succession of U.S.-backed governments. An estimated 70,000 people
have been killed in the conflict.
   The rebels Thursday declared a halt to sabotage of the
electricity distribution system and the national telephone network.
They also suspended the use of land mines and booby traps.
   The guerrillas said Monday the cease-fire and suspension of
sabotage, along with the naming of a high-level rebel dialogue
comission and the acceptance of a venue outside El Salvador, are
clear indications of their good faith.
   ``But we note with concern that Mr. Cristiani and his government
are placing obstacles in the way of the upcoming meeting by opposing
the logical and necessary presence of international witnesses, a
moderator and national and international observers, and in so doing,
are trying to establish a closed dialogue,'' said the communique.
   The government has refused a rebel request that U.N.
representatives attend the talks, saying it is not yet time to
include international observers.
   The FMLN on Monday announced an eight-member delegation to the
talks headed by commanders Joaquin Villalobos and Schafik Jorge
Handal.
   Cristiani last week named a commission that includes two Cabinet
members. The president said he considers this week's sessions
preparatory and that the mechanism for proceeding with talks, rather
than substantive issues, will be discussed.
   ``Everything is developing normally for the meeting and the
reaching of agreements. You must remember that this is the beginning
of a series of conversations so you cannot expect to resolve a
10-year-old problem in a single meeting.''
   Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of El Salvador,
was shuttling between Mexico City and El Salvador to work out
details of the talks with the two sides.
   He arrived in Mexico City in the early morning hours Monday, met
with the rebels and was to return to San Salvador in the afternoon,
carrying a message from the rebels to Cristiani, said Mercedes del
Carmen Letona, a rebel commander in Mexico City.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Bush Anti-Drug Plan Inadequate</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs at end to UPDATE with comments from Kohl, district
attorney.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's new anti-drug plan focuses too
much on lengthy prison terms and too little on treating drug
abusers, witnesses told a U.S. Senate hearing Monday.
   ``If I'd received (a stiffer penalty), I wouldn't be sitting
before you right now,'' said Michael Vann, a drug convict and now
director of a treatment center in Milwaukee. ``I wouldn't be a
productive citizen, I would still be in prison.''
   Vann, who spent 27 months in prison, testified before a field
hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Government Affairs committees,
conducted by Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis.
   The hearing at Marquette University was the first since Bush
unveiled his $7.9 billion anti-drug plan last week, which allocates
about 30 percent toward treatment and prevention and 70 percent
toward law enforcement.
   Witnesses told the hearing tougher penalties would be ineffective
unless the demand for drugs disappears.
   ``No one has addressed why are Americans such heavy abusers,''
said Francine Fineberg, director of a home for mothers who are
addicted to drugs. ``We have to look at the moral fiber.''
   Vann and Queen Hyler, a Milwaukee activist whose son was severely
beaten by street gang members last year, agreed that drug abuse is a
product of poverty.
   ``It's hard to tell a 15-year-old boy living in a family of eight
to stay in school when he can go on the corner and get $1,000 a day
selling drugs,'' Ms. Hyler said.
   ``The U.S. is losing the war on drugs and will continue to lose
it as long as we have a policy that treats drug abuse as a crime,
not as a disease,'' she said. ``We must make the war on drugs a
moral crusade.''
   Vann, a recovering heroin addict, said he underwent 10 months of
treatment and education in prison and that the program _ more than
his punishment _ helped him change his ways.
   ``For many years I thought I only had potential to be a pimp or a
drug dealer,'' he said. ``I have status now because I'm doing
something positive.''
   Kohl noted that Bush's plan contains no additional funds for
treatment and education beyond what has been proposed by Congress.
   ``I'm afraid the president's plan falls short,'' he said. ``It
doesn't give us enough resources. It doesn't make wise spending
choices, and it doesn't focus on mobilizing and empowering
communities to fight the problem.''
   Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann, who has
seen drug-related crime rise dramatically in Milwaukee over the past
year, also said the president's program is underfunded.
   ``I, for one, am willing to pay higher taxes to fully support the
programs needed, not just to fight the war, but to win the war on
drugs,'' McCann said.

<HEAD>US Calls for Strenghtening Cambodian Anti-Communists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Monday that
non-communist forces in Cambodia should be strengthened as a means
of encouraging the pro-Vietnam government in Phnom Penh to agree to
a ``reasonable power sharing arrangement.''
   Spokesman Richard Boucher also said that a strenghtened
non-communist resistance would be better able to hold its own
against any attempt by the Khmer Rouge to seize unilateral control
in Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge is one of three rebel groups opposing the
Hanoi-backed government. The United State opposes a return to power
by the Khmer Rouge based on its 3{ years of repressive rule in the
late 1970s.
   Boucher declined to say whether the United States is attempting
to strengthen the two non-communist rebel groups with the help of
military aid.
   Congress has given the administration the green light to provide
these groups with military aid if it so wishes. But the chairman of
the House and Senate subcommittees on Asia last week said in
separate interviews with The Washington Post that the Bush
administration should hold off on any plan to provide such aid to
the non-communist resistance.
   Last Friday, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon said
that to facilitate a solution in Cambodia, China should restrict its
military aid to the Khmer Rouge and the Soviet Union should curtail
its support for the Phnom Penh government.
   Cambodia has become a high priority issue for the administration
because of the pending completion later this month of the withdrawal
of the remaining Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.
   Efforts to reach agreement on a new Cambodian government once the
Vietnamese troops are gone have not prospered, raising the prospect
of a four-way armed conflict among government forces and the three
resistance groups.

   A high school student was shot and killed outside

   Investigators believed a second youth was injured but he had not
been found, a spokesman said. The shooting happened at 11:15 a.m.

   ``Apparently, they were waiting outside for a class when they
were approached by three males who fired into the air. The victims
tried to flee and were shot,'' said Detective Joseph McConville, a

   Duane Lewis, 18, suffered a gunshot wound to the back and was

spokesman said.
   Investigators had no motive or suspect.

   A plume of smoke from a huge pile of
burning used tires rose 1,000 feet into the air Monday and was
visible 25 miles away, and firefighters dumped tons of dirt to
smother the flames.
   ``We cannot put this thing out today,'' said David Tordoff of the
federal Environmental Protection Agency. ``We can suppress it and
then in a few days put it out.''
   Tordoff estimated that about 2{ acres of the 7-acre pile of tires
about 30 to 40 feet deep was on fire, the second fire in five years.
   William Toland, the state fire marshal, said the cause of the
fire was undetermined. ``It was out of control right from the
beginning,'' he said.
   Tordoff said the fire's heat controlled the firefighters' methods.
   ``We switched from water because even at 2,500 gallons a minute
the water was vaporizing,'' Tordoff said. ``Instead, we will smother
it.''
   About 200 firefighters from 48 communities cleared tires from the
path of flames and dumped water, then dirt, on the fire.
   By mid-morning, 22 large trucks began dumping 25-ton loads of
dirt onto the fire from a nearby sand and gravel pit. Danville Fire
Chief Bill Timmons estimated that the dumping would continue for at
least a couple of days.
   Tordoff said his agency earmarked an emergency $500,000 from the
hazardous waste Superfund for the effort.
   The dump is at the sparsely populated junction of three rural
southeastern New Hampshire towns _ Danville, Kingston and Hampstead
_ about 40 miles north of Boston.
   Soon after the fire broke out Sunday night, neighbors said flames
reached up to 40 feet and could be seen 1{ miles away.
   At daybreak Monday, the smoke could be seen in Massachusetts
communities 25 miles away.
   About 35 people living within a half-mile of the dump were
evacuated and took shelter at a church, with an additional dozen
residents staying with friends and relatives, authorities said.
Several nearby roads were closed.
   Tordoff said EPA scientists were monitoring the air and
underground water near the site for possible harmful contaminants
from the fire.
   The dump was the scene of a spectacular fire that burned for
weeks in 1984.
   Ironically, Gov. Judd Gregg in July had announced that the state
had contracted with a Buffalo, N.Y., firm to remove the tires.
   ``It was a disaster waiting to happen, and it happened,'' Gregg
said.
   Gregg said he hoped Integrated Tire of Buffalo could begin
removing tires in two weeks and shredding them to make fuel for a
cement plant in Greece.
   Ernest Hunt, who began collecting the tires about 15 years ago,
was sued by the state after the 1984 fire, but was declared
financially unable to clean up the dump, the state attorney
general's office said. The state seized control of the dump. Hunt's
present location is unknown.

   John Folse, the Cajun chef who
prepared a Vatican state dinner last week for Roman Catholic bishops
and cardinals, says he plans to send the pope a monthly bucket of
seafood gumbo.
   ``To be able to stand up face to face with the Holy Father and
discuss gumbo, there's no topping that. Then to send him a gallon of
gumbo a month!'' Folse said after his return to Louisiana.
   ``Here's a guy from Poland running the Vatican and he loves
seafood gumbo from Louisiana,'' Folse said. ``Gumbah, that's what he
called it.''
   Folse said Pope John Paul II did not attend Wednesday's dinner,
but he said he met the pope during a private audience.
   He and Ed LeBlanc, executive chef at Lafitte's Landing Restaurant
in Donaldsonville, prepared the meal for 90 church officials of
gumbo, catfish, alligator sausage, grilled duck and some other Cajun
originals.
   ``When you're planning a menu like this, you try to plan
something indicative of Louisiana and something to make people say,
`Gee, I've never heard of something like this,''' Folse said. ``All
of a sudden you've got people from all over the world eating
alligator and loving it.''
   The food was shipped from Louisiana, with help from the State
Department because the Italian government usually blocks imports of
alligator and pork.
   It was not Folse's first trip as ambassador of Cajun food. He
went to Moscow for the summit not long before President Reagan left
office.

<HEAD>Democratic Chairman Urges Caution on Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic National Chairman Ronald H. Brown,
saying ``let's not lead with our chin,'' told Democrats Monday they
should decide on their goals before talking about raising taxes.
   Brown spoke at a one-day conference called by a group of
Democratic political consultants to discuss ways to win the White
House in 1992.
   ``When we entangle ourselves in talk about taxes before we lay
out clear long-term goals and objectives, we dampen the
public-spirited response of Americans who want to believe that we
can act together to make a difference,'' Brown said.
   ``In fighting with the president for our vision of America's
future, let's not lead with our chin,'' he said.
   President Bush, who has persistently vowed not to raise taxes,
said last week that no tax increase is needed to finance his war on
drugs.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said that ``unless the president supports the tax
increases that will be necessary to fight this war, the drug dealers
are going to win.''
   Brown also touched on remarks by Molly Yard, president of the
National Organization for Women, who has raised the possibility of
supporting a third party in pressing for abortion rights and other
women's issues.
   ``We are the party that believes women should make their own
choice when it comes to reproduction,'' he said. ``We believe that
government should protect the right of a woman to make that choice
herself. That's a clear contrast between our parties, and one that I
intend to underscore as our chairman.''
   ``But we also tolerate diversity of opinion, especially on
matters that are so morally complex,'' he said. ``I'm not willing to
let those on the fringe of this debate define the Democrat party's
center of gravity. If Molly Yard doubts the commitment and integrity
of our party on the issue of choice, if she insists that every
Democrat toe her line to every last detail, then maybe we'll have to
win this one without her.''
   Brown urged Democrats to ``starting preaching the Democratic
gospel'' by calling for ``a newly vigorous public spirit,'' but
added that ``programmatic liberalism is not the gyroscope that
guides the national Democratic Party.''
   He said rank-and-file Democrats ``believe that the New Deal
shaped our history and message as Democrats over four decades _ but
now they are ready for something more.''

<TEXT>
   A U.N. conference on strategies and
preventive measures against drug dealing opened Monday with
delegates calling the anti-cocaine war launched by the Colombian
government an ``act of immense courage.''
   ``With worldwide traffic in drugs now second only to that in
armaments, we are forced to face the sobering fact that humankind is
predominantly engaged in the commerce of self-destruction,''
Margaret J. Anstee, director-general of the U.N. Office in Vienna,
said in an opening statement.
   Praising the recent offensive unleashed by the government of
Colombia against cocaine producers, she said, ``The Colombian
government has been faced with a stark choice: it had either to
declare an all-out war on the traffickers, or, in effect, to
surrender.
   ``In an act of immense courage it has unequivocally chosen the
former course and by so doing has earned itself a place in the
history of what has become, for all of us, a world against drugs,''
Ms. Anstee told delegates.
   ``If Colombia were to lose this war, we should all be lost.''
   Colombia is represented at the five-day conference by a
three-member delegation headed by Miguel Antonio Gomez Padilla,
director-general of national police.
   The conference, attended by top government and law enforcement
officials from about 100 countries, is to help police and
enforcement officials formulate new measures against drug
traffickers and addicts.
   ``It is patently clear that there are no simple solutions to drug
abuse control problems. But that emphatically does not mean that
there are no solutions, that all we can do is surrender,'' Ms.
Anstee said.
   ``We must fight and we must win. The cost will be high. But the
cost of surrender would be a catastrophe,'' she said.
   Statistics scheduled to be presented at the conference indicate
drug seizures rose in 1988.
   Opiate and morphine seizures soared by 78 percent and 104 percent
respectively, while heroin and cocaine seizures steadily increased,
the United Nations said in a press release.
   The delegates will examine special law enforcement techniques
against drug abuse and illicit trafficking, with emphasis on
detection, investigation, search and seizure techniques.
   The meeting will also try to identify ways of enhancing law
enforcement effectiveness in seizing drugs, arresting drug offenders
and breaking up criminal syndicates.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed
Monday for a friendly welcome to thousands of East German refugees
pouring into West Germany and said murmurs of discontent in the
country were ignorant and shortsighted.
   ``We in West Germany have been able to live on the sunny side of
German history over the past 40 years,'' Kohl said in a speech at
the national convention of the Christian Democratic Union. ``We have
no right to resist the search for personal happiness of our
countrymen from East Germany.''
   The dramatic opening of the Hungary-Austria border to East German
refugees has not found total approval in West Germany, where many
allege that migrants are more in search of better economic prospects
than freedom from political persecution.
   Kohl dismissed such complaints as ``ignorant bar banter.''
   ``They don't see that these people have left their homes, their
jobs, their friends and their loved ones in order to live here,'' he
said. ``How great the oppression must be for them to give up
everything.''
   At least 2,000 East Germans poured into Bavaria, in West Germany,
from Austria after Hungary opened its border to the West at midnight
Sunday. The number of emigres from East Germany is expected to reach
100,000 by the end of the year.
   East Germans, as well as ethnic Germans from other nations, are
entitled to immediate West German citizenship and social security
under the 1949 constitution that also sets as a goal the eventual
reunification of East and West Germany.
   Kohl said the flow of East Germans to the West is testimony that
the dream of a unified Germany has not died in the Communist state.
   ``The opposite is the case,'' Kohl said. ``Precisely among these
young people is the dream of a common freedom for all Germans kept
alive. And this is a reminder to us in West Germany that our
prosperity cannot be allowed to drag on our hearts.''
   ``Unity, justice and freedom for the German fatherland,'' Kohl
declared. ``That is not an outmoded slogan, but one that belongs to
the future.''

   All 2,200 high school freshmen in the city
will be guaranteed a chance to go to college if they maintain a
C-plus average under a plan announced Monday by a scholarship
foundation.
   The students will be promised sufficient financial aid if they
sign contracts also agreeing to keep a C average in college
preparatory courses and a 90 percent attendance record.
   Parents must agree to an unspecified personal contribution to
college costs, generally at least $700 annually, said Frank Batten,
board chairman of the Tidewater Scholarship Foundation.
   Other groups and philanthropists have similarly helped pay for
college educations under agreements with students.
   The Tidewater foundation is a year-old private venture founded to
encourage more Norfolk high school students to attend college by
helping them find aid. Last year, it helped 307 of 1,300 seniors in
the school system get $1.38 million in college aid.
   Batten said the foundation is trying to broaden its reach by
targeting freshmen.
   ``We need to start to persuade students at a younger age that
they ought to aspire to go to college and that college is a
realistic prospect,'' he said.

   On the eve of the closest mayoral primary in 12
years, Mayor Edward I. Koch crossed paths Monday with rival
Democratic candidate David Dinkins and they pledged their mutual
support no matter who wins.
   They also agreed on a unity rally Wednesday for the winner of
Tuesday's Democratic primary.
   ``I think that's a nice gesture,'' said Dinkins, the Manhattan
borough president. ``I mean, he recognizes that the likelihood is
that I'm going to succeed, and he offers to help me, I think that's
fine.''
   Koch _ who said a big turnout would carry him to victory _ said
it was important for the party to work on defeating Republican
front-runner Rudolph Giuliani in the November general election.
   ``We gotta get started on Giuliani,'' Koch said. ``This guy's got
clay knees, and the reporters are only up to his ankles.''
   A WABC-Daily News poll conducted Saturday and Sunday found
Dinkins supported by 50 percent of likely Democratic voters and Koch
by 43 percent, with a margin of error of six points. The other two
Democratic mayoral candidates, city Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin
and former transit chief Richard Ravitch, are stalled in single
digits.
   ``We have never dropped _ save maybe a point here or there _ but
we have gone constantly upward,'' Dinkins said. ``It seems to
indicate a solidifying of support.''
   But turnout, considered crucial in this race, is difficult to
predict in primaries.
   ``I'm No. 2,'' Koch said at a lunchtime rally. ```Mayday' is a
signal of distress for those who are nautically minded.
   ``I'm saying to everybody who understands that expression, I need
you. Come out tomorrow. Vote for me. Mayday! Mayday!''
   Koch hasn't faced a battle like this since 1977, when he won the
office after a close primary, followed by runoff and general
election races against Mario Cuomo, now the governor. Koch handily
won his primaries in 1981 and 1985.
   ``My supporters are in the tradition of Hubert Humphrey and Harry
Truman, and they don't normally come out in primaries, they come out
in general elections,'' Koch said at a school dedication. ``So if I
can get them to come out in the primary with a large turnout, I
believe I'll win.''
   Dinkins, who enjoys extensive labor support, said: ``We recognize
that we are, at worst, even. And if that be true, then what I think
to be a superior field operation should win for us.''
   The federal Justice Department will have 92 observers monitoring
voting to ensure that minority citizens _ notably Hispanics _ are
not denied the right to vote.

<HEAD>Committee Proposes Former Premier Go Before Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A committee investigating allegations that
former Premier Andreas Papandreou was involved in widespread
wiretapping while in office proposed Monday that the case be given
to a special court for possible prosecution.
   The parliamentary committee said in a report that Papandreou
``willfully instigated through national intelligence chief Costas
Tsimas and intelligence service employees ... the decision to commit
illegal acts and carry out the tapping of telephones,'' committee
chairman Theodoros Anagnostopoulos told reporters.
   Anagnostopoulos said the committee proposal called also for
Tsimas, who is now a member of the European Parliament, to go before
the special court.
   Legislators are due to debate the committee's proposal next week.
If they accept it, the former premier will be sent before the
special high court.
   The special court consists of the Supreme Court president and 12
Supreme Court judges. It would be given the task of conducting a
further investigation and formally trying Papandreou and Tsimas if
it decides to indict them.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, was
succeeded by a conservative-leftist coalition in the June national
elections when no party won an outright majority. He was not present
when the committee's report was handed to Parliament President
Athanasios Tsaldaris.
   The 70-year-old veteran politician is accused of tapping the
telephones of his political opponents and party members from May
1987 to mid-April of this year.
   Anagnostopoulos said targets of the wiretapping included the
leader of the opposition New Democracy Party, Constantine
Mitsotakis; the Communist Party's offices; former President
Constantine Karamanlis; several newspaper publishers; journalists
and three of Papandreou's ministers and members of his security
guard.
   New Democracy and the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and
Progress formed an alliance after the June elections vowing to bring
to trial those accused of scandals in the former administration.
   In a memorandum to the investigating committee last week,
Papandreou questioned the legality of the probe and denied the
allegations.
   The five PASOK deputies on the 12-member committee released a
statement Monday saying the charges against Papandreou ``are totally
unclear and prefabricated.''
   The PASOK deputies said the intelligence service had always
tapped telephones for national security but that no witnesses had
presented any evidence Papandreou was aware of illegalities possibly
committed by the intelligence service.
   Another committee is investigating Papandreou and four of his
former ministers in connection with an alleged $210 million
embezzlement of the Bank of Crete. It is expected to present its
findings to Parliament on Sept. 14.

<HEAD>July Outflow Smallest in 9 Months</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Net deposit withdrawals at the nation's thrift
institutions fell to a nine-month low of $183 million in July, the
government said Monday.
   The outflow was the smallest since October and followed a $4.6
billion withdrawal in June.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision attributed the decreased outflow
to competitive deposit rates and growing public assurance following
passage earlier in the summer of the new savings and loan law, which
includes $50 billion for the industry over the next 26 months.
   ``The moderation in deposit outflows reflected a further
narrowing in the spread between deposit rates offered by thrifts and
their non-depository competition, as well as less concern about
thrifts following enactment of FIRREA (Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act),'' said James Barth, OTS chief
economist.
   Until passage of the new law, the OTS was the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board.
   The OTS had attributed the June outflow to intentional shrinkage
as thrifts prepared to meet the new law's tough new capital rule.
   Roughly one in four of the nation's 2,933 S&amp;Ls do not meet the
new standard _ $1.50 in tangible capital for every $100 in lending _
which becomes effective in three months. The only way thrifts that
cannot attract new capital can comply is to sell off assets such as
loans and pay off liabilities such as deposits.
   Barth said S&amp;Ls in July reduced their assets by $7 billion, a
monthly total exceeded only by $7.6 billion in June and $8 billion
in January.
   Most of the July reduction was accounted for by a record $7.4
billion in mortgage holdings, including $7 billion in mortgage pool
securities, one of the most easily sold assets in a thrift portfolio.
   For the first seven months of the year, a net $39.8 billion have
flowed out of thrift accounts compared with an inflow of $11.5
billion in the first seven months of 1988.

<HEAD>Conference on Poverty Begins, New Tax Program Draws Complaints</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A five-day National Conference on
Poverty began Monday, almost two weeks after the government decreed
unpopular tax measures that included raising the cost of imported
goods by 30 percent.
   Organized by the Ministry of Social Affairs, the conference drew
350 local delegates to discuss the causes of poverty in Haiti, one
of the world's poorest nations.
   About 80 percent of Haiti's nearly 6 million inhabitants live in
absolute poverty and there is 55 percent unemployment, according to
government figures.
   On August 29, the government cut tax deductions for home loans,
lowered the amount merchants must make before they have to pay a 10
percent value-added tax, and raised the declared value of imports by
nearly one-third.
   Politicians, labor leaders and local businessmen protested the
tax measures _ allegedly imposed by the International Monetary Fund
_ saying they would cut purchasing power and cause social upheaval.
   Some delegates said the conference, which hopes to provide
possible remedies to Haiti's grinding poverty, contradicts the
government's economic policy.
   ``The conference is pure demagoguery. The government is trying to
temper the people's discontent while it imposes its austerity
policy,'' said Sylvio Claude, leader of the Haitian Christian
Democrat Party.
   In July, the government decided to cut spending by 15 percent and
to control the flow of foreign currency. But a $60 million budget
deficit has accelerated depreciation of the national currency, the
gourde.
   The projected 1990 budget will be around $280 million, 75 percent
will go to pay government salaries and 13 percent to meet payments
on the $800 million national debt.
   A steady decline in agricultural and industrial production has
dramatically affected state revenue.
   In the meantime, the demand for imported goods has increased
while bureaucratic mismanagement and political instability have
dissuaded both foreign and local businessmen from investing in the
economy.

<TEXT>
   Kenneth W. Starr's courtroom debut as solicitor
general will take place before three appellate judges instead of the
Supreme Court, the usual forum for the government's chief legal
advocate, the Justice Department said Monday.
   Starr will make a rare appearance for a solicitor general in a
lower court this week when he argues a random drug testing case
before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, the
department said.
   He is scheduled on Friday to defend the Federal Aviation
Administration's random drug-testing order.
   An appearance by a solicitor general, whose primary job is to
represent the Justice Department before the high court, before a
circuit court of appeals is highly unusual, according to department
officials and court watchers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The case involves an FAA order that by December the nation's
airlines devise and implement procedures to randomly test pilots,
flight attendants and ground crews for illegal drug use.
   The FAA rules are being challenged by airline employee unions,
who contend that the random drug testing is an unconstitutional
search. The unions also argue that the FAA violated administrative
law when it promulgated the regulations.
   The FAA order, issued last year, is part of the Reagan
administration's initiatives for a drug-free workplace. Random
drug-testing of certain groups of federal employees has been upheld
by federal appellate courts but the issue has not been decided by
the Supreme Court.
   The Bush administration is continuing the initiative.
   Starr declined to comment about his scheduled appearance in San
Francisco. But Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said that
when Starr took office ``he told the staff it was his intention to
do more actual representation in the courtroom.''
   Starr had said this would would include appearances before
appellate courts because ``what was happening in the circuit courts
of appeal was very important,'' Eramian said.
   When the Supreme Court opens its fall term on Oct. 2, Starr is
scheduled to make his first high-court argument when he is to defend
contempt-of-court fines against four Yonkers, N.Y., city councilmen
for defying a court order to adopt a housing desegregation plan.

   Liberal economists Monday attacked a plan
supported by President Bush to slash taxes on capital gains,
describing it as a ``shell game'' to benefit the wealthy.
   ``This may well be the worst tax idea in the history of the
republic,'' Harvard University economist Lawrence Summers said at a
news conference at which he and other analysts said there was no
evidence a capital-gains cut would stimulate economic growth.
   ``This measure does precisely nothing to encourage savings,''
said Henry Aaron, an economist with the Brookings Institution.
   As the House Ways and Means Committee nears a vote on the
proposed reduction this week, panel member Rep. Byron L. Dorgan,
D-N.D., offered an alternative that would deny any benefit to those
with annual incomes over $200,000.
   Dorgan's bill also would raise the maximum tax rate that applies
to income of all kind earned by the wealthiest 1 percent,
eliminating a quirk in the 1986 tax overhaul under which the tax
rate on some wealthy people drops from 33 percent to 28 percent as
income rises.
   There was no evidence that the Bush-backed proposal was losing
support in the committee. By unofficial count, 19 of the 37
committee members _ enough to deliver a one-vote victory _ favor a
temporary capital-gains reduction proposed by Reps. Ed Jenkins,
D-Ga., and Bill Archer, R-Texas.
   It appears the Jenkins-Archer plan will win committee approval
unless Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., can persuade one of six
Democrats favoring it to support a substitute he has drafted.
   The issue has become the biggest tax question facing Congress
since the landmark overhaul of the income tax was enacted in 1986.
It was that law that took away the preferential treatment long
accorded capital gains, profits from the sale of stock and other
assets.
   Capital gains are taxed at the same rate as wages and other
income. During the campaign last year, Bush called for a lower rate
for capital gains to encourage saving, investment and job creation.
   He claimed that cutting the capital-gains tax would so stimulate
the economy that revenue collections would increase years into the
future, thus helping reduce the deficit.
   Democrats dispute that claim, but many expect a capital-gains cut
to produce a one-year burst of revenues, which would make it easier
to meet the 1990 deficit-reduction target.
   Unable to find support for his plan, Bush endorsed the version
offered by Jenkins and Archer. It would cut the maximum
capital-gains rate from 33 percent to 19.6 percent for 2{ years. The
rate then would be raised to 28 percent and the system indexed so
that gains attributed solely to inflation would not be taxed.
   Economists appearing at a news conference sponsored by Reps.
Donald Pease, D-Ohio, and Sander Levin, D-Mich., called the proposed
reduction ``at best a budgetary quick fix with harmful long-term
consequences.''
   ``It is at worst yet another shell game which will redistribute
the nation's wealth toward those already most well off,'' according
to a letter signed by Aaron and Summers.
   The letter also was signed by Joseph Minarik, executive director
of Congress' Joint Economic Committee; Alan Auerbach, chairman of
the economics department at the University of Pennsylvania;, and
Alan Blinder, head of the economics department at Priceton
University.
   Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 80 percent
of the benefits of the Jenkins-Archer reduction would go to those
with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   Dorgan, who opposes a cut, offered an alternative to reduce
benefits to those with incomes above $100,000 a year and eliminate
them for anybody making over $200,000.
   ``If we are going to offer a capital-gains exclusion, we should
offer it to those who need it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Military President Augusto Pinochet wept
Monday during his last state-of-the nation address but declared he
still is prepared to take power again if necessary.
   His 88-minute speech, broadcast on national radio and television,
marked the 16th anniversary of the coup he led on Sept. 11, 1973,
that left hundreds dead. He is scheduled to surrender power to an
elected civilian government next March.
   As he spoke, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to
scatter scores of demonstrators trying to enter Santiago's General
Cemetery to mourn the casualties of the anti-leftist repression that
followed the coup. There were no reports of arrests.
   But people were arrested during two anti-Pinochet demonstrations
in Vina del Mar and Iquique.
   The coup ousted the elected government of elected Marxist
President Salvador Allende, and Allende died during the final
assault on the presidential palace in central Santiago.
   As in past years, several thousand people gathered to honor
Allende at his grave in the Santa Ines Cemetery in Vina del Mar, 75
miles northwest of Santiago.
   Police did not interfere with the ceremony but fired water
cannons and tear gas to scatter demonstrators who tried to march
downtown. Witnesses saw several marchers detained but police gave no
report.
   Radio Cooperativa reported about 100 people were detained during
disturbances in Iquique, 1,100 miles north of Santiago. No other
information was available.
   There were conflicting reports about Allende's death. Some
supporters said he was killed by troops who broke into his office. A
government report said he committed suicide with a carbine that was
a gift from Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   Pinochet, a 73-year-old general who commands the army, said in
his address the armed forces will not allow a civilian government to
bring back ``the demagogic policies'' that he said brought the coup.
   Wearing his army uniform with the white, red and blue
presidential sash, he said economic progress under his
administration has placed Chile ``very close to the most advanced
nations.''
   Toward the end of his speech, with his voice breaking and his
eyes brimming with tears, he spoke of ``the unfair criticism'' he
has received and the attempt to kill him three years ago.
   ``In spite of all this, we would do it again if necessary, even
if we had to offer our own lives,'' he said.
   ``I love my motherland dearly, I love it more than I love my own
life,'' he added, weeping openly.
   Several thousand people lined Santiago's main boulevard to see
Pinochet ride in an open limousine for eight blocks from the
presidential palace to a government building to deliver his speech
in front of 3,000 government officials, military officers, diplomats
and special guests.
   Pinochet is to hand over the government on March 11 to a
successor to be elected in balloting set for Dec. 14.
   Pinochet called the election after an October 1988 referendum in
which voters rejected a military proposal to prolong his rule until
1997.
   Patricio Awlyin, 70, a former Senate president supported by a
coalition of 17 opposition parties, is favored to win the election.
   But Pinochet will retain a substantial amount of power. The
constitution, written by his administration, allows him to remain as
army commander until 1998 and he has said he intends to do so.
   He made clear the military will keep a close eye on the new
government.
   He said the armed forces ``will not allow that our national
identity be deformed again and our sovereignty be subject to alien
ideologies.''
   Speaking of the coup, he said, ``If we hadn't taken power, Chile
would have suffered the tragic consequences of a civilian war,
encouraged by the (Allende) government itself.'' And since the coup,
he said, ``I have faced the biggest enemy of humanity _ Leninist
Marxism.''
   He announced a 12 percent salary increase for all government
employees effective Dec. 1 and said they will receive a $20 bonus
this month on Chilean national day.

   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said Monday
that Congress can quell the fury that surrounds the abortion issue
on both sides by funding birth control research.
   ``If you had safe available family planning, the abortion issue
would almost be moot,'' Schroeder said in a speech to the Woman's
National Democratic Club.
   The nine-term congresswoman, who began her law career as counsel
to the Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood chapter, has introduced two
bills that would give a federal push to birth control and fertility
research and development.
   The legislation is co-sponsored by Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
   One bill is a resolution that ``expresses the sense of Congress
that the United States should make birth control and fertility
research, development and education a national priority'' by calling
for creation of population centers to do such research, she said.
   The other measure would amend the Public Health Service Act to
provide for the development and operation of three birth control
research centers and two fertility research centers, emphasizing
clinical study of new drugs and devices.
   The bill also contains a grant and loan repayment program
designed to attract scientists to work at the centers.
   It authorizes funds for five years for a total of $78 million.
   Schroeder assailed the Republican administrations of the last
nine years for working against family planning internationally.
   She pointed out that U.S. policy established by President Nixon
tied U.S. foreign aid to birth control programs in the applicant
country. But under President Reagan it was changed to oppose U.S.
involvement in family planning in other nations.
   ``In the last decade only Iran and the United States have been
marching backward on family planning,'' said Schroeder.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Monday that John
Poindexter is entitled to any documents that might show former
President Reagan and President Bush knew of the ex-national security
adviser's activities in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene directed Poindexter's attorneys
to explain to the court by next week how presidential and vice
presidential documents would corroborate his claims that Reagan and
Bush were aware of actions which later led to Poindexter's
indictment.
   ``Neither a president nor his papers are beyond the reach of the
law,'' Greene said.
   The judge ordered independent counsel Lawrence Walsh to file
court papers saying what responsibility, if any, he has to secure
presidential and vice presidential documents and turn them over to
Poindexter.
   Under indictment for allegedly covering up Oliver North's
assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras, Poindexter says he had no
motive to conceal North's and his own activities because Reagan
authorized them, leading Poindexter to believe they were legal.
   ``If these claims (of authorization by Reagan and knowledge by
Bush) are literally correct,'' said Greene, ``the documents which
would support them would be material to the preparation of
Poindexter's defense.''
   Poindexter ``worked directly for the former president ... met
with him on an almost daily basis; and the alleged violations
occurred while he was so employed,'' said the judge.
   Poindexter's lawyers have asserted that Reagan authorized
Poindexter's responses to congressional inquiries about North's
activities. Poindexter later was indicted for those responses, which
referred to letters written in 1985 by then-national security
adviser Robert McFarlane denying that the National Security Council
was supplying military advice or raising money for the Nicaraguan
Contras.
   McFarlane later pleaded guilty to withholding information from
Congress in connection with the letters.
   The judge said the court ``has a special obligation to act with
prudence and restraint'' in seeking documents, including personal
diaries and notes from the heads of the executive branch of
government.
   But he said that ``neither a president nor his papers are beyond
the reach of the law that requires the production or the giving of
evidence; and where a defendant in a criminal case needs that
evidence, this court will enforce his right to its production.''
   Greene noted that many of Reagan's records are in his personal
possession or with the National Archives and that access to them
might depend on the Presidential Records Act of 1978. The
independent counsel may not be responsible for producing documents
from a former president, noted the judge.

<TEXT>
   President Bush helped the Department of the
Treasury observe its bicentennial Monday with a speech emphasizing
its current part in the war on drugs, not its historical role in
forging the American banking system.
   Bush, addressing a sun-baked crowd of 1,000 Treasury workers and
others, paid tribute to ``the long, illustrious history of your
institution.''
   It was exactly 200 years ago that Alexander Hamilton took the
oath of office as the first treasury secretary, presiding over a
department with six employees.
   Today it has 150,000, most of them helping collect taxes, but
others engaged in tasks from the president's protective Secret
Service detail to customs agents to overseeing the nation's savings
and loans.
   ``Treasury has been in some ways the birthplace of the federal
bureaucracy,'' said Bush, noting that the U.S. Postal Service, the
Public Health Service, the Coast Guard, the departments of Interior,
Commerce and Labor as well as the Office of Management and Budget
all were once part of Treasury's domain.
   Bush used the address on the Treasury portico overlooking the
White House to declare that he does not contemplate using ``American
armed forces in any combat role'' in the Andean nations where the
United States is supporting government efforts to break the drug
cartels.
   The president said Treasury ``is making an outstanding
contribution to our nation's fight against drugs.''
   He said the Customs Service's capabilities of interdicting drugs
``have never been better,'' and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Fireams are ``on the front lines investigating the
violent gun-running organizations allied with the drug lords.''
   Bush said money laundering was ``another front in the battle,''
and he credited Treasury, the IRS and Customs with ``first-rate work
tracing the path of drug profits in the world's banking system.''
   He promised to ``track every lead that we receive from whatever
source to separate the drug barons from the drug money. ... We've
got to hit the drug lords where it counts. It's time to take the
profit out of the drug trade.''
   He also lauded Treasury's role in ``sustaining our long-running
economic expansion, restructuring our savings and loans'' and
helping solve the Third World's debt problems.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said his department has
responded to different challenges throughout its history, from
printing the first paper currency in 1862 to help Abraham Lincoln
pay for the Civil War to current efforts to find ways ``to preserve
our standard of living by encouraging savings and long-term
investment.''
   The event was held in blistering 91-degree heat that caused at
least one spectator to faint. Bush began his remarks by saying, ``I
notice one lady just passed out and I hadn't even begun to speak
yet.''
   To mark the occasion in a more monetary way, the Treasury put
more than $1 billion in currency, gold and silver bullion on display
in its Cash Room for visitors to gape at.

<HEAD>Ligachev Cleared of Corruption Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet prosecutor said Monday an investigation
has proved that corruption charges against Politburo member Yegor K.
Ligachev are untrue.
   The official news agency Tass quoted Deputy Prosecutor Vladimir
Kravtsev as saying the allegations that Ligachev accepted a bribe
were ``an attempted frame-up and an invention not supported by any
objective evidence.''
   The charges surfaced in May, when an investigator in the
prosecutor's office said in a televised debate among parliamentary
candidates that Ligachev's name came up in a probe of corruption in
the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.
   The investigator, Nikolai Ivanov, did not detail Ligachev's
involvement.
   The probe into the corruption charges against Ligachev has been
dropped, Kravtsev told Tass.
   According to Tass, former Uzbek Communist Party chief Inamzhon
Usmankhodzhayev initially claimed to have bribed Ligachev, ``but
later withdrew the testimony.''
   Usmankhodzhayev is under investigation in a sweeping corruption
probe involving high-level officials in Uzbekistan, Tass said.
   He named Ligachev under pressure from investigators and the
threat that his relatives would be arrested, Tass reported. Ivanov's
boss, investigator Telman Gdlyan, ordered Usmankhodzhayev to testify
that he bribed law enforcement officials and members of the party's
policy-making Central Committee, according to Tass.
   On May 15, Ligachev dismissed the accusations as slander and
provocation and asked for an investigation.
   Ivanov and Gdlyan have been pulled off the Uzbek case, which led
to the conviction of former President Leonid I. Brezhnev's
son-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, on corruption charges.
   Both investigators were elected to the new Soviet parliament, the
Congress of People's Deputies in spring balloting.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes Somalia's Army</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Somali army murdered at least 5,000 unarmed
civilians over an 11-month period, according to a report
commissioned by the State Department.
   The report, prepared by consultant Robert Gersony, described the
death-toll estimate as conservative.
   The victims were members of the Issak minority, a group accused
by the central government of aiding insurgents. The report said the
Issaks weren't in rebellion and didn't pose an immediate threat to
the government.
   The slayings, according to the report, began after attacks by the
rebel Somali National Movement on the towns of Burao and Hargeisa in
May 1988.
   ``The Somali armed forces conducted what appears to be a
systematic pattern of attacks against unarmed, civilian Issak
villages, watering points and grazing areas of northern Somalia,
killing many of their residents and forcing the survivors to flee
for safety to remote areas,'' the report said.
   ``Simulataneously, the Somali armed forces engaged in a pattern
of roundups, summary executions and massacres of many hundreds, if
not more, unarmed civilian Issaks.''
   Survivors fleeing toward sanctuary in Ethiopia were attacked by
Somali air and ground forces, and hundreds were killed, the report
said. Many civilians imprisoned on allegations of supporting the
rebels were beaten and choked, it said.
   Hundreds of thousands of Issak refugees reached Ethiopia in March.
   The report also accused rebel forces of killing civilians and
prisoners of war from late May to late August 1988.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday that the
report was based on extensive interviews. Atrocities were committed
by both the rebels and the military, but far more were attributed to
the Somali army, Boucher said.
   After the United States ``conveyed our concern to Somalia,'' more
than 300 political prisoners were released, he said. However,
Boucher added, the State Department is ``seriously disturbed'' by
``backsliding'' as the result of summer demonstrations in Mogadishu.
   The U.S. government has a defense agreement with Somalia mostly
for use of a naval base. As a result of Somalia's human rights
abuses, a $2.5 million U.S. military support program was suspended
in June 1988.
   A $20 million economic aid program, based on Somalia's conversion
to a market economy and resulting hardships, was suspended in July.

   The Soviet Union came to the defense of its
embattled ally East Germany on Monday by condemning what it called a
campaign to spur illegal East German emigration.
   The United States, Britain and West Germany welcomed the exodus
Monday of thousands of East Germans from Hungary through Austria to
new homes in West Germany.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
praised Hungary, which boldly opened its borders to the West in
defiance of a Warsaw Pact ally.
   ``We also commend Austria for its help and support and we admire
the efforts of (West Germany) to offer a home to fellow Germans
seeking freedom,'' Boucher said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass made the criticism in a commentary on
the historic exodus that followed the Hungarian government's
decision Sunday to allow all East Germans to leave for West Germany.
   ``A number of press bodies, television networks and radio of the
F.R.G. (Federal Republic of Germany) instigate G.D.R. (German
Democratic Republic) people to unlawful actions, while missions of
the Federal Republic abroad, in violation of generally recognized
norms of international law, assume protection of those persons and
supply them with West German documents,'' Tass said.
   Several hundred East Germans, seeking safe passage to the West,
are holed up in West Germany's embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   Tass said Western news outlets have been waging a ``tendentious
campaign'' based on the illegal departures of some East Germans.
   It was the first comment on the greatest flood of East German
refugees since 1961, the year the Berlin Wall halted the flow to the
West. State television, in its evening news broadcast ``Vremya,''
showed some of the refugees Monday.
   Tass said the campaign and ``propaganda hullabaloo'' were
conducted by those who have ``the absurd idea of `engulfing''' East
Germany.
   The commentary reiterated the Kremlin's loyalty to its East bloc
ally.
   East Germany ``is an inalienable part of the Warsaw Treaty'' and
``our true friend and ally,'' Tass said.
   Hungary's action marks the first time a Warsaw Pact country has
aided an exodus of refugees from an allied communist nation.
   Britain's foreign secretary, John Major, said Monday that the
thousands of East Germans left for the West because the government
failed to provide for its citizens' basic needs.
   ``The clearest conclusion we can draw from the backdrop of the
German refugees is the extent to which the East German government
has failed in the job it should have done over recent years to
provide a reasonable standard of living,'' said Major in an
interview with the Independent Television Network from Washington,
where he met with President Bush.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, during a speech in Bremen,
said that until East Germany adopts reforms, West Germany will be
seen as a Mecca for unhappy East German citizens.
   Klaus Bolling, former head of the West German mission to East
Germany, said there was a danger the situation was overheating. He
told ITN that urgent reforms were need in East Germany but that they
were unlikely since he could not see a ``German version of (Soviet
President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev.''
   Bolling was referring to the freer climate in the Soviet Union
under Gorbachev.
   ``I listened to a member of the Central Committee in East Berlin
a few weeks ago,'' Bolling said. ``He was saying, `Who could have
imagined that the Soviet Union would be the place where the
counterrevolution would start?'''

spending, subbing 5 grafs for 3rd graf pvs, About 30</HEAD>

   President Bush, trying to dispel fears about
the use of U.S. military forces in the war on drugs, said Monday
there is ``no contemplation'' of combat roles for U.S. servicemen
sent to Latin America.
   Bush made his declaration after White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater complained there are ``a lot of people who are
trying to portray this as another Vietnam situation or the beginning
of massive troop buildup and so forth.''
   At the Capitol, meanwhile, Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he will introduce legislation
increasing next year's anti-drug spending by $3.9 billion, paying
for it by cutting domestic and defense programs across the board by
0.575 percent.
   Byrd said his provision, to be proposed Tuesday, would bring
total federal spending on drug programs to $10.1 billion in fiscal
1990, which begins Oct. 1, $2.2 billion more than Bush has proposed.
   ``The president says, `Read my lips,''' said Byrd, whose panel
oversees about half of all federal spending. ``He says he won't
support any increase in taxes. So I have to do what I can do.''
   Bush has proposed paying for the increases he proposed last week
by trimming spending for several programs, not across the board.
   As for U.S. troops in the drug fight, about 30 servicemen have
arrived in Colombia to help train that nation's military forces in
using newly supplied U.S. military equipment. Bush said Colombia has
received 10 aircraft, five helicopters and an assortment of jeeps,
ambulances and armor.
   The advisers and equipment are part of a $65 million package that
Bush authorized last month for Colombia. The president announced
last Tuesday that an additional $261 million in security aid will go
to Colombia, Peru and Bolivia as the part of a five-year, $2 billion
program.
   While Bush tried to play down the role of U.S. forces in Latin
America, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the
military will provide protection to U.S. drug enforcement agents and
other law enforcement officials operating in such nations as
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said a secret directive signed
recently by Bush authorizes the military ``to be physically involved
with units in the field where we have been invited to have our law
enforcement people.''
   The senator said such protection is designed to prevent incidents
similar to the torture and murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique
Camarena, in Guadalajara, Mexico, in February 1985. ``We can't
afford another Camarena,'' said DeConcini.
   Fitzwater said he could not comment on the senator's remarks
although the spokesman confirmed that Bush had signed a secret
directive outlining the goals and limits of military involvement in
the drug fight.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. forces in Latin America do have the right
to defend themselves. He said that is standard policy for U.S.
troops anywhere in the world.
   ``They are there. There is a risk. Colombia is a very dangerous
place to be these days,'' Fitzwater said.
   In another development, Fitzwater threw cold water on a
suggestion by drug enforcement administrator John Lawn that the
administration is reconsidering whether to ban the sale of assault
weapons produced in the United States. The Bush administration has
curtailed importation of such weapons but has not taken any action
against those made in this country.
   ``We aren't aware of any reconsideration,'' Fitzwater said. ``By
that I mean there's none in the White House. ... I know the White
House position has been given to me by the highest authorities.
   The president, in a speech to Treasury Department officials, used
virtually the same language employed by Fitzwater in talking about
the role of U.S. servicemen.
   ``Let me state clearly,'' Bush said, ``none of the Andean nations
have asked for U.S. troops. And there is no contemplation of the use
of American armed forces in any combat role.
   ``No U.S. military personnel will accompany host-government
forces on actual field operations, the president added. ``Our
personnel will provide training, equipment and operational support
as we have been asked to do, and I will see that it works just
exactly that day.''
   Fitzwater refused to give details of the secret directive on the
drug war.
   Asked if the directive left the door open for the use of troops
under some conditions, Fitzwater said, ``I really can't go beyond
that it doesn't contemplate the use of troops. I think the
interpretation can fairly be made that it doesn't authorize troops,
either.
   During the day, Bush met with Britain's new foreign minister,
John Major. Afterward, Major told reporters that Britain has had a
team of experts in Bogota for the past few days to assess how London
can help the government of President Virgilio Barco fight drugs.
   Major said British officials have developed a package of training
and technical assistance. ``It'll certainly also deal with
protection of personnel,'' he said.
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said
that a multi-country drug interdiction program called Operation
Snowcap resumed over the weekend in Peru.
   Operations had been suspended since February because of security
concerns, but are resuming with the completion of a secure base in
Santa Lucia, he said.
   ``We have approximately 45 logistics personnel. I think these are
contractors basically. They maintain the equipment which supports
the Snowcap operations as well as about 14 U.S. enforcement
personnel advising Peruvian police in the Upper Huallaga Valley.''

<TEXT>
   The National Education Association unveiled
teaching guidelines Monday to help the nation's children appreciate
the plight of the 3 million homeless families forced to live out of
cars and in parks.
   ``Housing and Homelessness: A Teaching Guide'' is geared to
grades 4 through 12 with the goals of teaching children about
homelessness and the need for affordable housing, and changing
negative attitudes toward homeless people.
   Field trips to homeless shelters are encouraged in the guide, as
well as classroom discussions about substandard and overcrowded
housing and income levels of groups in a community.
   Teachers are asked to involve younger students in role playing by
giving them Monopoly money and then asking them to stretch the
meager wage to cover utilities, gasoline and rent.
   ``If this curriculum is well understood by the teacher and taught
in an open, questioning environment, it can afford the student the
opportunity to be educated and to act,'' said Carol Fennelly,
co-author of the publication.
   ``As with most Americans and as with most social issues, the
problems of poverty and housing are further burdened by a wide
variety of myths (such as) `people can make it if they want to' (or)
`there is enough housing for everyone if they just work hard enough
and save.'''
   Fennelly said the ``most positive means of dispelling myths is
with a clear and simple presentation of reality.''
   NEA's new president, Keith Geiger, estimated that more than half
a million children are homeless, including as many as 15,000 in the
nation's capital alone. An estimated 10 million live in substandard
housing and millions more live in cramped quarters.
   The curriculum was produced by Housing NOW, a national coalition
of homelesss and housing groups, with assistance from educators.
   Geiger said NEA's 1 million members are being encouraged to use
the curriculum, which has been distributed to state affiliates and
200 of the group's largest local affiliates.

<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association on Monday urged
President Bush to end the export of U.S.-made assault-style weapons
to Colombia, saying such a ban would not run afoul of the
Constitution.
   ABA President L. Stanley Chauvin Jr., in a letter to Bush,
responded to statements made recently by drug policy director
William Bennett that banning the manufacture of assault-style
weapons might be unconstitutional.
   ``Over the years, the American Bar Association has carefully
studied similar legislative proposals (to restrict handguns or
automatic weapons, for example) and concluded that legislation to
ban or restrict a specific class of weapons _ rather than all
weapons _ would not run afoul of the Second Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution,'' Chauvin said.
   ``The American Bar Association believes restrictions should be
placed on military assault weapons, whether made in the United
States or elsewhere,'' Chauvin said.
   Chauvin did not take a position on specific legislation pending
in Congress.
   But he urged Bush to ban the export of assault-style weapons to
Colombia, where 50 percent of sophisticated military equipment
seized from drug lords in the last 18 months was found to have been
made in the United States.
   Chauvin urged Bush ``to respond swiftly and affirmatively to the
urgent request of the Colombian government to end U.S. exportation
of military assault weapons to the drug cartels in that country.''
   ``Failing to take this step not only undermines the valiant
efforts of the Colombian leadership to preserve democracy and
justice _ indeed, civilized society _ in that country but
contributes dramatically to the death and destruction being
inflicted on our own citizens by these drug cartels,'' Chauvin said.
   Earlier this year, the Bush administration virtually banned the
importation of foreign-made assault-style weapons.
   Despite Bennett's comments last week, Drug Enforcement Agency
administrator John C. Lawn said Sunday that the administration is
reconsidering a proposal to ban those assault-style weapons produced
in this country.
   ``The first step was the banning of the weapons from other
countries,'' Lawn said during an appearance on CBS's ``Face the
Nation.''
   ``We must look now at our own procedures here in the United
States,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jewish Congress Asks Groups to Suspend Formal Contact With Catholics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 17-nation European Jewish Congress said Monday
it asked Jewish organizations worldwide to cease formal contact with
the Roman Catholic Church because of the dispute over a convent at
the Auschwitz death camp.
   ``At issue is the word of the church. It is difficult to speak
with someone when you have this kind of problem,'' said Theo Klein,
who led the French delegation to the two-day annual meeting.
   Klein, a former president of the European Jewish Congress, said
he has appealed to Jewish organizations to suspend official contacts
with the Catholic Church. He said there had been no dissent.
   ``Each organization is free to make its own policy, so I cannot
say to you that all organizations have stopped dialogue, but I think
so,'' said Klein, who helped negotiate a 1987 agreement with
Catholic representatives to remove the Carmelite convent.
   The meeting was dominated by the convent issue, which has split
Catholics and revived debates about lingering anti-Semitism in
Europe. Many Jews regard the convent at the camp _ where at least
2.5 million Jews were among the estimated 4 million victims during
World War II _ as offensive.
   Under the 1987 accord negotiated in Geneva between international
Jewish organizations, and a representative of the Polish Catholic
Church, Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, it was agreed the convent
should be removed by Feb. 22.
   But the Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, continues to back
the convent, which is in a hut where the Nazis stored gas used in
the mass murder of Jews. He has said the Geneva agreement was not
negotiated by ``competent people.''
   Two French cardinals and a Belgian cardinal who helped negotiate
the 1987 agreement have rejected Glemp's stance.
   Klein said he wrote to French Cardinal Albert Decourtray in July
announcing that all formal Jewish-Catholic contacts would cease
until the convent issue is resolved.
   Since then, Klein said, he has refused all invitations from
Catholic organizations, including a recent invitation to address a
French Catholic student body.
   ``The Catholics themselves understand it is very difficult to
have a dialogue now without having solved this problem of the
Carmelites,'' said Klein.
   Informal contacts will continue with the European Catholic
cardinals who want to stick to the agreement, Klein said.
   ``It seems to me that in the Vatican some people will try to find
a solution, but if it will be the boss, I don't know,'' said Klein,
referring to Pope John Paul II, who has not publicly expressed his
opinion on the issue.
   Lionel Kopelowitz, president of the European Jewish Congress,
said the meeting endorsed the suspension of formal contacts.
   In a resolution, the congress urged swift removal of the convent
and said it hoped ``that the hitherto fruitful Jewish-Catholic
dialogue, strongly affected by the situation ... will not suffer
lasting damage.''
   ``Auschwitz itself is holy ground,'' said Kopelowitz. ``It needs
no memorial of any sort to any faith ... it is soaked in the blood
of all those who died.''
   Glemp has canceled a U.S. visit scheduled to start on Sept. 21,
the Polish news agency, PAP, reported over the weekend.
   The announcement came after U.S. Jewish leaders said they planned
to sue Glemp for defamation, claiming he implied that Jewish
protesters sought to harm the nuns during a July 14 demonstration at
the camp.

<HEAD>GAO Report: May Be Impossible for Government to Collect Overdue Millions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government may have to write off much of
the $38 million owed by violators of federal mine reclamation laws,
the General Accounting Office said Monday.
   The money may not be collectable because many of the companies
that failed to restore mining sites and then failed to pay their
penalties ``are either bankrupt or no longer mining,'' said a report
by the investigating arm of Congress.
   About 99 percent of the money owed by penalized mining companies
was considered delinquent as of the end of the last fiscal year; 83
percent had been in the delinquent column for an entire year, the
report said.
   The government ``may never be able to achieve a high rate of
collection,'' the investigators concluded.
   The federal Office of Surface Mining has been criticized for
about five years by Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., and other members of
Congress for poorly tracking cases after imposing penalties. The GAO
said the agency had improved its procedures and has a better system
for collecting the money owed by mine law violators.

<HEAD>Sen. Byrd Proposes $3.9 Billion Increase for Drug Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee said Monday he will introduce legislation increasing next
year's anti-drug spending by $3.9 billion, paying for it by cutting
most domestic and defense programs.
   The proposal by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., would mark a concrete
response from Democrats who have said President Bush's own new
drug-fighting proposals are inadequate and underfunded.
   In particular, a number of Democratic leaders have said Bush's
$7.9 billion program would be difficult to finance without raising
taxes _ an option Bush has steadfastly rejected.
   ``The president says, `Read my lips,''' said Byrd, whose panel
oversees about half of all federal spending. ``He says he won't
support any increase in taxes. So I have to do what I can do.''
   His proposal would bring spending for federal drug initiatives to
$10.1 billion in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1 _ $2.2 billion
more than Bush has sought.
   Byrd not only topped the dollars Bush would spend, but said his
proposal of 0.575 percent across-the-board cuts to pay for the extra
spending was fairer than what the president proposed.
   Last Tuesday, Bush asked Congress to increase anti-drug efforts
by $717 million. He said he would pay for it by paring a handful of
programs, including immigration aid, rural development, housing and
a Defense Department radio system.
   ``The drug epidemic facing this country is a crisis that affects
us all,'' Byrd told reporters. ``In my view it is critical that we
look for solutions that will seek to spread not only the pain but
also the gain in a fair and evenhanded manner.''
   Byrd said 53 percent of the additional money would be spent on
law enforcement efforts, and 47 percent would be for education,
treatment and prevention programs.
   His proposed cuts would not effect Social Security or other
federal benefit programs.
   Bush has reacted to the quick Democratic criticism of his
proposals by dismissing it has partisan ``carping.''
   Democratic leaders have responded by accusing Bush of
recommending expensive programs _ the manned space mission to Mars
was another they cited _ while giving little indication how Congress
was supposed to find the money.

   Students who want to play football at Arlington
High School have to come up with $125, and would-be cheerleaders
need $80 to root for them.
   It's part of the price being paid these days for Massachusetts'
slipping economy, and no one is feeling it more than the kids.
   Some school districts have dropped after-school activities
entirely. Others reduced bus service. At the state's largest public
university, courses are eliminated, buildings are going unrepaired
and libraries can't buy books.
   ``Education in Massachusetts is among the best in the country,''
Franklyn Jenifer, state chancellor of higher education, said Monday
in an interview. With current fiscal problems, however, ``It is a
bad time for us all,'' he said.
   ``We must maintain stable and rational policies so that we do not
throw away the seed corn for when the good times come back,'' he
said.
   Great expectations for state tax revenue growth of 10.9 percent
for fiscal 1989 shriveled to 6.5 percent growth _ a difference of
$364 million.
   This year it's a similar story. The fiscal year that started July
1 was expected to see revenue growth of 7 percent; that's already
shrunk to 5.1 percent.
   Lack of money takes its toll.
   Some schools are charging fees for extracurricular activities for
the firs time. Springfield dropped such programs entirely.
   At the Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, youngsters are
charged $100 for each sport they play.
   Jim Dusenbery, director of student activities in the affluent
suburban district, said participation remains high although some
students are on a pay-later plan or getting financial aid.
   ``We were vehemently opposed at first, of course,'' Dusenbery
said. ``It's difficult to charge for math classes, but many schools
are charging for extracurricular activities.''
   He wasn't being facetious about charging for regular classes. His
district gave some thought to making students pay for such extra
courses as economics and accounting.
   ``Historically and traditionally, those things have been provided
for as part of a public school system. It's not a very positive
development,'' said Edward Melikian, spokesman for the state
Education Department.
   State budget cuts forced the cities of Springfield and Chicopee
to eliminate some bus routes.
   At the 26,000-student University of Massachusetts at Amherst, $31
million cut from a two-year budget of $193 million is leaving
buildings unmaintained and libraries out of pocket. By the end of
the school year 5,000 seats available in classes will be eliminated.
   Roland Sarti, chairman of the UMass History Department, said
1,500 students scrambled last week for the 300 class openings in
required history courses.
   Some students much attend for a fifth year just to take required
classes.
   ``The students aren't so much irate as just very depressed,''
Sarti said.

<HEAD>Report 161 Perished in Collision of Romanian Ship and Barge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 161 people perished when a
Romanian pleasure boat and a Bulgarian barge collided on the Danube
River, Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency reported Monday.
   Romania's official Agerpress provided only sketchy information a
day after the tragedy occurred Sunday on the Danube in Romanian
territory.
   State-run Tanjug in a dispatch from Bucharest said, ``The
Romanian ship, which was carrying 169 passengers and 10 crew
members, sank so fast that only 18 people managed to survive.''
   Tanjug said 161 people _ all Romanian citizens _ died after their
ship collided with a Bulgarian tug and barge towing iron ore from
the Soviet Union near Galati, 125 miles northeast of Bucharest, the
Romanian capital.
   Tanjug did not identify the sources for its information,
including the report that all the victims were Romanians. A British
newspaper, The Independent, quoted Danube shipping officials in
Vienna as saying Sunday that some victims ``were almost certainly
Western tourists.'' It said pleasure cruises on the Danube are one
of Romania's few sources of hard currency.
   It reported the tragedy received scant attention in communist
Romania's newspapers, with Romania Libera publishing only a brief
article on its last page.
   Diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria, said Bulgarian
reports also were sketchy with no clear information on the number of
casualties, the cause of the accident and other details.
   Agerpress, in a terse English-language dispatch monitored in
Vienna Sunday, said 182 people were aboard the Romanian ship. It
gave no possible reason for the collision but said the ship sank
``in conditions of poor visibility.''
   BTA also reported Sunday the Romanian vessel was carrying 182
people _ 169 passengers and a crew of 13. It said only, ``There are
casualties.'' It said there were no reports of casualties aboard the
tug or barge or give the number of crew members.
   It identified the Romanian vessel as the Mogosoaia and the
Bulgarian tug as the Peter Karaminchev.
   The Agerpress account indicated 151 people on the Romanian ship
had died. It said the ship had 169 passengers and a crew of 13 and
that 18 passengers were rescued. But it was not clear if the 13 crew
members survived or perished.
   The report seemed to imply that 18 passengers and 13 crew
survived, with 151 passengers missing.
   Agerpres said Monday that Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu had
appointed a a special commission to investigate the accident.
   An official statement carried by BTA said Bulgaria would ``render
assistance'' in the investigation.
   It reported Bulgaria's communist head of state, Todor Zhikov,
sent a message of condolence to Ceausescu.

   Northern sections of the West and Midwest got a taste of winter
Monday as snow fell in Colorado and North Dakota and low-temperature
records up to 100 years old were broken or tied in nine cities.
   Frost or freeze advisories were issued Monday night for much of
the Dakotas and Nebraska.
   In northern and eastern Texas, thunderstorms dumped 2} inches of
rain north of Abilene in just 90 minutes. Heavier rainfall in the
six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included 3.14 inches in Abilene,
Texas and 1.3 inches in Dallas.
   The storms produced gusts up to 35 mph in Waco and winds that
tore off tree limbs in Carlsbad, Texas. Hail as big as quarters fell
in Temple, Okla., and Jefferson County, Okla.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the lower
Mississippi Valley to the Tennessee Valley and the southern and
central Appalachians. Light showers fell in northern Minnesota, and
low clouds and drizzle covered the central Rockies and the central
High Plains.
   A large dome of high pressure anchored over southern
Saskatchewan, Canada, produced the cool weather Monday morning in
much of the northwest and north-central sections of the United
States.
   Light snow fell across higher elevations of the Front Range in
Colorado, including up to half an inch in Woodland Park, Colo. Snow
also fell in Minot, N.D.
   It was 26 degrees in Glasgow, Mont., 1 degree lower than the
record for Sept. 11 set in 1955, and 27 degrees in Casper, Wyo.,
where the old mark of 33 degrees was set in 1974.
   Low-temperature records were also set in Billings, Mont., (28
degrees, 32 in 1949); Valentine, Neb. (29, 30 in 1940); Pocatello,
Idaho, (31, 33 in 1916); and Goodland, Kan., (38, 40 in 1955).
Records were tied in Havre, Mont. (23 degrees, 1889); Great Falls
(29, 1921); and Rapid City, S.D. (29, 1921).
   By early afternoon, temperatures were only in the 40s and 50s
from the northern and central Rockies to the northern and central
Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   By contrast, the Atlantic Coast had another hot, sultry day. The
mercury climbed into the 90s from New Jersey to the southern coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees in Denver to 100 degrees in Beeville, Texas. The low in
lower 48 states Monday morning was 17 degrees in Livingston, Mont.,
and West Yellowstone, Mont.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from Florida to the southern and central Appalachians,
the Tennessee Valley, much of the lower and middle Mississippi
Valley, the northern half of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and eastern
Colorado; scattered showers from Illinois to the upper Great Lakes.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s and 70s across
much of the nation; the 50s from the upper Mississippi Valley to the
northern Plains, Nebraska, western Kansas and eastern sections of
Colorado and Wyoming; the 80s and 90s on the Pacific Coast and in
the southern Rockies, all of Texas except the Panhandle, the lower
Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee Valley and the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast; and between 100 degrees and 110 degrees in the
desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Israeli Soldiers Wound 19 Palestinians In Occupied Lands</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 19
Palestinians in clashes and a Cabinet minister blamed an escalation
in violence in the occupied territories on the United States'
dialogue with the PLO.
   A Palestinian man was found beaten to death in the occupied Gaza
Strip and Arab reports said he was slain as an alleged collaborator
with Israel.
   The death came a day after seven Palestinians were killed by
Israelis and an eighth by a fellow Arab in one of the bloodiest days
of the 21-month-old uprising against Israeli rule.
   At least 113 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs as
accused collaborators, prostitutes or drug dealers and another 567
have been killed by Israeli soldiers and civilians since the
uprising began in December 1987. Forty Israelis have died in the
violence.
   The Israeli minister, Avner Shaki, of the National Religious
Party, spoke at a funeral for an Israeli who was bludgeoned to death
last week, allegedly by an Arab man from the occupied West Bank.
   ``To our good friend the United States, your contacts with the
PLO, your regonition of the PLO and your continuing discussions with
the murderers encourages more bloodshed,'' said Shaki, a minister
without a portfolio. ``If you don't cease these talks, this blood
will be on your hands.''
   The U.S. began talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization
under Israeli protest in December after the Arab group renounced
terrorism.
   Meanwhile, a military governor in the disputed lands warned
Palestinians to diminish the violence or face the consequences.
   Speaking on Israel's state Arabic language television, Brig. Gen.
Sheike Erez, military governor of the West Bank, urged Palestinians
``to stop the deterioration, because they will pay for it in the
end.''
   In Monday's violence, Arab hospital officials said 19
Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers. The
most serious incident was a 17-year-old masked youth who was
critically wounded.
   Arab reports said he was writing graffiti on a wall when a police
agent leaped from a car, ordered him to halt then fired when he
tried to flee.
   The army confirmed that security forces had shot a masked youth
in Khan Yunis when he failed to halt. It also confirmed that three
other Arabs were wounded by soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Elsewhere in Israel, a military court in Lod sentenced two Arab
youths to 30 years in prison for infiltrating the Egyptian border
and trying to attack an army base earlier this year.
   In Jerusalem, a judge ordered a Palestinian held for 15 days on
suspicion of slaying the Jewish construction worker. The suspect is
also accused of stabbing a bus driver Saturday in an unsuccessful
attempt to force a passenger bus off the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway
and into a ravine.
   Police refused to identify the suspect except to say he was a
26-year-old man from the West Bank.
   In other violence Monday, the body of Rifaat Mahmoud Hasanain,
27, from Gaza City, was found in an orange grove. Arab reports said
he was accused of spying for Israeli authorities.
   The army confirmed the death but said Hasanain was killed over a
family dispute.

<HEAD>Report East German Leader Seriously Ill, Has No Will To Live</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German news media said
Monday that the health of East Germany leader Erich Honecker has
worsened and he has lost the will to live.
   Honecker, a hard-line communist, underwent gallbladder surgery
last month.
   The ZDF television network quoted Western diplomatic sources in
Hungary as saying Honecker's medical condition ``has deteriorated
considerably.''
   ``According to information that allegedly comes from Communist
Party officials, Honecker has no mental verve and no wish to get
better,'' ZDF said.
   The Hamburg-based newspaper Bild had a front-page headline saying
``Honecker Wants To Die.''
   Bild, citing unidentified sources in East Berlin, said: ``The
condition of the Communist leader has worsened badly'' and Honecker
``has lost the will to live.''
   The 77-year-old Honecker has resisted the reforms sweeping much
of the Soviet bloc and thousands of East Germans are fleeing their
country because of the political and economic situation.
   Thousands escaped Monday to West Germany after Hungary allowed
East Germans who had gathered in refugee camps to pass freely across
the border into Austria. East Germany bitterly denounced Hungary, a
fellow member of the Warsaw Pact.
   ZDF said of East Germany's ruling Communists, ``Critics in the
Politburo reportedly are charging that Honecker misjudged the
meaning and scope of the wave of refugees.''
   West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview that reports on Honecker's
condition are ``pure speculation. We have no first-hand information
on this.''
   Two weeks ago, Western intelligence sources said Honecker's
gallbladder surgery had to be abandoned because of the weakness of
surrounding tissue.
   Some news reports speculated that Honecker has cancer.
   East Germany's state news agency ADN said early this month that
Honecker had been released from the hospital and had taken a
vacation to recover. It has not carried any recent reports on his
condition.
   Communist Party sources in East Berlin, speaking on the condition
they not be identified, told AP over the weekend that there were
``clear signs'' Honecker's mental capacity was failing and his
condition had caused a delay in top-level decisions.
   Bild is published by the Springer concern, which has been a
critic of Honecker for decades.

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Expresses Approval of Eve of Formation of New Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament wound up four days of hearings
on nominees for a Solidarity-led government on the eve of Tuesday's
vote to install the first non-communist Cabinet in Poland in 40
years.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski expressed his ``greatest approval''
of the government-formation efforts as the Sejm, or lower house,
ended hearings Monday night by approving Marcin Swiecicki as the
proposed foreign trade minister and Wladyslaw Baka as national bank
chairman. He will not be a Cabinet member.
   Three nominees failed to win approval during the hearings, but
the opinions are not binding.
   The Solidarity government will face triple-digit inflation, a $39
billion foreign debt, a shortage of many basic commodities and a
work force demoralized by long lines for those scarce, poor quality
goods that are available.
   The outlines of its economic program emerged during weekend
hearings when Solidarity's Leszek Balcerowicz, nominated for finance
minister, recommended lower taxes on profits, coupled with
progressive income and value-added taxes; wage controls;
liberalization of foreign trade rules, and unification of the
government-set and free-market currency exchange rates.
   Solidarity lawmakers and communist deputies met separately Monday
afternoon. The Peasant Party, a Solidarity coalition partner, met to
discuss what the party considers an unsatisfactory choice for the
Agriculture Ministry.
   The Peasants prefer the incumbent agriculture minister over the
nominee, also from their party, who was rejected at a committee
hearing Friday.
   But Solidarity deputy Jacek Szymanderski said Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki would stand by his choice of Peasant Party
candidate Czeslaw Janicki.
   The state PAP news agency said Peasant Party Chairman Roman
Malinowski resigned on Monday at a meeting of the party's main board
and was replaced by Dominik Ludwiczak, a farmer and member of the
party presidium.
   Ludwiczak later told reporters that party members ``were not
happy with radical changes in our party.''
   He also said the party passed a resolution obliging Peasant
lawmakers to vote for the government proposed by Mazowiecki ``for
the good of the country.''
   Mazowiecki will outline his government's program at Tuesday's
session.
   Solidarity is to receive half the 24 seats on the Council of
Ministers, or Cabinet. The communists have four ministries, but keep
the strategic posts of defense and interior. The Peasants get four
posts, the Democratic Party three.
   Both Peasants and Democrats switched from long communist alliance
to a Solidarity-led parliament majority.
   The nominee for foreign minister is considered neutral.
   Jaruzelski, the communist president, ``reacted with greatest
approval in connection with the actions of Premier Tadeusz
Mazowiecki aiming at forming a government representing the forces of
a broad coalition,'' Jaruzelski spokesman Wlodizimierz Lozinski told
reporters Monday.
   He said Jaruzelski ``expressed hope this government will be able
to implement a program of socio-economic reforms adequate to the
needs of the nation and the state.''
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told a news conference in Gdansk
that having Communist Party members in the government may help
Poland.
   ``There are a lot of people there well prepared in political and
professional terms,'' PAP quoted Walesa as telling reporters. ``You
keep imagining (communists) with knives in their teeth. Communists
are not the problem in Poland ... The problem is the nonsense they
have introduced.''
   He said he does not believe the course of communist reforms can
be reversed, and Poland has a chance to lead other East bloc nations
while Poles are obliged to make most of the new opportunities.
   ``I don't believe that one can turn the course of events back.
You can pay for it more, you can do it longer, it can last longer,
but the direction of perestroika reforms must continue and must
achieve success,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Perestroika is Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's term for
the social and economic reforms he has initiated in the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to ADD quote, National Security meeting called.
Picks up graf 6 pvs, `Near Medellin ...'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gunmen on Monday assassinated a former
mayor of Medellin who crusaded to oust drug cartels from the city,
the cocaine center of Colombia and the focus of violence in the
country's drug war.
   Five or six attackers firing 9mm automatic pistols from two cars
killed Pablo Pelaez Gonzalez as he was being driven to the local
metal products factory he operated, police said.
   Pelaez's driver also was killed and a bodyguard was wounded, said
a police spokeswoman who refused to be identified.
   The killers fled, the police said. Radio reports said they were
dressed in black.
   Colombian television showed bullet holes in the front and rear
windshields of Pelaez's white BMW sedan. His personal papers were
scattered across the back seat.
   ``We are in total anguish over events in Medellin,'' said Helena
Herran de Montoya, the governor of Antioquia, where Medellin is.
   Ms. Montoya called a special meeting of the National Security
Council to debate anti-terrorist measures for the embattled city.
Medellin is already under a 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew and hundreds of
army soldiers and police patrol the city.
   Near Medellin, invaders Monday set fire to a farm owned by the
head of the government oil company. A similar attack Sunday targeted
the ranch of a government official who supports turning over drug
traffickers' property to the poor.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
called Pelaez's killing ``deplorable and reprehensible.''
   Pelaez, 45, a former police inspector, was elected mayor of
Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city, in 1984 on the Liberal
Party ticket, the party of President Virgilio Barco. He left office
in 1986.
   Pelaez founded a local group called ``Love for Medellin,'' aimed
at eliminating drugs and crime.
   Last week, the 4th Army Brigade in Medellin announced the arrests
of four suspected leaders of a cocaine-cartel ``hit squad'' that
sarcastically called itself ``Love for Medellin.''
   Barco and Colombia's drug lords have been at war since Aug. 18,
when narcotics gangs assassinated the police chief of Medellin and
Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the leading presidential candidate and a
cartel foe.
   The government retaliated by decreeing emergency powers, under
which it has summarily confiscated bank accounts, ranches,
airplanes, boats and cars believed to belong to fugitive drug
bosses. It extradited one reputed cartel member, Eduardo Martinez
Romero, to face trial in the United States.
   Martinez Romero was flown to Atlanta to face charges he was
involved in the laundering of millions of dollars of cocaine cash
for the Medellin cartel, believed responsible for 80 percent of the
cocaine reaching the United States. He pleaded innocent Monday and
was ordered jailed without bond.
   Drug gangs have responded to the government crackdown with daily
bombings, arson and shootings, mostly in Medellin.
   The arson attack Monday was on a ranch near Medellin belonging to
Andres Restrepo Londono, the head of the government oil company
ECOPETROL. The oil company said no one was injured.
   On Sunday, attackers killed a foreman and set fires on a ranch in
western Colombia belonging to the chief of the country's Agrarian
Reform Institute, Carlos Ossa Escobar. He advocates turning over
confiscated drug traffickers' ranches to Colombia's landless
peasants.
   Justice Minister Monica de Greiff, whose office handles
extraditions, returned to Colombia on Sunday night and met Monday
with President Barco, her office said. Mrs. de Grieff has been
threatened with death by cartel bosses.
   The U.S. Justice Department on Monday refused comment on news
that Colombia is planning to extradite three more accused drug
traffickers to the United States.
   Colombia's Drug Council said the three, apparently not among the
cartel leaders, are Ana Helena Rodriguez, 37; Bernardo Londono
Quintana, 47; and Alberto Orlandez Gamboa, 37.
   None is on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's list of the
12 alleged Colombian drug kingpins most wanted by the United States.

<HEAD>Ozal's Candidate Re-elected Parliament Speaker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A deputy from the governing Motherland
Party was re-elected speaker of Parliament on Monday in a vote seen
as a preview of the election of a president by the legislators in
November.
   Yildirim Akbulut, Premier Turgut Ozal's hand-picked candidate,
was elected on the third ballot. He got 250 votes in the 450-seat,
single-chamber Parliament where the Motherland Party holds 289 seats.
   Under the constitution, in the first two ballots a two-thirds
majority of 300 votes is needed to elect a speaker.
   On the third ballot the winner needs only a majority _ 226.
   Akbulut, 54, failed to get the required majority on the first two
ballots because four other candidates from the Motherland Party
divided the votes and he received no support from opposition parties.
   Three Motherland candidates withdrew after the first two ballots
leaving only Akbulut and Ilyas Aktas in the contest. Aktas received
173 votes.
   The Motherland deputies, including Aktas, said they entered the
race to show opposition to Ozal's deciding on Akbulut's candidacy
without consulting his party's parliamentary group.
   The same balloting procedure will be followed for November's
presidential election in which Ozal may be a candidate. The premier
has not announced his candidacy but has not denied news reports that
he may run.
   The opposition parties in Parliament, the Social Democrat
Populist Party and the conservative True Path Party, say Parliament
is no longer representative because the Motherland Party has lost
substantial support since the last general elections.
   In local elections in March, the Motherland Party won only 21.8
percent of the vote, finishing third after the two major opposition
parties.
   The next general elections are scheduled for 1992.
   Political analysts have said Ozal may use his party's
parliamentary majority to become president and cap his political
career rather than face possible defeat in 1992.
   Ozal told a news conference last week that Parliament would elect
a civilian president through its own free will.
   President Kenan Evren, a leader of the former military junta,
will retire at the end of his seven-year term as president.
   The armed forces have for decades taken an active part in
selecting the president and six of the last seven presidents have
been former military men.
   Akbulut, a lawyer, was elected to Parliament in 1983 and became
speaker in 1987. The speaker of Parliament becomes acting president
in the absence or illness of the president. He can call Parliament
back from recess.

   A California real estate agent testified
Monday that PTL founder Jim Bakker sold a luxury home the month he
resigned from the television ministry at a loss of at least $85,000.
   Outside court, Bakker's wife, Tammy, appeared on the ``Phil
Donahue Show,'' saying they never intended to misuse contributions
to PTL.
   Emma Howard, a real estate agent from Palm Springs, Calif., said
Bakker bought the Palm Desert home in 1984 for $450,000 and sold it
in March 1987 for $385,000.
   ``They lost at least $65,000 on the sales price plus closing
costs and real estate commission,'' she said. ``That added up to at
least $85,000.''
   Ms. Howard was one of several witnesses called to testify at
Bakker's federal fraud and conspiracy trial about the Bakkers'
spending habits.
   Ms. Howard said she helped Bakker buy a $600,000 furnished home
in Palm Springs in February 1987. She said he sold it in August 1987
for the same price, losing a $36,000 real estate commission, $5,000
for a new roof and closing costs of $3,000.
   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and
faces 120 years and prison and more than $5 million in fines.
Prosecutors say he used nearly $4 million in ministry funds to
finance a lavish lifestyle.
   Others testified about renovations and decorating projects for
the Bakkers' home at Tega Cay, S.C., including Randy Utsey of
Kitchens Unlimited in Charlotte, who said he did $43,155 worth of
remodeling and PTL paid the bill.
   Builder and developer Haines Maxwell testified he did three major
projects: a $25,592 garage and atrium addition, a $140,000
renovation of the kitchen and dining room, and added a 15-by-18-foot
closet to the master bedroom and a bedroom for the Bakker's son,
Jamie, at a cost of $92,278. He said he was never paid for the
bedroom work, but the rest was paid by PTL.
   ``The Bakkers had a tendency to grow very bored with what they
had,'' former PTL decorator James Taggart testified later. ``It was
not unusual to see something completely replaced more than once.''
   Taggart and his brother, David, were sentenced last week to
prison and fined $500,000 each, convicted of evading taxes on nearly
$1 million in PTL funds, including cash advances on ministry credit
cards. James Taggart was sentenced to more than 17 years in prison
and David to more than 18 years.
   James Taggart used enlarged photos of the Bakkers' homes to show
the jury how the Bakkers lived. The pictures included the Tega Cay
parsonage, a Florida condominium and the presidential suite at the
Heritage Grand Hotel.
   Taggart described the extensive use of mirrors and marble in the
Bakkers' condo in Highland Beach, Fla. Every room had mirrors,
including curved mirrors in the master bedroom and blue beveled-edge
mirrors in the foyer.
   ``Mr. Bakker's favorite color is blue,'' he testified. Later, he
said, ``Here we are, still in the master bedroom. Here's a
custom-made silk moire bed. This view is directly into the ocean.''
   Taggart said he used a special hoist to bring seamless, 25-foot
cornices into the condo. He also installed $40,000 in draperies,
bedspreads and headboards. Master bedroom draperies could be opened
and closed with a switch.
   Taggart decorated the condo for Christmas 1982 with a Christmas
tree that cost $5,000 and featured hand-blown glass ornaments.
   At the lakefront parsonage, Mrs. Bakker had a 25-by-25-foot
closet. A hot tub was installed at the parsonage, where earlier
testimony showed the swimming pool was always heated to 90 degrees.
   Taggart said the five-level parsonage underwent extensive
redecorating. The master bedroom was changed completely at least
twice and the living room was redone three times, he said, including
a complete change of the brick on the fireplace.
   Mrs. Bakker told television host Phil Donahue that accusations
about her husband weren't true.
   ``We know inside we are not guilty,'' she said in the interview
recorded Friday and broadcast Monday. ``If I was guilty, I'd hide my
head, but when you're not guilty you're not guilty.''
   Mrs. Bakker said PTL simply outgrew its founders.
   ``It got to where it didn't even feel a part of us,'' she said.
``We almost couldn't catch up with it. ... I felt like a little girl
who didn't know where she was supposed to be.''
   If contributions intended for the ministry were misused, it was
never by intent, she said.
   ``The wonderful thing about God is he says you give and it shall
be given to you. I thought that was what was happening,'' she said.
``I thought it was coming to us as a result of honoring his word.''
   Mrs. Bakker said she was sorry if anyone was hurt and vowed to
make amends if they someday get another chance.
   She said she might have become insensitive to others when money
flooded the ministry.
   ``There are times when you almost forget that $100 extra to spend
to some people is all they have to spend,'' she said. ``I could go
spend $100. I really forgot that some women can't do that.''
   Other testimony about the Bakkers' spending habits came from
jeweler Ernest Perry of Charlotte, who said Bakker once bought a
raw, 12-carat diamond for $22,000.
   Perry said Bakker told him the diamond would be ``a good
investment for his retirement.''
   Carolyn Smith, of the Jerry Tuttle Insurance agency in Charlotte,
testified the Bakker's homeowners policy valued their personal
property at $134,000 for the period June 1, 1986, through June 1,
1987. The policy covered such things as a $45,000 diamond ring, a
$27,000 diamond ring, a $29,000 diamond bracelet, and the premium
was paid by PTL.
   Ms. Smith said the Bakker's also insured successively larger
boats: an 18-footer in 1978 valued at $8,600, a 19-footer in 1984
valued at $10,000, and a 22-footer valued at $29,000 in 1986.

   A group of 16 Americans headed Monday for a
small desert island in the South Pacific where two retired military
airmen believe Amelia Earhart died of thirst after her plane crashed
52 years ago.
   ``We wouldn't be going if we didn't think there was something
there,'' said Richard Gillespie, president of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery in Wilmington, Del.
   The expedition was spurred by research conducted by two Fort
Walton Beach, Fla., men _ Tom Willi, a former Navy pilot, and Tom
Gannon, a retired Air Force navigator.
   Willi and Gannon studied aircraft navigation of the 1930s to plot
a probable course followed by Earhart. Their research pointed toward
Nikumaroro Island, about 1,000 miles east of Fiji.
   Gannon and Willi accompanied the group to Fiji but will remain in
Suva to handle communications with the expedition to Nikumaroro,
also known as Gardner.
   The expedition's archaeologist, Thomas King, said the group hopes
to find traces of the fuselage of Earhart's Lockheed Electra plane
and its two steel engines.
   Earhart set off from Papua New Guinea on a journey that began in
Oakland, Calif. Her disappearance July 3, 1937, made headlines
around the world. President Franklin Roosevelt authorized a search
for the plane but nothing was found.
   The American flier was 6,820 miles short of her goal of flying
around the world when she and navigator Fred Noonan vanished. Her
stopover destination en route to Hawaii was Howland Island, about
500 miles north of Nikumaroro.
   Gillespie said that in the three days after Earhart's last
message was received, 24 radio communications were picked up at
various locations. Gillespie said they were on Earhart's frequency
and in a female voice. When plotted, these radio communications
crossed with Nikumaroro, he said.
   The U.S. Navy flew over the supposedly uninhabited island during
the 1937 search, and one of the pilots reported clear signs of
recent human habitation, Gillespie said, but no landing was ever
made.
   ``It was the most likely alternative destination for Earhart yet
no one ever really searched it,'' he said.
   Gillespie's group of 16 aviation historians, archaeologists,
divers, sonar experts and photographers chartered a converted
Japanese trawler, Pacific Nomad, for their search. They expect to
reach the island this weekend.
   Numerous theories about Earhart's disappearance have been made,
including speculation she was a U.S. spy or that she was captured by
the Japanese and executed.
   Another explanation is that she simply ran out of fuel and
crashed while trying to locate Howland, a tiny speck of land in the
South Pacific.

<HEAD>Aquino Wishes Marcos a Happy Birthday _ Somewhere Else</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino on Monday
wished her exiled predecessor Ferdinand Marcos a happy birthday _ as
long as he spends it outside of the Philippines.
   ``As a Christian, I pray that God will give him his blessings
from this day,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters on Marcos' 72nd
birthday. ``I am holding fast to what I believe is for the national
interest, and that is not to allow Marcos and his family to return
at this time.''
   Mrs. Aquino has cited national security for refusing to allow
Marcos to return from Hawaii, where he has lived since his ouster in
a civilian-military uprising in February 1986.
   Marcos has been hospitalized in Honolulu since January with
heart, kidney, liver and lung ailments and is reported in critical
condition.
   Nearly 1,000 Marcos supporters held a peaceful rally Monday to
mark the ex-president's birthday.
   His followers published a full-page advertisement Monday in the
nationally circulated Philippine Daily Inquirer extending birthday
greetings and calling for his return ``in the interest of true
national reconciliation.''
   Also on Monday, airports in Manila and Cebu were alerted to
prevent a Marcos supporter, who also is related to Mrs. Aquino, from
slipping back into the country from the United States.
   Bienvenido Alano, acting commissioner of immigration and
deportation, said the alert was ordered because of reports that
businessman Eduardo Cojuangco might enter the country.
   ``We have information that Mr. Cojuangco has a plan to return,''
Alano said in a radio interview. ``So I alerted immigration officers
in Manila airport and in Cebu because the report is he will come in
via Cebu. In any case, when we find out that he came in, we will
detain him at the airport.''
   Cojuangco, a first cousin of Mrs. Aquino, fled the country
shortly before Marcos was ousted and has been living in Santa
Monica, Calif. He has been linked to previous attempts to topple the
Aquino administration.
   In another development, the official in charge of recovering
Marcos' alleged ``hidden wealth'' said his agency will need an
increase of more than $500,000 in its budget to continue the search.
   The government claims Marcos and his backers embezzled up to $10
billion during the 20 years that Marcos ruled.
   Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, asked the House Appropriations Committee to increase his
budget from $950,000 to $1.5 million for 1990.
   Caparas also said the commission needs more than $2 million to
pay American lawyers representing the Philippines in civil suits
pending against Marcos in U.S. courts.
   The government has said that so far it has recovered about $133
million in cash and the money has been turned over to the land
reform program.

   An advance mission for the U.N. team
that will supervise demobilization of Nicaraguan rebels met on
Monday with President Jose Azcona Hoyo and other officials to
prepare for visits to camps near the border.
   A peace agreement signed on Aug. 7 by Central American countries,
including Honduras, calls for disbanding and disarming the rebels,
known as Contras, and relocating them in Nicaragua or third
countries. The United Nations and Organization of American States
were asked to oversee the effort.
   About 11,000 Contras and 12,000 dependents are in Honduran camps.
   Gen. Pericles Ferreira of Brazil, who heads the 16-member
mission, said its task is to lay the groundwork for future U.N.
envoys and establish contact with all governments and organizations
involved in the regional peace process.
   The mission plans to visit camps of the Contras and Nicaraguan
and Salvadoran refugees in southeastern and southwestern Honduras on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The government estimates more than 40,000 Nicaraguans and 35,000
Salvadorans who fled wars in their countries over the past 10 years
are in U.N.-sponsored camps.
   The delegation arrived after visits to Costa Rica and Guatemala
and will travel to El Salvador and Nicaragua.

   A Nigerian toddler who must be fed through tubes
because of an intestinal disease will leave the hospital center
where she has lived since her birth nearly three years ago, her
doctors and nurses said Monday.
   Ogechi Anyanwu, wearing a ruffled pink dress with matching socks
and sneakers, waved and smiled to reporters and called frequently
for her pacifier at a news conference.
   ``Her progress has been excellent and her prognosis for leading a
normal life is terrific,'' said Dr. David Dudgeon, Ogechi's
pediatric surgeon at Johns Hopkins Children's Center.
   Ogechi will move to a hospital in Columbia, Mo., where her
parents, who are from Nigeria, plan to live.
   When she was born prematurely in October 1986, Ogechi weighed a
little more than 2 pounds. Within 10 days, she developed neonatal
necrotizing enterocolitis, which kills bowel tissue and causes short
gut syndrome.
   The condition, which strikes one premature baby in 100, spread
rapidly and doctors had to remove 80 percent of her small intestine
and 50 percent of her colon.
   Without a normal intestine, which absorbs nutrients, Ogechi
cannot eat solid food. She has been intravenously almost
continuously since birth.
   Wherever she goes, she is trailed by a machine holding three
plastic bags of nutrients and several tubes.
   She's fed by two pumps that deliver a mixture of fats, proteins
and sugars intravenously and by another pump connected to a tube to
her stomach. The child gets 80 percent of her calories through the
stomach tube.
   She suffers diarrhea and frequent infections. Ogechi must take
antibiotics regularly, and has undergone surgery more than a dozen
times for repairs to her intestinal tract and insertion of
intravenous lines.
   Despite her ailment, Ogechi has developed normally, doctors said.
She weighs a robust 35 pounds, walks and rides a tricycle for
exercise and has a relatively advanced vocabulary.
   ``How many 3-year-olds do you know who know how to say
`stethoscope?''' asked Dudgeon.
   ``She is full of joy, love, very rambunctious and very giving,''
said nurse Maura Mahon, who cared for Ogechi her first year.
   ``Aside from the fact that normal 3-year-olds don't get their
temperatures taken every four hours around the clock, we try to give
her as normal a life as possible,'' said nurse Mary Kay Alford, who
has cared for Ogechi the past year and will escort her to University
Hospital in Columbia.
   Ogechi's parents, Longinus and Edith Anyanwu, recently moved to
Columbia. Her father teaches computer science at Columbia College.
   Doctors expect the youngster to be released from the Missouri
hospital within several months.
   Her intestines recently doubled in length and have widened, which
will soon allow her to eat food normally, Dudgeon said.
   ``I expect that within a matter of months she will be eating
solid food, although she might have to stay away from real spicy
pizza,'' he said.

   Norway's Lapps won a 100-year struggle for
limited self-rule, but few of these Arctic reindeer herders used
their chance to vote on Monday for Lappland's first national
assembly.
   In a 1987 law, Norway granted this once-nomadic people the right
to elect an assembly to represent their minority interests, but with
no mandate to enact legislation.
   ``The Sami have finally won political rights as a people. It has
all happened so fast. I wouldn't have believed it possible, even a
few years ago,'' said Hans Guttorm, a Sami candidate. The Lapps
prefer to be called Sami.
   But of the estimated 24,000 Lapps eligible in Norway, less than
5,500 registered to vote in the election for an assembly, held in
conjuction with national elections in which they also vote.
   Those who did marched to the polls under their own flag in
brightly colored woven costumes trimmed with reindeer leather.
   The Lapps were electing 39 representatives to the assembly,
called the Sameting. It will convene Oct. 9 in Karasjok in the
northern Finnmark province.
   Analysts said the low turnout showed that many Lapps,
traditionally hunters, fishermen and herdsmen, have lost their roots.
   ``There is a certain skepticism, especially among older Sami,''
said Peder Andersen, 72, a pioneer Lapp activist told the news
agency NTB. He said the assembly needs time to prove itself.
   ``The Sameting won't fix everything that was wrong. My hope is
that it just makes things a little better for the new generation.''
   The Lapps are scattered through the Scandinavian and Soviet
Arctic. Their ancient culture was nearly destroyed by active
policies of assimilation. About two-thirds of all Sami live in
Norway, the Foreign Ministry says.
   Until the 1950s, Lappish, a language related to Finnish, was
forbidden in schools, churches and government. Many Sami stopped
speaking it to their children.
   Lapps once had to assume Norwegian names if they wanted to own
property. Sami culture was severely represeed.
   An 1890s education document said, ``The Sami have no other route
to a higher level of culture than through the Norwegian language and
culture.''
   Norwegianization was successful. An 1888 census showed that 88
percent of the residents of Kvaenangen in northern Norway called
themselves Lapps. By 1950, none admitted being Sami. There were no
mass migrations or major epidemics during the 62 years.
   A Sami consciousness movement began growing in the 1950s. Pride
of their ethnic heritage spread to the Scandinavian peoples who
governed them.
   Norway now encourages Sami culture. This autumn the country's
first Sami university opened. Sami cultural, artistic and media
institutions have also been formed with government support.
   On Monday with the assembly vote, some Lapps said they finally
felt like equals to Norwegians.
   Mainstream national parties put up candidates for the Sameting
but the Sami National Union was projected to win a clear majority.
Ballots must be collected from isolated villages, delaying the
count. Results were not expected until Wednesday.
   Election platforms mainly concerned ways to used the new powers
to influence Norway's parliament and local governments on Sami
issues.
   ``We Sami are one people and national boundaries will not break
our people's union. We have our own history, our own culture and our
own language ... which we intend to pass to coming generations,''
declared one election platform.

   The Immigration Department on Monday
ordered that an American with the AIDS virus be granted a visa so
that he can compete in the Bermuda Bowl world contract bridge
championship in Perth.
   Australia's consulate in San Francisco had refused to issue a
visa to Peter Pender of San Francisco on grounds he had tested
positive for the AIDS virus even though he did not have symptons of
the fatal disease.
   The action by the Immigration Department means the United States
will have its full complement of players when the semifinals of the
bridge championahip begin next Monday.
   The United States won the world team title in 1985. As the North
American champion the team qualified for the semifinals.
   AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ is a disease in
which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.

   The FBI on Monday joined the
investigation of a riot at a paper mill by hundreds of pro-union
demonstrators, and six people were charged in the violence,
authorities said.
   Union leaders condemned Saturday's riot over BE&amp;K Construction's
use of non-union labor on the $535 million expansion of Boise
Cascade Corp.'s mill, but said violence could break out again.
   ``People will do anything when their livelihood is threatened,''
said Joint Labor Council President Bob Walls.
   About 400 people set fire to vacant trailers, overturned cars and
hurled rocks. Law enforcement officers used tear gas to break up the
crowd, and arrested 31 people. Five people were injured, and damage
was estimated at $1.3 million.
   Tires have been slashed and windows have been broken since
Saturday, but otherwise this Canadian border town of 6,500 people _
more widely known for its cold-weather claim to be ``Icebox of the
Nation'' _ has been quiet, officials said Monday.
   About 500 non-union workers returned to work on the expansion
Monday, the second day of work on the expansion project since the
violence. Two or three people picketed but there were no incidents,
said Boise Cascade spokesman Andrew Drysdale.
   An FBI agent arrived in International Falls because some rioters
crossed state lines to get to the Boise Cascade site; Two of the six
charged Monday are from Michigan; the others from Minnesota, said
Koochiching County Attorney Dave Johnson.
   The charges included riot, criminal damage to property, arson,
trespassing and assault, Johnson said. They appeared before county
District Judge Peter Hemsted, who set the maximum bail for each
case, ranging from $13,000 to $30,000.
   All six remained in the county jail, along with 18 others who
will be charged Tuesday, Johnson said.
   Four International Falls residents arrested Saturday have been
released on their own recognizance and are expected to be charged
later, he said. Three cases involving lesser charges are being
handled by the city attorney's office. Those people have also been
released.
   Police in various municipalities have identified five or six more
people from videotapes police made Saturday, and those people are
expected to be charged and arrested, Johnson said.
   Authorities may send a copy of the tape to police in Iron
Mountain, Mich., where one busload of demonstrators is believed to
have originated, said Police Chief Tom Hardy.
   ``We want to send a message that it will cost them dearly to do
this type of thing here,'' he said.
   Officials earlier said 32 people were arrested, but revised that
figure to 31.
   The mill, which employs about 800 union workers and 150 salaried
workers, is beefing up security, Drysdale said.
   ``Given the governor's delayed reaction, we will take the steps
necessary to protect the property and our people,'' he said.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich put 275 National Guardsmen on alert, but did
not send the Guard into International Falls. His decision not to
send in the Guard was criticized Monday by company officials and
political foes.

   Agreements to return the skeletal remains of
American Indians and to renovate a museum in New York City are
helping push plans to create a National Museum of the American
Indian here closer to realization.
   Reps. Charles Rangel and Ted Weiss, both New York Democrats, met
last week with Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, and all agreed that the Smithsonian would renovate the
current museum, in upper Manhattan, to create an exhibition space,
spokesmen said Monday.
   ``We have agreed to renovate 2,000 square feet to bring it up to
certain security, safety and basic standards of museum exhibitry,''
said Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs.
   In a related matter, Adams, Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
D-Colo., and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, on Tuesday were to
announce an agreement between the Smithsonian and American Indian
groups on the return on skeletal remains in the museum's possession.
   The issue could have been another obstacle to passing Indian
museum legislation but Jacobs said that problem has been resolved.
   ``There's kind of a realization that's dawning that the spiritual
needs of the living Indian people, as well as their spiritual
traditions, have to be considered, and not secondarily to
archaeological pursuits,'' said Carolyn Light, a spokeswoman for
Campbell.
   The Smithsonian has a collection of the bones of approximately
18,000 Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts, most of which were unearthed
during archaeological excavations, construction or erosion. About
4,000 of the specimens came from the Army Medical Museum, and were
transferred to the Smithsonian at the turn of the century.
   The New York congressmen had been unhappy with a plan to move the
current Museum of the American Indian from Audubon Terrace to the
old U.S. Custom House in lower Manhattan and transfer the bulk of
the collection to a new museum to be built on the Mall in
Washington. They were displeased that the agreement reached in May
did not guarantee a continued presence at Audubon Terrace.
   According to language drafted last week, the Smithsonian will
lend artifacts and exhibitions to a successor museum at Audubon
Terrace, and provide training, technical assistance and other
support to the facility.
   Adams has estimated it would take about five years to build the
new museum in Washington, once Congress passes legislation
authorizing and funding it.

   The former director of the Miss America
Pageant was hospitalized in critical condition Monday after
suffering a heart attack, just days before this year's pageant,
officials said.
   Albert A. Marks Jr., 76, arrived at the emergency room of Shore
Memorial Hospital at 11:46 a.m., said hospital spokeswoman Margie
Barham.
   ``He is in the intensive care unit,'' she said Monday afternoon.
``I can't give a prognosis.''
   Marks retired in 1988 after directing the pageant for 35 years
and handing over his duties to Atlantic City attorney Leonard Horn.
   However, he has not completely left the pageant. He sat in a seat
of honor near Horn at last year's final night production.
   ``I am very saddened and very worried,'' Horn said Monday
afternoon. ``I love Al Marks. I love him dearly, and I'm obviously
very concerned.''
   Even after retirement, Marks was accorded much respect for
leading the pageant through rough times. He defended the pageant
when it faced criticisms from the women's liberation movement, the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, labor
organizations and a segment of the public that considers Miss
America an outdated symbol.
   Marks, a Margate resident, was also the man who fired Bert Parks,
replacing him first with actor Ron Ely and then with the current
host, Gary Collins.
   In the 1960s, Marks was the first to suggest dropping the
controversial swimsuit competition. He was overruled by state
pageant directors and fans. Horn has since tried to downplay the
significance of the swimsuit contest by lowering its value in the
judging.
   He also handled hordes of reporters when nude photographs of Miss
America 1984 Vanessa Williams appeared in a men's magazine.
   When not directing the pageant, Marks was an investment broker at
Advest Inc.'s Atlantic City office.
   ``Of course, the pageant will go on,'' Horn said of this week's
preliminaries and the finals Saturday night. ``Al, above all, would
understand that.''

<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan read
newspapers Monday as he continued his recovery from skull surgery
and spoke by telephone with the chairman-designate of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, a spokesman said.
   Doctors have not decided when to release the 78-year-old former
president from St. Marys Hospital, where he underwent surgery Friday
to remove fluid that had accumulated on the surface of his brain.
   But ``physicians managing President Reagan's care are hopeful
that if the present rate of progress continues, President Reagan
will be able to return to California at the end of the week,''
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said in a statement issued by the
Mayo Clinic, which runs St. Marys.
   Reagan's doctors report that he continues to make excellent
recovery, Weinberg said.
   In addition to reading newspapers, Reagan watched morning
television news programs and attended to routine office paper work,
Weinberg said.
   ``Shortly after noon, President Reagan spoke with General Colin
Powell, chairman-designate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who
telephoned over the weekend to extend his good wishes. After lunch
with Mrs. Reagan, President Reagan plans to speak with former
Secretary of State George Schultz, who also called to wish President
Reagan well,'' Weinberg said.
   On Friday, surgeons drilled a hole in Reagan's skull to remove a
buildup of blood. Doctors said the problem stemmed from a July 4
incident in which Reagan fell from a bucking horse and hit his head.
The fluid was detected during a routine physical examination.
   Reagan's neurosurgeon told The New York Times on Sunday that a
brain clot had been detected earlier but that it healed on its own
without surgery.
   Neurosurgeon Thoralf M. Sundt told the Times that the first clot
was smaller and in a different area of Reagan's brain than was
operated on Friday. Because of the first clot, brain tests were
included as part of a regular checkup at the Mayo Clinic, Sundt said.
   Reagan has spoken several times by phone with his son, Ron, and
has been looking at the hundreds of cards and messages he has
received, Weinberg said in Monday's statement.
   On Sunday, Reagan walked unassisted outside his room, watched
football on television, wrote letters and posed wearing a Minnesota
Twins cap for a Mayo Clinic photographer.
   Nancy Reagan is staying in a room across the hall from the former
president and will stay until her husband is released, Weinberg
said. They are in a section of St. Marys separate from other
patients' rooms and kept under guard.
   ``They have meals together and watch the news together,'' the
spokesman said Sunday.
   ``He's normal in every respect,'' Weinberg said, adding Reagan
was not in any pain. ``To talk with him you wouldn't know he has had
surgery at all.''

   The commander of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of
Cuba was found dead at his home, a possible suicide, more than 28
years after the failed mission that haunted him, police and friends
said Monday.
   Jose Alfredo Perez San Roman, 58, led the 1,500-man brigade of
Cuban exiles in the abortive assault on their island homeland in
April 1961. They were defeated by troops loyal to the communist
government of Fidel Castro, who had seized power in 1959 after
dictator Fulgencio Batista fled amid guerrilla fighting.
   San Roman and more than 1,000 of his followers were imprisoned
nearly two years.
   San Roman, whose body was discovered at 9:20 a.m. Sunday at his
mobile home, spent much of his own imprisonment in solitary
confinement.
   He reportedly had a history of depression in the years that
followed.
   Police were considering the death a suicide, pending the results
of an autopsy. ``A note was found on the scene and will be compared
with Mr. Roman's handwriting,'' said Metro-Dade police spokesman
George Reyes.
   Col. Ramon J. Ferrer-Mena, San Roman's chief of staff at the Bay
of Pigs, said his commander took the defeat personally and didn't
accept the mission's failure, even as it collapsed around the small
exile invasion force.
   ``By the middle of the invasion, I was convinced that everything
went wrong,'' Ferrer-Mena said Monday. ``But he never accepted that
_ even when we were in the swamps.''
   ``He took it quite personally,'' said Ferrer-Mena. ``He felt
responsible for every man who died there and every widow and child
left without a father.''
   Robert Kennedy, then U.S. attorney general, said San Roman told
him after his repatriation from Cuba that ten times as many troops
would have been needed to succeed.
   Failure of the invasion plan has been attributed to limited
support from the U.S. government and almost no air support.
   Veterans of Brigade 2506, the exile military detachment that
landed on the central southern Cuban beaches, still meet in Miami
and discuss what might have been.
   The invasion cost almost 100 lives and the more than 1,000
prisoners were held until December 1962 when they were freed in
exchange for food and medicine.
   Col. Humberto Olivera, another veteran of the Bay of Pigs,
described San Roman as a hero in the exile community.
   ``During his trial, he behaved as a commander,'' said Olivera.
``He never said `no'' and he was a man who faced a firing squad and
never turned his back on his principles. He was a brilliant man.''
   Olivera said San Roman was an honor student and graduate of
Managua Military Academy, the Cuban equivalent of the U.S. Military
Academy. He also was one of the youngest captains of the Cuban army,
Olivera said.
   During the final days of the Batista regime, San Roman opposed
Batista and was put in jail, said Olivera. Later, he saw the new
Cuban goverment was communist and joined the exile opposition.
   ``He was the man who led the invasion. He refused to leave the
beach when he had a chance,'' Olivera said Monday. ``He said the
famous words: `We came here to fight.' ''

   A sheriff's deputy, testifying at a
hearing for Ramon Salcido on Monday, fought back tears Monday when
identifying a photograph of the former winery worker's young
daughters found with their throats slashed.
   Salcido is accused of killing seven people in a killing spree
April 14.
   Sonoma County Sheriff's Deputy Mike McManus spoke haltingly as he
described finding the bodies of Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1, lying near
their sister, Carmina, 3, who survived the attack.
   McManus, the first officer to arrive at the county dump where the
girls' bodies were discovered, testified in the opening day of a
preliminary hearing for Salcido.
   Salcido is accused of killing his wife, two daughters, his
mother-in-law and her two daughters, and a co-worker during the
rampage; he also is accused of attempting to murder Carmina, another
co-worker and the co-worker's wife.
   Sonoma County Judge Knoel Owen denied a defense motion to
continue the hearing for 30 days to assure the appearance of two
U.S. drug agents who help captured Salcido in his native Mexico five
days after the rampage.
   Salcido told the agents he killed his wife and a co-worker in a
jealous rage believing they were romantically involved, federal
officials have said.
   Salcido's defense attorney, Marteen Miller, has accused Mexican
authorities of coercing a confession. He said it would take 30 days
for authorities in Washington, D.C., to ensure the agents'
appearance.
   Owen said he would reconsider Miller's motion if at the end of
preliminary hearing the agents had not testified.
   Dr. William Vogel, an administrator with the California Forensic
Medical Group who examined Salcido in custody, testifed that he
found no physical evidence of torture.
   Also testifying was Richard Waller, a criminalist with the
California Department of Justice Laboratory, who said that blood
found on the body of Salcido's mother-in-law and her 12-year-old
daughter appears to be Salcido's.
   The finding, based on tests of genetic markers in blood, also
linked a sample found on a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol to
Salcido, said Waller.
   Salcido, 28, who has pleaded innocent to the charges, sat quietly
throughout the hearing.
   After Monday's session, Assistant District Attorney Peter Bumerts
called the physical evidence in the case ``as conclusive as it
gets.''
   ``I don't think this is a who-done-it, and I don't think (Miller)
has ever indicated it would be,'' said Bumerts.
   The hearing is expected to last two weeks, and then the judge
will decide whether enough evidence exists to hold Salcido over for
trial.
   On Aug. 31, Owen ordered the prosecutor to turn over to the
defense all information about Salcido's arrest. Authorities also
must cooperate in the release of details surrounding Salcido's
arrest in Mexico, Owen said.
   Salcido allegedly confessed voluntarily to the slayings to
Mexican authorities before being turned over to Sonoma County
deputies.
   Miller, in asking for release of arrest information, argued that
any challenge to that confession will have to go into the original
arrest in Mexico, not just the arrest by the Sonoma County Sheriff's
Department during a flight from Mexico City to Santa Rosa.
   Miller also hinted that Salcido may been right in suspecting his
wife of infidelity, but Miller refused to reveal any evidence to
support his claim.

   Mayor Coleman Young kept out of sight Monday and
left the last minute campaigning to his challengers in the city's
mayoral primary as he seeks a record fifth term.
   Young is expected to lead the field of 13 candidates in Tuesday's
non-partisan election. He made no campaign appearances Monday and
has voted by absentee ballot.
   Neck-and-neck for the No. 2 spot are U.S. Rep. John Conyers, a
late entry in the race, and accountant Tom Barrow, whom Young
defeated in 1985. All three are Democrats.
   The top two finishers advance to the Nov. 7 runoff.
   Election officials expect about a third of the city's 507,000
registered voters to cast ballots, a turnout that favors Young.
   ``Generally, the bigger the turnout the better for an incumbent.
But he's the exception,'' Deputy City Clerk Jeff Blaine said of
Young. ``I figure the first 50,000 people out (to vote) are his. We
know he's going to get his people out.''
   Young, 71, the city's first black mayor, was first elected in
1973.
   Conyers, 60, picked up the endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson
over the weekend, backing he called priceless to his campaign. The
40-year-old Barrow has gathered endorsements from a few city unions
and church leaders; the bulk having committed to Young.
   On Monday, Conyers greeted workers at a Ford Motor Co. assembly
plant in Wixom, 40 miles from the heart of downtown, while Barrow
campaigned at the downtown campus of Wayne State University and at a
``Save Our Neighborhoods'' rally at Freedom Baptist Church.
   Meanwhile, long-shot Charles Costa, a local businessman, shook
hands on a Detroit street corner and knocked on neighborhood doors.
City Council President Erma Henderson, also a dark horse, attended
meetings with groups endorsing her including a United Auto Workers
local.
   On Sunday, thousands of Young's supporters gathered for a
downtown rally.
   A poll released Sunday showed the mayor with more than twice the
support of any of his challengers.
   Young was backed by 42 percent of Detroit voters surveyed by
WJBK-TV and Wayne State's Center for Urban Studies.
   The poll, with a 4.7 percent margin of error, found Conyers with
14 percent and Barrow at 12 percent. Of the 427 registered city
voters contacted, 25 percent were undecided. The telephone survey
was conducted Friday and Saturday.
   Two weeks ago, a similar poll found Young's support at 38
percent, Conyers at 12 percent and Barrow at 9 percent.
   The National Weather Service predicted cloudy skies Tuesday with
the chance of rain late in the day at less than 20 percent.
   ``In Detroit, most people vote on the way to work or on the way
home,'' Blaine said. ``We're looking for turnout in the low 30s
(percent of registered voters), which unfortunately is halfway
decent for a primary around here. The absentee numbers are pretty
good that we've seen.''
   Twenty-three percent of registered voters turned out for the last
mayoral primary in 1985, Blaine said.

   Two domestic Boeing 737s made emergency
landings at Amazon jungle airports in the eight days since a Varig
airliner got lost and crashed in the rain forest, according to
reports Monday.
   Three passengers suffered minor injuries when a Varig plane
carrying 42 people made an emergency landing Monday at the Porto
Velho airport in the western Amazon, according to Globo television.
   The jetliner, on a regularly scheduled run from Porto Velho to
Manaus, was forced to turn back shortly after takeoff when the
craft's wingflaps failed to operate properly, said Globo, the
nation's largest private network.
   Varig would neither confirm nor deny the reports.
   Earlier, the company said in a statement a plane on a regular
flight from Rio Branco to Cuiaba, also in the western Amazon, made
an emergency landing Sunday when it developed trouble in the right
engine's oil filter.
   The pilot was forced to make an emergency landing in the city of
Vilhena, Varig said. The 56 passengers and six crew members were
unhurt and spent the night in the city while the plane was repaired,
the airline said.
   On Sept. 3, another Boeing 737 belonging to Varig went off course
and crashed in the Amazon jungle near Sao Jose do Xingu, about 1,100
miles from its intended destination of Belem at the mouth of the
Amazon River. Twelve of the 54 people aboard were killed.
   Passengers later said the pilot, Cesar Garcez, was listening to a
soccer match during the flight. Garcez denied the accusation.

   Arrangements have been made to pick up the remains in Hanoi and

   A Tunisian minister urged the Bush
administration Monday to grant a visa to Yasser Arafat so the
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization could address the
U.N. General Assembly.
   But a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said Arafat
had not applied. Last week, Arafat told a Saudi Arabian newspaper he
planned to attend the U.N. session which opens in two weeks.
   In a meeting with reporters, Habib Boulares, the Tunisian
minister of culture and information, said issuing a visa should not
be a problem. ``We consider he has the right to go to the U.N.,''
Boulares said.
   The Tunisian said he did not think the Bush administration would
want to see the United Nations shift its deliberations to Geneva in
order to hear Arafat.
   He referred to the transfer to the Swiss city of a special
session on the Palestinian issue after the Reagan administration
denied Arafat a visa for New York last year. Subsequently, the
administration concluded Arafat had renounced terrorism and opened a
dialogue with the PLO.
   It is being held in Tunisia, where the PLO maintains its
headquarters. The talks have not helped to break a stalemate in
addressing the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   But Boulares said the dialogue should go on. ``When people talk
together they can find a good way to solve pending problems,'' he
said.
   On another subject, Boulares urged the Bush administration and
the World Bank to ease Tunisia's $5 billion debt burden by
stretching out repayment of loans and lowering interest rates.
   He said the North African country had undertaken political
reforms that included abolition of forced labor and restricting
pre-trial custody.
   Boulares said a drought and infestation of locusts contributed to
Tunisia's difficulties.
   He is in the United States in connection with an exhibition of
mosaics to be exhibited on Thursday in Los Angeles.

   A government official
said 12 bodies were recovered and only nine survivors were reported
Monday from a boat carrying 70 illegal emigrants that capsized last
week.
   Civil Defense Director Eugenio Cabral said the Dominican Navy
discontinued its search for further victims Monday night.
   The Civil Defense said the boat set set sail from the Dominican
Republic's east coast and capsized on Sept. 5 three miles off
Higuey, 145 miles east of Santo Domingo, the capital.
   Scores of Dominican illegals try to reach Puerto Rico each week
through the Mona Passage, which separates the Dominican Republic
from Puerto Rico.
   An anonymous source in Higuey said Monday that four bodies were
recovered Sunday night and were buried at once in the beach because
of their advanced state of decomposition.
   The nine known survivors were treated in Higuey Hospital for
dehydration, exposure and bruises.

   President Hosni Mubarak and Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat met Monday to discuss
plans for peace in the Middle East.
   Neither leader talked to reporters following the talks.
   Arafat arrived in Cairo early Monday. It was not clear how long
he would stay in Egypt.
   Last week, Mubarak met with Arafat during a brief visit to
Tunisia and said the Palestinian leader would travel to Cairo for
talks on Egyptian ideas for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   Egypt is the only Arab country on speaking terms with Israel. The
two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979.
   On Saturday, Mubarak told reporters that Palestinian leaders had
offered no objections to his supplement to an Israeli peace plan,
but still were considering their final position.
   Mubarak's 10-point initiative was sent to Israel in July and
Jerusalem over the weekend offered tentative support for the
measures.
   The initiative seeks to clarify Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's plan for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
to choose representatives to negotiate limited autonomy for the
territories.
   The 10 points include acceptance by Israel of the U.S.-backed
concept of trading land for peace, participation in the vote by the
140,000 Palestinians in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem and an end to
building Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
   In Israel, newspapers said three prominent Palestinians from the
occupied territories were traveling to Cairo this week to urge
Arafat to allow Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza to hold peace
talks with Israel.

   The Bush administration has decided to hold
refugee admissions to the United States to 125,000 in the next
fiscal year, an increase of slightly less than 8 percent from this
year, a congressional source said Monday night.
   The figure would include slots for 50,000 from the Soviet Union,
no change from this year's allocation. The current Soviet figure is
almost double what it was during the start of the current fiscal
year last Oct. 1.
   But the administration, with congressional support in both
parties, has decided it cannot handle any more refugees from the
Soviet Union, according to several recent reports and the source.
   Israel has also expressed concern that Jewish refugees from the
Soviet Union were increasingly choosing to head for the United
States once out of their homeland, depriving the Jewish state of
needed settlers.
   The congressional source, affiliated with the immigration
subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, ``The issue is
not the numbers but the backlog.'' He estimated there are 20,000
Soviet emigres in Rome and Vienna awaiting U.S. decisions on their
eligibility to enter the United States.
   Under a revision of regulations ordered last year by Attorney
General Ed Meese, each person applying must prove individual
eligibility for refugee status, which means government aid in
resettlement and admission outside the normal immigration rules.
Previously, Jews from the Soviet Union were automatically considered
refugees.
   The new decision has made the backlog grow faster than it can be
processed.
   Overall, this year's refugee quota, arrived at by the
administration each year in consultation with the House and Senate
judiciary committees, is 116,000 persons, up from 94,000 at the
start of the fiscal year.
   The 125,000 figure for next year would include 10,000 whose
resettlement would be paid for by private organizations.
   ``To take more people, we'd have to find more money, and in the
current budget situation, that would mean robbing Peter to pay Paul,
doing things like taking money from famine relief in Africa. Nobody
wants to do that,'' the source said.
   Administration representatives, scheduled to make a formal
presentation to the subcommittee on Friday, gave informal briefings
to staff members on Monday.

   Crammed into sputtering sedans and
cheering their new freedom, thousands of East Germans reached the
West on Monday in a historic exodus permitted by the reform-minded
communist government in Hungary.
   Hungarian officials said 16,000 more East Germans had arrived in
Hungary by way of Czechoslovakia. It was not known how many of them
might be joining the exodus West.
   The West German newspaper Die Welt reported Tuesday that about
10,000 East Germans may have crossed into the West on Monday on the
first day of the westward trek.
   Jubilant East Germans rushed to telephones to tell relatives back
home they'd finally made it to West Germany.
   Bavarian officials got ready for further waves of East German
emigres en route from Hungary.
   Border officials in Austria said more than 5,700 refugees crossed
into their country with hours of daylight left. Officials of a West
German charity running the refugee camps in Budapest said the last
bus left Monday afternoon, leaving the camps empty. About 7,000 East
Germans had been registered there.
   A Hungarian Interior Ministry official said 26,000 of the
estimated 60,000 East Germans in Hungary _ most of them vacationers
_ had returned home Monday, but about 16,000 others had arrived in
Hungary via Czechoslovakia.
   ``I decided on escaping 27 years ago, and today it worked. It's a
feeling that's just tops, just wild,'' said a 40-year-old Leipzig
man after crossing into West Germany at Passau.
   Single people, couples and families with children and babies made
the journey from Hungary to West Germany _ by bus, rickety sedans or
motorcycle.
   ``We did not really plan to come here, but when we heard about
the opening of the (Hungarian-Austrian) border, we decided this was
a chance,'' said 20-year-old Volkmar Windt, who crossed into West
Germany on a small East German-made motorcycle along with his twin
sister, Katrin.
   Many refugees were cheering and shouting as they reached Bavaria
under the blaze of television lights, while their children played
with teddy bears handed out by relief workers. Couples kissed in
their cars.
   Some tumbled out of compact cars packed with people and flashed
victory signs after crossing into West Germany.
   It was the greatest flood of East German refugees since 1961, the
year the Berlin Wall halted the flow to the West.
   Hungary's action marks the first time a Warsaw Pact country has
aided an exodus of refugees from an allied communist nation. East
German leaders expressed outrage at the Hungarian government, and
state news media accused it of ``organized smuggling of humans.''
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass condemned Western media
for what it called a ``tendentious campaign'' to spur illegal East
German emigration. Tass also said that foreign West German
diplomatic missions illegally protect East German refugees and
supply them with West German documents.
   Several hundred East Germans, seeking safe passage to the West,
are now holed up in West Germany's embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   It was not known how long the exodus of East Germans out of
Hungary would last. News reports said the East Germans might
restrict travel to Hungary in retaliation, but the government denied
the reports.
   ``I have this feeling that I have missed the last train to the
West,'' a worried student in East Berlin told The Associated Press.
Other East Berliners interviewed Monday, all speaking on condition
of anonymity, expressed the same fear.
   The exodus came after weeks of talks between the two Germanys
failed. On Sunday, the Hungarian government formally announced it
would allow all East Germans to leave for West Germany.
   It was not clear how many East Germans would emigrate.
   East German refugees arriving in West Germany said their journey
fulfilled their dreams.
   ``For us there is only the future and it will be good,'' said a
middle-age East German husband and father of two children, who would
not give his name.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, during a speech in Bremen, said that
until East Germany adopts reforms, West Germany will be seen as a
mecca for unhappy East German citizens.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said the United States welcomed the Hungarian action.
   ``We also commend Austria for its help and support and we admire
the efforts of the Federal Republic to offer a home to fellow
Germans seeking freedom,'' he said.
   After crossing into the West, the refugees lined up to register
with West German charities and border authorities.
   As parents stretched, filled out forms or cupped hands around
containers of coffee handed out by volunteers, their children lined
up in the morning mist for the teddy bears, picture books and other
donated playthings.
   But most arriving Monday opted to drive on to relatives in cities
as far away as Hamburg, more than 350 miles from the border.
   About 6,000 East Germans had already fled to the West this summer
through Hungary, which with Poland is gradually liberalizing while
neighboring East bloc governments are resisting the freer climate
fostered by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In Yugoslavia, about 100 Romanians who have fled from their
Communist country gathered Monday at a U.N. office in Belgrade,
applying to be resettled in the West.
   As the migration took place, West German news media reported that
East German leader Erich Honecker, who supervised the Berlin Wall's
construction, was in failing health.
   The ZDF television network quoted Western diplomatic sources in
Hungary as saying Honecker's medical condition ``has deteriorated
considerably.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told
hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis at a rally on Monday that she
will provide more police to counter ethnic violence in southern
Sindh province, her home province.
   Journalists estimated at 500,000 the crowd who turned out at a
rally supporting her Pakistan People's Party to commemorate the
anniversary of the death in 1948 of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, founder of
Pakistan. Organizers said the crowd exceeded 1 million.
   Hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis joined flag-waving
processions and political rallies around the country for the
anniversary.
   In Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, throngs of peasants jammed
streets and chanted ``Long live democracy'' and ``Long live Bhutto.''
   It was Ms. Bhutto's first public rally in Karachi since she
became government leader last December.
   ``The government has decided to provide more police forces and
more equipment to counter the ... situation in Karachi in particular
and Sindh (province) in general,'' she told a cheering crowd in the
shadow of the mausoleum where Jinnah lies.
   Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands injured since
1986 in clashes in Sindh between native Sindhis and Moslem
immigrants from India, called mohajirs.
   Authorities there complain that the past decade also has seen
rising heroin trade, robbery and kidnappings.
   The People's Party colors of red, black and green fluttered from
light poles lining the boulevards of the sprawling seaport.
   Posters bearing images of Jinnah, Ms. Bhutto and her late father,
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, appeared throughout the city.
   In Lahore, provincial capital of Punjab, the colors were the
green and white of her political opposition, a nine-party
conservative grouping called the Islamic Democratic Alliance.
   No reports were made of political violence in Monday's
observances.

   The Soviet Union could be enveloped in strikes
that would bring down Mikhail Gorbachev unless the Soviet president
achieves domestic progress soon, Boris N. Yeltsin said Monday.
   Gorbachev has ``not more than one year and probably about six
months,'' the Soviet deputy told a television interviewer. If
Gorbachev fails, ``then we're going to have some very difficult
times. And this is something I want to discuss with the American
administration.''
   Yeltsin, 58, a maverick ousted as Moscow's Communist Party chief
in 1987 but then elected to parliament with overwhelming popular
support in a contested election, arrived Saturday for a two-week
U.S. tour during which he hoped to see President Bush.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``At this
point no decision has been made'' on whether Bush will meet with
Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin will meet in Washington with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, on Tuesday afternoon, to discuss ``the process of change
in the Soviet Union,'' said Richard Boucher, a State Department
spokesman.
   ``The unfolding of this process is something that will be
determined within the Soviet Union,'' Boucher said. ``We are
interested observers, more than anything else.''
   Yeltsin spoke on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program, and
later made a visit to a temple of capitalism, the New York Stock
Exchange. He also spoke to the Council on Foreign Relations, at a
lunch closed to the press.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
asserted that Yeltsin's views were his own and not necessarily the
government's. He said deputies visiting the ubited States ``are all
unofficial delegations.''
   ``If you want the official point of view, listen to the Foreign
Ministry,'' he said. ``If you want pluralism, listen to the
deputies.''
   Yeltsin, in his TV appearance, said Gorbachev could face
``revolution from below.''
   He added: ``This has already started in the form of strikes, but
today just occasional strikes, hot spots here and there in the
country. A revolution would occur when these hot spots spread and
the whole country is affected.''
   Early in the interview, Yeltsin gestured with the middle finger
of his hand. Later the interviewer, Charles Gibson, explained that
it had not been what Americans might interpret as an obscene gesture.
   Yeltsin was injured by a hand grenade when he was 11 and
``because he is missing two fingers, that's the only way he can
point,'' said Gibson.
   At the stock exchange, Yeltsin chatted for about half an hour
with the chairman, John J. Phelan Jr., then got a tour of the
trading floor.
   Yeltsin's visit was being organized by the Esalen Institute
Soviet-American Exchange Program. He is receiving $25,000 per
speech, which will pay for the trip and contribute to AIDS research
in the Soviet Union.
   At Columbia University later Monday, Yeltsin did not discount the
chances of a second political party gaining power in the Soviet
Union in the future.
   ``But our country is not ready,'' he told a audience of about
700. ``It has trouble supporting a single party as it is.''
   He told the group that Soviet people should ``throw off our false
pride and take a lot from the American experience'' of running a
country.
   If the Soviet Union is to solve its economic and social problems,
the Politburo needs to be revamped, Yeltsin said.
   ``We have so many odious and incompetent people in the
Politburo,'' he said. ``All they do is raise questions and never
answer them. They are hanging on to their positions with dear life.
We need to catapult them out like they do with ejection seats. But
the question is who is willing to push the button?''

<HEAD>Coast Guard Arrests Seven Danish Crewmen In Cocaine Seizure</HEAD>

   The Coast Guard intercepted a freighter in the
Bahamas, found 15 bales of cocaine bobbing alongside the ship and
arrested seven Danish crewmen, according to a federal affidavit
filed Monday.
   Authorities seized 1,100 pounds of cocaine in the capture Sunday
of the freighter Nerma north of the Berry Islands, about 40 miles
northwest of Nassau, officials said.
   The Coast Guard also seized three speedboats found near the ship.
Speedboats are often used to carry cocaine shipments from ship to
shore.
   The Nerma was detected on radar Saturday, according to the
affidavit filed in U.S. District Court by Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Robert Rowland.
   A cutter was sent to intercept the ship, which is registered in
Vanuatu, a South Pacific archipelago nation between Fiji and New
Caldedonia.
   Coast Guardsmen boarded the Nerma after seeing the bales of
cocaine, each weighing about 70 pounds, floating alongside, the
affidavit said. Each bale consisted of smaller plastic packages of
cocaine arranged so they would float together.
   After the cutter escorted the Nerma to Miami Beach, another bale
was found aboard the freighter, the affidavit said.
   The seven men arrested were identified as Bent Nissen, 55; Carl
Jensen, 55; Jans Madsen, 63; Bent Mortensen, 47; Carsten Pederson,
32; Brian Rasmussen, 31; and Martin Rasmussen, 41.
   They appeared Monday before U.S. Magistrate William C. Turnoff,
and were ordered held without bond in pretrial detention.
   Authorities said it was unusual for Danes to be arrested in drug
cases in the area.
   ``At first I couldn't find a Danish interpreter,'' said the head
of federal court interpreters for Miami, Irene King-Tomassini. She
said a friend suggested the Berlitz language school, ``and they put
me on to an employee of a cruise ship line who spoke the language.''
   During the hearing, Turnoff asked Assistant U.S. Attorney William
Jung about the ship's registry.
   ``I have been told that its flag is the nation of Vanuatu,'' Jung
replied. I understand that's north of the Australian coast.''
   Asked if he could elaborate, Jung said, ``That's all I can tell
you. My geography in that area is limited to McHale's Navy.''

   Norwegians on Monday dealt the governing
Labor Party its worst election setback since World War II but Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland indicated she would fight to stay on.
   That would force the opposition to try to oust her in a
no-confidence vote when the new Parliament convenes Oct. 2.
   With 99.7 percent of the ballots counted, official results showed
both Labor and its main rival, the Conservative Party, losing
support they won in the 1985 elections.
   The results showed Labor with 885,291 votes received 34.4
percent, a loss of 6.4 percent from four years ago. The
Conservatives had 565,901 votes and 22.1 percent for an 8.3 percent
loss.
   Major gainers were the rightist Progress Party with 331,944 votes
for 13 percent, which was 9.2 percent more than in the last
election, and the Socialist Left with 257,579 votes _ 10.1 percent
of the ballots and a 4.6 percent improvement.
   Smaller parties showed modest gains or losses.
   Labor was hurt by record unemployment and widespread discontent
with public services, but remains the largest party in this country
of 4.2 million people. Norway has been under welfare state policies
for 40 years.
   Clear weather encouraged a good turnout of the 3.2 million
eligible voters.
   Non-socialist parties, which retained a combined majority, said
they would try to smooth over differences to form a coalition.
Bargaining could take weeks.
   Mrs. Brundtland has governed with a parliamentary minority for
the last three years and said the situation was unchanged, implying
she could continue in office.
   Many disenchanted voters switched loyalties to the Socialist
Left, which supports Labor, leaving the socialist bloc with minor
losses.
   The Socialist Left campaigned on a strong environmental platform,
but it also opposes Norway's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Final seat results may not be known until Wednesday because of a
new election system that adds eight posts to the old 157-member
Storting, or parliament.
   Norway's free-spending days came to an abrupt end with the il
price crash of 1986, when its North Sea wealth evaporated.
   Mrs. Brundtland said she was concerned over Labor's losses but
that it still ``looks like we'll have a parliament that isn't bad as
a whole.''
   Labor was projected to win 64 seats of the 165 seats. Its
socialist ally would add 16. The three-party non-socialist alliance
_ Conservatives, Christian Democrats and Center Party _ would get 61
seats. The unpredictable, right-wing Party of Progress would have
20, with small parties and independents getting a total of four
seats.
   ``The tendency is clearly toward a non-socialist majority. That
means there will be negotiations for an alternative government,''
said Wenche Frogn Sellaeg, deputy chairman of the Conservatives,
Norway's second largest party.
   The key lies with Carl I. Hagen, leader of the Party of Progress,
an anti-tax party.
   Hagen, who held the balance between blocs in the previous
legislature, toppled the last non-socialist government in 1986 over
a proposed tax increase, allowing Mrs. Brundtland to take over with
a minority Cabinet.
   The opposition would need to overcome deep divisions on such key
policies as taxation and farm subsidies to form a coalition.
   ``We have always stretched out our hand to be part of a
coalition,'' Hagen said, but the three other parties ``have rejected
us.''
   The Progress Party has been excluded from alliances because it
challenges the basic principles of Norway's social democracy.
   The Conservatives, led by Jan P. Syse, would remain second to
Labor.
   Asked by a reporter if he was going to be next prime minister,
Syse drew a laugh from supporters by replying, ``We always work
toward the highest possible goals.''
   Labor has governed Norway for 34 of the past 44 years and
fashioned a welfare society. Taxes on income range up to 62.7
percent. The government runs powerful companies like Statoil, which
exploits North Sea oil fields.
   Labor's previous worst outcome in a postwar election was in 1973
when it won 35.3 percent. Until 1961 it was a majority party.
   Mrs. Brundtland, 50, is a U.S.-trained doctor who specialized in
public health.
   Economists credit her for fiscal policies and wage restraints
that halved inflation in two years to 4.8 percent and turned a
balance of payments deficit into a surplus. But unemployment nearly
tripled in the same period to 5 percent, and companies went bankrupt
at the fastest rate since World War II. Surveys show Oslo to be
Europe's most expensive capital.
   Hagen, 45, a former marketing executive, complained that public
services were in a shoddy state. He proposed allowing private
services to compete with government-run institutions; privatizing
public companies and limiting immigration, which he says Norway
cannot afford.
   Despite her international reputation as a conservationist, Mrs.
Brundtland also was attacked for alleged laxness toward pollution of
Norway's fjords.

<TEXT>
   Clarence McClain, a former aide to the late Mayor
Harold Washington, was sentenced Monday to eight years in prison for
his conviction on mail fraud and racketeering charges.
   U.S. District Judge Ilana Rovner handed down the sentence after
an unusual hearing in which McClain took the stand himself and spent
an hour castigating the prosecution and the news media.
   Rovner also ordered McClain to pay $35,000 in restitution and
sentenced him to five years' probation.
   McClain, who did not take the stand during the trial itself,
accused federal prosecutors of and the media of suppressing video
and audiotape evidence that he said would have cleared him.
   McClain also said he would call for a congressional investigation
of his prosecution, which was part of the FBI's Operation Incubator
probe of alleged corruption in city government.
   McClain became so agitated during his speech that Ms. Rovner
ordered a five-minute recess so he could calm down. Throughout his
appearance, he kept handing the judge documents which he said would
clear his name.
   McClain was accused of accepting bribes from undercover FBI
informant Michael Raymond and the president of a New York-based
company in exchange for using his influence to make sure the
company, Systematic Recovery Services, got a lucrative city contract
for retrieving delinquent parking fines.
   McClain was an aide to Washington when Washington was a state
representative and a member of the Illinois congressional
delegation, but was dismissed by the mayor shortly after his 1983
election when reports surfaced about McClain's prior criminal
record, which included a conviction for pandering.
   McClain, nonetheless, reportedly told Raymond and others that he
still had the ear of the mayor and could direct bribes in
Washington's direction.

   A secret directive signed by President Bush
could expand the U.S. military role in the war on drugs, but a top
aide says the plan does not call for sending American troops into
combat.
   Bush sent security advisers to Colombia as part of a $65 million
package designed to help that nation fight cocaine, and he said last
Tuesday that an additional $261 million in security aid could go to
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia for the drug war.
   Drug czar William J. Bennett said in a televised interview Sunday
that Bush is willing to send Special Forces advisers to the Andean
nations.
   ``There is no plan for any Special Forces to accompany troops in
Peru or Bolivia into combat missions,'' Bennett said in the ABC-TV

   Outrage over the Supreme Court's flag-burning
decision is subsiding, but legislation to undo the ruling still
stands an excellent chance of approval in Congress, lawmakers say.
   ``If you vote against this law, they could say you're for burning
of the flag,'' said Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., voicing the
concern of many lawmakers that the issue remains potent despite
evidence the uproar that greeted the June 21 ruling has subsided.
   Even though House and Senate leaders expect legislation to pass,
many lawmakers who spent August at home on recess say they heard
little about the issue from constituents.
   ``My constituents couldn't care less about a superficial issue
like flag-burning,'' said Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y.

   Some of the hatred heaped on the Soviet
Union during its nine-year military intervention has shifted to the
United States, the chief supplier of the guerrilla rockets that kill
far more civilians than soldiers.
   Six months after the Soviet withdrawal, many Afghans sought out a
visitng American journalist to accuse the United States of financing
death, not promoting peace.
   ``I hate the American government because they are assisting the
opposition groups in our country. They're killing our people. We
want peace to come to Afghanistan,'' said 22-year-old Takar.
   Soviets remain unloved and still keep a low profile, but they are
no longer the enemy interloper. The Soviet Embassy compound remains
a favorite guerrilla rocket target, even though the rebels seem to
keep missing it, and some Afghans blame the Soviets as well as the
Americans for prolonging the fighting.

   The beat of Western disco music and
the flashes from multi-colored strobe lights reflect uneasily off
the dim, cobblestone streets and decaying turn-of-the-century
buildings of Weimar.
   Hundreds of people join the dance at the Communist Youth League's
meeting hall on a square named after Weimar's most illustrious son _
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
   The rest of the city is quiet, its peeling apartment blocks dark
and its uneven streets deserted.
   For decades, this once-historic city has been neglected by East
German authorities who have diverted most resources into rebuilding
East Berlin from the rubble of Nazi Germany. That attempt to match
the opulence of Western Europe and West Germany may have succeeded
but it has left deep resentment in the provinces of the country.
   ``We are a little town and there's not much left over because the
bigger cities have priority,'' a young East German woman tells a
Western visitor. A popular saying in the country is much harsher:
``What the war didn't destroy, socialism finished off.''
   The fortunes of this city have swung from one extreme to another
since it was the center of German cultural life.
   Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Weimar's enlightened
royal court attracted the brightest talents in art, literature,
philosophy and music. Johann Sebastian Bach lived in Weimar from
1708 to 1717 as the court organist and conductor.
   Later, Germany's other literary giant of the classicial period,
Friedrich von Schiller, joined Goethe and other humanist
philosophers at the elegant Saxon and Weimar court.
   Weimar rose to prominence again in 1919 when, after the fall of
the monarchy, the National Assembly met here to adopt the Weimar
Constitution. The document was the framework for a democratic
republic that would last only until 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to
power.
   Now, Weimar has come again to resemble what an English
philosopher said of it in the last century. Weimar, wrote G.H. Lewes
in 1854, ``is a very queer little place,'' where the streets are so
dim that theatergoers ``take a servant with them to carry a
lantern.''
   The English traveler could hardly have predicted the bucolic
regional capital's rapid industrial growth, its rise to prominence
as the namesake of a doomed democratic republic and its slow decline
during four decades of Communist Party rule.
   Like many small cities in East Germany, Weimar has suffered from
a chronic shortage of building materials and construction labor.
   While the nation's Communist leaders have invested millions in
modern, concrete housing blocks and launched an ambitious building
and restoration program in East Berlin, rural and regional capitals
have withered and decayed.
   Despite piecemeal renovation efforts, the city's landmarks,
including the stunning 18th century Residential Palace, stand
peeling and chipped, their facades blackened by layers of diesel
exhaust and coal soot.
   Outside the city center, rickety scaffolding stands in front of
dozens of once-elegant, turn-of-the-century apartment buildings.
   ``Don't let it fool you,'' said an apartment dweller from a dank
vestibule. ``They're not remodeling.'' She said the scaffolding went
up after a woman was struck and killed by a falling chunk of the
building's granite facade.
   ``But we're still lucky. Leipzig and Dresden are worse.''
   Considering the tremendous destruction wrought during World War
II and the enormous reparations East Germany paid to the Soviets,
great strides have been made in making the nation the most properous
in the East bloc.
   East Berlin is a glittering, bustling metropolitan center, with
crowded department stores and cafes. There is an emerging nightlife
that is the envy of Russian tourists and anyone who has spent the
night in Dresden, Rostock or Weimar.
   Slowly, laborously, the East German provinces are catching up.
   Dresden, once known as the ``Valley of the Unaware'' because its
geography blocked the reception of Western television programs, has
since gotten cable TV.
   In Weimar, workers using period plans have begun rebuilding a row
of houses on Market Square that were destroyed during the war.
   ``They're going to have shops and cafes,'' said a clerk at a
nearby hotel. ``As you can see, Weimar needs them very badly.''
   But for the foreseeable future, most East Germans will continue
to live in a crumbling, dreary world where, as Goethe once wrote
from Weimar, ``Time does not relinquish its rights, either over
human beings or over monuments.''

   Actress Madlyn Rhue: ``I'm always on time, I'm
in makeup on time, I know my lines, I'm funny on the set and I bring
a professionalism to the show I'm on.
   ``I think I've made a difference for handicapped people,'' added
Miss Rhue, who is confined to a wheelchair because of multiple
sclerosis.
   This season she stars in an episode of CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote''

wheelchair,'' she said. ``I'm so happy they cast an actress in a
wheelchair for the role.
   ``On `Trial by Jury' I'm on the bench so no one will know that
I'm in a wheelchair. I won't be making a statement. Yet it does make
a statement because a handicapped actress is doing the part. I love
to do parts for people not in a wheelchair. Just get them because I
read better than anyone else.''
   In addition, Miss Rhue has made a television public-service
announcement for the Multiple Sclerosis Society. The campaign,
called ``Profiles in Courage,'' encourages all people to lead fuller
lives whether they are disabled or not.
   ``When I was first in the wheelchair, I had to stay on the set
when I was working,'' she said. ``Now I have a driver. He gets me
everywhere on time. I don't cost the show anything. He also takes me
to therapy three times a week.''
   Multiple sclerosis is a progressive neurological disease, she
explained. ``The three worse things are heat, fatigue and stress.
What you should do is exercise in water so you stay cool.
   ``I first knew I had MS in 1973 or '74. I didn't tell anyone
because all I had was a little dropped foot. Then I had to walk with
a cane. Then I had to walk with two canes. I've been in the
wheelchair since 1981, but I wasn't wheelchair-bound at first. I
could get up, drive, dress myself. I've been confined to the
wheelchair for two years.''
   While she was interviewed in her Beverly Hills apartment, a huge
flower arrangement from the producers of ``Trial by Jury'' was
delivered. The apartment walls were decorated with several of her
oil paintings and sketches. She is a talented artist whose works has
been exhibited in galleries around the country and are in the
private collections of many celebrities.
   Miss Rhue has been an actress since the 1950s, appearing in more
than 15 feature and television movies. She's also done numerous
guest roles on television and been a regular in ``Bracken's World,''
``Executive Suite,'' and ``Houston Knights.'' She had recurring
roles in ``Fame'' and ``Days of Our Lives.''
   The actress was in ``Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' and was one of
the nurses aboard the pink submarine in ``Operation Petticoat'' with
Cary Grant and Tony Curtis.
   Her professional name comes from the title of a movie. ``I was
looking for a name and remembered a James Cagney movie called `13
Rue Madeleine.' That's an address in Paris and I had grown up
thinking my father was French,'' said Miss Rhue, who was born
Madeline Roche in Washington, D.C.
   ``I tried Madeline Rue. My mother said it needed something. We
played around with it and settled on Madlyn Rhue.''
   Miss Rhue said when she did ``Murder, She Wrote'' she was
offended by one of the lines.
   ``I play the wife of the murder victim,'' she said. ``The line I
objected to was that this man couldn't fall in love with my
character because she wasn't a complete woman. I told the producer,
`Look, the husband was a rat. If you leave that line in, it gives
him an excuse for being a rat.' We filmed it with and without the
line and I don't know which version they'll use.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BICYCLE RACE _ The story of American bicyclist Greg LeMond, who
overcame a near fatal hunting accident to win the Tour de France,
will be told in a TV movie from Warner Bros. Television. Part of the
deal also calls for an authorized biography to be published by
Warner Books. LeMond, 28, won the Tour de France in 1986 and the
following year was wounded by a shotgun blast in a hunting accident.
It was assumed he'd never race again, but he won the 1989 race.

<HEAD>What's All This Talk About `Long Term?'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As John Tuccillo sees it, the long term holds
less and less value in our American economic system. Money now, not
later, is more important, even if it might diminish personal or
business longevity.
   Look around and see the evidence: College coaches suspended for
trying to buy success, elected officials throwing away careers,
well-paid brokers and some executives jailed for manipulations.
   All, says Tuccillo, have this in common: They sacrificed a very
good long-term situation by succumbing to the temptations of the
moment. They had it good, but it wasn't good enough. They couldn't
take the time.
   In a sense, he suggests, the values of these folks aren't much
different from those of the drug seller or drug user, both of whom
cannot resist the temptation of ``now'' while diminishing the
chances of a long life span.
   Tuccillo is a business economist and, he insists, these are
economic considerations. Specifically, he is a real estate
economist, and he believes the ``now'' mode of thinking can damage
real estate sales.
   In his fears he has plenty of company, including President George
Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who are examining ways
to build long-term incentives into the business system, the better
to compete.
   While Americans are accustomed to hearing of easy money and quick
results in sports, the underworld, lotteries, corrupt politics and
entertainment, they sometimes fail to realize that it prevails
elsewhere too.
   In business, he relates, ``the prominent figures no longer make
cars or steel or produce petroleum products. Today Ford, Carnegie
and Rockefeller are Donald Trump and Carl Icahn, guys who makes
deals, not sedans.''
   He concedes there are some executives, such as Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca, who may be viewed as exceptions. But, he notes,
``Chrysler makes more of its profit from financing cars than it does
from making them.''
   All this, he suggests, is a product of the incentives systems
permeating our society and economy. Reward structures have become
increasingly short-term in focus, benefiting consumption at the
expense of building for the future.
   ``Government service is no longer viewed as a long-term career,
as it is in Japan or Europe, but a two-year steppingstone to big
consulting contracts,'' he says. Even some business activities that
appear long-term ``are more on the order of rearranging the deck
chairs,'' involving debt and sales of assets.
   Consumers are no exception. Says economist Tuccillo: ``We want
what we want when we want it, and if achieving that requires
spending more than we earn, so be it.''
   What has this got to do with real estate? Well, it's hurting home
sales. By now, everyone has heard that first-time buyers find it
difficult to afford a house. It's hard on them, no doubt _ but
reason to give up?
   Based on past experience, it isn't. In the past, families somehow
managed to buy against what might appear by today's standards to be
insurmountable odds. They would have bided their time, worked and
saved.
   Today, says Tuccillo, rising house prices combined with a
disappearing savings discipline persuade young families that it's
more reasonable to spend $250 for a new VCR than to put the money
toward a down payment.
   He suggests that we might see how deeply ingrained this mindset
has become. If interest rates fall, he suggests, it could trigger
only a modest rally in residential numbers. Why? The down payment
was spent on other things.
   That's one of the short-term impacts. Longer term, he says, all
this puts us at a substantial disadvantage relative to our
industrial rivals. The Japanese are focused on the longer term and
building toward it. Europe too.
   To a real extent, he concludes, ``we are courting the fate of
Aesop's hare, who having achieved much, got lost in his own
excellence and eventually lost it all.''

<HEAD>Congress Linking Drug War, Budget Priorities</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that there's a war on, politicians who want
to cut federal programs or change priorities are going to be trying
to wrap their proposals in the banner of the fight against drugs.
   That worked first time out, with Senate approval of an amendment
to cut spending for postage-free mailings to constituents. The GOP
already was on that case, complaining about the steady expansion of
the free mail franking privilege, which works to the advantage of
incumbents seeking new terms.
   The amendment passed the Senate easily, 83-9, on Thursday. But it
will be a hard sell in negotiations with the House, where
Republicans are trying to make incumbency an issue against the
majority Democrats who have dominated the place for 35 years.
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson of California, who is running for
governor next year, sponsored the amendment shifting $45 million
from free mail to a program for drug-addicted mothers and their
babies. That would leave about $35 million for franked congressional
mail if the House went along.
   The numbers don't make a dent in the $7.9 billion President Bush
wants spent on the drug war, a sum Democratic leaders argue is too
low. Wilson said it was almost symbolic.
   Democrats will be back with their own arguments in favor of cuts
and shifts in administration-proposed spending, especially on
defense, contending the money should be used against drugs.
   The administration proposes to get additional funds for the drug
war by shifting $751 million from other programs, most of them
domestic. Democratic leaders have said the drug crisis could
increase pressures for a tax increase, a step Bush rejects. ``I
don't think we have to think of the war on drugs as a war on the
taxpayer,'' said drug policy adviser William J. Bennett. ``I don't
think anybody thinks that the reason we have a drug problem in this
country is that taxes are too low.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the cut in free
mail privileges would send a signal ``that we are not going to be
hypocrites on the drug issue.
   ``If the critics want a down payment on the war on drugs, vote
for this amendment,'' he said. ``It is only $45 million, but that is
a start. We only need to find $740 million more.''
   Wilson's amendment would eliminate financing for mass
congressional mailings to constituents. Senators and representatives
now can send newsletters and the like to every address in their
state or district, two times a year for senators, four times for
House members. There's no limit on the size of each missive.
   Members of Congress still could send free mail addressed by name.
But they couldn't send franked mail addressed to occupant or postal
patron.
   Dole said the measure was a way for Congress to enlist in the war
on drugs and do it with a sacrifice. ``These funds will come out of
our budgets, out of our pockets for a change,'' he said. Dole said
there's too much congressional junk mail anyhow.
   While it was a Republican amendment, stiffest opposition came
from Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who argued that a lot of his
constituents are isolated, can't get daily newspapers, and get their
information about Washington from his newsletter and others.
   But it was a losing argument, not only because of the drug war
but also against the complaints of reformers about congressional
mass mailing _ and Senate resentment against the House, which spends
a lot more money on them. The House had voted $124.5 million for
free mailings in its version of the legislative appropriations bill.
A conference committee will have to negotiate a settlement between
the two bills. It is not likely to settle on a cut nearly as drastic
as the Wilson amendment.
   In the House, Rep. John G. Rowland, a Republican opponent of the
B-2 stealth bomber, said he will propose a bill this week to cancel
more than $1 billion in appropriations for the costly warplane and
put that money into the drug war.
   That won't be done. But it is the kind of cut that will be
proposed often in the weeks ahead as evidence of a commitment to the
drug war.

   Today is Wednesday, Sept. 20, the 263rd day of 1989. There are
102 days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Sept. 20, 1519, Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan set
out from Spain on a voyage to find a western passage to the Indies.
Magellan was killed en route, but one of his ships eventually
circled the globe.
   On this date:
   In 1870, Italian troops took control of the Papal States, leading
to the unification of Italy.
   In 1873, panic swept the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in
the wake of railroad bond defaults and bank failures.
   In 1881, Chester A. Arthur was sworn in as the 21st president of
the United States, succeeding James A. Garfield, who was
assassinated.
   In 1884, the Equal Rights Party was formed during a convention of
suffragists in San Francisco. The convention nominated Belva Ann
Bennett Lockwood of Washington, D.C., for president.
   In 1947, former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia died.
   In 1958, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was seriously
wounded at a New York City department store when an apparently
deranged black woman stabbed him in the chest.
   In 1962, James Meredith, a black, was blocked from enrolling in
the University of Mississippi by Gov. Ross R. Barnett. Meredith was
later admitted.
   In 1963, President John F. Kennedy proposed a joint U.S.-Soviet
expedition to the moon in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly.
   In 1973, in their so-called ``battle of the sexes,'' tennis star
Billie Jean King defeated Bobby Riggs in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3,
6-3, at the Houston Astrodome.
   In 1976, Playboy magazine released an interview in which
Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter admitted he'd ``looked
on a lot of women with lust.''
   In 1977, the first wave of Southeast Asian ``boat people''
arrived in San Francisco under a new U.S. resettlement program.
   In 1978, John Vorster, prime minister of white-ruled South Africa
since 1966, announced his resignation, saying he would seek the
ceremonial position of president.
   Ten years ago: Jean-Bedel Bokassa, the self-styled head of the
Central African Empire, was overthrown in a French-supported coup
while on a visit to Libya.
   Five years ago: A suicide car bomber attacked the U.S. Embassy
annex in north Beirut, killing a dozen people. Pope John Paul II
wrapped up his 12-day tour of Canada in Ottawa, appealing for action
against the nuclear arms race, economic injustice and abortion.
   One year ago: Greg Louganis of the United States won the gold
medal in springboard diving at the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South
Korea, one day after he struck and injured his head on the board in
the preliminary round.
   Today's birthdays: Boston Celtics President Red Auerbach is 72.
Singer Gogi Grant is 65. Psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers is 61.
Actress-comedian Anne Meara is 60. Actress Sophia Loren is 55.
Hockey player Guy LaFleur is 38.
   Thought for today: ``Envy is more irreconcilable than hatred.'' _
Duc Francois de la Rochefoucauld, French author (1613-1680).

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Kristin Baker has toyed with all sorts of
futures, but the one she settled on will go down in the history of
the United States Military Academy. Meet the head of cadets, a
21-year-old, firm-jawed woman of rare capacities.

<TEXT>
   The new first captain of the United
States Military Academy's corps of cadets is an eclectic, if not a
Renaissance, woman, the first female to reach that rank in the
history of the nation's oldest service academy.
   ``I had wanted to be a veterinarian,'' Kirstin Baker says. ``Then
I wanted to be a doctor, and I guess at one point I wanted to be a
stewardess.''
   But, instead, she now oversees the lives of 4,400 cadets, 90
percent of them men, and heads a staff of 40. She is also a
cross-country skier who loves to dance, a soccer player with a
penchant for country and rock music, and an Army brat who graduated
from the Army's elite air assault school.
   Now Baker, a 5-foot-4-inch, 112-pound senior from Burke, Va.,
sports the same badges of rank that have adorned the uniforms of men
like Douglas MacArthur and John ``Black Jack'' Pershing. But Baker,
21, is determined to keep her boots firmly on the ground.
   ``I have an office that's adjoined to my room now. That's one of
the benefits, I guess. So I have two places to study instead of
one.''
   She was chosen on the basis of academic excellence, athletic
abilities and military skill demonstrated during the last three
years.
   This summer, as Baker drilled a crop of new cadets, or
``plebes,'' she was notified by Brig. Gen. Fred Gorden, the
academy's commandant, that she'd been picked.
   ``I don't know how I reacted to it,'' Baker said. ``I must've
reacted kind of funny because he went, `You did want it, didn't
you?'''
   Surrounded by reporters and cameras soon after marching the
plebes 13 miles from Lake Frederick, Baker talked about the military
with the same ease and frankness that she discusses her love for the
music of Lee Greenwood and The Cure.
   ``I love to dance,'' she said. ``I tended in high school to
listen to a lot of punk rock. Just kind of one of those things I
still do sometimes.''
   Reactions by cadets to Baker's appointment were generally
supportive if indifferent. On some lips was the name Mike Thorson, a
senior from Onalaska, Wis., and a standout defensive back on the
Army football team, who apparently was Baker's chief rival for the
job.
   ``There were a couple of guys that were higher than her, much
higher than her academically, athletically and probably militarily,
but that's not the only criteria they use,'' said senior Bill Burke
of Wilmington, Del.
   As for Thorson, he said, ``We just knew he was up for it because
of how good he was. He's going to be a Rhodes scholar and
everything. He wanted to be the brigade commander. He's a good
friend of mine and I think he's a little bit disappointed, but he'll
do a good job working for Kristin.''
   Junior Kara Soules of Ocala, Fla., said: ``A lot of guys are
like, `I can't believe a girl got it. She's not qualified and she
got it just because she's a girl.' Of course there's a lot of guys
who are going to be upset.''
   Other female cadets couldn't understand why so much attention was
being paid to Baker's historic appointment.
   ``Well, it's just like any other person,'' said junior Pam Horne
of San Antonio. ``I mean, if she works as hard as a guy, I don't
think there's any difference being the fact she's a woman. I think
women are perfectly accepted here. I don't think it's that big a
deal. She's just the brigade commander for a year.''

   Junior Lisa Buskirk of Perry, Ill., agreed: ``There's been a lot
of company commanders and platoon leaders that are female. That
hasn't been a problem at all. It's just that brigade commander
sounds so big.''
   Baker is sensitive to suggestions that her achievement is but
another step by the academy to try to catch up with the 20th century
after a long period of resisting change. In August 1987, Gorden
became the first black to be named commandant at West Point.
   ``It's funny because everybody always talks about changing
traditions at West Point,'' Baker said. ``You don't change
tradition, you enhance it. The tradition at West Point is the
excellence, the honor, the gray uniforms. The things that happen
because society changes don't change the traditions. They simply
enhance the traditions.''
   Women comprise 10 percent of the cadets at West Point, which
academy officials say is proportional to the number of women in the
U.S. Army as a whole.
   As captains and colonels map out Baker's hectic schedule to make
time for interviews, photo opportunities and television appearances,
the star attraction seems to be wondering what the fuss is all about.
   ``I don't think that your role as a leader is based on sex at
all. Leadership is an individual idiosyncrasy,'' said Baker, a human
factors engineering psychology major with a 3.36 grade point
average. ``Because leadership is something that people have and it's
from inside themselves.''
   Baker admits that fate may have played a role in making her
competitive for the first captain job, a rank other women have
aspired to since they were first allowed to become cadets 13 years
ago.
   Last year, the academy for the first time in recent memory gave
the ``cows,'' or juniors, all the sergeant positions, which are
usually reserved for seniors. Appointed a regimental command
sergeant major, Baker performed well and credits the visibility with
putting her ``out in front then.''
   Shortly before she would be formally inducted into the long, gray
lineage of first captains that includes William Westmoreland,
Jonathan Wainwright and Pete Dawkins, Baker pondered the challenging
year that lay ahead.
   ``I really haven't developed a solid philosophy yet,'' Baker
said. ``I'd really like to see the corps with a lot of spirit, and
stress that sense of honor and integrity that I think are more the
leadership qualities that are very important when you graduate from
the academy.''
   It was during a family vacation that Baker first was impressed by
the aura of the 187-year-old academy overlooking the Hudson River.
``I came in and saw the uniforms and I saw the rooms and I kind of
got drawn in by all the tradition that was wrapped up in West
Point,'' she said. ``Not a lot of cadets want to admit that.''
   Her family moving from South Carolina to Virginia when she was a
senior in high school had a lot to do with her decision. Baker, who
had been leaning toward attending the University of Virginia,
changed her mind after the move ``because everybody I knew was going
to the University of Virginia, so it wasn't as exciting anymore as
it was when I was in South Carolina.''
   Her father is a U.S. Army colonel and a 1966 graduate of West
Point, but she says that that didn't make her automatically consider
a military career.
   She thinks the opportunity to help her fellow cadets would be the
most rewarding part of her new job.
   ``It's really the cadets that matter to me most,'' she said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Southern-style barbecue in Vermont? Yep.
Twenty-five years ago Curtis Tuff, a former migrant worker, built a
brick pit on Route 5 just outside Putney and began dispensing
barbecued chicken and ribs from an old school bus that serves as a
stand. Around these parts it's known as the Ninth Wonder.

<DATELINE>PUTNEY, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You'd be hard-pressed to tell that the symbol
painted on Curtis Tuff's bright-blue school bus was a map of America
if it weren't for the marker pointing to Putney.
   The map seems wildly out of scale _ the marker is the size of
Australia _ but it isn't, not really.
   Putney, population 2,188, looms just as large to Curtis Tuff. It
was here, 25 years ago, that he rediscovered kindness and decency.
It was here that he settled out of the life of a migrant farmworker
and made his home. And it was here that he found a calling:
dispensing chicken and ribs out a bus window, a rustic barbecue
stand his customers dubbed ``The Ninth Wonder of the World.''
   Before that, ``it hadn't been a very nice life,'' says Curtis,
51. ``I never had the opportunity to know my father. My mother was
killed in a car wreck when I was 15 or 16. My oldest brother, in
Tampa, Fla., took care of me until I got big enough to go out on my
own.''
   But the world had little to offer a teen-ager with a ninth-grade
education, so, he says, ``I followed the season. That way there was
enough work to last all year.''
   In 1961, a Putney apple orchard became the last stop on his
annual migration from the citrus groves of Florida to the peach
trees of North Carolina, the potato fields of Virginia and the
cherry orchards of New York.
   At 23, Curtis already had an old man's knowledge of how hard life
can be. As a migrant worker, ``You don't get what you should be
paid, and you get treated bad.
   ``I've been there and lived through it. It's awful to see. You
can't stop 'cause you don't ever make enough to settle down.''
   Putney was different. At Green Mountain Orchard ``they always
treated the men nice. The people in town were nice, too.''
   The kindness of the people and the decency of his bosses were
revelations that accompanied Curtis over the next few years. The
white clapboard houses and rolling hills of Putney would come to him
as he dug potatoes. Picking peaches he'd find himself daydreaming
about apples.
   Eventually, rather than follow the season, Curtis Tuff followed
his heart. Green Mountain Orchard got a new full-time employee, and
a perennial wanderer got a home.
   Putney got something, too: ``The best barbecue north of
Georgia,'' says Joe Delio of East Swanzey, N.H., who's been known to
belly up to the bus twice in a day.
   It's a 60-mile round trip between Curtis' Barbecue and Delio's
driveway, child's play to Delio, a drug- and alcohol-abuse counselor
whose hunger for authentic barbecue has taken him as far as Texas.
   Before Curtis came to Vermont, barbecue had been nothing more
than a vague memory of a happier time. ``I'd been to one barbecue in
my life as a kid. A man in Georgia cooked hams on a grill. He cooked
them over a wood fire, and I watched him do it. 'Course, I also
watched his daughter, which is why I was there.''
   Oddly enough, he found the hams more compelling. ``I said, `How's
he gonna get those done?' He said, `You just watch.' It took six
hours but that ham had a really good taste to it.
   ``I was 12 years old, and I never forgot it.''
   Years later, still haunted by the taste, he built a brick pit,
forked over $1.50 for a license and began cooking chickens beside
Route 5, just off the Interstate 91 exit for Putney.
   From his post by the pit he's in the perfect position to catch an
oft-heard refrain: ``Barbecue? In Vermont??''
   ``That's why it's called the Ninth Wonder,'' he says.
   Curtis Tuff's reputation grew along with his operation.
   Over the years, the pit and a tin shack have been joined by
picnic tables _ 23 at last count _ the school bus, a badminton net,
an outdoor sink, a portable toilet and a fenced-in playground with a
swing set, sandbox and toys.
   This year's improvements: a border of marigolds, impatiens,
gladioluses and pansies, and a second school bus painted the same
signature blue and equipped with freezers stocked with ice cream.
Business cards, postcards and T-shirts are also available.
   Eventually, Curtis left the orchard to devote himself to what
passes for full-time barbecuing in southern Vermont: April to
November, Thursday to Sunday, snow, sleet, hail, rain or shine.
   In the clearing behind Rod's Car Care Center where the smoke is
thickest is where you'll find Curtis, presiding over the fearsome
assemblage that replaced the brick pit. Sheltered by a tin roof and
mounted on an old hay wagon, it's fashioned from two 375-gallon oil
drums turned on their sides, tops sawn off and bellies blazing with
chunks of seasoned hardwood.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ There's a new oasis in central Washington state,
and it is copying its future after the California wine country to
the south. It's a new tourist draw and Washingtonians are putting
out the welcome mat with a little home-brewed romance.

   Romantic dinner trains rumble through
canyons, famous musicians perform along the Columbia River, and
bed-and-breakfast inns seem as ubiquitous as apple trees.
   It's a long way from California's Napa Valley, but central
Washington's wine country is slowly developing into a tourist
attraction.
   As many as 300,000 people a year visit state wineries where an
array of facilities and activities are being developed to
accommodate them.
   ``The wineries have drawn an awful lot of people here,'' says
Gary Hogue, president of the Hogue Cellars winery near Prosser.
``Therefore the need for goods and services follow.''
   Still, there's no mistaking the area for Napa North, even though
Washington trails only California and New York in wine production.
   The Napa Valley has more than 250 wineries crowded into a 30-mile
long area, with attractions and services for more than 2.5 million
visitors a year.
   Central Washington, by contrast, has about 35 wineries scattered
across 180 miles, from Wenatchee to Walla Walla, many in small towns
lacking sophisticated amenities.
   ``Look at Napa 15 years ago and it was similar to what we have
now,'' says Randy Tucker, director of Tucker Cellars in Sunnyside.
``There were no motels, no restaurants, no bed-and-breakfasts.
   ``I think the wine industry has laid the groundwork for bringing
people in in large numbers.''
   Already there are signs of change.
   The Champs de Brionne Winery, outside George, Wash., for several
years has booked big-name musical performers such as Bob Dylan, Rod
Stewart and the Judds at its natural amphitheater above the Columbia
River. They draw up to 17,000 people to a town with a population of
just 260. The winery's products are the only liquor that can be
brought into the shows.
   Recently Washington Central Railroad Co. began operating dinner
trains that include winery stops.
   The Friday dinner and Sunday brunch train departs Yakima for the
college town of Ellensburg, where riders spend a half-hour at the
Cascade Crest Estates Winery in the converted railroad depot as the
engine is turned around.
   On Saturday night the dinner train runs from Kennewick to
Prosser, stopping at the Hogue Cellars. The three-hour rides cost
$45 a person.
   ``I think it's good for the wineries and good for the
passengers,'' says Brig Temple, manager of the dinner trains for the
railroad. ``Some out-of-town passengers get a chance to taste the
local flavors. It adds to the trip.''
   Another sign of tourism's impact is Tucker Cellar's decision to
build a tasting room in Yakima, in addition to its winery tasting
room 40 miles south in Sunnyside. The downtown Yakima facility is
designed to draw some of the convention visitors to central
Washington's largest city, Tucker says.
   ``They don't have time to go through the valley,'' he says.
   Washington has more than 70 wineries, with about half clustered
in the fruit-growing central region. The rest are scattered in
western Washington, with a handful in the Spokane area.
   Studying reports from 33 wineries across the state, from May to
September of 1987, a Washington State University survey found that
visitors ranged from 12 a month at one remote winery to 5,500 a
month at the busiest one.
   ``The average age of the visitors was 40 years old and the
average income was estimated at $40,000 per year,'' Folwell says,
adding most of the visitors lived in Washington.
   Large-scale wine production is only about a decade old in
Washington, and Gail Thompson of the state Department of Tourism
says promotion of the wineries to out-of-state visitors is still in
its infancy.
   ``We haven't been in the business of promoting visitors for years
and years, like the California wine country,'' Ms. Thompson says,
noting that one problem was inadequate maps on winery brochures to
direct visitors to some of the most remote locations.
   But everywhere there seems to be an awakening.
   Wil Masset, owner of Yakima's Birchfield Manor, recently opened a
five-room inn above his gourmet restaurant.
   ``There were six wineries in the state when we came,'' Masset
says. ``Now there are really super deluxe facilities a few miles
from here.''
   Another inn opened recently in Sunnyside. Three have opened in
Prosser in the past year, along with a 30-unit motel.
   Festivals provide the busiest weekends for the wineries,
including the spring barrel tasting when thousands of visitors
sample newly made wines right from the barrel.
   Tucker says 3,500 people visited his winery over that weekend.
   But for all the activity, winery owners are aware that central
Washington will never rival the Napa Valley, located near San
Francisco, primarily because the population density is just not
there, Hogue says.
   As lively as the tourist business is, the wineries rely on sales
to retail stores for volume. Only 13 percent of total production is
sold by the tasting rooms _ just about two bottles to the customer.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a tiny town thinking about self-destructing
because it can't take care of itself anymore. With its population
aging and shrinking, Jacksonville, Pa., simply can't raise the money
to do the things the state government says it must do. One solution
would be to link up with a neighboring township, but that might be
easier said than done.

<TEXT>
   Tired old Jacksonville is running out of
coal, youth, taxes and time.
   Hanging on with only about 60 residents, caught between
decreasing tax revenues and increasing state pressure to install
sewers, the Borough Council has begun talk about disbanding and
casting Jacksonville's nearly square-mile of territory to the mercy
of neighboring townships.
   ``If we go another five or 10 years, no one is going to be here
anymore,'' says Councilman Stanley Gryczuk, 77, a retired miner and
butcher.
   ``The old ones are dying off and the young ones leave us,'' says
Councilwoman Mary Grimm, 81, a retired cook.
   Jacksonville, about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, was never as big
as nearby Saltsburg. But plentiful coal and hard work kept it on the
map, its young folks close and its future hopeful.
   With neat frame houses scattered along a hillside, it boasted as
many as 150 residents in the 1930s, mostly coal miners and their
families, and even a bank, barber, butcher, blacksmith and railroad
station.
   ``It was the quietest, nicest town you'd ever want to see,'' says
Jacob Grimm, 84, Mary Grimm's husband, a retired miner and himself a
councilman ``for, oh, about 30 years.''
   Council members say there are fewer people willing, or able, to
govern.
   Mayor Tom Salva, in his 60s, has been too ill to attend a council
meeting in two years.
   ``We don't expect him to come to the meetings. We bring things to
him,'' Mrs. Grimm says. ``In the last election, we were trying to
get someone new to be the mayor, but no one would run, so we just
wrote Tom in.''
   The average age of the council members, including the Grimms and
Gryczuk, is 71.5 years, without counting young Frank Stango.
   Stango, 21, a business major at nearby Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, was recruited for the council several years ago by his
mother, Councilwoman Josephine Stango, 56, a part-time postal worker.
   Councilman Adam Gordish, a retired coal miner, is 75 years old.
His son-in-law, Robert Yatzkanic, 56, is also a councilman. Delores
Yatzkanic, Gordish's daughter and Yatzkanic's wife, is borough
secretary.
   Most everyone is a Democrat. Mrs. Grimm says there are six
Republicans and she can give directions to each of their houses.
   Townsfolk say Yatzkanic, an X-ray technician at a nearby
Westinghouse Electric Corp. plant, is one of the half-dozen or so
people in Jacksonville still working.
   ``Everybody's retired,'' Mrs. Grimm says. ``We have more widows
in town than anyone else. The young people grow up, go to school and
then they leave.''
   The council also expects young Stango to leave town one of these
days. It recently won permission from a Common Pleas Court judge to
allow it to eventually reduce its numbers from seven to five members.
   ``Jacksonville's as big as it's going to get,'' Stango says with
a shrug. ``Unless something comes this way, I don't see any reason
for anyone to move in.''
   The borough has no property, no municipal building and no
equipment of its own. The council pays $10 to meet once a month in a
classroom at the United Presbyterian Church about halfway up Mill
Street.
   Mrs. Yatzkanic estimated the borough's annual budget at about
$19,000, mostly to keep water in a few fire hydrants, street lights
illuminated, and Mill Street and a few side roads repaired and
plowed.
   ``We didn't have to name our side streets until we got ambulance
service,'' Mrs. Grimm says.
   The borough pays a man with a pickup truck $45 to plow and sand
the streets whenever it snows.
   Council members were shocked when a state agency said
Jacksonville must contribute $700 a year for unemployment insurance
for the trucker and the borough's part-time solicitor.
   They are angry that state or Indiana County officials often
charge the borough the same standard governmental fees paid by
larger communities, such as Indiana, the county seat of about 16,000
people.
   Most public tasks, such as patching a municipal road, are too
small for local contractors to bother with, Gryczuk says. Bigger
projects would jolt the municipal budget and the taxpayers.
   ``We have to wait three or four years to accumulate enough money
to get a road fixed,'' Gryczuk says.
   Council members also are worried about a potential financial
knockout _ a longstanding demand by the state Department of
Environmental Resources that Jacksonville install a sewer system to
replace septic tanks.
   Mrs. Stango says the lastest estimates put the cost for sewers at
about $40 per month for each homeowner, mostly for interest on the
capital expenditure.
   Mrs. Stango says the borough doesn't have the money for
engineering studies for the sewer project. Mrs. Grimm says most
residents can't afford sewers anyway.
   At the Golden Pheasant tavern on the two-lane state highway,
owner Eddie Sklar, himself a former councilman, worried that new
talk of disbanding the municipality may cost him his liquor license
eventually.
   ``This is my livelihood,'' he says. ``I don't want to lose it.''
   Sklar suggested the borough can save money by asking homeowners
to pay for the street lights near their homes and by asking
neighboring townships to run their plows down Mill Street
occasionally.
   He says council members should have installed sewers years ago,
when costs would have been less.
   Sklar was instrumental in getting an oil driller to sink the
community's water well just outsde the borough line for free.
   But he concedes that running a little town is difficult. When he
was a councilman more than a decade ago, for example, he recalls
that the borough received $180 in revenue sharing money, but had to
spend $144 on a required newspaper advertisement to describe
publicly how the money would be spent.
   ``Nobody wants the responsibility. No one wants to do anything,''
Sklar says. ``But I don't see what they're going to gain going to a
township.''
   Mrs. Stango says officials are reluctant to break up the borough,
which was founded in 1853 and named after President Andrew Jackson.
   ``We would never disband if it would hurt anybody,'' she says.
   Still, with an eye on lowering taxes and benefiting from ample
road equipment in neighboring municipalities, council members say
they are considering overtures to officials of adjacent Black Lick
and Young townships.
   ``But who would take us?'' Mrs. Grimm says. ``We don't know.''

<TEXT>
   In a place where World War II
ended late, the Soviet Union has finally started letting foreigners
in to see the red flag flying over the Kuril Islands.
   The Kurils, which arc from northern Japan to the Soviet
mainland's Kamchatka Peninsula, were held by Japan from 1875 to 1945
and in the early postwar years became one of the spawning grounds of
the Cold War.
   In August 1945, Soviet troops advanced across the Kurils for more
than two weeks after Japan had surrendered to the Allies,
heightening suspicions in Washington about Soviet designs on Japan
and starting a territorial dispute with Tokyo that still blocks a
World War II peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union.
   But now a warmer wind is blowing from Moscow, and militarily
important regions in the Soviet Far East are being opened to foreign
eyes as never before because of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policies of glasnost and perestroika _ openness and reconstruction
through local initiative _ and a hunger for foreign investment,
foreign expertise and foreign contact.
   The Kurils, although Japan still holds claim to them, may have a
role in those Kremlin plans for Far East development _ at least, for
foreign tourism.
   ``Now we live in such an interesting period, when foreigners are
not afraid of Russians and Russians are not afraid of foreigners,''
said a Soviet teacher here in Yuzhno Kurilsk, the main town on foggy
Kunashir Island, a former Japanese island just 10 miles across a
strait from northern Japan.
   Moscow-based Western reporters visited Vladivostok, the
headquarters of the Soviet Pacific Fleet, last fall for the first
time.
   Recently a group of about 40 Tokyo-based U.S. and European
journalists and Japanese photographers, plus a few business people,
were allowed to tour Khabarovsk on the Soviet mainland and Kunashir
in the Kurils and Sakhalin, a long, narrow island just off the
Soviet mainland and about 50 miles from Japan's Hokkaido Island.
   The Soviets would talk about anything but military details. Four
of the visiting journalists were briefly detained when they neared
the Sokol air base on Sakhalin.
   Soviet fighter planes took off from Sakhalin to shoot down the
South Korean airliner, KAL 007, with the loss of 269 lives six years
ago on a flight from the United States to Seoul.
   ``There would have been less noise about this plane if the
government ... had described everything about this tragedy,'' said
Valery Belyaev, chairman of local radio and television on Sakhalin.
   Authorities in Moscow, he added, had tried to explain away the
tragedy by saying the jumbo jet was a spy plane or carried no
passengers.
   ``Many (Soviet) people today think the plane was empty, but we
know that almost 270 people did not return home,'' Belyaev said.
   The shooting-down of the airliner was one of many tension peaks
in Asia in the past 10 years for which blame was laid on Moscow,
including the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia.
   Now under Gorbachev the Soviets have withdrawn from Afghanistan
and the Soviet-backed Vietnamese are to leave Cambodia by Sept. 26.
Moscow also has patched up relations with China and, in trying to
join the economic boom on the Asian rim of the Pacific, has invited
foreign investment into the Soviet Far East, including the Kurils.
   So far, however, the Soviets have done little more than realize
how big the economic problems are.
   The Far East region, from Vladivostok in the south to the Arctic
north, covers more than a quarter of the immense Soviet land mass
but has only 7.9 million inhabitants. Yet its mineral and forest
resources are huge and the fisheries are among the world's richest.
Sakhalin, a vast and miserable prison camp in czarist times, has
important oil deposits and coal mines.
   The region's people, however, live in cramped apartments in
shabby buildings, as in most of the Soviet Union.
   Despite Sakhalin's energy resources, the Tourist Hotel in the
regional capital, Yuzhno Sakhalinsk, had no hot water. The use of
electricity is low; the ferry terminal in the port of Holmsk had no
outdoor lighting at night. Several sidewalks and streets had open
manholes.
   Officials and ordinary citizens alike complained about the sparse
supplies of fish in the shops despite the teeming seas and
salmon-choked rivers. The manager of a cannery in Sakhalin said he
had problems sometimes with shortages of cans.
   How did it get like this?
   ``We are to blame,'' said Pavel Minakir, deputy director of the
Institute for Economic Researches of the Far Eastern branch of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences. ``For a long time we developed
separately from the world market.''
   The resulting list of problems is long, he said: poor technology,
inefficiency, low investment in infrastructure, the ruble currency's
lack of convertibility into hard currency.
   The Chinese proved themselves better businessmen than the Soviets
in barter trade, which Minakir said had to be curtailed because
exports of construction materials caused shortages in the Soviet Far
while Japan does not seek the return of southern Sakhalin, it
insists that Moscow return the other islands.
   While talks on the dispute take place regularly, the Soviets are
unlikely to give up territory to Japan when other Soviet regions are
agitating for independence.
   The Soviets pointedly brought the journalists to Yuzhno Kurilsk
on Kunashir to observe a rainswept ceremony Sept. 3 marking the 44th
anniversary of the capture of the island.
   An honor guard fired a 21-round salute, a brass band played
marches, a crowd of about 200 townspeople watched, and a few
bemedaled veterans of the last fighting in the northern Pacific
stood proudly before a monument extolling the Soviet soldiers who
died ``to return the Southern Kurils to the motherland.''

   Because she lives in one of the
most remote places in the Soviet Union, Galya Chinchikova makes
about triple the national average wage, but it doesn't translate
into a life of luxury.
   ``We have plenty of money, but we have nothing,'' said the
34-year-old Communist Party worker in Yuzhno Kurilsk, a fishing town
of 7,000 people on Kunashir, southernmost of the disputed Kuril
Islands.
   The lack of comfort didn't make Mrs. Chinchikova any less loyal,
however. It's simply the way pioneering life is on the cold and
rainy island where the sun shines only 50 or 60 days a year.
   Her husband, Vassily Chinchikov, 37, is an exuberant artist whose
seascape murals decorate the walls of the town canteen. He sells
paintings to supplement his wife's 600-ruble ($925) monthly income.
   The couple, both born on Kunashir, invited a foreign visitor to
stay the night in their warm and brightly furnished but tiny
apartment. They slept behind a curtain in an alcove off the living
room. Their 7-year-old son, Andrei, had a bunk bed over a workshop
table in a small room off the kitchen. The plumbing was primitive,
but it was indoors.
   The family is among the better-housed on the island.
   The poorer housing is low, tarpaper-covered, wooden huts whose
residents draw water from wells or standpipes. Outdoor privy toilets
are common. Few streets are paved in the hilly town.
   Chinchikov said he loved the wildness of the volcanic island,
which has such abundant nature that visitors may be served bear stew
and home-smoked salmon.
   But as an artist, he said, ``the main problem is the lack of
contact with the rest of the world.''
   That may change now that the Soviet government wants foreign
tourists to come to the formerly off-limits region.
   Living standards will change by the end of the century,
Vyacheslav Gudakov, deputy chairman of the town government, said as
he conducted a tour featuring an almost-completed new hospital.
   Streets will be paved, he said, and comfortable apartments will
be built, as well as a new school, culture center and department
store.
   The rich fishery of Kunashir and nearby Shikotan Island earns 70
million rubles ($108 million) a year for the central government,
while Moscow sends back only half that money, Gudakov said.
   ``Now we have a very funny system,'' the Soviet interpreter
interjected wryly.
   Gudakov said new regulations soon will let the local government
decide how to use most of its revenues.
   Asked if Moscow had neglected the island outpost 5,000 miles from
the capital, Gudakov replied, ``It was the same in all the country.''

   Here are some milestones in the changing ownership of Sakhalin
and the Kuril Islands:
   EARLY HISTORY _ Sakhalin was probably first explored by the
Chinese. Russian and Japanese explorers and traders reached Sakhalin
in the 17th century. By 1739 Russians had plotted the Kurils, coming
into conflict with Japanese who traded and fished in the islands,
then peopled by the Ainu, the aboriginal people of northern Japan.
   1855 _ In the first diplomatic agreement between Russia and
Japan, the two agreed to jointly settle Sakhalin, and Japan was
given ownership of the Kuril Islands just north of Hokkaido _
Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and the Habomai group. Czarist Russia got
title to the rest of the Kurils.
   1875 _ Russia ceded all the Kurils to Japan in exchange for
ownership of Sakhalin.
   1905 _ After Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, a treaty
gave Japan the southern part of Sakhalin, up to the 50th parallel.
Japan later imported up to 80,000 forced laborers from Korea, then a
Japanese colony; they and their descendants are a sizable minority
today on Sakhalin, which is called Karafuto in Japanese.
   1945 _ The Soviet Union declared war Aug. 8, two days after the
first U.S. atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and Soviet troops
swept into southern Sakhalin and through the Kurils. Several hundred
thousand Japanese civilians later were evacuated to Japan.
   1956 _ In negotiations establishing diplomatic relations, the
Soviets offered to return Shikotan and the Habomai group to Japan
after the conclusion of a World War II peace treaty between the two
countries. Moscow later withdrew the offer, on grounds that the
United States has military bases in Japan aimed at the Soviet Union.
   1989 _ Negotiations on a peace treaty remain stuck over Moscow's
rejection of Japan's demand for a return of the southern Kurils.
Japan does not claim southern Sakhalin, but does not recognize
Soviet ownership.

   After a traumatic decade of defeats in battle with
Margaret Thatcher, British labor unions are flexing their muscles
again.
   In some ways, this summer's spate of strikes has been reminiscent
of the years before Mrs. Thatcher was elected prime minister in May
1979 on a wave of anti-union sentiment.
   But in crucial other ways, they reflect a recognition that the
old days of militancy and unbridled power, which was partly to blame
for infecting the economy with the so-called ``British disease,''
are over.
   Strikes this summer in public transportation, city halls and the
British Broadcasting Corp. ended with employers surrendering on all
fronts: yielding near double-digit pay raises and abandoning demands
for higher productivity and new bargaining procedures.
   But dockworkers striking to preserve a 42-year-old system of job
guarantees were soundly defeated.
   The longshoremen were the last of the once-mighty blue-collar
battalions of organized labor to be vanquished by a Conservative
government that had already emasculated the steel, coal-mining and
newspaper-production unions.
   The public could see a case for giving railwaymen and town hall
clerks pay increases that overtake resurging inflation. But it would
not buy the longshoremen's attempt to preserve what it saw as a
relic of union featherbedding.
   The unions have learned to play by the Thatcher rules, among the
toughest in any Western democracy, and even to turn them to
advantage.
   ``It's been a very difficult 10 years for the trade union
movement, but it hasn't been deadly,'' said Norman Willis, general
secretary of the Trades Union Congress, the national labor
federation. ``Anyone who thought the unions could be written off was
wrong.''
   Laws passed since 1980 ban sympathy walkouts and force unions to
hold secret ballots by members before calling strikes. Unions that
call illegal strikes can be bankrupted by fines for contempt of
court and lawsuits by employers for strike-inflicted losses.
   The rail unions won public sympathy partly because their leaders
followed the rules and could not be accused of foisting their wishes
on the rank-and-file.
   ``Unions have learned to live within the law,'' said the TUC's
Willis.
   Public opinion polls indicate that for the first time in 25
years, most Britons no longer consider the unions too powerful.
   Soundings in September by Gallup and by Market Opinion and
Research International also found majorities sympathizing with this
summer's wage strikes, despite the commuter misery, and blaming the
government, not the unions, for economic problems.
   Fifty-four percent still think the unions are dominated by
``extremists and militants,'' the poll showed. But overall, the
change is profound.
   No longer disliked because they are no longer feared, the unions
have faded as an issue. And the union-bashing that helped Mrs.
Thatcher to three successive election victories, no longer looks
like a vote-puller, now that the unions are being seen as underdogs.
   ``None of this means that the unions are on the offensive,''
cautions Martin Jacques, editor of the monthly Marxism Today. ``What
is does mean is that ... the unions have got their heads above the
parapet again. And for Thatcherism they no longer represent easy
political pickings.''
   The victorious summer strikes have encouraged others, like
ambulance drivers who are citing the railwaymen's increase in an
attempt to justify their demands for a raise above the 8.3 percent
inflation rate.
   With pay settlements averaging 9.5 percent, fears have arisen
that Britain is headed back into the inflationary spiral of the
1970s.
   Both in numbers and political clout, the unions have taken a long
fall from their 1970s heyday, when striking miners helped topple
Prime Minister Edward Heath's Conservative government and when Labor
governments consulted union bosses almost as regularly as Cabinet
ministers.
   The membership of the Trades Union Congress has slumped from 12.2
million to 8.7 million, the lowest in 20 years. In 1979, 29.5
million work days were lost through strikes. Last year, the total
was 3.7 million.
   A record 13 percent unemployment rate in the mid-1980s also
dampened union militancy. And with the 1985 collapse of a year-long
strike by the Marxist-led National Union of Mineworkers, which
directly challenged the Conservative government, the Thatcher
victory seemed complete.
   But while most analysts agree that things will never be the same,
the unions are emerging from the 1980s in fair shape after some
painful adaptations.

   ``The Naked Gun'' (Paramount Home Video. VHS, priced for rental.
Beta, $29.95. Rated PG-13)
   
   When was the last time you had some real fun watching a movie? If
you have to stop and think, then run, don't walk, to your nearest
video store and pick up ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police
Squad.''
   Be prepared for a zany, side-splitting collection of gags _ some
of them off-color and most of them outrageous. And get ready to give
your laugh muscles a workout.
   ``Naked Gun'' is the product of those masters of hilarity, David
Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, who gave us the memorable
``Airplane!'' and the not-so-memorable ``Top Secret!''
   This time they're parodying one of their own failures, the
short-lived TV series ``Police Squad!'', which is currently being
shown on cable-TV.
   Tried and true Leslie Nielsen is back as the unsmiling klutz of
the police world, Lt. Frank Drebin, who smashes police cars into
trash cans, gets his hand stuck in a fish tank and falls over his
own feet in the pursuit of justice. He's wonderful.
   Drebin, trying to foil a plot on the life of Queen Elizabeth II,
sets off a series of hilarious non-stop gags. Priscilla Presley is
Drebin's romantic interest, Jane Spencer, whose deadpan delivery is
a match for Nielsen's. A scene in which the two practice ``safe
sex'' in body size condoms is typical of the video's giggle power.
   There is a villain, played by a silky Ricardo Montalban, a
bemused sidekick played by George Kennedy and lots of celebrity
cameos as well as a dumpy Queen Elizabeth look-alike.
   There are no messages here, and the story is just an excuse for
some terrific jokes. Call it slapstick. Call it crazy. Call it a hit
video.

   ``Lean on Me'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated PG-13)
   
   Anyone who has ever met Joe Clark, the principal of Eastside High
School in Paterson, N.J., knows that he would never allow a film
crew into his school unless for the greater glory of Joe Clark. This
is, after all, the same Joe Clark who in 1987 virtually barred a
state monitoring team from inspecting his building.
   So it's hardly a surprise that ``Lean on Me,'' a movie shot on
location at Eastside and purporting to be based on the ``true
story'' of the tough principal, turns out to be little more than
blackboard jungle propaganda aimed at vindicating Clark's
bat-and-bullhorn educational methods.
   The video is from Warner Bros., which also made the vastly
superior ``Stand and Deliver,'' a film with twice the plot and a
hundred times more character development. ``Stand and Deliver'' was
about a high school math teacher in a Los Angeles barrio school who
proved that inner city kids respond to the same kinds of positive
things that rich kids do: adults who really care.
   Clark, by contrast, captured headlines in recent years as the
principal who restored order to an inner-city school described by
local prosecutors as a ``cauldron of violence.''
   He prowled the hallways with a baseball bat and bullhorn,
suspended hundreds of students, and made it clear to all that the
sign in his office, ``One Way: My Way,'' applied to teachers and
students alike.
   ``Lean on Me,'' starring Academy Award nominee Morgan Freeman,
paints Clark as a principal who bleeds for his kids, but will stop
at nothing, including breaking labor and fire laws, cursing out his
superiors and humiliating teachers, to achieve his aims.
   It opens with a brief shot of Eastside High in more idyllic days.
In 1967, the school was mostly white; boys wore ties. Clark, then a
young teacher, wore a dashiki.
   Twenty years later, we see a very different Eastside, with
graffiti covering anything standing still long enough to be
spray-painted, girls openly molested, drugs freely dispensed, fights
commonplace.
   Into the breach steps Clark. His challenge: brush aside the
small-minded politicians and school board, restore order, and raise
standardized test scores quickly enough to avoid a state takeover of
the school.
   Hey, no sweat.
   Freeman turns in a credible performance as Clark, nicely
capturing Clark's self-righteousness. The script by Michael Schiffer
doesn't leave much room for character development. Clark himself had
this to say of Freeman: ``He's a good actor but I don't think
anybody can fully portray me. There's only one Joe Clark.''

   ``Cosmic Thing'' (Reprise) _ The B-52s
   
   Ten years after crashing the world's party with the zany ``Rock
Lobster,'' the B-52s remain intact as _ improbably enough _ a hardy
band of survivors.
   This band of Georgian bohemians transplanted to New York survived
the death of instrumentalist Ricky Wilson and have emerged with
``Cosmic Thing,'' this year's comeback LP.
   ``Cosmic Thing'' is an amiable collection of danceable rock tunes
anchored, as usual, by Fred Schneider's deadpan vocals and the more
accomplished singing of Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson.
   At their best, the B-52s sound like they're inviting listeners to
a real cool private party where everyone's a friend. ``Deadbeat
Club'' and ``Love Shack,'' two of this record's strongest cuts,
beckon fans to out-of-the-way places with great jukeboxes and
25-cent beers.
   Even the B-52s politics are toe-tapping: The slyly titled
``Bushfire'' condemns the burning of South American rain forests.
   The mood is far better than on 1986's downbeat ``Bouncing Off the
Satellites,'' which featured the band soldiering through songs
Wilson left half-finished before his death. Blessedly, producers
Nile Rodgers and Don Was employ live drummers, avoiding the drum
machines that made past songs sound like nervous breakdowns.
   And yet, like so many records these days, it all seems like a
triumph of form over substance. Some of these party tunes have all
the bite of day-old champagne. What does a one-joke band do when the
laughter dies down and the record contract remains?
   The answer, of course, is repeat the joke and hope someone who
wasn't around the first time is listening.

   ``Maria McKee'' (Geffen) _ Maria McKee
   
   In an effective solo debut, singer Maria McKee draws a picture of
romantic longing and world weariness surprising for a woman of only
24 years.
   The former leader of the now-dissolved country rockers Lone
Justice, McKee packs a huge voice into a small body. That voice is
the centerpiece of a melancholic album that comes closer to
realizing McKee's talents than either of Lone Justice's two records.
   The trio of opening songs _ ``I've Forgotten What It Was in You
(That Put the Need in Me),'' ``To Miss Someone'' and ``Am I the Only
One (Who Ever Felt This Way)'' _ dutifully record romantic longing
without lapsing into comic self-pity.
   McKee displays her singing power with the rocker ``Can't Pull the
Wool Down (Over the Little Lamb's Eyes)'' and the gospel song ``More
Than a Heart Can Hold.''
   Though McKee is backed by several studio pros better known than
she, producer Mitchell Froom wisely lets her voice carry the show.
The backing is supportive and largely anonymous, with the exception
of some twisted guitar work by Marc Ribot.
   The sour notes seem the result of caring too much, rather than
too little. ``Panic Beach,'' a tale of aging vaudevillians playing
out the string, is both overwrought and overwritten (``And the dying
swan pirouettes and fawns by the light of the street lamp moon'').
McKee's voice is overly mannered on the Richard Thompson cover,
``Has He Got a Friend for Me?''
   McKee also sets some sort of record for Longest Song Titles of
the Year (With Annoying Parentheticals, Too).
   One consumer note: This record's best song can't be found on the
LP. The CD-only cut ``Drinkin' in My Sunday Dress'' is an inspired
piece of lunacy where a bawdy McKee is lectured by her preacher,
``Just remember who's beside you when it's no business of mine.''
This song, plus the CD-accentuated spaces of silence Froom builds
around McKee's voice, makes the compact disc the best bet for those
who have a choice.

   Shirley Valentine has her moment of blossoming in
the new film with that title, and Pauline Collins had hers at
Montreal's 13th annual World Film Festival.
   Of the 250 movies from 52 countries shown at the 10-day festival,
Paramount's ``Shirley Valentine'' was chosen for the premiere at the
Theatre Maisonneuve of the Place des Arts.
   At the reception afterward, Collins was the center of attention,
a new experience for the pert, round-faced mother of four, making
her film debut in the new movie.
   ``It was very traumatic to see the film for the first time,'' the
English actress observed in an interview after the screening.
   ``I tried to detach myself and sit back and enjoy the film. I
tried to pretend it was somebody else up there and not me. Maybe
because it's 3 o'clock in the morning for me right now, I can feel
that way. (She had flown from London that morning.)
   ``What is curious is to come to the film having done the play
recently; I only finished on Broadway eight weeks ago. Some things
have changed, and sometimes my ear would say, `Oh that's different.'
But I really enjoyed it, especially the Greek part. All that
beautiful water.''
   Collins performed ``Shirley Valentine'' four months in London,
winning the Olivier award for best actress in a new play. In New
York, she was awarded the Tony in the play written by Willy Russell,
who provided Julie Waters with a star-making role in ``Educating
Rita.''
   ``When I first read the play, I thought it was a very long
speech,'' she recalled. ``Then I discovered that it was all one
speech! Nobody told me I would be on stage alone for the whole
play.''
   Shirley Valentine-Bradshaw is a middle-age English housewife with
a distant husband and two grown, spoiled children. Out of boredom
she talks to the wall in the kitchen where she prepares meals
between sips of wine. Her life changes when a woman friend invites
her to share a contest prize, a trip to the Greek islands. There she
meets a cafe owner, Costas, who changes her life.
   In the play, Collins created Shirley as well as 29 other
characters. The movie, adapted by Russell and directed by Lewis
Gilbert (``Alfie,'' ``Educating Rita''), supplies other actors,
including Tom Conti as a kind of laidback Zorba.
   ``Tom and I did a play together, `Romantic Comedy,''' Collins
remarked. ``And we're neighbors; our daughters go to the same
school. Tom and I work very easily together. First of all, we trust
each other a lot. And we laugh a lot.''
   In the film, Shirley and Costas take a boat cruise and skinny-dip
in a secluded cove. Collins declined an offer by director Gilbert to
use a body double.
   ``It's not a big deal in Europe, nudity,'' she explained. ``Most
people are nude or semi-nude on the beaches. People don't wear tops
there anymore. My only qualms were that I wished I was younger and
thinner (giggle). But I ain't.''
   Nonetheless she is attractive at 49, with mischievous eyes and
apple cheeks. She was born near Liverpool of a family of Irish poets
and teachers. She initially decided to be a teacher, then shifted to
acting.
   ``I started out at the Theater Royal Windsor, which is where the
royal family have their country seat,'' she said. ``I've done 15-16
plays in the West End and lots of television series, many of them
with my husband, John Alderton. American viewers know him from
`Upstairs, Downstairs'; he was the chauffeur. And I was the
downstairs maid.
   ``I didn't start early as an actress; I was 22 when I began. Most
of the peaks in my a career have been rather late. `Upstairs,
Downstairs' came when I was 30. Until that year I hadn't earned much
money. That year I earned 1,200 pounds. So I was in the money _ at
30.''
   Collins admitted that she wasn't the first choice for the film
version of ``Shirley Valentine.''
   ``Several American actresses were considered by Paramount because
I have no track record; nobody knew me from Adam _ or Eve,'' she
said. ``About five Paramount people flew to London to see me in the
play, and they began to think they might have me in the film. And
aren't I lucky?''
   Lucky enough to be predicted for an Academy Award nomination, as
some reviewers of ``Shirley Valentine'' have suggested.
   ``I've heard that, and it's very breathtaking,'' she said,
``especially for someone who has just embarked on a film career.''
   Already she has received offers for American roles, but she
doesn't think she's right for them. ```Shirley Valentine' is a tough
act to follow,'' she commented, adding with a giggle, ``Maybe I
should retire.''

<TEXT>
   An elderly woman tugs on her
husband's arm outside a house in this world-renowned artists' haven
and says, ``Do you think anyone famous lives there?''
   Welcome to Worpswede, where mobs of tourists roam quaint little
streets hoping for a glimpse of big-name artists while their elusive
quarry hole up inside studios guarding their solitude.
   Worpswede _ home to about 150 painters, sculptors, poets and
other sorts who live by their creative talents _ is celebrating its
100th year as a year-round artists' colony.
   Artists and affluent commuters live in the little town about 16
miles north of Bremen, with its quaint old stone homes and
tree-lined streets. A number of lesser-known artists and craftsmen _
from glassblowers to weavers to painters _ operate their own
galleries, and some give lessons to supplement their incomes.
   Placid canals that were once used by area traders flow through
the moorland fields outside the village limits.
   The anniversary has already drawn about a quarter of a million
people and armies of reporters and television crews, who have
overrun this northern village of 8,000.
   ``There are some who come here who know the history of Worpswede
and why it's important to art,'' says village manager Guenther
Wellbrock. ``But there are many expecting to find a theme park, or
they just think it's a nice place to drink coffee.''
   Worpswede has sheltered some of Germany's best-known artists,
from turn-of-the-century painter Paula Modersohn-Becker to
modern-day sculptor Waldemar Otto, whose works are known around the
world. Famed poet Rainer Maria Rilke also spent much time here.
   It boasts 15 art galleries, art lessons for amateurs, pricey
boutiques, cafes, souvenir shops hawking everything from incense to
neckties, and an astrologer who also gives vacation tips. The town
also has open-air cafes, several small hotels and, of course, art
supply stores.
   On Worpswede's 100th birthday, German news media have described
it as a place where ``art and tackiness meet.''
   Wellbrock says many tourists expect a close encounter with
artistic geniuses. ``There is this naive idea that anyone can go see
how the artists work. But these artists don't see themselves as
being like their works, as exhibition objects.''
   Otto, who has had major exhibitions in New York and other U.S.
cities, says he does not feel threatened by intrusive tourists.
   His house, concealed by thick bushes, is on a hill overlooking
Worpswede center. There is nothing to indicate that it's the home of
a famous artist.
   ``Worpswede is such a good place to work because it still has a
lot of its small-town qualities,'' said Otto, standing amid a sea of
sculpted human figures in his studio.
   His studio has a cathedral ceiling, gleaming white walls and is
as large in area as his house, to which it is attached. Many
unfinished sculptures of human figures and heads sit atop work
benches, and his tools are strewn around the room. A life-size
plaster figure dangled from a block-and-tackle connected to the
ceiling.
   He is known for works that portray humans trapped by anonymity or
pressures in modern-day life. Just outside his studio is a life-size
bronze sculpture of a scrawny, faceless man desperately trying to
squeeze his way past two enormous walls.
   Otto says he has a special fondness for the natives. ``Artists
have been here for 100 years. The residents are used to being around
crazy people.''
   But artist Verena Vernunft, who now lives in Hamburg, has harsh
words for her former home. ``I don't like tourist places, and
Worpswede has tourists on every corner,'' she said.
   A number of artists are in Worpswede on stipends from private
organizations such as the Barkenhoff Foundation, which chooses
promising young painters, sculptors and others and provides them
with room and board for a six-month stay. Many work and reside at
the Barkenhoff, Heinrich Vogeler's majestic former residence and
studio. Vogeler, one of Germany's best-known art nouveau
practicioners, went to Worpswede in 1893 and moved into the palatial
residence called the Barkenhoff.
   More than half the artists, including Otto, have permanent
residences in Worpswede.
   Some of Worpswede's better-known artists are also university
professors. Otto, for example, has been a guest professor at the
University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind.
   Worpswede was just an anonymous little farming village in the
north German moorland until three artists took up residence in 1889.
Fritz Mackensen, Otto Modersohn and Hans am Ende were mesmerized by
the beauty of the countryside and recreated it on canvas. Others
followed, such as Paula Becker, who married Modersohn in 1901.
   The Barkenhoff was the scene of evening songfests, artistic
discussions, open-air plays, and readings by Rilke. It is now a
shrine for thousands of tourists who visit every year.
   But Worpswede has its tragic side as well.
   Vogeler and his wife became estranged at a time when he was
struggling with uncertainty about his artistic direction. Depressed
and disoriented, he joined the German army at the start of World War
I. He returned to Worpswede an ardent communist. He was harassed for
his beliefs and closely watched by anti-communist informants. He
fled to the Soviet Union in the 1930s and died there a disillusioned
man in 1942.
   He is now revered as one of Worpswede's greatest talents.
   Paula Modersohn-Becker was also a tragic personality. She
eventually found Worpswede, and marriage, artistically stifling and
began spending long stretches of time in Paris.
   She died in Worpswede during childbirth in 1907 at age 31.
Despite scant recognition during her lifetime, she is now considered
a pioneer in modern German painting.

   Stevie Ray Vaughan had all the makings of a blues
legend: a kid from Texas practicing the moves in front of a mirror;
overnight success; comparisons to Jimi Hendrix, B.B. King and Eric
Clapton; the last of the guitar heros playing his heart out.
   Only one part remained for Vaughan, 34, to complete the story,
join Hendrix, Robert Johnson, Mike Bloomfield and others by dying
young. Three years ago, he nearly did.
   ``This might sound funny, but fortunately I collapsed,'' said
Vaughan, who named his new album, ``In Step,'' after the ``12
Steps'' program used by recovering alcoholics.
   ``In a sense, I knew this thing was coming, I knew I couldn't
keep going the way it was. I had a nervous breakdown, I was throwing
up blood, the whole thing. I had not been able to obtain any drugs
for about two weeks, but the drinking was still going on. If I was
awake I was guzzling something,'' he said.
   ``We'd been touring, doing all kinds of things. I went through a
divorce; I couldn't write during that. I wanted to, but divorces are
sick. People don't treat people like people. Lawyers get together
and try to trick each other.''
   The first steps of ``12 Steps'' _ modesty, a sense of limits _
were once a million miles away for Vaughan. On and off stage, he
felt invincible, the baddest kid on the block.
   He could play anything, cover any song, and write his own as
well. From the swirling, Hendrix-like guitar that kicked off his
1983 debut album, ``Texas Flood,'' Vaughan was a sensation, a
throwback to rock's simpler days. Music magazines honored him, so
did the Grammys, making Vaughan an almost automatic nomination for
best rock instrumental.
   ``I didn't know what Grammys were growing up,'' he said. ``The
radio I listen to has more to do with soul stations that don't
necessarily play all the new stuff. I don't really care to get into
any formula: `If you play the game our way, we'll play your stuff.'
''
   Those first records, in every way, were a blur. Vaughan and his
band, Double Trouble, quickly followed his debut album with
``Couldn't Stand the Weather,'' ``Soul to Soul'' and ``Live Alive,''
all gold sellers.
   Unafraid of comparisons, Vaughan covered Hendrix's ``Voodoo
Chile,'' Buddy Guy's ``Mary Had a Little Lamb'' and Willie Dixon's
``You'll Be Mine.'' The slow songs _ Jimmy Reed's ``Tin Pan Alley,''
Vaughan's own ``Lenny'' _ were a release, temporary mercy, a long
sigh of relief.
   He lived and breathed the blues, and almost died.
   ``I thought I was real cool because I was higher than you and you
didn't know what you're missing. I was aware I had many big
problems, I could not stop and didn't know how,'' he said.
   ``I was addicted to people that I wasn't treating like people. I
was treating people like drugs, too. If there was somebody that
would put up with anything, that was fine. Luckily, there were
people who still cared.''
   Now preaching sobriety in his private life, Vaughan still
worships the blues on record. For ``In Step,'' he covers Howlin'
Wolf's ``Love Me Darlin','' Buddy Guy's ``Leave My Girl Alone,'' and
Willie Dixon's ``Let Me Love You Baby,'' drawing material from his
substantial record collection.
   ``They're like my books, like my school,'' Vaughan said. ``You
put it on and it hits you. It's always been that way.
   ``I can take just about any one of my records and if something
about the way they play or sing gets a hold of me, I'll try to find
what they did. I'll wrestle with myself playing their stuff for a
while and I'll absorb it into my own sound.''
   He ends ``In Step'' with ``Riviera Paradise,'' a lengthy jazz
instrumental he wrote in 1984.
   ``It's an extension of sorts of the same style as `Lenny.' In my
heart and in my mind, they were written for the same reason, to
soothe. It had to come out at the end of the record, I couldn't see
any other place for it, really.''
   Vaughan, who once dreamed of playing like bluesman Albert King,
now finds himself being approached by young guitarists, all just
beginning their own stories.
   ``Some of them want to know technical things, some of them want
to know what to do, how to go about getting a record deal. I can
just tell them who I listen to, what I did,'' he said.
   ``I remember when the biggest thing in my life was getting to
meet B.B. King. I thought, in my mind, it was not only important for
me, but important for him. I had all this confidence. It was
incredible seeing somebody who was such a gentleman. I've been so
fortunate to meet all these people.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Glories of the Storyteller</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than three decades, author Allan
Gurganus can still remember seating charts from first grade: front
to back, right to left. It's a writer's gift, he insists, a
wonderful asset.
   Another gift for the 42-year-old writer is mimicry, the ability
to assume the voice and experiences of another. In 1981, Gurganus
read a story about 19 women still on the pension payroll as widows
of Confederate soldiers. A character took shape in his head:
99-year-old Lucy Marsden.
   Gurganus was soon writing in the voice of Lucy, who talks to a
young reporter from a nursing home in Falls, N.C. She's offering
history, an occasional fib mixed in, with the wink of an eye no
longer able to see.
   Lucy was drawing on Gurganus' experiences, and for both author
and subject, survival became the key to ``Oldest Living Confederate
Widow Tells All'' (Knopf, $21.95).
   ``I wanted the book to be a collaboration so the reader is
implicated,'' Gurganus said. ``The reader feels he has to come back
to hear the rest of the story and also come back to keep Lucy alive.
The suspense of whether she can, in fact, finish telling the story
before she runs out of time is a subtext.''
   ``Confederate Widow'' is 718 pages of stories, legends, anecdotes
and folk wisdom. Holding everything together is the voice of Lucy,
amiably spinning yarns that reach back more than 100 years.
   ``I've always been a storyteller and storylistener,'' said
Gurganus, who grew up in Rocky Mount, N.C. ``I think the bargain of
stories is you know how to hear them and know how to tell them. Like
musicians listening to each other, great storytellers never
interrupt each other.''
   Lucy's voice seems set to music. The sentence rhythms sing with
her unique inflections and cadences, like a rustic country ballad.
The author read his book aloud several times, making sure the
writing had perfect pitch.
   ``I've always thought the ear is the best possible editor. I love
jazz, improvising on a theme. I can imagine four crystal goblets and
one plastic goblet. Four of them ping and one doesn't. Editing is
this perpertual weeding out of the one that does not ping.
   ``It's a great title of a hymn, `Some Things Always Sing.' I'm
going to use it as a title of a novel. If it sings, it's true.''
   Some facts about Lucy: She grew up in Falls; at 15 she married
Captain William Marsden, 36 years her senior; her best friend was
Castalia Marsden, an ex-slave; she had nine children and outlived
them all.
   Some facts about Gurganus: he went to the University of
Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts; he was
drafted by the Army during the Vietnam War, but chose to serve in
the Navy instead, getting out in 1970; he went to the Iowa Writers'
Workshop in 1973 and became close friends with John Cheever.
   His first short story was published in 1974 and Gurganus taught
at Stanford and Duke universities before moving to New York in 1978.
He currently teaches at Sarah Lawrence College.
   Truths, however, matter more _ for Lucy and for Gurganus. Events
in ``Confederate Widow'' are seen through mirrors, distorting but
also enlightening. Lucy's stories are really myths, facts filtered
through memory and time that touch upon universal experiences.
   ``I think part of the equipment of the writer is to be a
professional rememberer,'' the author said. ``An invented memory.
You make up one thing, and if that's true, then six other things
will come with it.
   ``I wanted to investigate the beauty of memory and the faults of
memories. I wanted a kind of doubleness. I'm very interested in the
Old Testament and I'm very interested in Grimm fairy tales. I see
this book as an enormous fairy tale, a morality tale about true
things.''
   Chapters mirror each other as well. In ``Black, White and
Lilac,'' Lucy recalls ``Lady'' Marsden, the Captain's mother, whose
dream world is shattered when Union soldiers burn down her mansion
while freed slaves taunt their ex-master.
   In ``The Tribe That Answers,'' Castalia and other Africans are
lured onto a slave ship, unaware of what awaits them in America. On
board, the elderly Miss Reba insists that they will be welcomed as
heroes, valued for their wisdom and experience. Hauled in front of
slave owners bidding for her services, Reba tragically still sees
herself as visiting royalty, unaware of laughter hissing from the
audience.

<TEXT>
   ```I plans and go slow at first,' her cried, crackly yet loud as
she could. `Starting off might seem real hard. But then, one day,
just like things done, dawned on Reba here you gone see what-all we
come to teach ... Tribe's lessons bout to break over you heads like
so many rare red birds' eggs full of that.
   `You gone to say, `So it that!' Then you sure will laugh. Even
took your old Reba here a day of six to see you reasons for toting
us on on over here.'''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   When Reba finishes, two young whites carry her away on a
stretcher. Nobody wants this crazy, old woman.
   ``To have your values and your wisdom unheard is the most
terrible fate,'' Gurganus said. ``In Lucy, I wanted to create a
witness to history, somebody who was always present but never
central. Not beautiful, not well-educated, and yet terribly
observant, terribly intelligent and terribly greedy for
information.''
   Gurganus, like fellow Southern writers Eudora Welty and Flannery
O'Connor, appreciates the value of a ``freak,'' and always seeks to
find magic in the lives of people otherwise forgotten.
   ``In plantation days, when people got together, they sat down and
talked and talked and talked and talked. The good things became
better and the worse things became worse.
   ``Now, you see an old guy at the service station with no teeth,
no means of support and sweat stains on his hat. He just sits on a
Coca-Cola crate all day. Yet he's a genius talker and people
gravitate to him and ask questions and ask for stories to be
repeated.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Lee Greenwood a White House Favorite</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Singer Lee Greenwood, who wrote the
patriotic song ``God Bless the USA,'' has performed at the White
House four times, and has become one of President Bush's favorite
entertainers.
   Greenwood, the Country Music Association's male vocalist of the
year in 1983 and 1984, was also a favorite of former President
Reagan. The singer's popularity at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue carried
over into the Bush administration. He spent Easter weekend with Bush
at Camp David.
   ``God Bless the USA'' was used extensively by Reagan during the
1984 presidential campaign. Greenwood also sang it at Bush campaign
appearances in the 1988 campaign, and also performed it at various
inauguration events.
   During his Easter weekend with Bush, Greenwood recalled seeing
some of the president's record collection.
   ``He has the Oak Ridge Boys, Loretta Lynn, I believe George
Strait and myself,'' he said. ``The tapes I saw at Camp David were
just those acts. I didn't see any others; there was nothing but
country music and just those selected artists.''
   The 1983 ``God Bless the USA'' salutes those who have died
defending the United States, and cites American pride.
   As a result of the song, Greenwood also has become a top act at
military bases. He has performed on four USO tours, including an
eight-day tour around the world with comedian Bob Hope in 1987. At
the request of the White House, Greenwood will do another one this
Christmas.
   Greenwood, a native of Los Angeles, was born to parents who split
up when he was a year old. He was raised by his grandparents on a
small chicken farm near Sacramento, Calif., and was a member of the
rock 'n' roll group the Young Rascals before they became famous.
   He spent about 10 years as a casino dealer and performer in Las
Vegas until becoming a country music star in the early 1980s.
   ``I was raised without much money,'' the 46-year-old singer said
in an interview at his Nashville office. ``To raise to the height of
being honored at the residence of the head of state says a lot for
this country and the system. It's a great honor for me.''
   ``I'm lucky, I guess,'' he said. ``It says a lot about America to
be able to work into that position.''
   His other hit records include ``IOU,'' ``Dixie Road,'' ``You've
Got a Good Love Coming,'' ``It Turns Me Inside Out'' and ``Ring on
Her Finger, Time on Her Hands.''
   Blessed with a husky voice and driving ambition, he won a Grammy
award for ``IOU.'' ``God Bless the USA'' was voted song of the year
by the CMA in 1985.
   Greenwood said ``God Bless the USA'' has outpaced other aspects
of his career. Reagan once said the song ``lifted the spirit of
America to a new place it had never been before.''
   ``It stands so high above everything else I've done,'' Greenwood
said. ``It is a powerful piece of material and it's almost
impossible for me to do a show without it. We're a very difficult
act to follow just because of that piece of material.''
   Earlier this year, he issued a revised version, ``God Bless
Canada,'' changing the lyrics to salute Canada. Larry Gatlin and the
Gatlin Brothers, three of his country music counterparts, sang
harmony.
   Greenwood, looking to expand his career further, is now turning
to movies. He plans to be involved in three motion pictures, acting
in two and writing songs for all three. The first is ``Stranglehold:
Delta Force II,'' starring Chuck Norris. The other two are a Civil
War movie and a film about the Vietnam war. He said he will have
limited roles in the last two.
   ``I'm under no pressure to be a great actor,'' Greenwood said.

   There's a retreat tucked away in the Green Mountains at Ludlow,
Vt., where overweight women go to swear off diets forever.
   The retreat, named Green Mountain at Fox Run, isn't a luxury fat
farm. But it does have something many others don't: a 54 percent
success rate among its ``graduates'' who have maintained their
weight loss or lost more.
   The women, most of them professionals who had been locked into
high-pressure, high-calorie lives, are attacking their weight
problems by learning how their metabolism works and why their diets
don't.
   Then they demonstrate the principle to themselves by eating
``real'' food and working it off by jogging, biking, hiking,
swimming or hitting tennis balls. They unlearn what the co-director,
Dr. Alan H. Wayler, calls the ``all-or-nothing diet mentality.'' And
importantly, they learn how to keep using this knowledge after they
go back home.
   ``Dieting is passive,'' says Wayler. ``To lose weight, you really
need to take active steps. Put on your shorts and your T-shirt and
get out and go.''
   The women are grounded in the basic physiology of metabolism, or
the efficiency of the body in burning fuel. They find out why
exercise is the key to its maintenance. They learn how stress,
psychology and social pressure affect their weight. And, says
Wayler, they learn the bottom line: diets don't work.
   ``The problem is metabolically based. Dieting actually may make
people fat,'' says Wayler, who with his mother, Thelma J. Wayler,
founded and runs the retreat.
   ``Your body says to itself,`I'm starving,' and uses the hunger to
protect itself,'' Wayler says. When you give up or go off the diet,
the body responds by trying to make up for what it sensed it lost _
hence the ``yo-yo'' dieter's syndrome.
   A more rational approach is called for, he says. ``People need to
understand that the changes they make should be reasonable, simple,
and easily attainable.''
   Both Waylers are nutritional experts _ he is a specialist in
nutritional biochemistry and metabolism and an assistant professor
at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine and the Harvard Medical
School, and she is a former assistant nutrition professor at Long
Island University's department of nursing and author of several
nutrition textbooks.
   Wayler says they stress being healthy over being thin and being
realistic instead of idealistic.
   ``You may be looking for the perfect diet, but there is no
`perfect.' You have to say to yourself, `I'm not perfect. I'm me.'
   ``And you get to the point where you say, `To hell with my
weight. I'm going to get healthy.'''
   He says all people should try to work exercise into daily
activity and avoid weekend athletic heroics, which can result in
injury. At minimum, they should be exercising in some way three days
a week. They can't maintain good physical condition with less.
   Citybound people can find ways to exercise, he adds. Just
learning to walk from one place to the next helps. Health studios
that open early before work are another possibility. The people who
have been to the Green Mountain retreat have learned body
conditioning routines that can be used anywhere.
   ``We started Green Mountain at Fox Run (in 1973) because there
was all this new information from research about nutrition becoming
available but of very little benefit to people. Nobody had a way of
translating it to practical use,'' Wayler says.
   The typical session is four weeks, though ``alumnae'' sometimes
return for shorter periods to regain momentum or work out specific
problems.
   The Waylers' program is directed at women. He says that women are
usually more pro-active, more observant, and more willing to learn,
while men tend to be re-active, only making changes after something
like a heart attack scare. ``The woman is the educator in the
family. By teaching her, you'll be teaching others.''
   The Green Mountain retreat _ the Waylers call it ``an educational
community for weight and health management'' _ offers its
participants the chance to analyze what it is in their lives that's
causing their weight problems and then to take command and manage
them.
   ``They establish priorities, and health has to be a priority,''
says Wayler. ``It's a tradeoff. They realize they can't have it
all.''

   The numbers are growing louder, even as the sound
fades for more noise-battered Americans, most of them of working age.
   An estimated 22 million Americans currently have hearing losses,
according to the Better Hearing Institute.
   Over the next 25 years, 28 percent of all working age people in
the country will have lost part of their hearing, if estimates by
the National Institute on Aging are on target.
   ``The instance of hearing loss in the workplace is increasing for
a number of reasons. Our environment is noisy. People are living
longer, and they're retiring later,'' says Nancy B. Nadler, Director
of Career Counseling and Job Placement Services at the New York
League for the Hard of Hearing.
   Moreover, the noise contributing to the problem is pervasive in
the workplace, says Dr. Jane Madell, director of audiology at the
League. ``There are air conditioners, telephones ringing, people
talking, typewriters and Xerox machines. These are not at levels
above the limit, but they are factors above communication level.''
Federal law sets an 85 decibel limit for the workplace. The League
and similar organizations around the country work with hearing
impaired employees and their employers to help them cope with this
increasingly common disability.
   Ignorance about how to go about it is shared by employer and
employee alike, Ms. Nadler says. The individual must learn to be
more assertive about his needs, while his managers need to know more
about how to meet them.
   There are, she says, few things that hard of hearing people can't
do in the workplace, and employers in most cases can easily
accommodate them.
   Amplified phones and location of desks away from noisy areas are
examples. Slightly restructuring the job so that someone else
answers the phone is another.
   But these sometimes have to be pointed out to the employer.
   ``Don't assume that your supervisors are not providing support
for you because they don't want to. It may be that they don't know
what is needed,'' she says.
   She advises the employee to speak up for changes in office
arrangements. If the employee needs a piece of equipment, such as a
gain handset for the phone, he can find out model numbers and costs
and pass that information to the supervisor for approval and action.
If there is excessive noise in the work area, the employee should
say so and ask to be moved away from it.
   The job search for the hearing impaired person is much the same
as for others, except that every step of the way may be affected by
the impairment.
   Self-doubt is an early stumbling block she sees often. The
beginner may think he will be excluded from many occupations and
doesn't even know what to aim for. Another obstacle along the way
may be the simple problem of using the phone to make an interview
appointment. Then there is question of how early in the job search
to reveal the impairment.
   ``Just think how nervous any person is when he goes for an
interview. Imagine how it is for the hearing impaired person with
these other fears.''
   An established employee has another set of fears _ losing his
job, being demoted, or not being promoted. He may try to hide the
impairment, withdrawing from natural interaction in meetings and
with other employees. He risks being marked as unmotivated and
passive.
   Both on the job and in a job search, the best approach is to be
open, Ms. Nadler says. While she advises against putting this
information on a resume or covering letter _ since it's personal _
she says the hearing impaired person should bring it up during the
interview. She points out that the employer legally can't ask about
it, but the candidate who initiates the subject and outlines
accommodations needed will put the employer at ease and clear the
air at the outset.
   New and established employees can help educate their managers
about the impairment's impact with the help of organizations like
the League or Self Help for the Hard of Hearing (SHHH), a national
group with local chapters across the country. The League runs
ongoing workshops for hearing impaired employees and counsels
employers as well.
   Ms. Nadler says her role is to help both employee and employer
develop realistic expectations about the options and limits imposed
by the impairment. Then, armed with knowledge and helped with
hearing aids and other devices, they can mimimize its impact and
explore potential instead.

   Technology and medicine are coming to the aid of hearing impaired
and deaf people with cochlear implant surgery, FM or infrared
transmitters, and improved hearing aids.
   Perhaps the most exotic is the ``bionic ear,'' or cochlear
implant, that helps profoundly deaf people hear sound and recognize
speech.
   A tiny receiver is surgically implanted in the bone behind the
ear and electrode channels inserted into the cochlea, or inner ear.
After surgery, the patient is fitted with an externally worn
microphone, transmitter and speech processor. These send sound
through the implants to stimulate nerve fibers, which in turn relay
messages to the brain. The latest version is a 22-channel implant,
which lets the patient to hear a broad range of pitches.
   Cochlear Corp., which manufactures the devices, says 300,000
people in the United States alone could benefit from cochlear
implant technology.
   The system, implantation surgery and follow-up rehabilitation
currently run around $25,000. Insurance plans or Medicaid cover the
cost in many cases.
   Infrared and FM devices have greater range and power than
conventional hearing aids, helpful in public places and meetings and
for television listening. In both types of systems, the user hears
sound through a headphone radio receiver.
   An infrared system pairs a transmitter, connected to a microphone
or directly into a television audio jack, with a headphone worn by
the user. Volume can be adjusted on the headphone without disturbing
neighbors or other viewers. The microphone-type of transmitter also
can be used for room conversation or meetings.
   The same headphone can be worn (or borrowed at the site) at many
theaters, churches, temples, and other public places where infrared
transmitters have been set up. Infrared Listing Systems of New York,
for example, has equipped most theaters and concert halls in New
York and many others across the country. For the consumer who wants
a transmitter and headphone for his own use, costs average about
$125-$150 for each element.
   FM systems have receivers that are custom-tailored to split and
re-form frequencies according to the user's profile. Sound is
transmitted from one other person, a speaker wearing a neck
microphone. This one-on-one connection cuts background noise, making
it a good choice for classroom or meeting use. Cost is approximately
$1,000 for the system.
    Improved circuitry in hearing aids, the most common devices used
by hearing impaired people, has made it possible to get high power
in the small in-the-ear instruments. Many aids have dual-channel
circuitry that balances high- and low-frequency sounds adjusted to
the user's hearing loss profile. The dual-channel processing _ which
splits the frequencies and combines them again in the appropriate
proportion _ helps the wearer distinguish sounds in noisy
environments. Hearing aids have a fairly wide price range _ from
around $400 up to $1,500.
   The user should have a hearing test and consultation with an
audiologist or otolaryngologist before choosing either a hearing aid
or FM system.

   Weight-conscious Americans may be giving themselves short shift
on nutrition, says the Center for Vitamin and Mineral Communications.
   The organization cites a U.S. Department of Agriculture survey of
21,000 people in which not one person got the recommended dietary
allowances (RDAs) of 10 nutrients needed for basic good health.
   The CVMC lists the 10 most needed nutrients, what they do and
where you can get them:
   _ Iron. It helps build healthy blood. An iron deficiency leads to
anemia, meaning blood cannot carry enough oxygen to the body's
cells, leaving you tired, weak and irritable. Best sources for iron
are lean meats, organ meats, green leafy vegetables, nuts, breads,
cereals and eggs. Eating these in combination with a vitamin C
source such as orange juice can help your body absorb more iron from
other foods.
   _ Folacin. It's vital to fetal growth and in making maternal
blood. A woman's blood volume doubles during pregnancy, and her
folacin stores may be depleted quickly if not enough is in her diet.
Folicin is found in leafy green vegetables and organ meats.
Overcooking should be avoided, because folacin is sensitive to heat
and easily destroyed, even with a microwave.
   _ Calcium. A bone and teeth builder, it also helps in blood
clotting, which helps the heart and nervous system work efficiently.
Three out of four women don't get enough calcium, and the deficiency
has been implicated in osteoporosis and high blood pressure. Best
sources are low-fat milk and cheeses, soy products such as tofu, and
broccoli. Cottage cheese, however, is not as rich in calcium as in
other dairy foods.
   _ Zinc. Zinc helps make up many of your body's enzymes that
regulate metabolism and also helps produce hormones for growth,
sexual development, taste, sight, smell and protein building. Recent
research also reveals zinc helps heal wounds and supports immune
functions. Women, the elderly, and vegetarians are most likely to
lack this element. Best sources are oysters, herring, milk and eggs.
Zinc also can be found in whole grains but in less absorbable form.
   _ Water. Water is essential for proper functioning of all cells,
making up two thirds of the body. Choose plain water, juices or
decaffeinated beverages. Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, though
liquid, are dehydrants.
   _ Fiber. Fibers promote digestion and alleviate constipation.
Soluble fiber may help lower blood cholesterol and to a more limited
extent, blood sugars. Best sources are oat bran, legumes such as
dried peas and beans, rice bran, fruits and vegetables. Insoluble
fiber can reduce risk of colorectal and similar cancers and can help
diabetics. Whole grains, especially wheat and rye, some fruits and
vegetables are good sources. To increase fiber in your diet, do so
gradually and drink plenty of liquids. Too much fiber can cause
bloating, cramping and diarrhea.
   _ Beta carotene. Though not a vitamin itself, it can be converted
to vitamin A in the body, essential for night vision, healthy skin,
strong teeth and bones, and immunity. Beta carotene is an
antioxidant which will help protect body cells from damage that can
cause cancer. Foods with beta carotene are easy to spot because of a
characteristic carroty color _ cantaloupe, carrots, sweet potatoes,
winter squash and apricots. It also is found in dark leafy greens.
   _ Vitamin B-6. Along with other B vitamins, this element helps
produce energy in body cells. Its main job is to metabolize
proteins, so how much you need depends on how much protein you eat.
Inadequate B-6 may cause memory loss, lack of energy, irritability,
poor concentration, muscle aches, cold sores and digestive problems.
It's estimated that only 20 percent of all Americans, and only 7
percent of women, get enough of it. Lean meats, whole grains,
legumes, liver, wheat germ, salmon, bananas and sunflower seeds are
sources; these same foods also provide many of the B-complex
vitamins, including niacin, thiamine, B-12, riboflavin, folacin and
others.
   _ Vitamin C. Important for healthy gums, strong bones and teeth,
vitamin C also helps form collagen, the most abundant body protein.
It also is thought to act as an antioxidant, helping protect against
certain types of cancers. Citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes, and red
fruits like cherries and strawberries are good sources.
   _ Magnesium. It's part of every body cell, activating enzymes
that keep the body running smoothly. It also promotes bone growth
and helps the nervous system function. Inadequate magnesium in the
blood can cause abnormalities in the heartbeat called arrhythmias,
muscle cramps and muscle twitching. An estimated 75 percent of the
population _ and 86 percent of women _ fail to meet daily
requirements for magnesium. Sources include soybeans and soy
products, nuts, legumes, and whole grain foods.

   Most Americans want nutritionally sound meals for themselves and
their families but don't have a good enough understanding of
nutrition to do so, according to a survey conducted by the Post
Center for Nutrition and Health.
   The survey asked 1,000 adults what questions they want answered
about nutrition. More than half the responses showed a
misunderstanding or lack of information, and 14 percent reflected a
high level of confusion.
   Virgil Brown, president of the Medlantic Research Foundation and
Post Center advisor, was surprised by the basic level of questions
about cholesterol and thinks that existing information may have
become too technical.
   ``The percentage of fat and saturated fats, as well as the actual
recommendations on cholesterol consumption, are useful to
nutritionists and health professionals but are of little direct help
to most people in the grocery store,'' he says.
   ``While the survey domonstrates an interest in nutrition among
the public, it highlights even more the need to provide clear,
concise information that will enable people to choose a diet that
will contribute to their good health,'' adds Helen Guthrie,
chairperson of the nutrition department at Pennsylvania State
University and another advisor to the Post Center, a division of
Post Cereals.

   Athletic trainer Bob Kersee has called in the
Diet Cops to keep nutritional tabs on his star performers _
Olympians Valerie Brisco, Jackie Joyner Kersee and Roy Martin.
   Diet Cops is the nickname for Specialized Diet Consultants _ in
the persons of Susan Cohen and Carol Saunders _ advising athletes on
optimum diets for performance. And they make weekly field calls to
athletes in training.
   ``Many athletes believe that their burning of calories in
workouts is all that is necessary to control body fat,'' says Cohen.
``The empty calories that some athletes fill their bodies with
cannot repair the muscle injury, bone and joint bruises that most
athletes suffer.''
   She says that the recommended diets are ``nutrient dense,'' with
lots of vitamins and minerals per calorie. The plans call for a 60
percent carbohydrate ratio with little fat and limited protein.
   ``Women athletes tend to eat fewer calories and are more likely
to develop nutritional deficiencies,'' she says.
   Brisco, Martin and the Kersees say the steroid scandal of the
Olympics was the catalyst for them to adopt a rational nutrition
program.
   ``Our medical counsel has demonstrated that steroids build
inherent weakness. What appears as strong muscle is fat and water,''
says Jackie Joyner Kersee. ``Our own timetable with frequent travel
and long workouts makes our eating cycles erratic. We suffer from
too many meals grabbed on the run.''

   Behavior modification _ changing the way you
feel about food and eating _ is a key part of controlling your
weight, says a Cornell nutritionist.
   ``For many people, it means adopting techniques that will help
them eat less without feeling deprived,'' says Christina Stark,
nutritionist with the Cornell Cooperative Extension.
   She says behavior modification, healthful dieting and a regular
exercise program are the three elements of a successful
weight-control plan.
   Keep track of your eating patterns, says Stark, and try to
substitute good eating habits for the bad ones.
   ``Choose one specific behavior that is a problem for you and work
to change that one,'' Stark says. ``Don't try to change too many
things at once or you may just frustrate yourself.''
   If watching television means settling down with a big bowl of
buttered popcorn, for instance, try to eliminate that between-meal
snack, or at least learn to like popcorn without butter and salt.
   If skipping breakfast means leaves you tempted by a mid-morning
doughnut from the office canteen, try bringing a piece of fruit or
whole-wheat bread from home instead.
   If snacking is a problem, try to modify that behavior by deciding
to eat only when seated at a table.
   ``Any changes you make must fit your lifestyle,'' says Stark,
``or they won't help with weight control in the long run.
   ``Don't decide to get more exercise by rowing if you hate to row.
Instead, choose one or more physical activities you like and can
stick with.
   ``And don't pick a diet based on exotic foods that you don't
normally eat.''

   Your resolve to exercise on your own may evaporate after the
first week of your self-designed program. Or perhaps you enjoy the
camaraderie of other exercisers and the convenience of an indoor
environment you can't get rained or snowed out of.
   An exercise studio is probably the answer. But how do you sort
out the legitimate ones from the fly-by-nights?
   Good exercise instructors will be certified and have that
certification posted in the studio, says Molly Fox, an instructor
who runs her own studio in New York City. Look for certificates from
the International Dance and Exercise Association, the Aerobics
Fitness Association of America, or the American College of Sports
Medicine.
   Next, evaluate how well the studio and the instructor fit your
needs. ``There are so many qualifications one should have besides a
certificate,'' she says. Some things to look for:
   _ An instructor who will help you set a realistic fitness goal
and help you achieve it. Even in a class setting, the teacher should
be able to give you some personal coaching.
   _ One who is knowledgeable about the field, keeping abreast of
new information through trade magazines, professional conventions
and attendance at advanced classes with other teachers.
   _ One who pays primary attention to the student, evaluating
performance and giving advice. A good instructor is a good listener
and responds to questions. He or she also will call students by
name, Ms. Fox observes.
   _ An instructor who is well organized, with attention to certain
parts of the overall program on given days.
   _ Versatility and flexibility. Ms. Fox points out that a good
teacher will teach a low impact class differently than a high impact
one, or a body sculpting class differently than a body blaster class.
   _ A teacher who looks and acts the part. He or she should be
healthy and in good shape physically and mentally. ``Teachers should
enjoy what they do and be motivated, not burned out.''
   _ The studio that's clean and has equipment in good condition.
Look for flooring that's safe for exercise and dance _ usually wood,
never concrete.
   _ A program with variety. You should be able to vary your
exercise routine.
   _ A studio that's accessible with classes and workouts scheduled
for your convenience.
   Ms. Fox studied with Jane Fonda in San Francisco before opening
her studio in New York. She's an active member of IDEA and AFAA.

   Remember how your piano teacher told
you to hold an orange in each palm to get you to arch your fingers
correctly over the keys?
   The teacher probably was right. Purdue University researchers
looking for sources of hand pain have discovered that slightly
curving the fingers alleviates joint stress, while playing with
straight or nearly straight fingers parallel to the keyboard is the
most harmful way to play the piano.
   Ben M. Hilberry, professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue,
and graduate student David C. Harding say their research into hand
mechanics may eventually help people in hand-intensive occupations.
Pianists were chosen for their study because their finger movement
is primarily two-dimensional.
   Harding says that knowledge of mechanical dynamics can help
pianists with an alternate treatment for ``overuse syndrome'' hand
pain. Traditionally, the treatment has been to cut down on playing
hours.
   ``They can't practice, or the pain hurts them during a
performance, and for professionals that means their job is on the
line,'' he says.
   The researchers used a special piano calibrated to record the
force of a finger's impact on a key. Video cameras simultaneously
recorded the angle of the finger from the side and above. These data
were analyzed by computer to calculate the forces at each of the
finger joints and tendons.
   Early research with five pianists with different playing
techniques showed vast differences in the amount of stress on the
finger joints. These results led to development of a computer
program to determine finger positions to minimize force on the
joints and tendons.
   ``We started out with the idea of trying to create a tool to
examine this issue,'' Harding says. ``We didn't anticipate being
able to also find the best playing positions to minimize forces on
fingers, but we were able to also accomplish that.'' He notes that
piano teachers, who have traditionally maintained that a curved hand
position is the best playing technique, now have scientific evidence
to back them up.
   The research was aimed primarily at developing a computer program
to analyze differences in technique among pianists and other
musicians. It was suggested by Dr. Kenneth D. Brandt, head of the
Rheumatology Division of Indiana University's School of Medicine and
director of its Performing Arts Medicine program.

   Stylish spike-heeled shoes with pointed toes can seriously damage
your feet.
   So says Dr. John Hunter, associate professor of orthopedic
surgery at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in
Oklahoma City.
   ``Feet already are some of the most used and abused parts of our
body, taking daily wear and tear and other special stresses such as
regular running,'' says Hunter, noting that wearing the wrong shoes
can cause bunions, heel spurs, corns and other serious foot ailments.
   ``I think women abuse their feet more than any other group,
because they tend to wear high-heeled, pointed-toed shoes, the shape
of which is dictated by a fashion designer rather than by their
anatomy.
   ``Lots of women who have feet that just don't fit into this type
of shoe will jam them in anyway, and as they get into middle age
they begin to have problems. It's an especially significant factor
in the development of problems such as bunions, corns and
callouses.''
   Women who want to be stylish but avoid problems should look for
thicker, cushioned soles, a larger toe box, a soft upper, a flexible
forefoot that allows the foot to bend, and, if necessary, room for
arch supports or orthotic inserts, Hunter advises.
   Extra cushioning is particularly important because fat tissues in
the sole waste away as a person ages, he says.
   ``That's one reason people in their 40s and 50s start to develop
callouses when they haven't changed their shoe style or their
lifestyle.''

   Perils of modern life _ staring at your computer screen or
spending long hours on the road _ are sources of damaging stress to
the eyes, according to the American Optometric Association.
   There are simple steps you can take to offset this stress, the
organization says.
   If you spend many of your working hours in front of a video
display terminal, make it a habit to take a 10-minute break every
hour and relax your eyes by looking at something in the distance.
Room lighting should be soft with lamps to provide extra light for
paperwork. Shades, blinds or drapes should be angled to reduce
window glare.
   AOA cites studies that show eyestrain is the most frequent
complaint among office workers and says that poorly designed
workspaces and poor lighting are most often to blame. Eyestrain can
lead to headaches, body aches and irritability.
   Taking breaks while on the road also is advised. Drivers on long
highway trips should stop after the first 200 miles and every 100
miles thereafter.
   Driving at 55 mph requires concentrated focus on a narrow field,
and this can lead to fatigue and ``highway hypnosis.'' To offset
this, periodically focus on objects ahead and blink frequently.
   And, of course, wear sunglasses on bright days.
   The association advises a yearly checkup to detect vision
changes, which can occur subtly without your being aware of them.

   Blindness can catch people unaware, says the American Foundation
for the Blind. Some warning signs can tip you off that something is
wrong:
   _ Bumping into objects.
   _ Groping for objects or touching them in an uncertain way.
   _ Squinting or tilting the head to see.
   _ Holding books or other reading material close to the face.
   _ Dropping food or utensils at mealtimes.
   _ Difficulty recognizing faces.
   _ Looking ungroomed or sloppy.
   _ Acting confused or disoriented.
   ``Sight may be lost so slowly that it is not until a significant
amount of vision has been lost that the person realizes something is
wrong,'' says AFB Executive Director William F. Gallagher.
   ``Most vision loss will result from diabetes, cataracts, macular
degeneration and other eye diseases that affect primarily older
people and develop gradually with few early symptoms,'' he says.

   A healthy baby is more likely if there's a healthy you to start
with.
   Prepregnancy planning will help you deliver a full-term, optimum
weight baby, says the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. The
organization says that the infant mortality rate in the United
States exceeds that of 18 other countries.
   The foundation recommends a visit to the obstetrician before you
become pregnant to detect and prevent problems that might affect the
fetus in the earliest stages of development. It's particularly
important if you already have had a problem during a previous
pregnancy.
   You'll be screened for infections such as toxoplasmosis, rubella,
cytomegalovirus or hepatitis B. If you test positive, you can follow
up with appropriate vaccinations or counseling.
   Chronic health problems _ diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disease
and epilepsy _ will be analyzed for risks to you or your baby. For
example, if you are diabetic, you have an excellent chance to
deliver a healthy baby without complications if you have continuous
medical care and keep your blood sugar under tight control.
   Inherited or ethnically linked diseases like Tay-Sachs or sickle
cell anemia may prompt a prepregnancy genetic screening. Women over
35 also can look at options and weigh the age-related risk of
chromosome defects.
   The workup also will include a discussion of lifestyle, diet and
exercise, helping you develop new programs to change behaviors and
habits that may pose a threat to the fetus.

   No harm in that after-work drink with friends, as long as you
remain a social drinker and don't wander over the line to alcoholism.
   You could be wrong, say Joseph Barbato and Allan Luks, both
social drinkers and co-authors of ``You Are What You Drink''
(Villard Books).
   Even if you're not headed off the deep end, alcohol can have its
effect on your looks, how you feel and how you function, say
Barbato, former public information director for the Alcoholism
Council of Greater New York, and Luks, executive director for the
Institute for the Advancement of Health.
   For example, alcohol can make your skin look red and blotchy when
it reaches the vessels just under the skin's surface. It can push
your weight up because it is a genuine appetizer, making you hungry
and at the same time confusing your sense of satiety. Alcohol also
can keep your body from absorbing nutients and vitamins,
particularly folic acid, making you tired. It can disrupt your
rapid-eye-movement sleep, producing insomnia. It also upsets your
normal immune responses, making you more vulnerable to invading
microbes. The authors also cite studies which say alcohol can make
you aggressive rather than euphoric, playing hob with your emotional
and sexual relationships.
   If that's not enough, you also can get the old-fashioned
hangover. Nausea, headache and exhaustion can follow even modest
intakes of alcohol.
   You don't have to give it up, but the authors say that you need
to know your limit and be aware of the negatives of just one more.

<BYLINE>Health: Childhood Allergies ^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The belief that children outgrow their allergies is a myth, says
an allergy specialist at the University of California-Davis.
   ``Symptoms may moderate over time, but the potential for an
allergic reaction _ once the right set of circumstances pops up _ is
always there,'' says Professor Eric Gershwin. ``Once allergic,
always allergic.''
   According to Gershwin, allergic youngsters are more vulnerable to
recurrent colds, sore throats or ear infections, short attention
spans, poor academic performances, sleep disturbances, poor
appetite, irritability and psychological disturbances.
   ``Allergies are certainly a major social, psychological and
financial burden for children and their parents,'' says Gershwin,
chief of the university's division of rheumatology, allergy and
clinical immunology.
   Despite new technology, allergies remain one of the most common
and troublesome health problems around, he adds.
   One of every six children suffers from allergies, with symptoms
ranging from an occasional sneeze to life-threatening asthma
attacks, says Gershwin, co-author with retired professor Edwin
Klingelhofer of a recently published book, ``Conquering Your Child's
Allergies'' (Addison-Wesley).
   Both authors have allergies and are fathers of severely allergic
children.
   ``Allergies can be tied to a host of factors or conditions _ from
the time of the year or the weather or what your child had for lunch
to the arrival of a new pet, moving to a new house or apartment,
using makeup, or even taking a walk in the country,'' they write.
   They point out that cafeteria lunches, physical education
classes, field trips, school parties or just being in the classroom
_ near chalk, heating and air vents, dust, glues and paints _ can
trigger allergic reactions.
   Children can learn how to manage their allergies. But each child
first must know exactly what the allergy is, what triggers it and
what to do to avoid the reaction, Gershwin says.
   ``The parents and other health care providers must spend the time
and energy to convey the avoidance and treatment strategies in terms
the child can comprehend.
   ``(They) must show children how to go about making their own
independent health care decisions, give them the freedom and
opportunity to do so, and review the decisions and their outcomes
carefully.''

   The leader of a women's medical rights group says that women
still aren't taking enough responsibility for the quality of their
health care.
   ``Twenty years into the new age of the women's movement, women
still have fallen short of their responsibility of managing their
bodies,'' says Merle Hoffman, president and founder of Choices
Women's Medical Center in New York. ``Today's women respond after
the fact, turning towards medical malpractice.''
   Citing a recent New York State legislative report which charged
that unnecessary hysterectomies are on the rise, Hoffman says that
``women need to be transformed from passive, powerless victims into
informed medical consumers, demanding minimum standards of behavior,
information and treatment from their doctors.''
   To increase what she terms ``patient power,'' she says women must
assert their right to question their doctors and not be intimidated
by the medical establishment. They need to find out their options
for treatment and be prepared to comparison shop for both doctors
and drugs. Then, with informed consent, they should take equal
responsibility with their doctors about treatment decisions.
   ``It is not enough to know your rights. You must also accept your
responsibilities.''

   What's the most popular health care subject?
   According to a field test of a new video health care information
service, it's personal weight.
   The Health Care Information Center, developed by CareQuest Inc.,
of Roanoke, Va., and designed for use primarily in pharmacies,
offers information on 350 health topics, from acne to warts, back
pain to vitiligo.
   During a 90-day testing phase in the Southeast, in which more
than 19,000 pharmacy customers used the machine, questions about
weight and weight control far outranked all others, according to
CareQuest.
   Making the most use of the system in the test were
25-to-40-year-olds, who represented 39.7 percent of the total. Men
represented 49.2 percent of the users, the company said.
   The health care information in the computer data base is provided
by the Columbia University School of Public Health, in New York.
   Three video screens are encased in a 7-foot kiosk, which includes
a touch-sensitive screen for customer questions and two screens for
advertising and promotions. There is a printout option.

   Americans will spend an estimated $5 billion this year on
cosmetic dentistry and may spend as much as $9 billion by 1992,
according to Customedix Corp., developers of dental products.
   Three years ago, the figure was about $2.5 billion.
   The company says the increase is because people today are more
``cosmetic conscious,'' there is more disposable income, and new
dental products provide a more natural look.
   A new porcelain has been developed, for example, that has three
times the compressive strength of standard porcelains, says Dr.
Gordon Cohen, chairman of Customedix. He says porcelain has a
natural translucency, transmitting and reflecting light in a way
that matches real teeth.
   Cohen believes the use of high strength porcelains will increase
over the next decade, while alloys and conventional porcelains will
decline.

   About one of every three Americans suffers from a mental,
emotional or substance abuse problem in their lives, according to a
recent report by the National Institutes of Health, with direct
mental health costs estimated at $75 billion a year.
   Mental health care costs generally encompass psychiatric, alcohol
and drug abuse treatment.
   ``Mental health care problems are costing American business close
to $200 billion a year,'' says Dr. David J. McDonnell, president of
Preferred Health Care Ltd., of Wilton, Conn. ``The figure includes
employee benefits, absenteeism, shoddy workmanship and other job
related problems.''
   McDonnell says the reasons for the increase in mental health care
costs include stress on the job and in society, increasing use of
and dependency on alcohol and drugs, and heightened sensitivity to
these problems.
   ``Mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse no longer have the
stigma attached to them that they once had,'' McDonnell adds.
``People are more open with their problems and don's hesitate to
seek help.''
   Preferred Health Care manages mental health care programs for
U.S. companies.

   The cost per employee of employer-sponsored health care plans
jumped by 18.6 percent in l988, after two years of increases
averaging less than eight percent, according to a survey made among
1,600 employers.
   That translates to a record $2,354 average for every employee.
The average cost in 1987 was $1,985, according to A. Foster Higgins
and Co., Inc., a benefit consulting firm.
   ``Not only is double-digit inflation back in health plans, there
doesn't appear to be much relief in sight,'' says John Erb, managing
consultant in charge of the survey.
   A major factor in the escalation is growing use of mental health
and substance abuse benefits. These alone cost an average of $207 in
l988, compared to $163 in l987.
   Another important factor is wider use of advanced medical
technology. ```Miraculous cures' are becoming more common, but
miracles cost money,'' says Erb.

   Women in poor physical shape are three times more likely to die
of heart disease at an early age than are those who keep themselves
in good condition, according to a long-term study.
   Dr. Lars G. Ekelund, the principal author of the study, said it
provides the first strong evidence that exercise protects women from
heart disease, just as it does men.
   Poor physical fitness ``is almost as important as smoking as a
risk factor for cardiovascular disease'' in women, said Ekelund, a
researcher at the University of North Carolina.
   The study was based on a 10{-year follow-up of 2,802 women who
ranged in age from 30 to 69. --_
   Fodor's, publishers of travel guides, has come out with a book

   ``Health and Fitness Vacations,'' by travel writer Bernard Burt,

and the Caribbean.
   Fodor's will update the book frequently, says Michael Spring,

   The American Red Cross has launched a national campaign to help
prevent child deaths from choking, suffocation and drowning.
   The Infant and Child CPR Campaign will encourage parents,
grandparents, baby sitters and others to learn how to deal with
breathing emergencies in infants and children.
   ``There's a lot a parent can do before the ambulance arrives,''
said Robert Burnside, director of health services for the American
Red Cross.
   One of those things, however, is not the Heimlich maneuver.
   That method of using abdominal thrusts to dislodge obstructions
in the breathing passages is effective on choking adults, but it
does more harm than good when used on a baby, Burnside said.
   A choking baby needs to be held in a certain way and be given a
series of blows to the back and thrusts to the chest to restore
breathing, he said. --_
   Bicycle helmets are so effective at preventing head injuries that
a major campaign should be launched to encourage riders to wear
them, a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine
concludes.
   The report, based on a study of injuries treated at five Seattle
area hospitals over a one-year period, shows that riders with
helmets had an 85 percent reduction in their risk of head injury and
an 88 percent reduction in their risk of brain damage. The study was
directed by Dr. Robert S. Thompson of the Group Health Cooperative
in Seattle.
   ``Safety helmets are effective, but they are not being used
enough,'' the researchers wrote. ``The time has come for a major
campaign to increase their use.'' --_
   Knowing how to use a computer as a clinical tool to analyze
patient data and search the medical literature is going to be as
important in the next decade as knowing how to use a stethoscope,
says Family Practice News.
   Citing a seminar run by the American Association of American
Medical Colleges, the publication predicts the use of computers
involving ``medical informatics'' will give the physician more time
for the patient.
   The report, noting that computers are not just teaching-machines,
predicts that they will be indispensible in clinical care and basic
research. For that reason, a medical informatics curriculum should
be on the agenda of medical schools.
   The medical journal adds that a number of medical schools,
including UCLA, have begun to offer courses on medical informatics.

   High blood pressure affects one of every four Americans of all
ages and lifestyles and many of those afflicted don't even know it,
according to a report issued at Redwood, Wash.
   High blood pressure is the leading cause of heart attack, stroke
and kidney disease, say officials of Health Monitor Centers, which
offer free blood pressure reading and health screenings in retail
stores across the nation.
   The report says 60 percent of all Americans will develop some
type of elevated blood pressure during their lifetimes, with one of
every four suffering from hypertension. --_
   Eye examinations not only can disclose visual problems they also
can detect high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol, says
a University of Alabama optometry professor.
   ``In many cases, optometry is the entry point for health care,''
explained Dr. Larry Alexander at an education course at the American
Optometric Association's Congress in New York City.
   ``The majority of optometric patients haven't had a physical exam
for years, so it's the optometrist who's picking up on these
cardiovascular conditions.''
   For example, an optometrist can spot high blood pressure or
diabetes by observing hemorrhaging or blocked blood vessels in the
eye.
   Or a person with high cholesterol may have fatty particles in the
eye's blood vessels, blocked vessels, a gray ring around the eye's
cornea or fatty deposits on the eyelids. --_

<HEAD>Jordan Announces Commercial Debt Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The finance ministry said Monday that the
country's commercial lenders have agreed in principle to reschedule
$575 million in debts due over a 30-month period.
   The agreement, announced by state-run Jordan Radio, is part of a
series of steps taken by the government to overcome a balance of
payments crisis largely triggered by mounting obligations on
Jordan's $8.3 billion-debt.
   The agreement followed two days of talks between six banks
representing the London Club of commercial lenders and Jordanian
officials led by Finance Minister Bassel Jardaneh and Central Bank
Governor Mohammed Said Nabulsi.
   The commercial banks grouped under the club hold about $1.1
billion of Jordan's debt.
   The statement quoted an unidentified Finance Ministry official as
saying commercial bank representatives had agreed to reschedule the
$575 million in debts due from the start of this year through
mid-1991.
   After a five-year grace period, the money would be paid over 11
years.
   It also said Jordan had pledged to pay interest due on the debt
amounting to $82 million this year.
   Bankers earlier said Jordan had not made any payments this year
on its commercial obligations.
   ``This agreement will uphold Jordan's standing in international
financial circles which will have positive results in strengthening
the balance of payments and encouraging investment in Jordan,'' the
statement said.
   Jordan earlier reached agreement for a similar rescheduling plan
with the Paris Club of governmental lenders, although that plan did
not extend into 1991.
   The Paris Club governments hold 43 percent of Jordan's debt, but
the percentage of payments was lower because of interest rate
differences.
   Jordan also reached agreements for relief from the Soviet Union,
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and won more than
$350 million worth of grant aid from Arab oil states in the Gulf.
   The help sent Jordan's dinar shooting up to $1.50 last month from
a low of $1. It was worth $3 early last year before the Central Bank
began running short of foreign reserves.

<HEAD>Reaction to Rumors of Tire Acquisition Varies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French tire maker Michelin is rumored to be
interested in acquiring Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., but analysts
differ on whether the purchase would fit in with Michelin's normal
purchasing patterns.
   Michelin is locked in a three-way contest with Goodyear and
Bridgestone of Japan to be the world's largest tire company.
   Analyst Harry Millis of McDonald &amp; Co. in Cleveland said
acquiring Akron-based Uniroyal Goodrich ``just would not fit
Michelin's normal pattern at all.''
   He noted that a 1970s purchase of a tire plant owned by Gates
Rubber Co. of Denver ``didn't work to (Michelin's) satisfaction.
   ``Historically, Michelin has had very little interst in buying
other people's facilities,'' he said.
   But at least one other industry observer said an acquisition
would be benefit Michelin's in carrying out its strategy in the
United States, giving it a domestic market share almost equal to
that of industry leader Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.
   ``Francophiles like to be kind of top of the hill, and they see
Goodyear and they know they can't get to be No. 1 by themselves,''
said Arvid Jouppi, analyst with Keane Securities Co. in Grosse
Pointe, Mich.
   Michelin spokesman Jim Morton said Friday he had heard
acquisition rumors for the last day or two, but he said it was
company policy not to comment on rumors or speculation.
   Uniroyal Goodrich became the second-largest tire manufacturer in
North America and fifth-largest in the world when B.F. Goodrich Co.
and Uniroyal Inc. of Middlebury, Conn., merged their tire operations
on Aug. 1, 1986.
   Michelin, which has U.S. headquarters in Greenville, S.C.,
operates eight tire plants in the United States and Canada, while
Uniroyal Goodrich own seven plants in the two countries.
   Analysts estimated a buyout could cost between $700 million and
$1 billion.
   Uniroyal Goodrich had total sales last year of $2.2 billion and
reported profit of $19.2 million, including a one-time gain of $9.3
million from the termination of a pension plan, during the second
quarter ended June 30.
   The company, however, lost $7 million during the first quarter of
this year, after incurring additional interest expense from last
year's restructuring, which wiped out operating profits, the company
said.
   Jouppi said it would be logical for Michelin to acquire Uniroyal
Goodrich because Michelin would win the Ohio firm's market share,
greatly boost its manufacturing capacity and prevent Uniroyal
Goodrich from being bought by another competitor.
   Uniroyal Goodrich declined comment on the prospects of
acquisition by Michelin.

<HEAD>Trump Casino Distributed Incorrect Roulette Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Donald Trump's Atlantic City casinos
knowingly distributed incorrect roulette instructions for more than
a year, a newspaper reported today.
   Winners were not paid according to the gaming guide issued by
Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino, but were instead paid under the actual
rules of the game.
   Among the errors was an illustration showing that a gambler who
puts down money on black is paid off if the ball lands on red, and
that a ball landing on an odd number pays off a bet on an even
number, The Philadelphia Inquirer said.
   The guides were distributed in 1986, 1987 and part of 1988, the
paper said.
   Regulators knew the guide was inaccurate as early as September
1986, but Fred Gushin, deputy attorney general for gaming
enforcement, gave Trump Castle permission to keep distributing the
booklet until copies ran out, the paper said.
   ``No one was cheated here because while the gaming guide
contained technical errors, the game was played according to the
rules approved by the commission,'' Gushin said.
   Robert Signore of Ambler told the newspaper that he followed the
guide after discovering it contained mistakes. After 22 spins of the
roulette wheel, Signore had lost $600 but should have won $200
according to the guide, he said.
   Signore has sued in small claims court to recover the $800 he
says he is owed.
   Gushin and officials from Trump Castle did not immediately return
calls this morning.

It also went to Domino's 16 regional offices and to about 300
employees at its Ann Arbor headquarters.
   ``They haven't put a value on the company and I think that's what
he meant by exploring the possibility of a sale,'' Domino's
spokesman Ron Hingst said Sunday. He emphasized that a sale is only
a possibility, but said, ``We felt we owed the employees and
franchisees a letter.''
   Domino's, a privately held company, is the world's largest pizza
deliverer. Its sales reached a company-record $2.3 billion in 1988.
Its net income fell to $6.1 million from $7.7 million in the
previous year, according to news reports that Hingst did not dispute.
   Monaghan, who also owns the Detroit Tigers, supports the Catholic
Church, C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor and the
University of Michigan School of Architecture. He also is the
founder of the Domino's Foundation, which has supported health-care
agencies and educational and cultural groups.
   ``The thought of selling Domino's Pizza is not a pleasant idea,''
Monaghan wrote. ``I must emphasize that it is only a possibility at
this point.''
   Monaghan, 52, remains chairman and chief executive officer of the
company but gave up running day-to-day operations earlier this year.
He holds about 97 percent of the stock in Domino's.

   The World Bank, long criticized for funding
environmentally damaging projects, today announced increased lending
to population-control projects and forestry development to help
combat global atmospheric warming.
   Bank President Barber Conable told a conference on the
environment that the bank ``is committed to environmental issues
and, what is more, this commitment does not detract at all from our
primary mission of global development.''
   The American president of the leading institution for funding
Third World development spoke at the opening of a conference called
to address how to raise living standards in poor countries while
preserving the environment.
   Sponsored by the Japanese government and the United Nations
Environment Program, the conference has drawn dozens of officials
and experts from many countries and international organizations.
   At the end of the conference Wednesday they are expected to issue
recommendations on ways to combat the main problem on the agenda:
global warming. Scientists warn that the so-called ``Greenhouse
Effect'' could scorch parts of the Earth and raise sea levels unless
checked.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, whose country is under
environmentalists' attack as the biggest importer of tropical forest
products, pledged increased assistance to research on sustainable
development of tropical forests.
   Kaifu, welcoming the conferees, said Japan intends to raise its
foreign environmental aid to $2.25 billion in three years.
   ``Japan is ready to take on global environmental issues with
positive vigor,'' he said, reporting that he discussed such issues
in depth during his just-completed series of summit meetings in the
United States, Canada and Mexico.
   Conable said the world's population, currently about 5 billion,
will grow to 6 billion by the year 2000, adding to the use of fossil
fuels that is blamed for the greenhouse effect and atmospheric
warming.
   He announced that the bank is establishing a Gas Development Unit
to promote use of natural gas because it is the least polluting of
fossil fuels.
   ``I am also pleased to announce a tripling of our lending to
forestry in the next few years,'' Conable said.
   On population-control projects, he said lending has amounted to
over $500 million in the last five years, and that level will
increase to over $800 million in the 1990-92 period.
   Mostafa K. Tolba, executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program, said depletion of the ozone layer, caused by
chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals, was increasing skin cancer
and eye cataracts.
   ``The human immunity system may be weakening. Agricultural
patterns may be impacted, and marine food chains affected,'' he told
delegates.
   Tolba called for ``full partnership in all countries'' to phase
out all ozone-destroying chemicals and said he was concerned that
just 13 of the world's 120 developing countries have ratified the
Montreal protocol on those chemicals.
   ``Brazil, China, India, the Republic of (South) Korea and some
other major producers and users of chlorofluorocarbons in the Thirld
World are yet to join the protocol,'' he said.
   Regarding other ``greenhouse gases'' such as carbon dioxide,
Tolba urged developed countries, which now emit three-fourths of
such gases, to decrease energy use and increase energy conservation
and efficiency.
   ``But we have to be quite objective,'' he went on. ``If the
industrialized world meets the challenge, the results of its efforts
could be completely wiped out if China and India continue to burn
their huge reserves of coal. And they will continue to do so unless
they are assisted financially and technologically to use
alternatives.''

   The stock market gave ground today, getting off
to a sluggish start on a new week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 7.60 to 2,701.94
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 381 up, 567 down and 485
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.90 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said buying interest was limited, as it had been last
week, by concern that the market was due for at least a pause after
its sharp rise through the first eight months of the year.
   There also has been much talk on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve will be reluctant to relax its credit policy any further
over the next several weeks.
   Fed policymakers are believed to be satisfied that the risk of a
recession have been averted for now, given recent data that showed a
stronger-than-expected pace of business activity.
   Nevertheless, interest rates declined slightly in the credit
markets today, suggesting that traders believe the economy has room

   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.66 to 2,709.54,
reducing its loss for the week to 42.55 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 10 to 9 on the

<HEAD>Automotive News: Big Three Agree With Oil Companies to Kill Methanol
Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top executives of the nation's Big Three
automakers have agreed with some oil companies to quash moves which
would require that cars burn methanol instead of gasoline, an
automotive journal reported today.
   Automotive News quoted unidentified sources as saying General
Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith and Vice Chairmen Harold Poling of
Ford Motor Co. and Gerald Greenwald of Chrysler Corp. have signed
documents for their companies to work with oil refiners to develop a
reformulated gasoline which would steer them clear of methanol
conversion costs.
   The weekly journal said in the copyright story that killing any
methanol initiatives would save the automakers millions of dollars
in research and development costs, and eliminate competition for oil
companies.
   GM spokesman Bill Noack was in a meeting and not immediately
available for comment this morning.
   Spokesmen Tom Foote of Ford and Tom Houston of Chrysler said
their companies had no immediate reaction to the Automotive News
report.
   It would take the oil industry years to develop and produce
reformulated gasoline which would meet federal clean-air standards,
Automotive News said. Some efforts already are under way.
   Each of the Big Three has an active methanol research program.
Outside engineers also have been studying ways, including new fuels,
to reduce automotive pollution and its effects on the environment.
   President Bush this summer announced a plan that, beginning in
1995, would phase in cars that burn ``clean'' fuels such as methanol
in Connecticut and the cities of Los Angeles, Houston, New York,
Milwaukee, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Diego and Chicago.
   The Society of Automotive Engineers and GM last spring sponsored
a methanol-fueled car rally in which the automaker supplied a fleet
of Chevrolet Corsicas to 15 colleges and universities. The schools
converted the cars and drove them from Detroit to Washington via
Canada and New England.
   Automotive News said not all of the nation's oil producers are
involved in the reported effort now, but that by a ``summit
meeting'' of top automotive and oil industry executives, tentatively
set for January, most of the major oil refiners will have signed
commitments.
   ``Getting the major auto companies and the gasoline makers
together on the emissions problem is a bit like getting two
elephants to dance,'' Automotive News quoted a Ford fuel engineer as
saying. ``It takes time. Inevitably, toes are going to get stepped
on.''

<DATELINE>RANDOLPH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dunkin' Donuts said today that it has
rejected a $45--a-share bid from a Canadian partnership seeking to
take over the company by means of a $308 million merger.
   ``The company believes that the $45 per share in cash offered by
DD Acquisition does not reflect the maximum value achievable for our
stockholders,'' Robert M. Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive
officer said.
   ``We have therefore directed our advisers to explore all
alternatives, including remaining independent or the possible sale
of Dunkin' Donuts, on terms that will realize value for all of our
stockholders in excess of that currently offered by DD
Acquisition,'' he said in a news release.
   DD Acquisition Corp. is a partnership between Cara Operations
Ltd., a restaurant franchise company, and Kingsbridge Capital Group,
the merchant banking arm of Toronto investor George Mann's Unicorp
Canada Corp.
   The Canadians had offered $45 a share for Dunkin' Donuts stock,
contingent on obtaining a majority of the shares and removal of the
company's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense. The poison pill
increases the number of shares in the event of a hostile takeover,
which would add a significant amount to a buyer's costs.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board, reflecting
caution ahead of Tuesday's Agriculture Department crop report.
   The report, which is scheduled for release after the markets
close on Tuesday, is widely expected to project smaller corn and
soybean harvests than the USDA predicted in August.
   Forecasts for drier weather in the Midwest late this week and
into the next are weighing slightly on corn and soybean futures.
   And fears of a serious frost this week in the Corn Belt are
rapidly fading, despite prospects for freezing temperatures tonight
in the northern Plains.
   ``Certain sections of Nebraska may come down a little bit but no
large producing areas are supposed to have cold, cold
temperatures,'' said Joel Karlin, a research analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to \ cent higher with

oats were \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with September at $1.39 a

   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent lower to .38 cent higher with October
at 72.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .45 cent

frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .30 cent higher with February
at 46.05 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Friday.

   A water pipe break delayed energy futures trading
for more than an hour today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
world's largest futures market for crude oil and refined petroleum
products.
   The water pipe break caused an electrical problem that affected

   Trading ordinarily begins at 9:45 a.m. EDT and was delayed until
11 a.m. EDT, Baxter said.
   The water pipe break did not affect trading in platinum and

   Environmentalists want to enlist grocery chains
as allies in their fight against pesticides on foods, but the
campaign is showing only limited success and meeting stiff
resistance from the largest retailers.
   One environmental group, the National Toxics Campaign, announced
today it has signed up a half-dozen grocery chains in a pledge to
shift growers away from using pesticides, especially cancer-causing
chemicals.
   Environmentalists called the agreement a major breakthrough,
although it amounted to little more than a general pledge to work
toward elimination of pesticide use.
   ``This is the beginning of a national campaign,'' said Craig
Merrilees of the National Toxics Campaign, calling the pact a
``first of a kind ... dramatic breakthrough'' for the environmental
movement.
   The participants represent fewer than 200 stores in the United
States and are firms primarily in California and Arizona that have
broken ranks before with their industry colleagues on the pesticide
issue.
   The agreement, which involves five grocery chains and a produce
distributor, represents only the kickoff of a national campaign to
enlist grocers in the fight against pesticides, the
environmentalists told a news conference.
   Merrilees said he expects other grocers to join but acknowledged
that the industry hierarchy, including grocers' trade associations,
is strongly opposed to pushing growers to reduce their pesticide use.
   At a separate news conference, the Food Marketing Institute and
several producer associations denounced the environmentalists' plans.
   Robert L. Carey, a spokesman for the industry group, accused the
environmentalists of ``seeking to create a major crisis of
confidence in the food supply.''
   ``They apparently believe they can coerce supermarket retailers
into assuming the job of government,'' he said. ``Their intention is
to pit company against company and retailers against their
suppliers.''
   Karen Brown of the National Food Institute accused the
environmentalists of ``more scare tactics.''
   ``We don't think it's our job to play the role of government or
science,'' said Ms. Brown, whose group represents 1,500 grocery
companies including the country's 100 largest chains.
   Pesticide use has received heavy attention following the uproar
earlier this year over the pesticide Alar, which ultimately was
pulled off the U.S. market by its manufacturer after sales of apple
products plummeted. Last week the manufacturers of the fungicide
EBDC said they were taking it off the market for use on a number of
crops because tests showed a higher-than-acceptable cancer risk.
   In the agreement reached with the environmentalists, the grocers
pledge to ``request'' growers to disclose what pesticides were used
on produce; to ``actively encourage'' the phase-out of
cancer-causing chemicals on produce by 1995; and to ``whenever
economically feasible ... carry certified organic produce and
produce certified to contain no detected pesticide residues.''
   But the pledge omits stronger provisions once sought by some
environmentalists, such as demands that grocers post pesticide
content of fruits and vegetables in stores or demand immediate curbs
on pesticide use.
   There are scant signs that the pledge sought by the National
Toxics Campaign is finding many converts among the nation's grocers.
Merrilees conceded there remains outright hostility from industry
trade groups.
   The Food Institute recently wrote to its members urging them not
to participate in the National Toxics Campaign agreement, Merrilees
said.
   Among those signing the agreement with the National Toxics
Campaign are several sizeable local chains such as Raley's with 55
stores in the Sacramento, Calif., area and Abco Supermarkets with
about 60 stores in Arizona. Yet the large chains are missing and
there is virtually no representation from stores outside California,
Nevada and Arizona.
   A spokesman for Safeway Stores Corp., which has shown little sign
of talking with the environmentalists, declined to discuss in detail
the company's policy on pesticides.
   Donald Beaver, president of the California Grocers Association,
complained that too often the environmental groups have asked
grocers to be on the front line of the war against pesticides.
   ``We're not going to shoot ourselves in the leg and end up having
nothing to sell in the stores,'' said Beaver, explaining that
grocers will not sign a pledge against accepting produce with
pesticides when there is no assurance that alternatives will be
available.
   ``What our industry supports and what everybody is working
towards is to set up programs to fund research that will reduce the
necessity of pesticides,'' said Beaver in a telephone interview.
``We're caught between the grower and the consumer.''

<HEAD>Rig Count Jumps by 14</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs throughout
the country, fueled by a double-digit increase in Texas, jumped by
14 last week to total 950 and again was ahead of last year's levels
for the second straight week, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   A year ago, the count stood at 938, the company said Monday.
   The latest increase continued to reflect the year-long volatility
of the count, which rose by 27 a week ago when it marked the first
time in 13 months that the count was higher than the previous year.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
collecting figures.
   Texas, which jumped by a 20-rig gain during the previous
reporting period, gained another 10 rigs last week, while Oklahoma
was up by three.
   Among other major oil producing states, Louisiana and Wyoming
each were up by four, while California increased by one. Kansas saw
a loss of six rigs during the week.

<TEXT>
   The effort by the United States and other top
industrial countries to stabilize the value of the dollar has broken
down, running the risks of higher U.S. trade deficits in future
years, economists at a Washington research institute said today.
   ``The coordination process is in shambles,'' said C. Fred
Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.
   He said the effort launched by the United States and the
governments of Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and
Italy had failed to keep the dollar from rising this year above the
upper targets set by the world's richest industrial countries.
   That will spell trouble down the road as American exporters find
that the higher value of the dollar makes it more difficult to sell
their goods abroad, Bergsten said at a news conference.
   He forecast that the U.S. trade deficit, which improved
dramatically in 1988, will begin rising again by 1990, further
worsening the country's position as the world's largest debtor
nation.
   The institute today released a new book, ``Dollar Politics:
Exchange Rate Policymaking in the United States,'' which called for
increased emphasis by U.S. policymakers both in the executive branch
and in Congress on the dollar's proper level on foreign currency
markets.
   ``In May and June (the dollar) shattered its upper limit against
the yen _ 140 (yen to one dollar) _ and the mark _ 1.90-1.92 (marks
to one dollar), rising above 150 and 2.00, respectively, to a
2{-year high,'' wrote I.M. Destler and C. Randall Henning, the
authors of the new study.
   Destler is professor in the School of Public Affairs at the
University of Maryland and Henning is a research associate at the
institute, a private study group with financing from the United
States and other countries.
   The price of the dollar is important because of its effect on
trade. A low dollar makes U.S. goods cheap, encouraging exports and
discouraging imports. A rise in the dollar has the opposite effect.
   Governments, including the Bush administration, agree that this
country buys far too much in comparison with what it sells. The
resulting trade deficit has made the United States the world's
biggest debtor nation.
   On Friday the price of the dollar was above 146 yen and 1.99
marks, despite efforts to keep it down. One report said the central
banks of 10 countries had been selling dollars in an unsuccessful
attempt to keep their price down.
   A 1985 agreement to work together on the price of the dollar and
other currencies was made by Secretary of State James A. Baker III _
then secretary of the Treasury _ and his counterparts from Japan,
West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   They have never published their targets for the dollar's price.
The upper limits named by Destler and Henning are often cited by
unofficial experts.
   The two authors complained that U.S. exchange rate policy is made
by a small group of senior officials and should be more closely
coordinated with broader economic policies and private business.
   They proposed setting up new committees in Congress to watch the
dollar's price, a private sector group to advise Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady, and more involvement by other government agencies.

   Share prices closed sharply lower Monday in light
trading on the London Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 23.3
points, or 1 percent, to close at 2,400.6.
   Volume was a modest 464 million shares, down from 791.3 million

   The market fell sharply in the last quarter-hour of trading,
which some market watchers warned was a sign of increasing doubts
about London's prospects for an imminent rise to new all-time highs.
   Nonetheless, dealers said traders were reluctant to sell
aggressively, particularly in the face of continued talk over
possible takeovers and acquisitions in various sectors.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed at 1,981.6, down 22.1
points. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 11.43 points to

<HEAD>World Bank To Boost Funding for Anti-Global Warming Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank said Monday it will boost its funding
for programs to combat global atmospheric warming, following
criticism that it has not been sensitive to the environmental
consequences of its loans.
   President Barber Conable said the bank will triple its lending to
forestry programs and has established a new gas development unit to
encourage developing nations to use natural gas instead of fuels
that create more pollutants linked to the rise in world temperatures.
   ``We do not believe that development and environmental protection
are mutually hostile objectives,'' he told an environmental
conference sponsored by the Japanese government. ``One cannot be
sacrificed for the other.''
   Mostafa Tolba, head of the United Nations Environment Program,
told 60 officials and experts at the meeting that about 50 million
people around the world may become ``environmental refugees''
because of global warming.
   The Earth's warming has been linked to gases such as carbon
dioxide, methane and freon, by-products of the burning of fossil
fuels and other industrial and agricultural processes. Released into
the atmosphere, they trap heat like a greenhouse, preventing it from
escaping.
   If the release of gases continues at current levels, the Earth's
temperature is likely to rise by 2.5 degrees to 8 degrees
(Fahrenheit) over the next 50 years, scorching parts of the world
and melting polar ice, flooding densely populated coastal areas,
Tolba said.
   Low-lying developing countries such as Bangladesh, Egypt,
Indonesia and Pacific islands are likely to be particularly hard
hit, he said.
   The conference, on global warming and environmental protection in
developing nations, is part of a new Japanese government policy of
becoming more involved in international environmental issues.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, welcoming the conferees Monday,
pledged that Japan will provide about $2.25 billion in special
environmental loans over the next three years and will work to
develop environmentally appropriate technology.
   Japanese environmental groups have criticized the conference,
saying it is likely to whitewash Japanese links to environmental
degradation, and have protested the government's decision to exclude
private groups from the sessions.
   In separate demonstrations Monday, several environmental and
citizens groups protested Japan's status as the largest importer of
wood from endangered tropical forests and its alleged export of
polluting industries to the Third World.
   A coalition of groups held its own three-day ``people's forum''
on environmental issues before the government conference. The 1,000
participants called for more careful citizen monitoring of Japan's
overseas aid programs.
   ``Under the name of `environmental aid,' Japan is promoting
certain types of tree plantations, such as eucalyptus plantations in
northeastern Thailand, that are proven to destroy the natural
environment and ruin local forest-dwelling communities,'' said
Surisuwan Kuankachorn of Thailand's Project for Ecological Recovery,
a participant in the forum.
   ``The best thing that Japan can do for the outside world ... is
to listen to the real needs of the people in other countries, not
just Japanese companies,'' he said.
   Conable said the World Bank has become ``committed to
environmental issues'' and is increasingly integrating environmental
values into its development programs.
   The bank, the leading institutional supporter of Third World
development, has been criticized for funding projects, such as dams
and roads, that have damaged the environment and disrupted
traditional living patterns.
   ``We are changing direction, but must turn very slowly, like an
ocean liner,'' Conable said.
   He said the bank also would boost funding for a tradiional
emphasis, family planning, from $500 million in the past five years
to $800 million in the 1990-92 period.
   He said the world's population, currently about 5 billion, will
grow to 6 billion by the year 2000, adding to the use of fossil
fuels blamed for atmospheric warming.
   Tolba said all countries must cooperate in dealing with global
warming. But developed nations, he said, are responsible for
production of three-quarters of the ``greenhouse'' gases.
   ``The challenge before Japan, the United States and East and West
Europe is to decrease energy needs, increase energy conservation and
efficiency, and keep pace with an accelerating global economy,'' he
said.
   ``But we have to be quite objective. If the industrialized world
meets the challenge, the results of its efforts could be completely
wiped out if China and India continue to burn their huge reserves of
coal. And they will continue to do so unless they are assisted
financially and technologically to use alternatives.''

   The Federal Aviation Administration said today
it will order structural modifications to ensure the safety of 1,153
older McDonnell Douglas DC-10, DC-9, DC-8 and MD-80 jetliners flown
by U.S. airlines.
   The FAA announcement came during a news conference by an
industry-government task force that recommended work to increase the
safety of 1,900 McDonnell-Douglas airliners in service throughout
the world.
   The task force on aging airliners estimated the modifications
would cost $563 million over the next 20 years for the worldwide
fleet, an average of $290,000 per aircraft.
   None of the work is urgent and the airliners remain safe to fly,
said Clyde Kizer, spokesman for the task force set up 14 months ago
by the airline industry's Air Transport Association.
   The FAA order covers only U.S. planes over the next four years,
with work required as each airliner logs a set number of landings,
and would total $53 million, said Ray Ramakis, assistant FAA
director for maintenance programs and flying standards.
   Industry officials said many of the changes already are being
made at airline maintenance bases and no disruptions of service or
fare increases are expected as a result of the orders.
   Foreign airlines and regulatory agencies generally adopt FAA
orders for U.S.-built aircraft.
   Ramakis said the FAA would issue formal ``airworthiness
directives'' within the next few days. They would become law after a
period of several weeks for public comment.
   ``The changes are designed to eliminate the potential for
structural fatigue problems as the aircraft reach their economic
design goal,'' Ramakis said.
   He said the orders will affect 218 DC-8s, 568 DC-9s, 173 MD-80s
and 194 DC-10s, with additional aircraft added as they accumulate
service time.
   The orders will include modifications to the fuselages, landing
gears and doors of the airliners, he said.
   The proposals and orders are similar to those made for airliners
manufactured by Boeing Co. after another task force completed its
work earlier this year.
   The panel reviewed 3,900 service bulletins put out by McDonnell
Douglas. Only 159 were recommended for modification or replacement
action.
   The FAA, which made the Boeing recommendations mandatory in May,
participated in the latest group along with airlines, manufacturers
and some foreign aviation safety officials.
   A third study will cover older airliners built by other
manufacturers.
   ``The formation of the industry-government task force on
airworthiness assurance is one of the best things that has happened
in the aviation industry in the last 30 years,'' said Dale Warren, a
vice president of Douglas Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnell
Douglas.
   He said the estimated cost for each model aircraft would be
$90,000 for older MD-80s, $74,000 for DC-10s, $161,000 for DC-8s and
$490,000 for DC-9s. The DC-9 work is more costly because it requires
the greatest number of changes and involves expensive replacement of
main landing gear fittings, officials said.
   An industry analyst, Paul Turk of AVMARK Inc., said mandatory
work on McDonnell Douglas aircraft should be less extensive than
that required for Boeing models because ``the Douglas construction
philosophy is heavier'' with fewer corrosion problems.
   AVMARK lists 306 DC-8s, which were first built in 1958, as still
carrying passengers or freight throughout the world; 888 DC-9s,
first manufactured in 1964; and 372 DC-10s, which entered commercial
fleets in 1971 and are no longer in production.
   The Boeing recommendations called for $800 million worth of
mandatory work on more than 1,300 early 747, 737 and 727 airliners,
amounting to about $600,000 for each aircraft. Airlines said most of
the alterations were already accomplished or scheduled.
   When the FAA adopted the report on Boeing planes, it marked a
major change in the government's approach to aging airliners.
   Previously, the FAA had required periodic inspections with
replacement required only when corrosion, cracking or other signs of
metal fatigue were found.
   For Boeing planes, the FAA issued a series of ``airworthiness
directives'' initially affecting 115 airliners and others as they
age or accumulate flying hours.
   The decision to set up the task forces came after an Aloha
Airlines 737 with nearly 90,000 flights lost an 18-foot section of
fuselage in an April 1988 flight over Hawaii. A flight attendant was
sucked out of the plane and killed, but the aircraft landed with no
other fatalities.

<HEAD>Rockefeller Group Seeking Ways To Raise More Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockefeller Group Inc. confirmed Monday it was
seeking ways to raise more cash for the family members who are
majority shareholders, after a published report indicated part of
the firm could be up for sale by month's end.
   The company's management has been authorized by the board of
directors ``to explore strategic alternatives for
recapitalization,'' said Vince Silvestri, a spokesman for
Rockefeller Group, whose vast holdings include the 19-building,
22-acre Rockefeller Center in Manhattan.
   But Silvestri said he couldn't comment on a report in Monday's
Wall Street Journal that said Rockefeller Group was trying to sell a
large stake in the family-owned company to outside investors for
more than $1 billion.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources familiar with the
proposal, said Rockefeller Group may seek between $1.3 billion and
$2 billion for 40 percent to 80 percent of the company. It said
family members were hoping to raise cash without losing control over
the management of company assets.
   The company is preparing a prospectus that will be available by
the end of the month to a limited group of potential investors,
according to the Journal.
   The plan would represent another step by Rockefeller Group to
raise cash for a generation of Rockefellers whose inheritance is
largely locked up in real estate and other corporate holdings.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space,
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real
estate investment trust. The company also sold a 15 percent equity
interest to outside investors and some properties around the country.
   ``Among those alternatives being considered are longer financial
restructuring, the sale of shares or a possible joint venture
arrangement with selected investors ...,'' said Silvestri.
   He said proceeds would be used in part ``to provide greater
liquidity for current shareholders.''
   The Rockefeller family fortune was built by John D. Rockefeller,
founder of Standard Oil Co., and was estimated at $900 million by
1911.
   His son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created a series of five trusts
for his children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal owners of
Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr. the
main beneficiaries.
   As the family now moves into the sixth generation the need for
cash to finance various business efforts has increased.
   Besides the Rockefeller Center complex, which includes the
General Electric Building, formerly known as the RCA building, Radio
City Music Hall and the Time-Life buildings, Rockefeller Group
operates several businesses.
   They include: Rockefeller Center Development Corp., Rockefeller
Center Management Corp., Rockefeller Group Telecommunications
Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall Productions Inc., and Cushman &amp;
Wakefield, in which the company holds an 80 percent stake.

   Stock prices declined broadly today, extending
last week's drop.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 42.55 last week,
fell another 22.80 to 2,606.74 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 433 up, 1,018
down and 466 unchanged.
   Analysts said buying interest was limited, as it had been last
week, by concern that the market was due for at least a pause after
its sharp rise through the first eight months of the year.
   There also has been much talk on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve will be reluctant to relax its credit policy any further
over the next several weeks.
   Fed policymakers are believed to be satisfied that the risk of a
recession have been averted for now, given recent data that showed a
stronger-than-expected pace of business activity.
   Nevertheless, interest rates declined slightly in the credit
markets today, suggesting that traders believe the economy has room
to keep on expanding moderately without aggravating inflation or
exerting any strong upward pressure on interest rates.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Domino's Pizza Inc. owner Tom Monaghan's
disclosure that he may sell the company comes at a time when the
fast-food concern's fast-rising star may be dimming, an industry
analyst said Monday.
   Domino's, the No. 2 pizza-maker in the nation behind Pizza Hut
Inc., is the leader in pizza deliveries.
   But analysts say the privately held company's sales growth rate
has slowed, and its profit reportedly declined last year from the
previous year.
   ``Domino's has been on such a fantastic growth rate,'' said Gary
Stibel, founder of New England Consulting, a marketing and
management consulting firm in Westport, Conn.
   ``Companies like Domino's cannot continue to grow at their
pace,'' he said.
   Monaghan, who owns 97 percent of the Ann Arbor-based pizza
delivery company, sent a letter last week to about 800 franchise
owners, 16 regional offices and 300 employees at corporate offices
that he is exploring a sale so he can spend more time doing charity
work.
   But Stibel said there may be another reason.
   ``Domino's has become principally concerned about the cap on (the
growth of) this business,'' he said. ``Their share of the total
universe is beginning to start to flatten out.''
   Domino's spokesman Ron Hingst said Monday he knows of no active
sale negotiations. ``He hasn't even made a decision to sell it or
not to sell it,'' he said.
   ``He (Monaghan) has had a number of offers over the years,''
Hingst said. ``Ten to 15 years ago he had an offer from Pizza Hut
and turned it down.''
   Although it is second to Pizza Hut in overall pizza sales,
Domino's is the world's largest in pizza deliveries with 1988 sales
at $2.3 billion. Pizza Hut had overall sales of $3.2 billion in 1988
but only 20 percent to 30 percent of that was for consumption
outside its stores.
   Hingst said Domino's sales have set company records every year
since the early 1980s as the number of its stores grew. Now,
Domino's operates or has franchised 5,200 stores worldwide.
   The company is privately held and does not publicly report its
earnings, but Hingst did not dispute news reports that its profit
fell to $6.1 million last year from $7.7 million the previous year.
   Domino's dominance of the delivery business is being threatened.
   Pizza Hut, with 7,000 restaurants, began a delivery service out
of existing sit-down restaurants and other delivery-only storefronts
in 1985.
   Pizza Hut spokesman Jim Schwartz said from corporate headquarters
in Wichita, Kan., that sales from the delivery stores is growing at
an annual pace of 15 percent to 16 percent.
   Detroit-based Little Caesar's Pizza, with about half as many
stores as Domino's, is the nation's third-largest pizza company and
had sales last year of about $908 million.
   Domino's has been struggling with some damaging news this year.
   Its guarantee of 30-minute delivery has come under criticism for
putting delivery time ahead of safe driving. Domino's conducts
driver safety classes for its deliverers.
   Monaghan has come under fire from women's groups critical of his
outspoken opposition to abortion, and the National Organization for
Women has organized a national boycott of the chain.
   The 52-year-old Monaghan supports the Roman Catholic Church, C.S.
Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan
School of Architecture. He also founded the Domino's Foundation,
which has supported health-care agencies and educational and
cultural groups.
   He also owns the Detroit Tigers baseball team.
   ``The thought of selling Domino's Pizza is not a pleasant idea,''
Monaghan wrote in his letter. ``I must emphasize that it is only a
possibility at this point.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for drier
weather in the Midwest and fading fears of an overnight freeze in
important corn and soybean areas.
   Trading activity was light as players evened up their positions
and took to the sidelines ahead of Tuesday's Agriculture Department
crop report.
   The report, scheduled for release after Tuesday's close, is
expected to contain lower corn and soybean crop estimates than the
USDA projected in August.
   Forecasts for drier Midwestern weather later this week and into
next week eased concerns about the possibility of a rain-slowed
harvest.
   And although frost was expected Monday night in Nebraska, few
forecasters expected freezing temperatures to reach into the more
important corn-and-soybean states of Iowa and Illinois.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2{ cents lower to \ cent higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $3.93 a bushel; corn
was 1\ cents lower to { cent higher with September at $2.38\ a

   The energy futures market ended mixed in choppy
trading Monday following a sharp runup in prices last week.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, was
up 1 cent to settle at $19.76 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract had
risen 34 cents on Friday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery lost 0.02 cent to
settle at 57.07 cents, after gaining 1.46 cents Friday.
   October heating oil, which rose 1.24 cents at the end of last
week, finished at 56.01 cents, down 0.73 cent.
   ``I think today was just basically a correction day (because) ...
the market had been up sharply on Friday,'' said Andrew Lebow, a
senior trader at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   He said many traders took profits after prices surged Friday due
to internal market influences and reports suggesting demand for oil
was strong.
   Lebow said concerns of overproduction among members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries put a damper on
Monday's trading.
   ``One has to anticipate higher Iraqi production over the next
couple of months as they utilize their new pipeline,'' he said.

   Here are some recent incidents involving metal
fatigue or other problems associated with older airliners that have
had large numbers of landings.
   None of the incidents has involved McDonnell Douglas aircraft,
which are the subject of the latest Federal Aviation Administration
precautionary orders for modifications to increase the safety of
older airliners.
   _Dec. 26, 1988: An Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 built in the late
1960s was forced to land in Charleston, W.Va., after a 14-inch hole
opened in its fuselage at 31,000 feet. There were no injuries among
the 110 people aboard.
   The incident led to fleetwide inspections and discovery of a
3-inch crack in another old Eastern 727.
   _Sept. 21, 1988: An American Airlines 727 made a belly landing at
Dallas-Fort Worth airport after metal fatigue in its landing gear
prevented the pilot from opening the wheel-well door. The 88
passengers and crew evacuated, with three people injured.
   Boeing had recommended inspections eight days earlier after
finding metal fatigue in the same area in other 727s.
   _May 9, 1988: A 20-year-old American Airlines 727 was forced to
make an unscheduled landing at Detroit after a 15-inch crack in a
wheel well caused a drop in cabin pressure. None of the 112 people
aboard was injured.
   _April 28, 1988: A flight attendant was killed and 61 people
injured when a portion fo the fuselage on a heavily flown Aloha
Airlines 737 built in the late 1960s peeled off at 24,000 feet
during a flight from Hilo to Honolulu.
   Tiny cracks were found later in nearly half the aging Boeing 737
jetliners ordered inspected after the incident. The FAA ordered
reriveting of hundreds of older 737s.

<HEAD>Unsuccessful Takeover Bid for Universal Foods Ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of unsuccessful legal and financial
maneuvering, High Voltage Engineering Corp. on Monday terminated its
$700 million offer to buy Milwaukee-based Universal Foods Corp.
   Clifford Press, deputy chairman of High Voltage, blamed
Wisconsin's anti-takeover law as the primary reason for giving up
the fight, which began in December 1988.
   Evan Zeppos, a spokesman for High Voltage, said the company would
continue its effort to have the law overturned in the U.S. Supreme
Court, but he conceded the chances were slim that the court would
hear the appeal.
   Wisconsin's law, passed in 1987, bars an acquiring company from
merging with a target company or sellings its assets if the original
takeover was not approved by the target company's board of directors.
   In the unlikely event that the law is overturned, High Voltage
will reconsider its offer, Zeppos said.
   ``The board's rejection of our proposals and its refusal even to
meet with us to discuss any questions they may have had did not
serve the interests of Universal's shareholders,'' Press said in his
statement.
   After the announcement, the price of Universal shares in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange slid $2.25 a share, to $32.50 a
share, before recovering to $34.12{.
   The 9-month-long takeover attempt was especially costly for High
Voltage, which fought unsuccessfully in U.S. District Court in
Milwaukee and the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago to
overturn the anti-takeover law.
   Zeppos declined comment on the costs. But Guy A. Osborn,
president and chief executive of Universal Foods, said High Voltage
had spent more than $15 million in financing and legal costs.
   Osborn declined comment on the costs incurred by Universal Foods,
but he said he was pleased High Voltage, based in Burlington, Mass.,
finally had relented.
   ``We feel it's good news for us at the company and it's good news
for Wisconsin,'' he said. ``It's good news for business in general.
Our plan now is to devote 110 percent of our time to the business
goals we are committed to.''
   High Voltage began the battle with a $30.50-per-share tender
offer to Universal shareholders last December. Later, the company
upped the ante to $35 and then to $38. It later offered $42 per
share to Universal's board of directors for a negotiated merger.
   Universal's board rejected each offer and recommended
shareholders not tender their shares.
   The continued legal battle over the validity of the anti-takeover
law apparently frustrated High Voltage, said Richard Elam, a
Chicago-based investment analyst with Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi Inc. in
Milwaukee.
   ``They got bogged down in the legal system,'' Elam said. ``I
think High Voltage either became impatient or decided it cost too
much.''

<HEAD>Intel's New Chip A Breakthrough In Technology</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp. on Tuesday will unveil a
super-fast microprocessor that marks a breakthrough in chip design
by carrying out two tasks at once and up to 66 million instructions
per second.
   The 32-bit i960CA chip, smaller than a dime but more than twice
as fast as the i486 chip Intel introduced last spring, packs 600,000
transistors and is the first commercial chip to employ
``super-scalar'' technology.
   Super-scalar design allows a chip to execute more than one
instruction for each tick of its internal clock.
   Instead of cramming more transistors onto the chips to get them
to work faster during each cycle _ the i486, for example, has 1.2
million transistors _ Intel appears to have solved the elusive
problem of how to get the chip to carry out two instructions per
cycle.
   ``Imagine a car wash that can run two lanes through at a time
instead of one,'' said Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor
Report, an industry newsletter in Palo Alto. ``The car wash with two
lanes can obviously get more cars through in the same time.''
   Intel's speed rating for the i960CA chip is derived from taking
the chip's clock speed _ 33 million cycles per second _ and doubling
it.
   Many other chipmakers are working on super-scalar designs, said
Slater, who expects to see several of those products next year and
many more in 1991.
   Millard H. Phelps, an analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San
Francisco, said the i960 shows that ``we're going into a new era''
of microprocessors.
   ``Computers have been doing multitasking and multiprocessing and
we're going in that direction right down to the chip itelf,'' Phelps
said. ``That's quite a departure.''
   Intel, the company that invented the microprocessor, says the
i960CA is the fastest 32-bit chip yet. But the chip, which is
expected to be priced at about $300, isn't compatible with MS-DOS or
other software commonly used in desktop computers and isn't expected
to have an immediate impact on that market.
   Instead, the chip is aimed at laser printers, robot controllers,
telephone switching systems and automobiles of the future. The auto
industry, which is largely using 8-bit chips, is slowly moving into
faster 16-bit chips and may be several years away from using the
super-fast 32-bit chips to control brakes and engines.
   The i960 design has been endorsed by a group of avionics systems
suppliers, and could have a significant impact in that field, said
Thomas A. Thornhill of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in San Francisco.
   ``That's a pretty strong endorsement for the architecture,''
Thornhill said.
   ``What I think is interesting beyond the product itself,''
Thornhill said, ``is that some of the design techniques used to
achieve the super-scalar architecture may be applicable to Intel's
other chips and may show up in other products, like the i860 and
future versions of the 486. In the past Intel has tended to do some
of its design work in modular form, so can be applied or altered for
other chips.''
   Intel's i860 chip, introduced earlier this year, also is capable
of doing certain types of operations two at a time, but doesn't
employ the super-scalar design. The i860, a 64-bit microprocessor
with more than 1 million transistors, is capable of performing up to
80 million calculations per second. The $750 chip is designed for
high-end workstations and is more math-intensive than the i960CA.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major developments in the government
investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Nov. 14, 1986 _ Speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a $100
million penalty to settle charges of trading on inside information.
He agrees to cooperate in a probe of Drexel, its top financier
Michael Milken and others.
   April 23, 1987 _ Boesky pleads guilty to a single charge of
conspiracy to lie to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
punishable by five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
   Dec. 18, 1987 _ Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term
and no fine.
   March 24, 1988 _ Boesky begins serving sentence at a
minimum-security facility in Lompoc, Calif.
   Aug. 4, 1988 _ A grand jury indicts five partners in the
investment concern Princeton-Newport Partners and former Drexel
trader Bruce Newberg over an alleged tax fraud scheme, the
first-ever racketeering charges against securities professionals.
Defense lawyers call it a blackmail tactic to pressure defendants
into testifying against Milken, Drexel and others.
   Sept. 7, 1988 _ The SEC accuses Drexel, Milken and three other
employees of violating a wide range of securities laws, most in
connection with Boesky.
   Dec. 6, 1988 _ Cary Maultasch, a senior Drexel trader accused in
the SEC case and threatened with numerous indictments, turns state's
evidence in a plea-bargain agreement with the government.
   Dec. 7, 1988 _ Princeton Newport Partners liquidates because of
what lawyers for its indicted parters call brutal government misuse
of the racketeering laws to coerce them into cooperating in the
Drexel investigation.
   Dec. 21, 1988 _ Reversing earlier assertions of innocence, Drexel
agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a record $650 million
in fines and restitution to settle what became the biggest
securities fraud probe in history. Milken continues to assert
innocence.
   Jan. 25, 1989 _ The government files formal charges against
Drexel, publicly detailing for the first time the accusations to
which it will plead guilty. Most stem from the firm's alleged
relationship with Boesky.
   March 10, 1989 _ Drexel reportedly agrees to ban Milken for life
from the firm and prevent other employees from talking business with
him under a proposed settlement with the SEC.
   March 22, 1989 _ Drexel trader Lisa Jones is convicted of lying
to a grand jury, the first perjury conviction in the Drexel case.
   March 29, 1989 _ A grand jury indicts Milken, brother Lowell
Milken and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg on 98 counts of
racketeering and fraud. Potential penalties and fines could exceed
$12 billion plus long prison terms.
   April 7, 1989 _ The Milkens plead innocent.
   April 13, 1989 _ Drexel settles civil fraud case with the SEC,
under terms that subject the firm to unprecedented federal
monitoring for three years and force it to sever ties with Michael
Milken.
   April 25, 1980 _ Newberg pleads innocent.
   April 26, 1989 _ A judge rejects Boesky's petition for early
release from prison.
   June 15, 1989 _ Michael Milken resigns after 19 years at Drexel
to form his own consulting firm called International Capital Access
Group. Lowell Milken quits to return to practicing law.
   July 31, 1989 _ Princeton-Newport defendants are found guilty,
signaling that juries are capable of understanding complicated
securities-fraud allegations and are willing to convict under the
punitive racketeering laws.
   Aug. 23, 1989 _ Jones is sentenced to 18 months in prison and
ordered to pay more than $50,000 in fines and prison costs.
   Aug. 30, 1989 _ Drexel announces several high-level management
changes including the appointment of a new president, designed to
strengthen what the firm calls its competitive position.
   Aug. 31, 1989 _ The Washington Post discloses a confidential SEC
memo detailing what the agency claims was a secret July 1986 meeting
between Boesky and Milken aimed at concealing a $5.3 million payment
that is believed to be the heart of the government's case against
Milken.
   Sept. 7, 1989 _ After months of challenges and legal delays,
Drexel and federal prosecutors reach a final agreement on the guilty
plea. The breakthrough comes after the government drops a demand
that Drexel withhold Milken's 1988 compensation of more than $100
million.
   Sept. 11, 1989 _ Drexel pleads guilty to six felonies and begins
the payment of more than $650 million as punishment.

<HEAD>American Company to Supply Personal Computers to Soviet Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small American company has been picked to
supply schools in the Soviet Union with personal computers and help
set up Soviet factories to produce PCs, Soviet officials announced
Monday.
   Phoenix Group International of Irvine, Calif., was picked from
among 17 companies worldwide, including ones from West Germany,
France, Austria, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada and the Eastern bloc,
the Soviets said.
   All the computers involved are cleared for export by the U.S.
Department of Commerce.
   Soviet education officials said they hoped a joint venture with
Phoenix would supply 3 million personal computers to schools and
universities and 3 million more to other buyers in the Soviet Union
by 1994.
   Although it is impossible to estimate whether the Soviet sales
projections will be met, Phoenix Chairman Charles W. Missler said,
``It's a very substantial opportunity for us.''
   Phoenix, which broke even on sales of about $10 million in the
past 12 months, is majority-owned by Missler and its vice chairman,
Peter von Braun. Its lightly traded stock rose 25 cents a share to a
bid $4 after jumping $1 a share Friday on early word of the deal.
The late asking price was $5.50 a share.
   Phoenix was picked because it did not insist on being paid
entirely in dollars and was willing to help the Soviets learn the
computer-manufacturing business, said V.V. Krynkin, an official of
the State Committee for Public Education.
   A Phoenix affiliate, Resdel Industries, provided some of the
communications links for the Soyuz-Apollo joint space mission.
   ``A lot of other companies primarily looked at it from the point
of view of business. We're not talking here strictly from the point
of view of buying and selling products,'' Krynkin said through an
interpreter at a New York news conference.
   The new joint venture, Samcom, will start out by shipping kits
from the United States. The plan envisions the Soviets gradually
taking over manufacturing so that in five years, 85 percent of the
work will be done in the Soviet Union.
   The initial system for schools will consist of a network of 10
student workstations, clustered around an instructor's computer and
a ``file server'' computer that will store programs and data.
   The system is new technology that is being announced this week at
a computer networking trade show in Dallas, Missler said.
   Missler said he and von Braun saw the joint venture as a chance
to establish links that could lead to other business deals and
improve relations between the United States and Soviet Union.
   ``Perestroika in the Soviet Union requires that the quality of
Soviet specialists' training must be sharply increased, as well as
the level of education in general,'' Leonid Tereschenko, the deputy
chairman of the State Committee for Public Education, said in a
written statement.

   Sporadic selling pushed stock prices lower Monday
in the quietest trading in 10 weeks, extending last week's pullback
from record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 20 points
at midsession, closed with a 5.13 loss at 2,704.41.
   The average fell 42.55 points last week.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 126.02 million
shares, down from 154.09 million in the previous session and the
lightest total since 68.87 million were traded on July 3.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 150.81 million shares.
   Analysts said buying interest was limited, as it had been last
week, by concern that the market was due for at least a pause after
its sharp rise through the first eight months of the year.
   There also has been much talk on Wall Street that the Federal
Reserve will be reluctant to relax its credit policy any further
over the next several weeks.
   Fed policymakers are believed to be satisfied that the risk of a
recession have been averted for now, given recent data that showed a
stronger-than-expected pace of business activity.
   Nevertheless, interest rates declined slightly in the bond market
today, suggesting that traders believe the economy has room to keep
on expanding moderately without aggravating inflation or exerting
any strong upward pressure on interest rates.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose ~ to 40; General Electric gained [ to 56|, and Exxon added \ to
44|. But General Motors dropped | to 49\ and Eastman Kodak was down
[ at 49}.
   Manufacturers Hanover climbed 2~ to 42{. The company said it was
engaged in talks that might lead to the acquisition of a part

   Universal Foods fell | to 34[ in active trading. High Voltage
Engineering said it ended a bid to acquire the company.
   Ask Computer Systems fell 2\ to 8] in the over-the-counter
market. The company said it expects to report substantially lower
earnings for the fiscal first quarter that ends Sept. 30.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by close to 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
530 up, 936 down and 525 unchanged.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $11.39 billion, or 0.33
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

<TEXT>
   Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino did not
intentionally mislead gamblers with incorrect instructions in a
roulette guide that has been distributed since 1986, state gaming
officials said Monday.
   However, Robert Signore, of Ambler, Pa., says he lost $800
because of the faulty guide and has filed a lawsuit in small claims
court to recover the money, according to Monday's editions of The
Philadelphia Inquirer.
   Michael Weber, a spokesman for the casino run by developer Donald
Trump, said Monday the casino would have no comment on the lawsuit.
   State documents show that both the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement and the Casino Control Commission knew as early as
September 1986 that the Trump Castle gaming guide was inaccurate,
the newspaper said.
   The incorrect guides were distributed in 1986, 1987 and part of
1988, said Fred Gushin, deputy attorney general for the Division of
Gaming Enforcement.
   Gushin said Monday that he gave Trump Castle permission to
continue distributing the booklet until the stock was exhausted.
   Signore said he followed that guide after discovering it
contained mistakes. After 22 spins of the roulette wheel, Signore
had lost $600, but should have won $200 according to the guide.
   The DGE questioned why Signore continued to play after he
realized he was losing money, Gushin said.
   ``Why didn't he question it after the first bet?'' Gushin said.
``That seemed a bit curious.''
   Gushin said the error was not intentional and ``didn't appear all
that material.''
   Among the errors was an illustration showing that red paid off on
black and that even numbers paid off on odd numbers.
   Gushin said the casino followed the rules of roulette and that
the gaming guide did not unfairly lure patrons.

<TEXT>
   Automotive giant Daimler-Benz on
Monday accepted the conditions set by Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann for its planned takeover of a majority in the aerospace
and defense concern Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm.
   That means that West Germany's largest postwar merger can now be

reporters they were ``just within the limits of what could be
accepted without putting into question the total industrial
concept'' it had in mind.
   The Bonn government on Friday approved the merger on condition
that Daimler spin off certain Daimler and MBB defense technology
activities, that Daimler executives give up certain outside board
seats, and that it relieve the government of a stake in the troubled
European Airbus aerospace consortium three years earlier than
planned.
   Daimler said its approval is conditional on a similar nod from
MBB's current owners. But Reuter said he had ``no doubt'' that
Daimler would formally have completed the merger by the end of the
year.

<HEAD>BellSouth, LIN to Merge Cellular Telephone Operations</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

   BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. said
Monday they were merging their cellular telephone operations to
become a ``powerhouse'' company with a half-million customers and
dominance in some of the industry's top markets.
   ``They certainly will be a very big cellular company,'' said
Kevin Kelley, a spokesman for the Washington-based Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association. ``It looks like they could
be the largest.''
   The non-cash deal announced by the two companies comes just a few
months after New York-based LIN rejected an unsolicited $5.85
billion buyout offer from McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the
current No. 1 in potential customers. LIN rejected that offer,
demanding at least $6.22 billion.
   The merger, subject to the approval of LIN stockholders and
regulatory agencies, would give Atlanta-based BellSouth 50 percent
of the stock of the combined company. Before the completion of the
merger, New York-based LIN will spin off its television broadcasting
subsidiaries to stockholders and will pay each shareholder a $20 per
share special dividend.
   LIN currently operates in fewer markets than does BellSouth, but
LIN does business in five of the top 10 cellular phone markets. The
industry operates under a ``duopolistic'' system that allows only
two companies in each market, one of which is the local phone
company.
   The merger will give Atlanta-based BellSouth entry to the
lucrative New York, Philadelphia and Dallas markets and will
increase its presence in Los Angeles and Houston, where it already
had a joint operating arrangement with LIN.
   Those five cities all are among the nation's top 10 markets for
cellular telephone service.
   Overall, the new company, yet to be named, will start with about
500,000 customers in 43 markets.
   BellSouth, a ``Baby Bell'' company, had 1988 revenues of $13.7
billion and net income of $1.7 billion. LIN had $225 million in
revenues and earnings of $82 million, though company officials say
the rapid growth of LIN makes the company worth more than its
earnings figures might indicate.
   ``This new company clearly will be the powerhouse of the cellular
industry,'' said BellSouth Enterprises President William O. McCoy.
   Kenneth Leon, a cellular industry analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
in New York, said the BellSouth package is worth about $105 a share
to LIN shareholders.
   The McCaw offer was worth $120 a share, but Leon suggested the
BellSouth deal may be more desirable to LIN shareholders because it
keeps them involved in cellular instead of just giving them cash.
   McCaw owns 10 percent of LIN, and its offer for the rest of LIN
is still is on the table, McCaw spokesman Steve Bruce said. He said
he could not comment on the BellSouth-LIN deal because it has not
yet been filed with federal regulators, and McCaw has not seen the
official merger proposal.
   Bruce Barnes of Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co., LIN's financial
advisers, said the deal with BellSouth was attractive in ways that
the McCaw offer was not.
   ``What the other offer involved was someone buying the company
out for an amount of cash that the board felt was inadequate,'' he
said. ``In this, we have increased the value of our own stock and
will be able to participate in the upside of the cellular business.''
   Barnes said BellSouth provides LIN with new markets, technical
expertise and marketing know-how. And LIN offers BellSouth ``a
management team very good at making the cellular business
profitable.''
   LIN Chairman Donald A. Pels will become chairman, president and
chief executive officer of the combined company, which has not been
named. Earle Mauldin, group president for mobile systems at
BellSouth Enterprises, will be executive vice president and chief
operating officer.
   The combined company will serve markets totaling 62 million in
population. However, since they will not have full ownership in
cellular companies in each of the markets, its prorated potential
customer base would be 46 million. That leaves it behind McCaw's 52
million prorated potential customers. BellSouth currently ranks
third and LIN seventh in the industry measure.

   The dollar closed mostly lower amid profit-taking
on domestic markets Monday after rising in overseas trading.
   Gold prices edged lower.
   Analysts said the dollar's upward momentum was slowed by
increases in market interest rates in other countries, including
West Germany, and U.S. traders, fearing the dollar would decline in
response to those developments, rushed to take profits.
   ``Interest rate differentials begin to work against the dollar at
this level,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer, Harris Trust &amp; Co.
in Chicago.
   However, Holzer said the dollar still had a firm undertone.
   In earlier overseas trading, the dollar rose, but dealers said
three upcoming economic reports from Washington have made traders
reluctant to push the U.S. currency much higher.
   The Commerce Department's August retail sales figures will be
announced Thursday, and on Friday, reports are due on the July trade
deficit figures and August producer prices.
   ``Anyone buying dollars at this stage, ahead of the numbers later
this week is taking a big risk,'' said a U.S. investment bank dealer
in London.
   The financial markets are concerned that the Federal Reserve
might change its monetary policy in response to the reports, which
will give an indication of the economy's health. If the economy is
strong, the Fed would be expected to keep credit tight _ a move
dollar investors would prefer.
   The dollar fell against the British pound in New York. It cost
$1.5460 to buy one British pound, compared with $1.5380 on Friday.
In London earlier, a pound cost $1.5450, cheaper than $1.5505 late
Friday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with
Friday's prices, included: 1.9865 West German marks, down from
1.9950; 1.7135 Swiss francs, down from 1.7245; 6.6910 French francs,
down from 6.7195; 1,425.875 Italian lire, up from 1,421.00; and
1.18715 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18745.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.9875 West German marks, up from 1.9795; 1.7150
Swiss francs, up from 1.7080; 6.6970 French francs, up from 6.6710;
2.2425 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2320; 1,424.75 Italian lire, up
1,421.70; and 1.1873 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1877.
   In Tokyo, where the dollar began its trading day, the dollar rose
1.15 yen to a closing 147.77 yen from Friday's 146.62 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 147.65 yen, and in New
York, it fell to 146.70 yen from late Friday's 147.20 yen.
   Gold prices slipped in all major markets.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $358.10 a
troy ounce for gold, down from $359.40 on Friday, and on the
Commodity Exchange in New York, gold slipped to $359.20 an ounce
from $359.40 on Friday.
   Gold fell earlier in London to a late bid price of $358.75 a troy
ounce, compared with late Friday's $360.00.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell 21 cents to close at a bid $358.90.
   The Zurich markets were closed for a holiday.
   Silver bullion prices also fell.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver closed at $5.051 a
troy ounce, slightly lower than late Friday's $5.053. On the London
market, silver traded at a late bid price of $5.08 a troy ounce,
down from Friday's $5.12.

<HEAD>Commodity Option Firms Accused of Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators sued two commodity options
firms Monday, charging they misled customers on investment risks
that ran up millions of dollars in losses over five years while the
firms took hefty sales commissions.
   Siegel Trading Company Inc., based in Chicago, and International
Trading Group Ltd., with headquarters in San Mateo, Calif., were
sued separately by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at
federal court for the central district of California.
   ``This is probably the largest anti-fraud sales solicitation case
the CFTC has ever brought,'' said Dennis Klejna, director of the
commission's enforcement division.
   A spokesman for Chicago-based Siegel was not in his office when
called for comment and did not immediately return a reporter's phone
call.
   In San Mateo, Calif., ITG issued a statement that said it was
reviewing the charges but intended to defend against them
vigorously, adding ``ITG sales practices comply with applicable law
and regulation, do not mislead potential or actual customers and are
proper in all respects.''
   ITG also said it ``is not connected in any way`` with Siegel.
   Options are contracts that give their owners the right to conduct
a specified transaction, such as buying or selling a certain number
of shares of a given common stock, at a set price within a stated
period of time _ usually just a few months.
   Options can be highly risky and since they are usually short-term
investment vehicles, they involve a lot of buying and selling, for
which commissions must be paid each time.
   In the International Trading Group (ITG) case, the CFTC stated
that between Jan. 1, 1984 and May 31 this year, more than 85 percent
of the firm's customers lost a total of $428 million _ $283 million
of it in commissions collected by ITG.
   ``ITG collects a 40 percent commission premium on the options
themselves,''said Klejna, who said other firms charge
``substantially less.''
   Explaining the long lag time between when the alleged illegal
activity began and the filing of civil charges, Klejna denied it had
anything to do with recent congressional criticism of the CFTC,
which is up for reauthorization later this month.
   ``It has everything to do with the fact that we've looking at
these things for a long time,'' said Klejna adding that it ``takes a
long time'' to investigate and file charges in such cases.
   ITG also maintained offices in San Francisco, Foster City,
Newport Beach and San Diego, Calif., Honolulu and in Coconut Grove,
Fla.
   In the other case, officials said Siegel also charged 45 percent
commission plus $155 for each trade. From Jan. 1, 1984 until the
present, according to the complaint, about 85 percent of the firm's
customers lost money, totaling $33.6 million. For the same period,
the firm took in $40 million in commissions.
   The CFTC charged that ITG fraudulently misrepresented and omitted
important facts when it sold dealer and exchange-traded options to
customers through mass mailings of promotional materials, nationwide
advertising and high pressure phone sales, among other sales tactics.
   The complaint alleged that ITG misled customers about the risks
involved and the returns to be expected in the commodity options
market; the experience and expertise of its sales force and the
skills of its research department.
   Officials also charged that the firm claimed it had ``an
outstanding track record,'' which the CFTC maintains is not borne
out by the performance of ITG customers' accounts.
   ITG also failed to diligently supervise its employees while
encouraging ``boiler-room'' type tactics of unsolicited,
high-pressure telephone sales pitches, the CFTC charged.
   In the other case, the CFTC charged that Siegel, which employs 80
people at offices in Los Angeles and Irvine, Calif., directed each
sales person to make up to 100 telephone sales solicitations a day.
   More than 7,000 customer accounts were opened with Siegel and
customers were falsely told they would earn ``fabulous profits''
trading commodity options with the firm without being told the
actual risk, according to the complaint.
   The complaint also stated that Siegel also solicited customers
through a 15-minute commodities television program broadcast
transmitted on cable television every business day. The name of the
program was not given in the complaint and Klejna declined to
discuss it.
   Both lawsuits seek preliminary injunctions barring the firms from
continuing their alleged illegal practices. Klejna said the CFTC
also would seek to have the firms return all profits made through
illegal practices.
   Klejna would not comment on whether evidence from the civil cases
had been turned over to federal prosecutors.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Climb In Whipsaw Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices rose sharply Monday on New York's Commodity
Exchange in a volatile session that saw the price for December
delivery whipsawed over a range of more than 6 cents a pound.
   On other markets, precious metals futures fell, energy futures
were mixed, grains and soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 3 cents to 3.1 cents higher with the
contract for September delivery at $1.303 a pound. The more actively
traded December contract settled at $1.256 after trading between
$1.19 and $1.257 a pound.
   Prices nosedived at the opening in reaction to the London Metal
Exchange's report that copper stocks in the exchange-approved
warehouse had risen last week by 4,800 metric tons, an unexpectedly
large increase.
   The big buildup in LME stocks appeared to contradict the
tight-supply fears that have provided the main support for copper's
price during the past 1{ months.
   But the market bottomed out quickly, rallied steadily and ended
with a strong burst of buying by some of the same speculative funds
that had sold the market earlier in the day.
   ``The decline was probably excessive,'' said Bette Raptopoulos,
metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Analysts could not agree on a reason for the turnaround. William
O'Neill, director of research with Elders Futures Inc., cited strong
buying by the Japanese, who have been hit hard by the two-month
shutdown of the Bouganville copper mine in Papua New Guinea.
   Continued violence in that area on Monday reinforced predictions
that production at Bouganville will not resume this year.
   Meanwhile, a 9-week-old old strike at a Highland Valley Copper
Co. mine in British Colombia continued Monday, and a strike at the
Chilean Copper Co.'s El Salvador mine entered a second week after
workers there voted against a settlement offer.
   O'Neill said copper's fundamentals were still supportive despite
the market's retreat from about $1.37 a pound, a decline of about 5
percent, in the past two weeks.
   ``We are dealing with a market that has a bullish supply-demand
equation,'' he said. ``I think the market's healthier after this
type of correction.''
   Precious-metals futures slipped lower on the Comex. Gold settled
20 cents to 50 cents lower with October at $360.90 a troy ounce;
silver was 0.2 cent to 0.8 cent lower with September at $5.051 a
troy ounce.
   Energy futures ended mixed in choppy trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange following a sharp rally last week.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior trader with E.D.&amp; F. Man International
Futures, said concerns of overproduction among members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries put a damper on
Monday's trading.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent higher to 7
cents lower with October at $19.76 a barrel; heating oil was .48
cent to .73 cent lower with October at 56.01 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .02 cent to .70 cent lower with October at
57.07 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for drier weather in the
Midwest and fading fears of an overnight freeze in important corn
and soybean areas.
   Trading activity was light as players evened up their positions
and took to the sidelines ahead of Tuesday's Agriculture Department
crop report, which is expected to project smaller corn and soybean
crops than the USDA's August report.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents lower to { cent higher with September at
$3.93 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to { cent higher with
September at $2.38{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to \ cents
higher with September at $1.38\ a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 3{
cents lower with September at $6.07 a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures settled
.20 cent lower to .33 cent higher with October at 71.67 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .12 cent higher with
September at 82.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .57 cent lower to
.35 cent higher with October at 38.75 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent lower to .27 cent higher with February at
46.17 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Japanese Subsidiary, Big in U.S. Real Estate, Moves Into London</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of Japan's Shuwa Corp. that owns
a string of landmark U.S. office buildings including Los Angeles'
Arco Towers said Monday it was getting into European real estate
with a 250-year lease on Ashdown House in London.
   Shuwa Investments Corp., a Los Angeles-based real estate
investment and development firm, said it would form a joint venture
with Tishman West Cos., a Los Angeles commercial real estate
company, to complete the deal.
   The partnership, Tishman Shuwa Victoria Partners, will pay the
Church Commissioners for England and Shell Pensions Trust Ltd. 100
million British pounds, about $154 million, for the
195,000-square-foot project in Victoria, a prime London office and
retail district near Buckingham Palace and Westminster Cathedral.
   ``Shuwa Investments is ready to fulfill the third link of the
company's corporate strategy,'' said Takaji Kobayashi, president of
the Los Angeles-based subsidiary.
   ``More than 10 years ago, Shuwa successfully expanded operations
from Asia to the United States,'' Kobayashi said. ``This joint
venture positions the company for further acquisitions of commercial
properties in England and other European countries.''
   Kobayashi's father, Shigeru Kobayashi, has become one of the
world's richest men through his giant real estate company,
Tokyo-based Shuwa Corp.
   He bought the Arco Plaza complex for $620 million in 1985 in Los
Angeles. About that time he also paid $165 million for the former
ABC building in Manhattan.
   Shuwa now owns 35 major U.S. office buildings, including the U.S.
News &amp; World Report Building in Washington, Quaker Tower in Boston
and the Paine Webber Building in Boston.
   Ashdown House is 11 stories high with stepped pyramid elevations
and bronze-tinted reflective windows. Completed in 1975, it is 100
percent occupied by government offices and retail shops, according
to a joint press release from Shuwa and Tishman West.
   Tishman West already has a property management operation in
London, but this will be the first building it owns.
   ``This joint venture partnership will position Tishman West to
actively acquire other London properties,'' said Perry S. Herst Jr.,
Tishman chairman and chief executive. ``We also plan to continue
seeking high-quality joint ventures on the Continent.''

<HEAD>Profit Falls to $3 Million in Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial News Network Inc. reported Monday that
earnings dropped to about $3 million in its latest fiscal year from
$4.7 million in the comparable year-earlier period, mainly due to
higher programming costs.
   The cable television network said earnings per share were 17
cents in the fiscal year ended June 30, compared with 30 cents in
the ten-month period ended June 30, 1988.
   FNN said it was required under financial reporting requirements
to compare its latest fiscal year with the earlier ten-month period
since that was the first full period of its new fiscal year.
   The company had changed its fiscal year to run through Aug. 31
from the earlier date of June 30.
   FNN attributed the decline in earnings mainly to increased costs
stemming from new prime-time business programming.
   Revenue rose to $44 million in the latest fiscal year from $32
million in the ten-month period. The year-earlier figure reflects
the discontinuation of TelShop, a TV home shopping service.
   ``FNN succeeded in securing its niche as the brand name, cable
television source of business and financial news,'' FNN Executive
Vice President C. Steven Bolen said in a statement. ``FNN faced
certain competitive market forces this past year, and succeeded in
maintaining, and, in fact, improving its position.''
   FNN currently provides business, financial and sports information
to around 32 million homes in the United States that subscribe to it.

<HEAD>Two Leading Gaming Device Makers Reach Tentative Accord in Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the nation's leading gaming device
makers avoided a federal court battle after reaching a tentative
accord Monday in a copyright dispute over a video poker machine.
   International Gaming Technology agreed not to pursue a copyright
and trade infringement lawsuit against Japanese-owned Universal Co.
Ltd., if its Nevada-based distributing company promises not to sell
video poker machines that IGT claimed were copies of its ``Player's
Edge'' machine.
   Under the stipulation, IGT has until next Monday to amend its
lawsuit to continue the dispute if, after examining Universal's
redesigned video poker machine, it decides Universal's new machine
does duplicate IGT's ``Player's Edge'' game.
   Donald Lattin, attorney for Universal Co., said he doesn't
believe IGT will pursue the lawsuit because ``Universal's video
poker machine is substantially different than IGT's.''
   ``All of the video poker machines look basically alike on the
outside,'' Lattin said. ``It's like buying a refrigerator. There're
lots of different brands, but they look the same.''
   Lattin said the inner components of Universal's video poker
machine are very different from IGT's and Universal never let IGT
officials examine the inside of the machine during the dispute.
   Larry Semenza, the Reno attorney for Nevada-based IGT refused to
comment on the lawsuit, saying the parties had agreed not to talk to
reporters about the dispute in what is a highly lucrative and
growing market.
   ``There was a stipulation entered into,'' said Semenza, making
his only comment about the document filed Monday in U.S. District
Court.
   The hearing before Judge Bruce Thompson was scheduled to
determine whether to grant IGT's motion for a preliminary injunction
to prevent Universal from distributing the disputed video poker
machine.
   Earlier this summer, Thompson handed IGT an early victory in the
dispute, issuing a temporary restraining order to prevent Universal
from distributing its disputed video poker machine.
   IGT attorneys said the company's ``Player's Edge'' machine was
displayed during a February 1988 trade show and must have been
copied by Universal workers who viewed the device.
   IGT, now the No. 1 gaming device manufacturer in the nation, and
Universal are battling along with Bally's Manufacturing for a bigger
piece of the gambling market.
   Lattin said the gaming device market has become very competitive
because of rapidly changing computer and electronic technologies
that make gaming devices almost obsolete within a couple of years
after introduction.
   Under the stipulation between the companies, if IGT doesn't
object to the design of Universal's latest video poker machine, the
Japanese company can approach gaming authorities for approval to
distribute the device.
   IGT and Universal have been involved in other disputes, including
one last year in which IGT complained to Nevada gaming regulators
about a ``near miss'' slot maching Universal was distributing.

   A toy company's dream of turning the ghoulish movie character
Freddy Krueger into a popular doll could turn out to be a nightmare
for business.
   A religious group Monday urged consumers not to buy the talking
doll based on the fiend from the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' movies,
which Matchbox Toys (USA) Ltd. announced last week would be
available for Halloween sales.
   The group also urged a boycott of stores that stock the doll and
a boycott of all other Matchbox toys.
   ``This doll is the product of a sick mind. The fact that a major
toy manufacturer would promote this doll is tragic,'' said Rev.
Donald E. Wildmon, executive director of the American Family
Association.
   ``We call upon concerned Americans not only to refuse to purchase
the Freddy doll, but to boycott all stores which sell it and to
boycott other Matchbox Toys products,'' said Wildmon, who is a
United Methodist minister.
   The American Family Association, formerly known as the National
Federation for Decency, has advocated numerous boycotts in the past.
   Earlier this year it protested Pepsico Inc.'s use of rock star
Madonna in television commercials for Pepsi-Cola because of her
performance in a separate video for her song, ``Like a Prayer'' that
showed a burning cross and other images that offended some
Christians.
   Pepsi in April withdrew its TV commercial featuring Madonna,
saying consumers were confusing the music video with its commercial,
which contained no religious imagery.
   Allen Wildmon, associate director of American Family Association
and Donald Wildmon's brother, said the group is asking supporters to
contact their local stores and encourage them to refuse to carry the
Freddy Krueger doll.
   ``We hope to keep this doll from being marketed,'' he said.
   The American Family Association Journal has a circulation of
about 380,000, including nearly 180,000 churches and pastors.
   Freddy Krueger, the main character in the five ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' horror films, takes revenge on residents of a town by
murdering teenagers. The latest sequel, ``A Nightmare on Elm Street
5: The Dream Child,'' was released over the summer.
   The film character, who has long blade-like fingernails, has
developed a cult following and has generated an estimated $300
million in domestic and foreign box office receipts and
videocassette sales.

   British investor Sir James Goldsmith lost
another round Monday in his attempt to block state insurance
regulators from reviewing his $21.1 billion bid for BAT Industries
PLC, the parent of insurance giant Farmer's Group Inc.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie rejected the request by
Goldsmith and his Hoylake Investments Ltd. for a preliminary
injunction barring the review by California's Department of
Insurance.
   A federal judge in Washington state denied a similar request
Friday, as did a Texas judge last month. In another case Friday,
insurance regulators in Kansas denied Goldsmith's attempts to escape
regulatory review there.
   Goldsmith is scrambling to get an extension of the Oct. 7
deadline by which he must complete the acquisition of BAT under
British takeover rules.
   He has agreed to sell Farmers, the third-largest home and auto
insurance company in the United States, to the French insurer Axa
Midi Assurances for $4.5 billion if his takeover succeeds for BAT,
the London-based tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services
concern.
   Meantime, Goldsmith filed federal suits in all nine states in
which Farmers does business, contending state regulatory review of
the proposed hostile takeover is an unconstitutional infringement on
foreign commerce.
   After the nearly two-hour hearing Monday in Los Angeles federal
court, however, Rafeedie refused to grant the requested preliminary
injunction.
   ``The plaintiff has not demonstrated the probability of success
or that the state act directly regulates foreign commerce,''
Rafeedie said.
   The state statutes involved give insurance departments authority
to protect insurance policyholders by reviewing insurance industry
takeovers.

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca met with
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Monday and said that Mexico
needs to become more competitive in the world trade arena, Mexican
news agencies reported.
   ``What is needed now is to be competitive on the international
level, attract investment and technology,'' Iacocca told the
independent news agency Excelsior.
   After a private meeting with Salinas in the presendential
residence, Iacocca described Mexico's achievement of a 20 percent
annual inflation rate as ``stupendous.''
   A government wage-price control plan has brought Mexico's
inflation rate down from 159.2 percent in 1987.
   Iacocca said his company plans new investments in Mexico.
   ``We have been here for 50 years and we'll keep investing,'' he
told the government news agency Notimex. ``There will be a better
future and a stronger economy here.''
