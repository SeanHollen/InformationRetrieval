   Until June 2, Sousuke Uno was seen as a successful
Japanese politician who had probably reached the pinnacle of his
career as foreign minister.
   Then he became his party's last-ditch choice for prime minister,
and his world quickly crumbled amid a welter of accusations about
his private life and a crushing defeat suffered by the party he
reluctantly led.
   On Monday Uno said he would resign to take responsibility for
the Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in elections for the upper
house of Parliament, leaving his deeply troubled party in its
second leadership crisis in two months.
   Uno, 66, will remain in office until the party chooses a new
leader, which may take weeks. It took more than six weeks before
the Liberal Democrats finally chose him to take over from Noboru
Takeshita.
   Uno was not the party's first choice. For weeks its elders had
tried to persuade the scandal-free Masayoshi Ito to become prime
minister, but Ito refused.
   Uno was not a party leader or a previous contender for the
premiership, and his name was not mentioned until late in the
chase. But when he emerged as the choice, it appeared the party had
made a safe but not exciting choice of a competent caretaker.
   The son of a wealthy sake-brewing family, Uno was untainted by
the Recruit bribery scandal that had ruled out all the party's
elite. He had served in a number of Cabinet posts before becoming
foreign minister and he had diplomatic skills to represent Japan at
the approaching summit in Paris of the seven industrialized
democracies.
   But less than a week after he took office on June 2, published
allegations that he kept a paid geisha mistress began to plague him.
   The allegations about his private life _ he did not quite deny
them, saying instead he had done nothing immoral _ became another
major problem the Liberal Democrats struggled with as crucial
parliamentary elections approached.
   The party had suffered a steep decline in popularity from the
Recruit scandal that embroiled its elite in suspicions of
bribe-taking. It also was on the defensive over a new sales tax and
agriculture policy.
   Although prime ministers usually are major campaigners to boost
their party's hopes before an election, Uno made few public
appearances in advance of Sunday's vote for half the seats in the
upper house.
   Analysts predicted he would resign if the party did poorly. It
did, losing its majority in the upper house, and Uno quickly
followed by taking the traditional step of resigning to take
responsibility.
   His political epitaph may be the words he reportedly uttered on
June 27 in a plea to party leaders to let him step down: ``I didn't
become prime minister because I wanted to.''

   The search for victims of United
Airlines Flight 232 ended Saturday with the death toll tentatively
set at 110. United, meanwhile, announced it is visually inspecting
all engines in its DC-10 fleet.
   ``We feel comfortable enough that ... the search has been
terminated for victims,'' said Gary Brown, spokesman for the
Woodbury County Emergency Services.
   While officials were confident that all of the bodies had been
recovered, there still was disagreement on how many were killed
when the DC-10 jetliner cartwheeled and burned Wednesday at the
Sioux Gateway Airport. United said it was 110 and the National
Transportation Safety Board said it was 111.
   But a NTSB spokesman, Ted Lopatkiewicz, said at a news briefing
late Saturday the agency was ``deferring to United. That doesn't
mean we agree. United is the authority on this.''
   A list compiled by The Associated Press of names supplied by
United Airlines and family, friends and employers of the victims
had put the toll of dead and missing at 111. But two people listed
with the same last name and slightly different first names were
determined to be the same person.
   A doctor at one of the hospitals treating the injured said more
patients could die and that the survivors might have permanent
injuries. Of the 296 people on board, 186 survived.
   At the news briefing Saturday evening, NTSB spokesman Jim
Burnett said the parts of rear No. 2 engine that disintegrated
during a flight from Denver to Chicago were well within the limits
of time in which they had to be replaced.
   Burnett also said investigators interviewed Flight 232's second
officer Saturday, flight engineer Dudley Dvorak. Dvorak told
inspectors he reported complete loss of fluid in all three
hydraulic lines after the rear engine blew apart, leaving Capt. Al
C. Haynes without control of wings or tail surfaces.
   In another development, a United Airlines official said at a
news conference here that the airline has initiated ``a visual
inspection of all engines in our DC-10 fleet. A prudent person
would do some additional looking and we are.''
   James Guyette, executive vice president of operations for
United, said the inspections should be completed on Monday.
   So far, they have uncovered ``very, very minor'' flaws, he said,
adding that DC-10 airplanes in the United fleet are not being
grounded during the check.
   In Chariton, Iowa, meanwhile, an Amtrak train carrying survivors
of the United flight struck and killed a 6-year-old boy as the
youngster tried to free his bicycle that was stuck on the tracks.
   Jason Lee Howie was struck by Amtrak's eastbound California
Zephyr after the train had picked up several crash survivors at
Omaha, Neb., said Amtrak spokesman Art Lloyd, who added that he did
not know how many survivors were on board.
   In Sioux City, the wreckage of the wide-body jet remained
sprawled over the airport Saturday as NTSB crews sifted wreckage
for clues to what caused the tail engine to disintegrate in flight.
   NTSB spokesman Burnett said four cranes were moved in to steady
a giant hunk of fuselage in the cornfield next to the runway.
Inspectors were able to determine that no bodies were underneath,
he said.
   So far, the airline has positively identified 19 dead and
tentatively identified 29, and hopes to have 80 percent of the
bodies positively identified by Sunday, Guyette said. ``Great care
has to be exercised to make sure a mistake is not made,'' he said.
   Forty-five people were still hospitalized Saturday. Nineteen,
including four in critical condition, were at St. Luke's Medical
Center and 26, including five listed as critical, were at the
Marian Health Center. Marian confirmed that one patient had died
there overnight but would not give a name.
   Dr. Larry Foster, medical director for the burn unit at St.
Luke's, said they have 10 patients in the unit, who have burns from
2 percent to 93 percent of their bodies. Most suffered burns on
face and extremities.
   All four members of the flight crew, including one off-duty
pilot who left his seat in the cabin and to help in the effort to
control the plane, were being treated at Marian. Their injuries
were not critical, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Denning.
   Brown said there was no need to look for other victims at the
airport. ``The numbers match, the numbers balance,'' he said.
   Dr. Mike Wolpert, director of trauma services at Marian, said
the five patients in critical condition are still in danger.
``They're not stable by any means,'' he said.
   ``There are a lot of broken necks and broken backs. Some of them
might be permanently disabled. Some of them have definite brain
swelling now but it's going to be quite a while before we know if
that damage is going to be permanent.''
   He said patients listed in serious or guarded condition have
multiple fractures but are not in life-threatening condition. A
large number of them, he said, have ankle injuries.
   The airport is open but large pieces of the doomed jet are
strewn over the area. Still in a cornfield is the large piece of
the fuselage from which survivors were able to crawl to safety, and
the charred remains of the tail section, which flipped over the
other wreckage as the plane broke up.
   ``There's a lot of documentation left to be done,'' said NTSB
spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz, declining to predict when investigators
would leave the scene. ``It takes a long time to document an
aircraft as big as this.''
   The drama of the final moments in the cockpit was detailed
Friday as Burnett said the off-duty pilot, hearing the explosion in
engine No. 2, bolted to the cockpit to see if he could help.
   Burnett said the off-duty pilot, identified as Dennis Fitch,
found the airplane nearly unmanageable since the tail engine
apparently threw wreckage through the airplane's hydraulic systems.
   Without control of wings or tail surfaces, the pilots' only
recourse was to crudely steer the plane by varying the thrust of
the two remaining engines.
   ``The only control mechanism that the crew had was to use engine
thrust,'' Burnett said. The off-duty pilot ``was on his knees
manipulating the throttle.''
   ``What you have here is a situation of two men desperately
trying to get whatever control they can out of the aircraft,'' he
said.
   Seven minutes before he attempted an emergency landing at Sioux
Gateway Airport, pilot Al C. Haynes told the control tower,
``Whatever you do, keep us away from the city,'' Burnett quoted
Haynes as telling investigators during two one-hour interviews on
Friday. The airport is about seven miles from downtown.
   The crew also found that the airplane would only turn right,
further hindering efforts to line up with a runway.

<HEAD>President of U.N. Assembly Denies Charges He Misused Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dante Caputo, president of the
U.N. General Assembly, on Saturday denied charges he misused public
funds while serving as Argentina's foreign minister from late 1983
until four months ago.
   On Friday, the Foreign Ministry filed charges in criminal court
alleging Caputo failed to adequately explain how he spent nearly
$190,000 of the $538,200 he received for personal expenses while he
was foreign minister. The ministry accused him of misappropriating
public funds.
   ``If there is a charge, the Justice Department should
investigate to see what it is about,'' Caputo said Saturday in a
radio interview.
   The case against Caputo involves the apparent use of the same
stamp on receipts allegedly received in New York, Cyprus and
Stockholm, Sweden. The stamp was found at the Foreign Ministry, a
source there said, along with blank copies of hotel stationery.
   A ministry official was arrested in connection with the case,
police confirmed Saturday. He was not identified, nor were the
charges disclosed.
   In an interview with Radio El Mundo, Caputo said, ``I don't know
anything about the contents'' of the charges. About his alleged
involvement he said: ``The only thing I do with such funds is sign
a receipt, and after that I don't worry about the topic.''
   The complaint filed by the Foreign Ministry stated in part:
   ``Dante Mario Caputo acted as though it is up to the government
to justify the courtesy expenses that he says were made in New
York, Stockholm and Cyprus, presenting papers that were stamped as
paid with one and the same stamp.''
   ``Documents appear that ... do not meet the mimimal appearance
of seriousness,'' the complaint stated. Caputo personally received
$538,200 for expenses, it said, ``and he has the legal obligation
to account for it.''

   An 11-year-old boy successfully
finished his bid Saturday to become the youngest pilot to circle
the globe, landing safely at home after a trip that took him across
the far reaches of the Soviet Union.
   Tony Aliengena touched down under bright, hazy skies at about
2:30 p.m. and turned off the engine of his plane at Orange County's
John Wayne International Airport, where he started his ``Friendship
Flight '89'' seven weeks and 19,000 miles ago.
   ``I want to meet President Bush and talk with my parents and see
if they will take me to Disneyland,'' the boy said after landing.
   Flight observer Gunter Hagen, who accompanied the boy during the
entire flight, said he will submit his records to the National
Aeronautic Association in Washington, D.C., which sanctions flight
records.
   Hagen said he will recommend the group create a new category for
youngest pilot to fly around the world and grant Tony that status.
   Aliengena's father Gary, who accompanied his son on the flight,
emerged from the plane and then lifted his son from the aircraft,
along with his sister Alaina, 10, and Tony's Soviet pen pal, Roman
Tcheremnykh, 10.
   Aliengena earlier Saturday took off from Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport, stopped for refueling in Reno, Nev., and
then headed for Orange County.
   The pilot and his entourage decided to skip a stop at Oakland,
Calif., because of a delay in Alaska that put them a day behind
schedule, said Bob Combie in Seattle, a spokesman for the boy.
   ``They are all glad to be back in the lower 48,'' Combie said.
   The final leg was to be about 1,300 miles, he said.
   After he arrived in Seattle Friday night, Tony said that when he
gets home he wants to ride his bike for a while ``and then I'd like
to meet President Bush, maybe.''
   The fourth-grader flew a borrowed single-engine plane to Sea-Tac
from Juneau, Alaska, along with his flight-instructor father, Gary,
his mother, Susan, 10-year-old sister Alaina, and the rest of his
party.
   The single-engine Cessna Centurion Tony started with crashed
Tuesday while his father was taking off from Golovin, Alaska, 90
miles from Nome, for a fishing side trip. No one was seriously hurt.
   That crash, which is under investigation by the Federal Aviation
Administration, was the only sour note on the 19,000-mile trip with
35 stops in seven countries, Tony said Friday night.
   ``I really liked the Soviet Union, especially Moscow,'' he said.
``I also liked Boston because that's where all my relatives are.''
   Tony and his party, a second plane carrying some of them, made
14 stops in the Soviet Union alone.
   Tony said aviation will always be just a hobby. ``I want to be
an orthopedic surgeon,'' he said.
   He plans to visit the White House to see President Bush and
present him with the Friendship Scroll, which is more than 1,000
feet long and contains more than 200,000 signatures of U.S.
children.

   A CSX Transportation Inc. freight train
derailed Saturday, igniting a fire in a tank car loaded with toxic
chemicals and in at least one house, officials said. More than 400
people were evacuated.
   At least seven people were evaluated at hospitals, apparently
because of problems caused by fume inhalation, said Saginaw County
spokesman Tom Caylor. ``They ... appear to be OK at this time,'' he
said.
   Fourteen of 37 cars on the CSX Transportation Inc. train
derailed; seven were empty and seven were chemical tank cars, said
CSX spokesman Ripley Watson. Officials initially believed at least
two cars were afire, but later determined only one caught fire and
was still burning.
   A 1-square-mile evacuation area around the derailment site was
broadened to 10 miles, forcing more than 400 people from their
homes, Caylor said. State Police Sgt. Thomas Mynsberge said the
evacuation order could remain in effect for two days.
   An order to evacuate the southeast corner of Midland was
canceled late Saturday and those residents were told to stay
inside, close their windows and turn off ventilation systems in
their homes, said Midland Fire Chief Leo Gay. Fumes from the fire
are ``drifting into more populated areas,'' Beeson said.
   Earlier, a plume of black smoke rose from the burning cars, said
Dow spokesman Gary Black. Winds were calm after the derailment just
before noon.
   At least one house was burning, Black said, but the extent of
damage wasn't known.
   It was not clear if the house and the train car were burning in
separate fires, officials said after conducting aerial surveys.
Heavy smoke and intense heat prevented firefighters from getting
closer.
   Five tank cars were carrying acrylonitrile and styrene, both
used in the manufacture of rubber; acrylic acid; naphtha, and
Chlorosilenes, a product of Dow Corning Co., a joint venture
between Dow and Corning Glass Works that produces silicon products.
   Acrylonitrile is a highly flammable liquid that is toxic if
inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Styrene also is toxic if
inhaled or ingested. Acrylic acid irritates the skin and is toxic
if inhaled. Naphtha is highly flammable.
   Black said a company emergency team was at the site between
Midland and Saginaw, about 80 miles northwest of Detroit.
   ``They are in the process of separating the cars that are not
involved in the derailment and going in with the protective suits
to identify which cars are involved in the fire,'' he said Saturday
afternoon.
   He said the derailment involved a load headed for the Midland
Cogeneration venture, a joint project of Dow and Consumers Power
Co. to convert the utility's never-finished nuclear power plant
into a gas-fired generator.
   The same tracks have been used for more than 10 years to carry
toxic chemicals between Freeport, Texas, and Midland, on a
regularly scheduled run known as the Unit Train.

   A predawn helicopter crash during
training exercises Saturday at this desert post killed six soldiers
and injured one other, Army officials said.
   The soldiers were aboard a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter when the
aircraft went down at about 4 a.m. 14 miles northeast of Fort
Irwin's main garrison, said Maj. John Wagstaffe.
   All the soldiers involved were from the First Cavalry Division
based in Fort Hood, Texas, said Wagstaffe. They were at the
1,000-square-mile base 120 miles northeast of Los Angeles for a
three-week training exercise that ended Saturday.
   Wagstaffe said no other aircraft was involved in the crash,
whose cause was being investigated. The identities of the victims
were not immediately available, and likely would not be released
until Sunday or Monday, he said.
   The injured soldier, Corp. Scott A. Mathews, suffered a broken
right leg and a bruised lung, and was listed in stable condition at
Loma Linda Hospital in San Bernardino, Wagstaffe said.
   Sgt. 1st Class Armando Carrasco, a public affairs spokesman at
Fort Irwin, identified the dead as: Lt. Col. William C.
Whittingstall; Capt. Marlon D. Joseph; 1st Lt. Robert B. Wilson;
Chief Warrant Officer 4 Roy A. Westbrook; Chief Warrant Officer 3
Delbert S. Morrow and Staff Sgt. Stephen P. Thompson.
   Ages and hometowns for the victims were unavailable, Carrasco
said.

<TEXT>
   A top career diplomat suspected of
collaborating with Soviet agents in Vienna had access to some of
the nation's most sensitive non-nuclear secrets and once ran the
U.S. embassy in that espionage-rich city before he was sent home
for insubordination, sources said Saturday.
   Meanwhile, Felix S. Bloch, former deputy chief of mission at the
embassy in Austria, has received FBI approval to leave his
Washington luxury apartment. But the surveillance of Bloch
continues at a new, unspecified location, ABC News reported
Saturday.
   Bloch, who has not been charged with any crime, is the
highest-ranking U.S. diplomat ever identified as the target of an
intelligence investigation involving the Soviet Union.
   The government is keeping close tabs on Bloch so he won't flee
but ABC said that federal officials also are concerned that he
might try to hurt himself.
   Bloch was last seen by fellow residents of his apartment
building on Thursday. Since then, they say, a heavy contingent of
government agents, whose surveillance of Bloch had been obvious to
his neighbors for weeks, apparently has departed as well.
   The FBI declined comment Saturday about the status of its
investigation, which was brought to light the previous night by an
ABC News report which said he had been videotaped passing a
briefcase to a Soviet KGB agent in Vienna.
   That incident, according to sources who declined to be
identified, occurred early this year, more than a year after Bloch
was reassigned to a largely bureaucratic post in Washington.
   Government sources told ABC that, once confronted with
allegations of his spying, Bloch fell apart emotionally.
   The report said Bloch has been interrogated two times and
claimed he would cooperate. But one government analyst told the
television network that Bloch's cooperation has been ``extremely
limited.''
   A team of government psychologists, ABC said, does not believe
that Bloch spied for money.
   Sources told ABC that Bloch claimed he spied because he fell
into a Soviet sex trap but investigators have discounted that story.
   The Los Angeles Times, citing an anonymous U.S. government
official familiar with the case, reported Sunday that Bloch was
under suspicion of spying ``for a substantial period of time.''
   Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Moch was quoted by the Kurier
newspaper in Vienna as saying Bloch apparently came under suspicion
by U.S. authorities in the 1970s, the Times noted.
   The government has not charged Bloch, hoping that he will
voluntarily tell investigators the extent of the information he
provided to the East, ABC said.
   In New York City, former Ambassador Ronald S. Lauder, a
candidate for the Republican nomination for mayor, said Saturday
that he demanded in 1987 that Bloch be recalled to Washington
because ``He went outside of channels ... he went around me'' in
dealings with the Austrian Foreign Ministry.
   Lauder said, however, that he had no indication that Bloch, an
Austrian native, had been dealing with the Soviets.
   Lauder, a political appointee as ambassador who himself has been
criticized for his service in Vienna, said he inherited Bloch as
his top deputy when he arrived at the embassy in April 1986.
   Bloch had been there for six years already, and was in charge of
the embassy during a lapse between the departure of Helene Von Damm
and Lauder's confirmation, Lauder said. A congressional source,
meanwhile, speculated that Bloch was the effective day-to-day chief
of the embassy throughout the time that Ms. Von Damm, also a
political appointee and widely criticized as a social butterfly,
was there.
   Lauder said he grew increasingly dissatisfied with Bloch over
``insubordination'' and demanded that he be recalled in July 1987.
The State Department complied within a matter of ``days or weeks,''
he said.
   Lauder said he knew nothing of the current investigation before
hearing news reports Friday. He said he has since spoken with the
State Department about the case, but declined elaboration.
   ``I thought he was a poor member of the staff. So I got rid of
him. If I thought he was a spy, I would have had him arrested,''
Lauder said.
   Lauder said Bloch did have access to ``a great deal'' of
classified information, and that he ``could do severe damage.'' But
``At this point we do not know'' whether that has occurred.
   ``It could have potential impact, a great deal of impact on the
United States,'' Lauder continued. ``He had a great deal of
access.''

   An American Airlines jetliner was buffeted by
turbulence Saturday night near Miami and at least 35 people were
taken to hospitals after the aircraft landed, a spokesman for the
carrier said.
   The A-300 airbus with 239 passengers and a crew of nine left San
Juan, Puerto Rico, and landed at about 11 p.m. at Miami
International Airport, said American Airlines spokesman John Hotard
in Fort Worth, Texas.
   ``On his descent into Miami, (the pilot) said he hit an area of
turbulence,'' Hotard said. ``It threw the aircraft up and then
down.''
   There was no immediate word on the extent of the injuries aboard
American Flight 1077. Medical personnel and equipment met the
plane, according to an airport official.
   Several passengers were taken from the aircraft in wheelchairs
and stretchers. A spokeswoman for Jackson Memorial Hospital said 20
people were transported there, but she did not know the extent or
type of any injuries.
   Passengers reported hitting the aircraft's ceiling, objects

baggage compartment.
   Carmen Pimentel, 48, of Bayamon, Puerto Rico, said the plane
bounced up and down three or four times. ``All of a sudden,
everyone was jumping and flying,'' she said. ``My son was hurt in
the head and the shoulder.''
   Hotard said the pilot was at 35,000 feet and his radar was
clear, showing no thunderstorm in the area, when the plane hit the
turbulence.

   The chief government censor was shot
and killed Sunday, police and witnesses said.
   Themis Guruge, who also headed the government-owned radio
station, was taking a walk near his home at Polhengoda, 4 miles
southeast of Colombo when he was shot by two unidentified gunmen
riding in a white car, police said on condition of anonymity.
   Guruge, 60, a well-known broadcaster, was named head of the
government's four-person censorship committee two weeks ago.
Censorship on local and foreign press reports was imposed amid
escalating ethnic violence and a growing dispute between India and
Sri Lanka over the presence of a 40,000-man Indian peacekeeping
force.
   Guruge, a Sinhalese, was appointed chairman of the Sri Lanka
Broadcasting Corp. two months ago. Radio employees have received
death threats from Sinhalese extremists in the past.
   Police gave no indication who may have been responsible for the
killing. No one immediately claimed responsibility.
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Guruge's
family rushed him to a hospital and their car was fired on by
police at a checkpoint. One relative was slightly wounded, the
witnesses said.
   Guruge was pronounced dead on arrival at Colombo General
Hospital.
   On Friday, Agriculture Minister Lalith Athulathmudali told
Parliament that censoring the press, both local and foreign, was
proving to be counter-productive.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne, who announced the censorship
July 6, said he agreed and promised to lift it soon, at least for
foreign media.
   In the past six years, about 15,000 people have died in Sri
Lanka's ethnic violence.
   About 11,000 have died in the Tamil separatist war in the
northeast, where Indian troops have been deployed since July 30,
1987 in an as yet unsuccessful effort to pacify Tamil guerrillas.
   About 4,000 people, mostly Sinhalese government officials and
supporters, have been killed by Sinhalese extremists who accuse the
Sinhalese-dominatd government of making too many concessions to the
Tamil minority.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese majority in
jobs, education and use of the Sinhala language.
   Sinhalese, who account for 75 percent of the population,
dominate the government and military.

   Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party conceded
defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday after projections
indicated it had lost its upper house majority for the first time
in more than three decades.
   ``This is a big defeat,'' the conservative party's secretary
general, Ryutaro Hashimoto, said in a televised interview. ``I am
very sorry.''
   A major loss for the Liberal Democrats would increase pressure
for a general election and for a change of leadership in the
scandal-plagued party.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. and Kyodo News Service said their
projections indicated the Liberal Democrats were certain to lose
their majority in the House of Councillors, the upper house of
Japan's two-chamber Parliament. Voters were deciding half of the
house's 252 seats in Sunday's balloting.
   Final official results were not expected until Monday evening.
   A heavy turnout by Japan's 90.3 eligible voters reflected strong
feelings over a new sales tax, an unpopular farm policy and stock
and sex scandals that have eroded the popularity of the governing
party, according to opinion polls.
   ``The situation is extremely severe,'' Hashimoto said in an
earlier interview Sunday. ``Though the final results are not in
yet, it appears our old pattern is not working.''
   Takako Doi, chairwoman of the main opposition Japan Socialist
Party, which was leading in the projections, told reporters: ``This
is the result of the people's choice.''
   By late Sunday night, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. projected the
results for 88 of the 126 seats being contested in the House of
Councillors.
   It said 25 would go to the Liberal Democrats, 34 to the leftist
Socialists, six to the centrist Clean Government Party, two each to
the Communists and the conservative Social Democrats, eight to
independents and 11 to minor parties.
   Kyodo News Service gave similar projections, and both the news
service and the Japan Broadcasting Corp. predicted that the Liberal
Democrats would not win the 54 seats they needed to maintain a
simple majority in the upper chamber.
   Although the Socialists were doing well in the projections, a
majority in the upper house will remain out of their reach because
they would need to win 84 seats and they ran only 54 candidates in
the election.
   The Liberal Democrats went into the election with 142 seats,
compared to 43 for the Socialists and 23 for the Clean Government
Party. A political party needs 127 seats for a simply majority in
the House of Councillors and 139 seats to control all 16 permanent
standing committees in the house.
   The Socialists have led efforts to create an opposition
coalition with the Clean Government Party, the Democratic
Socialists and the leftist Socialist Democratic Federation, which
now has no seats in the upper chamber.
   If the Liberal Democrats lose control of the upper house, they
will find it harder to pass legislation. But the party holds 293 of
the 512 seats in the more powerful lower house, where elections
need not be called until July 1990.
   The Liberal Democrats have produced all of Japan's prime
ministers since it was formed in 1955. But a poor showing by Prime
Minister Sousuke Uno's Liberal Democrats could increase pressure on
Uno, in office less than two months, to resign and lead to early
elections for the lower house of Parliament. A Liberal Democratic
loss there could bring Japan a Socialist-led government, since the
lower house elects the prime minister.
   The Liberal Democrats, who represent conservative interests in
Japan, have been hurt by a scandal centering around the Recruit
Co., a publishing conglomerate that was accused of doling out
millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and political donations
to obtain favors.
   Disclosures in the scandal led to the resignations of three
Cabinet ministers and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Shortly after he succeeded Takeshita June 2, reports began to
appear that Uno had kept paid geisha mistresses, igniting criticism
from women's groups.
   The geisha scandal forced Uno to keep a low profile during
campaigning, strengthening his image as a caretaker who will remain
in office only until Oct. 31, when Takeshita's term as party
president would have expired.
   Farmers, traditional supporters of Uno's party, also revolted
against its moves to open Japan's agricultural market wider to
imports.
   The Socialists rallied voters against a new 3 percent sales tax
that was heavily backed by the governing party.
   The Socialists, putting forward a record number of women
candidates, took advantage of housewives' anger over the tax, which
was bulldozed through Parliament by the governing party last year
despite an opposition boycott. The tax, part of a sweeping tax
reform, took effect April 1.

a non-passing zone. He crashed head-on into a truck driven by
Hiroshi Sakata, 61, who was heading west, police said.
   Airmen Ronald Lawrence, 20, and Steven Theis, 22, were injured
and taken to a nearby hospital, according to the police officer. He
said Sakata escaped injury.
   Theis was seriously injured and Lawrence was only slightly
injured, the police officer said.
   The hometowns of the Americans were not immediately available.

<HEAD>Tutu Says Government Leader Seeks to Divide ANC and Mandela</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu on
Sunday accused the head of the governing National Party of a
``crude attempt'' to create a split between the African National
Congress and its imprisoned leader, Nelson Mandela.
   Tutu, a black Anglican active in the anti-apartheid movement,
challenged an assertion by F.W. de Klerk that the burden was on the
ANC to renounce its guerrilla campaign against the white-led
government as a precondition to negotiations.
   De Klerk, expected to succeed P.W. Botha as president after
elections Sept. 6, said Saturday the ANC should ``follow the lead''
of Mandela by committing itself to a peaceful settlement. De Klerk
was referring to the meeting between Botha and Mandela earlier this
month in which the two leaders expressed support for ``peaceful
development'' in South Africa.
   ``De Klerk has his history wrong,'' Tutu said in a statement.
``Our liberation movements have sought change peacefully since
before 1910. It is his government which forced the ANC and PAC
(Pan-Africanist Congress) to turn to violence by banning them, and
it his his government which must un-ban them and create conditions
conducive to negotiations.''
   De Klerk's ``crude attempt to drive a wedge between Mr. Mandela
and the ANC is deplorable and indicates he is not serious about
negotiations,'' Tutu said.
   Mandela, in a brief statement following his meeting with Botha,
confirmed that he had endorsed ``peaceful development'' but
stressed that no peaceful solution could be found unless the
government negotiated with the ANC and its allies in South Africa.
   The ANC has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign in South
Africa since 1961, a year after it was outlawed. Mandela was jailed
in 1962. He is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the government.
   The ANC has rejected de Klerk's recent proposals for a five-year
plan to give the disenfranchised black majority a formal voice in
national politics without letting it impose its will on the white
minority.
   The National Party is the overwhelming favorite to retain
control in the white election Sept. 6, but a newspaper poll
published Sunday indicated that liberal and conservative opposition
parties could do well enough to deprive the Nationalists of an
outright majority in Parliament.
   The poll, commissioned by the nationally circulated Sunday
Times, said the National Party would win 78 seats in Parliament,
the far-right Conservative Party 52 and the anti-apartheid
Democratic Party 36 if the election were held this week and there
was an 80 percent turnout. Details about how the poll was conducted
were not published.
   A separate poll published Sunday in the Afrikaans-language
newspaper Rapport predicted the Nationalists would win about 46
percent of the vote, the Conservatives 25 percent and the
Democratic Party about 29 percent.

   Dissident Fang Lizhi is the guest who never comes
to dinner. He never appears at parties at the U.S. Embassy, where
he has lived since early June, but somehow he manages to haunt them.
   Guests inevitably peer down halls and around corners in hopes of
glimpsing the man whose invisible presence has helped bring
U.S.-Chinese relations to their lowest level since normalization in
1979.
   But even some high-level embassy staff say they have never seen
the short, plump astrophysicist or his wife, physics professor Li
Shuxian, who is in hiding with him.
   The State Department disclosed June 6 that the couple, outspoken
critics of China's Communist rulers, had taken shelter in the
embassy after the army moved in on pro-democracy protesters in
Beijing.
   The Chinese government issued arrest warrants for the pair,
accusing them of orchestrating the protests.
   Embassy officials refuse to say even which of the three walled
embassy compounds houses the Fangs.
   They may live in comfort in a guest room at Ambassador James
Lilleys' home. Then again, perhaps they are hidden from Chinese
staff in more secure, but less homey, quarters. Do they use the
embassy pool at night when everyone has gone home? Do they watch
Cable News Network television, now banned elsewhere in Beijing, off
the embassy's satellite dish? Embassy staff only shrug.
   Most change the subject or walk away when someone mentions
Fang's name.
   But now and then someone makes a joke, as when Counselor
McKinney Russell turned to a guest at the embassy's Independence
Day picnic and asked if he had met Professor Fang. The guest took
the bait and asked eagerly to be introduced. Fang, of course, did
not attend.
   Fang probably would have enjoyed the picnic and the joke. A
friendly man with a puckish sense of humor, he often laughs
heartily during conversation.
   But his calls for the all-powerful Communist Party to allow
political debate and even formation of new parties are serious.
   ``Some people think China doesn't need democracy, but I think
human rights are basic. For them to be realized, first of all
famous people must take a stand,'' he said in February, during a
relative thaw that preceded the April start of the student movement.
   Fang gained fame internationally as China's most articulate
human rights spokesman, but his initial renown at home came as
China's first physicist to specialize in black hole theory.
   He became a hero to many intellectuals in 1987, when the
Communist Party ousted him for making pro-democracy speeches it
said helped incite student marches. The party distributed copies of
the speeches to be criticized during political study sessions, but
many readers secretly found themselves in agreement.
   Fang was not a frequent visitor at the U.S. Embassy. However,
one embassy invitation caused an international stir _ to a banquet
given by visiting President Bush in February. Chinese police
stopped Fang en route and refused to let him attend.
   The Chinese government lodged a formal protest with the U.S.
Embassy over that invitation, and again when it gave shelter to
Fang and Li.
   But China mostly vented its ire in newspaper commentaries that
branded Fang a traitor and the ``scum of the nation,'' and accused
Li of not having ``a real Chinese heart.''
   Newspapers accused the U.S. Embassy of violating international
law by sheltering the couple. The embassy was deluged with phone
calls from Chinese expressing their indignation.
   An ambassador who lives near the main U.S. Embassy compound
reportedly complained to the Foreign Ministry that Chinese were
standing outside shouting epithets at Fang in the middle of the
night.
   Chinese police who normally guard foreign embassies have
multiplied outside the U.S. facilities since Fang and Li took up
residence, and the officers now carry automatic pistols.
   Half a dozen uniformed and plainclothes police camp around the
clock outside Lilley's residence. They sit on low stools, drinking
tea and playing cards, and hang laundry from a small guard booth,
giving it the look of a squatter camp.
   U.S. security also has tightened. The compound where the
ambassador lives used to leave its gates open. Now they are locked
and even Americans must show their passports to enter.
   The Fangs' options are limited. They can leave the embassy and
face arrest, or stay inside as virtual prisoners. The United States
has said it would like to reach a compromise with China that would
allow the couple to leave for a third country, but China insists
they are criminals who must be prosecuted.
   Neither side will say if talks are going on.
   Meanwhile, one scientific research society has expelled Fang,
and a city district people's congress to which Li was elected in
1987 is discussing expelling her.
   Staff who answered the telephone at the Beijing Observatory,
where Fang works, said his name remains on the list of employees.
It is unlikely he will return to work there, however, as long as
the current government is in power.
   ``I am like a soldier who has already crossed the river. There's
no way to turn back,'' Fang said in an interview last year. Never
has that been truer.

   Britain is concerned about the whereabouts of the
British husband of Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the
Foreign Office said Sunday.
   Michael Aris left Britain on Friday and when he arrived in Burma
on Saturday, he was not permitted to see a British diplomat waiting
for him at the airport, the Foreign Office said.
   A spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said it was possible that Aris, an Oxford University
professor and an expert on Tibet, was under house arrest along with
his wife.
   ``The charge d'affaires from our embassy went to meet him at the
airport (but) he didn't come through the normal channels,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``Our charge d'affaires then asked if he could see him and was
not allowed to. The next step will be for us to take this up with
the Burmese authorities.''
   Burma's government announced Friday that Ms. Suu Kyi, Burma's
top opposition leader, was placed under house arrest Thursday at
her family's home in a suburb of Rangoon. It accused her of trying
to ``revive anarchy'' in the country.
   Ms. Suu Kyi is the most vocal critic of Gen. Saw Maung's
military government, which seized power in a coup in September and
imposed martial law. She is the daughter of Aung San, an
independence leader assassinated in 1947.
   She was thrust into the political arena after returning to
Rangoon from her home in England in April 1988 to care for her
ailing mother. She spoke before hundreds of thousands of people
during nationwide pro-democracy protests last year. The military
crushed the protests in September and banned demonstrations.

   Italy's 49th postwar government was sworn in Sunday
after Giulio Andreotti formed a five-party coalition and ended a
65-day political crisis brought on by the resignation of Premier
Ciriaco De Mita.
   The coalition formed Saturday is comprised of the same centrist
parties that have ruled together for most of the 1980s, and no
major changes in policy were foreseen.
   The coalition parties have a comfortable majority in Parliament
and the government was expected to easily win a vote of confidence
this week.
   The Senate is expected to hold its debate on the new government
on Wednesday or Thursday, while the Chamber of Deputies, the lower
house, is scheduled to vote on the new government at week's end.
   On Sunday morning, President Francesco Cossiga swore in
Andreotti to his sixth term as premier. Afterward, other Cabinet
members took the oath in front of Cossiga and Andreotti.
   After the swearing-in, the 70-year-old premier met with the
other 31 members of the Cabinet.
   Andreotti told reporters his government is like a child: ``It's
small at birth but can grow strong and robust.''
   The new premier has said he will concentrate on preparing Italy
for 1992, when the European Community drops its internal barriers
to trade and becomes a single market.
   Other priorities include fighting crime, tax evasion and
pollution, he said.
   The new government is expected to maintain Italy's close ties
with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United States.
   Many of the key posts in the new government changed hands, but a
majority of the new officials had been ministers before.
   Andreotti was premier twice in 1972-73 and three times
successively in 1976-79. He has served in more than a dozen other
ministerial posts and has been dubbed ``minister for life.''
   He said he celebrated the creation of his new government by
watching an old Audrey Hepburn film on television Saturday night.

<HEAD>Opposition Resigns from Parliament to Protest Gun Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All 106 opposition members in the lower
house of Parliament resigned Sunday to protest Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's refusal to step down over a controversial foreign arms
deal.
   The decision by the 12 opposition parties in the Lok Sabha, the
lawmaking branch of Parliament, was sparked by an auditor's report
citing inconsistencies in the 1986 purchase of $1.4 billion in
Swedish artillery guns.
   Opposition members and news reports allege officials received
millions of dollars in kickbacks in return for securing the
contract for the Swedish company.
   The move was not expected to have much effect on Parliament
since Gandhi's Congress Party commands a majority, but opposition
leaders said they hoped it would call attention to the arms deal
and make it a major issue in the next election, due by January.
   ``Never before has the office of the prime minister been brought
into disrepute as under the present incumbent,'' said V.P. Singh,
leader of the Janata Dal (People's Party). ``We were all elected by
the people, and now we are going back to them for their verdict on
this issue.''
   Government officials contend the deal was sanctioned by Singh,
who at that time served as finance minister in Gandhi's Cabinet.
Singh left the governing party in 1987.
   The 12 opposition parties controlled 106 seats in the 544-member
Lok Sabha. Besides the Janata Dal, they include the Bharatiya
Janata Party (Indian People's Party), the Telugu Desam (Party of
the Telugus), the two major Communist parties and other regional
groups.
   The rest of the seats are controlled by Gandhi's Congress Party
and independents.
   After the auditor's report was released Tuesday, opposition
members in Parliament shouted anti-government slogans, called
Gandhi a thief and demanded his resignation. When he refused, they
walked out and stalled proceedings for three days.
   The report said the arms purchase was flawed on technical
considerations and cost assessment.
   The arms purchase has been a major scandal for Gandhi's
government because of allegations the Swedish firm AB Bofors paid
kickbacks to secure the contract.
   Newspapers and opposition politicians say kickbacks amounting to
at least $50 million were paid to senior government officials and
to Congress Party coffers. The allegations have never been proved.
   Opposition leaders have previously demanded Gandhi's resignation
on the issue, but the 44-year-old prime minister has repeatedly
said he was not involved in any wrongdoing.
   A parliamentary committee that investigated the deal last year
said there was no evidence kickbacks or commissions were paid to
secure the sale.
   Opposition parties have been using the Bofors issue to try to
merge and mount a viable challenge to Gandhi and the Congress Party
in the general election. Their efforts have stalled in squabbling
and widely publicized power struggles for nearly a year.
   But N.T. Rama Rao, leader of the Telugu Desam, said the decision
to resign from Parliament proved the opposition could unite on
major issues.
   ``We are committed to give a clean government to the country,''
he said.

   A tidal wave roared through the Bay of
Bengal on Sunday, inundating islands off the coast and killing at
least 12 people, authorities said. At least 51 people were missing.
   Officials at the Cyclone Preparedness Center in Dhaka said a
6-foot wall of water pounded scores of islands up to 200 miles
offshore.
   The dead included nine fishermen, officials said. Most of the 51
missing were fishermen.
   The island of Sandwip was hit hardest by the wave, which washed
away hundreds of mud and straw huts and left an estimated 2,000
people homeless, officials said.

<HEAD>AIDS Cases In United States Pass 100,000 Mark</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 100,000 people in the United States
now have AIDS.
   Some time in recent weeks _ nobody knows just when _ the report
for the 100,000th recorded case of AIDS in the United States became
part of the data files at Centers for Disease Control.
   That case report joined hundreds of others flowing into CDC
computers, where it was combined with thousands of earlier reports
to eventually become part of the cumulative number of U.S. AIDS
cases.
   When the monthly total for July is compiled and released in late
August, CDC experts are sure that America's official count of total
AIDS cases will, for the first time, officially pass 100,000.
   ``Due to the backlog of reporting, plus the fact that we're
retroactively going back and adding cases by the dozens, we
probably reached 100,000 already,'' said Charles Fallis, a CDC
spokesman.
   But Fallis, who declined to arrange interviews with CDC
epidemiology experts, said: ``There's really no way to tell which
case is the 100,000th case.''
   Many experts, including some at CDC, have admitted that the AIDS
case total is more of a rough estimate than a precise count.
   But what the official total does emphasize is that there has
been no retreat or slowing in the dreadful statistical march of
AIDS. The nightmare is following a script of disease, illness and
death that CDC epidemiology experts predicted in May 1988.
   By 1992, the federal agency expects there will be a cumulative
total of 365,000 confirmed cases of AIDS. The agency also predicts
that within three years the total number of U.S. residents killed
by AIDS will reach 263,000 _ a total almost five times higher than
the total number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War.
   But that's only part of the picture.
   In order to be counted in the official CDC survey, a patient
must have a positive blood test for AIDS, plus other symptoms, such
as opportunistic infections, persistent loss of weight or
chronically enlarged lymph nodes.
   Beyond these counted patients, the CDC estimates that there are
1 million to 1.5 million Americans who are infected with the AIDS
virus but have not yet developed symptoms. These people are said to
be seropositive. They can spread the disease, but are themselves
not yet suffering its deadly effects.
   ``Fifty to sixty percent of people who are seropositive will
develop at least some symptoms of AIDS within five years,'' said
Fallis.
   Federal estimates of the cost of AIDS are staggering.
   ``Projections indicated that a total of 172,000 AIDS patients
will require medical care in 1992 at a cost expected to range from
$5 billion to $13 billion,'' the CDC reported in May. The agency
said these figures ``are underestimates of the true magnitude'' of
the medical costs of the AIDS virus because many clinical
treatments for the disease are not reported.
   Patterns of AIDS infection are slowly changing.
   Whereas once AIDS was almost exclusively a disease of
homosexuals, the rate of discovered cases in that population group
is slowing down. In the 12 months ending June 30, homosexual and
bisexual males represented 57 percent of the U.S. AIDS cases. This
is a 2 percent drop from the previous 12 months.
   Fallis said experts believe this is because of changes in life
style practices and because the population group is becoming
``saturated'' _ the number of uninfected members of this group is
becoming too small to maintain the previous rate of new cases.
   For intravenous drug users, however, the infection rate is
rising. For the 12 months ending June 30, 23 percent of the total
AIDS cases were among male and female IV drug users. This is an
increase of two percent from the previous 12 months.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that destroys immune cells and
renders the body unable to resist disease. It is caused by the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which is spread most often
through sexual intercourse with infected persons or through needles
shared by intravenous drug users. Infection can also come from
contaminated blood transfusions, which is rare, and babies can
become infected from their mothers.''

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Struggling to Win Public Confidence in Nuclear Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As his struggle to rebuild the nation's
nuclear arms industry grows more urgent, Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins may be losing a grip on his most important tool: public
belief that the weapons plants can be made safe.
   Since he took office last March, Watkins and a team of senior
department aides have been racing against time to fix decades of
neglect in the weapons program before reactor breakdowns and other
problems seriously undermine U.S. defense strategy.
   From the start, Watkins believed the key to success was
convincing the public _ including workers at the plants and nearby
residents _ that an era of nuclear secrecy was ended, that their
government could be trusted to run the plants safely.
   To his dismay, the cloud of mystery and distrust has only grown
darker.
   No significant accidents have been reported at any of the 17
major weapons facilities in 12 states since Watkins took over, but
some have been forced to close temporarily and a series of recent
incidents has raised new health and safety questions.
   In just the past week, for example:
   _ The Energy Department's own auditors issued a blistering
review of management failures and predicted that unless urgent
action is taken to correct the flaws Watkins will face more
pressure to close the plants. It also said department employees may
face criminal charges for violating environmental laws.
   _ The FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency dispatched
agents to one of the weapons plants in Ohio to investigate
allegations of criminal violations of laws governing the handling,
storage and disposal of hazardous wastes.
   _ The FBI disclosed that it is investigating allegations of
financial fraud at the same Ohio plant, known as the Feed Materials
Production Center, near Cincinnati.
   _ The EPA added seven major weapons facilities _ in New York,
California, Ohio, Tennessee, South Carolina and Idaho _ to its list
of the most polluted sites in the nation.
   _ Members of Congress proposed legislation that would take away
from Watkins some responsibilities related to the weapons program,
including one measure that would transfer to the Department of
Health and Human Services the authority to study and monitor the
health effects of radiation on workers at the weapons plants and
another that would empower an independent board to shut down any or
all of the weapons plants on safety grounds.
   _ More environmental groups called on Watkins to withdraw his
choice of Victor Stello, the controversial operations chief of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to take over day-to-day
administration of the nuclear weapons program.
   Although the Stello nomination has gained little public notice
outside Washington, the basis of the opposition runs to the heart
of Watkins' underlying dilemma.
   ``Secretary Watkins has been conducting a public relations
effort to convince the public that he is serious about
environmental and safety problems at these facilities, but actions
like the nomination of Victor Stello just don't support his
words,'' said Brian Costner, director of the Energy Research
Foundation, a citizen group pushing for closure of the Savannah
River weapons plant in South Carolina.
   Stello's critics contend he is not sensitive enough to health
and safety issues.
   Watkins' struggle to erase the impression that environmental and
safety problems at the weapons plants are out of control is
complicated by the pressure he faces to fashion a strategy for
resuming nuclear materials production at Savannah River and getting
his waste management program off dead center.
   Public announcements of new waste control measures, nuclear
production schedules and a blueprint for reshaping the entire
weapons complex are expected sometime in August.
   The timing and success of Watkins' grand design is crucial.
   The Pentagon says it may have to cannibalize some warheads
unless the Savannah River nuclear reactors resume production of
tritium soon. Watkins, though, sees risk in overhauling too quickly
a program the General Accounting Office has called ``one of the
more potentially dangerous industrial operations in the world.''
   Now, with some solutions apparently in sight, Watkins is being
forced to fight rear-guard skirmishes with the FBI and the EPA,
whose surprise raids this summer on the Rocky Flats plutonium
processing plant in Colorado and the Feed Materials uranium plant
in Ohio have undercut Watkins' efforts to sooth public safety
concerns.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, and other senior
department officials have expressed dismay at the unwillingness of
the FBI and the EPA to coordinate their investigations with Watkins.
   ``What we don't need is this alarming people'' about health and
safety risks by springing surprise raids that create the impression
that the FBI thinks the Energy Department can't be trusted to
monitor its own facilities, Moore said.

   Just three years after he won the Illinois
lottery jackpot, Charles Brownlee is headed back to prison as a
destitute and remorseful man. His lawyer says the cash windfall
ruined his client's life.
   ``This is a Horatio Alger story in reverse _ a rags to riches to
rags again,'' attorney Craig M. Kuhary said last week before his
client was sentenced to three years in prison for writing bad
checks.
   In 1986, Brownlee appeared ready to shed his past criminal
record and drug abuse problem and take on a new life. He applied
for a job and pocketed $380,565 in the Illinois lottery.
   But $80,000 in charity donations, some bad investments and a
return to drugs and crime has left the 38-year-old Kenosha man
virtually penniless and headed back to the familiar surroundings of
a state prison.
   ``I accept full responsibility for my unacceptable behavior. I
owe society a debt,'' Brownlee told Circuit Judge Roger P. Murphy
before he was sentenced Friday to three years in prison and four
years of probation.
   Brownlee was convicted in March on four felony counts and
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge Friday.
   Brownlee donated about $80,000 of his winnings to charity,
according to court records, but much of the rest was dissipated on
drugs, bad investments and unethical confidants.
   ``When somebody dumps $380,000 in your lap, you forget what
happened before that and start living in a fantasy world,'' his
lawyer said.

<TEXT>
   A higher education faculty shortage
anticipated for the mid-1990s has already arrived in fields from
computing to health, according to an annual survey of colleges and
universities issued Sunday.
   Half the institutions in the survey by the American Council on
Education said it is taking them longer now to find qualified
people for full-time faculty positions than it was previously.
   Half also said they are having greater difficulty getting top
applicants to accept positions when they are offered _ up from 25
percent who gave that response in 1987.
   Elaine El-Khawas, an ACE vice president and author of ``Campus
Trends, 1989,'' noted that some studies have projected shortages in
the next decade but said her research indicates a more immediate
problem.
   ``The labor market for faculty is tightening right now,'' she
said. ``The real dilemmas for colleges are going to be starting
much sooner than 1995.''
   El-Khawas said factors contributing to the problem include an
inadequate number of doctorate holders, an increasing number of
Ph.D.s going into private industry, a greater proportion of
doctoral degrees earned by foreigners, accelerating retirement of
faculty members, and expanding student enrollment.
   The sixth annual ACE survey of senior academic administrators at
366 institutions found that 40 percent are having trouble finding
qualified people for full-time positions in computer science. One
in three institutions reported similar problems in the business
area. Mathematics and health professions each were cited by one in
four schools.
   Half the administrators surveyed said they expect the pace of
retirement among full-time faculty to increase in the next few
years. At the same time, half said the size of their full-time
faculty had grown in the last year and 71 percent said they had
increased their overall enrollment.
   El-Khawas said the crunch may result in pressure for higher
salaries in certain fields, incentives to keep people from retiring
and a highly competitive situation where universities are trying to
entice faculty members away from each other.
   Class size may also be affected, she said. The 1989 survey
indicates there may be an impact in that area already. One-third of
colleges and universities reported an increase in average class
size, up from 20 percent in the 1988 survey.
   The physical condition of universities is also a pressing
concern, according to the survey. Only 32 percent of the
administrators felt their physical plant was excellent or very
good. Another third said plant renovation and renewal will be a key
challenge in the next five years and more than half predicted their
facilities will not be adequate to meet school needs over the next
decade.
   On another front, eight in 10 institutions reported at least
some activity to increase the enrollment and retention of minority
students. However, only 25 percent said their enrollment of blacks,
Hispanics and Asians had risen during 1988-89 and only 10 percent
reported an increase in American Indian students.
   ``It's encouraging that there's a tremendous level of
activity,'' El-Khawas said. ``But the actual results fall short.''
   The same proportion of institutions reported they were making
special efforts to increase minority faculty members. But only 17
percent offer incentives to academic departments to hire minorities
and only 25 percent reported a net gain in minority faculty over
the previous year.
   The ACE survey found continuing interest in assessments of
student learning, with 40 percent of the activity reportedly in
response to external mandates.
   Basic skills testing is in place at 65 percent of schools and an
additional 19 percent are planning such tests. Half of colleges and
universities now assess writing and 27 percent report that writing
assessment is in the planning stages. Close to half are planning to
assess students' critical thinking skills and 14 percent already do
so.
   About half the administrators responding to the survey said they
believe assessment will ``significantly improve'' undergraduate
education. But 37 percent said that so far, the process has
resulted mainly in new reporting requirements to the state.
   ACE is the umbrella group for the nation's colleges and
universities. Its campus trends survey, based on responses from 366
campuses, was adjusted statistically to be representative of the
country's 2,500 general institutions of higher education.
Seminaries, art schools, stand-alone graduate schools and other
specialized institutions were not included. The margin of error for
the survey was 2 percent.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Miners' Strikes Inspiring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Sunday he was
``inspired'' by striking coal miners and understood why they were
skeptical about a government offer to end their eight-day walkout.
   But Gorbachev told Soviet television he disagreed with the
tactics used by many of the nation's 1 million coal miners and said
their strike could threaten the national economy if it does not end.
   He appealed to miners and ``all the workers of the country'' to
endure the disruption caused by his reforms and help the nation
find ``the wide road of our society's renewal.''
   Gorbachev, seeking to show sympathy toward the strikers while
encouraging them to return to work, said he could understand why
miners in the Donetsk Coal Basin voted Saturday to turn down a
government offer that met most of their demands.
   The miners said they wanted assurances authorities would live up
to the offer.
   ``People, to some extent, have lost their trust,'' said
Gorbachev.
   By striking, he said, the miners acted ``very sharply,'' but
their actions showed ``workers are basically taking matters into
their own hands, and that, despite all the drama of these events,
makes me greatly inspired.''
   A strike leader in the Donetsk Basin, the nation's largest coal
center, said miners there would appeal to the Soviet legislature
for legal guarantees to back government promises aimed at ending
their walkout, which began July 15.
   Nikolai Balandin, a member of the Donetsk regional strike
committee, said a delegation of miners was scheduled to speak
Monday to the Supreme Soviet, the standing legislature.
   More than 5,000 strikers demonstrated Sunday on the central
square in the city of Donetsk, 900 miles south of Moscow, and
miners at each pit were deciding for themselves whether to resume
work, he said in a telephone interview.
   The region has 121 pits with an annual production of 210 million
tons. Tass reported Sunday that 74 of the mines remained on strike,
29 fewer than on Saturday. On Saturday, press reports said about
300,000 miners in Donetsk were on strike.
   The stoppage is the biggest of a wave of miners' strikes that
began July 11 in western Siberia and spread from the Arctic to
Central Asia.
   Miners reportedly remained on strike at 11 of the 13 mines in
Vorkuta in the Pechora Basin in the Arctic and at all 12 mines in
Chervonograd in the western Ukraine.
   The Donetsk regional strike committee reached a general
agreement with government negotiators Saturday, but most miners
there rejected it, saying they did not trust the government to
fulfill its promises of better working and living conditions.
   Balandin said the government commission ``guaranteed its
concessions, but that's a small guarantee, and people don't believe
in it.'' The Supreme Soviet could give the agreement ``the force of
law,'' he said.
   Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov assured strikers
in a telegram Saturday that their demands ``would be urgently
reviewed by the Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers, with
participation by representatives of the miners, to reach the
necessary decisions.''
   Gorbachev repeated those assurances in the interview Sunday with
a TV journalist. The interview was nationally broadcast.
   The coal strikes have caused dire difficulties for power and
steel industries, among others, Soviet press reports say.
   At the strike's peak, reports indicated half the coal industry's
1 million workers were on strike.
   Journalist Alexander E. Makarsky said in a telephone interview
from Donetsk that the strike settlement there included earlier
pension eligibility, pay increases and longer vacations, with extra
holidays for miners in especially difficult or dangerous conditions.
   Miners in two major coal centers, the Karaganda region of the
Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan and the Kuznetsk Coal Basin of
western Siberia, have gone back into the pits but say they will
strike again if the government reneges on its promises.
   The Siberian miners returned to work Thursday and Friday after
they were promised pay increases, more consumer goods and greater
control over their industry.

   Communist guerrillas on Sunday
renewed their offer to declare a truce if President Corazon Aquino
promises to close U.S. bases here by 1991.
   Satur Ocampo, who negotiated for the Communist-led National
Democratic Front in peace talks more than two years ago, also
claimed in a statement that Mrs. Aquino's government has committed
more human rights violations than Ferdinand Marcos' government.
   The statement was delivered to news agencies one day before the
opening of a session of Congress, at which Mrs. Aquino was to
deliver her State of the Nation address.
   The rebels first offered in April to observe a cease-fire if
Mrs. Aquino promised to close the bases, but she replied that the
Communists were not in a position to impose conditions.
   ``Although summarily rejected by the Aquino regime, determined
as it is to retain the bases, this offer remains a firm proposal of
the NDF before the nation,'' Ocampo said.
   The lease on six U.S. military installations in the Philippines
expires in 1991. The constitution bans all foreign bases in the
country after that year unless permitted by a treaty ratified by
two-thirds of the Senate, where opposition to the bases is strong.
   U.S. officials have been pushing for early talks on extension of
the bases' lease. In the rebel statement, Ocampo said Mrs. Aquino
``is set to go along'' with the American wishes.
   ``The NDF calls on all patriotic Filipinos to oppose and
frustrate, through all possible means, the criminal plan to retain
the imperialist military bases in the country,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A 161.4 percent jump in drug convictions paced
a 48.7 percent increase in defendants found guilty of federal
crimes between 1980 and 1987, the Justice Department said Sunday.
   Results of a study showed that by 1987 a larger proportion of
convicted defendants received prison terms from federal judges and
their sentences were on average 11 months longer than those imposed
in 1980, the department said.
   The number of criminal defendants convicted in federal courts
nationwide increased from 29,943 in 1980 to 44,518 percent in 1987,
according to a study prepared by the Justice Department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics.
   The conviction rate for defendants prosecuted in federal courts
increased from 76 percent in 1980 to 81 percent in 1987, the study
said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement that the
figures demonstrated the need for more money to build additional
prisons to house the increasing numbers of convicted defendants
sent behind bars by federal judges.
   President Bush has proposed spending $1.5 billion to add 24,000
beds to the overcrowded federal prison system.
   Federal judges sent 13,766 convicted defendants to prison in
1980 and ordered the imprisonment of 23,579 in 1987, the study said.
   The proportion of criminal defendants sentenced to prison
increased from 46 percent in 1980 to 53 percent in 1987 and the
average term of incarceration grew by 11 months between the two
years, the study said.
   During this period, the average sentence for federal crimes
increased from 44.3 months in 1980 to 55.2 months in 1987, the
study said.
   The number of defendants convicted of drug offenses increased
161.4 percent from 5,135 to 13,423, according to the study, which
was based on figures from U.S. attorneys' offices and the
Administrative Office of U.S. Courts.
   The average sentence for drug offenders was 21 months longer in
1987 than it was in 1980. The average sentence for non-drug crimes
was only two months longer in 1987 than in 1980.
   By far, the category of drug crimes showed the biggest increase
in the number of defendants convicted in U.S. district courts,
followed by a 55.1 percent increase in people convicted of fraud,
forgery and counterfeiting.
   Convictions for offenses such as tax fraud, racketeering,
extortion and weapons violations increased 21.9 percent during the
period.
   ``These figures indicate that the federal criminal justice
system has responded forcefully to the increase in crime,
especially in the area of drug trafficking,'' Thornburgh said.

   The bride and groom needed a police escort
to escape a wedding reception brawl that forced officers to call
for reinforcements and left 15 guests facing charges.
   Before the rice could be thrown, metal folding chairs flew and
the parking lot at the Elk's Lodge was littered with confetti and
paper streamers, beer cans, six high-heeled shoes, two pairs of
sunglasses, and the couple's ``Just Married'' sign.
   The police escort for the couple after the Saturday incident
included six cruisers with lights flashing and sirens wailing. The
15 guests were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, assault
and battery, malicious damage, resisting arrest and obstructing
police.
   The first police who responded radioed for more help. State and
municipal police from all over central Rhode Island began
converging on the city.
   Neighbors saw a disheveled young man run from the lodge as the
first officers arrived. Police caught up with him in a nearby
backyard and led him away in handcuffs, neighbors said.
   Police did not offer any explanation of what caused the fight or
how it got started. They also declined to name the bride and groom.
   ``One kid started it all,'' said a bartender who was washing
glasses once the hall was empty. ``One kid got 60 people going.''

   Americans favor legal abortion in their states
by a 2-1 margin, and nearly four in 10 say they are inclined to
oppose anti-abortion candidates for state office, a national poll
has found.
   With the battle over abortion increasingly focused on state
legislatures, voters critical of anti-abortion candidates
outnumbered their supporters by nearly 2-1 in the Media
General-Associated Press survey.
   Respondents also expressed continued support for the 1973 U.S.
Supreme Court ruling establishing a constitutional right to
abortion. Fifty-nine percent were in favor and 36 percent were
opposed, with 5 percent unsure.
   Support for the 1973 decision was slightly up from 53 percent in
an MG-AP survey in March. While the increase was within the poll's
margin of sampling error, similar movement in other questions
indicated a slight rise in pro-choice sentiment since the court
approved greater abortion restrictions on July 3.
   Sixty-three percent in the new poll said they would want
abortion to be legal in their state if the court overturned its
1973 ruling and let each state make its own abortion laws. That was
up from 57 percent in March.
   The survey, conducted by telephone July 7-16 among 1,163 adults,
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage
points.
   While majorities favored legal abortion generally, respondents
were split on many of the specific restrictions in the court's July
3 ruling. Among the findings:
   _Sixty-five percent said it should be legal for abortions to be
done at public hospitals, but that fell to 51 percent when
respondents were asked specifically about abortions that are not
required to save the mother's life. The Supreme Court said states
can ban such abortions from public hospitals.
   _Respondents split about evenly on whether it should be legal
for public health employees to perform or assist in abortions. The
court said that, too, can be barred by the states when the mother's
life is not at risk.
   _Respondents strongly supported mandatory pre-abortion tests to
see if fetuses that are at least 20 weeks old can survive outside
the womb, with 62 percent in favor. The high court said such tests
may be required.
   _By 54-38 percent, with 8 percent undecided, respondents said it
should be legal to use public funds to counsel women about the
availability of abortion. The court left that issue undecided.
   Overall, 48 percent of respondents said they opposed the July 3
ruling, 43 percent favored it and 9 percent were unsure. That was a
split in opinion, given the margin of error.
   Pro-choice activists have said they will work to defeat
anti-abortion state legislators. In the survey, 38 percent said
they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who was firmly
opposed to abortion, compared with 21 percent who would be more
likely to support such a candidate. An additional 38 percent said
it wouldn't matter much and 3 percent were unsure.
   At the same time, two-thirds of the respondents said they would
not base their vote just on a candidate's position on abortion.
   As in other polls, general questions on abortion produced
divided views, reflecting public discomfort with an issue that pits
the rights of pregnant women against concern for their fetuses.
   On one hand, 67 percent said a woman should be allowed to have
an abortion if she wants one and her doctor agrees to it, and just
25 percent said not, with 8 percent undecided. On the other hand, a
sizable 42 percent favored a constitutional amendment to ban most
abortions. Fifty-three percent opposed an amendment and the rest
were undecided.
   As in past surveys, younger, more educated and wealthier people
were more apt to support legal abortion, as were residents of the
Northeast and the West and big-city dwellers.
   People who called themselves conservatives were far more likely
to oppose abortion. Just 42 percent of conservatives supported the
court's 1973 ruling, compared with 66 percent of moderates and 80
percent of liberals.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews July 7-16 with 1,163 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult in the household who had
the most recent birthday, a random variable.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that 19
of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups; it is five points for people who
called themselves conservatives, for example.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to
it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not? Yes: 67
percent. No: 25 percent. Don't know or no answer: 8 percent.
   2. Would you vote for or against a candidate just on the basis
of that candidate's position on the abortion issue? Yes: 32. No:
61. DK-NA: 7.
   3. If a candidate for your state legislature is firmly opposed
to abortion, would that make you more likely to vote for that
candidate, or less likely, or wouldn't it matter much? More: 21.
Less: 38. Wouldn't matter: 38. DK-NA: 3.
   4a. Should it be legal or illegal for abortions to be done at
public hospitals? Legal: 65. Illegal: 26. DK-NA: 9.
   b. (If legal) Does that include abortions that are not necessary
to save the mother's life? Yes: 78. No: 18. DK-NA: 4.
   5a. Should it be legal or illegal or public health employees to
perform or assist in abortions? Legal: 44. Illegal: 43. DK-NA: 13.
   b. (If legal) Does that include abortions that are not necessary
to save the mother's life? Yes: 90. No: 9. DK-NA: 2.
   6. Should it be legal or illegal to use public funds to counsel
women about the availability of abortion? Legal: 54. Illegal: 38.
DK-NA: 8.
   7. If a woman who is at least 20 weeks pregnant wants an
abortion, should the doctor first be required to determine whether
the fetus can survive outside the womb, or not? Yes: 62. No: 21.
DK-NA: 17.
   8a. The U.S. Supreme Court this month gave the states more power
to restrict abortions. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor:
43. Oppose 48. DK-NA: 9.
   b. (If oppose) Is that because you wanted the court to do more
to restrict abortions, or because you think the court did too much
to restrict abortions? Wanted more: 8. Too much: 86. DK-NA: 7.
   9. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that a woman can have an
abortion if she wants one at any time during the first three months
of pregnancy. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor: 59.
Oppose: 36. DK-NA: 5.
   10. If the Supreme Court reversed its 1973 ruling and let each
state make its own abortion laws, abortion could become legal in
some states and illegal in others. Would you want abortion to be
legal or illegal in your state? Legal: 63. Illegal: 31. DK-NA: 7.
   11. If abortion was illegal in your state, do you think that
would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or
would most of them go to another state where it was legal? Stop: 7.
Go: 87. DK-NA: 6.
   12. Would you favor or oppose a constitutional amendment that
would make abortions illegal nationwide, except in cases of rape,
incest or to save the life of the mother? Favor: 42. Oppose: 53.
DK-NA: 6.

<HEAD>American Greg LeMond Wins Tour de France Bicycle Race for Second
Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greg LeMond, the only American to win the Tour de
France, repeated the feat Sunday by the closest margin ever,
capping a comeback from a 1987 gunshot wound that many thought had
ended his cycling career.
   LeMond, 26, of Minneapolis edged Laurent Fignon of France by
eight seconds in the most suspenseful running of the world's
premier cycling event.
   The Tour de France, which began July 1 with nearly 200 riders,
is a 2,020-mile race run in stages over mountains and valleys
looping through France, Belgium and Luxembourg.
   LeMond had started the day 50 seconds behind Fignon, which many
cycling experts believed an insurmountable deficit. Fignon, who has
won the race twice, and LeMond had traded the lead repeatedly the
past 17 days. The American won the final stage, a 15-mile time
trial from Versailles to Paris, in 26 minutes, 57 seconds.
   It was the first time LeMond had raced in the Tour de France
since he won the event in 1986. He was shot in the chest in a 1987
hunting accident, and shin surgery and an emergency appendectomy
forced him to miss the 1988 race. Many thought he would never
compete seriously again.
   The previous closest finish in the 76-year-old race was 38
seconds, when Jan Janssen of the Netherlands beat Herman Van
Springel of Belgium in 1968.
   LeMond receives a $220,000 first prize.

   Felix Lopez takes a break from
sawing beams out of a laurel log to sit in the shade of a mango
tree and tell how life has improved since his cooperative farm was
expropriated from a landowner nine years ago.
   Orlando de Sola sits in an overstuffed leather chair in a
gleaming white mansion and laments that his land and hundreds of
other big spreads were taken away and given to ``freeloaders.''
   The two men exemplify a dilemma facing the month-old rightist
government of President Alfredo Cristiani: how to deal with a land
reform program that is anathema to the right but is too deeply
rooted to abolish.
   Since 1980, the reform program has redistributed nearly 30
percent of this Massachusetts-sized country's arable acreage. About
120,000 peasant families have taken part in the program, which was
designed by U.S. academics and pushed by U.S. policymakers as
necessary to erode support for leftist revolution.
   In all, 469 big farms were expropriated, with compensation that
many landlords say was insufficient. The farms were organized into
320 cooperatives, of which about 50 have failed for economic
reasons or because they were in war zones.
   Agriculture Minister Antonio Cabrales says only 10 percent of
the remaining co-ops are profitable. Critics of the reform program
say the co-ops have reduced production and that peasants not
accustomed to managing large enterprises have been unable to run
the farms.
   Although the reform's economic outcome is uncertain, it has been
a political asset for the U.S.-backed government in its 10-year-old
civil war with Marxist-led insurgents.
   Peasant organizations, the centrist Christian Democrats and
leftists now contend Cristiani's Republican Nationalist Alliance,
or Arena, plans to undo land reform without appearing to do so.
   Cristiani and Cabrales reject the accusations and say the intent
is ``to reform the reform'' _ to improve production by letting
peasant farmers themselves decide how they want to work the land.
   While Felix Lopez is fighting to retain his land, De Sola says
the government is not moving quickly enough to dismantle the
reform. He says Cristiani is being ``a sissy.''
   Twenty-one former landowners are trying to get their land back
through the overwhelmingly conservative courts. All five cases
decided so far have gone against the peasants. Lopez's cooperative
is one of those five.
   ``We made her tons of money,'' Lopez said of Victoria Amada Sol,
former owner of Hacienda Nueva.
   ``Now we're doing quite well,'' he said, enumerating the
improvements since the farm was converted into a cooperative in
1980.
   ``I have worked this land for 40 years. Under `la patrona' (the
former owner) we broke our backs for 20 cents a day. That was
enough for us to eat. But clothes, or shoes _ forget it.''
   Lopez, 68, exhibited his calloused hands as he spoke. He
explained that though he now could buy shoes, he never got used to
the idea, and his leathery splayed feet remain bare.
   Each of the adobe brick and thatch- or tin-roofed houses of the
farm's 600 families has a large concrete basin with running water.
All have electricity. The cooperative has a school with two
teachers and pays a doctor at a clinic in Lourdes, 12 miles west of
San Salvador.
   The farm is made up of rolling coffee-covered hills and rippling
flat streches of corn and sugar cane.
   In the summer rainy season, it displays every shade of green
from lime to dark ivy.
   It is beautiful and bountiful, and Mrs. Sol wants it back. She
took her case to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the land had
been unlawfully expropriated.
   The conservative court likewise ruled in favor of four other
plaintiffs who argued that their holdings had not exceeded the
1,235-acre limit established by the reform.
   Mrs. Sol's lawyers said they could not comment on the ongoing
case. Mrs. Sol, who lives in Miami, did not return a phone call
seeking comment.
   Despite the court decisions, the Arena government seems
unwilling to pay the political cost of forced evictions.
   The court has issued an eviction order only in the case of
Hacienda Nueva. It was effective June 23, but the government has
taken no action.
   Cristiani and Cabrales, the agriculture minister, have said
force will not be used. Authorities are trying to negotiate a
solution, which may mean higher government compensation for Mrs.
Sol or a swap that would set up the cooperative on new land.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Thousands Flee Escalating Fighting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Beirut residents
have fled escalating shelling between Syrian and Christian gunners,
and police said duels Sunday left six people dead and at least 20
wounded.
   ``If I stay I'll go crazy,'' said 23-year-old Radwa Succar, a
Moslem beautician who joined the exodus to south Lebanon. ``If we
don't get killed from bombardment, we'll definitely die from fear
and depression.''
   By police count, at least 250,000 Moslem and Christian residents
since Friday had taken advantage of brief lulls in the fighting to
pack and flee.
   Tens of thousands of others from Beirut and nearby towns huddled
in basements and bomb shelters for the third straight day, with no
electricity and little water.
   ``This is a life of animals. Living in bomb shelters is not a
joyful thing at all,'' said Chafika Maalouf, a 63-year-old
Christian homemaker, as she left suburban Zalka with her husband,
son and daughter-in-law. ``I simply can't take it anymore.''
   Beirut was a ghost town, bereft of Sunday strollers and most
traffic. The few open sidewalk cafes were nearly empty.
   Gunners hit a fuel tanker north of the city, setting it on fire,
and Syrian tanks blasted a Christian army position they surrounded
in hills outside Beirut.
   Police said Christian forces fired mortars at Druse towns in the
central mountains to try to ease the pressure on their garrison at
the strategic hilltop town of Souk el-Gharb, 15 miles southeast of
Beirut.
   Syrian and Christian forces also traded machine-gun fire across
Beirut's Green Line, forcing the closure of the only public
crossing between the Moslem and Christian sectors.
   One Syrian tank shell hit the house of a Christian family in
Beirut's eastern suburb of Hadath, killing a 7-year-old girl, her
10-year-old brother and her grandfather, a police spokesman said.
   The children's parents and another brother were in intensive
care in a Christian hospital, said the spokesman, who cannot be
named under standing regulations.
   Among other wounded were two soldiers of Gen. Michel Aoun's
mainly Christian force and four Druse militiamen, the spokesman
said.
   The new casualities raised the overall toll to 446 killed and
1,856 wounded since the latest round of fighting in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war erupted March 8, pitting Aoun's 20,000 troops
against the Syrian army and the Druse militia.
   Police said the fighting eased around midday only to pick up
more violently in the afternoon.
   Police identified the stricken vessel as the Greek-registered
Peter Argo and said it was carrying 2,000 tons of gasoline to the
besieged Christian region when it was hit by shellfire six miles
offshore.
   The ship sailed toward open seas after the bombardment, but
police said it was intercepted by a Syrian gunboat and escorted to
the Syrian-controlled port of Tripoli in north Lebanon.
   No casualties were reported. It was the sixth vessel to be
struck by Syrian shellfire.
   The Syrians, who consider control of Lebanon vital to their
security, maintain 40,000 troops in 75 percent of Lebanon under a
1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   Aoun charges the Syrians have destroyed that mandate by openly
fighting on the Moslem side. He has pledged to drive them from
Syria.

<HEAD>Plan Would Offer Health Care for All, Set National Spending Cap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the House Select Committee on
Aging on Sunday proposed an overhaul of the government's health
care system that would offer coverage to all Americans and cap
overall spending for medical care.
   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., said he would introduce
legislation Monday to provide medical coverage to the 37 million
Americans who now are uninsured and to improve benefits for the 200
million people, or 85 percent of Americans, who are underinsured
against catastrophic long-term illness.
   In addition, the legislation for the first time would set a cap
on the nation's total spending for health care, limiting
expenditures to 12 percent of the gross national product, the
broadest measure of U.S. economic activity.
   Roybal's plan is among many that have been proposed to establish
a comprehensive health care program for the nation that would
better protect uninsured and underinsured Americans.
   From 1980 through 1987, health care costs rose at an average
rate of 10.4 percent, or 3.3 percent faster than the GNP. Under the
current system, these costs are expected to reach 13 percent of GNP
by 1995 and nearly 15 percent by the year 2000.
   ``We are facing a serious crisis in our nation's health care
system because of incomplete access to care, and increasing costs
of care,'' Roybal said. ``Soaring health care costs in the current
system threaten the American people's ability to pay for
desperately needed health care.''
   Under the proposed legislation, payments by beneficiaries would
be limited to: 20 percent of health care, skilled nursing home and
home health costs, up to a maximum of $600 a person per year; and
25 percent of long-term care costs, up to a maximum of $1,000 per
person a year.
   Both maximums would rise in tandem with per capita growth in the
GNP.
   The expanded benefits would be paid for by extending the
Medicare payroll tax to all income, an employer tax based on
compensation, an expanded cigarette tax, state revenues covering
half the costs for the poor, a surcharge on corporate and
individual income taxes and a premium paid by the elderly
approximating the current Medicare premium.
   The legislation, which would modify the existing Medicare
program and take full effect in 1994, would establish a
cost-containment program that includes fixed fee schedules for
health care providers and limiting future increases to the rise in
the per capita GNP.

   When the ruling council of the nation's largest
Indian tribe voted Chairman Peter MacDonald out of office amid
corruption allegations more than five months ago, it set off a
dispute that exploded in violence last week.
   An estimated 300 club-wielding MacDonald supporters clashed with
Navajo tribal police Thursday in Window Rock, the 200,000-member
tribe's capital.
   Two people were killed and nine wounded in the violence, the
latest episode in the struggle for power on the 125,000 square-mile
Navajo Reservation, which extends over parts of Arizona, New Mexico
and Utah.
   The tribal capital was quiet Sunday as many of the council
members and protesters left for the weekend because their homes are
several hours from Window Rock, officials said.
   On Saturday, interim Navajo Tribal Attorney General Herb Yazzie
called for the federal government to indict MacDonald on corruption
charges and for the tribal prosecutor's office to charge MacDonald
with violating tribal law.
   Those killed in Thursday's violence were members of the
Pro-Dineh Voters organization, which exists to return MacDonald to
power. Three police officers were among the nine wounded.
   The tribal Department of Public Safety was a MacDonald ally for
most of the three months during which he fought efforts of the new
administration to evict him from the tribe's administration
building.
   That changed near the end of April, as Interim Chairman Leonard
Haskie pursued a policy of erosion _ leaving MacDonald on an island
of power while taking control of the tribe's purse strings and
winning federal and judicial recognition.
   Haskie succeeded in replacing the police chief. Under new
leadership, officers on May 24 cleared MacDonald loyalists out of
the offices where they had slept to prevent just such a takeover.
   Lt. Daniel Hawkins led the sweep, and observers said it was no
accident that an attack on Hawkins precipitated the fracas Thursday
with tribal police coming to his defense.
   The violence was not the first in the controversy. Early on, a
MacDonald supporter attacked another man with a knife outside the
Tribal Council Building.
   In early April, Haskie backers marched on successive weekends to
Window Rock, where MacDonald supporters were waiting. During the
second demonstration, police threw tear gas to disperse the crowd.
   Amid the larger confrontations, incidents of shouting,
name-calling and bad feelings occurred almost daily.
   In the council's Feb. 13 action against MacDonald, 49 of the 88
council members voted to place the chairman on administrative leave
for investigation of claims that his fourth term was marred by
corruption.
   Although MacDonald has not been charged with a crime, testimony
delivered at January hearings of the U.S. Senate Select Committee
on Indian Affairs swayed many Navajos against him. Witnesses
described a system of government in which contractors seeking
on-reservation work were forced to pay thousands of dollars in
kickbacks.
   Others testified that MacDonald shared in the $7.2 million
profit turned by two non-Indian businessmen who bought a ranch and
sold it to the tribe less than 24 hours later.
   But the council insurgents overlooked the Navajos' respect for
MacDonald's leadership qualities, resolute nature and his charisma.
Many traditionalists rallied behind MacDonald regardless of the
legal or ethical issues.
   MacDonald knew how to play on the passions of his backers, says
Duane Beyal, Haskie's press aide.
   ``He's got a silver tongue. There's no denying that,'' Beyal
said in an interview in Window Rock last April. ``In that way, he
follows in the tradition of the great chiefs. But not in the other
ways.''
   John Chapela, a Window Rock lawyer, said MacDonald's magnetism
was so strong it could only be countered by videotapes of the
Senate hearings.
   Chapela said he taped the procedure and visited about one-fourth
of the Navajo chapters, or political wards, to show voters who
might have missed the televised sessions.
   MacDonald was marshaling his own support.
   Within days of his suspension, he began visiting the chapters to
outline his contention that Indian leaders had accepted gifts since
the dawn of tribal structure as a way to cement friendships for the
tribe. His dealings were no different, MacDonald said.
   MacDonald's fortunes waned as Haskie's brightened with a series
of legal victories, including an order from a tribal judge
restraining MacDonald from acting in an official capacity.
   MacDonald says it isn't over.
   ``There will be more violence,'' he said Friday.

   Six Greek Cypriot women alleged Sunday
that they were molested and beaten by Turkish Cypriot prison guards
and police after being arrested for taking part in a protest last
week.
   ``They treated us like animals,'' Georgia Petrou, 19, told
reporters after she and the five other women emerged from the
Turkish Cypriot prison where they had been held four days. All six
showed black bruises on their bodies they said were from beatings
by Turkish Cypriot police.
   Several hundred Greek Cypriots were in the fourth day of a
sit-in outside the headquarters of the 2,300-man U.N. peacekeeping
force at Nicosia airport, which lies on the Green Line dividing the
island into the Greek and Turkish sectors.
   They were demanding freedom for 108 Greek Cypriots _ 98 women
and 10 men _ arrested by Turkish Cypriot police Wednesday when they
stormed across the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone to protest the
Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.
   The issue threatens to wreck talks between leaders of the rival
communities aimed at reunifying the Mediterranean island.
   Government spokesman Akis Fantis said the United Nations
Security Council will meet in closed session in New York on Monday
to discuss the issue.
   A district court in the Turkish-held sector of Nicosia convicted
the 108 Greek Cypriots of violating the border of the Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which only Turkey recognizes.
   Ninety-two women and the 10 men were given sentences of two or
three days in jail and were fined from $100 to $200 each. Sixteen
young women were given suspended sentences, but only six were freed.
   The others refused to sign court documents promising not to
commit the same crime again and will remain in jail. They said
signing the statement would have implied recognition of the court's
legitimacy.
   The protesters faced a maximum penalty of 18 months and hefty
fines. But Judge Gonul Orenen said she was passing ``very lenient''
sentences to prevent further deterioration in relations between the
two communities.
   Margarita Michail, an 18-year-old women who was released, broke
down and sobbed as she talked about her detainment.
   ``We were pulled by the hair and our clothes, punched and kicked
and the Turkish policemen who arrested us grabbed our breasts and
genitals,'' she said.
   Others said they were verbally abused and spat on by a crowd of
Turkish Cypriot men and women while waiting to be taken into
detention after their arrest.
   Ms. Petrou said they spent the first night on the ground in a
sports complex. The following nights they slept on the floor of a
detention center with 40 people per room and only 18 beds.
   ``The women wardens terrorized us telling us they would turn us
over to men to be raped,'' she said.
   Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and President George
Vassiliou of Cyprus are scheduled to meet Wednesday for another
round in their 10 months of U.N.-sponsored talks on reunifying the
island.
   But Denktash has said he may not attend because of the crisis.
   Oscar Camilion, special respresentative of U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, drove across the Green
Line for talks with Denktash.
   The northern third of Cyprus was seized by the Turkish army when
it invaded July 20, 1974, following a short-lived coup in Nicosia
by supporters of union with Greece. An estimated 35,000 Turkish
troops guard the Turkish sector.
   The Moslem Turkish Cypriots, who form 17 percent of the island's
population, and the Christian Greeks had been feuding for years
before the invasion.

   The Internal Revenue Service, often called on
to defend its competence, will face a new challenge this week:
defending its integrity.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on consumer affairs
opens three days of hearings Tuesday into what Chairman Doug
Barnard Jr., D-Ga., called ``serious misconduct problems among
senior managers of IRS and a culture within the service that
glorifies the agency's public image at the expense of aggressive
investigation and punishment of wrongdoing.''
   Fred Goldberg, the new IRS commissioner, said the agency's
criminal investigation system works pretty well. But he and his
predecessor have refused to discuss the subcommittee's
investigation, citing a privacy-protection law that imposes
criminal penalties on anyone who discloses information about
individual tax files.
   Some members of Congress accuse the agency of hiding behind the
law, which was toughened after disclosures that Nixon
administration officials tried to use the IRS to punish political
enemies.
   The subcommittee has been on the investigation for more than a
year, checking events as far back as 1984. The most notable case
involves bribery allegations against Ronald Saranow, former chief
of the agency's criminal investigation division in Los Angeles.
   He was alleged to have been bribed by officials of jeans
manufacturer Guess, Inc., to launch an investigation of rival
Jordache Enterprises. The IRS last year cleared Saranow of
wrongdoing.
   Barnard's investigators say the IRS not only disregarded
important testimony against Saranow but leaked information to him
while he was still under investigation.
   IRS conduct also is drawing the attention of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. He said Saturday
that Congress needs to assign a small group of staffers to do
nothing but oversee IRS operations.
   ``You get into trouble with an agency when you have no checks
and balances _ no oversight in the administration of it,'' Bentsen
said in a televised interview prepared for broadcast in Texas.
   His Finance Committee staff said it is difficult for the IRS
commissioner to watch over operations of an agency that has more
than 80 field offices and employees in every state.
   Although the privacy statute can require Congress to overcome
substantia hurdles in monitoring the IRS, it should not be changed
because ``it provides valuable safeguards to American taxpayers,''
the committee staff said in a memo to Bentsen.
   The IRS cited the privacy statue in denying Barnard's House
subcommittee access to taxpayer files. He threatened to take the
fight to the House but back down because of all-out opposition from
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   Under the law, only Ways and Means, Senate Finance and the Joint
Committee on Taxation, on which Bentsen and Rostenkowski share
leadership, may see taxpayer files.
   In announcing the hearing, Barnard said his subcommittee has
``reason to believe that many changes are necessary at'' IRS if
Americans are to be believe that the tax laws are being
administered fairly.
   Goldberg and his top administrators say they are as ready to
take any advice as they are unwilling to discuss specific
allegations.
   ``We are wide open for considering anything they have to
suggest. The fact that there is somebody out there skimming money
leads you to the conclusion that something is wrong,'' Goldberg
said.
   ``Changes are already being made,'' added Michael Murphy, senior
deputy commissioner.
   Bruce B. Milburn, assistant commissioner for criminal
investigation, defends the 3,200 special agents assigned to probe
allegations of criminality as the most thorough in the world.
Because these agents are such professionals, he said, smart defense
lawyers often attempt to undermine a case by casting doubt on the
integrity of the investigator.
   ``Our integrity is the only asset we being to our job,'' he said.
   Teddy R. Kern, assistant commissioner for inspection, who is in
charge of monitoring the conduct of IRS employees, said that in
1987, 88 of IRS' 120,000 employees were convicted of criminal
charges following internal investigations. He noted with
satisfaction that Barnard has acknowledged that the subcommittee
probe has not uncovered widespread wrongdoing.
   ``Anybody who is anticipating a HUD-type situation,'' said Kern,
referring to widespread influence-peddling in the Department of
Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan administration,
``is going to be disappointed.''

   The murder trial of a man who led police on
the biggest manhunt in Missouri history has captivated residents of
this Ozarks community, who lived in fear for two months in 1987
before his capture.
   From restaurants to beauty parlors, residents of this college
town of 13,000 are buzzing about the trial of John David Brown.
   Brown, 35, became almost a folk hero, inspiring songs and
T-shirts, by managing to elude an army of more than 250 law
officers, bloodhounds and helicopters in the surrounding dense
forests before his May 28, 1987, capture by FBI agents at an
Oklahoma motel.
   He is charged with murdering a volunteer at a church in
Doolittle, four miles west of Rolla, during the two-month manhunt.
The trial in Phelps County Circuit Court, where all 100 seats in
the courtroom were filled throughout last week, was to begin its
second week Monday.
   ``It's the talk of my shop,'' beauty shop operator Lola Turner
said last week. ``There's still a question mark in some people's
minds whether he's a murderer or not. They definitely feel he's a
criminal, like I do.
   ``He had us scared there for a long time.''
   The trial was delayed for months by various motions and by lack
of funding in the public defender's office to pay for Brown's
defense.
   ``Personally, I think he's guilty,'' said Paul Miller, a
University of Missouri-Rolla student lunching in a fast-food
restaurant with friends. ``I'm getting tired of hearing about him,
though, and I know others are, too.''
   Assistant state attorney general Tim Finnical, who is seeking
the death penalty, contends that Brown shot Claude Long, 56, at the
New Apostolic Church on April 1, 1987, and then stole the victim's
car. At the time, police were hunting Brown for allegedly wounding
a Rolla police officer two days earlier in a motel parking lot.
   Much of Finnical's evidence is circumstantial, as there were no
witnesses to Long's slaying. However, Finnical said four ballistics
experts will testify that a .357-caliber Magnum revolver Brown
carried when he was arrested was the same gun used to kill Long.
   Finnical also produced several witnesses who had known or been
robbed by Brown, who had been on the loose since escaping from a
southwest Missouri prison in 1984, where he was serving a four-year
sentence for burglary and possessing explosive weapons. The manhunt
for him began, however, only after the police officer was shot.
   Brown's attorney, Brad Kessler of St. Louis, has labeled his
client a ``small-time burglar'' with a penchant for stealing guns,
but not a murderer.
   Kessler also has suggested that two Phelps County sheriff's
deputies might have entered the church looking for Brown and
accidentally shot Long, who somewhat resembled the bald,
bespectacled Brown.
   Finnical calls the theory ``ridiculous.''
   ``But ridiculous defenses have worked before,'' he said. ``It's
up to us to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that John David Brown
did it.''
   Kessler said prosecutors can't prove that Brown was ever in the
church.
   ``They ask for the death penalty to bolster their tenuous
evidence,'' he said. ``You ask for death to raise the stakes.''
   Kessler said he did not know whether Brown would testify.
   The trial has featured some emotional testimony.
   Reinhard Bandowski, who found Long's body near a water fountain
in the church kitchen, broke down and cried on the witness stand
when Finnical handed him a picture of the body.
   ``Oh, the blood ... the brains,'' Bandowski said.
   But the trial also has had its lighter moments.
   Lee Lambert of Kansas City identified Brown as the man he saw in
a stolen pickup truck parked outside his home in 1984. However,
Kessler noted Lambert had told police that the man had brushy
eyebrows and an Elvis Presley-like haircut.
   Pointing to Brown, Kessler asked, ``This is Elvis you see here?''

<HEAD>First Unsanctioned Opposition Candidate Elected in 40 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 35-year-old Lutheran minister has
become the first fully independent opposition candidate elected to
Parliament in more than 40 years, state-run media said Sunday.
   Gabor Roszik won 69.2 percent of the ballots cast in a
by-election Saturday in the town of Goedoelloe, about 15 miles
northeast of Budapest, the MTI news agency said.
   Roszik was supported by a coalition of three of Hungary's
strongest democratic opposition groups _ the Hungarian Democratic
Forum, the League of Free Democrats and the youth group FIDESZ. He
defeated Communist Party candidate Laszlo Koeresfoei, a 58-year-old
school administrator.
   Three other by-elections Saturday in the southern towns of
Szeged, Kecskemet and Kiszkunfelegyhaza will be repeated Aug. 5 due
to low turnout or the failure of candidates to get a required
majority of the vote, MTI said.
   State radio said hot weather kept many Hungarians away from the
polls.
   The low turnout indicated that neither the opposition nor the
party mobilized Hungarians, who are preoccupied with falling living
standards and inflation of at least 18 percent.
   It contrasted sharply with turnouts of more than 90 percent that
had been claimed by the Communists for past elections.
   ``We are continuing where we left off in 1956,'' Roszik told an
election rally last month, alluding to the short-lived revolt
against Stalinism in 1956 that was crushed by Kremlin troops and
tanks.
   Peter Polonyi, a retired museum director who earlier tried to
run as a candidate in Goedoelloe, said of the race there: ``It
seems anyone will do as long as they are not Communist Party
members. Indeed, the stronger the attacks on the party, the greater
the candidate's popularity.''
   Saturday's by-elections were the first since 1947 to offer
voters a genuine choice between Communist Party candidates and
candidates put up by independent opposition groups.
   Hungary held multicandidate elections for the 387-member
Parliament in 1985. Twenty-five percent of those elected were not
from the Communist Party, but all candidates in those elections had
to be approved by the Patriotic People's Front, a
Communist-dominated umbrella organization for social or political
groups. The Communists prevented dissidents such as Laszlo Rajk Jr.
from becoming candidates.
   In Kecskemet and Szeged, the turnout was 44.1 percent and 45.2
percent respectively, MTI said, meaning new elections are needed
because a 50 percent minimum turnout is required for the ballot to
be valid.
   In Kiszkunfelegyhaza, 61.5 percent of the electorate turned out,
but none of the three candidates _ a lawyer running with Communist
Party support, a 34-year-old doctor backed by the former Communist
youth league and an independent teacher _ got more than 50 percent
of the vote, MTI said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is not willing to
agree to raise taxes in the future in exchange for an immediate cut
in the capital gains tax, White House budget director Richard
Darman said Sunday.
   Even though President Bush has had discussions with House
Speaker Thomas Foley and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of
the Ways and Means chairman, ``the president is firmly committed to
his pledge not to raise taxes,'' Darman said on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation.''
   ``We're not talking about a deal'' Darman said. ``Others are
talking about it, but the administration is not interested in
that.''
   The Office of Management and Budget director said the Democratic
leaders were blocking action on the capital gains tax cut that Bush
wants.
   ``We believe that right now, we have the votes for a
satisfactory capital gains proposal in the Ways and Means
Committee. Our only problem is ... (Foley and Rostenkowski) won't
actually bring it up for a vote,'' said Darman.
   Foley and other Democrats have contended that lowering the
capital gains tax would hurt the Treasury and help the wealthy.
Bush argues it would stimulate economic growth and thus be a net
money-raiser, not a loser, for the Treasury.
   Asked how long Bush intended to stick by his no-tax-increase
pledge, Darman said, ``For the time being, let's assume forever _
but I don't know exactly what that means.''
   Darman called ``flawed'' a Treasury Department analysis that a
capital gains tax cut would be a money-loser after two years.
   Darman defended Bush's newly announced space goals, including a
return to the moon and eventual manned flight to Mars. Bush has not
put a pricetag on them.
   Asked where the money would come from, Darman said, ``It's going
to come from the growth of our economy and wise investment of the
federal budget.''
   Darman said he could think of no better investment ``than
investment in space. ... Let's choose the future.''
   Astrophysicist James van Allen called Bush's space plans
``extremely vague,'' and said the idea of sending ``human crews to
Mars is ... straight out of 17th century science fiction.''
   Both the moon and Mars are ``of great scientific interest,'' van
Allen said, but investigating them with unmanned spacecraft would
be ``a far more fruitful way to go.''
   ``The heavy hitters in the space program are the unmanned
spacecraft, which operate all day, every day, for in many cases
many years,'' said van Allen.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration chief Richard H.
Truly defended Bush's space goals, saying, ``It's one of the most
rational sets of statements and goals that I've heard about the
space program in a long, long time.''
   Truly, a former astronaut, said ``a balanced program'' of manned
and unmanned flights is needed. He bemoaned the battle between
advocates of manned and unmanned space exploration, likening it to
cowboys ``circling the wagons and then firing inward.''
   Van Allen called himself one of Truly's fans, but insisted, ``If
you want to give me any specific example of a scientific or
practical mission, I will identify an unmanned method which is far
cheaper and less expensive than the manned method.''

<TEXT>
   Mutterings can be heard in this sawmill
town about the ``southerners'' and how the long-running battle over
the region's forests could have been solved long ago without their
interference.
   They're talking about city dwellers from urbanized southern
Ontario, from such places as Toronto, where environmentalists have
taken on the fight to preserve Temagami's old-growth red and white
pine forests. The bulk of Canada's population lives in southern
areas not far from the U.S. border.
   This is Canada's Near North, a term used to differentiate it
from the more vast and less populated barren stretches leading to
the Arctic farther north.
   In addition to environmentalists and other ``southerners,'' the
battle involves sawmill operators and forest product companies,
eager to preserve precedents of access to lumber supplies, and an
Indian tribe trying to assert a land claim.
   Canadians have long debated how to develop their resource-rich,
rugged northern areas. Since the 19th century, Temagami has been a
wilderness destination for Canadians and Americans looking for a
remote escape.
   The diverging interests have resulted in a standoff over
Temagami's majestic forests, defying solution at a time when
environmental issues have surged to the top of public concern
nationally and internationally.
   Brian Back of the Temagami Wilderness Society said he hopes the
chord of concern that the Brazilian rain forest's plight has struck
in Canada can be translated into intensified interest in troubles
closer to home.
   As the environmentalists tell it, the logging industry supported
by the provincial government is threatening the largest virgin pine
forest left in Ontario.
   ``There is no comparable, accessible wilderness that we know
about,'' Back said.
   Tourist brochures for the region note that it is not only within
a day's drive of the eastern Canadian cities of Toronto and
Montreal but also of Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit and other American
cities.
   Confrontations over forests also have taken place on Canada's
Pacific Coast, most recently in the Carmanah and Stein valleys of
British Columbia. But no dispute in the eastern part of the country
has been as intractable or received as much attention as that in
Temagami.
   The Temagami Wilderness Society has attracted 14,000 members.
   Brian Moulder, district planner for the Ontario Ministry of
Natural Resources that oversees land use for public lands, insisted
that enough balance has been given to all interests and enough set
aside for wilderness reserve.
   ``There's been harvesting (of trees) in this district for over
100 years,'' he said. ``There must be economic advantage, or they
would have quit a long time ago.''
   Environmentalists respond that the ante was raised by the
mechanization of the logging industry since the 1950s that required
ever larger sawmills to be fed by clearcutting of trees instead of
selective harvesting.
   Canada is the world's largest exporter of forest products,
sending 22 percent of all forest products traded on international
markets. There are some 300 towns across the country where the
industry serves as a mainstay.
   Temagami is a nondescript town of about 1,100 people on Canada's
North-South Highway 11, about a five-hour drive north of Toronto.
On first glance it would seem an unlikely spot as the centerpiece
for an environmental battle, but the area around it includes not
only the forests but also a vast system of interlocking waterways
ideal for canoeing.
   The fight specifically is over whether logging roads can be
extended to allow clearcutting in previously inaccessible areas.
   A local Algonquin Indian group, the Teme-Augama Anishnabai,
filed a claim in 1973 for 4,000 square miles of land. The claim was
rejected a decade later but development in the interim was halted
on public lands.
   Appeals until recently kept any logging road from being extended
and also allowed time for the protests to gather support and
symbolic value as a rallying cry.
   ``I don't like how the land is being treated,'' Michael Paul, an
Indian who performed the tobacco ceremony at a recent blockade of a
logging road, said at his home on Bear Island.
   The Indians rejected a $35 million settlement offer from the
government in 1986 but recently resumed talks.
   The Ontario government gave the go-ahead for work on two logging
road extensions to proceed after the last appeal was rejected in
provincial court this spring, although no logging has yet been
allowed in the disputed area.
   Those who favor allowing more clearcutting say its effects can
be compared to those of a forest fire, clearing out growth that no
longer is productive and setting the stage for new trees to grow.
   They also say a steady supply of timber can insure that at least
some sawmill jobs will remain in Temagami, if not the 150 that
existed when the mill could operate at its peak.
   The local William Milne &amp; Sons mill has been in receivership
since last December but a scaled down version is expected to resume
operations soon.
   The wilderness advocates, however, argue that the old growth
with trees dating back generations cannot be replaced. They say the
new forest that would spring up in its wake would not harbor the
greater diversity of natural life now existing, especially in the
fragile northern environment.
   ``There's never been an adequate evaluation of what's there,''
Don Huff, environmental director of the Federation of Ontario
Naturalists, said. ``There's no place else that still has this
combination of things still relatively intact.''

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Catholic in Belfast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several masked gunmen barged
into a home in West Belfast on Sunday and killed a 37-year-old
Roman Catholic, police said.
   The victim's 13-year-old son witnessed the attack but was
unhurt, said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
Northern Ireland's police force.
   Police were uncertain how many gunmen participated in what was
believed to be a sectarian killing.
   The spokesman said the gunmen fled in a car that had been stolen
earlier in the day. The car was found abandoned in Belfast on
Sunday afternoon.
   It was the 30th death this year attributed to the conflict in
the British-ruled province between unionists, mainly Protestants,
who favor continued ties with Great Britain and republicans, mainly
Roman Catholic, who seek an end to British rule.
   Traffic on both sides of the border was diverted Sunday after
the Irish Republican Army claimed it had planted bombs along three
main roads between the province and the Irish Republic.
   Police said roads from Letterkenny, Buncrana and the seaside
resort of Muff, in the northern tip of Ireland, to Northern
Ireland's County Londonderry were closed while troops searched for
bombs. The crossing at Buncrana was reopened Sunday afternoon.
   A wooden box was found on the Letterkenny road early Sunday and
was being examined, said a spokesman for the constabulary. Nothing
suspicious was found on the other two routes, he said.
   For seven months, the IRA has been disrupting rail service
across the border. The IRA said in a statement in March that one
aim of the bombers was to draw British troops out of their hilltop
bunkers and into more vulnerable positions in the countryside.
   In the central region of the province, police said security
forces found a significant arms cache _ including a machine gun,
assault rifle, two grenades from a Soviet-made RPG-7 grenade
launcher, and 500 rounds of ammunition _ along the road between
Coalisland and Stewartstown in County Tyrone.

<HEAD>Government Says Plan to Blow Up Bridge Foiled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Sunday said it
foiled a plot to blow up a vital bridge that links Afghanistan and
its main weapons supplier, the Soviet Union.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the plan was
discovered after Afghan security forces arrested a Pakistani
citizen, Mukhtar Gul, on July 6.
   Speaking to a small group of reporters, Gul said he and two
compatriots were recruited to destroy Friendship Bridge in
Hayratan, 350 miles northwest of Kabul.
   The bridge, which spans the Oxus River separating Afghanistan
and the Soviet Union, is the lifeline for the Kabul government in
its battle with Moslem guerrillas.
   ``Our mission was to blow up the bridge and thus cut the supply
line from Russia to Afghanistan,'' said the 25-year-old Gul, who
was introduced as a medical school dropout and an expert in
underwater diving and subversion.
   Gul said he worked for a Pakistani government organization
called CID. He did not elaborate.
   Gulf said he received training in subversion from an American in
the Pakistani border city of Peshawar, where many of the guerrillas
are based. The American was known to him only as Karim Abdul Hakim,
he said.
   ``We had enough explosives and weapons to carry out our mission,
but before that, I was arrested,'' said Gul, speaking in Urdu, the
most common language in Pakistan.
   It was not immediately known what happened to the other two
Pakistanis who had accompanied Gul.
   Guls' claims, which he said were not made under duress, could
not be independently confirmed.
   The government has often accused Pakistan, its southeastern
neighbor, of being directly involved in the civil war, a charge
Islamabad denies.
   In a statement released after the news conference, the
government said, ``The U.S. has been trying to use Pakistan as a
springboard of aggression for carrying out its strategic objectives
in the region.
   ``Now the U.S. authorities want to use Afghan territory also for
such vicious ends as well,'' the statement said.
   The United States is the main weapons supplier to the
guerrillas, known as mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors. They have
been fighting 11 years to oust the government.
   The Soviet Union ended its nine-year military involvement in
Afghanistan on Feb. 15 but continues to ship huge quantities or
arms to Afghan government forces.

<HEAD>Heavily Armed Rioters Try to Provoke Troops in Georgia</HEAD>

   Security troops sent to quell ethnic
rioting in Soviet Georgia are facing groups of heavily armed
extremists who apparently want to provoke them into firing on
civilians, official reports said Sunday.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported that the commanders of
internal security troops in Abkhazia, a Black Sea enclave about 880
miles south of Moscow, appealed to the local populace to resist
``extremists and bandits, not to allow further bloodshed.''
   The commanders said they did not blame the populace for the
slayings Friday of two security soldiers, whose deaths brought to
19 the number of poeple killed in a week of rioting by ethnic
Georgians and Abkhazians.
   ``But at the same time, it's possible that there are forces that
are not against creating clashes between the population and
soldiers in order to provoke the troops into using their weapons,
which they haven't done once in Abkhazia,'' the appeal said.
   In Sukhumi, Abkhazia's capital, public transport resumed after
days of paralysis from a strike, residents said Sunday in telephone
interviews.
   But activists in Georgia have proposed a general strike Monday
to protest what they see as a failure by police and troops to
protect ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia.
   Interior Ministry officers in Abkhazia told Pravda they had
``never seen so many weapons in the hands of the population.''
   The two police killed Friday were shot with hunting rifles as
they were clearing roadblocks and confiscating weapons in western
Georgia.
   As a result of the continuing violence, two regional party
secretaries were fired and two government leaders in Abkhazia lost
their jobs Saturday.
   Abkhazians and Georgians blame each other for the ethnic unrest.
   Abkhazians, who are a minority in their own region, want greater
economic independence and cultural rights, while Georgians want the
fertile enclave, with its seaside resorts, retained as part of
their Caucasus republic.
   The Georgian youth newspaper Molodyozh Gruzii said Georgian
leaders want to develop a dialogue over problems besetting the
region, but that Abkhazians want the Kremlin to establish an
outside body to take control of the region.
   At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the past
month in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.

<HEAD>Fight Over B-2 Highlights Debate on Military Spending Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: To UPDATE with Cheney comments on B-2, INSERTS three grafs after
12th graf bgng ``The Bush administration ... ''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Congress tackles military spending this week
as President Bush wages a last-ditch effort to save the B-2 bomber
from money-conscious legislators opposed to the $530 million
aircraft.
   Bush had groups of members to the White House on two occasions
last week and plans to make individual pleas this week that the
B-2, designed to penetrate Soviet airspace, is key to the nation's
strategic nuclear deterrence.
   ``The president is concerned by the opposition,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday.
   Lawmakers have expressed ``sticker shock'' at the plane's cost.
The Pentagon has already invested about $23 billion in the program
and wants an additional $70 billion to buy 132 copies of the plane.
   The one plane that exists has made one test flight _ lasting
about two hours.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, the focus this week remains on the
unfolding scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the flag desecration issue and the savings and loan
industry bailout.
   Debate on the military spending bill will be highlighted by two
amendments to the defense bill that would either end the B-2
program or severely limit it.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, is proposing paying for just two bombers in 1990 and
1991 rather than the eight sought by the Pentagon. Aspin believes
Congress needs more information on the radar-evading plane before
deciding whether to kill it or spend more money.
   Two Republicans, John Rowland of Connecticut and John Kasich of
Ohio, and Democrat Ronald Dellums of California will introduce an
amendment to complete work on the 13 bombers under way and mothball
the production line.
   Rowland was one lawmaker summoned to the White House Friday, but
Bush's argument failed to sway him.
   ``I was not convinced by the president's remarks,'' Rowland
said. ``There are a small number of Republicans and hopefully a
large number of Democrats'' who believe testing should be completed
before a commitment is made to build the 132 planes, Rowland said.
   The Bush administration has proposed spending $4.7 billion in
fiscal 1990 for the B-2, but the House Armed Services Committee cut
that amount by $800 million.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday he was hopeful that
the administration's arguments in support of the B-2 program would
eventually prevail on Capitol Hill.
   ``I think we're going to do fairly well. That is, I think we'll
come out of it with what the House Armed Services Committee
recommended. I hope in the House we'll be able to defeat the
amendments to kill it outright,'' Cheney said on ABC's ``This Week
With David Brinkley.''
   Cheney noted that the congressional debate ``is partly over
priorities. The people who want to cut the B-2 program aren't
suggesting that tax dollars ought to go back to the Treasury or to
the taxpayer. They want to spend them on other systems.''
   Support remains strong for the program on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, which trimmed just $300 million from the B-2
request.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel, said Sunday he
agrees with Bush's contention that failure to proceed with the B-2
could vitally affect strategic arms control efforts.
   ``I think we'd have to go back to the drawing board on arms
control,'' Nunn said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' program. ``We have
premised our basic arms control position on bombers being a vital
part of our overall triad,'' together with land-based and
submarine-launched missiles.
   Nunn described the B-2 as ``a very stabilizing weapon'' because
unlike missiles, the bombers can be recalled after they have been
put on airborne alert during a crisis.
   ``I'm particularly troubled by the House of Representatives,''
Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the committee,
said Friday. ``When this plane rolled out, some of the facts rolled
out and now some people can't take the heat. And they're ducking
under the table.''
   Another Republican on the committee, Sen. Malcolm Wallop of
Wyoming, said if Congress chooses to limit spending instead of
canceling the program or agreeing to the Bush request, it would be
``the most irresponsible path to take.''
   Debate over the stealth aircraft overshadowed such perennial
fights as funds for the Strategic Defensive Initiative and the
multiple-warhead, rail garrison MX missile vs. the single-warhead
Midgetman.
   The House Armed Services panel slashed $1.1 billion from Bush's
proposal of $4.9 billion for SDI, commonly known as Star Wars. The
Senate Armed Services Committee cut $400 million from the
president's request.
   Both panels accepted the administration's plan to fund two
mobile missiles with $1.1 billion to move the existing 50 MX
missiles from silos to railroad cars and $100 million for the
Midgetman.
   The House and Senate also are expected to clash with the Bush
plan to cancel the V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that takes
off like a helicopter and can fly like a plane, and the F-14D
Tomcat jet fighter.
   The V-22 is a top priority for lawmakers from Pennsylvania and
Texas where the aircraft is manufactured. Members from New York,
particularly Long Island, have lobbied intensely for the F-14D,
which is made by Grumman Corp.
   In other action this week:
   _Congress is pursuing an investigation of the scandal at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The House Government
Operations housing subcommittee will hear from Lynda Murphy, a
former career HUD employee, about dealings with her friend, Deborah
Gore Dean. Dean was executive assistant to former HUD secretary
Samuel Pierce, but numerous witnesses have described her as almost
a surrogate Cabinet member who was heavily involved in funneling
department money to well-placed Republicans.
   _The House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a drafting session
to deal with responses to last month's Supreme Court's decision
that burning the American flag is a protected form of political
expression. The panel's subcommittee on constitutional rights
completed hearings last week on the issue. Congress is divided over
whether to seek a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration
or to address the matter through a simple change in the law.
   _After working behind closed doors most of last week, House and
Senate negotiators working on a $166 billion bailout plan for the
savings and loan industry will meet Tuesday with hopes of nailing
down a final package. The major remaining disagreement is how to
raise the $50 billion needed immediately to cover the loss of
federally insured deposits in some 500 S&amp;Ls at or near insolvency
because of poor and often fraudulent lending.

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
at first base outshone a team of U.S. stars to be named player of
the game and help Canada beat the United States 13-12 in a
celebrity softball game.
   The U.S. team included Los Angeles Kings hockey star Wayne
Gretzky and his wife, actress Janet Jones; actor Gene Hackman, and
the star of the ``MacGyver'' television series, Richard Dean
Anderson.
   Also playing were former hockey star Gordie Howe, musician Dan
Hill and actresses Catherine Mary Stewart and Jo-Beth Williams.
   Rick Hansen, the Man in Motion wheelchair athlete, played for
Canada and was the crowd favorite. He drew the only standing
ovation when the stars were announced.
   The game Saturday was organized by musician-producer David
Foster, who said the event raised as much as $250,000 (Canadian) to
help families of children who need organ transplants.
   Despite heavy security, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers
were not around Mulroney at first base because ``they're not good
enough to make this cut,'' the prime minister joked.
   ``The Mounties are terrific, but this is the big league,''
Mulroney said.

<HEAD>Kirov Shines in Two Mixed Bills</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kirov Ballet ended its 19-day season here
with two programs of short ballets in which, surprisingly,
principal dancers shone more brightly than they had in full-evening
ballets danced earlier.
   Both mixed-bill programs will be presented during the July 25
-Aug. 6 Kennedy Center season and the Aug. 18 to 27 engagement in
Costa Mesa, Calif. Only the full-length ``Sleeping Beauty'' and
``Le Corsaire'' are scheduled for San Francisco, Aug. 9 to 16.
   The more interesting program was the second one, because it
contained two ballets choreographed by George Balanchine. At 10,
Balanchine began studying at the Imperial School of Ballet which,
renamed, is the Kirov's school. He left Russia in 1924. The Kirov
didn't dance his ballets in his lifetime.
   On Saturday night, the company danced ``Scotch Symphony,'' as
restaged for it by Suzanne Farrell, one of Balanchine's last great
ballerinas, and ``Theme and Variations,'' staged by Francia
Russell, who was a New York City Ballet ballerina in the 1950s and
'60s and afterward often set Balanchine ballets for European
companies.
   The Kirov danced both ballets splendidly, with no apparent
problems with the style. ``Theme and Variations,'' to music by
Tchaikovsky, was intended by Balanchine to evoke Russian ballet's
classical ballet heyday and ``Scotch Symphony,'' to evoke
Mendelssohn, also is on the classical side of Balanchine's
choreographic spectrum.
   Yelena Pankova and Irina Chistyakova were splendid in ``Scotch
Symphony,'' which seemed _ maybe because of a painted backdrop _ to
take on more of a story than when the New York City Ballet dances
it. Farukh Ruzimatov, with exotic, dark eye makeup, was the
dramatic partner of Larisa Lezhnina in ``Theme and Variations.''
   In both mixed bills, viewers saw fewer balance problems than in
earlier programs. The Kirov corps de ballet was matchless
throughout the engagement.
   A group of classical pas de deux was inserted in the center of
both mixed bills. Yulia Makhalina and Konstantin Zaklinsky and the
corps de ballet were beautiful in the adagio from ``Swan Lake.'' A
charming trio from ``The Fairy Doll,'' a ballerina flirting with
two clowns _ as at an ice show, the clowns have to be
super-proficient _ followed.
   Altynai Asylmuratova and Eldar Aliyev made an excerpt from ``La
Esmeralda'' far more exciting than the other couple we saw. Galina
Mezentseva did an evocative but rather short ``The Dying Swan.''
   Saturday night's audience was most enthusiastic. During final
curtain calls, small bouquets were thrown from the boxes, landing
at the feet of dancers who were clapping back at the audience.
   The first mixed bill ended with ``Paquita'' and began with
``Chopiniana,'' known in the West as ``Les Sylphides.'' Zhanna
Ayupova, Irina Sitnikova and Kirill Melnikov were good but Natalya
Pavlova's landings weren't always in time with the music.
Throughout the engagement, musical tempos were slower than many
balletgoers ever had heard and sometimes, during a ballet, the
tempo would slow still more, several times.

   Minnesotan Will Steger's International
Trans-Antarctica Expedition has reached its last stop in South
America to await improved weather for the last leg of the flight to
Antarctica.
   The Soviet cargo jet carrying the St. Paul-based dog sled
expedition landed Saturday at Punta Arenas, Chile, on the Strait of
Magellan.
   Blowing snow and poor visibility over King George Island, off
the northwest tip of the Antarctic Penninsula, kept Steger's group
from continuing Saturday. Storms sometimes prohibit travel to
Antarctica for as long as two weeks.
   ``From now on, it's all forward. A break in the weather and
we'll head straight south,'' Steger told a reporter from the St.
Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch who was on the flight.
   The group's arrival in Punta Arenas ended a taxing weeklong
flight from Minneapolis-St. Paul aboard a Soviet Ilyushin-76, one
aspect of the international partnership symbolized by the
expedition. The six team members are from six nations.
   Corporations and individuals have donated much of the $11
million it will cost to support them on their seven-month,
4,000-mile trek.
   Others have crossed Antarctica on snowmobiles and giant snow
tractors, but if this group succeeds, it would be the first
unmechanized crossing.
   The expedition was marred early, when two of Steger's 42 sled
dogs died during an unscheduled repair layover in steamy Havana,
Cuba.
   As unprecedented as Steger's attempt to cross the width of
Antarctica will be the attempt by Soviet pilots to land their bulky
Ilyushin-76 on the hostile continent.
   ``It is a pioneer flight to Antarctica,'' said Arthur
Chilingarov, a Soviet official who is escorting the expedition
south.
   The Chilean-owned runway on King George Island is a 4,290-foot
strip cut across an isthmus. Overrunning it means a drop into the
sea. The strip is hard-packed ground during the austral summer, but
now it is hidden beneath 9 inches of ice.
   The Ilyushin-76, a wide-bellied plane similar to the U.S.
military's C-141 and capable of carrying some 88,000 pounds, is
more typically flown from concrete runways stretching to 8,250 feet.
   Chief pilot Stanislav Bliznyuk, top test pilot for the Ilyushin
air manufacturing concern, has never landed one on ice.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Ruling Sends Woman Across State Line For Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman carrying a severely deformed fetus was
left with a choice of a 250-mile trip to get an abortion or going
to another state because of the Supreme Court's ruling on
Missouri's abortion law, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   In its ruling July 3, the U.S. Supreme Court said Missouri can
bar public hospitals from performing abortions. Within hours of
that decision, Truman Medical Center, a public hospital in Kansas
City, ordered its doctors to stop performing abortions.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a 24-year-old woman
was referred to a specialist at Truman who confirmed through tests
that the 19-week-old fetus she was carrying had deformities that
made survival outside the womb impossible. A doctor familiar with
the case told the newspaper the fetus' heart was outside the chest
wall and that its abdominal organs were outside the abdominal wall.
   ``Before the Supreme Court decision, she would have had a
therapeutic abortion at Truman,'' said Dr. Howard Schwartz, an
obstetrician and gynecologist who was a consultant on the case.
   Truman was believed to be the only site in Kansas City where
second-trimester abortions were widely available before the Supreme
Court ruling. After the ruling, the nearest clinic in Missouri
where the woman could have gotten a second-trimester abortion was
across the state in St. Louis, a 250-mile drive.
   Instead, the woman was referred to Comprehensive Health for
Women, a private gynecological clinic in nearby Overland Park,
Kan., a Kansas City suburb about 20 miles away.
   The fetus was aborted in a two-day procedure July 11 and 12, and
the woman's insurance company paid for it.
   Schwartz said he thought the woman's abortion was the first of
what would ``turn out to be many cases of Missouri women crossing
to another state or traveling to St. Louis to obtain abortions.''
   Adele Hughey, executive director of Comprehensive Health, said
abortion was the woman's ``only real option.''
   ``The condition of the fetus was totally incompatible with
life,'' Hughey said. ``She could have carried the fetus through the
entire term of pregnancy, knowing that the outcome would be a dead
baby, or have an abortion and then try to get pregnant again. But
by carrying the fetus to term, she might have jeopardized her own
health and also delayed another pregnancy.''

   Opera singer Martti Talvela has died of
a sudden illness at age 54, the national radio reported Sunday.
   Talvela died Saturday night in his home in eastern Finland, the
radio said, without saying what the illness was.
   Talvela recently agreed to become the director of the Finnish
National Opera and was due to begin in 1992. From 1972 to 1979,
Talvela was the artistic director of the Savonlinna Opera Festival
in eastern Finland.
   Talvela, born February 2, 1935, began his international career
in 1960, and was acclaimed in major opera centers, including the
New York Metropolitan, for his powerful bass voice.
   He was especially famous for his interpretation of the title
role in Mussorgsky's opera ``Boris Godunov.'' Talvela had also
recorded extensively.

<HEAD>Former New Jersey Congressman Involved in Abscam Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Frank Thompson Jr., a New Jersey congressman
for 26 years before his political career fell apart in the Abscam
scandal, has died. He would have been 71 on Wednesday.
   A spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins Hospital said Thompson died
shortly after 6 p.m. Saturday. He had undergone surgery for throat
cancer earlier in the week.
   Thompson had had a long history of heart disease, and underwent
coronary bypass surgery in 1964. A lifelong smoker, he had given up
cigarettes about a year ago, his longtime admistrative assistant,
William Deitz, told The Times of Trenton, N.J.
   ``He had called me Monday and said the bad news was they had
found a malignancy,'' Deitz told the newspaper. ``But the good news
was they thought they could get it with a laser.''
   Thompson was born in Trenton on July 26, 1918. He served as a
Naval officer in World War II and attended Wake Forest University
and Law School in North Carolina. In 1949, he was elected to the
New Jersey Assembly, and in 1954 to the U.S. House of
Representatives. He was re-elected 12 times, usually by
overwhelming margins, and was chairman of the House Administration
Committee.
   Thompson was a political ally of the Kennedy family when John F.
Kennedy was president, and headed his voter registration drive in
1960. A leader of Democratic liberals in the House, he oversaw
passage of major education and labor bills in Congress and the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
   He sponsored bills creating the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts and the National Endowments for the Arts and
Humanities.
   Thompson's political career ended in 1980 after he was indicted
by a federal grand jury for accepting bribes from FBI agents posing
as big-spending investors. He was defeated in that November's
election by Republican Chris Smith.
   In December 1980, Thompson was convicted by a federal jury, and
served almost two years in the federal corrections center in
Lexington, Ky. He maintained until the end that he was innocent.
   According to Thompson's Abscam indictment, he agreed to use his
influence to help a group of Arab businessmen on ``an immigration
matter.'' He and Philadelphia lawyer Howard L. Criden met with the
undercover FBI agents and accepted $50,000. Thompson then agreed to
introduce the agents to other members of Congress willing to take
bribes.
   He met with Rep. John M. Murphy, D-N.Y., who later went with
Criden to a meeting with the agents and was given $50,000 for his
promise to help on the immigration matter. The payment was shared
by Murphy, Thompson, Criden and others, the indictment charged.
   Thompson and Murphy were tried together and both were convicted.
Thompson took the stand in his own defense and denied ever having
received bribes.
   Since being paroled in September 1985, he had lived in
Alexandria, Va., and worked as a consultant.
   Thompson is survived by his wife, Evelina, two daughters and a
brother. Funeral arrangements were pending.

   A U.S. diplomat suspected of

   The tabloid Kurier quoted Foreign Minister Alois Mock as saying
he was ``shattered'' when he heard that his close friend, U.S.
diplomat Felix S. Bloch, was suspected of collaborating with Soviet
agents in Vienna.
   Sources in Washington said Saturday that Bloch, who has not been
charged with any crime, had access to some of the United States'
most sensitive non-nuclear secrets. Bloch, former deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Austria, is the highest-ranking U.S.
diplomat ever identifed as the target of an intelligence
investigation involving the Soviet Union.
   Mock, who studied with Bloch at the Bologna Center of
Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University in 1957 and 1958, said he
first heard about suspicions regarding Bloch three weeks ago
``through Austrian channels,'' the tabloid said.
   ``I'm deeply shaken and really shattered,'' Mock was quoted as
saying.
   He said he could not have unwittingly passed sensitive
information to Bloch. ``I was very careful there,'' said Mock, who
on Friday abruptly postponed a visit to the United States this week
``for personal reasons.''
   Kurier quoted Mock as speaking of ``a certain suspicion on the
U.S. side reaching back into the 1970s.'' He refused to provide
details.
   But he said that if such suspicions existed, ``it's quite
inexplicable how Bloch could stay in such high posts,'' according
to the tabloid.
   Mock was in the west Austrian city of Bregenz on Sunday and
could not be reached for comment. A man answering the telephone at
the Foreign Ministry in Vienna refused to comment on the report or
to connect a reporter with a spokesman who would.
   Kurier said the minister described Bloch as ``an over-ambitious
career diplomat'' who ``always suffered that he had to serve under
political appointees and never got to be an ambassador himself.''
   One of the ambassadors Bloch served was Helene von Damm, an
Austrian-born appointee of President Reagan, who caused a scandal
in Viennese society by marrying Peter Guertler, owner of the city's
famed Hotel Sacher.
   Ms. von Damm, who was not reachable at her Vienna residence
Sunday, resigned in June 1985, citing speculation that her marriage
constituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic duties.
   Bloch came to Vienna in 1980 as head of the embassy's economics
section and was later appointed deputy chief of mission. He ran the
Vienna embassy after Ms. von Damm's resignation until Ronald S.
Lauder arrived in April 1986.
   Lauder said Saturday that he demanded that Bloch be recalled in
the summer of 1987 because ``he went outside of channels ... he
went around me'' in dealing with the Austrian Foreign Ministry.
   Bloch was too close to the Austrian government and ``extremely
close to the foreign minister,'' Lauder said.
   Relations between the United States and Austria were strained at
the time of Bloch's recall over the U.S. decision to place
President Kurt Waldheim on a Watch List of persons barred from
entering the United States.
   That decision, announced in May 1987, resulted from Waldheim's
World War II past as a German soldier with the Nazis in the
Balkans. Waldheim had kept his Balkans service a secret until 1986,
when Austrian and U.S. media and the World Jewish Congress
disclosed it during a bitter presidential campaign in Austria.
   Waldheim has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the Balkans.
   Mock, who until recently was leader of the conservative People's
Party, has been one of Waldheim's staunchest backers and recently
launched another effort to try to get the president removed from
the Watch List.

   An appellate court panel probably withdrew
its opinion ordering Topeka to do more to integrate its schools
because the majority wants to respond to a dissenting judge's
criticism, lawyers in the Brown vs. Board of Education
desegregation case said Sunday.
   The 10th U.S. Court of Appeals' withdrawal of the opinion
without explanation last week had baffled both sides in the case.
   ``This is purely my speculation,'' said Rich Jones, a Topeka
lawyer who represents the plaintiffs in the 38-year-old case. ``But
I think somewhere in the dissent someone is criticizing somebody
else, and the majority wants an opportunity to respond to that
criticism.''
   Charles McAtee of Topeka, one of the attorneys who argued the
case for the school board, said he ``would tend to agree with Mr.
Jones.''
   The other possibility, McAtee said, ``is the dissenting judge
has persuaded one of the other two judges to join him in his view
but, quite frankly, I think that's unlikely.''
   On Friday, the panel informed attorneys it was pulling back its
June 2 ruling, which had reversed a district court judge's opinion
that Topeka was substantially in compliance with the landmark 1954
U.S. Supreme Court decision that ended racial segregation in the
nation's schools.
   The court's notice gave no reason for the withdrawal.
   The most pessimistic interpretation for the plaintiffs, Jones
agreed, is that the dissenter in the June ruling by the
Denver-based 10th Circuit, Judge Bobby R. Baldock, has persuaded
one of the two other judges, Monroe McKay and Stephanie Seymour, to
reverse their decision.
   McAtee said he considered that ``highly unlikely.''
   Charles N. Henson and other attorneys advising the Topeka Board
of Education will meet with school district officials and board
members Monday to outline their best interpretation of what the
withdrawing of the June decision means.
   The case dates to 1951 when the father of Linda Brown, and other
plaintiffs, sued alleging racial segregation in Topeka's schools.
Linda, then 6, could not attend a neighborhood school because it
was for white children only. She attended an elementary school for
black children nearly a mile away.
   Three years later, the Supreme Court struck down the concept of
``separate but equal'' schools for blacks and whites in the United
States.
   In 1979, plaintiffs represented by Jones and other lawyers asked
that the case be reopened to see if the Topeka Board of Education
had lived up to the Supreme Court's mandate to integrate its
schools.
   After seven years of discovery and a month-long trial in October
1986, a judge ruled in April 1987 that remaining racial imbalances
in Topeka's schools are the result of housing patterns and not the
result of decisions by the school board. He also said evidence
showed children attending schools with higher percentages of
minorities did not receive an inferior education.
   The plaintiffs appealed that ruling to the 10th Circuit, which
heard arguments in October 1987 and did not issue a ruling until
last month.
   Jones noted that recent U.S. Supreme Court opinions frequently
contain a ``dialogue'' between the majority and minority, and said
judges McKay and Seymour may want to respond to what Baldock had to
say.
   When the majority of the three-judge 10th Circuit panel issued
its ruling, it didn't wait for Baldock's dissent to be included.

   The Cabinet on Sunday reaffirmed Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's plan for Palestinian elections, rejecting
conditions that hard-liners tried to attach to it and defusing a
crisis that threatened the coalition government.
   During the Cabinet session, about 1 million Israeli workers
staged a two-hour strike to protest growing unemployment. About
2,000 workers demonstrated outside Shamir's office.
   In the occupied West Bank, police reported an Israeli taxi
driver was stabbed three times by two Palestinian passengers who
fled on foot. Spokesman Shalom Ben Hemo said police were
investigating if the crime was tied to the uprising.
   Ten Palestinians were wounded in clashes with the army in the
occupied lands, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed
two Palestinians were shot in the West Bank and said it was
investigating the other reports.
   The PLO-backed underground leaders of the uprising issued a
leaflet Sunday that called for an escalation of the revolt and
again dismissed the Shamir plan as an effort to ``gain more time
and more opportunities to assassinate'' the revolt.
   The Cabinet vote was worked out as a compromise with Vice
Premier Shimon Peres, head of the left-leaning Labor Party, which
had threatened to withdraw from the Likud-led coalition Cabinet
over the proposed amendments.
   They included postponing the elections until the 19-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip ends.
   The Cabinet, which first approved the plan in May, voted 21-4
with one abstention to approve it without the conditions pushed by
Industry Minister Ariel Sharon of Likud and other party hard-liners.
   Sharon joined two other Likud members in voting against the
compromise. Another dissenter was Science Minister Ezer Weizman of
Labor, who criticized the plan for not urging peace talks between
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Emerging from the four-hour Cabinet session, Peres said the
decision was something ``we can live with.''
   ``If the peace initiative is the only guiding line of the
government, we shall stay in the government,'' Peres told
reporters. ``Today we clarified there is just one guideline.''
   Labor's threat to topple Israel's 8-month-old government came on
July 12, a week after the hard-line demands were tacked onto the
peace plan at a Likud Central Committee meeting.
   The Israeli peace plan, first approved by the Cabinet on May 14,
calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to elect representatives to negotiate with Israel on limited
self-rule in the territories.
   It calls for later negotiations on the final status of the
occupied territories.
   The Likud on July 5 voted to delay any elections until the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the territories has
ended. It also said the 140,000 Palestinians in east Jerusalem
should be excluded from the vote. Israel annexed east Jerusalem as
part of its capital after its capture from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East War.
   The hard-line conditions prompted denunciations by the PLO and
criticism from the United States, which has been trying to persuade
the Palestinians to accept the election plan.
   Sunday's statement made no reference to those conditions. It
said:
   ``The peace initiative as approved by the government on May 14
and brought before Parliament is hereby approved, stands as it is,
and is valid and exists without any changes or amendments.
   ``The government continues to operate and will operate in
accordance with the peace initiative which obligates the members of
government as it was accepted.''
   Israel radio reported Weizman, a former defense minister, told
Sunday's closed-door session that he rejected the Shamir plan
because ``if we want peace, we have to talk to the PLO.''
   Israel refuses to talk to the PLO.
   The Cabinet also voted Sunday to add $75 million to the defense
budget for battling the uprising.
   At least 518 Palestinians have been killed as a result of
Israeli actions in the uprising, and another 83 have been slain by
Palestinians who accused them of collaborating with Israel.
Thirty-seven Israelis have died in the revolt.

   The Bush administration is short some
personnel because it has bowed to intimidation from
``ultra-conservatives and single-interest groups'' on appointments,
an Oklahoma official complained Sunday.
   Robert Fulton, Oklahoma's secretary of social services, said
pressure from the National Right to Life Committee cost him a
sub-Cabinet post for which he was recruited by Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Fulton blamed a triangle of conservatives in outside groups,
Congress and the White House for blocking his selection and that of
other mainstream Republicans with solid government credentials.
   Fulton, writing in the ``Outlook'' section of The Washington
Post, laid some of the blame at President Bush's door, citing his
``lack of personal involvement in dealing with sub-cabinet
appointments.''
   Bush has left them to ``the mercies of White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu,'' said Fulton.
   ``Sununu, himself far to the right of the Republican mainstream,
has created a substantial network of right-wing `transition' staff
and other insiders whose life blood is politics rather than
government,'' the Oklahoma official charged.
   ``Having little appreciation of the difficult challenge of
running government, they believe appointments should provide
political rewards and always be made with an eye to the next
election,'' said Fulton.
   Bush never formally nominated Fulton as assistant secretary of
HHS for the Family Support Administration, the top federal welfare
post.
   Fulton said he was unable to overcome opposition from the Right
To Life Committee and several conservative senators, who blamed him
for allowing children born with spina bifida to be denied care at
the Children's Hospital of Oklahoma.
   Fulton denied the charges, saying he was working in Washington
when the alleged denials of care took place in 1977-82, and that he
took prompt action after becoming Oklahoma's director of human
services in 1983 ``to enhance protections for children with
disabilities.''
   He said Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire, was
reluctant to send nominations to the Senate for confirmation ``if
there is apt to be vigorous opposition by a single Republican
senator.''
   Several conservative GOP lawmakers, including Sens. Jesse Helms
of North Carolina and Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, objected to
Fulton, according to his account.
   On June 1, Sullivan, the HHS secretary, ``called to say he had
concluded that we were `at the end of the rope,''' and Fulton
agreed to drop his candidacy.
   ``Jettisoning my nomination was a small price for the White
House to pay in keeping peace with some of the extremists who are,
for the moment, in the president's corner,'' Fulton said.
   He said Sullivan has also had his choice to run the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, Drew E. Altman, a New Jersey official, blocked,
and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh had to abandon his choice
for the No. 2 job in the Justice Department, New York attorney
Richard B. Fiske Jr.
   ``More than six months into the Bush administration, dozens of
key jobs still are not filled,'' said Fulton.
   ``The Bush administration is being intimidated by
ultra-conservatives and single-issue pressure groups,'' Fulton said.
   Their ``de facto vetoes ... are depriving the Bush
administration of people who can help it effectively run the
federal government,'' he said.
   At the White House, spokesman Steven Hart declined comment on
Fulton's allegations except to say: ``We choose the nominees who
are the right people for the job in our judgment. The names go
forward accordingly.''

   More than 100 Jewish students from
Western Europe demonstrated outside a Roman Catholic convent at the
edge of Auschwitz on Sunday and exchanged bitter words with several
hundred Poles.
   It was the second weekend of protests at the Carmelite convent,
but there was no repeat of the July 14 incident in which an
American rabbi and six students were dragged away by convent
construction workers after occupying the grounds for five hours.
   Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Authority Sunday issued a protest
to Poland over the presence of the cloister.
   The convent was founded in 1984 in a former Nazi warehouse a few
feet from the barbed wire fence and guard towers of the death camp,
where an estimated 4 million people _ including 2.5 million Jews _
were put to death during World War II.
   The cloister's lawn, with a 23-foot wooden cross in the middle,
is a former gravel pit where prisoners were gunned down by Nazi
executioners in 1940 and 1941.
   ``We have nothing against the Carmelites, but we are against
them praying at this place,'' said Borem Laurent, a Brussels
resident and chairman of the Union of Jewish students of Belgium.
   The group also included students from Holland, Switzerland and
England.
   The 107 demonstrators, organized by the European Union of Jewish
Students, sat for 20 minutes about 15 feet outside the convent gate.
   Several hundred area residents, including couples with children,
stood nearby, saying they came to ``defend'' the convent.
   ``It is as though really they don't want to understand,''
Bernard Suchecky said of the Poles watching the protest. ``I don't
understand the obstinacy of marking every square inch with a
cross.''
   Yitzhak Arad of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Authority said in
Jerusalem: ``The event in which Jews were attacked at the Auschwitz
camp could have been avoided if the church authorities concerned
with the matter fulfilled their promise in time.''
   Arad, in a cable to Wladyslaw Loranc, Poland's minister of
religious affairs, appealed for a ``speedy transfer of the convent
from the Auschwitz extermination camp in order to avoid such
sorrowful cases in which either side is not interested.''
   An agreement signed in Geneva in 1987 set a Feb. 22 deadline for
moving the nuns to a planned interfaith center away from the death
camp. The deadline passed, and construction on the new interfaith
center had not started.
   On Friday, the state-run Polish news agency reported that land
nearly 2,000 feet from the Auschwitz fence was purchased for the
center this month and that construction will begin next year.
   ``The nuns don't pray just for Poles here, they pray for all
people who perished here,'' one member of the spectating crowd told
the demonstrators.
   Another yelled out, ``They'll demand that the pope be removed
too before long!''
   When the students left, the nuns unlocked their gate to let out
several people. As a nun approached the fence, a woman outside told
her: ``Just call us again if someone else bothers you and we will
come back to defend you.''
   The nun would not answer reporters' questions.

   More than a year before the next
election, national Democrats looked Sunday in the Granite State for
a way to crack the Republican lock on the state's congressional
delegation.
   ``We'd love to have a toehold up here,'' said Rep. Beryl
Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
   New Hampshire is the only New England state without a Democrat
in Congress. Both of New Hampshire's House members and both its
senators are Republicans. The last Democratic congressman, Norman
D'Amours, lost in the Reagan landslide of 1984.
   Now, the man who beat D'Amours, Republican Rep. Robert Smith, is
running for the Senate to replace the retiring Sen. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H. The prospect of an open-seat race in 1990 has
given Democrats hope where there was none.
   ``We'll target no more than 20 races. This is one on that
list,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., who is heading up the
Democratic House candidate recruiting effort.
   George Bruno, the former state Democratic Party chairman who is
looking at the race himself, assured the delegation from Washington
that ``this is a winnable seat.''
   He made that assessment even though John Sununu, the former New
Hampshire governor who is now President Bush's chief of staff, is
expected to make a major effort on behalf of the GOP.
   Since Sununu's departure, the state's economy has gone soft, and
along with it the tax revenue base _ forcing the GOP-controlled
state house to raise a variety of fees and levies this year.
   But he urged the national leaders to help local Democrats unite
and avoid a bloody primary fight.
   ``If all of us go at it... I don't think the seat is winnable,''
he said.
   But a primary appears nearly certain, and while the national
organization can provide up to $50,000 in direct and indirect help,
it can't force local candidates to unite behind one.
   Anthony and Synar met with four potential candidates in the
congressional district, and two of them _ ideological opponents _
said they almost certainly were in the race.
   Attorney Joe Keefe, a mainstream Democrat who ran against Smith
in last year's election and was beaten by about 60 percent to 40
percent, plans to run again. He did 4 points better than Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis did in New Hampshire, and
says he can win without that drag on the top of the ticket.
   State Sen. Robert Stephen, a former state Golden Gloves champion
and owner of two ``Bobby's Lamb on the Run'' restaurants in
Manchester, says he has the conservative credentials the state's
voters demand, with a strong anti-tax record.
   Stephen has already formed an exploratory committee for the race
and is raising money.``I know I can win this,'' he told the
congressmen.
   Also considering entering the primary _ which is more than a
year away _ is stockbroker Jim Demers. He ran for the seat in 1986
and received 44 percent of the vote against Smith.
   Anthony and Synar also met with candidates in Rhode Island and
from Vermont on their first recruiting trip for the 1990 elections.

<HEAD>Kohl: Kremlin Seriously Discussing Creation of Ethnic German Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Sunday the
Kremlin is considering establishing an ethnic German settlement in
the Soviet Union to attract foreign investment.
   ``There are intensive talks going on in the Soviet party
leadership, in the Politburo and in the government over whether
settlements for minorities _ and the ethnic Germans are an
important minority there _ should be set up,'' Kohl said in a radio
interview.
   The Bonn-based Die Welt newspaper reported in its weekend
edition that Soviet officials are engaged in ``discrete talks with
Western experts about the possibility of setting up free trade
zones'' around Leningrad, in the Baltic area near Kaliningrad and
in Siberia.
   Die Welt said West Germany was especially interested in the
proposal for an ethnic German settlement in the Kaliningrad region,
a pocket of about 6,000 square miles of the Russian republic,
wedged between Poland and Soviet Lithuania.
   The port city of Kaliningrad was known as Koenigsberg before it
came under Soviet control after World War II. It is a closed
region, presumably because it contains strategic naval bases.
   Now mainly populated by ethnic Russians, Kaliningrad was once a
center of commerce for Germany's eastern territories before the war.
   Large groups of Germans live in the Central Asian republic of
Kazakhstan, where they were forcibly relocated from the Volga
region and Bessarabia by the late Josef Stalin before and during
the war.
   Kohl, in the interview with Deutschlandfunk radio, stopped short
of saying the talks centered on the creation of an ``autonomous
region'' for ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union. ``But they are
going in this direction,'' he said.
   Die Welt said such a settlement in the Kaliningrad region could
lure ``West German and American companies to create joint ventures
and give a new home to displaced German minorities.''
   Kohl said about 2 million ethnic Germans live in the Soviet
Union.
   ``The majority of them want to remain in the Soviet Union,''
Kohl said. ``But they also want to retain their identity as ethnic
Germans ... and hope that an ethnic German territory or republic
can again be set up there.''
   Kohl said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev expressed a
``positive interest and favorable evaluation of such a
development'' during his visit to Bonn in June.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov hinted
during the visit that one proposal called for establishing an
ethnic German region in Kaliningrad but said it was ``one of
several ideas.''
   The establishment of such a region would serve the dual purpose
of boosting West German-Soviet business ties and stemming the flow
of ethnic Germans to West Germany.
   As the Kremlin has relaxed restrictions on the emigration of
those of German ancestry, tens of thousands of ethnic Germans have
left their Soviet homes to resettle in West Germany.
   West Germany's constitution recognizes a right by all people of
German nationality to return to their homeland, and massive outlays
for housing, language instruction and work training have been
required to help the Soviet Germans resettle.
   About 50,000 Soviet Germans arrived in West Germany in 1988
alone.

   An American Airlines jet with 248 people aboard ran
into unexpected turbulence that threw passengers against the cabin
ceiling, sending 45 people to the hospital, officials said Sunday.
   ``I bounced off the ceiling twice. It scared the heck out of
me,'' passenger Bob Watson, 39, of Jensen Beach, Fla., said after
the accident Saturday night on the A-300 Airbus.
   Most of those injured suffered neck and shoulder sprains, said
airline spokesman John Hotard. There were no broken bones.
   The ride became rough with 40 minutes left in the three-hour
flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, as the aircraft descended for a
landing at Miami International Airport.
   The turbulence at 35,000 feet ``threw the aircraft up and then
down,'' Hotard said in a telephone interview from American's
headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.
   Seat-belt lights weren't on, Watson said in an interview at the
airport. Watson said the pilot told passengers the storm was
unexpected.
   The pilot's radar was clear and showed no thunderstorms, Hotard
said.
   Flight 1077, carrying 239 passengers and a crew of nine, landed
at about 11 p.m. Saturday. Medical personnel and equipment met the
plane, and several passengers were removed in wheelchairs and
stretchers.
   Four flight attendants and 41 passengers were taken to
hospitals, Hotard said. Several were kept overnight for treatment
and released in the morning.
   The plane sustained no exterior damage, but 12 seats were
damaged and holes were punched in the cabin's overhead compartment,
the spokesman said.
   Passenger Antonio Gallardo, 40, said his thoughts flashed to the
deadly crash Wednesday of United Airlines Flight 232 in Sioux City,
Iowa.
   People ``were praying,'' he said. ``There were many hysterical
people.''

would have this conversation.''
   ``They used to tell us that foreign corresondents wanted to come
here to mark our factories on their maps so they could drop nuclear
bombs on them,'' said Vyacheslav G. Akulov.
   ``Now you come here to cover our strike.''
   Akulov, 38, one of 26 members of the Strike Committee in the
Kuznetsk Coal Basin of western Siberia, is amazed at the changes
taking place in his country.
   Like other strike leaders interviewed Thursday and Friday in
Prokopyevsk, he expressed more hope than anger in explaining the
miners' demands, and he radiated confidence at government
concessions that sent the miners back to work on Friday.
   Hundreds of thousands of miners elsewhere in the country remain
on strike in the largest industrial job action in the Soviet Union
in 60 years.
   The miners, like nearly everyone else in the Soviet Union, have
been watching nationally televised sessions of the new Congress of
People's Deputies, which met in May and June, and the reconstituted
Supreme Soviet, the standing parliament.
   The lawmakers have inspired the nation with step after
unprecedented step, rejecting Cabinet nominees and criticizing the
armed Forces, the KGB and other former sacred cows of Soviet
communism.
   On July 11, coal miners in Mezhdurechensk, near Prokopyevsk and
1,200 miles east of Moscow, decided it was their turn to speak out
and began a strike that at its height involved half the nation's 1
million coal miners and stretched from the Arctic to Central Asia
and the Ukraine.
   The miners want better benefits and higher wages so they can buy
Western-style goods; they also want the right to strike and more
representative trade unions.
   Among the lawmakers that Akulov admires most is Andrei D.
Sakharov, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who was sent into external
exile in 1980 for his dissident views but who has since been
rehabilitated.
   ``Before, we were told that Sakharov was anti-Soviet. And we
believed them. Now we find out that he was the conscience of the
nation, one of the few people who had the courage to stand up and
speak the truth when it was dangerous. That's what we all need to
do now,'' said Akulov.
   Akulov, from the city of Anzhero-Sudzhensk at the northern end
of the Kuznetz Basin or Kuzbass, is an engineer who installs steel
supports in the deep mines of the region. He has the sinewy arms
and gaunt face of many Siberian miners.
   Akulov, who has rarely left the Kuznetz Basin and never before
met a Westerner, says he has no trouble envisioning the demise of
the one-party Communist system and the development of several
parties contending for popular support.
   ``That's like you have in the United States, isn't it? Several
parties present their ideas in the legislature, debate them and
find a compromise. That how it should be. That's what we need,'' he
said, bringing his fists together.
   Akulov grinned, showing several gold teeth.
   ``If I had said these things even five years ago, I would have
been asking for a trip even deeper into Siberia,'' he said. ``But
it's good that we're tearing down the Iron Curtain and now can
learn what goes on abroad.''
   Besides their demands for higher living standards and political
reforms, the miners want a greater voice in managing their industry
_ a demand they won in the agreement that sent them back to work on
Friday.
   Coal mines in the Kuzbass will remain under the Coal Mining
Industry, but starting Jan. 1 they may form regional associations
with the right to market coal they produce above and beyond the
government quota.
   The miners hope to eliminate the state quota ``step by step,''
said Akulov, and to achieve what the Soviets call regional economic
autonomy.
   ``It is hard to say exactly where this idea came from, but it
was not born all at once,'' he said. ``It had been building for a
long time.''
   Government leaders say the idea needs to be worked out by the
legislature, but the fact they have agreed to it at all marks a
major step in the decentralization of economic decision-making
power, which has been concentrated in Moscow since the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution.

<HEAD>Angolan Government Accepts Mobutu's Cease-fire Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government accepted proposals by
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire for monitoring a cease-fire in
Angola's 14-year-old civil war, according to an official statement
Sunday.
   But U.S.-backed guerrillas Saturday requested a week's break in
peace talks to consult with the leaders of the rebel group, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   Mobutu is mediating the negotiations in the Zairean capital of
Kinshasa.
   The Angolan government did not release details of his proposals
but the Zairean leader said last week they included installing a
radio link between Luanda, Kinshasa and the guerrillas' southeast
Angolan bush headquarters of Jamba.
   Angolan armed forces chief Antonio dos Santos Franca, who headed
the government delegation, was quoted by Angola's government media
as saying rebel negotiators agreed to some of Mobutu's proposals
but wanted to discuss others.
   The talks, which began Wednesday, are scheduled to resume on
July 31.
   They marked the second time the two sides have met since rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
sealed a truce with an historic handshake at a June 22 summit of 18
African leaders in Mobutu's ancestral village of Gbadolite.
   Under the Gbadolite agreement, a cease-fire began June 24 and
both sides agreed to create a joint commission, mediated by Mobutu,
to work toward peace.
   Dos Santos withdrew his delegation from the first round of talks
on July 1, saying the rebels had violated the cease-fire. The
Angolan state news agency continued to report guerrilla attacks as
negotiations ended Saturday.
   The rebels have made counter charges of government truce
violations.
   However, sources close to the government said in Luanda Sunday
the talks were developing ``normally.''
   ``It's necessary first of all to consolidate the cease-fire and
later we can go on to discuss political questions. ... You can't
have negotiations on peace if the war continues,'' dos Santos
Franca was reported as saying.
   Since the Gbadolite meeting, there has been confusion over just
what the Angolan government and rebels agreed to in the accord.
   The government claims Savimbi pledged to leave the country
temporarily while members of his movement are integrated into
society.
   Savimbi has denied he agreed to exile, however. Rebel spokesmen
have rejected integration, calling instead for the formation of a
transitional government comprised of members of both sides to
prepare for general elections.
   The guerrillas have fought to share control since the Marxist
government took power shortly after Angola's independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   Formerly the rebels' biggest backer, South Africa pledged to
halt aid to Savimbi in a U.S.-sponsored agreement signed with Cuba
and Angola in New York in December. The United States continues to
send the rebels about $15 million a year.
   Under the New York accord, Cuba has begun withdrawing its 50,000
troops helping the Angolan government.

   Fax machines can be fun, particularly
when a newspaper receives a governor's private memo instead of the
press release it's supposed to get.
   Gov. Guy Hunt's press secretary, Terry Abbott, last week
inadvertently sent The Birmingham News a memo addressed to Hunt
instead of an intended news release via a fax machine.
   ``I've noticed that you've been saying that last week was the
best single week in the history of the state for economic
development and that Nichii is the largest grocery store chain in
the world,'' the memo said.
   ``Last week was one of the best weeks, but we can't claim the
best because the GE announcement in 1981 was $1.5 billion all by
itself. You probably should just stick to saying what you said last
week at the news conference, that it was one of the best weeks in
history.
   ``As you said in your original statement that day on the steps
of the Mansion, Nichii is one of the largest grocery store chains
in the world, not the largest.''
   Abbott, who the newspaper said was obviously embarrassed, called
The News and explained the error in transmission. Destroy the memo,
he said.
   ``We shall _ eventually,'' the newspaper replied in a story
published Sunday.

   A county planner who initially feared
thieves had stolen a beach now believes the sand was washed away by
the Columbia River _ during lunch.
   Kim Jacobsen said Thursday that the gleaming white beach west of
The Dalles was missing. The Wasco County planner said ``scoop
marks'' on the riverbank led her to believe someone with a barge
and bulldozer had taken the beach.
   But a biologist said Friday that he watched the beach disappear
during lunch on Monday.
   Kevin Schacher and two other biologist aides for the Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife were tagging sturgeon on the
Columbia River when they decided to take a lunch break at Squally
Point beach.
   As they finished their sandwiches, the three men heard a strange
bubbling sound and walked toward the river's edge.
   ``Cracks started appearing in the beach, maybe a foot apart,''
Schacher said. ``Then a piece cracked and fell into the water, then
another and another. The cracks started coming farther apart.''
   As the trio watched, a powerful whirlpool pulled more and more
of the sand into the river.
   A surge of water as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers raised and
lowered water levels in the pool behind Bonneville Dam probably
undercut the bank and caused the sand to slough away, Jacobsen said.
   ``It seems less of a mystery now,'' she said after hearing
Schacher's tale.

   They're at it again in Bruno a year after 328
volunteers attracted international attention by lifting a 9-ton,
two-story barn by hand and carrying it more than 143 feet to a new
location.
   Herman Ostry, the original lift planner, and his friends want to
do it again next Sunday, although this lift will be less strenuous.
   The barn still weighs 9 tons and still rises two stories off the
Butler County countryside, but the carrying and twisting won't be
needed this time.
   ``We need an additional eight inches of cement blocks under it,
so we'll be lifting it about 10 inches,'' Ostry said.
   Last year's feat was the highlight of the centennial celebration
for this village of 150 residents about 65 miles west of Omaha.
More than 3,500 people overflowed the village to watch 328
volunteers move the massive 60-year-old barn.
   Although this year's lift is functional, it's also ceremonial _
occurring on the first anniversary of THE Lift.

   William T. Whisner Jr., who shot down 24
enemy airplanes during World War II and the Korean War and was one
of the Air Force's first two-war aces, died from complications of
an insect sting. He was 65.
   Whisner, a retired colonel who held three Distinguished Service
Crosses and other medals, died Friday.
   ``We thought it was ironic that a yellow jacket got him,''
Whisner's younger sister, Gloria Whisner Pierpont, said Saturday.
   A 30-year Air Force pilot, Whisner was credited with destroying
15{ German planes in the air and three on the ground in World War
II. He was credited with shooting down five German planes during
one fight and four in another.
   He shot down 5{ MIGs in Korea, becoming one of the first two-war
aces, and also served in Vietnam.
   A flier becomes an ace by shooting down five enemy aircraft. A
half-credit is awarded when two pilots share a kill.
   Whisner, who was born in Shreveport, was in the study of his
Pineville home when he was stung on the cheek Monday, said his
wife, Jaquetta. He died at nearby Rapides General Hospital.
   Whisner's body will be cremated Monday and his ashes scattered
from the air over the Gulf of Mexico off Florida, Mrs. Whisner said.

<HEAD>New Communist Party Leader Issues Essay on Discipline</HEAD>

   The new head of China's Communist Party put his
stamp of leadership on the governing party with the release Sunday
of an essay on discipline.
   Jiang Zemin takes a hard line on fighting corruption and
enforcing obedience to central leadership _ both issues that senior
party leaders have accused his predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, of
neglecting. Zhao was ousted as party leader last month after troops
crushed the pro-democracy movement led by university students.
   Jiang's essay was printed in full in the magazine Party Building
and summarized in leading newspapers Sunday.
   ``We must sternly observe unified party discipline, namely: The
individual obeys the group, the minority obeys the majority, the
lower levels obey the upper levels, the whole party obeys the
center,'' Jiang says.
   ``We cannot allow the unchecked spread of individualism,
separatism and money worship.''
   The People's Daily said the essay was written in May. The
crackdown on dissent began June 3-4 when troops fired on unarmed
demonstrators and drove them from Beijing's Tiananmen Square. The
government says about 200 people were killed; Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence reports say as many as 3,000 died.
   It was the second essay by Jiang to be widely disseminated in
recent weeks. In the first Jiang wrote about the ``dangers'' of
allowing businessmen to get too rich from private enterprise.
   In the essay published Sunday Jiang said, ``Today many peoples'
thinking is lively, and they dare to express various views, which
of course is a good thing.
   ``But we party members must ponder deeply new ideological trends
and public opinion and keep clear heads.''
   He made no reference to ``bourgeois liberalism,'' or
Western-style liberal thinking, which party leaders blame for the
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   There were these other developments:
   _ The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that explosives were
set off in mid-July in a post office on Hainan island but said it
was not known if the blast was linked to the political turmoil.
   The BBC attributed its report to a Hainan radio broadcast that
said investigators reported nitroglycerin exploded in the post
office. It gave no further details.
   Several explosions have been reported on trains since the
student-led protests were crushed. The worst occurred June 26 when
dynamite exploded on a Shanghai-bound train killing 24 people.
   _ An official report in the China Daily said China plans to
apply for $500 million in new loans from the World Bank this year
or early next year.
   The report did not mention that the World Bank has postponed
considering an earlier application by China for loans totaling
$780.2 million. According to the newspaper report China wants the
new loans for agricultural projects and road construction in
western China.
   _ A Chinese dissident living in exile in France said China is
neither a republic nor a government of the people but an empire
with top leader Deng Xiaoping the emperor.
   Yan Jiaqi, in an article published Sunday in the Chinese
language newspaper Ming Pao in Hong Kong, said, ``A republic does
not allow anybody to be the king in real or in name. It does not
allow lifelong centralization of supreme power. But Deng Xiaoping
is actually China's latest emperor.''
   Yan, a professor, led a union of intellectuals during the
student uprising this spring. He was on the government's wanted
list of ``counterrevolutionary rebels'' and he and his wife fled to
Hong Kong in late June.
   In the article Yan said, ``The June 4 massacre completely
exposed Deng's real self which had been carefully hidden for so
many years. Facing the whole country's anger, he did not give up
his power. The public demanded him to retire and step down; he used
tanks, armored personnel carriers and machine guns to suppress
these armless people.''

<HEAD>Indiana Rancher Accused Of Drug Trafficking Is Missing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Indiana rancher accused of links
to drug trafficking and the Iran-Contra scandal is missing and may
have been kidnapped, one of his lawyers said Sunday.
   Carlos Jimenez, a spokesman at the Public Security Ministry,
said Costa Rican authorities had lost sight of rancher John Hull
since Thursday. He refused to say whether Hull had left the country.
   ``I suspect that Mr. Hull has been kidnapped,'' said Juan Jose
Sobrado, Hull's lawyer.
   ``Something similar occurred in 1982, when Hector Frances was
kidnapped by a leftist commando with links to (Nicaragua's)
Sandinista regime,'' Sobrado said. He referred to an Argentine
citizen who allegedly worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Hull, 69, from Evansville, Ind., has lived in Costa Rica for the
past 20 years, and became a naturalized citizen seven years ago. He
lives on a ranch in the northern part of the country, near the
Nicaraguan border.
   Hull has been indicted in Costa Rica on charges of drug
trafficking and violating state security, but no trial date has
been set. He pleaded innocent and was released on $37,500 bail
after his doctors said he had suffered a heart attack.
   A Costa Rican congressional commission on Thursday recommended
that Hull be stripped of his citizenship and expelled from the
country.
   According to the commission, planes secretly landed at Hull's
hillside ranch to smuggle weapons from 1984 to 1985 to
U.S.-supported Contra rebels fighting in southern Nicaragua.
   The planes also allegedly ferried drugs out of the country to be
sold in the United States to pay for the weapons.
   The commission also recommended that former National Security
Adviser John Poindexter, former former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North, former Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, and Lewis
Tambs, a former ambassador to Costa Rica, be barred from ever
entering Costa Rica.
   North, a security aide, was a leader in a covert effort to aid
the Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas fighting the leftist Sandinista
government in Managua at a time when such aid had been prohibited
by the U.S. Congress.He and other American officials visited Costa
Rica to give Hull and the Contras instructions.
   A person who answered the telephone Sunday at Hull's Muelle San
Jose ranch, 100 miles north of the capital, said: ``We have no
comment ... Mr. Hull is not at the ranch.''
   Margarita Acosta, his Costa Rican wife, also said she did not
know where Hull was.
   ``I have not heard from my husband since Tuesday, although he
called to tell me he is fine. But he did not tell me where he
was,'' Mrs. Hull told the newspaper La Nacion in an interview
published Sunday.
   Mrs. Hull said she called her husband's relatives in Evansville,
``but they told me they have not heard from him.''

<TEXT>
   Voters cast ballots Sunday in the first
primary elections ever held by the ruling Nationalist Party as part
of the government's program of democratic reforms.
   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party also held primaries
to select candidates for national and local elections in December.
   Many members of the Nationalist Party had objected to the
previous system of party leaders selecting candidates for national
elections.
   There were long lines of voters at many of the nation's 1,534
polling stations, which opened at 8 a.m. and closed at 6 p.m.
Officials estimated that 50 percent of the eligible voters
participated.
   Results were expected to be announced Monday.
   About 1.98 million Nationalists and the 20,000 members of the
Democratic Progressive Party were eligible to vote in the
primaries. Taiwan's population is estimated at 20 million.
   The Democratic Progressive party was formed three years ago in
defiance of martial law and was technically illegal until earlier
this year when it registered with the Interior Ministry.
   During the primary campaign critics claimed Nationalist Party
leaders have a list of preferred candidates who will be nominated
regardless of the results of the primary balloting.
   There were 662 Nationalist members registered to run in the
primaries for national legislative seats, provincial assembly posts
and county and city offices.
   The Democratic Progressives chose among 52 candidates for 48
offices. They did not run in many districts for the 101 seats in
the Legislative Yuan that are at stake in the Dec. 2 election. The
Yuan is Taiwan's highest lawmaking body.
   In the Nationalist primary candidates who win 50 percent or more
of the vote in individual consituencies will not be guaranteed a
place on the December ballot. Instead they will be listed as
``important references'' in the preliminary stage of the campaign,
thus allowing party elders to maintain some control over the choice
of candidates.
   Candidates who win a majority of the votes in the Democratic
Progressive primaries will be assured of a spot on the party's
ticket.

   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell from the Midwest to the
East Coast on Sunday, threatening flash floods in rain-soaked
Oklahoma and dropping hail and heavy rain on Indiana.
   Low-temperature records up to 74 years old were broken or tied
in three Texas cities and one Nebraska community.
   Fair weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies in New England, from Michigan to Minnesota, and west of the
Rockies.
   Thunderstorms on Saturday night dumped up to 6 inches of rain on
sections of central Oklahoma. The heavy rain and Sunday's storms
prompted a flash flood watch for the central third of the state.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell from the lower Missouri
Valley and the southern High Plains to the southern and middle
Atlantic Coast, with showers and thunderstorms most numerous along
the central Gulf Coast, and from Florida to South Carolina.
   In central Indiana, thunderstorms brought locally heavy rain to
the Indianapolis area, including a storm that unloaded 1 1-3 inches
in 45 minutes. Quarter-inch hail fell in Noblesville.
   Heavier rainfall over six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included
more than 1{ inches at New Orleans, 1 1-3 inches at Apalachicola,
Fla., and nearly 1\ inches at Chattanooga, Tenn., and Tinker Air
Force Base in Oklahoma City.
   The temperature dropped to 68 degrees in Corpus Christi, Texas,
snapping the old record low of 71 for the date set in 1915. Records
were tied in Brownsville, Texas (68 degrees), San Antonio (67) and
North Platte, Neb. (49).
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees in Arcata, Calif., to 106 degrees in Palm Springs, Calif.
The low for the Lower 48 states Sunday morning was 41 degrees in
Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Monday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from Arizona and Utah to the southern and central
Plains and from the Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic
Coast, the upper Ohio Valley and the lower Great Lakes, with
showers and thunderstorms most numerous in northern and central
Arizona, eastern Missouri and southern Illinois and over the
central Gulf Coast states. Sunny skies will prevail over the rest
of the nation.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s across much of the
nation, the lower 90s in the southern and middle Atlantic Coast,
over 90 degrees in southern and eastern Texas and across much of
the West, with readings over 100 degrees in the Southwest; and in
the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast.

<TEXT>
   The National Organization for Women ended its
national convention here Sunday by agreeing to explore the
formation of a new political party for women.
   The convention adopted a resolution calling for a commission to
study forming a party ``dedicated to equality for women'' because
of ``the failure of both major political parties to address women's
needs.''
   NOW President Molly Yard said in an interview that the proposal
reflected the NOW membership's ``total disgust'' with the
Democratic and Republican parties.
   ``We are 52 percent of the country and we have almost no
representation,'' Ms. Yard said. ``As a whole, the majority is
voting against women all the time. We're sick of it.''
   The convention also passed a resolution called a ``Bill of
Rights for the 21st Century.''
   The resolution called for an expansion of the Bill of Rights to
include:
   _Freedom from discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual
orientation or age.
   _Freedom from government interference in abortion or birth
control, and the right of women to receive public funds for
abortions, birth control and pregnancy services.
   _The right to a safe environment, a decent standard of living
and freedom from violence.
   ``We're fighting for women's individual rights,'' Ms. Yard said.
``I feel we are in a battle.''
   The convention's delegates also passed a resolution calling for
testing and distribution of the French RU-486 abortion pill in the
United States.
   The pill has been ``heavily tested in France,'' and is ``a very
good method of abortion,'' Ms. Yard said. ``I find if outrageous
that it isn't here,'' she said.
   The delegates also passed a resolution detailing plans for NOW's
``Freedom Campaign for Women's Lives,'' a national effort by the
organization to lobby for abortion rights on both the federal and
state levels.
   The campaign's plans include:
   _A national march scheduled for Nov. 12 in Washington to protest
the U.S. Supreme Court's July 3 ruling in Webster vs. Reproductive
Health Services Inc., which gives states the power to restrict
abortions.
   _Targeting states for ballot initiatives on abortion rights, and
to introduce legislation to stop anti-abortion legislation in
states.
   _To pass federal legislation that will ensure abortion rights.
   Ms. Yard said that work on both the national and state levels on
the abortion issue is imperative for NOW.
   ``We have to do both,'' she said. ``We don't have any choice.''
   The Supreme Court's ruling in the Webster case has mobilized
young people to become involved in fighting for abortion rights,
Ms. Yard said.
   ``It's very clear that we're in a battle, but it's also clear we
have a lot of recruits,'' she said.

   The total hydraulic failure that sent
United Flight 232 out of control also caused the worst single-plane
disaster in history in 1985, but pilots still don't train for it,
says a former DC-10 flight instructor.
   ``If it had only been partial hydraulic failure, I think he
could have handled it,'' Tom Eanes said of Capt. Al C. Haynes,
pilot of the United DC-10 that crashed last week at Sioux City,
Iowa. The disaster killed 110 of the 296 people aboard.
   ``We train for that. But we don't train for what he faced
because the airplane isn't controllable,'' Eanes, a resident of
Grand Prairie, Texas, said in a telephone interview Saturday.
   ``It's incredible,'' said retired DC-10 flight engineer Joe
Sullivan of Richardson, Texas, who was also interviewed by
telephone. ``I just can't believe it was successful.''
   Eanes said Flight 232's problems were similar to the
catastrophic loss of hydraulic fluid that crippled a Japan Air
Lines Boeing 747 in 1985. In that case, hydraulic lines ruptured
after the aft pressure bulkhead blew out.
   The pilot of the JAL airplane maneuvered for 30 minutes by
varying thrust from different engines before the aircraft crashed
into a mountain, causing the worst single-plane air disaster ever
as 520 people died. Four survived.
   Jack Gamble, Boeing Commercial Airplane spokesman, pointed out a
difference between the two cases.
   ``The JAL pilot was trying to keep altitude because he was over
mountainous terrain. He was trying to turn and get back to an
airport but he was over mountainous terrain. It was quite a long
distance to the airport. In the DC-10 case, he wasn't that far from
an alternate airport.''
   ``He (JAL pilot) did succeed in turning. He was headed back
toward Tokyo when he crashed into the mountain. The problem was he
couldn't keep altitude.''
   United Flight 232's crew, aided by an off-duty pilot who rushed
to the cockpit to help, used differential engine thrust from their
remaining two wing-mounted engines to control the wide-bodied jet
after its tail-mounted engine apparently blew apart and destroyed
the plane's hydraulic system.
   With differential engine thrust, a plane will slowly turn in the
direction of the slower engine.
   Without hydraulic power, the crew could not manipulate control
surfaces on the wings and tail to alter direction, raise or lower
the nose, or extend wing slats and flaps that increase lift during
takeoffs and landings.
   Flight 232's flight engineer told National Transportation Safety
Board investigators that the loss of the plane's hydraulic fluid
was ``immediate,'' giving pilots no time adjust those control
surfaces.
   But the crew managed to guide the airplane to a crash landing at
Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, where emergency equipment and
medics were waiting. The crash killed 110 but 186 others survived,
including the flight crew.
   Eanes said the United crew faced an additional problem.
   The damaged tail section assymmetrical drag _ that is, given
equal power to both remaining engines, the plane still turned to
the right. To counter that, he said, pilots had to overcompensate
with the right wing engine.
   That made the landing attempt even more difficult, he said.
   ``There's a certain point where you have to come off the power
to get on the ground. He obviously had to carry more power in one
engine than the other to overcome asymmetrical drag,'' he said.
   Eanes, who continues to fly for a commercial airline company
that he asked not be identified, noted that without control over
the wing slats and flaps, Flight 232's crew was forced to approach
the landing at least 80 mph faster than normal so the wings
wouldn't lose lift.
   ``How they ever got down to a reasonable height to even attempt
a landing is beyond my comprehension,'' said Sullivan.

<HEAD>Record Number of Women Elected to Parliament's Upper House</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Japan-Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women made their voting power felt Sunday by
electing a record number of women to Japan's upper house of
parliament in a campaign marked by a sex scandal and a politician's
derogatory remarks about females.
   Preliminary returns showed 19 women elected to the House of
Councilors, the less powerful chamber of Japan's bicameral
legislature, far surpassing the previous record of 10 women,
according to Kyodo News Service.
   Ten of those elected were supported by the Japan Socialist
Party, led by Chairwoman Takako Doi. The party's dramatic gains
helped strip the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of its upper house
majority for the first time in 34 years.
   The Socialists fielded 12 women candidates in the election,
twice as many as in 1986. Half of the 252-member upper house is
elected every three years and elections to the more powerful lower
house are not due until July, 1990.
   A record 146 women ran in the election, up from 82 in the last
upper house election.
   Before the election, only 10 percent of upper house members were
women; the lower house has only seven women to 505 men.
   The large number of women candidates reflected what is being
called the ``Madonna phenomenon,'' or opposition parties fielding
female candidates to capitalize on women's displeasure with the
ruling party.
   Women's potential clout is enormous. Among eligible voters,
women outnumber men by 2.7 million, and they are more likely to
cast ballots.
   The female protest vote stemmed from reports that for as long as
10 years, Prime Minister Sousuke Uno paid women, including
professional geisha entertainers, to be his mistresses. Uno has not
denied the allegations, but maintains that he did nothing immoral.
   Equally damaging were comments by Agriculture Minister Hisao
Horinouchi earlier this month that ``women are useless in
politics.'' He said their primary task in life is ``to keep the
household.''
   Horinouchi further attacked the Socialist's Ms. Doi, saying she
was unfit to be prime minister because she had never married or had
children.
   He apologized for his remarks, but women seized on them to
assail the ruling party and promote opposition-backed female
candidates.
   ``The votes today proved that the people believe women have the
power to serve in parliament,'' newly elected parliamentarian
Harumi Kan said in a television interview. Ms. Kan ran with the new
labor-based Confederation Group in rural Tokushima prefecture.
   Women voters were also angered by a new 3 percent consumption
tax forced through parliament by the Liberal Democrats despite
opposition protest.
   Women, angered by the tax because they faced higher prices in
supermarkets, rallied under the slogan ``every day is tax payment
day'' in facing ruling party incumbents and challengers.
   ``Women candidates made a favorable impression with their stance
against the consumption tax and household issues,'' Yoshitomo
Sakai, secretary-general of the Socialist's election committee,
told Kyodo.
   ``The popularity of Takako Doi, who made appearances in more
than 90 places around the country, also had a big impact,'' Sakai
was quoted as saying.
   Kyodo reported that preliminary returns showed that two women
were elected each from among Liberal Democrats; Komeito, the No. 2
opposition Clean Government Party; and Rengo-no-kai, the labor
confederation. Two women who were elected ran as independents and
another ran as a communist.

   Unions that have staged a series of strikes
against the British Broadcasting Corp. said Sunday they have
accepted an improved pay offer.
   The BBC raised its offer from 7 percent to 8.8 percent. Union
negotiators, who had been demanding a 16 percent increase, said
they would recommend that their 25,000 members accept the offer.
   ``If it sticks, we are delighted for our viewers and listeners
that they will no longer be subject to the disruption of their
program schedules,'' said Roger Chase, BBC's director of personnel.
   BBC operations had been disrupted 12 times by strikes called on
short notice by the National Union of Journalists, the Broadcast
and Entertainment Trades Alliance and the Association of
Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians.

<DATELINE>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A park ranger trying to
become the first paraplegic to climb 3,500-foot El Capitan
completed a tough portion of one of the world's most challenging
rock climbs Sunday.
   Mark Wellman, 29, who was disabled in a climbing accident seven
years ago, successfully tackled the Shield Roof along with lead
climber Mike Corbett. The ledge juts 40 feet out from the granite
face of the monolith at 2,000 feet above Yosemite Valley.
   ``He made it over the Roof in grand style. He just did a super
job,'' Gwen Schneider, Corbett's girlfriend, said Sunday afternoon.
   ``They are on the headwall now,'' said Schneider, part of a
group tracking the two climbers through a telescope. ``They're
gonna sleep at the base of the Groove pitch, his second-most feared
pitch.'' A pitch is a climbing distance measured by rope length.
   The two climbers, however, were progressing more slowly than
expected and on Sunday were about two days behind schedule.
Schneider estimated Wellman and Corbett would reach the top of El
Capitan on Thursday instead of Tuesday.
   Corbett, who has a record 41 ascents of El Capitan, has been
climbing ahead of Wellman and setting up the ropes. Wellman then
pulls himself up using a T-bar device.
   Wellman was left paralyzed from the waist down when he fell 50
feet during a climb of the 13,700-foot Gables Peak south of
Yosemite in 1982. He has since been as active as possible,
directing the park's program for disabled visitors.
   Although he had climbed many peaks before his accident, Wellman
had never tackled El Capitan, considered a difficult ascent for
fully able-bodied climbers. He estimated beforehand that the climb
would require about 7,000 pullups.
   Wellman trained for his first El Capitan climb with 35 practice
climbs on other sheer rocks and weight training, Schneider said. He
also spent 100 hours making his rock chaps, special pants to
protect his legs.

<TEXT>
   Three bombs exploded late Sunday
in three communities near Cape Town, killing two men and causing
damage at a courthouse and police station, authorities said.
   Another bomb was defused outside a courthouse in a fourth town
in the area, said Cape Town police spokesman Lt. Attie Laubscher.
   There was no claim of responsibility and police declined comment
on possible suspects.
   Many previous bombings of government buildings have been blamed
on guerrillas of the outlawed African National Congress. The ANC
has been waging a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 to
undermine the white-controlled government.
   Laubscher said two men, both blacks, were killed when a bomb
exploded at 9:12 p.m. in a public lavatory across the street from a
magistrate's court in Athlone, a segregated township for people of
mixed race on the outskirts of Cape Town.
   About 40 minutes later there was an explosion at a police
station in nearby Mitchell's Plain, also a mixed-race township,
police said. The third explosion was near a courthouse in Somerset
West, a white community 18 miles east of Cape Town.

   About one million Israeli civil servants, bank
employees, and airport and factory workers walked off their jobs
for two hours Sunday to protest rising unemployment.
   It was the strongest job action in Israel in recent years and
reflected anger at a recession blamed in part on the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories that began in December 1987.
   The strike, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., shut down hundereds of banks
and government offices and disrupted flights at Ben-Gurion
International Airport.
   Israel's jobless rate was 9.7 percent in May, the highest since
a 1967 recession when the rate reached 12.4 percent.
   Union leaders say 140,000 workers are unemployed and that is the
greatest number of people out of work in Israel's 41-year history.
   ``We want the government to hear the screams of the workers,''
said strike organizer Eli Sofer of the Jerusalem Labor Council.
``We are fearful for the fate of our country.''
   Yisrael Kessar, secretary-general of the Histadrut Labor
Federation, said of the strike, ``We decided we didn't have any
choice but to take this action.'' The federation represents about
85 percent of Israel's work force.
   More than 2,000 strikers held a rally near Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's office as the Cabinet met Sunday to consider new
measures to create more jobs.
   The Cabinet approved a $75 million increase in defense spending
to cover costs of dealing with the Palestinian uprising, but it
made no decision on a proposal by Finance Minister Shimon Peres
that would provide $100 million to help create new jobs.
   Peres told reporters his plan calls for government investments
in public works projects, including the building of a new electric
power plant in southern Israel, and road building across the
country. The Cabinet will meet again Monday to discuss the
unemployment issue.

   A bus driver and passenger were shot to
death Sunday afternoon by a gunman who made his getaway by shooting
and critically wounding a motorist, then taking the man's car,
police said.
   The shooting happened around 1:30 p.m. in front of a busy
supermarket in downtown Hollywood, across the street from the
city's Greyhound Bus Station.
   Sidney Granger, a 43-year-old driver for the Broward County
Transit Authority, and a passenger on the transit bus were killed,
said police spokeswoman Joycelyn Alston.
   A search was under way for the gunman.
   ``We don't have a motive,'' Ms. Alston said. ``We don't
understand why this happened.''
   Using what police believed to be an automatic weapon, the gunman
boarded the bus when it stopped at a transfer station, shot the
driver and sprayed bullets into the back of the bus, hitting and
killing a passenger, Ms. Alston said. It was not immediately known
how many people were on the bus.
   A bus passenger said all appeared normal until the shots rang
out.
   ``He had a bottle of wine in his hand and I saw him get up and
get ready to get on the bus,'' said Devin Oppy. ``Other people got
on the bus and some others got off, and as soon as all that was
over the guy just raised his arm and pow, pow, pow!''
   The gunman left the bus, walked through the Publix Supermarket
parking lot and accosted the driver of a car slowing for a
stoplight, said police Lt. R.H. Banks. The man banged his gun on
the car window, ordered the driver out and shot him three times,
twice in the back, as the motorist got out, Banks said.
   As the gunman drove off, a 16-year-old service station attendant
called for help, then tried to follow the man in his car. The
teen-ager said he gave up the chase after a few blocks because the
man was driving too fast. The attendant asked that his name not be
made public.
   The wounded driver, whose name was not immediately released, was
taken to nearby Hollywood Memorial Hospital, where an administrator
said he was in critical condition.
   The gunman was described by witnesses as white, about 30 years
old, having dark hair in a pony tail and wearing a red plaid shirt
and blue jeans, Ms. Alston said.
   Investigators examined the bus and the bodies on board as
weeping relatives of the bus driver stood on a nearby sidewalk.
   Bus passenger Luc Laurent, 43, of nearby Pompano Beach said he
was dozing when the vehicle pulled into the transfer station.
   ``I woke up and heard the shots,'' said Laurent. ``I saw two
guys on the floor, and everybody was getting off.''
   After the shooting, the gunman ``didn't say anything,'' Laurent
said. He said the man didn't ask for money or anything else.
   Hollywood is a suburb north of Miami.

   A senior American diplomat suspected of
passing information to the Soviets after being recalled from
Austria first aroused U.S. suspicions more than a decade ago,
according to a close friend _ the Austrian foreign minister.
   Felix S. Bloch, the highest-ranking U.S. official ever
implicated in an espionage investigation involving the Soviet
Union, remained out of sight Sunday even as additional bits and
pieces emerged about his career _ which included a stint in East
Berlin.
   More recently, he was the No. 2 U.S. official at the U.S.
Embassy in Vienna, serving at that post at the same time as a
Marine guard subsequently convicted of espionage at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow.
   The Marine sergeant told investigators he first got involved
with Soviet spies while he was posted in Vienna.
   Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, a close friend and
college-mate of Bloch's, was quoted Sunday in a European tabloid as
saying he first heard about the recent allegations of espionage
three weeks ago through Austrian channels.
   However, he said there was ``a certain suspicion on the U.S.
side reaching back into the 1970s.''
   President Bush, returning to the White House late Sunday from a
weekend in Camp David, Md., ignored reporters' shouted questions
about the investigation.
   Neighbors told reporters that Bloch had been under obvious
surveillance by the FBI until news accounts of the spy probe aired
late Friday and he disappeared from his plush apartment _ along
with the agents who had followed him even when he walked his dog.
   ABC News reported Sunday night that Bloch was staying at a
private home north of New York City. ABC footage showed two women
identified as his wife and daughter but not of Bloch.
   The FBI declined comment Sunday. However, sources had said
earlier there were no plans to arrest Bloch over the weekend,
implying that he remained under surveillance.
   In 1985, a former CIA agent, Edward L. Howard, eluded FBI agents
and fled to the Soviet Union after being charged with selling
intelligence secrets to Soviet KGB officials in Austria.
   Because Bloch had access to sensitive intelligence material
during his seven-year posting in Austria, officials expressed
concern that he would be in a position to cause grave damage to
U.S. interests if he shared such secrets with foreign powers.
   There were no formal charges against Bloch, however, and U.S.
officials have declined in their public comments to go beyond
confirming that he is the target of an intelligence investigation
and no longer has access to the State Department building.
   The career diplomat reportedly was filmed by U.S. officials
earlier this year passing a brief case to a known Soviet KGB agent
in a European city.
   Vienna was not the only sensitive post where Bloch served. In
1974, he was economic counselor in the newly opened U.S. Embassy in
espionage-filled East Berlin, where he arrived from West Berlin.
   As events unfolded Sunday, what emerged was the vision of a
disgruntled employee who, as the former No. 2 at the embassy in
Austria, had access to a wide array of sensitive mission material
in Vienna, long considered an East-West spy crossroads. Those who
knew Bloch well ruled out spy-swaps for money or ideology.
   Mock said he was ``deeply shaken and really shattered.''
   An administration source, familiar with Bloch's career, said he
was ``shocked.''
   Sources told ABC _ which initially broke the story _ that Bloch
claimed he spied because he fell into a Soviet sex trap but that
investigators have discounted that story.
   Some sources pointed to his frustration over having been passed
over for an ambassadorship after serving under political appointees
in Austria and running the embassy in Vienna for a time.
   One of the ambassadors Bloch served was Helene von Damm, an
Austrian-born political appointee by former President Reagan who
caused a scandal in Viennese society by marrying Peter Guertler, a
hotel owner. She resigned in June 1985, citing speculation that her
marriage constituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic
duties. Bloch ran the embassy after Von Damm resigned until Ronald
S. Lauder arrived almost a year later.
   Lauder told reporters Saturday that he demanded Bloch be
recalled in July 1987 because of ``insubordination.'' The former
ambassador said he knew nothing about espionage allegations,
adding: ``If I thought he was a spy, I would have had him
arrested.''
   Officials attempted to assess the damage Bloch could have caused.
   Lauder confirmed Bloch had access to classified information,
saying: ``There is enough information that he could do severe
damage.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., a member of the Select Committee on
Intelligence, said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that he had
not been briefed on the case, but ``if a high-ranking official of
this nature was involved in spying for the Soviet Union it could be
very damaging.
   ``There's no doubt about the fact that the top people in the
State Department, the top people in our embassy, have access to
cables from around the word,'' said Nunn. ``They have knowledge
about certain CIA operations.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, interviewed Sunday on ABC's
``This Week With David Brinkley, declined to comment on the depth
of the possible breach of security, saying, ``It would be pure
speculation at this point, and I really can't get into it.''
   A Senate staffer said Sunday the FBI apparently did not have
enough evidence to arrest Bloch on criminal charges.
   In Austria, the newspaper Neue Kronen Zeitung noted that Bloch
lived well in Vienna in a villa in one of the city's poshest
districts and said he ``threw lots of parties for politicians,
artists and journalists.'' Another paper, the Kaertner
Tageszeitung, commented on the Bloch story, saying: ``Even Graham
Greene could not have dreamed of such rich material, reaching right
into the finest society circles and highest political posts of
Vienna.''
   The New York Times, meanwhile, reported Sunday that intelligence
officials are re-examining their investigation of two Marine guards
at the American Embassy in Moscow and their involvement with Soviet
agents for a possible link to the Bloch case.
   One of the Marines, Clayton Lonetree, confessed he had become
involved with Soviet intelligence at his previous posting in
Vienna. As deputy chief of mission, Bloch, according to officials,
had early knowledge of Lonetree's confession.
   Three months after Lonetree's confession was made public in
January 1987, another Marine guard, Arnold Bracy, said he and
Lonetree had allowed Soviet agents to enter the Moscow embassy's
secure areas. Bracy later retracted his statements, and charges
against him were dropped.

   President Augusto Pinochet underwent
surgery Sunday for a hernia that he said was caused by his daily
weight-lifting exercises.
   Doctors at Santiago's Military Hospital said Pinochet, 73, was
in satisfactory condition after the one-hour operation.
   Pinochet's doctor, Henry Olivi, said the general ``is doing
well, resting in his room, accompanied by his wife and children.''
   He said Pinochet would remain at the hospital for about five
days and then complete his recovery at home. Pinochet entered the
hospital Saturday for tests, Olivi said.
   Pinochet told reporters Friday that the hernia was the result of
his weight-lifting sessions and had caused him severe pain.
   He has been president since he led the military coup that ousted
the elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende in
September 1973. Pinochet also is commander of the army.

   About 1,100 Soviet sailors on leave during a
rare goodwill visit by three Soviet warships took a whirlwind tour
of Americana on Sunday, handing out autographs and enjoying
stomach-turning carnival rides.
   The sailors, accompanied by U.S. Navy chaperones, visited Busch
Gardens in Williamsburg and local stores, and selected crewmen were
taken aboard the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy for a tour.
   Meanwhile, streams of American visitors boarded the Russian
ships for tours.
   Wendy Webb, 17, of Chesapeake and a friend were corralled in a
ship passageway by about 20 young Soviets who wanted their picture
taken with the girls.
   ``This is the way to make peace, isn't it?'' Miss Webb asked.
The Soviets took turns putting their hats on her and her friend's
heads and posing for snapshots.
   ``The response of the community so far has been absolutely
phenomenal,'' Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman
said. ``I think the Soviets have been very happy with the reception
they've been given.''
   On Saturday, a Soviet song and dance troupe belted out a
rendition of the Star Spangled Banner at the close of a performance
at a waterfront park in Norfolk.
   ``When they actually started singing our national anthem ...
well, it was just overwhelming,'' said Patricia Sykes of Norfolk.
``The symbolism _ their red flag flying up there on the corner and
all, while they're singing about `the land of the free' _ well, it
was too much.''
   Groups of sailors also made stops at Colonial Williamsburg and
such American institutions as a shopping mall, a discount store and
a picnic. Some got a look at the Oceana Naval Air Station in nearby
Virginia Beach.
   Busch Gardens' stomach-twisting rides were a hit with the
sailors who visited the amusement park. The young seamen became
something of an attraction for Americans at the park, who crowded
around, asked for autographs and snapped pictures of family members
posing with Soviets.
   Dimitrie Shtaingardt of Moscow, a 20-year-old radio operator,
said he enjoyed the day, especially the people he met.
   ``They were very nice,'' he said, groping for the right words in
English. ``People very warm. I see all friends around me.''
   Myron Smythe of Pittsburgh approached the group of Soviet
sailors and spoke to them in Russian learned from his grandfather.
   ``It's beautiful,'' Smythe said later. ``Talk about
international relations, this is it right there.''
   The Soviet guided missile cruiser Marshal Ustinov, the destroyer
Otlichny and the tanker Gasanov docked Friday at the Norfolk base.
   The five-day visit is only the second by the Soviet navy to this
country since World War II. Three U.S. warships will stop in the
Soviet Black Sea port of Sevastopol next month.

<HEAD>Passengers Brawl Aboard Continental Jet</HEAD>

   Continental Airlines said Sunday an altercation
aboard one of its jets occurred after the plane touched down and
did not cause an aborted landing at Logan International Airport.
   The airline's explanation differed from an account given by the
Massachusetts State Police after interviewing the crew of Flight
358.
   Six people, including a counsel to the New Jersey Senate, his
wife and four Massachusetts residents, were arrested at Logan after
the fight.
   Steven Sacks-Wilner, 39, of Montgomery Township, N.J., and his
wife, Joanne, 37, were arrested when the flight from Trenton, N.J.,
landed at 5:30 p.m. Saturday, according to state police Cpl. Joseph
Howley.
   ``They had a little brawl,'' he said. ``It started out as a
husband and wife that were sort of running around the plane and
making demands on the crew and being a general nuisance and
hollering.''
   The fight between the couple occurred in the air, and expanded
to involve four other passengers, police said. The on-board
confusion led the pilot of the 146-passenger MD-80 aircraft to give
up on his first landing try, said Sgt. Stephen Kelley.
   ``They were fighting in the aisles just prior to touch down,''
Kelley said. ``The pilot was afraid that when the pilot reversed
throttle on his englines _ which you do not feel when you're in
your seat _ the whole troop that was fighting in the aisles would
have wound up in the cockpit.''
   Kelley said state police based their explanation on interviews
with the flight crew. He said the fight lasted 15 to 20 minutes.
   According to the airline, however, the fight began and ended
after the jet landed at Logan International Airport.
   The jet had had to bypass its first landing because a Northwest
Airlines jet was slow in taxiing out of the way, said Ned Walker, a
Continental spokesman.
   ``I have spoken with the captain who said there was a Northwest
plane on the runway that was slow to clear and resulted in his
decision to do what they call a go-around,'' Walker said.
   Michael Ciccarelli, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Boston, said Sunday that the Logan control tower
heard nothing of an on-board altercation before the landing.
   ``The airplane, making a normal approach, was given a routine
go-around because the airplane landing in front of him was slow in
clearing the runway,'' Ciccarelli said.
   The FAA has opened an investigation into the incident.
   Sacks-Wilner, the chief counsel for the Republican minority in
the New Jersey Senate, faces charges of interference with a flight
crew, disorderly conduct and three counts of assault on a police
officer, Howley said. Sacks-Wilner allegedly fought back at police
when they boarded the plane and arrested him.
   All those arrested were released from the state police lockup
pending arraignment Monday in East Boston District Court.
   Mrs. Sacks-Wilner and three Medford residents, Frank J.
Federico, 50, his wife Camella, 48, their son John, 22, all face
charges of interfering with a flight crew, as does John's
19-year-old girlfriend, Laureen Belmonte of Revere, Howley said.
   The Massachusetts passengers ``tried to assist the crew and
wound up getting in the crew's way,'' the state police corporal
said.

   Leftist Shining Path rebels shot and killed
the mayor of a highlands town and attacked a major Andean mining
complex in separate incidents, police said Sunday.
   Freddy Astete, mayor of Tambo, 140 miles east of Lima, was shot
in the head by rebels Saturday. Astete, 34, was the 51st mayor
killed in the insurgency that has torn this impoverished nation
since 1980.
   Also Saturday, rebels attacked the mining center of La Oroya,
blowing up banks, railroad tracks and an electricity generating
station, police said. They said the attack paralyzed production in
the important mining region 95 miles east of Lima, but that nobody
was hurt.
   The rebels have attacked 138 mining operations in the past four
years, leaving 24 people dead and costing the companies millions of
dollars in damages and lost production, according to government
figures.
   Losses to the mining sector since 1980, when the Shining Path
first started the attacks, amount to $500 million, according to the
government.
   The Maoist-inspired Shining Path began its insurgency near the
highland city of Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima, but the
violence has since spread throughout much of the highlands and into
the coca-growing area in the northeast jungles.
   In the past, rebels attacked the mines mainly to steal dynamite,
but recent attacks appear aimed at destroying machinery and halting
production. Peru receives most of its foreign exchange from mining
exports.

   A self-described ``environmental
swimmer'' seeking to focus attention on coastal pollution
negotiated past a watermelon carcass, a potato sack and other
debris to complete a 100-mile swim down the New Jersey coast Sunday.
   Skip Storch, 31, swam six miles from Brigantine to Atlantic City
on the final leg of a route that began Monday at Upper New York Bay
at Liberty Island in Jersey City.
   ``If I was to walk, it wouldn't make an impression,'' Storch
said after emerging from the water in front of Caesars Hotel
Casino. ``But if I swim in the water and see what happens to me _
if my skin breaks out because of the bad water, or if I get an ear
ache _ I'm going to tell the truth.''
   Storch, a gemologist from Monsey, N.Y., says he has suffered
thousands of jellyfish stings on his journey. But he says he has
encountered less pollution than he did in last year's swim.
   ``I saw a lot of the same material but not in the same
quantity,'' as last year,'' Storch said.
   His first brush with floating garbage was Saturday when he was
forced to switch from a crawl stroke to a breaststroke to dodge
plastic bags and boxes off Long Beach Island.
   On Sunday, he said he had to navigate around a watermelon, a
wooden crate and a potato sack.
   As Storch's trip got underway this week, the state had its first
widespread beach closings in Cape May County, when fecal coliform
exceeded acceptable levels and some household garbage, including
insulin-like syringes, were found.
   All beaches had been reopened by Sunday, according to the state
Department of Environmental Protection.
   ``As far as the water quality I'd give it a B,'' Storch said in
a mid-swim interview with WCBS radio. ``As far as improvement, I'd
give it a B+.''
   Last year, Storch swam 153 miles on the Hudson River from
Albany, N.Y. to the Statue of Liberty to bring attention to
clean-up of that waterway.

   Investigators used infrared cameras
Sunday to search cornfields for pieces of a shattered jet engine
from a crashed DC-10, while doctors said some survivors could take
years to recover.
   At the site of Wednesday's crash of United Airliunes Flight 232,
officials were painstakingly reassembling the jet's tail section in
hopes of determining what caused the sudden loss of hydraulic
power, loss of control and the fiery airport crash.
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board, said investigators were focusing on cornfields 60
miles from the crash scene in hopes of recovering more pieces of
the airliner's tail engine, which apparently exploded and severed
hydraulic lines.
   ``Without having the fan section, it's obviously going to take a
lot of time,'' he said. ``It's always best to get all the
wreckage.''
   Also Sunday, investigators continued to interview crew members.
   The flight engineer said that immediately after the explosion in
the No. 2 engine, the gauges indicated the immediate loss of fluid
in all three hydraulic systems, according to NTSB spokesman Jim
Burnett.
   Authorities were beginning the process of returning home the
bodies of the crash victims. According to a list compiled with
information from United, relatives and employers, 105 people were
confirmed dead and five were still listed as missing.
   A spokesman for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said more than 20
bodies had been sent home by Sunday.
   Hospital officials said 39 people remained hospitalized early
Sunday, but some were being dismissed as the day progressed.
   Lopatkiewicz said Nebraska Air National Guard jets were used to
carry infrared cameras to photograph a 16-square-mile area about 60
miles from the crash site in a search for metal fragments thrown
from the engine when it exploded.
   ``We hope those photographs will be able to detect metal that is
strewn in thick cornfields in that area,'' he said.
   Burnett said the search for pieces had been hampered because
some fell in areas where corn is up to 6 feet high.
   ``The areas of the cornfields have to be searched by ground,''
he said. ``Farmers have been asked to be alert for metal fragments.
   ``The people working the fields out there have been alerted,''
Burnett said.
   Investigators said they checked maintenance records on key
sections of the engine.
   ``There's nothing here that gives us cause for concern at this
point,'' said Burnett. ``Although I will say that previous
accidents have led to reductions in cycles. So it's not to say that
this is irrelevant.''
   The age of engine parts is expressed in cycles, which comprise
one landing and takeoff.
   Doctors were cautioning that crash victims face a long recovery,
and United officials said they were making plans to aid families of
the dead.
   ``Everybody who survived that crash is going to have a lot of
potential for problems to overcome,'' said Larry Foster, medical
director of the burn unit at St. Luke's Regional Medial Center.
   ``We're talking about many, many months of initial care and then
years of rehabilitation if the patient survives,'' he said.
   While Foster said doctors were trying to move injured victims
near their homes for lengthy therapy, some weren't willing to leave
immediately.
   ``I could leave tomorrow if I wanted to, but I really don't feel
like moving,'' said Helen Hayes, a burn victim from Denver. ``I'm
very comfortable here. I really don't feel like traveling for a
while.''
   James Guyette, a United Airlines spokesman, said the airline had
assigned specialists to families of crash victims and gave each a
separate United phone number to call with questions.
   ``We'll be maintaining positive contact with them,'' he said.
``We will assign a United representative to each family.''
   At the crash scene, while investigators pieced together the
wreckage, others gathered luggage and other personal effects,
storing it in a hangar for families to retrieve.
   ``We are taking great pains to collect everything we can,
identify them and return them,'' Guyette said.

   Rebecca Schaeffer, the young actress shot
point blank as she opened her front door, was buried Sunday in her
hometown on a breezy hilltop fragrant with flowers.
   About 250 people ringed the gravesite shaded by tall pines as
the vault was lowered into the ground at Ahavia Shalom Cemetery.
Her parents, Benson and Danna Schaeffer, then dropped shovels of
dirt into the opening.
   Schaeffer, 21, was slain Tuesday at her apartment building in
Los Angeles. A fan, who had sent her a blizzard of letters, Robert
John Bardo, was arrested in Tucson, Ariz., a day later and charged
with the murder.
   Schaeffer's burial followed a 45-minute service in the small
cemetery chapel south of downtown Portland. Rabbi Emanuel Rose
opened the service with a reading of the 23rd Psalm and then spoke
of anger and anguish.
   He told Schaeffer's parents they should not retain their anger
toward the man that gunned down their daughter.
   ``Our experience, over the long run, cannot be one of anger,''
Rose said. ``Anger gets us nowhere.''
   He said the truth of Schaeffer's death was difficult, but the
truth of her life was that she had been a very special person and
friends and family had all felt gifted with a special relationship
in knowing her.
   The light wood casket at front right side of the room was
adorned with a spray of white, blue and mauve flowers gathered with
a mauve ribbon.
   Copies of her writing, leaflets of a few white pages of thoughts
and poems tied with ribbon, were circulated among family members.
   ``I do it because it is right for me. ... Life is not a movie,''
she wrote earlier this month.
   Two friends, a young man and a young woman, stood to read lines
from her writing. The young man, Brad Silberling, broke into tears
and said he had wanted to marry Schaeffer, whom he called ``a
sparkling soul.''
   He sobbed as told the mourners, ``She always said, `I want you
to hold me so close.' Please, hold her `so close' in your hearts.''
   A second rabbi likened her writings to those of another young
woman, Anne Frank, and said both had been ``snuffed out by a
senseless society.''
   Among the mourners were Schaeffer's co-stars on her TV series,
``My Sister Sam'' _ Pam Dawber, Joel Brooks and Jenny O'Hara.
Dawber was accompanied by her husband, film actor Mark Harmon.
   Schaeffer had been appearing before cameras professionally for
more than half her life. Born in Eugene, Ore., she began modeling
in Portland at the age of 14. She left home at 16 to try for a
career in New York.
   At 19, she won the role of Patti Russell in ``My Sister Sam,''
which ran from 1986 to 1988. Then, there were movie roles.
   She played Jacqueline Bisset's daughter in Paul Bartel's
recently released ``Scenes From The Class Struggle in Beverly
Hills.'' She had just completed a co-starring role in ``One Point
of View,'' a feature film directed by Dyan Cannon.

   About 200 mourners gathered Sunday afternoon to
remember Colorado family and friends who survived or were killed in
the crash of United Airlines Flight 232 at Sioux City, Iowa.
   ``Let us begin the healing process,'' the crowd was told by
Capt. William Traub, United's vice president of flight standards
based in Denver. Traub was the only United representative to
address those gathered at Whatley Chapel on the campus of the
University of Denver Law School.
   ``There is little to say to ease the sadness. We at United feel
deeply your pain and loss. We have lost members of the United
family. And we offer thanks for those who were spared,'' Traub said.
   An estimated 90 Coloradans were aboard the jetliner, which was
en route from Denver to Chicago when it crashed. At least 30 were
believed to have died. ``We are learning with one another to
remember one another in ways we are not used to,'' said the Rev.
Gilbert Horn of the Denver Council of Churches, which organized the
service. ``Part of grief is learning that we are truly human.''
   Also participating in the service were Gov. Roy Romer; the Rev.
Raymond Jones, the vicar of the Denver Archdiocese; and Rabbi
Steven Kaye, president of the Rocky Mountain Rabbinical Council.
   Romer said his status as a pilot helped him relate to the
tragedy.
   ``As a pilot I can identify with this tragedy,'' he said. ``We
can't live without love and caring. Those who remain have the
opportunity and the challenge to restore ... to appreciate life.''
   Rabbi Kaye and Jones applauded the heros of the tragedy and
praised the aid offered by hospital workers, Sioux City residents,
surviving passengers, United personnel and others.

   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said Monday he will
resign to take responsibility for his party's overwhelming defeat
in parliamentary elections.
   Uno, who has been in office less than two months, did not
specify when he would step down in the brief announcement on
national television.
   He said he was resigning because the ``ultimate responsibility
is mine'' for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in
Sunday's elections. In losing seats to the Socialists, the
governing party lost the upper house of Parliament for the first
time in 34 years.
   ``It was a very difficult election,'' Uno said.
   Uno referred to public criticism of the party over the Recruit
influence-peddling scandal, a new 3 percent consumption tax and
liberalization of agricultural imports as factors contributing to
the defeat.
   He also was severely criticized during his short tenure for
allegedly keeping paid mistresses.
   ``The people delivered their verdict, although we were not able
to fully debate policy issues with the opposition,'' Uno said. ``We
will listen modestly (to the verdict), and reflect on what we
should do.''
   He said he would remain in office until his successor is
selected, which he said he hoped could be done ``promptly.''
   The prime minister's departure will mean the resignation of the
entire Cabinet and a restructuring of the Liberal Democratic
Party's leadership.
   The conservative party conceded defeat on Sunday.
   ``We were beaten, and all I can say is that the (opposition) did
splendidly,'' the party's secretary-general, Ryutaro Hashimoto said.
   ``This is the result of the people's choice,'' said opposition
leader Takako Doi, whose Socialists gained more seats than the
Liberal Democrats, according to projections.
   The setback was expected to increase pressure for elections for
the more powerful lower house of parliament. They are not due until
July 1990.
   Voters decided half of the upper house's 252 seats in Sunday's
balloting.
   Kyodo said Monday that its projections so far showed that the
Socialists would win 42 seats and the Liberal Democrats 33.
   Eleven seats were projected for the new labor-based
Confederation Group, eight for the Clean Government Party, three
for the centrist Democratic Socialists, three for the Communists
and the rest for independents and minor parties.
   The Socialists needed to win 84 seats for a majority in the
upper house but ran only 54 candidates, so they led efforts to
create an opposition coalition with the Clean Government Party,
Democratic Socialists and the Socialist Democratic Federation.
   Final returns were expected Monday evening.
   Without control of the upper house, the Liberal Democrats would
find it harder to pass legislation. The chamber can defeat bills,
and it can delay but not veto the budget and diplomatic treaties.
   A loss in the lower house also threatens the Liberal Democrats'
hold on the prime ministry for the first time since the party was
formed in 1955. The lower house chooses the prime minister.
   A heavy turnout by Japan's 90.3 million eligible voters
reflected strong feelings over scandals and other issues that have
eroded the popularity of the Liberal Democrats.
   Noboru Takeshita resigned as prime minister last month to take
responsibility for the Recruit scandal, in which the Recruit Co.
publishing conglomerate was accused of doling out millions of
dollars in underpriced stocks and political donations to obtain
favors.
   Uno, Takeshita's successor, has been battered by allegations
that for as long as 10 years he kept paid mistresses. He has not
denied the allegations but has denied he did anything immoral.
   The accusations forced Uno to keep a low profile during the
campaign.
   The Liberal Democrats also have suffered because farmers,
traditional supporters of the party, opposed government moves to
open Japan's agricultural market wider to imports.
   The Socialists rallied voters against the new 3 percent sales
tax that was heavily backed by the governing party.
   The Socialists, putting forward a record number of women
candidates, took advantage of homemakers' anger over the tax, which
was bulldozed through Parliament by the Liberal Democrats last year
despite an opposition boycott. The tax took effect April 1.
   Although Ms. Doi is immensely popular, her party has been widely
accused of lacking a realistic and unified platform, partly because
of a small but radical faction.
   In the past, it has called for Japan to disband its Self-Defense
Forces and scrap the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, under which about
64,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan.
   Socialist leaders now say they would not immediately do away
with the armed forces, and that they seek only to revise the
treaty. But Ms. Doi and others have said all U.S. warships entering
Japanese ports should be inspected and denied entry if nuclear arms
are found.

   Two burning railroad tank cars kept
hundreds of people away from home for a second day Sunday as
hazardous materials experts decided the safest course was to let
the chemical fires burn themselves out.
   One of the cars that caught fire in the 14-car derailment
Saturday burned itself out Sunday afternoon, but the other was
still aflame, said R. Lindsey Leckie, a spokesman for CSX
Transportation Inc., which owns the train.
   The experts believed the second fire would burn itself out
overnight, and extended the evacuation of a 15-square-mile area
until sometime Monday, Leckie said.
   Monitoring around the burning tank cars found no dangerous
levels of toxic chemicals, and no long-term effects to homes or
possessions were anticipated, Leckie said.
   The burning cars did not threaten other chemical-laden cars in
the 32-car train, Leckie said earlier.
   Railroad officials examined the wreck from the air, and members
of the National Transportation Safety Board arrived in the area
about 100 miles northwest of Detroit, between Midland and Saginaw.
   The derailment's cause wasn't known. Leckie said the train was
traveling at about 37 mph when it derailed. He said the track was
most recently inspected by the Federal Railroad Administration and
CSX engineers last Tuesday.
   The accident sent a fireball and a huge column of smoke into the
air, and the fire that followed destroyed two homes. No serious
injuries were reported. Ten to 15 people were treated at hospitals
for smoke inhalation and released, Leckie said.
   Officials said there was no way of knowing how many people left
their homes, since many chose to stay with friends or relatives
rather than in shelters. Estimates ranged up to about 2,000 people
as evacuees filled hotels and occupied two Red Cross shelters.
   CSX was paying for motel rooms, meals and emergency clothing for
the displaced families, Leckie said.
   The hazardous materials team found a large gash in another tank
car, which contained naphtha. The highly flammable material
apparently was the source of the fireball, and probably burned
itself out Saturday, Leckie said.
   The car that stopped burning Sunday contained acrylic acid, a
chemical used to make plastics, which irritates the skin and is
toxic if inhaled. The other contained chlorosilene, a flammable
liquid product made by Dow Corning Corp., a joint venture between
Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Glass Works.
   The train was on a scheduled run from Port Huron to Midland.
   Dow Chemical Co. spokesman Gary Black said some of the chemicals
on the train were going to the Midland Cogeneration Venture, in
which Dow and Consumers Power Co. are partners. The project is
converting the utility company's never-finished nuclear power plant
to a gas-fired plant to generate electricity and steam.
   Some evacuees at a local high school said they were forced from
their homes so quickly they couldn't grab a change of clothing.
Residents of about 60 homes at the Avondale Mobile Home Court said
authorities rushed them out of the park in Freeland, about 1{ miles
from the blaze.
   ``They pulled us out before it got too bad. We were starting to
smell it when the police came around,'' said Robert Bauder.
   Bauder said that when he left he looked back and saw a billow of
black smoke so huge, ``it was like a tornado.''
   ``The cloud was directly overhead. There was the smell of burnt
insulation,'' said mobile home resident Dale Turner.
   Robin Mobley, 25, was evacuated twice Saturday, first to a
Midland elementary school. A few hours later, fumes from the fire
headed that way, and she was sent to the high school.
   ``We're resigned to at least two nights here,'' she said. ``I've
been told so many stories, I don't know which one to believe.''

<HEAD>Dates In Sousuke Uno's Short Tenure As Premier</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Japan-Election, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sousuke Uno probably won't go down in history as
holding Japan's premiership for the shortest time since World War
II. That dubious distinction now goes to Tanzan Ishibashi, whose
tenure lasted only a bit over two months. But Uno's will be one of
the shortest.
   Here is a chronology of his unexpected rise and fall:
   
   MAY 28 _ Uno, then foreign minister, leaves for Paris to attend
international conferences while Liberal Democratic Party elders
decide he will replace former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita after
their first choice, Masayoshi Ito, declines.
   JUNE 2 _ Parliament confirms Uno as prime minister. Uno says he
will follow a policy of political reform to win back popularity for
his party following the damaging Recruit influence-peddling scandal
that forced Takeshita to resign.
   JUNE 5 _ The Sunday Mainichi magazine breaks a taboo on
disclosing details of politicians' private lives and publishes an
article alleging Uno kept a paid geisha mistress. The allegation
does not hurt Uno until foreign news media pick up the story and it
is published outside Japan. The Japanese media then give it wider
dissemination.
   JUNE 9 _ Uno is embarrassed in Parliament when an opposition
Socialist member questions him about the geisha allegation. He
declines to respond, fueling a barrage of criticism from women's
organizations.
   JUNE 28 _ After more published allegations of extra-marital
affairs, news reports say that Uno told a party leadership meeting
he cannot continue in office. But the reports say he is persuaded
to remain as premier.
   JULY 14-16 _ Representing Japan at the Paris economic summit of
the seven major industrialized democracies, Uno promises greater
aid for the developing world and strong efforts to protect the
environment.
   JULY 23 _ Elections are held for half the seats in the upper
house of Parliament amid predictions that Uno will resign if his
party fares poorly. It does, losing its majority for the first time
in 34 years.
   JULY 24 _ Uno says he will resign, but does not immediately set
a date. As was the case before the party chose him as leader, there
is no obvious candidate among the Liberal Democrats to replace him.
He says he will remain in office until the search ends, which could
take weeks.

<TEXT>
   A man wanted in connection with four fatal
shootings in three states was arrested in a hospital emergency room
late Sunday.
   Michael Frank Greene, 37, was arrested at Comanche County
Memorial Hospital in Lawton, where he had gone for treatment of an
undisclosed back injury, police said.
   District Attorney Fred Collins said one count of first-degree
murder, two counts of shooting with intent to kill and two counts
of robbery with a firearm were filed against Greene Sunday
afternoon in Carter County District Court.
   All four victims in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas were killed with
a bullet in the back of the head, according to Les Weaver, a Texas
highway patrol dispatcher.
   The shootings started Wednesday in Garden City, when Barbara
Kochendorfer, 27, and Mary Rains, 28, were abducted from separate
convenience stores on opposite sides of Garden City, in western
Kansas. Their bodies were found hours later.
   On Thursday, Edley Perry Spurrier was found dead in the photo
processing shop he ran in Pampa, a town in the Texas panhandle.
   At approximately 3 p.m. Friday, a gunman entered the flower shop
in Ardmore in central Oklahoma. Dr. Scott Malowney, the Ardmore
medical examiner, said the attack that followed was ``almost
ritualistic'' and ``more like an assassination than a shooting,
almost.''
   One of the survivors, Joann Bean, identified Greene as the man
who shot her, said Ardmore Assistant Police Chief David Willingham.
Another woman, Gwenn Miller, died and a third was in serious
condition.

<HEAD>Organizing Vote Set for Nissan's Only U.S. Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHIL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Weaver has worked in about 500
organizing campaigns in 38 years with the United Auto Workers, but
he says he's never seen anything quite like Nissan's response to a
union drive at its only U.S. plant.
   As described by Weaver, the Japanese company's tactics sound
like a cross between jury selection and political campaigning.
   About 2,400 hourly workers are scheduled to vote Wednesday and
Thursday on UAW representation at the 8-year-old Nissan Motor
Manufacturing U.S.A. plant, one of three non-union U.S. plants
owned by Japanese automakers.
   Tennessee is a right-to-work state, so-called because of laws
that unions say limit their activity.
   That might seem to make organizing in Smyrna different from
organizing in Detroit. But Weaver said that hasn't been a problem
for the UAW. Rather, the challenge for the union has been to combat
tactics by the Japanese automaker that are usually not seen in this
country.
   ``First of all, they screened their employees carefully on their
family's union background,'' Weaver said. ``I'm told they promised
them employment for life. Then they started the line speed real
slow, then speeded it up.''
   Nissan also has a high-tech advantage that union organizers
could not counter: Television monitors play pro-company messages
constantly in employee break rooms.
   Nissan officials declined to discuss the organizing effort in
detail.
   ``We've got a policy. We just don't want to conduct this
election in the media. We've been trying to be quiet,'' said Nissan
U.S.A. President Jerry Benefield.
   ``Trying to answer (UAW) questions is kind of like being in a
contest between union and management. But it's not. It's a contest
between the union and the employees.''
   The union's national office has beefed up its organizing staff
in Smyrna for the final two weeks of the campaign from about 10 to
around 35 UAW workers from across the country, said local UAW
spokesman Maxey Irwin.
   The union representatives and members of the in-plant organizing
committee went on ``house calls'' to persuade Nissan employees to
vote for the union.
   Worker injuries and assembly line speeds have emerged as the
campaign's main issues. Nissan lawyers notified the Tennessee
Department of Labor that the company would appeal a state order to
release Occupational Safety and Health Administration logs that
detail worker injuries. The state Labor Department issued a
citation and levied a $5,000 fine against Nissan for refusal to
release that information.
   The appeals process could take three to six months, long after
the union election is held.
   ``Everybody's focusing on this as a make-or-break situation for
American labor. But business is looking at Nissan's refusal (to
release the logs) as a major blunder,'' Irwin said.
   Dr. Michael Silverstein, assistant director of health and safety
for the UAW, said in June that as many as one in five Nissan
workers was injured on the job and lost a work day because of it
last year.
   In April, Nissan officials reported a worker injury or illness
rate of 8.9 per 100 workers for 1987 _ less than half the rate
claimed by the union. A company spokeswoman in June said the
company stands by its calculations of worker injury rates. She
declined further comment.
   Dottie Lockhart, a production technician at the Smyrna plant,
said she didn't know of any injuries during the four years she has
worked there.
   ``I can't think of anybody that's been hurt or been out of work
or had to lose any time at all. It's not heaven up there, but it's
not a killing job either,'' Lockhart said. ``I've worked at harder
places and made less money.''
   Lockhart said production line speed is not a problem. But she
cited a new production line task with which workers had trouble.
   ``We had a job and we thought it was too hard. And we said
something about it, and Nissan did something about it. They changed
the job, made it better, made it easier,'' she said.
   Union representatives have said Nissan's workers make about
$7,900 less a year in pay and benefits than their counterparts at
Ford Motor Co.
   But the issue goes beyond just pay and benefits at one plant,
some argue.
   Steve Norris, executive director of the conservative Tennessee
Business Roundtable, said the state's economic potential would be
diminished should the UAW represent Nissan workers.
   ``I think one reason many industries have located here is that
we're a right-to-work state, and anything we can do to preserve
that makes Tennessee more attractive.''

<HEAD>Hard To Detect The Stealth In Seattle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crucial vote on the B-2 bomber is due in
Congress this week, but there's been little concern voiced in
Seattle about the future of a program that involves thousands of
local workers and means billions of dollars for the Boeing Co.
   ``That's a tough one,'' Tom Hobson, a Seattle Chamber of
Commerce spokesman, said last week when asked whether there had
been much discussion of the B-2's fate by Seattle's business
community.
   ``To be honest, I haven't heard anybody locally talk about it at
all.''
   For Boeing Advanced Systems, the division of Seattle-based
Boeing building parts of the stealth bomber in the city, talk about
the top-secret project has been sparse and carefully phrased.
   Advanced Systems spokesman John Kvasnosky said Boeing's role is
worth ``some billions of dollars, but we haven't released
specifics.''
   Likewise, he wouldn't say exactly what B-2 parts Boeing makes,
and would only say ``in excess of 5,000'' Boeing employees work on
the project.
   Boeing is the largest of nine Washington state subcontractors
and suppliers for the B-2. Nationwide, prime contractor Northrop
Corp. says, tens of thousands of people at 156 companies in 46
states are involved in the plane, which is assembled at Palmdale,
Calif.
   Both the U.S. House and Senate this week take up the defense
authorizaion bill, which includes nearly $4 billion for the B-2.
There's been strong opposition raised to the B-2 by members of both
parties, who are balking at the $70 billion for the 132 B-2s sought
by the Air Force.
   One of the bomber's staunchest supporters is Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash., who says the program is of major importance to Boeing and
to the future of the aerospace industry.
   ``We're talking about 8,700 jobs in the Seattle area,'' Dicks
said last week. ``Boeing is a major subcontractor. They're doing
the wings on the B-2. It's a major, revolutionary new technology.''
   The B-2 makes extensive use of new, lightweight, composite
materials in its construction, in part to absorb radar waves to
make the plane harder to detect. Dicks said the $22 billion to $23
billion already spent on the B-2 program not only is buying planes
but pays for research and development into composite materials and
aircraft design that can be used in other defense projects and in
commercial aviation.
   ``All of that will have enormous spinoff to the one sector where
the U.S. still has superiority over all of the world,'' Dicks said,
referring to the aviation industry. ``I hate to see that lost.''
   Deduct the research and development costs, and the price of a
single B-2 comes down to about $260 million from the $530 million
figure usually cited, he said.
   Kvasnosky said it was premature to speculate what might happen
to B-2 workers if the program is canceled or extensively cut back.
   However, it's likely many employees could be absorbed elsewhere
within Boeing, which has been scrambling for experienced workers on
its commercial aircraft side. Boeing Commercial Airplanes has had
five straight years of record orders.
   Several aerospace industry analysts begged off commenting on
Boeing and the B-2, saying there just wasn't enough hard
information.
   But Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York, ventured ``a rough guestimate'' that the split
among key companies in the B-2 program could be 60 to 65 percent
for Northrop, 25 percent for engine-maker General Electric Co., 15
to 20 percent for Boeing and smaller shares to LTV and Hughes.
   Nisbet speculated that remaining work on a fully funded B-2
program could mean $8 billion to $10 billion for Boeing, and
possibly close to $1 billion in profit.
   Boeing has not given out any financial breakdown on the B-2, but
Northrop revealed that the bomber accounted for $657 million, or
about half its overall sales, for its first quarter this year.
   Nisbet agreed with Dicks that technology being developed for the
stealth could be valuable, especially on the Advanced Tactical
Fighter, a 21st century warplane that Advanced Systems hopes to
build with Lockheed for the Air Force.
   ``No question about it, they're blazing a trail in technology.
There won't be any more weapons systems built that won't
incorporate some of the technology of this research.''
   The B-2 made its first flight last week, and a second bomber is
to start flight tests next month. Ten more B-2s are under
construction.

   Like the stealth bomber it's helping to build,
the Boeing Co.'s lobbying effort on Capitol Hill to save funding
for the secretive bomber has been, until recently, almost invisible.
   Lawmakers and congressional staff said that despite the
Seattle-based aerospace company's major stake in the B-2 program,
it has only been in the past week or so that Boeing lobbyists have
contacted members.
   ``They are weighing in now and it is timely,'' said U.S. Rep.
Norm Dicks, D-Wash., a member of the defense subcommittee of the
House Appropriations Committee and a B-2 supporter.
   The debate over the stealth bomber appropriation is scheduled to
reach the House floor this week as members consider amendments that
range from gutting the program to less crippling reductions in
funding.
   Several congressional staffers, who asked not to be identified,
said Boeing's lobbying is usually the most low-keyed of all the
aerospace defense contractors.
   ``The difference is that Boeing is diversified and has a huge
backlog of commercial aircraft orders while the others don't,''
said one staffer. ``The defense contracts are important to Boeing,
but it is not life and death.''
   Northrop, the Lockheed Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. all
have more ``heavy-handed'' lobbying reputations because so much of
their business is connected with the military, the staffer said.
   Dicks and other lawmakers said Boeing had concentrated its
lobbying on preserving funding for the V-22 Osprey, a short landing
and takeoff troop carrier for the Marine Corps. Boeing Helicopters
in Philadelphia is one of the prime contractors on that project.
   ``Now that we are down to it on the B-2, they are working
hard,'' said Dicks, adding that he had personally contacted more
than 150 members to urge them to support the B-2.
   Dicks is a true believer in the stealth bomber, defending it as
a ``capable, effective deterrent'' that, while expensive, is so
sophisticated it will eventually render Soviet air defenses useless.
   Dicks is also well aware of the impact it will have in
Washington state.
   ``I tell members up front that Washington state has a stake in
this,'' said Dicks. ``But I want to make sure they are aware of the
national security implications.''
   Boeing officials are typically closed mouth about their lobbying
efforts and the stealth bomber is no exception.
   ``We don't discuss it,'' said George Weiss, a Boeing spokesman
here.
   Weiss did say that Boeing lobbyists were contacting about 30
congressmen, adding, ``We don't necessarily try to sell a program,
we just keep people informed.''
   Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz was also reportedly making phone
calls to key congressmen at week's end.
   One of those who met with Boeing lobbyists last week was Rep.
Rod Chandler, R-Wash., who said the pitch was about 50 percent on
the national security need for the bomber and about 50 percent on
its importance to Seattle.
   ``They are very effective and tried to defuse all the
arguments,'' said Chandler, adding that he also received a brochure
on the B-2 program prepared by the Northrop Corp., the lead
contractor.
   Chandler, as of late last week, said he was undecided how he
will vote on the stealth funding amendments.

<HEAD>Striking Eastern Workers Picket Continental Terminal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Eastern Airlines flight attendants on
Sunday picketed the Boston terminal of sister carrier Continental
Airlines, trying to heighten public awareness of their 4-month-old
walkout.
   The picket was organized by labor consultant Ray Rogers, whose
tactics have been controversial in other labor actions.
   About 30 flight attendants, who have been on strike since March
4, marched along with their children and other family members at
the Logan International Airport terminal.
   Eastern and Continental are subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp.,
whose chairman, Frank Lorenzo, has been the chief target of
criticism from the stikers.
   The picketers said they were particularly targeting passengers
who took advantage of Continental's special $1 fares for children
under age 18. The special was in effect for passengers who
purchased tickets for their children before June.
   Children walking the picket line carried balloons and signs with
such messages as ``Lorenzo is a stinker'' and ``Lorenzo is a bozo.''
   ``We're here to bring to the attention of the public our
strike,'' said Dolores Stewart, an Eastern flight attendant for 15
years. ``We're here with our children because we have families too
and we know of what we speak.''
   The strikers had a permit to picket in front of the terminal and
passengers moved through to the busy ticket counter without
incident. Many were handed leaflets by Rand Wilson of Rogers' New
York-based labor consulting firm, the Corporate Campaign. The
leaflets detailed alleged safety and service shortcomings of
Continental and Eastern.
   Continental spokesman Ned Walker declined to comment on the
picketing, saying it was primarily a matter between Eastern and the
strikers.
   Rogers was hired by the flight attendants union in Miami to help
raise public awareness of the strike. He has stirred up controversy
in other strikes for advocating confrontational tactics.
   The Corporate Campaign strategy involves focusing public
attention on affiliates and major customers of a company involved
in a strike to try to apply economic pressure to management.
   Eastern filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws after
the strike severely curtailed its operations.

<TEXT>
   Corona Extra, that trendy, pricey Mexican
beer you wash down with a lime, has lost some appeal among U.S.
yuppies and forced its brewer to seek other customers, namely
light-beer drinkers and the Japanese.
   In a new advertising campaign, the American promoters of Corona
are peddling a new light brew. They're also stressing Corona's
tropical Mexican roots and the heavier version's popularity with
seasoned California surfers.
   ``The U.S. market is flat because of lifestyle changes,'' said
Michael J. Mazzoni, executive vice president and general manager of
Chicago-based Barton Beers, Ltd., which imports Corona to the
western United States from Cervecerias Modelo, the brewer.
   ``There's a new emphasis on fitness, and sales are flat with the
yuppies,'' whose purchases once enabled Corona to threaten Dutch
brew Heineken as the No. 1 U.S. import, Mazzoni said in an
interview.
   Corona sells for about $5 a six-pack in the U.S. market, more
than double what it costs in Mexico. It seemed to draw
style-conscious affluent young Americans like a magnet with its
clear long-neck bottles and the Mexican custom of downing some
alcoholic beverages with a squeeze of lime.
   The Mexican beer's stagnant sales in the United States partly
reflect a decline in alcoholic beverage drinking by many Americans,
which is affecting rival brews as well.
   At 2.4 billion cases, the U.S. beer market grew negligibly over
1987, while imports rose just 0.4 percent after two years of strong
growth.
   Corona's sales in the U.S. market peaked in 1987 at nearly 25
million cases. Last year sales totaled about 22 million cases,
according to statistics compiled by Impact, a newsletter about the
U.S. beverage industry. Heineken sold more than 34 million cases in
the United States in both 1987 and 1988.
   The Mexican beer's hold on the No. 2 spot is secure, and sales
still far exceed 1984, when the brewer sold about 1.5 million cases
in the United States. But the stalled growth has provoked concern.
   ``We've really been clobbered over the past year,'' Mazzoni
said. ``We need some excitement.''
   Modelo hopes to stir something up by introducing what hardened
beer drinkers may consider a contradiction in terms: Corona Light.
   ``It's the final evolution in light,'' said Thomas A. McNichols,
Barton's marketing director.
   While total U.S. beer consumption hasn't grown, light brews are
becoming more popular. For the first time, three of the five
top-selling brands are lights and the trend has carried over into
imports.
   Modelo shipped its first case of Corona Light northward in April
and began test-marketing in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego,
Phoenix and Chicago. Eventually, a new plant in Guadalajara will
produce up to 400,000 cases of Corona Light a month.
   ``There are people who say Corona's already light. But I can't
tell you how many times I've heard people say _ wrongly _ they're
worried about its calorie content,'' said Mazzoni.
   Corona averages about 148 calories a bottle, the brewer says,
despite rumors it's as high as 400 calories. The light variety's
calorie content is 105.
   Modelo and its U.S. distributors, Barton and Gambrinis Importing
Co., Inc. of San Antonio, plan to duplicate marketing tactics used
to promote Corona Light's heavier cousin: relying at first on
word-of-mouth advertising by introducing the brand in trendy
restaurants and bars.
   The successful and voiceless Corona television ads, filmed in
such tropical resorts as Ixtapa, also will be used to tout Corona
Light, McNichols said.
   The brewer also is trying to counter its slippage in the
American market by reaching out to drinkers in Japan, where Corona
sells for $7.40 a bottle.
   ``We're going after young adults, the opinion leaders and what
we call the `sensitive trend leaders,''' said John R. Hamaguchi,
import marketing director for Hiroya Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan's
oldest liquor merchant.
   ``There's the opinion leader: the one always with the latest
news, fashions and hairstyles and who drink Corona because it's a
new thing,'' Hamaguchi said.
   ``Then there's the sensitive trend leaders. Corona's a very
sophisticated item in Japan, especially in Tokyo night clubs,'' he
said. ``That's where the sensitive trend leaders go.''
   Since it introduced Corona to Japan in July 1987, Hiroya sold
130,000 cases of Corona through 1988, making the beer the No. 5
import and 10th overall. ``We want 1 million cases five years from
now,'' Hamaguchi said.
   Unlike the Western ad pitch, the Japanese ad campaign is full of
words. In fact it features a man singing singing about what he
likes and how Corona fits:
   I like two-branch roads in the middle of the city
   A rhythm that stimulates the right side of my brain
   A melody that has lost the code begins to be heard
   If I take the right road, it'll lead me to the end of the ground
   If I take the left road, it'll lead me to the end of the sea ...
   In my left hand I've got a lime
   In my right hand, I've got a Corona ...
   At this moment, I'm in the bottle of paradise.

   Recent rains in the Midwest have boosted
the prospects for a larger corn crop, and that could have important
implications for a wide spectrum of other commodities, according to
study.
   The study, released Friday by the University of
Missouri-Columbia, says the rain has increased the possibility that
U.S. corn farmers this fall will harvest a 118 bushel-per-acre corn
crop, totaling about 7.8 billion bushels.
   Previously, the U.S. Department of Agriculture projected a 113
bushel-per-acre crop, totaling about 7.5 billion bushels.
   That 4 percent difference in yield could mean a 12 percent or
larger drop in corn prices, said Abner Womack, director of the
university's Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute.
   Womack said that if the higher corn yields materialize, the
average prices farmers receive for the crop would drop to about
$1.75 a bushel from the $2 the USDA had projected.
   Any change in corn prices is important because corn is the
country's most widely planted farm crop. Corn also is the biggest
source of livestock feed for meat, milk and egg producers.
   An unexpectedly large corn crop would tend to depress prices for
other crops. That would require federal farm program officials to
make higher price support payments, which would leave less money to
help farmers with drought relief.
   No one yet knows exactly how much corn farmers will produce this
year because whether it rains in the next two weeks could swing
final production either way, Womack said.
   Much of the country's crop is in the pollination stage, which
means that cool, damp weather is needed so that more kernels will
form on the corn ears that farmers will harvest this fall.
   ``Right now, we're leaning on the side of larger crops and lower
prices, but that still could change quickly,'' Womack said.

<HEAD>Workers Changing Signs on RCA Building</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK _ Somewhere over the Rainbow Room, sometime in the next
two months, the RCA Building will become, unmistakably, the GE
Building.
   The huge, red neon ``RCA'' signs are being dismantled from the
top of the 70-story building in favor of a red neon ``GE'' _ a move
that, initially, did not put General Electric Co. in a good light.
   But the grumbling that greeted the announced name change last
summer subsided, the city gave its blessing and now workers are
removing all signs of the old RCA Corp. on the limestone
centerpiece of Rockefeller Center.
   A slab of granite with ``RCA Building'' chiseled into it was
removed Friday from one of the entrances. Two weeks ago workers
started taking down the neon signs that face south, west and north.
   GE bought RCA and its network television division, NBC, in 1986.
NBC, which is headquartered in the building, announced last July
that the building's name and signs would be changed. The building
is owned by Rockefeller Center.
   ``I guarantee you a lot of people aren't going to notice,'' said
Sue Gould, a partner in the graphics firm Lebowitz-Gould-Design
Inc., which designed the new neon signs.
   ``It will be the same color, the same glass,'' she said. The new
letters will be in outlined block italics, inspired by an old
General Electric monogram _ not the familiar script logo found on
GE products.
   The changeover, expected to be finished by September, received
approval last fall from the city Landmarks Preservation Commission,
which had input into the design of the new neon.
   Some who groaned at the thought of a new sign last summer may
not have known that the current RCA sign was installed in 1968,
replacing the original 1937 Art Decosign during an RCA ``corporate
image'' makeover, Gould noted.
   Several other buildings in Rockefeller Center also have changed
names since the 1930s when the complex was built, Gould said.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Search Files at Georgia Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY L. CARTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents armed with a search warrant took a
personal computer, a printer and computer diskettes from the office
of Georgia Power Co.'s chief financial officer, the company said.
   Georgia Power spokesman David Altman said Internal Revenue
Service agents came to the office of Mike Harreld, the company's
vice president and comptroller, Friday afternoon and left about
three hours later with the computer equipment and software.
   ``We don't know exactly what (software) they took,'' Altman
said. ``Obviously this is related to the ongoing investigation'' of
Georgia Power's parent firm, The Southern Co.
   The IRS has been investigating allegations of tax fraud, theft,
cover-ups and illegal political contributions by officials and
employees at Southern subsidiaries for more than three years.
   The probe heated up in August when a federal grand jury in
Atlanta also began looking into the finances of Southern and
subsidiaries. Federal agents also raided Georgia Power offices at
that time.
   IRS spokesman Kent Taylor said the agency could not ``confirm or
deny'' that a raid occurred Friday.
   Altman said Harreld, who is in charge of all the company's
financial statements, would have no comment.
   ``We really were very surprised at the search warrant,'' Altman
said. ``We have been cooperating fully with the U.S. attorney's
office on this investigation and we find it very surprising that
they would feel the need to use a search warrant for materials that
they perhaps could have gotten otherwise.''
   The full scope of the IRS and grand jury investigations has not
been disclosed, but initial reports centered on spare parts
accounting.
   Two former managers at Gulf Power Co., one of the subsidiaries,
were sentenced to prison for tax fraud, and a Pensacola, Fla.,
businessman was convicted of perjury last year in kickback schemes.
They were accused of stealing more then $80,000 by billing Gulf
Power for materials never delivered.
   A third Gulf Power employee was fired this year after new
kickback allegations.
   The investigation has been marked by two unusual events.
   Ray Howell, a Pensacola graphic designer who did contract work
for Gulf Power, disappeared a day before he was to testify before
the Atlanta grand jury last December.
   Then in April, Gulf Power Senior Vice President Jacob Horton
died in a Pensacola plane crash while he was on his way to Atlanta,
apparently to talk with corporate officials about the
investigations.
   In addition to Georgia Power and Gulf Power, other Southern
subsidiaries are Alabama Power Co. and Mississippi Power Co.

<HEAD>Electronics Firm Reports Second-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite reporting a second-quarter loss of
$13 million, Zenith Electronics Corp. expects to report a profit
for the year, Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman says.
   The company announced Friday that shifts in the value of the
dollar and increased interest expenses caused the second-quarter
loss.
   ``Because of our currency position and other factors, we are now
less confident that the company will be more profitable in 1989
than in 1988, especially if the dollar stays strong,'' Pearlman
said.
   Zenith, the lone domestic television manufacturer and a major
maker of personal computers, said the second-quarter loss amounted
to 49 cents per share, compared with a loss of $12.1 million, or 46
cents per share, in the second quarter of 1988.
   Second-quarter sales totaled $676 million, up 15 percent from
sales of $589 million in the 1988 period.
   For the first six months of 1989, Zenith reported a net loss of
$17 million, or 64 cents per share, compared with a 1988 first-half
loss of $11.7 million, or 45 cents per share. Sales in the first
half totaled $1.35 billion, up 16 percent from $1.16 billion in the
1988 period.
   Pearlman said that this year, Zenith positioned itself in
anticipation of a weakening U.S. dollar. Instead, the dollar's
value increased, making the company unable to benefit from the
stronger dollar for purchases made in foreign currencies.
   ``Our currency positioning, which didn't permit us to operate at
prevailing currency market rates, resulted in a lost profit
opportunity of about $5 million in the second quarter,'' he said.
``And if exchange rates remain where they are today, the
second-half effect could be about $20 million.''
   Company officials said revenus from computer sales increased 12
percent in the second quarter to $384 million from $342 million in
1988. The increase came despite a reduction in personal-computer
prices to meet price reductions by competitors.
   The company also reported an 18 percent increase in
second-quarter consumer electronics revenue to $292 million from
$247 million last year, reflecting higher color television and
video recorder sales.

   Hostile soybean farmers confronted
officials of the Chicago Board of Trade and colleagues applauded
their criticism.
   There was a more reserved reception for an official of the $30
billion Ferruzzi Group of Italy, which at one time this month
controlled 56 percent of the contracts on the exchange for the July
delivery of soybeans and claimed it was victimized when it was
forced to sell out over an eight-day period.
   At the end of the separate sessions Friday before a convention
of the American Soybean Association, farmers said many questions
remained over the recent soybean trading frenzy and price decline
on the exchange.

   China says it will allow Hong Kong to remain
capitalist after reverting to Beijing rule in eight years only if
its residents stop supporting the mainland's crushed democracy
movement.
   Hong Kong residents have helped smuggle movement activists to
the West and pledged money to help them oppose the Chinese leaders
who ordered soldiers to attack demonstrators in Beijing on June 3-4.
   But a commentary Friday in the Communist Party newspaper, the
People's Daily, accused Hong Kong activists of sabotaging the
Chinese-British agreement that calls for the enclave to remain
capitalist for at least 50 years after it reverts to mainland rule
in 1997.
