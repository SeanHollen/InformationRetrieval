   East Germany's electrifying decision to open the Berlin Wall for
unimpeded travel by its citizens has brought the two halves of
Germany far closer together. But the two states are still a long
way from a merger.
   The two Germanys have belonged to hostile East-West camps since
the postwar occupation following the defeat of Nazi Germany in
1945. Their drawing together in economic, social and cultural
matters now seems inevitable because of the remarkable changes that
have swept East Germany's Communist system in recent weeks.
   Yet a complete reunification of East and West Germany will be
hard to achieve. Here are some of the reasons:
   _ Defense requirements of the Soviet Union and the United States
preclude the total withdrawal of NATO and Warsaw Pact troops from
the Germanys at present. This would seem to be an essential
precondition for reunification.
   _ A backlash is possible from West Germans, particularly those
in lower-income groups who feel economically threatened, against
the tide of refugees. This year alone, authorities expect 700,000
new arrivals in West Germany _ including 200,000 East Germans, as
well as ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union and Poland and
asylum-seekers from other countries.
   _ The question remains whether East Germans, after four decades
of living in a highly subsidized, albeit shortage-plagued economy,
will want to jettison socialism to embrace capitalism, with all the
foibles of the free marketplace.
   Although the West German constitution of 1949 embraces the goal
of German unity and guarantees West German citizenship to all
people of German descent, the country already has a critical
housing problem and faces labor tensions caused by chronic
unemployment, now at 1.9 million, more than 7 percent. With 61
million people crowded into a country the size of Oregon, West
Germans are increasingly worried how this flood of newcomers will
effect their pocketbooks.
   This concern was underlined in a television comment Thursday by
a West German youth, who declared in reaction to the opening of the
Berlin Wall: ``The Federal Republic is not a country of
immigrants.''
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was visiting Warsaw when East
Germany threw open the barrier on Thursday, said West Germany's
interest ``must be that our compatriots stay in their homeland.''
   The superpowers' security interests would have to be worked out
before any complete reunfication could occur. The Soviets have
upwards of 400,000 troops stationed in East Germany _ the
cornerstone of the Warsaw Pact alliance _ and the United States has
250,000 troops in West Germany.
   Another consideration is the European Economic Community's plan
to eliminate virtually all trade barriers in Western Europe in 1992.
   Provision would have to be made to include East Germany in the
new ``open border'' trading system, although East Germany already
enjoys a privileged trading relationship with Bonn.
   French Premier Michel Rochard said Thursday he would not oppose
East German membership in the EEC, but he advocated careful
negotiations beforehand.
   Reunification could lead to the prospect of disarmament, or at
least massive cuts in German armed forces. This would raise the
issue of guarantees for Germany's security _ and whether a powerful
German state would settle for such assurances from other countries.
   George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev could decide to reduce troops
in both Germanys at their summit meeting next month as a
confidence-building gesture. But West Europeans, while praising the
sudden turn of events in East Germany, harbor suspicions of a
unified Germany that would be a politically and economically
dominant force in Europe.
   And citizens of the Soviet Union, mindful of its staggering
losses in two world wars, have real concern about a resurgent
Germany.
   On Friday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
praised East German reforms, but said any speculation about a
reunified Germany is ``out of the question.''
   Certainly nothing can happen before the Communist elite of East
Germany permits a fundamental change: free elections that could
turn it out of government leadership. This would be tantamount to
dumping the authoritarian system that has ruled with total control
for 40 years.
   While it is true that Poland and Hungary have abandoned the
``leading role'' of the Communist Party in their countries, the
East German hierarchy has shown no willingness to do the same.
   Many of the East German opposition groups that have sprung up in
recent weeks have emphasized that they want to preserve socialism,
not replace it with a capitalist system.
   By giving citizens the opportunity to travel to the West and
purchase goods not available at home, East German leaders have
provided a much-needed outlet for frustrations, and probably
rescued their system from an explosion.
   But a crackdown like that which ended democratic dreams in China
last June cannot be ruled out. East German leader Egon Krenz
praised the Chinese government for crushing the pro-democracy
movement when he visited Bejing this summer.

   A pregnant mother who was severely burned
when a fighter jet smashed into a suburban apartment complex died
Friday, hours after searchers found a man's body in the wreckage of
his incinerated apartment.
   Navy investigators hunting through the debris for clues said
they did not know what caused Thursday evening's crash, which
engulfed three apartment buildings in flames that climbed more than
100 feet in the air.
   Margie Padovani, 28, died of her injuries at 8:49 p.m. EST, said
John Hester, night administrator at Grady Memorial Hospital, where
Ms. Padovani had been transferred with burns over 56 percent of her
body.
   The woman's 5-year-old daughter remained in critical but stable
condition at Grady, Hester said. The pilot, who ejected just before
the jet crashed in a fireball into the complex Thursday evening,
also remained in critical condition.
   ``The worst part was just the sounds _ that little girl
screaming,'' said resident Tamara Owens.
   Resident Bill Barcus, who still had a reddened face and a singed
arm Friday from facing the intense heat in an attempt to reach the
burning woman, said, ``I got to within 10 feet of the woman but it
was too hot and I didn't have any shoes on. All I could hear were
her screams, but I had to back off. I went back to get my shoes,
but by then somebody had gotten her.''
   The young man's body was found about 3 p.m. Friday in the
apartment that absorbed the heaviest damage from the crash, Cobb
County Medical Examiner Joseph Burton said.
   The man was identified only as white and in his 20s. Burton said
there was no indication that anyone else was in the apartment,
where he said a man lived alone.
   Authorities did not immediately identify the resident or the
body. Only one person was known to be missing prior to discovery of
the body, but the search continued. Four missing people were
located earlier Friday.
   ``Obviously nobody (else) turned up missing, and that leads us
to believe there is no one else in there,'' said Kathie Barton,
Smyrna's director of community relations.
   The body was found in the kitchen of the last apartment in a
building along the easternmost edge of the complex. Smyrna Mayor
Max Bacon said he was told the apartment was incinerated by
4,000-degree temperatures.
   About 30 people were left homeless by the fire, and about 50
others who lived in undamaged portions of the Pine Lake Village
Apartment complex had not been allowed to return to their homes
Friday afternoon. Most spent Thursday night at a nearby motel,
which offered free lodging.
   Reserve Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn Jr. of Marietta, the only
person aboard the unarmed A-7E Corsair II attack plane, was
reported doing better Friday, but remained unconscious after brain
surgery, said Kennestone Hospital spokeswoman Laurel Fredlake.
   Ms. Padovani also suffered lung damage from smoke inhalation and
various internal injuries, Hester said. He added that doctors had
not pinpointed the cause of death for the woman, who had undergone
surgery Thursday night to reset a broken leg.
   Troy Kraemer, Ms. Padovani's fiance, said she had been two
months pregnant.
   Ms. Padovani's daughter, Jacquelyn, also suffered burns over
about half of her body, said Grady Memorial Hospital spokesman Jim
Driscoll.
   In other injuries, a woman hurt while fleeing her apartment was
treated for cracked ribs, and a military rescue worker broke an
ankle, officials said.
   Firefighters extinguished the blaze about two hours after the
6:26 p.m. crash, but hot spots hampered the search Thursday night.
   Civilian searchers were kept away through much of the day while
Navy investigators looked for clues, and Marine Reserve guards
helped seal off the crash site.
   Police officer Frank Durrance said the Navy jet struck the edge
of a building before crashing into a car and coming to rest by a
chain link fence about 30 yards away. ``You could tell it was a
car, but you can't tell that it was a plane,'' Durrance said.
   Barton said 12 apartments were destroyed and 20 damaged in two
buildings. Three of the 32 units in those buildings were vacant,
said Jim Humphrey, maintenance supervisor for the complex.
   The jet crashed 2.5 miles short of the runway at Naval Air
Station Atlanta, located at Dobbins Air Force Base, 15 miles
northwest of Atlanta. The pilot was to land there while on a
navigational training mission, the Navy said.
   Conlyn, 37, has flown Navy aircraft for 15 years on active duty
and in the Reserves. He joined Delta Air Lines in 1980 and is a
co-pilot for the Atlanta-based carrier.
   He suffered a skull fracture when his ejection seat slammed into
a street near the apartment complex. A witness said his parachute
deployed only about 100 feet off the ground.
   The commander of the Naval Air Station, Capt. Peter Hunt, said
the Navy had no leads on the cause of the crash. He added that the
pilot did not report any trouble to flight controllers.
   ``Whatever happened, happened suddenly,'' Hunt said.
   The plane did not carry the ``black box'' flight recorder
required on commercial airliners, Hunt said. He said a Navy review
board would study the wreckage and maintenance and pilot records.
   The Navy has been beset by a string of accidents in the last
month, including a boiler fire that injured nine sailors and two
incidents in which sailors aboard aircraft carriers were swept or
fell into the sea. Two were presumed dead.
   In the most deadly accident of late, a jet pilot making his
first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed into the USS Lexington
in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 29, killing him and four others on
the deck of the huge ship.
   On Oct. 30, an F@A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the
guided missile cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, causing
minor injuries to five sailors and blowing a 5-foot hole in the
ship's bow.
   Two years ago, an A-7D Corsair, an earlier version of the plane
that crashed Thursday, slammed into the lobby of the Ramada
Inn-Airport in Indianapolis, killing 10 people.

   The three major networks ran their evening
broadcasts from the Berlin Wall, but NBC anchor Tom Brokaw got
there first, helping NBC bounce back from its embarrassing early
coverage of the San Francisco earthquake.
   On Friday night ABC's Peter Jennings and CBS' Dan Rather were
also on the scene to report on East Germany's historic lifting of
travel restrictions.
   Brokaw got there Thursday night, heisting a chunk of broken
Berlin Wall in front of cheering Berliners for a special broadcast,
and also reported Friday morning for ``Today.''
   Jennings and Rather flew to Berlin after their Thursday
newscasts from New York.
   ``It's terrific, terrific,'' NBC affiliate board chairman James
R. Sefert said of Thursday's ``NBC Nightly News'' coverage, and the
16-minute late-night special.
   NBC affiliates got a six-page letter from NBC News president
Michael Gartner explaining what went wrong with the network's quake
coverage on Oct. 17 and what has been done to correct problems that
arose.
   Although it later drew praise for its all-night coverage of the
quake story, NBC initially lagged behind its rivals with reports
and pictures from the scene, and for a time broadcast incorrectly
that a second freeway had collapsed in the quake.
   Almost as embarrassing, a number of NBC stations that also are
affiliated with Cable News Network used CNN's live quake coverage
until NBC finally began its all-out coverage from the stricken city.
   Those stations that turned to CNN _ which says it now serves 49
NBC affiliates _ included WTHR-TV in Indianapolis, Ind., whose
vice-president, Michael J. Corken, heads the news subcommittee of
NBC's affiliates board.
   Corken, who said Friday he'd messaged Gartner and NBC president
Robert C. Wright that NBC's Berlin Wall coverage ``is superb,
absolutely superb,'' said he had received Gartner's letter.
   ``The gist of the letter was that a lot of things went wrong
simultaneously and that some are fixable,'' Corken said.
   In his report, Gartner blamed part of the delay on quake damage
that knocked NBC's San Francisco's affiliate, KRON-TV, off the air
longer than other stations, thus delaying NBC's reports from the
scene.
   However, he also said that ``I shoulder whatever blame should
assigned for our not having our top-of-the-line talent readily
available and for not ensuring that the entire staff was up to the
task of handling an emergency.
   ``I have made several changes in these and other areas, and I am
dedicated to ensuring that nothing like this will ever happen
again.''

   Composer Bill Conti, who wrote the ``Rocky''
theme and won an Oscar for the ``The Right Stuff'' score, has the
newest star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
   ``You can't buy a moment like that,'' Conti said of star No.
1,904, planted Friday in the sidewalk on Hollywood Boulevard.
``It's a reward that you remember for a lifetime ... It's more
meaningful than if the movie's a hit.''
   Conti wrote dozens of television and movie themes and scores. He
was first nominated for an Academy Award for his 1976 ``Rocky''
score, and won his Oscar in 1983. More recently, Conti wrote
musical scores for ``Broadcast News,'' ``The Karate Kid'' and
``Baby Boom.''
   At one time, viewers could watch nine weekly television shows _
including ``Dynasty,'' ``Falcon Crest,'' and ``Cagney and Lacey'' _
with Conti-written themes.
   He has appeared as a guest conductor for 25 symphonies worldwide
and has conducted the Academy Awards Orchestra at the Oscar
ceremony five times since 1977.

   Actor Todd Bridges, acquitted this week of
attempted murder in the shooting of a drug dealer, left jail for
the first time since February after a mistrial was declared on the
only other charge he faced.
   Bridges, best known for his role in the former NBC-TV series
``Diff'rent Strokes,'' was released from jail on $25,000 bail
Thursday after the jury failed to reach a verdict on the charge of
assault with a deadly weapon.
   Bridges, 24, was acquitted of attempted murder and attempted
voluntary manslaughter Tuesday.
   He had been in custody since his arrest in early February for
the shooting injury of Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay, a drug dealer's
henchman working out of a Los Angeles house where crack was peddled.
   Superior Court Commissioner Florence-Marie Cooper declared the
mistrial after jurors announced they remained deadlocked 8-4 in
favor of acquittal.
   The prosecution had argued that Bridges shot Clay eight times at
close range in a dispute over the actor's BMW.

   Actress Kelly McGillis will break a one-year
commitment to the Folger Shakespeare Theater on Nov. 19 because she
is pregnant and under doctors' orders not to work, the theater said.
   The theater's artistic director, Michael Kahn, accepted Miss
McGillis' departure ``with deep regret'' but best wishes, he said
Friday. Miss McGillis, who married yacht broker Fred Tillman last
year, is expecting a baby in June.
   The actress will leave after the closing performance of
Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night,'' in which she received rave reviews
for her portrayal of Viola. Her season-long contract had also
called for to appear in Schiller's ``Mary Stuart'' in February and

   A 17-month-old girl whose parents said they
left her alone at home for more than two days last week died of
starvation and severe dehydration due to neglect, an autopsy report
said Friday.
   The parents of the girl, Nicole Wilkerson, told police they left
her alone with a bottle of water on the morning of Nov. 1 and did
not return until about 4 p.m. Nov. 3, The Washington Post said in
Saturday editions.
   A police spokesman said the death was under investigation as a
homicide. Warrants charging involuntary manslaughter were issued
for both parents, Chanin Wilkerson Murray, 19, and Anthony Murray,
22, but police said they had made no arrests.
   The couple said they found the child dead in her crib and called
police when they returned from errands. They had taken their
2-week-old daughter Ebony with them.
   After a hearing, a Superior Court judge placed the couple's
younger child in the custody of city officials, according to
sources quoted by the newspaper.
   Officials could not recall another case in which the sole cause
of death was starvation and dehydration. Last year a 7-week-old
girl died of starvation and head injuries.

<TEXT>
   The new dream of traveling West was
the talk of Bernau. In this sleepy East German town just north of
Berlin the question of the hour was: ``Were you already over
there?''
   This town of 12,000 had its first traffic jam in history Friday,
when local citizens besieged the police station for visas to the
West.
   While hundreds waited patiently for the magic paper, others were
regaling friends with tales of their wild night Thursday in West
Berlin, just 10 miles south.
   ``You really missed something,'' shouted Rene, a 21-year-old in
studded imitation black leather, to a passing friend. ``Grapes as
big as plums, bananas, pineapples, absolutely unbelievable.''
   Rene and his friend Mike, 19, were among the crowd that stormed
across the Bornholmer Strasse crossing from East to West Berlin
that historic night.
   ``That,'' grinned Mike, ``was what I call fun.''
   Back in their own town after the wildest night of their lives,
both youths swore they'd never leave East Germany for good.
   But the sight of Western wealth along the elegant
Kurfuerstendamm had left its mark.
   ``A different world,'' sighed Rene as he and Mike surveyed their
souvenirs of the night _ a West German newspaper with a screaming
headline about the Wall coming down, a pack of Marlboro cigarettes,
and presents from generous, overjoyed West Berliners.
   Around the corner, at the besieged police station, the pleasure
of setting foot in the West was still several hours and a cold wait
away.
   Many of the almost 1,000 people jammed outside the local police
station were unsure the new travel freedom would last. Like the
millions of other citizens of the Soviet bloc, they have heard
enough promises from the Communists to be skeptical.
   ``I don't trust it yet,'' said an elderly lady, who like others
in Bernau was loath to identify herself to a Western reporter.
   But even the caution could not contain people's joy at what one
22-year-old factory worker, Uwe, termed simply: ``liberation.''
   ``It's like being the child who stands in front of the Christmas
tree waiting for the lights to go on, then sees them light up and
spots the drum he always wanted under the tree,'' said a worker in
his 40s. ``Today, we got our drum.''
   As the hundreds waited for visas, the tiny Trabant cars that are
the hallmark of East German roads rolled past, several packed with
happy people waving West Berlin newspapers or their new travel
documents.
   Everybody in East Germany seemed to be on some kind of high
Friday.
   Border guards raised for decades to defend the barbed wire,
trenches and concrete slabs that make up the Berlin Wall watched
almost absent-mindedly as thousands poured past them into the West.
   Where just weeks ago, public conversation was conducted in the
whispers common in states with a strong police presence, laughter
and joy rang out.
   The train from Bernau to East Berlin was packed with young
people in high spirits before their first trip West.
   ``Warst Du schon drueben?'' (Were you already over there?) was
the question ringing out in the train and on Bernau's station
square.
   In East Berlin, flower vendor Hedwig Bruecher, a 65-year-old
widow, noted that almost all her customers wore a happy smile
Friday.
   ``Normally, we all look at each other so bitterly, or are just
plain bored,'' she said. ``But today, everyone's happy. I couldn't
be happier if I'd found 1,000 marks _ and that with a pension of
just 300 marks a month.''
   One of the happiest people in East Berlin Friday was her next
customer, Wolfgang Schmidt.
   ``Buy two bouquets,'' urged Mrs. Bruecher. ``It's a real
holiday.'' ``What do you mean?'' asked Schmidt. ``You really don't
know?'' the incredulous flower vendor responded. ``They've opened
the borders.''
   ``Is that really true? Can that be? We've just come from
Leningrad and we know nothing. They did what? I can't believe it,''
stuttered the amazed Schmidt.
   Some folks in Bernau are still skeptical, however.
   ``Everybody is so suspicious,'' confided a middle-aged woman
outside the police station.
   Three workers who knocked off early from the local heating plant
after drinking a Schnaps or two in honor of the great day seemed to
agree.
   ``Travel _ that doesn't do it,'' said Norbert Them, 49. ``I want
to be able to buy something for my money here.''

   Forget the New York City Marathon with

Short Fat Guys' Road Run.
   The 7th annual running of the 3-mile, downhill race Sunday will
have trucks to carry participants over any section where the grade
is even remotely uphill.
   Relief stations stocked with beer, pastries, candy and cigars
are the big attraction.
   ``You've got to have Twinkies or beer _ something to relax you
part way through,'' said race organizer Dick Perry.
   To qualify, participants' waists must be at least 4{ inches
larger than their inseams. Everyone will be carefully measured
before being allowed to compete, Perry said.
   Last year's race in the village near Syracuse was cancelled
because of what organizers called ``an unfortunate diet and fitness
epidemic.''
   Contrary to its title, organizers said ``females of any

   A Democratic Party committee will visit all
five cities in the running to host the 1992 presidential nominating
convention before deciding how to narrow the list.
   The Democratic National Committee site selection panel ended a
two-day meeting Friday with a ``consensus decision'' to visit all
five cities instead of eliminating some of the contenders as
planned, said chairman Graham T. Allison Jr.
   The five, in the order they will be visited, are Detroit;
Cleveland and suburban Brook Park, Ohio; Houston; New Orleans and
New York.
   ``The committee was so impressed with the seriousness of the
presentations of all five,'' Allison said, ``the committee has
decided unanimously to visit all five cities.''
   Allison said the panel hopes to finish its visits by mid-April
and to decide in May on one city to recommend to Democratic
Chairman Ron Brown.
   He said Brown intends to decide on a convention site by early
summer of next year.
   The committee heard presentations from officials of each of the
cities Thursday and Friday then held private discussions. Allison
announced the committee's decision in a brief public session that
followed.
   Panel members said there were still questions and concerns about
the bids by each of the cities.
   Concerns about sufficient hotel space within close distance to
the convention center, and about adequate transportation, were
raised about Cleveland, Houston and Detroit.
   In the case of New York, there were questions about the adequacy
of Madison Square Garden and whether it would be available far
enough in advance of the convention.
   In addition, there were concerns about space in Manhattan for
satellite-uplink trucks used by television broadcasters.
   Allison said the panel also was concerned about financially
troubled New Orleans' ability to come up with the $15 million
investment each city has been required to commit.
   Houston has offered either the Astrodome or its new George R.
Brown Convention Center. City officials said it might be possible
to reschedule Astros games to allow more time to prepare the
Astrodome for the convention.

<HEAD>Frohnmayer Says Endowment Won't Be `Arts Cop'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arts endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer
says he will strike a balance between ``the public trust and total
artistic freedom'' but doesn't want his agency to become the
government's ``arts cop'' under a new anti-obscenity law.
   ``The endowment funds artistic excellence, and there's a period
at the end of that sentence,'' he said Friday in his first public
speech since taking command of the National Endowment of the Arts a
month ago.
   ``The fundamental point is that art must, and will, speak for
itself. If we fund artistic excellence, we won't have to _ and
shouldn't have to _ apologize for it,'' he said.
   Frohnmayer's remarks were intended to dispel fears within the
arts community that a political furor over federal subsidies for
controversial art will lead to government censorship.
   ``Are we going to be an arts cop?'' he asked. ``The answer is
no.''
   The National Assembly of State Arts Agencies audience applauded
politely as Frohnmayer declared he would balance ``the public trust
and total artistic freedom'' in awarding tax-paid arts grants.
   Frohnmayer defended his decision to withdraw a $10,000 endowment
grant to Artists Space, a private New York City gallery, for an
AIDS art show on the ground that it would violate the new federal
statute.
   ``We ought not to be funding obscenity,'' he said, adding the
endowment should not subsidize ``political polemics'' either.
   Frohnmayer said Wednesday he decided to withdraw the grant to
Artists Space because ``the nature of the show had changed from an
artistic focus to a political focus.''
   At a news conference Friday in Manhattan, Susan Wyatt, executive
director of Artists Space, expressed concern the United States
might be returning to the 1950s era in which artists were
blacklisted for unpopular political views.
   She said an exhibition of East European art at her gallery last
June demonstrated ``the aesthetic poverty of official vs.
unofficial art. I sincerely hope that this country is not moving in
that direction.''
   Frohnmayer said Friday his decision to withhold the endowment
funds from Artists Space was based on ``a serious erosion in the
artistic vision'' of the exhibition since the gallery's grant
application was approved by an NEA panel in February.

<HEAD>Argentina Gets New Loan to Help Cut Old Debts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund will offer a
loan of about $1.4 billion to Argentina's government under new
President Carlos Menem.
   The new loan is to be disbursed over 16 months to one of the
world's biggest and most troubled debtors, the fund's spokesman
said Friday.
   ``This is evidence of the solidity of the Argentine government's
program and will be a clear signal of support by the international
community,'' said Argentine Ambassador Guido di Tella.
   The loan is expected to encourage banks to talk with Argentina
in an attempt to reduce its old debt of $60 billion _ not including
about $4.5 billion of back interest it has failed to pay in recent
months. Debts to U.S. banks may reach $10 billion.
   The spokesman, who gave his information on condition his name
not be used, said details of the fund's offer will be announced on
Monday.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has urged banks, which hold
most of Argentina's debt, to reduce the principal and interest
payments.
   The fund is owned by 152 governments, with the United States
holding the largest voting strength. Their representatives met
behind closed doors. The spokesman said no objections were raised,
although the meeting lasted well beyond usual working hours.
   The fund generally divides its disbursements into ``slices.''
Disbursement is stopped if its conditions are not met.
   Usually the fund imposes strict conditions in return for its
loans, requiring the debtor government to reduce its spending and
domestic borrowing, and often to devalue its currency. Such
measures usually result in reduced government subsidies and other
austerity measures.
   Some measures have already been taken in Argentina. Inflation
was brought down to 5.6 percent for the month of October from 197
percent in July, by devaluation, increases in charges for public
services and guidelines for wages and prices.

   Joachim Maitre, a defector from East Germany and
dean of the College of Communication at Boston University, didn't
think he'd live to see the day East Germans climbed over the Berlin
Wall.
   On Thursday his homeland declared the end of restrictions on
emigration or travel to the West, and thousands of East Germans
walked, ran, biked and drove their way across to West Berlin.
   Young East Berliners straddled the crest of the wall into the
early hours today. Their dancing, champagne drinking and revelry
was watched by millions, including Maitre.
   ``Frankly, I never thought I'd see this,'' Maitre said Friday.
``I'm a skeptic by nature. But the system is crumbling sooner than
I had thought it ever would.''
   As a youth, the 54-year-old Maitre was a political firebrand and
opponent of the government. He he was declared a subversive after
taking part in a June 17, 1953, uprising in East Berlin, and fled
to the West.
   ``I knew I could no longer look forward to a future there,''
Maitre said. He said his own defection was ``uneventful,'' since at
the time it was relatively easy to cross to the West.
   Maitre finished his schooling in West Germany and embarked on a
career in journalism. A staunch anti-communist, he became a foreign
correspondent on defense and strategic issues for conservative
publications in Germany and the United States. He came to this
country in 1983.
   ``Most of my classmates stayed behind,'' he said. ``Today, I
know that for them, the last 30 years or so of their lives will be
satisfactory in terms of liberty. It's an emotional response,
really.''
   Maitre said further reforms were inevitable in East Germany, and
predicted that opposition political parties, which previously
operated only under the auspices of the ruling Communist party,
would have a stronger voice in the future.
   ``They're demanding independence, and they will get it,'' Maitre
said. ``There's no way around reforms now. People are fed up.''

   A 17-month-old girl whose parents said they
left her alone at home for more than two days last week died of
starvation and severe dehydration due to neglect, says an autopsy
report.
   The parents of the baby, Nicole Wilkerson, told police they left
her alone with a bottle of water on the morning of Nov. 1 and did
not return until about 4 p.m. on Nov. 3, The Washington Post said
in Saturday editions.
   A police spokesman said the death was under investigation as a
homicide. Warrants charging involuntary manslaughter were issued
for both parents, Chanin Wilkerson Murray, 19, and Anthony Murray,
22, but police said they had made no arrests.
   The couple said they found the child dead in her crib and called
police when they returned from errands. They had taken their
2-week-old daughter Ebony with them.
   After a hearing, a Superior Court judge placed the couple's
younger child in the custody of city officials, according to
sources quoted by the newspaper.
   Officials could not recall another case in which the sole cause
of death was starvation and dehydration. Last year a 7-week-old
girl died of starvation and head injuries.

<NOTE>Company to Field Test Corn Vaccine</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Maryland company says it will begin field
trials of a plant vaccine that could inoculate corn plants against
an insect that costs U.S. farmers $500 million a year.
   In greenhouse tests, corn borer damage was reduced by 80 percent
in plants inoculated with the naturally occurring microorganism,
according to a statement released Friday by Crop Genetics
International of Hanover, Md.
   ``This is the first time that a plant has been able to grow its
own genetically-engineered pesticide in its vascular system,'' the
company said.
   The borer is a pest on 20 million acres of the U.S. corn crop,
the company said. U.S. farmers annually lose 200 million bushels of
corn worth $500 million to the borer.
   ``If it proves to be effective, if it can be easily used and it
is not too costly it will do Minnesota farmers a lot of good,''
said Ken Ostlie, a University of Minnesota entomologist.
   Minnesota lost an average of $107 million worth of corn to the
borer from 1981 to 1983, years in which borer infestation was
particularly bad, Ostlie said.
   The microorganism, whose scientific name is Bacillus
thuringiensis, is harmless to humans and animals, making it
preferable to chemical pesticides, according to the company, which
specializes in developing biological pesticides.

<NOTE>Georgetown Paper Skips Publication Over Ad For Abortion Rally</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgetown University students have refused to
publish an edition of their newspaper because school officials
forbade them to run an advertisement on an abortion rights rally.
   The Roman Catholic university's stand on the advertisement
prompted swift protests from pro-choice organizations and national
education groups.
   ``The ad was not promoting any specific service,'' said Karl
Hente, a senior who serves as the paper's managing editor. ``The ad
was for a pro-choice rally and was basically expressing a political
viewpoint. The newspaper's foundation is freedom of expression.''
   The twice-weekly Georgetown Hoya had first asked university
officials to review the ad, but when the university was slow to
respond, the paper's student board of directors voted on Wednesday
to include the ad in Friday's edition.
   The school's dean of students, Jack deGioia, then told newspaper
officials that they could not publish the issue with the ad, and
the paper's board responded by voting unanimously not to put out a
paper at all.
   The newspaper did print up and distribute around campus several
thousand flyers explaining the decision not to publish.

   A new kind of currency is showing
up in every corner of this Berkshire Hills town, including the
church collection plate.
   It's called Deli Dollars, a limited local currency devised to
try to help Frank Tortoriello move his eatery.
   With the help of a non-profit group called Share, which promotes
the region's economy, Tortoriello is selling notes redeemable in
sandwiches or other deli fare in 1990. The bagel bucks are in the
form of $10 certificates that sell for $8, or $100 worth for $75.
   ``I think it's a wonderful new capitalist experiment,'' said the
Rev. Charles VanAusdall, who discovered one of the notes rustling
on the collection plate at the First Congregational Church.
   About half of the 500 burgundy-and-cream Deli Dollars printed
were snapped up within the first 10 days they were offered. The
notes can be redeemed next year.
   The idea is for Tortoriello to get money upfront to move his
business to a better site. Loyal customers get a chance to show
support _ and get a break on next year's sandwich bills.
   ``It's really just a gift certificate, but it's (also) people
acknowledging that they can be used more than once, can circulate
more than once,'' said Susan Witt, administrator of Share.
   Dabbling in new forms of currency doesn't seem to be the main
interest of those who buy the coupons from the unpretentious
restaurant that serves breakfasts, deli fare, soups and sandwiches
with names like ``Cool Hand Cuke.''
   Instead, buyers say they want to support an institution in Great
Barrington, a small town dotted with New England clapboard houses
and featuring an 1895 statue of a newsboy at one of the main
intersections.
   ``Frank's a friend and I'm willing to help him out,'' said Ron
White, owner of White Knight Records, which will accept the notes
at face value toward purchases.
   Share officials say it's too soon to gauge the success of Deli
Dollars as an alternative medium of exchange, but claim it could be
a step toward regionally backed financing that could spur local
growth.
   ``One of the problems that you get with U.S. dollars is that
they tend to leave the region rather quickly,'' said Robert Swann.
   The last effort at an alternative currency in New England came
in the 1970s with the introduction of the Constant in Exeter, N.H.
That currency was designed to be inflation-proof, said Swann, who
was involved in the project.
   The Constant was issued by banks in Exeter and was backed by a
mix of 30 widely used commodities. The safeguard against inflation
was that if one commodity went up, it could be offset by a decrease
in others.
   Although the idea never really took root, from 1972 to 1974
about 200 people converted about $100,000 into Constants through
local trade.
   Share would like to see something similar in the Berkshires.
   ``We're not advocating a departure from national currency,''
said Witt. ``We would like to suggest that regions could create
their own currency based on something of value in that area.''
   Share is accepting Deli Dollars at face value for membership in
their organization. Tortoriello said he'll also be using them as
partial payment to contractors who will be doing some of the
renovations involved in the move.
   For VanAusdall, who wrote up the project in his church
newsletter, the idea of an alternate exchange could work in a town
where ``we're all friends and neighbors.''
   ``I think people do see a potential here for something bigger
and something that could affect all of us in more ways,'' he said.

<HEAD>Inventor Awarded Millions in `Hot Wheels' Patent Infringement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerome Lemelson has spent decades inventing
gadgets in his Princeton, N.J., home.
   But it was in a Chicago courtroom this week that Lemelson may
have seen his biggest success _ a multi-million dollar vindication
of a decade-long patent infringement suit against toymaker Mattel
Inc.
   Lemelson, a prolific inventor with more than 400 creations to
his credit, was awarded $24.8 million in damages for Mattel's
``willful'' infringement on Lemelson's patent, a flexible track
that's part of the company's ``Hot Wheels'' toy system.
   ``I am floating on cloud nine,'' Lemelson, 66, said Friday. ``My
hope is that as a result of it (the decision), toy inventors will
get a fair shake from the industry.''
   The $24.8 million could be increased substantially by U.S.
District Judge Charles Kocoras, who has the discretion under
federal law to triple the award and to determine the amount of
interest Mattel must pay.
   A final ruling from Kocoras is due within the next couple of
weeks, Lemelson's attorneys said.
   In any case, Hawthorne, Calif.-based Mattel said it would appeal.
   ``There are differences in Mattel's track from the patent,''
said company spokesman Glenn Bozarth.
   Hot Wheels, which glide on flexible tracks, ramps, jumps and
loops, brought in $545 million in sales between 1972 and 1986, only
6 percent of which is based on the sale of tracks, Bozarth said.
The toy is Mattel's most popular offering after Barbie dolls.
   Lemelson, a self-described ``tinkerer,'' has spent his life
putting creative ideas into action.
   Working out of an office in his Princeton, N.J., home, Lemelson
is responsible for gadgets that run the gamut from parts for
fighter planes to inflatable children's equipment.
   His latest creation _ a ``talking thermometer'' for the blind _
is due on the market later this year, he said.
   Lemelson filed suit against Mattel in 1977 in Chicago, selected
for the reputation of its circuit court for finding in favor of
inventors. The lawsuit alleged the toymaker infringed on Lemelson's
1969 patent for the Hot Wheels track.
   Lemelson said he filed papers on his creation with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office in the mid-1960s, some time before
Mattel's 1968 introduction of Hot Wheels.
   Mattel attorneys had argued the company's Hot Wheels differed
conceptually from Lemelson's patent and were developed
independently.

<TEXT>
   High-level delegations from the Soviet Union
and United States will meet next week to explore ways of expanding
trade as a prelude to the December summit between President Bush
and President Mikhail Gorbachev,
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher will lead the U.S.
delegation in the talks Wednesday and Thursday at the Commerce
Department. The Soviet side will be headed by Konstantin F.
Katushev, Soviet minister of foreign economic relations.
   One of the items on the agenda for discussion will be the Soviet
push for waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment that imposes tariffs
on Soviet imports coming into the United States that are generally
five to 10 times higher than tariffs imposed on other countries.
   Bush announced last May that he would ask Congress to remove the
Soviet Union from the Jackson-Vanik tariff restrictions if the
Soviets put Gorbachev's more liberal emigration policies into law
and followed through with successful implementation of the new
policies.
   More than 50,000 Jews have already been allowed to leave the
Soviet Union this year and the Supreme Soviet is expected to pass a
new emigration law by the end of this month.
   Because of these developments, there is wide speculation Bush
will soon propose a waiver of Jackson-Vanik, a move favored by many
members of Congress and by various Jewish groups.
   ``In the present climate, Bush will get all the support he needs
for such a move,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif.
   David Harris of the American Jewish Committee said, ``If the
president feels he has assurances from the Soviets that impediments
to free emigration will be removed and the continued high numbers
will be allowed out, we will support a waiver.''
   The Commerce Department trade talks are coming just two weeks
before the U.S.-Soviet Mediterranean summit scheduled for Dec. 2-3.
Officials said the discussions could set the stage for
announcements by Bush and Gorbachev, although they cautioned it was
too early to speculate on the outcome of the negotiations.
   One administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said in addition to Jackson-Vanik, the Commerce
Department session would cover such issues as U.S. export controls
on shipments of high-technology items and the Soviet Union's bid
for admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
worldwide body governing trade.
   The Commerce talks are formally known as the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint
Commercial Commission, a group set up in 1972 to promote trade
between the two nations. The discussions have been held annually
since then except for a period in the early 1980s when they were
suspended after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
   So far this year, trade between the United States and the Soviet
Union totals $3.6 billion. U.S. export sales to the Soviet Union,
primarily agricultural products, amounted to $3.1 billion, while
Soviet sales to America totaled $502 million, giving the United
States a trade surplus with the Soviet Union of $2.6 billion.

   East German workers early Saturday punched through
the Berlin Wall, lifting a section of concrete panel to create a
6-foot gap, the first hole in the fortification that has divided
East and West for nearly 30 years.
   On Friday, East Germany ended all border restrictions, and more
than 100,000 jubilant East Germans climbed over and rushed through
borders for the first time since 1961. They chatted amiably with
stony-faced guards who no longer have orders to open fire.
   Thousands crossed back and forth during the day. West German
television showed East German guards helping East Berliners climb
over the wall to avoid congested check points. Some border guards
were handed roses by beaming girls.
   Communist leader Egon Krenz told 150,000 people at a rally in
East Berlin that his new reforms ``will not be turned back.'' The
party's Central Committee approved a document calling for free
elections, more restrictions on its security forces and greater
separation of party and state.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany flew to West Berlin
hoping to speak with Krenz, who has stunned the world with rapid
reforms _ and a pledge of free elections _ intended to appease
pro-democracy protesters and end emigration to the West.
   Work began late Friday at the Bernauer Strasse.
   East Germans used a hydraulic crane to dismantle the round top
of the concrete wall. East German workers could be heard knocking
on the wall.
   Peter Zeisler, a West German police official at the scene, said:
``It will be a pretty hole that will make it possible for people
and cars to come through.''
   When the barrier was finally broken through early Saturday, East
German border guards and West German police shook hands. Then other
East German guards immediately placed a flimsy red-and-white metal
barrier in front of the opening.
   On the Western side of the wall, dozens of firemen dismantled
observation platforms from which West Berliners used to gaze
across. About 400 people watched, occasionally setting off
fireworks.
   ``We are speechless,'' said Helmut Keuchel, 48. ``This is a
fabulous and overwhelming experience.''
   Several thousand people celebrated at the Brandenburg Gate, the
great monument that, like the wall, was a symbol of Berlin's
division. Many danced on the wall, drank champagne, waved
sparklers, set off fireworks and chanted: ``The wall must go! The
wall must go!''
   East German border guards watched impassively as some in the
crowd used picks and hammers to chip away pieces of the hated
barrier for souvenirs.
   Thousands of East Berliners poured across the Glienicker Bridge,
on which some of the most famous spy trades took place, when it was
opened in the early evening.
   In West Berlin, thousands more streamed along the elegant
Kurfuerstendamm shopping boulevard, some carrying candles, others
toasting each other. Crowds of young girls could be seen rushing
down the street toward stores. Bars offered free drinks to East
Berliners.
   Police in West Berlin said they gave up counting Friday when
they reached 50,000 visitors.
   Krenz told those at the rally that ``the best of our people must
be elected to Parliament.'' He said reforms would make ``a new
revolution on German soil'' that would produce a communist system
``economically effective, politically democratic, and morally
pure.''
   ``These are not empty promises,'' he declared, addressing the
skepticism of those who have questioned his sincerity.
   Communist officials said Thursday that, for the first time since
the Berlin Wall was built, citizens could travel freely to the West
until a new travel law was drafted. On Friday, they made the open
border permanent.
   ``It is permanent and will be the foundation of a new travel
law,'' Interior Minister Friedrich Dickel said on state television.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany told
20,000 cheering people outside the West Berlin city hall the East
Germans were cutting more holes in the wall and were expanding the
Glienicker Bridge crossing. Bells, some called them freedom bells,
rang in the background.
   Chancellor Kohl said: ``The spirit of freedom now reigns all
over Europe: Poland, Hungary, and now, East Germany. We claim this
right for all people in Europe. ... we claim it for all Germans ''
   President Bush said he would ``seize every chance'' to promote
democracy in Eastern Europe and his meeting next month in Malta
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will have
``even more importance.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III called the lifting of East
German travel restrictions ``the most dramatic event in East-West
relations'' since World War II, but added: ``There's a long way to
go before there is true freedom and true political pluralism in
East Germany.''
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
opening East Germany's borders would help stem emigration and end
``stereotypes about the Iron Curtain.''
   East Germans arrived in cars or taxis, on motorcycles, by foot
for their first taste of the West. Most apparently planned to
return home.
   East German roads were clogged with cars heading for the border,
but West German border officials said only about one-tenth of the
visitors planned to stay. So far this year, more than 200,000 East
Germans have gone to West Germany.
   People thronged East German police stations, waiting for the
travel passes officials said nearly everyone would be given.
Thousands went through simply by getting a stamp at a border
control point, and many crossed without special documents.
   ``We've just decided to leave our jobs for a little while, have
a look around and then go back over,'' said a young man who visited
Herleshausen with four compatriots. ``We don't know what our boss
will say about that. Perhaps he's over here too.''
   A young man drove to Herleshausen with his child for 15 minutes
just to buy a West German newspaper.
   ``I'm going over to pick up some brake pads you can only get in
the West,'' said a motorcyclist who crossed crossed at Helmstedt.
   In Berlin, many East Germans just wanted to shop or see the
sights. A group of East German workers took turns.
   ``Everybody wanted to go so we decided to do it in shifts,'' one
said. ``We're still fulfilling our quota of work.''
   Usually dour East German border guards chatted with countrymen
filing through border control points.
   ``You don't have to work today?'' one asked a young man at the
Invalidenstrasse crossing in Berlin.
   ``No, I've got the day off,'' was the reply.
   The ruling Politburo fired four more officials and began an
investigation of ``gross mistakes'' made by the leadership under
Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old party boss dismissed Oct. 18.
Honecker supervised the building of the wall 10 years before
becoming party chief.

   Descendants of German immigrants cheered the
new breach in the Berlin Wall, raising their glasses in restaurants
and clubs that show the heavy German influence on this Midwestern
city.
   East Germany announced Friday it was permanently lifting travel
restrictions on its citizens, and workers today began knocking new
holes in the Berlin Wall.
   While Irene Blau, director of the Deutschstadt Heritage
Foundation, said the sight of Berliners dancing on the wall
``brought tears to my eyes,'' others celebrated heartily.
   Jerry Grosenick, the grandson of a German immigrant and owner of
Jerry's Old Town Inn in suburban Germantown, served up a beverage
he called the ``Commie Pig,'' to go with the restaurant's
German-style pork ribs.
   As many as half of the 1.4 million residents of the Milwaukee
area have German roots, said Dr. Ernst Edlhauser, executive
director of the Goethe Institute in Milwaukee.
   For the last half century, the German community in Milwaukee has
held an annual lakefront ethnic festival and has many social groups
in the community. Many of the leading business and political
figures are of German descent.
   Many Germans moved to the Milwaukee area around 1870, Edlhauser
said, and were involved initially in brewing and farming. Land
conditions in the Midwest were similar to those in Germany.
   ``They were hard-working, energetic people that were very
inventive,'' he said.
   Victor Mader, owner of Mader's German Restaurant in Milwaukee,
said his grandfather, Charles Mader, brought a strong work ethic
with him when he came to Milwaukee in the 1890s. Today the family
restaurant has become a Milwaukee landmark and popular dining spot
for business people.
   ``My father always thought about the restaurant when he wasn't
here,'' Mader said. ``I'm the same way now. I consider myself
aggressive and I think my father instilled that in me.
   ``What causes it? Personality? The German ethic? I don't know,''
he said.
   Edlhauser said better living conditions and greater freedoms are
the two reasons most East Germans will leave their country. But he
doesn't expect all residents to get up and move.
   ``Those in their forties or upwards with families will probably
think twice about leaving,'' he said. ``The younger people are a
different story.... People are just satifisfied that they can move
from one country to another.''
   ``Many people going to West Germany are just trying to see if
it's real,'' Blau said.
   ``I don't think the wall will ever come down completely,''
Edlhauser said. ``For the future, there will still be two Germanys.
Maybe in the long run we'll see more political freedom and possibly
free elections.''

<HEAD>Bush Wants Low-Income Housing _ With Capital Gains Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, accused by Democrats of favoring
tax relief for the rich, is trying to link his drive for a capital
gains tax cut to a new package of housing aid for the homeless.
   Bush unveiled a $4.2 billion package of housing initiatives in a
speech Friday before the National Association of Realtors.
   ``I'm calling on Congress to renew the low-income housing tax
credit, but make it part of a package that also includes the cut in
the capital gains tax,'' the president said in introducing his new
initiative HOPE, or Home Ownership and Opportunity for People
Everywhere.
   Bush gave no inkling of how he planned to pay for his housing
initiative, which would cost $4.2 billion in direct expenditures
over three years plus ``several billions'' in foregone federal
taxes, according to Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack
Kemp.
   But Kemp claimed that if Congress would reduce the capital gains
levy to 15 percent from the 28 percent to 33 percent range,
Treasury revenues would shoot up $20 billion next year.
   Democrats dispute that, saying it would cost taxpayers in the
long run.
   Kemp said the ``several billions'' extra in the housing package
would go to pay for extending the low-income housing credit as well
as other tax breaks for housing. First-time homebuyers, for
example, would be allowed to withdraw $10,000 from Individual
Retirement Accounts without penalty.
   Bush proposed $2.15 billion in grants to help low-income
families buy units in public housing buildings or vacant or
foreclosed properties. State and local governments or non-profit
groups would have to kick in $1 for every $2 in federal money to
qualify for the grants.
   Bush said his aim is ``to recapture the American dream for home
ownership for those who have been left behind.''
   He thanked the Realtors for their backing in the capital gains
battle and said, ``That fight is not over.'' The House passed a
capital gains cut, but Democratic leaders have blocked a vote in
the Senate.
   Bush's housing package includes $1.075 billion for tenants to
convert and rehabilitate federally subsidized housing into
resident-owned cooperatives. Tenant groups would have the first
right to buy buildings whose owners leave the low-income housing
programs. About 334,000 units would be affected by that provision
in the next 15 years.
   It also would provide $210 million for insurance and rental
rehabilitation grants in 50 ``housing opportunity zones'' in urban
and rural pockets of poverty.
   It would target $44 million for a demonstration project to set
up ``service-supported housing for the frail elderly'' that would
give them both housing vouchers and assistance to pay for drug and
alcohol treatment, mental health care and other services. It also
would link some housing grants to a requirement that local
authorities provide those services.
   Kemp called Bush's package ``the most dramatic effort ... to
combat poverty, homelessness and despair that this nation has seen
from any recent president _ certainly any Republican president.''

   Residents salvaged what they could from the
rubble of an apartment complex engulfed in flames by the crash of a
Navy jet, and a pregnant woman injured in the crash died, raising
the death count to two.
   About 30 people left homeless by the accident returned Friday to
save what belongings they could among scorched furniture,
appliances and bedsprings, as friends and spectators milled around
outside the complex.
   Vans filled with residents, evacuated after the jet slammed into
the buildings late Thursday, were allowed to enter the apartments
to retrieve personal items.
   A nearby motel was offering free lodging for those left homeless.
   Thomas Andrews, 34, said he and his wife would be forced to
start over.
   ``It's leveled,'' he said. ``It looks like somebody dropped a
nuclear bomb on it. I guess we'll have to rebuild, but there are
things we can't recover.''
   One body was found in the kitchen of an apartment early Friday.
Cobb County Medical Examiner Joseph Burton withheld the man's
identity. Smyrna Mayor Max Bacon said the apartment was incinerated
in the fire.
   Smyrna City Administrator John Patterson said authorities doubt
any other victims will be found inside the demolished apartments.
   Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn Jr., the only person aboard the A-7E
Corsair II attack plane, was reported in critical condition Friday.
   The pregnant woman, 28-year-old Margie Padovani, died of severe
burns at Grady Memorial Hospital.
   Her 5-year-old daughter, Jacquelyn, was in critical condition
with burns over about half of her body, said hospital spokesman Jim
Driscoll.
   A third resident of the apartments was treated for cracked ribs,
and officials said a military rescue worker broke an ankle.
   Reporters taken on a tour of the apartment complex Friday were
shown an aircraft part that was driven six feet into the ground by
the jet's explosion.
   Fonda Paulsen, 21, was among those who arrived early in the day
anxiously awaiting permission from authorities to return to her
apartment. She filled only two laundry baskets before she broke
into tears and left in her car.
   The Pine Village Apartment Complex had 76 units, of which 44
were unaffected by the crash. Of the 12 destroyed and 20 damaged,
three were vacant at the time of the accident, said Kathie Barton,
Smyrna's director of community relations.
   Mary White, 31, found her soot-filled apartment intact, but said
she planned to move anyway.
   ``You can hear the planes on the weekend, they were really loud,
but you never think about them coming down,'' she said.
   The jet struck the edge of a building before smashing into a car
and coming to rest by a chain-link fence about 30 yards away, said
Smyrna police officer Frank Durrance.
   ``It's completely burned. It's just a big piece of metal ... The
car was completely burned. You could tell it was a car, but you
can't tell that it was a plane,'' Durrance said.
   The unarmed fighter crashed 2.5 miles short of the runway at
Dobbins Air Force Base, 15 miles north of Atlanta, where Conlyn
attempted to land while on a navigational training mission, the
Navy said.
   Conlyn, a Navy reserve officer who works as a co-pilot for Delta
Airlines, suffered a skull fracture when his ejection seat slammed
into a street near the apartment complex.
   Capt. Peter Hunt, commander of the Naval Air Station, said the
Navy lacked leads to the crash's cause, but added that the pilot
hadn't reported any trouble to flight controllers.
   ``Whatever happened, happened suddenly,'' Hunt said.

<HEAD>Report: D'Amato Urged Approval of Buffalo Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato urged the federal
housing secretary to approve a multimillion-dollar grant for a
housing renovation project operated in part by two of the senator's
supporters, according to a report published today.
   In a March 15, 1984, letter, D'Amato, R-N.Y., asked
then-Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce to
use ``deliberate speed'' in approving the project in Buffalo, The
New York Times said in today's editions.
   The 65-unit project was approved within two months, the Times
said.
   The hand-delivered letter, written on D'Amato's Washington
office stationery, appeared to contradict D'Amato's repeated
assertions that he never asked HUD officials to approve specific
rehabilitation projects, the Times said.
   A statement released by D'Amato's office Friday said: ``It is a
matter of public record that the senator and his office have
supported thousands of applications based solely on merit and need.
No other factors were considered.''
   One of two such projects approved in Buffalo in 1984 was granted
to Cherrystone Associates, whose partners included Angelo Sedita
and Peter Elia. The two men, and Cherrystone's lawyer Anthony
Colucci, have donated at least $11,800 to D'Amato since 1984, the
Times said.
   Sedita didn't respond to a telephone message left at his
business by the Times. Elia didn't respond to a message the paper
left with his son, Robert.
   When the project was approved in May 1984, a copy of an approval
letter went to D'Amato _ the only elected official designated by
HUD to receive its letter about the Buffalo project, the Times said.
   The Buffalo project is the most recent in a series of
disclosures linking D'Amato with HUD projects that benefited his
relatives, friends or campaign contributors, the Times said.

<TEXT>
   Andrew Wyeth's ``Helga'' collection of paintings
and drawings and a second group of Wyeth works were sold to an
international group of collectors for more than $40 million.
   Art collector Leonard E.B. Andrews, who bought the Helga series
in 1986, said Friday the collection will tour Japan for a year
beginning in January before the new owners take possession.
   The purchasing group intends to keep the collection intact,
according to a release announcing the sale.
   ``I think it is absolutely the most significant body of work of
a living American artist,'' Andrews said. ``It's one of the finest
body of works you'll ever see.''
   Andrews declined to reveal how much he was paid for the
collections. But Peter J. Marcelle, owner of Marcelle Fine Art of
New York, which handled the sale, said the works sold for between
$40 million and $45 million. Marcelle refused to give the exact
price.
   Andrews, of Newtown Square, Pa., exhibited the Helga collection
around the country, attracting more than 1 million viewers. He said
he hoped the new owners would take the collections around the world.
   The Helga collection, executed in secret from 1971 to 1985, was
unveiled in 1986 with much publicity. The 240 watercolors,
paintings and drawings, many of them nudes, depict Helga Testorf, a
neighbor of Wyeth's in Chadds Ford, Pa.
   Andrews, who bought the collection in 1986 for an undisclosed
amount, put it up for sale in February.
   The other group of works is the Olson collection, 290 drawings
and sketches that Andrews said he purchased from Arthur and Holly
Magill of Greenville, S.C., for ``several million dollars'' in
August.
   The collection includes pencil, ink, watercolor and charcoal
studies, and one tempera on panel, dating from 1939 to the early
1970s. Sixteen studies show Wyeth's process leading up to
``Christina's World,'' Wyeth's best-known painting, now in the
Museum of Modern Art in New York.

<HEAD>New Leader Promises Reform, Not Pluralism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's foreign minister took over
from longtime Communist leader Todor Zhivkov with promises of
political reform, but he also indicated the party has no intention
of sharing power.
   Zhivkov, who led Bulgaria through the Cold War and made it an
impenetrable part of the Iron Curtain, resigned Friday in the
latest political upheaval in the Soviet bloc.
   Zhivkov, 78, was the Soviet bloc's longest-serving party leader
when he stepped down at a meeting of the policy-setting Central
Committee. He served as Communist Party head for 35 years, during
which he molded Bulgaria into one of the Kremlin's most loyal
allies.
   Petar Mladenov, the new leader, is considered a relative
moderate whose stands have sometimes nettled hard-liners. In his
inaugural speech, he pledged a free flow of information and
guaranteed human rights, but gave few details.
   He also indicated he would tolerate some opposition.
   ``We should not worry nor should we be scared by the fact that
at seeking ... right solutions there can and surely will be
pluralism in the opinions,'' he said. His remarks were reported by
BTA, the official Bulgarian news agency.
   However, Mladenov said all decisions and political developments
may occur ``only within the framework of Socialism and on the road
of Socialism,'' making it clear he does not intend for the
Bulgarian Communists to share power.
   Mladenov, 53, was foreign minister for the past 18 years.
   Zhivkov's resignation followed by weeks the removal of
77-year-old Erich Honecker in East Germany, where mass emigration
and protest have propelled breathtaking change. It leaves Nicolae
Ceausescu of Romania as the last old guard Communist still reigning
in Eastern Europe.
   In addition to leaving as party chief, Zhivkov stepped down from
the 10-member ruling Politburo and asked to be released as
president, a ceremonial post.
   A new president was to be elected by the National Assembly,
Bulgaria's parliament, next week. That body also is likely to
undergo some personnel changes.
   Zhivkov gained ultimate power as Communist Party chief in 1954
with the help of Bulgarian supporters of Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin, who died the year before. Dogmatic and conservative,
Zhivkov displayed a gift for smoothing over party dissent. He
consolidated power partly by purging opponents.
   Mladenov, who suffered a heart attack a few years ago, was
earlier rumored to be seeking the post of chairman of the National
Assembly, a less strenuous job than that of foreign minister.
   But a source familiar with the government, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said he appears to have recovered sufficiently to
take the most important office in the country.
   Mladenov is likely select a new set of top officials and have
them confirmed at another Central Committee session within the next
three weeks, the same source said.
   He indicated he plans to make personnel changes in Bulgaria, but
he acknowledged, ``The struggle will be very severe.''
   Bulgaria under Zhivkov paid lip-service to change, but the
leadership has resisted the broad political reforms already seen in
Poland and Hungary and possibly coming to East Germany.
   Mladenov said Friday the party must seek the support of the
people if it hoped to carry out necessary economic changes,
declaring, ``No initiative can survive if it is not fully backed up
by society.''
   He said that in efforts to provide ``full glasnost, ... we must
not only give more freedom of speech ... to the press but . .. full
freedom of all information.''
   ``We have to turn Bulgaria into a contemporary democratic and
law-abiding country,'' he said.
   He also made a promise of legislation on human rights but gave
few details. It was not clear what impact his plans would have on
the dozen or so small, independent groups seeking official
recognition in Bulgaria.

   A General Motors Corp. executive
and his wife were shot to death and dumped in a park in what
authorities said was a robbery. The bodies of Glenn E. Tarr, 53,
and Wanda Tarr, 58, were discovered Friday in nearby Pontiac by a
woman who was walking her dog, said Hal Helterhoff, who heads FBI
operations in Michigan.
   Mrs. Tarr apparently was abducted Thursday evening, forced to
withdraw cash from a 24-hour bank machine and then forced to go to
her home, Helterhoff said.
   ``By 9:06 p.m. at least, Mrs. Tarr was already in trouble and
Mr. Tarr was subsequently in trouble,'' Oakland County Sheriff's
Lt. Gerald Carlin said. The cash withdrawal occurred at 9:06 p.m.
   Neighbors alerted police to a possible robbery at the couple's
home at around 5:30 a.m. Friday because the garage doors were open
and the lights on, Carlin said.
   ``We do not believe they were shot at the home,'' Helterhoff
said. ``They were shot somewhere between the house and the park.''
   There was no sign of forced entry or of a struggle at the house,
Helterhoff said.
   It was unclear at what point, or how, Tarr had been seized or
when the apartment was ransacked.
   No arrests were made by early today. Helterhoff and Carlin said
at least two people were involved in the slayings.
   Guns, liquor, jewelry and part of a coin collection were taken
from the home, Carlin said. The couple's two cars, a 1989 Geo Prizm
and a 1988 Chevrolet Cavalier, also were missing.
   Helterhoff said the FBI was questioning neighbors and relatives
and had talked with two of the couple's five children, none of whom
lived at their parent's home.
   Glenn Tarr, a 25-year GM employee, was assistant manager of
marketing information and research for the Chevrolet Division
headquarters in Warren, said GM spokesman Jim Crellin.
   Ralph Kramer, director of public relations for GM's Chevrolet
Division, said Glenn Tarr supervised the collection and analysis of
sales data from across the country for Chevrolet.

   Thousands of East Berliners went on a shopping
spree on the other side of the Berlin Wall with about $50 in
``welcome money,'' compliments of West Germany.
   For many of the East Berliners who streamed across the border
Friday, it was their first sight of the West _ day trippers making
history.
   ``I was 4 when the Berlin Wall went up (in 1961),'' said East
Berliner Ellen Schmidt, who had tears in her eyes as she waited on
a bank line in West Berlin.
   ``I've never skipped work before, but I couldn't help it today.
I just had to come _ it's a chance. It's amazing. Just amazing.''
   Stefan Needack, a 27-year-old carpenter from East Berlin, stood
in the Wertheim department store on West Berlin's elegant
Kurfuerstendamm shopping street. He was trying to decide whether to
buy perfume for his girlfriend, splurge on new clothes or just look.
   ``I've waited for this day all my life. Coming here, it's like
learning to walk again,'' he said.
   Outside the store, hundreds of other East Germans milled around
with West Berliners, staring up at a building with the sign ``Hello
neighbors from East Berlin. Welcome to Berlin!''
   Banks, which normally close at 1 p.m. on Fridays, stayed open
through the early evening, dispensing a gift of 100 West German
marks (about $50) in ``welcome money'' to each arrival, from
toddlers in strollers to grandparents.
   The West German government for years has been giving the money
to all East Germans to help them cover the cost of their trips,
since East German marks are not convertible.
   Each of the East Berliners who crossed got the money simply by
presenting their identity card or filling out a form. Their
documents were stamped to show they'd received the one-time payment.
   Bank clerks moved up and down the lines handing out forms,
telling surprised young mothers that babies were eligible too,
shaking hands and moving on to the next ones.
   ``It would take me two months to earn enough to buy this amount
of West German money at home,'' said Anna-Katherine Schwartz, 26,
who arrived on a commuter train with her husband and baby.
   For the couple, who run a small business selling plants in East
Berlin, it was their first sight of the West.
   Like most others interviewed while waiting at banks, shopping at
stores or just strolling, they'd come just for the day.
   Mrs. Schwartz said the family had thought of trying to leave
East Germany permanently. But she said that now, just knowing they
can come easily makes the prospect less enticing.
   ``East Germany is still home. We have a lot of social security
there. It's different here,'' she said. ``The best would be one
Germany.''
   As part of the welcome to the East Berliners, some stores posted
notices announcing customers could pay in East German marks _ a
battered currency not normally exchangeable in the West.
   However, the official rate was 10 East German marks for one West
German mark.
   Needack, the carpenter from East Berlin, earns 750 East German
marks a month. He changed a third of a month's paycheck and it paid
only for a scarf.

   An emergency room nurse was fired for accidentally
sticking another nurse with a needle that had been used on a
patient with AIDS, according to a published report.
   Esther Bauer, a spokeswoman for Parkland Memorial Hospital, on
Friday would say only that an unidentified nurse was fired recently
for ``gross negligence'' because she failed to follow hospital
procedures.
   Jody Lain of Grand Prairie told The Dallas Morning News that she
was the nurse fired for the Sept. 26 incident.
   Ms. Lain said she had drawn blood from a pregnant woman who
carried the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. Ms.
Lain said she was carrying two tainted needles to a needle disposal
container mounted on a wall when another nurse bumped her from
behind.
   ``We both were kind of knocked sideways,'' Ms. Lain said. ``The
needle in my left hand went into her right arm. She laughed about
it until I told her the patient was HIV-positive. Then she got
hysterical.''
   The hospital fired her three days later, Ms. Lain said.

   Mrs. Dukakis was treated for alcoholism earlier this year at a

   A judge ordered doctors to turn off
the life-support system for a comatose 13-year-old girl despite her
mother's wish that she be kept alive until her brother can return
from abroad to say goodbye.
   After an emotional hour-long hearing, state District Judge Jack
E. Hunter ruled Friday that Djahna Iolani Vogler's support system
could be turned off so doctors could recover organs for transplant
operations.
   The girl's father, Tx Paul Delmar Vogler of Houston, had sought
the order.
   Hunter's ruling was sent to the hospital by fax machine and the
system was disconnected. The teen-ager died a short time later and
some of her organs were recovered by an organ bank, officials said.
   The girl was being treated for an overdose of an anti-depressant
she ingested Monday at a home for psychologically disturbed youths.
   The girl had been comatose since being brought to the DeTar
Hospital in Victoria, 50 miles north of Corpus Christi, and doctors
Thursday declared her brain dead.
   ``There's no way to say how long those organs will be viable,''
Dr. Richard Sawyers testified over a telephone speaker in the
Corpus Christi courtroom. ``She could have a heart attack or kidney
failure.''
   Djahna's mother, Terry Sue Vogler of Corpus Christi, had asked
Hunter to keep Djahna on life support until Mrs. Vogler's son,
Steven, stationed with the Army in West Germany, could return.
   ``He said, `Mama, I'm coming home ... don't let them do anything
until I get there,''' Mrs. Vogler told the judge.
   Mrs. Vogler, who didn't oppose the organ donation, wept as
Hunter issued the ruling.
   ``The court must look at the overall picture,'' Hunter said.
``The only reason the child is alive now is because of the
respirator. The heart, liver and kidneys will give life to another
individual.
   ``Mrs. Vogler, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the entire family.''
   Steven Vogler, 22, apparently arrived home to Corpus Christi
Friday night, some hours after the hearing.
   Djahna had overdosed on desipramine, an anti-depressant. She had
been living at the Devereux Foundation, a private psychiatric
treatment facility where she was placed last summer on the
recommendation of a doctor who said she suffered from depression.
   Her parents were divorced almost nine years ago. The teen-ager
was in the legal custody of her father.

   Twenty-five years ago, a concerned mother made
tape recordings of textbooks to help her partly blind daughter
through college.
   Her labor of love grew into Educational Tape Recording for the
Blind Inc., one of the hundreds of U.S. companies that enable the
blind to hear the books they cannot see.
   Through the volunteer efforts of that concerned mother _ ETR
founder Vivette Ravel Rifkin _ and a group of retirees, the service
has a library of thousands of taped books, from Shakespeare to
software texts, bringing the printed word to disabled students
across the country and overseas.
   ``I give those people at Educational Tape Recording my absolute
highest recommendation possible,'' said John Bierdz, 29, a visually
impaired high school teacher in Elgin who says he owes his
undergraduate and master's degrees to them.
   ``There's no way I could have done any of this without their
help,'' he said.
   Mrs. Rifkin started the business in 1964 with $500 and 50 reels
of tape, finding volunteer readers through ads at local churches
and libraries.
   Since then, the service has recorded about 20,000 textbooks for
7,000 students, she said in a recent interview from ETR's Southwest
Side headquarters.
   For a $20 yearly fee, students who register with the service can
have all the textbooks they want recorded.
   ETR's 125 readers _ mostly retired professionals with expertise
in fields related to the books they record _ are all volunteers.
   ``I love it,'' said Edna Wessendorf, a retired government budget
officer who's been an ETR reader for 11 years. ``I'm handicapped,
I'm on crutches ... I feel like I'm doing something worthwhile for
somebody.''
   The 35 office workers who help maintain ETR's 10,000-tape
library and run its gift shop also are volunteers. The store's
entire inventory is donated, and its proceeds are the operation's
major source of revenue.
   Mrs. Rifkin, ETR's unsalaried chief, has recorded books for the
service every day since she started it.
   ETR is one of about 500 small operations offering taped books in
the United States, said John Kelly, director of library services
for Recording for the Blind.
   Princeton, N.J.-based RFB _ with an $8 million budget and
thousands of volunteers _ is one of the three giants in the field,
along with the National Library Service for the Blind and
Physically Handicapped and the American Printing House for the
Blind, Kelly said.
   Mrs. Rifkin entered the field in the 1960s, when she recorded
nearly all the textbooks her partly blind daughter, Gerlyn, used at
the University of Missouri while earning a degree in special
education for the orthopedically handicapped.
   Gerlyn and Mrs. Rifkin's son, Jeremy Rifkin, an environmental
activist, plan to speak at ETR's 25th anniversary celebration today.

   A General Motors Corp. executive
and his wife were shot to death and dumped in a park in what
authorities said was a robbery. The bodies of Glenn E. Tarr, 53,
and Wanda Tarr, 58, were discovered Friday in nearby Pontiac by a
woman who was walking her dog, said Hal Helterhoff, who heads FBI
operations in Michigan.
   Mrs. Tarr apparently was abducted Thursday evening, forced to
withdraw cash from a 24-hour bank machine and then forced to go to
her home, Helterhoff said.
   ``By 9:06 p.m. at least, Mrs. Tarr was already in trouble and
Mr. Tarr was subsequently in trouble,'' Oakland County Sheriff's
Lt. Gerald Carlin said. The cash withdrawal occurred at 9:06 p.m.
   Neighbors alerted police to a possible robbery at the couple's
home at around 5:30 a.m. Friday because the garage doors were open
and the lights on, Carlin said.
   ``We do not believe they were shot at the home,'' Helterhoff
said. ``They were shot somewhere between the house and the park.''
   There was no sign of forced entry or of a struggle at the house,
Helterhoff said.
   It was unclear at what point, or how, Tarr had been seized or
when the apartment was ransacked.
   No arrests were made by early today. Helterhoff and Carlin said
at least two people were involved in the slayings.
   Guns, liquor, jewelry and part of a coin collection were taken
from the home, Carlin said. The couple's two cars, a 1989 Geo Prizm
and a 1988 Chevrolet Cavalier, also were missing.
   Helterhoff said the FBI was questioning neighbors and relatives
and had talked with two of the couple's five children, none of whom
lived at their parent's home.
   Glenn Tarr, a 25-year GM employee, was assistant manager of
marketing information and research for the Chevrolet Division
headquarters in Warren, said GM spokesman Jim Crellin.
   Ralph Kramer, director of public relations for GM's Chevrolet
Division, said Glenn Tarr supervised the collection and analysis of
sales data from across the country for Chevrolet.

   About 100 people were evacuated from their homes
in northwest Washington and British Columbia after heavy rains and
melting snow caused rivers and streams to overflow. No injuries
were reported.
   Property damage was worst along the Nooksack River east of
Bellingham, 90 miles north of Seattle, where a house and two
trailers, a highway bridge and a minor railroad span were swept
away and 50 to 60 people were evacuated from their homes.
   About 10,000 residents were cut off from the coastal towns
except by using roads through Canada.
   A 20-mile stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway about 70 miles
east of Vancouver, British Columbia, was closed by slides that
buried the road in a mixture of mud, logs and rocks up to 30 feet
deep.
   ``I was going to buy a calf, but maybe I'll make it a fish farm
instead,'' said Leroy Vandenberg, owner of a flooded 1{-acre farm
in the area.
   The 42 members of the Oweekeno Indian Band were evacuated from
their coastal reservation 250 miles north of Vancouver to a logging
camp to escape the overflowing Wannock River.

   Maine's schoolchildren raised more than
$34,000 for victims of Hurricane Hugo and the California
earthquake, and they did it the hard way _ collecting more than
nine tons of pennies.
   Students from at least 64 schools, responding a radio station's
``Million Penny Challenge,'' came up with about 3 million pennies.
   The campaign began Oct. 23, six days after the earthquake, and
by the time the pennies _ plus some silver and bills _ were counted
last week the students had raised $34,469.32.
   There were so many pennies the crews gave up trying to count
them and began weighing the coins to approximate how many should go
in each $50 bag.
   ``We just couldn't continue counting. It was too slow,'' said
Andre J. Lacasse, vice president and general manager of Key Plaza,
where hundreds of the bags are being stored in the basement vault.
   The money _ in the form of a check _ will be donated to the Red
Cross to help victims of the earthquake and Hurricane Hugo, said
officials at radio station WMME.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan rebels and the leftist
Sandinista government ended a two-day round of talks after moving
closer to restoring a truce and bringing the insurgents home from
Honduras, officials said.
   In Nicaragua, however, the two sides accused each other Friday
of launching more attacks in the 8-year-old war that has cost an
estimated 12,000 lives.
   A rebel radio broadcast said Nicaraguan troops ``continue
bombarding the civilian population in Jinotega province'' in
northern Nicaragua but mentioned no casualties. It said the
helicopter attacks occurred Nov. 2.
   The Defense Ministry said forces of the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels this week attacked trucks carrying soldiers, killing two
soldiers and injuring seven. Most of the rebels are based in
neighboring Honduras, but some are in Nicaragua.
   Last week, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega canceled a
19-month cease-fire, saying raids by the Contras were endangering a
campaign for national elections Feb. 25. The Contras deny they
started the fighting.
   This week's talks at U.N. headquarters recessed late Friday.
They will resume Monday in Washington at the headquarters of the
Organization of American States, said U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos
Brandt.
   The OAS and the United Nations are sponsoring the talks, the
first between the two sides since June 1988.
   Brandt said progress was being made on the Sandinista demand
that the Contras disband and on rebel proposals for an amnesty and
truce.
   ``I think we were able to find some coincidence'' of views, said
the chief Nicaraguan negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Victor
Hugo Tinoco.
   ``Next week in Washington we are going to continue those
discussions, and we hope we will able to get a sound agreement that
will incorporate the demobilization and the cease-fire,'' he told
reporters.
   As the talks the two sides were discussing the toughest issue _
whether the Contras will commit to a timetable for disbanding as
part of a package deal including a cease-fire and amnesty.
   ``We are negotiating now our return to Nicaragua ... and we are
ready to go back once there is a meeting of minds between the
Sandinistas and our side,'' said Enrique Bermudez, the Contra
military commander and chief negotiator.
   A regional peace agreement signed by Central American presidents
in August at Tela, Honduras, requires that the Contras disband by
Dec. 5 and that Nicaragua hold free elections.
   The Contras did not sign that pact. But Bermudez has not
rejected the Dec. 5 deadline or the concept of demobilization,
according to a source close to the talks.
   ``We are negotiating; in that sense it is positive. It is
negative in the sense that we could not achieve a cease-fire. There
is a war in Nicaragua,'' Bermudez said in public comments.
   Diplomats said privately that the rebel delegation wanted to
confer over the weekend with a new Contra leadership commission
announced this week.
   A new element of uncertainty is whether Contra field commanders
would obey the new leaders and abide by a peace agreement.
   This week, a new rebel ``civilian-military commission'' was
announced, retaining only one of the former Contra directors,
Aristedes Sanchez. Some former directors said they had been ousted
in what they called a coup.
   The leader of the new Contra commission, Israel Galeano, said in
a letter to Vice President Dan Quayle that ``it would be foolish to
voluntarily hand over our weapons before free elections are held.''

<HEAD>Defense Seeks to Drop Black Juror From Police Shooting Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The manslaughter trial of a Miami police officer in
the shooting of a black motorcyclist ground to a halt over a
defense challenge to the seating of a black juror.
   The swearing-in of a six-member jury and four alternates for the
racially charged trial was delayed Friday by Dade Circuit Judge
Joseph Farina after the defense appealed his decision to seat black
postal worker Ezra Simmons.
   The 3rd District Court of Appeals was scheduled to rule Monday
on the emergency appeal by attorney Roy Black, who represents
suspended officer William Lozano.
   Black sought to reject Simmons, using one of six opportunities
attorneys on each side are allowed to reject a juror without giving
a reason.
   Farina ruled that Black's move to drop Simmons was based soley
on Simmons' race.
   Black, who already used five of his automatic disqualifications,
said he wanted to reject Simmons because of his union activity
advising accused drug users.
   Colombian-born Lozano fired a single shot at Clement Lloyd, 23,
during a police chase in Miami's predominantly black Overtown
section Jan. 16. Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, later died
from injuries sustained when the motorcycle crashed. Three days of
race riots ensued.
   Lozano, 30, contends he fired in self-defense because he was in
danger of being run down by the motorcycle.
   Black has repeatedly objected to there being only one Hispanic
on the jury, claiming that ratio does not give fair representation
of Miami's large Spanish-speaking community.
   ``It's a skewed jury and my client would be denied a panel that
doesn't reflect the community,'' the attorney said.
   Black sought an immediate suspension of jury selection once
Farina agreed to seat Simmons, while the judge went ahead with the
selection process.
   But Farina said he wouldn't swear in the jury until there is a
ruling on the appeal, which seeks to overrule Farina's decision and
seat another juror.
   The five other potential jurors include two white women, a white
man, a black woman and a Hispanic woman. The alternates include two
white women, a Hispanic woman and a Hispanic man.

<TEXT>
   Mindful that millions of Chinese protested for
democratic reform only five months ago, the Chinese media have been
careful in reporting the dramatic political changes in East Germany.
   The media have reported some of the developments in East Germany
without suggesting the reasons behind them. They have not reported
on the mass exodus of East Germans to the West, nor on crowds
chipping away at the Berlin Wall with hand tools.
   The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist
Party of China, today gave a dry account of how East Germany had
opened its borders to the West.
   The paper noted that U.S. Secretary of State James Baker hailed
the East German move as a ``very positive change.'' But it also
quoted West Germany's interior minister as urging people to ``think
hard about coming over because for a long time their living
conditions will be worse than what they have now.''
   While Western leaders assert that leadership upheavals in East
Germany, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria indicate the failure of
communism, the Chinese reports depict communism as still commanding
the faith of the people.
   ``Krenz re-elected after Politburo resigns'' said a headline
Thursday in the official China Daily. The article pointed out that
new East German leader Egon Krenz and seven Politburo members were
retained in the new lineup.
   Newspapers have not mentioned the internal political pressures
that led to the resignation of former East German leader Erich
Honecker.
   The only mention of East Germany in Monday's People's Daily was
a report of three ``ruffians'' who were sentenced to two to four
years in prison for ``destroying public facilities and illegally
disturbing social order during a march on the evening of Oct. 3.''
   The paper did not mention that hundreds of thousands of East
Germans had been holding marches for weeks, demanding democratic
reforms and permission to leave the country freely.
   Pro-democracy demonstrations rocked about 80 Chinese cities last
spring, culminating in the crackdown on protesters in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square June 3.
   Hundreds and possibly thousands were killed during the crackdown
that day and the next. Thousands more have been arrested since,
squelching the remnants of overt political dissent.

<HEAD>Boeing Strike Could Cause Layoffs of Other Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. is pressuring its engineers and
some other professional employees to perform work normally done by
striking Machinists, the engineers' union said.
   Leaders of the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, Boeing's second-largest union with 28,000 members,
have been told that unless their members take up some of the
strikers' tasks, they may face layoffs, according to the group's
weekly newsletter.
   ``It is the company's claim that cash-flow problems dictate
either a reduction in force among employees in other pay codes or
performance by some of these on essential work normally done by
(strikers),'' said the newsletter article, which was published
Friday.
   Russ Young of Boeing denied that such a message had been
delivered.
   ``We have not told SPEEA that we have any layoffs planned,''
Young said. ``I don't know of anything that would imply that,
either.''
   Dan Mahoney, general counsel to the engineers, said it appeared
Boeing management was backing out of a previous agreement under
which SPEEA members weren't required to do machinists' work. The
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers has
been on strike since Oct. 4.
   In the past, members were instructed to notify the engineers'
union when asked to do such work. The union would then demand the
company rescind the orders. But the newsletter said the union was
withdrawing that advice and would leave it up to members whether to
do Machinists work.
   ``We urge all SPEEA members to contribute money and food to
assist the IAM strikers whose needs are accelerating every day.
Those members who choose to do IAM work might also decide to give
additional aid to the strikers,'' the article said.
   ``I call that a wimp letter,'' said Jack Daniels of Machinists
District Lodge 751.
   Daniels said members of the smaller union lack the skills to do
work done by the strikers, and if they try, ``all they're going to
do is shoot themselves in the foot.''
   Meanwhile, T. Craig Martin of Boeing Commercial Airplanes
confirmed that many suppliers had been told to halt or slow down
deliveries to Boeing, sparking some concern of layoffs.
   ``We're concerned, but we're trying not to speculate,'' said
Brian Alleman of Certified Holding Co. in Everett, a supplier.
``Obviously it's unknown right now how long this might last.''
   In Washington state alone, 1,000 suppliers sell Boeing roughly
$500 million worth of supplies annually, company officials said.
Boeing is by far the most important employer in the Seattle area.
   The Machinists represent about 57,800 Boeing workers, including
43,300 in the local district lodge; 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700
in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred others in California, Hawaii,
Utah, Montana, Wyoming and other states.
   Negotiations have foundered on Boeing's refusal to offer more
than a three-year, 10 percent wage increase, and on the union's
insistence on a greater share of the company's record profits. The
last talks ended Nov. 11, and none are scheduled.

<HEAD>Israel Rejects Japanese Appeal to Negotiate with PLO</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visiting Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel
rejected appeals by Japanese leaders to negotiate with the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``It is Israel's position that we will not negotiate with the
PLO,'' Arens said Friday. ``We know that the position of the
Japanese government is not congruent with the government of Israel,
but it is important to conduct a dialogue.''
   He told a news conference that although the PLO says it has
changed, it ``is a terrorist organization that practices terror.''
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said last year that he renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist. Israel maintains,
however, that the PLO is a terror group and refuses to deal with it.
   In another development, Arens told reporters that Israel and
Japan have agreed to set up a council that will act as a forum for
dialogue on bilateral and international issues.
   In meetings Thursday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Foreign
Minister Taro Nakayama and other government leaders urged Arens was
urged to open a dialogue with the PLO.
   Arens said his government would negotiate with Palestinians
elected from the occupied territories under an Israeli peace plan.
Those elected are to hold talks with Israel on limited autonomy,
with the final status of the territories to be decided later.
   Japan supports the concept of an independent Palestinian state
and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all territories occupied
in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel opposes these points.
   Arens is in Japan for a five-day visit. He is only the second
Israeli foreign minister to visit; Yitzhak Shamir, now prime
minister, came in 1985.

   Gunfire erupted in Westwood Village and
numerous fights were reported today in the trendy entertainment
district that draws large weekend crowds.
   No serious injuries were reported in the violence late Friday
and early today in the neighborhood of theaters, shops and
restaurants adjoining the campus of the University of California at
Los Angeles.
   It was a shooting in upscale district in 1988 that focused
attention on the severity of gang violence in Los Angeles.
   Police Friday and early today investigated reports of shots
fired, and responded to ``unconfirmed reports of about 15 fights
out there,'' Moen said.
   Moen said it was unclear whether the violence was gang-related.
No active gangs operate in the neighborhood, but gang members are
found among the thousands of non-gang members who crowd the area on
weekends.
   In January 1988, 27-year-old Karen Toshima was killed by a stray
round in Westwood while strolling after a dinner date. Alleged gang
member Durrel Dewitt Collins, 23, was convicted Nov. 1 of murder
and attempted murder in the case.

<HEAD>David Hockney Transmits New Art Work By Fax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRADFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A David Hockney art work went on public
display today after the artist sent it here from California in 144
separate faxed sheets. It was hailed as a milestone.
   ``Fax art is unveiled,'' trumpeted the London newspaper The
Independent. ``The event is considered by experts to be an
important development for one of the world's most innovative
artists.''
   The striking black and white abstract image, called ``Tennis,''
was initially compiled by Hockney in his Los Angeles studio and
then split up into separate parts for transmission. It depicts a
game of tennis.
   In Los Angeles Friday, Hockney used four fax machines to
transmit 144 sheets to the Salts Mill art gallery at Saltaire, near
his hometown of Bradford in Yorkshire, England.
   An invited audience watched as the sections arrived to the
accompaniment of electronic bleeps on the gallery's fax machines.
It took more than two hours.
   As the sheets arrived, Jonathan Silver, the gallery's owner, and
an assistant used a laser printer to make clean copies. Then they
assembled the sheets onto a screen with paste, in line with
Hockney's detailed instructions.
   The complete picture was 15 feet by 9 feet 6 inches.
   The work went on public display at the gallery today.
   Hockney, 52, is one of the world's most popular living artists.
Some of his works have fetched more than $600,000.
   In a letter on display at the gallery, Hockney says: ``I was
first attracted to the fax when I realized it was a telephone for
the deaf. I am slowly losing my hearing ... so I have never liked
the telephone too much.''
   The gallery, dedicated to Hockney's work, owns more than 150 of
his compositions. Silver praised Hockney's latest creation as ``a
tremendous achievement and a real development in the world of art.''
   ``I think Hockney has humanized technology and made it more
intimate,'' he said.
   Some of the artist's best-known paintings depict another sport _
swimming. The highly-colored pictures of young men and bright blue
pools have become his hallmark.
   Hockney retains his Yorkshire accent after living in California
for 25 years. He said in a recent interview that he went to live
there because he preferred its freedom and sunshine.

<HEAD>Government May Have Trouble Finding Country to Accept Bosch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Immigration experts say it will be difficult for
the government to find a country that will accept anti-Castro
militant Orlando Bosch.
   Relatives said this week that Bosch, 63, is tired of jail and
had decided to give up his fight against government efforts to
deport him.
   The Justice Department has promised not to send Bosch to Cuba,
where a death sentence awaits him.
   Bosch has 50 days to appeal a Miami federal judge's ruling
Wednesday that upheld the government's decision to deport him. But
if he notifies the government in writing that he won't appeal, he
could be deported as soon as the State Department can find a
country to accept him.
   Bosch has been held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center since Feb. 16, 1988, when he flew to Miami from Venezuela.
   ``He doesn't want to prolong the anguish, after two years of
this,'' said Bosch's wife, Adriana.
   Bosch had spent 11 years in Venezuelan prisons on charges he
planned the bombing of a Cuban jetliner in 1976 that killed 73
people. Bosch was never convicted in that case, but U.S.
prosecutors say his anti-Castro activities make him a threat to
national security.

<HEAD>Rain Subsiding in Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   After a final spell of rain in the Cascade Range today, clearing
skies and colder temperatures were expected to ease flooding that
caused property damage and prompted evacuations in northwest
Washington and British Columbia.
   Days of heavy rains and melting snow in the mountains caused
rivers and streams to overflow, and flood warnings remained in
effect this morning.
   The worst property damage was along the Nooksack River east of
Bellingham, where a house and two trailers, a highway bridge and a
minor railroad span were swept away.
   Rain slackened overnight Thursday, but the National Weather
Service said heavy rains in the central Cascade mountains today
could raise river levels again.
   High winds, meanwhile, continued along the eastern slopes of the
Rocky Mountains on Friday. In Montana, winds were 35 to 50 mph,
with gusts of more than 100 mph along the front range west of
Choteau.
   Rain showers extended from the Pacific Northwest to Montana. In
the East showers were also scattered across New York state,
southern New England and northern Pennsylvania.
   Thunderstorms were over extreme southeastern New England. A
thunderstorm at Nantucket Island in Massachusetts produced wind
gusts to 58 mph.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation Friday, with
fair skies in much of the southern and western United States.
   But high temperatures were only in the 30s in the upper
Mississippi Valley and the upper Great Lakes region.
   Temperatures warmed into the 60s and 70s Friday in the northern
Plains and the Pacific Northwest and into the 80s across much of
Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and across the Florida
Peninsula. Temperatures soared into the 80s and 90s in the
southwestern deserts.
   The high Friday was 96 degrees at Thermal and Palm Springs,
Calif.

<HEAD>Legislator Proposes $1 Fine for Assaulting Flag Burners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state legislator has proposed a fine
of $1 against anyone convicted of assaulting a flag-burner, in what
a civil rights activist called an invitation to violence.
   State Rep. Shelby Rhinehart, the Democrat who filed the bill,
said it was intended to limit punishment for those who react
violently to flag burning.
   ``It'll protect a lot of old veterans if they attack someone
burning a flag. They won't be punished severely,'' said Rhinehart.
   The bill condones violence, said Hedy Weinberg, executive
director of the Tennessee chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union.
   ``I wouldn't even question the constitutionality at this
point,'' she said. ``I think what's more disturbing is the
rationale and logic behind it. What he's doing in fact is giving in
some sense permission to veterans. .. to become violent.''
   Legal questions aside, she wondered if there was any need for
the bill.
   ``I've been in Tennessee five years, and I've never heard of any
flag-burning incidents,'' Ms. Weinberg said.
   The bill is one of several to be considered by the state
legislature next year that deal with flag-burning. The Supreme
Court ruled several months ago that such action is a protected form
of expression, prompting Congress to pass a bill that prohibits
desecration of the flag.

   Jailers prohibited convicted ``Night
Stalker'' Richard Ramirez from watching TV or receiving visitors
for 10 days for vandalizing a ceiling air vent while taking a
shower.
   The incident Thursday at the Men's Central Jail was not
considered an attempted jailbreak, sheriff's Deputy George
Ducoulombier said Friday.
   Ramirez, 29, was placed in ``administrative segregation'' at the
jail after he pulled the cover off an air vent while showering
alone, sheriff's Sgt. Ernie Roop said.
   The self-described devil worshipper was sentenced to death on
Tuesday. He was being held at the county-run jail while awaiting
transfer to San Quentin State Prison.
   Ramirez was convicted of 13 murders and 30 other felony charges
stemming from a string of murders, rapes and burglaries. As with
all death sentences, Ramirez's case will automatically be appealed
to the state Supreme Court.

   About 3,000 riot police backed by
armored vans fired tear gas and stormed a college campus today to
break up a student protest calling for the overthrow of President
Roh Tae-woo.
   Several dozen students and police were injured, mostly by flying
rocks. Police said they had no precise figures on injuries or any
figures on arrests.
   The police poured into Korea University in eastern Seoul as six
armored vans with tear gas launchers fired volleys of choking gas.
   Students counterattacked with firebombs and rocks, and the two
sides fought for more than five hours in clashes around the huge
campus.
   Police moved into the campus to stop about 1,000 students and
dissidents from holding a rally to call for the overthrow of the
Roh government.
   Hundreds of riot police had surrounded the campus during the
night. Police stopped and questioned students trying to enter, and
some were taken away for questioning.
   The attack on the campus was unusual, since police normally do
not attempt to halt protests inside school grounds. But police
commanders have been ordered to take tough measures to crack down
on anti-government radicals.
   Also today, about 1,000 riot police were stationed around
Dongkuk University in central Seoul to prevent students from
assembling there for a rally.
   The government also banned a rally planned for Sunday by
militant labor unions calling for better pay and working conditions
for industrial workers. National Police headquarters said the rally
posed a threat to ``social order.''
   Labor leaders said they would try to hold the rally anyway.
   The strength of the radical student movement and allied
dissident groups has declined in recent months because of their
growing extremism and violent tactics.
   The radicals are not considered to be a serious threat to the
government. However, the Roh administration insists they threaten
national security.

   Coast Guard and environmental officials were
working today to free a 470-foot Greek freighter that ran aground
in a fragile coral reef off the Florida Keys, the scene of two
other ship groundings in less than a month.
   Efforts failed early today to dislodge the freighter Elpis from
the reef about five miles east of Key Largo.
   Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Karonis said a tugboat will be
brought in to help free the freighter, carrying a cargo of sugar
and 356 tons of fuel oil.
   There have been no reports of leaks from the ship, which ran
aground about 11:30 p.m. Friday, but officials are not certain of
the extent of the damage to the reef.
   The Elpis was grounded near the site in the Key Largo National
Marine Sanctuary where the 155-foot freighter Alec Owen Maitland
ran aground Oct. 25, cutting a 200-foot swath in the reef.
   Five days later, the 475-foot cargo ship Mavro Vetranic became
lodged on a reef off the Dry Tortugas in the far western Keys. A $9
million federal civil lawsuit charges the Yugoslav freighter was
unseaworthy and the crew was incompetent.
   The Mavro Vetranic, carrying 14,300 tons of phosphate and
143,000 gallons of fuel, destroyed about 500 feet of reef before
being refloated Nov. 2.
   Karonis said subpeonas have been issued for crew members of the
Elpis, and a board of inquiry will convene Monday to investigate
the grounding.
   Gov. Bob Martinez today also amended an executive order to
permit a criminal investigation into the Elpis grounding, said
Martinez spokesman Brian Ballard.
   The order already encompassed the two other ships.

   The last voters trickled into polling
stations today to choose a government to lead this territory's
transition to independence.
   More than 91 percent of the 701,483 registered voters had cast
their ballots by Friday night. Today, on the last day of voting,
territorial officials said they expected a total turnout of 98
percent.
   The U.N. monitoring team believes ``an all-time percentage poll
record may be achieved for fully democratic elections,'' spokesman
Fred Eckhard said late Friday.
   At some of the 350 polling stations in this territory ruled by
South Africa, officials sat around this morning with nothing to do.
   However, many people who could not leave work during the week
were expected to arrive before the scheduled 7 p.m. poll closing
time.
   Officials said the polls would stay open until everyone in line
had voted.
   In the early voting, some lines extended hundreds of yards.
   The final turnout was to be announced Sunday morning. Ballot
counting begins Monday with results expected Wednesday.
   Voters have had five days to choose a 72-member assembly to
write a constitution and declare the end of 74 years of South
African rule. The assembly will be chosen according to the
percentage of votes each of the 10 parties receives.
   The leftist South-West African People's Organization, which
fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South African rule, is
expected to get the most votes.
   Radio South-West Africa reported today that a Namibian
journalist, missing since Monday when his car was found at the
Angolan border, had been detained by Angolan soldiers on suspicion
of spying for South Africa.
   Martin Erastus had gone to work for Die Republikein, an
Afrikaans language newspaper, early this year, after having served
as a high-ranking officer in a South African commanded territorial
battalion, which was disbanded under the requirements of U.N.
Resolution 435.
   Die Republikein is the newspaper of the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance, the major opponent to South-West Africa People's
Organization, whose guerrillas fought from bases in Angola.

   Workers punched through the Berlin Wall today and
border guards from two nations reached through a gaping hole and
shook hands in a spine-tingling ceremony marking the opening of the
border between East and West Germany.
   Thousands of exultant East Germans poured across the border for
a second day to revel in their new freedom to travel after three
decades of confinement in their once strictly controlled country.
   East Germany's ADN news agency said West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and Communist Party chief Egon Krenz spoke by telephone
today about economic relations between the nations and other
matters related to the historic change percolating in Communist
East Germany.
   Kohl said said the leaders would likely meet either at the end
of the month or the beginning of December.
   Krenz' daring gambit _ that by giving his people the freedom to
travel he will stop an unprecedented exodus of his most talented
young citizens _ appeared to be working.
   Austrian border officials said the steady flow of East Germans
refugees heading to West German through Austria had slowed to a
trickle. Only 150 East German asylum seekers crossed the border
during a 24-hour period ending this morning, a sharp drop the from
1,000-a-day average of recent weeks.
   In Bonn, the Interior Ministry said this morning that 140,000
East Germans had arrived overnight in all of West Germany through
the newly opened borders, but most appeared to be using their
remarkable new travel privileges to visit rather than seek asylum.
   ``I've never been in West Berlin before,'' said a beaming Sabine
Gohlke, 23, who came from East Berlin with her husband and two
toddlers. ``I couldn't come before, they wouldn't let me.''
   Christopher Kennedy, 18, an exchange student from Harrison,
Ark., said he wanted to see an event ``that is going to be in the
history books as long as man is on the face of the earth.''
   West German cities all along the border were packed with East
Germans. Traffic jams were reported at major crossing points.
   In the central state of Hesse, officials lifted traditionally
strict shop-closing hours and let stores stay open as long as they
wanted today to handle the flood. In a near-revolutionary move,
stores were also allowed to stay open on Sunday in Hesse.
   Officials in the north Bavarian city of Hof near the East German
border barred traffic from downtown because of a massive influx of
visitors awed by the relative opulence of the West.
   In West Berlin, many danced, sang and smashed bottles from atop
the wall in a second night of celebration since the Berlin border
was opened for the first time since 1961.
   Two giddy, exuberant days of celebrations by Germans from both
nations turned raucous at times around the wall, surrounded by a
swarming mass of celebrants. There were several minor
confrontations between police and demonstrators overnight and
today, but the crowds were brought quickly under control.
   In one incident near the wall's Brandenburg Gate, about 100
demonstrators tore several holes in the wall, one 2-feet wide, and
then engaged in a shoving match with East German border guards,
witnesses and radio reports said. The encounter ended quickly and
there were no injuries.
   Protesters also hurled bottles, litter and dirt at the East
German guards, the witnesses said.
   Susan Wulka of the West Berlin police said that in several
instances, police had to restrain some in the crowds who were
chipping away at the wall. But she said no violence occurred.
   ``The spirit of freedom now reigns all over Europe _ Poland,
Hungary and now East Germany,'' Kohl declared here Friday night,
before leaving to hold an emergency Cabinet meeting in Bonn today.
   Kohl announced today he would be meeting soon with Krenz to
discuss the historic developments. Kohl also said he is ``constant
contact'' with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms
triggered the firestorm of change sweeping the East bloc.
   In East Berlin, Communist leader Krenz pledged before a rally of
150,000 people Friday that the country's new reform course ``will
not be turned back.''
   The Communist Party Central Committee promised that its dramatic
decision Thursday to allow East Germans to travel freely will be
permanent. It also said it will guarantee ``secret and publicly
monitored elections.''
   However, the government offered no details and made no reference
to constitutional provisions guaranteeing Communist dominance of
the government.
   On Friday, workers opened a bridge spanning the border and broke
through the wall early today to create the first of 18 planned
openings in the monolithic structure, the symbol of Cold War
tensions that divided not only a nation but the world.
   A constant stream of East Germans began crossing through the new
60-foot opening at the Bernauer Strasse section of the wall.
   Early this morning, East German guards and West German police
shook hands through the newly created break in the wall to cheers
from a crowd of about 100, who had waited through the night.
   ``This is a wonderful day,'' said a French policeman who
watched. ``Who here would not be happy to see it?''
   The symbolic event came after another dizzying day of change in
East Germany. On Friday East Germany announced that all border
restrictions were lifted, prompting more than 100,000 jubilant East
Germans to cross into the West.
   Most came for a quick visit, to get a glimpse of a world they
had not been able to see for 28 years.
   Krenz replaced hard-line leader Erich Honecker Oct. 18 amid an
unprecedented wave of public discontent, with tens of thousands
fleeing to the West and hundreds of thousands demonstrating for
reform almost daily.
   East Germany's decision to open its borders brought accolades
from world leaders, although some expressed caution against too
swift a move to reform.
   President Bush said he would ``seize every chance'' to promote
democracy in Eastern Europe. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
called the lifting of East German travel restrictions ``the most
dramatic event in East-West relations'' since World War II.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
opening East Germany's borders would help stem emigration and end
``stereotypes about the Iron Curtain.''
   By giving in to one of the key demands of recent weeks _ free
travel _ the East German leadership took a calculated risk, hoping
to calm some of the anger directed at the Communists.
   Authorities appeared relieved that so many citizens were
prepared to go look at the West, but then come back to a country
that this year has lost 200,000 mostly young skilled workers to
West Germany.
   In West Berlin, thousands streamed along the elegant
Kurfuerstendamm shopping boulevard, some carrying candles, others
toasting each other. Crowds of young girls could be seen rushing
down the street toward stores. Bars offered free drinks.

   The stream of East Germans using Hungary
as a springboard to the West narrowed to a trickle after East
Germany's decision to open its borders, Austrian border officials
said today.
   While the daily number often exceeded 1,000 before East Germany
on Thursday lifted restrictions on direct travel to the West, only
about 150 crossed into Austria from Hungary in the 24-hour period
beginning at 8 a.m. Friday, the officials said.
   Hungary had defied the East Berlin leadership in throwing open
its western border with Austria to East Germans at midnight Sept.
10, after thousands of them refused to return home and demanded
they be allowed to emigrate to West Germany.
   The total number of East Germans emigrating via Hungary since
Sept. 11 had exceeded 51,500 by this morning, said the officials,
who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with Austrian custom.
   Thousands of East Germans also fled through Poland and
Czechoslovakia by flocking to West German embassies in Warsaw and
Prague.
   The exodus and a corresponding series of demonstrations
ultimately led to the downfall of the government of Erich Honecker
and his replacement by Egon Krenz, who has promised reforms.
   Krenz on Thursday finally lifted travel restrictions in an
effort to halt the mass flight of its citizens.

   A melee between thousands of protesters and police
left 129 injured in Moldavia and fueled calls for the southwest
republic's leadership to resign, the official Tass news agency
reported today.
   Also today, Tass reported that the Kremlin has told four other
restive Soviet republics that laws they have passed conflict with
the national constitution, a veiled reference to the republics'
moves toward greater autonomy.
   In Kishniev, the Moldavian capital, a mob of 6,000 demanding the
release of protesters arrested during a previous protest tried to
storm the headquarters of the Interior Ministry late Friday night,
Tass said.
   Protesters shouting anti-police slogans threw stones, sticks and
bottles at police, then set up barricades and pelted the
headquarters with torches and firebombs, Tass reported, citing the
Moldavian news agency ATEM.
   One witness said he saw the crowd turn over an ambulance. Tass
said the mob also torched a police car.
   Police fought the protesters with rubber truncheons and water
hoses, then resorted to warning shots and tear gas, the official
news agency said.
   Thirty people were arrested but ``were released in accordance
with demands from the crowd,'' Tass said, and at least 83 police
and 46 protesters were injured.
   As midnight approached, the protesters withdrew to a nearby
square, where they held a mass meeting and voiced demands for the
resignation of the republic's government and Communist Party
leaders, Tass reported.
   Moldavia, a republic of 4.3 million on the border with Romania,
has seen repeated unrest this year led by the Moldavian People's
Front, a grassroots group that is pushing for greater independence
from Moscow and preservation of the indigenous language and culture.
   The protesters were demanding the release of about 20 people
arrested Tuesday as they gathered at a monument to a national hero
near the route of a scheduled parade to mark the 72nd anniversary
of Communist power.
   In the Krelim announcement, Tass said the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet legislature found in Azerbaijan and the Baltic
republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia ``cannot have force on
the territory of the republics, because they contradict the
provisions of the national constitution.''
   It did not specify the laws, but the parliaments all have passed
laws declaring ``sovereignty,'' meaning they have the right to
declare national laws invalid locally.
   The Estonian parliament already has run afoul of the Kremlin
twice with controversial laws, but the legislative conflicts never
led to direct showdowns.
   Estonian lawmakers held fast to their sovereignty law late last
year despite Kremlin objections, and the issue was never forced.
   However, last summer, the Estonians backed down on a voting law
that set residency requirements and touched off strikes among
Russian workers in the republic.
   Tass said the Presidium cited Article 74 of the Soviet
Constitution, which states that national law prevails over a
republic's law when they are in conflict.
   Presidium members ``proposed'' that the four republics'
parliaments bring their laws in line with the constitution, Tass
said. It did not say what might happen if the republics resisted.
   In other action, the Presidium approved a draft measure
declaring the full exoneration of Soviet ethnic groups who were
forcibly resettled under dictator Josef Stalin, who accused them of
sympathizing with the enemy during World War II, Moscow Radio
reported.
   The report did not indicate if the action might lead to
resettlement of the groups.

   South Korea today cheered the opening
of East German borders and said it hopes the event will have a
``positive effect'' on the divided Korean peninsula.
   ``The government welcomes the overall opening by East Germany of
its borders and considers it an epochal event that signified the de
facto end of the East-West ideological confrontation,'' government
spokesman Choe Byung-yul said in a statement.
   Choe, who also serves as minister of culture and information,
said South Korea wants changes in East Europe to help ``accelerate
openness, liberalization and democratization in North Korea.''
   Describing Communist North Korea as ``the world's last remaining
symbol of closed mindedness and isolationism,'' Choe said ``We
earnestly hope that the trend of such changes will have a positive
effect on the Korean peninsula that suffers the same pain of
national division.''
   The Koreas have been bitter rivals since Korea was divided in
1945 at the end of World War II when Soviet and U.S. troops ended
the Japanese occupation.
   The Communist north invaded the south in 1950, triggering a
three-year war involving troops from China and the 16-nation U.N.
Command. Borders are now completely sealed off and guarded by
hundreds of thousands of troops, and each side punishes its
citizens trying to cross the border without prior approval.

   President Bush is looking with ``encouragement and
hope'' at the dramatic events in Eastern Europe, offering help to
West Germany in coping with thousands of refugees but reacting with
restraint to the crumbling of the Berlin Wall.
   Bush vowed to act with prudence and imagination to the rapid
developments. But he promised no specific action Friday and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III ruled out substantial Western
aid for East Germany until ``there is political pluralism across
the board.''
   The president was watching the events from a speechmaking tour
in Texas, where he was helping dedicate the Texas Vietnam Veterans
Memorial today before returning to Washington.
   ``We live in exciting times. The rapidity of change is
mind-boggling. I will do my level best to conduct an imaginative
foreign policy, but I will be prudent,'' Bush said at a dinner
Friday night for Texas Gov. Bill Clements.
   ``We all look with hope in our hearts at the amazing
developments in Eastern Europe, indeed in the Soviet Union itself,
with encouragement and hope,'' said Bush, watching the events from
a speechmaking tour Friday in Dallas.
   Bush was asked in an interview with Texas reporters Friday if he
had an urge to go to Berlin now.
   ``Someday I'd like to see that area again. I'd like to see it
with the wall down, not just holes in it,'' he said.
   Bush said, ``I think we're seeing a disintegration of that form
of totalitarianism in Eastern Europe. I hope it's a contagious
disease _ and (Cuban President Fidel) Castro catches it and
(Nicaraguan President) Daniel Ortega catches and perhaps
(Panamanian leader) Gen. (Manuel Antonio) Noriega catches it.''
   Bush was interviewed by reporters from the Houston Chronicle,
Houston Post, Dallas Times Herald, and Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
   U.S. officials traveling with the president said the
administration had ``nothing concrete to right now'' to offer East
Germany as the events unfold.
   ``We're trying to sort out what's going on right now,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush's remarks Friday were more impassioned than his somewhat
subdued reaction to East Germany's action lifting travel
restrictions a day earlier. But he and other officials tempered
their comments by saying the situation remains turbulent.
   Bush said West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl telephoned him
Friday to discuss the developments in East Germany. Kohl raced home
from a politically sensitive trip to Poland as thousands of Germans
from the East poured across the wall into the Federal Republic of
Germany.
   Kohl ``asked me to share with the American people his conviction
... that this remarkable change that's taking place in Eastern
Europe, most recently in the German Democratic Republic, could
never have taken place without the steadfast loyal support of the
United States of America.''
   In Washington, Baker suggested the administration would continue
to react cautiously, while making clear ``we are extraordinarily
happy about'' the opening of East Germany's borders.
   ``It is important to demonstrate that we do not seek to take
unilateral advantage of these circumstances,'' Baker said on the
MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on public television. ``That is not in the
best interests of the West.''
   ``I don't think it's going to be reversed, but it may be,'' said
Baker, calling such a backsliding ``extremely possible'' in the
Soviet Union and ``not impossible'' elsewhere.
   Such change in previously closed societies ``offers us all much
hope and deserves our continued encouragement,'' Bush said in a
Friday speech to a National Association of Realtors gathering.
   Bush later said he was looking forward to his Dec. 2-3 meeting
with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to discuss a variety of
subjects, including the changing political face of Warsaw Pact
nations.
   Bush and Kohl agreed the Mediterranean superpower meeting would
be ``even more important'' in light of the opening of the wall,
``and agreed to consult closely between now and the meeting,'' said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   But Bush, speaking of the reforms Gorbachev began, cautioned,
``This country must not base its foreign policy or its national
security on the aspirations of one man inside the Soviet Union or
anywhere else.''
   An official travelling with Bush said the administration will
consult with U.S. allies to develop ``a multilateral approach that
is responsive, not provocative.''
   On the practical side, the Pentagon said it was making available
housing for 980 people in three off-base installations.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney conceded the events could bring
changes to the Western alliance.
   Lifting East-to-West travel restrictions is ``a major event but
it's important for us to think what comes after that,'' said Cheney.
   Cheney said if it turned out that new non-communist governments
formed, and presented ``less of a threat'' and that in turn ``might
portend some changes on our side.''

   President Bush today expressed ``grave concern''
about the health of an imprisoned Cuban dissident who is on a
hunger strike, and he called upon Cuban President Fidel Castro to
free all political prisoners.
   In a statement issued by the traveling White House, Bush said:
   ``I view with grave concern the news that long-term Cuban
political prisoner Alfredo Mustelier Nuevo has been on a hunger
strike since completing 20 years in Castro's prisons on Oct. 27.
For the past week he has been refusing liquids as well and his
current health situation is extremely serious.''
   Bush said two other political prisoners, Ernesto Diaz Rodriquez
and Maio Chanes de Armas, ``have languished in Cuban prisons for
over 20 years'' after trials that ``lacked any semblance of due
process.''
   The president said the three ``are no threat to the Cuban
government. I call upon the Cuban government to release these men
immediately, as well as to free all remaining political prisoners.''
   Bush also mentioned Castro in an interview Friday with Texas
reporters focusing on East Germany's opening of its borders and
other waves of change sweeping through Eastern Europe.
   ``I think we're seeing a disintegration of that form of
totalitarianism in Eastern Europe. I hope it's a contagious disease
_ and Castro catches it and (Nicaraguan President) Daniel Ortega
catches and perhaps (Panamanian leader) Gen. (Manuel Antonio)
Noriega catches it,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for Democracy, a
private group using public money, walks a fine line between
promoting democratic ideals overseas and interfering in foreign
politics.
   One of its major tasks this year is to aid the political
opposition coalition poised to take on Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government in elections scheduled for February.
   Such moves are not new for the NED, which played
behind-the-scenes roles in support of political movements in
Poland, Chile and the Philippines, and was recently accused of
partisan politics in Costa Rica.
   In Nicaragua, ``It's the only way to help Mrs. (Violeta)
Chamorro and the opposition to assure a reasonable shot at free and
fair elections,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quoted
President Bush as saying while Congress considered $9 million in
assistance that was eventually approved to help the Nicaraguan
opposition.
   The NED charter, however, says ``no endowment funds ... may be
used to finance the campaigns of candidates for public office.''
   To reconcile that apparent conflict, endowment officials say
they are not helping Mrs. Chamorro but rather Nicaragua's
democratic coalition _ and that Mrs. Chamorro just happens to be
the coalition's candidate to replace Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega.
   ``If we're not going to enter into those situations _ supporting
democratic groups _ we would not be doing our job,'' says NED's
president, Carl Gershman.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., an endowment supporter, says the
Nicaraguan project ``approaches the line, but it doesn't cross
it.'' He says the money will go to the ``campaign infrastructure''
but acknowledges that Mrs. Chamorro ``will derive a considerable
indirect benefit.''
   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., an NED critic, counters that
Americans ``would be very annoyed if the Soviet Union, Japan or any
other country contributed money into our electoral system.''
   ``In fact, it's illegal in our country,'' Kanjorski said. ``What
we do is make a very negative impression with Yankee money.''
   Congress established the NED in 1983 ``to strengthen democratic
institutions throughout the world through private, non-governmental
efforts.'' The programs are funded through annual congressional
appropriations.
   The group's birth, according to a 1984 study by the General
Accounting Office, was a reaction to ``public disclosure of the
CIA's covert funding of overseas activities of some private
voluntary organizations.'' The idea was to take the shroud off
promoting democracy and free enterprise and operate much the way
the Soviets push socialism.
   Yet the NED, at times, has become involved in countries that
already are acknowledged democracies. An endowment program in Costa
Rica, a democracy for 100 years, was canceled recently after
disclosure that it was aiding a group linked to the political
opposition of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   The NED charter says it may not ``pick and choose among the
democratic competitors.'' Solarz says the Costa Rican program was a
mistake but that he is pleased that the NED acted to halt it after
it was publicized.
   Most of the endowment's programs are less controversial. For the
past five years it has sent money to such farflung places as
Botswana and Turkey. Last year's $16.8 million budget included
$40,000 for publication of a Vietnamese magazine focusing on the
merits of democracy. Another $140,000 went for leadership training
courses in Brazil.
   Congress last year approved $1 million to be channeled through
the NED for voter registration and polling in Chile's plebiscite in
which the majority of Chileans voted ``no'' to continuing the
Augusto Pinochet dictatorship.
   Endowment programs, for the most part, are developed by four
``core grantees:'' the AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute, the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for International Private
Enterprise, and matching ``Institutes for International Affairs''
linked respectively to the Republican and Democratic parties.
Projects are approved by the NED's bipartisan board of directors.
   Eugenia Kemble, head of the AFL-CIO group, recalls the earlier
days of CIA intervention and says the NED offers an alternative _ a
``positive American presence that contrasts to ... what was done
covertly.''
   Kanjorski, however, opposes the whole idea of giving U.S.
government money to foreign groups under the guise of a private
organization.
   ``We don't have enough money now to operate our government,'' he
said.
   He especially objects to the Nicaraguan project, saying: ``If it
doesn't violate the law, it should violate the intent.''
   NED funding for Nicaraguan opposition groups rose from $455,000
in 1987 to $807,000 for the year ending last Sept. 30. Thousands of
dollars in NED aid to the oppostion newspaper, La Prensa, caused
Nicaraguan government supporters to dub it ``the CIA paper.''
   Gershman promises strict controls to insure the money is used in
Nicaragua to educate the populace about balloting and promote the
democratic process. Once final program outlines are completed, the
NED and the core grantees will sign contracts with Nicaraguan
political opposition leaders.
   The pro-Sandinista media in Nicaragua contend that the money
will be used simply to buy votes. Two successive Republican
administrations have been attempting to depose the Sandinistas
since 1981.
   J. Brian Atwood, president of the Democrats' arm of the NED,
says, ``We don't care who wins.'' But he questions the amount of
U.S. money earmarked for the Nicaraguan vote, saying it reflects a
Republican ``obsession'' with the country.
   Last year, NED sponsored 171 programs. The biggest single
amount, almost $2 million, went to bolster the once-banned Polish
Solidarity trade union, which emerged as a political party and
scored a major electoral victory earlier this year against the
communist government.
   Despite the Polish effort, which has had broad support from U.S.
labor unions and both Republicans and Democrats, Ms. Kemble and
other NED supporters acknowledge that the endowment has made some
mistakes.
   In 1985, Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., told Congress the endowment
secretly funneled money to groups actively opposed to the French
government. He called NED ``a loose cannon.''
   A year earlier, NED had contributed some $20,000 to a Panamanian
labor union which put the money into the campaign of a presidential
candidate backed by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   A sign of the changing tides in American foreign policy came
last year, when NED gave $55,000 to help a staunchly anti-Noriega
group.

<HEAD>Navy Believes Its Conclusions On Blast Will Stand Up To Scrutiny</HEAD>

   The Navy believes its conclusions on the cause
of the USS Iowa blast that killed 47 sailors will stand up to a
skeptical Congress planning to question the service's brass on the
investigation.
   ``We feel very confident the results of the investigation will
pass the toughest scrutiny and when you look at all of the evidence
_ and not just a little slice at a time _ you will come to the same
conclusion the Navy did,'' Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy
spokesman, said Friday of the upcoming Senate Armed Services
Committee hearing on the explosion.
   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, a 30-year Navy veteran who oversaw
the technical and criminal study, and Capt. Fred P. Moosally, the
battleship's skipper, will testify Thursday before the Armed
Services panel.
   Also testifying will be Robert J. Powers, head of the criminal
division of the Naval Investigative Service and an official closely
involved in the Iowa inquiry.
   The Navy issued a report Sept. 7 that concluded gunner's mate
Clayton Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion by
inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one
of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   Navy officials did acknowledge that their evidence was
circumstantial in light of the fact that all the witnesses,
including Hartwig, were killed in the fiery blast.
   But since the report's release, Hartwig's family, lawmakers and
the sailor's former shipmates have cast doubts about the conclusion.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on investigations, has said he ``seriously
questioned'' the Navy's report, and cited an FBI report that said
its laboratory investigation on the incident was inconclusive.
   ``We didn't find anything that would lead us to conclude that a
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge,'' the FBI said
last month. ``That's not to say something wasn't there. Our
findings were inconclusive.''
   The House Armed Services panel is currently investigating the
incident and the Navy's inquiry. Last week committee staff members
interviewed Kendall Truitt, a friend of Hartwig and a sailor aboard
the Iowa who survived the blast in the lowest level of the gun
turret.
   Congressional sources, who requested anonymity, said House Armed
Services hearings on the incident before year's end were unlikely
given Congress' push to adjourn before the Thanksgiving holiday.
   Staff members from the Senate Armed Services panel also
interviewed Truitt this past week.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, said last month
he was concerned ``with certain issues which arose during the
Navy's investigation, but which were not pursued since they were
not considered to be immediately relevant to the specific task as
hand.''
   While the two Armed Services panels are looking into the
explosion, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, is conducting its own inquiry at the request of Rep. Mary
Rose Oakar, D-Ohio.
   Rep. Oakar has criticized the Navy's findings, and Thursday in a
letter to Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III questioned the
service's decision to make Moosally eligible for another major
command.
   Despite the barrage of charges and the ongoing investigations,
the Navy defends its report, and Milligan said last week that
nothing said in the past 3{ months would make him change the
findings.
   ``I think the ultimate conclusion is going to be that they are
going to support my investigation,'' the rear admiral said.
   In the latest development, the Navy denied on Friday a published
report that sailors aboard the USS Iowa took part in looting
shipmates possessions while they battled the explosion.
   The Washington Times had reported that it had received a letter
from an officer aboard the Iowa who said looting occurred while the
damage control efforts were going on.
   ``I am sure there are sailors aboard the Iowa who believe this
occurred, but there is no record that such a thing ever happened,''
said Quigley, who called the assertions ``completely false.''

<TEXT>
   The building of the Berlin Wall began
with a few strands of barbed wire early one Sunday. Hours later,
the citizens of East Berlin became aware they were prisoners, and
they began the protests that rumbled for 28 years.
   On the morning of Aug. 13, 1961, I was awakened in my West
Berlin home and told to go to the border. The Warsaw Pact announced
the Communist regime of East Germany had been authorized to ``take
measures'' to stop the flood of its citizens to the West. I was to
find out what these measures were.
   I made for the Brandenburg Gate, the symbol of the city and the
site of a main crossing point between east and west, and saw
hundreds of men setting up a barbed-wire fence.
   Armed soldiers stood guard. Machine guns were posted in case the
people made a massive attempt to reach the West.
   As my car had British army license plates, I was able to pass
freely through the Brandenburg Gate into the eastern sector.
   From there, I saw that the barbed wire extended as far as I
could see in both directions.
   Squads of ``people's militia'' _ armed factory workers _ stood
by on side streets in case of popular opposition.
   A squadron of Soviet tanks was parked in the Frederichstrasse
train station.
   Hours later, radio and television announced that East Berliners
had been sealed off from the ``devious monopoly capitalists'' in
the West, who had been urging them to go West for a better life.
   I decided to swing through the city and return to the West
through the crossing point at Potsdamer Platz.
   Before World War II, this was the Times Square of Berlin, a
junction of five streets jammed with restaurants, theaters,
nightclubs and cabarets. Now, only the ghostly ruins of bombed
building remained.
   As I drove toward Potsdamer Platz, I noticed a platoon of East
German soldiers commanded by a young officer. I stopped the car
and, pretending ignorance, said: ``Good morning lieutenant, what is
going on?''
   As expected, he was well briefed and started a long explanation
of why it was necessary to cut off the West to ``prevent economic
sabotage by the capitalists.''
   Midway through his speech, he politely asked me to move my car
two or three yards forward.
   I had a good view through the rear-view mirror of soldiers
hauling a roll of barbed wire across the street. My car was the
last to pass over the Potsdamer Platz.
   In time, the wall there became one of the most solid sections.
It was there that Western authorities built a viewing platform used
by visiting dignitaries, including Americans presidents, to peer
into Communist-ruled territory.
   That afternoon and night, crowds gathered in West Berlin to
watch the barbed wire being erected. Some cried, knowing they were
now cut off from friends, relatives and loved ones in the east.
   Over the years, the wall grew into a potent symbol of Communist
oppression, a huge structure of concrete and steel, with
minefields, watch towers and guard dogs.
   At least 200 people were killed trying to escape across it, and
families wept in frustration because they could not visit one
another.
   This weekend, there were tears of joy as the wall started coming
down.

   An animal rights group claimed
responsiblity for three bomb attacks on Spanish targets last month,
saying they were to protest bullfighting, Dutch television reported
Saturday.
   The Animal Liberation Front, which has claimed responsibility
for peaceful protests in the past, said ``new actions'' can be
expected unless the Spanish government bans bullfights, according
to the report.
   Police refused comment on the report, which quoted a letter
allegedly sent by the group to a Dutch newspaper.
   On Oct. 24, the car of the Spanish consul in Rotterdam was
wrecked by an explosion. Three days later, bombs detonated at the
Spanish trade mission and at the labor bureau in The Hague caused
considerable damage.
   One person was slightly injured in the blast at the labor
bureau, an agency involved in assisting Spanish migrant workers in
the Netherlands.

   Alexander Vondra, 28, was released from prison Friday, the
sources said on condition of anonymity. He was jailed in September
for his part in organizing a petition for democratic reform.
   A court in Prague in September ordered him jailed for his
support of the petition titled ``A Few Sentences,'' which has been
signed by thousands of people and calls for greater democracy.

   Dozens of angry ravens swooped down and
attacked an apartment building on Saturday, smashing into windows,
terrifying residents and injuring at least one man, police said.
   Israel's Nature Reserve Authority officials shot two of the
sharp-beaked black birds before chasing the flock away from the
building in Kiryat Hayim, near the northern port city of Haifa.
   ``It was exactly like Hitchcock's movie, `The Birds.' They flew
over the house and in and out of the apartments,'' said police
Chief Superintendent Roni Raz. ``There were some 50 to 70 birds.''
   The ravens attacked and scratched at least one man during their
three-hour assault, he said.
   Raz said terrified residents called police to report the attack.
Police arrived at the scene, confirmed the report and summoned
officials from the Nature Reserve Authority.
   ``They arrived in two jeeps, sounded sirens and produced a lot
of other noise, but the birds would not leave. Then they shot two
of the ravens,'' Raz said.
   The birds retreated but came back and were finally chased away
by warning shots in the air.
   Officials from the Nature Reserve Authority said the attack may
have resulted from an attempt to capture a young bird. They said
the ravens can watch and stage vigilante raids on their human
enemies for months.
   Officials warned that the raven assault may be repeated,
especially because two of the birds were killed.

   Change flashed across Eastern Europe in
1989, from the seat of Communist power in the Kremlin, across
Poland, through Hungary and to Berlin where Germans from east and
west danced on top of the grim Berlin Wall.
   The seismic shift has jolted the order created by Stalin and his
Red Army after World War II and opened up the prospect of a new
future for Europe.
   The year saw elections in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Soviet Union
and free, open debate in a Soviet parliament. Things have changed
so basically that Andrei D. Sakharov, a dissident and Nobel Peace
Prize winner who had been exiled to Gorky in 1980, gained a seat in
the parliament.
   The first non-Communist government in the bloc was formed in
Poland. Hungary moved toward democracy, abandoned its Communist
Party and removed the red stars from its buildings.
   East Germans rose up, deserted their discredited leaders and
headed West by the thousands. Others marched through the streets
shouting, ``We are the people!'' In a few days, the old leaders
were gone, elections were promised and the cold, concrete Berlin
Wall was opened.
   Berliners from east and west mingled freely and drank together
for the first time since 1961, turning the forbidding zone around
the wall into a huge block party. German hopes of a reunited nation
in a few years were rekindled.
   On Friday in Sofia, Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov resigned after 35
years as Communist Party leader, leaving Nicolae Ceausescu of
Romania as the last of the old-line leaders still in power in
Eastern Europe. Janos Kadar resigned in 1988 and Erich Honecker,
who had run the East German Communist Party for 18 years, was
ousted in October.
   Romania and Czechoslovakia stubbornly resisted change. But after
the sweeping changes in East Germany, a country that seemed firmly
imbedded in the hard-line mold, it seemed clear that pressure for
change would mount in Bucharest and Prague.
   It was Gorbachev who provided the thrust for change.
   In 1985 he took over a Soviet Union mired in economic problems,
tired of two decades of stagnation and thirsty for a freer life. As
he grappled with his domestic problems, admiring shouts of ``Gorby,
Gorby!'' rang out from Czechs, Hungarians and East Germans when he
traveled to those countries. His call for perestroika, or
restructuring, and glasnost, more openess, resonated through the
bloc and emboldened those pressing for change.
   At home, Gorbachev's changes touched off a resurgence of
nationalism from the Baltic republics in the north to Azerbaijan,
Armenia and Georgia in the south. Soviet workers were emboldened to
strike to back up demands for better living conditions.
   In the East bloc, Hungary had been quietly working to
liberalize. It moved swiftly after Gorbachev made clear that each
country could choose its own way. In one more symbolic toppling of
Communist power, Hungary removed a statue of Lenin near Budapest's
Heroes Square.
   Parliament last month rewrote the constitution to eliminate all
references to the leading role of the Communist Party in Hungary
and to build a legal groundwork for the first free multi-party
elections since the communists consolidated power in 1948.
   Hungary also moved to rehabilitate those involved in the 1956
uprising that was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   A new Western-European oriented Socialist Party replaced the
Communist Party and has promised to relinquish power if it loses
the elections.
   In Poland, convulsed since 1980 by strikes, growth of the
Solidarity trade union movement and imposition of martial law,
Eastern Europe's first non-Communist government was established. It
is led by Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki, an activist of the once
banned Solidarity movement.
   As in the Soviet Union, the first free elections resulted in
widespread repudiation of Communist Party candidates, vividly
demonstrating that people were tired of Communist failures. The
basic changes left a non-Communist government in Poland to struggle
with an economy ruined by years of mismanagement.
   The Soviet Union in April began making troop cuts in Hungary,
Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany as part of Gorbachev's now
policy of reducing arms in central Europe.
   The Soviet leader, at a landmark summit meeting of the
seven-member Warsaw Pact in July, agreed with other leaders that
each country has ``the right to make its own political lines,
strategy and tactics without any outside interference.''
   If that position is maintained, it will mark the end of the
so-called ``Brezhnev Doctrine,' invoked by the Kremlin to justify
Soviet military intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   Even in countries most resistant to change _ Czechoslovakia,
Romania and Bulgaria _ leaders have had to face increasing
opposition by citizens calling for reform.
   With Zhivkov's departure in Bulgaria, the new leader, Petar
Mladenov, immediately issued a call for political reform.
   Popular discontent in Romania and Czechoslovakia has been kept
in check by police, but people are beginning to believe their
rulers can no longer call on Soviet tanks to back a crackdown.

   A man who police say is wanted for attempted
murder rammed his car into the door of a Roman Catholic church
Saturday and claimed to hold a person hostage in a choir loft,
police said.
   Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis said the man claimed he took
a hostage at a truck stop before driving the car into the
plate-glass entrance to All Saints Church around 7:45 a.m., about a
half-hour before a scheduled Mass.
   The church was locked and no one was inside at the time, Leis
said.
   Authorities said they were unable to confirm whether the man had
a hostage or whether he was armed. No shots have been fired.
   The 33-year-old man's name was not immediately released. Leis
said he is wanted in an assault earlier in the week on his brother
in Reading, Ohio. Authorities said the man had been undergoing
counseling at the church.
   A police negotiating team and the man's parents have been called
to the church in an attempt to persuade him to surrender, Leis said.

   A BBC anchorman sat in an East Berlin studio,
flanked by an East German dissident and a West German newspaper
editor. On the table lay a brick from the Berlin Wall.
   It was one of the hundreds of breathtaking scenes that have
drifted across the Iron Curtain onto the TV screens of Western
Europe in the past 48 hours, as a wind of change becomes a
revolutionary storm.
   Most Western Europeans have grown up with a sense that their
world halted at the Berlin Wall. The division of their continent
had come to seem as unchangeable as the Atlantic Ocean.
   But few could have failed to share the emotion felt by Jurgen
Sudhoff, a West German Foreign Ministry official, who told the BBC
he had seen the wall go up in 1961, and, watching it being
breached, ``I couldn't hold my tears.''
   Live TV broadcasts and huge front-page pictures brought the
drama to Western Europe. The Paris daily Liberation filled its
front page with a photo of East Germans climbing over the wall.
``What a story!'' exclaimed the headline.
   Some saw it as the end of Hitler's Europe _ the divided
continent that emerged from the ashes of the Third Reich. Others
saw symbolism in the timing _ the weekend that commemorates the end
of the century's other conflagration, World War I.
   The changes are moving too fast for the analysts to keep pace.
Nobody knows where they are heading. For the moment, the
inclination is to put aside the guessing games and simply let fly
the emotions.
   And what a heart-stopping autumn it has been: a non-Communist
prime minister in Poland; Hungary's abandonment of communism as the
government creed; the crumbling of the Berlin Wall just months
after an East German leader vowed it would stand for 100 years.
   On Friday, almost ignored in the hubbub, Bulgarian Communist
Party chief Todor Zhivkov, the longest-serving Eastern European
leader, resigned after 35 years in power.
   Only last year, as the 12 nations of the European Economic
Community stepped up their drive for greater unity, their concept
of Europe still looked set in stone.
   Now, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's idea of ``our common
European home'' is suddenly less hazy, and the old notion of ``a
Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals'' becomes a concrete image in
the European mind.
   As an example of how far forward some commentators are now
willing to look, take Paul Johnson, a British conservative
commentator.
   ``In postwar Europe, we have begun to build, for the first time,
a community which looks beyond the nation-state,'' he wrote in the
weekly Spectator. ``It works, and it is growing. ... we are taking
the first steps toward an ecumenical community which will
ultimately spread to all four corners of our planet.''
   The old European order emerged from an agreement in 1945 among
the victors of World War II to divide Europe into Western and
Eastern spheres of influence pending a final peace treaty.
   The Western Europeans embraced parliamentary democracy and an
economic union designed to make future wars impossible. The East
Europeans went Communist, and no peace treaty was ever signed.
Instead, the Cold War was waged with the Berlin Wall as its front
line.
   Now, writes Neal Ascherson in The Independent newspaper, ``The
brake is off, and East Germany _ which means all Germany _ is
rolling into the future.''
   But while Chancellor Helmut Kohl may now declare that ``we are
one nation,'' the prospect of one Germany causes unease to many.
   For the EEC, it would be a colossal monkey wrench in the
hitherto smooth work toward closer economic unity, which will
climax in three years with the dropping of all trade and passport
barriers.
   The Germans already have the strongest economy in the EEC.
United, they would become by far the biggest, most populous nation
in the bloc. It may rouse long dormant fears among the French, who
have been invaded three times by Germany since 1871, and among the
British, who are historically suspicious of large powers rising to
dominate their fellow Europeans.
   It would make the role of the EEC far more important, for many
Europeans will feel that the only safe Germany is a Germany
inextricably bound up in a larger economic union.
   And what of Poland, Hungary and perhaps others? Once they are
fully free democracies, they will have met the main criterion for
EEC membership. But will the Soviet Union tolerate the natural
corollary of these states leaving Comecon, the Communist economic
bloc, and perhaps also the Warsaw Pact, the counterpart to NATO?
   Moreover, the changes engulfing Eastern Europe are dependent on
whether Gorbachev can accomplish his own country's transition,
allow Eastern Europe to go its way unthreatened by Soviet force,
and remain in office.
   NATO strategists also face long, hard rethinking. The Cold War
was always threatening, but at least NATO knew where it stood. No
longer. West Germany is the linchpin, and a united Germany takes
NATO into uncharted waters.
   Earlier this year NATO, was debating the modernization of
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe. But if the Warsaw Pact looks
less threatening, the task of persuading public opinion to accept
new missiles becomes that much harder.
   Commented the left-leaning Guardian in London: ``If the Wall can
come down, so can the alliances. Perhaps it will need a deal of
tact, and tactical deployment of generals without jobs. But we
should start the advance planning.''

<HEAD>East German Changes Spark Interest in Reunification</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The concept of a reunified Germany enjoys
support from the United States and other countries but some
analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic
German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.
   The lifting of travel restrictions by East Germany on Thursday
has breathed new life into the idea of a single German state,
drawing expressions of support from the Bush administration and
others.
   But Soviet affairs expert William Hyland says that despite these
assertions, a reunified Germany is ``really terrifying to most of
the countries involved, to the West Germans, to the United States,
Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   ``No one really wants German unity except the East German
people, and they turn out to be the decisive factor,'' says Hyland,
a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
   It was just 2{ months ago when ceremonies were held
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II, a
time when a unified Germany initiated what was to become the
slaughter of more than 50 million people.
   While a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under
any scenario, an undivided Germany could become the unchallenged
economic and political force on the continent.
   The official U.S. policy on the reunification question was
outlined last Thursday by State Department deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher.
   ``Reunification has been supported by NATO and by the United
States for 40 years, and our strongly held view is that
reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of Germany must
take place in peace and freedom,'' he said.
   As former National Security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski sees it,
the reunification issue will become ``very, very active'' if a
freely elected government takes power in East Germany.
   That possibility has been mentioned by East German leaders as
part of the ongoing reform process.
   Brzezinski asks: ``How do we arrange for the unification of
Germany, so that it doesn't become destabilizing, so it isn't a
threat to Germany's neighbors _ France, Poland, Czechoslovakia?
   ``These are the issues we really have to very hard think about.
We have to think of a new structure between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact. That is our new agenda.''
   Theodore Sorenson, a top aide to President John F. Kennedy when
the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, says he hopes a reunited Germany
will be forged as part of a reunited Europe.
   Reunification, Sorenson says, ``will pose problems, because we
couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany outside the Western
Alliance. The Soviet Union couldn't afford to have a reunited
Germany as part of the Western Alliance.
   ``That's why I hope it will be a reunited Europe within which
the reunited Germany can take place,'' Sorenson says.
   Bernard Rogers, a former commander of allied forces in Europe,
does not think reunification is inevitable. Some form of
federation, he believes, is more likely.
   Rogers notes that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has said
the nations of eastern Europe can do what they want so long as they
stay in the Warsaw Pact.
   ``If East Germany stays in the Warsaw Pact, NATO, with the best
of its ability, would try to prevent full reunification; maybe a
confederation between the two Germanys, but not a full
reunification,'' Rogers says.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, points out that
German reunification is a sensitive question for the Soviets.
   ``Soviet policy is based upon preventing a reunified,
economically strong and certainly militarily strong Germany,''
Mitchell says. ``There must be some serious apprehension in the
Soviet Union today, because the events of the last couple of days
certainly has made reunification more likely.''
   The Bush administration says it does not foresee the dismantling
of NATO under any circumstances but, according to Hyland, the
reunification of Germany could mean the demise of the alliance.
   ``It may also mean the end of Western European unity, because
both have been based on a divided Germany and a divided Europe,''
Hyland says. ``If that comes to an end and 80 million Germans are
united in a confederation or a single state, it changes the entire
map of Europe.
   ``It changes all of the geopolitics and, in effect, ends the
period we've been in since ... the beginning of the war.''

   As East Germany and Bulgaria last week joined
Poland and Hungary in the rush to restructure their creaking
Communist governments, the once-domineering Kremlin stood by,
offering restrained encouragement.
   Having told the world for 2{ years the Soviets would let their
East bloc partners set their own political courses, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is now demonstrating he meant what he said.
   Gorbachev's 1987 pledge was met with skepticism from
Czechoslovakia to Washington, but he has reiterated and
strengthened his position as he developed his ``new thinking'' in
foreign policy and promoted his concept of a ``common European
home'' for all nations on the continent.
   Western analysts first saw the proposal as a tactic to isolate
the United States from NATO allies in Western Europe, but it now is
apparent Gorbachev wants to draw back the Iron Curtain to give the
East access to more prosperous Western markets and a security built
on common interests rather than military deterrence.
   The Soviet Union crushed reform movements in Hungary in 1956 and
in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and backed the Polish government's
crackdown on Solidarity in 1981.
   But Gorbachev discarded the so-called ``Brezhnev Doctrine,''
which justified intervention in restive Communist satellites to
prevent any retreat from socialism.
   The Kremlin once would have seen reforms like those in Hungary,
which is moving toward a multi-party democracy, or in East Germany,
which threw open its borders to the West, as impermissible threats
to its ideological grip on its Warsaw Pact allies.
   But Gorbachev has espoused variety in socialism. Since he came
to power in March 1985, he has been taking ideology out of
relations with both East and West.
   ``Each country has its own specifics, and foreign parties
determine their political course with due regard for national
conditions,'' he said during an April 1987 visit to Prague,
Czechoslovakia.
   He expanded on the theme seven months later.
   ``Unity does not mean being identical or uniform,'' he said in
Moscow. ``We have also become convinced that socialism does not,
and cannot, have a model with which all (socialist systems) are
compared.''
   ``New thinking,'' as Gorbachev has defined it, means Soviet
foreign policy is based on mutual respect among nations, and he has
abandoned the traditional Communist line that it is the duty of
Communist countries to sponsor and support like-minded revolutions
elsewhere.
   He told the United Nations in December there can be ``unity in
diversity.''
   ``If we assert this politically, if we reaffirm our adherence to
freedom of choice, then there is no room for the view that some
live on Earth by virtue of divine will while others are here quite
by chance,'' he said.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the glib Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman, has dubbed the new approach to relations with Eastern
Europe the ``Sinatra Doctrine,'' named for singer Frank Sinatra,
whose signature song boasts, ``I did it my way.''
   There are risks in unleashing the allies who since World War II
have formed a buffer between the Soviet Union and Western Europe,
but the Kremlin cannot afford to continue propping up its partners
militarily and economically with its own economy in shambles.
   Gorbachev has pursued disarmament and cut military expenditures,
unilaterally withdrawing troops from Eastern Europe and Asia. He
has focused on putting the Soviet Union's political and economic
houses in order and has encouraged his allies to do the same.
   The risk of Gorbachev's hands-off policy is that the Soviet
Union will lose its front-line defenses in East Germany and
elsewhere, exposing itself to another devastating land war like the
two suffered so far this century. The Kremlin has made it clear,
therefore, that its tolerance for reform does not extend to the
redrawing of national boundaries and, particularly, the
reunification of Germany.
   The East bloc countries face a deadline of sorts for joining the
world economic community. The scheduled integration of Western
Europe's economies in 1992 threatens to widen the already obvious
gap between the standards of living in Eastern and Western Europe.
   As ideological barriers fall, help could come from Western
countries that have been reluctant to lend a hand to the repressive
regimes they considered a threat to their own security and progress.
   The role of the West in helping encourage development in the
hard-pressed East bloc countries is expected to be discussed next
month when President Bush meets Gorbachev. Bush said the
fast-moving developments in East Germany give the meeting ``even
more importance.'' Bush has said he wants to learn from Gorbachev
about the ``dynamic change'' in Eastern Europe.
   Gerasimov said the meeting ``can just be the end of the Cold
War.''

<TEXT>
   The Democrats' victories in the odd-year
elections have alerted both parties that abortion will dominate
debate in some major 1990 contests, with the potential to drown out
other issues.
   ``When you've got a pro-choice and an anti-choice candidate
running, you're going to be hearing about it,'' said Michele Davis,
head of the Republican Governors Association, who saw both her
candidates fall victim to the abortion issue last Tuesday.
   In the wake of the gubernatorial loses in New Jersey and
Virginia, some Republicans voiced alarm over the potential impact
next year, when 34 Senate seats and 36 governors' offices are up
for election. Republican officials sought to show they were not an
anti-abortion party, even though the GOP platform has been strongly
anti-abortion.
   ``We'll be supporting our pro-choice candidates as much as our
pro-life candidates,'' said Mary Matalin, the Republican National
Committee's chief of staff.
   While supporters of keeping abortion legal were celebrating
their victories, however, political strategists on both sides of
the issue were cautioning that public sentiment remains divided on
abortion. Polls conducted for both parties showed voter concern
about extremes on both sides of the issue.
   Both sides say their goal in the 1990 elections will be to try
to frame the debate early, so that the battle is fought using terms
and words most favorable to their side.
   In Virginia's race for governor, for instance, Republican J.
Marshall Coleman was put on the defensive by Democrat L. Douglas
Wilder's depiction of him as an extremist who opposed abortion even
in cases of rape or incest. Coleman spent the campaign trying to
distance himself from that position, which he took during his GOP
primary.
   Both sides and even anti-abortion leaders, such as David O'Steen
of the National Right to Life Committee, acknowledge that on rape
and incest, polls show the public supports the option of abortion.
President Bush says he supports abortions in those cases, even
though he vetoed a bill allowing federal funding of abortions for
poor women in those instances.
   O'Steen said the anti-abortion side wants to shift the debate
onto other areas, such as requiring the consent or notification of
parents when a minor girl seeks an abortion, and to attack the vast
majority of legal abortions as amounting to a form of birth control.
   If those terms become the focus of debate, some pollsters
believe, anti-abortion candidates may stand a better chance of
attracting majorities.
   ``Whichever army gets to choose the terrain dictates to some
extent the outcome of the battle,'' said Charlie Cook, analyst and
author of a political newsletter.
   ``If the code words become `abortion on demand,' `parental
consent,' and `abortion as a form of birth control,' or `abortion
in order to select the sex of a child' _ then the terrain on which
the battle is fought is going to be completely different,'' Cook
said.
   Some pro-choice groups say they want to push for candidates who
will oppose state laws requiring the consent of parents for a
minor's abortions, even while they acknowledge voter sentiment is
against them.
   ``Parental consent is going to be a new twist that's going to be
played out in the next election cycle,'' said Sharon Rodine,
president of the National Women's Political Caucus. ``We're going
to have to do an education effort as the next step of this issue.''
   Polls conducted for Democrat Wilder in Virginia _ a narrow
winner, subject to a recount _ showed that by the end of the
campaign a clear majority said they supported the pro-choice
position, said Frank Greer, Wilder's media consultant.
   But Greer cautions that those drawing lessons from the Virginia
race should be aware of how Wilder's approach was carefully drawn
to make his position appear to be the conservative one.
   His ads described the issue as keeping government out of an
individual's personal life _ and used flag-waving imagery and
conservative rhetoric that just as easily could have accompanied an
ad opposing gun-control laws.
   ``I think it is a mistake for candidates to run as pro-abortion
candidates,'' said Greer. ``It's much better to run as a candidate
wanting to keep government out of this decision.
   ``People have to do it in a sophisticated way,'' he added. ``It
is still not an easy issue to deal with in the public arena. But if
you do, I will guarantee you can run in any corner of the country
on keeping governmental control out of individuals' lives.''
   Polls conducted for the Republican Party by pollster Robert
Teeter found plurality support for a pro-choice position. Matalin
said a national Teeter poll shortly before the election showed 36
percent to 40 percent favoring abortion rights, with 26 percent to
30 percent taking an anti-abortion position and 30 percent in the
middle, inclined to favor some but not all restrictions on abortion.
   For Republicans, the immediate worry is that the issue threatens
to undermine inroads the party has made with young voters and women
who were attracted to the party in the Reagan years on economic
issues.
   Republicans enjoyed great success in winning governors' offices
during the last decade by stressing management and competence over
ideology. Abortion, some Republicans fear, may push those quieter
issues aside in favor of ideology.
   ``Those things are going to get drowned out,'' said Davis.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have become a
political force to be reckoned with in the newly stepped-up
abortion debate, appealing to Catholic politicians and discussing
sanctions against Catholic abortion rights advocates.
   Leaders of the nation's largest religious group termed abortion
``the fundamental human rights issue'' of the day in their first
meeting since the Supreme Court ruling giving states greater
discretion to limit legalized abortion.
   In an attempt to close ranks on the issue among their 53
million-member flock, the bishops also declared no Catholic can
responsibly take a pro-choice stand.
   ``We have a tremendous amount of work to do,'' said Cardinal
John O'Connor of New York, newly elected chairman of the bishops'
Committee for Pro-Life Activities. ``In my judgment, we're at a
turning point in the country. We could go one way or the other.''
   While the prelates said the ruling in Webster vs. Reproductive
Health Services offers hope for an eventual reversal of the 1973
court decision legalizing abortion, they acknowledged the recent
decision has galvanized abortion rights advocates ``to defeat
politicians who do not support permissive abortion.''
   On the day the bishops passed their resolution, Democratic
candidates who made abortion a campaign issue won the gubernatorial
race in New Jersey and apparently won in Virginia. Some GOP leaders
have since said their party needs to be more tolerant of Republican
candidates who back abortion rights.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles called on Catholics to be
courageous, ``even heroic in our beliefs,'' as they stand
increasingly alone in publicly opposing abortion.
   ``We may be in reality the only moral conscience in our country
willing to be proclaimed publicly,'' he said.
   The Catholic Church has had some success persuading active
churchgoers to accept limits on abortion.
   The Notre Dame Study of Catholic Parish Life found 69 percent of
respondents saying abortion is acceptable only under certain
extreme circumstances, such as a threat to the mother's life, rape
or incest. One-quarter of the respondents said abortion is never
acceptable.
   When asked to rank support for church policy and positions on 13
issues, the second-highest amount of support was expressed for the
church remaining strong in its opposition to abortion.
   But other polls showing little difference in abortion views
among the general population of Catholics and other groups
indicated stronger action may be needed.
   ``Over the last 16 years, by and large, we've not been a
smashing success on this issue,'' said Auxiliary Bishop Austin
Vaughan of New York.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, the outgoing chairman of
the bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities, said the church
needs to study what should be done about Catholics who advocate
abortion rights.
   The bishops did not take a stand on whether penalties should be
invoked against those Catholics, and the conference president said
ecclesiastical sanctions such as excommunication could backfire.
   ``I don't think it would help us one bit to change America's way
of thinking. It may have an adverse effect,'' said Archbishop John
May of St. Louis.
   But the bishops made it clear that Catholic politicians would no
longer go unchallenged if they adopted a ``personally opposed, but
...'' stance to justify not working for government curbs on
abortion.
   ``We urge public officials, especially Catholics, to advance
these goals in recognition of their moral responsibility to protect
the weak and defenseless among us,'' the bishops said.
   The issue first drew attention in 1984 when O'Connor crticized
Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro for
sidestepping the abortion issue.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo later that year defended Catholic
legislators who did not pursue abortion curbs, saying public
morality ``is a matter of prudential political judgment.''
   Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, responded two years
later that the idea there can be a dividing line between personal
morality and public morality raises ``a thoroughly frightening
prospect if taken literally.''
   At the bishops' meeting last week, Bernardin said he had ``grave
difficulty'' with politicians who say they are personally opposed
to abortion, but take no action.
   If one considers abortion the taking of innocent human life,
Bernardin said, ``It seems to me you have to do something about
it.''

   Here are some notes by AP correspondent Hanns
Neuerbourg from a visit behind the Berlin Wall shortly after it was
built in 1961.
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The East Berlin worker said he was quite happy
with his garden on the edge of the city and a nominal rent and that
about the only thing he was missing was ``ein bisschen Freiheit,''
a little bit of freedom.
   The teacher told of orders to question his children about their
parents' political views, adding that ``every morning when I look
into the mirror, I could spit at my face.''
   Many images come to mind in leafing through yellowed notebooks
and clippings.
   There was, of course, the armed East German soldier who jumped
over the barbed wire that was replaced a few days later by the
wall, and whose photograph, taken by an AP reporter, hit front
pages worldwide. Also the young mother holding her baby as she
jumped from an upper window in East Berlin into a safety net strung
on the Western side by her husband and fellow firemen.
   Or Nikita Khrushchev, whose name was on the first page of the
East Berlin guestbook for official delegates who were led to what
was termed the ``anti-fascist wall of protection.'' But also the
East German interpreter accompanying a French Communist Party
delegation inspecting the wall, and then seizing the occasion to
scale the wall to freedom.
   Or the U.S. and Soviet tanks facing each other at a breathtaking
moment, when one shot across the line might have triggered World
War III. Or the bodies of would-be refugees dragged back by the
East German guards who shot them.
   Or scores of other stories about what was branded a ``mockery of
human rights'' by then-Vice President Lyndon Johnson when he flew
into Berlin in August 1961, six days after the wall went up.
   By then, nearly a quarter of a million people had crossed into
the West, most by just taking a subway ride from East to West
Berlin. A few made it to the East if only temporarily _ chiefly to
get married because of an East German law allowing 18-year-olds to
marry without their parents' consent.
   In Leipzig, East Germany, a few weeks after the wall had gone
up, the traditional trade fair opened without most of the Western
exhibitors. The Communist Party daily invited those who defied the
boycott to witness the fair as a ``proof of the strength and unity
of the Socialist camp.''
   For 9 of 10 East Germans, the wall and barbed wire then were out
of view _ except for those who dared ignore a ban on watching
Western TV.
   ``Out of sight out of mind,'' remarked one Leipziger. Said
another at the Leipzig fair: ``I have my contacts and I could still
cross into the West. But I won't, because one day West Germany also
will be Communist anyway.''

   First barbed wire and cinder blocks, thrown up in panic in the
middle of the night. Then concrete and bricks, watchtowers, machine
guns, a floodlit mine field and the blood of those trying to cross
the Berlin Wall, a gray symbol of the Cold War.
   Against this obstacle, which sealed the division of a divided
city, were hurled eggs, tomatoes and TNT. The wall absorbed curses
and graffiti and the ritualistic invective of visiting presidents
and prime ministers.
   In 28 years, 5,000 East Germans escaped over the wall and 191
people died trying. On May 23, 1987, the border guards carried away
a lifeless body. Maybe this person whose name is not known was the
last to die.
   East Germans ``voting with their feet,'' as Western politicians
like to say, caused the wall to be built on Aug. 13, 1961. It ended
a hemorrhage.
   East Germans voting with their feet _ finding routes around the
wall, leaving their homes at the rate of 8,333 a day in the final
six days _ caused the Wall to be rendered meaningless in these last
few days.

   John F. Kennedy was president when the wall went up. He was
spending the weekend at Hyannisport, Mass. Secretary of State Dean
Rusk issued a statement, ``Limitation on travel within Berlin is a
violation of the four-power status of Berlin.''
   Kennedy did nothing about dismantling the wall, reasoning that
such a step would provoke a confrontation with the Soviets; anyway,
the East Germans would just rebuild it.
   Two years later, Kennedy stood on the Western side of the wall
and hurled bricks of oratory at the Communists.
   A thrilled shout arose from 150,000 West Berliners when Kennedy
said, in German: ``Ich bin ein Berliner'' _ ``I am a Berliner.''
   Every president since has called on the Communists to tear down
the wall.
   Ronald Reagan was there June 12, 1987. Addressing himself
directly to Soviet leader Mikhailk Gorbachev, Reagan said: ``If you
seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate ... open
this gate ... tear down this wall.''
   Speeches like that, replied the East German news agency ADN,
``will not make the wall go away, but on the contrary will cause it
to grow higher.''
   In Berlin, 13 months ago, American diplomat John C. Whitehead
called the wall ``a gray, monstrous snake.'' The West German
newspaper Bild called it ``inhumanity cast in stone, bondage poured
into cement.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Long before the wall was built, Berlin had become a focus of
East-West confrontation. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945,
the city was divided into American, French, British and
Soviet-controlled sectors. The Western powers were assigned land
and air corridors for transportation to Berlin across East Germany.
   But three years later, the Soviets abruptly cut off overland
access to West Berlin. To keep the city alive, the United States
and its allies launched the Berlin Airlift on June 26, 1948.
   By the time the Soviets halted their blockade and the airlift
ended on Sept. 30, 1949, more than 277,000 planeloads of supplies _
totalling about 2 million tons of food, coal and other goods _ had
been delivered to West Berlin.

   East German Communist leader Erich Honecker put the wall up 28
years ago and the wall brought Erich Honecker down last month.
   None saw its swift demise. Last Aug. 13, a West German official,
Ottfried Henning, predicted the wall might come down by the end of
the century.
   Last January, Honecker said it would ``still be standing in 50
years and even in 100 years if the reason (for its existence) are
not set aside.''
   The reason for its existence?
   At the time, the East German explanation was that it was needed
to prevent a planned attack from the West. On the day of its
construction, the newspaper Berlin Zeitung, said, ``As the day
dawned, the border was made safe.''
   In the days before its construction, the flow of East Germans to
West German became so great that it threatened to cripple the East
German economy.
   In the days before its symbolic destruction, the flow of East
Germans had become so great that the authorities acknowledged they
had to let their people go if they had any hope of keeping them
home.

   Last summer, Falk Turba, 20, a border guard who himself had
defected to West Germany, gave an interview. His message was that
sometimes even a jack booted trooper listens to his heart.
   He said the shoot-to-kill orders had been rescinded. But even
before they were, ``only about 10 percent of the hard-core, gung-ho
troops would shoot at an unarmed civilian attempting to flee.''
   But it was a great risk not to shoot, he said.
   ``If you let someone escape, you go to prison. It's also very
risky because you patrol in pairs, and you never know what the
other guy is thinking.''
   On July 12, 1989, Turba told his comrades he had problems with
his motorcycle and needed to take it for a test drive. He roared
over a hill, coasted to the border barriers _ and bounded for
freedom.
   ``I just couldn't take it anymore,'' he said.

<HEAD>Winter Heating Bills Seen Rising This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heating your home with oil or natural gas is
likely to cost more this winter than last, but supplies should be
adequate, industry and government officials say.
   A one-month stretch of unusually cold weather in certain regions
could, however, trigger some localized shortages of natural gas to
industrial and other non-residential users such as schools and
businesses, the officials said in interviews.
   Supplies of heating oil, used mainly in the Northeast, are not
in doubt, although prices are expected to be at least a few cents a
gallon higher than last winter.
   The projected rise in heating oil prices is linked to higher
prices for the petroleum from which the fuel is made. Natural gas
prices, which currently are lower than a year ago, are expected to
increase as demand rises and local distribution companies pass
along a projected small increase in their own costs.
   The government estimates that retail heating oil prices will
average about 90 cents a gallon this winter, compared with about 82
cents a gallon a year earlier. Prices usually vary across regions,
depending on weather patterns and other factors.
   About 12 million American homes burn oil for heat, and an
additional 48 million heat with natural gas.
   Because gas distribution companies are getting more of their
supply on the spot, or non-contract, market and less from the
traditional pipeline contract system, price trends and the
reliability of supplies are getting harder to foresee, analysts say.
   Paul Taylor, a vice president at Anadarko Petroleum Corp., a
Houston-based gas producer, said the number of companies forced to
temporarily curtail gas shipments to their customers has been
growing in recent years. Cutbacks were imposed in parts of
California and Texas on the coldest days two years ago, and last
winter Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, Texas and California were
affected, he said.
   ``We look at that as evidence of a growing trend: On the coldest
winter days there just is not enough gas around to meet everyone's
demands,'' he said, adding that the main problem is a seasonal
bottleneck in some pipeline systems.
   Taylor noted that supply cutbacks are imposed on industrial
users first and have not yet affected residential users. Nor are
they likely to this winter, he said.
   In a sign that the industry itself is becoming more concerned
about its capability to deliver adequate supplies of natural gas,
marketers are starting to move away from cheaper month-to-month
spot market purchases to the more dependable _ yet more expensive _
long-term supply contracts, said Kenneth Randolph, senior vice
president and general counsel of the Natural Gas Clearinghouse.
   ``There's still that possibility of running short of gas, next
year or even this year,'' Randolph said. However, the odds weigh
heavily in favor of a stable market at least for the coming winter,
unless the weather is exceptionally cold for an extended period in
both producing and consuming states, he said.
   The federal Energy Information Administration this month
slightly increased its forecast for natural gas prices but says
consumers shouldn't worry about supplies.
   The agency's latest forecast says residential natural gas prices
are likely to rise about 2 percent this winter, to an average per
thousand cubic feet of $5.57, compared with $5.48 in the same
period last year.
   Commercial inventories of natural gas are higher now than a year
ago, and despite possible pipeline bottlenecks there is little
reason to expect a serious supply problem, said Calvin Kilgore,
director of the agency's energy markets office.
   ``It's a manageable situation,'' he said.
   The American Gas Association, a trade group of gas distributors
and pipeline companies, projects a 5.9 percent jump in residential
gas prices this winter compared with last year, assuming the
weather is neither unusually harsh nor mild.
   The association said that while gas supplies should be adequate,
transportation bottlenecks and weather uncertainties could cause
prices to move erratically.
   ``During short periods in localized areas, this could even
result in physical delivery constraints on getting gas,'' the
association said in a recent report.

<HEAD>Socialist-Conservative Leaders Deadlocked in Effort to Form Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou met with
his conservative archrival Saturday in an effort to form a
coalition government and end a deepening political deadlock.
   Although the 40-minute meeting with Constantine Mitsotakis
failed to create a coalition, both leaders agreed a government
should emerge from the ongoing consultations.
   Mitsotakis said the ``pilotless economy deeply mired in
indecision ... needed urgent and immediate attention.''
   It was the second meeting within three days between the
70-year-old Papandreou, who heads the Panhellenic Socialist
Movement, or PASOK, and Mitsotakis, who leads the New Democracy
party. They are attempting to find a way to end the political
crisis created Nov. 5 when no party won a majority in parliamentary
elections.
   At separate news conferences, both leaders expressed the need to
avoid another round of elections. Mitsotakis called for an
all-party administration with a short life _ a few months _ and
made up of technocrats. Papandreou said an all-party government
should be of long duration.
   Papandreou holds a personal grudge against Mitsotakis for
splitting with Papandreou's father, George, when he was premier 25
years ago. It was evident from statements by both leaders prior to
their meeting Saturday that they would be unable to find common
ground for future cooperation.
   The 71-year-old Mitsotakis on Friday gave up a three-day
presidential mandate to form a government after no agreement was
reached with Papandreou and Harilaos Florakis, who leads the
Communist-dominated Coalition of the Left and Progress party.
   Papandreou was then given a mandate by President Christos
Sartzetakis to try to form a coalition.
   The former premier told reporters he will consult Florakis on
Sunday and propose that the ``progressive, democratic'' forces form
a government. But he sounded pessimistic an agreement could be
reached on a coalition.
   The constitution stipulates that if Papandreou is unable to form
a government by Monday, Florakis receives a presidential mandate.
If Florakis fails, Sartzetakis as a last resort calls on the
political leaders to set aside their differences and form an
all-party government.
   If this bears no fruit, Greeks will be called to the polls again
before Christmas.
   The deadlock developed when New Democracy won 148 parliamentary
seats, three short of an absolute majority in the 300-seat
Parliament, in last Sunday's election. PASOK won 128 seats, the
Coalition 21, and independents took three places. It was the second
election within five months. On June 18, a national election also
failed to produce a winner.
   There has been no government to draft a budget for 1990, and the
economy and the state machinery have been reeling under the
uncertainty.
   With a cash shortage confronting the public sector, Central Bank
Governor Dimitris Chalikias on Thursday ordered commercial banks to
stop loans to the private sector until January. Greek businessmen
demanded Chalikias' decision be rescinded.

<HEAD>From Harlem to Seattle, Blacks Hail Changes at City Hall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The election of New York City's first black
mayor was a sweet moment for Heyward Davenport, but 30 years in the
civil rights movement has taught him to look at the big picture. On
election night '89, Davenport liked what he saw.
   The Harlem political club leader stood before a portable TV and
watched David Dinkins' triumph. He saw black mayors elected for the
first time in Seattle, New Haven, Conn., and Durham, N.C. He saw L.
Douglas Wilder claim victory in Virginia, where he will be the
nation's first elected black governor if his slim lead holds up to
an expected recount.
   ``New York is the epitome of urban America, and Virginia of the
old Confederacy,'' said Davenport, who watched the returns at a
basement party in Harlem. ``This sends a message to all America
that it's OK now, we've gone beyond color barriers.
   ``There's a sense of something new happening tonight.''
   There also was a sense of history Tuesday. The Rev. Percy High
of Mount Vernon Baptist Church in Durham, N.C., said he felt it
when pulling the lever for the victorious Chester Jenkins.
   ``It was long overdue,'' said Jenkins. ``Finally, this town
becomes a town of dignity and respectability. Durham is finally
catching up with the other major communities in the state.''
Raleigh, Charlotte and Chapel Hill have all elected black mayors in
the past.
   Jim Parker, who runs a shoeshine stand in New Haven, Conn., has
known soon-to-be mayor John Daniels for years, as one of his
customers. Parker, a resident of a public housing project, believes
a black mayor will bring a new perspective to running the city.
   ``He'll be able to go into the neighborhoods that really need
him and where the problems are, and they'll give him respect,''
said Parker. ``Being from these neighborhoods will make it easier
for him to talk to people.''
   In Seattle, voters who put Norm Rice in the mayor's seat also
expect positive results. Mary McGraw, who turned out for the
mayor-elect's victory tour of several neighborhoods last week, said
his election gives the black community ``a foot in the door.''
   ``I think Seattle needed a black mayor to encourage black people
to achieve,'' said Ms. McGraw, 22, a hairdresser. ``Norm Rice, he
kept the faith. He kept going.''
   For Davenport and thousands of other blacks, there was
validation for their years of struggle for equality. During the
early 1960s, Davenport helped lead civil rights marches through
Charlotte, a time he recalled vividly while celebrating the Dinkins
victory.
   Despite the progress, Davenport said, he had wondered if a day
like Tuesday would ever come. New York was among the last of the
nation's largest cities to elect a black mayor _ Chicago, Los
Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore preceded it.
   ``Even 10 years ago, no one could have predicted what's
happened,'' said Davenport. ``It was beyond fathoming.''
   His feelings were echoed by Carl Nesfield, 63, who arrived early
Tuesday night for a cafe's promised victory party for Dinkins.
   ``This is historic. A lot of people in New York didn't think
they'd ever see this day. Up until a couple of years ago, I was
one,'' said Nesfield.
   The thrill of ground-breaking victory was tempered in some cases
by the reality of intractable problems like AIDS, homelessness and
drugs. In New Haven, departing Mayor Biagio DiLieto conceded
Daniels faced a ``horrendous litany'' of woes.
   ``I really feel good about his election. But (Daniels) inherited
a lot of problems,'' said Anderson Curtis, 26. ``It's as if the
administration got out when the ship was sinking _ just like in New
York City.''
   Durham resident Jerri Perry needed some help in identifying
mayor-elect Jenkins. She didn't vote Nov. 7; she was preoccupied
with avoiding eviction from the apartment where she lives with her
four children.
   ``Maybe he'll make the community and make everything around
better,'' the 37-year-old Mrs. Perry said doubtfully. ``It hurts so
bad. I hope he does do something (about housing).''
   Yet there was a feeling of confidence among the black
communities in each of the divergent cities that their mayors would
succeed. Nesfield said Dinkins, the city's 106th mayor, would make
a difference in New York, where killings of black youths by white
gangs in Howard Beach and Bensonhurst have stirred racial tensions.
   ``David Dinkins will bring respect to this city. I think white
people will look at black people differently,'' said Nesfield.
``The attitude will change.''

   The Virginia Legislature laid out a pitifully thin welcome mat
when Lawrence Douglas Wilder arrived at Richmond's Capitol Square
nearly 20 years ago. Even so, in the minds of some reluctant
colleagues that day, he promptly tripped over it.
   Wilder, then the only black elected to the state Senate since
Reconstruction, had barely taken his oath when he implored
replacement of the official state song, noting its lyrics extol
plantation life under ``old Massa'' and refer to the commonwealth
as ``where this old darkie's heart am longed to go.''
   ``The words burned in my ears,'' said Wilder. His words, in
turn, burned the ears of his white brethren. He was the only member
of the Senate who was not invited that year to the annual bash for
legislators at the exclusive Commonwealth Club, where he had once
worked as a busboy.
   Some things haven't changed in the Old Dominion in the two
decades since. ``Carry Me Back to Old Virginia'' is still the state
song, though rarely sung. But Doug Wilder won't find the footing
nearly so cruel in January when, barring an unexpected change in
last Tuesday's vote count, he will take his next oath at the state
capitol. The finest red carpet will be out for the new governor.
   Preliminary vote totals show that Wilder, a 58-year-old
Democrat, beat J. Marshall Coleman, a white Republican, by the
thread-thin margin of 6,582 votes.
   Coleman has said he will demand a recount. Assuming it confirms
Wilder as the winner, he will be the first elected black governor
in the history of the Republic.
   It would be naive to suggest that some people didn't vote for or
against Wilder on the basis of race. But the marvelous thing is
that no one in Virginia, a state ruled by segregationists a
generation ago, made race an issue in this campaign _ nasty as it
was on other fronts.
   Political analysts will have a field day postulating how
Virginia became the first state to elect a black governor _ not
California, where Tom Bradley came whisker-close in 1982, then
faded in 1986, and not Michigan, where Republican William Lucas
also lost in 1986.
   Pro-choice abortion activists, who campaigned hard for Wilder
with newfound voice and financial muscle, will trumpet his victory
as evidence of a shifting political tide. So will black activists
and national Democratic leaders still smarting from the Reagan and
Bush landslides.
   But any simplistic explanation simply will not do, for that
would ignore Wilder's ground-breaking achievements on a long,
patient climb to power over two decades _ not to mention the
remarkable social and political metamorphosis of the entire state.
   The Old Dominion, it is sometimes said, is now the New Dominion.
   Wilder has been a relentless, leave-nothing-to-chance
campaigner, and it could be argued that 1985, the year he won the
lieutenant governorship, marked his most important political
passage. White party leaders had pleaded with him to withdraw from
the race, lest he sink the ticket headed by Gerald Baliles, the
governor he now succeeds. Instead, Wilder began a 3,719-mile auto
tour of the state, handshaking his way through 338 cities and towns
and all 95 of the state's counties.
   Two-thirds of his $750,000 war chest that year was spent on
television ads, including one in which a beefy white policeman from
a small Virginia town delivered the endorsement of the Fraternal
Order of Police. Wilder won with 51.8 percent of the vote.
   He raised 10 times as much money for this year's governor's
race, which was a sweat-soaked reprise of 1985. He retraced his
path into virtually every country store, cafe and town hall. Some
advised him to stay out of remote, all-white regions. ``People said
I should never go out there with those people because I'd never be
seen again,'' he recalled. ``I go out there to those people, and
they say `Welcome home, Doug Wilder.'''
   In Farmville, Wilder renewed acquaintances with townspeople
beneath their monument to Confederate heroes and was led around by
Robert Bruce, a white attorney who has never lived anywhere else.
As Bruce put it: ``Folks are going to vote for him, but they aren't
going to talk about it. They aren't going to put a Wilder bumper
sticker on the truck.''
   That suited Wilder fine. His record is one of living within the
establishment while selectively challenging it, knowing when to
threaten, when to charm. He was never a street activist for civil
rights. He did not support Jesse Jackson's bid for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1984 or 1988, and spurned offers from
Jackson and other black activists to campaign for him.
   To those who think he has been too accommodating to the white
majority, he had a standard rejoinder: ``Jesse runs to inspire. I
run to win.''
   It may not have seemed that way in the beginning. He arrived at
the Legislature, already having risen from busboy to millionaire
criminal lawyer, wearing an Afro, and there was the early brouhaha
over the state song.
   Over time, the Afro gave way to a straighter silver mane, his
flamboyant attire to banker's suits. ``Someone said to me in 1985
that when he saw me wearing wingtips, he knew I was really
serious,'' he said.
   By then, Wilder was a committee chairman and one of the most
influential senators in the Legislature. He shepherded an array of
anti-discrimination laws and won a long battle to declare a holiday
honoring King _ although whites insisted that the day be shared
with Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.
   Wilder's rise, after all, took place in the city that once
served as the capital of the Confederacy, in a state that was
dominated for four decades by the segregationist political machine
of Harry F. Byrd Sr. A poll tax kept blacks effectively
disenfranchised until the mid-1960s, when the 24th Amendment to the
Constitution and the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 forced the
state to change.

<HEAD>First Vatican Conference on AIDS Won't Condone Condom Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The first Vatican conference on AIDS will
examine ways to prevent the disease by promoting changes in moral
and sexual behavior and not by condoning the use of condoms,
officials said Saturday.
   ``To provide or advise condoms, condom after condom, by states
wherever they are is a hypocritical act,'' said Archbishop Fiorenzo
Angelini, the chief organizer of the conference, which begins
Monday.
   ``It is a disloyal act,'' he added. ``It is an uneducated act.
And it does not serve as an obstacle to the disease but allows it
to develop more than one can imagine.''
   The Vatican has made it clear in the past that it disapproves of
the use of condoms as a means of slowing the spread of the deadly
disease, which can be contracted through sexual acts. But
Angelini's comments were among the strongest public assertions to
date on the issue by a Vatican official.
   Angelini, president of the Pontifical Council for Pastoral
Assistance to Health Care Workers, spoke at a news conference
presenting the three-day international congress titled, ``To Live:
Why?''
   More than 1,000 delegates from 85 countries, including some of
the world's foremost experts on AIDS, are scheduled to attend.
   Angelini, who called AIDS ``a scourge of humanity,'' said
talking about condoms is ``to trivialize'' the problem. ``It is not
possible to treat such traumatic, tragic things in such a way.''
   In an apparent reference to condom manufacturers and
advertisers, he warned of ``really dirty speculators who profit and
benefit from the tragedy.''
   The use of condoms in fighting AIDS has been a delicate issue
for the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes all forms of
artificial birth control.
   On Thursday, U.S. bishops dropped earlier conditional support
for condom education in schools and urged that AIDS prevention
instead emphasize chastity.
   Bonifacio Honings, a moral theology professor at the Lateran
Pontifical University who joined Angelini at the news conference,
rejected a suggestion that using condoms could be considered a
``lesser evil'' than infecting one's partner with AIDS by not using
them.
   ``You can't reduce an evil by another evil,'' he said. ``It
doesn't apply.''
   Angelini and Honings said prevention of AIDS must start with a
change in moral and sexual behavior. Many AIDS victims are
intravenous drug users and homosexuals, and the officials
reaffirmed the church's condemnation of homosexual activity.
   The solution is ``not in a clean syringe or in a condom,''
Honings said. ``We must help the person get away from his behavior
through his moral and spiritual capacity.''
   The Vatican conference is intended to give a ``message of love,
hope and trust'' to AIDS victims, Angelini said. The conference
opens Monday with an address by Cardinal John O'Connor of New York.
The pope plans to speak on Wednesday at the conference.

   Pro-choice activists were prepared to stage
more than 1,000 demonstrations across the nation on Sunday,
including an enormous rally at the Lincoln Memorial, in what they
say will be the largest show of support for abortion rights in
American history.
   Emboldened by the election Tuesday of pro-choice candidates in
two gubernatorial and several mayoral races, organizers of the
``National Mobilization for Women's Lives'' anticipated an overall
turnout of hundreds of thousands of people in locations ranging
from Kennebunk, Maine, to Anchorage, Alaska.
   ``The 1989 election season ... just ended with spectacular
success,'' Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for
Women, declared on the eve of the new campaign. ``This
demonstration marks the beginning of the 1990 election cycle. We
are not going to lose one day in the fight to elect candidates who
will secure abortion rights for women's lives.''
   Most of the demonstrations are scheduled for Sunday, beginning
with a sunrise ``Thousand Points of Light'' vigil in Kennebunk,
Maine, near President Bush's family retreat in adjacent
Kennebunkport. At that ceremony, ``We will say `America stands for
choice, President Bush, and your demagoguing cannot turn us
around,'' according to Faye Wattleton, president of Planned
Parenthood.
   Bush, who continues to support a proposed constitutional
amendment to ban abortion in most cases, planned to spend the day
at Camp David, Md.
   Ms. Wattleton will be joined in Kennebunk by entertainer Polly
Bergen and Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, before flying on to events elsewhere in the country.
The finale will be a sunset ``Thousand Points of Light'' vigil in
San Francisco. That phrase originally was coined by Bush to
describe the compassion and energy of America's social volunteers.
   In Washington, organizers expected tens of thousands of people
for a rally at the Lincoln Memorial, where several Republican
notables will join 15 Democratic members of Congress, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, leaders of feminist groups and a dozen Hollywood
entertainers on the platform.
   The Republican speakers were to include Sen. Bob Packwood of
Oregon, Rep. Connie Morella of Maryland, and Mary Dent Crisp,
former co-chair of the Republican National Committee and now head
of the National Coalition of Republicans for Choice.
   Among other scheduled events:
   _An old-fashioned tent revival in New Orleans, featuring gospel
music, jazz, Cajun food and celebrities Morgan Fairchild and Blythe
Danner.
   _A rally in Jefferson City, Mo., capital of the state which
enacted abortion restrictions recently upheld by the Supreme Court,
and where Sharon Rodine, president of the National Women's
Political Caucus, will be joined by celebrities Susan Sarandon and
Tim Robbins.
   _Similar rallies or vigils in most major cities and on scores of
college campuses. In Anchorage, two Republican and two Democratic
candidates for governor, all pro-choice, were to address a
gathering at the Performing Arts Center. In Phoenix, a pro-choice
banner was to be flown over the NFL football game between the
Cardinals and the Dallas Cowboys.
   On Saturday, NOW and other groups dispatched 480 volunteers to a
southeast Washington abortion clinics to counter a typical
``Operation Rescue'' raid by about 250 fervent abortion foes.
Police said they arrested 212 people after they broke through
police lines and attempted to blockade the building. NOW
spokeswoman Tiny Hoff said none of the NOW demonstrators, who
sought to clear a path for patients, was among those arrested;
police weren't sure of the breakdown.
   Also Saturday, NOW established a 24-hour honor guard at a
temporary ``Unknown Women's'' memorial, near the Washington
Monument, in remembrance of women who have died from illegal or
self-induced abortions. The structure, made of wood with a
synthetic marble coating, resembles the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
   Ms. Yard and other organizers said that because the effort is
spread across the nation, the rally at the Lincoln Monument on
Sunday likely would not match the turnout of a pro-choice
demonstration at the Capitol last April. She claimed that throng
totaled more than 600,000, but that was twice the estimate of most
news organizations and police officials.

   The Bernauer Strasse, where East German workers
smashed through the Berlin Wall to make a new crossing, was one of
the most tragic stretches of the barrier, but also the scene of a
spectacular escape to freedom.
   On Aug. 22, 1961, nine days after the Communists began building
the Berlin Wall, Ida Siekmann 59, died when she fell from the
second floor of her house onto Bernauer Strasse while trying to
jump to freedom.
   On Oct. 4, 1961, student Bernd Luenser died after a scuffle with
Communist guards on the roof of another building on the street.
Luenser missed the blanket held by West Berliners and crashed to
his death.
   On Saturday, thousands of East Berliners poured through the wall
on the Bernauer Strasse, and smiling Communist guards held the gate
open.
   Some who crossed were mindful of the tragic deaths on this spot.
   ``That is just terrible, terrible,'' said a 52-year-old East
Berlin woman who had crossed for the first time since the wall went
up. ``It just goes through and through you, right under the skin,''
she said with tears in her eyes.
   While the section of wall along the Bernauer Strasse provided
one of the most tragic chapters in the division of Berlin, it also
was the scene of one of the most famous escapes in the history of
the wall.
   On Oct. 5, 1964, 23 men, 31 women and three children crawled to
freedom through a tunnel 11 feet underground between a shed in
Strelitzer Strasse in East Berlin and Bernauer Strasse 97, on the
western side.
   There was an exchange of gunfire when East German soldiers
noticed some of the escapees, and one guard was killed. All 57 East
Berliners made it safely through the tunnel.
   The wall at this point was one of Berlin's cruelest divisions,
sundering two of the city's most historic districts, Wedding and
Prenzlauer Berg, placing the former in the West, the latter in the
East.
   The spirit of Berlin lives in both. Prenzlauer Berg is one of
East Berlin's most lively districts, site of the Gethesemane church
that provided a rallying point for the pro-democracy movement that
has engulfed East Germany.
   Wedding, too, is famous for the earthy working class humor
coursing from morning until night through its Eckkneipen, the
corner bars that are dear to every real Berliner.
   Dramatic pictures shot at Bernauer Strasse are part of all
Berlin guide books: A woman dangling from a window as Communist
officials try to pull her back, while a West Berliner holds on to
her legs. Another woman jumping to the West and landing on a safety
net held by West Berliners.
   When the East Germans poured through on Saturday, one of the
first things they saw was a line of wooden crosses that dot the
Bernauer Strasse along the wall on the Western side. Ten people are
known to have died there. A small stone monument lists their names.
   Hans-Dieter Wesa died Aug. 23, 1961, one day after Ida Siekmann.
Rudolf Urban, on Sept. 17, 1961. Olga Segler, four days later.
Luenser, the next month. Dorit Schmiel on Feb. 19, 1962. Ernst
Mund, on Sept. 4, 1962. Ottfried Reck, two months later. Two
unidentified people also died, the last on Dec. 1, 1984.

   Reformists said Saturday no meaningful
change can come to Bulgaria unless the new leadership relinquishes
the Communist Party's ``divine right'' to power.
   Todor Zhivkov, 78, stepped down Friday after 35 years as party
chief and was replaced by Petar Mladenov, who served as foreign
minister for nearly two decades and is considered more open to
change. Mladenov is 53.
   ``If the Communist Party is shortsighted enough not to drop
Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the constitution, then no radical change
will be possible,'' said Petar Beron, a zoology professor and a
leader of the ecological group Eco-Glasnost.
   The paragraph gives the party the ``leading role'' in Bulgaria.
   ``They must give up their `divine right' that `we are here
forever,''' Beron told reporters in his small office at the
National Museum of Natural History.
   Rumen Vodenicharov, who leads the Independent Committee for the
Protection of Human Rights, championed freedom of speech, less
censorship and disbanding of the all-pervasive secret police.
   ``Zhivkov must be publicly accused and punished for his serious
mistakes,'' Vodenicharov, a research chemist, told The Associated
Press.
   He said Zhivkov's harsh treatment of the 1.5 million ethnic
Turks in Bulgaria was his most serious mistake.
   ``Mladenov's handling of the Turkish issue, which is now our
biggest problem, will be a litmus test of whether he is a
reformer,'' he said.
   Vodenicharov disclosed that several independent groups were
sending a telegram to Mladenov expressing support for the change in
leadership and announcing a rally in downtown Sofia on Monday
afternoon.
   ``In principle, we welcome the changeover as the beginning of
radical changes,'' he said. ``At the same time, we would like to
warn the new leader that our position remains firm and close to all
international (human rights) agreements the Bulgarian government
has signed.''
   He and Kostadin Georgiev, a philosopher, said the question
remained whether the new party leader could break with his
political past. ``After all,'' Georgiev said, ``Mladenov is the
product of this system.''
   Beron said: ``Mladenov is perhaps the best choice of the present
set of people. He is much better educated than Zhivkov and has
international experience.''
   Mladenov ``could try to save the whole (party) machinery from
crumbling by removing some of the most unpopular people,'' he said.
   A new plenary session of the Central Committee is expected soon
and probably will approve other changes in the top party ranks to
strengthen Mladenov's position, the activists said.
   ``Bulgaria is not yet ready for pluralism, but should now be
prepared for it,'' Beron said. He added that there were many
thoughtful people in the country who could develop political
programs.
   Two new independent organizations have been formed this month,
activists reported, adding to more than a dozen already campaigning
for human rights and democratic reform.
   The Priests' Union of Orthodox clerics, banned in 1957, was
reorganized Wednesday, and former political prisoners in Plovdiv,
Bulgaria's second-largest city, established the Club of People
Sentenced Under Socialism, they said.
   Activists claim 200 political prisoners are held in Bulgaria, a
nation of 9 million people.

<HEAD>Cajun vs Creole: Black French Speakers Want Recognition of Culture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Cluse, a tall black man with a touch
of gray in his hair, speaks flawless English. He also speaks
flawless French, his first language _ and he has a gripe in both.
   ``It's not that we want to take anything away from the Cajun
culture,'' said Cluse, a Creole. ``It's just that we have seen much
that has been adopted as Cajun and needs to be claimed again as
ours.''
   Cluse, 46, is one of the founders of Creole Inc., an
organization aimed at helping the 400,000 French-speaking blacks in
southwestern Louisiana find their roots and preserve their culture,
and stress how it is distinct from that of the Cajuns.
   Today, many use the term Creole for anybody, black or white, who
traces his ancestry to Louisiana's colonial period. But Cluse uses
the term speficially for French-speaking descendents of settlers
from France, Spain, West Africa or the Caribbean. The Cajuns, on
the other hand, are descendants of people who traveled to
southwestern Louisiana from Canada.
   Cluse makes the analogy this way: ``A good gumbo takes a lot of
ingredients. We want to make sure everything is in the pot. This
area has a lot of flavors, a lot of essences. We are one of them.''
   Although his group stresses the culture of black Creoles, there
are whites who can also rightfully claim the Creole label, he said.
   ``It's difficult to separate everything, because even though the
races were separate, they were mixed. But not too long ago things
like gumbo and `dirty' rice were Creole. Now everything is being
called Cajun. We want people to remember the black, French-speaking
people here,'' he said.
   Some black Creoles were slaves during Louisiana's colonial era
and others were ``gens de couleur libres,'' or free people of color.
   Black Creoles, like their white counterparts, spoke French, went
to Roman Catholic churches and considered themselves European in
many ways.
   Cluse, an elementary school principal, did not speak English
when he entered the first grade and could not read it until he
repeated the fourth grade.
   ``I played hooky. I didn't speak. I couldn't understand what
people were saying to me. I spoke French and everyone around me was
speaking English,'' he said.
   That has changed for the region's blacks, he said, but he thinks
the swing has gone too far.
   ``I realized my own children don't speak French,'' said Cluse.
``I was worried that the French part of black history here would be
lost. Some people think maybe it should be, but we don't deny the
importance of our African history. We just want this as well.''
   Trying to preserve a common heritage for black Creoles will be
difficult, according to Joseph G. Tregle, Jr., a retired history
professor who has spent 40 years studying Creoles.
   ``There was a large community of free people of color in
Louisiana during the colonial era,'' Tregle said. ``In New Orleans
they related to the indigenous French-speaking population.
   ``They grew up in the same language and culture as the whites
did and related to them far more than they would have to the black
Creoles in the Lafayette area. Black Creoles in that area would
have identified more with their Cajun neighbors,'' Tregle said.
   Cluse agrees that there are a lot of overlapping areas in Cajun
and Creole culture in the region.
   ``We grew up speaking the same language, and the Cajuns knew
about discrimination too. You'll find crossovers between the two
groups in a lot of areas, but especially in the food we eat and the
music we make,'' he said.
   Zydeco, the music of the Creoles, has more rhythm and blues in
it than Cajun music, Cluse said.
   ``The Cajun waltz is shaped as much by the black accordion
players as it is by the Cajuns, though,'' he said.
   Creole Inc. plans to offer public French classes, produce
videotapes on Creole culture for use in schools, and help establish
contact with other countries where the variety of French spoken by
local blacks is used.

   Riot police used armored vans and tear
gas Saturday in violent clashes with workers, students and
dissidents calling for the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Six armored vans fired volleys of the choking gas into crowds at
Korea University as riot troopers battled with protesters for about
five hours in and around the campus in eastern Seoul.
   The estimated 1,000 students and dissidents at the
anti-government rally, counterattacked with firebombs, rocks and
clubs. Students claimed about 30 protesters were injured.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Overthrow the dictatorship!''
demonstrators yelled.
   About 3,000 police questioned students entering the campus and
detained several.
   Police do not usually stop protests on campus grounds, but
authorities have recently ordered a crackdown against radicals.
   In a separate incident at Dongkuk University in the capital's
downtown, about 1,000 riot police fired tear gas at students and
workers gathered for a protest.
   Police led away dozens of protesters who bombarded them with
firebombs and rocks. They gave no figures on arrests or injuries.
   The government also banned a rally planned Sunday by militant
labor unions demanding better pay and working conditions for
industrial workers.
   Police said the rally posed a threat to ``social order.'' Labor
leaders said the rally would go ahead despite the ban and they
urged some 20,000 workers to attend.
   General support for the radical student movement and dissident
groups has waned recently, following a rise in extremism and
violent tactics.
   The radicals demand the ouster of the 43,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact. They say the
soldiers hinder the reunification of South Korea with Communist
North Korea.

   In this high-tech center, ballots from
last week's election are still being counted and counted ... and
counted.
   Citizens in the city that is home to Harvard University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology log their votes by hand, and
the tally is complicated by a rare system that allows voters to
rank their selections for city council and school committee in
order of preference.
   The system is a computer-age dinosaur and a clerical nightmare,
but everyone agrees it's also a good excuse for a party.
   ``It's almost a throwback to the days of yore, when families
would sit around the radio and wait for word on the voting and who
might be the winner,'' said Sondra Scheir, director of the count.
   A grammar school gym becomes this town's collective living room.
Amid basketball hoops, wall-mounted steam radiators and
PTA-sponsored doughnuts, hundreds of residents gather to watch
their electoral system lumber along.
   As the week wears on and the suspense mounts, a piano is rolled
in for a singalong _ one of the commissioners loves to perform _
and teachers bring their classes by for a look at how the system
works.
   Under proportional representation, a British import, voters are
asked to rank lists of city council and school candidates in order
of preference.
   This year there were 28 bidders for nine council seats. The
losers are weeded out when they fail to make the ``quota,'' a
percentage of the vote arrived at by dividing the total votes by
the number of seats to be filled, plus one.
   As the people with the fewest votes are dropped from the race,
their supporters' ballots are redistributed to the indicated
second-choice. And so on, until the top nine vote-getters are
established to a roar of applause up to a week or more after the
yellow paper ballots are cast.
   ``The excitement mounts with every redistribution and the buzz
of speculation is quite pronounced,'' said Scheir, who has
participated in the count for more than a decade.
   Proportional representation means a candidate can win without a
majority of first-choice votes from the 60 percent of the
community's 47,520 voters who participated in this year's election.
   ``PR is a good way to include minority groups in the governing
of the city because every vote has the potential to make a
difference,'' said Robert R. Reardon, a former school committee
candidate.
   Cambridge adopted its quirky electoral system in 1941, both as a
means of rooting out political patronage and as a promise to newer
Portuguese, black, Hispanic and other minority residents.
   ``The Irish used to elect everybody,'' said count Commissioner
Edward Samp, the count's unofficial historian.
   ``It's come to be known as the best show in town,'' he said.
``But the principal benefit comes not from the event but what the
event represents.''
   Some residents find the system a bother, but not Connie Jarvis,
who said ``even though we live in a society where everything's
supposed to be quick, this is worth the wait.''
   Detractors say it not only takes too long for results, but
there's room for sneaking a ballot into the wrong pile.
   ``People watch each other like hawks,'' said Patrolman Francis
Horgan. ``It's incredible, but they have to keep an eye out because
every vote counts.''

<HEAD>Child Care Deal Includes Vouchers That Could Go To Church Child Care
Centers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After a decade of viewing vouchers as a
abomination that could cripple public education, liberal Democrat
are willing for the first time to write them into a law in order to
win new direct federal subsidies for child care.
   Legislation now on a fast track toward a third showdown with
President Bush on child care would allow states to issue
certificates _ or vouchers _ to low-income working parents they
could use to pay the provider of their choice, including churches,
to take care of their children.
   House Democratic leaders agreed last week to sponsor an
amendment accepting vouchers as part of a $1.2 billion expansion of
federal child care efforts in 1990 in a last-ditch effort to send a
bill to the White House before Congress' adjournment target of
Thanksgiving.
   Despite fierce opposition from the administration, both the
House and Senate have approved separate child care packages. While
virtually identical on many provisions, the Senate version would
have permitted vouchers and the House version would not.
   Bush and other conservatives support vouchers in principle but
have adamantly opposed increasing direct federal child care
subsidies other than a modest boost in funds for the pre-school
Head Start program for disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds.
   So House Republicans relented last week when Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, a conservative on most issues but a maverick supporter of
more child care subsidies forced the voucher question in a
House-Senate negotiating conference.
   To retain support from southern Democrats, the majority party's
leaders in the House had instructed the negotiators to accept
language in the Senate version on vouchers. For the first time, a
federal law would specifically allow vouchers that are exchangeable
for federal tax dollars to flow through to a church-operated
enterprise.
   Despite the marching orders, the key author of the House
measure, Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., could muster only a handful of
votes among members of his own party on the negotiating team.
   Rep. Augustus F Hawkins, D-Calif., the venerable chairman of the
House Education and Labor Committee and one of the most unabashed
liberals in Congress, cited ``sharp philosophical differences
(among) those of us who have never voted for a voucher.''
   Hawkins was willing to allow _ but not cast a vote for _ Senate
language that would allow vouchers in the $750 million portion of
the bill dealing only with day care subsidies.
   He made it clear he was equally willing to let the whole effort
die on the vine if Hatch kept insisting that vouchers also be
permitted in another part of the bill funneling an additional $300
million in 1990 to local school boards.
   Half of that money would be used to start a new combination
education-day care program for pre-school tots; the other half
would subsidize keeping local schools open all day to provide a
caretaker role as well.
   ``You're trying to take us back to the 19th century when
education was the province of the churches,'' Hawkins told Hatch.
``This is the 20th century and we have public education. We're not
going back to the 19th century.''
   Hatch surrendered on making vouchers part of the education
portion of the program in exchange for language allowing governors
in the 10 states with the most rural poverty, including Utah, to
direct some of the aid away from cities.
   ``You've taken care of the senator from Utah, but what about
us?'' protested one Farm Belt Republican on the House team.
   That is when Hatch, who long ago encountered wrath from the
White House because of his support for child care, put House
negotiators from his own party in an untenable strategic position.
   He offered them the same deal: Vote for the vouchers _ enabling
child care sponsors to put their bill on a fast track for a
showdown with Bush _ and the allocation formulas will be rejiggered
so their districts, too, could share more of the bounty.
   But to the House Republicans, that also would have meant
ignoring marching orders from Bush aides, relayed through GOP House
leaders, to do everything possible to derail the bill _ whether
from fast track or slow.
   ``They're opposed to passing it any time, this year or next,''
said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The House Republican negotiators asked for a 5-minute recess to
caucus and ask the party's leaders what to do next.
   They never returned, leaving Democrats and Hatch to iron out
several other minor issues with a promise that House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., would push through a vote on the
floor to allow a partial use of the vouchers only for day-care
warehousing that has no education component.
   ``In the interest of the White House politically, that was about
the best they could do under the circumstances,'' a grinning Hatch
said of his House GOP counterparts afterwards. ``I think we've got
their (the administration's) attention now. Maybe we can get a bill
that the president won't veto.''

   Polls closed Saturday after five days
of U.N.-supervised voting for an assembly that will write a
constitution and declare Africa's last colony independent from
South Africa.
   Thirty minutes after the election ended, U.N. Special
Representative Martti Ahtisaari called the balloting ``free and
fair,'' a declaration necessary for the counting to begin.
   ``The people of Namibia have given the whole world an exemplary
lesson in democracy,'' Ahtisaari told a news conference.
   When the counting is completed, possibly by Wednesday, Ahtisaari
will decide whether the entire election process met U.N.
requirements. He will then make a recommendation to the U.N.
Security Council on accepting the results.
   The final polling percentage was to be announced Sunday by
territorial officials, who will continue to run Namibia until an
independent government is formed. That probably will be early next
year.
   The flood of voters ebbed to a trickle on Saturday, but more
than 91 percent of the 701,483 registered voters already had cast
their ballots by Friday night. Territorial officials predicted a
voter turnout of 98 percent.
   Some of the 350 polling stations in the vast semi-desert
territory were idle Saturday morning. When voting started Tuesday,
lines at some polling stations stretched more than a mile.
   Voters elected a 72-member assembly that will write a
constitution and declare the end of 74 years of South African rule
over Namibia. The 10 competing parties will receive seats in the
assembly according to the percentage of votes they garner.
   The leftist South-West African Peoples Organization, which
fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South African rule, was
expected to get the most votes. It needed a two-thirds majority to
write a constitution without consulting the other parties.

   Two decades ago, two of Connie McWright's sons
gave their lives fighting in Vietnam. On Saturday she received the
personal thanks of President Bush.
   Bush singled out the sacrifice of Mrs. McWright at a ceremony
dedicating a Texas Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where the names of
her Marine sons, Ed and Dale, and 3,269 other Texans now are
inscribed on red granite walls.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, joined Mrs. McWright in finding her
sons' names on the tablets after an emotional Veterans Day speech
opening the new memorial.
   Mrs. McWright, 72, said in an interview afterward she felt
``just deeply honored, and I think if my boys were looking down
from heaven, they'd say, `Thank you, Mr. President, for coming.'''
   Ed McWright was killed in action in November 1966; his brother,
Dale, was killed in February 1968.
   ``I don't think they were inclined to be military men by choice,
but when there was a draft, they wanted to be in the Marines,''
said Mrs. McWright, who has two other sons and a daughter.
   The boys were born in Chicago and Hot Springs, Ark., but grew up
as teenagers in Texas and felt thoroughly Texan, their mother said.
Ed was even called ``Big Tex'' by his buddies, Bush noted in his
speech.
   Mrs. McWright, a widow since 1968, said that as they looked at
her sons' names on the wall, Bush ``just said it was a touching
moment.''
   She wrote Bush a month ago telling of her loss on the
battlefields of Vietnam and saying that Ed had dreamed of being a
ballplayer and Dale of owning a stable. Her daughter Connie, she
added, dreamed of shaking hands with a president.
   ``Mrs. McWright and Connie, it is I who am honored to shake your
hands for it is you and millions of other mothers, fathers,
daughters and sons who embody the decency, service and courage that
makes this a memorial to everything that America is and can
become,'' said Bush.
   ``This is your memorial. Ed and Dale's memorial,' he said.

   Twenty purported drug smugglers were
hanged in five Iranian provinces on Saturday as part of a campaign
to curb widespread addiction, government-run Tehran Radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said seven of the alleged
traffickers were executed in Tehran, four in Mashad, three in
Ahvaz, two in Kerman and four in two small towns in the southern
Fars province.
   More than 1,000 alleged drug traffickers have been hanged across
Iran in the past 10 months since a new law was passed mandating the
death sentence for anyone caught possessing even small quantities
of narcotics.
   The People's Mujahedeen of Iran, the main resistance group to
the Islamic fundamentalist regime, issued a statement Saturday
denouncing the executions.
   The statement, from the group's Washington office, said many of
the 1,300 people executed for supposed drug violations were in fact
political prisoners. The resistance group alleged that the
government is growing increasingly desperate in the face of
escalating domestic unrest.

   The Rolling Stones are a much more mellow bunch of
rock 'n' rollers these days, says the band's saxophone player, who
said toning down the debauchery was a matter of survival.
   ``If they would've kept that lifestyle, there wouldn't be
anybody left (alive) to play,'' said saxophone player Bobby Keys.
``They've come full circle ... it's more focused now on music.''
   Keys, who has been with the Stones for 20 years, said the band's
offstage act today doesn't have the ``excesses and extremes'' it
once was known for.
   Tickets to the Stones' Friday and Saturday concerts were sold
out well in advance. The Cotton Bowl seats 55,000 fans.
   Keys said he first met lead singer Mick Jagger and his group
when he was touring with Bobby Vee in the early 1960s.
   ``The Stones were staying at the same hotel, and Keith
(Richards), Mick and Brian (Jones) were in the room next to my
room, and they were listening to Buddy Holly music,'' Keys said.
   After the Stones band members found out Keys was from Lubbock,
which was also Holly's hometown, they began a long conversation.

<HEAD>Soldiers Sent to Kishinev, Emergency Measures Announced</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin sent planeloads of soldiers to the
Moldavian capital on Saturday after a brawl between police and
demonstrators injured 129, activists said. The government banned
rallies and restricted alcohol sales.
   Ion Hadyrka, a Soviet parliamentarian and the leader of the
People's Front movement, went on television to cancel a rally the
organization had planned for Sunday in the center of Kishinev, the
capital.
   ``We don't want any new casualties,'' People's Front spokeswoman
Natasha Pascal said in a telephone interview from Kishinev.
   Officials of the People's Front, formed last year to press for
the rights of ethnic Moldavians, said officials announced on TV
that 11 planeloads of soldiers had been brought to Kishinev to
ensure order and that armored personnel carriers were on the
outskirts of the city.
   Some students were cleared out of their dormitories to make room
for soldiers, said Yuri Rozhgo, a People's Front official.
   Vladimir Solonar, an official of the opposing Yedinstvo
organization, which was founded to protect the rights of Russians,
Ukrainians and other minorities in the republic of 4.2 million,
said despite the arrival of troops there was not an unusual number
of police or soldiers on the streets.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said the Council of
Ministers, or Cabinet, of Moldavia and the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, the republic's highest executive body, issued an emergency
decree to ensure order and public safety.
   The decree banned rallies and marches until further notice,
restricted the entry of vehicles into Kishinev, the sale of
alcohol, the presence of minors in public after 8 p.m., and the use
of radio transmitters and public address systems. The government
appealed for calm.
   Trouble in Kishinev began Nov. 7, the day marking the 1917
Bolshevik revolution that brought Communists to power. Protesters
blocked the military part of the traditional parade, and People's
Front spokesmen said police beat many would-be protesters.
   On Friday night, several thousand people gathered outside the
Interior Ministry headquarters downtown demanding the release of
about 20 people arrested Nov. 7. The crowd threw stones and
gasoline bombs at police, who responded with truncheons and water
cannons. Police finally used tear gas and fired into the air to
break up the crowd.
   Tass said 129 people were injured in the melee: 83 police and 46
protesters.
   The republic's Communist Party Politburo called the People's
Front a ``serious destabilizing factor which aggravates the
situation in Soviet Moldavia,'' Tass said.
   It charged that some People's Front supporters ``joined in an
open struggle to topple the legitimate government.''
   Rozhgo said People's Front leaders met with the Moldavian
Council of Ministers and with the republic's president and party
chief, Semyon Grossu.
   The People's Front denied it was behind the protest Nov. 7 or
the riot Friday. It is demanding that Grossu and other republic
leaders resign.
   Rozhgo charged that since the republic was hit by a wave of
strikes and protests in August over a law making Moldavian the
official language, police had beat demonstrators several times,
inflaming tension in the republic.
   Friday's confrontation ``just happened spontaneously,'' he said.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has sent
President Bush a message signaling his support for the changes
under way in East Germany and expressing hope the situation will
remain ``calm and peaceful,'' the White House said Saturday.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater announced the
message from Moscow after Bush dedicated a Texas memorial to
soldiers killed in the Vietnam War. Bush used the ceremony to link
the sacrifice of America's war dead to the dramatic events taking
place in Eastern Europe.
   In a statement, Fitzwater said Gorbachev sent an infomal message
to Bush on Friday ``to expess his support for the decisions being
taken by the new East German leadership. He underscored the
importance of the changes taking place there, and expressed the
hope that the situation will remain calm and peaceful.''
   Aboard Air Force One en route to Washington, Fitzwater said Bush
will respond to Gorbachev's message, repeating ``many of the same
things he has said, as well as offering encouragement for the
continuation of political and economic reforms.''
   The Soviet message, according to the press secretary, did not
mention the upcoming superpower meeting in Malta and contained ``no
proposals. It was more of a general letter.''
   Earlier, Bush, voicing hope of seeing the Berlin Wall ``down,
not just with holes in it,'' paused on Veterans Day to dedicate a
different wall: Red granite tablets engraved with the names of the
3,271 Texans who died in the Vietnam War.
   Standing in brilliant sunshine surrounded by a sea of flags on
the Texas State Fairgrounds, the president paid tribute to all
Americans who ``crossed the oceans to fight for the freedom of
others,'' and died in two world wars, Korea and Vietnam.
   ``Because of them, the peaceful ideals of America are now the
ideals of the world,'' said Bush.
   ``Look to the very heart of Europe, to Berlin, and you will see
a great truth shining brighter with each passing day: The quest for
freedom is stronger than steel, more permanent than concrete,''
said Bush, a decorated combat pilot in World War II.
   Earlier, in an interview published Saturday by four Texas
newspapers, Bush was asked if he felt an urge to go to Berlin to
see the unfolding events for himself.
   ``I'd like to see it with the wall down, not just holes in it,''
he replied. ``I wouldn't like to do it unless I felt that it would
contribute to peace and democracy in the area.''
   He said he would not add a stop in Berlin on the way to his
upcoming Dec. 3-4 Malta summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev ``unless there were something that developed between now
and then that would make the presence of the U.S. president
catalytic for peace or for evolution of democracy.''
   Asked if this is the end of communism, Bush said:
   ``I think we're seeing a disintegration of that form of
totalitarianism in Eastern Europe. I hope it's a contagious disease
and Castro catches it and Daniel Ortega catches it and perhaps
General Noriega catches it,'' Bush said, referring to the leaders
of the three Western Hemisphere nations most at odds with U.S.
policy, Cuba, Nicaragua and Panama.
   Early in the day, the White House released a statement in which
Bush expressed ``grave concern'' about the health of imprisoned
Cuban dissident Ernesto Diaz Rodriquez, who is on a hunger strike,
and called upon Cuban President Fidel Castro to free all political
prisoners.
   The ceremony for the $2.5 million memorial drew thousands of
veterans and their families to view the four tablets set beneath a
canopy of steel piping, with a waterwall and pool behind it. Off to
the side, by an eternal flame, stands a fifth wall with the names
of 156 Texans still listed as missing in action.
   Bush choked up as he said the soldiers killed in Vietnam ``were
black and white, red and brown; almost a quarter of the name on
this memorial are hispanic.''
   Bush read a letter from Connie McWright of Dallas, who lost two
Marine sons, Edward and Dale, in Vietnam, and later, with his wife,
Barbara, joined Mrs. McWright in viewing the granite tablets.
   Afterward, Mrs. McWright, 72, said she was ``just deeply honored
and I think if my boys were looking down from heaven, they'd say,
`Thank you Mr. President for coming.'''
   In the interview with Texas reporters, Bush was asked if he
agreed with Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, who has called for the
resignation of Danny Wall as chairman of the agency regulating the
savings and loan industry. The president said, ``I'm not closing
the door on it.''

<HEAD>Fundamentalists Say They'll Move Slowly After Poll Win</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMAL HALABY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem activists, who hold most seats in
the new Parliament, insist they have no plans for an Islamic
revolution here, but they will seek bans on alcohol and television
shows like ``Three's Company.''
   The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood captured 25 of the 80
seats in Wednesday's poll, Jordan's first nationwide parliamentary
election since 1967. Eleven more seats were won by other Islamic
factions or parties closely associated with the Brotherhood.
   Some other deputies sympathize with many of the Brotherhood's
goals, so the religious bloc could probably muster a majority on a
range of issues.
   The government can block any bills in the less powerful but
royally appointed senate, but it will have to compromise and work
with the Brotherhood if it hopes to pass its own legislation in the
lower house.
   Leading Brotherhood figures stress their pragmatism and
allegiance to King Hussein, who remains the center of power. They
deny any plan to whip up an Iranian-style revolution.
   ``As we worked with the monarchy while we were outside the
Parliament, we will work with it from inside,'' said Hammam Saeed,
who easily outpolled 50 other candidates in Amman's 5th district.
   ``Our method is to use dialogue and persuasion, and we have
never forced anybody to accept our policies,'' added Saeed, 45, a
Koranic teacher who studied postgraduate theology at Temple
University in Pennsylvania.
   Saeed said Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic laws will be ``a guide
to our new system,'' but that ``it might take long years'' to
implement Islamic sharia law based on the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   The fundamentalists triumphed despite hostility from
government-owned newspapers and Hussein's call for voters not to
mix religion and politics.
   Islamic activists indicated they would target Western-style
culture in Hussein's kingdom, where teen-age girls dress in chic
fashions and listen to rock music and where businessmen in European
suits can drink whiskey at sidewalk cafes.
   ``Alcohol is prohibited in Islam because it is harmful to health
and a waste of money,'' said Abdul-Munim Abu Zant, who easily
defeated non-Brotherhood rivals in Amman's 2nd District.
   ``We'll try to ban it in Jordan,'' he said. But he added that if
most deputies voted against them, ``then we would wash our hands''
of the issue.
   Abu Zant, 52, also said the Brotherhood would seek to require
women to wear veils or scarves to limit ``the ferocity of
adornment'' practiced by some women.
   This appeared to be a less rigid observance than the strict
Islamic codes imposed by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in
Iran, which is overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem.
   Jordan's fundamentalists, who belong to the mainstream Sunni
sect, have in the past often allied themselves with Hussein, a
descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, who founded Islam in the 7th
century.
   The organization's platform calls for banning ``evil imports ..
. such as alcohol, cigarettes, makeup and similar unnecessary
commodities.''
   It also called for expanding health insurance, building more
hospitals, improving teacher training and better care for the
elderly.
   The Brotherhood said it would try to ban payment of interest _
seen as contrary to the Koran _ and cancel Jordan's debt
rescheduling agreements with foreign lenders, an action Hussein has
ruled out.
   With the budget in their hands, lawmakers may have more
influence over the government television station, which broadcasts
many American and European programs the Islamists consider sinful.
   Saeed cited the example of the U.S. comedy show ``Three's
Company,'' which revolves around two women and a man who live in
the same house. He called it ``contrary to Islamic ideology.''
   ``No man can live under one roof with two women in this society
without marriage,'' he complained. ``This is ridiculous. ... These
films decay the human mind.''
   The Brotherhood's platform and campaign literature also demanded
Arabs ``liberate the land of Palestine from the (Jordan) river to
the sea.''
   But Parliament isn't likely to have any say on foreign policy,
which has been dominated by Hussein's efforts to win Arab
acceptance of Israel's existence and Israeli acceptance of
Palestinian rights.

<TEXT>
   The frigate Kauffman is back home after
visiting the Soviet Union and its crewmen recalled forming close
ties, with one sailor saying they were ``brothers, a brotherhood of
the sea.''
   Sailors on the decks of the Kauffman on Friday wore the caps of
the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, and the ship bore a banner combining
the Soviet and U.S. flags.
   ``It was incredible, terrific,'' Ensign Steven Hersch said of
the crew's stop at the city of Sevastopol, the first visit by a
U.S. Navy ship to a Soviet port in 14 years. ``There must have been
50,000 people standing on the pier. People were throwing gifts to
us ... money, food, clothes.
   ``I would liken it to the old war movies,'' said Hersch. ``There
were people as far as the eye could see.''
   The Kauffman, escorted by the cruiser Thomas S. Gates, visited
the Black Sea port Aug. 4 to 8 as part of an exchange between the
Soviet and U.S. navies that also brought Soviet ships to Norfolk,
Va.
   ``I don't really know how to say it. It was almost like we were
brothers, a brotherhood of the sea,'' said Petty Officer Michael
Krick. ``They asked us how much money we made. They asked me about
my house.''
   Cmdr. Richard C. Bogle said the Kauffman approached Sevastopol
in stormy weather.
   ``But as we came to the entrance, the sun borke through the
clouds and lit up the water,'' he said. ``It was almost as if the
way into Sevastopol was being guided.''
   The Kauffman's crew was allowed to visit the city and meet with
their Soviet counterparts. The Kauffman was also given a sister
ship, the cruiser Azov.
   Lt. Cmdr. George Graveson said the sailors were mobbed by people
wanting to meet an American and learn more about the United States.

<HEAD>Utility Admonishes 3-year-old for Letting Balloons Fly Free</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a 3-year-old boy released a batch of
balloons with self-addressed envelopes on them, he never expected
to the kind of response he got _ an angry letter from the electric
company.
   The Anderson Municipal Light &amp; Power Co. wrote Joseph D.
McKinney on Thursday to admonish the tot after a couple of his
helium-filled ballooons shorted out a 7,620-volt power line.
   Twenty-five homes lost power for about half an hour because of
the balloons, set free on Joesph's birthday, which were attached to
a note and a return envelope with Joseph's address on it.
   The electric company's line supervisor, Robert J. Sokol, mailed
the sternly worded letter to Joseph on Thursday, describing where
the balloons landed and how they affected the company's customers.
   ``I know this was a freak accident that did not cause any real
damage ... but when you get a little older you should be aware of
how dangerous power lines can be,'' the letter stated.
   Helped out by his father, Joseph had set eight silvery metallic
helium balloons off on Nov. 3 from his home on Indianapolis' far
east side.
   Three days later and about 30 miles to the north, two of the
balloons _ one with a Mickey Mouse picture and the other saying ``I
love you'' _ became entangled in electrical lines and caused the
power loss.
   ``Who thinks of balloons getting tangled up in anything?'' said
the boy's father, Mark E. McKinney, 28. ``I could see it if it was
a kite, not a balloon, because usually balloons go straight up and
you just don't think about it.''
   Sokol let up a bit on the stern tone when he wrapped up the
letter to Joseph.
   ``In closing,'' he wrote, ``I want to wish you a happy third
birthday.''

   Almost one year from the day Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis lost the presidential election, his wife was hospitalized
after drinking rubbing alcohol and his mother for fainting spells,
and the state posted an additional $220 million in debt.
   Just 15 months before, Dukakis stood before a cheering
convention hall in Atlanta and accepted the Democratic nomination,
basking in the glow of his image as the American immigrant dream.
   Few American political figures have fallen so far, so fast,
without the taint of scandal to hasten their demise, say historians
and political analysts.
   ``Part of it is he's not a sympathetic figure,'' said Larry
Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia.
``I feel sympathy for him now because of his wife but people really
don't feel for him. It's part of the coldness in him.
   ``When you like a politician, you're willing to forgive
transgressions. Dukakis had a lot of political capital to draw on
but no emotional capital.''
   Now things are so bad that even Massachusetts Republicans,
relentless in their attacks on Dukakis since his election loss,
have expressed some sympathy.
   ``Across the board there's a feeling that's it like a
Shakespearean tragedy,'' said Alexander Tennant, executive director
of the state Republican Party. ``They look what's happened to his
personal and political life and it's clear that it's falling
apart.''
   Dukakis' political downfall began almost immediately after the
election. In part because of a downturn in computer and other
high-tech industries, the economic boom he called the
``Massachusetts Miracle'' had evaporated like a mirage by Nov. 9,
1988, when Dukakis reported back to work at the Statehouse. The
state is facing a budget deficit of at least $720 million. In the
past 18 months, Dukakis and some Democrat legislative leaders have
enacted or proposed about $2 billion in taxes to plug the gap,
since state law requires a balanced budget.
   Dukakis was roundly denounced for neglecting his duties at home
in favor of the presidential race.
   ``He was a false front-runner and when he dropped he went into
free fall,'' said John McLaughlin, a conservative political
commentator and host of the syndicated public affairs show ``The
McLaughlin Group.''
   ``But falling from the kind of lead he has is probably unmatched
by anyone. It strikes a lot of people as odd that he seems to be
oblivious to his own low political level. Most people know when the
game is over but Michael Dukakis continues to strut as if he's
someone very much in line as a future national candidate,''
McLaughlin said.
   A historian who is harsly critical of former President Reagan
suggested that many of Dukakis' troubles stem simply from his lack
of charisma.
   ``I guess people had high hopes for him, but it all had to do
with the happenstance of politics and public affairs,'' said Henry
Steele Commager. ``After all, he's done nothing wrong. Republicans
in power have an unbroken record of chicanery and corruption.
Reagan's regime was one of the most unfortunate and dishonest we've
ever had, but since he was a popular moving picture actor, he
profited from the lack of critical acumen that has come over the
American people.''
   Dukakis' misfortunes reached closer to home last week, on the
eve of his his loss to George Bush one year ago. He returned home
Monday night to find his wife, Kitty, asleep. When he woke her to
tell her she had a phone call, she complained of feeling groggy and
sick. She was rushed by ambulance to the hospital for what was
later revealed to be a severe reaction to drinking rubbing alcohol.
   Mrs. Dukakis admitted to a 26-year addiction to amphetamines
during the presidential campaign. She was treated for alcoholism at
a facility in Newport, R.I., earlier this year, a problem her
family blamed in part to the stress of the election.
   The same day Kitty Dukakis was taken to intensive care,
86-year-old Euterpe Dukakis was hospitalized for recurring fainting
spells and later was fitted with a pacemaker. She and her
daughter-in-law remained in separate hospitals Saturday.
   Euterpe Dukakis was tentatively scheduled for release Sunday,
according to Dukakis press secretary Mindy Lubber. Lubber could not
say Saturday when Kitty Dukakis would be released.
   Dukakis, who announced Jan. 3 that he will not seek a fourth
term, has deflected resignation rumors by stressing the work that
needs to be completed during his remaining 14 months in office.

<HEAD>21 Charged with Corruption in Uzbekistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A score of top Communist Party and government
officials in the central Asian republic of Uzbekistan have been
charged with corruption after an investigation by Soviet officials,
Tass said Saturday.
   Among those charged was the republic's former Communist leader,
Inamzhon Usmankhodzhayev, who a year ago was expelled from the
national party's Central Committee.
   Usmankhodzhayev and three other officials had been accused by
the weekly magazine Ogonyok of accepting bribes.
   Tass identified 20 officials from the republic's national and
regional party organizations and local government who had been
charged.
   An investigation ``revealed that they accepted large sums of
money from their subordinates and other officials for patronage,
promotion at work and assistance in solving economic and other
problems,'' it said.
   One regional party official in the neighboring republic of
Kazakhstan also was charged, and several more investigations were
continuing, Tass said.
   An investigation of corruption in Uzbekistan was launched
shortly after the death of Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev in
1982.
   The probe eventually led to Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri D.
Churbanov, who was found guilty of corruption in December and
sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp.
   Two criminal investigators who spearheaded the probe into
Uzbekistan corruption, Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov, parlayed
their crusade into political success. Both won seats in the
Congress of People's Deputies parliament this year.
   But the two prosecutors themselves are being investigated after
allegations arose that they forced confessions from some suspects,
and Ivanov publicly accused national Politburo member Yegor K.
Ligachev of accepting bribes.
   Ligachev has denied the allegation, and the procurator's office
says it has found no evidence to corroborate it.
   Gdlyan and Ivanov have been taken off the Uzbekistan case.

   East German leader Egon Krenz ruled
out any idea of reunification in a telephone call Saturday with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a day after Communist authorities began
punching holes in the Berlin Wall.
   Kohl announced he will meet soon with the new East German
leader, and he offered financial aid if East Germany follows
through with promises of free elections and other reforms.
   Kohl convened an emergency Cabinet meeting to discuss the
developments in East Germany, where Krenz's 3-week-old government
opened the nation's borders for the first time in 28 years Thursday
and began cutting additional transit points through the Berlin Wall
on Friday.
   Kohl later flew back to Warsaw, resuming a visit to Poland that
was interrupted for 27 hours to deal with the dramatic events back
home.
   As uncertainty grows over East Germany's future, there has been
more speculation that reunification is a realistic possibility.
Krenz ruled out that possibility.
   ``It is important that we serve people, and not discuss things
that are not open to debate,'' Krenz said in an interview on the
East German television news program ``Aktuelle Kamera'' after his
conversation with Kohl.
   Krenz said that in their telephone conversation, Kohl ``referred
to'' the passage in West Germany's founding Basic Law that calls
for German reunification.
   But Krenz said any suggestion of discussing reunification was
totally out of the question, saying West German Basic Law ``is his
(Kohl's) concern.
   ``It is my concern to stress that there are two totally
sovereign German states that must get along. I will completely work
for this, but always in the interests of the citizens of East
Germany,'' Krenz said.
   The chancellor did not say who called whom, and government press
officials told The Associated Press they did not know. East
Germany's official news agency, ADN, also did not say who placed
the call.
   Speaking to reporters, Kohl said both German nations stand
before a ``massive test'' because of historic changes in the
Communist land. He said he will meet with Krenz either late this
month or in early December to discuss the changes under way in East
Germany.
   Kohl said his meeting with Krenz would not be in East Berlin,
but somewhere else he did not disclose. West Germany does not
recognize East Berlin as the capital of the Communist state.
   Kohl said his chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, will travel to
East Berlin on Nov. 21 to talk with East German officials about
possible financial support. But at the same time he called on East
Germany to institute reforms, including free elections and a
free-market economy.
   ``The federal government calls on the state and party leadership
in East Germany to finally open the gate for a fundamental change
in state, economy and society,'' Kohl said.
   The West German government already provides substantial aid to
the East German state through generous funds for maintenance of the
highways connecting Berlin with West Germany and through trade
deals that provide the Communist state with the bulk of its
hard-currency earnings.
   West German payments are estimated to be at least $550 million
per year.
   Kohl also said he is in ``constant contact'' with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev about the situation in East Germany
and with President Bush and the leaders of Britain and France as
well.
   The United States, Britain and France formally supervise West
Berlin under post-World War II agreements.
   The chancellor faces potentially enormous problems because of a
steady exodus of East Germans straining West Germany's already
burdened social welfare system. More than 200,000 East Germans have
fled to West Germany this year.

   The Soviet Union and most of its allies
on Saturday hailed East Germany's decision to open the Berlin Wall
but cautioned that the Cold War relic will still be considered a
border between the Germanys.
   Official media in Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and Hungary
carried reports about East Berlin's decision to open its borders.
Romania, which has the most repressive leadership in the bloc, has
kept a virtual news blackout on the event.
   ``The wall has ceased to be an obstacle to free movement ...
(but) it doesn't mean that it stopped to be a border as well. The
border's existence continues, as well as the border between the two
German states,'' the Czech youth daily Mlada Fronta said in an
editorial.
   ``The fossil from the Cold War years, the symbol of division of
Europe, along which many people have died, has fallen to let our
continent, the people of the East and West, learn to live together
after years of silent neighborhood,'' the newspaper said.
   The response was similar in the Soviet Union, which under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has embarked on a broad program of
social and political reforms that have spread to other Communist
nations.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said the ``decision of the East
German government is a brave and wise political step, attesting to
a complete break with old dogmas.''
   A Komsomolskaya Pravda article, titled ``A person walks through
the wall,'' described the euphoria among Germans on both sides but
emphasized concerns about what the economic and social effects of
the changes will be.
   The White House said Saturday that Gorbachev sent President Bush
a message signaling his support for the East German changes and
expressing hope the situation will remain ``calm and peaceful.''
   In Hungary, where the Communist Party itself has been banished
to history books since it disbanded last month, an editorial in the
daily Nepszava said, ``As far its function is concerned, the wall
has already collapsed.
   ``The purpose of the Berlin Wall, as opposed to its Chinese
counterpart, was not to keep invaders out, but to keep people who
wanted to leave inside.''
   The daily Magyar Hirlap wrote in an editorial that the East
German leadership ``has sought to make up for (the errors) in the
past decades in just four weeks.
   ``Now that the wall has lost its function, the process of
European rapprochement may be accelerated.''
   Another Hungarian daily, Magyar Nemzet, said in an editorial
that ``it is likely that (East German leader Egon) Krenz intended
this move as a safety valve rather than as a step toward German
unity.
   ``Now that Berlin is no longer a strong anti-perestroika
bastion, it will mean serious pressure on Czechoslovakia,'' the
newpaper said.
   Czechoslovakia's Communist leadership has resisted the sort of
far-reaching political and social reforms under way in Hungary and
Poland. Police used truncheons on Oct. 28 to break up a
demonstration by thousands of people, and hundreds were arrested.
   In Communist nonaligned Yugoslavia, the state Tanjug news agency
said East Germany's decision was ``a positive step toward removal
of bloc barriers in Europe ... (which) creates room for a change of
the postwar geopolitical picture of the European continent.''
   An official in the government press office, Krzysztof Bakalarski
told The Associated Press on Saturday that a formal statement of
the Polish government on the situation in East Germany was expected
Monday when the Cabinet meets. ``Generally we are satisfied,''
Bakalarski said.
   Poland this year installed the first East bloc government not
led by Communists.

   Liselotte Schlesinger was glad
she could leave East Germany to buy coffee, chocolate and soap, but
the thrill of crossing the long-forbidden passage West was what
really attracted her.
   ``At first I didn't believe it would be like this,'' she said as
she waited in a long line of cars headed back to East Germany.
``That's why I had to come this morning.''
   East Germans in huge numbers jammed border crossings and towns
Saturday as they swarmed into West Germany, shopped for goods
scarce at home or just took a curious look around.
   West German border police at Herleshausen, 70 miles northeast of
Frankfurt, said nearly 60,000 East Germans had crossed in just 24
hours, and people had to wait up to seven hours in a line
stretching back 40 miles.
   Many waited in lines once they got out of their cars, too. About
50 people stood outside a little grocery store. An appliance store
owner reported doing three times his normal business. And about 100
people milled around on the street to buy beer discounted
half-price for East Germans.
   Townspeople talked about the bride from Schnellmannshausen,
still in her wedding dress, who drove across with her husband in a
flower-garlanded car and said she just wanted to see what her
village looked like from the Western side of the border.
   In Frankfurt, 21-year-old mechanic Frank Hoberg marveled over
all the fruit he found in the West.
   ``They have fruits here that I've never seen before in my
life,'' said Hoberg, who was packing a shopping bag with kiwi,
pineapples and bananas.
   ``I've had pineapples before, but only from the can. I'd never
seen a kiwi either.''
   Most travelers told West German border police they were only
crossing into the West for a weekend visit as a result of the new
travel freedoms granted by the Communist East Berlin government.
   Police at Herleshausen were not even checking passports of the
visitors, waving them through and offering directions into town
where each could pick up $55 in ``welcome'' money at banks or
municipal offices.
   Elsewhere, the rush of visitors bordered on chaos. In the
northern Bavarian city of Hof near the East German border,
officials barred further traffic from entering downtown because of
the deluge of East Germans.
   In Bonn, the Interior Ministry said 140,000 East Germans arrived
overnight in West Germany. So many people entered West Berlin that
officials quit counting them.
   West German border police said East German cars were backed up
for about 24 miles at the crossing near Helmstedt, West Germany,
and there were huge lines at other crossing points as well.
   East German cars swamped parking lots in the northern West
German city of Hamburg, while Wartburgs and Trabants filled with
happy East Germans clogged West German streets and highways.
   Outside Herleshausen, West Germans waved, smiled and gave
V-for-victory signs to the visitors as they drove through.
   An electrician from Eisensach, just across the border in East
Germany, said he piled his wife and two sons into their Trabant for
a day trip ``as soon as I heard it was possible. In the beginning I
didn't understand. I thought it was only for people who wanted to
come forever.''
   But in an indication that everything has not changed overnight,
the electrician asked that he not be cited by name.
   ``We're still not used to this freedom,'' he said. ``I'm still
afraid of some disadvantage. We still don't believe that this is a
reality.''

   Two New Jersey scholars who predict the
Great Plains will revert back to the days when it was only a home
where the buffalo roam got some discouraging words from the human
herd that lives there now.
   But Frank Popper and Deborah Epstein Popper say the heated
reaction they got from the area's residents Friday _ one called
their work ``Popperscock'' _ is tinged with a fear that the theory
that much of the Plains is emptying out is prophetic.
   ``A region that was totally sure of itself, genuinely secure in
its own future, would not have made so much of this,'' said Popper,
a Rutgers University urban studies professor.
   The pair faced some hostile questions from about 125 North
Dakota journalists and others at the University of North Dakota
Editors and Broadcasters Day.
   Popper and his wife, a doctoral student in geography at Rutgers,
suggest the federal government should eventually buy up most of the
Plains to create a huge ``Buffalo Commons.''
   ``This is a theory, and you have to ask, `OK, we understand what
you're saying, but what the hell do you want us to do about it?
Leave?''' said Mark Carlson, editor of the weekly Pierce County
Tribune.
   Gov. George Sinner didn't attend the forum, but he said Thursday
that he believes the Buffalo Commons idea is a ``passing thing,''
and that the Poppers did not appreciate the importance of the
region.
   ``A vast majority of the world's food supply comes from these
Plains states,'' Sinner said. ``And I think they think the food
comes from the supermarket down the road and the electricity comes
from the switch on the wall.''
   The notion that someone from New Jersey couldn't appreciate the
Plains was expressed by some in the audience, too.
   ``I hope they enjoy it back home in toxic Jersey,'' said Lauren
Donovan, editor of the weekly Hazen Star. ``Foolishness and
Popperscock like this could only have come from a place like that.''
   But Ellen Swendsen of Hettinger, in western North Dakota, said
the couple's views were not unrealistic.
   ``I walk around and count the empty houses and I shudder,'' she
said. ``I think that what the man said made a lot of sense.''
   ``We need to be thinking critically,'' added Bismarck Tribune
reporter Jeff Olson. ``I think the challenge has been laid square
in our lap ... and I think we all realize that.''
   The Poppers' idea, first outlined in a December 1987 magazine
article, envisions a 5.5-million acre Buffalo Commons, including
large parts of North and South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska,
Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.
   The commons would come about as Plains residents gradually
abandon a relatively arid region that has never been thickly
settled, despite extensive federal inducements and subsidies.
   The couple said the 1862 Homestead Act, which gave 160 acres to
anyone willing to settle the land and stay five years, was a
historic error.
   Federal encouragement of settlement on the Plains, they wrote,
was ``the largest, longest-running agricultural and environmental
miscalculation in American history.''
   Cities like Bismarck; Lubbock, Texas; and Cheyenne, Wyo., would
be left to the roles of ``urban islands in a shortgrass sea,'' as
one-fifth of America's land area gradually becomes ``the world's
largest historic preservation project, the ultimate national
park,'' Frank Popper said.
   The Poppers are developing maps of each of the states within the
commons to buttress their arguments that the region is in long-term
decline. Their North Dakota maps document 16 counties with
significant poverty, population losses and little building activity.
   The counties, which have a combined population between 60,000
and 70,000, ``run a high risk of becoming part of this Buffalo
Commons,'' Popper said.
   Popper acknowledges if the counties lose all their residents, it
would ``involve a great deal of individual suffering and community
hardship.''
   But he said he does not believe the commons area will lose its
entire population, nor does he advocate aggressive federal
intervention in creating the preserve.
   ``We never advocated any kind of rural version of some horrible
urban-renewal project,'' he said.
   ``If somehow our work gets the Plains so irritated at us that
the region is inspired to pull up its socks, just to prove what
waterheads we are, we'd be delighted. We really would.''

   Rainer Himpel had his family up at 3 a.m. for the
long drive to and through the Berlin Wall, buoyed by visions of
shopping bags bulging with treats unavailable at home.
   As the sun set over Berlin on Saturday, Himpel hadn't spent a
pfennig. The wall was open all day, but stores in West Germany
close for the weekend at 2 p.m. Saturday, by law. The law was
suspended in some parts of West Germany because of the special
circumstances, but not in downtown West Berlin.
   Although they could not shop, the family returned home with
souvenir memories: a kiss from a drunk, a U-turn with a befuddled
old woman in a crowded Volkswagen van and a feeling of bewilderment
in a strange land, the other half of their own Germany's capital
city.
   They also had all 400 marks ($220) the family collected from the
West German government, which offers 100 marks to each new arrival
from East Germany.
   ``It could have been a lot better,'' Himpel said, disdaining the
trinkets available in a street market. ``We'll come back. Now we
have the opportunity.''
   The family had driven 4{ hours from their home in Siebenlehn, a
town of 1,200 where Himpel and his wife Monika run an auto body
shop.
   They specialize in fixing Trabants, the gimcrack East German
cars abandoned by the thousands of East Germans who moved West in
the weeks before the wall was opened. A ``Trabbi'' usually rusts
before it's dented, Himpel said.
   It took 90 minutes to get into West Berlin from the Eastern
sector, then there was a three-hour wait at the Bank fuer Handel
und Industrie for the ``welcome money.''
   While Himpel stood in line, 11-year-old Tanja and Lars, 12,
checked out the Ratzekatz toy shop, marking it as stop No. 1 on the
shopping spree.
   With the marks in hand, however, the family found a long line
outside the toy shop. ``Just like home,'' Mrs. Himpel, a cheerful
woman, said with a shrug.
   They went along to the Hertie department store. It was closed.
Lars looked thunderstruck.
   The sun now hugged the horizon on a crisp autumn day that was
turning cold. They tried the subway, but police were directing
people away because it was too crowded. They waited for a bus, in
vain. Taxis rolled by, but all were taken.
   At another bus stop, the Himpels got lucky with a Volkswagen
van. Albrecht Gramberg, the owner, waved them into the back along
with two other East Germans and an elderly woman with a cane who
had to be coaxed aboard.
   Three more people filled the front seat and Gramberg laughed
loudly as two more hitchhikers tried to flag him down.
   ``I get the impression that everyone in Berlin is stoned,'' he
said. ``It's like Woodstock _ love, peace and happiness _ because
all signs and symbols of power are done.''
   ``In another month, it has to be more serious,'' he added in
English, ``but for now, it's a lot of fun.''
   A woman in the back, spending her second day in the West without
having gotten into a store, said it also was very frustrating.
   Hardly the best place for a lady with a cane she observed to the
elderly woman, who replied: ``I live here.'' Where? Back by the bus
stop. Gramberg made a U-turn.
   By 4:30, hunger had led them to a tavern for bratwurst all
around.
   No more bratwurst, the waitress said.
   ``Just like home,'' Mrs. Himpel said.
   A small, dark-haired woman lurched to the table, brimming with
beer and good will.
   ``You're just like us, just like us,'' she said, and planted a
big smack on Mrs. Himpel's cheek while Tanja made faces behind her.
   ``She's not a regular,'' the waitress explained, ``but today,
nothing is normal.''

   Virginia Sen. John Warner led thousands of
people at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Saturday in a solemn
tribute to the 58,175 Americans whose names are inscribed on its
black granite and a spontaneous celebration of another wall
crumbling in Berlin.
   ``This memorial is one of incalculable majesty and mystique,''
said Warner in a Veterans Day ceremony marking the recent addition
of 19 names to the dark mirror of America's Vietnam toll. ``It
conveys the message that victory is ours _ not the traditional
military victory, but a nation approaching victory with itself ...
a nation healing.''
   The gathering of more than 6,500 people, including families of
those whose names were newly inscribed, greeted with a booming
cheer Warner's observation that: ``There is another wall. And that
wall, as we speak, is crumbling down. It falls because its
foundation of communist suppression is being exposed to truth and
to democracy.''
   But Warner cautioned that despite the dramatic openings between
East and West, ``We cannot let our euphoria erode our will to
provide America with the defense that we need.
   ``We must remind ourselves that (Soviet leader Mikhail)
Gorbachev has not become a pacifist,'' he said. ``The Soviet Union
still maintains the largest army in the world, and its navy
continues to grow. ... It remains a potent military threat to the
security of the United States.''
   The ceremony, beneath sparkling sunshine, was moderated by Jan
C. Scruggs, the Vietnam war veteran who led the long and difficult
fight to build the memorial, since visited by millions of Americans
who daily leave wreaths, love letters, ribbons and medals,
countless flags and other remembrances on the sidewalk beneath the
names.
   ``In one way or another, we are all related to the names on tat
wall,'' said Vietnam veteran Ronald F. Gibbs.
   Maria Eldredge, of Mills, Wyo., read aloud the names of the 19
men whose deaths were overlooked in years past or who have since
died of wounds or disease incurred in Vietnam. Among them was her
brother, Army Spec. 4 Jose Leopoldo Lujan, of Natrons, Wyo., who
recently died at a Veterans Administration hospital.
   The others: Army Pfc. Robert Bruce Annas, Granite Falls, N.C.;
Marine Capt. John Frederick Anthony, Port Huron, Mich.; Air Force
Maj. Michael J. Bosiljevac, Omaha, Neb.; Army Spec. 4 Robert Dennis
Brown, Troy, Ohio; Army Pfc. Robert C. Cothran, Mt. Pleasant,
Tenn.; Navy Lt. Tom Joseph Cress, Milwaukee; Marine Pfc. Charles C.
Curtis Jr., Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   Also: Navy Fireman Billy D. Hooper, Blue Earth, Minn.; Army
Spec.4 Freddy Paul Heugel, Dearborn Heights, Mich.; Army Pfc.
Philip V. MacKinney, Springfield, Greene, Mo.; Navy Seaman Richard
D. Mattson, Fraser, Mich.; Army Spec. 4 Paul Francis Newman Jr.,
Pinehurst, Mass.; Army Pfc. John Nishimura, Morgan Hill, Calif.;
Army Spec. 4 David James Pugliesi, Quincy, Mass.; Army Capt.
William C. Strevel Jr., Atlanta; Marine Lance Cpl. Melvin E.
Taylor, Paterson, N.J.; Navy Seaman Paul Isaac Vegas, Redondo
Beach, Calif., and Army Pvt. 1 Wilbert Walton, Fayetteville, N.C.
   After a bugler from the Army's 82nd Airborne played taps,
hundreds of people surged to the wall to find, touch, and trace the
names most special to them. It was a common scene at the wall;
there, every day is Veterans Day.

   A mild underwater earthquake struck about
20 miles off the coast of Cape Mendocino on Saturday morning,
according to state officials.
   No damage or injuries were reported in the quake, which hit at
11:23 a.m. and registered 4.25 on the Richter scale, according to
Chuck Young, a spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Services
in Sacramento.
   The center of the quake was about 300 miles to the
north-northwest of the epicenter of the 7.1 quake that wracked the
San Francisco Bay area last month.
   Cape Mendocino, the farthermost west point on the California
coastline, is in Humboldt County about 30 miles south of Eureka.
   A radio station in the coastal town of Fort Bragg reported three
calls from residents who felt the temblor.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage if
centered on land.

<TEXT>
   Astronauts and cosmonauts began a
five-day conference Saturday focusing on the peaceful use of space
technology.
   Russel Schweickart, an Apollo 9 astronaut and co-chairman of the
Association of Space Explorers, said one item high on the agenda is
a proposed ``Rescue in Space'' program that would include laws and
facilities to aid spaceships in distress.
   ``Space for Earth'' is the theme of the group's fifth Planetary
Congress and is the title of an address to be delivered by India's
Dr. Yash Pal, this year's winner of the association's award for his
work in designing a satellite network to serve rural areas.
   Schweickart and Soviet Maj. Gen. Alexei Leonov, co-chairmen of
the association, expressed hope their governments will eventually
agree to send a joint team to Mars. Schweickart, an Apollo 9
astronaut, said the association has submitted a recommendation to
the U.S. Congress to accept the principle of such a voyage.
   ``It's much easier and far less costly for us ... to fly
together to Mars,'' Leonov told a news conference. ``We fervently
hope we will do it jointly.''
   Leonov, the first man to walk in space, also underscored the
importance of biomedical studies in space and experimenting with
plant cultivation on Mars.
   Saudi astronaut Prince Sultan bin Salman, the first Arab to
visit outer space, appealed to reporters to exhort peoples and
governments of the world to support the Association.
   A major in the Saudi Air Force, the young prince, the host of
the conference, was aboard a U.S. Space Shuttle Discovery flight in
1985.
   The astronauts listened to reporters' questions about space
being infested with spy satellites and threatened by tension
between the superpowers.
   Schweickart said the congress can only recommend means of
employing space technology for the good of mankind, and Leonov
stressed that ``we (congress members) are against wars of all
kinds, be them on Earth or in space. War is the ugliest affliction
to which mankind can be subjected.''
   Soviet cosmonauts, apparently aware of being hosted by the
guardians of the Islamic faith, guardedly shirked atheism and
conceded that God exists. Leonov lauded Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev for ``reinstating religion to its rightful place in (the
Soviet) society.''
   ``Indeed, this is one of Gorbachev's wisest decisions,'' he
said. ``We know that Karl Marx had said that religion is the opium
of peoples ... what a blissful opium.''
   The Saudis have mobilized a fleet of military jets to fly the
guest spacemen to deliver lectures at universities, military
academies and technical institutes along the vast kingdom on
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Saadeh Defends Peace Accord with Moslems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Saadeh, a leading Christian
parliamentarian and head of the right-wing Phalange Party, on
Saturday defended a peace accord forged last month with Moslem
legislators and opposed by hard-line Christian leader Gen. Michel
Aoun.
   His remarks underscored a split in Christian ranks that widened
after the accord was ratified and after Christian Rene Mouawad was
elected president. Mouawad was elected in a special parliament
session that convened last week over Aoun's objections.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, who brokered the accord drafted last
month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, said he was confident Lebanon was
moving toward peace after 14 years of civil war.
   Saadeh spoke from his home village of Shibtine, on the northern
edge of the Christian heartland, in an interview broadcast by his
party's radio station, Voice of Lebanon.
   Christian officials have admitted privately that no Christian
politician based in east Beirut would join Mouawad's proposed
national reconciliation government before a settlement with Aoun is
achieved.
   Responding to Aoun's accusations that the parliamentarians were
``traitors'' for agreeing to an accord that does not include a
deadline for withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, Saadeh said,
``What we worked out was a major achievement safeguarding Lebanon's
unity.''
   The agreement gives the Syrians two years to withdraw from the
Beirut area toward the eastern Bekaa valley. It states that their
mission and stay there will be defined by the Lebanese and Syrian
governments, Saadeh said.
   But Aoun, whose troops fought the Syrians for six months this
year before a September cease-fire, also wants a deadline for their
evacuation from the Bekaa as well.
   The Syrians are in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate. Aoun said they broke that mandate by siding with the
Moslems in the civil war, and he vowed to drive them out.
   Christian Parliamentarians, including Saadeh, did not return to
their homes in the Christian enclave after the accord was approved
because they feared Aoun's wrath.
   Aoun controls the enclave with some 20,000 soldiers still loyal
to him. Saadeh moved this week to Shibtine _ one of several hamlets
controlled by Phalange Party militiamen.
   Aoun, 54, refuses to recognize Mouawad's election and has
remained entrenched in the presidential palace.
   Moslems have supported Mouawad's election.
   Saadeh did not say if he would join a national reconciliation
Cabinet and a delay is expected in forming a government.
   But Fahd told the Saudi newspaper Okaz: ``I cannot have any
doubt ... that Lebanon has found the right path.''
   Morocco's King Hassan II and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid
are joined with Fahd on an Arab committee seeking to settle the
Lebanon dispute.
   Fahd reaffirmed the commitee's support for Mouawad and promised
financial support to help reconstruct Lebanon's war-torn economy.

   A World War II land mine exploded near a Libyan
village, killing three members of a family and wounding three
others, the official Libyan news agency JANA reported Saturday.
   In a dispatch monitored in Rome, JANA said the mine exploded
near the village of Al Riania, about 45 miles west of Tobruk in
Libya's northeastern coastal strip.
   The agency said the mine killed Messaoud Mohammed Kadi, 60, and
his sons Kadi Messaoud Mohammed Kadi, 25, and Daw Messaoud Mohammed
Kadi, 30.
   It also said the blast seriously injured the father's wife,
Khadija Abdellah Messaoud, 45, and her 3- and 2-year-old
grandchildren.
   Italy and other countries that fought in Libya during the war
left hundreds of thousands of mines throughout the North African
country, and Libya has demanded their governments turn over maps of
the minefields, JANA said.
   Libya claims such mines have killed thousands of Libyans.

   The head of Honduran police said
Saturday his forces will begin disarming Nicaraguan Contras around
the country this week to guarantee peaceful general elections here.
   Col. Lazaro Avila, chief of the Public Security Force, told a
news conference the nationwide disarming program would start
Monday. He said the Nov. 26 elections ``will not be tarnished by
intranquility.''
   However, with only 5,000 men, he did not say how his forces
would cope if they met resistance from the more than 12,000
U.S.-backed Contras living in Honduras.
   ``While I truthfully don't know the exact location of these
people or their equipment, the disarming is indiscriminate and
there will be no exceptions,'' Avila said.
   Hondurans will elect a president, three vice-presidents, 130
members of Congress and 289 municipal councils for four-year terms.
   Contra leaders, who have traditionally expressed an
unwillingness to disarm, could not be reached for immediate comment.
   The anti-Communist rebels and their dependents live in camps
along the Nicaraguan border nearly 200 miles southeast of
Tegucigalpa.
   They have been living in the camps since last year but are to be
disbanded and relocated by Dec. 8 under regional peace accords
signed August in Tela, Honduras.
   An international commission organized by the United Nations and
Organization of American States is charged with overseeing the
relocation. In return, Nicaragua promised free and fair elections
in 1990.
   The Contras were not present at the signing of the accords, and
the rebels' army commander, Israel Galeano, has said his men will
ignore the agreements.
   The Nicaraguan government said that as of mid-1989, the
8-year-old war with the Contras had caused 57,000 deaths, injuries
or disappearances.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Saturday
praised the events in East Germany and other Soviet bloc countries
as popular revolutions, but he cautioned that potential dangers
exist.
   ``What is happening today in Eastern Europe is an earthquake, an
enormous revolution that comes from within the people,'' he said in
an interview with Israel radio.
   ``I also think these changes raise various problems to which the
international community has not provided a response yet,'' he said.
``For example, the fate of Germany, of both Germanys: would there
be some basis for the existence of both Germanys, would the
European countries agree to a united Germany?''
   Shamir noted ``interesting processes'' in other countries of the
Soviet bloc, where countries are instituting democratic and
market-oriented reform. But he said the changes might be dangerous
since ``they have not reached stability yet. It will apparently
take time, and that period of instability carries many dangers.''
   He also said reform under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
``largely depends on whether the Soviet leaders would be able to
control the forces they unleashed themselves. So we are living in a
really turbulent period.''
   Shamir said he wished to see the Middle East follow the example
of democratic movements in the Soviet bloc.
   ``We should be sorry that all these positive changes have not
reached the Middle East. In the Middle East, we don't see any moves
for more democracy, peace and reconciliation. The only contribution
we can see in this direction of advancing toward peace, I have to
say, is our peace initiative,'' Shamir said.
   The peace initiative, adopted by the government in May, calls
for Palestinian elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
to choose representatives for talks with Israel on an interim
period of self-rule.

<TEXT>
   A presidential preference poll
published Saturday gave Fernando Collor de Mello of the National
Reconstruction Party a strong lead over two leftist opponents.
   Collor de Mello, a center-right politician, was the choice for
Wednesday's election by of 26 percent of voters polled by the
Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics, the newspaper
O Globo reported.
   Leonel Brizola of the left-wing Democratic Labor Party was
second with 14 percent and Rep. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the
Marxist-oriented Workers' Party third with 13 percent.
   Sen. Mario Covas of the left-of-center Brazilian Social
Democracy Party, continued gaining, adding two points to 9 percent
since the institute's last sampling.
   It was the first poll since Silvio Santos, a television
personality who had been among the leaders since entering the race
Oct. 31, was taken off the ballot when an electoral court ruled
that he violated election guidelines.
   The institute questioned 3,650 people in 270 cities in this
nation of 150 million people between Monday and Friday. O Globo did
not give the margin of error.
   Several of the latest polls showed Collor de Mello and Santos,
who is popular among the poor, tied at 21 percent.
   If no candidate wins a majority Wednesday, the two leaders will
compete in a runoff Dec. 17 for a five-year term as president.
   This is the first popular election for president since 1960.
There were no free elections during military rule in 1964-85 and
Sarney was chosen by an electoral college.

   Rose Ficarelli's concern with the Chicago Bears
is not whether they win or lose, but how badly they rip their
uniforms.
   Mrs. Ficarelli _ still working full time at 96 _ mends the
team's shirts and pants after every game.
   ``Oh, they were terrible,'' she said after Sunday's game against
Green Bay. ``All kinds of rips and tears ... especially in the
shoulders. When they fall down, they seem to throw themselves onto
one shoulder, so you get this.''
   She held up Tom Thayer's game jersey, full of stitches and
alterations.
   ``Look how beated up it is,'' she said. ``Some of the guys are
so superstitious they'll wear a shirt until it falls off.''
   Mrs. Ficarelli works with an old Singer sewing machine at the
All American Co. athletic equipment reconditioning plant in
suburban Franklin Park, peering through black spectacles with jewel
inlays. She has been sewing team uniforms since 1938, and reparing
Bears jerseys since 1951.
   ``By the end of the year I say sometimes that it's just my
stitching that holds them together,'' she said.
   Even though Mrs. Ficarelli is doubtless among the oldest
full-time workers in the United States, ``her attendance record is
better than anyone's,'' said her boss, Ray Gluss. ``We've
practically got to chase her to get her out of here.''
   The company employs 30 and serves dozens of high school and
college teams. But Mrs. Ficarelli takes primary responsibility for
the Bears' jerseys.
   When the plant was in Chicago, players used to drop by, and Mrs.
Ficarelli would write inspirational notes and stuff them inside the
jerseys.
   ``I'd put, `Take care, don't get hurt, I hope my prayers will be
answered this week,' things like that,'' she said.
   But when the company moved to the suburbs, personal contact
ended and she stopped writing the notes. On her recent birthday,
however, she visited Halas Hall at the Bears' training camp.
   ``This is me with Richard Dent,'' she said, pulling out a
photograph of her talking to the defensive end from her black,
snap-close purse.
   ``I'm telling him to stop tearing his shirt,'' she said.

   A post-campaign commercial by Gov.-elect
James Florio that began airing Saturday may prompt a few double
takes. There's no campaign retoric this time, just a simple word of
thanks.
   In the ad, a beaming Florio tells voters he appreciates the
landslide victory they gave him Tuesday over Republican James
Courter.
   He also gives the address of his transition office and invites
them to send suggestions.
   ``It's the first time I ever heard of anyone doing that,'' said
Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia government professor who
studies political consulting and collects campaign commercials.
   ``That's fascinating. It's brilliant,'' Sabato said.
   ``It's an electronic version of the tradition of standing on
street corners shaking hands, which victorious politicians have
been doing for years,'' said another University of Virginia
professor, Michael Cornfield.
   The campaign was one of the nastiest ever in New Jersey and the
televised ads by both candidates were often scathing attacks. One
Florio ad had Courter's nose growing to Pinocchio length, and in
Courter responded with one showing Florio's nose extending while
his own grew shorter.

   Peruvians will risk their lives Sunday to
elect local leaders who may not survive their terms of office, a
grim test of the nation's ability to survive a relentless terror
campaign by leftist guerrillas.
   The Shining Path rebel movement has mounted the heaviest
offensive in its nine-year insurgency in an effort to disrupt
Sunday's municipal balloting. The rebels say the violence is the
first stage in their strategy to block April's presidential
election.
   More than 130 mayors, local judges, clerks, councilmen and
municipal candidates have been slain this year, and hundreds more
have resigned in fear.
   Last month was dubbed ``Red October'' by the Lima press after
330 people were killed in fighting and political violence.
   Authorities have admitted the government cannot provide
protection to the 4,000-plus mayoral candidates and are worried a
high percentage of voters may avoid the polls.
   `If the Shining Path achieves its objective of preventing voting
in a large part of the national territory, it will signify a clear
victory for terror,'' said a high government official, who spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   About 10 million people have registered to vote.
   The national election board says there are no candidates in 86
of Peru's nearly 2,000 municipalities, mostly in rural areas. But
independent political analysts say the figure is closer to 200.
   The guerrillas have concentrated their campaign of terror in
villages and small towns. But even in Lima, home to one-third of
Peru's population of 21 million, people are fearful of attacks on
election day.
   ``I'm not going to vote, no way. They say the terrorists are
going to cut off the fingers of people who vote,'' said Antonieta
de Baron, a 36-year-old homemaker.
   Voters must dip their index fingers into purple ink that does
not wear off for at least a week. In the last presidential election
in 1985, Shining Path rebels cut off the fingers of voters in
several highland villages.
   ``I would rather pay the fine and put up with the problems,''
said Mrs. de Baron.
   Voting is required by law. Violators face a fine and cannot
apply for passports, driver's licenses and other legal documents if
their voting cards are not stamped.
   Bus passengers traveling the Carretera Central, which connects
Lima with the central Andes, say rebels have confiscated their
voter registration cards at roadblocks.
   The Carretera Central leads to Junin department, in Peru's
mining and farming heartland. The Shining Path has called for a
three-day ``armed strike'' there and in the neighboring departments
of Pasco and Huanuco beginning Sunday.
   In May, in a demonstration of the Shining Path's growing
strength, about 1 million people in the three departments obeyed
the group's demand to halt work for three days, cutting all
supplies of food, electric power and mineral exports to Lima on the
Pacific coast.
   On Saturday, the bodies of a high school girl and four other
people were found near Ayacucho, police reported. They said all had
been tortured and shot in the head.
   Police said they did not know the killers and no group claimed
responsibility.
   The wave of violence in recent weeks has shifted the focus from
the candidates and their issues to the ability of the guerrillas to
disrupt the voting.
   The municipal elections have always been viewed as a testing
ground for the political parties that participate in the general
elections.
   The principal parties contending in the municipal races are the
United Left, a Marxist-led coalition; and the Democratic Front, a
center-right coalition led by novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who is
favored to win the presidential race.
   With Peru suffering from 3,000 percent annual inflation and
economic chaos, the governing populist Aprista Party is given
little chance of winning many mayoral races.
   Lima's mayoral race has always been considered a key barometer
of political sympathies, and this year a political independent,
television showman Ricardo Belmont, is strongly favored to win.
   Belmont, who owns a television station and is known for his
charitable telethons and for promoting sporting events, is
promising ``action, not words.'' Analysts say his message is an
appeal to voters' disenchantment with Peru's politicians and
political parties.
   His leading competitor in a field of nine candidates is the
Democratic Front's Juan Inchaustegui, a former Cabinet minister.
   Political leaders worry that the public's disenchantment with
politics makes voters more susceptible to the Shining Path's
campaign against the electoral process.
   ``We cannot expect anything good to come from the elections. On
the contrary, they are only a pretext to defend this rotten
democracy,'' said a Shining Path leaflet distributed in Ayacucho,
the highland city where the rebels launched their insurgency in May
1980.

<TEXT>
   L. Douglas Wilder's apparent election as
the nation's first black elected governor cast him as a national
figure, though he insists he does not wish for such a role.
   ``I have no intention personally to be involved in the national
scene,'' Wilder said at his first news conference after Tuesday's
election _ a session that drew reporters from around the world.
   Wilder followed one tradition of newly elected Virginia
governors when he made a speech to a luncheon of top business
executives in New York two days after the election. But there was
nothing traditional about the rest of his schedule, as the
Democratic lieutenant governor met with top congressional leaders
and appeared on nearly every national television news program.
   Wilder compiled a 6,582-vote lead over Republican J. Marshall
Coleman in unofficial returns of the nearly 1.8 million votes cast.
Coleman promised to seek a recount if the election's final results
as certified Nov. 27 by the State Board of Elections show him
losing by a half percent or less. A 6,582-vote margin would fall
below that half-percent cutoff.
   Still, political analysts are already talking about Wilder as a
potential vice presidential candidate, and say he can take as
prominent a role in national politics as he wants.
   ``Wilder is a national figure whether he wants to be one or
not,'' said Robert Holsworth, associate professor of political
science at Virginia Commonwealth University.
   Holsworth and other experts said Wilder would have to
concentrate on running the state well for a couple of years before
looking beyond Richmond.
   ``In the long run, however, I don't think that he will
necessarily refuse any advances from the national party,''
Holsworth said.
   If Wilder's ambitions exceed the governor's mansion, he still
could be hampered by his lack of experience outside the government
of a medium-sized state, he said.
   ``It's very possible that he'll choose a more modest role for
himself,'' said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution in Washington. ``On the other hand, obviously because
of his uniqueness he could have as large a role as he wishes.''
   It's easy for a Virginia governor to pursue a national role
because of the state's proximity to the media centers of New York
and Washington, Hess said.
   National Democrats are likely to tout Wilder because he is a
black moderate who contrasts with the more liberal Jesse Jackson,
analysts said.
   Wilder ``helps alleviate the problems Democrats have, especially
in the South, from being known as the black party because he is
very acceptable to so many white voters,'' said Hastings Wyman Jr.,
publisher of the Southern Political Report.
   ``Because he is acceptable to so many white voters, I think he
becomes an automatic name on the list for vice president for
Democrats,'' Wyman said. ``They can't put Jackson on the ticket.
They might be able to put Wilder on the ticket.''
   Wilder is probably in a strong enough position for party
officials to come to him and not look like he's hungry for more
than he has right now, said Mark Rozell, an assistant professor of
political science at Mary Washington College.
   But Wilder could face competition from other moderate black
politicians, such as Rep. William H. Gray III, a Democrat from
Pennsylvania who is House majority whip, and the mayors of several
major cities, observers said.
   ``There are a lot of prominent black politicians out there right
now,'' observed Michael Barone, editor of the Almanac of American
Politics.
   Any national ambitions Wilder might have could be sidetracked if
Sen. Charles S. Robb, a former Virginia governor, runs for
president.
   ``You're not going to have two Virginia Democrats on a ticket,''
Hess said.
   Even if Wilder remains mum about his ambitions, Hess said it
would be easy to tell what his intentions are by watching his
travel schedule: If it takes him out of Virginia often enough,
Wilder may have bigger things on his mind.

   Iran apologized Saturday for a a

reported.
   The agency said Foreign Ministry officials expressed ``regrets''
to Charge d'Affaires Hugo van der Goes van Naters, who had

   Officials in The Hague said the raiders burst into the embassy
in a downtown Tehran office, overpowered a night guard and smashed

   IRNA said the attack was made by ``an unidentified group.''
   Dutch officials said there was no known motive for the attack.

<HEAD>Officials Launch Probes Into Lastest Florida Keys Freighter Grounding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard refloated a 470-foot tanker off the
Florida Keys on Saturday as officials assessed the damage to the
area's fragile coral reef from the grounding, the third in less
than three weeks.
   The Greek ship Elpis, carrying a cargo of sugar and fuel oil,
became lodged in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary late
Friday, about five miles east of Key Largo and 50 miles south of
Miami.
   The accident happened about four miles south of where the
155-foot freighter Alec Owen Maitland ran aground Oct. 25, cutting
a 200-foot swath in the reef in the sanctuary.
   Five days later, the 475-foot cargo ship Mavro Vetranic became
lodged on a reef off the Dry Tortugas, a small island group about
60 miles west of Key West. The Yugoslav ship, carrying phosphate
and fuel, destroyed about 500 feet of reef.
   Both ships were refloated within days without leaking any fuel
or other cargo.
   The groundings occurred just weeks after Gov. Bob Martinez gave
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan a tour of the Keys and the world's
third-largest living coral reef, which stretches about 200 miles
from Miami to the Dry Tortugas.
   Officials were at a loss to explain the rash of accidents, the
first significant groundings in the area in five years.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Jim Wentworth said the waters through
the marine sanctuary off Key Largo are not difficult to navigate.
   ``You can see the change in color between the deep and shallow
water and it's well marked by buoys,'' he said. ``I don't know why
these groundings are happening, but they shouldn't be.''
   There were no reports of any leaks from the Elpis, which was
pulled off the reef as the tide rose Saturday afternoon, Wentworth
said. The ship was anchored in deeper water and likely would head
to Miami, he said.
   A special Coast Guard Board of Inquiry is expected to convene
Monday to investigate the incident and question crew members, said
Captain Herbert Robinson, commanding officer of the Coast Guard
Marine Safety Office in Miami. A similar panel is looking into the
Mavro Vetranic accident.
   The Elpis crew has not been tested for drug or alcohol use,
Wentworth said.
   Gov. Bob Martinez also amended an executive order to permit a
state criminal investigation of the first two groundings to be
expanded to cover the Elpis, said Brian Ballard, a spokesman for
the governor.
   In addition to the state investigations, a $9 million federal
civil lawsuit has been filed charging the Yugoslav freighter Mavro
Vetranic was unseaworthy and the crew incompetent.
   Officials still were assessing reef damage caused by the Elpis,
but some experts and environmentalists say the damage from the
three groundings may be irreparable.
   University of Miami oceanography professor Peter Glynn said
there has been very little coral regrowth in the 128,000 square
feet of reef destroyed by the freighter Wellwood in 1984, the worst
grounding of the decade in the Keys.
   ``It looked like four or five tractors just put their blades
down and plowed the reef bare,'' he said. ``It's a sad sight.''
   DeeVon Quirolo, spokesman for the Key West-based Reef Relief
conservation group, said the nutrient-rich South Florida water
promotes growth of sea grass and algae in damaged reef areas, which
inhibit the growth of coral.
   ``The reefs never really come back,'' she said.
   Ms. Quirolo urged that international shipping lanes be moved
further from the reef and crews of foreign-registered ships be
checked more thoroughly.
   ``Three groundings in a row is devastating,'' she said. ``We are
worried when a diver brushes a fin against the reef. Think about
what happens when a freighter rams it.''

<HEAD>China Lashes Out At Voice Of America</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China on Sunday accused the Voice of America
radio network of trying to ``stir up chaos'' in its report on a
Communist Party meeting considering an economic austerity plan.
   VOA reported on the policy-making Central Committee meeting ``in
a purely fictitious way,'' the government news agency Xinhua said.
   It said VOA reported that provincial party officials fiercely
debated with central party leaders over financial matters, and that
economic measures adopted at the plenum aimed to return China's
economy to government control.
   ``There was no fierce debate whatsoever. ... This was a sheer
fabrication by VOA,'' Xinhua quoted an unidentified ``authoritative
source'' as saying.
   The source ``accused the U.S. government-run radio station of
attempting to stir up chaos for despicable means,'' Xinhua said.
   A text of the Chinese-language VOA broadcast was not immediately
available.
   China has repeatedly lashed out against VOA for ``spreading
rumors'' during the April-to-June protests for democratic reforms,
which ended in a military crackdown that left at least hundreds
dead.
   Criticizing VOA is one of the Chinese government's ways of
expressing displeasure with the U.S. government, which Beijing
accuses of involvement in the popular uprising.
   Two VOA correspondents were expelled by China following the
early June crackdown. One accredited reporter remains in Beijing.
   The four-day party meeting ended with a communique calling for
austere living over the next two years to combat inflation,
excessive growth and corruption.
   It also outlined four general goals, including cutting
consumption, tightening control over finances, realigning the
industrial structure and boosting production.
   ``China's move to improve the economic environment and rectify
the economic order is aimed at deepening the ongoing reforms and
promoting a sustained, steady and coordinated development of
China's national economy,'' Xinhua said.
   ``But the VOA, in its Chinese-language service, distorted the
contents of the communique,'' Xinhua quoted the official as saying.
``This will surely arouse the indignation of the Chinese people.''

<HEAD>Low License Plate Numbers Bring Big Bucks in Delaware</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who paid $19,500 for a 1978 Chrysler
New Yorker valued at $5,000 didn't care about the car _ he forked
over an extra $14,000 for the honor of having Delaware license
plate number 313.
   In Delaware, license plates can be privately sold, creating a
market where drivers are willing to pay premium prices for the
lowest possible number to cover their car's rear.
   Four digit numbers, which used to sell for about $900, have shot
up in recent years to more than $2,000. Three-digit plates sell for
as much as $25,000 and the cream of the crop _ numbers below 100 _
are so rare it is hard to determine a value.
   Jay Hurley, who has been buying and selling low-numbered license
plates from his used-car dealership in New Castle County for more
than 20 years, estimates a two-digit number would be worth from
$35,000 to $50,000.
   ``One number? At least $100,000. Unbelievable, right? Nobody,
unless they're people who are familiar with tags, believe they
bring that kind of money,'' Hurley said.
   Hurley said prices for low numbers have tripled in the past year
and Ray Savage, who bought the Chrysler New Yorker, said he already
has received higher offers for the tag he recently bought.
   ``I could sell it at a substantial profit, but I'm not
interested,'' Savage said.
   The lowest privately-held number is No. 4, owned by Margaret
``Peggy'' McConnell of Wilmington, wife of the late J.H. Tyler
McConnell, who issued himself the plate in the 1940s, when he
headed the state highway department, which oversees the Division of
Motor Vehicles.
   ``I would never give it up. It's the one thing I know Tyler
never wanted me to sell. He had the idea that four was a very lucky
number for him,'' she said.
   The No. 1 tag always goes to the current governor, No. 2 to the
current lieutenant governor and No. 3 to the current secretary of
state.
   Delaware citizens can sell license plates privately because the
motor vehicle division does not re-issue plates. License plates can
be transferred from one vehicle to another, provided the owner
holds title to both vehicles.
   ``In Delaware, the number goes with the car, and it stays with
the vehicle indefinitely. We're still honoring plates issued in the
1940s,'' said Robert Voshell, head of the state Division of Motor
Vehicles.
   It is now impossible to get any number below five digits,
Voshell said.

<HEAD>Bhutto Sacks Troubled Cabinet Minister, Appoints Former Opponent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Saturday fired a Cabinet minister implicated in a murder case and
replaced him with a former opponent of her government.
   Her office made no comment on the change, but an aide said it
was part of a Cabinet restructuring expected since Ms. Bhutto
narrowly survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote Nov. 1.
   After the vote, Ms. Bhutto announced plans to reach out to
moderate opposition politicans for support and to rid her
11-month-old government of controversial ministers and advisers.
   Ghulam Mohammad Maneka replaced Makhtar Awan as Minister of
Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis, according to an official
announcement. Also sworn in were Maneka's deputy, Makhdoom Alam
Anwar, and Ghulam Akbar Lasi as deputy minister of labor.
   Awan, who is sought on charges of conspiracy in connection with
the slaying of two right-wing students in Punjab province.
   He says he is innocent and claims the arrest warrant was
politically motivated. The Punjab provincial government is run by
the Islamic Democratic Alliance, the staunchest opponents of Ms.
Bhutto's governing Pakistan People's Party.
   Maneka and Anwar were also members of the alliance but switched
sides in the days leading up to the no-confidence move in which the
center-right opposition had 107 votes, only 12 short of a majority
in the 237-seat National Assembly.
   In another political development, a small but influential
right-wing party that belongs to the alliance declared Saturday at
the end of four days of meetings that it was fed up with Pakistan's
11-month-old democracy.
   ``We have had enough of democracy,'' said Tufail Mohammad,
former leader of Jamaat-i-Islami, considered to be one of
Pakistan's best organized political parties.
   ``The country needs God-fearing people, righteousness and not
democracy,'' Mohammad told about 60,000 people who converged on
Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's eastern Punjab province.
   Jamaat's leadership has often warned that Pakistan risks the
wrath of God by allowing a female to lead a Moslem country. Ms.
Bhutto was sworn in last December after her party won the largest
bloc of votes in the first free polls in more than a decade.
   Her predecessor, Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, died in August 1988,
when his plane crashed, killing all 39 on board. It brought to an
end 11 years of military rule in Pakistan.

   The self-described devil worshipper was sentenced to death
Tuesday for committing 13 murders and 30 other felonies in a string

The sentence carries an automatic appeal.
   Ramirez is being held in Los Angeles County jail and is expected

   One of seven officers accused of plotting to
kill Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings, leader of this West African
country, has hanged himself in jail, newspapers reported Saturday.
   Newspapers quoted a report on an investigation of the plot that
said Flt. Lt. William Kofi Domie was found hanging from a noose
made from his own clothing.
   The summary of evidence alleged that Maj. Courage E.K.
Quarshigah, a former close associate of Rawlings, was the main
plotter and recruited at least six other officers. The men were
detained last month on charges of subversion.
   ``There is evidence to the effect that Maj. Quarshigah intended
the plot to be executed without any trace of his involvement,'' the
summary said.
   It said Quarshigah hoped to become head of state during the
confusion following the assassination. Quarshigah denied the
charges, the summary said.
   Quarshigah's oracle told him he would become head of state, and
the other plotters were given money to consult their own oracles,
the statement said.
   Alleged plotter Simon Sablah, who had been dismissed from the
military on disciplinary grounds, confirmed Quarshigah's role in
the plot, the newspapers reported.
   In 1983, Quarshigah blocked an attempt to overthrow Rawlings,
who had seized power in a coup four years earlier.

   Industrialist Armand Hammer said he had a
heart pacemaker implanted on the advice of his physician, and a
hospital statement said he was in good health and should return to
work shortly.
   Hammer, the 91-year-old philanthropist and chairman of
Occidental Petroleum Corp., received the implant Friday at the UCLA
Medical Center.
   He was listed in good condition late Friday. A nursing
supervisor declined to give any information about Hammer on
Saturday, and his spokesman did not return a phone call immediately.
   Hours after the surgery, Hammer was alert and talking on the
telephone from his hospital bed.
   ``Recently I had fallen and had some rib trouble,'' Hammer said.
``The doctor recommended I have a pacemaker put in. He said I would
function better and that the pacemaker would protect me from future

   Hammer, who has had heart trouble for more than 20 years, is
expected by his doctors to be released from the hospital in a few

   Hammer, the chairman of Occidental, is nearly as well-known for
his art collecting and philanthropy as for his business acumen. He
considers himself a private ambassador for world peace and has met
every Soviet leader since Vladimir Lenin.
   He was pardoned earlier this year by President Bush for making
illegal contributions to President Nixon's re-election campaign in
1972. Hammer had pleaded guilty to the charges in 1976, was
sentenced to one year's probation and fined $3,000.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said on
television Saturday that the country is short of coal and he
appealed to miners to work on weekends to assure supplies for the
winter.
   His address came on a national holiday celebrating the 1918
creation of a capitalist republic in Poland after 123 years of
division among Russians, Germans and Austrians.
   Looking worn, Mazowiecki said changes in the country must go
faster and that the new non-communist government _ the first in the
Soviet bloc _ will ``try not to waste time.''
   Also Saturday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl returned to
resume his visit, which was broken off for 27 hours so he could
attend an emergency Cabinet meeting in Bonn on the dramatic opening
of East Germany's border to the West.
   Kohl was scheduled on Sunday to travel to a village on former
German lands to attend Mass with Mazowiecki in a gesture of
reconciliaton with Poland.
   In Canada, Solidarity trade union leader Lech Walesa on Saturday
continued a 10-day North American visit intended to encourage
foreign investment in Poland. He flies to Washington on Monday and
will visit Philadelphia, Chicago and New York this week.
   Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity newspaper editor, who was
elected Aug. 24 to lead the first government led by non-communists
in the East bloc, reminded his television audience that Saturday
also marked the two-month anniversary of the new government.
   The prime minister and communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski
laid flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the morning.
   Mazowiecki told viewers in the address that although Poland was
now living in freedom for the first time in over 40 years, much
work had to be done for Poland to transform the economy.
   He said the country was 13 million tons short of coal, and
appealed to coal miners to work Saturdays for the rest of the year
to assure supplies for the winter.
   He also appealed to the Solidarity to support his request.

<HEAD>EPA Inspects Rayon Plant Shut Down Amid Pollution Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRONT ROYAL, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avtex Fibers Inc. agreed Saturday to
remove a highly flammable chemical from its closed rayon plant
while federal inspectors checked for other hazardous materials.
   Avtex officials met with federal, state and local environmental
and hazardous waste specialists at the plant, which shut down
abruptly Friday after the state revoked its waste water discharge
permit. The State Water Control Board found Thursday that Avtex had
violated the permit by dumping toxic polychlorinated biphenyls, or
PCBs, into the Shenandoah River.
   The plant, hampered for years by costly pollution and worker
safety problems, last year was promised a $22.6 million federal
bailout because it is the only supplier of carbonized rayon yarn
used in the space shuttle and nuclear missiles.
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state officials who
arrived late Friday were most concerned about containers of carbon
disulfide left in the plant, said Harold Yates, an EPA spokesman.
Yates said he believed the highly flammable chemical was in liquid
form stored in containers at the bottom of water tanks.
   ``The company agreed to arrange for the removal of the carbon
disulfide within the next few days,'' he said. ``That basically
will be determined by the availability of a contractor that can
come in here and safely transfer that material to railroad tank
cars.''
   Yates said EPA personnel were guarding the chemical until its
removal, which will be paid for by the company.
   ``This was one of the chemicals that was generated or used in
the manufacturing process there,'' he said. It presented a hazard
once the plant shut down because employees were no longer there to
keep an eye on it, he said.
   About a half dozen EPA officials and several contractors were on
the site checking for other hazardous materials, Yates said. He
said he believed the company would continue cleaning up the PCBs
with EPA oversight.
   David A. Tousignant, president of the Front Royal plant, said
Thursday the company would be unable to clean up the site if it
shut down and lost its revenues. His home phone number is unlisted
and he could not be reached for comment Saturday.
   The approximately 400 workers received no notice, although
federal law requires 60 days of notice when large plants shut down
for foreseeable reasons, said James Brinklow, business agent for
the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union local at Avtex.
   ``We're out of a job now,'' Brinklow said, maintaining the state
should pay the workers for 60 days because it forced the closure.
State officials sued to close the plant, saying PCBs have
contaminated it since a December 1985 leak of some 500 gallons of
the toxins from a transformer.
   Richard N. Burton, executive director of the state water board,
called the plant's sudden closing an example of ``a continuing
contempt for the public ... as well as Virginia's environment.''
   Workers and residents said the state's action left the company
no choice.
   ``There's a lot of talk whether this is more politics than
substance,'' said Michael W. Kitts, Front Royal's vice mayor.
   Kitts said he supports the state's efforts to stop the pollution
but it was unfair to force the company to shut down when it had
started cleaning up the PCBs earlier this year.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 carpenters, electricians
and sheet metal workers brought their tools Saturday to the
quake-ravaged Pacific Garden Mall to get the commercial hub back on
its feet again.
   The volunteer construction corps from throughout Northern
California began pitching tents to house the downtown businesses
displaced by the Oct. 17 earthquake. Some wore T-shirts that read,
``Operations Phoenix Pavilion _ Two Days,'' signaling their hope to
have the tents up before the weekend is over.
   ``We've got members here who have lost their own homes. But
we're trying to move as quickly as possible, to get these people
out of shock and working again,'' said Eric Taylor, spokesman for
the Central California District Council of Carpenters, which
sponsored the project. ``Everyone's saying, `Let's get going, let's
get to work.'''
   Workers marked the parking lots where the seven tents were to go
up. Two donated cherry-pickers lifted aluminum frames and lumber
off tractor-trailers. A block away, a crane's jaws ate at the
rubble of a quake-ravaged building in the fenced-off mall area.
   Some 43 merchants signed up for lease space in the tent
pavilions and hope to be back in business the day after
Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season
and a merchants' bonanza.
   The structures, 24 feet tall, 50 feet wide and 100 feet long,
will remain up for at least a year while demolition and
reconstruction continues in the adjacent mall.
   The open-air mall housed about 250 restaurants, bookshops and
retail businesses before the quake. Annual sales totaled about $100
million and generated $1 million in sales tax revenue for the city.
   Three people were killed when the 7.1 magnitude quake ravaged
the mall, and dozens of merchants were displaced.
   Volunteers on Saturday worked behind the former site of the
Santa Cruz Coffee Roasting Co., where two people were killed when
the building collapsed. The lot now is an empty hole littered with
rubble.
   The City Council cleared red tape to grant permits for
construction and sewer and water hookups for a restaurant pavilion.
It also donated $20,000 toward the $314,000 rental cost of the
acrylic and fabric structures.
   ``I didn't realize we were as well-organized as we were,'' said
Louie Rittenhouse, president of the Downtown Association.
   Rittenhouse said officials were especially motivated by the need
to keep retailers in business while work was done on salvageable
mall buildings and new ones were built, a process that could take
up to five years.
   ``We have accomplished in three weeks what usually takes about
six months,'' said John Hicks, owner of the Garage Grill and
coordinator of the restaurant pavilion. ``We've put together a huge
retail cooperative in that time.''

   Amnesty International based its
criticism of Malawi's human rights record on false accounts of
torture in prison, the government said Saturday.
   An official statement issued in Blantyre said an Amnesty
International report released Tuesday in Britain was based on
information from ``disgruntled and misguided'' Malawians.
   The human rights organization, based in London, alleged that
torture and other mistreatment of prisoners was sanctioned by
President H. Kamuzu Banda.
   The Amnesty report claimed the number of political detentions in
this landlocked southern African nation increased during 1989.
   ``No prisoner is tortured and to insinuate that torture in
prison is sanctioned by the life president is ridiculous and
absurd,'' the government said. ``Such a statement can only be made
by a madman or one who specializes in gathering rumours.''
   Banda led the former British colony of Nyasaland to independence
as Malawi in 1964 and now is President for Life.

   The Navy commissioned a new $3.4 billion
nuclear aircraft carrier Saturday and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said the country must keep its military strong despite the
liberalization sweeping Eastern Europe.
   ``We look forward to a Europe that is whole and free,'' Cheney
said at commissioning ceremonies at Norfolk Naval Station.
   ``NATO is a rock in that sea of change. This is not the time to
reduce any of our commitments,'' he said.
   Speaking of the rapid change in East Germany _ where the
government opened its borders with the West this week _ and reforms
in many other Warsaw Pact nations, Cheney said those reforms were
brought about by the United States' military strength.
   ``We are seeing the fruits of our patience. But we know from
history that the Kremlin is capable of rapid shifts of intention,''
Cheney said. ``It took five years to build this carrier. Intentions
can change overnight.''
   The 100,000-ton, 1,092-foot USS Abraham Lincoln officially
joined the fleet shortly before noon when Capt. William B. Hayden,
the carrier's commander, received the commissioning order from Vice
Adm. J.K. Ready, commander of the Atlantic Fleet Naval Air Force.
   As formations of Navy jets flew over 17,000 people on the pier,
some sailors tossed their hats down to the crowd.
   The Lincoln, the Navy's heaviest warship, will have a crew of
6,000, including naval aviators and support personnel. The
24-story-tall warship joins four other Nimitz-class carriers, all
built across the harbor from the naval station at Newport News
Shipbuilding.
   The ship will carry about 90 aircraft, including F-14A Tomcat
fighters, F@A-18 Hornets, A-6E Intruders, early warning
surveillance craft and helicopters.
   The Lincoln is the Navy's 15th carrier. It will be based at a
West Coast port within the next year. The Navy has yet to announce
a location.

   Gunmen killed a reputed underworld boss and

   Police said at least six men opened fire in the bar, killing
four people immediately. A fifth person died in a hospital, and one
of two people wounded in the gunfire was listed in critical
condition.
   Investigators said the shooting was part of a gang war between
two rival clans of the Neapolitan underworld, which is known as the
Camorra, which are fighting over control of the drug market.
   Police identified one of the dead as Antonio Borrelli, whom they
described as one of the bosses of one of the clans.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Saturday added
another condition to a Palestinian delegation for proposed peace
talks, saying its members must be educated and experienced enough
to discuss plans for elections.
   The new demand, two days before Shamir begins his trip to the
United States, is the latest on a list of assurances Israel has
sought regarding the planned talks. Israel also wants assurances
the Palestinian Liberation Organization will be excluded from the
negotiations.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Saturday, Israeli
soldiers shot and wounded 10 Palestinian protesters, Arab reports
said. Masked Arabs stabbed and hacked to death a suspected
pro-Israeli collaborator.
   Shamir told Israel radio he will try to achieve a ``maximum
benefit'' from a meeting with President Bush in Washington on
Wednesday. Shamir is also due to meet with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III during his 11-day trip that begins Monday night.
   Last week, Israel gave qualified approval to Baker's plan of
arranging an Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo.
   Shamir told the radio that Palestinian delegates ``should be ..
. people with a technical education, with a certain experience in
elections. With them, we shall only determine the ways of
elections.''
   Israel also wants assurances from the United States that the
meeting will be devoted to election procedures only and is
insisting that only Palestinians from the occupied lands be
permitted to participate.
   A peace initiative, adopted by the government in May, calls for
elections to choose Palestinian delegates for negotiations with
Israel on an interim period of self-rule in the occupied lands.
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, about 2,000 school students
marched in the streets, clashing with Israeli troops who responded
with tear gas and rubber bullets, witnesses said. An Arab reporter
from Hebron said at least 23 students were detained.
   In Qalqilya, about 500 protesters unfurled outlawed Palestinian
flags and marched with flowers in their hands to the house of a
youth killed in a clash with soldiers last week. Arab reporters
said troops wounded one protester, arrested 10 and imposed a curfew
on the town.
   Nine protesters were wounded in clashes elsewhere in the
occupied lands, Arab reports said. The army confirmed three wounded.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, masked Arabs armed with daggers
and axes killed Samir Mohammed Asana, 37, in front of his shoe
shop, Arab journalists and Israel radio said.
   His death brought to 144 the number of Palestinians killed by
their brethren on suspicion of assisting the Israeli authorities.
At least 613 Palestinians have died of Israeli gunfire in the
23-month-old uprising, and 40 Israelis have been killed.
   Shamir leaves for New York on Monday night. In addition to his
visit to Washington, he is scheduled to address Jewish groups in
Cincinnati and Los Angeles before returning to Israel on Nov. 24.

   The foreign ministers of France, Spain and

   The three ministers are scheduled to meet President Hosni
Mubarak Sunday and then fly back to Europe, where they will meet

   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas told reporters at Cairo
International airport that the aim of the ministers tour was to
gather information so that they could help advance the peace
process in the area.
   ``We are working seriously,'' Dumas said, but declined to give
any details on his talks with Arafat. Arafat briefed them on the
Palestinian Liberation Organization's position regarding Secretary
of State James A. Baker III proposal to start a Palestinian-Israeli
dialogue.
   Shortly before the meeting in Tunisia, PLO spokesman Ibrahim
Souss told reporters that his group continues to demand that it
alone choose the Palestinian delegation to a Palestinian-Israeli
dialogue and that it alone should represent the Palestinians in any
peace negotiations.
   Israel refuses to deal with the PLO, which it calls a terrorist
organization.

   Moslems attacked Hindu shrines and
burned shops in Bangladesh Saturday to protest the construction of
a Hindu temple at a site in India also claimed sacred by Moslems.
   In eastern India, mobs attacked four villages the day before,
burning more than 100 huts and killing five people, in a wave of
violence that began when militant Hindus organized processions
celebrating the building of the temple.
   In Moslem-dominated Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Saturday joined in denouncing the temple at the northern Indian
town of Ayodha.
   ``This step is a willful desecration of an Islamic holy place
and arouses the deepest resentment among Moslems all over the
world,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   She said it was Pakistan's policy not to interfere in other
countries' internal affairs but added the temple was a matter ``of
deepest concern for Moslems both inside and outside India.''
   Hindus, who make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people,
claim the site is the birthplace of the Lord Ram, an incarnation of
Vishnu, one of the supreme trinity of Hindu gods.
   Moslems, who form 11 percent of India's population, are outraged
that the temple is being built near the mosque of the 16th century
Mogul emperor Babar.
   Reporters in Bangladesh said Moslems set fire to more than 25
Hindu-owned shops and smashed idols at three temples in the town of
Narsinghdi, 25 miles northeast of Dhaka. No injuries were reported.
   Indian security troops were reinforced Thursday when the first
foundation stones were laid for the temple in Ayodha, 325 miles
southeast of New Delhi.
   Sectarian violence between followers of the two faiths has
claimed at least 300 lives in three states in northern India since
militant Hindus announced plans to build the temple in August.
   The violence in India Friday occurred in four villages near
Bhagalpur, in the state of Bihar, about 635 miles southeast of New
Delhi.
   Press Trust of India did not identify the attackers or the
victims. Indian news media rarely do so, but journalists who
visited the area said most of those killed in the past have been
Moslems.
   About 87 percent of Bangladesh's 110 million people are Moslem.
Hindus form 12 percent of the population.

   A man who rammed his car into the front door
of a Roman Catholic church and claimed to hold a hostage in the
choir loft Saturday surrendered after talking with police for more
than three hours.
   Police led Timothy Hunt, 34, from All Saints Church around 11:30
a.m. after he surrendered peacefully. Authorities say Hunt, who was
wanted for attempted murder in an assault on his brother, drove his
car into the church's plate-glass entrance at 7:45 a.m., about a
half-hour before a scheduled Mass.
   Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis said Hunt was armed with two
handguns, but never had a hostage.
   Police negotiators in the church sanctuary communicated with
Hunt by shouting to him in the choir loft, where he remained low
and out of sight, authorities said. No shots were fired during the
standoff.
   Leis said Hunt is wanted in the assault earlier in the week on
his brother in Reading. Family members were called to the church to
help in negotiations. Hunt was taken to Hamilton County Criminal
Justice Center and held on charges of aggravated menacing,
vandalism and enducing a panic, sheriff's officer Michael Swartwout
said.
   Hunt also may be ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation, Leis
said. Hunt had been receiving counseling at the church, he said.
   Reading Police Chief Robert Huelsman said Hunt was accused of
shooting at his brother Wednesday evening. The brother was not
injured.
   ``He wanted a public apology for some things that had happened
to him in his family,'' Sharonville Police Chief Greg Lewton, who
supervised the negotiations, said of Hunt. ``He had some domestic
problems ... and I think it hurt him mentally.''

<HEAD>Revised Marriage Prospect Study Avoids Controversial Subject</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The researchers who once reported that
marriage prospects for college-educated women over 30 were dim have
published a final draft of their study that steers clear of the
constroversy of the first work.
   The three researchers said the 1986 figures were misinterpreted
and misused, and that they did not want attention again diverted
from the real focus of their study _ the divergence of marriage
rates among blacks and whites.
   ``It was discouraging for us as academic researchers to see the
way in which the media used our figures essentially to assault
women,'' Neil G. Bennett, an associate professor of sociology at
Yale University, said Saturday.
   ``Women were in effect told by the headlines that they can't
have it all, they shouldn't have it all and that they should go
back home, leave their careers, raise babies and clean house.
   ``That was by no means our message,'' Bennett said.
   In the earlier draft of their study, the reseachers reported
that college-educated white women had a 20 percent likelihood of
marriage at the age of 30, a 5 percent chance at 35 and a 1 percent
chance at 40.
   The figures were questioned by some sociologists and
demographers, but not before a host of news stories cast the
findings in ominous terms. A Newsweek cover story declared that a
40-year-old woman had a better chance of being killed by a
terrorist than of getting married.
   The final study, to be published in this month's issue of The
American Journal of Sociology, does project that 11.5 percent of
white women with more than a high school education who were born in
the early 1950s will never marry.
   But Bennett said the finding cannot be compared to any of the
figures in the earlier draft because the two analyses dealt with
women of differing ages and educational background, and because
different sets of data were used.
   The earlier study looked at 1982 Census data from 70,000
households, while the final draft is based on data from the 1985
survey. The stastistical model was also changed slightly, Bennett
said.
   Bennett, Columbia University economist David E. Bloom, and Yale
doctoral candidate Patricia Craig decided that to include a
reassessment of the old figures would result in the real message of
their study being lost, Bennett said.
   ``It is very obvious from the reaction several years ago large
numbers of people are interested in these kinds of figures. But at
this point we feel we have some very important issues to discuss
... and they are the underlying factors giving rise to the
declining marriage rates of black women,'' he said.
   In their final study, the authors seek to document the reasons
why black and white marriage rates, which have long differed, have
diverged dramatically and rapidly with time, Bennett said.
   For black women born in the late 1930s, the researchers said
they would expect 11.5 percent to never marry. But for black women
born in the early 1950s, they said they would expect 25 percent to
never marry.
   About 5 percent of white women born in the late 1930s will never
marry, while the figure rises to only 9 perent for white women born
in the early 1950s, according to the study.

   Art Fletcher, President Bush's choice to
head the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, was in satisfactory

   A nursing supervisor at St. Elizabeth Medical Center said
Fletcher, 64, remained in the intensive care unit. The operation

while in town for a conference.
   Family spokeswoman Kathy Keolker Wheeler said Fletcher was still

accepted by Bush last month.
   A diabetic, Fletcher also had a heart attack in 1983. One of his
surgeons, Dr. William Gaskill said Fletcher's heart problems were
typical of diabetics, with considerable blockages in his blood
vessels.

   Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa comes to
the United States holding his head high and his hand out, accepting
praise for forging the first non-Communist government in the Soviet
bloc while seeking money for its survival.
   ``We are building an America of the East,'' but that requires
billions of dollars from the West, Walesa said in an interview
before leaving Poland for his U.S. visit scheduled to begin Monday.
   Walesa's trip will provide a chance for President Bush and
Congress to endorse in words and dollars the changes that are
sweeping the Soviet bloc, and most recently have engulfed East
Germany.
   The stocky, mustachioed electrician, who rocketed to world fame
in August 1980 by clambering over the Gdansk shipyard wall and
leading the strike that created Solidarity, can expect warm words
and warmer hospitality, from the White House ceremony where he
receives the presidential medal of freedom on Monday, to his speech
to members of the House and Senate on Wednesday.
   Nor is he likely to return to Gdansk empty-handed, as Congress
and the Bush administration hammer out a deal providing $555
million to $989 million over three years to bolster the sweeping
reforms enacted in Poland and Hungary.
   During a stop Saturday at Niagra Falls as part of a four-day
trip to Canada, Walesa was mobbed by about 100 people.
   The charismatic leader said outside a meeting with Niagara Falls
Mayor Bill Smeaton that he doesn't want to run for political office
in Poland. In one of his few public utterances, Walesa said in
Polish, ``I prefer to be a small boss.''
   At a Remembrance Day ceremony in Toronto, Walesa helped a Polish
war veteran lay a wreath. The ceremony drew about 2,000 people,
many of whom clutched red and white Solidarity flags.
   Walesa is to meet Monday with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
Following that session, Walesa will fly to Washington, where during
a four-day period he will meet with Bush twice, address an AFL-CIO
convention and become the first private foreign citizen in 175 year
to address a joint meeting of Congress.
   The last foreigner without a government job to address Congress
was the Marquis de Lafayette, who fought as a general in the
American Revolution, and spoke to a joint meeting in 1824, said Ray
Smock, the House historian.
   Walesa also will travel to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and
Caracas, Venezuela, before flying home.
   All the official hoopla may seem to be old hat for a man who won
the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1983, but Walesa said on the eve of
his visit he was worried about not having time to see all the
Americans who want to meet him.
   ``I cannot thank Americans enough, because it is physically
impossible,'' Walesa told The Associated Press in an interview last
week in Gdansk. ``Any trip to the states shorter than one month is
no good.''
   Uppermost in Walesa's mind was the survival of the Soldarity
government, headed by his former adviser, Tadeusz Mazowecki.
   To bolster that government, Walesa said, ``we need Columbuses
from the states ... to discover Poland, to clear the trail.''
   ``Then there will be an influx of millionaires, because there is
business to be done there,'' said Walesa, describing a Poland in
need of rebuilding from top to bottom.
   U.S. aid is forthcoming, but it may not be as much as Walesa
would like. House and Senate negotiators a week ago completed work
on a compromise to send $533 million in fiscal 1990 to Poland and
Hungary, including a $200 million U.S. contribution to a $1 billion
international aid fund to help stabilize the Polish currency, as
well as money for a $45 million program to promote private
enterprise in Poland.
   Additionally, a team from the International Monetary Fund was in
Poland last week reviewing the reform program proposed by
Solidarity. High marks from IMF could open the way for new credits,
as well as a rescheduling of Poland's $40 billion foreign debt.
   Bush has nothing new for Walesa, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III told reporters last Wednesday, but will reiterate the
support he expressed during a visit to Poland last July.
   Bush has proposed a $450 million aid package to Poland, low
enough to draw accusations of ``timidity'' from Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The amount proposed by Bush may not be enough, Baker
acknowledged. If not, ``you have to take another look at it at that
time. But the debate is not about policy approach, it's only about
the amount of money,'' he said.
   Bush responded to critics at a news conference last Tuesday,
saying ``I'd like to hear some specific suggestions other than
triple the spending on every initiative ... I don't hear complaints
coming out of our allies or indeed out of Hungary or Poland or
Eastern Europe.''
   He is not likely to hear public complaints from Walesa, either,
predicted Janusz Bugajski, an analyst at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington.
   ``Poles understand that America is not going to write them a
blank check,'' said Bugajski. ``But they want the psychological
boost of having an American president say he suports them.''

<HEAD>Former Pulliam Executive Bill Worcester Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willard C. ``Bill'' Worcester, a retired
executive with the Pulliam newspapers and one of the organizers of
Phoenix Newspapers Inc., died Saturday at his home. He was 86.
   In 1946, Worcester was named general manager and a director of
Indianapolis-based Central Newspapers Inc., the parent Pulliam
corporation, and executive vice president and publisher of the
chain's papers in Muncie, Ind.
   In October of that year, Worcester participated in Central's
purchase of The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette from the
Arizona Publishing Co. Central set up a subsidiary, Phoenix
Newspapers, to publish the newspapers and Worcester became first
vice president and a director of the corporation.
   He served as acting publisher of the Republic and the Gazette in
1952 and 1953.
   As general manager of Central Newspapers, Worcester also was
involved in publication of The Indianapolis Star, The Indianapolis
News and Vincennes Sun-Commercial in Vincennes, Ind.
   In 1947, he became general manager of Indianapolis Broadcasting
Inc., the corporation operating Pulliam-owned radio stations WIRE
in Indianapolis and WAOV in Vincennes.
   From August 1959 to December 1963, Worcester served a stint as
general manager of Phoenix Newspapers before again becoming
publisher of the Muncie newspapers.
   Following retirement from the Muncie papers in 1972, he moved to
Scottsdale, Ariz. In 1973, he joined the Mardian Construction Co.
of Phoenix as director of planning and development and later became
Mardian's director of marketing.
   In 1977, Worcester was named executive-in-residence in the
Arizona State University College of Business Administration.
   Worcester was born Oct. 7, 1903, in Brookline, Mass. He
graduated from Norwich University in Northfield, Vt., in 1925, and
then attended New York University Law School for two years.
   After leaving school, he worked in circulation at newspapers in
Rochester, N.Y., Louisville, Ky. and Philadelphia before moving
into advertising and becoming assistant director of advertising for
the Gannett newspapers in Rochester. He later became advertising
manager of the now-defunct Cleveland News.
   He is survived by his wife, Idona; his daughter, Nancy W. Chase;
one son, Willard M.; and six grandchildren.

<DATELINE>NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa put aside his appeals
for foreign investment in Poland on Saturday to visit Niagara
Falls, where for a time the Solidarity leader became another
tourist attraction.
   In a steady rain and gusting winds, Walesa was surrounded by
about 100 people trying to get a glimpse of the Nobel Peace Prize
laureate as he arrived.
   ``He's my hero,'' said Mario Guatieri, a 50-year-old steelworker
from this Ontario city. ``I admire him for his courage.''
   Walesa, 46, on the second day of a four-day Canadian trip, is
trying to encourage investment to support the democratic and
capitalist reforms the Solidarity-led government introduced since
replacing the communist regime in September. He flies to Washington
Monday.
   After a meeting with Niagara Falls Mayor Bill Smeaton, Walesa
said he doesn't want to run for political office in Poland despite
calls for the trade union leader to do so.
   ``I prefer to be a small boss,'' he said in Polish, one of the
few times he spoke publicly.
   Walesa met a group of business executives Saturday at a private
luncheon in Toronto before he flew by helicopter to Niagara Falls.
He later said time will tell whether his trip to Canada and the
United States is successful at attracting investment to Poland.
   ``Businessmen are very careful,'' he told reporters through a
translator. ``They received us well, but we will have to wait for
them.''
   Poland's economy is burdened by a $40 billion foreign debt,
inflation approaching 300 percent a year and low productivity in
its factories.
   Flanked by security guards, Walesa waded through the crowd to
get a quick look at the Falls.
   Some sightseers managed to get close enough to shake Walesa's
hand, while others gave him mementoes, including postcards and a
gray cap bearing the Niagara Parks Commission's green logo of a
tree.
   On Sunday, Walesa takes part in a labor rally at Hamilton's
Copps Coliseum and attends a function sponsored by the Canadian
Polish Congress at Toronto's Massey Hall commemorating Polish
Independence Day.
   He meets Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in Ottawa Monday before
flying to Washington. He is also scheduled to visit Philadelphia,
Chicago and New York this week.

   Romanian dissident Dona Cornea has begun a hunger
strike in Bucharest in support of another political activist who
was arrested by police in the Romanian capital last month, a group
of Romanian exiles said Saturday.
   In a statement, the Committee in Support of the Opposition said
Ms. Cornea's ``telephone line remains cut, her mail systematically
diverted and anyone wanting to contact her is ... stopped and
terrorized.
   ``Dona Cornea is ... resolved to begin this hunger strike and
any other ... non-violent means of demonstrating her opposition to
the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu,'' the statement said.
   Ms. Cornea was trying to call attention to the plight of Dan
Petrescu, arrested after he began a hunger strike and signed a
petition with other Romanian dissidents against the re-election of
President Ceausescu as head of the nation's Communist Party at the
party congress Nov. 20-25.
   Ceausescu has turned his back on reforms announced in the Soviet
Union and other East bloc nations, pledging to maintain hard-line
Marxist rule.

   A 1961 Ferrari was sold for $2.6
million at an exclusive Ferrari auction Saturday night.
   Bidding for the red Berlinetta Competizione 250 GT began at
$800,000, and the car was sold by telephone to a buyer whose
identity was not disclosed.
   The car has 12 cylinders with a 168B motor type. There were only
28 made.
   A total of 34 Ferraris were auctioned, which was attended by
about 3,000 car lovers. Another 250 GT competition car, a 1958
``Tour de France'' model, went for more than $1.78 million to a
Japanese buyer while a ``Supersqualo'' one of just four made, went
for $1.6 million.
   Prices of Ferraris have risen since the death last year of Enzo
Ferrari, founder of the Italian auto company that bears his name.
On Aug. 19, five days after Ferrari's death, a 12-cylinder 1963
Ferrari 250 P, one of only five of its kind ever built, was sold in
Monterey, Calif., for $2.72 million.

<HEAD>Socialists Appear To Lose Majority Two Weeks After General Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MURCIA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Socialist Party on Saturday
appeared to have lost its one-seat parliamentary majority when a
southeastern provincial electoral committee awarded a contested
seat to the United Left coalition.
   Official provisional results of the Oct. 29 elections gave Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists 176 of the 350 seats in the
lower house for their third-straight parliamentary majority since
coming to power in 1982.
   If the loss of the seat is upheld by the courts, it would mean
the loss of an absolute majority. However, it is not expected to
affect Gonzalez's ability to form a government when Parliament
convenes Nov. 21.
   The next-largest party in Parliament, the Popular Party, holds
106 seats or 69 fewer than the Socialists. The regional Basque
Nationalist Party, which won five seats, has said it will cooperate
with the Socialists whenever necessary.
   Murcia Socialist Party campaign director Juan Manuel Canizares
said Saturday the party will appeal the Murcia Electoral Board's
decision to the courts.
   The original provisional count in Murcia gave the Socialists
five seats, Popular Party three and the Democratic and Social
Center one.
   Voters in Spain elect deputies by slates presented in 52
provinces and electoral districts. The vote is tabulated by
province.
   The ruling by the Murcia Electoral Board was based on complaints
of electoral irregularities filed by the lefist coalition, which
will have won 18 seats nationwide if the decision is upheld.

   Opposition vice presidential candidate
Virgilio Godoy promised voters Saturday his coalition will abolish
the draft and release political prisoners it it wins elections in
February.
   Godoy, candidate of the 14-party United National Opposition,
spoke to a cheering crowd of 2,500 in the provincial town 38 miles
northeast of Managua.
   ``We don't want weapons, we want food!'' supporters yelled.
   Abolition of the draft, in effect for youths 18 to 25 years old,
and release of political prisoners, are included in the coalition's
official platform.
   The leftist Sandinista government has said it will declare an
amnesty for political prisoners after Contra rebels demobilize
under a five-nation peace agreement.
   Godoy is the running mate of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, a
newspaper publisher who is the main opposition to President Daniel
Ortega, who is running for reelection in the Feb. 25 race.
   As Godoy entered the town, a small group of youths threw rotten
eggs at his caravan. In his speech, he said the group of young
people had been corrupted by the Sandinista government.
   He called President Daniel Ortega's administration ``a
government of gangs that has brought the country only destruction,
pain, anguish and death.''
   About 1,000 people attended rallies for Godoy in each of three
other towns in the province of Boaco before he visited the
provincial capital.
   Boaco and neighboring Chontales have been the scene of fighting
between rebels and government troops since Ortega ended a 19-month
cease-fire on Nov. 1.

   Craig Spence, a high-profile lobbyist linked to a
Washington sex scandal under federal investigation, was found dead
after barricading himself in a hotel room, police said Saturday.
   Spence, 49, was found dead Friday in his room at the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel after firefighters used a saw to cut the door in
half.
   Spence had apparently barricaded the door with a bed. He was
found fully clothed and there were no visible signs of injuries.
   Suffolk County Medical Examiner Leonard Atkins said Saturday an
autopsy had been completed but the cause of death was still under
investigation. He said it could be weeks before his office issues a
cause of death.
   The Washington Times reported in August that Spence disclosed he
had AIDS and had threatened to commit suicide rather than die of
the disease.
   Spence checked into the Ritz-Carlton on Nov. 4 under an alias,
according to Patricia Cutler, the hotel's director of public
relations.
   Spence was identified this summer by the Times as a major client
of a homosexual escort service being investigated by the Secret
Service, the District of Columbia police and the U.S. attorney's
office for possible credit card fraud. Other clients of the
call-boy ring included minor officials of the Reagan and Bush
administrations, the Times said.
   The newspaper said Spence spent as much as $20,000 a month on
the escort service and quoted unidentified male prostitutes and
others as saying Spence had his house bugged.
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens in
Washington, said there would be no comment on Spence's death or its
impact on the investigation.
   Spence faced new problems July 31 when he was arrested at a New
York City motel on a felony weapons charge and misdemeanor
possession of crack.
   Spence also has been linked to a White House guard who has said
he accepted an expensive watch from Spence and gave him a piece of
presidential china. The guard also reportedly allowed Spence and
some friends to take midnight tours of White House public areas
last year.
   The Secret Service has said the tours were unauthorized, but not
a security breach.
   A former television news correspondent for ABC who reported from
Vietnam, Spence later became a lobbyist representing Japanese
clients.
   During the early years of the Reagan administration, in
particular, Spence cultivated top political appointees, leading
academics, military officials, journalists and members of Congress,
often entertaining them with star-studded parties.
   The Times said frequent party guests at his home included former
CIA Director William Casey, conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly
and James Lilley, ambassador to China and formerly to Korea.
   ``I had the world at my house and now they don't know who I
am,'' Spence told the newspaper in an interview earlier this year.
   According to records he filed under the Foreign Agents
Registration Act, Spence received $110,000 in a five-month period
in 1981 from the Policy Study Group of Tokyo, a non-profit group
financed by Japanese business interests and affiliated with a
faction of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
   Robert Neumann, who was once ambassador to Saudi Arabia and
several other countries, remembered Spence on Saturday as ``a nice,
somewhat erratic person.''
   Spence once arranged for Neumann and his wife to travel on an
expenses-paid trip to Japan.
   ``He invited me to a number of parties, all of which were to
enhance his business, but that was normal,'' Neumann said. ``He
always behaved in an immaculate fashion. Personally, I have only
kind memories of him.''
   Spence ceased working as a lobbyist for Japanese interests in
late 1987, documents show.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan has
postponed a trip to the United States, Japan and Denmark so he
could supervise relief efforts for victims from Typhoon Gay, which
killed at least 400 people.
   Thousands of victims from last night's typhoon, the worst to hit
the country in 35 years, have protested slow government aid and the
prime minister's earlier comment that the destruction he had seen
was not serious.
   Chatichai appealed for donations on national television Friday
night after visiting hard-hit Chumphon province, and he announced
postponement of visits to Denmark and the United States.
   A day earlier, he shortened his original tour in half and
canceled a stop in Japan on the trip that was to begin Sunday and
run through Nov. 25.
   Typhoon Gay swept through Chumphon and other southern provinces
on Nov. 4 with 100 mph winds. The Ministry of Interior reported
Friday that 365 people were killed on land. The navy said 58 people
died at sea _ not including the capsize of the U.S. drill ship
Seacrest, only six of whose 97 crewmembers have been rescued.
   In addition, the Fisheries Department said 540 fishermen aboard
140 boats remained missing.
   Chatichai on Monday caused an uproar by calling the destruction
``not serious.'' He spoke after visiting the less-affected Prachuab
Khiri Khan province north of Chumphon.
   Chumphon residents, many suffering from food shortages, blocked
roads and rallied several days this week to protest his remark and
the government's slow relief operations.
   Chatichai said he would visit Chumphon again this week,
accompanied by the U.S. ambassador to Thailand, Daniel O'Donohue.
   Chatichai's planned to meet with President Bush to discuss of
trade disputes and the situation in Cambodia after Vietnam's
recently claimed it withdrew of its last troops.

<TEXT>
   The Navy paid more than $140,000 in temporary
compensation Saturday to residents who lost their homes when a
military jet crashed into their apartment complex, killing two
people.
   Police in the north Atlanta suburb of Smyrna said they found no
more bodies inside the demolished apartments and had accounted for
all residents.
   The Cobb County Medical Examiner's office on Saturday identified
the first victim of the crash as Richard Dick, 24, who perished in
his incinerated apartment.
   Margie Padovani, 28, a pregnant woman who suffered severe burns
in the crash, died Friday night at Grady Memorial Hospital in
Atlanta.
   Residents evacuated after Thursday's crash were allowed to
return to what was left of their apartments Friday and Saturday to
retrieve personal effects. One resident whose home was not damaged
complained that her apartment had been looted despite military
security brought in almost immediately after the crash.
   ``You wouldn't believe the people who think this is a circus,''
said Kay Latcham, who claimed some of her property was missing.
   Police said they had received no reports of looting, however.
   About 57 residents of the apartment complex received checks from
a legal team from the Navy's Judge Advocate General Office in
Arlington, Va.
   Mike Hanna, a representative of the Navy office, said more than
$140,000 was issued in payments of up to $5,000 each.
   ``These are interim payments; these are not final payments,''
Hanna said. ``We realize people don't know exactly what they have
lost.''
   The team will remain at the Naval Air Station Atlanta until all
residents have time to list their lost belongings, Hanna said.
   The crash destroyed 12 of the apartment complex's 76 units and
heavily damaged another 20, said Kathie Barton, Smyrna's director
of community relations.
   The pilot of the Navy jet, Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn Jr., 37,
remained in critical condition Saturday at Kennestone Hospital.
Conlyn was the only person aboard the unarmed A-7E Corsair II
attack plane when it crashed on approach to Dobbins Air Force Base,
15 miles north of Atlanta.
   Ms. Padovani's daughter, Jacquelyn, 5, who suffered burns over
about half of her body, was in critical but stable condition at
Grady Memorial Saturday.
   A third resident was treated after the crash for cracked ribs,
and officials said a military rescue worker broke an ankle.
   Flights of Navy Attack Squadron 205, to which Conlyn was
attached, remained suspended but could resume Monday, Lt. Cmdr.
Barry Wilcox said.
   ``The commander wants to fly, but made it perfectly clear if we
were not mentally fit to fly we won't do it,'' Wilcox said.
   Capt. Peter Hunt, commander of the Naval Air Station, said there
were no new leads into the cause of the crash. Lt. Cmdr. Mark
Nickelson, Naval public affairs officer, said results of the Navy
investigation will not be available for at least 30 days.

   Thousands of people who falsified farm-worker
amnesty applications will get permanent resident status starting
next month under the 1986 immigration law, The New York Times
reported.
   The program, which offered farm workers a one-time amnesty, was
expected to accommodate 250,000, but more than 1.3 million illegal
aliens applied for legalization, the Times reported in Sunday's
editions.
   Estimates by federal officials and immigration experts say there
are between 250,000 and 650,000 fraudulent applications, the Times
said.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has identified
398,000 cases of possible fraud but admits it hasn't enough
manpower or money to prosecute individual applicants, the Times
said.
   The INS is to begin issuing permanent resident status to amnesty
applicants Dec. 1, and officials said they were approving 94
percent of the applicants over all.
   Supporters say the amnesty program has insured the nation a
cheap, reliable and legal supply of farm workers and has taken an
important step toward legitimizing many of the nation's illegal
aliens.
   But critics note cases like that of Larry and Sharon Marval of
Newark, N.J., who last year pleaded guilty to charges of
immigration fraud after investigators alleged they were part of an
operation that helped about 1,000 aliens get amnesty with falsified
documents showing they had all worked on just 30 acres of farmland.
   The farm workers' amnesty was a last-minute addition to the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which sought to halt
illegal immigration. It included a general amnesty offering a
chance at permanent resident status to those illegal aliens who
could prove they lived in the United States since before Jan. 1,
1982, and made it a crime to employ illegal aliens.

<HEAD>Free Press Suspends Reporter, Photographer Over Cocaine Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Detroit Free Press said it suspended a
reporter and a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer after they
revealed that the photographer bought items from a drug addict who
was a source for a report on crack-cocaine.
   Photographer Manny Crisostomo bought a Sony Walkman and a
sausage from a crack addict referred to as Tim in a story and
photographs published Oct. 15, according to Free Press executives
and employees.
   The addict used the money to buy crack, Executive Editor Heath
J. Meriwether said.
   Crisostomo was suspended without pay for three days and reporter
Pat Chargot for two days for ``violating ethical standards in our
`24 Hours special report,''' Meriwether said in a memo distributed
to the staff Friday.
   Crisostomo and Chargot originally told their editors that Tim
asked for money but they refused. Their story said the addict
begged for money but wasn't given any.
   In his staff memo, Meriwether said Chargot revealed the
purchases Monday as she was working on a follow-up story that the
paper has canceled. Crisostomo said he bought the items because he
feared the addict might become violent if he wasn't given any
money, Meriwether said.
   ``This serious breach of ethics is painful for everybody at this
newspaper who, like Chargot and Crisostomo, poured themselves into
that project and were extremely proud of it. All of us suffer for
this mistake,'' Meriwether said in Saturday's editions of the
newspaper.
   ``I still believe their work did not distort the reality of the
drug scene in this community,'' he said.
   The Free Press has no written code of ethics, a spokesman said.
   Crisostomo won a Pulitzer Prize in April for photos that
documented a year in the life of Detroit's Southwestern High
School. Crisostomo and Chargot did not return phone calls made to
their homes Saturday.

   The Abu Nidal terrorist group has killed more
than 150 of its members, including 20 top officials, in a bloody
internal power struggle, a newspaper reported.
   Nearly all 20 leaders were killed in Abu Nidal's own house in
Libya, The New York Times reported, quoting dissident leaders of
the group, officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization and
Arab diplomats.
   Abu Nidal's group, the Fatah Revolutionary Council, is
headquartered in Libya, where most of the killings took place, the
Times reported in Sunday's editions. The group vehemently opposes
the PLO leadership of Yasser Arafat and broke with the PLO in 1973.
   Virtually all the leaders killed were ``lured to Abu Nidal's
house near Tripoli on the pretext of discussing policy matters,
taken by surprise and killed in the house,'' according to a report
written by Abdulrahman Issa, a former member of the council's
10-man politburo, and quoted by the Times.
   ``Then, they were buried right there. Abu Nidal and his
hirelings poured the cement over their bodies themselves,'' the
report said. Abu Nidal's real name is Sabri al-Banna.
   The council is responsible for several major acts of terrorism,
including the 1986 bombing of an Istanbul synagogue that left 21
dead and attacks at airports in Vienna and Rome in 1985.
   Sobhia Murad, widow of the council's second-in-command, has
accused Abu Nidal of shooting her husband and burying him at the
council's camp near Tripoli _ an account corroborated by Arab
associates, the Times said.
   At the camp, Abu Nidal built a new room for his house on top of
the spot where two other senior commanders were buried in concrete
after being killed by him late last year, the Times said.
   The reports by Issa and other dissidents who left the group this
year have been submitted to the top leadership of the PLO and to
Libyan leader Muammar Gadhafi, the newspaper said. The Times
account did not specify when the killings were supposed to have
taken place.
   Abu Nidal's motive is to gain absolute control of the council's
estimated 500 to 1,000 members and its money, estimated at tens of
millions of dollars, the Times quoted dissidents as saying.
   In the past, Abu Nidal has said those council members executed
were found to be PLO infiltrators.

<HEAD>FBI Looks Into Senators' Role in Lincoln S&amp;L Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating the conduct of five
senators who allegedly intervened in 1987 with regulators on behalf
a now-defunct savings and loan that was owned by a major political
contributor, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions that FBI
agents last week extensively questioned Edwin Gray, former head of
the Home Loan Bank Board, and other regulators about an April 2,
1987, meeting between Gray and the senators.
   The senators are: Dennis DeConcini and John McCain of Arizona,
Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald W.
Riegle Jr. of Michigan. McCain is a Republican and the others are
Democrats.
   FBI spokesman Carlos Hernandez said he could neither confirm nor
deny the report. Cranston spokesman Murray Flander said he was
unaware of an FBI investigation and agents had not contacted the
senator. Glenn spokeswoman Rebecca Bell also said she had no
knowledge of FBI activities.
   There was no answer at the home phones of the spokesmen for the
other senators.
   Gray testified last week before the House Banking Committee that
at the April meeting in DeConcini's office the senator made a
request for him to ease regulation pressure on the Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association by dropping a rule barring the thrift's risky
investments.
   Gray said the other senators ``raised no objection whatsoever''
to DeConcini's proposal.
   The senators _ who received $1.3 million in campaign
contributions from Lincoln's owner Charles H. Keating _
acknowledged they were at the meeting but they disputed Gray's
contention that they sought favorable treatment for the ailing
thrift.
   Last April the government took control of Lincoln after it was
declared insolvent. Regulators estimate the thrift's failure will
cost taxpayers $2.5 billion.
   ``They (the FBI agents) seemed most interested in the
senators,'' one source told the Post.
   ``They seemed to have an extraordinary interest in what the
senators were doing'' the source added.
   The newspaper called the FBI decision to investigate unusual
because it touches the ``gray ethical area'' of congressmen's
actions on behalf of contributors.
   In addition to the FBI probe, the Senate ethics committee has
asked the senators to explain their presence at two April meetings
with Gray.
   Common Cause, a political watchdog organization, wrote a letter
asking Gerald E. McDowell, chief of the public integrity section of
the Justice Department, to open an investigation into whether
Keating violated federal election or other laws in trying ``to
influence'' the senators.
   McDowell acknowledged receiving the letter on Oct. 24, saying he
would review the information ``and the circumstances under which
five Senators received corporate donations, gifts, and@or campaign
contributions from Mr. Keating and his associates.''

<HEAD>Two Arrested After Cocaine Flown on Air Force Plane From Panama</HEAD>

   Authorities seized 66 pounds of cocaine flown
from Panama on an Air Force cargo plane and arrested a 13-year Army
veteran and his brother, who were to pick up the drugs, federal
officials said Saturday.
   The shipment, valued at about $3 million, had been monitored
from the time it was placed aboard the C-5 cargo plane at Howard
Air Force Base in Panama until its arrival at Dover Air Force Base
around midnight Friday, said Larry Whitfield, an agent with the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration in Wilmington.
   DEA and Air Force investigators had learned of the shipment
several months ago, Whitfield said.
   Two men suspected of serving as couriers were arrested by
undercover DEA agents and Air Force officials Saturday at a motel
where they apparently were waiting for the shipment, Whitfield said.
   Arrested were Nathan Thomas, 23, of New York, and his brother,
Warrant Officer Victor M. Thomas, 32, who was on leave from his job
as an Army maintenance worker at Fort Riley, Kan., said Walter
Thorp, a spokesman at the Dover base. Victor Thomas has been in the
Army for 13 years, he said.
   Both were charged with possession of cocaine with intent to
deliver and conspiracy, Whitfield said.
   They were being held at the Delaware Correctional Center near
Smyrna pending arraignment Monday in U.S. Magistrate Court in
Wilmington.
   Officials would not say who placed the drugs aboard the plane or
what kind of tip authorities received because they did not want to
jeopardize their investigation in Panama, Thorp said.
   They also would not say whether any members of the Air Force
were suspected of being involved in the smuggling operation.
Whitfield said he was not aware that any arrests had been made in
Panama.
   The cocaine _ in 30 kilogram bricks _ had a street value of
about $3 million, Whitfied said. In addition, authorities seized
$73,000 carried by the Thomas brothers, he said.
   The C-5 crew were told they were carrying a top-secret cargo but
were not informed of the contents of the cardboard box holding the
cocaine, said Carlos Cortez, special agent with the Air Force
Office of Special Investigations.

   President Bush is looking with ``encouragement and
hope'' at the dramatic events in Eastern Europe, offering help to
West Germany in coping with thousands of refugees but reacting with
restraint to the crumbling of the Berlin Wall.
   Bush vowed to act with prudence and imagination to the rapid
developments. But he promised no specific action Friday and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III ruled out substantial Western
aid for East Germany until ``there is political pluralism across
the board.''
   The president was watching the events from a speechmaking tour
in Texas, where he was helping dedicate the Texas Vietnam Veterans
Memorial today before returning to Washington.
   ``We live in exciting times. The rapidity of change is
mind-boggling. I will do my level best to conduct an imaginative
foreign policy, but I will be prudent,'' Bush said at a dinner
Friday night for Texas Gov. Bill Clements.

   Bulgaria's foreign minister took over
from longtime Communist leader Todor Zhivkov with promises of
political reform, but he also indicated the party has no intention
of sharing power.
   Zhivkov, who led Bulgaria through the Cold War and made it an
impenetrable part of the Iron Curtain, resigned Friday in the
latest political upheaval in the Soviet bloc.
   Zhivkov, 78, was the Soviet bloc's longest-serving party leader
when he stepped down at a meeting of the policy-setting Central
Committee. He served as Communist Party head for 35 years, during
which he molded Bulgaria into one of the Kremlin's most loyal
allies.
   Petar Mladenov, the new leader, is considered a relative
moderate whose stands have sometimes nettled hard-liners. In his
inaugural speech, he pledged a free flow of information and
guaranteed human rights, but gave few details.

   High-level delegations from the Soviet Union
and United States will meet next week to explore ways of expanding
trade as a prelude to the December summit between President Bush
and President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher will lead the U.S.
delegation in the talks Wednesday and Thursday at the Commerce
Department. The Soviet side will be headed by Konstantin F.
Katushev, Soviet minister of foreign economic relations.
   One of the items on the agenda for discussion will be the Soviet
push for waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment that imposes tariffs
on Soviet imports coming into the United States that are generally
five to 10 times higher than tariffs imposed on other countries.
   Bush announced last May that he would ask Congress to remove the
Soviet Union from the Jackson-Vanik tariff restrictions if the
Soviets put Gorbachev's more liberal emigration policies into law
and followed through with successful implementation of the new
policies.

   President Bush, accused by Democrats of favoring
tax relief for the rich, is trying to link his drive for a capital
gains tax cut to a new package of housing aid for the homeless.
   Bush unveiled a $4.2 billion package of housing initiatives in a
speech Friday before the National Association of Realtors.
   ``I'm calling on Congress to renew the low-income housing tax
credit, but make it part of a package that also includes the cut in
the capital gains tax,'' the president said in introducing his new
initiative HOPE, or Home Ownership and Opportunity for People
Everywhere.
   Bush gave no inkling of how he planned to pay for his housing
initiative, which would cost $4.2 billion in direct expenditures
over three years plus ``several billions'' in foregone federal
taxes, according to Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack
Kemp.
