<TEXT>
   The three Apollo 11 astronauts had
another ``splashdown'' Thursday, this time in the form of a party
with thousands of NASA employees celebrating the 20th anniversary
of their lunar landing.
   Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins
arrived from Washington, where they had lunch with President Bush.
   ``Twenty years ago, I sat in mission control when these guys
came down and I wouldn't miss this for the world,'' said Hans Mark,
a former Johnson Space Center director who is now chancellor for
the University of Texas.
   The space center party was patterned after the informal
celebrations that followed each Apollo mission. A crowd estimated
at 10,000 attended the event.
   ``This is just like the splashdown party 20 years ago, except
then they threw everybody in the pool,'' said Cookie Leisenring, a
former employee of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, who was trying to take pictures of the astronauts.
   Collins, Aldrin and Armstrong each got loud applause upon
arrival.
   Separate outdoor areas were designated for different departments
such as engineering and development, and recovery crew. Inside, a
band played in a gym-sized room decorated with star-shaped ballons
and blue balloons with the U.S. flag on them.
   Mark said the astronauts were very pleased to return and visit
with old friends. Many of those in the crowd wore buttons showing
Armstong on the moon and reading, ``July 20, 1969-1989 We Were
There.''
   On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin planted their footsteps
on the moon while Collins circled above in the spacecraft that
later carried the three men back to Earth. The splashdown party is
one of many events being hel????z~2to commemorate that
historic flight.
   After the party, the three former astronauts were to attend a
private party where they would watch a light display on Clear Lake
dubbed ``Thousand Points of Light.''
   That celebration was to begin at 9:56 p.m. _ the moment
Armstrong stepped on the moon two decades ago _ when a group of
boats simultaneously switch on strings of lights.

<HEAD>Senate Adopts Amendment that Opens Door for Military Aid to Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Senate voted Thursday night to open the
door to supplying military aid to the non-communist resistance
forces in Cambodia.
   By a vote of 59-39, it adopted an amendment by Sen. Charles
Robb, D-Va., opening the way for President Bush to make lethal aid
available to the resistance forces allied with Cambodia's Prince
Norodom Sihanouk in order to stiffen their ability to resist.
   The amendment is to a $4.6 billion State Department
authorization bill.
   The Senate earlier voted 97-1 for a more general amendment that
held out the promise of substantial aid to a new Cambodian
government, which is ``determined to prevent the return to power of
the Khmer Rouge.''
   Robb and other supporters of his amendment said it was essential
to supply lethal aid because the United States has a moral
imperative to bar the return of the Khmer Rouge.
   That left-wing faction is blamed for the killing of more than 1
million Cambodians when it ruled the country in the 1970's.
   Opponents of the Robb amendment said opening the door to aid
puts the United States ``on a slippery slope'' in Southeast Asia
similar to the development of its involvement in the Vietnam war.
   The amendment, similar to one already approved by the House,
does not specify the dollar amount of military aid or indicate what
kinds of weapons would be supplied.
   Robb said it does not directly authorize military aid but does
give the President the ``flexibility'' to ask authorization for it
at a later time.
   The Senate's action comes at a time when negotiations are
opening in Paris on the future of Cambodia after the announced
Sept. 30 withdrawal of the occupying Vietnamese army.
   ``The administration in my judgment needs that flexibility,''
Robb said. ``By aiding the non-communist resistance we advance the
prospects for a successful outcome in Paris. But if we do nothing
only heighten the prospects for a bloody civil war and the return
of the Khmer Rouge.''
   But Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., told the Senate: ``Military
aid to the so-called non-communist resistance would derail a
fast-moving peace process that promises real hope.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., appealed in vain for the Senate to
take more time to consider the issue.
   ``The president of the United States has not asked for one
dollar in military aid,'' he said. ``I may vote for military aid
when the president makes a request for it, when he says, this is
what we need, this is why we need it.''
   ``I say we've got time to consider this issue,'' Byrd said. ``We
don't have to vote for it at this hour of the night.''
   ``I stood on this floor when we slid into the war in Vietnam,''
Byrd said. ``I think we should let history give us some guidance
before we take sudden action here and write a blank check for the
president.''
   Other senators disagreed and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-N.J.,
called the Robb approach ``measured involvement.''
   ``This is our responsibility lest we be accused of forgetting
the lessons of the first Asian holocaust,'' Lieberman said. ``Let
us do what is required to keep a second one from occurring.''

<TEXT>
   The House approved a $65 billion spending bill
for housing, space and veterans programs Thursday but decided to
cut funding for a controversial program at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
   The bill, passed by a voice vote, provides no new money for a
HUD program currently being investigated by four congressional
panels and the Justice Department for fraud and mismanagement.
   A HUD inspector general's report alleged several former HUD
officials and Republican party fundraisers, including former
Secretary of Interior James Watt used political influence to get
funding for projects on which they were highly paid consultants or
developers.
   ``We did not want to fund a program which is having such
difficulty,'' said Rep. Bill Green of New York, ranking Republican
on the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for
HUD, the Veterans Administration and independent agencies.
   The bill also would reclassify all deputy assistant secretaries,
administrators and directors at HUD and other agencies covered by
the legislation as career positions. Persons now in these positions
are political appointees of the president.
   However, it was funding for a planned space station on the moon
and expanded U.S. exploration that dominated debate on the bill on
Thursday, the 20th anniversary of man's first lunar landing.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., attempted to transfer $714 million
from the space station to veterans medical services, pollution
control and research and low-income and elderly housing.
   ``The space station is not the way to go to space. It is the B-2
bomber of the space program,'' said Schumer.
   Schumer estimated the space station and a proposal by President
Bush for a manned mission to Mars would cost $400 billion.
   ``I am a believer in space technology,'' said Schumer, ``but you
can't have everything.''
   ``As we reach for the stars, let us not forget those who live
underneath them'' he added.
   While Schumer's proposal might save money in the short term,
Green warned that decreasing spending for space by small amounts at
a time would drive the overall costs up.
   ``The one thing that is going to drive the cost of the space
station through the roof is to nickel and dime it,'' said Green.
   Schumer ``really saves a penny this year but he will be spending
pounds and pounds in later years,'' added Green.
   Schumer's proposal was defeated by a 291-125 vote.
   The House appropriations bill earmarks $1.65 billion of NASA's
$12.2 billion budget for the space station. The bill reduces the
Bush administration budget request for NASA by $1 billion.
   The bill also provides:
   _$15.1 billion for HUD, including $9.1 billion for assisted
housing and $456 million to fully fund programs under the Stewart
B. McKinney Homeless Act
   _$29.5 billion for the Veterans Administration, including $820
million for veterans medical care
   _$35.5 million for the Consumer Product Safety Commission
   _$5.4 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency

   Federal records indicate past major problems
with the tail engine of a United Airlines DC-10 that crashed
Wednesday as it attempted to make an emergency landing with about
290 people aboard.
   The jet's tail engine, or engine No. 2, failed just prior to the
crash, and the 15-year-old plane experienced ``complete hydraulic
failure,'' Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar
said.
   However, it could not be determined Wednesday night whether the
tail engine that experienced the previous problems was the same No.
2 engine that was on the jet when it crashed.
   Meanwhile, a passenger who rode same DC-10 from Philadelphia to
Denver Wednesday morning said the plane had been delayed because of
technical problems.
   Mrs. Ruth Dinsmore of Mount Laurel, N.J., said passengers boarded
tha plane and and it began to leave the terminal at Philadelphia
International Airport shortly after 10 a.m., when ``everything sort
of shut off.''
   Mrs. Dinsmore said the pilot came on the PA system and said ``a
little gizmo'' had gone wrong.
   She said the plane taxied back to the terminal, where the plane
sat for about 15 minutes while the ``gizmo'' was being fixed.
   FAA records, obtained for The Associated Press by the Aircraft
Owners and Pilots Association, indicate that on Oct. 7, 1988, the
No. 2 engine overheated and shut down just after takeoff from O'Hare
Airport in Chicago.
   An inspection of the engine later revealed that a turbine blade
had failed and broken free from the engine's platform.
   On Sept. 30, 1988, the No. 2 engine also reportedly quit
operating at 16,000 feet because of ``extensive high pressure and
low pressure turbine damage,'' the report said.
   The primary cause of the shutdown was a blade that separated at
the blade root due to an ``ailing edge crack,'' the report said.
   On July 20, 1983, the report said, the No. 2 engine shut down due
to ``vibration.'' An inspection revealed a broken turbine blade, the
report said.
   The report also indicated problems with the other two engines on
the plane.
   On Sept. 26, 1986, the plane's No. 1 engine was replaced after an
inspection revealed a cracked second-stage blade.
   On Nov. 13, 1987, the report said, the flight crew reported that
the No.3 engine vibrated and lost power as the plane climbed to
4,000 feet after taking off from Los Angeles. An engine tear-down
later revealed that an engine blade failed and caused additional
bearing failure.

   The European Economic Community has
taken the first step to supply emergency food to Poland, which was
singled out for a helping hand at the economic summit of leading
industrial nations.
   Officials of the 12-nation trading bloc put forward a proposal
Wednesday for shipping surplus agricultural products to Poland,
which is suffering from serious food shortages.
   The European Commission, the EEC's executive body, said the food
will be provided to Poland in a way that will ensure that the
government begins to take measures to reform the country's
devastated economy.
   The plan must be approved by agriculture ministers of the 12
nations that belong to the trading bloc. They are scheduled to meet
Monday and Tuesday.
   President Bush and the leaders of Canada, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy and Japan agreed at their summit in Paris last week
to ship food to Poland as soon as possible. They also called for a
conference to coordinate support for reform measures in both Poland
and Hungary.
   The European Economic Community, also known as the Common Market,
was assigned to take charge of the tasks.
   In a statement, the European Commission announced it adopted a
framework for urgently supplying food to Poland. The food will come
out of the stocks the community has built up by its farmers.
   Officials said the commission was considering a plan that would
allow the Poles to sell the community's food on the free market and
use the money for economic improvements, such as improving the food
distribution system.

   A group that wants to improve the image
of taverns in the state's eastern Panhandle elected a topless bar
owner as president, and he says his job hasn't been easy.
   ``I'm not interested in getting publicity about the fact that I
own a topless bar. Luckily, it hasn't blown up in my face, yet,''
said C.B. ``Butch'' Pennington, owner of the Opequon Hill Lounge and
president of the Tri-County Club and Tavern Owners Association.
   The association was created following an April gambling raid on
33 bars in the Panhandle in which police confiscated 70 illegal
gambling devices, including poker machines.
   ``The biggest mistake that people have is that all you go into a
tavern for is to drink and gamble,'' Pennington said. ``That's just
not so. You go in to talk to people. It's like going into a friend's
house. You relax and swap stories.''
   Pennington said the owners were upset by the raid because the
state Supreme Court previously ruled that poker machines are legal.
The group plans to lobby state and local government to improve
business conditions for tavern owners.
   ``We just want to show them that we're in a legitimate business
and, like everybody else, we deserve a fair shake,'' Pennington
said. ``We know more than just how to mix drinks. There are some
things we can do to help old folks, children, charities, things like
that.''

   The postman may always ring twice, but
sometimes he rings 32 years too late.
   Mildred St. Onge received her mail as usual Tuesday only to find
a post card addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Simmons. Mrs. Simmons
was her name in 1957, the year marked on the card. Her brother and
sister-in-law had sent it while vacationing in Florida 32 years ago.
   ``I didn't believe it. I really didn't believe it,'' said Mrs.
St. Onge, 67, who has been widowed twice. ``My brother has been dead
since 1977 and my husband (Simmons) has been dead since 1963.''
   New Bedford Postmaster Antone L. Silva has seen three such late
letter deliveries in his 24 years on the job. He said the card could
have gone astray within the post office, or been misdelivered and
mailed again years later.
   ``Thirty-two years is a long time,'' said Mrs. St. Onge, who was
35 when the card was mailed. ``My husband would have laughed.''

   A nude sculpture got a second unveiling here
when the Arkansas Arts Center heeded a protest from the work's owner
and took down a cloth that had covered the piece.
   Townsend Wolfe, the center's director, said Tuesday the covering
had been brought down after complaints were raised last week. The
sculpture had been draped on occasion at the request of visitors
leading groups of children younger than about 12, he said.
   Foster Goldstrom, the New Yorker who owns the work that is on a
three-year tour of the country, said earlier this week he thought it
was small-minded to cover up the sculpture and he planned to write
the center's board of directors about the matter.
   The artist, John DeAndrea of Santa Cruz, Calif., also had
expressed his displeasure with the draping.
   The work is a self-sculpture of DeAndrea seated in a chair
looking at a nude woman.
   Michael Goldstrom, 14, son of the art collector and dealer,
called the Arkansas Gazette Monday and said it was disrespectful,
even criminal, to drape the sculpture.
   ``Who gives them the right to put that cover on the sculpture?''
he said. ``The board of directors obviously has no concept of the
historical and artistic value of this work.''

   A United Airlines DC-10 carrying 293
people crashed Wednesday in an explosive ball of fire and
cartwheeled down a runway after the pilot tried to make an emergency
landing. At least 178 survived the crash, officials said.
   A fire official initially estimated 185 to 195 were killed in the
crash, but officials later backed off the figure. ``We simply don't
have an estimate we can rely on,'' Fire Captain Terry Schmidt said
at a news conference.
   Flight 232, from Denver to Philadelphia via Chicago, carried 11
crew members and 282 passengers, including three infants on laps,
said United spokesman Lawrence Nagin. He said the three members of
the cockpit crew survived the crash and were being treated for
injuries.
   Dick Bohs, spokesman for Gov. Terry Branstad, said 61 bodies were
found. The search for bodies at Sioux Gateway Airport was suspended
late Wednesday due to darkness and was to resume Thursday.
   Nagin said a list of the dead and survivors would be released as
soon as possible. He could not confirm the number of dead.
   The plane crashed on an inactive runway at Sioux Gateway Airport
after circling for about a half-hour while pilots told passengers to
prepare for a crash-landing, survivors said. The accident was one of
the deadliest air disasters in U.S. history.
   The 15-year-old plane had ``complete hydraulic failure'' before
the crash just after 4 p.m., Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman Fred Farrar said. The tail engine failed, and this may
have caused a hydraulic failure, said Bob Raynesford, another FAA
spokesman.
   Nagin said he did not know if hydraulic problems were a factor.
   A passenger who rode same DC-10 from Philadelphia to Denver on
Wednesday morning said the plane had been delayed in Philadelphia
because of technical problems.
   Ruth Dinsmore of Mount Laurel, N.J., said the plane began to
leave the terminal at Philadelphia International Airport shortly
after 10 a.m., when ``everything sort of shut off.''
   Mrs. Dinsmore said the pilot came on the PA system and said ``a
little gizmo'' had gone wrong. It was 15 minutes before it was
fixed, she said.
   Late Wednesday, City Manager Hank Sinda said 185 people were
taken alive to St. Luke's Medical Center and Marian Health Center,
both in Sioux City. He said seven had died at the hospitals.
   The search for bodies was difficult because they were scattered
in a field of corn 4 feet tall. Rescuers continued to search the
corn fields late Wednesday.
   Dr. Romaine Bendixen, clinic commander of Iowa National Guard's
185th tactical fighter group, said he was the first doctor on the
scene, about three minutes after the crash. He had just landed in
another plane.
   He said the living were scattered among the dead.
   ``In one group of six seats, a woman sitting in the middle was
barely injured, her husband beside her was dead and two behind her
were dead,'' Bendixen said.
   He said rescuers pulled out three of the flight crew alive.
   Survivor Charles Martz of Castle Pines, Colo., said there was no
panic after the pilot announced there was engine trouble. Then, just
before landing, the pilot ``came on and said that this may be more
than a rough landing, so do the best you can to assume the (crash
preparedness) position.''
   ``Suitcases, paper, mail, clothes, unfortunately people, were
laying all over the runway,'' said witness Ed Forst.
   Still, some people walked away from the wreckage.
   Melanie Cincala of Toledo, Ohio, a passenger on Flight 232, said
there was a fire on the plane, and a fireball ``flashed past us.''
The plane burst into flames after she got off, she said.
   ``We could see the plane tumbling down the runway,'' said Mark
Smith, a witness who said he was working about 1,500 yards from the
site.
   He said the plane broke into ``15,000 different pieces.''
   Maj. Rick Sorensen with the Iowa Air National Guard said he had
just landed his plane when the jetliner crashed.
   ``Shortly before touchdown ... the right wing began to dip or
began to roll and the nose began to fall to a position of
approximately 15 to 25 degrees right bank and possibly 10 degrees
nose low,'' he told CNN. ``It was very apparent at that moment that
he could not make a safe landing. The only question would have been
how disastrous a landing would it be. It was a very disastrous
landing.''
   Sorensen said that while he was in the air he heard radio traffic
from the pilot.
   ``The suggestion ... was that he could turn only in one direction
and he was not sure he could make the runway. Then he turned left
and headed for the southwest runway ... and everything appeared to
be somewhat about normal.'' Then, the right wing dipped.
   The plane ``bounced twice, flipped into the air and we were
sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke,'' said
Cliff Marshall of Columbus, Ohio, a passenger returning home from
Denver.
   ``Then God opened a hole in the basement and I pushed a little
girl out. I grabbed another, kept pulling them out until they didn't
come no more.''
   Marshall said he thought he helped a half-dozen out and then he
ran.
   Asked about a survivor who reported an explosion before the
crash, Nagin said he knew nothing beyond the report and that talk
about sabotage was ``only speculation.''
   At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, where the plane was
due, people waiting for Flight 232 were in a room guarded by airline
personnel and police. A clergyman was in the room.
   Among the passengers of the plane were the two top officials of
the Continental Basketball Association, a league spokesman said.
Commissioner Jay Ramsdell, 25, had not been accounted for early
Wednesday evening, but deputy commissioner Jerry Schemmel was among
the survivors, the spokesman said.
   Lavonne Quirin of Alta in Buena Vista County said she and her
husband found what appeared to be the plane's nose cone in a corn
field at their seed corn business, 75 miles from the airport.
   The airport has two active runways, each 9,000 feet long, which
can accommodate a plane the size of a DC-10. The area around the
airport, which is seven miles from downtown, is crop land in corn,
soybeans and pasture with some trees.
   The DC-10-10 was delivered to United in April 1974. Routine
inspections had been conducted on the plane, Nagin said.
   No unusual weather was reported. Wind speeds were clocked to 30
mph.
   The nation's worst air crash happened 10 years ago and involved a
DC-10.
   On May 25, 1979, American Airlines Flight 191 lost an engine on
takeoff from O'Hare Airport, banked sideways out of control, slammed
into a field and exploded. All 271 people on board died, as well as
two people on the ground.
   The National Transportation Safety Board cited
``maintenance-induced damage'' _ a 10-inch crack in the engine mount
_ that caused the left engine to tear loose. The NTSB also
criticized McDonnell Douglas' design as vulnerable to maintenance
damage.
   McDonnell Douglas suspended production of the DC-10 airliner in
1983. DC-10 orders collapsed in 1979 because of the recession and
the May 1979 crash. In all, 369 DC-10s were produced.
   The second-worst crash in U.S. history killed 156 people on Aug.
16, 1987, when a Northwest Airlines jet crashed on takeoff at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport. One child on the plane survived.

   Archaeologists have uncovered the bones
of as many as four people in a mass grave near the reputed site
where self-proclaimed cannibal Alferd Packer's victims perished, the
scientists said Wednesday.
   The diggers, who found the bodies of at least two men and
possibly four on Tuesday, said they also found burlap and a green
suspender clip holding remnants of brown cloth.
   ``The cloth is most remarkable,'' said archaeologist Jim Ayres.
``It could help us put a date on things.''
   The scientists are part of an expedition formed by George
Washington University law professor James Starrs, who is looking for
clues to the truth about what occurred on the snow-packed mountain
ridge in 1874.
   Packer, who formed a gold-hunting party with five other men, said
the group became stranded on the ridge two miles south of Lake City
during a bitter winter.
   Packer, the lone survivor, wandered into what is now Lake City in
April 1874.
   He told authorities that Shannon Bell, a member of the group,
killed the other four gold seekers and that he was forced to kill
Bell in self-defense. Packer said he consumed the remains of the
five in order to survive.
   He was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 40 years in
prison. The case has been a topic of debate ever since.
   The archaeologists' findings indicated the men's bodies were
wrapped in burlap and buried in a mass grave, said Walter Birkby,
curator of physical anthropology at Arizona State University in
Tucson.
   The bones were in a jumbled mass, forcing scientists to move
slowly in uncovering them.
   As the scientists worked in the dig site, which Starrs calls the
``bone zone,'' residents and onlookers kept watch nearby.
   Ayres said the scientists would test the cloth, suspender clip
and other artifacts to estimate their age.
   The scientific expedition began Monday.

<HEAD>Ortega Campaigns During 10th Anniversary Rally</HEAD>

   President Daniel Ortega gave a
full-fledged campaign speech on the 10th anniversary of the
Sandinista revolution, knowing his government's performance in the
next seven months is more important than all the triumphs and
failures of the past decade.
   Ortega, whose country has become the Western Hemisphere's
poorest, promised better times ahead and said Nicaraguans are better
off today than before July 19, 1979, when Sandinista guerrillas
marched victoriously into Managua.
   He called on President Bush to dismantle the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels, most of whom are in neighboring Honduras, and even praised
some opposition leaders who joined the Sandinistas at the start of
the revolution then left it, feeling betrayed.
   About 200,000 people gathered at a huge plaza along the shores of
Lake Managua on Wednesday for a rally, the highlight of otherwise
lackluster 10th anniversary celebrations.
   Observers who have been at other anniversary celebrations said
most of those attending the 90-minute rally were either party
loyalists or public employees afraid of losing their jobs if they
didn't show up.
   Ortega, who estimated the crowd at more than 300,000, said the
large number showed the Sandinistas have at least that many votes
assured for general elections set for Feb. 25.
   The Sandinista show of strength at the rally might scare the
opposition into abstaining from the ballot, Ortega said.
   ``But let's all be very clear about this ... they can take or
leave the elections, but there will be elections on Feb. 25, 1990,''
he said. ``And they will be clean and honest elections, like the
ones in 1984.''
   In a 50-minute speech, Ortega said his government is controlling
inflation, which ``is not smashing us as is happening in other
countries.''
   Inflation in Nicaragua surpassed 20,000 percent in 1988, but
stiff austerity measures brought it down to a monthly rate of 12
percent in June.
   However, the cost has been high. The government has fired 35,000
public employees and tightened credit restrictions and public
spending.
   Foreign aid has decreased. A 10-country European tour in April
and May from which Ortega hoped to get $250 million for the country
to survive the year, produced just $50 million.
   Nevertheless, at the end of his speech, Ortega proclaimed: `Today
the people are better off than before 1979.
   ``Better days will come,'' he added.
   Ortega did not elaborate and left the promises fluttering in the
cool morning breeze from the lake.
   He accused the United States of continuing its ``imperialist
aggression'' against Nicaragua by maintaining a commercial blockade
and blocking credit.
   ``The United States still hasn't decided to be respectful of the
rights of the nations of the Third World ... and of Nicaragua.
   ``If the president of the United States is for peace ... he
should stop immediately his policy of war against the people of
Nicaragua and allow the Contras to be dismantled from Honduran
territory.''
   Most of the U.S.-backed rebels are known to have moved to jungle
camps in neighboring Honduras after their leaders and the
Sandinistas signed a temporary truce in March 1988. Contra bands
still roam northern and central Nicaragua and sporadic skirmishes
still are reported.
   Ortega gave guarded praise to three members of the five-member
junta that took control after dictator Anastasio Somoza fled the
country on July 17, 1979. The three later left the junta, leaving
only Ortega and current Vice President Sergio Ramirez.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, a powerful symbol of upper-class
unity with the Sandinistas against Somoza and now the leading
contender for opposition presidential candidate, resigned April 19,
1980.
   She said the Sandinistas' goals were incompatible with her hopes
for a democratic Nicaragua.
   Ortega said Wednesday that Mrs. Chamorro's decision not to accept
``conditions that the gringos wanted to impose on the junta'' was
``firm and courageous.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's family owns the opposition newspaper La Prensa,
shut down several times during by Somoza regime and again by the
Sandinistas. It did not publish on Wednesday.

   Actor Sylvester Stallone says he really isn't a
macho, monosyllabic guy, although he admits he's played that role in
so many films that he'd almost forgotten how to talk.
   ``It's not really me. It was a book that I interpreted,''
Stallone said of his Rambo films. ``I inherited the mantle. I'm not
monosyllabic. I'm not that quiet. I'm not a loner by nature.''
   A clean-shaven, neatly dressed and bespectacled Stallone met with
reporters Tuesday in Cincinnati where he is filming scenes for a
Warner Bros. picture co-starring Kurt Russell. Stallone plays an
undercover policeman who is refined and articulate _ a man more
inclined to wearing suits and dabbling in the stock market.
   His next film, ``Lockup,'' opens in early August, and Stallone
said he is more optimistic about it than he has been about any film
since the first ``Rocky'' in 1976.
   ``It's an ensemble,'' he said. ``It isn't just me out there with
a rifle, swinging from a tree for 2{ hours. At least I get to act,
get to talk, which I'd almost forgotten how to do in the past few
films. It's like the re-education of Sylvester Stallone.''

   Multimillionaire publisher Malcolm S.
Forbes and nine members of the biking club Capitalist Tools rolled
into this historic Mississippi River town on a seven-day journey
down the Great River Road.
   ``We began where the Mississippi began, and we're going to where
it ends,'' Forbes said of the 2,100-mile trek.
   The motorcyclists spent Tuesday night at a bed-and-breakfast inn
and left Wednesday for New Orleans, their final destination.
   The 69-year-old publisher said he found the route more enjoyable
than his normal commute.
   ``We've gone through 10 states and experienced less traffic than
one hour of driving from New Jersey to New York,'' he said. ``You
feel like you're really getting to the heart of America.''
   The trip did have its wrong turns, though.
   ``We followed Highway 72 on a 1988 Rand-McNally map of Tennessee
and the road got rougher and rougher ... the bridge was out,'' he
said. The crew asked a farmer if it was possible to cross the river
and he replied, ``If you can leap these bikes 40 feet you can
cross,'' Forbes said.

   Folk singer Joan Baez sang a new song
protesting the recent violence in China. The performance was at a
charity concert attended by Prince Charles and Princess Diana.
   The 48-year-old U.S. singer said she had thought about singing
``Lady Di,'' which she wrote eight years ago, but decided, ``It just
wouldn't have been protocol.''
   Instead, she sang the China protest song at the Prince's Trust
Rock Gala at Birmingham's National Exhibition Center. Wednesday
night's concert drew about 10,000 people and raised $800,000 for the
trust, which helps young people.
   Baez, who met the royal couple before the show, said she was
flattered to be invited. ``I am pleased that I can still enjoy
performing,'' she said. ``I'll try to go on for another 10 years,
but then I'll have to put my teeth in a jar.''

   The Duke and Duchess of York thanked a crowd
for a warm welcome after getting a rough reception a few days
earlier on their Canadian tour.
   ``Sarah and I are particularly touched by the warm welcome of
Quebecers,'' Prince Andrew told a gathering at a civic welcome
Wednesday outside City Hall. ``Thank you for the most wonderful
welcome.''
   The thanks seemed intended, in part, to quiet some controversy
fanned by the British press, which reported that Sarah was shaken
when the couple was booed Sunday at the closing ceremonies of a
summer festival in Quebec City.
   For his part, Mayor Michel Legere offered a down-to-earth
greeting, urging the royal couple to ``have a Hull of a good time.''
   Later the duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, visited a
rehabilitation center in adjacent Ottawa and spoke to victims of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis _ a degenerative neuro-muscular
affliction also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

   Former ``Hollywood Squares'' host Peter
Marshall has sued actor Burt Reynolds and game show host Bert Convy,
contending they broke a contract to hire him as host of a new quiz
show.
   Marshall claimed in Wednesday's Superior Court lawsuit that he
was host of the successful pilot of ``3rd Degree'' and was promised
he would continue in that role for the 1989-90 season, said his
lawyer, Dorothy Wolpert.
   Although announcements were made that the former ``Hollywood
Squares'' host would preside over ``3rd Degree,'' he was told on
June 30 that he would not get the job after all, the suit alleged.
   Soon thereafter, it was announced that Convy was not being
renewed as host of ``Win, Lose or Draw'' and would replace Marshall
on ``3rd Degree,'' the suit said.
   The suit seeks $1 million in compensatory damages and asks for
punitive damages in an amount to be set by the court.
   ``3rd Degree'' is produced by Burt &amp; Bert Productions and Kline &amp;
Friends, Inc. The suit accuses Reynolds' and Convy's company and the
other company of breach of contract and fraud by replacing Marshall.

<HEAD>Clean Air Draft Plan Sets Ozone Cleanup Deadlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nineteen cities likely would be given 10 years
to fix their ozone pollution problems, while severely polluted Los
Angeles, Houston and New York would have two decades, according to a
draft of President Bush's clean air bill.
   The multibillion-dollar cleanup plan would set four new
categories for cities with ozone problems _ severe, serious,
moderate or marginal _ and require the most polluted communities to
use the most stringent remedies.
   The Associated Press obtained a draft of the proposal, and then
applied the latest available Environmental Protection Agency air
monitoring data to determine which cities would fall into the two
most serious ozone pollution categories.
   There could be some changes when new air quality information
becomes available, probably next month, but EPA officials said the
number of switches should be small.
   Ozone is a highly reactive gas that irritates and inflames
sensitive lung tissues. This causes a host of adverse health
effects, including chest pains, shortness of breath, coughing,
nausea, throat irritation and increased susceptibility to
respiratory infections.
   The current EPA data would place these areas in the ``serious''
category for a 10-year cleanup: Chicago-Gary, Ind.;
Cincinnati-Hamilton, Ohio; Hartford-New Britain-Middletown, Conn.;
Milwaukee-Racine, Wis.; Philadelphia-Wilmington, Del.-Trenton, N.J.;
Providence-Pawtucket, R.I.-Fall River, Mass.; Atlanta; Baltimore;
Baton Rouge, La.; Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas; El Paso, Texas;
Huntington, W.Va.-Ashland, Ky.; Louisville, Ky.; Portland, Maine;
San Diego; Sheboygan, Wis.; Springfield, Mass.; St. Louis; and the
District of Columbia.
   EPA officials verified both the list of 19 areas that would be
given 10 years to correct ozone problems and the three cities in the
severe, 20-year cleanup category.
   William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial
Air Pollution Program Administrators, the organization of state and
local air pollution officials, also said he did not expect many
changes in the cities' classifications.
   Bush is expected to submit the bill to Congress as early as
Friday. The top 80 metropolitan areas in the country, and about 15
rural areas, are out of compliance with U.S. clean air standards
under current law.
   The Bush proposal is only one way of attacking the ozone problem,
and environmentalists and their supporters in Congress are expected
to push for their own proposals.
   The EPA estimates that nationwide ozone cleanup efforts would
cost $5 billion to $10 billion a year through the year 2000 and $8
billion to $12 billion a year afterward.
   The Bush administration legislation envisions the ozone cleanup
as being financed largely by industries, including petroleum,
automobile, paint and ink producers. Many of the costs would likely
be passed on to consumers.
   The bill would order national measures including new controls on
motor vehicle emissions, hazardous waste facilities, and smaller
sources of pollutants such as consumer solvents. Oil companies would
have to tighten volatility requirements for gasolines.
   The ``severe'' and ``serious'' areas also would need to have
stricter inspection and maintenance programs for motor vehicles;
capture emissions from refueling at the gas pump; and EPA-ordered
controls on seven additional categories of industrial or commercial
sources of pollution.
   These areas would be required to reduce ozone emissions at an
average rate of 3 percent a year _ for 20 years, in the case of
severely polluted areas and for 10 years for the serious areas.
   The Bush plan includes a series of existing and new penalties
that could be imposed on areas that fail to comply with the law.
These steps, which have been applied sparingly by EPA, include a
moratorium on construction of anything that would increase
pollution, loss of federal highway funds, restrictions on new
drinking water hookups, and withholding money to run clean air
programs.

<HEAD>Energy Department May Face Possible Criminal Charges, Plant Shutdowns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Energy Department faces more criminal
probes of its nuclear weapons plants _ and mounting public pressure
to close them _ unless it controls their environmental and safety
problems, federal auditors say.
   In a report highly critical of department management, the
auditors said urgent action is needed to ensure that environmental
laws are obeyed and the public is reassured that the government can
reliably and safely run the weapons plants.
   The report dated July 14 was made public Wednesday by a House
panel as a senior Energy Department official disclosed that a
special group of experts from outside the department had been
dispatched to a weapons plant in Colorado.
   Leo Duffy, a special assistant to Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins, said in testimony prepared for a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee that the experts will attempt to verify the origin of a
manmade radioactive element discovered at the Rocky Flats plant near
Denver. The plant processes plutonium for weapons manufacturing.
   Scientists of the Environmental Protection Agency have said it is
possible the radioactive materials strontium and cesium were
produced by an accidental nuclear reaction, even though Rocky Flats
operations do not include the splitting of atoms.
   Duffy said that while earlier Energy Department reviews of the
radioactive material gave no evidence that a chain reaction had
occurred, Watkins wants an independent study to ``help alleviate
public concern regarding safety at this facility.''
   Phil Keif, a department spokesman, said the experts arrived at
the site last week and are expected to report their findings by
mid-September. He said he had no other details.
   Duffy also disclosed that the FBI and the Environmental
Protection Agency have launched an investigation of alleged criminal
violations of environmental laws at the Feed Materials Production
Center, an Energy Department weapons plant at Fernald, Ohio.
   Duffy's statement provided no details, and the FBI and EPA said
they could not comment. Duffy did not present his remarks in person
because the subcommittee hearing was interrupted before his turn to
speak, and it was not resumed.
   The auditor's report, from the Energy Department's office of
inspector general, said the department is unable to ensure that its
nuclear facilities _ including 17 major weapons plants in 12 states
_ are meeting state or federal environmental standards.
   ``Thus it faces the possibility of facility shutdowns, criminal
prosecutions of employees and increased congressional constraints
over internal operations,'' the report said.
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of the subcommittee, said he
was shocked to learn that the department had no way of determining
its own compliance with environmental laws. He harshly criticized
John C. Layton, the inspector general, for not finding this flaw
earlier.
   ``You're not a watchdog, you're a lap dog,'' Luken said.
   Layton disputed the charge, but later acknowledged that ``in
hindsight it may have taken too long'' for his office to take a
broad look at the environmental problems.
   Layton told Luken he decided to take the unusual step of making
public a ``flash'' preliminary version of the audit ``because of the
urgency'' of the problems it identifies.
   Among the key findings is that the Energy Department is unable to
solve environmental problems at its weapons plants because managers
and other employees are not properly trained and are not fully
knowledgeable about environmental law.
   The report also said the department had failed to adequately
oversee the work of the private companies that operate the weapons
plants under federal contracts.

   Negative political ads from ``independent''
advocacy groups are leaving voters with a bad taste in their mouths,
says Sen. Ernest F. Hollings.
   ``The election campaign of last fall hit a new low,'' the South
Carolina Democrat said Wednesday in pushing for a new law to combat
the effects of ``attack'' ads.
   ``It left an odious trail with hit and run attacks, misleading
claims, hidden players and a lack of discussion of the major
issues,'' he told the Senate Commerce communications subcommittee.
   He noted voter turnout in the 1988 election was the lowest since
1924, at just more than 50 percent, saying the public has been
turned off by virulent television spots that slash candidates
without discussing substantive issues.
   ``America knew more about Willie Horton than it did about either
presidential candidate,'' Hollings said. He was referring to ads
attacking Democrat Michael Dukakis for a Massachusetts furlough
program that freed a convict who later raped a woman.
   Political analyst Curtis Gans illustrated the level of political
rhetoric by showing ads ranging from Lyndon Johnson's famous 1964
anti-Barry Goldwater message counting down to a nuclear explosion,
to one against Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., in which a Fidel Castro
lookalike lit a cigar with roll of American foreign aid dollars.
   Hollings has introduced a bill along with Sens. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, and John Danforth, R-Mo., to require broadcasters to
provide free air time to anyone targeted by a negative ad from
political action committees not connected with a candidate or
political party.
   The bill also would require candidates to personally appear in
any ad that mentions his or her opponent.
   The subcommittee is considering another bill by Sens. Richard
Bryan, D-Nev., and Bob Graham, D-Fla., that would require political
ad sponsors to be clearly identified on the air.
   Both bills are aimed mainly at PACs, which under federal law may
make direct campaign contributions of $5,000 in a primary and $5,000
in the general election.
   But special interests may spend unlimited amounts on campaigns as
long it is done without the knowledge or cooperation of the
campaigns and candidates that benefit from independent spending.
   Hollings said his bill would help make ``the playing field more
level'' by giving those attacked the means to respond. ``It in no
way says to these independent parties that they cannot advertise,''
he said.
   He said the massive expenditures by the PACs _ $10 million on
broadcast ads in 1986 _ have driven up the costs of campaigns as
candidates take out their own ads to shoot back.
   Except at one point when Hollings attacked Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., for ads depicting ``bloodhounds'' searching for an absentee
opponent, the senators Wednesday generally steered clear of the
touchy subject of negative ads carried out by their colleagues.
   Several witnesses expressed First Amendment concerns about the
Hollings-Danforth bill. Former Republican Sen. Charles McC. Mathias
of Maryland and American Civil Liberties Union counsel Barry Lynn
said the bill would involve the government in content regulation of
political ads.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said since challengers naturally must
attack the records of incumbents, the Hollings bill would
``dramatically restrict'' the challenger's ability to wage a
campaign.

<HEAD>Pilot's Report of Hydraulic Failure Signals Loss of Control</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-DC-10 Crash Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The pilot's report of ``complete hydraulic failure''
just before a United Airlines DC-10 cartwheeled into the ground at
Sioux City, Iowa, signaled he was losing control of the airliner,
officials say.
   Authorities said the hydraulic failure in the spectacular crash
Wednesday may have been triggered by an uncontained engine failure,
which would mean that engine parts shot out, possibly into the
fuselage.
   Officials in Sioux City initially estimated that 185 to 195 of
the 293 people aboard Flight 232 were killed, but officials later
said they did not have a reliable estimate.
   ``The pilot reported the loss of all of his hydraulic system,
which made it very, very difficult to control that aircraft,'' said
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman John Leyden. ``We know he
had a real problem bringing the aircraft down and lining it up with
the runway.''
   Leyden said the plane's wheels were down but little else is known
about the amount of control the pilot had in the final minutes after
he warned passengers to prepare for a crash landing.
   ``We can't speculate on exactly how much control he had or what
happened up there. All we know is he had a very, very difficult time
controlling the aircraft,'' said Leyden.
   The FAA, the Airline Pilots Association, United Airlines and
manufacturer McDonnell Douglas were all sending teams to assist in
the crash investigation led by the National Transportation Safety
Board.
   Leyden said hydraulic failure would mean a loss of primary
control over nearly every control surface on the wide-bodied,
three-engine airliner.
   A plane's hydraulic system helps push its wheels down, opens and
extends flaps to increase the lift of the wings. It also governs
other control surfaces of the airplane on the wings and tail, and
controls the brakes once the plane is on the ground.
   Failure of the system does not necessarily mean the pilot has no
control, but it could make it more difficult to stabilize the
aircraft, particularly in landing.
   Even with a hydraulic failure, backup mechanical systems could
have allowed some control over wheels, flaps and other surfaces that
control flight and landing, Leyden said. But he and other aviation
experts said manual control can be difficult.
   Some aviation experts said they doubted the complete system could
have gone out.
   ``I think we can say that we have a flight control problem, but
we did not have an airplane that was totally out of hydraulics, or
he wouldn't have been flying at all,'' said John Nance, a pilot and
aviation writer, in Seattle.
   Arthur Wolk, an aviation attorney and licensed transport jet
pilot in Philadelphia, said complete hydraulic failure on a DC-10
should be impossible because of required backup systems.
   Investigators cited partial hydraulic failure as contributing to
a May 1979 crash of a DC-10 that killed 273 people seconds after
takeoff from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The engine on
that plane tore off and somersaulted over the wing, doing extensive
damage to hydraulic fluid lines and electrical cables.
   Loss of hydraulics also was a factor in a 1974 crash of a Turkish
DC-10 in Paris that killed 346 people. A buckling of the floor
caused by decompression when a cargo door blew off severed hydraulic
lines. After that, the control lines in DC-10s were rerouted along
the ceiling.

   Organization of American States foreign
ministers tentatively agreed to grant OAS mediators an additional
month to help promote a solution to the political crisis in Panama
but deferred until Thursday a decision on other key aspects of a
formal declaration.
   The deliberations adjourned at 1:02 a.m. EDT Thursday after
negotiations that began Wednesday morning at the Colombian Embassy.
   A draft proposal calls for a transfer of power in Panama on Sept.
1, 1989, and the holding of free elections in the briefest period
possible. These steps are to be carried out through ``democratic
means and in conformity with existing internal Panamanian
procedures.''
   U.S. and Panamanian opposition representatives attending the
meeting expressed disappointment with the proposal, contending that
it could be interpreted by Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
to his advantage.
   Their comments indicated that efforts to toughen the language
would be made at the Thursday session to bring additional pressure
to bear on Noriega.
   Addressing the meeting at OAS headquarters in early evening, U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger issued a forceful
appeal for decisive OAS action to ensure the restoration of
democratic rule in Panama.
   ``It is time to end the crisis in Panama and the suffering of the
Panamanian people,'' Eagleburger said.
   OAS inaction would invite military leaders elsewhere in the
hemisphere to oust elected governments, he added.
   He said that drug traffickers also would be encouraged if the OAS
refuses to meet the challenge in Panama.
   Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez, a member of the
mediating team, said he believes two months of efforts by him and
his colleagues have raised the possibility of a ``national accord''
leading to a restoration of democratic rule in Panama.
   He said the basis for his hope was the contacts in recent days
between government and opposition leaders in Panama aimed at
reaching a solution.
   Cordovez was cautiously optimistic about the prospects for a
democratic outcome by Sept. 1. According to Panama's constitution, a
new president must be sworn in by that date.
   The possibility of a national accord was alluded to in a report
the mediators submitted to the meeting Wednesday, the deadline for
the mediation team.
   Some delegates felt that the discussions in Panama could lead to
a government of national reconciliation and most foreign ministers
felt there was no alterative but to extend the deadline.
   Delegates were expected to extend the mandate of the mediating
team until late August but there was disagreement over the precise
date and other aspects of the final declaration.
   Opposition leaders in Panama said Wednesday they would not agree
to any such proposal for a government of national reconciliation.
   ``We are not going to betray the Panamanian people. We are not
going to accept that junta even if they give it the name of National
Reconstruction,'' said Guillermo Endara, the opposition presidential
candidate in May 7 elections.
   Intense give-and-take behind closed doors delayed the official
opening of Wednesday's meeting by about four hours. After a public
session lasting less than an hour, the meeting was recessed as
delegates continued behind-the-scenes efforts to reach a compromise
on the wording of an official declaration.
   The crisis was precipitated by the decision of Panama's electoral
authorities to annul the outcome of presidential elections May 7.
   Independent observers said the candidate opposed to Noriega, the
head of the Defense Forces, had won a landslide victory.
   The OAS on May 17 appointed its mediating team to promote a
democratic ``transfer of power'' in Panama. It also blamed Noriega
for the ``grave events'' that occurred in connection with the
elections _ a reference to bloody attacks on opposition candidates
by government security forces.
   There was strong sentiment in the OAS, particularly among some
South American governments, not to bring too much pressure to bear
on Panama.
   The OAS charter forbids interference in the internal affairs of
member countries.
   But the Bush administration, which has been a strong advocate of
using maximum pressure to force Noriega out, has been saying the
charter also lists democracy as the system of government that all
member states should adhere to.
   U.S. opposition to Noriega also was based on drug smuggling
indictments handed down last year against him by two Florida grand
juries.
   U.S. officials also argued that OAS credibility in the hemisphere
could be preserved only by a strong stand against Noriega.
   Opposition to Noriega led the U.S. Senate to state Wednesday, in
a provision added to a State Department bill, that it would not
accept any nominee for administrator of the Panama Canal selected by
him.
   The treaty under which the United States will turn over the canal
to Panama calls for a Panamanian administrator acceptable to the
White House to be appointed next year by Panama and confirmed by the
Senate.

   The Santiaguito volcano spewed red-hot lava
and a 15,000-foot column of ash and steam, a seismology official
said.
   A resident of the city of Coatepeque, 25 miles south of the
volcano, said ash fell on the city when the volcano erupted
Wednesday and lava could be seen glowing on the mountain after dark.
   Eddy Sanchez, assistant director of the seismology station in
Guatemala City, said Santiaguito, 140 miles west of the capital, is
constantly active but Wednesday's eruption was unusual.
   The National Emergency Committee and authorities in Coatepeque
said they were on alert. If the activity continues, coffee and other
fields in the western provinces of Quezaltenango, San Marcos and
Retalhuleu could be affected, emergency officials said.
   Santiaguito is considered a second crater of the adjacent
12,447-foot Santa Maria volcano.
   The town of El Palmar was moved from the slopes of the volcano in
1988 after lava flows formed dams above it. The dams broke, causing
mudslides that nearly destroyed El Palmar.

   Ringers are sounding everywhere in this
picturesque northern Black Hills town where the 1989 World Horseshoe
Tournament is being held.
   Iron clangs morning till evening as almost 1,500 people from the
United States and Canada compete in the pastime that's enjoying new
popularity because President Bush enjoys it and even plays at the
White House.
   Horseshoe contestants sporting colorful, lettered shirts similar
to those bowlers wear are everywhere in this town of about 5,000
people. Motels are full, and many players and their families are
staying in cities as far as 40 miles away.
   The two-week tournament features $73,450 in prize money.
   ``It's an old-timers' sport that's having a new revival,'' said
Bob Champion, publicist for the National Horseshoe Pitchers
Association.
   The 16,000-member group has grown considerably in the past few
years, he said.
   ``There's a pitcher in every town someplace,'' Champion said.
``Anybody can get into it regardless of how old you are.''
   Horseshoe pitching originated with soldiers in ancient Greece who
used discarded horseshoes for sport, imitating discus throwing at
the Olympian Games; more than 30 million people now pitch horseshoes
in tournaments or in city parks and backyards, according to the
organization.
   Although the average age of horseshoe pitchers is about 45,
entrants in the tourney range from 7 to 88, said Gene Ficek, a
Spearfish resident and horseshoe player who helped organize the
event.
   The sport is relaxing and tosses together a good mix of
camaraderie and competition, Ficek said. But he said horseshoe
pitching at the tournament level can be physically grueling.
   ``In a tournament, you'll probably walk 2{ miles and throw a ton
of iron,'' Ficek said.
   Horseshoes weigh either 2 pounds, 8 ounces or 2 pounds, 10
ounces, Ficek said. They are tossed 40 feet by men and 30 feet by
women and those under 17.
   Ficek's wife, Yvonne, who also throws horseshoes, said the
competition sometimes gets tense. ``Especially if you need that last
ringer to win and they keep topping every horseshoe you put on the
stake,'' Mrs. Ficek said.
   A ringer, when the points of a horseshoe encircle a steel stake
in a clay or sand pit, counts as 3 points. One point is awarded when
a horseshoe lands within 6 inches of the stake.
   Two people compete in a game by throwing two horseshoes each to
the other end of the court. They then walk to the stake and tally
points before repeating throws to the opposite pit. The first to get
40 points is the winner.
   Ted Traversie, 70, said he took up the sport 15 years ago when
his doctor urged him to get some exercise. He said he practices
three hours daily.
   ``You can't teach nobody how to throw a horseshoe,'' Traversie
said. ``It has to feel natural to you.
   Traversie said he was disappointed that Bush, who was invited to
attend the championship event, couldn't make it.
   ``He should have at least showed up and throwed a couple of
shoes,'' Traversie said.

   Sioux City is a sprawling commercial
center with 82,000 residents and is best known for its meatpacking
industry and two sisters who give advice to millions of newspaper
readers.
   The city is in northwest Iowa on the east bank of a giant bend in
the Missouri River, at a spot where the Lewis and Clark expedition
stopped in 1804.
   Sioux Gateway Airport is used by five commercial airlines,
including United. It has about 22 arrivals a day, mostly 737s and
727s, but DC-10s have landed there.
   Two of the city's most famous natives are twins Esther Pauline
and Pauline Esther Friedman, who grew up to write the Ann Landers
and Dear Abby columns.
   Meatpacking giant IBP and John Morrell and Co. each operate large
meatpacking operations in the city, as do 10 smaller packing
operations.
   The city is part of Iowa's 6th congressional district,
represented by Fred Grandy, a Sioux City native who starred as
Gopher in ``The Love Boat'' television series.
   The only fatality of Lewis and Clark's expedition to scout the
Louisiana Purchase occurred while it was camped on the river _ just
across from what is now Nebraska. Sergeant Floyd's grave is marked
by a monument overlooking the Missouri.
   The last fatal plane crash at Sioux City occurred in May 1987,
when three people died in a light plane.

<HEAD>Lucas Could Face More Questions on Civil Rights Nomination</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Should stand</HEAD>

   William Lucas could face more grilling on his
nomination to be the nation's civil rights chief as the Senate
Judiciary Committee seeks to resolve questions about his fitness for
the job.
   ``There are a lot of charges against him. We need to get to the
bottom of them,'' Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said Wednesday after
Lucas was questioned for more than three hours about his views, his
qualifications and his character.
   Lucas defended both his commitment to the drive against
discrimination and his actions when customs inspectors found $8,800
worth of undeclared goods in his luggage.
   Afterward, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who chaired the proceeding,
said members reserved the right to recall him for more questioning.
   Heflin told reporters Lucas should be questioned again about a
number of issues, including the fact that the black Republican from
Michigan made misstatements on a sworn application to be admitted to
the New York bar in 1981.
   Lucas did not disclose on the form that he had once failed the
District of Columbia bar examination when asked if he had taken the
test in other states.
   Lucas testified that when he filled out the 1981 form he
interpreted the question to pertain only to any previous
applications to the New York bar. ``There was no intent to
mislead,'' he said.
   Several Democrats on the panel questioned whether Lucas, a
lifelong Democrat who became a Republican in 1985, had the legal
credentials and commitment to assistant attorney general for civil
rights.
   ``It remains to be seen whether Mr. Lucas is the right man for
this important job,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``If a case is brought to me involving a cross burning on the
lawn of a citizen, believe me, this is not just cold facts to me,''
said Lucas, 61, who was sheriff and later chief executive of Wayne
County, Mich., which includes Detroit.
   ``I have been there. I have smelled the smoke,'' Lucas said.
   Lucas defended a series of recent Supreme Court decisions that
civil rights lawyers say will make it harder to win discrimination
cases in federal courts.
   Lucas, echoing a pledge by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, said
he would monitor the impact of those decisions on discrimination
suits and push for legislation if the rulings thwart civil rights
enforcement.
   But Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he was troubled by
Lucas' defense of the recent high court rulings, adding, ``I've been
around long enough to know time slips away.''
   Metzenbaum also questioned Lucas about why he was fined $594 by
the U.S. Customs Service in 1985 for failing to declare $8,884 worth
of merchandise the Lucas family brought back from a trip to the Far
East.
   ``How do you explain concealing receipts and merchandise from the
customs inspectors?'' Metzenbaum said, reading from an April 24,
1985, report of the incident at the Seattle airport.
   The report said ``there was a deliberate effort by all (family)
members to conceal goods and receipts.''
   Lucas explained that customs agents found several pieces of
undeclared jewelry in a cosmetics case carried by one of his
daughters who accompanied him on the business trip to South Korea
and Japan.
   Lucas said he reported $4,800 worth of merchandise, relying on
what his wife and two daughters told him they had bought.
   ``I reported exactly what I was advised of. I did not personally
examine any of these things,'' Lucas said.
   Lucas said he discussed the incident with FBI agents who
investigated his background before his nomination by President Bush
as well as with committee staff members.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel called the customs
violation ``pretty minor-league stuff.''
   ``Our feeling is that he had a very strong appearance today,
answered any and all questions put before him by the committee,''
Runkel said. ``We are ever more confident that he'll be confirmed.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, calling Lucas ``a take-charge guy who
gets things done, who does what's right,'' vowed to fight hard for
his Senate confirmation.

<HEAD>Plastic Foam Bans: Is Government Missing the Point?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the tiniest city council chambers to the
meeting rooms of Congress, elected officials around the nation have
discovered a threat to the environment in front of their very noses:
coffee cups.
   Not just any coffee cups, but those made of plastic foam, the
stuff that keeps hot things hot and cold things cold and protects
those billions of McDonald's hamburgers.
   Increasingly, local governments are banning the use of such
products on grounds that they contribute to the nation's overflowing
garbage crisis and contain chemicals that harm the Earth's ozone
layer.
   Such bans are easy and politically popular. Some experts say they
also may be misguided and pointless.
   The concern for the ozone layer is now largely moot. In a quiet
revolution that has taken place during the past 15 months, the
plastics industry has phased out most of the ozone-depleting
chlorofluorocarbons that were used to manufacture plastic foam.
   The other concern _ landfill _ comes closer to the target. But
environmentalists and plastics industry officials argue it's
pointless to ban plastic foam products when they are usually
replaced by cardboard or plastic-coated paper.
   ``Neither are being recycled and both are going to take up the
same amount of space in landfill,'' said Jeanne Wirka, a spokeswoman
for the Washington-based Environmental Action Foundation. ``The
problem is really a trend toward disposability.''
   More than a dozen cities and counties have enacted bans on the
use of disposable foam products made of polystyrene, a tough,
flexible plastic. In Congress, a bipartisan group of House members
has asked for the removal of polystyrene cups from the congressional
restaurant system.
   Private companies are getting into the act, too. Pacific
Telephone recently banned use of plastic foam in its company
cafeterias, and the Yosemite Park and Curry Co., the private
concessionaire at Yosemite National Park, decided last year to phase
out plastic foam containers.
   The severity of the bans varies widely. Tempe, Ariz., banned the
use of foam cups and plates in city offices only, while Suffolk
County, N.Y., ordered stores throughout the county to stop selling
food in polystyrene or polyvinyl containers. That ban has been held
up by a court challenge.
   In one of the most comprehensive ordinances, the city councils of
Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., voted earlier this year to ban
non-degradable, non-returnable, non-recyclable packaging.
   In the latest action, the Irvine, Calif., city council voted
Tuesday to ban use of all plastic foam made with chlorofluorocarbons
_ CFCs _ as part of a larger ordinance to halt all use of the
ozone-depleting chemical.
   Two years ago, a ban like Irvine's would have had a dramatic
impact. But because of changes in technology, the plastics portion
of the ordinance is likely to go unnoticed by food buyers.
   Under pressure from government and environmentalists, the
plastics industry began producing a new type of plastic foam in
April 1988 made with a modified version of CFCs. Most of the new gas
breaks down in the lower atmosphere, sparing the ozone layer in the
upper atmosphere from about 95 percent of the damage wreaked by CFCs.
   By the end of this year, all plastic foam food service products
such as plates, cups, and egg cartons should be made entirely
without ozone-damaging CFCs, according to spokeswoman Nancy Sherman
of the Foodservice and Packaging Institute.
   The transformation earned plaudits from the federal government
and grudging support from environmental groups. But the debate over
disposal continues.
   A plastic cup may have a useful life of five minutes, but some
scientists believe it could take as long as 500 years to decompose.
   Recent research, however, has shown that while plastic takes
longer to degrade, paper lasts so long in landfill that the
distinction is meaningless.
   One solution is recycling, which the plastics industry insists is
its goal. Seven plastics manufacturers announced recently a $14
million program aimed at recycling 25 percent of all disposable
polystyrene products by 1995.
   McDonald's has begun experimental recycling programs at
restaurants in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and in
Portland, Ore. An initial evaluation of the Portland program
indicated it was effective.
   ``We want to eliminate what goes into the solid waste stream, and
not just substitute one substance with another,'' said McDonald's
spokeswoman Linda Fontana.
   These projects encourage some environmentalists. ``To the degree
that we can turn Styrofoam into a truly recyclable material ... I
think that will largely alleviate, in my mind, the concerns
associated with plastic,'' said Richard Denison, a senior scientist
with the Environmental Defense Fund.

<HEAD>US Farmers Get $3.8 Billion in 1988 Drought Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In New Jersey, 905 farmers collected federal
1988 drought benefits totaling more than $17.1 million, an average
of about $18,925 each.
   Eight farmers in Arizona got $132,836 from the Agriculture
Department under last year's drought aid program, an average of
about $16,600 apiece.
   Most payments, however, averaged far less than those examples,
according to financial reports released by the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Nationally, a routine ASCS report showed recently, approximately
$3.78 billion was paid to 789,707 farmers under the Disaster
Assistance Act of 1988. Payments by state were listed but the
numbers of farmers in each state were not.
   The agency provided supplemental information, including a
breakdown of the number of farmers by state, at the request of The
Associated Press. A sampling of state averages, including the top
five states, was computed by the AP.
   Karen Kostoff of the agency's information resources management
division said Wednesday the numbers of farmers listed by state would
not add up to the national total.
   That is because if a farmer has property in two states, for
example, each will show up in the state figures, she said.
Nationally, however, the farms under the same ownership are counted
as a single unit.
   Most of the producers nationally _ 709,222 as of June 30 _
benefited because of crop losses due to last year's drought, with
some also collecting under other provisions of the program, such as
livestock feed benefits.
   The national figures showed that more than $3.3 billion of the
$3.78 billion paid out so far was for crop losses.
   On an overall basis of total benefits, North Dakota led the
nation with about $407 million received by 49,144 farmers, an
average of $8,280 each.
   Wisconsin was second with nearly $396 million going to 52,285
producers who averaged $7,490 each.
   Third was Illinois where 98,775 farmers averaged $3,830 each for
a total of $378.8 million.
   Iowa was fourth overall at $326.5 million, an average of $4,520
to each of 72,169 farmers.
   Minnesota was fifth with more than $311 million, averaging $5,450
among 57,083 recipients.
   In all, farmers in the five states collected about $1.82 billion
under the 1988 drought program, accounting for 48 percent of the
total.
   The state with the smallest number of drought aid recipients was
Alaska, where the report showed one farmer collecting $6,640 from
the government. Rhode Island showed two farmers, but they got only
$4,282, an average of $2,141.
   California, traditionally the leader in terms of agricultural
sales value, got about $20.8 million in drought assistance, an
average of $7,260 among 2,864 farmers.
   In some of the smaller eastern states, where farms often produce
high-value specialty crops, the averages were relatively high. In
Connecticut, for example, 58 farmers averaged $11,453 each for a
total of $664,300.
   Kansas, where winter wheat farmers suffered greatly this year as
the 1988 drought lingered, got $61.4 million in aid, an average of
$1,740 for each of the 35,255 farmers who got benefits.
   Here are the 1988 drought payments as of June 30, by state, as
reported by the department's Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service. State payment averages, however, were not
included.
   The first column of figures is the number of producers for each
state. The second column, rounded in thousands of dollars, is the
total amount paid. Hawaii was omitted by the agency.

   The Freedom of Information Act gives foreign
competitors ``unique access'' to U.S. technology, and an Energy
Department official suggests restrictions might be needed to stem
the flow.
   ``The government's role is to make sure that U.S. industry has
the initial opportunity to develop U.S.-sponsored'' research,
Richard H. Williamson, deputy assistant energy secretary for
international affairs, said Wednesday.
   ``The Freedom of Information Act ... has granted foreigners
unique access to our technology,'' he said.
   Williamson and Kenneth S. Pedersen of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration told the House subcommittee on
international scientific cooperation they support restricting the
FOI law to limit foreign access to information where it could hurt
U.S. competitiveness.
   The panel was considering how foreign access to U.S. science and
technology compares to U.S. access to foreign technology.
   Pedersen and Williamson conceded that providing exemptions would
be difficult.
   ``It is an effort to balance two very important objectives,''
Pedersen said.
   NASA, he said, wants to continue to provide access without giving
foreign competitors an edge. He proposed giving certain technology
to U.S. industry for a specified time before making it available for
general release.
   ``We aren't looking for an open-ended authority,'' Pedersen said.
``We're trying to get a door on the barn before too many horses
leave.''
   George P. Millburn of the Defense Department, which already has
some FOI exemptions, told the subcommittee the Pentagon supports the
NASA and DOE requests.
   Deputy Secretary of Commerce Thomas Murrin said the United States
wants to ``support, foster and encourage'' the exchange of
scientific and technological information.
   But he and others testified that the United States is often
shortchanged in such exchanges.
   ``Many of our scientists and engineers are still subject to what
is known as the `Not Invented Here Syndrome,' which makes those
afflicted by it undervalue the importance of research performed

   ``The Japanese, on the other hand, eagerly seek new scientific
and technological knowledge from any source,'' he said.

   The nation's worst aviation disaster occurred 10
years ago when an American Airlines DC-10 crashed on takeoff from
O'Hare International Airport.
   On May 25, 1979, Flight 191 lost an engine, banked sideways out
of control and slammed into a field, exploding into an inferno. The
furrow plowed in the field by the jetliner's left wing is still
visible.
   The jetliner was reduced to scattered debris. All 258 passengers
and 13 crew members were killed, as were two people on the ground.
   ``To this day, it's something that's hard to comprehend, how a
big plane like that could disintegrate into little pieces,'' said
Ray Devito of Mokena, who had driven his girlfriend to airport to
catch the ill-fated Los Angeles-bound flight.
   Wednesday's crash in Sioux City, Iowa, is the first major
domestic accident involving a DC-10 since the Chicago disaster a
decade ago.
   The National Transportation Safety Board laid the primary blame
for the 1979 crash on the airline, citing ``maintenance-induced
damage'' _ a 10-inch crack in the engine mount _ that caused the
left engine to tear loose. It also criticized McDonnell Douglas'
design as vulnerable to maintenance damage.
   The NTSB also said the Federal Aviation Administration had been
remiss by not learning that a similar crack had recently been
repaired in a Continental Airlines DC-10.
   Since the accident, the FAA has been ``very specific about what
has to be reported to us and what doesn't,'' spokesman Fred Farrar
said last spring.
   Elaine Bendell, a spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas in Long
Beach, Calif., said the only change made in the DC-10 pylon design
was a shift to flathead rather than raised-head bolts.

   A House chairman wants Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to authorize independent tests of special switches used to
detonate U.S. missiles following reports that the manufacturer
failed to test the product.
   In a letter to Cheney released Wednesday, Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., said the company also worked on the switches with equipment
``which had not been inspected, calibrated or tested for conformance
with accepted criteria for up to seven years.''
   Dingell cited the findings of the Defense Criminal Investigative
Service which investigated printed wiring boards, also known as
stator switches, manufactured by Asher Engineering.
   The service found that from 1982 to the present the switches were
not tested in accordance with military guidelines and failed to meet
specifications, Dingell said in the letter.
   The subcontract awarded to Asher Engineering was for production
of stator switches for the Phoenix, AAMRAM, Standard, Sidewinder,
Sparrow, Maverick, Harpoon and Harm missile systems.
   ``Without working stator switches, these missiles will not
detonate,'' Dingell said.
   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
oversight and investigations called on Cheney to authorize spending
for independent tests of the switches.
   ``The subcommittee is concerned that the devastating impact of
not continuing to use Asher stator switches and the possible recall
of seven years worth of missile production will create tremendous
pressure within the system to use the substandard or defective
components,'' Dingell said.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Asher Engineering in
Baldwin Park, Calif., said no one at the company could comment on
the letter.
   The Pentagon's deputy assistant inspector general, in an memo
April 20, said the untested switches ``could present a serious
hazard to both the missile system and to national security if found
to be faulty.''
   In the memo, Daniel R. Foley also said investigators haven't
determined whether the switches were used on other weapons systems.
   The Navy Avionics Center performed a quick audit of Asher in May
1989 and concluded ``it is evident from the samples that the
manufacturer used different processes on the same type boards and
had poor process controls.''
   The Navy's director of reliability, maintainability and quality
assurance, in a July 10, 1989, memo, said, ``there is not sufficient
technical justification for using these circuit assemblies in such a
critical application.''

   A U.S. Navy pilot was killed when the
jet fighter he was flying crashed into a mountain during a training
flight out of Subic Naval Base, the Navy said today.
   A statement identified the pilot as Lt. j.g. Richard E.
Armbruster, 28, a native of Cedar City, Utah, and veteran of the
1983 invasion of the Caribbean island nation of Grenada.
   The statement said search teams found the wreckage of
Armbruster's A-4E Skyhawk aircraft on Wednesday, one day after it
failed to return to Subic's Cubi Point Naval Air Station.
   Cause of the crash has not been determined, the statement said.
   Armbruster was U.S. Army Cobra helicopter pilot decorated for
flying missions during the Grenada invasion. He later transferred to
the U.S. Navy, the statement said.
   A memorial service was scheduled to be held on the base on
Friday, the statement said. Armbruster is survived by his wife,
Sandra.

<TEXT>
   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce will
testify at least twice more before a congressional panel
investigating scandals in programs under his stewardship at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee, said
Wednesday that Pierce will return in the fall to discuss
contradictions between his earlier testimony and witnesses'
statements that he was directly involved in approving questionable
HUD projects.
   Pierce had already agreed to return to the House Government
Operations employment and housing subcommittee Aug. 3 to answer
questions about a $15 million North Carolina project headed by a
former law partner of Pierce's.
   Pierce told congressional investigators in May he was not
directly involved in funding decisions in many of HUD's programs
which have been criticized for alleged influence-peddling and
mismanagement during his eight-year tenure.
   But Shirley McVay Wiseman, former assistant for housing,
testified Friday that Pierce personally ordered her to approve
funding for the project in Durham, N.C.
   Lantos said staff members for the panel met with Pierce on
Wednesday.
   ``There was no discussion with respect to the substance of his
statements,'' Lantos said. ``That would have been inappropriate.''
   ``It was a relaxed, lengthy, cordial and productive meeting,'' he
said.
   Lantos said the panel's questions next month would be limited to
Pierce's role in funding the North Carolina project to convert a
defunct hosiery mill to housing for the elderly. The project was
pushed by a former Pierce law partner.
   HUD staff members had opposed government funding because the
project was too expensive and its location on top of a toxic waste
site made it environmentally unsafe.
   Because of HUD's approval, developers received more than $11.3
million in rent subsidies, a $2.3 million Urban Development Action
Grant and more than $3 million in tax credits.
   Pierce also agreed to return to discuss ``a range of issues'' in
September or October, said Lantos.
   The chairman said he could not predict when the panel's
investigation would end, only that it was certain to continue into
the fall.
   ``The HUD crisis is an ocean without a shore,'' said Lantos.

   A retired pilot who investigated the downing of
Korean Air Lines Flight 007 says the crew of the ill-fated flight
radioed false position reports as he 1,500 miles into Soviet
airspace before being shot down.
   Frank Houston of Seattle told a disbelieving KAL attorney
Wednesday that a crew member probably misprogrammed one of the three
computerized navigation systems aboard the jet before the Boeing 747
took off from Anchorage, Alaska.
   The pilot, copilot and flight engineer ignored numerous other
plane instruments and navigational aids on the ground as they flew
300 miles off their assigned course, Houston testified in the second
day of the civil trial.
   ``All three of them disregarded all those instruments?'' asked
Marshall Turner, an attorney representing the airline.
   ``That's about what I'm telling you, yes,'' replied Houston, who
worked with an international team that investigated the Sept. 1,
1983 shootdown that killed all 269 people aboard.
   The families of the passengers are trying to prove willful
misconduct by KAL, alleging the plane's crew knowingly continued off
course because they would have had to turn back and face
disciplinary action to correct the problem.
   Turner, noting improperly set instruments would have told the
crew they were 300 miles from the airport while they were still on
the ground, asked whether the crew then reported false position
reports during the flight.
   ``I am sure of it,'' replied Houston.
   Turner then asked the question that has been central to the
Flight 007 mystery since a Soviet fighter jet shot the plane out of
the night sky: Why didn't the crew merely turn left and get out of
Soviet territory?
   ``That's what boggles our mind, why didn't they?'' said Houston.
   Turner said Houston's conclusion that plane spent its last three
hours in Soviet territory ``sheer speculation.''
   But the available radar data for the initial part of the flight
and information provided by the Soviets and Japanese governments
shows ``that airplane was well right of course,'' said Houston.
``There is mountains of evidence and it's irrefutable.''
   The crew thought they could ``sneak through Russia?'' asked U.S.
District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson.
   Houston said the pilot probably concluded, ``I think I'll take a
shot at it.''
   The pilot may have believed he could ``get away with it, and he
damn near did,'' said Houston.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who won a Nevada beauty contest
lost her court bid to compete in the Miss Teen USA pageant after she
was disqualified for competing in two states.
   U.S. District Court Judge Roger Foley said Wednesday that Miss
Nevada Teen, Heather Anne McLeod, should have realized that
competing in preliminary teen pageants in Nevada and California
could disqualify her.
   ``She should have known the rules,'' Foley said.
   The 5-foot-8 green-eyed blonde said she was disappointed but glad
to have had her day in court, which was attended by about 10 high
school-age boys.
   ``I respect the judge's decision and we knew it was a gamble from
the beginning,'' Miss McLeod said. ``You win some, you lose some.
Life goes on.
   ``I just hope this doesn't happen to another girl because the
rules just aren't clear. I was doing everything honestly.''
   She and her attorneys haven't decided yet whether to pursue
$200,000 in damages against Miss Universe Inc.
   Miss McLeod, 18, who lives in Reno with her parents but had
attended college in California, contended she didn't have a copy of
the rules forbidding competing in two state contests the same year.
   She also said she was encouraged by operators of both state
pageants, owned by Miss Universe Inc., to enter. Affidavits from the
operators show they did encourage her to compete and weren't aware
she could be disqualified.
   Stacey Bentley, 18, of Las Vegas, who was the first runner-up in
the Miss Nevada Teen contest, will continue to represent Nevada in
the national pageant in San Bernardino, Calif. The finals are
Tuesday.
   Following an anonymous telephone tip, Miss McLeod was
disqualified from the Miss Teen USA pageant June 30, eight days
after winning the Nevada pageant in Las Vegas. She lost the
California contest in April.
   No testimony was allowed in the case, but Miss McLeod said in an
affidavit she didn't understand that competing in two states was
prohbitited.
   She said the California pageant application didn't bar competing
in more than one state and the Nevada application was vague, just
asking whether she had participated in another state contest.
   Her attorney, Carvel Sims of Baton Rouge, La., said Miss McLeod
never said she was a current resident of California, but only that
she had attended the University of California at San Diego.
   Sims said Miss McLeod moved to Reno with her family in August
1988 when she was still 17 and considers Nevada her home state.
   The judge agreed with Kristina Pickering, the attorney for Miss
Universe Inc., who argued it was apparent from the applications that
Miss McLeod knew she must be a resident of each state to compete.
   ``She wrote her own ticket into this mess and now she's asking
this court to bail her out,'' Ms. Pickering said.

   Children await her with bunches of
flowers. Crowds follow her slavishly, shout her name and seek
handshakes. Scores of undercover police officers trail her
protectively as she traverses the campaign trail.
   Takako Doi, the charismatic leader of Japan's once lightly
regarded Socialists, is getting something that few politicians from
her party have had: superstar treatment.
   ``To be honest, I never imagined she would become this popular
three years ago,'' said Sukio Iwatare, a party official and veteran
lawmaker, as Ms. Doi spoke Wednesday to a crowd in Kohriyama in the
northern Fukushima prefecture.
   ``I think it is nothing but her lovable personality that led to
this Doi fever. It is amazing that she can easily draw thousands of
people everywhere she goes.''
   Pollsters and analysts say a new sales tax and an
influence-peddling scandal have turned voters against the Liberal
Democratic Party, the conservative group that has dominated Japanese
politicans for 34 years.
   Women's groups also have criticized new Prime Minister Sousuke
Uno after allegations surfaced that he kept paid mistresses.
   Ms. Doi's popularity is expected to make the Socialists the main
beneficiaries of voters' ire in Sunday's elections for half the 252
seats in the upper house of Parliament.
   Her party, the largest opposition group in Parliament, hopes to
increase its representation in the chamber from 43 to at least 65.
Pollsters say the Liberal Democrats likely will fall from 142 seats
to fewer than 120.
   Three years ago, Ms. Doi became the first woman to head a major
Japanese political party. Her predecessor had resigned over the
labor-backed party's defeat in Japan's last national elections.
   Since then, the 61-year-old Ms. Doi has moved the party away from
doctrinaire leftist ideas.
   On Wednesday, about 3,000 people packed the parking lots in front
of Kohriyama's railway station as Ms. Doi campaigned for the party's
local candidate. Some watched from balconies of nearby department
stores.
   ``It is time to bring changes in politics,'' Ms. Doi called out
from the top of a campaign truck.
   After a pause for cheers, she added: ``Give us a chance to run
the government. We can do it. We can make tomorrow's Japan better
together.''
   The candidate, Choei Aita, a 60-year-old former labor union
official challenging two ruling party incumbents, said Ms. Doi
``talks about specific policies but she makes it so easy to
understand for ordinary people.''
   He added that her speech gave him ``a very good feeling'' about
winning Sunday.
   If the opposition were to win control of Parliament's more
powerful lower house, in elections that don't have to be held before
next year, Ms. Doi could become Japan's first woman prime minister.
   ``Though there are many more hurdles to be cleared, the
opposition camp never had such a golden opportunity to take over the
government before,'' said Takayoshi Miyagawa, president and noted
political analyst at Seiji Koho Center, a prominent research firm.
   ``And if the opposition actually takes over the government, the
head of the largest party in the opposition camp would naturally
become prime minister,'' he added.
   The opposition, however, has been criticized for concentrating on
criticism rather than presenting alternative policy proposals.
   Doi emphasizes that her party would not bring make drastic
changes if it gained power.
   ``Continuity is important in politics,'' she told a news
conference after her speech. ``It is wrong to think we were trying
to bring drastic changes to this country.''
   The Liberal Democrats say the Socialists would take such steps as
scrapping the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Ms. Doi said her party
would not unilaterally abandon the pact.

<HEAD>EDS: Should stand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee, badly split
by disagreements over catastrophic health insurance and capital
gains, is having no trouble boosting federal aid to low-income
working parents with children.
   A bill whose chief goal is cutting the federal deficit has been
fattened to include $16 billion in direct credits and
state-administered grants to help parents pay expenses of child care.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the committee, hailed
the child care package as ``a giant step forward.'' Noting the Bush
administration disagrees with some of the provisions, he called on
the administration to ``commit itself to its campaign promise and do
something for children.''
   The child care plan was added to the bill on a 26-10 vote
Wednesday after the panel was unable to settle disputes over capital
gains and catastrophic insurance for older Americans.
   Bush has called for a cut in the capital gains tax, which applies
to profits from the sale of stock and other assets, on grounds it
would spur the economy and increase revenues.
   Many Democrats concede a one-year revenue gain but say a cut
would lose revenues after that. Besides, they note, most of the tax
benefits from a reduction in the capital gains tax would go to those
with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   The fight over catastrophic illness also includes an element of
rich-vs.-poor. Higher-income retirees are complaining loudly because
they must pay a larger share of the cost so the benefits can be
available to those with little or no income. Those with higher
incomes want all taxpayers to share the cost of catastrophic
coverage.
   Because of the complaints, Congress members have shown widespread
support for delaying the surtax of up to $800 that the higher-income
retirees must pay. But since members of the Ways and Means Committee
cannot agree on that, the panel may simply decide to repeal the
entire program.
   The split over approving the child care amendments has had a more
partisan tone. All Democrats and three Republicans voted for the
package; seven Republicans, favoring a less costly approach
recommended by Bush, voted no.
   The Ways and Means child care plan, which would take effect in
1991, is closer to a version passed by the Senate than to the
president's proposal. The committee provisions would benefit
families in which both spouses work outside the home as well as
those families in which one spouse stays at home to care for the
children.
   It would expand the existing earned-income credit, which is worth
up to $910 a year in tax cuts _ or in cash if there is no tax
liability _ for working families with children and incomes up to
about $18,000.
   The committee voted to raise the maximum credit to $1,217 for a
family with one child, $1,540 if there are two children, and $1,790
if a family has two or more children. Under current law, the credit
is the same regardless of the number of children.
   The plan would create a new credit for families with one or more
children under age 6. This credit, which would be in addition to the
earned-income credit, would be for 6 percent of the families' first
$6,500 of earned income, with a top credit of $430 in 1991.
   A third part of the committee's package would authorize $1.55
billion worth of federal grants for social services, with 80 percent
of the money earmarked for improving child care services.

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in Tokyo on
Thursday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained
moderately.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 107.70
points, or 0.32 percent, ending the day's trading at 33,664.87. The
index gained 213.44 points on Wednesday.
   The dollar ended trading at 142.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from its
closing the previous day. It opened higher at 142.80 yen and ranged
between 142.05 and 142.90 yen.
   Despite the dollar-buying mood at the market's opening, market
players turned to selling for profit-taking, and the currency
slipped from the opening rate, said a trader with the Bank of Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Many investors, however, were making little moves except for
position adjustments, he added.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly conducted a dollar-selling market
intervention to halt its further rise against the yen. The central
bank does not comment on its monetary actions.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the index's rise followed
gains in the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 major issues in New
York overnight.
   While institutional investors were reluctant to make major moves
ahead of the Japanese parliamentary election Sunday, individuals
actively bought, said one trader with a major securities firm in
Tokyo, speaking anonymously.

   When the pilot of a United Airlines DC-10
told passengers to expect a ``very rough'' landing at Sioux City's
airport, Lori Michaelson held her daughter, Sabrina, tight.
   ``I was just mostly worried about being able to hang on to the
1-year-old,'' she said.
   But Wednesday's deadly crash separated mother from daughter.
   Mrs. Michaelson, a Denver resident, said about an hour from
Flight 232's scheduled arrival in Chicago, the pilot said over the
intercom that the tail of the airplane had been damaged and that an
emergency landing was necessary.
   ``He said we'd have to land and that it would be a rough impact.
He advised us to go into a crash position,'' she said.
   Sabrina was on her lap, and she held her tightly. Nearby was her
husband, Mark, and their two sons, Doug, 6, and Andy, 4.
   ``We're expecting a rough landing. In fact, a very rough
landing,'' the pilot said, according to Michaelson.
   Twenty minutes later, the plane crashed while attempting an
emergency landing at Sioux Gateway Airport.
   Mrs. Michaelson said the airplane flipped when it hit, and she
felt the child sliding to the floor.
   Smoke filled the cabin and when their section of the airplane
came to a rest, the couple and their sons fumbled around until
finding a way out.
   As they climbed outside, Michaelson asked, ``Where's the baby?''
   Desperate, he went back into the wreckage but encountered thick
smoke and was forced to leave.
   Then they saw the child, apparently unharmed, in a woman's arms.
   Asked how she had come to have the child, the woman said some man
had handed her over.
   ``God, I wish he hadn't,'' said Michaelson. ``I'd like to thank
him personally.''

   Claude Ciari, a French native, is campaigning hard
for this weekend's balloting, seeking to become the first Caucasian
elected to Japan's Parliament.
   ``I'm a proud Japanese, and I will do my best to help the
Japanese people uplift their image,'' said Ciari, who came to Japan
in 1967 and married a Japanese woman in 1975.
   Ciari, a candidate in Sunday's parliamentary elections, became a
Japanese citizen a decade later so his two children would be
Japanese nationals.
   ``I'll try hard to defend social justice and protect those who
are less privileged and not part of the Japanese success story,''
Ciari said.
   Koreans naturalized Japanese have been elected to parliament or
state legislatures in past elections but that is a rare occurrence
in this traditionally closed society.
   ``It will be a good chance for the people to show to the world
that they are making themselves international by electing a
French-Japanese,'' said Ciari, a native of Nice.
   Ciari, 45, a successful guitarist, composer, animator and actor,
is running for the 252-seat House of Councillors under the banner of
the New Liberal Club, a small party that broke away from the
governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   Of the 126 seats at stake Sunday, 76 will be decided in electoral
districts and the other 50 according to percentage of the nationwide
vote received by the 40-odd parties entered.
   Ciari is second on the list of 10 New Liberal Club candidates
seeking election under the proportional representation system.
   ``The top candidate, Mr. (Kazuhiko) Takeoka, will be elected if
the party musters about 1 million votes. The borderline for my own
chance will be around 2 million votes. I'm campaigning hard so the
party can win many million (votes),'' Ciari said.
   He has made speeches in fluent Japanese at street corners in
major western Japan cities. He has visited small towns, shaking
hands, smiling and bowing as other candidates do.
   Ciari, who lives in Nishinomiya, a town between Kobe and Osaka,
campaigned in Tokyo on Wednesday.
   He said he chose the New Liberal Club because he foresees the
party taking a key position ``coordinating between the two major
political camps _ the ruling party and the opposition led by the
Socialists.''
   In Sunday's election he expects a considerable gain by the
opposition and a major setback for the Liberal Democrats, who are on
the defensive over an unpopular new sales tax and a widespread
influence-peddling scandal.
   The governing party has 142 seats in the upper house, and 73
members who will remain in office for three more years.
   It needs to win 54 seats on Sunday just for a simple majority of
127 _ a feat many pollsters and analysts say it cannot perform.
   Ciari, a young, penniless musician when he first came to Japan,
became a citizen at a time when children obtained Japanese
nationality only if their fathers were Japanese. A few years ago,
the law was revised to confer citizenship on children with Japanese
mothers.
   The Japanese government asks foreigners applying for citizenship
to submit a new name ``appropriate for a Japanese.'' Ciari
registered his Japanese name in Chinese characters pronounced:
``Kuroudo Chiari.''

<HEAD>House Agrees to Make Federal Facilities Subject to Environmental
Laws</HEAD>

   The federal government would face the same
penalties as private polluters for cleaning up thousands of
hazardous waste sites under legislation headed for the Senate with
overwhelming approval from the House.
   The House, by a 380-39 vote Wednesday, approved the measure
allowing states fine federal agencies that violate environmental
laws.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said the legislation was necessary
``to end the hypocrisy that has taxpayers paying to create federal
pollution.''
   The lopsided House vote improves its chances in the Senate and
demonstrates to top-level decision-makers that lawmakers are
determined to get quick action on the decades-old problem of
government-caused pollution, Eckart said.
   Eckart, the bill's sponsor, and Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, whose
district includes a highly contaminated uranium-processing complex,
led a successful drive to persuade the House not to weaken the
proposal.
   Rep. Richard Ray, D-Ga., wanted to ban state and local
governments from using fines and penalties to force the federal
government to clean up existing sites.
   Ray said the measure as approved would end up diverting limited
funds away from cleanup into state coffers and lawyers' pockets.
   He and others also warned cleanup decisions could be moved out of
the hands of the federal government and into state offices where
parochial interests would outweigh the national interest.
   ``This bill conveys power to the states but not responsibility,''
said Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y.
   The Bush administration opposes the measure on similar grounds.
An administration statement issued this week said the bill would
allow states to fine polluting federal facilities without
considering whether there was money in the budget to do the demanded
cleanups.
   But Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. and chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, said the measure may be the impetus needed
to clean up serious contamination problems at government facilities.
   If the bill puts pressure on the Pentagon and other government
polluters, ``perhaps that is good because the people of this country
want this mess cleaned up,'' he said.
   Eckart said Senate leaders have indicated they'll move on their
version of the bill after the Labor Day recess.
   ``The administration should stop dragging its heels and digging
in and start digging up the pollution they've created all across
this country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Treasury Takes First Step To Avoid Exceeding Debt Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department is moving to avoid
exceeding the national debt limit next month even while urging
Congress to extend the ceiling before lawmakers leave for a
month-long August recess.
   ``It is virtually certain, absent such action, that Treasury will
run out of cash and default on its obligations on Aug. 15,''
Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber told Senate Finance taxation and
debt management subcommittee Wednesday.
   ``I urge you to seek the cooperation of your colleagues and to
act quickly on the debt limit in order to prevent unnecessary
problems in Treasury financing operations and default on the
government's obligations,'' he said.
   The government is seeking a $300 billion increase in the current
$2.8 trillion long-term debt ceiling. Without an increase, Treasury
officials say the government would have problems issuing paychecks
and Social Security payments in September.
   The House already has passed such legislation.
   Shortly before Glauber appeared on Capitol Hill, the Treasury
Department announced it was suspending indefinitely the sale of
special securities for state and local governments. Such action has
been taken before when Congress was unable to agree on legislation
raising the debt limit.
   State and local governments buy the special Treasury securities
as a temporary investment vehicle for money they raise in the bond
market. If the securities are not available, it could force
cancellation of bond sales by state and local governments, leading
to confusion and turmoil in the municipal bond market.
   Glauber did not mention the suspension in his testimony on
Capitol Hill, but he did warn of the other effects of congressional
inaction on the debt limit increase.
   ``Without an increase in the debt limit by Aug. 1, full
investment of the Social Security trust funds may not be possible,''
he said.
   The Treasury is required by law to invest the trust fund assets
in interest-bearing government securities, which are a form of
government debt and are counted with other government bonds and
notes against the debt limit.
   While Congress normally appropriates money to cover any interest
lost to the trust funds during a period when they cannot be
invested, this action has raised complaints from interest groups
representing the elderly.
   Glauber also warned that congressional inaction into September
would prevent the Treasury from paying the government payroll for
September, including payroll and pension checks exceeding $23
billion.

<HEAD>HHS Secretary Takes Back Support for Needle Exchanges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan, backpedaling on his support for local needle-exchange
programs, says there is no valid scientific evidence that such
programs curb the spread of AIDS.
   Sullivan, in testimony to a House subcommittee Wednesday, also
said the Bush administration is ``strongly opposed'' to programs to
give clean needles to drug addicts because they can be viewed as
sanctioning drug abuse.
   However, pressed by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., subcommittee
chairman, the secretary agreed to convene an expert panel to
recommend how such programs could be studied scientifically. He said
the panel could report back to the subcommittee in several weeks.
   Sullivan had said in a March interview with The Associated Press
that he did not believe needle exchanges condone drug abuse and the
federal government would be ``very supportive'' of communities
experimenting with such programs.
   Many experts believe the deadly AIDS virus has been spread
through the population partly by the use of previously-used needles
by drug addicts.
   Sullivan's statements marked the second issue on which he has
backpedaled after straying from the Bush administration line.
Earlier, his statements that he supported the Supreme Court decision
legalizing a woman's right to abortion nearly derailed his
nomination. Later, he said he opposed abortion except in cases of
rape, incest and danger to the mother's life.
   At Wednesday's hearing before the House Energy and Commerce
health subcommittee, he did not answer directly when asked if his
views had changed since March.
   But he said ``what has occurred is that I have had extensive
discussions'' with AIDS and drug abuse experts as well as members of
Congress about the issue.
   Sullivan's earlier statements alarmed some in the Bush
administration, including drug czar William Bennett. At the time,
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ``is opposed to
exchangeable needles under any condition.''
   In March, Sullivan said, ``As someone who is concerned about
health, if this is a strategy that shows promise of helping to
arrest the spread of AIDS, I think this is something that does
deserve a chance for an appropriate trial.''
   However, asked Wednesday if he would support needle exchanges if
they were shown scientifically to be effective, he said he still
would ``want to consult with the other members of the Cabinet,
Bennett and others, to look at this thoroughly.
   ``We want to gather all the information that we can about these
programs, and because of the fact that there has not been evidence,
clear evidence that these programs are effective, we are not
prepared to advocate or come forth with programs,'' he said.
   Sullivan said his department planned no efforts to conduct its
own evaluation of the effect of clean-needle programs, but he said
the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is part of HHS, would
consider applications for research grants for others.
   Needle-exchange programs are underway in several U.S. cities,
including New York; Tacoma, Wash.; and Boulder, Colo. Abroad,
England, Australia, Sweden and the Netherlands have such programs.
   Sullivan said studies evaluating the effectiveness of some of
these programs are ``not convincing'' because none has compared a
group of addicts receiving clean needles with a group that is not.
Also, it is not clear whether findings that show decreased needle
sharing and no increase in drug abuse are resulting from other
factors, he said.

   More than 3,000 gold prospectors have been
stranded for two months in remote western China by blizzards and bad
weather and 67 have died of starvation, exposure or illness, an
official newspaper said today.
   Worker's Daily said 8,000 miners and 1,000 of their vehicles were
trapped by blizzards in May in the Hoh Xil Lake area of Qinghai
province, more than 16,500 feet above sea level.
   Rescue workers have sent in 39 trucks, but 3,000 people remain

into the area two weeks ago after two previous attempts failed
because of bad weather.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's ability to
predict the economic future may still be unproven, but he can read
palms _ at least his own.
   Brady showed up Wednesday at a hearing of the joint economic
committee with the name ``Harry'' plainly written across his left
palm.
   Since there are no Harrys on the committee, observers were left
to wonder, ``Who is Harry?''
   Brady's explanation: Before the committee appearance, he had been
interviewed by Harry Smith for the CBS program, ``This Morning.''
   Since Smith was in New York and Brady was in Washington, he
couldn't see his interviewer and wanted a reminder of who was
questioning him, said Brady spokesman Roger Bolton.
   Brady didn't have a piece of paper with him so he wrote Smith's
name on his palm.
   ``It's easier to wash my hands than buy a new shirt,'' Bolton
quoted Brady as saying.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Foreign Aid Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House plans to vote Friday on a $14.35
billion foreign aid bill that puts $15 million behind President
Bush's promise to encourage economic reform in Hungary and Poland.
   Bush announced the programs last week during visits to Eastern
Europe, pledging a $100 million fund to support private business
initiatives in Poland and $25 million to encourage enterprises in
Hungary.
   The measure, passed by the House Appropriations Committee on
Wednesday, provides economic, military and development aid for
friendly countries around the world. It goes before the full House
on Friday.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the panel's foreign
operations subcommittee, said the $15 million figure was an informal
estimate of the cost of beginning to meet Bush's pledges in fiscal
1990, which begins Oct. 1. The administration has so far made no
formal request to Congress for the aid, he said.
   Of that amount, $10 million is for Poland and $5 million for
Hungary.
   In its report, the Appropriations Committee called Poland's June
elections and other developments encouraging and ``reasons to
believe that real progress can take place and can be sustained over
a period of time.''
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., said Republicans and the Bush
administration will support the foreign aid bill in the House, but
will work in the Senate to shift more money to military aid and make
a series of other changes.
   The bill also included:
   _$160 million for a new Multilateral Assistance Initiative for
the Philippines, $40 million less than the administration has
requested. ``I don't think, given the Philippine track record (of
poor management), we ought to be putting in a dime,'' Obey said. But
he said the $160 million represented a compromise with the
administration, which sees the program as a key to bolstering the
fledgling democracy led by Corazon Aquino.
   _A maximum of $85 million in military aid to the government of El
Salvador. In a gesture of support to newly elected president Alfredo
Cristiani of the right-wing ARENA party, the committee declined to
attach strings to the aid. Some liberal lawmakers had sought to
release the aid in two increments, depending on the new government's
performance in suppressing the activities of right-wing death squads.
   _A total of $410 million for migration and refugee assistance,
$40 million more than the administration asked. The committee noted
increased emigration of Soviet Jews as well as growing refugee needs
in Africa and along the Thai-Cambodian border.
   _$105 million for the African Development Fund, which provides
low-interest loans for development programs in the poorest
countries; $144 million to the African Development Bank, which makes
market-rate loans for agriculture and public works projects; $515
million for development aid to sub-Saharan Africa; and $50 million
in development money for countries bordering South Africa. The bill
also recommends $2 million be set aside for protection of African
elephants.
   _Mild restrictions on the $958 million allocation to the
International Development Association as an indication of
displeasure over loans to China, whose crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators has provoked outrage on Capitol Hill.
   As usual, Israel and Egypt receive the lion's share of U.S. aid
money. Israel would get $3 billion in combined military and economic
aid, and Egypt would receive $2 billion.
   The bill also provides $20 million for a program to promote peace
in Northern Ireland; $230 million in military aid to Pakistan; $12
million for the West Bank and Gaza strip for education, health and
agriculture programs; $270 million as part of various drug control
programs; and $65 million for the United Nations Children's Fund.

   The Senate is demanding increased cooperation
from Mexico in the war on drugs in a move described by opponents as
a direct rebuke to that country's new president, Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
   Senators added the provision Wednesday to a $4.6 billion State
Department authorization bill for next year, along with dabbling in
dozens of other world issues from Fidel Castro's right to hold power
in Cuba to bare grocery shelves in Romania.
   But senators were unable to resolve a dispute over an amendment
proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., barring official U.S. talks
with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization who
have been involved in terrorism against Americans.
   In one provision, senators said they would not accept any nominee
for administrator of the Panama Canal who is selected by Panama's
current ruler, Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   The treaty under which the United States will turn over the canal
to Panama calls for a Panamanian administrator acceptable to the
White House to be appointed next year by Panama and confirmed by the
Senate.
   Helms also sponsored the provision dealing with Mexico, arguing
the United States' southern neighbor remains the primary source of
heroin and marijuana and a leading transit point for U.S.-bound
cocaine.
   Despite anti-drug rhetoric from the Salinas government, Mexico
still has not granted U.S. requests for the right to fly drug
surveillance flights over the country, to pursue drug smugglers into
Mexico, or to grant access to bank records sought by U.S. drug
investigators, said Helms, a perennial critic of Mexico.
   The non-binding amendment expressed the ``sense of Congress''
that Mexico should negotiate with the United States on those and
other drug issues.
   Helms said the amendment was intended to support Salinas'
anti-drug statements and to send ``a signal as to how we will
measure their cooperation next year'' when it comes time to certify
whether Mexico is eligible for continued U.S. trade preferences and
other aid.
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the move would damage U.S.
relations with the new Mexican government, calling it ``a
counterproductive and failed attempt to engage in another round of
Mexico bashing.''
   In a flurry of other foreign-policy pronouncements, the Senate:
   _Approved a provision intended to slow down an emerging
U.S.-Korean deal for co-production of a military fighter plane. The
provision calls for a study on how such a deal would affect U.S.
industrial capacity and long-term competitiveness.
   _Voted 99-0 to call on Cuban President Fidel Castro to hold a
national plebiscite on whether he should continue in power, and if a
majority does not support him, to step down.
   _Approved a provision to rename a small park across the street
from the Chinese Embassy in Washington as ``Tiananmen Square Park''
in honor of pro-democracy demonstrators killed in Beijing's
crackdown last month.
   _Called on the administration to bar the import of Romanian meat
and wine ``until such time as the Romanian government ceases to
withhold food from the Romanian people.''

   A Georgia company claims the pilot who crashed
his private plane into notoriety unlawfully billed the firm twice
for work he did and illegally converted thousands of dollars of
company money to his own use.
   Sonrise Management Services Inc. of Columbus, Ga., filed suit in
U.S. District Court against Thomas Root demanding the return of
$334,000 plus $250,000 in damages.
   Root, a communications lawyer, is accused of failing to represent
investors he was hired to speak for before the Federal
Communications Commission. The suit alleges Root took in an extra
$100,000 through double billing.
   Root is recovering from his plunge into the waters off the
Bahamas last week and the mysterious gunshot wound which he says he
does not remember receiving.
   In its court papers filed this week, Sonrise says it paid Root
$1.9 million since March 1986 as an advance against legal fees and
expenses and to reimburse him for FCC filing and hearing fees.
   Sonrise, which assists investors inexperienced in broadcasting
but with an interest in operating new FM stations to apply for
construction permits, alleges Root failed to adequately represent
nine groups of investors seeking permits.
   Sonrise said that last August it paid Root $75,000 that he was to
give to applicants for an FM station in Omega, Ga. Sonrise charges
the applicants never got the money and Root converted the funds to
his own use.
   Last November, said Sonrise, it paid Root $40,000 to hold in an
escrow account to buy the construction permit of an FM station in
Galva, Ill. The agreement was never executed and Root converted the
money, the suit said.
   The suit also accused Root of billing Sonrise twice for the same
services from April 1987 through August 1988, with overpayments
amounting to $54,200.
   In another case, Root's escrow account also was paid $45,000
twice to buy a construction permit for an FM station in Olney, Texas.

<HEAD>Pentagon Declassifies List of Contractors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The B-2 stealth bomber, once one of the
Pentagon's most closely-guarded secret weapons systems, is becoming
more public each day.
   The latest Pentagon step in its high-profile campaign to surmount
congressional opposition to the expensive bomber is the
declassification of a list of 156 contractors in 26 states and the
District of Columbia involved in the program.
   ``The U.S. Air Force's B-2 program is supported nationwide by
tens of thousands of men and women at prime contractor Northrop
Corp., key subcontractors Boeing, LTV, General Electric and Hughes,
and other suppliers and subcontractors in 46 states,'' Northrop said
in a five-page memorandum received Wednesday.
   The memo, which includes the recently-declassified list of
contractors, was sent to members of Congress this week.
   The B-2 program has been shrouded in secrecy for nearly 10 years,
but as opposition to the expensive aircraft has grown in Congress,
the Air Force has been more forthcoming with information.
   Last week, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice and Chief of Staff
Larry Welch briefed members of the House Armed Services Committee in
an open session that included a color-slide presentation on the
plane.
   On Monday, the aircraft took off on its maiden two-hour test
flight with a huge bank of television cameras trained on it as it
flew over the Mojave Desert.
   Asked about the change in public access to the bomber at the test
flight, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Tuesday, ``It's a
wonderful country, isn't it?''
   The publicity campaign contrasts sharply with another weapon, the
super-secret F-117A stealth fighter, which remains under wraps.
``I'd urge you not to mix different planes and different missions,''
Williams said.
   Despite the successful flight, congressional opposition remains
to the radar-evading aircraft that at $530 million a copy is the
most expensive in history.
   The Pentagon hopes to buy 132 planes at a cost of about $70
billion.
   One Republican, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, said of the Northrop
memo, ``The company has now fallen back to selling the B-2 as a jobs
program. But I doubt Congress will be blinded by the smoke screen
that Northrop is trying to throw over us.''
   In fiscal 1990, the Defense Department has proposed spending $4.7
billion for the B-2, but last month the House Armed Services panel
cut $800 million from the budget. Money for the B-2 is expected to
be the most controversial item next week when the House and Senate
consider the defense bill.

<TEXT>
   The murder of actress Rebecca Schaeffer and the
fiery assault on Lorimar Studios this week dramatize the increased
perils of living in the glare of Hollywood's bright lights.
   Entertainers have long employed security, if only to fend off the
paparazzi. But a string of recent incidents, including threats and
attacks involving actors such as Michael J. Fox and Michael Landon,
have prompted some stars to take greater safety measures.
   Gavin de Becker, Hollywood's leading security consultant, said
the killing of Miss Schaeffer bore similarities to the knife attack
seven years ago of his client, ``Raging Bull'' actress Theresa
Saldana.
   ``This was not Victoria Principal or Madonna,'' de Becker said
Wednesday. ``This was somebody with a far smaller audience. There is
a dynamic that says, `Whitney Houston is for everyone, but you're
for me.''
   ``There are more kooks in the world,'' said Ron Wells, business
manager of the American Federation of Guards here, a union
overseeing the 300 guards who protect studio gates.
   Robert John Bardo, 19, of Tucson, Ariz., was an obsessive fan of
Miss Schaeffer, police said Wednesday as Bardo was charged with
murder in the shooting death of the 21-year-old co-star of the
1986-88 CBS sitcom, ``My Sister Sam.''
   Investigators looking into another violent attack on Tuesday
believe Edward Phillips Jr., 43, of Corydon, Ind., was angered by a
business dispute with ``Dallas'' star Ken Kercheval over a popcorn
company.
   Phillips crashed a truck through the gate at Lorimar where
``Dallas'' is filmed, fired a burst of shotgun blasts, set his
vehicle afire and then killed himself.
   De Becker said he is in constant demand because of an exponential
growth in the volume of fan nuisance letters in recent years. He has
expanded into providing security for celebrity weddings and handled
last year's nuptials between Fox and actress Tracy Pollan.
   In an unusual departure, Eddie Murphy has set up a separate
security post at the offices of his new production company, even
though it sits on the Paramount Studios lot, itself protected by a
squadron of guards.
   When Murphy appears publicly, he is surrounded by a squadron of
guards and friends.
   Record producer Phil Spector is legendary for not making a move
without a security guard present, even though few people would
recognize him. Prince rarely appears without bodyguard accompaniment.
   Elizabeth Taylor and other stars have installed elaborate
security systems around their homes, often including cameras and
fence enclosures. Local tabloid reporters single out Olivia Newton
John, Sylvester Stallone and Johnny Carson for having the most
sophisticated protection.
   But despite the security, few celebrities may be completely
beyond the public's reach.
   ``The access is there if somebody wants to get to a celebrity,''
said Barry Levine, West Coast bureau chief for the tabloid Star,
itself an expert at gate-crashing. ``The stars can have security
guards and security systems more sensitive than a bank's, but people
can still buy a star map for $2 and haunt these people.
   ``There really seems to be a rash of these things. We seem to do
more stories about obsessed fans than anything else.''
   This week, 26-year-old Tina Marie-Ledbetter pleaded innocent in
Los Angeles Superior Court to sending thousands of threatening
letters and rabbit droppings to Fox, star of the former hit series,
``Family Ties.'' She was ordered to remain without bail at the Sybil
Brand Institute for Women.
   Two guards were shot and killed at Universal Studios last
December by a man who demanded to see Landon, star of ``Highway to
Heaven.'' Nathan Trupp, 44, of New Mexico, has pleaded innocent to
the charges.
   A deranged fan of Miss Saldana may be released early next year
after serving half of a 12-year sentence for a knife attack against
the actress. Arthur Jackson, a 53-year-old Scottish drifter,
attacked the actress in 1982, stabbing her 10 times with a kitchen
knife.
   ``I'm trying not to allow it to bring back bad memories for me,''
Miss Saldana said Wednesday of Miss Schaeffer's murder. ``I really
had a hard time with it this morning.''
   In true Hollywood fashion, celebrity stalking has been in the
news so much in recent years that the practice has sparked two
movies: 1981's ``The Fan,'' starring Lauren Bacall and 1982's ``The
Seduction,'' featuring Morgan Fairchild.

<HEAD>Failed Business Deal Apparently Provoked Movie Set Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who drove a truck through a
studio gate, set it afire and then committed suicide had claimed he
was the victim of a ``rotten, stinking deal'' involving ``Dallas''
star Ken Kercheval.
   Edward Phillips Jr., 43, of Corydon, Ind., was voted out of his
management position at Old Capital Popcorn in April 1988 by his then
wife, Linda, and Kercheval, who had bought the company from the
couple.
   Phillips fired 12-gauge shotgun blasts at the outside walls of a
sound stage where ``Dallas'' is filmed before shooting himself in
the chest on Tuesday.
   An article detailing the Corydon-based popcorn maker's financial
woes, published in April by The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky.,
was among items Phillips handed to a studio guard at the beginning
of his rampage, police said Wednesday.
   Phillips, a former farm-implement dealer, purchased Old Capital
Popcorn with his ex-wife in 1983.
   Kercheval liked the popcorn so much he invested $998,800 in the
company in 1985, acquiring a one-third interest. In April 1988, he
bought out the remainder of the company.
   In a statement issued through his publicist, Kercheval said he
was ``shocked and astonished'' by the suicide.
   The 54-year-old actor said that after he bought the company,
Phillips ``on several occasions exhibited irrational behavior that
frightened my family and associates.''
   Kercheval plays oil tycoon Cliff Barnes on the CBS series, which
is produced by Lorimar-Telepictures Corp.
   Late Tuesday afternoon, Phillips drove an 18-foot truck to a gate
at the Lorimar lot 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. With the
newspaper article and truck rental papers, he handed a security
guard two canisters of methyl bromide gas, telling him, ``You have
five minutes to live,'' police said.
   Methyl bromide is a caustic gas used to make popcorn, police Lt.
Bill Burck said.
   Phillips then drove through the gate, set the truck afire near a
sound stage and fired five blasts from a shotgun into nearby stage
walls as he yelled for people to stay away.
   Within minutes, police surrounded the gunman and Phillips shot
himself as they closed in. A bomb squad was called to the scene
after firefighters spotted what later proved to be a dummy hand
grenade inside the charred remains of the truck.
   Phillips was quoted in The Courier-Journal article as saying he
was devastated last year when he lost control of the popcorn firm
and his wife sued for divorce. Afterward, he said he admitted
himself briefly to an Ohio hospital for treatment of depression.
   Although the partnership seemed promising after Kercheval took
his first stake in 1985, Phillips and Kercheval clashed often over
corporate strategies and marketing decisions.
   Three years later, Linda Phillips and Kercheval voted against
renewing Phillips' management contract.
   A variety of disputes prompted numerous lawsuits in the case,
which left Phillips deeply embittered, the newspaper quoted Phillips
as saying, ``It was a rotten, stinking deal.''
   Linda Phillips declined to comment on the matter. ``It's just too
much right now,'' she was quoted as saying in today's Los Angeles
Times.

   The crash of a DC-10 in Iowa comes just as
McDonnell Douglas prepares to deliver the last of the workhorse
airliners plagued by some of history's worst air disasters.
   The wide-bodied, three-engine aircraft used by 51 world airlines
and built by McDonnell Douglas has had cargo door problems, been
accused of design flaws and was once grounded for more than a month
by the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The DC-10s have been the workhorse of many airlines, carrying
from 250 to 380 passengers, depending upon how their interior is
configured.
   A DC-10 was involved in history's worst U.S. air disaster that
killed 273 people in Chicago in 1979 and in one of the worst
single-plane disasters in the world, the 1974 crash of a Turkish
Airliner in Paris that killed 346 people.
   Wednesday's crash of United Airlines Flight 232 on its way from
Denver to Chicago during an emergency landing attempt in Iowa had
the potential of eclipsing the 1979 crash, but more than half the
293 people aboard survived after the plane cartwheeled into the
ground in a ball of flames.
   The pilot had radioed ``complete hydraulic failure'' prior to the
crash landing, FAA officials in Washington said.
   Failure of the hydraulics system, which is the main means of
controlling wing flaps and other mechanisms that guide the aircraft,
also has figured in other DC-10 crashes, although the primary cause
has varied.
   The Turkish Airlines crash was blamed on faulty cargo door
design, which was later altered after nonfatal incidents of doors
popping off other DC-10s in the United States and Canada. The loss
of the door led to decompression that buckled the floor which, in
turn, severed hydraulic lines essential to taking off, steering and
landing an airliner.
   Floors in wide-bodied jets were strengthened and hydraulic lines
rerouted after the incidents.
   In the Chicago American Airlines crash, hydraulic lines along the
wings were severed when one of the plane's engines came loose and
somersaulted over the wing.
   The FAA grounded all U.S. DC-10s but allowed them to fly 37 days
later. The National Transportation Board determined erroneous
maintenance procedures by American Airlines caused the engine
supports to crack. The board also said some systems in the plane
were vulnerable to damage.
   Jim Reed, spokesman for McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis, said 445
DC-10s have been built since 1969, including military models dubbed
KC-10s.
   Plagued by financial losses following the Chicago crash and heavy
competition from other wide-body airliners, the company's Douglas
Aircraft unit announced in 1983 it was ending production of the
model, except for military tanker versions that were on order.
   Two passenger planes remained unsold, and the last one of those
is to be delivered to Nigeria Airlines in a few weeks, Reed said.
   In 1980, a retired American Airlines pilot, Fred G. Johnson, told
a news conference he had refused to fly the DC-10 during his last
six months as a captain because it was unsafe.
   He said although the plane has several hydraulic systems, they
are interconnected through pumps so that failure of one system
jeopardizes the others.
   McDonnell Douglas officials have consistently defended the
aircraft as safe, blaming bad publicity for a decline in orders.
   The big tri-jets also have been involved in several crashes that
were blamed on pilot error or problems not related to design or
maintenance.
   In addition to the Chicago crash, two other DC-10s crashed in
1979. An Air New Zealand model hit the rocky slopes of a volcano at
the edge of Antarctica, killing all 257 people aboard. And 74 people
died when the pilot of a Western Airlines DC-10 landed on a Mexico
City runway that was closed for repairs.

<HEAD>UMW Strike Against Pittston Over More Than Just Wages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A labor dispute that began 3{ months ago as
a small walkout at one company has mushroomed into a battle between
the United Mine Workers and the coal industry, and turned
southwestern Virginia's mountains into a tinderbox of violence.
   The strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc. spread for a time
through wildcat strikes to every coal-producing state in the East
and led to shooting, rock throwing and thousands of arrests.
   U.S. District Judge Glenn Williams has imposed more than $4
million in fines on the union for violating an order against civil
disobedience by blocking mine entrances and coal-hauling roads.
   Today the two sides appear as far apart as ever, although a judge
has persuaded them to resume talks and most of the wildcat strikes
have subsided.
   Pittston Coal has headquarters in Lebanon, Va., and 30 coal
operations _ including 20 mines _ in three states. It is a
subsidiary of the Greenwich, Conn.-based Pittston Co.
   The strike initially involved 1,700 UMW members in Virginia and
West Virginia. In June, 200 Kentucky miners joined the walkout.
   All had been working for 14 months without a contract after
Pittston refused to sign a national agreement reached last year with
the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
   Pittston President Michael Odom said the association agreement
threatened his company's economic stability. He sought concessions _
in work rules and benefits rather than wages _ that he claimed would
save the company $5 or more in labor costs per ton of coal.
   UMW President Richard Trumka, fearing that one successful holdout
would lead to other companies to reject the national contract,
accused Pittston of trying to break the union.
   Pittston has hired replacement workers but saw production cut to
a third of normal levels during the first two months of the strike.
   The strike began spreading June 12, after federally mediated
negotiations broke down and Williams imposed fines and temporarily
jailed three union leaders in an effort to stop disruptions of coal
traffic.
   Wildcat sympathy walkouts eventually involved as many as 46,000
miners in 10 Eastern states. Most workers returned to their jobs
this week, heeding union orders, but thousands of miners remained
off the job in West Virginia.
   Pay is not a big issue in the Pittston dispute. Miners will earn
a maximum $16.77 an hour over three years under terms the company
put into effect on its own June 10.
   A major issue that sparked harsh words at Wednesday's resumption
of talks concerns health and retirement benefits for miners.
   Pittston wants to pull out of a national retirement fund and
replace it with a plan only for its 560 retirees covered by the
plan. Trumka says that would jeopardize medical benefits for 6,000
pensioners, Pittston's share of the 130,000 pensioners covered by
the national fund.
   Pittston also wants the right to require overtime and Sunday
work. The union further accuses Pittston of threatening job security
by seeking permission to hire outside contractors to perform jobs
that have been handled by UMW members.
   The company contends it needs a seven-day work week and other
flexibility to meet competition from non-union and foreign coal
producers. Pittston is the nation's 15th largest coal producer but
its largest exporter.
   Job security is a touchy issue because of the increasing
mechanization of mining that has seen UMW membership drop to 85,000
from 144,000 in 1980 and a peak of 400,000 during World War II.
Union miners produce only a little more than a third of the nation's
coal, down from 70 percent in 1970. The UMW represents about 45
percent of U.S. coal miners.
   Although the judge succeeded in getting Trumka and Odom to resume
talks Wednesday, the agreement to resume negotiations showed how far
apart, and bitterly divided, the two sides remain.
   Pittston was allowed to continue claiming that talks are at an
impasse, which keeps its self-imposed contract terms in effect. The
union was allowed to preserve its claim that Pittston failed to
bargain in good faith, holding open the possibility that strikers
will get their jobs back once the dispute ends.
   The dispute marks the second time in as many BCOA contracts that
the union has fought a coal company to sign a labor agreement.
   In December 1985, the UMW ended a 15-month strike against the
A.T. Massey Coal Co. that started when the Richmond-based Massey
left to its subsidiaries whether to sign the pact. The UMW insisted
that Massey, as the parent, sign for its holdings.
   At its peak, the walkout involved 2,000 union miners in Kentucky
and Virginia. Most Massey subsidiaries eventually reached a contract
with the union after obtaining limited concessions.

   Authorities evacuated 1,500 tourists and banned new
visitors from the Black Sea region of Abkhazia, where troops have
been unable to halt a bloody feud between rival ethnic groups,
Soviet media said today.
   Armed bands of Georgians and Abkhazians continued to roam the
roads in the resort area 870 miles south of Moscow, Tass said.
   Authorities declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew in
the region on Tuesday and by today had confiscated more than 2,500
firearms, Radio Moscow said.
   But the report said ``attacks on citizens, policemen, and army
servicemen'' continued Wednesday night in the Abkhazian capital of
Sukhumi.
   Soviet news reports said Interior Ministry troops and police were
confiscating weapons from rioters, but Komsomolskaya Pravda, the
Communist Youth League newspaper, reported today that Sukhumi police
had to return some firearms to fear-stricken residents.
   The paper said police were forced to ``give way to the demands of
people tortured by fear and rumors, who surrounded the district
Interior Ministry building and demanded the return of their hunting
weapons for self-defense.''
   The violence has claimed at least 18 lives since it began
Saturday in Abkhazia, a 3,320-mile autonomous region in the southern
Soviet republic of Georgia. Komsomolskaya Pravda reported today that
339 people have been injured.
   Georgians outnumber Abkhazians 240,000 to 90,000 in the region
and both sides claim discrimination by the other. Many Abkhazians
demand that it be designated a 16th Soviet republic.
   Authorities banned visitors to the region, where millions of
tourists vacation every year, Tass said today. It said that 1,500
people were flown out in a 24-hour period ending today.
   The violence has halted road and rail transportation.
   More than 120 people have died in ethnic unrest in the past month
in the Soviet Union's southern republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.
   In Abkhazia, armed rioters traveling in cars have attacked troops
and citizens for the purpose of seizing weapons, Tass said. Rioters
have attacked a hydroelectric dam and shot up two trains.
   With strikes widespread in Sukhumi, food supplies have been
interrupted and long bread lines form each morning, Komsomolskaya
Pravda said.
   Rules for citizens under the state of emergency forbid large
street gatherings, ban the use of private cars and require all
firearms to be surrendered to authorities.
   The order also includes an 11 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The infant mortality rate in the nation's
capital jumped to more than twice the national average last year,
largely due to an increase in drug abuse among pregnant women, city
officials say.
   The District of Columbia saw 23.2 infant deaths per 1,000 births
in 1988, the highest level since 1980 and more than double the
national average of 9.9 deaths per 1,000 births, the city reported
Wednesday. The new statistics represented a substantial increase
over the 1987 rate of 19.6 deaths per 1,000 births.
   ``It's as if ... we've been hit by a hurricane that government
can't control,'' said Patricia A. Tompkins, chief of the Office of
Maternal and Child Health. ``There's a tremendous amount of drug
abuse among women of childbearing age.''
   Tomkins said the city expected an increase, but not one so
dramatic. ``It was kind of a shock,'' she said.
   The district's rise in infant mortality followed several years of
modest success in curbing what has long been identified as one of
the district's biggest health problems. Until 1988, the infant
mortality rate had been relatively stable for four years, and had
declined slightly in 1987.
   D.C. Mayor Marion Barry has made infant mortality a major part of
its health care agenda. But the city's efforts have been overwhelmed
by the crack cocaine epidemic, which has swamped hospitals with the
babies of drug addicts. Women who use drugs often give birth to
infants with low birth weights who have an increased likelihood of
dying before they reach their first birthdays.

<HEAD>South Korean Defense Minister Promises U.S. Jet Purchase</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is praising South
Korea's decision to purchase U.S. fighter jets but indicates the
sensitive topic of co-production of the sophisticated fighters
hasn't been resolved.
   Cheney met with reporters Wednesday after completing the annual
series of talks with his South Korean counterpart, Lee Sang Hoon.
   ``I would like to get the best deal that we can,'' Cheney said
when asked about the issue.
   The subject of co-production, eagerly sought by the South
Koreans, has raised concern among some lawmakers on Capitol Hill
about the risks of transferring sensitive technology to a nation
eager to build its own aviation industry.
   Lee told reporters South Korea intends to purchase U.S. fighters
but has not yet decided which type.
   Asked about a possible co-production plan, Cheney said he had
advised his counterpart to purchase U.S.-produced fighters.
   He added, however, that it is in the United States' interest to
see that the Republic of Korea has necessary equipment to upgrade
its air defenses and that the two sides ``have been discussing the
best method'' by which that can be accomplished.

<NOTE>Economists Call for More Investment in Programs that Aid People</NOTE>

   New taxes are needed to pay for programs to
improve education, public health and technology, economists told a
congressional panel.
   Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin said lawmakers intent
on debating the federal deficit are ignoring the basic need for
investment in people.
   Tobin joined 326 other economists in signing a statement
Wednesday saying that failure to increase investment in such things
as education, public health, transportation and technology ``will
have a crippling effect on America's future competitiveness.''
   The increased investment must be paid for through cuts in
military and agriculture subsidy spending, as well as with revenue
from new taxes, according to the statement by the Economic Policy
Institute, a Washington-based think tank.
   ``We need sooner or later, preferably sooner, to break the
political taboo on raising federal revenues,'' Tobin said.
   Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder, also testifying
Wednesday before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, said
the government's ``unending obsession'' with the deficit will
adversely affect future productivity and standards of living.
   Blinder said the government must invest more in such things as
programs to aid disadvantaged children and to improve roads, bridges
and sewer facilities.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says he's
concerned that the administration's decision to allow the sale of
personal computers to Soviet bloc nations gives them computers
``with military applications.''
   Cheney commented on the issue Wednesday in an effort to clarify a
Washington Post story that said he had been ``persuaded'' by
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher to support the decision.
   ``I do not support that decision,'' Cheney said, appearing
clearly irritated.
   The secretary said he opposed the move because it would give the
Soviets ``significant capabilities they do not now possess.''
   Cheney's comments revealed the fierce debate waged inside
President Bush's Cabinet over the decision, which marks a major
shift in policy from the previous administration.
   Conservative members of that administration had sought to retain
tight control of high-tech exports to the Soviets. But this
administration's shift appears to have been influenced by the more
open attitude between the superpowers fostered by Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.

   Capitalizing on Israeli frustration over the
Palestinian uprising, Ariel Sharon has moved into a strong position
in the right-wing Likud bloc and challenged Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   Six years ago Sharon was disgraced and forced to resign as
defense minister for failing to prevent the massacre of more than
800 Palestinians by Lebanese Christians who were allowed into
Israeli-encircled refugee camps in Beirut.
   But Sharon, 61, has fought his way out of the political
wilderness, assuring Israelis he knows how to crush the 19-month
Palestinian uprising, which has claimed 570 Arab and 37 Israeli
lives.
   Speaking in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights this week, Sharon
suggested one way to improve the situation was to ``liquidate'' PLO
chief Yasser Arafat and other PLO officials.
   The comment was criticized by the U.S. State Department as
unhelpful to peace efforts. But at home, his tough talk is
increasingly welcomed by Israelis frustrated by the violence.
   ``We are at a historic crossroads and in the absence of a
national consensus about which road to take, the extremists gain the
upper hand,'' said Yehoshua Saguy, a Likud member of Parliament.
   ``If the situation continues getting worse, the people will grow
more extremist and feel they are in a time of national emergency. In
emergency conditions there is no room for realpolitik,'' said Saguy,
a former head of military intelligence who like Sharon was forced to
resign after the 1982 massacre.
   Sharon, minister of trade and industry in the coalition Cabinet,
demonstrated his power at a party convention earlier this month in
which he forced Shamir to tack hard-line conditions onto his peace
initiative.
   Sharon's restraints angered Palestinians and drew expressions of
concern from U.S. officials, worried that Shamir's ability to
compromise had been curtailed.
   The conditions included a demand that the uprising be halted
before Shamir's plan for Palestinian elections in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip is implemented and a stipulation that Jewish
settlements would continue to be built in the territories.
   The move almost triggered the breakup of the 8-month-old
coalition with Vice Premier Shimon Peres of the Labor Party
threatening to quit unless the conditions were abandoned.
   Sharon, the most charismatic and controversial figure in Likud,
has made no secret of the fact that he wants the party leadership.
Some analysts are now viewing him as a serious contender for the
first time.
   ``Suddenly Sharon looks strong and Shamir weak,'' said Nahum
Barnea, a political columnist for the Yediot Ahronot daily and
former editor of the left-wing Koteret Rashit magazine.
   ``There's no doubt that he (Sharon) is now dictating the party's
policy.''
   Sharon's comeback has generated tension between the two men.
Their dispute broke into the open today, with two major Israeli
newspapers _ Yediot Ahronot and Haaretz _ reporting that Shamir was
considering firing Sharon.
   Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir declined direct comment on the
reports.
   He suggested the premier was seeking to avoid splits in his party
and, at the same time, deter internal threats to his peace plan.
   ``The prime minister is concerned about the unity of the Likud.
He has a high tolerance threshold and tries to see things in their
broadest sense,'' Ahimeir said. ``He intends to continue advancing
the peace process. Sharon is only one of 11 (Likud) ministers.''
   According to the two newpapers, Sharon complained at a meeting
Wednesday of Likud leaders meeting that Shamir had not advised him
about the latest contacts between ministers and Palestinians.
   ``I cannot tell you anything, you leak everything you get your
hands on,'' Shamir replied, and also accused Sharon of ``sowing bad
blood and hatred among us.''
   ``I can only laugh at your words,'' Sharon was quoted as saying,
to which Shamir reportedly responded:
   ``He who laughs last laughs best and I don't want to speak to
you.''
   ``No personal attacks or threats to fire me will keep me from
demanding an end to the murder of Jews in the land of Israel,''
Sharon said afterward in a fiery interview on army radio.
   He accused the government of devoting too little time to
discussing the uprising, and world pressure on Israel to speak to
the PLO.
   ``In the U.S. Senate there is a tough ongoing debate on this
subject, and there they aren't being murdered ever day. And here
just anything goes?,'' Sharon said.
   Despite his irascible style, Sharon has strong public confidence.
   A poll of 1,206 Israelis conducted in May by the independent
Modiin Ezrachi Agency showed 44.4 percent had more confidence in
Sharon's ability to quell the uprising than in any other leader.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor won only 25.4 percent
support in the poll.
   ``I wouldn't necessarily use tougher measures, only different
ones,'' Sharon told a reporter recently.
   Although he declined to go into detail, Sharon pointed to his
record as a guerrilla fighter. He formed Israel's first commando
squad, known as Unit 101, and led the force on raids into Jordan in
the 1950s.

<HEAD>Shamir Aide Confirms Bush Letter, Claims It Was Supportive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
today confirmed that the premier received a letter from President
Bush condemning Jewish settlement building in the occupied lands as
an obstacle to peace.
   The spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, also said that Shamir had sent a
written response rejecting Bush's contention and saying he believed
that the settlements should have nothing to do with peace efforts.
   But Ahimeir denied a report that Bush had urged Israel, in the
letter of last month, to abandon hopes of a ``greater Israel.''
   The report, carried by National Public Radio from Washington on
Tuesday, said Bush urged Israel to halt settlement building in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel radio also carried the report.
   NPR also quoted Bush as reiterating a remark Secretary of State
James A. Baker III made to pro-Israeli lobbyists on May 22 that
Israel give up ideas of annexing the disputed territories.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Robert Hall declined direct
comment on Bush's letter, ``that all sounds like U.S. policy.''
   Ahimeir, interviewed by telephone, confirmed that Bush had
written Shamir at the end of June.
   He declined to quote directly from Bush's letter, but described
its contents as ``friendly, most positive,'' and supportive of
Israel's peace initiative.
   In the letter ``he said nothing on the subject of a greater land
of Israel,'' Ahimeir said. ``He made no mention of it. The letter,
which we received about a month ago is friendly and supports the
Israeli peace initiative and the government's peace efforts.''
   Bush, however, did reiterate longstanding U.S. objections to
Israel's construction of Jewish towns and villages in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Ahimeir said.
   Since seizing the disputed lands in the 1967 Middle East War,
Israel has built more than 130 of these enclaves, which are home to
about 70,000 Israelis. U.S. officials maintain the settlements run
counter to the U.S.-backed formula for Israel to give up occupied
land in exchange for peace.
   Bush's letter said these ``settlements are an obstacle to the
peace process,'' Ahimeir summarized it as saying.
   Paraphrasing Shamir's response, Ahimeir said, ``Shamir totally
rejects this view, and so he replied. He (Shamir) believes that
settlements have nothing whatsoever to do with his peace
initiative.''

<HEAD>Film Board Closes Meeting to Curb Confusion About Hollywood's Greatest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel instructed by Congress to name
Hollywood's 25 greatest movies went behind closed doors to debate
the merits of films such as ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and ``Citizen
Kane.''
   Wednesday's meeting was closed to the public over the protests of
reporters from The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and Daily
Variety, an observer said.
   Erich Schwartz, an attorney for the librarian of Congress charged
with overseeing the selections, said the meeting was conducted
secretly to dispel public confusion about the panel's work and to
promote ``spirited discussion.''
   ``There was nothing Machiavellian in the decision to close the
meeting,'' said Schwartz.
   ``My personal feeling is that they didn't want to hurt any
filmmaker's feelings while discussing the merits of one picture over
another,'' said Jane Galbraith, a film reviewer and reporter for
Daily Variety. ``They didn't want to be associated with critical
comments about people that they work with.''
   The meeting had been billed as a public discussion of
recommendations the board would make to the librarian of Congress
for the first 25 films to be protected under the National Film
Preservation Act of 1988.
   The act, drafted in response to outcries about the practice of
coloring old black-and-white movies, stipulates that a panel of
experts select 25 titles each year for a national film register.
   Selected films can still be colored, but the act requires that
they're labelled as having been altered without the participation of
the original makers of the film.
   The National Film Preservation Board, composed of representatives
of 13 film groups, began meeting in a public session at the
University of California, Los Angeles.
   Chairwoman Fay Kanin, a representative of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, moved to close the meeting to the public
after almost 1{ hours.
   Schwartz said the board had already satisfied requirements under
the act to hold two public meetings and was under no legal
obligation to continue meeting in public session.
   Instead of reaching agreement on a list Wednesday, Schwartz said
each board member would compose his or her own personal list and
submit it to the librarian of Congress, James Billington. Then
Billington will make the final decision, announcing the choices in
September, he said.
   The move to a secret session was especially perplexing as board
members had discussed the nominations publicly prior to the meeting.
   In preliminary polling, 57 movies were nominated by at least two
of 13 members of the preservation board. The leader was ``The Grapes
of Wrath'' with eight votes. ``Casablanca'' and ``It's a Wonderful
Life'' each drew seven votes; ``The Best Years of Our Lives,'`
``Citizen Kane'' and ``On the Waterfront'' all received six votes.
   ``They just made this decision at their luncheon today, and they
didn't tell anybody about it,'' said Mary Tokita, a spokeswoman for
the UCLA College of Fine Arts who had volunteered to handle
publicity for the board.

<HEAD>Huge Crime Syndicate Holds Quiet Ceremony For New Boss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police claimed a victory today as the huge
Yamaguchi-gumi organized crime syndicate abandoned plans for an
elaborate inauguration for its new boss, opting instead for a quiet
gathering at its headquarters.
   ``Our pressure and hard work paid off,'' said a police official
in Kobe, a port city in western Japan where the 21,000-member gang
is based.
   He said police around the country had requested hotels and large
banquet halls not to accept reservations from the gang, which, with
no where else to go, finally had to hold the ceremony in a large
room on the second floor of its headquarters building.
   The official, who requested anonymity, said about 300 police
officers surrounded the building, located on a hill in an expensive
residential area, as 105 gangsters attended the two-hour fete.
   He said there were no arrests.
   When new boss Yoshinori Watanabe's predecessor, Masahisa
Takenaka, was inauguarated in Naruto on the southern island of
Shikoku in July 1984, about 1,000 police were mobilized.
   More than 300 gangsters, many dressed in black suits or kimono,
attended, although no incidents were reported.
   In 1985, Takenaka was killed in a leadership dispute that divided
the gang into two rival camps. More than two dozen deaths and 315
shootings made the ensuing conflict the bloodiest ever in Japan's
underworld.
   During today's ceremony, Watanabe is believed to have received
three ``treasures'' symbolic of his post, a tradition mocking the
three sacred treasures that have been passed down from emperor to
emperor for centuries.
   ``We don't expect anything to change under Watanabe,'' the
officer said. ``And we will keep up our pressure on the gang.''
   Watanabe, 48, heads the powerful Yama-ken gang, based in Kobe.
The gang is the largest within the Yamaguchi-gumi, and claims a
membership of 3,000.
   Police estimate there are nearly 90,000 gangsters, or yakuza, in
Japan and say nearly half are associated with the three biggest
syndicates _ the Yamaguchi-gumi, Sumiyoshi Rengo and the Inagawa-kai.
   Leaders of the Inagawa-kai, based in the Tokyo area, attended
today's ceremony, demonstrating their close relationship with the
Yamaguchi-gumi.
   Watanabe is the fifth boss of the gang, which was founded by
Harukichi Yamaguchi in 1915. When the gang was founded, it had only
50 members.
   Underworld syndicates often keep a high profile by posting signs
outside their offices, and the Yamaguchi-gumi headquarters is a
well-known Kobe landmark.
   Syndicates are involved in extortion, illicit gambling and the
drug and sex trades. They also commonly operate in construction,
real estate, money laundering and entertainment.
   Their activities are mainly limited to Japan, but they are known
to buy guns and drugs from the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan for
sale here.
   Police estimate the total underworld income at $15 billion
annually.
   Gang members have complex ``family'' relations cemented by
rituals, often patterned on Japan's indigenous Shinto religion,
where rice wine is sipped to seal vows of fidelity.
   Watanabe on May 18 completed his wine-sipping ceremony with the
gang's top leaders. Later that month, he was convicted of assault
and given a 10-month suspended sentence.

   In airports in Chicago and Denver, people grieved over the United
DC-10 crash. In a Philadelphia airport, some who grieved before came
to console.
   Flight 232, headed to Philadelphia from Denver via Chicago
crashed with 293 aboard Wednesday while attempting an emergency
landing in Sioux City, Iowa. More than half survived.
   Moments after hearing about the crash, four people who lost
relatives in one of the world's worst airline disasters rushed to
Philadelphia International Airport to offer consolation.
   Stan Maslowski and his wife, Norma, both of Haddonfield, N.J.,
lost their 30-year-old daughter, Diane, when a terrorist's bomb blew
up Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 21, killing 259 aboard and 11 people in
Lockerbie, Scotland, where the wreckage fell. Two others joined the
couple at the Philadelphia airport.
   ``The purpose of our visit is to comfort the families, to support
those people who wonder if they're family members are alive,''
Maslowski said.
   On Wednesday, though, their message reached no relatives of those
aboard the United flight. Maslowski said United officials told him
no one waiting for passengers had reported to the airport.
   ``It makes it all dredged up again,'' said Norma Maslowski of
their mission. ``It's horrible.''
   Maslowski said the relatives of the Pan Am victims have formed a
network of more than 400 people who are prepared to rush to airports
to console anyone waiting for a plane that had crashed.
   In Denver, United employees escorted 25 to 30 visibly shaken
relatives past ranks of reporters and television cameras. The media
were not allowed into the VIP area.
   United officials at Chicago's O'Hare Airport opened a lounge for
families of those aboard the flight.
   One woman entered crying, her fingertips at her mouth. Two men
leaving refused to speak with a reporter, one swearing as he brushed
by.
   Outside the room, 20 police officers and O'Hare security guards
stood by the entrance.
   Some at the Denver and Chicago airports had news to celebrate.
   Rabbi Avrohom Brownstein and his wife burst out of the VIP room
in Denver where relatives of passengers on the plane had gathered.
They had just heard their 9-year-old son, Yisroel, had survived with
a fractured arm and minor burns.
   ``He's OK. He always wanted to have a broken arm anyway. We just
talked to him on the phone and he's OK,'' Brownstein said.
   United officials in Chicago told Arthur and Christine Bulmann of
New Lenox, Ill., that his sister, Susan Randa, and her young son,
David, of Boulder, Colo., had only minor scratches from the crash.
   ``I think it's a miracle,'' Christine Bulmann said.

<TEXT>
   The Public Broadcasting Service is trying to
balance the pro-Arab point of view of a documentary to be aired
during a special about the Palestinian uprising, The New York Times
reported today.
   PBS is spending $150,000 in additional documentary material and
analysis to accompany ``Days of Rage: The Young Palestinians,'' the
Times said. The film, which cost $180,000 to make last summer, has
stirred protest for being pro-Palestinian.
   Many journalists and critics who have seen ``Days of Rage'' say
it is one-sided but provides a perspective unusual for American
television.
   The 90-minute film about the uprising, known as the intifada, has
been shown in several screenings across the country. After one
postponement, it is scheduled for nationwide viewing Sept. 6 during
a PBS special called ``Intifada: The Palestinians and Israel.''
   Two other ``minidocumentaries'' _ one on the Israeli presence in
the occupied territories and the other on human rights abuses _ will
be broadcast during the 2{-hour special.
   Jo Franklin-Trout, the film's producer and director, called the
decision to develop additional footage ``intellectually dishonest.''
But she said a meeting Wednesday with John Sharnik, who is producing
the extra programming, was ``cordial.''
   Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith, said after seeing the film this week that it
is ``an inaccurate, biased documentary which lacks historical or
present perspective.''
   He said PBS is acting irresponsibly in showing it.
   Stella Giamassi, a spokeswoman for public television station
WNET, said about 70 percent of the 2,500 letters the station has
received protested the planned broadcast.

<TEXT>
   North Korea demanded today that South
Korea not arrest a Seoul college student who violated a ban on
visits to the communist north and now wants to return home,
officials said today.
   North Korea insisted that South Korean Prime Minister Kang
Young-hoon give a public assurance that 20-year-old Im Su-kyong may
return home as a free citizen through the border village of
Panmunjom, officials said.
   ``If she is arrested and persecuted, North-South relations will
be further aggravated, creating a grave obstacle in the road to
peaceful unification,'' the message from North Korea said.
   South Korea said the message was relayed in a telephone call to
South Korean Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo.
   It was not immediately known whether South Korea would allow Miss
Im to cross the border. There have been few mutually acceptable
crossings between the enemy nations since they were divided at the
end of World War II.
   Park Jyun-kyu, chairman of South Korea's governing Democratic
Justice Party, has warned that any North Korean attempt to send the
student back to Seoul through Panmunjom ``will raise havoc on the
present military status quo at the demarcation line.''
   The Demilitarized Zone runs through the middle of the truce
village.
   Also today, North Korean Red Cross chief Son Song-pil sent a
telephone message to his South Korean counterpart requesting
``immediate steps to guarantee personal safety for Miss Im.''
   The Seoul government has announced that Miss Im, a radical
student leader attending Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign
Studies, would be arrested when she returned from the north and
charged with violating national security law.
   She defied the government's ban on unauthorized travel to North
Korea and traveled by air via Tokyo and East Germany to attend the
July 1-8 World Festival for Youth and Students in the North's
capital of Pyongyang.
   At a news conference in Pyongyang, she said she wanted to return
home through the border to symbolize a unified Korea and planned to
do so on July 27, the anniversary of the cease-fire that ended the
1950-53 Korean War.
   That is also the last day of a planned July 20-27 peace march
aimed at drawing national and international support for unification
of the peninsula.
   Organizers said in Washington on July 6 that the march would
include about 100 foreigners and would be held simultaneously in
both countries, with the two groups meeting at the border in
Panmunjom.
   South Korea regards the march as a pro-communist vehicle to stir
up unrest and tightened immigration proceedures at all ports of
entry to block foreigners who might try to participate. South Korea
prohibits foreigners from engaging in political activity.
   Riot police were deployed today at Mount Halla on the southern
island of Cheju where the march was scheduled to begin, according to
Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. Only journalists and tourists
showed up, the agency said.

   Morton Downey Jr., whose combative,
ultraconservative style lifted his talk show from a New Jersey
studio to nationwide syndication, announced he has harangued his
last guest.
   MCA Television, WWOR-TV and Quantum Media Inc., joint owners of
the show, said in a statement the final episode was taped on June 30.
   The companies' statement, released Wednesday, said the show would
run no more original segments after Sept. 15, the end of Downey's
contract with the stations carrying his show.
   The show premiered in the New York area on Oct. 19, 1987 and
quickly drew attention for Downey's abrasive style. The show was
soon syndicated and by early 1988 was being shown in most major U.S.
television markets.
   But ratings began to slip last spring as Downey was involved in a
series of highly publicized incidents. Those included charges that
he was involved in a scheme to sell shares of a non-existent gold
mine and an incident in a San Francisco airport bathroom, in which
he claimed he was attacked by skinheads and a Nazi swastika was
painted on his face. Airport police called the attack a publicity
stunt.

<HEAD>Court Concludes Deliberations in Palme Murder Trial</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS background. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court today ended deliberations in the
trial of a man accused of the 1986 killing of Prime Minister Olof
Palme and ordered the defendant held in custody until the verdict is
published next week.
   The announcement was a strong indication that Christer Pettersson
had been found guilty of shooting Palme. Had the verdict been
innocent, he would have been ordered released immediately.
   The District Court's announcement, however, did not necessarily
mean he would be sentenced on the charge of first-degree murder.
   If judged to be the killer, Pettersson could be sent for
psychiatric examination with the possibility of committal in a
closed mental institution.
   Pettersson was tried by a panel of two judges and six lay jurors,
all with an equal say in determining the defendant's innocence or
guilt.
   ``The deliberations are over,'' said court spokesman Bertil
Hagberg. ``The defendant shall remain in custody.''
   Pettersson, a 42-year-old with a history of drug and alcohol
abuse, denied shooting Palme, and claimed he was 17 miles away at
the time of the Feb. 28, 1986 shooting.
   The verdict will be published on July 27, the court said. The
jury's final session lasted more than two hours. It was their fourth
meeting since the four-week trial concluded July 10.
   A simple majority of the eight-member panel would be enough for a
guilty verdict. A tie vote would mean acquittal.
   Prosecutor Anders Helin cautioned against drawing a firm
conclusion about the verdict from the court's announcement, but said
``normally this would point to a guilty verdict.''
   Helin said he assumed Pettersson would appeal a guilty verdict to
the Superior Court.
   Defense attorney Arne Liljeros said his client was ``very
disappointed.''
   Pettersson was arrested last Dec. 14, nearly three years after
Palme was shot in the back from close range after leaving a movie
with his wife Lisbeth.
   Mrs. Palme identified Pettersson in court as the man she saw
standing a few feet away immediately after he husband fell with a
fatal gunshot wound.
   Though she saw no weapon, other witnesses testified that no one
else was near enough to have fired the shot.
   The defense challenged Mrs. Palme's reliability more than three
years after the event, and noted the lack of a motive, murder weapon
or other forensic evidence to link Pettersson with the shooting.

   In the moments after the crash of United
Airlines Flight 232, passengers were upside down, belted in their
seats. Some freed others. Some could rescue only themselves.
   Passengers spoke of the pilot's warnings before Wednesday's
deadly crash, but they mostly remembered the impact and escaping the
fractured fuselage.
   More than half of the 293 people on board the flight survived the
crash, some walking away with only bruises. The three-member cockpit
crew survived, too.
   The pilot warned passengers about 20 minutes before the crash
that ``it would likely be a rough landing,'' several survivors
recalled.
   Among the passengers was another pilot, who put a pillow over his
head as the plane crashed and cartwheeled three times just off an
unused runway at Sioux Gateway Airport.
   ``We rolled upside down, and inside out and every which way. The
plane broke into three pieces, and bodies all over the place,
hanging upside down,'' said Charlie Martz, of Castle Rock, Colo.
   ``I unfastened my belt and dropped a little ways. ... Finally I
saw what I thought was an open window, but there were flames. I
said, `To hell with it, I'm going for it' and I went through the
flames. I can't believe it, there were people with feet missing and
arms missing, it's the goddamndest thing I've ever seen in my life.''
   In Chicago, 33 tired and somber survivors completed their journey
early this morning on a chartered United Airlines flight.
   Several wore neck braces, one had a bandaged eye and at least two
people still wore dirt- or blood-stained clothing. Police escorted
them through O'Hare Airport, keeping reporters away.
   Debbie Belliveau, 40, of Michigan City, Ind., spoke to reporters,
though, saying the fire that erupted after the crash ``scared us
all. Because the fire was really obvious. I mean there was smoke
everywhere.''
   Mrs. Belliveau said the professionalism of the flight attendants
and the pilot's calm voice convinced her that the plane would be
brought in safely.
   ``We thought we were going to make it and when he said `brace,
brace, brace' for the second time we really thought we were going to
make it.''
   In Sioux City, Danny Surge of Chicago said when it was apparent
the plane was in trouble passenger Ron Rhode of Marysville, Ohio,
went over to sit with 8-year-old Ben Radtke of Prairie View, Ill.,
who was traveling alone.
   The plane ``hit and bounced, then flipped and spun around so we
ended up upside down. I let go and asked Dan for the kid'' and
shoved him out, Rhode said.
   Ben was shaking but thankful to be alive.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' he said, clutching a United
Airlines button and a pair of plastic pilot's wings.
   As the plane filled with smoke shortly after the crash, Cliff
Marshall of Columbus, Ohio, saw a way out.
   ``God opened a hole in the basement, and I pushed a little girl
out and grabbed another and kept pulling them out until they didn't
come no more,'' he said.
   David Landsberger, 40, of Caldwell, N.J., said after the plane
stopped sliding, ``we let ourselves down and started walking towards
this large open area at the back of the plane.
   ``We just all walked out into a cornfield. I was a little dazed.
I do know that I probably stepped on some people or something as we
were walking out, but I knew if we stopped we'd all get bottled up.''
   Bruce Benham, 37, a Littleton, Colo., restaurateur, said the
evacuation was orderly: ``There was not a lot of panic. Only when I
got into the cornfield did I look back and see other parts of the
plane burning.''
   Later, Landsberger was unsure of his plans.
   ``I'd really like to go have a beer and go to bed,'' he said. ``I
don't know what I'm going to do. But I'm not going to walk back to
New Jersey. I'll probably fly.''

<TEXT>
   A Rembrandt drawing stolen 10 years ago from a
Dutch museum is on its way back to Amsterdam today after being
identified by an art expert at Christie's auction house.
   The unsigned artwork came to the auction house from a European
dealer, Christie's spokeswoman Starr Collins said Wednesday. The
drawing was consigned to the dealer by a client who bought it for an
undisclosed sum several years ago as a ``good anonymous drawing,''
she said.
   The auction house routinely tries to attribute all the unsigned
works it receives for auction. Beverly Jacoby, who heads Christie's
Old Masters department, got this one on June 16.
   ``I knew right away it had a very good shot at being a
Rembrandt,'' she said. ``I felt the drawing on stylistic grounds was
very Rembrandtesque and also very high quality.''
   Research quickly confirmed her hunch.
   ``After my initial elation that it was a Rembrandt, I read
through the catalog entry, to the bottom line, where it said,
`Current ownership, Amsterdam Rembrandt House.' That sent alarm
bells ringing and I called our counsel before I did anything else,''
said Jacoby.
   ``We contacted them to inquire and they informed us the drawing
was stolen 10 years ago. I think they were very surprised and very
pleased.''
   The Rembrandt, removed from its original frame, was mounted on
two pieces of glass with tape around the edges.
   The 3-by-5 inch, double-sided drawing is in pen and ink on
handmade paper. One side depicts a child, believed to be Rembrandt's
son, Rombartus; the other a sleeping woman, thought to be his wife,
Saskia.
   ``A drawing of such personal and biographical interest has added
appeal'' and could have fetched more than $100,000 at auction, said
Jacoby.
   The drawing, which was stolen in May 1979, has been handed over
to U.S. Customs and is on its way to the Amsterdam museum, said Ms.
Collins.

   Howitzer shells and rockets rained on
Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors today in one of the fiercest
overnight duels between Syrian and Christian army gunners in 18
weeks of fighting.
   Police said four people were killed and 49 wounded.
   The shells hit residential buildings on both sides of Beirut's
dividing Green Line, starting hundreds of fires and covering the
city with a blanket of rubble and glass shards.
   Streets were full of cars reduced to smoldering piles of metal.
   Tongues of flame shot up in the sky and smoke billowed from
blasted buildings. Fire brigades were unable to combat blazes due to
a shortage of water caused by a power failure.
   Ambulances, their sirens wailing, sped through the streets to
evacuate the latest casualties, which raised the overall toll to 424
killed and 1,741 wounded since the current round of fighting broke
out March 8.
   Several Syrian artillery positions in West Beirut's seafront Ein
Mreisseh boulevard took direct hits and a police spokesman said many
Syrian soldiers were killed or wounded.
   ``We don't have a breakdown because the Syrian command does not
report its losses to us,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named
under standing regulations.
   At least eight Syrian army trucks loaded with rocket ammunition
and gasoline were gutted, according to a Lebanese eyewitness.
   One 155mm howitzer shell crashed at a road intersection across
the street from the Italian Embassy in west Beirut's Wardieh
district, wrecking a cluster of chic boutiques and the city's most
fashionable florist, Florelle.
   The barrage, according to police, reached an intensity of about
30 shells per minute at times. Police said at least 700 buildings
and shops were hit in the deadly barrage, which also inflicted
damage on more than 5,000 cars.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet
vying for power with the Christian Cabinet, pleaded with the leaders
of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria to speed up efforts aimed at
resolving Lebanon's crisis.
   In a cable, Hoss said: ``Beirut and its surroundings witnessed a
horrible night of barbaric random shelling.
   ``On behalf of the innocent people of Lebanon, its children,
women and elderly I plead with you to speed up your humanitarian
mission,'' he said.
   The three heads of state were assigned by an Arab summit in May
to find a settlement. Their cease-fire calls have been ignored by
the warring factions.
   ``May someone call the fire brigade. We want an ambulance too,''
a woman screamed from the 11-story Kaaki building in west Beirut's
Zokak Blatt district as fire raged in the top three floors.
   ``Telephone lines are down,'' a man shouted back from a nearby
building. ``Have faith in God, we're coming to help you.''
   The 10th-floor apartment of Fawzi Rida in Kaaki building took two
direct hits from 107mm rockets early today.
   Rida, 37, a Shiite Moslem, said, ``The explosions shattered the
walls and pushed the furniture out of the apartment.''
   ``I stretched a hand to open the door, but there was no door
left,'' he said, his eyes brimming with tears. ``We've nothing left
except the night dresses we are wearing.''
   Residents throughout the city rushed to basements shortly after
the shelling duel broke out late Wednesday night.
   ``There is no district in Beirut and the surrounding mountains
that wasn't targeted by the shelling,'' said a police spokesman, who
cannot be named in line with standing regulations.
   The current round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
began this spring two days after Christian army commander Gen.
Michel Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias
south of Beirut.
   Aoun took the measure to salvage about $100 million in lost
customs dues annually. The Syrians and their allies retaliated by
blockading the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command, speaking on condition of
anonymity, accused the Syrians of starting the latest barrage by
shelling the coastline north of Beirut to prevent three
vegetable-laden ships from docking at Christian ports.
   The Syrians have been shelling the Christian-controlled coast
north of Beirut almost daily for more than a month to prevent Aoun
from receiving war material from Iraq.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has declared support to Aoun's
``war of liberation'' against the 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in
predominantly Moslem Lebanese provinces under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing to
achieve their mandate by siding with Moslems against Christians in
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.

   The Public Broadcasting Service is trying to
balance the pro-Arab point of view of a documentary to be aired
during a special about the Palestinian uprising, The New York Times
reported today.
   PBS is spending $150,000 in additional documentary material and
analysis to accompany ``Days of Rage: The Young Palestinians,'' the
Times said. The film, which cost $180,000 to make last summer, has
stirred protest for being pro-Palestinian.
   Many journalists and critics who have seen ``Days of Rage'' say
it is one-sided but provides a perspective unusual for American
television.
   The 90-minute film about the uprising, known as the intefadeh,
has been shown in several screenings across the country. After one
postponement, it is scheduled for nationwide viewing Sept. 6 during
a PBS special called ``Intifada: The Palestinians and Israel.''
   Two other ``minidocumentaries'' _ one on the Israeli presence in
the occupied territories and the other on human rights abuses _ will
be broadcast during the 2{-hour special.
   Jo Franklin-Trout, the film's producer and director, called the
decision to develop additional footage ``intellectually dishonest.''
But she said a meeting Wednesday with John Sharnik, who is producing
the extra programming, was ``cordial.''
   Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith, said after seeing the film this week that it
is ``an inaccurate, biased documentary which lacks historical or
present perspective.''
   He said PBS is acting irresponsibly in showing it.
   Stella Giamassi, a spokeswoman for public television station
WNET, said about 70 percent of the 2,500 letters the station has
received protested the planned broadcast.

   The Foreign Ministry called in the U.S. ambassador
today and accused Congress of deliberately trying to undermine
relations with China by approving new trade sanctions.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Liu Huaqiu, an assistant to
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, expressed China's indignation and
delivered a strong protest to Ambassador James Lilley.
   The Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress,
China's legislature, issued a separate protest charging that
Congress ``willfully distorted the facts about China's efforts to
put an end to turmoil and quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion
in Beijing.''
   The protests were the latest in a series of recriminations
reflecting U.S. outrage over the Chinese army's crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters and Chinese outrage over any foreign
comment on its domestic politics. Relations have deteriorated to
their lowest level since the two countries established diplomatic
ties in 1979.
   Both the House of Representatives and the Senate separately
approved legislative amendments calling for a range of sanctions in
addition to President Bush's previous halt to military sales and
high-level exchanges.
   Among other things, both houses called for suspending the use of
U.S. funds to support trade with China. The Senate also called for
suspending satellite exports that would be launched by China and for
suspending nuclear cooperation.
   The amendments have yet to be signed into law.
   ``The two amendments ... slandered and attacked the Chinese
government in a groundless manner,'' Xinhua quoted Liu as telling
Lilley. The U.S. Embassy refused comment on Lilley's response.
   A separate Foreign Ministry statement read to reporters accused
Congress of ``pursuing power politics in a deliberate attempt to
harm Chinese-U.S. relations.''
   In Washington, 42 Republican senators signed a letter delivered
to the Chinese Embassy that predicted ``tremendous'' damage to
bilateral relations ``should your government continue on the course
of state-sponsored violence and intimidation on which you are
embarked.''
   But despite both sides' talk of damaged relations, an American
diplomat in Beijing said neither side wanted to end the relationship
altogether.
   ``There are some (Chinese) people, a small group of people, who
think the United States is a bad influence and want to see (the
influence) limited,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   On the American side, he said, there was a sense of
disillusionment because in the past, ``there was a kind of culture
that said the relationship was special.''
   At the Foreign Ministry's weekly news conference, spokeswoman Li
Jinhua denied that China plans to cut economic ties with the United
States and other countries that have criticized its crackdown.
   Ms. Li also said Chinese soldiers were ``acting according to
their orders and ... performing their normal tasks'' in searching
foreign diplomats' cars at checkpoints in Beijing and sometimes
sticking guns in their faces.
   ``Foreigners should abide by the orders issued by the martial law
enforcement troops,'' she said when asked if such searches were
legal.
   Military checkpoints go up around Beijing after midnight, and
several diplomats have reported that soldiers searched their cars in
apparent violation of international agreements on diplomatic
immunity.
   Ms. Li also maintained that China has not banned sales of all
foreign newspapers and magazines in Beijing, although she said she
could not name any foreign publications still allowed. Officials
went to hotels and stores in Beijing last week and took foreign
papers and magazines from newstands. None has been allowed on sale
since.
   ``We do not refuse all foreign books and magazines and
newspapers,'' the spokeswoman said. ``But we do not alow those
foreign magazines and newspapers whose content interferes in China's
internal affairs and hurts the national feelings of the Chinese
people to spread unchecked on Chinese soil. This is quite natural.''
   She refused to comment on the number of people arrested since the
crackdown on the protests began, or on persistent reports that
fugitive student leader Wang Dan has been arrested.

<HEAD>Grenada's New Ties With Taiwan Seen as a Slap at China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Grenada today established relations with
Taiwan, becoming the first nation to have relations with both the
Nationalist government in Taipei and the communist government in
China.
   The move was seen as a defeat for communist Chinese foreign
policy because it followed Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrations and because China asks countries that recognize it to
break relations with Taiwan.
   Grenada, the tiny island nation in the Carribean, established
relations with the communist government in China in 1985.
   There was no immediate reaction from Beijing to Grenada's move
today.
   Taiwan also used to demand that countries break relations with
China before establishing ties with Taipei. But in a break with the
past, Vice Foreign Minister Charles King said Taiwan did not ask
Grenada to sever ties with China as a condition because ``this is
not necessary.''
   King said Grenada decided to recognize Taiwan after the
communists began their crackdown.
   ``They reviewed their China policy and they believed the
establishment of official ties with us can help promote world peace
and freedom,'' King told a news conference.
   The international standing of the Nationalists has waned since
they lost a civil war to communist forces on the Chinese mainland in
1949. The U.S. rapprochement with China in the 1970s dealt a further
blow to Taiwan's status.
   The number of countries with formal ties to the Nationalist
government has dropped from more than 50 in 1949 to 23, while 135
countries recognize China. Grenada would be the 24th country to
recognize Taiwan.
   But since communist Chinese troops launched a crackdown in
Beijing, Taiwan has taken steps to take advantage of Beijing's loss
of international support.
   Grenada, with a population of 11,000, is a member of the British
Commonwealth and relies on agricultural exports and tourism.
   In 1983, U.S. Marines and Rangers and small force from six
Carribean nations invaded the island, deposing a Marxist regime.

   The government acquired the home of a
pair of tax resisters after the only bidders at an auction were
protesters whose offers ranged from toilet seats to food for the
poor.
   More than 300 people, many carrying banners and placards
denouncing military spending, gathered outside the Internal Revenue
Service office here Wednesday for the auction of the home of Randall
Kehler and his wife, Betsy Corner.
   The couple have not paid federal taxes in 12 years to protest the
federal government's military spending. Kehler is a founder of the
Nuclear Freeze campaign and its first national chairman.
   One group of protesters offered $21,414 worth of food and donated
services to the poor. Their canned goods were heaped on a truck next
to the IRS office.
   Bill Deters of Montague Center offered 10 toilet seats, which he
asserted would meet the $5,100 minimum bid if priced according to
U.S. Defense Department procurement standards. Other bids included a
guided tour of Nicaragua for Secretary of State James Baker.
   All 90 offers were rejected because they did not constitute legal
tender, said Robert Ruttenberg, an IRS spokesman. The government
acquired the home in the northwest Massachusetts town of Colrain for
the minimum bid of $5,100.
   The couple has six months to get their home back by paying
$27,000 in taxes, Ruttenberg said.
   But Kehler said they would not pay. He also promised that he, his
wife and their 9-year-old daughter would not comply with an eviction
order.
   Kehler said he and his wife have filed returns and donated the
money owed to local charities and peace groups. They have continued
to pay state and local taxes, he said.
   Ruttenberg said the number of tax resisters protesting military
spending has dropped to about 5,000 from about 22,000 in the early
1980s.

   Authorities put Burma's top opposition
leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest today after a day of
unrest in that country's capital, according to a Western embassy
report.
   The arrest came after police beat protesters Wednesday during a
holiday marking national independence. State radio said 44 other
people were reported arrested during the protests.
   Troops of the military government of Gen. Saw Maung surrounded
Ms. Suu Kyi's house in a suburb of the capital, Rangoon, and kept
her there, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. He got
his information from a report of a Western embassy in Rangoon that
he would not identify further.
   ``She tried to surrender herself to the military, but they
refused and they forced her back inside,'' said the source.
   He said a diplomat and Tin Oo, co-leader of Ms. Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy, went to see her, but they were turned
away.
   Other details were not immediately available. Operators said
telephone and telex lines to Rangoon from Bangkok were out of order
today.
   The source said the reason for the arrest of Ms. Suu Kyi, the
daughter of a celebrated independence leader, was unclear.
   He said the government may have used the violence during
Wednesday's Martyrs Day ceremonies as a pretext to move against her.
   He said her arrest may also be linked to those of three members
of her party. Authorities accused the three of bombing a government
oil refinery earlier this month in an attack that killed three
people.
   Ms. Suu Kyi is the most vocal critic of the authoritarian
government that has ruled under martial law since army commander Saw
Maung seized power in a coup in September and killed hundreds of
people to crush a nationwide campaign for democracy.
   Saw Maung has pledged to hold a general election by early next
year, and Western diplomats in Rangoon say authorities have been
increasingly concerned by Ms. Suu Kyi's growing popularity.
   ``Aung San Suu Kyi has been looking for a confrontation. Now it's
happened,'' the source in Bangkok said.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, 44, had vowed to lead thousands of people on a march
Wednesday to mark the day her father, Aung San, and other Burmese
independence leaders were assassinated in 1947. She canceled the
rally, however, to avoid bloodshed as troops flooded the streets of
the capital and erected barricades.
   The soldiers ``blocked off all the roads and prepared literally a
killing field for the people,'' said Ms. Suu Kyi in a telephone
interview from Bangkok Wednesday before her reported arrest.
   Witnesses said troops scattered hundreds of student demonstrators
who defied martial law. State-run radio reported 44 arrests.
   Ms. Suu Kyi said soldiers used sticks to beat some of the 3,000
student protesters in the capital's Swegondine district.
   A Western diplomat, also reached by telephone, said he saw
soldiers chase a group of students down a side street, drag some of
them out and hit them with sticks before putting 15 to 20 of them
into a truck.
   State radio said Wednesday night more than 1,400 people gathered
at seven areas of the city despite martial law. It said they
chanted, carried anti-government banners and distributed protest
literature while marching.
   A text of that broadcast was seen in Bangkok today.
   A heavily-guarded ceremony sponsored by the government was held
at the Martyrs Mausoleum without incident Wednesday morning, though
most opposition parties boycotted it.
   Also Wednesday, Briton David Storey, chief correspondent in
Bangkok for the Reuters news agency, said authorities expelled him
from the country.

   Typhoon Gordon left at least 17 people dead and
more than 100 injured when it slammed into southern China, cutting
communication lines and washing away roads and crops, the official
China Daily reported today.
   The paper said 13 people were missing and that damages totaled
about $27 million. The storm hit on Wednesday.
   Eight of the dead and 80 of the injured were in Yangjiang, one of
the hardest hit areas in coastal Guangdong province, the paper said.
   About 250 fishing boats capsized, 22 bridges collapsed and 156
miles of highway were washed away, the report said.
   Eight other people died in Zhaoqing in central Guangdong, and one
person was killed in the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, near Macao,
where most of the coastal dikes were destroyed and 4,200 acres of
sugar cane fields, rice paddies and fish ponds were flooded, the
paper said.
   Thousands of people in the provincial capital of Canton were
stranded and telecommunications were knocked out, it said.
   The nationally televised evening news on Wednesday showed footage
of waves crashing over sea walls, flooded streets and buildings with
only rooftops visible.
   The typhoon first hit the Philippines early Sunday with winds of
up to 116 mph, killing 32 people, injuring 43 and leaving almost
186,000 people homeless on the islands. It caused at least $30
million in damage, according to the Office of Civil Defense.
   Gordon's raging winds hit Hong Kong on Tuesday, killing one
person before moving on to Guangdong province.
   It was downgraded to a tropical storm Wednesday morning, the
State Meteorological Bureau said.

   A bid to save a 1950s-style car wash from the
wrecking ball by declaring it a cultural landmark didn't hold water
with the city's Cultural Heritage Commission.
   The commission on Wednesday voted to reject the designation for
the Unocal Gas Station and Car Wash, despite impassioned pleas from
an overflow crowd to save the car wash known for its 55-foot-long,
boomerang-shaped steel beams. Also rejected for landmark status was
a '50s-style coffee shop next door.
   The decision cleared the way for a developer to build a $15
million shopping center at the Studio City intersection.
   ``Our whole point is ... if you don't start making these things

Jack McGrath of Save Our Corner, a coalition of homeowners groups.

   A Canadian woman with a knife in her

outside the NBC-TV studio where ``The Tonight Show with Johnny

   Krystyna Marenchin, 39, of Ontario, was booked Wednesday for
investigation of violating a municipal code section against
loitering with a concealed weapon, Lt. Gordon Bowers said.
   ``There's no indication that she was trying to get to it or use
it,'' Bowers said of the knife. Officers found the souvenir-type
weapon _ with an engraved, 11-inch blade and a fancy sword hilt _
when she allowed them to search her backpack.
   Taping of the show wasn't disturbed. ``I doubt if Carson knew she
was there,'' Bowers said.

   Days after the Lotto America numbers were
drawn for a $39.8 million jackpot, three Connecticut residents knew
they had the winning ticket but thought it was so badly damaged it
might be rejected.
   Two of the three tickets purchased by Sheila E. Phillips, her
boyfriend, George H. Brown, and George Mages, were destroyed when a
can of whipped cream exploded in the cooler the ticket was sitting
in. Only the winning ticket survived.
   ``The ticket was mangled and we all said `Gee, I wonder if
they're going to take the ticket?''' said Brown, 46, of Montville,
Conn. All three are managers at the General Dynamics Electric Boat
division in Groton, Conn.
   Their numbers were drawn Saturday in the lottery, which is played
in six states and the District of Columbia. The trio turned the
ticket in Wednesday to the Rhode Island Lottery Commission to claim
the prize.
   The three were visiting friends in West Warwick, R.I., when they
bought tickets at Haxton's Package Store shortly before the numbers
were drawn Saturday night.
   Phillips found out Monday night she had the winning numbers, but
the trio waited until Wednesday to turn in the ticket so they could
bring a lawyer along.
   The prize was the largest in Lotto America history and the fourth
largest lottery jackpot won in the United States on a single ticket,
according to lottery executive director Peter J. O'Connell.
   Each of the three will receive $664,333 annually for the next 20
years. They said they will quit their jobs.
   States participating in Lotto America are Iowa, Missouri, Kansas,
Oregon, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
   None of the three had immediate plans for their share of the
fortune.
   In other lotteries:
   _Nine weeks of waiting ended in Pennsylvania when lottery
officials announced Wednesday that two winning tickets had been sold
for a Super 7 jackpot worth at least $60 million.
   The prize is the second largest in the state lottery's history
and the fourth largest nationwide.
   _Two players correctly picked all six numbers in the California
Lottery's ``Lotto 6-49'' game held Wednesday night and will split an
$11.03 million jackpot, state lottery officials said.
   The two winners will take home $5,515,173 each.
   The winners in Pennsylvania and California have not been
identified.

<HEAD>Bush, Shamir Exchanged Letters, White House Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-US-PLO Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House says President Bush has
exchanged letters with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
re-emphasized the U.S. desire to ``continue the peace process'' in
the Middle East.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's letter, sent
before the president went to Europe on July 9, strongly endorsed
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's statements on the peace
process.
   Baker has urged Israel to accept territorial compromise and to
stop further Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Fitzwater confirmed Wednesday that Bush had written Shamir,
saying the letter ``re-emphasized our general position and our
desire to continue the peace process.''
   He said Bush received a reply from Shamir, but he refused to
characterize it.
   Baker, in a May 22 speech, cautioned Israel that ``the United
States does not support annexation or permanent Israeli control of
the West Bank and Gaza'' and also opposes ``the creation of an
independent Palestinian state.''
   Asked by reporters if the Bush letter was a defense of Baker,
Fitzwater said the U.S. position ``was well-represented by Secretary
Baker in all of his public discussions.''
   ``We think Secretary Baker's many discussions on this issue have
been in the interest of the peace process. We have welcomed the
elections proposal of Prime Minister Shamir as a concept that could
lead to broader peace efforts and we would like to ... see that
process move forward,'' Fitzwater said.
   Shamir, under pressure from political rivals in his Likud Party,
recently supported a hard-line party plan to restrict Arab residents
of East Jerusalem from voting in proposed elections in the occupied
territories.
   Shamir proposed elections in April.
   U.S. officials have said both the Likud-backed restrictions and
Palestinian preconditions could undermine the elections.

<DATELINE>NOVOKUZNETSK, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikes by tens of thousands of
miners in this Siberian coal region spread to four more of the
Soviet Union's coal fields, Tass reported today.
   The official news agency said coal miners in Vorkuta in the far
north, the Don River city of Rostov in southwestern Russia and the
Ukrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk walked out Wednesday.
   Miners in the Karaganda region in Soviet Central Asia today
refused to work, Tass said. By evening, 14 mines in the region, home
of the country's third-largest coal fields, were reported at a
standstill.
   Tass said their demands were similar to those of striking miners
in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basins, who are seeking greater
local control over their industries and better wages and living
conditions.
   Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, are
the country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the
country's worst labor unrest since the 1920s. Novokuznetsk is a
major city in the Kuznetsk region, where the strikes began 10 days
ago.
   The government has acknowledged that living and working
conditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has made
general pledges of improvements.
   Tass reported Wednesday that some miners in Siberia had returned
to work after the government made pay concessions.
   The government also has promised to send extra meat, butter,
sugar, tea, leather shoes, furniture and cars to relieve shortages
in the region, the Communist Youth League newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda said today.
   But the newspaper and Tass reported more disturbances in the
Ukraine. Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a communist official in the
Donetsk city of Makeyevka as saying, ``The scale of the strike is
growing. Practically all the coal enterprises of the city have
stopped work.''
   Miners in Vorkuta, Rostov and Dnepropetrovsk all walked off the
job on Wednesday, Tass said.
   In Vorkuta, strikers sent a letter to the Kremlin asking for an
``urgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problems of the
coal sector, and also specific problems of workers of the far
north,'' Tass said.
   In Rostov, miners' economic demands included extra pay for
evening and night shifts, longer vacations and an increase in the
price of coal to world market prices, the news agency reported.
   In Dnepropetrovsk, which is 150 miles from Donetsk, workers'
demands mirrored those of Donetsk and Kuznetsk miners.
   In Karaganda, strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete
news accounts of miners' demands in the Kuznetsk strikes, according
to Tass.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday the strikes could
imperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workers
being urged to strike.
   He said that if labor trouble spreads, ``We may have to take such
extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing'' to
overhaul the economy through greater attention to free-market
mechanisms.
   He did not elaborate.
   Strikes are rare in the Soviet Union and were ended by force
before Gorbachev gained power in March 1985.
   Tass today said that the Kuznetsk strike had reached ``a turning
point,'' with nine out of 11 mining centers back at work.
   It was not known how many more employees were back on the job
today. On Wednesday, Tass said that 24,000 strikers in Kuznetsk were
back at work and 150,000 remained on strike.
   State television said Wednesday that the strike in the Donetsk
basin had spread to 70 of its 120 mines, more than triple the
previous number, and that mine construction workers had joined.
   In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, television said
steel and coke-chemical plants were ``on the verge of a stoppage''
for lack of coal.
   Earlier reports in the official press had said operations at
steel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal and
coke.
   Gorbachev told the national legislature Wednesday that the
strikes had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal.
   The government has agreed to most miner demands, including those
on pensions and overtime, Gorbachev said. But he said that settling
some longer-term issues would take up to a month.
   Tass outlined a concessions package that includes bonus pay to
night shifts and for men using jackhammers.
   Strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortages of
consumer goods and food, and the government has made general pledges
of improvements in those areas.

   A two-pound premature baby who had been
declared dead began crying just moments before a funeral home worker
arrived to pick up her body.
   ``The hair just stood up on the back of my neck. By the time the
funeral home got there, we had her in the nursery and stabilized and
on a respirator,'' said Dr. Lynn Brouilette, the doctor who had
pronounced the baby dead.
   Katina Payton, 17, gave birth to the unnamed child about 5 a.m.
Wednesday in Natchitoches Parish Hospital. The baby had trouble
breathing, Brouilette said. He said he spent 20 minutes trying to
resuscitate her before giving up because there was no noticeable
heartbeat.
   The baby was taken to Schumpert Medical Center's neonatal
intensive care unit, where she was in critical condition, a nurse
said.

<HEAD>Benjamin Tammuz, Author and Sculptor, Dies at 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Benjamin Tammuz, a prominent Russian-born
Israeli author, sculptor and proponent of Jewish-Arab coexistence,
has died at age 70.
   Israeli news reports said his death Wednesday was caused by
cancer and that he had kept his illness secret from most of his
friends.
   Tammuz was known as one of Israel's foremost modern writers whose
books contained humorous and introspective portrayals of Israel's
pioneer generation.
   He published dozens of books, short stories and satirical columns
in the prestigious Haaretz daily. Among the most popular is a
humorous sketch of pioneer days called ``The Life of Elyakum.''
   He was also among the leaders of the defunct Canaanite Movement,
which left-wing poets and artists began before Israel's founding in
1948. The movement sought a way of forging Jewish-Arab cooperation.
   The Canaanites wanted to build a new ``Hebrew'' nation, as
opposed to a Jewish one, to circumvent conflict with the Arabs.
   The biblical name came from ancient Canaan, the promised land of
the Israelites who subjugated it after their flight from Egypt.
   The movement never gained support in Israel and is now mostly
credited for its important role in transforming biblical Hebrew into
a modern language.
   In his last televised interview about a week ago, Tammuz
suggested that the 19-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories had reinvigorated his Canaanite beliefs.
   Tammuz studied history at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1950-51 and
later edited ``Art in Israel,'' a survey of Israeli art trends in
the 1960s.
   He was a sculptor and participated in numerous group shows.
   He designed a monument to fallen Israeli pilots which is now at
Tel Aviv's Independence Park.
   Tammuz will be buried Thursday in Holon, a suburb of his Tel Aviv
hometown.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with strikes easing, ADDS congratulations

<TEXT>
   An opposition newspaper said today that
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski would have lost the presidency in a popular
election, but opposition lawmakers said Jaruzelski's leadership is
necessary to continue reforms.
   Elected to the newly powerful presidency by the slimmest margin
possible, Jaruzelski now faces the challenge of trying to salvage a
crippled economy.
   His task was exacerbated by strikes in the southern province of
Katowice. The strikes eased today with the signing of a new pay
agreement, but many workers reportedly rejected it and stayed off
the job.
   Jaruzelski's Communist coalition controls 300 seats in the
560-seat parliament, but because some in the coalition voted against
him, a boycott by some opposition legislators may have been the key
to Jaruzelski's win.
   Jaruzelski, the Communist Party chief, needed 270 votes to win.
The final tally was 270-to-233, with 34 abstentions.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a spokesman for
President Bush sent congratulatory messages today to Jaruzelski.
   ``Wojciech Jaruzelski is deeply respected in the Soviet Union as
the initiator of the policy of national accord and socialist
renovation,'' said Gorbachev's message, transmitted by the Soviet
news agency Tass.
   In Washington, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in
congratulating Jaruzelski, ``Our only concern is to see the
political and economic reform process go forward.''
   A commentary in the opposition newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza
attributed Jaruzelski's win to what it called a symbolic single vote
cast by Lech Walesa last week, when he said the president should
come from the Communist coalition.
   It said in a popular vote, Walesa, the leader of the Solidarity
trade union movement, would have been the winner.
   ``What then is the result of this election for ordinary people in
Poland, those who stand in lines and with horror think about the
landslide of rising prices? Nothing,'' read the commentary.
   ``But these people will submit their bill to the deputies and
senators, to the generals and ministers, and to the president, if
the process of rescuing the country from ruin is not started.''
   The general, who has has led the country eight years and promises
to oversee a transition to democracy, was the only candidate
Wednesday.
   Some Solidarity lawmakers displayed their paper ballots to TV
cameras as they voted to show they were against Jaruzelski. Many of
them had been imprisoned during Jaruzelski's 1981 martial law
crackdown on the union.
   Opposition lawmakers who did not vote said they could not openly
endorse Jaruzelski, but they said defeating him could undermine
reforms.
   ``It is a great relief,'' said opposition Sen. Karol Modzelewski
of Wroclaw. ``We would have been in real trouble if he did not make
it.''
   As president, Jaruzelski now constitutionally controls the
military and foreign relations and must nominate a prime minister to
assemble a new government with parliamentary approval. It is a
six-year term.
   The government will have to contend with a deteriorating economy.
Inflation is heading for 160 percent and food shortages are
worsening.
   Poland's state-run PAP news agency said a two-day strike by
11,000 transit workers in the southern province of Katowice ended
today with the signing of a new pay agreement that raised hourly pay.
   But the Solidarity Information Service in Warsaw said workers in
10 out of 17 bus depots rejected the agreement and were continuing
their strikes.
   In the Baltic port of Gdynia, a strike by shipyard workers ended
late Wednesday after one day.
   ``An ocean of problems is ahead of us,'' Jaruzelski told
parliament in a brief, restrained speech moments after taking the
oath of office. ``Material conditions ... must dictate the
priorities of action. They are more important and urgent than
anything else.''
   Jaruzelski said a new government must be organized ``as soon as
possible.''
   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski already has
submitted its resignation, and it is conceivable the next government
could be drawn at least partly from the opposition.
   The election of a president was the last step in meeting accords
that Communist authorities forged with Solidarity in April after
labor unrest prompted them to seek the cooperation of the opposition.
   In the course of three months of talks, Solidarity regained its
legal status after a seven-year ban; the country's freest elections
in 40 years were held; and the opposition won all but one of the
parliamentary seats it was allowed to contest.
   Immediately after the election, Walesa sent a letter of
congratulations to the general, emphasizing that the opposition
expects him to continue with democratic reform.
   ``My wish for you is that the time you are given to perform this
office will be a stage in the history of our homeland effectively
leading to freedom and democracy and to regaining Poland's proper
position in Europe,'' the message said.
   Jaruzelski promised Solidarity lawmakers before the election that
he would give up the post of Communist Party first secretary if
elected president.
   It was unclear if he intended to resign immediately or to hold
both posts temporarily.

<HEAD>Teacher Union Leaders Express Concern About Growing Teen Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly three-quarters of teacher union leaders
say they are increasingly concerned about teen-age violence and
gang-related activities, the American Federation of Teachers
reported today.
   More than 80 percent of those surveyed by the AFT said easy
access to drugs was among the factors ``very responsible'' for the
problem. Some 65 percent cited easy access to guns.
   Drug trafficking, lack of parental supervision and lack of
employment opportunities were also identified as major factors.
   The top five solutions favored by the teachers were improved
support systems for families, improved community organizations, more
money for education and recreation facilities for teen-agers, more
stringent gun control laws and mandatory school-site security
personnel.
   Fewer than half of those surveyed favored installing metal
detectors in schools, with many citing the enormous cost of such a
move.
   Sandra Feldman, president of the AFT affiliate in New York City,
said school violence is still the exception rather than the rule.
But she said 82 percent of survey respondents said teen-age violence
is a bigger problem now than it used to be, and ``if that's not a
warning, I don't know what is.''
   The 710,000-member AFT represents education personnel in most of
the nation's urban areas. For its survey it questioned
representatives of its 50 largest locals, the 43 presidents of AFT
state units, and the union's 38-member executive council.

<TEXT>
   A former civilian worker for the Army was
convicted today of conspiring with a U.S. soldier to sell American
military secrets to East German and Soviet agents.
   The guilty verdict against Huseyin Yildirim, 61, was returned by
a U.S. District Court jury after about six hours of deliberations
over two days.
   Yildirim, a Turkish-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, was charged
with conspiring with Warrant Officer James William Hall III to sell
classified information to Eastern bloc agents between 1983 and 1988,
when Hall was stationed in Germany and New Jersey.
   Yildirim was working as a civilian mechanic at an Army auto shop
in Germany at the time.
   The trial was held in Savannah because Hall was stationed at
nearby Fort Stewart at the time of his arrest last December.
   Hall pleaded guilty at a court-martial in March and was sentenced
to 40 years in prison.
   In closing arguments Wednesday, defense lawyer Lamar Walter
argued that Hall was solely to blame for the espionage.
   ``The evidence you heard is sufficient to convict him (Hall), but
not my man,'' Walter said. ``Mr. Hall is very definitely a guilty
man. The man is not capable of being believed.''
   Walter called no witnesses after Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred
Kramer rested the government's case Wednesday morning.
   Defense experts say the espionage scheme damaged U.S.
intelligence efforts in Europe. Hall worked as an analyst of
intercepted radio and telephone traffic and coded messages.
   Kramer, in his closing argument, contended that the evidence
showed overwhelmingly that Yildirim was Hall's contact, that he
carried documents to the Soviets and East Germans and that he
returned with money.
   Before resting his case, Kramer elicited testimony from FBI
espionage expert Nicholas J. Walsh that a ``Dear Friend'' letter
found among Yildirim's property in Berlin included a ``shopping list
... a list of things they would like. ... You would probably be paid
the most for it.''
   Testimony said Yildirim's fingerprint was found on the unsigned
letter. FBI agents testified Tuesday that Yildirim's fingerprints
also were on two $50 bills found in Hall's truck.
   FBI agents seized the bills, a phony passport and military
intelligence documents at Hall's home and from his truck in Richmond
Hill, Ga., when he was arrested Dec. 20, evidence showed.
   Other incriminating evidence was taken from Yildirim's home in
Belleair Beach, Fla., later the same morning, FBI agents said.
   Hall appeared in the courtroom during the trial, which began
Monday, but did not testify in person.
   In a videotape played for the jury Tuesday, Hall told FBI agent
Dimitry Droujinsky he was lured into the spy game by money.
   ``I wasn't terribly short of money,'' Hall told the agent, who
was posing as a Soviet agent named Vladimir. ``I just decided I
didn't ever want to worry where my next dollar was coming from. ...
What I wanted to be able to do was to afford some of the things I
wanted.''
   Investigators began probing Hall's affairs when evidence showed
he was living above his income of $20,200.

<TEXT>
   Three federal judges have ordered Louisiana to
replace four governing boards with one in a package of sweeping
reforms to desegregate the state's 17 public colleges and
universities.
   ``The present scheme for governing education in Louisiana _ three
operating boards and one coordinating board _ has perpetuated
illegal segregation in Louisiana's higher education,'' the judges
said Wednesday.
   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed 15 years ago by the U.S.
Justice Department. It closely followed recommendations made in May
by Paul Verkuil, president of the College of William &amp; Mary, who was
appointed by the judges to conduct hearings and write a
desegregation plan.
   The five-year plan would create of a single board to govern
higher education, restrict admissions at some universities, limit
degree programs most can offer and establish a community college
system.
   Currently, one board governs the Louisiana State University
system, another governs the mostly black Southern University system
and a third governs the others. All three boards answer to the State
Board of Regents for Higher Education.
   The court gave the state 30 days to replace the four governing
boards with a new 17-member board. The governor will appoint the
members, pending Senate confirmation. The court declined to set a
ratio of white-to-black members.
   The Southern University board of supervisors will meet July 29 in
Baton Rouge to discuss an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
could delay the plan's implementation.
   The plan was recommended by Gov. Buddy Roemer when he took office
in 1988.
   ``The state has won. The people have won. I believe we have Buddy
Roemer and three judges to thank,'' said John Kennedy, Roemer's
lawyer in the case.
   The order would designate Louisiana State University in Baton
Rouge as the unified system's flagship university, with the greatest
number of graduate and research programs.
   It also calls for creation of an intermediate level of
institutions _ which includes Southern _ offering significant
doctoral and other graduate programs, and for gradually merging the
LSU law school and the Southern University law school, both in Baton
Rouge.
   The state's remaining four-year colleges would be designated
comprehensive universities with limited graduate or research
missions and less-selective or open admissions.
   The order was written by 5th U.S. Circuit Court Judge John M.
Wisdom, U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz and District Judge
Veronica Wicker.
   Reaction to the order varied.
   ``I would think that the (merger of) Southern law school is a
real big problem for the board and for the black community. It's a
matter that needs to be modified,'' said state Sen. William
Jefferson, a black New Orleans lawyer who represents the Southern
University system.
   Kennedy said the plan has great potential to desegregate. ``I
think a single system and a selective admissions policy in some
schools to move students around will help desegregate.''
   John McKeithen, who left the LSU Board last year and was the
first governor to champion desegregation, was skeptical.
   ``I don't think it's going to work. For the life of me, I don't
know any way to make a white go to Grambling or a black go to
Louisiana Tech,'' McKeithen said, referring to two state colleges.

   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi landed in a U.S.
jail after being extradited from Switzerland and pleading innocent
to charges of helping Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos plunder $100
million from the Philippines.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Keenan said at Wednesday's hearing
that he ``wouldn't dream of setting bail'' until Khashoggi's worth
is verified.
   Once among the world's richest men, Khashoggi was said to be the
middleman in the Iran-Contra deal.
   The former fugitive, handcuffed and wearing a green walking suit,
did not talk with reporters before leaving Kennedy International
Airport with FBI agents. But in a statement released by his lawyer,
Khashoggi said he intends to contest the charges and is confident
that ``my innocence will be clearly established.''
   Khashoggi's attorney, Robert Morvillo, had asked that bail be set
no higher than the $5 million bond granted Mrs. Marcos.
   Khashoggi's assets have dwindled recently as various holdings
have been sold. ``I read in the newspapers, like everyone else, that
he's a very rich man, but I don't know that,'' the judge said.
   ``I think your honor can assume that he's an enormously wealthy
man,'' Morvillo said.
   Instead of jail, Morvillo suggested that Khashoggi be put under
house arrest at his luxury apartment on Fifth Avenue. He said
Khashoggi could pay for private security guards deputized by the
court to watch him.
   Keenan laughed at the idea but said he would keep in mind
Morvillo's arguments in favor of bail.
   U.S. Assistant Attorney Charles LaBella opposed bail and house
arrest, saying he had learned that creditors were about to foreclose
on the apartment.
   In October, a federal grand jury in New York indicted Khashoggi,
the Marcoses, five other people and the California Overseas Bank in
Los Angeles.
   The Marcoses were charged with stealing millions from the
Philippines to buy real estate and art in New York. Khashoggi
allegedly posed as the owner of some of the assets as a cover.
   Khashoggi, 53, had been jailed in Switzerland since his April 18
arrest at a luxury hotel in Bern. But Swiss officials denied
extradition for racketeering and conspiracy charges because they're
not recognized under Swiss law. He was arraigned Wednesday on mail
fraud and obstruction of justice.
   He faces up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine.
   Khashoggi, who once traveled the globe in his private yacht and
plane, spent the last three months in a 30-square-foot prison cell
fighting extradition.
   He is said to have been a major financier and middleman of the
Iran-Contra affair, in which proceeds of secret U.S. arms sales to
Iran were channeled to rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government. He has acknowledged a role in the deal and
said he lost $10 million on it.
   Khashoggi also has been named in several kickback scandals, and
has had financial problems that led one of his companies to file for
protection under bankruptcy law. His arrest in Switzerland marked
the first time that he was ever jailed.
   A U.S. diplomatic note asking that Khashoggi be arrested cited
four buildings in Manhattan and a collection of paintings that
disappeared from a Manila museum, Swiss authorities said.
   Khashoggi's lawyers two weeks ago announced they planned to
appeal the extradition. But the Swiss Justice Ministry statement
said Khashoggi changed his mind at a recent hearing. His lawyers
gave no explanation for the change of heart.

<HEAD>Mozambique Refugees Flee Clash in Which Dozens Reported Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today said 567
Mozambican refugees fled across the border to escape a gunbattle
between guerrillas and government troops in which dozens of people
were reported killed.
   One person drowned in the Komati River while trying to reach
South Africa, said police Capt. Ruben Bloomberg at police
headquarters in Pretoria.
   Bloomberg said the number of people killed on the other side of
the border, at Ressano Garcia, was unknown.
   But government-run Radio South Africa said witnesses reported
dozens of people were killed when Mozambique National Resistance
guerrillas fired small arms and mortars at Mozambican government
soldiers in Ressano Garcia.
   Refugees frequently have fled across the river into South Africa
at the Ressano Garcia border point when attacked by guerrillas.
   Bloomberg was quoted by the South African Press Association as
saying the refugees were held overnight and released today without
being charged. He said most had returned to Mozambique.
   Bloomberg said the cause of the Wednesday night gunbattle was
unknown.
   The Noticias newspaper in Mozambique reported that the guerrillas
killed 82 peasants, including children, and wounded 111 in an attack
Tuesday night on Sanguane village, in the southern province of Gaza.
   The newspaper said some people escaped and notified soldiers
nearby, who killed 20 guerrillas at Sanguane and captured some
weapons.
   The Ressano Garcia fighting occurred a few hours after the leader
of South Africa's governing National Party, F.W. de Klerk, returned
from a meeting in Maputo with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano.
   They discussed Mozambican accusations that the guerrillas still
receive support and supplies from inside South Africa.
   Chissano said he accepted that the South African government and
military were no longer giving such support, and de Klerk said the
South African government would investigate any specific details that
Mozambique provided.

<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Afghanistan's
Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla faction alleged today that the leader of a
rival faction ordered the massacre last week of 30 Jamiat rebels.
   Mohammad Shaoib said Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of the
Hezb-e-Islami rebel group, should be tried under Islamic law for his
alleged role in the slayings in northern Afghanistan.
   Hekmatyar denied the allegation and said in a statement
distributed by the rebel-controlled Afghan News Agency, ``We not
only discourage but hate such a strife or feud among the mujahedeen,
and I strongly condemn those persons who committed this heinous
offence against their own Afghan brethren.''
   Hekmatyar heads one of two Hezb-e-Islami rebel groups
headquartered in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar. His
hard-line fundamentalist group is at odds with Shaoib's faction,
which also is based in Pakistan.
   Shaoib said the 30 guerrillas, seven of whom were key Jamiat
commanders, were returning July 9 from a military strategy meeting
with Jamiat's key commander, Ahmad Shah Masoud, in the northern
province of Takhar.
   They were ambushed by Hezb-e-Islami commander Said Jamal, and
five were killed immediately and 25 were later executed, Shaoib
alleged.
   Sixteen ``mutilated'' bodies were returned to Jamiat forces in
northern Afghanistan, said Shaoib.
   ``All those who were involved should be tried...Hekmatyar gave
the order so he is involved,'' Shaoib said in a news release.
   Guerrilla sources said the killings are part of a bloody power
struggle that has been going on between the two guerrilla groups in
northern Afghanistan since the civil war began 11 years ago.
   The Moslem insurgents are fighting to oust the Soviet-backed
government in Kabul and set up an Islamic republic. Until February,
Soviet troops were helping the Afghan government troops. They
withdrew under a U.N.-mediated accord.
   Scores of rebels have been killed in clashes between the
guerrilla groups, according to rebel sources.

<HEAD>Panel Puts Off Decision to Investigate House GOP Whip</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 7 grafs new with comments on Gingrich, Savage; picks up
at pvs 4th graf, ``The committee''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House ethics committee said
today the panel was not ready to decide whether to launch an
investigation of Republican Whip Newt Gingrich.
   Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the committee was taking no
action ``on anything on the calendar today,'' but added ``there was
a strong likelihood'' the panel could meet next week.
   The panel's first step in an investigation of Gingrich, R-Ga.,
who engineered a controversial book deal, would be to order a
preliminary inquiry.
   The committee's ranking Republican, Rep. John T. Myers of
Indiana, said before the panel's closed-door meeting, ``I don't
think there will be a decision on any of the issues before the
August recess,'' which begins in about two weeks.
   Dixon, who said the committee has three or four items on its
agenda, also said he has received a letter from the State Department
concerning Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill.
   On Wednesday, three House members asked the committee to
investigate an accusation that Savage sexually assaulted a Peace
Corps volunteer while on an official trip to Zaire. Dixon said the
State Department letter was ``an assertion of what they believe to
be the facts.''
   Gingrich filed the complaint that led to the investigation of
former House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned in June after the
committee charged him with 69 rules violations.
   The committee was also considering whether to hire an outside
lawyer for the Gingrich probe as it did in the former speaker's case.
   Chicago attorney Richard J. Phelan, who handled the Wright case,
said this week he has discussed with the panel the possibility of
performing a similar role if an investigation of Gingrich is
approved.
   A complaint by Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark. filed last April
alleged that Gingrich, the second-ranking House Republican, may have
violated campaign finance laws and House rules on outside income and
receipt of gifts.
   The complaint focused on a partnership in which 21 investors put
up $5,000 each to promote ``Window of Opportunity'' _ a book
authored by Gingrich, his wife and a third writer.
   The ethics committee also received in June a request from House
Republicans for an investigation of Rep. Donald ``Buz'' Lukens,
R-Ohio. He is appealing his conviction on a charge of contributing
to the unruliness and delinquency of a minor.
   After a Franklin County, Ohio, jury found Lukens had sex with a
16-year-old girl in his Columbus apartment, he was sentenced June 30
to 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine for the misdemeanor
conviction. He is free on bond and continues to perform his
congressional duties.
   
   The committee _ officially the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct _ this week has a new member in Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa,
replacing Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., who resigned from the panel.
   ``Newt Gingrich is one of my friends,'' Grandy told reporters.
``The fact that he's a Republican leader adds a little bit of
political heat to it. He gets no more or no less justice than any
other member of Congress.''

<HEAD>Delta Says Pilots at Fault in Texas Crash That Killed 14</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines took responsibility for the crash
of a Boeing 727, saying crew error led to the tragedy that killed 14
people at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport last summer.
   ``The flight crew failed to set the aircraft's flaps and slats in
the proper takeoff configuration as required by established Delta
practices and procedures,'' the airline said in a statement from its
Atlanta headquarters Wednesday.
   Flight 1141, carrying 108 people, rolled from side to side and
got no more than 30 feet off the runway before crashing Aug. 31 on
takeoff in a grassy field near the runway.
   The airline said Wednesday that the members of the flight crew
``are no longer flying with Delta.''
   The crew members were fired Tuesday after being called to the
Delta chief pilot's office in Dallas, said Capt. Jim Gray, spokesman
for the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Larry Davis, the pilot, and Steven Judd, the flight engineer, had
no comment Wednesday on Delta's announcement, said women answering
telephones at their Dallas-area homes. No phone listing was found
for co-pilot Carey Wilson Kirkland Jr.
   Delta spokesman Jim Lundy said the airline's investigation was
conducted separately from a National Transportation Safety Board
probe of the crash. He said Delta expects the NTSB to release its
conclusions in late summer or early fall.
   In NTSB hearings in November, the three crew members admitted
certain technical violations of Delta regulations had occurred as
they prepared for takeoff, but said they made all necessary
pre-flight preparations.
   Attorneys for crash victims said they were glad Delta accepted
blame for the crash but added that doesn't mean their clients' legal
action is finished.
   ``It will certainly expedite the cases,'' said Windle Turley, a
Dallas lawyer representing at least eight passengers who were aboard
Delta Flight 1141. ``If a case was going to take 18 months maybe now
it will be done in a year.''

<HEAD>Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, French Resistance Leader, Dies at 79</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, a French Resistance hero
who was once smuggled out of the country in a mailbag to escape the
Nazis, died today in a Paris military hospital, friends reported.
She was 79.
   Mrs. Fourcade was admitted to the Val de Grace hospital on July
3. No cause of death was given.
   When France fell to the Germans in 1940, rs. Fourcade and a few
friends organized a resistance group called Alliance, which
eventually numbered about 3,000. Of that number, one-third were
jailed or killed by the Germans.
   Mrs. Fourcade's group relied on radio operators to collect and
pass on information from France, Spain, Italy and Germany to British
intelligence.
   The Germans caught her four times, but she was released or
escaped each time.
   Navy Capt. Jean Boutron, who smuggled her out of France one time
in a mail sack, once said: ``She was terribly feminine, but she has
more willpower than most men.''
   She slipped away to London in the summer of 1943 but returned in
June 1944, the same month the Allies launched their invasion of
France.
   Each of her agents took the name of an animal, and she was known
as Hedgehog. In 1968, she published a book about her experiences
entitled ``Noah's Ark.''
   Mrs. Fourcade, who was born Marie-Madeleine Bridou on Nov. 8,
1909 in Marseille, spent many years in China, where her father was a
shipping agent. She was educated at a convent school and the Ecole
Normale de Musique.
   Following the war, she helped found President Charles de Gaulle's
Union for the New Republic Party.
   ``After the war, she consecrated herself to prolonging the spirit
of the Resistance and fought all forms of totalitarian regimes in
loyalty to her patriotic and Gaullist convictions,'' said Dr. Leon
Boutbien, president of the Union of Resistance and Deportation.
   ``She leaves behind her the memory of a courageous, dedicated
woman who would not accept compromise with the defense of
liberties.''
   When the war was over, she divorced her first husband, an army
officer, and married industrialist Hubert Fourcade. She had five
children
   Funeral services were set for 11 a.m. Monday at the Invalides in
Paris.

<TEXT>
   Archaeologists trying to piece together a
story of cannibalism by a gold prospecting party in 1874 have found
the remains of four bodies in a mass grave.
   ``The working hypothesis today _ tomorrow I may change my mind _
is that we have a minimum of four individuals represented,'' Walter
Birkby, physical anthropology curator at Arizona State Museum in
Tucson, said at the excavation site.
   He is one of a team examining the expedition, whose organizer and
sole survivor, Alferd Packer, admitted eating his five colleagues
but said he killed only one of them, and in self-defense.
   Analysis of the bones for evidence of cannibalism will take some
time in a laboratory after the excavation is completed.
   Found with the bones were quantities of burlap and a green
suspender clip holding remnants of brown cloth, two hard rubber
buttons and two badly corroded metal buttons, the scientists said.
   Birkby said scientists decided that four bodies were represented
based on duplicate bones discovered and the arrangement of some
bones that were uncovered, such as arm bones arranged adjacent to a
shoulder bone.
   ``The cloth is most remarkable,'' archaeologist Jim Ayres said.
``It could help us put a date on things.''
   Birkby said Wednesday's findings suggest the bodies of the men
were wrapped in burlap and buried in a mass grave.
   Packer, who formed a gold-hunting party of five other men, said
the group became stranded on a snow-packed mountain ridge two miles
south of Lake City. He claimed Shannon Bell, a member of the party,
killed the other four gold-seekers, and that he was forced to kill
Bell in self-defense. Packer also admitted to consuming the remains
of the five men in order to survive.
   He was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to serve 40 years
in prison.
   George Washington University law professor James Starrs organized
the archaeologists' search for the truth about what occurred.

   Motorcyclists firing guns roared
through this southern city and killed six people in an attack
spurred by ethnic tensions, police said today.
   The violence occurred Wednesday night, and the city was under
curfew today. Residents were told they would be shot if caught
violating the curfew.
   Troops in jeeps with mounted machine guns were patrolling the
streets warning people to remain inside, witnesses said.
   The shooting occurred in an area of the city dominated by
immigrants who arrived from India after Pakistan and India were
partitioned in 1947, police said. They said 20 people were injured.
   The immigrants, who call themselves Mohajirs, want to be
recognized as a fifth ethnic group in Pakistan.
   Hyderbad is 95 miles north of the port city of Karachi, which
also has been hit with ethnic violence.
   Most of the clashes have involved Mohajirs; Pathans, the ethnic
majority in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province; and Sind
Nationalists, who want greater autonomy for the southern Sind
province.
   Most of the clashes have occurred in Karachi and Hyderabad, the
two largest cities in Sind.

   A Vermont Supreme Court justice ordered to
retire because he turned 70 can remain on the bench under federal
law prohibiting age discrimination, a federal judge said in a ruling
released today.
   The Vermont Constitution requires all judges to retire at the end
of the year in which they turn 70.
   But Justice Louis Peck, who turned 70 in December, refused to
retire, saying federal law superseded the state constitutional
provision. The state attorney general's office agreed with Peck.
   The state filed suit to force Peck off the bench. But U.S.
District Judge Lee Gagliardi said Peck can remain on the job.
   Peck said today he was extremely pleased by the decision, but
added: ``That's the battle. It is not the war.
   ``It is very likely there will be an appeal,'' said Peck. ``I
expect the state will appeal, and we will have to wait for that.''
   William Gray, a Burlington lawyer who represented the state in
the case, said he had just received the decision and was not
prepared to comment.
   Previously Gray and lawyers for Peck had said an appeal to the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was probable no matter which way
Gagliardi decided.
   The lawyers have said the issue is not likely to be settled until
the U.S Supreme Court rules on the question. The 1st U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which has no jurisdiction over Vermont, ruled
against a justice in a Massachusetts case last year.
   The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which prohibits
mandatory retirement provisions, contains exceptions: elected
officers; the personal staff of elected officers and policymaking
appointees.
   The 1st Circuit, ruling in the Massachusetts case, found that
judges are policymakers.
   But Gagliardi specifically disagreed with that ruling.
   ``A judge's principal activity is to decide cases between
litigants,'' he said.
   Gagliardi is himself 70. He is one of roughly 300 federal judges
on senior status. They are semi-retired, determine their own
workload and handle about 15 percent of federal cases.
   Peck is one of five justices on the state Supreme Court,
Vermont's highest court and only appeals court. He was appointed to
the court in 1981, and has three more years in his term and would
then have to seek legislative retention to continue on the court.
   He has said he might consider retiring before his term is up, but
only if the age issue was settled.

   Thousands of high school students who
support a teachers' union that has been banned by the government
clashed with riot police in the southern city of Kwangju today, news
reports said.
   Police fired tear gas to break up the protests by 5,000 students
who tried to march from a university campus to nearby streets,
shouting slogans for a teachers' union, the Yonhap News Agency said.
   About 600 students were briefly detained by police, it said.
   Yonhap reported there were some injuries, but police had no
figures. The news agency said some students threw rocks at police.
``We love teachers! Don't punish them!'' students shouted, according
to Yonhap.
   Thousands of activist teachers are pushing to organize a labor
union in defiance of a government ban. The govenrment is threatening
to punish all teachers affiliated with the union.
   Union leaders claimed a membership of 30,000, but the Education
Ministry said only 5,000 of the nation's 300,000 middle and high
school teachers are affiliated with it.
   Also today, 2,000 street vendors, hurling rocks and wielding
sticks, fought police for several hours in Seoul, protesting a
government ban on their business in downtown areas.
   Seoul city authorities have recently removed all street vendors
as part of their effort to clean up the streets.
   Witnesses said several people were injured in the protests, which
lasted for several hours.

<TEXT>
   A former Exxon computer operator who
destroyed records on the Exxon Valdez oil spill has sued the
company, accusing it of wrongfully firing and slandering him.
   The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in state district court in
Houston on behalf of Kenneth A. Davis, his attorney David Berg said
in a telephone interview. The amount of damages sought by
Houston-based Exxon Co. USA was not specified.
   Berg said Davis will give Alaska officials a sworn statement
explaining how the computerized records were erased only if a judge
is present to protect his client from harassment by Exxon lawyers.
   Davis, 33, has acknowledged that on June 5-7, he and three other
employees recorded over computer files containing information on the
March 24 grounding of the Exxon Valdez.
   The lawsuit charges that Exxon fired Davis to make him a
scapegoat for the company's violation of court orders to perserve
documents on the tanker's spill of nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil.
   The lawsuit says the destroyed records were the only complete
file Exxon had on the spill, and that there is no way to verify
whether the oil company has other copies.
   Exxon attorneys, in a memorandum filed Wednesday in Anchorage
Superior Court, say the erased files were backup copies that it was
not required to preserve.
   Davis says in the lawsuit that he erased the first tapes April 24
on the orders of supervisor Randall Parrott, even after Davis
indicated to Parrott that the tapes contained records from the day
of the spill.
   Davis was fired June 9 for insubordination. He says in the
lawsuit that he had received dozens of memos praising his work.
   Exxon's memorandum describes Davis as a disgruntled worker who,
after his firing, took unfounded allegations to a reporter.
   Exxon attorney Douglas Serdahely in Anchorage said late Wednesday
that he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it.
   The crippled tanker has been moved to within seven to 10 miles of
San Clemente Island, about 60 miles southwest of San Diego, where it
is scheduled to undergo $25 million in repairs. Lawyers for Exxon
Shipping Co. and state agencies were negotiating over conditions for
allowing the leaky ship into California waters.

   Authorities today freed 24 men described
as Namibia's last political prisoners, and hundreds of cheering
supporters escorted them back to their hometown in this South
African-ruled territory.
   Their group, the South-West African People's Organization or
SWAPO, said it had unearthed 27 bodies in a mass grave. SWAPO fought
the South Africans in a 23-year bush war, and it is now favored in
elections expected in November.
   Territorial authorities acknowledged burying 11 guerrillas but
dismissed the report of 27 bodies.
   The released prisoners were placed in a bus that took them back
to the Katatura black township on the edge of Windhoek. The bus was
surrounded by a crowd of up to 300 cheering, jogging supporters as
it crawled the two miles from Windhoek Central Prison to the
township.
   Territorial administrator Louis Pienaar announced Wednesday he
would free the 24 men whom he called the last political prisoners in
Namibia, also known as South-West Africa. However, he said eight
others held in connection with political violence would remain in
prison.
   Pienaar previously linked the release of political prisoners to
freedom for people he say SWAPO holds in Angolan, Zambian and
Tanzanian camps. Pienaar said he changed his mind when U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar assured him the United
Nations would seek the return to Namibia of all SWAPO detainees.
   Perez de Cuellar is in the territory for talks on a
U.N.-monitored independence process that South Africa approved in
December. The transition began in April.
   SWAPO has said it released all of its 201 detainees. But
relatives and the freed detainees themselves said nearly 2,000 more
detainees are in SWAPO camps.
   When the 24 prisoners held by authorities returned home today,
SWAPO's information secretary, Hidipo Hamutenya, announced on a
loudspeaker that on Saturday the group had dug up 27 bodies from a
mass grave where they were dumped last week by territorial police in
Ovamboland in northern Namibia.
   Hamutenya said U.N. forces were present during the unearthing. He
gave no further details.
   Senior U.N. officials could not be reached because they flew to
the north early today with Perez de Cuellar to inspect security
there.
   Gerhard Roux, a spokesman for Pienaar, questioned whether U.N.
officials were present at such an unearthing. He said they did not
mention it when de Cuellar met with Pienaar on Wednesday.
   Inspector Kerrie du Rand of the South-West African Police said
police had buried in the bush 11 bodies of SWAPO guerrillas on
Friday. He said the guerrillas were killed during battles in April
that nearly derailed the independence process.
   Du Rand said the bodies had been kept in a refrigerator at the
Oshakati morgue but had been unclaimed. He called the figure of 27
bodies ``blatant propaganda.''

emergency landing in Fiji today, a newspaper said. No injuries were
reported.
   The Sydney Morning Herald, in its early Friday edition, did not
specify the engine problems, give the flight number of the plane, or
say how many passengers were aboard. The plane was scheduled to
arrive in Sydney at 5 a.m.
   The newspaper said the passengers were later flown to Sydney by

<HEAD>Exiles Report Arrest of Top Chinese Student Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese student Wang Dan, who headed a list of
dissidents wanted by Chinese authorities, has been arrested after
more than a month in hiding, prominent Chinese exiles said today.
   Wu'er Kaixi, who with Wang was among the best-known leaders of
the democracy movement suppressed last month, told a news conference
he had received confirmation of his colleague's arrest earlier in
the day.
   ``Wang Dan is one of the greatest fighters for freedom in China
today,'' Wang told a news conference, his voice cracking with
emotion.
   ``Recently the authorities have tried to dirty Wang Dan's image
by calling him a traitor. The contribution of Wang Dan, this
20-year-old student, will live on in the history of China.''
   In Beijing today, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua refused
to comment on persistent reports there that Wang is under arrest.
   Wu'er and four other Chinese dissidents issued an appeal to
governments, the United Nations, human rights groups and individuals
around the world to pressure the Chinese government ``to put an end
to secret arrests, to torture, to secret executions.''
   The five also proposed that a representative assembly be called
to create a Chinese Democratic Front to unite Chinese ``without
distinction of parties, tendencies, groups, beliefs, professions or
regions to unite under the banner of liberty, democracy, legalism
and human rights.''
   Wu'ur was joined by businessman Wan Runnan, political scientist
Yan Jiaqi, journalist Liu Binyan and economist Su Shaozhi, the
former director of the Institute for Marxist-Leninist studies in
Beijing.
   Liu said he does not believe the current government in China can
last more than two years.
   ``I'm not saying that what will follow Li Peng will be a
democratic government, but it will be replaced by a more moderate
faction,'' he said. ``We cannot predict when a Gorbachev might
emerge in China, but it's a possibility,'' he said, referring to
Soviet President Mikhai S. Gorbachev.
   Wu'er said there was no organization in place to help wanted
leaders get out of China.
   ``Before June 4, we never would have imagined that the government
would be so cruel and barbarous, so we never had such an
organization,'' he said.
   He said he and others who escaped ``have the responsibility to
continue the work of all those who have been arrested and executed
and lost their lives.''
   Since the June 3-4 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, at
least 12 people who participated in the protests have been executed.
   China's official Xinhua news agency has said nearly 100 soldiers
and police died and that thousands were injured, while about 100
civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured in the crackdown.
Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death
toll may have been as high as 3,000.

<HEAD>State Report Clears Utility in Rocket Fuel Plant Explosion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A natural gas line beneath a rocket fuel
plant destroyed in an explosion last year was under too much
pressure but didn't cause the blast, state regulators have concluded.
   The state Public Service Commission investigative report into the
Pacific Engineering and Production Co. explosion in May 1988 also
cited inadequate record-keeping and inspections by the gas supplier,
Southwest Gas Corp.
   But the three ``probable noncompliances identified during the
course of the investigation were not responsible for the Pepcon fire
and explosions,'' the commission's staff reported Wednesday.
   The explosion killed two people, injured 326 and caused $73
million in damage. Pepcon sued Southwest for $30 million, claiming
the utility's pipeline was primarily responsible, and has since
relocated its plant in Utah.
   The report's finding runs counter to theories that a huge gas
leak triggered the blast or that a small gas leak over a 2-week
period before the explosion had saturated the ground and caused a
fire that led to the explosion.
   A county fire department report has said the explosion was
touched off by a welder's torch that ignited large quantities of
ammonium perchlorate, a component used in solid rocket fuel.
   The state report, released on the condition that it not be used
for any litigation, said commission engineers determined that
Southwest was generally operating within federal pipeline safety
rules.
   However, at the time of the explosion Southwest's 16-inch gas
supply line buried beneath the Pepcon plant was under 308 to 310
pounds per square inch of pressure, slightly above the 300-pound
maximum, the report states.
   The report said the pressure ``was not considered by staff to be
detrimental to the serviceability of the pipeline.''
   The report also says Southwest was over the 15-month time limit
for a pipe station inspection, but there was no evidence of a leak
in the line.
   Southwest hadn't opposed release of the commission report, saying
it would vindicate the utility.

   Greek Cypriot women said today they will
end a demonstration that led to a clash with Turkish authorities
because they achieved their goal of protesting Turkish control of
northern Cyprus.
   The protest further inflamed sectarian passions between Moslems
Turks and Christian Greeks and threatened to wreck 11 months of
U.N.-sponsored talks on reuniting this Mediterranean island.
   ``We have achieved our purpose of emphasizing the Greek Cypriots'
right to return'' to their homes in the Turkish-held north, said
Athena Violari, one of the organizers. Organizers said their protest
would end later today.
   Many people now in the Greek-controlled sector fled the north
when Turkey invaded in 1974.
   Despite stifling summer heat, thousands of Greek Cypriot women
poured into narrow alleys of Nicosia's old quarter today, responding
to radio appeals to support about 1,000 woman protestors who clashed
with police Wednesday.
   Rauf Denktash, leader of the island's Turkish sector, threatened
to cut off talks on reunification because of the Greek Cyriot
protest. He was speaking to a rally while the 120,000 Turkish
Cypriots celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Turkish invasion
that led to their breakaway state.
   Akis Fantis, a spokesman for the Greek Cypriot government,
appealed for calm and warned of ``painful consequences'' if the
situation deteriorates.
   About 1,000 Greek Cypriot women and some male supporters pushed
across Nicosia's U.N.-policed buffer zone Wednesday night and
clashed at its edge with Turkish Cypriot forces.
   The women penetrated the boundary, called the Green Line, at dusk
after scuffling with the Canadian soldiers who patrol it and
knocking down barbed wire barricades at the Ayios Kassianos
neighborhood. They occupied a war-damaged elementary school and a
church.
   A few minutes later, Turkish riot police supported by dozens of
soldiers armed with rifles charged into the buffer zone.
   Four people were injured, Turkish authorities said.
   Organizers of the Greek Cypriot protest today demanded that
Turkish authorities free 100 women and 11 men, including Greek
Orthodox Bishop Chrysostomos of Kitium, who were arrested when
Turkish authorities moved in.
   Those arrested included Steve Weizman, a British reporter for
Reuters news agency; Katherine McElroy, another Reuters reporter who
holds dual Cypriot and American nationality; and Dutch radio
reporter Hetty Lubberding.
   Turkish Cypriot Radio Bayrak said the arrested protesters were
taken to courts in the Turkish sector of Nicosia today, but it gave
no other details.
   The thousands of women who joined the protest today, responding
to radio appeals for support, filled the narrow streets near the
buffer zone.
   Many of the women, some wearing factory workclothes, left their
jobs to join the protest. They were joined by scores of black-robed
Greek Orthodox priests singing Byzantine hymns.

<TEXT>
   Floodwaters washed at least 10 vehicles off
a bridge into a creek that rose about 13 feet in 30 minutes early
this morning, killing at least one person, authorities said.
   The high water hampered divers who were searching downstream this
morning for another car that may have contained as many as three
people, said Fauquier County Sheriff's Lt. David Flohr.
   ``It's the age-old story: people forget about the tremendous
force of running water,'' said Chuck Thompson, director of county
emergency services.
   Thompson said the cars were swept off the bridge on U.S. 17
between Delaplane and U.S. 50 in northern Virginia just after
midnight. The bridge, normally 10 feet above Goose Creek, was under
2 to 3 feet of water at the height of the flooding, officers said.
   Two motorists were rescued by boat off the tops of their cars
while others made their way to shore. After the water receded,
rescuers found the body of a woman whose car had not been seen
leaving the bridge, Thompson said. She was identified as Tammy Woolf
Conneway of Bloommerry, W.Va., said sheriff's Maj. Warren Jenkins.
   ``We had no warning whatsoever. There was nothing from the
National Weather Service. It caught everyone by surprise,'' Thompson
said.
   John Billet, a weather service forecaster in Washington, said the
thunderstorm was a local one ``that popped up in the front range of
the mountain.'' The heaviest rain reported was 2 inches at Front
Royal, about 15 miles away in the Blue Ridge mountains.

<HEAD>Scientists Brew Semiconductors From Yeast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have discovered that a simple kind of
yeast creates excellent specimens of a new kind of matter _
semiconducting crystals so small they behave somewhat like
individual atoms or molecules.
   The yeast organisms produce the tiny crystals when exposed to
cadmium, a highly toxic metal, in a process that apparently
detoxifies the metal.
   Semiconducting crystals are the basis of chips that are used for
all kinds of electronic devices. Studying the tiny yeast-generated
crystals should help researchers understand how small transistors
can be shrunk before they begin to take on the quantum properties of
atoms and molecules, losing their normal semiconducting properties.
   A paper on the findings was published in the April 13 issue of
the journal Nature by physicists at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Murray
Hill, N.J., and biochemists at the University of Utah Medical School
in Salt Lake City.
   It was not until the Utah researchers contacted the Bell Labs
scientists that the two groups realized the yeast had created the
first biological specimens of the kind of particles the physicists
were probing.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 11th graf, `The State,' to UPDATE with
comment from ethics committee chairman</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., faces a House ethics
committee investigation into allegations he sexually assaulted a
Peace Corps volunteer while on an official trip to Africa.
   ``Obviously we believe people should be innocent until proven
guilty,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., one of three
Democrats who formally requested an investigation by the House
ethics committee. The panel must inquire when such a request is made.
   But the ``behavior is fairly shocking if it proves to be true,''
Schroeder said. ``There's just no excuse ... We cannot let power go
to people's heads.''
   The Peace Corps worker claims Savage, while on an official trip,
fondled her for more than two hours in the back of a
chauffeur-driven embassy car in Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire, on
March 19, according to several government officials.
   Savage denied the charge.
   ``I did nothing, that's what I did,'' the black congressman told
television reporters outside the Capitol. ``This lie was leaked by
the State Department for political reasons.''
   ``They tried to destroy Dr. Martin Luther King with a lie ... I'm
in very good company,'' Savage said.
   In calling for an ethics investigation, Schroeder was joined by
Democratic Reps. Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Matthew McHugh of
New York.
   ``We write to ask the ethics committee to inquire into the
assertion that our colleague from Illinois, Mr. Savage, behaved
improperly towards a federal employee while on a congressional
tour,'' said the letter sent to ethics committee chairman Rep.
Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif.
   The letter noted that the lawmakers had no independent knowledge
of the incident, but added: ``We believe that the accusation is
sufficiently serious to justify your looking into it.''
   The State Department has sent a separate confidential letter to
the committee noting the allegations, said Jill Gross of the
agency's inspector general's office.
   Outside the committee room today, Dixon said the State Department
material was ``an assertion of what they believed to be the facts.''
   The committee met privately for 90 minutes today, and Dixon said
afterward he had no announcements to make on the Savage case or any
other issues facing the panel.
   The incident allegedly occurred while Savage was on a visit to
Zaire and had dinner one night at the residence of U.S. Ambassador
William Harrop.
   Those attending the dinner included the Peace Corps volunteer,
who was scheduled to brief the congressman a few days later on
agency activities there, said a Peace Corps official who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
   After dinner, Savage insisted the woman ride alone with him in an
embassy limousine while the congressman, members of his staff and
others visited area bars, the official said.
   ``He tried to force me to have sex with him ... He kept touching
me, after I told him to stop, many times, loudly,'' she was quoted
as saying in Wednesday's editions of the Washington Post.
   Savage offered reporters a different version.
   ``We were in a caravan of four or five cars,'' he said. ``We made
four or five brief stops and got out of the car and got back in. If
there were any kind of abuse, then why would she keep getting back
into the same car?''
   The woman left her post in Zaire for six weeks of counseling and
medical treatment at a Washington hospital and is awaiting another
Peace Corps assignment, the agency official said.
   But the 28-year-old worker, whose name has not been disclosed,
had declined to file a formal complaint against Savage, believing it
would hurt the Peace Corps, the official said.
   Savage, 63, has encountered criticism before for absenteeism in
Congress and globe-trotting appearances for questionable causes,
accused by government agencies of failing to disclose sources of
funds and investigated for personnel practices.
   But he remains popular in his Chicago district, winning
re-election last November with 83 percent of the vote.
   Savage was first elected to Congress in 1980, and the Chicago
Sun-Times said that during his first year he participated in only 51
percent of the recorded votes.
   The following January, Savage showed up at a demonstration in
Lisbon, Portugal, leading 50,000 demonstrators against American
policy who were described as mainly Communist trade unionists.

<HEAD>Court Official Played Dual Roles, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top immigration appeals official
took part three ago in a secret committee that shaped plans to
apprehend and deport alien terrorists, according to government
documents.
   It was ``a clear conflict of interest'' for David Milhollan to
serve on a policy-making panel while he supervised the immigration
courts, said Marc Van Der Hout, attorney for eight Los Angeles-area
immigrants fighting deportation.
   Van Der Hout said Milhollan's dual functions prejudiced a
government case against the immigrants _ seven Palestinians and a
Kenyan.
   In a legal brief, Justice Department lawyers argued that Van Der
Hout's allegations ``have no relevance'' to his clients' case
because the Immigration and Naturalization Service, not Milhollan,
filed the charges.
   Milhollan is director of the Executive Office for Immigration
Review in Falls Church, Va., which oversees the nation's two dozen
immigration courts and all immigration appeals.
   The Alien Border Control Committee on which Milhollan served
sought to ``expeditiously remove terrorist aliens found within the
United States'' and deport ``alien activists who are not in
conformity with their immigration status,'' according to the
documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information act.
   Also on the panel were the director of the Justice Department's
Office of Immigration Litigation, which is prosecuting Van Der
Horn's clients, and representatives of the FBI, the CIA and the
State Department.
   ``It's outrageous that a government official, supposed to be
sitting in a judicial capacity, would be meeting with the
prosecutorial arm of the agency whose cases he's reviewing,'' Van
Der Hout said.
   ``It's like a federal judge meeting with prosecutors in advance
of trying a case,'' he said.
   Van Der Hout and other lawyers for the immigrants have petitioned
U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson to summon Milhollan to testify
about his role.
   The eight immigrants were arrested in January 1987 and jailed for
almost two weeks on charges that they belonged to a Palestinian
group with a history of terrorism, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   In December, Wilson overturned several key provisions of the
McCarran-Walter Act, which authorized the deportation of aliens who
advocate communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the unlawful
destruction of property.
   The government has appealed that decision.

<HEAD>Iranian Daily Scorns U.S. Compensation Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. offer to pay $30 million to
families of those killed when an Iranian jetliner was shot down by
the USS Vincennes demonstrated Washington's low regard for Iranian
lives, a Tehran newspaper said Thursday.
   The Kayhan International newspaper said the U.S. compensation
offer was ``an attempt to counter an Iranian lawsuit against
Washington at the World Court.''
   The State Department said Monday it would pay up to $250,000 for
each full-time wage earner and up to $100,000 for others killed when
the Iran Air jetliner was shot down July 3 last year.
   The U.S. offer followed the filing of claims in a Washington
court on behalf of more than 200 heirs seeking a total of $145.5
million in compensation for their dead relatives.
   Kayhan said that the U.S. offer of $100,000 for non-wage earners
was not ``even a respectable illegal kickback in Washington these
days.''
   ``Each life at $100,000 equals the price tag for four Oliver
North speeches, three speeches by Nancy Reagan, and two by Ronald
Reagan. That is cheap,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
newspaper as saying.
   There were 250 Iranians and 40 citizens of other countries aboard
the Iran Air jet when it was shot down by the Vincennes. All 290
were killed.
   A U.S. military inquiry determined that radar operators aboard
the Vincennes, which had earlier clashed with Iranian gunboats, had
mistaken the jetliner for an F-14 fighter on an attack course.
   Kayhan said Washington's compensation offer was far lower than
what American families were paid by Iraq for 37 crewmen killed in an
Iraqi air attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in May 1987. Iraq said
the pilot mistook the Stark for an Iranian warship.
   Iraq paid about $740,000 to each of the slain men's families.
   The Stark settlement totaled about $27 million for 37 crewmen
killed in the attack, while the U.S. offer amounted to $30 million
for 290 lives, IRNA quoted Kayhan as saying.

   Tons of dead fish choked the Evros
River on Thursday, and government officials blamed a battery factory
in Bulgaria.
   The river emanates from Bulgaria and serves as a frontier for
Greece and Turkey.
   An official of the Greek Fisheries Department in Evros province
accused the Bulgarian battery factory of dumping chemical waste into
the river, killing the fish.
   The factory lies near the Greek-Bulgarian border and was the
focus of attention last summer, when the same problem occured.
   Tons of rotting fish on the river banks are creating a health
hazard and farmers have stopped drawing water for irrigation.
   Environmentalists fear the polluted waters could create problems
in the Evros River delta, a breeding ground for tens of thousands of
migratory birds.

   A 2-pound baby was hospitalized in
critical condition one day after a doctor declared her dead, a
spokeswoman said Thursday.
   The girl began to cry moments before an undertaker arrived to
pickup her body Wednesday.
   ``The hair just stood up on the back of my neck. By the time the
funeral home got there, we had her in the nursery and stabilized and
on a respirator,'' said Dr. Lynn Brouillette, who had pronounced the
infant dead.
   The baby was rushed to Schumpert Medical Center's neonatal
intensive care unit in Shreveport.
   Katina Payton, 17, gave birth to the unnamed child around 5 a.m.
Wednesday in Natchitoches Parish Hospital. The baby was three months
premature, Miss Payton said.
   But the baby had trouble breathing, Brouillette said. Doctors
spent 20 minutes trying to resuscitate her.
   ``She had no noticeable heartbeat,'' Brouillette said. ``We put a
tube in her trachea and breathed for her with a bag, but she just
didn't respond.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet TV viewers finally got a chance Thursday to
see what the rest of the world saw 20 years ago: the first steps by
a man on the moon.
   State-run TV featured a lengthy documentary on the Apollo 11
lunar landing by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin,
including interviews with U.S. scientists.
   On July 20, 1969, Soviet television ignored the historic landing
that millions around the world witnessed live, and instead broadcast
a musical variety show.
   Thursday's 20th anniversary documentary showed footage from the
moonwalk by Armstrong and Aldrin, with the astronauts gathering
samples of moon rocks. The American flag was clearly visible.
   The narrator of the documentary, former Soviet cosmonaut Vitaly
Sevastyanov, translated Armstrong's famous first words on the moon
into Russian: ``Eto malyenky shag cheloveka, i bolshoi skochok
vsyevo chelovechestva'' _ ``That's one small step for a man, one
giant leap for mankind.''
   Thursday's broadcast _ shown on a weekday morning that hardly
guaranteed a wide audience _ followed a July 10 article in Ogonyok
magazine that said it was wrong to hide the moon landing from the
Soviet people. The article also gave a detailed description of the
lunar landing.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
greater openness, Soviet media have reported on many topics they
once did not cover.
   Soviet TV carried extensive coverage of the linkup of the U.S.
Apollo and Soviet Soyez capsules in 1975, but largely ignored the
American program to land a man on the moon.

<TEXT>
   Railroad repairmen returned to work
Thursday, ending an eight day strike that crippled transport
service, officials said.
   About 2,000 repairmen reported for work and most others were
expected to resume normal working schedules by late Thursday, a
state railroad spokesman said.
   More than 200 train drivers, brakemen, conductors and station
staff who stopped work in sympathy with the repairmen also returned
to their posts, the spokesman said.
   The striking repairmen demanded a 20 percent wage increase
retroactive to July 1987 after rejecting a 10.7 percent pay increase
from the government.
   On Wednesday, transport minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi met with
strikers at the biggest National Railways workshops in the western
city of Bulawayo, and he said the government was working out a new
offer. He declined to elaborate.
   Junior repairmen earn about $250 a month, rising to $700 in
higher grades.
   Strikers said their action halted three-fourths of Zimbabwe's
rail traffic, including freight services to the Indian Ocean ports
of neighboring Mozambique and South Africa.

   A former aide to PTL founder Jim Bakker
testified in court today that the evangelist gave him the authority
to take large cash advances and use ministry credit cards.
   David Taggart and his brother, James, are charged with evading
$525,000 in federal income taxes while associated with PTL.
   Under questioning by defense lawyer Ben Cotten, David Taggart
said that as a vice president of the ministry, he had direct
authority from Bakker to take large cash advances, sign PTL checks,
use PTL credit cards and authorize bonuses for PTL employees.
   Taggart said he gained the authority when Bakker and his wife,
Tammy, lured him back to the ministry after a brief absence he
attributed to exhaustion.
   The cash advances, Taggart said, were used primarily for trips by
the Bakkers on ministry business. He claimed that money used for
personal expenses was reimbursed, but said, ``I always have been lax
about documentation. It's never been a priority.''
   Taggart's testimony came a day after Bakker invoked his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to answer
questions by defense and prosecuting attorneys. Bakker's 10-minute
appearance in the federal courtroom was without the presence of the
jury.
   ``When his trial comes about, there will be no taking of the
Fifth Amendment and no refusal to answer any questions that the
government cares to ask and to go into the entire matter in depth,''
said Bakker attorney George T. Davis.
   Bakker and former top PTL aide Richard Dortch are scheduled to go
on trial for conspiracy and wire and mail fraud on Aug. 28.
   After Bakker refused to answer questions, Judge Robert Potter
released the witness, saying, ``This court will not force him to
testify.''
   Cotten said he is barred from mentioning to the jury that Bakker
ever appeared in court.
   James Taggart took the stand Wednesday and described his
association with Bakker.
   Both Taggarts were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at the
television ministry following Bakker's resignation in March 1987
following revelations of the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.

<HEAD>Bill to Restructure Federal Uranium Operations Wins Senate Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over objections by consumer and environmental
groups, the Senate on Thursday approved legislation designed to
revitalize the government's money-losing uranium enrichment
operations, which make fuel used in nuclear reactors.
   The vote was 73-26. A similar bill in the House has not been
voted out of committee.
   The Senate measure would convert the Energy Department's uranium
enrichment operations to a government corporation, a move that some
consumer and environmental groups claim would amount to a $9 billion
bailout of the nuclear industry.
   ``This is just another attempt by the nuclear industry to raid
the Treasury,'' said Daniel Borson, an nuclear specialist for the
environmental group Public Citizen. His group had lobbied Senate
members to defeat the measure.
   ``The bill would do nothing to prevent the uranium enrichment
program from incurring more debt and eating up more taxpayer money
in the future,'' Borson added.
   The legislation is sponsored by Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., whose
state is host to one of the two Energy Department enrichment
facilities. The other is in Ohio.
   The proposal has strong backing by the Bush administration and
the nuclear industry.
   The American Nuclear Energy Council, representing utilities and
others in the nuclear business, called the Senate vote ``a major
step toward increasing the competitiveness'' of the enrichment
enterprise that nuclear utilities are dependent upon.
   The government is the only domestic supplier of enriched uranium,
which is the fuel used in nuclear reactors. The department's plants
increase, or ``enrich,'' uranium-235 atoms beyond their natural
concentration.
   ``Electricity consumers will benefit because competitively priced
enrichment services will keep nuclear fuel costs low,'' said Edward
M. Davis, president of the nuclear council.
   The proposed new corporation would be independent of the federal
bureaucracy and could make financing and operating decisions without
prior approval from Congress.
   The administration says this conversion would make the enrichment
operation more sound and capable of competing against foreign
suppliers of enrichment services _ including the Soviet Union, which
now supplies some U.S. nuclear utilities.
   The plants also enrich uranium for use in government reactors
that make materials for nuclear warheads.
   Environmentalists and some other citizen groups contend that
since the utilities benefit from operation of plants built decades
ago with taxpayers' money, the industry should be held responsible
for the debt incurred by the plants.
   The Energy Department says the industry should not be held
accountable because the plants' operation benefit the whole country.
It also says there is $3 billion in outstanding debt, not the $9
billion claimed by Public Citizen.

<TEXT>
   A United Airlines DC-10 made an unscheduled
landing today at O'Hare International Airport after a bird was
sucked into an engine and the pilot shut it down, said the FAA and
the airline.
   United Flight 23 from New York's JFK Airport to San Francisco set
down without incident at 9:58 a.m., said Mort Edelstein, a spokesman
for the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``Passengers left the airplane normally on the jet bridge
(walkway) and are being re-accommodated on another airplane,'' said
United spokesman Russell Mack, adding that none of the 265
passengers or 10 crew members was injured.
   The unscheduled landing came a day after United Flight 232, a
DC-10 en route from Denver to Chicago, crashed at Sioux City, Iowa.
The plane was carrying 293 people. At least 74 people were killed;
at least 176 people survived.
   In today's incident, a bird was sucked into the No. 1 engine,
which is on a wing, shortly after takeoff at 8:30 a.m. EDT, Mack
said. He said he didn't know why the pilot flew to O'Hare before
landing.
   Emergency crews waited on the runway until the landing was
complete, said Chicago Fire Department spokesman Tom Sheppard.
   The plane had been scheduled to fly non-stop and to land at 11:33
a.m. PDT in San Francisco, Mack said.
   In a third incident this week, a United Boeing 747 flying from
Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, made an emergency landing in Fiji,
according to the Sydney Morning Herald. There were no injuries.
   The report quoted an unidentified United spokeswoman in Sydney as
saying the Boeing 747 later flew back to the United States after the
crew rested.
   Mack said the Fiji landing occurred two days ago.

Hungary's news agency reported.
   The Romanians were on the morning train from Budapest to Vienna,
the MTI news agency said. Austrian authorities have in the past
refused to permit Romanian refugees from Hungary to enter the
country without valid travel documents and visas.
   When the group of Romanians refused to leave, the border

<TEXT>
   The U.S. attorney in Miami has received
FBI files on lawyer-pilot Thomas Root and is looking into
contradictions in his account of his 800-mile autopilot flight, a
spokeswoman confirmed today.
   A source close to the investigation told The Associated Press
that it would probably examine filing of false information about a
flight and liability for expenses of search and rescue after Root
ditched in Bahamian waters.
   Diane Cossins, executive assistant to U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen, confirmed that the office is looking into the case, adding
``we will not discuss any matters concerning an ongoing
investigation.''
   She said, however, that the FBI had turned over material at
Lehtinen's request, including details of interrogation of Root by
FBI agents at the hospital.
   Todd Root said today that his brother has no explanation for
reports by pilots who intercepted the flight a week ago that they
saw Root's head move when he said he was flying unconscious. He said
Thomas Root would stay in the hospital for another week for testing.
   ``We hope the medical tests will finally end this mystery and put
this all to rest,'' he said, noting that the battery of tests might
include psychological testing.
   ``Various pilots reported that as he was intercepted from the
right his head would turn to the right and as he was intercepted
from the left, his head would move to the left,'' Andrew Alston, a
National Transportation Safety Board investigator, said Wednesday.
   He said the plane's sun visor was moved at least three times
during the flight, too.
   Still, Alston, who interviewed the 36-year-old Washington
communications attorney again Wednesday at Hollywood's Memorial
Hospital, refused to second-guess the pilot.
   ``He was there. You weren't. I wasn't,'' Alston said.
   Alston wouldn't say whether Root could face charges for
misleading NTSB investigators.
   FBI spokesman Paul Miller said his agency also is continuing to
investigate the case, adding:
   ``We anticipate that once all our facts are developed, we will
again discuss the matter with the U.S. attorney's office in Miami.''
   Results of Root's blood test for carbon monoxide were negative,
ruling out that explanation for his claimed loss of consciousness,
authorities said Wednesday. Results of drug and alcohol tests are
expected later this week.
   The pilot says he was on a routine business flight, passed out,
and must have been shot when his handgun accidentally went off
before he regained consciousness in Bahamian waters.
   Root, who remained in stable condition with a gunshot wound in
his stomach, maintains the .32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver he
kept in the plane's glove compartment must have discharged during
the crash.
   But Smith &amp; Wesson officials said the gun's safety features make
such accidental misfirings impossible. And police and doctors said
medical evidence indicates Root must have been shot several hours
before his small plane went down.
   Root's plane lies beneath several thousand feet of water off the
Bahamian island of Eleuthera. Miller said a decision on whether the
plane should be raised for evidence would probably be made in
Washington.
   Also Wednesday, Root was sued in federal court in Washington by a
Georgia company that accused him of breach of contract and
unlawfully converting money to his own use.
   Root is accused by Sonrise Management Services Inc. of Columbus,
Ga., of failing to perform work he had agreed to do in representing
investors before the Federal Communications Commission. It also
accused him of double billing Sonrise, resulting in overpayments of
nearly $100,000.
   Since March 1986, Sonrise has paid Root $1.9 million as an
advance against legal fees and expenses and to reimburse him for FCC
filing and hearing fees, the suit said.
   On July 3, a separate suit in federal court in Macon, Ga.,
accused Root of legal malpractice, breach of contract and fraud in
handling a $75,000 transaction for Dr. Kenneth Bazemore of Byron, Ga.
   Bazemore's suit contends Root sent the money _ meant as an
initial payment for two broadcast companies _ to Ralph Savage,
chairman of Sonrise, without permission.

<HEAD>Computer Network Still Vulnerable to `Viruses,' Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A massive electronic network linking more than
60,000 computers remains vulnerable to potentially crippling attack
by computer ``viruses,'' the General Accounting Office said Thursday.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the White House
science adviser should oversee efforts to help protect the network,
Internet, from sabotage.
   In a report, the agency said lax security procedures on Internet
contributed to the severity of problems that resulted when a
software virus ``infected'' the system last November, crippling
thousands of computers.
   Internet, the main computer network used by the U.S. research
community, comprises more than 500 national, regional and local
networks nationwide and overseas handling unclassified information.
Two of the largest component networks are sponsored by the
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the
National Science Foundation.
   The GAO report was released at a hearing of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.
   Jack L. Brock Jr., director of the GAO's government information
and financial management division, told the panel that since the
virus attack last fall, security has been strengthened on many
computers connected to Internet.
   However, ``we still feel that the lack of central control (over
security) ... remains a problem,'' he testified.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey J. Markey, D-Mass, chairman of the
subcommittee, asked Brock whether Internet was still vulnerable to
computer viruses and other types of software sabotage.
   The GAO official responded: ``Sure ... No open system can ever be
completely secure.''
   Computer viruses are generally small strings of computer codes
that can infiltrate software programs and replicate themselves
thousands of times, causing computer systems to ``crash.'' In some
cases, they can surreptitiously alter or destroy computer data.
   Also testifying at the hearing was John Landry, appearing on
behalf of ADAPSO, the Computer Software and Services Industry
Association.
   He noted that ``virus attacks can be life-threatening. Recently a
computer used in real-time control of a medical experiment was
attacked. If the attack had not been detected, a patient might have
been injured or worse.''
   ``The risk of loss of life resulting from infections of airline
traffic control or nuclear plant monitoring systems is easily
imaginable,'' said Landry, executive vice president of Cullinet
Software Inc., Westwood, Mass.
   The GAO report noted that currently, ``there is no lead agency or
organization responsible for Internet-wide management.
Responsiblility for computer security rests largely with the host
sites that own and operate the computers.''
   To help ensure needed security improvements, the GAO recommended
that the president's science adviser, through the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy, ``coordinate the establishment of
an interagency group ... to serve as the Internet security focal
point.''
   It said this group should:
   _Provide Internet-wide security policy, direction and
coordination.
   _Support continuing efforts to enhance Internet security.
   _Obtain the involvement of Internet users, software vendors,
technical advisory groups, and federal agencies regarding security
issues.
   _Become an integral part of the structure that emerges to manage
a high-speed National Research Network planned for the 1990s.

   President Bush today named a housewife with
AIDS and a medical professor as his selections for the National
Commission on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
   Three Cabinet officers also will serve on the 15-member panel
created by law last November to advise the president and Congress on
AIDS policy for the next two years.
   Bush's choices are:
   _Belinda Ann Mason, president of the National Association of
People with AIDS.
   _Dr. David E. Rogers, a professor of medicine at Cornell
University Medical College and former president of the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation in Princeton, N.J.
   Ms. Mason, 30, contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion she
received while experiencing difficulties in the birth of her second
child in 1987, according to Mike Merdian, executive director of the
National Association of People with AIDS.
   She was then living in rural Hartford, Ky., and experienced
difficulties getting adequate medical treatment, Merdian said.
Neighbors' fears also prompted her family to move, and she has been
living most recently in Owensboro, Ky., he added. She was
vacationing in North Carolina.
   ``Mason will bring to the commission a much needed perspective on
the crisis, that of a person living with HIV disease. ... '' said
Merdian, who also has AIDS. ``People with HIV disease need to be
involved on every level of the decision making process.''
   Also serving ex officio on the commission will be Dr. Louis
Sullivan, the secretary of health and human services; Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney and Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward
Derwinski.
   House and Senate leaders previously have named five members each
to the commission.
   The Reagan adminsitration stirred controversy by naming several
prominent conservatives to an earlier AIDS advisory panel.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact
with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons.
   The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus,
now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, discovered in France
and the United States.
   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to
transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread
from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of May 31, AIDS had been diagnosed in 97,193 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 56,468, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   The House appointees to the commission were: Rep. Roy Rowland,
D-Ga., a physician who sponsored the legislation that created the
commission; Diane Ahrens, head of the Ramsey County, Minn., board of
commissioners who established an AIDS task force in St. Paul; Scott
Allen, a Baptist minister and coordinator of the AIDS Interfaith
Network in Dallas; Dr. Don C. Des Jarlais, coordinator of AIDS
research for the New York state division of substance abuse
services; and Donald S. Goldman, a Livingston, N.J., attorney who
has written and lectured on legal and ethical questions relating to
AIDS.
   Senate appointees were: Larry Kessler, founder of the Boston AIDS
Action Committee; Dr. June Osborn, dean of the school of public
health at the University of Michigan; Harry Dalton, a Yale
University law professor who is a recognized expert in AIDS legal
issues; Dr. Charles Konigsbert, director of the health division of
the Kansas Department of Health and Environment; and Eunice Diaz,
director of community affairs at White Memorial Medical Center in
Los Angeles.

   A weakening Tropical Storm Dalilia headed past
Hawaii, bringing heavy rain and high winds but no reports of major
damage.
   Hurricane Dalilia weakened to a tropical storm early Wednesday,
but the National Weather Service continued to warn people _
especially residents of the island of Hawaii _ to brace for heavy
rains and high winds.
   At 2 a.m. HST Thursday (8 a.m. EDT today), the storm was about
185 miles south of Honolulu, moving northwest at 13 mph and was
predicted to slowly weaken, according to the weather service.
   The weather service said that was likely the closest it would
come to the state. The storm was 210 miles south-southeast of Oahu,
the most populous island, and was expected to pass within 100 miles
of it today.
   Its maximum sustained wind speed was 63 mph; a storm is
classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted
to 80 mph.
   In Naalehu, the southernmost community in the United States,
residents braced for the worst, but were optimistic they would not
need the water, canned goods, batteries and candles they had hoarded.
   A tropical storm watch for Hawaii Island, the southernmost in the
chain, was upgraded Wednesday to a tropical storm warning, meaning
residents could expect winds up to 73 mph, heavy rains, flooding and
higher than normal surf. A flash flood warning also was in effect.
   A flash flood watch _ less urgent than a warning _ was issued
Wednesday night for Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Lanai as the
weather service reported heavy rain throughout the state.
   ``Because it seems to staying on a course that will bring it
parallel to the islands, we think the main problem might be from the
rain; hopefully the winds won't be too extreme, but we might get
some flooding'' said Hans Rosendal, a weather service forecaster.
   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed for the second day as surf
surged to more than 15 feet on the southeast coast.

   A mysterious disease is taking a heavy toll
on a herd of caribou calves that were to be let loose in the Maine
wilds.
   Twelve of 17 calves born this spring within a herd living in pens
at the University of Maine in Orono have died, seven from a
diarrhea-like illness biologists are not able to identify.
   Of the other five that died, one was stillborn and the others
fell victim to infection, low birth weight and other problems of
unknown origin.
   In addition, two adult caribou in the Orono pens died of
brainworm parasite. Maine Caribou Project leader Mark McCollough
said biologists are taking precautions to protect the rest of the
herd from the parasite, which is passed to susceptible animals
through infected snails and slugs. The parasite infests much of
Maine's deer herd.
   Of the 14 caribou already released in northern Maine's Baxter
state wilderness park this spring, nine remain alive. One died after
being attacked by a coyote, another died of the brainworm parasite,
and three others died of stress and reaction to a drug.
   One doe that was released roamed across the border to Canada.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NAACP called on civil rights leaders
Thursday to join a silent march to protest what they described as
``illogical, irrational and unexplainable'' Supreme Court decisions.
   ``We cannot stand by and let four men and one woman in black
robes halt our long-delayed march to freedom, any more than we
allowed people in white robes,'' to do so, said Benjamin L. Hooks,
executive director of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
   Hooks called on ``thought leaders'' of the minority community in
the United States to gather in Washington on Aug. 26 for a silent
march to protest the recent court decisions.
   ``It is illogical, irrational and unexplainable,'' he said.
   In particular, Hooks cited recent decisions overturning a
Richmond, Va., plan that set aside some city contracts for minority
businesses, permitting a reverse discrimination lawsuit by white
firefighters in Birmingham, Ala. and weakening protection for people
seeking to prove racial discrimination in jobs and contracts.
   ``This present Supreme Court is more dangerous to the legitimate
hopes and aspirations of black people in this nation than ... any
George Wallace proclaiming `segregation forever' or any Ross Barnett
standing in the schoolhouse door saying `they shall not pass,'''
Hooks told a news conference.
   Hooks, a former Memphis, Tenn., judge, said he still respects the
institution of the Supreme Court, but termed the recent rulings
``berserk'' and ``tragic.''
   Hooks explained that a decision to hold a silent march recalled
1917, when several thousand blacks marched silently in the streets
of New York to protect recent race riots in Waco, Memphis and St.
Louis. Participants in the upcoming march will be asked to dress the
same as they did then: men in black, women in white.
   The plan is not for a massive march and there is no desire to
disrupt city life on Aug. 26, said Hooks.
   ``We are not trying to mobilize large numbers, we are trying to
mobilize the leaders,'' said Hooks. ``Frankly, if we have 1,000 to
2,000 people I'll be happy, provided they represent the scope and
depth of the people.
   He said that organization of the effort is just beginning that
that while he is inviting ``all people of conscience'' to
participate, he has not yet contacted other groups about joining the
effort.
   Other organizations such as the Urban League, National Council of
Negro Women, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and League of
United Latin American Citizens had no immediate reaction to Hooks
plan.

<TEXT>
   An autistic teen-ager who clambered out the
top chair of a stationary Ferris wheel to retrieve his favorite
shoelace was rescued by a ride operator who gave the boy his own
shoelace, authorities said.
   A police officer and a carnival worker climbed 50 to 60 feet up
the ride and held on to Jamee Kleinman, 13, of North Syracuse for
about seven minutes Wednesday until the fire department rescued all
three with a ladder bucket, said police spokesman Rod Carr.
   Kleinman climbed over the safety bar to try to get off the ride
after dropping a special shoelace he always carries with him. A
teacher's aide who was escorting the boy grabbed him and held on
until the officer and carnival worker climbed up, said Carr.
   ``We were loading another set of people,'' said ride operator
Randy Gaddy. ``I looked up, and there was a kid hanging on the seat.
Naturally, I climbed up there as fast as I could.''
   While Gaddy climbed up one side, Officer Joseph P. Reilly climbed
up the other.
   Kleinman was struggling and screaming the whole time, said
Reilly. Autistic people have a disorder that makes them often
withdraw from external reality.
   ``It seemed like forever,'' said Reilly. ``I was just concerned
for Jamee's safety. I didn't want him to fall.''
   Once they were safely on the ground, Gaddy took a shoelace out of
his left sneaker and gave it to Kleinman, Reilly said.

<TEXT>
   About 55,000 Iranian drug addicts will be
prosecuted and sent to labor camps next week upon expiration of a
six-month grace period for them to kick their habit, it was reported
Thursday.
   The move was the second stage of an anti-narcotics crackdown
launched in December to stamp out rampant drug addiction.
   Law enforcement agencies will round up the addicts who have
failed to overcome their addiction to send them to the labor camps
to kick the habit, the Islamic Republic News Agency said in a report
monitored in Cyprus.
   More than 80 percent of the addicts in Iran have been identified,
according to an official of the Islamic Revolutionary Committees,
which have taken over from police.
   Guards will be stationed in most cities and along major highways
starting July 23 for a 10-day period to identify and arrest addicts,
he noted.
   The anti-narcotics campaign has concentrated so far on arresting
drug pushers and traffickers. Almost 800 alleged drug smugglers,
including men, women and a few non-Iranians, have been hanged since
December.

   An obsessed fan of actress Rebecca Schaeffer
wrote her a rambling love letter, kept videos of her TV show ``My
Sister Sam'' and stalked her before shooting her to death, police
alleged after arresting the man.
   Robert John Bardo, 19, was being held in Arizona today, while Los
Angeles authorities pursued extradition. Tucson police picked him up
Wednesday as he was dodging cars on a freeway there.
   Bardo appeared before a Tucson magistrate this morning via
closed-circuit television from the Pima County Jail. Magistrate
Clifford Hofmann entered a plea of innocent for Bardo on a
misdemeanor count of obstructing a street or highway.
   He remained in jail pending a court appearance later today in the
murder case.
   Los Angeles investigators flew to Tucson, where Bardo gave police
``statements related to the murder of Rebecca Schaeffer,'' Los
Angeles police Detective Dan Andrews said.
   ``I don't want to say he confessed, but he implicated himself,
for sure,'' the detective said.
   The unemployed fast-food worker from Tucson was an obsessive fan
of Miss Schaeffer, said Deputy District Attorney Robert E. Savitt,
who filed a complaint charging him with murder.
   The 21-year-old co-star of the old television sitcom ``My Sister
Sam'' and the current film ``Scenes From the Class Struggle in
Beverly Hills'' was shot once in the chest Tuesday morning at the
door of her apartment building.
   A female friend of Bardo's living in Tennessee called police
headquarters early Wednesday to tell police of his obsession,
Andrews said.
   ``He expressed a fixation with Miss Schaeffer. He appeared to be
very fond of her,'' Andrews said.
   According to the woman, Bardo said he had a video collection of
``My Sister Sam'' shows and an autographed publicity photo of Miss
Schaeffer, Andrews said. About a year ago, Bardo had sent a letter
to the actress, but there is no indication she had ever seen it,
Andrews said.
   ``I wouldn't call it a threatening letter. I would call it an
affectionate letter, but a bit rambling,'' Andrews said.
   ``He also expressed to his friend that he was going to harm Miss
Schaeffer,'' but it was unclear to investigators why he might want
to, Andrews said.
   ``The guy's real passive with everybody. He's being passive and
polite with everybody,'' Tucson police spokesman Sgt. Paul Hallums
said after the arrest.
   The gun in the killing apparently was discarded and has not been
found. Police believe Bardo returned to Tucson, where he lives with
his parents, late Tuesday aboard a Greyhound bus. Bardo apparently
had visited California several times during the past year, Andrews
said.
   ``There is an indication that there was an ongoing attempt to
contact her,'' Andrews said, adding that Bardo had called Miss
Schaeffer's agency several times.
   Apparently, Bardo called his friend in Tennessee shortly before
he arrived at Miss Schaeffer's home, telling her he was nearing her
residence.
   Witnesses identified Bardo from a photograph. Police allege that
the suspect loitered near Miss Schaeffer's apartment for about four
hours.
   Police found no indication that Miss Schaeffer was being harassed.
   ``She didn't have an enemy in the world,'' said her agent,
Jonathan Howard. ``She was a very successful young actress, on the
ascent, getting job after job. I can't believe this has happened.''
   Miss Schaeffer appeared on ``My Sister Sam'' on CBS with Pam
Dawber from 1986 to 1988, playing Patti Russell, the younger sister
of Miss Dawber's character, Sam.
   The killing was chillingly reminiscent of other attacks by fans
on celebrities, including the one suffered by ``Raging Bull''
actress Theresa Saldana in 1982 when a deluded fan stabbed her
repeatedly with a hunting knife outside her home.
   Miss Saldana survived the attack, for which a drifter received a
12-year prison sentence. A prison psychiatrist has said the man was
diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic.
   On Wednesday, Miss Saldana said: ``I feel overwhelming sadness
for Rebecca being a fellow actress and at this time for her family
who must be devastated.
   ``This is a very sad day for me and others in the business.''

   A woman accused of using arsenic to kill her
former husband and a boyfriend and trying to poison her current
husband is under investigation in other deaths, investigators said.
   Blanche Taylor Moore, 56, proclaimed her innocence through her
attorney Wednesday after making her first court appearance on the
charges.
   ``Mrs. Moore personally, while traumatized and upset over being
arrested and denied bond, is determined to rally and present her
side of all this,'' her attorney, Mitchell McEntire, said outside
court. ``She maintains her innocence.''
   Two sources close to the investigation, who asked that their
names not be used, told the Winston-Salem Journal that ``a good
friend'' of Mrs. Moore's _ a woman _ may have died of arsenic
poisoning.
   When asked about that information, Alamance County Sheriff
Richard L. Frye refused to confirm details of any cases, saying only
that investigators were being asked to review several deaths.
   ``People are calling us and giving us information,'' he said.
``The Burlington police have some (information) that they are
checking out. Anything that we come up with will be entirely up to
the chief medical examiner and the attorney as to where we go from
here.''
   One possible subject of the investigation is Mabel Parsons, a
grocery store co-worker of Mrs. Moore whose death was blamed on
cancer, WGHP-TV reported.
   A judge has ordered the exumation of the body of her father,
Parker D. Kiser Sr., to determine whether his 1966 death was caused
by arsenic poisoning.
   At the hearing Wednesday, Alamance County Superior Court Judge
Spencer Ennis scheduled a probable cause hearing for Aug. 1.
   Mrs. Moore is being held without bond on the murder charges.
   The charges:
   _First-degree murder in the 1973 death of her first husband,
James Taylor, filed by the Burlington Police Department.
   _First-degree murder in the 1986 death of Raymond Reid, a former
boyfriend, in a warrant issued by the Forsyth County Sheriff's
Department.
   _Assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill in the arsenic
poisoning of her current husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore, who is
being treated at North Carolina Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill,
filed by the Alamance County Sheriff's Department.
   Authorities from several jurisdictions who conducted a two-month
probe have refused to suggest a motive.

<HEAD>Judge Says Police Acted Above Authority in Seizing News Tape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court judge ruled
Thursday in favor of CBS News, saying police cannot confiscate news
footage merely on the suspicion it might contain evidence of a
violation of emergency regulations.
   Judge Jeff Levison order the Law and Order Ministry to pay court
costs and return the original news tape that had been seized Feb. 9
from a free-lance cameraman working for CBS.
   Police had allowed CBS to make a copy of the tape, showing a
lawyers' meeting in a church during the national hunger strike by
people detained without charge under the three-year national state
of emergency.
   Levison's ruling reviewed the statements made by police Capt.
G.L.S. van Huyssteen and former CBS producer Brenda Goldblatt
indicating the officer had given several reasons at different times
for confiscating the film.
   Van Huyssteen said he had noticed Azhar Cachalia, a prominent
anti-apartheid activist and attorney, talking to a journalist at the
lawyers' meeting and suspected he might have violated emergency
restrictions that prohibit him from addressing a public meeting or
giving news interviews.
   Levison said van Huyssteen ``realized that the tape could contain
proof of the breach of the conditions and resolved that it would be
necessary to have a video version of the proceedings in order to
have evidence of Cachalia's offense. He therefore instructed his
policemen to send for the police video team.
   ``Later there was doubt as to whether the police camera was
working properly so he resolved to seize the video film of one of
the journalists present,'' the judge said.
   The policeman didn't know what Cachalia was talking to the
journalist about and even if he had breached his restrictions, ``the
discussion ... could not possibly lead to a danger to the public
safety,'' Levison said.
   The emergency regulations require a policeman to form an opinion
that an action endangers the public safety before it can be stopped
or evidence seized, Levison said.
   ``All this decision really does is underline that, as wide as
police powers are in terms of emergency regulations, they still do
have to apply their minds and there are certain parameters,'' said
Lauren Jacobson, the attorney who filed the CBS suit. ``They can't
simply walk in and take a tape on the vague expectation that it
might contain something.''

<HEAD>Phoenix `Model City' For 1990 Census</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials already are making plans for the 1990
census, getting a six-month jump on most of the rest of the country,
because the U.S. Census Bureau chose it as the ``model city.''
   Phoenix will share the results of its extensive planning with
cities throughout the country, said Norris Nordvold, the city's
liaison with the Census Bureau.
   ``We have about 140 people serving on 11 subcommittees putting
together plans to make sure everyone is counted,'' Nordvold said.
That includes detailed plans to count homeless people.
   Although most cities won't start planning for the census until
about November, the Phoenix effort has been under way since March,
Nordvold said. He said a ``cookbook'' of recommendations will be
prepared to help other cities.
   The Census Bureau chose Phoenix ``because of Mayor Terry
Goddard's enthusiasm for the project, the city's mixture of
minorities and its growth rate over the last decade,'' according to
a newsletter published by the bureau's regional office in Lakewood,
Colo.
   An accurate count is important to local governments because state
and federal funds are distributed on the basis of population,
Nordvold said.
   ``That comes to about $175 per person in Phoenix,'' he said. ``If
you're not counted, we miss that much.''
   In addition, Nordvold said Arizona possibly could gain two
congressional seats ``if we do a good job and count everyone.''
   Ellen Dumm, spokeswoman for the Lakewood Census Bureau office,
said special efforts would be made to count minorities and the
homeless.
   Minorities were undercounted by an estimated 5 percent to 7
percent in 1980, but the 1987 Immigration Reform and Control Act,
which granted amnesty to many aliens who had been in the country
illegally, should make the count somewhat easier this time, Nordvold
said.
   ``We're getting a lot more cooperation from Hispanic groups
because there isn't the fear this year of someone wearing a badge
and coming around saying he's representing the federal government,''
he said.
   Ms. Dumm said census takers would spend the night of March 20

organized effort to count the homeless.
   From 6 p.m. to midnight, they will visit shelters, soup kitchens
and other places frequented by homeless people, she said. From
midnight to 4 a.m., they will count homeless people on the streets.
And from 4 a.m. to 6 a.m., they will count people leaving buildings

<HEAD>China Accuses U.S. Congress of Slander, Interference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China accused the U.S. Congress on Thursday of
slander and gross interference in the latest round of recriminations
prompted by Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy protests.
   In Paris, prominent Chinese exiles appealed for more pressure
from governments and individuals on China's leaders to halt secret
arrests and executions of dissidents.
   China's Foreign Ministry accused U.S. lawmakers of ``pursuing
power politics,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   ``The U.S. Congress has grossly interfered in China's internal
affairs time and again, seriously hurting the feelings of the
Chinese people,'' Xinhua quoted a ministry official as telling U.S.
Ambassador James Lilley.
   At issue were separate amendments approved by the Senate and
House of Representatives that provide sanctions against China.
President Bush already has halted military sales and high-level
contacts, but the amendments would also stop U.S. funds from
supporting trade with China and suspend satellite exports and
nuclear cooperation.
   The two houses have yet to reconcile the differences in their
bills.
   In a separate protest, a Chinese legislative committee said the
amendments ``willfully distorted the facts'' about the army's June
3-4 attack in Beijing on the student-led protesters for a freer
society.
   The Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress
accused U.S. legislators of having unspecified ``ulterior motives,''
and warned that efforts to pressure China, ``like lifting a rock
only to drop it on one's own feet ... will ultimately hurt the
interests of the United States itself.''
   China has strongly objected to all foreign criticism of the army
attack and subsequent arrests and executions. But the United States,
viewed by many of the protesters as a model of democracy, has been
most heavily attacked in a blitz of broadcast and newspaper
commentaries.
   China has protested the U.S. Embassy giving refuge to dissidents
Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, while the United States has
protested an attack by Chinese soldiers on foreign diplomats.
   U.S.-China relations have been strained before over trade, Taiwan
and China's policy in Tibet, but never since ties were restored in
1979 have emotions on both sides run so high.
   ``There are some people, a small group of people, who think the
United States is a bad influence and want to see (the influence)
limited,'' said a U.S. diplomat on condition of anonymity. But he
said he did not expect the quarrel to lead to a break in ties.
   Ms. Li, meanwhile, said Chinese soldiers were ``acting according
to their orders and ... Performing their normal tasks'' in searching
foreign diplomats' cars at checkpoints in Beijing and sometimes
sticking guns in their faces.
   Military checkpoints go up around Beijing after midnight, and
several diplomats have reported soldiers searched their cars in
apparent violation of diplomatic immunity.
   She also defended the government's seizure of foreign newspapers
and magazines at stores and hotels in Beijing last week.
   ``We do not refuse all foreign books and magazines and
newspapers,'' she said, although she could not name any not banned.
``But we do not allow those foreign magazines and newspapers whose
content interferes in China's internal affairs ... to spread
unchecked on Chinese soil. This is quite natural.''
   In Paris, student leader Wu'er Kaixi and four other men who have
fled China called on ``all people in the world blessed with a moral
conscience to come to our aid and help us put an end immediately to
these atrocious acts of repression.''
   They said a confidential report in China reported more than
120,000 arrests in the suppression of the democracy movement since
early June, and more than 100 secret executions in Beijing.
   Wu'er said they had received confirmation earlier in the day that
top student leader Wang Dan had been captured after more than a
month in hiding.

<TEXT>
   A Bush administration official suggested on
Thursday that former President Carter might go privately to observe
the election for an independent government in Namibia, in southwest
Africa.
   Herman J. Cohen, assistant secretary of State for Africa, noted
that Carter observed the recent election in Panama. The Namibian
election is due in November, the first after long domination of the
area by South Africa.
   Cohen testified to the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Africa. Later, he told reporters he that he had not asked Carter
about going.
   At the hearing, Cohen said there would be plenty of private
observers devoted to making sure that the election is fair, and that
he had confidence in them.
   ``In fact, it looks as if there's going to be about eight
observers for every voter,'' he joked.
   He said Carter could be one of them.

<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Agency for International
Development said Thursday it pledged $15 million to combat infant
mortality in Malawi, a southern African nation where child deaths
rank sixth-highest in the world.
   The grant will finance a program to upgrade rural health care,
immunization against childhood diseases, clean water facilities and
sanitation, said project officer Gary Newton.
   The program focuses also on research, training and health
education and comprises about 10 percent of total U.S. aid to this
mountainous, landlocked nation of 8 million people.
   More than one fourth of Malawians die before their fifth
birthday, a rate 20 times higher than in the United States.
   Only about 300 community health workers serve Malawi's 7 million
rural peasants.
   Another 550 workers will be trained under the program, a research
unit on infant disease and epidemics will be set up, and new water
systems will aim to provide 20 percent of the population with clean
water.
   Malawi is one of the world's poorest nations with an average per
capita income of $165 a year.

<DATELINE>NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Character actress Mary Treen, whose
credits over more than three decades included ``It's a Wonderful
Life,'' died Thursday. She was 82.
   Miss Treen died of cancer about 1 a.m. at the home she shared
with Marge Klein, 81, her vaudeville partner and lifelong friend,
said Suzanne Catlin, Ms. Klein's daughter.
   Miss Treen appeared in more than 40 films, including ``Babbitt''
in 1934, ``The Birds and the Bees'' in 1956 and ``Who's Minding the
Store?'' in 1963. In ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' the 1947 film
starring Jimmy Stewart that has become a Christmas film classic, she
played the cousin.
   Born in St. Louis in 1907, Miss Treen studied dancing and
appeared in stage musicals and vaudeville revues before starting her
film career. Ms. Catlin said her mother and Miss Treen used to have
a comedy, singing and dancing act.
   Miss Treen often worked in film comedies and was frequently cast
as a plain-looking working girl.
   She was bedridden for the last year and a half because of hip
replacement surgery and the fracture of her other hip, Ms. Catlin
said. A hospital visit for hip treatment about six weeks ago
revealed the cancer, first detected in her lungs, she said.
   Miss Treen had no children and is survived only by distant
cousins.

   Soul singer James Brown may have hurt his
chances for parole by having almost $40,600 in checks and cash in
his prison cell, a state spokesman said.
   Brown, 56, is serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault
and failing to stop for police. He was moved Wednesday from
minimum-security State Park Correctional Facility to Stevenson
Correctional Institution, a medium-security prison, for violating a
rule limiting prisoners to possessing $50.
   ``That could affect the length of time he'll serve on his
sentence,'' said South Carolina Corrections Department spokesman
Francis Archibald.
   The rule is intended to prevent inmates from bribing their way
out, or commissioning new crimes.
   ``Everyone knows the rules when they come in,'' Archibald said.

   A sidewalk preacher who doesn't like Rob Lowe
filming a movie at his apartment building should ``go to Carmel or
pull his window blinds,'' a judge said.
   Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin made the comment, which referred
to a quiet California resort town, on Wednesday when he rejected
John Medford's request for a restraining order against the filming
of ``Bad Influence.''
   Moviemaker Trans World Entertainment has a valid contract with
the building's board of governors for the filming, the judge ruled.
   Medford, a worship leader at a local Southern Baptist church who
preaches weekly on downtown sidewalks, objected because of an
Atlanta mother's accusation that Lowe persuaded her teen-age
daughter to have sex with a woman while he videotaped it.
   ``It's tacky, disgusting and wrong as can be,'' said Medford, 47.
But he went on to predict, ``God's will will be worked out.''

   A U.S. Consular officer said she was
denied access Thursday to a detained American photographer for the
fifth day since arriving in Kabul to oversee his release.
   The government announced July 1 it will free Tony O'Brien without
trial, but did not say when. O'Brien was arrested June 8 for being
in company of Moslem guerrillas.
   ``I do not know when they will let him out. There is no
indication,'' said Renny Smith, a consular officer from the U.S.
Embassy in New Delhi, India.
   The government Sunday demanded a formal letter from the U.S.
State Department, requesting O'Brien's release and authorizing Ms.
Smith to take him home. The letter arrived Wednesday, Ms. Smith said.
   ``I have been visiting various ministries and offices here since
I arrived on Sunday, but I do not have a clue to what is going on,''
she said.
   O'Brien, 43, of Santa Fe, N.M., entered the country without a
visa and was arrested by security forces at a guerrilla hideout in
Kabul. He has not been charged.
   He has been covering the war from the Pakistani frontier city of
Peshawar.
   O'Brien was on assignment for Time-Life Inc. when he crossed into
Afghanistan with the guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors.
   The guerrillas, backed by the United States and based in
neighboring Pakistan, have been fighting to overthrow the Marxist
government for 11 years.
   The United States and other Western nations closed their
embassies in Kabul shortly before Soviet troops withdrew from
Afghanistan in February.

   Officials closed an elementary school so
workers can excavate the playground, which on warm days oozes a
highly acidic black substance that contains chemicals that may cause
cancer.
   Park Avenue Elementary was built 21 years ago at the site of an
unauthorized landfill.
   Parents of its 1,100 students were informed by letters taken home
by their children Wednesday that the school will be closed next
week, said Los Angeles Unified School District spokeswomnes.
   Park Avenue is a year-round school. For now, children will use
two schools that are closed for the summer; another transfer may be

Munatoecessary in September, officials said.
   Superintendent Leonard Britton said the school will be shut while
workers excavate the playground to determine what is underneath.
Black ooze has seeped through the school's asphalt playground since
it opened, but the asphalt simply was repaved, according to former
students.
   A private study issued in December said some chemicals in the
substance were carcinogenic _ capable of causing cancer. The report,
by Thorne Environmental Inc. of Anaheim, said the substance would
present a danger only if it was eaten, rubbed on the body or set
afire and its vapors inhaled.
   Cudahy is about seven miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

<HEAD>United States Casts Doubt On Burma's Intention To Hold Free Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Thursday the arrests
of opposition activists in Burma ``cast serious doubts'' on the
government's stated intention to hold free elections next year.
   The State Department called on the Burmese authorities to release
all political prisoners and allow the opposition to campaign in
preparation for the balloting.
   It confirmed reports from Rangoon that authorities had placed
Burma's top opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest
and detained at least 42 protesters Wednesday. Troops prevented
access to the home of Ms. Suu Kyi of the National League for
Democracy, a vocal opponent of the government and the daughter of a
celebrated independence leader.
   Saw Maung pledged to hold general elections by early next year,
and Western diplomats in Rangoon say authorities have been
increasingly concerned by Ms. Suu Kyi's growing popularity.
   Relations between the United States and Burma have been strained
since army commander Saw Maung seized power in a coup in September
and killed hundreds of people to crush a nationwide campaign for
democracy.
   The United States responded by suspending some 12 million dollars
in aid, meant mostly for development projects and to help fight
narcotics growing and trafficking.
   ``The United States government is deeply disturbed by this series
of actions taken against Burma's largest political party, which cast
serious doubts on the Burmese government's repeated promises to hold
free and fair elections by may of 1990,'' the statement said.
   It urged authorities to allow ``freedom of movement and
expression and to release other political priosners. We also hope
the Burmese government will permit the political activity essential
for the holding of democratic elections.''

   Meeting deficit reduction targets in fiscal
1991 without a tax increase or a cutback in Social Security benefits
would require a 10 percent across-the-board cut in federal spending,
the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday.
   The $74 billion to $88 billion in spending cuts needed to meet
the fiscal 1991 defict tartget of $64 billion without raising taxes
would likely force the economy into a recession unless the Federal
Reserve Board further loosens its reins on inflation substantially,
the House Budget Committee was told.
   ``The central bank would have to permit faster money growth and a
substantial decline in interest rates to ... offset the direct
depressing effect of actions taken to reduce the deficit,'' CBO
Director Robert D. Reischauer told the panel.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told the House Banking Committee that
he is willing to push interest rates lower to avoid a recession, but
warned it is ``a difficult balancing act.''
   ``Some day, some event will end the extraordinary sting of
economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982,'' he said.
   Reischauer put the chances of the economy slipping into a
recession during the next nine months ``in the 15 percent to 40
percent range.''
   ``Retail sales have been disappointing in recent months ... (but)
the weakness is at least partly offset by continued growth in
personal income,'' he said. ``The stock market, which has always
fallen before in previous recessions, continues to rise. And the
recent decline in interest rates is likely eventually to help
housing and spending on durable goods.''
   But, like the Fed, the CBO is forecasting a more modest 2.4
percent rate of economic growth this year, slowing to 2 percent in
1990. The administration has predicted the economy will grow by 2.7
percent this year and 2.6 percent next after adjustments for
inflation.
   The congressional forecasters also think inflation, interest
rates and unemployment for all of this year and 1990 will higher
than what the administration has forecast, but only slightly.
   With the economy slowing, it also predicts that civilian
unemployment will rise from its current 5.3 percent to average 5.5
percent in 1990.
   The House committee's chairman, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said
the CBO's economic growth projections have consistently been less
optimistic ``and more accurate'' that those of the administration.
   ``Despite the soft landing projected by both CBO and the
administration,'' Panetta said, it will be impossible to meet
1991-93 deficit reductions targets of $64 billion, $28 billion and
zero without a tax increase or cuts in ``non-means-tested
entitlements'' such as Social Security.
   Reischauer said the CBO has reduced its estimate for the deficit
for the current fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30 from $159 billion
forecast last February to $150 billion.
   ``Although the 1989 deficit is almost certain to exceed the
Balanced Budget Act target of $136 billion, it may not exceed the
target by much more than $10 billion allowed in the law,'' he said.
   Although the congressional auditors have not yet incorporated
their economic projections into budget estimates, Reischauer said
the deficit outlook for 1990 is unlikely to change substantially
from CBO's forecast of $116.8 billion to $140.1 billion.
   The difference in those figues is whether Congress includes the
immediate $50 billion cost of the savings and loan bailout in the
deficit as Democrats want or finances it through 30-year private
bonds as advocated by President Bush.
   Bush's S&amp;L bailout plan would actually reduce the deficit by $3
billion next year because the money collected through the bonds
would count as revenues to the government.

<HEAD>Bush Says US Would Be Loser in Barring of Contacts with PLO</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Tops with 7 grafs on Bush letter, edits for transition.</HEAD>

   President Bush said today the United States and
Israel would be the big losers if the Senate seeks to bar U.S.
contacts with officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization
linked to terrorist attacks on Americans.
   In a letter to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
Bush said adoption of such a ban ``would interfere significantly
with, if not destroy'' U.S. ability to promote peace in the Middle
East.
   After six months of talks between U.S. Ambassador Robert
Pelletreau and PLO officials in Tunisia, the discussions are at a
``promising diplomatic juncture,'' Bush wrote. ``This is not the
time to take away from the executive a key tool of our diplomacy.''
   Pelletreau is the designated U.S. contact with the PLO in the
talks, designed to encourage eventual discussions between Israel and
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip.
   Mitchell signaled that he would seek to kill the move, pressed by
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and offer instead compromise language that
would give the administration greater flexibility to continue the
current talks.
   Helms insisted that Bush be required to certify that the United
States was not dealing with PLO officials who were in any way
connected with terrorist acts against Americans. The compromise,
expected to be voted on later in the day, would prohibit the
contacts only if the president knows and advises Congress that the
officials ``directly participated'' in terrorism.
   Bush said the Helms language would ``significantly and possibly
decisively'' undermine the Tunis talks and the peace process. ``The
big losers would be Israel and ourselves. I am sure that you and
your colleagues would not want to assume such a responsibility,'' he
said.
   But Helms and other senators held out for requiring the president
to make a certification to Congress, which the White House
considered an infringement on its authority.
   Bush and his two principal foreign policy advisers, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft, had worked throughout the day on Wednesday to kill the
amendment by Helms and Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., barring talks
with any PLO official ever linked to the death, injury or kidnapping
of Americans.
   Baker, appearing on the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, said the Helms
amendment would ``terminate the dialogue that's been established
between United States and the PLO.''
   ``We think it's important ... that we maintain this dialogue if
we're going to make progress toward peace in the Middle East,''
Baker added.
   Congressional sources said Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and
Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, also were among the holdouts.
   Bush, who invited Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress
to the White House on Wednesday for a report on his just-completed
trip to Europe, used the occasion to lobby against the amendment.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said Bush told the lawmakers that ``if
you pass this amendment and shut down any negotiations with anybody
that's ever even breathed on the PLO ... that's a step backward, not
a step forward.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush told the
lawmakers ``that at this point in the peace process, fragile as it
may be, that these kinds of limitations would not be helpful.''
   The United States opened talks with the PLO in December after
Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and accepted Israel's right to
exist. Pelletreau has met periodically with PLO officials without
evidence of headway toward settling the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   After it was disclosed he had held two unannounced meetings with
Saleh Khalaf, the security chief of the PLO and Arafat's principal
deputy, supporters of Israel led by Helms and Kerry developed their
legislation to limit the contacts.
   Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, was the founder and leader of
Black September, which carried out a massacre of Israeli athletes at
the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972. He was also a suspect in the
murder of Cleo A. Noel Jr., the U.S. ambassador to the Sudan in 1973.
   The proposed compromise has the effect of barring talks with
organizers, such as Khalaf, or the actual perpetrators of terrorism,
but not limiting talks with officials whose direct involvement was
not clear.
   The lawmakers voiced praise for Bush's performance on his 10-day,
four-nation trip to Europe, and gave an early signal of strong
support for his promise of $125 million to spur free enterprise in
Poland and Hungary.

   A bomb knocked a TV station off the air and
a guard was shot to death after the station ignored warnings not to
broadcast news about the anniversary of the Sandinista revolution in
Nicaragua, employees and police said Thursday.
   The attack on a tower of the privately owned Televisiete
Channel-7 occurred Wednesday night at Cerro Alux, on a mountain 16
miles outside the capital.
   A Televisiete official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
station employees had been threatened for several days and were
warned Wednesday not to broadcast news about the celebration of the
10th anniversary of the revolution that brought the leftist
Sandinistas to power in neighboring Nicaragua.
   The station covered the Sandinista ceremonies and broadcast an
interview with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega on Wednesday.
   A news release by the fire department described the damage to the
tower and adjacent broadcasting equipment as extensive. The
Televisiete official said Channel-7 may be off the air for as much
as a month.
   Police identified the dead guard as Roberto Perez Paniagua, 62,
and said he had worked as a night watchman for the station for 24
years.
   The National Police said explosives experts searched the Yurrita
Church in the southern part of the capital Wednesday night after the
parish priest received an anonymous call saying there was a bomb
inside. No bomb was found.
   Earlier Wednesday, the fire department said experts found and
deactivated a homemade bomb containing four sticks of dynamite at
the entrance of the Guatemalan Army Bank after evacuating 350 people
who worked in the building.
   Rightist terrorist groups have been active against leftist
guerrillas who have been fighting for power in Guatemala for more
than four decades.

<HEAD>Investigators Going `One Body at a Time' In Arsenic Poisoning Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Investigators are going ``one body at a
time'' as they review other deaths for possible ties to a woman
accused of fatally poisoning two men and making a third man ill, the
sheriff said Thursday.
   Blanche Taylor Moore, 56, was arrested Tuesday and charged with
assault in the poisoning of her current husband and with murder in
connection with the deaths of her first husband and a boyfriend.
Also this week, a judge gave permission for police to exhume the
body of Mrs. Moore's father, but no charges have been filed in that
case.
   Through her lawyer, she has denied all charges. She remains
jailed pending a bond hearing.
   ``We don't know where it's going to go to,'' said Alamance County
Sheriff Richard L. Frye. ``We can only take it one step at a time,
one body at a time. It's a long process to exhume anyone, so we can
only take so much at one time.''
   Meanwhile, the Winston-Salem Journal quoted unidentified sources
as saying that a good friend of Mrs. Moore's, a woman, may have died
of arsenic poisoning. Television station WGHP in High Point said one
death that may be investigated is that of a co-worker who was
believed to have died of cancer.
   But Frye declined to provide details of his investigation or what
deaths are being looked into.
   ``We confirmed we do have some names that we're checking into and
we will not release the names and we will not release whether it's
male or female,'' he said.
   ``People are calling us and giving us information,'' he said.
``The Burlington police have some (information) that they are
checking out. Anything that we come up with will be entirely up to
the chief medical examiner and the attorney as to where we go from
here.''
   Mrs. Moore was charged in Alamance County with assault with a
deadly weapon with intent to kill in the arsenic poisoning of her
husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore. He fell ill on their honeymoon this
spring and is still hospitalized.
   After doctors said Moore was suffering from arsenic poisoning,
authorities decided to exhume the bodies of Mrs. Moore's first
husband, James N. Taylor, who died in 1973, and a boyfriend, Raymond
Reid, who died in 1986. Tests on those bodied led to the murder
charges.
   Also this week, a judge ordered the exumation of the body of her
father, Parker D. Kiser Sr., to determine whether his 1966 death was
caused by arsenic poisoning. The body has not yet been exhumed.

   Investigators and rescue crews conducted
an ``inch-by-inch'' sweep today of the cornfield where a United
DC-10 crashed, cartwheeling in a ball of flame and splitting apart.
At least 74 people were killed.
   The airline said 186 of the 293 people aboard survived after the
plane, crippled by a loss of hydraulic power, crashed during an
emergency landing. Earlier, the number of survivors had been put at
176.
   ``We feel pretty confident about that number,'' Russell Mack, a
United spokesman, said at an afternoon briefing, but he added that
the airline had not quite completed a list of passengers.
   The plane hit the Sioux Gateway Airport runway Wednesday and
cartwheeled in a ball of fire into the field. But many survivors
walked away from the crash.
   Today, rescuers looked through the wreckage for victims. If there
were 74 dead and 186 survivors, that would leave 33 people
unaccounted-for.
   ``It's tragic what happened, but amazing and delightful that so
many survived,'' Rachel Halterman, National Transportation Safety
Board spokeswoman, said today from the agency's makeshift command
center in the Sioux City Convention Center.
   ``Even the investigators can't say why so many people survived,''
she added, ``and there hasn't been time for speculation.''
   ``The idea is to form teams and start pulling together the clues.
It will be an inch-by-inch thing,'' Ms. Halterman said. ``The flight
recorder will be going back to Washington sometime today and we'll
start interviewing the crew and the survivors, eyewitnesses and
everybody we can who has first-hand knowledge of the accident. We're
also collecting maintenance records on the plane.''
   National Guardsmen began working at daybreak, collecting pieces
of the wreckage which were strewn over an area the length of three
football fields. Ambulances and refrigerated trailers for the
storage of remains were parked along the runway where the plane hit
before skidding into a field.
   ``We swept the area four times last night for survivors. If they
were fatalities, they just covered them up and went on,'' said an
official of the Woodbury County Civil Defense and Disaster Agency
who asked not to be identified. ``Today, we've started removing
bodies ... and everything else.''
   A flight attendant who survived the crash by crawling out of an
opening in the burning wreckage was quoted by her parents as saying
``the Lord opened up that hole'' to allow her to escape.
   CNN reported that emergency officials believed most of the
missing were in the fuselage and were fairly confident that anyone
still in the wreckage was dead.
   The 15-year-old jumbo jet experienced ``complete hydraulic
failure'' before the crash, Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman Fred Farrar said. Parts of the plane were found 50 miles
away.
   Flight attendant Virginia Jane Murray, 35, phoned her parents in
Chester, S.C., to say she was all right.
   ``She said she was tumbling,'' said her father, Don Murray. ``The
walls were coming in. She said a hole opened up and the sunlight
came in and she climbed out the hole. She said she knew the Lord
opened up that hole.''
   Murray said he did not know the extent of his daughter's injuries
except that she was not burned.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' said 8-year-old Ben Radtke of
Prairie View, Ill., who was carried out of the fractured fuselage by
a passenger. The boy, shaking but unhurt, clutched a United Airlines
button and a pair of plastic pilot's wings as he spoke.
   Flight 232, from Denver to Philadelphia via Chicago, carried 11
crew members and 282 passengers, including three infants, said
United spokesman Lawrence Nagin. The plane has a capacity of 287
passengers.
   Most of the survivors were sitting in the middle of the plane, in
rows 9 to 19, said Dr. David Greco, director of the emergency
department and helicopter services for the Marian Health Center,
where many of the injured were taken.
   ``There was nothing left of the rear half of the aircraft. First
class was devastated,'' Greco said. Except for the midsection, ``the
rest of the aircraft was in tiny little debris.''
   The Seattle-based cockpit crew was being treated for injuries at
a hospital, Nagin said. He identified the crew as Capt. A.C. Haynes,
a 33-year United veteran; First Officer W.R. Records; and Second
Officer D.J. Dvorak.
   Hydraulic systems provide power steering that allows pilots to
manipulate the wing and tail controls of the jumbo jet. Without it,
aviation officials say the plane would be uncontrollable.
   The tail engine failed, and this may have caused a hydraulic
failure, said Bob Raynesford, another FAA spokesman. The plane's
three independent hydraulic systems are routed to the tail section.
   The crash left a swath of charred runway and strewed bits of
people's lives over the wide expanse: two sets of golf clubs, a
wallet photo of a brunette in her prom dress, a Reebok tennis shoe,
a purple hairdryer, one black high-heeled shoe and a collection of
Marilyn Monroe photographs.
   Four people near Alta, 55 miles east of Sioux City, discovered a
piece of the plane, 6 to 7 feet high and 6 feet long, in a corn
field.
   Four miles away, Allen and Phil Jahde found three pieces of the
plane scattered in their cornfield. Phil Jahde said one piece was a
6-foot-long metal band, engraved ENG 2.
   The plane may have experienced problems earlier Wednesday. Ruth
Dinsmore, of Mount Laurel, N.J., said she took the same DC-10 from
Philadelphia to Denver in the morning. The plane made the return
trip later.
   She said the plane began to leave the terminal at Philadelphia
International Airport shortly after 10 a.m., when ``everything sort
of shut off.'' The plane taxied back to the terminal, where it sat
about 15 minutes for repairs.
   However, Roland Herwig, a spokesman for the FAA center in
Oklahoma City, said it is ``complete hearsay at this point'' that
the plane had had problems earlier Wednesday.
   Herwig said nobody official has said there was a problem. ``We
don't even know if it was the same airplane,'' he said.
   United spokeswoman Kim Thomas in Chicago said she could not
confirm that the DC-10 had difficulty earlier in the day and read
this statement:
   ``I've been advised that maintenance records are what is called
`material,' which means they are part of the NTSB and FAA
investigations. Because of that, the information is not being
released.''
   The plane was flying southwest as it approached the airport, and
its wings rocked as it descended until the craft pitched violently
to its right, causing the right wing to hit the ground and sending
the plane into a cartwheel. The plane nose and fuselage ended upside
down.
   Survivor Mark Michaelson of Denver said during the last 30
minutes of the flight the attendants drilled the passengers on
emergency procedures and instructed them to put their heads between
their knees.
   After the crash, passenger Cliff Marshall of Columbus, Ohio, said
people were ``sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with
smoke.''
   ``Then God opened a hole in the basement and I pushed a little
girl out,'' he said. ``I grabbed another, kept pulling them out
until they didn't come no more.''
   Marshall said he thought he helped a half-dozen out. Then he ran.
   Several others walked away.

   Nearly half the American astronauts who flew in
space shared a day of memories Thursday with the president. It was
one small ceremony for man, recalling one giant leap for mankind.
   ``It's hard to believe that 20 years have passed,'' said
President Bush of man's first landing on the moon. ``Three days and
three nights they journeyed. It was a perilous, unprecedented,
breathtaking voyage. And each of us remember the night.''
   ``They'' were the men of Apollo 11, which set down on the Sea of
Tranquillity on July 20, 1969: Neil Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin
and Michael Collins.
   On that day, they were the only human beings away from their
world; on Thursday, they bathed in the glow of reminiscence outside
the National Air and Space Museum only a few feet from the command
module Columbia which carried them to the moon and into the history
books.
   Behind them at the ceremony were models of the 36-story rocket
that lifted them from Earth and the spindly legged lander that took
Armstrong and Aldrin to the airless moon.
   Eagle, the lander, still is on the moon, a souvenir of the brief
visit that will remain for all eternity, along with the American
flag they planted and the footprints they left.
   Armstrong, the first of 12 Americans who walked the moon, said
the space effort in the 1960s had ``a nobility of purpose ... not to
conquer enemies, but to conquer ignorance.''
   Buzz Aldrin, No. 2 on the moon and now a strong advocate of
proceeding onward to Mars said ``the time for seizing the initiative
in space is upon us.''
   And Michael Collins, who orbited overhead as a lonely lifeguard
while Armstrong and Aldrin pirouetted on the moon, said ``we have
rested on our Apollo laurels long enough; it's time to get moving
again.''
   The president had words for America:
   ``For those old enough to remember that historic night 20 years
ago, step outside tonight with your children or your grandchildren.
Lift your eyes skyward, and tell them of the flag _ the American
flag _ that still flies proudly in the ancient lunar soil ...
   ``Project Apollo. The first men on the moon. Some called it
quixotic, impossible _ had never been done. But America dreamed it.
And America did it.''
   Among the 700 guests at the ceremony were 66 of the 126 Americans
who have gone into space, including 21 of the 30 who flew on Apollo.
   They went for the most part unrecognized: Pete Conrad and Alan
Bean, second on the moon on Apollo 12; Jim Lovell and Fred Haise,
who were going there but didn't make it because of an explosion _
the third man on their Apollo 13 voyage, John Swigert has died.
   There were also Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, the last on
the moon _ more than 16 years ago.
   In the crowd was Thomas Paine, the NASA administrator then and
more recently the architect of the plans for America's future in
space that Bush enunciated Thursday.
   ``That was first rate,'' he said of the president's speech. ``A
good beginning.''
   John Young, who made two Apollo flights, called it a great speech
and said he wasn't disturbed that Bush was not specific about time
and costs for the program he envisioned. ``Nobody knows what it will
cost,'' said Young, who also has flown the space shuttle four times,
``if anybody tells you the cost today, don't believe it.''
   Rusty Schweickart, who was on Apollo 9 _ a moon flight rehearsal
_ said ``Part of the problem of Apollo was it had a single,
wonderful goal but nothing to sustain the momentum.''
   Richard Truly, twice a shuttle astronaut and now head of the
space agency, saw Bush's speech as ``dynamite ... a clear road map.''
   In his speech, Bush said he is asking ``my right hand man'', Vice
President Quayle _ chairman of the National Space Council _ to
develop realistic timetables and milestones for future exploration
and to report back.
   Quayle, who has been out making pro-space speeches, said that
``when Americans set their minds to acomplish something, we always
exceed our expectations.''
   He addressed the crowd as ``My fellow astronauts.''

   As President Bush announced U.S. plans Thursday for
a manned outpost on the moon and sending astronauts to Mars, the
Soviet Union is trying to come to grips with financial and political
problems in its space program.
   The Soviets, like the Americans, have considered a manned mission
to Mars and have laid the groundwork with long-duration space
station missions designed to test whether cosmonauts could withstand
a long journey to the planet.
   But as Bush marked the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing,
Moscow is trying to decide whether it can afford expensive missions
that once were routine. Those included the launches of the first
satellite, Sputnik in 1957, and the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin
in 1961.
   Once touted as proof of the superiority of socialism, a source of
national pride and a sacred cow, the Soviet space program has now
been criticized under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness.
   With chronic shortages of everything from toothpaste to housing,
Soviets are wondering whether the $2.38 billion spent on the manned
space program since 1986 is worthwhile.
   Already, Soviet legislators looking for ways to cut a $162
billion budget deficit have suggested slashing space spending.
   In part for economic reasons, the orbital platform Mir _ the
showcase of the Soviet space program designed as the first building
block of a permanently manned space station _ has been without a
crew since April. Cosmonauts are not scheduled to re-enter the
station until late August.
   Adding fuel to the controversy were the November launch of the
space shuttle Buran, whose development cost $10 billion; the loss in
September and March of two unmanned Mars probes, Phobos I and II, at
a cost of a half-billion dollars; and embarrassing delays caused by
technical problems and human error in the landings of two crews from
Mir last year.
   Opposition also grew when Soviet space officials hungry for
foreign currency chose a Japanese TV reporter, and not a Soviet who
could only pay rubles, for the first commercial trip to Mir.
   After 15 free flights with international crews, the Soviets are
starting to charge foreign crews that want to travel to Mir, at a
cost of $10 million to $12 million a shot.
   The Soviet space agency Glavkomos also is seeking foreign
customers for satellite launching and hopes to sell crystals grown
in Mir's zero-gravity for use in electronics. It also hopes to sell
medicines manufactured on the space station.
   The Japanese mission and a flight by an Austrian cosmonaut are
scheduled for 1990 or 1991. In an entirely privately financed trip,
the first Briton in space is to accompany two cosmonats to Mir in
1991.
   As for the Buran, officials have not announced when it will fly
again.
   State TV's nightly news program ``Vremya'' marked the Apollo 11
anniversary with a report repeating the traditional Soviet charge
that the United States is militarizing space.
   Correspondent Boris Kolyagin reported from Washington that the
United States had considered setting up a base on the moon before
but that ``gradually other space programs, plans for `Star Wars,'
pushed out the peaceful beginnings.''
   The report featured interviews with the three Apollo 11
astronauts but did not mention Bush's speech, which drew only a
brief mention by the Tass news agency.
   Earlier in the day, Soviet TV broadcast a lenghty documentary on
the Apollo 11 mission, showing its viewers for the first time some
of the footage from the historic July 20, 1969, moon landing.

<HEAD>Burma Puts Opposition Leader Under House Arrest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Burma's military government put the main
opposition leader under house arrest Thursday and soldiers sealed
off her home in a Rangoon suburb, according to diplomatic reports
from the Burmese capital.
   Hundreds of students had defied martial law with anti-government
protests Wednesday even though the opposition leader, Aung San Suu
Kyi, canceled a planned rally to avoid clashes with the large number
of soldiers in the streets. Burma's official radio reported 44
arrests.
   A source in Bangkok, citing a report from a Western embassy in
the Burmese capital, said Ms. Suu Kyi's ``compound was surrounded by
troops'' and ``she tried to surrender herself to the military, but
they refused and they forced her back inside.''
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a diplomat
and Tin Oo, co-leader of Ms. Suu Kyi's National League for
Democracy, were turned away when they tried to see her.
   No other details were available. Telephone and telex lines to
Rangoon from Bangkok and other Asian cities were out of order
Thursday.
   In Washington, the State Department confirmed Ms. Suu Kyi, 44,
was under house arrest and that soldiers were blocking access to her
home. It said the arrest of opposition activists ``cast serious
doubts'' on the government's stated intention of holding free
elections next year.
   Rangoon radio did not mention Ms. Suu Kyi on Thursday, but said
diplomats were being summoned to a meeting Friday with the
government's Information Committee.
   It announced an amnesty for people tried on or before Sept. 18,
1988. Gen. Saw Maung, the army commander, seized power on that day
and his soldiers killed hundreds of people demonstrating peacefully
for democracy.
   Saw Maung signed the amnesty order, which commutes death
sentences to life imprisonment, reduces life terms to 10 years and
cuts other sentences by one-third.
   Prisoners with two years or less to serve will be released and
criminal cases still being heard will be closed, with the exceptions
of those involving high treason or violation of martial law, the
order said.
   The Bangkok source said the reason for Ms. Suu Kyi's arrest was
not clear, but the government may have used violence during
Wednesday's Martyrs Day ceremonies as a pretext to move against her.
   He said her arrest also might be linked to those of three members
of her party accused of bombing a government oil refinery earlier
this month. Three people were killed.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, whose father was an independence leader, is the
military government's most vocal critic. Western diplomats say the
authorities have been concerned about the growing popularity that
attracts thousands of people to her rallies.
   ``Aung San Suu Kyi has been looking for a confrontation,'' the
source in Bangkok said. ``Now it's happened.''
   Ms. Suu Kyi had planned to lead thousands in a march Wednesday,
the anniversary of the day her father, Aung San, and other Burmese
independence leaders were assassinated in 1947. Burma became
independent of Britain in January 1948.
   On Wednesday, Ms. Suu Kyi said she canceled the march because
soldiers ``blocked off all the roads and prepared literally a
killing field for the people.''
   In a telephone interview from Rangoon, she also said soldiers had
beaten some of about 3,000 students in the capital's Swegondine
district.
   A Western diplomat, also reached by telephone, said he saw
soldiers pursue students down a side street, drag some out and hit
them with clubs, then put 15 or 20 into a truck.

   Republican congressman today sprayed with water
an effigy of a Texas flag-burner, and veterans groups urged
lawmakers to undo the Supreme Court ruling that allows flag burning.
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., led more than a dozen GOP House members,
armed with fire extinguishers and a bucket of water, to the steps of
the Supreme Court, where television cameras were gathered to record
a rumored flag-burning by Gregory Lee Johnson.
   ``You're not going to come to Capitol Hill and burn the United
States flag,'' warned Rep. Larkin Smith, R-Miss.
   The flag burning never occurred, so the lawmakers sprayed and
doused with water a stuffed dummy they called Johnson that was held
aloft by some anti-flag-burning protesters.
   Johnson, whose 1984 flag-burning conviction was thrown out by the
Supreme Court last month, held a news conference across the street
and said he never intended to burn a flag today.
   ``I'm not going to, like fall into this silly trap,'' he said.
   Earlier today, veterans groups testified in support of
congressional action to restore penalties for desecrating the flag.
Two of the groups said a constitutional amendment was the only
course of action, but one said it could also support regular
legislation if that would work.
   ``Choose whatever course of action is best for our nation and our
flag and you will have the support of the Disabled American
Veterans,'' said John Heilman, the DAV's national legislative
director.
   Heilman's openness to a regular statute to address the court
ruling was at odds with representatives of the American Legion and
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who told a House Judiciary
subcommittee that nothing less than amendment to the Constitution
would be satisfactory.
   ``We must rally round our flag and pursue a constitutional
amendment prohibiting the physical desecration of that flag,'' said
H.F. ``Sparky'' Gierke, the Legion's national commander. A poll
commissioned by the Legion found 75 percent of American believe such
an amendment would not impinge on their constitutional rights, he
said.
   ``Freedom of expression can and should co-exist with a sense of
reverence for the flag and all that it means to Americans,'' James
Magill, national legislative director of the VFW, told the civil and
constitutional rights subcommittee.
   After four days of hearings, including two days of testimony from
legal scholars, the House panel remained divided over how to
overcome a Supreme Court decision on flag burning.
   The liberal Democrats on the panel remain adamantly opposed to a
constitutional amendment and the Republicans vow to push it through.
   ``The idea of a constitutional amendment has been damaged
severely in these hearings so far,'' subcommittee chairman Don
Edwards, D-Calif., said Wednesday.
   He and other Democrats said they were convinced by the experts to
seek a regular statute over any amendment.
   But senior committee Republican Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin
said, ``How can we enact a statute to ban such flag burnings ...
which does not relate to the suppression of free expression? It's a
puzzle to me how you can get around that.''
   An unexpected argument against the political tide to reverse the
high court ruling came Wednesday from Harvard University law
professor Charles Fried, who as President Reagan's solicitor general
was the administration's chief advocate before the Supreme Court.
   When the Texas flag-burning case came up before the court, Fried
declined to advance an administration position _ a decision some say
may have made the difference in the court's 5-4 ruling.
   Fried had been expected to tell the subcommittee that he didn't
file then because he thought the Texas law and the federal code were
defective and could be fixed.
   But Fried agreed with other witnesses, including rejected Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork, that the arguments against a statute were
``devastating.'' At the same time, he called on Congress to do
nothing _ enact no statute, no constitutional amendment.
   ``Whatever the technicalities, the evident purpose of such a
statute would still be to punish acts of expression,'' he said.
   ``America, its traditions and values and its flag are important.
But foremost among those values is the principle that no one shall
be punished for his political expressions _ no matter how offensive
or bizarre,'' he said, recalling his own childhood flight from
oppression in Czechoslovakia.
   ``I hope and urge and pray that we will not act, that no statute
be passed and of course that the Constitution not be amended,'' he
said.
   Democrats told him that was no longer a viable political position
_ the choice was only between a statute and an amendment.
   But Fried told the lawmakers, ``There are times when you can earn
your rather inadequate salaries by just doing the right thing ...
It's called leadership.''
   Edwards told reporters he still planned to send to the full House
before the August recess a proposed statute, crafted based on the
expert testimony.
   Sensenbrenner urged Edwards to send both the statute and a
constitutional amendment to the floor _ an approach already adopted
by Senate leaders.
   ``It is the right thing to do,'' he said.

<HEAD>Platte, Klamath Top List Of Most Endangered Rivers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Platte River in Colorado and Nebraska and
the Klamath River in Oregon topped a list of the 10 most endangered
rivers released by a national conservation group Thursday.
   Other rivers included the American in California, the Penobscot
in Maine, the Payette in Idaho, the James River in Virginia, the
Little Bighorn in Wyoming, the Illinois Bayou in Arkansas, the New
River in North Carolina and the Animas in Colorado.
   ``These rivers are national treasures, because of their free
flowing nature, ecological qualities and recreational values,''
said W. Kent Olson, president of American Rivers. ``Yet, these
outstanding rivers _ and, often, their scenic landscapes _ face
imminent, major threats from uneeded dams, water projects or
adverse land development.''
   Olson said his group released its annual list to ``call
attention to the fact that they are in danger but are not dead,
yet.''
   The rivers were selected based on their national or regional
significance and the ``degree and imminence'' of the threats they
face.
   Olson said that six of the rivers on the list were threatened by
hydroelectric projects and the others threatened by flood control
and water supply projects and nearby land development.
   The group said the Platte faces two major problems, the Two
Forks water storage dam proposed on the South Platte near Denver
and the operation of upstream dams along a 200-mile stretch known
as ``Big Bend'' in Nebraska.
   The $500 million Salt Caves Dam project threatens a 19-mile
stretch of the upper Klamath in southern Oregon, the group said.
   Five of the rivers on the list, the Platte, Klamath, American,
Animas and Little Big Horn were holdovers from last year's list.
   While the Platte and the Klamath topped this year's list, the
other were not ranked in any particular order.
   Here is a rundown on each of the other rivers:
   _The American, threatened by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
proposal to build a ``dry'' dam at the Auburn Dam site for flood
control.
   _The Penobscot, threatened by a proposed hydrdoelectric known as
the Basin Mills Project. e Payette, threatened by proposed dams on
the North and South Forks near Boise.
   _The James, threatened by several hydroelectric projects.
   _The Little Bighorn, threatened by a large pumped-storage
hydroelectric generating plant and a water storage project.
   _The Illinois Bayou, threatened by a newly proposed dam near
Russelville.
   _The New, threatened by nearby land development.
   _The Animas, threatened by the Animas La Plata irrigation
project.
   Other rivers that didn't make the group's top 10 list but were
considered endangered included: the Greenbrier in West Virginia,
the Smith in California, the Yampa in Colorado, the Lower Kern in
California, the Oswegatchie in New York, the Allegheny in
Pennsylvania, the Niobrara in Nebraska, the North Fork of the
Mokelumne in California, the Clavey in California and the Big in
Rhode Island.

<HEAD>Bush Says U.S. Must Go Back to Moon, on to Mars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after man's first step on the
moon, President Bush said Thursday Americans must commit to the
permanent settlement of space, first returning to the moon and then
embarking on a ``journey into tomorrow,'' a manned mission to
distant Mars.
   The president offered no firm timetable or pricetag for a program
that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars but said it would be
worth the cost ``because it is humanity's destiny to strive, to
seek, to find. And because it is America's destiny to lead.''
   His proposal was made in a ceremony, on the steps of the National
Air and Space Museum, marking the historic moment July 20, 1969,
when American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped on
the moon's Sea of Tranquility to fulfill a pledge made eight years
earlier by President Kennedy.
   The two moonwalkers stood with Bush Friday, along with Mike
Collins, the third Apollo 11 crewman who said, ``We have rested on
our Apollo laurels long enough; it's time to get moving again.''
   Bush's proposal _ to establish a U.S. moon base early in the next
century and then mount a manned Mars mission _ likely will ignite a
long national debate both in a budget-minded Congress and among
those who believe federal dollars should not be spent on costly
space endeavors but on solving more earthly problems.
   At a time of huge budget deficits, Congress already is balking at
the start-up costs for NASA's $30 billion space station, which Bush
said was ``a first and necessary step for sustained manned
exploration.''
   Congress, he said, is ``where the future of the space station _
and our future as a space-faring nation _ will be decided.''
   Bush offered few details beyond his broad goals and said he was
leaving it to Vice President Dan Quayle, as head of the National
Space Council, and to NASA to come up with ``realistic timetables.''
Putting the space station in orbit has been scheduled for after 1995.
   The president chose to look beyond the budget debate over the
space station budget.
   ``We must commit ourselves anew to ... the permanent settlement
of space,'' he said. ``We must commit ourselves to a future where
Americans and citizens of all nations will live and work in space.''
   Richard Truly, the NASA administrator hailed Bush's initiative as
``dynamite'' and said that if the program is approved, NASA will be
ready to establish a moon base ``in the dawn of the new century.''
   Truly said cuts in the NASA budget in recent years have weakened
the agency so that in its present structure it could not carry out
such visionary plans.
   Truly said he had no estimate on how much Bush's program would
cost. But he noted that during the heyday of the Apollo program
NASA's funding represented more than 4 percent of the national
budget compared with about 1 percent now.
   He said the job could be done with less than 4 percent.
   Other observers have estimated that if Bush's proposal were
adopted, NASA's present budget request of $13.3 billion would have
to more than double within a few years and that the whole package
eventually could cost as much as $800 billion to $900 billion.
   Bush will need to forge an alliance with Democratic leaders to
win the funding for serious space exploration, and initial skeptical
reaction came from Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., the House majority
leader.
   ``The real test of presidential leadership is not whether he can
marshal the words but the resources to restore America's preeminence
in space,'' Gephardt said. ``In sum, Mr. President, there's no such
thing as a free launch.''
   The proposal also drew opposition from a key member of the house
committee that oversees NASA appropriations.
   ``Given the federal budget deficit and earthly demands, I don't
see how we can afford expensive manned programs in space in the near
future,'' said Rep. Bill Green of New York.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said Bush was ``calling for one great
leap for mankind'' but not even providing the money for ``one small
step,'' using a take-off of Armstrong's first words from the lunar
surface.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., a member of the Senate committee
charged with the space agency budget, said: ``By proposing a return
to the moon and a manned base on Mars, with no money, no timetable
and no plan, Bush offers the country not a challenge to inspire us,
but a daydream to briefly entertain us.''
   Meanwhile, the full House handily defeated an attempt by Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to transfer $714 million from the proposed
fiscal 1990 budget for the space station to programs for veterans'
medical care, pollution control and low-income and elderly housing.
   Bush's ceremony with the astronauts blended his glimpse into the
future with reminiscences of the Apollo program.
   He unveiled a new postage stamp commemorating the first moon
landing, then signed a proclamation marking Space Exploration Day.
He invited the astronauts and their families back to the White House
for a picnic lunch.
   Bush recalled the first moon landing two decades ago, saying,
``Some called it quixotic, impossible ... but America did it.'' Now,
he said, it is time for the nation to head ``back to the moon, back
to the future, and this time back to stay.''
   Under NASA scenarios outlined last year, a permanently manned
base on the front side of the moon would require astronaut crews to
construct an Antarctic-type facility, mixing mineral-rich lunar soil
with water to form a kind of cement.
   Oxygen extracted from moon rocks could be mixed with hydrogen
brought from Earth to fuel expeditions to Mars and elsewhere.
   To explore Mars, one NASA option would use humans, the other a
robot to move around the surface. A third would place men on the
Mars moon Phobos to guide the rover on Mars.

<HEAD>Indian Can't Bowl at Local Tournament Because of Long Hair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chippewa Indian and the city are
fighting a bowling organization which doesn't allow men to bowl in
tournaments if they wear their hair long _ but doesn't have such
rules for women.
   Joe Big Bear, who braids his 6-inch ponytail to complement his
ceremonial dance costumes, was banned from a November tourney
sponsored by the Amateur Bowlers Tour at St. Paul's Midway Pro Bowl.
   Big Bear and the St. Paul Human Rights Department contend the
rule discriminated against him on the basis of sex.
   A city attorney will urge that Big Bear be awarded $3,325 in
damages at a hearing scheduled for Monday.
   ``We are saying, `Why are they enforcing it only for male
members?''' said Dulce de Leon, supervisor of investigations for
the city's Human Rights Department. ``If it is for safety reasons,
it should be for both sexes.''
   Amateur Bowlers Tour has resisted efforts to settle the case,
prompting the city to set the hearing before a three-member panel
of its Human Rights Commission, De Leon said.
   Scott Miller, director of the Twin Cities division of the
Amateur Bowlers Tour, said the rule was established to provide a
professional appearance for participants, Miller said.
   The rule states: ``Hair must be trimmed and combed and will not
be permitted below the bottom of the normal collar for male
members. Braids and pony tails, hair curlers and head bands are not
permitted for male members.''
   Big Bear, 35, who grew up on the White Earth Indian Reservation
in northern Minnesota, is a program manager for Hennepin County's
chemical health division.
   Big Bear said he has competed in about 300 tournaments,
including an American Bowling Congress event in Reno, Nev., he said.
   Last fall and winter, Big Bear bowled in five leagues in St.
Paul and Minneapolis, posting a 178 average in one, and decided to
enter the Nov. 26-27 event sponsored by the Amateur Bowlers Tour.
The group started its Twin Cities division in September and
guarantees a top prize of $1,000 in each of its weekly tournaments.
   Big Bear said he was about to pay the group's $25 membership fee
when he learned of the prohibition on long hair.

<HEAD>Georgia Tech Microfilm Disappearance Part of Nationwide Theft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EMILY BENTLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One hundred reels of microfilm copies of U.S.
patents have disappeared from the library at Georgie Tech, and
library officials say it appears to be part of a nationwide theft.
   A library worker noticed about three weeks ago that sections of
the microfilm seemed to be missing, Miriam Drake, dean and director
of libraries at Georgia Tech, said Tuesday. An inventory indicated
100 cartridges were gone.
   ``We discovered it, and then we heard very quickly that the same
thing had happened at the University of Massachusetts. The patent
office notified us immediately that this was going on,'' Ms. Drake
said.
   In addition, 10 other universities that are depositories for
copies of patent records have reported thefts, she said.
   Ms. Drake said that because it appears different blocks of the
patent records from the past 20 years were taken from each
university ``it appears they are amassing a 20-year run of
patents.''
   ``They didn't take everything in one year,'' Ms. Drake said.
``The dates they took from us were from 1971 to 1974 and 1977 to
1978. But in the 1971 period, they took 42 cartridges and only 10
of 1978.''
   William O. Craig, a spokesman for the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, based in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Va., said
Wednesday, ``The matter is under investigation.''
   The loss of the microfilms will not have any impact on the
patents themselves because the Patent Office maintains permanent
records, Craig said.
   Ms. Drake estimated the replacement cost of the reels at
$10,000, but she said ``the real issue is why anybody would want to
steal these.''
   ``We're not talking about secrets or anything like that.
Somebody can come here or go to the U.S. Patent Office in
Washington or the University of Massachusetts and use them.''
   The Richmond (Va.) News Leader reported Tuesday that the FBI was
investigating the thefts.
   Joe Hardy, FBI spokesman in Atlanta, said he was unaware of an
investigation into the thefts.
   Ms. Drake said no suspicious incidents regarding the microfilm
had been reported before the discovery of the theft.
   She said the microfilm is stored in open library stacks, but
there always is an employee in that area when the library is open.
She said the library soon will ``close'' the patent records,
meaning permission will be required to use them.
   She said other schools that have reported thefts of microfilmed
patents are Virginia Commonwealth University, Ohio State
University, Rice University, Texas A&amp;M, and the universities of
Idaho, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas and Utah.

   Dick Fitzsimmons doesn't how he'll react
when he sees Vladimir Kutz of the Soviet Union for the first time
in more than 44 years.
   But he knows the reunion Tuesday with the man he knew as a
skinny teen-ager he helped save from a Nazi concentration camp will
be a happy one.
   ``I never expected to see him again, and when I do, I probably
won't be able to say a word,'' Fitzsimmons said. ``It all just
doesn't seem real.''
   Fitzsimmons was an 18-year-old American infantryman serving in
Germany when he met Kutz, 17, doing slave labor at a Nazi work camp
at the end of World War II in March 1945.
   Kutz is scheduled to fly to the United States from his Moscow
home to Dover, N.H., for the reunion with Fitzsimmons, 63, a
retired electrician in Rutland, Vt., and William Riska of
Connecticut. In August, Kutz is to meet two other men from the old
4th Infantry Division, Robert Nystrom of Harrisburg, Pa., and
Patrick Mealy of California.
   The five will have plenty to talk about because it's likely none
of them them would have lived to see the end of the war if they had
never met. The young prisoner returned the favor of his freedom by
warning the Americans of a German ambush.
   The Americans were ready and ``fought right through them,''
Fitzsimmons remembers.
   The reunion was arranged by John Barr, vice president of the
national Veterans for Peace organization and a member of its Dover
chapter. On a January 1988 trip to the Soviet Union, he was met at
the airport by Kurtz's son, Yuri, who read about his visit in a
newspaper.
   The young Kurtz retold his father's story of being saved by men
of the 4th Division, and provided a few names and hometowns written
on a scrap of paper his father had saved since the war.
   Barr and members of his organization managed to track down the
four old soldiers, who got choked up remembering ``Willie.''
   Vladimir became ``Willie'' to the Americans, ``because we
couldn't pronounce his first name and didn't have time to learn,''
Fitzsimmons said.
   Fitzsimmons has vivid memories of his Soviet friend.
   ``He was a kind of small, rawboned kid,'' he said. ``They didn't
feed him very well.''
   After the ambush, Willie tagged along and was adopted by the
division.
   ``We dressed him and fed him and put him to work as a
machine-gunner for two months,'' Fitzsimmons recalled.
   Though he spoke no English and no Americans spoke his native
Ukrainian, the men were able to communicate in sign language,
Fitzsimmons said.
   When it was time for him to go home, Willie went in style,
Fitzsimmons said.
   ``Some men commandeered a German staff car and we taught Willie
how to drive it,'' he said. ``We gave him the car and sent him on
his way toward Moscow.''
   Barr said this is Willie's first visit to the United States and
that it will coincide with a reunion of 4th Division veterans in
Cherry Hill, N.J. in August.

<HEAD>Officials Free 24 Political Prisoners; U.N. Chief Visits Namibia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Territorial officials Thursday freed 24
guerrillas described as the last political prisoners in Namibia,
and the U.N. secretary-general said the plan for the territory's
independence is on schedule.
   The freed guerrillas of the South-West African People's
Organization sang a tribal ballad as they emerged from the prison
in Windhoek and were escorted home by nearly 200 supporters, who
cheered and jogged with them nearly two miles in a freezing wind.
   Eight jailed SWAPO members, including some responsible for
bombings that killed more than 30 people, have not been designated
political prisoners and remain jailed.
   The U.N. leader, Javier Perez de Cuellar, visited northern
Namibia's Ongwediva refugee camp, home to hundreds of people who
have been repatriated by the United Nations. About 1,200 people
live in tents in the dry, dusty camp.
   Perez de Cuellar also visited a voter registration station and
met with U.N. officials and human rights workers. More than 5,000
U.N. military and civilian personnel are in Namibia to monitor a
yearlong transition to independence after 74 years of South African
rule.
   Several thousand people, many dressed in the red, green and blue
colors of SWAPO, circled Perez de Cuellar when he arrived at the
camp, a U.N. flag fluttering on the hood of his Mercedes-Benz.
   Some held placards claiming harassment by Namibian policemen who
served on a disbanded paramilitary unit known as Koevoet.
   Perez de Cuellar indicated he was pleased with the progress of
the independence plan, which took effect April 1 and includes
elections in November.
   But when asked if he was satisfied with the security situation
in northern Namibia, he said, ``No, I'm not... We have to fight
against intimidation and partiality.''
   After 23 years of war between SWAPO and South African
authorities, local residents are deeply suspicious of Namibian
police, who remain responsible for law enforcement during the
transition to independence.
   Most people in northern Namibia support SWAPO.
   No fighting has been reported in northern Namibia since April,
but territorial officials claim 1,900 SWAPO guerrillas are in
southernmost Angola, near the Namibian border, in violation of a
regional peace accord.
   Police in northern Namibia said Thursday that officers uncovered
an arms cache that included a Soviet-made ground-to-air missile,
grenades, and assault rifles.
   SWAPO denies its fighters are near the border but has not said
why thousands of guerrillas remain in Angola when they are allowed
to return to Namibia as civilians.
   SWAPO also has said it released all 201 detainees that it held.
But relatives, and the freed detainees, have said there were nearly
2,000 prisoners in SWAPO camps.
   In Washington, the assistant secretary of state for African,
Herman J. Cohen, suggested Thursday that former President Jimmy
Carter might go privately to Namibia to observe the November
election.
   Cohen noted that Carter observed the election last May in
Panama. He was testifying before the subcommittee on Africa of the
Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of Representatives.
Afterward, he told reporters he had not asked Carter about going to
Namibia.

   Saboteurs in a ethnically torn areas of Abkhazia
damaged a dam that provides more than half of Soviet Georgia's
electricity, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Armed bands of Abkhazians and Georgians kept shooting at each
other for a sixth day in the Black Sea resort region, Soviet media
said. Violence spread to Poti in western Georgia, where men seeking
firearms attacked a factory and a gun shop.
   ``The situation is very, very serious,'' said Gizo Grzeledze of
the Georgian Foreign Ministry.
   State-run TV showed tourists eating ice cream at an outdoor cafe
in Sukhumi, 870 miles south of Moscow, and said clashes had
subsided.
   About 4,500 Interior Ministry troops were in the region, and a
state of emergency was in effect.
   Saboteurs ``forced the workers of the Inguli Hydroelectric
Station to start letting the waters out of the Inguli Reservoir,
and they virtually forced a halt in the operation of the power
plant,'' reported the Georgian newspaper Zarya Vostoka.
   The dam provides more than half of Georgia's electricity, and
factories in cities throughout the republic suffered blackouts
until power could be patched in from Russia, the newspaper said.
   The story did not clearly state how much water was released from
the dam. It said the water loss will lead to less electricity and
predicted a power shortage in Georgia next winter.
   It said the republic's energy supplies already have been
restricted by the closure of the nuclear power station in nearby
Armenia. The nuclear plant was closed because of fears of
earthquakes.
   Shooting was reported on highways near Ochamchira and Gudauta,
Zarya Vostoka said. Tass reported clashes between armed groups in
the regions around Gulripsh, Ochamchira and Sukhumi.
   Police in Sukhumi had been forced to ``give way to the demands
of people tortured by fear and rumors, who surrounded the district
Interior Ministry building and demanded the return of their hunting
weapons for self-defense,'' said the Communist Youth League
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   Authorities confiscated more than 2,500 firearms and 466 pounds
of explosives, according to Radio Moscow and Izvestia.
   The violence has claimed at least 18 lives since it began
Saturday in Abkhazia, a 3,320-mile autonomous region in Georgia.
Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Thursday that 339 people have been
injured, including 30 policemen and seven internal security troops.
   At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest in the past month
in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.
   Georgians outnumber Abkhazians 240,000 to 90,000 in Abkhazia and
both sides claim discrimination by the other. Many Abkhazians
demand that it be designated a 16th Soviet republic.
   Authorities banned visitors to the region, where millions of
tourists vacation every year, Tass said.
   Special flights are evacuating the thousands of tourists who are
stranded in Abkhazia by interrupted road and rail transport,
Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   Tass said rail lines southeast to Tbilisi were restored Thursday
but the northwest line to Russia was still closed. Authorities
stopped vacationers from going to the seaside area, Tass said.
   Under a state of emergency, large outside gatherings are
forbidden, private cars are banned and all firearms must be
surrendered to authorities. An 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew also was in
effect.

   Atiqullah, 7, was caught in a cross
fire and his wounds became infected. He would have died like
countless others, but foreign volunteers found him and took him
away for treatment in Europe.
   Tens of thousands of children are among the estimated 1.3
million victims of the civil war that has ravaged Afghanistan for
11 years.
   Fighting has disrupted access to much of the mountainous nation.
Moslem guerrillas control most of the countryside and the communist
government's army has the cities.
   The United Nations says fewer than 30 percent of Afghanistan's
10 million people have access to medical treatment and three of 10
children die before their fifth birthday, the highest infant
mortality rate in the world.
   At least one in 10 Afghan children suffers from disease or
injuries related to the war.
   Atiqullah's wounds could have been treated after he was shot
seven months ago, but they remained open and became infected
because of a shortage of surgeons and antibiotics in the
deteriorating health-care system.
   Ultimately, however, Atiqullah was among the lucky ones. On
Monday, he boarded an airplane for the first time in his life to
begin a journey that may see him fully recovered and back home in a
year.
   He was one of 20 children who arrived in Frankfurt on Thursday
for advanced medical treatment arranged by a West German volunteer
organization.
   ``If he is left here, he is going to die in four weeks,'' said
Dr. Eberhard Thoma of Friedensdorf (Peace Village) International.
``He is in a devastating state.''
   ``What we see (in Kabul) makes us sick,'' said Ronald
Gegenfurtner, president of Friedensdorf International. ``Imagine
what is happening in the countryside.
   ``We are shocked to see the large number of innocent Afghan
children who are suffering from a war aided by so-called civilized
countries and superpowers.''
   The Kabul government is sponsored by the Soviet Union and the
United States supports the Moslem guerrillas who have fought it
since a communist coup in April 1978.
   Friedensdorf International came to Afghanistan in December and
has helped treat at least 88 children wounded in the war. About 25
of them have returned home.
   Wolfgang Martens, a Friedensdorf spokesman in West Germany, said
the latest group flew out of Kabul on Monday during rocket attacks.
   Three girls and 17 boys aged 5-12 were in the group. Thoma said
at least seven had bone marrow infections and ``to get them cured,
we will have to operate several times.''
   ``There is no way you can perform these operations in Kabul,''
he said. ``The hospitals here just don't have the facilities.
   ``In some hospitals, they don't have bandages. They use ordinary
cloth, sometimes torn from the garments of victims, to tie up
wounds.''
   Gegenfurtner said members of Friedensdorf International would
return in three months to pick up another group of children.

<HEAD>Mechanic Guilty of Selling Military Secrets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Turkish native once employed by the U.S.
Army as a mechanic was convicted Thursday of conspiring with a
soldier to sell American military secrets to the Soviet Union and
East Germany.
   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated about 6{ hours Wednesday
afternoon and Thursday before finding Huseyin Yildirim, 61, guilty
of one count of conspiracy to commit espionage.
   He could be sentenced to 30 years and life in prison for his
part in a scheme to steal secrets from the super-secret National
Security Agency's Field Station Berlin from 1983 to 1988. Experts
have said the plot did significant damage to American intelligence
efforts because Eastern bloc nations got access to information on
U.S. electronic eavesdropping capability.
   Defense attorney Lamar Walter said he would move for a new trial
within a week.
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield said he would schedule
sentencing after a pre-sentence investigation is conducted.
   Yildirim, who worked for the Army as a civilian mechanic in West
Berlin, was accused of conspiring with Warrant Officer James
William Hall III to sell classified information to Eastern bloc.
   Hall was an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic
and coded messages. Yildirim worked for the Army as a civilian
mechanic in Germany.
   The trial was held in Savannah because Hall was stationed at
nearby Fort Stewart at the time of his arrest last December.
Yildirim now lives in Belleair Beach, Fla.
   Hall pleaded guilty at a court-martial in March. He was
sentenced to 40 years in prison and dishonorably discharged from
the service.
   Hall did not testify in the trial, although the jury saw him in
a secretly made videotape which implicated Yildirim as his contact
with East German agents.
   Yildirim wasn't called to testify, and the defense presented no
evidence.
   Walter told the jury in his closing statement that Hall was
solely to blame for the espionage.
   ``The evidence you heard is sufficient to convict him (Hall),
but not my man,'' Walter told the jury. ``Mr. Hall is very
definitely a guilty man. The man is not capable of being believed.''
   According to prosecution witnesses, Yildirim carried documents
to the Soviets and East Germans and then returned with money for
Hall.
   Incriminating evidence, including a letter described as a
``shopping list'' of U.S. military information, was seized by
authorities at the homes of Hall and Yildirim.

   Coal miners walked off their jobs
in five more regions, but the Siberian strikers who started the
Soviet Union's worst labor unrest in decades were told Thursday to
return to work by dawn Friday.
   ``We have agreed to interrupt the strike, not to end it,'' said
Vyacheslav G. Akulov, a strike committee member in Prokopyevsk in
Siberia's Kuznetsk Coal Basin.
   The strike committee asked the estimated 150,000 strikers in the
region to return to the pits at dawn Friday after a government and
Communist Party commission agreed to give them greater control over
their industry, Akulov said. The commission also agreed to improve
the miners' food, housing and working conditions.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said the concessions granted
the miners in the Kuznetsk region will apply to all miners
nationwide. State-run TV repeated that promise Thursday night in an
apparent effort to end the country's worst labor unrest since the
1920s.
   Some Siberian miners have already returned to work. Tass said
nine out of 11 mining centers were operating, and Prokopyevsk's
central Victory Square was empty Thursday night after nearly two
weeks of rallies and demonstrations by thousands of strikers.
   But the strike spread in other areas as miners raised demands
similar to those of the Kuznetsk strikers, who began the walkout 10
days ago.
   Miners in the northern town of Vorkuta, the Don River city of
Rostov and the Ukrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk,
walked out Wednesday with demands similar to those of the strike
instigators in Kuznetsk, Tass reported. Dnepropetrovsk is in the
Donetsk coal basin, the nation's leading coal region.
   On Thursday, more than 16,000 miners in Soviet Central Asia's
Karaganda region, the country's third-largest coal field, refused
to go down into the pits and were massing by the thousands for
rallies, Tass and the government newspaper Izvestia reported.
   Miners at three shafts in Chervonograd in the western Ukraine
joined the walkout Thursday night, said Anatoly M. Dotsenko, a
spokesman for the Ukrainian Helsinki Watch Group.
   Official news reports did not say how many miners were on strike
nationwide. The coal industry employs more than 1 million workers.
   Vorkuta workers striking at nine of the city's 13 mines asked
the Kremlin for an ``urgent resolution of the sharp economic and
social problems of the coal sector, and also specific problems of
workers of the far north,'' Tass said.
   Miners in Rostov demanded extra pay for evening and night
shifts, longer vacations and an increase in the price of coal to
world market prices, the news agency reported.
   Workers striking at 11 mines in Dnepropetrovsk made 24 demands
similar to those of the Kuznetsk miners, reports said.
   Karaganda strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete
news accounts of miners' demands in the Kuznetsk strikes, according
to Tass.
   The government compromised on most of the 39 demands made by the
Kuznetsk miners, who walked off the job July 11. One of the biggest
demands was for economic independence.
   Akulov said that starting Jan. 1, the Kuznetzk coal basin will
become economically autonomous.
   ``The Coal Mining Ministry will continue to run the mines, but
the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels
and allocating the profits,'' said Akulov, one of two
representatives on the regional strike committee from the town of
Anzhero-Sudzhensk, the northern-most coal settlement in Kuznetsk.
   Television quoted Coal Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov as saying
all Soviet coal operations would become economically independent.
   Akulov, whose weathered, gaunt face is typical of the miners in
the region, said the Kuznetsk miners would hold the government to
its word.
   ``If the government doesn't keep its promises, we will go back
on strike. That's in the agreement,'' he said.
   He and other strike leaders described the settlement
negotiations as ``open and very constructive.''
   ``Our politics have gotten freer under perestroika,'' said
Akulov, referring to Gorbachev's economic reform program. ``But our
living conditions have not improved.''
   Another strike committee member, Alexander S. Kukaletov, said
housing conditions remain poor and there were severe shortages of
sugar, other foods and consumer goods.
   Prokopyevsk's small wooden huts cling to the rolling hills and
expansive birch forests of Siberia. Some houses, most of which are
heated by coal-burning stoves during the long winter, sit next to
piles of slag and other mine debris.
   The youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said the government has
promised to send extra meat, butter, sugar, tea, leather footwear,
furniture and cars to relieve shortages in the region.

   Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday the
Federal Reserve has shifted its emphasis from fighting inflation to
avoiding a recession, a signal that the central bank likely will
continue to cautiously push down interest rates.
   ``Recent developments suggest that the balance of risks may have
shifted somewhat away from greater inflation,'' Greenspan told the
House Banking subcommittee on domestic monetary policy. `` ... What
we seek to avoid is an unnecessary and destructive recession.''
   Greenspan, in his semiannual report to Congress, confirmed that
after a yearlong campaign of trying to curb inflationary pressures
by nudging up interest rates, the central bank has reversed course
in response to widespread evidence of economic softness.
   He said he did not see signs of a recession ``at the moment,''
but conceded that ``some day, some event will end the extraordinary
string of economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982.''
He added that he did not want a mistake by the Federal Reserve to
be the cause.
   The central bank chairman would not respond directly when asked
by panel members whether interest rates would continue to decline,
but he indicated he did not soon forsee another shift in policy.
   ``It is not desirable to do too many wiggles,'' he said.
   Greenspan said the Fed loosened its grip on credit twice _ once
in early June and again early in July _ and that the stimulating
effects of lower interest rates were just now beginning to be felt.
   Private economists interpreted the central bank chairman's
remarks as a clear sign that monetary policymakers, with caution,
would continue to allow interest rates to fall as a stimulant to
economic activity.
   ``My feeling is ... he's willing to ease further, particularly
if there's further sign of softness in the industrial sector,''
said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government
securities dealer in New York.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, Michael Boskin, President Bush's
chief economic adviser, praised the Fed's recent action to lower
interest rates, but declined to say what he thought the central
bank's next move should be.
   ``I don't like to preach to the Fed in public,'' he told the
Joint Economic Committee.
   However, earlier this year, when the Fed was pushing interest
rates higher, both Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady
didn't hesitate to say they thought Greenspan and his colleagues
were overly concerned with inflation.
   Greenspan said the Fed was gratified by the government's two
most recent inflation reports, for June, showing a modest 0.2
percent rise in the Consumer Price Index and a small 0.1 percent
decline in wholesale prices.
   But, he cautioned, ``It's clearly premature, with one month's
data, to suggest that inflation pressures are behind us. Certainly
they are not.''
   And, he said, ``inflation remains high _ clearly above our
objective.''
   Economist David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass.,
forecasting firm, said Greenspan's testimony indicates monetary
policy makers will not move precipitously.
   ``They're not quite sure that inflation is as dead as it looks
now. As long as they're not, they're going to move as slowly as
they can get away with,'' he said.
   In setting preliminary monetary growth targets, Greenspan said
the Fed had decided to leave the growth rates unchanged for this
year and next year as well.
   For M-2, the measure of the money supply which includes currency
in circulation and interest-bearing checking accounts, the Fed said
it would aim for an increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent
both this year and in 1990.
   Greenspan also released a revised economic forecast which showed
that the central bank still hopes to achieve a so-called soft
landing in which growth will slow enough to cool inflationary
pressures but not decline so much that the country is thrown into a
recession.
   The Fed predicted modest economic growth, as measured by the
gross national product, of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent this
year, slowing to 1.5 percent to 2 percent in 1990. That compares
with the Bush administration's more optimistic projection of 2.7
percent in 1989 and 2.6 percent in 1990.
   The Congressional Budget Office on Thursday forecast a 2.4
percent rate of growth this year, slowing to 2 percent in 1990.
   The central bank forecast that consumer prices would rise by
between 5 percent and 5.5 percent this year, up from last year's
4.4 percent increase, and slowing to between 4.5 percent and 5
percent in 1990.
   The administration, meanwhile, is looking for a 5 percent rise
in consumer prices this year and 4.1 percent next year. The CBO is
looking for inflation a half point higher than the administration,
in the upper range of the Fed's 1989 projection.

<TEXT>
   African foreign ministers agreed in
principle Thursday to form a pan-African military force to help
black states resist incursions by South Africa.
   The Organization of African Unity's council of ministers adopted
a recommendation calling for a joint defense force but put off its
creation pending a study on how it would be funded.
   The 50-member OAU has been plagued by financial problems
throughout its 26-year history. Many members are badly behind on
their annual dues.
   The organization has considered assembling a similar force in
the past, but the idea has never passed the conceptual stage.
   Sylvestre Nganzimana, an OAU assistant secretary, said the
proposed force would be made up of military units from members
nations which could be called up as a unified force.
   ``What is envisioned is a force that would assist the frontline
states, which have suffered incursions and destabilization by South
Africa,'' he said. ``It would also work closely with national
liberation organizations and act as a peacekeeping and observer
force.''
   The financial study was not due to be completed until next year.
   The OAU's defense commission, which brought the recommendation
to the council, noted in its report that the United Nations
estimates the cost of keeping one of its typical peacekeeping
forces in the field for six months at about $150 million.
   The frontline states comprise Angola, Botswana, Mozambique,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   The foreign ministers were meeting in Ethiopia's capital city
this week to draw up an agenda for a conference of OAU heads of
state. The meeting opens Monday.

   A second White House guard has been placed on
administrative leave while the Secret Service investigates possible
violations involving a late-night tour last year, a spokeswoman
said Thursday.
   Jane Vezeris refused to identify the second uniformed guard who
worked with Officer Reginald deGueldre, the guard who has
acknowledged giving lobbyist Craig Spence and his friends a private
White House tour in July 1988.
   DeGueldre, who also told The Washington Times he accepted an
$8,000 gold Rolex watch from Spence, was placed on administrative
leave last week pending the outcome of the internal investigation.
   Spence has been linked to a homosexual call boy ring that is
under investigation by U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens for possible
credit card fraud.
   Vezeris said the agency is looking into whether any procedures
were violated by allowing Spence on a private tour of the White
House and whether anything improper behavior, such as the
acceptance of gratuities, occurred. She did not know when the
investigation would be finished.

<TEXT>
   The World Court on Thursday said
the United States has no right to compensation from the Italian
government for Italy's seizure of an American-owned plant 21 years
ago.
   The five-judge panel ruled 4-1 that Italy did not breach the
1948 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, as alleged by
Washington, when it seized the Elettronica Sicula, or ELSI, plant
in Palermo in 1968. It also voted 4-1 to deny compensation to the
United States.
   Stephen M. Schwebel, the court's only U.S. judge, opposed the
decision.
   ELSI was a cathode-ray tube factory wholly owned by Raytheon
Corp., a major defense contractor, and by another American company,
Machlett Laboratories Inc.
   Italy contended the mayor of Palermo seized the company to
safeguard the jobs of about 900 factory workers after the owners
announced plans to liquidate the firm.
   According to the U.S. complaint, the company was then sold to a
subsidiary of a conglomerate owned by the Italian government ``at a
price far less than market value,'' and Raytheon was never
compensated.
   No specific compensation amounts were demanded in court, but
U.S. sources have claimed privately that American damages in the
case were more than $6 million.
   The court, officially known as the International Court of
Justice, is the legal arm of the United Nations. It has no
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its
decisions.
   In court, the United States complained that a ruling on the case
by an Italian court was delayed 16 months after the seizure until
ELSI was sold.
   The judges said ELSI was on a ``course to bankruptcy'' even
before it was seized.
   ``What really deprived Raytheon and Machlett as shareholders of
their right to dispose of ELSI's ... property was not the
requisition but the precarious financial state of ELSI ultimately
leading inescapably to bankruptcy,'' they said.
   Voting in favor were the court's Argentinian president, Jose
Maria Ruda, as well as judges Roberto Ago of Italy, Shigeru Oda of
Japan and Sir Robert Jennings of Britain.
   Schwebel said in a separate document attached to the ruling that
ELSI's seizure was an ``unreasonable and capricious'' measure that
``deprived Raytheon of its right to control and manage and, hence,
liquidate ELSI.''
   The ELSI case was filed in February 1987 after years of
diplomatic bargaining failed to resolve the issue.
   In 1986, the World Court denounced U.S.-sponsored military
action against Nicaragua and U.S. support for the anti-Sandinista
forces known as Contras.
   Earlier that year, in an apparent anticipation of the adverse
decision, Washington withdrew its recognition of the unlimited
jurisdiction of the court but said it would continue to accept
jurisdiction in some cases, such as the one involving Elettronica
Sicula.

<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker's former personal aide
testified Thursday in his federal tax evasion trial he didn't have
any way to prove that cash advances he took while at the PTL
ministry were for business use.
   David Taggart said under cross-examination by prosecutor David
Brown that proper record keeping would have helped determine
whether sums of money he drew from PTL accounts were taxable or not.
   Taggart, 32, and his brother, James, are charged with evading
$525,000 in income taxes after taking nearly $1.2 million in PTL
money for their own use during a four-year period beginning in 1984.
   Under questioning by defense lawyer Ben Cotten, Taggart said
that as a vice president of the ministry, he had direct authority
from Bakker to take large cash advances, sign PTL checks, use PTL
credit cards and authorize bonuses for PTL employees.
   Taggart said he left PTL in early 1983 because of exhaustion and
job burnout. He said Bakker and his wife, Tammy, called him
numerous times with generous offers to entice him to return.
   ``He told me `David, you've killed yourself for the ministry for
$25,000 a year (as assistant music director from 1978 to 1980 and
from 1980 to 1983 as Bakker's personal assistant). Now the ministry
is in a different position and I'm willing to pay you $100,000 a
year,'' Taggart said.
   Taggart said he recalled telling Bakker, ``I want access to the
same resources that you have. But I also want to control my money.
I don't want a house or a car to be given to me.''
   Taggart said that on his return, he had authority to take large
cash advances, which he said were used primarily for trips by the
Bakkers on ministry business. He said he needed large amounts of
cash on hand at all times.
   ``Many times on a trip I would advance Tammy Bakker some cash
and she would reimburse it,'' he said. That was true of dozens of
other members of the Bakkers' entourage, he said.
   Taggart's brother James testified Wednesday that as PTL's
interior designer he was an artist who left the business dealings
to his brother.
   ``I always have been lax about documentation. It's never been a
priority,'' David Taggart said.
   Taggart's testimony came a day after Bakker invoked the Fifth
Amendment in refusing to answer questions in the trial. His
10-minute appearance was with the jury not present.
   Bakker and former top PTL aide Richard Dortch are scheduled to
go on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and wire and mail fraud charges.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation allowing rival newspapers to
publish under a Joint Operating Agreement fails to save daily
newspapers and should be repealed, the editor of a Michigan weekly
told a House panel Thursday.
   ``It has encouraged concentration of newspaper ownership,
peculiar competitive practices and lessened the vigor and quality
of newspapering,'' Michigan editor W. Edward Wendover told the
Judiciary Committee panel.
   However, Jerry Friedheim, president of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association, testified that the act ``helped the
marketplace evolve and prosper.''
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, called the hearing 19 years after
Congress approved the Newspaper Preservation Act, which allows
newspapers in the same city to merge business operations when one
of the papers is in danger of failing. Newsgathering operations
remain separate.
   ``In 1970, the act was hailed as a necessary means of preventing
daily newspapers from falling victim to fierce market forces,''
Brooks said. ``Yet, since passage of the act, some estimate that
over 200 papers have ceased operation.''
   Wendover, editor and publisher of the weekly The Community Crier
in Plymouth-Canton, Mich., testified on behalf of Michigan Citizens
for an Independent Press. That group, made up of 1,400 readers,
advertisers and employees of The Detroit News and Detroit Free
Press, filed a lawsuit in August to block a JOA between the two
papers.
   Gannett Co. Inc., which owns The News, and Knight-Ridder Inc.,
owner of the Free Press, say the JOA is needed to allow the Free
Press to survive.
   The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on the case this
fall. There are 18 active JOAs in the United States.
   ``The principle of a free press cannot be maintained when the
biggest newspaper chains enjoy unregulated monopoly status,''
Wendover said, calling on Congress to repeal the act.
   Harsh criticism came from Bruce B. Brugmann, editor and
publisher of the 70,000 circulation weekly San Francisco Bay
Guardian. Brugmann also testified against the act when it was being
considered in 1969.
   ``Never have so many given so much to so few for no good reason
at all,'' Brugmann said, charging that the only people to benefit
from JOAs are publishers.
   The JOA between the two San Francisco dailies, the Examiner and
the Chronicle, Brugmann said, has led to less competitive
journalism.
   Also critical of the act was Louis Mleczko, a reporter for The
Detroit News and president of Local 22 of The Newspaper Guild of
Detroit. Mleczko, who is opposed to the proposed Detroit JOA, said
Congress should repeal the act and force giant chains to compete.
   ``Newspapers are more than just businesses, only concerned with
the bottom line. They are a public trust,'' Mleczko said. ``The
Robber Barons live. It's time for Congress to break up the trusts
again.''
   Brooks said his Economic and Commercial Law Subcommittee would
study the testimony and decide whether further hearings are needed.

   An Italian pilot flying a homemade replica

   Zanardo Juan Carlo took off from Calais airport at 5:25 p.m. in

later, he landed at the airport at Manston in southern England.
   The 48-year-old aviation enthusiast duplicated the journey of
french aviation pioneer Louis Bleriot, who made the same trip on
July 25, 1909.
   The latter-day version was accompanied across the Channel by six
other planes: four Pipers and two Tiger Moths.
   The flight was organized by a group of Italian amateur aviation

<HEAD>Meat Packer Agrees to Sell or Close Companies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Chicago meat packer, convicted last year on
two counts of bribery, has signed an agreement with the Agriculture
Department to sell or close two companies, officials said Thursday.
   Walter S. Mander, owner of Lincoln Meat Co. Inc., and Lincoln
Provision Inc., was convicted in 1988 of bribing a federal meat
grader. The department then moved to withdraw federal inspection
from both companies.
   Officials said that after one day of hearings before an
administrative law judge, Mander on July 12 signed an order
agreeing to divest himself of the two companies _ Lincoln Meat
within 90 days, and Lincoln Provision within one year.
   Assistant Secretary Jo Ann Smith said the consent order signed
by Mander was with the department's Food Safety and Inspection
Service, and the Agricultural Marketing Service.
   The order provides for withdrawal of federal inspection and
grading services if Mander fails to sell or close the plants. Such
withdrawal effectively bars a company from selling meat across
state lines.

<HEAD>Nevada's Income Growth Paces the Nation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nevada's income growth, driven by the state's
tourism and mining industries, outpaced other states during the
year ending last March, while income growth in Wyoming trailed the
rest of the country, the government reported Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said said that non-farm incomes rose 9.4
percent nationally in the 12 months ending March 30. But the
national average masked disparities among states and regions of the
country.
   Nevada paced the country with a non-farm income increase of 15
percent, the department said.
   Nevada's income growth was fueld by the hotel and resort
construction demands of its tourism industry and a healthy mining
industry, according to department analyst Rudolph E. DePass.
   Nevada was followed by Florida whose non-farm income was up 12.1
percent; California, up 10.7 percent; Vermont, up 10.5 percent, and
Virginia, up 10.5 percent.
   With inflation rising at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, the
figures showed those states stayed well ahead of the increase in
prices.
   Other states did not fare so well.
   Last-ranked Wyoming saw non-farm income growth rise only 5.7
percent, pulled down by declining construction and services
industry, DePass said.
   Other states at the bottom-end of the rankings were West
Virginia, up 6.3 percent; North Dakota, up 6.4 percent; Oklahoma,
up 6.9 percent, and Alaska, up 7.2 percent.
   By region, the Far West led the nation with an overall income
growth of 10.5 percent, followed by the Southeast, 9.9 percent; and
New England, 9.6 percent.
   Other regions and their income growth rates were: Great Lakes, 9
percent; Mideast, 8.9 percent; Plains, 8.8 percent; Southwest, 8.6
percent, and Rocky Mountains, 8.2 percent.
   DePass said differences in non-farm income growth between
coastal and interior regions continued to grow smaller from the
first quarter of 1988 to the first quarter of 1989, although
coastal growth continued to outpace the inland areas.
   The Commerce Department focuses on changes in non-farm income as
a better indication of a region's prosperity because of the often
erratic nature of farm incomes.

   If Ernest Hemingway _ that aficionado of big
guns, feisty bulls, lusty reds and really short sentences _ were
alive today, the pugnacious Papa would be spoiling for a fight.
   The object of his disaffection would be ``The Best of Bad
Hemingway'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $7.95), a compilation of
the best entries to a now-defunct annual competition of Hemingway
parodies. The ersatz Ernest contest was sponsored by Harry's Bar &amp;
American Grill, whose ingenious milking of an extremely tenuous
Hemingway connection deserves induction into the Publicists' Hall
of Fame.
   Hemingway, who would have been 90 on July 21, was no stranger to
parody. His second novel, ``The Torrents of Spring,'' was a cruel
mimickry of Sherwood Anderson, an early mentor Hemingway thought
was washed up. But when his own prose became well enough known to
be parodied, Hemingway was hardly a sport.
   ``The parody is the last refuge of the frustrated writer,'' he
said after E.B. White spoofed him with a piece called ``Across the
Street and Into the Grill.'' ``The greater the work of literature,
the easier the parody. The step up from writing parodies is writing
on the wall above the urinal.''
   All of the Ernie-wannabees in this collection are long on puns
and short on commas. Among the titles: ``The Snooze of
Kilimanjaro,'' ``In Another Contra,'' ``Hills Like White
Heffalumps,'' ``The Old Man and the Seal,'' ``A Clean Well-Sighted
Ace,'' ``A Lean Well-Tighted Space'' and ``A Clean Well-Lighted
Race.''
   When author George Plimpton, who wrote the introduction to the
book, was asked in a recent interview to select a favorite entry,
he mentioned Daniel Hardy's ``The Last Good Martini,'' which
mangles more than a half-dozen Hemingway titles in its few short
paragraphs:
   ```Do you want to order dinner?' said Nick. `They still serve
the big two-parted liver.'''
   And later: ```Do you remember George Tell?'
   ```Yes,' said Francis. `He was a swell bowler. For whom does
Tell bowl now?'''
   Plimpton also mentioned the parody by Lee Ewing, ``The Question
Hung in the Air'':
   ``He knew what they must do on this day. It was a month with no
R.
   ```Come,' he said. `It is the day of the running of the
oysters.'''
   Plimpton explains in his introduction that the parody contest
was dreamed up in 1978 by an advertising man named Paul Keye for
Harry's Bar &amp; American Grill in Century City, Calif., near Beverly
Hills.
   The American Harry's was a replica of Harry's Bar in Florence,
Italy. Keye knew Hemingway never went to the Harry's in Florence
but was a devotee of the original Harry's Bar in Venice and often
featured it in his stories.
   His copy promoting the competition warned contestants that they
would have to face ``The White Bull That Is Paper With No Words on
It.'' All entries had to be limited to one type-written page and
had to mention Harry's Bar _ favorably. The winner was flown to
Florence for dinner at the other Harry's (lodging was not included).
   The thousands of entries that poured in took the contest
organizers by surprise, and the contest grew bigger every year,
with celebrity judges such as Plimpton, novelist Joseph Wambaugh,
science fiction writer Ray Bradbury and Jack Hemingway, the
author's son. Television crews gathered for the reading of the
winning entry. Harry's decided to end the competition after a
decade because it was devoting more time to running it than its
restaurants.
   Plimpton was asked what he looked for when he judged the entries.
   ``It has to be funny; it has to echo the style of author. I
think the skill in copying the primary source would be utmust, then
the imagination in developing the idea,'' he said by telephone from
his office at the Paris Review, of which he is editor.
   In later years the entries were pre-screened and the judges read
only the best entries.
   ``The Best of Bad Hemingway'' is rounded out by spoofs of the
author by well-known writers, including F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Raymond Chandler and Plimpton himself, whose ``The Snows of
Studiofiftyfour'' is a skillful mutation of Hemingway's writing
style and a Truman Capote-esque sensibility.
   Gary Piepenbrink, who edited the collection for Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, said he thought the book was fairly evenly divided
between those who parodied Hemingway because they loved him and
those who did it because they reviled him.
   Hemingway, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in
1954, put a shotgun in his mouth and committed suicide in 1961.
   ``He's a literary force that everyone will have reckoned with
somehow,'' said Piepenbrink in a telephone interview from his San
Diego office. ``His stature is not to be challenged. His place is
secure in modern literature.
   ``I don't think the collection diminishes Hemingway,'' said
Piepenbrink, who reveres the author. ``Some of the parodies are
pretty cruel, but he can take it. A lesser writer couldn't endure
all these punches.''

   Getting a tan in order to improve your looks
raises your risk of skin cancer, wrinkles, eye damage and changes
in the skin's immune system, a new report says.
   No health benefits are known from cosmetic tanning, except that
``tanned skin may have positive psychological value by creating an
enhanced image of personal worth,'' said the report by the American
Medical Association.
   The price can be high _ premature wrinkles, dryness and leathery
skin; a heightened risk of skin cancer; damage to the eyes, and
genetic changes that may compromise the skin's ability to fight
invaders, the report said.
   ``Despite the hazards, many people cannot be dissuaded from
sunbathing or using artificial tanning devices,'' said the report,
written by the Chicago-based AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs
and published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   The council recommended these guidelines for people who insist
on tanning:
   _Minimize exposure to ultraviolet radiation, the component of
sunlight that causes tanning and burning, by staying out of the sun
between 10 a.m and 2 p.m. and wearing a hat and protective clothing.
   _Beware of surfaces such as sand, snow, ice and concrete that
reflect sunlight and can intensify the effects of the sun's rays by
10 percent to 50 percent.
   _Use a sunscreen, with a sun protection factor of at least 15
for skin that burns easily or tans only gradually, or higher at
greater elevations or for other intensive exposures. A person
wearing a sunscreen with a protection factor of 15 would get the
same amount of radiation exposure after 15 hours in the sun as he
would in one hour if he were wearing no sunscreen.
   _Keep babies out of the sun as much as possible and apply
sunscreen to older youngsters who are to be outdoors for long
periods.
   _Avoid tanning machines. Exposure to their radiation may
increase the risk of skin cancer, even though most modern machines
use the ``safer'' form of ultraviolet light, called UV-A, rather
than the more dangerous form, UV-B.
   People with extremely fair skin or severe reactions to sunlight
should never use such booths, it said.
   If tanning equipment is used, people who tan moderately well
should limit their exposures to 30 to 50 half-hour sessions per
year or less, use a properly calibrated device with a timer, keep a
record of exposures, wear protective goggles and make sure an
attendant is nearby in case of an emergency, the report said.
   Becca Essman, executive director of the Suntanning Association
for Education, an industry group, reacted to the report by saying
that tanning parlor operators have already responded to medical
concerns about radiation.
   ``Tanning is a part of life that probably will never go away,''
she said in a telephone interview from the association's
headquarters in Frederick, Md. ``And we think indoor tanning
facilities give people in general an opportunity to not burn, to
avoid the overexposure.''
   The association's 1,500 member facilities make up about
one-quarter of the U.S. indoor tanning industry, Ms. Essman said.
   The group has drafted a code of ethics, developed a training
program for parlor operators and promotes safety measures, she said.
   The Council on Scientific Affairs is a 15-member panel of
doctors and other health specialists whose job is to compile the
latest scientific information on topics of interest to the AMA.

   Suicide is the second-leading cause of death
among Maryland prison inmates, according to federal researchers who
suggest that convicts be examined for mental health problems before
incarceration.
   Scientists from the National Center for Health Services Research
in Rockville, Md., found that mentally disturbed inmates were at
the highest risk of committing suicide.
   White, male prisoners ages 15 to 34 had a greater risk of
killing themselves than the general prison population, the
researchers said in Friday's edition of the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Prisoners in that age group also tended to kill themselves twice
as often as people of the same age in Maryland's general
population, the researchers wrote.
   ``I think the situation of prisoners in Maryland is the same as
that in many states,'' said Greg Shipley, a spokesman for the
Maryland Division for Correction. ``They are faced with long prison
sentences and a loss of hope that puts them in a very depressed
state.''
   Dr. Marcel Salive from the center and fellow scientists studied
206 deaths of male convicts in Maryland state prisons between 1979
to 1987 and found 37 were by suicide, second only to heart disease,
which killed 48 inmates.
   The researchers noted that their results could not be applied to
the nation's prison population, estimated at about 500,000, because
suicide rates vary from prison to prison and the type of prison
population.
   Salive said the absence of suicides among women inmates might be
explained by the fact that women make up only 3.5 percent of the
Maryland prison population.
   The researchers said psychotic or psychiatrically disturbed
inmates are at the highest risk.
   The researchers suggested that convicts be evaluated for mental
health problems before incarceration.
   In addition, ``We should train the staff to be more watchful of
pre-suicidal behavior, such as people who get depressed or isolate
themselves or have attempted it in the past,'' Salive said in a
telephone interview.
   Of the prison suicides, 32 inmates hanged themselves, two
slashed themselves, two overdosed on drugs and one fell to his
death.
   White prisoners are twice as likely as blacks to commit suicide,
the researchers said. They also confirmed previous studies that
found inmates who serve a life sentence are more likely to commit
suicide than other prisoners.
   Most studies of inmate suicides have been done in local jails,
which house newly arrested people as well as convicts, the authors
said. Prisons hold only those convicted and sentenced.
   Suicide is the leading cause of death in jails and is nine times
more common in jail populations than in the general population,
said Lindsay Hayes, an assistant director for the National Center
on Institutes and Alternatives, a private, Alexandria, Va.-based
group seeking better jail conditions.
   Suicides are less common in prisons than jails, Hayes said.
Because only convicted felons are sent to prison, ``they've been
through the crisis of jail and they are hardened, more experienced,
and less fearful of the unknown,'' he said.
   Shipley said Maryland prison officials are trying to fight the
suicide problem by installing in some cells collapsible clothing
racks that will not support the weight of a body.
   In addition to removing pipes and clothes and towel racks or
making them collapsible, corrections systems can help prevent
inmate suicide by making tearable prison clothing, sheets and
blankets that cannot support a body, Hayes said.
   ``I don't like gimmicks, though,'' Hayes said. ``I prefer
counseling and increased monitoring. Suicides are best prevented by
other human beings.''

   The Senate wants the State Department to
consider the implications of the June massacre of Chinese
pro-democracy demonstrators on the switch of Hong Kong to China's
control in 1997.
   An amendment offered by Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and approved
Wednesday night by the Senate in work on the $4.6 billion State
Department authorization bill, calls for a report on the
implications of the massacre and for the agency to cooperate with
allies to ensure Hong Kong's political stability.
   ``Beijing must realize that one of the costs of the massacre may
be changes in the conditions under which China regains sovereignty
over Hong Kong. The British have already signaled to China that
they intend to accelerate the process of democratization in Hong
Kong,'' Bradley said.
   ``This amendment shows our support for the efforts of the United
Kingdom, and underscores the importance we and our allies place on
the continued political and economic well-being of the people of
Hong Kong in 1997,'' Bradley added.

<HEAD>Thailand Pushes for Cambodia Truce after Vietnam Praise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and
other top officials tried to rally support Thursday for their
proposal to declare a truce in the Cambodia war.
   They were reacting to Vietnam's praise of the idea Wednesday.
Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said he agreed with the
proposal by Chatichai this year for a truce before Vietnam's
pullout.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and installed
the current government, has said it will pull its 60,000 to 70,000
forces out by Sept. 30. It said it will do so even without a
settlement.
   However, Thach said on official Radio Hanoi: ``The Cambodian
issue cannot be solved peacefully without a cease-fire.
   ``Therefore, Vietnam fully supports the Thai prime minister's
proposal that the Cambodian parties sign a cease-fire agreement in
Bangkok, and considers this as part of a political solution to the
Cambodian issue,'' he said. The broadcast was monitored in Bangkok.
   Asked for his reaction Thursday, Chatichai said he had not yet
received the report. But he added that ``if the four Cambodian
parties agree, it would be great.''
   The Cambodian government has been battling a coalition of three
guerrilla groups, including the communist Khmer Rouge. The
communist group ruled Cambodia for almost four years, killing
hundreds of thousands, until they were driven out by the Vietnamese.
   Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila of Thailand told reporters the
truce issue should be raised at an international conference on
Cambodia starting Sunday in Paris.
   He said a truce could be signed there, but he added that he
thinks it will be impossible to get the Cambodian factions to agree
on it.
   Cambodian government leader Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
chief of the three-party guerrilla coalition, in May agreed in
principle to a cease-fire. But the Khmer Rouge, the largest and
most hard-line guerrilla force, rejected a truce unless Vietnamese
forces first withdraw under international supervision.
   Another Radio Hanoi broadcast Thursday said Hun Sen stopped in
Hanoi the day before en route to the Paris talks and conferred with
Prime Minister Do Muoi and Thach.
   The radio said the two sides agreed that the basis for a
solution lay in what they said was the consensus reached at two
rounds of talks in Indonesia the past year _ the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops and ``elimination'' of the Khmer Rouge.
   Sihanouk has demanded a government joining the Hun Sen
administration and all three guerrilla groups, but Hun Sen has
rejected Khmer Rouge participation because he says it would ignite
more war.
   Hun Sen apparently plans no major concessions. The official
Cambodian news agency SPK said he told a Australian official
visiting Phnom Penh Monday that he was prepared for more fighting
if need be.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congresswomen, saying they want to reclaim
the ``middle ground'' in the abortion debate, Thursday introduced a
bill to fund birth control and fertility research.
   Reps. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine,
said they are trying to broaden the abortion-rights base and seize
control of the debate from abortion foes by attracting people from
both sides of the issue as well as the undecided.
   ``This is a comfort zone for people who don't want to line up
for or against abortion,'' Schroeder said.
   ``We're not going to sidetrack the debate on abortion,'' Snow
said, but the congresswomen want to broaden it to address the
conditions that lead to the need for abortion.
   The Supreme Court's ruling earlier this month giving the states
broader authority to limit women's rights to terminate their
pregnancies has thrown the abortion debate into the state
legislatures and governors' offices. Abortion-rights advocates and
opponents have been bracing to steer the issue in their states.
   ``We've got to start reclaiming that middle ground'' to broaden
the pro-choice base and reach out to people who may be
uncomfortable in either camp on abortion but who support the need
for better contraception, Schroeder said.
   With more than 3 million unintended pregnancies in the United
States each year, more attention has to be focused on preventing
pregnancies, they said. Additionally, one out of six U.S. couples
is infertile or cannot conceive within one year of deciding to have
a child, they said.
   ``Clearly, we need to encourage birth control and fertility
research,'' Schroeder said.
   Currently, the federal government is spending about $9 million
annually on contraceptive research, she said.
   The bill would fund three birth control research centers and two
fertility research centers that would do clinical research and
development as well as develop education programs and distribute
medical information.
   The centers would receive $20 million in fiscal year 1990, the
same amount in 1991, $12 million in fiscal 1992, $12.5 million in
fiscal 1993 and $13 million for fiscal 1994.
   The bill would also authorize a loan repayment program for
graduate students or health professionals who conduct birth control
or fertility research.

<HEAD>Virginia Approves Private Toll Highway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN McNAIR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's transportation board on Thursday
approved plans for a private toll highway that the builder said
would be the first in the country in 30 years.
   The Commonwealth Transportation Board voted unanimously to
approve the Toll Road Corp. of Virginia's proposal to build a
15-mile, $155 million extension of the Dulles Toll Road in
traffic-clogged northern Virginia.
   The vote came after intense negotiations between the state and
the corporation, which is headed by Ralph L. Stanley, former chief
of the federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration.
   ``We've got a lot to be proud of,'' said Byron E. Waldman,
northern Virginia's representative on the board. ``We're willing to
look at creative and new ways to meet our state's needs.''
   The company still must seek approval from the State Corporation
Commission, which will regulate the amount of tolls. The company
has said tolls would start at $1.50.
   Stanley said he hopes the SCC will act as soon as possible and
construction can begin by December. He said the highway should be
finished by the end of 1991, about 15 months ahead of when the
state could complete the project.
   ``We couldn't be more pleased, particularly with a unanimous
vote,'' Stanley said.
   ``I don't minimize the historic nature of it,'' he said. ``I
think it's a whole new era of funding for not just highway projects
but infrastructure through the state.''
   Bill Woodwell, a representative of the Toll Road Corp., said
land for the project is largely being donated by developers and
other landowners on the assumption the road will increase the value
of land near it. The company is still negotiating with some small
individual owners, and may have to buy some parcels.
   The land donations are one of the main reasons the company will
be able to build the road so much faster than the state, Woodwell
said.
   Stanley said the road would be the first private toll highway
built in the country in more than 30 years.
   ``There are, I would say, at least 30 states I know who are
going to be very interested in what happened here today,'' he said.
   The Virginia General Assembly passed legislation in 1988
allowing private companies to fund and build roads in the state.
   Stanley said he could foresee more private funding of roads,
bridges and wastewater treatment plants, particularly in small
communities.
   State transportation officials acknowledged that the private
company could build the road faster and at a lower initial cost,
but they said it would cost far more in the long run because the
company must pay higher interest rates than the state. That would
increase tolls, they said.
   Ray D. Pethtel, the board's commissioner, said the public's
overwhelming support for the private road outweighed such concerns.

   An emotional dispute has broken out in West
Germany over whether imprisoned German soldiers who spread
propaganda for their Soviet captors during World War II were
traitors or heroes.
   ``Many people consider these people traitors. But that's not the
case. They were opponents of the (Nazi) regime,'' said Peter
Steinbach.
   Steinbach, a Passau University historian, arranged an exhibit
called ``Resistance to National Socialism'' that has generated
controversy.
   The failed July 20, 1944 attempt by German generals to kill
Hitler is included in the Berlin exhibit, as are the wartime calls
for anti-Nazi actions by a group of university students known as
the White Rose.
   In both cases, those brave enough to oppose Hitler were tortured
and executed.
   But along with documents and photographs showing such widely
recognized attempts to disrupt the Third Reich is a controversial
display about thousands of captured German soldiers in Soviet
prisons who opposed the Third Reich and wanted the war to end.
   Some members of the National Committee for a Free Germany did
propaganda work for the Soviets during the war, using loudspeakers
at the front to urge German soldiers to quit fighting.
   That part of the exhibit has angered Germans who do not believe
the soldiers deserve the same place of honor as people like Claus
von Stauffenberg, who was executed for planting the 1944 bomb meant
to kill Hitler.
   Hartmut von Hoesslin, brother of another German officer involved
in the 1944 plot, Maj. Roland von Hoesslin, was at the exhibit's
opening on Wednesday.
   Hartmut von Hoesslin said the display on imprisoned German
soldiers ``insulted all resistance-fighters.''
   A protest letter presented by Hartmut von Hoesslin to the
exhibit's organizers said propaganda by the imprisoned soldiers
amounted to ``psychoterror'' against fellow German troops.
   But Steinbach said members of the National Committee for a Free
Germany deserve a place in the exhibit and argued they saw
themselves not as opportunists who wanted to placate Soviet
captors, but as authentic opponents of Hitler's rule.
   ``They felt they were representatives of the Allied cause to
stop the war,'' Steinbach said.
   The dispute has its roots in a long-standing German dilemma:
what kind of honor to bestow on German soldiers who died during the
war, and whether those who deserted are also deserving of praise.
   German peace activists have been behind numerous moves to erect
monuments to World War II deserters, often angering people who feel
it is an affront to those who died fighting.
   There is heated controversy in Bockhorn, where citizens are
embroiled in discussion over the community's memorial to soldiers
who fell during both world wars.
   An open letter from peace activists questioned whether every
fallen soldier deserves to be treated like a hero.
   The letter said, ``They (the fallen soldiers) had participated
in one of the greatest crimes of modern times,'' meaning the
tragedies and terror begun by Nazi Germany when it started World
War II.
   Kark Friedrich Schinkel, an officer in the West German navy,
said in the respected newspaper Die Zeit that such disputes
underscore the difficulties some Germans still have in coming to
terms with their homeland's Nazi past.
   He said such controversies ``raise the question, 50 years after
the German invasion of Poland, whether the concept of individual
heroism can be applied against the backdrop of mass murder.''

   Mars and the moon are lousy neighborhoods with
wretched climates, but the moon's closer and people have been there
before. So if you want to survive on Mars, first go to the moon and
learn how to live there.
   That's the guiding idea behind President Bush's long-range space
challenge to the nation.
   Of several options prepared by NASA and presented to the White
House, the moon-then-Mars plan is the most expensive and complex.
But, ultimately, it could be the most rewarding.
   In contrast to the Apollo project, which Bush celebrated in his
speech on Thursday, the new approach calls for a permanent presence
on the moon. Instead of visiting the lunar surface like Apollo
tourists, Americans would establish a base with a full-time,
long-term staff.
   The NASA strategy calls for frequent flights to the moon and
construction there of living quarters, laboratories and power
stations. The lunar soil would be mined to extract oxygen which
then could be turned into rocket fuel.
   For astronomers, the moon's surface would offer an observatory
site that is unparalleled on Earth. The moon has no atmosphere to
obscure the view of the universe, and it has only one-sixth the
gravity of Earth, which means much larger reflector telescopes
could be built.
   For engineers, a moon base would be a laboratory for a voyage to
Mars. The lunar center would enable the engineers to test concepts
for building permanent quarters for humans in other worlds that
have no air or water. For instance, a ``closed loop'' system, where
oxygen and water is processed and used over and over, could be
developed.
   A lunar base also would enable engineers to use the moon as a
starting point for a trip to Mars.
   Some experts have suggested that a Mars voyager could be built
in lunar orbit, either from components built on the moon, or
ferried there from Earth. Propellant for the craft could be
processed from moon soil.
   The vehicle could then start its trip to Mars by first firing
out of lunar orbit, circling the Earth to pick up a boost from the
planet's gravity, and then streaking outward on an eight-month
excursion.
   Once in the vicinity of Mars, the craft could put equipment on
the surface and then land personnel to build a base, using the
lessons learned from the moon.
   A base on Mars would be much more difficult than a lunar center.
The red planet is blasted by massive storms in its unbreathable
atmosphere of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, argon and oxygen.
   But Mars may have water, vital for human existence, and its
surface may be more Earth-like than any of the other solar system
planets.
   Another base could be built on Phobos, a moon of Mars, and soil
there mined to produce oxygen and hydrogen, a combination that
makes a powerful rocket propellant.
   Such an enterprise would not be of limited duration, as was the
Apollo adventure. It would be permanent, the first step toward
humankind's colonizing the universe beyond the Earth.
   The cost would be hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars,
and it would create an industry employing hundreds of thousands of
people on Earth, and scores on the moon and Mars.
   Why do it? The only sure benefit is new knowledge. And experts
believe that the effort would cause a great leap in technology,
just as Apollo boosted technology in the 1960s.
   Beyond that, there's national prestige. Somebody's going to do
it, and the president wants it to be the United States.
   Bush spoke with pride Thursday about the first footprint and the
first flag on the moon being American.
   He'd like the first words spoken on Mars to also be American.

   An unexpected visit by a group of Soviet students
and professors sent University of Houston officials scrambling to
line up social and educational events.
   ``Yes, we are embarrassed. We certainly don't make a habit of
treating international visitors this way,'' said Willie Munson, the
university's student life director.
   The six members of the Soviet group from Leningrad State
University arrived Tuesday at Houston's Intercontinental Airport
eager to start their ``exchange program.'' But nobody expected them.
   After waiting a few hours at the airport, the group was picked
up by officials from the university's housing department.
   ``We are so pleased to have somebody meet us and feed us. The
people are very pleasant,'' said Elena Krasnova, 31, a teacher at
the Leningrad university.
   Ali Annan, a former students' association president in Houston,
had corresponded with Leningrad administrators for two years. In
May, he wrote a letter suggesting that the summer would be an ideal
time to visit.
   The Soviets received that letter last week, obtained their visas
and caught the first available plane. They also say they mailed a
letter to Annan telling them about their trip, but he has yet to
receive it.
   ``I was shocked,'' said Annan, a May graduate. ``The worst few
moments of my life were then. I ... asked myself if I could be
dreaming.''
   University officials said they are making the best of the
situation.
   ``They're a very nice group of people, very bright,'' interim
school President George Magner said. ``It's their first trip
outside of Russia. We intend to give them a very pleasant and
productive visit.''
   The impromptu plans for the Soviets include trips to the Johnson
Space Center, Astroworld and the port city of Galveston. The group
is scheduled to go sailing and spend time on a ranch, as well as
visit university laboratories and classes.

   Christians and Syrians fought artillery
battles Thursday that rained 30 shells a minute on the city and
sent thousands of residents fleeing in panic. Police said 13 people
were killed and 88 wounded.
   ``Someone call the fire brigade! We want an ambulance too!'' a
woman screamed from the 11-story Kaaki building in west Beirut,
whose top three floors were burning.
   ``Telephone lines are down!'' a man answered from a nearby
building. ``Have faith in God! We're coming to help you!''
   Two 107mm rockets hit Fawzi Rida's apartment on the 10th floor
before dawn. ``I stretched a hand to open the door, but there was
no door,'' he said. ``We have nothing left but the night clothes we
are wearing.''
   Police said 433 people have been killed and 1,780 wounded in the
18 weeks of artillery warfare between Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian
army units and an alliance of Syrian soldiers and Moslem militias.
Thursday's shelling was some of the heaviest in the long battle.
   Tongues of flame shot into the sky over Beirut. Blasted
buildings burned out of control. A police spokesman said damage in
Moslem west Beirut was much worse than in the Christian eastern
sector.
   He reported a heavy flow of civilians from both sides of the
city toward safer areas in south Lebanon, the Bekaa valley in the
east and the mountains northeast of Beirut.
   ``Thousands of cars packed with families headed south from west
Beirut,'' the spokesman said.
   The evacuees used a lull in shelling at midday Thursday to leave
the city, ``carrying whatever personal effects and household items
they could save,'' he said.
   Associated Press photo editor Zouheir Saade said shells fell
near his fifth-floor apartment in west Beirut's seaside Raouche
district.
   ``Our building doesn't have a bomb shelter,'' he said. ``The
only precautionary measure I could take was to distribute my four
sons each in a different room. I thought that was the only possible
way to keep some of them alive in case the apartment was hit.''
   Firefighters were hampered because a power blackout caused a
water shortage. A source at the fire department said two fire
engines used sea water to extinguish some fires overnight.
   The police spokesman said several Syrian soldiers were killed
when Aoun's artillery pounded their bases and artillery
emplacements in west Beirut, but police said they had no precise
information because the Syrians do not report their losses to
Lebanese authorities.
   An estimated 40,000 Syrian soldiers are in Lebanon under an Arab
League peacekeeping mandate granted in 1976, a year after Lebanon's
sectarian civil war began. Aoun calls them an army of occupation
and has vowed to drive them out.
   The police spokesman said Samir Geagea's right-wing Lebanese
Forces, the main Christian militia, joined Christian army forces in
shelling west Beirut.
   ``Aoun's gunners targeted mainly Syrian positions,'' he said.
``Geagea's men rocketed residential areas in west Beirut.''
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a Moslem government
vying for power with the Aoun's Christian Cabinet, pleaded with
leaders of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria to speed up Arab
League efforts for a cease-fire.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command claimed the Syrians started the
battle by shelling the Christian-held coast north of Beirut to
prevent three ships loaded with food from landing. The Syrians
bombard the coast regularly to keep supply ships away from
Christian ports.

   A pro-choice group charged Thursday that two
major newspapers censored advertisements the group wanted to use to
promote this week's television broadcast of its film about abortion.
   The Fund for the Feminist Majority, whose film ``Abortion: For
Survival'' was to air Thursday and this weekend on Turner
Broadcasting's SuperStation TBS, said The Washington Post and The
Los Angeles Times refused to carry the advertisement unless a
picture in it was cropped.
   The picture, from the opening scene of the film in which a woman
undergoes an abortion, shows a woman lying on a table with legs
bent and a nurse standing beside her. The woman's torso is covered
with a sheet, and her bent knees are in the foreground.
   The newspapers said the picture would have to be cropped to show
only the woman's head, said Tamar Raphael, a spokeswoman for the
group.
   The group refused, and the ads did not run, she said.
   Virginia Rodriguez, public relations director at the Post, said:
``We do try to allow the advertiser the widest possible latitude,
but we do reserve the right to ask people to make certain
adjustments if we feel they need to be made.'' She declined further
comment.
   Laura Morgan, public information supervisor for the Los Angeles
Times, said the Times is a ``family newspaper'' and objected to the
ad because the photo showed ``a woman with her knees apart and
uncovered. We simply asked that they crop the lower portion of the
ad.''
   She said, ``That kind of request is not at all unusual because
we sometimes ask advertisers to modify their ads somewhat. ... It's
always a question of context and we review ads one at a time.''
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority,
said the action amounted to censorship and ``reveals a serious
double standard for women.''
   ``When these papers are selling commercial products _ like
movies, underwear or bathing suits, they have no problem showing
women's bodies in suggestive positions. Yet, in our ad when a
serious public health issue is at stake, we cannot show a woman's
exposed kneecaps while she is lying on an examination table,''
Smeal said.
   She said the Post told the group it wouldn't print the ad as the
group proposed because it is a family newspaper.
   However, she said, the Post has run in the same section their ad
was to run a picture of a woman ``practically naked in a bathing
suit.'' Also, the Times printed in Thursday's paper in the same
section as the ad was to run ``a photograph of a woman in both
erotic and suggestive position'' as part of a movie ad, she said.
   ``This silly hypocritical standard doesn't make sense and it
limits everyone's ability to advertise serious subjects,'' she said.
   The two newspapers were the only two daily papers the group
sought to run their ad, Raphael said.

<TEXT>
   The director of the National Park Service said
Thursday he opposes legislation being considered by the House that
would speed the return of wolves to the Yellowstone Park area.
   James Ridenour, newly appointed parks director, called a bill
introduced by Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, ``clearly premature.''
   Sponsors believe the administration is moving too slowly to
restore the only indigenous species still missing from the
Yellowstone area.
   But the measure has other members growling.
   Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., called the bill ``blatantly
anti-sportsman'' because wolves kill elk sought by hunters.
   ``This is a meddlesome bill ... an effort to extend the borders
of Yellowstone,'' Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, told fellow members of
the national parks subcommittee of the House Interior Committee.
   Young called wolf proponents ``romantic'' and said they should
see the wolf for what it is, ``without any doubt, second to man in
his ability as a predator against the clove-footed animal.''
   Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said livestock owners will kill the
wolves in defense of their animals ``and I would support that.''
   Ridenour said the park service goal is to return the area to its
natural state as far as possible. He said the Interior Department,
of which the park service is a part, is conducting studies to
determine:
   _If the wolf population can be controlled once it is returned.
   _The effects of the wolves on prey within the park and big game
hunting outside it.
   _The effect on grizzly bears.
   He said the studies would probably be finished by early in the
next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and no environmental impact
statement should be prepared before then.
   Owens' bill calls for an environmental impact statement and
action by the interior secretary after the statement is complete.
   Ridenour said the wording of the bill would make it difficult
for the secretary to make any decision other than returning the
wolves to the park.
   Ridenour urged the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Bruce Vento,
D-Minn., to ``let the scientists do their studies; let the wildlife
advocates, ranchers, park visitors, state and local officials, and
members of Congress comment on the findings; and then let us make a
policy which is driven by our stewardship responsibility.''
   Vento asked, ``Can you give me assurances that there will be no
attempt to short circuit'' the process? He said the administration
already has delayed planned re-introduction of wolves by two years.
   Ridenour said he was trying to avoid a ``headlong rush'' and
said he had an open mind on the subject.
   Dr. David Mech, a world-renowned wolf expert with the Fish and
Wildlife Service, told the subcommittee each wolf eats the
equivalent of three adult elk cows a year, which should not
endanger the population of about 35,000 elk in the Yellowstone area.
   Mech said the elk that died last year of bad weather would have
been the likely prey of wolves.
   If 10 breeding pairs of wolves were established in Yellowstone,
about 500 could be living there by the turn of the century. He said
enough prey, including animals other than elk, exists in the region
to support the wolves without disrupting the ecosystem.
   While admitting that wolves sometimes venture out of the forest
to prey on domestic livestock, he said it was unusual.

   The Navy's report on its investigation into
the explosion aboard the battleship Iowa is expected to take
several more weeks to complete, Navy sources said Thursday.
   A board of inquiry has drafted a report into the April 19
incident, which killed 47 sailors.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the report is in Norfolk,
Va., on the desk of Vice Adm. Joseph S. Donnell III, the commander
of the Naval Surface Forces.
   He disputed a report that discord within the Navy has held it
up, and that the service is having difficulty finding senior
officers to sign it.
   ``I wouldn't describe it as hung up. It's under review,''
Williams said.
   The spokesman said the report must go up the chain of command
for review, and that it will next be seen by the commander in chief
of the Atlantic fleet, Adm. Powell F. Carter Jr., in Norfolk.
   Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost, the chief of Naval Operations will
see the report before passing it to the Secretary of the Navy H.
Lawrence Garrett, who will then refer it to Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, Williams said.
   ``The senior officer, and only the senior officer, at each of
those eschelons of command in the review process will sign the
forwarding endorsement,'' Williams said.
   The spokesman added that at each point, the signatore has the
option of forwarding the report without comment, sending the report
back to the investigating officer for additional work, or
forwarding it ``as is'' and express his disagreement with some or
all of the material.
   ``I'm not implying that anyone has done any of those things
yet,'' Williams said.
   A Navy source, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said
it is expected that each level of command will take about a week to
go over the report.
   ``It won't get here before August,'' said the source.

<TEXT>
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les
Aspin, said Thursday he wants a ``cold turkey'' freeze on funds for
the stealth bomber, and President Bush stepped up his lobbying
effort for the radar-evading plane and other defense systems.
   Aspin, D-Wis., said Congress needs more information on the
costly stealth bomber, as the B-2 plane is known.
   ``The problem this year is ... we don't really know what we
got,'' he told reporters.
   Aspin said he wants to give opponents of the plane, at $530
million a copy the most expensive aircraft ever produced, a chance
to kill the program. But if Congress doesn't want to do that, it
needs more information about the program before moving forward, he
added.
   Bush on Thursday called Aspin and other members of the House
Armed Services and Appropriations committees to the White House. He
pressed them to back his budget proposals for the B-2, as well as
the strategic defense initiative, the MX missile and the Midgetman
missile.
   The House and Senate are scheduled to vote next week on those
programs and a package of Pentagon cuts the administration proposed
to meet the $10 billion reduction agreed on by Congressional
negotiators and the White House for the 1990 defense authorization
bills.
   Bush told the group he is fully committed to that package and
the weapons systems as essential to the nation's deterrent
capability and to the U.S. strategy at the arms reduction talks
ongoing in Geneva, according to Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Given the amount of congressional hesitation, especially
regarding the administration's insistence on not cutting the B-2
program, Bush wanted to re-emphasize his policy reasons for those
programs, Fitzwater said.
   Bush was to host another meeting Friday to lobby those committee
members who could not make the Thursday session.
   Bush is emphatic that the plane ``represents the future of
bomber aviation,'' and is needed despite its expense, the spokesman
said.
   Aspin told reporters after the meeting that he could not predict
which way Congress would go on the Pentagon spending bill next week.
   At the Pentagon, a spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said Aspin's B-2 plan would not meet with his approval. ``Any delay
in the program will only make it more expensive,'' said Pete
Williams. ``He'd be opposed to such a scenario.''
   Cheney reiterated the importance of the B-2 bomber in a meeting
with House Republicans, who are divided on the issue.
   Supporters of the plane were cheered when it made its first test
flight Monday.
   The Pentagon hopes to buy 132 planes at a cost of about $70
billion.
   In fiscal 1990, the Defense Department has proposed spending
$4.7 billion for the B-2, but last month the House armed services
panel cut $800 million from the budget.
   Money for the plane is expected to be the most controversial
item next week when the House and Senate consider the Pentagon
budget bill.
   Reps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., John Kasich, R-Ohio, and John
Rowland, R-Conn., have proposed stopping production after the 13
planes now in the pipeline are completed.
   If their effort fails, Aspin said, he intends to propose funding
production of only two bombers in 1990 and 1991, when the
administration wants eight bombers. His amendment would meet the
full request for research and development work over that period.
   ``I say, give the opponents of the B-2 an up-or-down vote. If
the Congress is willing to step up to this issue this year, I say
let's do it,'' Aspin said.
   He called his amendment ``a cold turkey fence of the procurement
money until Congress acts again.''
   Aspin said his plan ``shuts down the program, but it gives the
administration a chance to come up with another program that's
politically more acceptable _ financially.''
   He said he could not predict how his colleagues will vote on the
issue because there has never been a public debate on the
once-secret program.
   Aspin added he wants the Air Force to ``come up with a cheaper
program'' by seeking fewer planes. ``I don't know anybody who
thinks they're going to get 132 planes,'' Aspin said.

<TEXT>
   The chief of the U.S. military's Southern
Command, Gen. Frederick F. Woerner, is retiring, Pentagon officials
said Thursday. Sources said the outspoken officer was forced out by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Woerner has been critical of Bush administration policy in
Panama and has clashed in the past with the Pentagon and State
Department over policy in the region.
   In a speech earlier this year to a Panama City group, the
general criticized what he called an ``absence'' of United States
policy toward Panama.
   Woerner has served as the commander in chief of the Panama-based
U.S. forces since June 1987. He will retire after 34 years of
service on Oct. 1, and will be replaced by Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman,
the Pentagon said in a statement.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, who released a letter from
Cheney praising Woerner for his ``dedicated service,'' denied that
the change in command had anything to do with the political
situation in Panama.
   One Defense Department source familiar with the situation said
Woerner was forced into retirement.
   ``He was canned,'' said the official, who spoke on condition he
not be identified by name. Another government official made a
similar comment, saying Woerner was being forced out because of
unhappiness with his outspokenness.
   Over the past months, Woerner's troops have been the object of
harassment and intimidation at the hands of Panama's Defense Forces.
   This follows a U.S. campaign begun under the Reagan
administration to oust Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who has remained in power despite the administration's
attempt to remove him following an indictment on drug trafficking
charges in Florida.
   Williams noted that Thurman, who had put in for retirement
himself, was asked to stay on and accept the command.
   The spokesman said Cheney has known Thurman, who is presently
assigned to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command in Fort
Monroe, Va., for years and ``has great confidence'' in him.

   In an article July 19 relating to the
United Airlines DC-10 crash in Iowa, The Associated Press reported
erroneously that federal records indicated past major problems with
the tail engine of the jetliner.
   Federal Aviation Administration records on engine problems that
were obtained by the AP did not relate to engines on the plane
involved in the crash, although other FAA records obtained by the
AP at the same time did relate to other service problems on that
jetliner.

<HEAD>Solidarity Divided Over Whether to Join Government</HEAD>

   Solidarity legislators argued Thursday
over their role in electing Communist Party leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski president and debated whether to join the new government.
   Jaruzelski was elected to the powerful presidency Wednesday by
the National Assembly with 270 out of 537 votes.
   Solidarity's unofficial figures showed that one legislator who
is a member of the independent union movement voted for Jaruzelski,
who tried to crush Solidarity when he imposed martial law in 1981.
   Union spokesmen identified the lawmaker as Sen. Stanislaw
Bernatowicz of Suwalki.
   Eighteen more members of the Solidarity caucus helped Jaruzelski
by not voting or by casting invalid ballots, thereby lowering the
number of votes required for election, union figures showed.
   To win, Jaruzelski needed 50 percent of the valid votes plus one.
   Solidarity also said 11 of the 300 Communist coalition lawmakers
voted against Jaruzelski and 16 abstained. One Communist, Marian
Czerwinski of Debica, said before the vote that he could not
support Jaruzelski.
   Militants complained during a seven-hour meeting of Solidarity
lawmakers that they could easily have blocked Jaruzelski's
election. Deputy Ryszard Brzuzy of Belchatow said he was quitting
the caucus to protest, but later retracted the decision.
   ``I don't think we should have given Jaruzelski something for
free. We should have gotten something in exchange for him being
elected president,'' said Deputy Jan Bielicki.
   Sen. Andrzej Wielowieyski of Katowice defended the votes that
helped Jaruzelski.
   ``Solidarity has decided not to prolong the (leadership)
crisis,'' said the senior opposition senator. He said he cast an
invalid ballot.
   Those ballots seemed to be cast mainly by senior opposition
negotiators who did not want to endanger the political bargain
reached with Communists during talks in April. At the time, it was
tacitly accepted that Jaruzelski would be president.
   Deputy Jacek Kuron, a veteran activist who voted against
Jaruzelski, said lawmakers who followed their consciences should be
respected no matter how they voted.
   Kuron said he favored electing Jaruzelski for the sake of
political stability, but felt pressure from followers to vote
against the man who tried to destroy Solidarity.
   Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said a meeting of the
Sejm, the lower house of the parliament, was tentatively set for
July 27. The session would give Jaruzelski his first opportunity to
nominate a prime minister, who would form the government subject to
legislative approval.
   Communist authorities since June have urged Solidarity to join
them in a coalition government.
   Onyszkiewicz told state TV after the legislators' meeting that
the majority still believe the opposition should not join the
government.
   He added, however, that ``no decisions have been made and the
debate will be continued at the next meeting.''

   Aung San Suu Kyi, who was placed under
house arrest by Burmese military authorities Thursday, appeared on
the political stage less than a year ago to become Burma's leading
voice for democracy.
   The daughter of Burma's assassinated independence hero, Aung
San, she returned to Rangoon, Burma's capital, from her home in
Britain in April 1988 to care for her ailing mother. She found
herself in the midst of an unprecedented nationwide campaign to end
authoritarianism.
   She sided with student protesters and stayed with them after the
September military coup in which troops of Army Commander Gen. Saw
Maung crushed dissent by killing hundreds of people.
   Her campaign rallies commonly draw thousands of people, and
Western diplomats say authorities are concerned she could win a
general election scheduled for early next year.
   The slight frame of Ms. Suu Kyi, 44, belies a steely political
will that brushes off military intimidation and veiled threats
against her life. She had no political experience before last year.
   Many Burmese attribute her widespread support to her
unprecedented denunciation of the military and strongman Ne Win,
whom she charges is still pulling the strings although he
officially retired last year after 26 years of autocratic rule.
   Her first appearance on the Burmese political scene was on Aug.
15 last year, when she attempted to mediate between the protesting
students and the army by writing an open letter to then President
Maung Maung.
   But when she spoke outside Rangoon's glittering Shwedagon Pagoda
on Aug. 26, the height of the pro-democracy movement, she drew what
may have been the largest crowd ever seen in Rangoon.
   An estimated 1 million people packed the streets to hear her
call for democracy and an end to one-party rule. Demonstrators
camped in the streets for days to see her.
   After brutal clampdowns on dissent that killed thousands, the
army crushed open street protest after Sept 18. Ms. Suu Kyi
subsequenty emerged as the most prominent of the Burmese opposition
leaders.
   Her popularity has increased steadily and she has drawn large
crowds during political campaign tours throughout the country this
year.
   In December, crowds filled the streets of Rangoon for the
funeral of her mother, Kyin Gyi, who was Burma's first female
ambassador.
   Her party, the National League for Democracy, is the largest
political opposition group and claims over 700,000 members in
Rangoon alone.
   Over the past month she has openly defied martial law
regulations, which forbid open air political rallies and gatherings
of more than five persons. Her speeches in Rangoon have drawn
crowds of up to 15,000 despite the persistent presence of armed
troops.
   Suu Kyi was born in Rangoon in 1945 and married British academic
Michael Aris in 1972. Her two sons traveled recently to Rangoon.
   She went to school in India where her mother was Burma's first
female ambassador. She won a scholarship to Oxford in 1967 and
obtained an honors degree in politics, philosophy and economics.
   She later worked at the United Nations in New York and in the
early 1980s researched the life of her father and the origins of
Burmese nationalism at Kyodo University in Japan.
   She has written two books, a guide to Burma for children and a
short biography of her father.

   A creek swelled by a surprise storm rose
13 feet in a half-hour Thursday, washing about 10 vehicles off a
bridge and killing a pregnant woman, authorities said.
   Divers battled the raging current of Goose Creek to search for
up to three people seen floating by in a car, but three others were
rescued from the creek, said Lt. David Flohr of the Fauquier County
Sheriff's Department.
   Eight other people managed to escape the fast-moving water on
their own after their vehicles were swept away, said Flohr.
   More than 100 military personnel and rescue workers searched for
the three people seen in the floating car, Flohr said. But rain
started to fall again and the search was suspended after 5 p.m.,
said Sgt. Butler Grant of the sheriff's department.
   The search was concentrated along a one-mile area downstream of
the bridge on U.S. 17. Water from the creek covered the bridge and
carried the vehicles off shortly after midnight.
   Flohr identified the dead woman as Tammy Woolf Conneway of
Bloommerry, W.Va., who was alone in a pickup truck that was washed
into the creek. Her age was not immediately available.
   The creek, which normally runs about 10 feet below the bridge,
rose an estimated 13 feet within a half-hour, said Chuck Thompson,
director of county emergency services.
   He said many drivers tried to cross the bridge despite the high
water. ``It's the age-old story: people forget about the tremendous
force of running water,'' he said.
   The storm caught everyone by surprise, said Thompson. ``We had
no warning whatsoever. There was nothing from the National Weather
Service.
   Up to 3.8 inches of rain fell in nearby Linden Wednesday night,
the National Weather Service said.
   Thompson said the creek receded as quickly as it rose.

   A feud between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and Ariel Sharon became public Thursday, and newspapers said Shamir
might fire the hard-line former defense minister from the Cabinet.
   Sharon, now trade minister, has been challenging Shamir's
leadership of the right-wing Likud bloc. He renewed attacks
Thursday on the prime minister's peace plan, demanding the Cabinet
focus on crushing the 19-month-old Palestinian rebellion instead of
debating the language of peace proposals.
   The former general said on army radio: ``No personal attacks or
threats to fire me will keep me from demanding an end to the murder
of Jews in the land of Israel.''
   Arab reporters said Israeli soldiers fatally shot Tarik Hussein
Imram, 17, in the neck during a confrontation in Burin village near
Nablus in the West Bank. They said a 20-year-old Palestinian was
wounded in the leg.
   In its confirmation, the army said one young man was killed and
another wounded during a search-and-arrest operation.
   Twenty Palestinians were wounded in confrontations with
stone-throwing protesters in half a dozen other towns and refugee
camps in the occupied lands, Arab reporters said.
   At least 572 Palestinians have been killed since the rebellion
began Dec. 8, 1987, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel
captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war. Thirty-seven
Israelis have been slain.
   Palestinians stayed home from work Thursday and closed their
shops as part of a general strike to express rejection of Shamir's
proposal for elections in the territories for Palestinian delegates
to talk peace with Israel.
   About 250 Palestinian lawyers in the West Bank began a
month-long boycott of Israeli military courts to protest what they
describe as the army's failure to notify family members and lawyers
promptly about arrests.
   Brig. Gen. Amnon Strauschnow acknowledged in a recent interview
there had been some delays, which he attributed the bureaucracy,
but said the army had doubled its legal staff to clear up a case
backlog and end confusion.
   In the Nablus military court, the trial of three Arab shepherds
on charges of killing Frederick Steven Rosenfeld, a U.S.-born
Israeli, a month ago opened began without their lawyer.
   Jews stoned Arab-owned cars in Jerusalem and three Arab
motorists were injured, Israel radio reported. It said one was
hospitalized.
   Police detained Rabbi Meir Peretz of Kiryat Arba, a Jewish
settlement near Hebron in the West Bank, on suspicion of damaging
Arab houses in Halhoul three weeks ago, the radio said.
   Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for Shamir, confirmed the prime
minister had received a letter from President Bush condemning the
building of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, where
70,000 settlers live among 1.7 million Palestinians.
   He described the letter as ``friendly, most positive,'' however,
and said it expressed support for the peace initiative.
   Ahimeir would not comment on reports in two major newspapers,
the liberal Haaretz and the independent Yediot Ahronot, that Shamir
was considering dismissing Sharon.
   Shamir's anger erupted in a closed meeting Wednesday of Likud
ministers, where Sharon criticized the premier for not disclosing
details of his talks with Palestinians about election arrangements.
   Newspapers quoted this exchange:
   ``I cannot tell you anything; you leak everything you get your
hands on,'' Shamir responded, and accused Sharon of ``sowing bad
blood and hatred among us.''
   Sharon said, ``I can only laugh at your words. I have contempt
for what you say,'' and Shamir replied: ``He who laughs last laughs
best, and I don't want to speak to you.''
   Several newspapers interpreted Shamir's words as a threat to
fire Sharon. Yediot Ahronot said the prime minister's allies in
Likud were urging him to do so.
   Ahimeir suggested, however, that Shamir wanted to avoid a split.
   ``The prime minister is concerned about the unity of the
Likud,'' the spokesman said. ``He has a high tolerance threshold
and tries to see things in their broadest sense.''
   Sharon, who won fame as an anti-guerrilla fighter and the
general who saved Israel from defeat in the 1973 Middle East war,
favors tougher measures against the Palestinian uprising.
   His popularity has grown because of such events as the July 6
bus crash, when a Palestinian forced an Israeli bus off a highway
into a ravine, killing 16 Jews and injuring 25 others.
   Sharon's most convincing show of power came at a meeting of the
Likud's governing committee July 5, when he succeeded in getting
harsh conditions attached to the peace plan.
   The conditions demand that the uprising end before elections are
held, provide for continued buiding of settlements, prohibit
residents of Arab east Jerusalem from voting in the elections and
reject Palestinian statehood.
   Likud's acceptance of the conditions prompted a threat from the
Labor Party to leave the coalition government and force early
elections. Labor's governing committee is scheduled to meet on the
issue Aug. 9.

   United Airlines Capt. Al C. Haynes' friends and
neighbors said Thursday that the hero label fits the slim pilot who
was named the state's Little League Volunteer of the Year days
before he left on Flight 232.
   The DC-10 Haynes was flying crashed Wednesday in an Iowa
cornfield. Some survivors and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad credited the
pilot with bringing the crippled plane down from six miles up and
saving their lives.
   ``Just knowing him and the way he is, I would have wanted him to
be the man behind the controls,'' said Jim Chavez, who has worked
closely with Haynes in Little League for nine years.
   Chavez said Haynes planned to umpire the district league
championships on Sunday but it rained, so he promised to be back on
Thursday to call the rescheduled games.
   Instead, Haynes and his Seattle-based flight crew are
hospitalized in Sioux City, Iowa, where the Denver-to-Chicago
flight came down.
   Friends said Haynes had a passion for flying since his days as a
Marine fighter pilot during the Korean War.
   He also has a love for baseball and children, and volunteered
the equivalent of over two months of his time a year to the Little
League, Chavez said.
   He trained and evaluated umpires, oversaw games, and was umpire
at the league's 1978 world series in Williamsport, Penn., and at
the senior world series, for ages 13-15 between 1981-84 in
Kissimmee, Fla.
   ``He has a very warm feeling for children. That's why he does
what he does,'' Chavez said. ``He's always willing to help. ...
He's a well-traveled umpire and one of the best.''
   Haynes' Little League activities earned him the 1989 Washington
state Little League Volunteer of the Year award, which was
announced June 27.
   Haynes, first officer W.R. Records, and second officer Officer
D.J. Dvorak were trapped under debris in the DC-10's cockpit and
were removed after a forklift raised the wreckage, said Dr. Romaine
Bendixen of Denison, Iowa, clinic commander of the 185th Tactical
Fighter Group.
   Haynes ``had lacerations behind both ears, lacerations of the
foot and face,'' said Dr. Richard Budensiek of the Marion Health
Center in Sioux City. ``He was a very lucky man.''
   Haynes grew up in Texas and moved to Seattle in 1964, eight
years after he was hired by United Airlines. Records joined United
in 1969 and Dvorak in 1986.
   Flight attendants who worked with Haynes described him as ``one
of the most respected pilots'' at United and ``a competent and
concerned flyer.''
   Haynes ``was in good shape and he was a good pilot,'' said Larry
Desy, a retired United Airlines mechanic who has lived next door to
Haynes, his wife, Darlene, and their three children in south
Seattle for more than 20 years.
   ``He did a hell of a job'' handling the plane, Desy said.
   Records was a pilot for at least 20 years and came to United
from Pan Am when United acquired Pan Am's Pacific routes. He flew
the Seattle-to-San Fransisco route for a year before switching to
the Chicago-to-Seattle route two years ago.

   About 1,000 Greek Cypriot women declared
victory Thursday and left a stretch of the island's ethnic dividing
line after two days of protesting the 15-year-old Turkish
occupation of northern Cyprus.
   The protest had threatened to wreck 11 months of U.N.-sponsored
negotiations on reuniting the eastern Mediterranean island.
   ``We have achieved our purpose of emphasizing the Greek
Cypriots' right of return'' to their homes in the north, said
Athena Violari, one of the organizers. ``This is not the right
place to continue our action for the release of those detained.''
   On Wednesday night, Turkish Cypriot riot police backed by
Turkish soldiers entered St. George's church in the buffer zone
Wednesday night and arrested 100 women and 11 men, including Greek
Orthodox Bishop Chrysostomos of Kition.
   At midnight Thursday, the demonstrators walked backward out of a
narrow alley that marks the line between the Greek and Turkish
communities, singing the Greek national anthem.
   They said they would march on Friday to the home of U.N. special
representative Oscar Camilion and seek his help in freeing the
detainees.
   Many residents of northern Cyprus fled when Turkey invaded on
July 20, 1974, after a short-lived coup against the late President
Makarios.
   The protesters entered the buffer zone by breaking through U.N.
checkpoints.
   After the violence at the church, they withdrew to the nearby
alley and held an all-night vigil, singing hymns and Greek songs
and shouting anti-Turkish slogans.
   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said 108 protesters appeared in
court in the Turkish sector Thursday and were ordered jailed for
two days pending trial proceedings. It was not known what charges
they face.
   The agency said three foreign reporters seized by riot police
had been released. They were Katherine McElroy and Steve Weizman,
both of the British Reuters news agency, and Dutch radio reporter
Hetty Lubberding.
   Ms. McElroy said she and Weizman were injured during Wednesday's
clash.
   ``I wasn't treated well .... I was kicked and beaten,'' Ms.
McElroy, a dual Cypriot-American national, said after her release.
   After he was freed, Weizman was treated for a bayonet wound in
the leg, Ms. McElroy said.
   In a speech marking the anniversary of the Turkish invasion,
President George Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader, pledged
support for the protesters ``who were attacked brutally while they
were praying without provoking anyone.''
   ``We demand the immediate release of those arrested and the
withdrawal of Turkish troops from the buffer zone,'' he told
several thousand Greek Cypriots in central Eleftheria Square.
   Vassiliou said all refugees must be allowed to go home and the
island must be reunified.
   He earlier protested to the U.N. Security Council over the
Turkish move into the buffer zone.
   The women's protest was part of a series of anniversary
demonstrations to protest the Turkish invasion of the island's
northern third.
   Turkish troops moved in after an Athens-inspired coup by
supporters of union with Greece. The Turks said they came to
protect the 120,000-member Turkish Cypriot minority, which forms 17
percent of the island's population.
   The mounting tension threatened reunification talks between
Vassiliou and Rauf Denktash, leader of the Turkish Cypriots.
   The official Turkish Cypriot Radio Bayrak said that sector's
government would meet later Thursday to decide if Denktash should
attend the next round of talks set for July 26.
   Turkish Cypriots attended rallies and held a military parade
Thursday to celebrate the anniversary of the Turkish invasion.

   President Bush extended his sympathy Thursday
to the victims of United Flight 232 and praised the ``extraordinary

   Bush said in a statement:
   ``Barbara and I extend our deepest sympathy to the families and

hearts of all Americans _ go out to them in their time of sorrow.
   ``I am sure I speak for many when I commend the extraordinary

   ``The compassion and generosity demonstrated by the entire Sioux

   ``Today, we pray for the passengers killed on Flight 232. Let us
also ask God to bless their loved ones and those survivors who
remain hospitalized. May they find strength and comfort in their
faith and in the love of family and friends.''
   At least 76 people were killed in Wednesday's crash of the
crippled jumbo jet in an Iowa cornfield, but 174 or more people
survived the accident. Several dozen were still unaccounted for.

   The Iran-Contra criminal case against a former
CIA station chief is imperiled because of the danger of disclosing
certain government secrets, sources familiar with the matter said
Thursday.
   The Justice Department is considering intervening in the case of
Joseph Fernandez, about to be put on trial by a special prosecutor,
said government sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Asked about the Fernandez case, Justice Department spokesman
David Runkel said, ``There are various options that are being
debated.''
   Asked if the options include a move by the department that would
scuttle the case, Runkel said, ``That's not a decision that we
would ever make.''
   ``There are very serious matters being discussed with respect to
the Fernandez case and the discussions are ongoing,'' said Mary
Belcher, a spokeswoman for the office of the special prosecutor,
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   The difficulties revolve around the CIA's fears that too much
information about the agency's activities that is now classified is
being sought for public use in Fernandez' trial.
   Fernandez, the Costa Rica station chief who secretly assisted
former White House aide Oliver North's Contra resupply network in
1985 and 1986, is accused of two counts of obstruction and two
counts of making false statements to Iran-Contra investigators.
   ``The government was notified ... of a new emphasis in the CIA's
position regarding certain classified information which may
substantially complicate the trial,'' Walsh's office said in a
court filing earlier this week which provided the first indication
that the Fernandez case might be in trouble.
   In that filing, Walsh suggested that instead of the trial
starting Monday as scheduled, a hearing be held that day on matters
concerning classified information.
   On hursday, Runkel said he did not know whether exercising any
of the options the department has would put Walsh in the position
of having to seek dismissal of the charges against Fernandez.
   If classified information is too sensitive to declassify but is
needed for a criminal trial, the Justice Department may move that a
summary of the secret information be presented in court instead.
   If the court denies the motijon, the attorney general may file
an affidavit objecting to disclosure of the classified information.
The court must then order that the information not be disclosed, a
step which can lead to dismissal of the criminal case.
   Fernandez was questioned by the Tower Commission and the CIA
inspector general's office in 1987, which led to charges against
him.
   The indictment says that he falsely told the CIA inspector
general's office that a secret airstrip construction project that
was to be part of the Contra supply network was initiated by the
Costa Rican government.
   In congressional tetsimony which cannot be used against him at
his trial, Fernandez admitted that North and the U.S. government
initiated the project.
   Fernandez falsely told the Tower Commission that he did not know
for a fact that North was assisting the Contra resupply operation,
according to the indictment.
   Fernandez is accused in a bill of particulars filed by
prosecutors of making 19 additional statements that were so
misleading that they obstructed the Tower Commission and CIA
inspector general office's inquiries into the Iran-Contra scandal.

   Federal investigators opened undamaged flight
recorders Thursday from the DC-10 that crashed in Sioux City, Iowa,
and began analyzing data and voice tapes.
   The two orange boxes arrived at the National Transportation
Safety Board by Coast Guard plane after they were recovered from
the mangled tail of the United Airlines jet whose wreckage was
strewn about a corn field near the Sioux City airport.
   One box contained a flight voice recorder which has the final 30
minutes of conversation from the DC-10's cockpit. The other has a
data recorder which includes several hours of information about the
flight such as speed, compass heading, and other things recorded
every few seconds.
   Aeronautical engineer Thomas Jacky said the recorder and tapes
were in good physical condition. Their contents are not likely to
be made public for several weeks.

   The congressman who introduced William Lucas
at a Senate hearing on Lucas' nomination to be the government's
chief civil rights enforcer abruptly took back his support Thursday
and the chairman of the committee in charge said he might vote
against Lucas.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., returning to the Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing room where he had strongly urged Lucas'
confirmation a day earlier, said, ``It is with a slightly heavy
heart I come to withdraw my endorsement of Bill Lucas.''
   Conyers said he made the decision after being ``frankly
astounded'' when Lucas told the panel that a series of recent
Supreme Court decisions on civil rights did not undermine
enforcement of anti-discrimination laws.
   ``We are in a crisis in the civil rights movement,'' said
Conyers, who, like Lucas, is black.
   ``If you can't figure out these cases are seriously cutting back
very modest progress that we made, then there is no point waiting
for you to become the assistant attorney general of the civil
rights division for me to argue it with you then,'' Conyers said.
   He stopped short of urging the panel to reject the nomination,
suggesting the committee should give Lucas the benefit of the doubt
and perhaps a chance for on-the-job training.
   The committee chairman, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said at the
hearing, ``I was inclined to vote for him until yesterday.''
   But now, ``I'm inclined to vote against him.''
   ``My doubt about this man doesn't relate to his lack of
experience,'' Biden said.
   He expressed concern about ``whether you're going to have
somebody as assistant attorney general for civil rights who is
going to fight for civil rights.'' He testimony from Lucas on
Wednesday failed to satisfy him.
   ``When I asked him whether we were moving in the right direction
or the wrong way on civil rights he didn't have an opinion,'' Biden
said.
   On Wednesday, Conyers had predicted that ``Bill Lucas will go on
to greatness'' as assistant attorney general for civil rights. ``If
he doesn't,'' Conyers added, ``I will be the first one calling for
his head on a pike.''
   Reacting to Conyers' withdrawal of support, Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., who has been serving as chairman of the hearings, said that
``it obviously hurts the Lucas candidacy _ how much, I can't
quantify.''
   ``In all my 15 years on Capitol Hill, I've never seen anything
like it,'' Simon said. He said the vote on the committee ``is
close.''
   ``It may hurt him some,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., ranking
Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said of Conyers' new stand.
``But I hope that it won't mean much.''
   ``He did say that he believed that the nominee is committed to
civil rights,'' Thurmond said.
   Civil rights groups contend that Lucas, 61, a Republican who
served as sheriff and later chief executive of Wayne County, Mich.,
lacks professional qualifications for the Justice Department job.
   Such criticism has been echoed by some members of the Senate
panel. Lucas has never tried a court case and has practiced law
only since he left public office in 1986.
   Conyers' spirited speech in support of the Lucas nomination was
repeatedly commended to the attention of reporters Wednesday by
supporters while Lucas was being grilled by senators about
questions relating to his honesty and character.
   Conyers had agreed to introduce Lucas after the state's
Democratic senators, Carl Levin and Donald Riegle Jr., broke with
Senate custom and declined to accompany Lucas to the committee
hearing. The senators said they were withholding judgment on the
nomination.
   In his testimony Thursday, Conyers said he was disturbed to
learn that Lucas had told the committee that ``he could live with
these cases.''
   ``I cannot live with these cases,'' Conyers said of the recent
high court decisions that civil rights lawyers say will make it
harder to win discrimination suits in court.
   ``We've got some problems,'' Conyers said. ``We're not going to
wait to get them cleared up. They are going to get cleared up with
me and Lucas today or they are not going to get cleared up at all.''
   Lucas, adhering closely to the Bush administration's policy,
said on Wednesday that he did not regard the decisions as hurting
civil rights enforcement.
   He promised, like Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had already
done, to closely monitor the impact of the decisions on court cases
to determine if legislation is needed to overturn the rulings.
   Conyers telephoned Lucas Thursday morning to say that he thought
Lucas' position on the Supreme Court decisions ``was diametrically
opposed to his own,'' said Julian Epstein, a spokesman for Conyers.
   Lucas' testimony had ``put him in a very difficult position,''
Epstein said of Conyers, who is supporting legislation being
drafted in the House to overturn the effect of several high court
rulings.
   Epstein said Conyers and Lucas had discussed the nominee's views
on civil rights over the past two or three months. ``Mr. Conyers
was led to believe the positions were very much closer than that,''
Epstein said.
   David Runkel, a spokesman for Attorney General Thornburgh,
discounted the significance of Conyers' withdrawal of support,
saying, ``I still expect Mr. Lucas to be confirmed by the Senate.''
   Of Conyers' criticism, Runkel said, ``It is unrealistic for
anybody to expect the nominee of the president for this position
would go before a congressional committee and disown a position
taken by the president and by the attorney general.''

   Senegal Thursday accused Mauritania of
deporting 26,000 of its black nationals following racial violence
that left between 250 and 400 dead in the two countries.
   ``It is to be feared that not a single black Mauritanian will be
unaffected by the measures,'' Senegal's acting foreign minister
said in letter to the U.N. security council.
   Kane Kharass, from Mauritania's U.N. mission said, ``There is no
such policy in my country.''
   Tensions between the black Senegalese and the fairer-skinned,
Arab and Berber Mauritanians have long historical and racial roots,
but a confrontation in April and May began as a minor border
incident. Tens of thousands of Mauritanians and Senegalese were
repatriated in a U.N.-sponsored airlift.
   To reduce tensions, both nations sent home workers from the
other country after the violent clashes, which left between 250 and
400 people dead, Kharass said. He denied Mauritania was expelling
any of its own citizens.
   But Medoune Fall, Senegal's acting foreign minister, said,
``Beginning in mid-May, the Mauritanian government took steps to
expel its black nationals belonging to ethnic groups also found in
Senegal.
   ``In just a few weeks, the operation has affected 26,000
individuals, who have been driven from their own country solely by
reason of their ethnic origin,'' Fall said.
   Those deported to Senegal were arriving completely stripped of
property, he said. Between July 16 and 18 alone, 2,000 blacks were
deported, Fall said.
   Fall said the deportations would increase tensions between the
two countries.
   Mauritania was the last nation in the world to officially
abolish slavery, in 1980. Most slaves were black, while the traders
and owners were usually Arabs or Berbers.
   Hard economic times have worsened ethnic tensions between the
two nations as hundreds of thousands of people have crossed the
border seeking work in the other country.
   Senegal estimates that up to 50,000 Senegalese, mainly seasonal
workers, lived in Mauritania before the latest clashes broke out.
About 500,000 Mauritanians, most of them tradesmen, live in Senegal.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Deadlocked On Drought Relief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee failed to
reach agreement Thursday on a Democratic plan to provide $1 billion
in relief for farmers who are losing crops to this summer's drought
and flooding.
   Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., postponed a vote on the
package until next week after Republican senators argued the
measure covers too many crops and costs too much.
   Leahy said he did not want to risk a vote on the Senate floor
without bipartisan support.
   ``Drought and disaster isn't a partisan issue and relief
shouldn't be either,'' Leahy said.
   The Bush administration has threatened to veto a drought-relief
bill passed by the House last month that is estimated to cost $1.3
billion and cover more than 500 crops, from corn to cherries.
   Senate Democrats, agreeing the House measure is too expensive,
proposed to scale it back by $300 million by reducing the payments
to farmers and tightening qualifications for the program.
   The administration wants to limit the bill to $870 million, but
Democrats say the government can afford an additional $200 million,
if some of the payments to farmers come from this year's budget
instead of next year's.
   The deep division within the committee became evident earlier in
the day when the panel voted 10-9 along party lines to kill an $800
million Republican proposal that would have targeted a greater
share of the drought assistance to crops that are in the
government's price support program _ wheat, corn, rice and cotton.
   ``Where money is limited we must set priorities,'' said Indiana
Sen. Richard Lugar, the committee's ranking Republican.
   Sen. Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican whose state's rice
and cotton crops have been devastated by flooding, said the
Democratic plan would spread the aid so thin ``there's going to be
precious little benefit to anybody.''
   Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, where the winter
wheat crop was cut back sharply by drought, said the GOP plan would
mean an extra 15 cents a bushel for wheat and an additional 21
cents a bushel for corn.
   Dole argues that winter-wheat farmers should get first crack at
drought relief since much of the savings in the farm program that
is being used to pay for drought relief is the result of a smaller
wheat crop.
   ``Where does the money come from? It comes from program crops,''
Dole said. ``If we're going to cover non-program crops, we should
find the money elsewhere.''
   The Republican plan would have provided relief to wheat, corn,
rice and cotton on the same basis as the House bill and the 1988
drought legislation; other crops could have received assistance if
the money was available in the federal budget.
   Dole acknowledged for the first time today that losses have
occurred in at least one other crop _ namely spring wheat in North
Dakota, where drought-related crop losses already are estimated at
$660 million.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., who is concerned about getting relief
for sunflowers and other non-program crops in his state, said the
Democratic proposal was modest and more fair. ``Nobody's going to
get a windfall out of this,'' he said.
   ``An act of God,'' said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., ``doesn't
distinguish between program and non-program crops.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Assault Weapons Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee, going against
heavy pressure from gun owners' organizations, Thursday narrowly
approved a three-year ban on sales of nine military-style assault
weapons.
   ``It's designed to deny drug dealers the use of these types of
weapons,'' said Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., following 7-6
approval at a hectic session ending with a gun lobbyist complaining
about a senator's decision not to vote.
   The measure would ban nine varieties of semiautomatic assault
weapons, five already covered by the Bush administration's import
ban and four others produced domestically.
   The bill also would provide for up to 10 years of additional
prison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms. The
measure would automatically go off the books in three years under a
``sunset'' provision.
   Critics of the measure called it too restrictive, although it
was modest in comparison with a flurry of bills that went into the
hopper in February following a mass slaying in a California
schoolyard with a semi-automatic assault rifle.
   ``I think it does a great deal of damage to the right of the
people to keep and bear arms,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told the
committee. Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the bill headed
in the right direction but should be stronger in banning assault
weapons.
   ``Frankly it is a letdown to the law enforcement groups in
America,'' Metzenbaum said.
   At the start of the meeting, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told the
committee he would not be able to attend because he was tied down
with evidence hearings in the impeachment trial of U.S. District
Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Miami, accused of plotting to obtain a
$150,000 bribe. He then left.
   When it came time to vote an hour later, however, there was a
question as to whether the committee should wait for Specter. The
Hastings hearing was taking place in a room about a three-minute
walk away.
   ``The problem is he's on the Hastings matter and I know he takes
that very, very seriously,'' Hatch said.
   Because of the razor-thin margin, senators held open the roll
call for 10 minutes or more in case Specter might want to vote. A
minute after the vote was announced, the Pennsylvania senator
arrived but told Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
he would need time to study any changes made in the legislation.
   Biden banged the gavel and adjourned the meeting. The chairman
and Specter were both quickly out the door, but Sen. Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa, told reporters that ``as a matter of courtesy
they could have given him five or six minutes to study the bill.''
   National Rifle Association lobbyist Wayne LaPierre, however,
told reporters he had been with Specter ``at the Hastings hearing,
in the back of the room,'' urging him to come to the Judiciary
Committee meeting to vote against DeConcini's bill.
   ``Basically,'' LaPierre said, ``Specter just decided to be
absent.''
   The lobbyist said he still expected the Pennsylvania senator to
be on the side of gunowner groups when the measure comes to the
floor.
   Earlier, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and Republican followers
sought to substitute the Bush administration's omnibus crime
control bill for the gun measure, but that effort failed 8-5.
   Thurmond warned that strong anticrime measures are needed and
cited the case of a South Carolina man convicted of murder a decade
ago. ``He hasn't been electrocuted yet,'' Thurmond said. ``People
are are losing respect for criminal justice procedures.''
   Biden said crime-control measures are needed but not before
President Bush implements broad powers granted him in last year's
drug bill. He said the administration has been authorized to hire
225 new FBI agents but has not done so.
   ``I don't doubt the president's sincerity,'' Biden said. ``I
just don't think he's tough enough.''

   Thunderstorms dumped locally heavy rain Thursday over parts of
Michigan and the central East Coast, causing flash flooding blamed
for at least one death.
   Overnight and morning rainfall in the East included 3.80 inches
at Linden, Va.; 3.90 inches at Flint Hill, Va.; 2.10 inches at
Cacapon State Park, W.Va.; and 2.11 inches at Wilmington, Del.
   Near Warrenton, Va., a creek swollen by the surprise rain rose
13 feet in a half-hour Thursday, washing about 10 vehicles off a
bridge and killing a pregnant woman, Fauquier County authorities
said.
   Southeastern Lower Michigan also had locally heavy rain. Total
rainfall from early Wednesday until noon Thursday included 2.14
inches at Livonia, 2.56 inches at Mount Clemens and 2.66 inches at
Detroit.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended from southern Maine to
Maryland, from southern and western New York state to Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, the southeastern third of
Missouri, eastern Arkansas and from the North Carolina coast to
western North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, southern
Alabama, southern Mississippi and southern Louisiana.
   During the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 2.12 inches of rain fell at
Toledo, Ohio, with 1.86 inches at Wrightstown, N.J.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered over Idaho and western
Montana, as well as southwestern Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 61
degrees at San Simeon, Calif., to 109 at Needles and Palm Springs,
Calif. Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 42 at Gunnison,
Colo.
   Friday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern New England to southern Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and
Louisiana, and from southern Illinois to the southeastern
two-thirds of Missouri; and scattered showers and thunderstorms
over the Rockies and eastern section of the Great Basin, covering
Nevada and western Utah.
   High temperatures in the upper 60s and 70s were predicted along
the northern Pacific Coast; in the 70s from much of Missouri to
Illinois, Wisconsin and lower Michigan; in the upper 70s and the
80s from New England to New Jersey, the rest of the Great Lakes,
the Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, the remainder of the
Mississippi Valley, from South Dakota to northern Texas and along
much of the southern three-fourths of the Pacific Coast; around 100
degrees or above over the interior of central and Southern
California; near 115 degrees through the desert Southwest; and in
the 90s over the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Votes For $225 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate Appropriations subcommittee voted
Thursday to spend $225 million to begin construction of the ``super
collider'' particle accelerator.
   The chairman called the collider project the most important
scientific effort in the nation.
   But the chairman, Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said an
amendment may be introduced in the full Appropriations Committee
that would hold up the $4.4 billion project until foreign
governments agree to participate.
   Johnston, head of the Appropriations Committee's energy and
water development subcommittee and also of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, said he would oppose such a condition.
   ``There's sentiment in our committee to adopt report language
which will, in effect, say don't give away the great technological
contracts to the Japanese or to any other participant,'' Johnston
said.
   Committee reports are not binding, but the reports are very
influential in guiding administration decisions.
   Explaining his support of the collider, planned for a site 30
miles south of Dallas, Johnston said, ``It unlocks the secret of
what we're made of, what the universe is made of, what energy and
matter and all of the basic stuff of the universe is made of and
it's exciting.''
   He said he has ``limited enthusiasm'' for enlisting other
countries to share the cost: ``I think this research is so
important we ought to do it in this country if we can and not farm
it out to have somebody else build the most important technological
parts of it.''
   While President Bush had sought $250 million for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, Johnston said budget constraints forced him to
settle on $225 million. The House has voted $200 million, and if
the project survives, the two Houses will have to agree on an
amount.

   This Missouri River city demonstrated
its big heart and big shoulders Thursday as it pitched in to help
survivors of United Flight 232.
   ``I don't think anyone slept very much. There was a lot of food.
Telephone lines were set up for people to call relatives,'' said
social worker Judy Wiskus. ``There was no hysteria. Everyone was
very calm.''
   Grief was tinged with determination as volunteers poured into
this town of 82,000 that sits on the east bank of a giant bend in
the Missouri River.
   ``It's just an overwhelming sense of disbelief, an overwhelming
sense of grief for the people,'' said Marian Health Center
President Doug Johnson.
   Johnson marveled at the unity of the city, a beef, pork and
grain processing center. Dr. David Greco, head of emergency
medicine at Marian Health Center, said there were two doctors to
every injured passenger at times Wednesday night when injured were
being brought to the hospital a dozen at a time.
   ``It's united most of the time but boy, during a crisis, it's
really united, '' Johnson said.
   Vacationing, off-duty and former employees of the city's two
hospitals pitched in to deal with the emergency.
   ``Our chief of staff chartered an airplane and flew home from
vacation in Minnesota,'' said St. Luke's Medical Center spokeswoman
Sue Conner.
   ``We had offers of help from doctors and nurses at hospitals in
three states,'' she said. ``Several hospital burn units also
offered to send nurses or treat our patients.''
   Rick Griencewic, a spokesman for Briar Cliff College where many
survivors spent the night, said a lot of local businesses and
residents donated food, clothing and toiletries.
   ``Everybody's bending over backwards to help these people. The
community is really coming together to help these people,''
Griencewic said.
   Marian Health Center Vice President Andrew Allen said supplies
arrived from hospitals in Sioux Falls, S.D., and Omaha, Neb.
   ``We probably got five months of inventory inside of three
hours,'' Allen said.
   Psychology students from the University of South Dakota in
nearby Vermillion came to the hospital to help with counseling,
said Cesar Narvaez, a social services worker at St. Luke's.
   Students at Briar Cliff College ``acted just like family'' for
the travelers who were treated, released and spent the night at the
Sioux City school, Wiskus said.
   After people were treated for physical injuries, ``we turned to
their emotions. We encouraged them to talk, to just be as open and
as candid as possible about their feelings,'' Narvaez said.
   Feelings ranged from guilt to anger.
   ```So why me?' The guilt, there are different stages,'' Narvaez
said. ``Sometimes the feelings won't come out until they see
friends or relatives or get to their destination.''
   At the Hair Affair Beauty Salon, proprietor Marsha Barrs had
five customers by early morning. ``Talk in the beauty shop this
morning is what a great job the pilot did. He might have hit a
building nearby,'' she said.
   David Anderson, vice president of marketing at the city's
chamber of commerce, stood in a block-and-a-half line Wednesday
night to give blood.
   ``There were people I didn't even know who volunteered to give
blood, talk to people and donate clothes,'' said Dr. Stuart
Leafstedt, chief of staff at St. Luke's.
   The Siouxland Blood Bank reported that 305 units of blood were
available at the two hospitals. Greco said less than a third of
that blood was needed.

   The fourth annual anarchists' convention
got off to an orderly start Thursday as participants signed up for
workshops including ``Fighting Against the War on Drugs'' and
``Slaying Christ.''
   More than 1,000 people are attending the six-day event.
   ``My vision is to live where we can remove ourselves more from
the world and be self-sufficient,'' said Karry Koon, a nursery
school teacher from McVeytown, Pa.
   ``Very few of the people I work with know that I'm an

   Attendees were greeted by a sign reading ``Bring your own bowl,
spoon, cup.'' They included poets, musicians, teachers, drifters,
clerks, parents, scholars and children.
   When asked who organized the meeting, the answer _ over and over
again _ was, ``No one and everyone.''
   ``Everything is consensus,'' said Yng Tom, a musician who works
at the Bound Together anarchist bookstore in San Francisco's
Haight-Ashbury neighborhood.
   Anarchists generally believe that every form of regulation or
government is immoral and restraint of one person by another is
evil.
   Despite that tenet, the ``mainstream media'' were banned by the
anarchists, who discussed the issue during a general assembly
before the convention got under way.
   ``We decided you guys just aren't going to give us a fair shake,
so we're not going to let any of you in,'' said one young woman,
who appeared to be guarding the entrance to the auditorium where
the conference was held.
   She and a companion refused to identify themselves and were
unswayed by arguments that a selective-media policy contradicts the
principles of anarchy.
   Other contradictions to a classical definition of anarchy were
admitted without embarrassment.
   Bill Somers, a clarinet player in a symphony, brought a
10-year-old boy to the event.
   ``We're definitely against a lot of authoritarian trips,'' said
Somers, adding as he pointed at the child, ``He doesn't go to
school ... And no sugar.''
   As for the sugar mandate, Somers added he ``wouldn't impose
authority on anyone _ except for kids.''
   For those not steeped in this particular brand of anarchy, there
was a ``Anarchy 101'' workshop, one of 16 seminars on Thursday.
   A written guide described it this way, with anarchist
punctuation: ``just what is this anarchy stuff anyway? are you the
guys with black pointy hats who shoot people and blow things up? if
we had anarchy who would pick up the garbage?''
   A workshop on the animal liberation movement read: ``woof. woof.
woof. baaaaa. neigh chirp. chirp. squeek squeek. meow. mooo.
discussions on veganism, vivisection, fur and leather, ecological
connections and more.''
   Among seminars on spirituality was ``Slaying Christ,'' which
discussed methods of ridding the world of so-called patriarchal
religions.
   Anarchist ideals were summed up by a poem posted on the wall by
activist Dave Whitaker:
   ``Take what you need, Give what you can, When you can, However
you can, In other words, Lend a hand.''

   A twin-engine plane caught fire shortly
after takeoff Wednesday and slammed into a house near an airport as
the pilot attempted an emergency landing, killing the man and a
6-month-old baby inside the home.
   The baby's parents and their other four children escaped from the
house with minor injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   The Beechcraft 18 cargo plane appeared to be trying to turn back
to Baltimore-Washington International Airport when it plowed into
the house, said Al Dickinson of the National Transportation Safety
Board.
   The home in this Baltimore suburb was reduced to blackened
rubble, and flames destroyed all evidence aboard the plane,
Dickinson said.
   However, he said the plane's 2,100-pound load was at least 500
pounds under the federal limit, and weather did not appear to be a
factor.
   The plane crashed into the home of Ralph H. Beam III, 33, and his
wife, Janice, 31, about a mile from the airport around 7:20 a.m.,
Anne Arundel County fire officials said.
   The body of the baby, Paul Beam, was found in the rubble about
three hours later.
   As the house burned, ``people were standing around because they
couldn't get in to help,'' said a neighbor, who identified herself
only as Ellen. ``I saw the mother and father come out of the side of
the house by the kitchen, and she laid ... screaming, `My babies! My
babies!'''
   Another neighbor, Barry Majerowicz, 28, said neighbors had to
restrain Beam from returning to the blazing house in what would have
been a dangerous and probably vain effort rescue the baby.
   Centre Airlines operations director Henry Garbrick, whose
Reedsville, Pa., company owned the aircraft, identified the pilot as
Benjamin S. Vitalini, 50, of Le Roy, N.Y.
   The airplane left the airport at 7:15 a.m. on a routine run
carrying packages for United Parcel Service to Winchester, Pa., said
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Duncan Pardue in New York.
   Two minutes later, Vitalini radioed that the plane was on fire
and that he was returning to the airport, but he crashed moments
later, Pardue said. The pilot was alone.
   Thick, white smoke still poured from the ruins of the house more
than two hours after the crash. Neighbors wept as they watched
firefighters cut through the debris and pull chunks of the plane
from the rubble. Charred toys and clothing littered the yard.
   The Beams and their other three children were treated at North
Arundel Hospital and released, said a supervisor who gave her name
only as Mrs. Pasquale.
   Witness Phil Farney said he saw flames shooting from the cockpit
moments before the crash, but authorities said they couldn't confirm
that.
   No flight recorder was recovered, and the 34-year-old aircraft
was not required to carry one, investigators said.
   There are ``garbled'' control tower tape recordings, but
investigators said they had not listened to them yet, Dickinson said.
   Neighbors who feared such an accident have been fighting airport
officials for years to change flight paths away from the heavily
populated area.
   ``In this area the planes come by so close they rattle the
dishes, and you can wave to the people in the planes,'' said
neighbor Karen Stallings.

   A group of Republicans congressman on Thursday
drenched an effigy of a flag-burner with water as a Medal of Honor
winner and a former POW were urging Congress to resist amending the
constitution to ban flag burning.
   When rumors of an impending flag burning swept the Capitol, more
than a dozen GOP lawmakers armed with fire extinguishers and a
bucket of water marched to the scene.
   Two fire trucks were already waiting, as were the television
cameras.
   The flag burning never happened, and the lawmakers were forced
to make do with throwing their water at a stuffed-clothing dummy on
the steps of the Supreme Court.
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said the congressman were
setting an example for Americans who witness flag burnings.
   ``If they don't have a bucket of water, I hope they take care of
business however they can,'' he told the crowd of colleagues and
others protesting the Supreme Court's decision that allows flag
burning as a form of political expression.
   ``You're not going to come to Capitol Hill and burn the United
States flag,'' warned Rep. Larkin Smith, R-Miss.
   The object of Thursday's scorn was Gregory Lee Johnson, whose
conviction for burning of the American flag at the 1984 Republican
National Convention in Dallas led to the court's 5-4 decision.
   Johnson held a news conference in a building across the street
to protest Congress' decision not to invite him to testify. He said
he never intended to burn a flag on Thursday.
   ``I'm not going to, like fall into this silly trap,'' he said.
   Major veterans groups, meanwhile, told the House Judiciary
Committee's constitutional law subcommittee that Congress should
take action to ban flag burnings.
   Two of the groups _ the American Legion and the Veterans of
Foreign Wars _ said a constitutional amendment was the only course
of action. The Disabled American Veterans said it could also
support support a new statute, if one could be drawn that would
pass the court's muster.
   Subcommittee chairman Don Edwards, D-Calif., has said his panel
hopes to produce a statute for House approval before Congress'
August recess. Edwards and others who fear a constitutional
amendment would weaken the Bill of Rights are hoping a statute will
calm the political uproar.
   James Warner, a Marine flight officer who was shot down and
spent 5{ years in a North Vietnamese prison camp, testified that a
constitutional amendment would put American freedoms at risk.
   ``If this amendment be issued by this House, and ratified by
this nation, there will come a deluge against the Bill of Rights,''
said Warner, an attorney.
   ``Our Bill of Rights has served as a legal restraint upon our
government for 200 years,'' he said. ``If these restraints be
removed, we shall not survive as a free nation.''
   Gordon Roberts, who won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam battle,
recalled how he would think of the flags given ``to relatives of
brothers in arms of mine (as) a last token of gratitude for the
ultimate sacrifice.''
   But he said that men do not ``serve this country for the flag
alone.'' He said an amendment to the constitution might spark a
competition among politicians for who could put the toughest
penalty for flag burning.
   ``Each of us that has worn the uniform of this country are fully
aware that the Pledge of Allegiance ends in the words, `And Justice
for All,''' he said.
   On a recent visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Roberts said
he saw the flag reflected on the granite face etched with the names
of the dead.
   ``They were as much a part of the flag as the cloth and
stitching,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A sprawling commercial center with 82,000
residents, Sioux City is best-known for its meatpacking industry and
advice sisters.
   The city is situated in northwest Iowa on the east bank of a
giant bend in the Missouri River, at a spot where the Lewis and
Clark expedition stopped in 1804.
   Sioux Gateway Airport is used by five commercial airlines,
including United. It has about 22 arrivals a day, mostly 737s and
727s, but DC-10s have landed there.
   Two of the city's most famous natives are twins Esther Pauline
and Pauline Esther Friedman, who grew up to write the Ann Landers
and Dear Abby advice columns.
   Meatpacking giant IBP and John Morrell and Co. each operate large
meatpacking operations in the city, as do 10 smaller packing
operations.
   The city is part of Iowa's 6th congressional district,
represented by Fred Grandy, a Sioux City native who starred as
``Gopher'' in ``The Love Boat'' television series.
   The only fatality of Lewis and Clark's expedition to scout the
Louisiana Purchase occurred while it was camped on the river _ just
across from what is now Nebraska. Sergeant Floyd's grave is marked
by a monument overlooking the Missouri.
   The last fatal plane crash at Sioux City occurred in May 1987,
when three people died in a light plane.

   Twelve models of ``Doll Craftin'' may present
a choking hazard to young children and are being voluntarily
recalled by the Nebraska manufacturer, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Thursday.
   The Cupie Dolls, sold as home craft products since June 1982,
are being recalled by Mangelsen's of Omaha. Tests conducted by the
commission show that the dolls' arms may come off, officials said.
   Cupie Dolls are soft plastic unclothed baby dolls with rooted
fake hair, yarn hair or molded hair. The dolls, made in Hong Kong
or Taiwan, were sold in clear plastic bags with cardboard headers.
   Sold under the label, ``Doll Craftin,'' the recalled models are:
Cupie Doll models 155-67, 156-07, 156-09 and 156-13; Sitting Honey
Doll model 156-63; ``Jill Doll'' with Top Knot model 157-96; Honey
Bun Doll models 158-43, 158-45, 158-46; Curly-One Doll models
158-69, 158-70; Sitting Curly-One Doll models 158-71 through
158-76; Honey Dear Dolls models 158-77 through 158-82; and two
unnamed dolls, models 156-61 and 157-97.
   The commission said consumers who have the recalled Cupie Doll
should immediately take them away from young children or return
them to Mangelsen's Inc, 5455 South 90th St., Omaha, 68127, for a
full refund and postage.
   Consumers also may request the next largest size doll, which has
no hazardous small parts, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. and a union representing
more than 2,000 broadcast employees tentatively agreed Thursday to
a new four-year contract after the union offered to compromise on
job security issues.
   The compromise became possible when the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians ``suggested to the company that
the company's four-year job guarantee to NABET was less significant
to the union than the issue of ... seniority,'' the company said in
a letter to its employees.
   The company had offered to make the job guarantee four years
instead of three, but it came with so many escape clauses that it
was ``like a Swiss cheese full of holes,'' said NABET spokesman
John Krieger.
   The company withdrew the job-guarantee proposal and substituted
the seniority list compromise.
   The new rules call for employees on local and network television
seniority lists who were hired before Thursday to have a higher
priority than those hired after Thursday, who will be put on a new,
separate seniority list.
   That new list will be the basis of last hired, first fired
terminations should layoffs occur.
   A separate seniority list for radio employees will be maintained
as the company originally proposed.
   The union's members, 2,700 according to the union, 2,150
according to the company, will vote on the agreement Aug. 11.
   NABET also represents publicists, wardrobe people and
newswriters in certain cities, among other workers.

<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Dalilia skirted the Hawaiian
Islands on Thursday, causing some road flooding, high surf and a
power outage but no major property damage or injuries.
   Dalilia passed about 60 miles south of Hawaii Island,
southernmost in the chain, Wednesday night after weakening from a
hurricane to a tropical storm. A flash flood watch was in effect
for all islands as the weakening storm moved northwest on a course
parallel to the state.
   At 8 a.m. HST Thursday, the storm was about 120 miles south of
Honolulu, moving northwest at 17 mph. Its maximum sustained wind
speed was 58 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that speed
reaches 74 mph.
   Dalilia was forecast to pass 60 miles south of Honolulu, on the
island of Oahu, causing heavy rain, high surf and stiff wind, but
forecasters said the progressive weakening of the storm made it
less of a threat than it was to Hawaii Island.
   Nevertheless, the Oahu Civil Defense Agency advised Honolulu
residents to purchase emergency supplies such as flashlights,
batteries and canned food in case the storm takes a sudden turn
north, spokesman Paul Takamiya said.
   ``Because it seems to staying on a course that will bring it
parallel to the islands, we think the main problem might be from
the rain, hopefully the winds won't be too extreme, but we might
get some flooding'' said Hans Rosendal, the weather service's lead
forecaster.
   ``We got away pretty clean in regard to rain, wind and surf,''
said Harry Kim, Hawaii Island Civil Defense administrator.
   Up to 8 inches of water closed the only highway along Hawaii
Island's south coast, but the road was reopened early Thursday, Kim
said.
   More than 7 inches of rain fell during a 24-hour period in areas
of Hawaii Island's south coast, the weather service said.
   Winds of 35 to 40 mph knocked out a transformer near Pahala,
blacking out the community of 3,000. Kim said electricity there
would remain out until late Thursday.

   A bird in the engine of a United Airlines jet forced the pilot
to make an unscheduled landing in Chicago on Thursday, and a
Northwest Airlines plane developed engine trouble and had to return
to Detroit, officials said.
   In New Jersey, a Continental Airlines 727 returned to Newark
International Airport after a faulty cockpit indicator alerted the
pilot to engine power failure, and a Navy helicopter developed
engine trouble and was forced to land in the Atlantic Ocean about
10 miles off Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.
   No injuries were reported in any of the incidents.
   The slew of mishaps came one day after the fiery crash of United
Flight 232. At least 76 people were killed, and up to 43 others
were missing and believed dead.
   In Chicago, the DC-10 en route from New York to San Francisco
made an unscheduled landing at O'Hare International Airport after
at least one bird was sucked into one of the engines.
   The 265 passengers and 10 crew members on Flight 23 were later
transferred to another airplane and continued their flight, United
spokesman Russell Mack said.
   ``The airplane was leaving JFK Airport, was climbing out after
takeoff, when either a bird or several birds were ingested into the
No. 1 engine, which is on the left side of the airplane,'' Mack
said.
   ``The engine experienced some vibration and the captain shut the
engine down, and then proceeded to ... O'Hare ... where he landed
normally and safely.''
   Earlier in the day, one of the three engines on the Northwest
Airlines Boeing 727 developed a compressor problem, and the pilot
returned the jet to Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said Bob Gibbons,
spokesman for the Eagan, Minn.-based airline.
   ``We had the emergency equipment standing by as a precaution,''
he said.
   Flight 492 was carrying 146 passengers from Detroit to New York
City, who were transferred to another aircraft.
   In Newark, the Continental Airlines 727 made a precautionary
return after a faulty cockpit indicator alerted the pilot to engine
power failure.
   Continental Flight 850, with 137 passengers and six crew
members, left Newark about 11 a.m. destined for Bermuda, said Dave
Messing, a spokesman for Houston-based Continental Airlines.
   ``There was no loss of power in the engine,'' Messing said.
``The indication turned out to be faulty.''
   The faulty indicator was replaced and the plane took off again
at 4:40 p.m., Messing said.
   In Florida, the pilot of the SH-3 Sea King helicopter, Lt. Henry
G. Bridgham, 30, of Monterey, Calif., had to use the aircraft's
other engine to taxi the amphibious helicopter ashore, said Nick
Young, a Navy spokesman.

   Here are the names of 176 surviving passengers of
the crash of a United Airlines' DC-10 near Sioux City, Iowa. The
names were provided by United and from reports from survivors'
families; ages and hometowns were gathered from a variety of
sources.
   The list released Thursday by the airline does not include the
names of the 10 crew members and two non-working crew members who
were aboard the plane and survived. But the names of the cockpit
crew had been released earlier by an airline spokesman; the flight
attendant listed was identified by her parents.
   United also said there may be other survivors whose identities
it has not confirmed.
   United said it was not releasing the names of the dead until
deaths had been confirmed and families had been notified.

   Elected to the newly powerful presidency by
a single vote in parliament, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski now faces the
daunting challenge of trying to salvage a crippled economy as new
strikes break out.
   Because some lawmakers in his ruling Communist coalition voted
against Jaruzelski, a boycott of Wednesday's balloting by a number
of Solidarity legislators may have made the difference.
   The ruling coalition commands a 54 percent majority in the
two-chamber parliament, where a simple majority was needed for
election, but some hard-line Communists are resisting Jaruzelski's
road of compromise.
   Most if not all Solidarity deputies and senators who participated
apparently denied Jaruzelski their votes.

   Miners' strikes have spread to three more of the
Soviet Union's coalfields, Tass reported today.
   The official news agency said coal miners in Vorkuta in the far
north, the Don River city of Rostov in southwestern Russia and the
Ukrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk walked out.
   It said their demands were similar to those of striking miners in
the Kuznetsk and Donetsk coal basins, who are seeking greater local
control over their industries and better wages and living conditions.
   Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, are
the country's two leading coal basins and the strikes, which began
10 days ago, amount to the country's worst labor unrest since the
turbulent 1920s.

   Nineteen cities likely would be given 10 years
to fix their ozone pollution problems, while severely polluted Los
Angeles, Houston and New York would have two decades, according to a
draft of President Bush's clean air bill.
   The multibillion-dollar cleanup plan would set four new
categories for cities with ozone problems _ severe, serious,
moderate or marginal _ and require the most polluted communities to
use the most stringent remedies.
   The Associated Press obtained a draft of the proposal, and then
applied the latest available Environmental Protection Agency air
monitoring data to determine which cities would fall into the two
most serious ozone pollution categories.
   There could be some changes when new air quality information
becomes available, probably next month, but EPA officials said the
number of switches should be small.

   The Energy Department faces more criminal
probes of its nuclear weapons plants _ and mounting public pressure
to close them _ unless it controls their environmental and safety
problems, federal auditors say.
   In a report highly critical of department management, the
auditors said urgent action is needed to ensure that environmental
laws are obeyed and the public is reassured that the government can
reliably and safely run the weapons plants.
   The report dated July 14 was made public Wednesday by a House
panel as a senior Energy Department official disclosed that a
special group of experts from outside the department had been
dispatched to a weapons plant in Colorado.
   Leo Duffy, a special assistant to Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins, said in testimony prepared for a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee that the experts will attempt to verify the origin of a
manmade radioactive element discovered at the Rocky Flats plant near
Denver. The plant processes plutonium for weapons manufacturing.

   The White House and key senators are working on
a compromise that would restrict U.S. contacts with officials of the
Palestine Liberation Organization directly linked to terrorist
attacks on Americans.
   But they were unable Wednesday to persuade hard-line critics of
the U.S. dialogue with Yasser Arafat's organization to give up their
attempt to impose even tighter restrictions.
   ``At this point, it's a wide-open ball game,'' a congressional
source said.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a key sponsor of curbs, was insisting
that President Bush be required to certify that the United States
was not dealing with masterminds and perpetrators of terrorist acts.
Several other senators lined up with him.

   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi landed in a U.S.
jail after being extradicted from Switzerland and pleading innocent
to charges of helping Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos plunder $100
million from the Philippines.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Keenan said at Wednesday's hearing
that he ``wouldn't dream of setting bail'' until Khashoggi's worth
is verified.
   Once among the world's richest men, Khashoggi was said to be the
middleman in the Iran-Contra deal.
   The former fugitive, handcuffed and wearing a green leisure suit,
did not talk with reporters before leaving Kennedy International
Airport with FBI agents. But in a statement released by his lawyer,
Khashoggi said he intends to contest the charges and is confident
that ``my innocence will be clearly established.''

<TEXT>
   They call Warrant Officer Youssef Bitar,
formerly of the French Foreign Legion, the ``bomb magician.'' He
calls himself a ``bomb charmer.''
   Either name fits, for he has defused more than 2,000 terrorist
bombs in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war, probably more than any
other demolitions specialist.
   Bitar, who also fought the Germans with Gen. Charles de Gaulle's
Free French forces in World War II, has survived three assassination
attempts by terrorists whose actions he has thwarted, been shot
twice and blown up by a mine _ all for the equivalent of $200 a
month and free gasoline.
   ``If all the bombs he's defused had gone off, the death toll of
the civil war would have more than doubled,'' said a police colonel,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Bitar is indispensable.''
   More than 150,000 people have been killed in the civil war,
hundreds of them in car bombings.
   When car bombs explode before he can get to them, Bitar can
usually tell after examining the blast scene how much explosive was
used, sometimes even the type.
   Bitar, 61, has defused 300 car bombs outside hospitals, airline
offices, newspaper buildings, embassies, government ministries,
movie theaters, churches and mosques.
   Most of the others were time bombs planted in jetliners,
supermarkets, banks, schools, universities and gasoline stations.
   Bitar estimates the total explosive weight of the bombs he had
defused since 1975 at more than 100 tons, ``enough to blow up New
York.''
   Bitar is a Greek Catholic. But he defies Lebanon's
Christian-Moslem sectarian barriers and regularly races across
Beirut's dividing Green Line to the Moslem sector dodging shells and
sniper fire to defuse bombs.
   The biggest bomb he has dismantled was in the Bir Hassan district
of west Beirut in 1983. It contained 1,320 pounds of TNT with four
Katyusha rockets attached to it, enough to pulverize a city block.
   Bitar said it was apparently planted by the Israelis before they
withdrew from west Beirut after their 1982 invasion.
   ``That was probably the worst disaster I've prevented,'' he said
in an interview in his elegant penthouse apartment in the Sad
el-Boushrieh district of Christian east Beirut.
   The stocky Bitar sat stroking his Siamese cat Rambo on his lap as
he talked dispassionately about his spine-chilling exploits,
gesticulating with hands missing three fingertips.
   He lost one fingertip on his right hand when he grabbed a
detonator, taken from a bomb he had defused, that a police officer
was playing with. It exploded in Bitar's hand.
   He lost two fingertips on his other hand in 1982 when he stepped
on a mine after he had defused a bomb in a Palestinian guerrilla
base in the mountains overlooking Beirut. He was also wounded in the
chest and feet.
   ``That cost me three months in hospital,'' Bitar said.
   Talking of his nerve-wracking exploits seemed somehow incongruous
amid the comfortable domesticity of Persian carpets, brass ornaments
and exotic Oriental decor in his marble-floored lounge.
   Bitar joined the Foreign Legion as a teen-ager when Lebanon was
still ruled by France and served with special forces and demolition
teams in North Africa and Europe.
   ``I was with de Gaulle's Free French forces in Algeria when I
heard about the American atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima Aug. 6,
1945,'' he recalled. ``It sort of kindled my interest in
explosives.''
   After joining the Lebanese army in 1946, Bitar became Lebanon's
top explosives expert. But he really came into his own when the
civil war erupted in 1975 and the car bombings started.
   ``I operate with great faith in God,'' Bitar said. ``But I rely
mainly on intuition _ and a little bit of luck.
   ``I can tell the kind of bomb I've got to tackle the moment I see
it. I try to disconnect it as quickly as possible. I feel as if it's
placed under the bed of one of my children,'' he said.
   ``I never panic. From the moment I see the bomb, I know what has
to be done.
   ``The bombs don't frighten me. But I'm always afraid of the
people who planted them.''
   Bitar said the first assassination attempt against him came as he
was defusing a car bomb in the Barbir neighborhood of Moslem west
Beirut on Sept. 19, 1975.
   ``Two bullets hit my neck and chest, but I managed to finish
dismantling the bomb before I collapsed. I stayed two months in a
hospital that time.''
   Gunmen shot at him, and missed, three years later, as he was
defusing a bomb near the entrance to a movie house in the Moslem
sector.
   The third assassination attempt was in 1985 while he was visiting
the Helou police station in west Beirut.
   ``Someone tossed a hand grenade into the room,'' he said. ``I
threw myself to the floor to grab it and threw it out the window
into the parking lot. No one was hurt.''
   Bitar was retired from the army in 1980, but was immediately
hired by the Defense Ministry.
   ``I don't think of quitting,'' he said. ``When I look in the eyes
of people when I arrive to tackle a bomb, I see their faith in me.
I'll fight the bombers as long as I live.

<HEAD>Eldercare Is Here</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Child-care became an important employee benefit
when a bulge of youngsters worked its way through the population. It
still is, but now Americans are growing older, and elder-care is on
the way.
   It is coming not simply because of demographic dictate; business
efficiency might have even more to do with the development.
Whatever, a growing number of companies concerned with their own
future are considering it.
   Basic to their thinking is the realization that nearly one-fourth
of a typical employer's workforce already provides adult care-giving
services _ for a parent, grandparent or spouse.
   Generally, such services are provided directly and personally at
home. Many of the corporate employees who provide these services
hold critical positions, and as a result their work performance is
sometimes less than efficient.
   Their inability to meet the highest standards often is related to
the strain of their dual reponsibilities. The problem, therefore,
becomes a concern of corporate management.
   Janice Stanger, who holds a doctorate in gerontology, recently
completed a study for William M. Mercer Meidinger Hansen, an
international adviser on employee benefits. She found sound reasons
for considering elder-care.
   She observes that with more and more women entering the
workforce, the number of employees with at-home responsibilities is
hardly likely to decline. These employees often are in their 30s and
40s, which means that not only do they have valuable experience but
also years of further service to offer.
   Already, she suggests, there is evidence that the home-work
conflict may interfere with their performance. It shows up, she
says, in such behavior as missing work, turning down overtime and
training, and even quitting.
   The corporation's role, she says, has two aspects: Long-term care
insurance to pay for medical and associated support services, and
special assistance to those workers with responsibilities for an
older adult.
   Her definition of elder-care refers primarily to the second
aspect, and has as its goal ``to improve the productivity and the
health and quality of life of employed care-givers.'' And, you might
add, the company too.
   The benefit helps the worker cope with three things that make
taking care of elders difficult.
   First, she points out, the frail elderly often have interrelated
needs that involve medicine, finance, and social and psychological
factors.
   Next, the care of the elderly often involves conflicting opinions
and wishes of a number of individuals _ the patient, spouse,
siblings, children. Most of the care-givers can use help in
resolving these conflicts.
   Finally, existing community resources consist of a maze of
federal, state and local public programs, private non-profit
agencies and for-profit providers. The red tape can be overwhelming.
   The elder-care program as she envisions it can be indirect and
direct. The indirect programs involve personnel policies or benefits
which are potentially of value to all employees, such as flextime,
personal leaves and job sharing.
   Direct programs include information, including printed materials,
lectures and other sources; and referral programs to specific
agencies, nursing homes and other resources.
   In addition, they might include support groups and counseling,
and even access to an adult day-care center for the older relative.
Reimbursement programs also might be used to subsidize the cost of
respite care.
   All this sounds expensive, as most benefits are, not just in
themselves but as a growing percentage of business costs. But,
according to the report, the cost of an elder-care program is
usually ``modest and clearly defined.''
   At a time when employers are resisting additional benefits and
even taking away some benefits granted earlier, Stanger believes
they have something to gain with elder-care, because it addresses so
specific a need.
   She calls it an opportunity for them.

   Treasures even greater than those in King
Tut's tomb may still be lying under the desert sands of Egypt.
   ``When I'm asked if there's another Tut's tomb out there, I
always answer at least one, maybe more,'' said Zahi Hawass, director
of the Giza pyramids area outside Cairo and the huge ancient
cemetery of Sakkara, 11 miles to the south.
   ``My guess is we've found no more than 30 percent of what's
buried. After all, Egypt is 97 percent desert. ... We can't begin to
imagine what the sands have hidden.''
   The tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun _ King Tut _ was found almost
intact in 1922 by the British archaeologist Howard Carter.
   It took Carter 11 years more to document the hoard of gold,
semiprecious stones, furniture and knickknacks stuffed into the
makeshift tomb dug into the hills of southern Egypt's Valley of the
Kings.
   But Tutankhamun was a lesser king and the discovery of his tomb
left archaeologists to wonder what treasures might have accompanied
ancient Egypt's great monarchs into the afterlife.
   Some intriguing trophies have eluded both early archaeologists
and their modern successors:
   _Mummies and relics of Pharaoh Cheops, whose pyramid on Giza
Plateau is among the world's best-known monuments.
   _The tomb of the architect Imhotep at Sakkara, where more than
4,600 years ago he built for Pharaoh Zozer a step pyramid, an
architectural feat that quickly evolved into the true pyramid.
Generations of later Egyptians worshipped Imhotep as a god.
   _At least seven tombs of royalty and officials from the New
Kingdom, the era of Tutankhamun and the Ramses line.
   _The tomb of Alexander the Great, the young Macedonian conqueror
who died at the age of 33 in 323 B.C. Records say he wanted to be
buried in Egypt's Siwa Oasis, near Libya, but finally was encased in
a gold coffin in Alexandria, the Mediterranean city he founded.
   _The 50,000-man army of Persian conqueror Cambyses, which
vanished in a sandstorm in 525 B.C. while en route to Siwa to punish
the powerful priests of the temple of the Siwan Oracle.
   Egyptian officials realize the historical value that any of those
finds would entail. But the mammoth job of preserving what is said
already to be the world's greatest national storehouse of
antiquities has halted treasure hunts.
   ``I'm trying to keep what's standing, standing,'' said Sayed
Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. ``What
I'd like to do is to keep what's buried, buried until we can deal
with it. It's usually safer for the pieces not to be exposed to
modern pollutants.''
   As Egypt's population rapidly expands, however, roadways, gas
lines and housing projects unearth a vast ancient legacy just
beneath the ground. Often, excavations are rescue missions.
   Archaeological work in Egypt generally is restricted to the
cooler winter months, and last season's work was filled with
surprises. Giza director Hawass said the results give a glimpse of
what lies ahead when archaeologists begin anew in September.
   In January five magnificent statues that rival the loveliest
artwork the ancient Egyptians produced were unearthed in a pit
beneath the tourist-trampled courtyard of Luxor Temple. Seventeen
more statues, many broken, later were discovered in the cache.
   In March a mummy of a young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in
a gypsum mask, was found on Giza Plateau a few feet from a roadway
through the pyramids.
   Other discoveries ranged from gold to fortresses, some found on
sites once impenetrable except by camel or donkey, now accessible by
paved roads.
   One area to be surveyed in the fall is Giza Plateau's East
Cemetery, a Pharaonic burial ground for royalty and officials beside
Cheops pyramid.
   ``I'm sure we're going to find an intact burial of a prince or
official, because the area never has been excavated properly,''
Hawass said.
   ``In Sakkara, where we know Imhotep is buried, you don't even
need to have shovels and picks to find tombs. You can just use your
hands, dig in the sand. They're there.''
   Modern man owes rich finds to the ingenuity of ancient priests,
who reburied important pieces to ensure survival during politically
troubled times, Hawass said. These caches, which may explain the
Luxor Temple statues, give clues to what may still be hidden.
   He believes the pyramids area contains at least one major cache
from the reign of Old Kingdom Pharaoh Cheops, whose relics include
the world's largest pyramid, a full-sized boat and an ivory statue
so small it can be held between two fingers.
   ``I think out there is Cheops' mummy, maybe statues, maybe
personal items,'' Hawass said.
   ``Four priests were in charge of their safety, but in the next
dynasty (after Cheops) his memory soured. There was a revolt. His
monuments were damaged, perhaps because he made himself a god.''
   Hawass believes that like the Luxor find the Cheops discovery
will be accidental.
   ``We have magnificent statues of his successors (and) delicate
funerary items of Cheops' mother, ... so we know such things did
exist,'' he said.
   ``One day you'll be digging a power line, or cleaning, and there
they'll be.''
   Hawass thinks chance also may locate the long-sought tomb of
Alexander the Great in Alexandria.
   ``We have early descriptions of his tomb, but Alexandria has gone
through many changes,'' he said.
   ``We're not going to find the tomb, if it even still exists, by
going after it. We'll find it by accident, when somebody's digging a
foundation for a house or installing sewer lines.''
   Hawass insists that people who think incredible discoveries
remain to be found aren't dealing in fantasy.
   ``We've got too much evidence,'' he said: ``Kings without tombs,
places we know existed but never were found.''

<HEAD>Five Yale Men Bare Their Souls in Documentary on Midlife Transitions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GORDON FAIRCLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They look like a rather unexceptional
bunch of middle-aged men. Some have receding hairlines, some have
slight paunches.
   They are a former prosecutor from Washington state, a Hollywood
movie producer, a businessman from upstate New York, a Washington,
D.C., psychoanalyst and a banker from Nebraska. Like most men in
their 40s, they have been struggling through that period of
self-examination.
   What sets them apart is that these five have dared to expose the
torments of their midlife crises to the glare of television lights.
   The result, a 90-minute documentary that will air on public
television stations across the country beginning Wednesday, is a
series of candid discussions of marriage, divorce, homosexuality,
infidelity and virility.
   ``What we wanted to do was take a microscope and look at some
real people and hopefully enable the audience to take a look at
themselves,'' said executive producer David Keller, who began the
project as a tribute to fellow members of the Yale Class of 1963 for
their 25th reunion.
   What emerged is not simply the nostalgic lookback he envisioned.
   ``Men are somehow, in this culture, supposed to be strong and
hold their feelings inside and never crack,'' said Robert Knight,
who like the others profiled, graduated from Yale in '63. The film
is ``very worthwhile because it shows people can sit down and
discuss some very sensitive issues and people will listen,'' said
Knight, the banker from Alliance, Neb.
   Richard Snodgrass, the psychotherapist, says in the film: ``Life
for me now is very different from when I was graduating in 1963 .. .
I thought I would have a colonial 1{-story with a green lawn and
maybe a picket fence and a wife who would meet me in pearls and high
heels with a cocktail at 5:15.''
   Snodgrass left his wife of 14 years and his two children to live
with another man. ``What you're left with are memories of your
children looking through the venetian blinds as you drive away,'' he
says.
   Michael Redman, the former prosecutor from Olympia, Wash., who
now works as a lobbyist, tells of resigning from his post when he
found himself plotting to kill a man who had escaped punishment for
burning down a friend's house. (The man was later convicted of the
crime.)
   Redman's forehead glistens with perspiration as he describes the
destruction of his marriage. One day, out of the blue, Redman says,
his wife told him she wanted a divorce. The reason she gave, he
says, is that she wanted children but could not have them with
Redman, who had had a vasectomy five years earlier when the couple
decided not to have a family.
   ``I'm crawling,'' Redman says, ``but I'm moving.''
   Geoffrey Noyes, the businessman from Oneida, N.Y., was fired from
his job at a company founded by his grandfather. At the time of the
filming, he was working to get a small computer company off the
ground.
   ``I wanted my children to be proud of me,'' Noyes says.
``Particularly after I left the company I was most worried about
that, that they'd think I was a failure.''
   Steve Sohmer, the movie producer, tells of being divorced twice
and being fired from his job as president of Columbia Pictures. He
also tells of anti-Semitic slurs he encountered at Yale.
   ``When I tell that story ... I say I reached over and punched the
guy in the nose, but I didn't ... I just sat there and absorbed
it,'' he says.
   ``I have tried to understand my life and do that in a rational
sense and push away the emotions,'' Sohmer says. ``But now I find
that what I really have to do is not understand my life but pick it
up in my arms and embrace it.''
   Knight, the banker, says he always thought he would have ``a
little house in the suburbs ... I would have very much a 9-to-5 sort
of job. (My wife) would be a typical housewife, raising children.''
But he and his wife have been unable to have children: he has a low
sperm count and she has endometriosis.
   When Keller decided to make a film for the class reunion, he
enlisted the help of Yale psychologist Daniel Levinson, who devised
a questionnaire asking members of the class to describe where they
were in their lives.
   More than 500 men responded, about 200 agreeing to talk on
camera. Five were chosen to appear in the film.
   Redman said in a telephone interview that the documentary was
``more than I thought I was getting into when I answered that
questionnaire. I did that because I needed the answers for myself.''
   Knight said he was somewhat apprehensive about the film's
national debut. The head of the only bank in a small farming
community, he is well-known to townspeople who, he said, will
certainly be tuning in.
   ``If I had my personal druthers, I would pack up and take an
extended trip to Alaska,'' he said.

<HEAD>Whether Housing Prices Will Wither</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the popular participant sports of economic
and financial researchers is terrorizing homeowners with tales about
a coming price collapse.
   Some reports arise out of Wall Street, which tends to think of
housing as a competitor of stocks and bonds for the investor's
dollar. Some originate in academe, some in the popular press and in
publishing houses.
   A few years ago a well publicized book forecast an imminent
collapse in housing prices. It didn't happen, at least to an extent
discernible in the usual statistics. But even after the dread time
had passed, the book sold.
   The reason is obvious: The biggest investment of most people is
the home in which they live. It is a roof over their head, a symbol
of participation in economic growth, a savings account, a treasure,
a pension. It is to be guarded.
   The latest assault on the senses of homeowners, ``The Baby Boom,
The Baby Bust, and the Housing Market,'' carries the imprimatur of
the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., highly
esteemed by economists.
   Authors Greg Mankiw and David Weil conclude that the real price
of housing, inflation excluded, could decline by 3 percent a year
over the next 20 years, for a total decline of as much as 47 percent
by the year 2007.
   They reason that demand will be falling off sharply, leaving a
relative oversupply, a reversal of the more customary situation in
which there is growing demand and sometimes insufficient supply.
   Why should demand fall?
   Because the baby boomers, born after World War II _ 4.3 million
babies were born at the peak in 1957 _ will be replaced by the baby
busters. At the trough of the baby bust in 1973 only 3.14 million
babies were born.
   First came the birth bulge, followed in the late 1970s by rising
housing sales. Now, say the authors, the birth bust will undermine
housing demand in the 1990s and into the next century. The
supply-demand ratio will be changed.
   Will it happen? Obviously, the authors believe so. In the housing
industry, however, it is being accepted as but another in a long
series of threats, most of which have never developed full profiles.
   A 47 percent decline in housing prices, points out critic Isaac
Megbolugbe, would produce what many would consider a dubious
possibility if not an absurdity, that is, a market of houses priced
below the cost of production.
   Megbolugbe, senior housing policy analyst for Housing Economics,
a National Association of Home Builders publication, wouldn't deny
that prices might fall for a time in some markets. But he and
colleagues foresee no plunge.
   Gopal Ahluwalia, research director for the publication, points
out that in some markets, as in Houston earlier in this decade,
housing prices can fall when the entire economy falters. It happened
in the Midwest too, in the ``rust belt'' days of the 1970s. But
housing prices there have largely recovered.
   Housing people like to say that housing prices are protected, to
some immeasurable extent, because land cannot be reproduced on a
large scale. In some communities, in fact, land is assessed higher
than the houses on it.
   There might be slow periods, says Ahluwalia. In fact, there have
always been slow periods in housing, followed and preceded by active
periods. Price increases of the magnitude that occurred in the past
15 years aren't likely, as the Home Builders see it, but they view a
collapse as far less likely.
   A home of your own, says Ahluwalia, is still the very best hedge
you can have against inflation.

<HEAD>Award-Winning Drill Team Helps Inner-City Members</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The children who swing their hips, bob
their heads and fling their knees and elbows up and out to throbbing
drumbeats have left crowds wide-eyed from Kansas City to the
nation's capital and beyond.
   The Marching Cobras, an award-winning drill team, also leave a
mark on the members, many of them from poor, inner-city homes with
one parent.
   ``For one, you get a chance to travel and do all sorts of things,
and another, it keeps you out of trouble,'' said Aaron Byrd, 15, a
Cobra for five years. ``I think I might be on the street and in
trouble if I wasn't in the group. ... There are no down sides to
being in the Cobras.''
   ``I've made a lot of friends in the Cobras,'' said A'yanna
Gilmore, 14, who has been in the drill team three years. ``And it
makes you learn independence, and responsibility for your uniform,
your performance and everything.''
   Willie Smith, drillmaster for 20 years, said it's virtually
impossible to understand what the Cobras are without seeing their
flashy uniforms and intricate routines, elbows and knees pumping 1{
times for every drumbeat.
   As much a part of Kansas City as its fountains, the Cobras
average 300 invitations a year and accept 100 to 200. They performed
117 times last year, including what Smith called a ``dream come
true,'' for President Reagan.
   ``He kind of pepped up when we started,'' Smith said. ``I really
wanted to go grab him and get him to dance, but the security men, we
couldn't go past this line, or that line. But he would have liked
it.''
   The Cobras made their first overseas trip in February, to Nice,
France, where they competed in the City of Carnivals Festival. They
won awards in three categories, including best international drill
team.
   ``We saw Monte Carlo, Cannes, stayed in the best hotels, ate the
best meals,'' Smith said. ``I'd never get to do that by myself. And
here are these kids going to a place they never even heard of.''
   For the members, being in the Cobras is ``their big chance,'' he
said. ``When we went to France, we found out that some of the kids
have never been to the airport, they've never been to the (Country
Club) Plaza,'' an affluent Kansas City restaurant and shopping area.
   The Cobras began in 1969 when Smith coached a group of
seventh-grade boys to dance in a talent show. That group evolved
into a drill team and eventually became the Kansas City Marching
Cobras _ so named after a school librarian watching from a
third-floor window said it looked like a snake.
   Whites aren't excluded but all the members, who range in age from
8 to 18, are black, Smith said. ``I don't think there's too many
whites who want to come to the inner city to practice.''
   Money problems nearly ended the Cobras in 1986, but the team
affiliated with the Boys and Girls Club in Kansas City, which eased
the money crunch, Smith said. ``Until we came to the boys and girls
clubs, we raised the money ourselves. Bake sales, car washes,
raffles.
   ``But in some ways we were happier when we were scuffing it. The
kids now are getting spoiled. They know they get the uniform, so
they don't take care of it like they did before. If the parents paid
$70 or $80 for it, it would be taken care of.''
   The glitzy uniforms cost $150-$175 each, so only 85 Cobras can be
in uniform at any time. The colors vary each year.
   Also each year, two Cobras are honored as the mascot and senior
imperial. The mascot wears a rubber cobra headpiece and leads the
group.
   ``The person who wears the cobra headpiece is the most
outstanding member,'' Smith said. ``They have to compete for it. An
11-year-old dreams of wearing the mascot head. It's prestigious and
it's an honor.''
   The Cobras are based at the Boys and Girls Club. The windowless
brown brick building squats in the inner city, clusters of children
lounging outside. Cars stop on the street, disgorging more children.
Practice is three times a week.
   Smith's office exhibits honors from past performances. Plaques,
trophies, photographs and letters cover the walls. A box of awards
sits in a corner.
   After 20 years, Smith is more than drillmaster, and many members
call him ``Dad.'' They knock on his door to tell him of problems or
ask advice. Being on the team keeps them off the street, which has
always been his goal.
   ``Children have changed. The kids aren't as interested in
extracurricular activities. We need to spend even more time with
them now than before, because they spend more time on the streets
now. And the streets are worse.''

<TEXT>
   The idea of merging the Caribbean's
smallest English-speaking islands into a single nation or federation
has been around for half a century with little ever coming of it.
   But now that a major trading partner, Western Europe, is moving
toward economic integration, the fervor of unity advocates has
increased.
   Prime Minister James Mitchell of St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
a leader of the most promising attempt at political union since the
West Indies Federation collapsed nearly 30 years ago, maintains the
eastern Caribbean faces economic disaster if it doesn't unite by the
time the 12 nations of the European Economic Community form a single
market by the end of 1992.
   Mostly at stake are Caribbean bananas.
   Mitchell, attending a recent regional meeting on Grenada, said
that without political unity, individual islands won't have the
political power to protect their banana sales in England after the
European trade barriers fall.
   ``Who will respect you when you go to Europe representing a
ministate? How much time will they have for you?'' Mitchell said in
a recent interview. ``We don't need unity to survive. We need it to
get our voice heard in the international community.''
   ``I'm bone-tired of trying to convince people,'' he added. ``I
think we've lost the momentum in spite of how urgently it's needed.''
   Vaughn Lewis, secretary-general of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States, said, ``If you go to Europe and say you represent
a chain of islands, the impact is greater than if you say you
represent one.
   The Caribbean benefits today from preferential trade access for
its agricultural products into the EEC.
   Under current agreements, Caribbean bananas are protected in
Britain, which does not import bananas from other regions. Caribbean
bananas grow on small farms and are more expensive than those
mass-produced in Central and South America.
   With the dismantling of EEC trade barriers, Caribbean bananas
will have to compete in an open market. British consumers then could
be expected to buy the cheaper Central and South American bananas
and the Caribbean's $175 million annual market would collapse.
   The West Indies Federation was founded in 1958 as the first
attempt at political integration but disintegrated four years later
when Jamaica withdrew.
   Mitchell, supported by Prime Minister John Compton of St. Lucia,
renewed the unity drive at the 1987 summit meeting of the
Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, a regional sub-grouping
within the Caribbean Community and Common Market.
   The idea of creating a single country or a regional federation of
states by mid-1989 out of the eastern Caribbean islands of Antigua,
St. Kitts-Nevis, Montserrat, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St.
Vincent was approved in principle.
   But Antigua withdrew almost immediately and was followed later by
Montserrat and St. Kitts-Nevis.
   Mitchell and Compton still favor political union of the remaining
four, known as the Windward Islands.
   The eastern Caribbean islands share a central bank, common
currency and high court.
   All are small and relatively undeveloped with a combined
English-speaking population of 400,000. In land mass, the largest is
Dominica with 289 square miles and the smallest is Montserrat, the
only remaining British colony of the group, with just 39 square
miles.
   Geographically, they resemble a 450-mile kite tail stretching
from Puerto Rico in the north to Trinidad in the south. Their
populations range from 12,000 in Montserrat to 119,000 in St. Lucia.
   Detractors say a political marriage is unrealistic; each island
is as unique as any nation, regardless of size. They say economic
integration, not political, is what is needed.
   ``We go to the United Nations and the World Bank and fight
tooth-and-nail to portray small island states as having special
characteristics and requiring special treatment. We cannot ignore
this reality in our forums,'' Prime Minister Kenneth Simmonds of St.
Kitts-Nevis said in an interview.
   ``We already go to Europe as a team speaking for the region,'' he
said. ``The EEC is not a national front, it's a regional front. The
process should be the same for us.''
   The Windwards export 220,000 tons of bananas a year to Britain,
accounting for two-thirds of the bananas consumed in England.
   The four islands plan to hold a political union referendum after
parliamentary elections, still unscheduled, are held in Grenada and
Dominica.
   The Caribbean Community, an organization of 13 English-speaking
states that includes the Windwards and Leewards, already has taken
steps to form a common market.
   ``At present there is little immediate prospect for political
unity,'' Prime Minister Herbert Blaize of Grenada said in welcoming
heads of government to a recent meeting here. ``But we continue to
knock at the door for closer cooperation and cry fervently for
economic integration.''
   Caribbean leaders say economic unity is imperative if they are to
survive the trading blocs being formed around the world, including
the recent U.S. and Canada trade agreement.
   Prime Minister Michael Manley of Jamaica has called it ``the only
way a group of small countries can survive.''

pretty much what it was when it was closed to foreigners. An AP
correspondent visited the city recently as part of a tour conducted
by the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Here are a few leaves from his
notebook.

   The hills of the long-forbidden
Pacific port drop into the ocean, and as an evening fog settles
across the water, a white, 30-foot fiberglass sloop drifts along the
shore in a light breeze.
   The sailboat flies no colors, and for a moment, the scene could
be any port city anywhere. But on closer inspection, the boat yields
a clue. A woman, standing in the cockpit, wears a shin-length cotton
dress instead of shorts, slacks or a swimsuit.
   The woman might look out of place aboard a boat in a Western
harbor, but yachting clothes are practically unknown in the Soviet
Far East.
   The port is Vladivostok, the headquarters of the Soviet Pacific
Fleet on the Sea of Japan. Although ostensibly opened to foreigners
last year, the security-conscious city permits few tourists and has
not yet adapted to its new status.

<TEXT>
   A packet of picture postcards contains several views of the city,
including some aerial views, but there is no sign of the Soviet
fleet, the pride of Vladivostok. The docks at the city's center are
crowded with destroyers, cruisers, anti-submarine ships of various
descriptions and an aircraft carrier under repair. Just around a
point from the downtown wharves, rows of nuclear-powered subs are
tied up in submarine pens.
   While much is made of the navy's multiethnic makeup, Vladivostok
looks as Russian as Moscow. In a city of more than 600,000 in the
Soviet Far East, the appearance of people on the street testifies to
their European ancestry, and there are few signs of the Asian
nationalities whose homelands are geographically much closer.

<TEXT>
   Having been closed to tourism for so long, Vladivostok has no
Intourist hotel, where foreigners are charged extraordinary rates
for rooms that would be rented to Soviets for a fraction of the
price. As a result, when a group arrived from Moscow recently under
the sponsorship of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, those who paid upon
arrival were charged $18.75 to $23.50 for a three-night stay.
   When word spread that the guests were foreigners and should be
charged the rate set by Intourist, the state tourism monopoly, those
who had yet to pay were charged 10 times what the others had paid.

   Most of the city's architecture is of the same, monotonous
concrete-slab construction that characterizes other Soviet cities,
but several pre-revolutionary buildings remain around the central
square. One is a former Japanese Consulate, built before the
Russo-Japanese War at the turn of the century. It is now occupied by
state offices.
   A building once famed for its French restaurant is being
renovated and may one day serve fastidious diners again.
   A few blocks away is one of the few visible signs that President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms reach as far as Vladivostok.
Chinese craftsmen are building a Chinese-Soviet joint-venture
restaurant.
   A Soviet bystander professes amazement at the workers' attention
to detail as they fit perfectly symmetrical logs to frame a
traditional, multistep pagoda-style roof over the entrance to the
otherwise ordinary concrete block building.

   Expansionist Russia sent soldiers and pioneers to tame its Far
Eastern regions about the same time the American West was being
settled. Vladivostok was founded in 1856, Khabarovsk on the Amur
River two years later, Blagoveshchensk on the Chinese border also in
1858.
   In 1891, workers began building the Vladivostok railway station,
which was to be the eastern terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railroad.
   ``The design was copied from the Yaroslavl station'' in Moscow, a
guide explains. ``It symbolizes the unity of Russia because people
started out from Yaroslavl Station to get here.''
   Even today, that is a seven-day journey.

   The quicker route is by plane, about nine hours from Moscow, but
there are few direct flights to Vladivostok. The airport is no
longer off limits but remains uninviting to civilian travelers.
   Squadrons of long-range reconnaissance Bears and Badger
medium-range bombers, their sleek snouts cloaked in canvas or draped
in camouflage netting, are tucked into earthen revetments beside the
runway, the red stars on their tails giving mute testimony to the
primary function of the military airfield.

<HEAD>Reserve Troops in Far East Assail Sakharov for Afghanistan Charge</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Vladivostok Notes, b0294</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHABAROVSK, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of miles from Moscow, the
name Andrei Sakharov kindles fire in the hearts of young men still
smarting from the wounds of the Soviet adventure in Afghanistan.
   In a riverside square in this century-old Siberian city, a
platoon of Afghanistan veterans staged a bit of street theater one
evening recently to demonstrate their reserve group's combat
training, play some popular songs _ and take a swipe at the Nobel
Peace laureate regarded as the founder of the Soviet human rights
movement.
   Between numbers played by a military band in fatigue uniforms, an
announcer told the few hundred people in the audience, ``We all
remember how academician Sakharov insulted us at the Congress of
People's Deputies.''
   Sakharov was heckled during the parliamentary session in June and
lambasted by a parade of speakers who accused him of blaspheming the
military in an interview in Canada earlier in the year in which he
was quoted as saying Soviet pilots killed soldiers they could not
save from being captured by Afghan rebels.
   The 68-year-old physicist and now a Congress deputy endured
almost seven years in exile in the closed city of Gorky for his
outspoken opposition to the Soviet military intervention that began
in December 1979. He told the Congress he would not retract his
charge, pending the outcome of an investigation by Soviet
authorities.
   The emotional, nationally broadcast attack on Sakharov
reverberated weeks later in this Far Eastern city built on the banks
of the great Amur River to protect against Chinese invasion 4,400
miles from Moscow.
   The reservists loaded their assault rifles and machine guns with
blanks and climbed atop an armored personnel carrier that bore a red
banner proclaiming, ``Afghanistan _ in my heart forever.''
   With police motioning the crowd to make way, a squad of troops
ambled up the street and was gunned down by mock Mujahadeen rebels
lying in ambush by the side of the road.
   Guns blazing, the armored personnel carrier sped to the rescue,
and the ``wounded'' Red Army soldiers were hastily loaded into an
ambulance truck that escaped in a hail of fire, its driver nearly
grazing the crowd in a hair-raising demonstration of evasive driving
tactics.
   The chatter of machine guns and ear-splitting roar of artillery
rocked the night as first the truck was halted by fire, then the
personnel carrier was captured by rebels and recaptured by the
Soviets.
   The Red Army men risked their lives over and over until they
finally succeeded in hauling their wounded to safety.
   The last Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan on Feb. 15 after
more than nine years of fighting, but as the street drama in
Khabarovsk illustrated, the withdrawal was no instant cure for what
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev once called his nation's ``bleeding
wound.''

<HEAD>BAT Chairman Faces Takeover Threat for a Change</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Patrick Sheehy has spent his entire professional
life with BAT Industries PLC, and as chairman of the tobacco giant
he's led a $7.2 billion takeover spree into businesses ranging from
insurance to department stores.
   Now the 58-year-old chairman is finding out what it's like on the
receiving end of a bid: an unsolicited $21 billion, debt-financed
takeover offer from a trio led by swashbuckling investor Sir James
Goldsmith.
   ``I suppose it's definitely ironic,'' Sheehy said. ``My reaction
to the bid was one of surprise, initially, not that we thought that
we were invulnerable. But I mean I certainly thought that this type
of raid was unlikely.''
   The Goldsmith offer, financed largely with borrowed money, would
be the second biggest ever if successful, after the record $25
billion RJR Nabisco Inc. takeover by the New York investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   In an interview, Sheehy described Goldsmith and partners as
avaricious financiers, whose plan to break up BAT and sell pieces to
help pay for a takeover is ``just naked asset stripping.''
   In contrast, Sheehy said, BAT's acquisitions of other companies
have been friendly, with the notable exception of a $5.2 billion
takeover of Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles earlier this
year. Even in that case, Sheehy said, the takeover was a strategic,
long-term investment.
   Sheehy is a large man with graying hair, blue eyes and florid
face, who began working for BAT nearly 40 years ago when it was
still known as British American Tobacco Co. He became chairman in
1982.
   The BAT battle may boil down to a struggle between Goldsmith,
renowned for profitable forays for other companies, and Sheehy, a
modest but intensely determined one-company man who knows how a
takeover strategist thinks.
   Sheehy's defense so far has been to raise the alarms, and to hope
that the takeover bid will get stuck in a regulatory quagmire.
   BAT will ask Britain's Office of Fair Trading to refer the matter
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to decide whether the bid
violates the public interest, Sheehy said.
   ``We are certainly using our political friends to try and bring
pressure to bear,'' he said.
   Sheehy also predicted the governments of other countries where
BAT operates will raise concern about Goldsmith's bid, particularly
in the United States, where regulatory authorities will want
detailed plans on how a takeover would affect Farmers, one of the
nation's biggest insurers.
   Goldsmith and his two partners, British banker Jacob Rothschild
and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer, have attacked Sheehy's
strategy of diversifying into financial services and retailing.
   The trio's newly formed firm, Hoylake Investments PLC, which
announced the takeover offer July 11, said it intends to sell
everything except BAT's tobacco business.
   ``We are clearly fighting it on our record,'' Sheehy said. ``Our
record, quite contrary to what Hoylake claims, has been, we think,
outstanding.''
   Since Sheehy took BAT's helm, earnings per share have grown 18.5
percent per year, compared with a British company average of 11.5
percent, he said.
   Put another way, the chairman said, $160 invested in the company
in April 1981 today are worth $1,829.
   BAT's earnings rose 21 percent to $1.5 billion last year on a 3
percent revenue gain to $28 billion.
   The company owns a range of well-known products and services,
including Benson and Hedges, Kent and Kool cigarettes; Saks Fifth
Avenue, Marshall Field's and Argos stores; Eagle Star insurance
products; Allied Dunbar financial services; and Appleton and Wiggins
Teape paper.
   Sheehy, son of a colonial civil servant, was born in Burma in
1930. He was sent to school in Australia during World War II,
attended Ampleforth College, a boys boarding school in Yorkshire, in
northeast England, and then served in the Irish Guards, rising to
second lieutenant.
   Skipping a university education, Sheehy joined British American
Tobacco in 1950 at age 20 as a management trainee. He was posted to
Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia and finally to the West Indies, where he
was general manager. In 1962, he returned to BAT's London
headquarters as a marketing adviser, but five years later he was off
again, this time as general manager in the Netherlands.
   Some postings were better than others.
   ``I had three and a half years in Ethiopia. It was a time I often
was wondering whether I was going to spend all my life there and
didn't want to,'' he said.
   Living half his life abroad ``made me fairly adaptable, fairly
resilient, fairly self-reliant, with a wide range of interests,''
Sheehy said.
   Although he has never worked for any company except BAT, he said,
``I'd like to think I haven't had one career but I've had several
careers, in different countries, in different businesses.''
   Sheehy rose through BAT's management hierarchy quickly, joining
the board of directors at age 39. His salary as chairman is low by
U.S. standards, at about $720,000 a year.
   Asked to describe his style, Sheehy said: ``I like to think that
I listen to other people and then take a decision and try and get
involved in ensuring that it's implemented, not by telling people
exactly what to do, but by encouraging them and guiding them.''
   What does he think his 310,000 employee worldwide say about him?
   ``Probably things unprintable,'' Sheehy said. ``I used to say
that about my bosses.''
   Married and the father of two, Sheehy lives in west London, owns
an English country home, and admits an addiction to golf. His
handicap is somewhere between 10 and 20, he says, adding, ``depends
who I'm playing.''
   In this latest boardroom game, Sheehy has a lot at stake
personally, although he insists he isn't acting to protect his own
job.
   ``I haven't actually got much more than a couple of years before
I retire so its not as devastating a thing as if I was 40 or
something like that,'' he said. ``I can say goodbye.''

<HEAD>Gambling on the Future of the Black-Footed Ferret</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SYBILLE CANYON, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tucked beneath the ridge of
rattlesnake-infested Sybille Canyon, a barbed-wire fence and burglar
alarms guard a growing colony of black-footed ferrets, once viewed
as the rarest mammal on Earth.
   Low-light TV cameras feed the ferrets' nocturnal frolicking and
mating to 14 monitors and video recorders. Nearby, an enclosed
prairie dog town is ready for the day humans teach the ferrets how
to kill their natural prey.
   If all goes well, the weasel-like animals will be returned to the
wild in 1991, starting with recolonization of the prairie dog
community near Meeteetse where ferrets were found in 1981 after
having been thought extinct.
   Success would be the payoff to a gamble begun by the Wyoming Game
and Fish Department in 1985 despite the failure of other breeding
programs. Thirty-four births last year let state veterinarians Tom
Thorne and Don Kwiatkowski set up colonies in Virginia and Wyoming;
more than 60 kits have been born this year.
   ``Counting the animals from this year, there's 100 in the
world,'' said Kwiatkowski. ``Any other species, people would still
be highly concerned over their survival. But most people figure
they're on their way to recovery and that's it. No big thing
anymore. But there can be a setback at any time.''
   ``We're still pretty precarious, tenuous, whatever you want to
say,'' said Thorne. The other colonies are ``life insurance, if you
want to call it.''
   The ferrets didn't always need such insurance. They once roamed
the West from southern Canada to Mexico, inhabiting colonies of
tunneling prairie dogs. As ranchers poisoned the prairies to kill
predators, prairie dog populations fluctuated and the ferrets became
more susceptible to disease.
   In 1982, just 61 ferrets were thought to be in the Meeteetse
colony in north-central Wyoming. The population hit 129 by 1984, but
tailed off to less than two dozen in 1985 when the decision to breed
the animals was made.
   The breeding program started dismally. Six ferrets brought in
from Meeteetse the first year died of canine distemper, prompting a
1986 decision to capture the colony's remaining 18 ferrets. Those
included Scarface and Becky, a father and daughter, who in June 1987
gave their species a fighting chance with a litter of six kits here.
Their offspring and those of other ``founders'' are dominant as
Thorne and Kwiatkowski try to diversify the gene pool.
   ``We have what we think were eight founder animals, because they
were brought in from geographically different areas, and they were
observed in the wild before being caught so we know they aren't at
least full sibs, and some of them ... haven't been related for a
couple generations,'' said Kwiatkowski.
   ``We follow a genetic plan each season for breeding, which makes
it a little more difficult. You can't just put the female in heat
with the best male you have.'' So far, the 1989 pairings have been
between unrelated ferrets.
   ``Last year was just about the same. Only the first year we had a
father and daughter breeding, because those were the only animals
that would mate,'' he said. ``We should end up with an animal for
release that's much more diverse than was ever in the population''
at Meeteetse.
   The work is conducted in relative seclusion at the complex here.
The innocuous green building sits behind barbed wire and has a
sophisticated alarm system prompted by a $10,000 reward offered by
the New York Zoological Society for information leading to the
discovery of a wild ferret colony. ``That's enough stimulus for some
folks to try something,'' said Kwiatkowski.
   Access to the building is limited to assigned personnel and
visitors approved by Thorne. Only the veterinarians and assistants
are allowed into the ferrets' area, and then only after a
disinfectant shower. Fear of disaster has produced an evacuation
system enabling one biologist to remove all ferrets from the
8,000-square-foot building within 10 minutes.
   Nearby, an enclosed prairie dog community built by humans stands
ready for use in teaching the captive ferrets how to kill their
natural prey.
   To keep the ferrets healthy and prepare them for release the vets
feed them hamsters, prairie dogs, and commercial mink feed. As the
kits mature their menu changes from a gruel-like mixture to chunks
of hamsters, live hamsters and live prairie dogs. The vets raise
their own hamsters and isolate captured prairie dogs before feeding
them to the ferrets to ensure a disease-free meal.
   While Thorne and Kwiatkowski work on recovering the species, the
department's non-game coordinator, Bob Oakleaf, concentrates on
finding areas to reintroduce ferrets and following up leads to any
wild colonies.
   This fall, officials will review other sites in Wyoming and other
states where the ferrets once roamed. What is required are tracts of
at least 6,000 acres, a requirement that could make finding new
homes difficult because of the pressures already existing on public
lands, Oakleaf acknowledged.
   Those returned to the wilds will be somewhat protected from
canine distempter, the deadly disease common in domestic and wild
animals. University of Wyoming veterinary researchers have developed
a vaccine specially suited to ferrets that is good for three or four
months and not only kills the virus but stimulates the ferrets'
immune systems. Work is under way on a vaccine that would protect
them for a year or more. After that, they're on their own.
   ``Nobody is talking about any continuous catch-and-release
vaccination of these wild animals to protect them. Once you get
populations in the wild you'll be able to let the disease run its
course,'' Kwiatkowski said.
   As for the possibility of other wild colonies, Oakleaf is not
optimistic.
   ``There's always the potential that there's a population
somewhere that we missed,'' he said. ``But if you look at what
history tells us ... it's pretty evident that ferrets have been
declining for a long time.
   ``Sure, there could be one or two populations out there that we
haven't found. But if we don't find them fairly quickly ... you can
count on them going extinct.''

<HEAD>A Water Buffalo In Every Pot? Low-Cholesterol Breed Gains Popularity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEXARKANA, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High in exotic appeal and low in
cholesterol, the water buffalo is hitting health-food shelves and
haute-cuisine menus.
   To father-and-son ranchers Oley and Tom Olson, the smelly,
unsightly, ox-like animals are gentle giants with the potential to
alleviate world hunger.
   To Mitch Niayesh, vice president Polarica Game U.S.A., Bubalus
bubalis is pleasure for pampered palates _ at up to $17 a pound.
   ``I always have a freezer full of it,'' said Hugh Popenoe,
director of the University of Florida Center for Tropical
Agriculture. Popenoe, who is studying expansion of the breed, also
has acquired a taste for rich mozzarella made from water buffalo
milk. ``And the people who've eaten the hamburger say it's much
better than beef burgers, because they don't shrink,'' he said.
   ``A lot of people say the hamburgers are outstanding.''
   There are hurdles, however, to water buffalo reaching an
important place in the American diet. First, there's the small
supply _ there are only about 3,000 of the homely critters in the
United States. And regulations make it costly and time-consuming to
import animals from Asia, Australia and other sources.
   Nonetheless, Polarica, a San Francisco gourmet food wholesaler,
managed to sell about 20,000 pounds last year, Niayesh said. When
domestic sources ran short, he brought the dark-colored, lightly
marbled goods from Australia.
   His customers ranged from golf and country clubs to swank
restaurants and hotels; he sent 30 pounds to a Los Angeles bash
honoring the king of Sweden.
   ``These are middle- to higher-income people. First, they wanted
to have something different. Then they realized it's a good meat.
Now they're using it where they used to use beef,'' he said. He now
sells about 400 pounds a week of water buffalo tenderloin, the most
preferred cut.
   The `21' Club in New York has served water buffalo on special
occasions for regular customers, although it isn't a regular
offering, said Don Krindler, senior vice president of the posh
restaurant.
   ``As people become aware that they have got to watch their
cholesterol, they are going to turn to an alternative,'' he said.
``If it can be marketed or prepared right, who knows?
   ``Maybe we'll have water buffalo burgers _ grilled, as opposed to
fried.''
   During blind taste tests, Popenoe said, ``It comes out tasting
about the same as beef, or people can't tell the difference.''
   The Olsons, who tend 19, say there are many differences between
buffalo on the hoof and the Herefords on their ranch near the
Arkansas-Texas border.
   ``The water buffalo have 50 percent less cholesterol, 25 percent
less fat, but, we think, a lot more intellect,'' said Oley, 67, who
retired to the ranch from a Chicago lumber business.
   Tom, 30, said it's easy to think of the water buffaloes as pets,
since the family has concentrated on breeding to build the herd, and
not slaughtering.
   ``They'd come right in the house and watch TV. They are dirty and
scruffy, but so gentle, docile. They're just a fabulous animal,''
said Oley.
   ``They seem to grow about twice as fast as our cattle,'' said Tom.
   They also cost about twice as much _ $1,500 for a water buffalo
bull vs. about $700 for a Hereford bull. A pregnant water buffalo
brings about $3,500.
   Offsetting the purchase price, the Olsons say, is low maintenance.
   ``They've never been sick because they're so sturdy, and they eat
about anything _ leaves, weeds, any kind of grass, whatever,'' but
``it's just a drain right now. We aren't making anything from
them,'' he said.
   ``It could be a big money-maker some day,'' Popenoe said. ``There
is a sizable population that would be interested in meat with lower
cholesterol. The largest-growing segment of the U.S. food market is
exotic and ethnic, and this would fit nicely.''

<HEAD>Officials Link Crack Cocaine to Sharp Increase in Rural Syphilis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who trade sex for a brief high on crack
are being blamed for a 69.7 percent increase in syphilis in rural
Georgia.
   ``The geographics of this increase are very significant,'' said
Jane Carr, director of the state Office of Infectious Disease.
``We're seeing syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases
where we've never seen them before.
   ``They used to be reported only in the larger metro areas. Now
it's the rural areas that are reporting the majority of the
increase.''
   Georgia reported 2,614 cases of syphilis in 1986, 2,656 in 1987
and 4,436 last year. The increase has been 125 percent for black
women and 53 percent for black men, compared with a 37 percent
increase for white women and a 7 percent decline among white men.
Officials attribute the decrease to AIDS education.
   In the Albany health district, syphilis cases have more than
doubled, from 232 in 1987, when crack cocaine arrived, to almost 500
this year.
   Ray Shierling, one of six state epidemiologists who interview
syphilis victims in 14 southwestern counties, said there are
``little girls out on the street every night having sex numerous
times just for cocaine.''
   ``A lot of times girls don't have money, so they use the next
best thing. They trade their bodies for drugs,'' said Lt. Ben
Morris, head of the Moultrie-Colquitt County Drug Squad.
   Shierling, who interviews infected people and tries to contact
their sex partners, said that where three to four contacts in six
months once was normal, investigators now are lucky to get two names
because clients have had too many to remember or are reluctant to
discuss matters that involve illegal drugs.
   ``We have very little success in interviewing the street girls,''
he said.
   Women, ranging from their teens to their 30s, may have sex with
five or six men to buy one $20 ``rock'' of crack, said an
Albany-Dougherty County Drug Unit investigator who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``It's one of the highest highs that most of
these junkies have ever had. But it's over very quickly. Then they
immediately need more, so it's a vicious cycle.''
   Ted Holloway, health director for the Waycross district, said his
16 counties had 50 to 60 cases of syphilis a year through 1984. But
in 1987, 201 cases were reported and last year there were 255.
   Officials agree that increased use of cocaine seems to be a major
factor, and the Department of Human Resources' Division of Public
Health has begun a three-month study in the Waycross, Valdosta,
Brunswick and Atlanta areas to substantiate the link between
syphilis and drugs.
   People who test positive for syphilis also will be tested
anonymously for the AIDS virus and for drug use. Blood samples will
be sent to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's crime lab for
testing.
   ``There's a definite system to it,'' Holloway said. ``Whether in
Waycross or Atlanta, drug dealers settle in low-income housing
projects where they get young females hooked on crack or coke.
   ``To support their habits, these women may sell or trade sex with
as many as 20 partners a day, without ever knowing who they are.
When they can't remember the names of these sexual contacts,
epidemiologists can't find the contacts so they go untreated and,
more likely than not, infect someone else.''
   Untreated sexually transmitted diseases increase the risk of
infection with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, which
can enter the body through breaks in the skin, such as the chancres
that can form on the penis, vagina, tongue and lips of those
infected with syphilis.
   ``The current emphasis on AIDS testing and education has created
a drain on staff and funds,'' Ms. Carr said. ``Yet it is extremely
important that we do so because syphilis is known to increase the
risk of contracting the AIDS virus threefold.''

<HEAD>More May Suffer From Sting Allergies Than Thought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRIS CHANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five to 10 times more people may be allergic to
insect stings than previously thought, according to a new study.
   ``It's amazing how many people have suffered from this and never
told their doctors about it,'' said David Golden of Johns Hopkins
University, one of the researchers who tested 269 people and studied
their medical histories.
   Past studies showed that only about one in 200 people have a
history of dangerous or fatal allergic reactions to stings, but the
new study showed the figure is closer to three or four in 100, said
Lawrence Lichtenstein, who led the research published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association.
   At least 50 Americans a year die from severe allergic reactions
to insect stings, and their death is the first sign of their
allergy, he said.
   Typically, people stung by bees, wasps or ants will have a local
reaction, a small swelling. A more severe case would be a large
local reaction, swelling a patch of skin. But a ``systemic''
allergic reaction affects the entire body. It can mean either
swelling all over the body, shortness of breath, or a drop in blood
pressure, or all three, and can result in serious illness or death.
   In the study, 269 factory workers were given skin tests with bee
and yellow jacket venom, and filled out questionnaires on their
allergic histories.
   Fifteen percent of those who reported no history of allergic
reactions reacted positively to the skin test. ``That is of special
interest since most fatal sting reactions occur in individuals who
had never experienced an allergic sting reaction,'' the researchers
wrote.
   The researchers also took blood to check for allergy-causing
antibodies. More than 26 percent of the workers showed the potential
to develop a systemic allergy. Each of those 70 had a 20 percent
chance of developing a dangerous or fatal systemic reaction to an
insect bit, Lichtenstein said.
   He urged people who have had severe reactions to enter venom
immunotherapy, in which small doses of venom are injected into the
bloodstream to build up the patient's immunity. The treatment is
almost 100 percent effective, Golden said.
   Nine out of 10 patients who suffer from systemic reactions do not
realize they are in life-threatening danger, he said. ``They get up
from a serious reaction and think its a fluke and that it will never
happen again.''

   Consumer prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in
June, the smallest advance since early last year, the government
said in a report that bolstered the view that inflationary pressures
are beginning to ease.
   The slowdown reported Wednesday in the Consumer Price Index
reflected the fact that energy and food costs, which had been
shooting upward this year, finally moderated last month.
   Stock prices responded to the upbeat news with a strong rally
that carried the market to new highs since the crash of October
1987. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 39.65 points to
2,584.41.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson Agrees to Sell Lechmere</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dayton Hudson Corp. says it has agreed to sell
its Lechmere Inc. retail chain for an undisclosed price to an
investment group, two mall developers and members of Lechmere's
management.
   Terms of the definitive agreement with the Boston-based Berkshire
Partners investment group were not disclosed. The transaction,
announced Wednesday, is expected to be completed by the end of
September, Dayton Hudson said.
   Under the agreement, Dayton Hudson plans to sell Lechmere to
Berkshire Partners, regional mall developers Stephen R. Karp and
Stephen R. Weiner of Boston and members of Lechmere's management.
   Dayton Hudson President Bruce G. Allbright said the
Minneapolis-based retailer is pleased with the agreement.
   ``Lechmere is growing and profitable and we are pleased that the
company will continue to serve its customers,'' Allbright said.
   Allbright said the investment group has advised Dayton Hudson
that it intends to operate the business of Lechmere in substantially
the same manner as in the past, including retaining the Lechmere
name.
   Allbright credited the management team at Lechmere with running a
solidly profitable operation.
   ``Lechmere is a fine company. However, Dayton Hudson has decided
to dedicate its resources to the expansion of our principal growth
companies,'' he said.
   In the past two years, Dayton Hudson has acquired 80 stores which
are now Target discount stores and has opened another 46 Target
stores and 38 Mervyn's stores. Since 1986, the corporation has
increased its total number of stores by 54 percent.
   When Dayton Hudson acquired Lechmere in 1969, there were two
Lechmere stores, in Cambridge and Dedham, Mass. Today, Lechmere is a
hardlines retail company operating 27 stores in nine states.
   Lechmere stores offer products in consumer electronics, major
appliances, home-office, housewares and leisure-time equipment. The
company employs about 5,000.
   Lechmere's 1988 revenue totaled $769 million, or 6 percent of
Dayton Hudson's total. Operating profit in 1988 was $22 million, 3
percent of Dayton Hudson's total.
   Dayton Hudson has about 135,000 employees and operates 660 stores
in 38 states.

<HEAD>World Bank Makes Billion-Dollar Profit; Cuts Loan Fee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank says it met its goal of a
billion-dollar profit in its latest fiscal year, allowing it to cut
a loan fee and resume a suspended aid program for the world's
poorest countries.
   A top bank official also repeated Wednesday that Mexico is first
in line for a new World Bank debt-reduction program, followed by
Venezuela, Costa Rica and the Philippines.
   Debt reduction for those nations depends on their reaching
agreements with commercial bank creditors, said Ernest Stern, the
World Bank's senior vice president for finance.
   ``That's more or less a complete list. That doesn't mean others
will not follow in the next six months,'' he said at a New York
press conference.
   Borrowers will save about $200 million a year under a cut
announced Wednesday in the World Bank's commitment fee, which is
charged to borrowers on the portion of authorized loans they have
not yet received, Stern said.
   The bank will resume contributing $100 million of its profit to a
program that makes ``soft'' loans to the very poorest countries,
which are generally not able to make interest payments, spokesman
Sheldon Rappaport said.
   In a switch, this year's contribution will go for debt reduction,
the bank said. The annual contribution was suspended last year when
the World Bank needed to devote its profit to building up the
reserves backing its loans.
   Loans to the poorest countries through the bank's International
Development Association are stretched out over 40 years and carry an
interest rate of less than 1 percent. Most of the IDA's roughly $5
billion in annual lending comes from government contributions.
   The Washington-based World Bank said its profit in the fiscal
year ended June 30 totaled $1.094 billion, up from $1.004 billion a
year earlier.
   The World Bank has made a profit of $1 billion a year each of the
last five years. It plows the money back into further lending. The
organization was founded in 1945 to make loans to developing
countries and has 151 member countries.
   After several years of being low on reserves, the bank built its
reserve-to-loan ratio to 10.2 percent last year, within its target
range of 10 percent to 11 percent.
   The bank revealed Wednesday that its board had adopted a
financial management system in February that will reduce the risk
from wide swings in currency exchange rates.
   By the end of June 1990, borrowers will be required to make loan
payments with a fixed combination of currencies, about evenly split
between dollars, Japanese yen and West German marks. The fixed ratio
will make it easier for borrowers to plan their repayments, the bank
said.
   Stern said the bank will try to match the mix of currencies in
its loan portfolio with the mix of currencies in its reserves. In
the last few years the dollar's decline shrank the size of its
reserves in comparison to its loans, which were heavy in other
currencies.
   In its annual income statement, the bank said its return on
assets came to 1.09 percent, up from 0.98 percent the year before.
   The bank said it borrowed $9.3 billion in 17 currencies last
year, at an average cost of 7.73 percent and an average life of 7.8
years.
   Although government-supported, the World Bank gets about 90
percent of its funding for loans from private investors.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. has announced a portable
personal computer about the size of a 1-inch stack of paper and
weighing under 6 pounds.
   Zenith's Minisport, unveiled Wednesday, is the first computer to
use a 2-inch-wide diskette, the smallest yet, for storing data. Most
computers still use 5\-inch diskettes, although the 3{-inch format
is increasingly popular.
   Packaged software is not available on the Japanese-made 2-inch
diskettes, but users will be able to load programs into the portable
by hooking it up to another computer or a device that handles bigger
diskettes.
   Zenith spokesman Matthew Mirapaul said the Glenview, Ill.-based
company is not counting on the tiny diskettes to become a new
industry standard, although that may happen because they hold as
much information in less space.
   Portable computers are getting steadily smaller. Zenith's is
heavier than NEC Corp.'s 4.4-pound Ultralite, which was announced
last year, but it is also cheaper, starting at $1,999 vs. $2,999 for
the Ultralite.
   Zenith claims a battery life of more than three hours for the
Minisport, compared to about two hours for the the Ultralite. NEC's
machine has an internal modem, a device that permits communication
over phone lines, something that the Minisport lacks.

   Scientists say they have created the world's
smallest lasers and packed 2 million of them onto a chip the size of
a fingernail.
   The work was done by researchers at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and
Bellcore and announced Tuesday at a conference in Kobe, Japan.
   The lasers could eventually be used for sending signals between
computer chips, researchers said. They take up just 1 percent of the
space taken by conventional semiconductor lasers and draw less
power. Light comes out of them from the top instead of the side, as
with most lasers.
   About half the lasers on the experimental chip actually function.
Researchers said it would be several years before devices using such
small lasers go on sale.
   Bell Labs and Bellcore said they have applied for a joint patent
on the process for making the lasers, which is similar to the
process for making standard computer chips.
   Bellcore does research for the seven regional telephone holding
companies that were split off from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. in 1984. It used to be part of Bell Labs.

   Lawmakers intent on debating the federal

Prize-winning economist James Tobin told a congressional panel.
   Tobin joined 326 other economists Wednesday in signing a
statement saying that failure to increase investment in such things
as education, public health, transportation and technology ``will
have a crippling effect on America's future competitiveness.''
   The increased investment must be paid for through cuts in
military and agriculture subsidy spending, as well as with revenue
from new taxes, according to the statement written by the Economic
Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.
   Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder, also testifying
before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, said the
government's ``unending obession'' with the deficit will adversely
affect future productivity and standards of living.
   Blinder said the government must invest more in such things as
programs to aid disadvantaged children and to improve roads, bridges
and sewer facilities.

<HEAD>Senators Propose Additional Help for Disabled Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of senators has introduced
legislation to allow disabled Americans receiving Social Security
disability benefits to return to the workforce without losing their
medical coverage.
   Chief sponsor Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said Wednesday that
many recipients of Social Security Disability Insurance currently
avoid returning to work because they lose their benefits, including
Medicare coverage, if they earn more than $300 a month after a trial
work period.
   Under the legislation, disabled people who returned to work would
remain eligible for Medicare, and some would pay for the coverage on
a sliding fee scale linked to their earnings. Currently, Medicare is
unavailable to these individuals at any price.
   ``Those people who want to work should have the opportunity to do
so,'' Riegle said. ``A disabled person should not be punished by
taking away much needed medical benefits.''
   The legislation, whose chief co-sponsor is Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas, would cover about 4 million disabled workers
nationwide. A similar bill has been introduced in the House by Rep.
Steve Bartlett, R-Texas.
   Costs of the Senate legislation have been estimated at $120
million over five years, but that does not take into effect the
contributions to the economy that would be made by those who went
back to work.
   The bill is a followup to legislation enacted last session that
extended similar work incentives to recipients of Supplemental
Security Income, a separate program that provides a minimal income
floor to the nation's aged, disabled and blind.

<HEAD>Yeutter Expects to Propose 1990 Farm Bill by Year's End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said he
expects to have specific proposals for the 1990 farm bill to
Congress by the end of the year.
   He indicated Wednesday that his proposals would have a strong
emphasis on international concerns and would continue the
market-oriented concepts of the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   ``As we develop this legislation, we must do so realizing that we
are operating in a global marketplace,'' Yeutter told the House
Agriculture Committee, which is in the beginning stages of hearings
toward formulating a new farm bill.
   The legislation will set U.S. agricultural policy for several
years. It will also include a vast array of programs ranging from
dairy price supports to crop programs for wheat, feed grains, rice,
soybeans, cotton and sugar.
   Besides the big-ticket commodity programs, the 1990 bill will
include other features that were built into the Food Security Act of
1985, which will expire next year.
   The law also includes credit programs operated by the Farmers
Home Administration, rural development, extension and research. The
bill also will include provisions for operating USDA's food stamp
program, which serves more than 20 million Americans annually, and a
number of other child and nutrition programs.
   Yeutter lauded provisios of the 1985 law that enabled USDA to
reduce the relatively high price support levels of previous years.
That had the effect of lowering U.S. crop prices and make them more
competitive on the world market.
   When asked by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., when he would present
his proposals to Congress, Yeutter said he didn't know, but added,
``Probably before the end of the year.''
   In his opening statement, Yeutter said government policy makers
``have to be responsive to changing supply demands ... and marketing
opportunities.''
   He said current policies toward soybean and oat production
indicate ``we are not committed to competing.''
   He said consumer demand for oat bran as a preventative against
heart disease and other ailments has created a market for oats both
domestically and internationally that government policy has not
caught up with.
   ``We could be producing oats for the American market and
exporting them, if we had anything to sell,'' he said.
   He also said the government has ``never thought globally'' about
dairy products.
   ``It's a new world out there,'' he said.
   He called for a budget commitment to research and development,
saying the United States would not be on the leading edge of world
agriculture otherwise.
   He pointed out a potential demand for agricultural products for
uses other than food, saying the debate over clean air could lead to
a call for ethanol-powered vehicles. The government should prepare
farmers for that demand by developing appropriate farm programs, he
said.
   Yeutter, who was the U.S. trade representative under President
Reagan, re-emphasized his frequently voiced concern about
international trade negotiations and their effect on the farm bill.
   ``It would be foolish indeed if we wrote our farm bill oblivious
to what is happening'' in other countries, he said. The United
States is trying to get other countries to drop or seriously reduce
their subsidies on exports, but those talks, known as the Uruguay
Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will not be
complete before the 1990 farm bill is written.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department cannot adequately enforce
federal antitrust laws because of budget cuts that have reduced
funding and staffing, an American Bar Association panel said in a
report.
   The 15-member panel's report, released Wednesday, also called on
Bush administration officials to end ``rhetoric'' that some existing
antitrust laws are outdated and shouldn't be enforced.
   ``...the task force members uniformly believe that the antitrust
division's core mission _ to preserve competitive markets _ cannot
be carried out at the current reduced levels of staffing and
resources,'' says the 59-page report.
   The report was submitted to the bar association's antitrust
section and was not considered as representing the position of the
section or the association. It was released in New York by Irving
Scher, chairman of the bar association's antitrust section, which
monitors and recommends changes in antitrust law.
   Scher said copies of the report were sent to Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh and the recently appointed antitrust division head,
James F. Rill. The ABA antitrust section was likely to approve the
report and refer it to the full association, Scher said.
   Asked for his reaction to the report, Rill said, ``On balance,
it's positive.
   ``It confirms the enforcement priorities of the division _
criminal enforcement and merger enforcement,'' Rill said.
   He said the report ``makes some useful suggestions regarding
structural and competition analysis that can be brought into play in
deregulation and still somewhat regulated industries.''
   While Rill said the report ``probably is a bit off the mark in
suggesting that the merger guidelines have not been fully
enforced,'' he said, ``it does represent a public perception'' that
the antitrust division has not enforced those guidelines.
   Noting his brief tenure, Rill said he has not made any final
assessment as to whether the division has enough manpower and money
to do its job. The division has about 500 people, he said, including
230 attorneys and 40 economists.
   Under 1982 and 1984 modifications in federal antitrust laws, many
constraints against mergers in a range of industries were eased as
the Reagan administration endorsed allowing market forces to
regulate competition.
   ``Although it was important to highlight the excesses of prior
enforcement policies and substantive antitrust doctrines, the task
force believes that further reliance on this rhetoric will undermine
self-policing and voluntary compliance with the law,'' the panel
stated.
   It added that ``diminished support for antitrust enforcement has
allowed the talent and other resources of the division to shrink, as
its mission was lost in the `non-action' enforcement rhetoric of the
times.''
   Panel member Paul J. McGrath, a former assistant attorney general
for antitrust, disagreed with the contention that criticism of
exisiting laws had undercut enforcement policies. He and various
other panel members also dissented from several key criticisms
contained in the report.
   The panel said that under the Reagan administration's
deregulatory philosophy enforcement of actions other than
bid-rigging and price-fixing have become ``extremely rare.''
   It said that during the 1980s, when merger activity skyrocketed,
antitrust division resources devoted to merger enforcement actions
declined and the Justice Department allowed a significant number of
mergers it did not statistically define as competitive.
   While supporting overall changes in antitrust laws, the panel
recommended a ``more vigorous and visible merger enforcement
program'' and said antitrust laws should not be relaxed further. It
also called for more criminal price-fixing investigations.
   In pressing for increased funding, the group said the antitrust
division staff had been reduced by 50 percent in the last eight
years and many of its most experienced lawyers had left. It said
support for antitrust division lawyers appeared to be at an
``all-time low.''
   The panel included three former assistant attorneys general in
charge of the antitrust division, former senior staff members,
private antitrust attorneys, scholars and economists.
   Rill said some of the report's criticism ``is misdirected. The
suggestion that the division is using some set of standards other
than the merger guidelines simply isn't the case.''
   Rill rejected the report's contention that criminal enforcement
of antitrust laws had been aimed mostly at small companies instead
of regional or national ones.

<HEAD>Contract Costs Mean Loss for Northrop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. lost $78.1 million in its
second quarter despite an earnings increase because of additional
costs it must bear on secret research and development contracts, the
defense contractor reported.
   Northrop announced Wednesday that sales were $1.4 billion for the
quarter, up 4 percent from the same period in 1988.
   However, the firm had a net loss of $78.1 million compared with a
profit of $21.9 million, or 47 cents a share, for the 1988 period.
   The loss was caused by $150 million in estimated additional costs
to complete a classified long-term, fixed-price contract.
   Northrop said the contract was unrelated to its B-2 stealth
bomber program, which has suffered cost overruns.
   For the first half of 1989, Northrop had a net loss of $68.4
million on virtually flat sales of $2.68 billion, compared with a
profit of $161.5 million, or $3.44 per share, for the same period
last year.

   Rockwell International Corp. said that
despite flat sales, its profit rose 11 percent to $178.1 million in
the third quarter of its 1989 fiscal year compared with a year
earlier.
   The aerospace, automotive, electronics and graphics firm reported
earnings Wednesday of 70 cents a share for the period ended June 30.
That compared with a profit of $214.7 million, or 82 cents a share,
for the third quarter of 1988.
   The 1988 figure included a one-time favorable tax adjustment of
$50.2 million.
   Sales for the 1989 third quarter were $3.2 billion, compared with
$3.1 billion for the 1988 period.
   Profit for the first nine months of fiscal 1989 totaled $608.8
million, or $2.37 a share, compared with $626 million, or $2.34 a
share, for the 1988 period. The fiscal 1989 earnings included $100
million from the sale of a division.
   Nine-month sales for 1989 were $9.2 billion, up from $8.8 billion

<HEAD>New Fashion Magazine Settles Down to Hard Work of Making It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The glittering coming-out party for Mirabella,
the new women's fashion magazine, is history. The upbeat reviews
have been written, and the gossip columnists have turned their
attention elsewhere.
   Now begins the waiting game. Will the upscale fashion and
lifestyle guide for the well-educated woman be a lasting hit? Or
will it join the heap of new magazines that fold after only a few
years?
   ``It's going very well. I think wonderfully well,'' Grace
Mirabella, the monthly's editor and namesake, said Wednesday. All
600,000 copies of the premier issue in June sold out, she said.
   But this veteran of the competitive, crowded world of magazines
knows success can be fleeting. ``I'm anxiety-ridden,'' she says.
   And the sales figures for the July issue _ 70 to 75 percent of
600,000 copies are expected to sell _ could be interpreted as
cautionary. But Julie Lewit-Nirenberg, the magazine's publisher,
noted that summer is traditionally a slow time in the magazine
business and that the first issue sold for $1 compared to the hefty
$2.95 that the buyer must now fork out.
   She also said the number of advertising pages dropped from 123 in
June to 85 in July and 50 in August. But the picture is rosy for the
September issue, which just closed for printing with 149 advertising
pages, she added.
   Ms. Mirabella described the pitfalls to avoid if the magazine is
to succeed.
   ``We have to keep our eye on the reader we think we have _ where
her head is and how she sees us. The reader we have is an
intelligent reader, selective in her view and selective in her eye.''
   By targeting a narrowly defined audience of well-educated, older
and affluent women, Mirabella has a chance of surviving in the
crowded fashion magazine market, said Joseph Ostrow, worldwide media
director of Foote, Cone and Belding, a New York ad agency.
   But a good six months will have to pass before any meaningful
judgment can be made on the publication, said Nancy Smith, senior
vice president of media services at Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., another
New York ad agency.
   ``Grace Mirabella is a well-known personality. And the launching
of the magazine was very gossiping and jet-setting,'' she noted.
``Once that dies out, then you are going to see what you are dealing
with. It's still too early to tell.''
   Ms. Smith said the money and backing of communications magnate
Rupert Murdoch bode well for Mirabella, as does the fact that Ms.
Mirabella is the creative force behind it.
   ``She is an extremely talented woman who has demonstrated her
strength before. I would be very optimistic about the long-term
success.''
   Ms. Mirabella was editor in chief of Vogue for 17 years before
she was abruptly dismissed in June 1988 by S.I. Newhouse Jr., the
head of magazine publisher Conde Nast. In November, Murdoch
approached her about presiding over a monthly bearing her name.
   In six months Ms. Mirabella not only assembled a staff but
produced a new magazine.
   Despite its goals, the glossy, oversized publication has some
features that can hardly be considered intelligent reading material.
One article in the June issue lists the favorite lipstick color of
actress Joan Collins, designer Caroline Herrera and jewelry designer
Paloma Picasso.
   But its tone is more subtle than many other fashion magazines _
both in its fashion coverage and its features. And Ms. Mirabella and
her staff pride themselves on the fact that the monthly is almost
half text.
   ``It's a smart and intelligent magazine for women interested in
style and fashion but like a little more protein in reading matter,
not just a sugar high,'' Ms. Lewit-Nirenberg said.

<HEAD>Texas Air to Buy Boeing Jets in $2.8 Billion Deal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Eastern, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp.'s plans to order up to 100 new
jets in a $2.8 billion deal signifies its ailing carriers,
Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines, expect improved financial
conditions, analysts say.
   Analysts said Wednesday the deal was an important one for
Eastern, now in the midst of bankruptcy reorganiztion and a
lingering strike, but said both Texas Air subsidiaries probably are
speculating on better times before the start of deliveries in 1992.
   ``Each of them, along with a couple of other carriers in the
industry, have been facing some financial difficulty,'' said George
James, president of Washington-based Airline Economics Inc., an
aviation consulting firm.
   ``But with the first delivery in 1992 they could be betting on
the fact that they will have improved significantly in their
financial performance by that time and be able to arrange some good
financing,'' James said.
   Sixty of the Boeing Co. jets are earmarked for Continental and 40
for Eastern.
   Houston-based Texas Air also announced Wednesday that Continental
soon would purchase 11 widebody Airbus A300 jets and spare parts
from Eastern for $303.5 million. In addition, Continental plans to
lease two McDonnell Douglas DC-10s from Eastern and in return lease
34 of its jets to its sister carrier.
   ``I think this is an important step in Continental's return to
profitability and confidence in the future of the airline,'' said D.
Joseph Corr, Continental's chairman and chief executive officer.
``Overall, we're looking at more seats to more destinations than
prior to these changes.''
   Continental agreed to buy as many as 60 of Boeing's narrow-body
737-300s, with deliveries of 30 aircraft planned for 1992 to 1994
and with an option to purchase another 30 of the jets in 1995 and
1996.
   The total cost of the Continental purchase would be about $1.7
billion, Corr said, adding that about three-quarters of the new
fleet would replace aging aircraft.
   Corr declined to discuss financing for the purchase. Continental
posted a first-quarter loss of $16.5 million, narrowed from an $80.6
million loss in the same quarter of 1988.
   In a statement, Texas Air said it would obtain financing for the
planes ``in later years, nearer to the delivery dates, based on
prevailing capital market conditions and projections.''
   Airline analyst Louis A. Marckesano, of Philadelphia-based Janney
Montgomery Scott, said the airlines' competitive position in the
1990s strongly depended on orders for new jets.
   ``The biggest difference we find right now between the haves and
the have-nots in the industry is the airplanes on order,'' he said.
   ``It may sound like a trite thing to say, but when you're
spelling out the differences that will exist between these two
groups, the share of market these airlines hold in the future ... is
going to directly hinge on the size of their fleets,''he said.
   Continental, a non-union carrier that emerged from bankruptcy
reorganization in 1986, and Eastern were among only three major U.S.
airlines that did not have new planes on order. Troubled Pan Am
Corp. is now the only one in that category.
   The agreement with Boeing allows Continental to substitute a
portion of its order for Boeing's 737-400s or 737-500s, which have
different seating capacities, allowing for greater flexibility as
the airline's needs change in the coming years, Corr said.

<HEAD>Ruder: Give SEC More Authority to Fine Miscreants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange can fine its member
brokers who engage in securities fraud but the government cannot, a
situation the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
wants to change.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told a House subcommittee Wednesday
that under current law, his agency can impose fines only in a few
instances, mostly for insider trading.
   But several self-regulating organizations overseen by his agency,
including the National Association of Securities Dealers and the
NYSE, have more authority to fine their members than the SEC does,
he added.
   ``And this legislation would remedy that disparity,'' said Ruder.
   The chairman said the proposal to widen the scope of the SEC's
ability to seek fines would give it and the courts more flexibility
to fit the penalty to the crime, take away much of the financial
incentive for white collar crooks, discourage repeat offenders from
breaking the rules again, and help the government recoup some of the
money spent enforcing the law.
   On another matter, Ruder told reporters after the hearing that
he's still ``waiting around'' for the White House to name his
successor.
   Ruder, who announced plans in May to return to teaching law at
Northwestern University, said that despite the Bush administration's
inaction, ``I haven't made up my mind when I will leave.''
   On the proposed legislation, SEC Enforcement Director Gary Lynch
explained that a change was needed because ``for all practical
purposes, our fining authority is limited to insider trading.''
   A 1988 law allows the SEC to seek civil fines of as much as three
times the amount of illegal profits from those who trade illegally
on confidential information.
   But in other SEC civil actions for stock manipulation or
securities fraud ``there's no ability for a court to impose a
fine,'' said Lynch.
   He noted that the SEC is empowered to seek restitution, called
disgorgement, of illegal profits _ but not fines, which are now only
possible after criminal convictions. But criminal cases must be
brought by the Justice Department.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, noted that in fiscal
1988, ``only 25 of the 252 enforcement cases initiated by the SEC
primarilly involved insider trading.''
   For most other civil violations, the SEC has only two
alternatives: seeking an injunction against further violations or
suspending a Wall Street firm's broker-dealer's license, which
Markey termed ``the regulatory death penalty.''
   Lynch, who is stepping down later this month after more than a
dozen years with the SEC, said that censure is not enough punishment
in many cases but suspending a broker-dealer's license ``even for
one day'' would be going too far.
   If one section of a large, multiservice firm violated securities
law ``it's not going to be appropriate to take actions that would
affect the entire firm _ not to mention that it would hurt the
customers as well, leaving their accounts frozen for the day. It
really isn't a viable alternative,'' said Lynch.
   The new legislation also would empower the SEC to seek, either
through an administrative proceeding or court order, a bar against
security law violators serving as officers or directors of any
SEC-registered company.
   Outside the meeting room, Ruder, who previously said he would
stay on at the SEC until a successor was named, said ``I suppose the
final means of forcing some action would be for me to leave,''
although he has not set a deadline for himself.
   Ruder also said that no successor has been selected yet for
Lynch, who was repeatedly praised by subcommittee members at the
hearing.
   Lynch, who played a central role in breaking a series of insider
trading cases including stock speculator Ivan Boesky and investment
banking giant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said he would decide
``within the next couple of days'' where he will work after leaving
the SEC.

<HEAD>Chrysler: Trucks 'R' Us</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the time being, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
Iacocca says, the nation's No. 3 automaker is more of a truckmaker
than a carmaker.
   ``If you call minivans trucks, it looks that way because in the
last 40 days in total, we've sold one car for every truck,'' Iacocca
said in an interview this week.
   ``Other companies aren't quite in that position,'' he said, ``but
that's just because of (Jeep) Cherokee strength and minivan
strength.''
   Auto industry analysts say the struggling company's emphasis on
the profitable Jeeps and minivans may be the best tonic.
   ``Right now, it's a truckmaker that also makes cars,'' said auto
analyst Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of San
Francisco. ``I think it's an intelligent decision on Chrysler's part
because trucks make more money that cars.''
   Chrysler is expected to announce Monday that its second-quarter
earnings were near or slightly lower than those during the same time
last year. This time around, the company will be relying more on the
dollars generated by trucks than in the past.
   Chrysler, through its Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, holds
56 percent of the minivan market in the United States. It pioneered
the popular vehicles back in 1983 and has held most of the market
since.
   Through the first half of this year _ and for the first time in
history _ Chrysler sold more domestically made light trucks than
cars. Together, those vehicles make up more than 90 percent of the
company's fleet.
   Trough June 30 this year, the company sold 0.97 cars for each
truck. A year ago at the same time, the ratio was 1.14 cars per
truck. The gap was wider in the first half of 1987, as the company
sold 1.56 cars per truck.
   General Motors Corp.'s car sales have run slightly more than
twice the rate of its truck sales, and Ford sells better than 1.5
cars for every truck.
   Despite the dominance of truck sales at Chrysler, Iacocca said
the company is very much in the carmaking business.
   ``We can't become just a truck company,'' he said. ``We've got
good car programs. First of all, our luxury cars are in pretty good
shape because they're not too big.
   ``Then we have an all new platform coming in late '92,'' he said.
``That's a billion-dollar effort at a new mid-size group of cars and
they're coming along nicely.
   ``The one that's tough is we don't have an (Dodge) Omni
replacement at the moment. Our smallest car really is the P-car, the
Plymouth Sundance-Dodge Shadow.''
   Chrysler isn't letting today's truck business take care of
tomorrow. There will be more competition in the segment beginning in
the next few months as the new GM minivans come to the market and as
foreign companies, including Mazda, introduce more versions.
   A growing number of companies also are offering sport-utility
vehicles like Chrysler's Jeep line. But Chrysler isn't standing
still.
   The company has broken ground for a new assembly plant in Detroit
that will make a Jeep model code-named the ``ZJ.'' Earlier this
year, Iacocca announced that Chrysler and the French automaker
Renault would join forces to make a smaller sport-utility vehicle
named the ``JJ.''
   Both of those products are to be introduced in the early 1990s
and mean the company will have more truck production capacity than
it does now.
   Anyone watching Chrysler's profits knows the company these days
is making money from minivans and Jeeps.
   ``People look at the car side and wonder if they are at a
competitive disadvantage to Ford and General Motors,'' said analyst
Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York. ``That's hopefully
just a temporary condition.
   ``But clearly, now you can make an excellent case if you want to
classify it as a truckmaker,'' he said. ``Over the next couple of
years, you'd have to say the show belongs mostly to the truck side
of the operation.''

<HEAD>Time Releases Brief in Delaware Supreme Coury Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc., maintaining its board has the right to
decide the company's long-term strategy, has asked the Delaware
Supreme Court to uphold a lower court decision allowing the media
giant to proceed with its $14 billion tender offer for Warner
Communications Inc.
   Time made the request in a brief filed Wednesday with the Supreme
Court, two days after Paramount Communications Inc. asked the court
to overturn the ruling by Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen and
block the planned Time-Warner merger.
   Paramount is trying to buy Time in a hostile $12.2 billion tender
offer.
   Allen ruled last week the proposed Time-Warner merger resulted
from Time's long-term business strategy and that Paramount and Time
shareholders, who are also trying to stop the merger, had not proved
they possessed a right to interfere with the transaction.
   Paramount claimed in its brief that Allen's decision would allow
Time to proceed although the merger _ and Time's long-term strategy
_ would cost Time shareholders the financial benefits of the
$200-a-share Paramount bid.
   Time responded that the state Supreme Court itself noted, in a
1985 case involving Unocal Corp. and takeover strategist T. Boone
Pickens, that ``there is substantial evidence that director
resistance to hostile bids, even at a premium over market price,
tends in the long run to enhance market prices.''
   The Supreme Court also has stated that ```a board of directors is
not a passive instrumentality' even in matters of fundamental
corporate change,'' and that directors are allowed and even
obligated to take steps to protect shareholder interests in the face
of a tender offer, Time contended.
   Delaware's highest court will hear the case Monday, and the
justices could rule at any time after arguments are concluded.
Time's $70-a-share tender offer for Warner is scheduled to expire at
5 p.m. Monday.
   Paramount charged in its brief that Allen used improperly used
standards for director actions set in the Unocal case, but Time said
the judge's decision was ``unquestionably the product of an orderly
and logical deductive process.''
   Time said further there was support for the board's actions in a
case arising from the takeover battle for Macmillan Inc. last year.
The case allowed a board to use several criteria in refusing to
entertain offers that threaten corporate policy, including a firm's
long-term plans, Time said.
   Nothing in the Macmillan decision ``suggests that these criteria
_ particularly `long-term strategic' plans _ become inoperative in
the face of an all-cash, all-shares tender offer,'' Time said.
   Time stock closed up $1.37{ a share to close at $139.37{ in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Warner was unchanged at
$65.62{ a share, and Paramount picked up $1.62{ to close at $58.62{
a share.
   Separately, Time announced Wednesday its second-quarter earnings
rose 12 percent to $94 million, or $1.61 per share, up from $84
million, or $1.45 a share, in the same period of 1988.
   Revenue for the period rose to $1.22 billion from $1.1 billion.
   Time said in a statement all of its business segments _
magazines, books, programming and cable television _ had improved
results during the quarter.
   For the first half, Time had it earned $143 million, or $2.49 a
share, down from $150 million, or $2.58 a share, in the first six
months of 1988.
   The first-half results were affected by Time's lower
first-quarter profits, which fell due to lower operating earnings
from the company's magazine segment, heavier interest expenses and
costs related to the Warner deal.
   First-half revenue totaled $2.35 billion, up from $2.17 billion a
year earlier.
   Warner announced its earnings on Tuesday.

   Spot gold was steady at lower levels in quiet trading.
   Traders said the dollar appeared to be on an upward course.
   ``We tried to take it lower yesterday, but that got nowhere. So

   In London late Wednesday, one British pound cost $1.6112,
compared with Wednesday's late $1.6195.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.9147 West German marks, up from
1.9007; 1.6520 Swiss francs, up from 1.6465; 6.4950 French francs,
up from 6.4490; 2.1600 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1340; 1,385.25
Italian lire, from 1,374.50; 1.1863 Canadian dollars, down from

<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers and Pittston Coal
Group Inc. resumed contract talks with both sides digging in their
heels on the key issue of benefits for retired miners.
   Pittston Coal President Michael Odom stated flatly Wednesday that
the company won't take part in the ``union-sponsored health and
retirement funds. Period.''
   The company's attempt to withdraw from the union's industrywide
pension and health care plans in favor of a program for Pittston
employees has been a main issue in the 3{-month-old strike. The
union fears that if Pittston pulls out of the plan, other employers
will too.
   ``We've given everything we have to give,'' Odom said at company
headquarters in Lebanon. ``Give us a proposal that displays this
(union) flexibility.''
   Odom's statement was ``basically another demonstration of bad
faith,'' UMW President Richard Trumka said.
   Pittston has never said it is unable to afford any proposal the
UMW has offered including the pension plans, Trumka said.
   The two sides met for the first time in six weeks at a motel in
this southwest Virginia town. They sat in separate rooms with
federal mediators shuttling notes back and forth. Talks were to
resume today.
   Trumka said Pittston refuses to rescind what the company calls
its final offer, which the union rejected last month.
   ``They want us to be flexible but they don't want to be,'' union
spokesman Joe Corcoran said.
   Odom said earlier Wednesday on ``CBS This Morning'' that the
company was standing by its previous contract proposal.
   ``At this point the movement will have to come from the union,''
Odom said. ``We have our proposal on the table.
   The 1950 UMW retirement fund covers 130,000 pensioners who
retired between 1947 and 1976. It was established so miners who went
from company to company when mines shut down could have pensions,
Corcoran said.
   Pittston, which has 560 retirees covered by the fund, said it
doesn't make sense for the company to contribute to pensions
received by retirees of other companies.
   Trumka said the union wouldn't give in on the issue. The UMW
won't ``turn our backs on 130,000 pensioners,'' he said.
   Later, Trumka told a rally of about 3,000 union members and
supporters in St. Paul that the UMW plans to increase pressure on
directors of The Pittston Co., parent of the coal company.
   Union officials said that pressure will be demonstrated today
with a visit by Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn to the region.
   The Boston City Council has threatened to pull city funds out of
Shawmut Bank unless William Craig, a member of Pittston's board who
is connected to the bank, resigns his board seat.
   About 1,900 UMW miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky
went on strike against Pittston beginning April 5, because of the
company's refusal to sign a national contract outlawing mandatory
overtime and Sunday work, in addition to the retirement benefits
issue.
   Up to 46,000 miners in 10 states had been off the job until
Monday in wildcat strikes to support Pittston workers. Most have
gone back to work but the union said up to 40 percent of the 7,900
union miners in south-central and southwestern West Virginia
remained on strike Wednesday.
   Fred Tucker, contract administrator for seven UMW Districts, said
he expected all to return to work by today.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar closed higher against the Japanese
yen Thursday, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index rose
moderately.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 107.70
points, or 0.32 percent, ending the day's trading at 33,664.87. The
index had gained 213.44 points Wednesday.
   The dollar ended at 142.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from Wednesday's
141.80-yen close. Opening higher at 142.80 yen, the currency
gradually moved downward, ranging between 142.05 yen and 142.90 yen.
   The currency started higher in Tokyo following an overnight rise
in New York despite a lower-than-expected consumer price index
figure released Wednesday, said Hisashi Matsuda, a trader with Daiwa
Bank.
   The U.S. Department of Commerce reported the nation's index for
June rose by 0.2 percentage point, compared with a 0.6-percentage
point increase in May.
   The small increase in the index indicates a slowdown in the
economy, meaning inflationary pressure is easing.
   ``It seems that market players bought the dollar regardless of
the U.S. economic fundamentals,'' Matsuda said. Indicators showing a
slowdown in the economy normally discourage investors from buying
the currency.
   ``Concerns over the upcoming election have made the yen less
attractive, but many investors seem to be buying the dollar not
because they are avoiding the yen temporarily but because they think
it's still profitable to invest in the U.S. currency,'' he said.
   Many believe that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will lose
badly in the parliamentary election scheduled for Sunday. The LDP
has been hurt by an influence-peddling scandal, an unpopular sales
tax and Prime Minister Sousuke Uno's alleged relationships with paid
mistresses.
   On the stock exchange, the index rose moderately during the
morning session and kept the gains though trading slowed in the
afternoon, dealers said.
   Afternoon trading was directionless, said a dealer with a major
securities firm in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said many market players remained on the sidelines ahead of
Sunday's polls.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 500
million shares, up from Wednesday's 330 million.
   Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that it suspended
trading of the shares of Iseki and Co., a manufacturer of farm
machinery, from 1:00 p.m. to the closing of the day at 3:00 p.m.
   The price of Iseki plunged 34 points and more than 2 million
selling orders were filed due to a rumor about the company's capital
reduction, said a TSE official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The TSE suspended transactions in the firm's stock to check the
rumor, which was later denied by company officials, he said.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new 620-room casino hotel is on the
drawing board for Resorts International Inc., a company already
burdened with massive debt.
   When entertainer Merv Griffin purchased Resorts International
last November, he inherited the obligation to develop Atlantic
City's Uptown Urban Renewal Tract, long a desolate site just a few
blocks away from the Resorts casino.
   Earlier this week, Resorts officials submitted plans to the
Atlantic City Housing Authority for the 56-acre plot. A
60,000-square-foot casino with a 32-story hotel tower and
2,860-space parking garage will take up about 14 acres, according to
the designs.
   Resorts also outlined plans for the rest of the tract, including
a shopping center and parking spaces.
   The plans were submitted several weeks after Resorts quietly
announced it hired the Salomon Brothers investment banking firm to
help it refinance its enormous corporate debt.
   Resorts has more than $900 million in long-term debt, including
$200 million in mortgage bonds and $125 million in notes that
Griffin sold to finance his takeover of the company from developer
Donald Trump.
   Gaming analyst Marvin B. Roffman of the Philadelphia investment
firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. said Wednesday that Resorts' plans
for the renewal tract ``are all pie in the sky.''
   ``This company is going to have to restructure, period. The
sooner, the better,'' he said. ``There is no way in the world that
any sane person would lend this company any more money. Everyone on
Wall Street is against them.''
   Roffman said that Resorts management also needs to prove it can
run a casino without losing market share. The gaming hall's market
share has declined in the past year.
   Resorts officials said they do not plan to build or finance the
proposed casino hotel, estimated to cost $262 million. Christopher
Whitney, Resorts' chief of staff, said the company is looking for a
third party to finance the project.
   Resorts had already received two extensions on a deadline to
submit its proposals to the housing authority, but was denied
another extension request.
   Resorts is now obligated to take title to the land from the
housing authority by September for the first phase of the project,
which includes the shopping center, said authority director John
McAvaddy. Construction must begin 90 days after the land is
acquired, he said.
   The second phase of the proposal, which focuses on the casino,
must be acquired by next April, he said.
   The authority realizes Resorts' financial predicament, McAvaddy
said Wednesday.
   ``That is the reason they are seeking a joint venture partner,
because the financial picture indicates there might be a problem in
financing the development in-house,'' he said.
   Resorts may be viewed with skepticism when it does start
developing the renewal tract. In 1976, Resorts bought development
rights to the tract for $5.6 million and promised to build at least
1,200 housing units and an accompanying shopping center.
   But the acreage bounced along with the changing owners of
Resorts. Under Resorts founder James Crosby, the development was
stalled by litigation from a prior developer and state claims.
   When Crosby died in 1986, Trump bought the gaming hall and
unveiled plans for a complex that would have been like a city within
a city.
   Griffin purchased Resorts from Trump last year. The new proposal
explores transferring the housing obligation from the urban renewal
tract to other Resorts property in the city.
   McAvaddy said the housing authority is willing to discuss that
possibility.
   ``If they do build housing within the tract, it would probably be
upper-middle or luxury housing, and it would not meet the demands to
serve the people we're aiming it for,'' he said.
   Even the proposed shopping center might be better placed,
McAvaddy said, perhaps closer to new housing developments in the
city's inlet section.
   Resorts has the option of modifying its plans in the next few
months, he said, until the time when preliminary construction plans
are due.

<TEXT>
   The rich, the famous and the
beautiful love to summer on Martha's Vineyard. So does everyone else.
   But this year, locals who feared their idyllic island was being
overrun by tourists are complaining of a summer spending slump.
   The Martha's Vineyard Chamber of Commerce blames a weakening
economy that has depressed tourism across New England and a tougher
ferry policy for cars adopted in an effort to control traffic.
   ``Things are off regionally,'' the chamber's executive director,
Angeljean Chiaramida, said Wednesday. ``They're off for us a little
more because of the perception that people are not going to be able
to get here.''
   Receipts at local hotels, restaurants and stores are down at
least 20 percent and for some merchants as much as 40 percent, said
Jane Tomassian, executive director of the Martha's Vineyard
Historical Preservation Society.
   Many hotels post vacancy signs even on Saturday night.
Reservations are not essential at elegant seaside restaurants where
old money and new talent rub shoulders. The real estate market is
sluggish, and some private homes were not rented this summer.
   After area residents complained of endless traffic jams, the
Steamship Authority agreed to stop guaranteeing passage to autos
without reservations. Though 99 percent stand-by motorists are
ferried across within a day, merchants say the lack of a guarantee
deters many travelers.
   ``I think word has filtered out, `Forget going to the Vineyard
unless you made your reservation a year ago because you can't
possibly get your car over,''' Tomassian said.
   A spokesman for the Steamship Authority said the number of
passengers and cars ferried to the island from Jan. 1 to July 4
actually increased slightly compared with last year.
   ``I could speculate and say that while we're carrying people we
don't search them and check them to see how much they're going to
spend,'' spokesman Ray Martin said. ``Maybe people traveling these
days have a tighter budget once they get off the vessel.''
   Conservationists, however, welcome a season of sanity after a
decade of unrelenting growth.
   ``The business people are never satisfied,'' said Eleanor H.
Krantz, head of the Martha's Vineyard Conservation Society. ``They'd
like to have every road filled with people and all the cars and all
the stuff that makes life miserable.''
   Celebrities are certainly not deserting the resort. Already this
summer islanders have spotted the likes of Jackie Onassis, Walter
Cronkite, Beverly Sills, Mike Wallace, Dan Akroyd and James Reston.
Year-round residents include Carly Simon, actress Patricia Neal and
heirs to the Spalding, Corning Glass and Vanderbilt fortunes.
   The slump is bad news for year-round Vineyard residents, who must
earn the bulk of their annual income in 100 summer days, Chiaramida
said. It is also bad news for the Oak Bluffs, Edgartown and Vineyard
Haven, which depend on a 4 percent hotel tax to stay afloat, she
said.
   According to Tomassian, the slump has renewed tensions between
workaday islanders who thrive on tourists and well-to-do summer folk
who fear their T-shirt shops will overrun the island.
   ``I'm afraid that things have become so polarized,'' she said.
``You are either an environmentalist or you are pro-development and
pro-business. Maybe this (slump will) ... make people realize that
what's needed is a happy medium.''

   The stock market was mixed today, bogging down
after Wednesday's rally to new post-crash highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .57 to 2,548.98
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 407 up, 523 down and
536 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.65 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were proceeding cautiously as Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, testified before
the House Banking Committee on the Fed's credit policies.
   As expected, Greenspan said the central bank had taken note of a
slowing in the pace of economic activity, and was seeking to avoid
``an unnecessary and destructive recession.''
   However, he also noted that inflation remained clearly above
where the Fed would like to see it.
   Brokers said that gave investors few concrete clues about what
steps the Fed was likely to take next.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph led the active list, up ] at 37\.
The company reported second quarter earnings of 65 cents a share, up
from 55 cents in the like period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dipped
.01 to 187.11. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .58 at 371.82.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 39.65 to
2,584.41, stretching its gain since the start of the month to 144.35
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 5 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 1,065 up, 440 down and 483 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 215.74 million shares, up from 152.35

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Earnings Rise 18 Percent In Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
second-quarter profit grew 18 percent to a record $699 million,
according to a statement Thursday that showed the company coping
with intensifying competition in long-distance service.
   Separately, Southwestern Bell Corp. said its earnings rose 22.8
percent in the quarter.
   AT&amp;T's sales of services _ primarily long-distance _ climbed 9.8
percent, while sales of products ranging from decorator phones to
million-dollar switches rose 3.8 percent.
   ``It was an excellent quarter all around,'' AT&amp;T Chairman Robert
E. Allen said in a news release.
   AT&amp;T achieved the record earnings in spite of strong gains made
by its nearest rivals in long-distance. Earnings more than doubled
in the latest quarter at both MCI Communications Corp. and United
Telecommunications Inc., the majority owner of US Sprint
Communications Co.
   AT&amp;T said its profit rose to $699 million, or 65 cents a share,
from $594 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Overall
revenue from services, products and rentals rose 5.2 percent to
$9.26 billion from $8.8 billion.
   For the first half, earnings rose 19.1 percent to $1.29 billion,
or $1.20 a share, from $1.09 billion, or $1.01 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 4.2 percent to $17.9 billion from $17.2
billion.
   St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell, one of AT&amp;T's offspring, said
its earnings rose to $261.5 million, or 87 cents a share, from
$212.9 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
5.3 percent to $2.14 billion from $2.03 billion.
   For the first half, Southwestern Bell's profit rose 15.9 percent
to $500.3 million, or $1.66 a share, from $431.6 million, or $1.44 a
share. Revenue rose 4.1 percent to $4.2 billion from $4.03 billion.

<HEAD>Increasing Travel Costs Targeted by Accounting Firm</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business-trip costs can send corporate travel
managers through the roof, but a big accounting firm says its new
computer software package can help put employees on the road for
less.
   New York-based Price Waterhouse is marketing Air Auditor, an IBM
personal computer compatible software program that keeps track of
the schedules and air fares offered by domestic airlines.
   Alan D. Miles, manager of Price Waterhouse's Travel Management
Consulting Group, says the $1,500-Air Auditor package can be used to
plan an employee's itinerary or confirm the lowest fare.
   The software also can control future travel costs when
information on the company's travel policies are stored in Air
Auditor's database.
   Class of service, connecting flights, ground transporation,
airline preference and other information can be evaluated by the
software to give a company the lowest possible cost for any travel
itinerary, Miles said.
   Although in use only a few months, Air Auditor is getting good
reviews.
   ``I think it's doing fine,'' said Nancy Rowley, operations
manager of U.S. West Inc., a regional Bell company headquartered in
Denver. ``It is another tool for us to keep corporate travel costs
down.''
   Price Waterhouse estimates U.S. corporations spent about $100
billion last year on travel and entertainment, with about 40 percent
on air tickets alone.
   The accounting firm hopes confusion caused by daily changes in
airline fares will increase demand for software it says could reduce
corporate travel costs by as much as 25 percent.
   Under development for three years, Air Auditor originally was
created by Airplan System Inc., a small Chicago software firm. Price
Waterhouse worked with the company to refine the program before
Airplan was acquired by System One, Inc., an airline reservation
system owned by Texas Air Corp.
   ``Let's say you're flying from Chicago to New York and you want
to leave around 5 p.m. Air Auditor will show what flights and fares
are available and rank those flights and fares to how well they meet
company travel policy,'' Miles said. ``It is the same information a
travel agent would look at. The computer deciphers it for you so you
don't have to be a trained travel agent to use it.''
   Miles said corporate ignorance has created problems selling the
software.
   ``Most companies are like we once were,'' he said. ``They don't
know how much is being spent on travel, so they don't know what can
be saved.''
   Price Waterhouse estimated three years ago it was spending $35
million a year on travel but later discovered the actual cost
exceeded $42 million.
   Part of the reason, Miles said, was ``we had a hundred different
offices using 500 different travel agencies.''
   He said the company instituted a travel policy that used only one
travel agent and required ``the lowest logical fare,'' forcing
employees to travel economy class. But the company also put a value
on the traveler's time.
   ``We won't look for a cheap fare that would have the traveler
spending three hours in Atlanta waiting for a connection,'' he said.
``This year we hope to reduce travel expenses by $6 million to $7
million.''
   Travel agents aren't offended having their customers looking over
their shoulders with Air Auditor.
   ``These systems are developed to meet a need,'' said Stephanie
Maxson of the American Society of Travel Agents, a trade association
in Alexandria, Va. ``Corporations are asking for more information
about fares.''
   Ms. Maxson said it's common for agents to be questioned about why
they didn't take advantage of a special promotion.
   ``A lot of corporate travel officers don't read the fine print,''
she said. ``The program will help them wade through all the
restrictions.''
   Ms. Rowley noted that U.S. West Communiciations spends about $25
million on corporate travel.
   ``It doesn't exclude us from using other means of reducing travel
costs,'' she said. ``It is just another tool.''
   She said that in checking fares through Air Auditor, the company
has discovered only a few instances where the travel agent failed to
find the cheapest fare. But she said the software is still useful.
   ``I don't know if we will ever get to the point of not using
it,'' she said. ``It is an ongoing tool to verify that our employees
are getting the lowest fares.''
   Air Auditor also is used by some airport authorities to determine
whether the fares offered by airlines are competitive with other
airports within driving distance.
   Tom Miller, assistant director of the Greater Peoria Airport
Authority, says he wants to ensure that fares offered by airlines
serving Peoria's airport are competitive to those offered in St.
Louis and Chicago.
   ``When prices get out of line, we contact the airlines and tell
them we noted that fares might be higher in a particular market,''
said Tom Miller, assistant director of the Greater Peoria Airport
Authority, who worries about competition from the airports in St.
Louis and Chicago. ``We ask for explanation, and if it is not
satisfactory ask that they be lowered.''

<HEAD>Brunswick to Cut 4,000 Jobs Nationwide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brunswick Corp. says it will cut the jobs of 4,000
workers _ about 20 percent of its employees _ from its troubled
marine operations because of a sharp drop in demand for pleasure
boats and engines.
   Workers will be laid off at more than 30 plants in 28 states,
Brunswick said Wednesday, announcing an expected 75 percent plunge
in second-quarter earnings from record results of $68.3 million, or
78 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier.
   The biggest cuts will be at the Skokie-based company's largest
facility, a Mercury Marine engine plant in Fond du Lac, Wis., where
300 workers will be let go, the company said. About 300 were laid
off there earlier this year.
   Projections for the quarter would mark it as the second
consecutive period of sinking profits at Brunswick because of
problems in the marine group, comprised of Sea Ray, U.S. Marine,
Mercury Marine and Mercury Powerboat divisions.
   Profits dived 68 percent in the first quarter to $17 million.
   At the time, the company blamed higher costs of materials, and
industry observers cited assembly problems and the practice of
selling boats and engines as a unit rather than separately.
   Chairman Jack F. Reichert said the slumping consumer demand in
the second quarter was ``virtually unprecedented'' after record
sales in the first quarter.
   Given the buildup in dealer inventories and the end of the normal
selling season, the company said it can't predict when and at what
level there might be callbacks of laid-off workers.
   Layoffs are to take place over the next two months.
   Brunswick's rival, suburban Waukegan-based Outboard Marine Corp.,
also reported dismal results at the beginning of the month. It
projected a 50 percent drop in its third-quarter earnings, blaming
its results on decreased demand.

<HEAD>Report on Employment in EEC Shows Surprising Rise in Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community's first
annual report on employment in the 12-nation trade bloc released
Thursday showed a rise of 2.5 million jobs since 1987 instead of a
predicted drop of 500,000.
   EEC Commissioner for Social Affairs, Vasso Papandreou, said that
forecasts made by the Cecchini report on the impact of the EEC's
plans to create a single, borderless market by Dec. 31, 1992 had
been ``wrong.''
   But Ms. Papandreou said ``despite the improvements there is still
a problem of underemployment'' in the Community.
   She added that opportunities to find jobs vary substantially from
area to area and that employers were slow to recognize that the
quality of products in the EEC was ``linked with the quality of the
labor market.''
   The report showed that the rate of employment in the EEC _ that
is, the number of people who have a job divided by the number of
people of working age _had dropped to less than 60 percent from 64
percent 20 years ago.
   Ms. Papandreou said this was ``substantially below that in other
industrialized parts of the world, the United States, Japan and the
Scandinavian countries'' where the employment rate is over 70
percent.
   The report is to be used to set employment policy guidelines and
was written, according to Ms. Papandreou, in clear and simple
language so that it would be ``widely read by all those concerned
with employment at national, regional and local levels in the member
states.''

   A Japanese toymaker said today it will stop selling
a black inflatable doll with big round eyes and a grass skirt, but
the company denied it was acting because critics called the doll
racist.
   Shusuke Kubota, a spokesman for Takara Co., said it also was
discontinuing the use of the doll, named ``Dakko-chan,'' as its
corporate symbol.
   Takara, which also makes ``Transformer'' robots that can be bent
and twisted into other objects, is the second Japanese company in
less than 10 days to say it is abandoning symbols that critics have
called derogatory to blacks.
   Last week, Calpis Food Industry Co. said it was discontinuing a
65-year-old trademark portraying a top-hatted black man sipping a
drink through a straw because some customers had found it
objectionable.
   But Kubota said Takara's decision to discontinue ``Dakko-chan''
had no connection with racial issues.
   ``It's not a black. It represents a Japanese child whose skin has
darkened from being out in the sun all summer long,'' he said.
   Takara has sold 2.4 million of the round-faced dolls, which can
cling to an arm or leg and wink as they move, since they were
introduced in 1960 and became a big hit, Kubota said.
   He said Takara had been planning to eliminate the doll for some
time but didn't have a hit product to replace it with. That changed
with the recent worldwide success of its ``Flower Rock'' toys,
Kubota said.
   The toy consists of a fake flower that wears sunglasses and moves
in its pot when music is played nearby. The new toy has been popular
among adults as well as children, Kubota said.
   The mass-circulation newspaper Mainichi Shimbun said Takara
apparently was concerned that criticism of the black doll in the
United States might hurt ``Flower Rock'' sales.
   In August 1988, U.S. Congressional Black Caucus criticized Japan
for mannequins and dolls which the caucus said stereotyped and
degraded blacks by exaggerating their physical features.
   A department store in Tokyo removed two black mannequins with
distorted features, including huge lips, and Sanrio, a major gift
manufacturer, stopped producing three dolls with black features.
   In October, Kanebo Ltd. stopped making a brand of chewing gum
bearing a face with big round eyes and big lips after receiving a
protest from the African National Congress, an anti-apartheid group.
   In January, a Japanese publisher said it would no longer publish
``Little Black Sambo'' books, one of the best-selling children's
books in Japan for more than 30 years, because of racist
connotations.
   Japan has only about 50,000 non-Asian foreign residents among its
120 million population.
   Government officials, particularly before World War II,
frequently emphasized the country's unity and relative racial purity.

<HEAD>July Soybeans Plummet In Contract's Final Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with the
contract for July delivery of soybeans plummeting on its final day
of trading.
   The July soybean contract, which is at the center of a dispute
over a possible market-cornering attempt _ was off 35{ cents at
$6.92 a bushel in the first hour of trading. The contract expires at
noon Central time.
   Analysts said thin trading conditions have made the July contract
extremely volatile. Traders have been exiting the July soybean
market since July 12, following the Board of Trade's emergency order
requiring them to limit their holdings in the July contract.
   Some said it appeared that the Italian grain concern Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A., the reputed target of the exchange's unusual
order, was switching its large position in the July contract into
the August contract, possibly setting up another confrontation with
the exchange.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if that were probably the case but I
have no knowledge that that is the case,'' said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.87} a bushel; corn was { cent to
2} cents lower with July at $2.52 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 4{
cents lower with July at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to
35{ cents lower with July at $6.92 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .08 cent higher with August at
72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchnaged to .23 cent higher
with August at 83.95 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .42 cent
higher with July at 48.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.50 cent to 1.20 cents higher with July at 30.05 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Wednesday while pork futures were

release, reports of Eastern considering sale of Latin American routes.

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge today approved the
release of $75 million cash from escrow to Eastern Airlines, which
the strikebound carrier's creditors indicated should help meet the
company's financial needs through the end of the quarter.
   The Miami-based airline initially had asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland for the release of $100 million from its
creditors, while a committee representing Eastern creditors asked
for only $40 million to be released.
   However, the parties agreed to the $75 million figure and the
judge approved it, with the understanding Eastern could request
additional funds in the future.
   Eastern was expected to file a plan for reorganizing with the
bankruptcy court by the end of the week.
   Separately, published reports indicated Eastern was prepared to
sell Latin American routes and most of its terminal space to
American Airlines because of continuing difficulties in contract
negotiations with its striking pilots' union.
   A memo from Eastern senior vice president Tom Matthews to the Air
Line Pilots Association said the route sale idea would be scrapped
if the company reached a contract agreement with the pilots,
according to today's editions of The Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale
and The Miami Herald.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the company would not
comment on the report. Al Becker, spokesman for American, said the
Dallas-based airline has ``done no deals with Eastern,'' but added:
``We are an acquirer. If any airline has assets it wants to sell,
we'll look at them.''
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp., and
Eastern President Phil Bakes said in Atlanta on Wednesday that
Eastern's rebuilding is moving along well. They said a measure of
their confidence was evident in their announcement of the aircraft
purchase.
   Under the plan, Texas Air will acquire $2.8 billion worth of
Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The order includes 50 firm purchases and
options to buy 50 more of the jets.
   Sixty of the jets were earmarked for Continental Airlines,
another Texas Air subsidiary, and 40 for Eastern. Lorenzo also
announced a number of other aircraft transactions involving
Continental and Eastern.
   He said the transactions demonstrate confidence that Eastern will
be a thriving operation in the 1990s. The company is in the midst of
a rebuilding program launched during the 4-month-old strike by
Eastern's Machinists union members, pilots and flight attendants.
   ``We've arrived at the point where we're able to make a major
acquisition of this type,'' Lorenzo said.
   However, Ron Cole, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots
Association, called the aircraft purchase a ``joke.''
   ``It's nothing but a stunt to draw attention away from the fact
that Eastern is falling apart,'' Cole said from Tampa, Fla.
   Lorenzo and Bakes announced the aircraft purchase at a news
conference at a downtown Atlanta hotel. On the street outside, about
20 strikers picketed in protest of Lorenzo.
   The two Eastern officials acknowledged that the August expansion
of Eastern's flight schedule will not be as big as originally
announced. But they maintained that the smaller expansion is not a
sign that the rebuilding program is failing.
   Bakes said too much attention is being paid to the actual number
of flights Eastern will have in its August expansion.
   The airline originally promised to have 390 flights a day by Aug.
1, but it said this week some reductions may be necessary. Before
the strike March 4, Eastern had about 1,100 daily flights. It now
has 220.
   Bakes refused to say exactly how many flights will be on the
schedule in August. But, he said, the airline is refusing to take
bookings on flights for which crew training is incomplete.
   Bakes said the company has made progress in revenue, hours flown
and passengers carried. He insisted that Eastern has enough money
from the sale of assets to persevere through the rebuilding period,
though he would not respond when asked how much money the airline
was losing each day.
   The appearance by Lorenzo and Bakes in Atlanta followed reports
that negotiations between the company and the pilots union had
broken down. The officials refused to discuss specifics of the talks
but said they were not making progress.
   ``I can't be here bubbling with optimism about where they (the
talks) are going,'' Lorenzo said.
   Lorenzo also dismissed a plan by Chicago businessman Joseph
Ritchie to buy Eastern as a ``public relations attempt.''
   Ritchie, who has been trying to buy Eastern in alliance with its
unions, said Tuesday he is close to securing a ``highly confident''
letter from his financial adviser, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. In
the letter, Shearson says it would agree to raise $280 million in
debt financing for the Eastern bid, Ritchie told The Wall Street
Journal.
   Ritchie, owner of a commodities trading firm, also said he has
been talking with the AFL-CIO about an additional $200 million for
an employee stock ownership plan.

<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Corp. Thursday reported a 15
percent gain in second-quarter earnings from operations it still
owns, but a 1 percent drop when including its discontinued refining
interests.
   The company said favorable tax claims and more carloads of
higher-priced commodities helped offset a rise in fuel prices and a
slowdown in grain and aggregate carloads for its Omaha, Neb.-based
railroad.
   The company reported earnings of $152 million, or $1.41 per
share, on revenue of $1.6 billion for the quarter, compared to
income of $153.6 million, or $1.35 per share, on sales of $1.5
billion a year ago.
   Income from continuing operations a year ago totaled $131.7
million, or $1.15 per share.
   For the first half of this year, the company reported a profit on
continuing operations of $290.3 million, or $2.63 a share, on
revenue of $3.2 billion, up 11 percent from last year's $262.6
million, or $2.30 a share, but down slightly from $291.4 million, or
$2.56 a share, including the spun off operations.

   Investors who believed they could get rich
selling T-shirts and bumper stickers were bilked of up to $30
million by the company that made the printing equipment, the Federal
Trade Commission said.
   The Case Equipment Co. was ordered to temporarily stop making
promises about its ``sublicolor'' system, which actually consists of
old-fashioned mimeograph machines that were sold for $10,000 each.
   A federal judge also ordered Case Equipment's assets frozen while
the FTC tries to recoup money believed to have been lost by people
from all 50 states and Canada.
   The company's scam cheated ``somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000
people, multiplied by a minimum of $10,000 each,'' said FTC attorney
Sara Greenberg. ``We estimated up to $30 million in court papers.''
   Case Equipment's owner, Anthony J. Casella, said this morning
that his equipment works as advertised. He said customers who made
no money using it probably were just not cut out to be in business
for themselves. Casella said he had sold about 3,800 of the machines.
   ``We sell to an awful lot of people who have never been in
business before, and they think the equipment is going to make them
a millionaire, and that's not true,'' Casella told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview. ``People make themselves
millionaires.''
   The FTC last week asked U.S. District Judge Gene Carter to issue
a temporary restraining order against Case Equipment.
   Ms. Greenberg said from her Boston office that FTC lawyers plan
to return to U.S. District Court on Friday to seek a preliminary
injunction that would halt the allegedly fraudulent sales until the
FTC's civil lawsuit against the company is resolved.
   ``It's OK if he sells the equipment,'' she said. ``He just has to
tell the truth about it. We're seeking restitution for customers,
which is plenty. There's your $20 million to $30 million.''
   Case Equipment is also named in a separate lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in which customers from several states say they were
bilked. They are asking for compensatory and punitive damages.
   Case Equipment has operated in Turner since 1984. Prior to that
Casella, also known as A.J. Casella and A.J. Case, abandoned a
similar operation in Massachusetts when that state's attorney
general's office began investigating complaints, Ms. Greenberg said.
   She said potential investors were lured to Case Equipment by
national magazine advertisements, flown into Portland International
Jetport and picked up in limousines that took them to Case
Equipment's showroom in Turner.
   They were shown impressive samples of printing and given a sales
pitch that said making money with the ``sublicolor'' system would be
easy, and that Case Equipment had service centers around the country
and long lists of potential customers, Ms. Greenberg said. The
customers' living expenses were paid during their visits.
   ``It's a wine 'em and dine 'em sort of operation, and the people
are impressed,'' Ms. Greenberg said. ``Even people who had some
knowledge of the printing industry were taken in. They have told
customers stories about how a 15-year-old could use it. They said
anyone can use it.''
   But once people bought the Case Equipment machinery, they were
ignored and given little training in using it, FTC documents say.
The machinery could not be operated by untrained workers and
produced sloppy printing without regular maintenance, the FTC said.
   The company falsely claimed to have service centers all over the
nation, when it had none, the FTC said.
   ``Consumers not only lose their initial $10,000-plus investment,
they spend significant additional sums and valuable time in vain
trying to get the equipment to function,'' the FTC said.
   The commission accuses Case Equipment of cheating ``mostly
working people looking to start or expand their own small business
ventures. However, the only ones to profit have been Case and
Casella.''
   Casella said the companies that make and distribute his equipment
provide numerous service centers. He said his company provides food
and lodging to potential customers to make sure they come see what
they are buying. He said he insists buyers attend training sessions
and sign a form saying they are trained in the use of the sublicolor
and satisfied with its performance.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Fed Been Pushing Down Interest Rates</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs of administration testimony after 5th graf,
The Fed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today the central bank has been pushing down interest rates in an
effort to keep the country out of a recession and acknowledged the
Fed's best efforts might not be enough.
   After a year of raising interest rates to dampen inflationary
pressures, Greenspan said, the Fed switched course in June and began
lowering rates because of widespread signs of a weakening economy.
   Greenspan, making his midyear report to Congress, indicated that
the Fed stood ready to lower rates further, but he said its best
efforts might not be enough to stave off an economic downturn.
   ``Some day, some event will end the extraordinary string of
economic advances that has prevailed since late 1982,'' Greenspan
said in testimony before a House banking subcommittee.
   The Fed chairman said it was entirely possible that some Federal
Reserve policy mistake could trigger a new recession despite the
agency's best efforts to keep the current record peacetime recovery
going.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, the Bush administration praised the
Fed's efforts to drive down interest rates.
   Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser, told the
Joint Economic Committee that the central bank had acted prudently
and had avoided ``any major policy mistakes.''
   He declined to say whether it should lower interest rates further
to avoid a recession, saying, ``I don't like to preach to the Fed in
public.''
   ``The Federal Reserve is committed to doing its utmost to ensure
prosperity and rising standards of living over the long run,''
Greenspan said. ``We do, however, face a difficult balancing act.''
   Greenspan said the Fed must weigh the dangers of a recession
against the risk that too loose a monetary policy could spark a new
inflationary spiral in the country.
   Greenspan said the Fed's policies would be oriented toward
avoiding ``an unnecessary and destructive recession.''
   The Fed chairman's comments indicated that the central bank was
likely to continue its policy of gradually lowering interest rates
over the coming months. Greenspan said the Fed first began easing
credit conditions in early June and eased again in early July.
   Greenspan's remarks were the first official indication that the
central bank had indeed reversed its year-long tightening efforts,
although there was a widespread belief in financial markets that
this was occurring.
   Greenspan released a revised economic forecast which showed that
the central bank still hopes to achieve a so-called soft landing in
which growth will slow enough to cool inflationary pressures but not
decline so much that the country is thrown into a recession.
   The Fed forecast that the overall economy would grow at an annual
rate of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. This was lower than the
administration's revised forecast on Tuesday that the economy would
grow at a 2.7 percent rate this year.
   The Congressional Budget Office today forecast a 2.4 percent rate
of growth this year, slowing to 2 percent in 1990.
   The Fed saw more dangers from higher inflation, forecasting that
consumer prices would rise by between 5 percent and 5.5 percent this
year, up from last year's 4.4 percent increase.
   The administration is less concerned about an uptick in
inflation, forecasting that consumer prices would rise 4.9 percent
this year.
   The CBO estimated consumer price inflation and interest rates
will be about half a percentage point higher both this year and in
1989 than the administration forecast Tuesday.
   It predicted civilian unemployment will rise from its current 5.3
percent to average 5.5 percent in 1990.
   ``The recent slowing in economic growth will not go so far as to
turn into a recession during the next several months,'' CBO Director
Robert Reischauer told the House Budget Committee.
   Reischauer estimated the chances of the economy slipping into a
recession during the next nine months was ``in the 15 percent to 40
percent range.''
   In setting preliminary monetary growth targets, Greenspan said
the Fed had decided to leave the growth rates unchanged for this
year and next year as well.
   For M-2, the measure of the money supply which includes currency
in circulation and interest-bearing checking accounts, the Fed said
it would aim for an increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent both
this year and in 1990.
   The central bank is charged with the primary task of guarding
against inflation by controlling how fast the money supply
increases. The goal is to supply enough money to support healthy
growth while making sure that inflation is not re-ignited by pumping
too much money into the system.
   The Fed's actions influence the cost of money _ interest rates.
   With the decision in early June to ease credit conditions, a
variety of business and consumer interest rates have been falling
and economists are predicting that the current Fed easing course
will mean further declines in banks' prime lending rate and in
mortgage rates over the next several months.
   Recent inflation figures look favorable. On Wednesday, the
government reported consumer prices edged up just 0.2 percent in
June, the smallest advance in 16 months. That followed news last
week that prices at the wholesale level actually fell last month.
   Before the June slowdown, consumer prices were shooting up at the
fastest pace since 1982. But economists believe the worst is now
over for energy price increases, caused by the clampdown on
production by oil exporting countries, and in food costs, which were
driven up by last summer's drought.

<HEAD>Allied-Signal Reports Rise in Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allied-Signal Inc. reported a 30
percent rise in second-quarter earnings, reflecting strength in the
company's aerospace sector.
   For the three-month period ended June 30, the advanced technology
company said its net income totaled $166 million, or $1.11 per
share, compared with $128 million, or 85 cents a share, in the same
1988 period.
   Included in 1989 second-quarter results was a one-time gain of
$23 million, or 16 cents a share, stemming from an insurance
settlement awarded to Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, Inc. in which
Allied has a 40 percent equity interest.
   Excluding the one-time gain, Allied-Signal's net income for the
quarter was $143 million, or 95 cents a share, up 12 percent.
   Sales for the second quarter edged up to $3.1 billion from $3
billion in the 1988 period, Allied said.
   Edward L. Hennessy Jr., Allied-Signal chairman, said the
company's strong performance was aided by the improved showing of
the company's operating units, particularly its aerospace sector.
   ``Earnings are expected to remain strong through the second half
of 1989 as we continue to concentrate on improving our operating
performance,'' Hennessy said.
   Allied-Signal is an advanced technology company with businesses
in aerospace, automotive products and engineered material.
   For the first half of 1989, the company's earnings grew 22
percent to $292 million, or $1.96 a share, compared with $240
million, or $1.60 a share, in the first half of 1988.
   Revenue in the first half totaled $6.06 billion, nearly unchanged
from $6.04 billion in the year-earlier period.

   Record second-quarter sales boosted
quarterly earnings 16.7 percent at Dow Chemical Co., the company
said Thursday.
   Dow said after-tax income rose to $728 million, or $4.04 a share,
from $624 million, or $3.29 a share, in 1988's second quarter.
   Sales grew to $4.60 billion for the three months ended June 30,
the highest ever for a quarter, up about 8 percent from $4.25
billion in the second quarter of last year.
   The previous record for quarterly sales was $4.49 billion in the
first quarter of 1989.
   Dow said its sales of chemicals, plastics and other items
increased 11 percent in Europe, 9 percent in the United States and 4
percent in the rest of the world.
   For the first six months of the year, the Midland, Mich.-based
chemicals company reported income of $1.47 billion, or $8.12 a
share, on sales of $9.09 billion, up from $1.14 billion, or $5.96 a
share, on sales of $8.23 billion in the first half of 1988.
   Dow reported increases in all business segments including
chemicals, plastics, consumer specialties such as Ziploc plastic
bags and performance products such as plastic-lined pipe and
absorbent material for diapers.

<HEAD>Textron Earnings Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Corp. said Thursday its
second-quarter earnings declined nearly 14 percent, reflecting an
arbitrator's decision that Textron owed money to Iran and because of
weakness in its aerospace division.
   The diversified company said it had income of $59.3 million, or
67 cents per share, compared with $68.9 million, or 78 cents per
share, in the 1988 quarter. Revenue was $1.85 billion, compared with
$1.79 billion a year earlier.
   Earnings were depressed by an arbitrator's ruling that Textron
owed Iran $9.5 million under an agreement to jointly produce
helicopters, said company spokesman Raymond W. Caine Jr.
   Iran had paid for materials in 1978, but they had not been
shipped before Textron was prohibited by the U.S. government from
providing any further supplies to Iran, he said.
   The aerospace division's earnings decreased nearly $2.5 million,
primarily because of increased costs on fixed-price development
programs for the V-22 Osprey and on some rocket and smart-bomb
systems, Caine said. That was offset by an increase of almost $10
million in earnings for financial services.
   Textron also recorded a $14 million increase in interest expense,
mostly from its acquisition of Avdel PLC, a British fastener
manufacturer. Textron has been unable to complete the acquisition
and absorb the earnings, however, because of Federal Trade
Commission opposition.
   Textron has interests in a number of industries including
aerospace technology, commercial products and financial services.

unnecessary and destructive recession.''
   However, he also noted that inflation remained clearly above
where the Fed would like to see it.

growth.

<HEAD>Earnings of Nation's Big Three Likely To Fall Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Big Three automakers' earnings roll is slowing
down.
   After setting earnings records in three of the last four
quarters, analysts expect General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. will announce second-quarter earnings slightly lower
than a year ago, reflecting a softening U.S. car and truck market.
   But, they add, it's no time to panic.
   ``I don't think there's that much importance that's going to be
placed on earnings comparisons with last year,'' said auto analyst
Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York.
   ``Earnings last year were exceptionally strong, and this year all
we've heard about is weakness,'' he said.
   The Big Three's roll of quarterly earnings records began in the
second quarter last year when the companies reported earnings of
$3.49 billion, or $7.14 a share. That was followed by a record
third-quarter report of $1.83 billion and a record fourth quarter in
which the companies made $3 billion.
   The Big Three earned $3.54 billion in the first quarter of this
year, second only to the record of $3.87 billion posted in the first
quarter of 1984.
   GM and Ford tentatively have scheduled their earnings reports for
the middle of next week and Chrysler's is due July 31.
   Surveys of analysts' predictions show GM will report
second-quarter earnings around $2.17 a share, Ford will show a
per-share profit of about $3.10, and Chrysler will have a profit of
$1.50 a share.
   Those estimates compare with second-quarter, per-share earnings
last year of $2.26 for GM, $3.43 for Ford and $1.45 for Chrysler.
   The industry began to soften early this year. Car and truck sales
for the Big Three during the first half of the year were down 6.5
percent from last year.
   ``What's more important is the level of profitability the Big
Three will demonstrate given this weak setting,'' Brady said.
   Some observers say the market is saturated by the 80 million or
so new cars that have been sold during the last five years.
   The automobile industry also has been hit by expectations of
slower economic growth, fluctuations in interest rates and consumer
indifference to recent sales incentives.
   That compares robust sales in the industry and a more stable
overall economy at the same time last year. Incentives a year ago
also sparked consumer demand, making it easier for automakers to get
rid of inventories that can drag down earnings.
   Incentives, though, can be a wild card in an automaker's earnings
since they come directly out of profits. If not careful, an
automaker can find itself in a vicious circle.
   Higher sales increase profits while incentives lower them. In an
effort to boost sales, the companies have increased incentives, and
that's costly.
   Analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York
estimated that the Big Three spent about $600 per car in incentives
during the first quarter and boosted that to $800 to $850 per car in
the second quarter.
   ``I think the crunch time is coming,'' he said.
   Analyst Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of San
Francisco said the Big Three are facing a twofold problem.
   ``The primary problem is unprecedented incentives compounded by
the recent strength in the dollar which has improved import
competitiveness and reduced the dollar value of overseas earnings,''
he said.
   The profits that GM and Ford have posted in recent quarters have
been buoyed strongly by their European automotive operations. While
they've made money in North America recently, earnings have been
stronger in Europe.
   European income has little effect on earnings of the much-smaller
Chrysler.
   While the Big Three are likely to report slightly lower earnings
in the second quarter, some analysts said the financial community is
looking more toward the third-quarter results, which will be
reported in October.
   ``In general, my sense is there are going to be a lot of earnings
cuts coming after the release of these (second-quarter) numbers,''
Kirnan said.
   ``I think a lot of people have delayed making major adjustments
in their earnings estimates because they want to see how things
fared in the second quarter _ how heavy were the incentive costs.''

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Close Higher, Corn and Soybeans Dip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices closed higher while corn and
soybean futures finished mostly lower Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, where attention was focused on the expiration of the July
soybean contract.
   Trading in soybeans for July delivery ended at 12:01 p.m. central
time after a spurt of selling that pushed the contract's price down
to $6.88{ a bushel, 39 cents below Wednesday's settlement price.
   Analysts said thin trading conditions made the July soybean
contract extremely volatile. Traders had been exiting that market
since July 11, when the Board of Trade issued an emergency order
requiring them to limit their holdings in the July contract.
   Some said it appeared that the Italian grain concern Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A., the reputed target of the exchange's unusual
order, had switched its large July position into the August
contract, possibly setting up another confrontation with the
exchange.
   Trading companies believed to be representing Ferruzzi were large
sellers in the minutes before the July contract expired, traders
said.
   The wheat market gained support from expectations of new export
business and perceptions that the market has reached its seasonal
bottom, said Katharina Zimmer, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.
   The corn and soybean markets were pressured by rain in the
Midwest in addition to the pronounced weakness in the expiring July
contracts.

<HEAD>Schlumberger Reports Decline In Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schlumberger Ltd. said Thursday its
second-quarter profit declined 12 percent in the second quarter,
partly reflecting a decline in oil rig activity and oil-price
uncertainty.
   For the three months ended June 30, the oil exploration company
had after-tax earnings of $127 million, or 53 cents a share, down
from $144 million, or 53 cents a share, in the 1988 period.
   Operating revenue totaled $1.20 billion, down 5 percent from
$1.26 billion in the comparable 1988 period.
   Schlumberger Chairman Evan Baird said earnings-per-share
remained unchanged in the quarter because of fewer shares
outstanding as a result of the company buying 34.5 million shares
in 1988 for $1.2 billion.
   The quarterly results included one-time gains of $13 million, or
5 cents a share, from the sale of Schlumberger's Defense Systems
businesses and $22 million, or 9 cents a share, from an award by
the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal.
   In the previous year, the compnay has a one-time $35 million
increase in from the sale of a division.
   The company's oil field services revenue was 3 percent lower as
crude prices continued to decline from April levels.
   For the first six months of the year, the New York-based energy
concern had net income of $209 million, or 88 cents a share, down
14.7 percent from $245 million, or 90 cents a share, in the 1988
period. Operating revenue was $2.4 billion, down 5 percent from
$2.5 billion in the same year-ago period.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission said
Thursday it has approved a $25.5 million sale of New York talk
radio station WOR-AM to Buckley-WOR Broadcasting Corp.
   Under the FCC-approved settlement, the seller, RKO General Inc.,
would receive only 65 percent of the proceeds, with the remainder
going to six other applicants who had challenged the fitness of RKO
and its parent, GenCorp. of Fairlawn, Ohio, to hold the WOR license.
   The other applicants were: South Jersey Radio Inc. of Atlantic
City, N.J.; Freedom Broadcasting Corp. of Riverside, R.I.; Women
Owning Radio Inc., whose principals include broadcaster Gail Trell
Barker and TV-radio personality Arlene Francis; COZZIN
Communications Corp. of Cleveland, which numbers comedian-actor
Bill Cosby among its stockholders; S-G Communications of Atlanta;
and Magna Media Corp.
   The FCC, in a 2-1 decision on July 14 that was released
Thursday, said RKO's license renewal application would be dismissed
and RKO will transfer the station to S-G Communications. S-G will
transfer the license to an RKO subsidiary, GRADH-107, which in turn
will transfer the license to Buckley upon consummation of the
settlement.
   The Greenwich, Conn.-based Buckley will pay RKO $24 million, of
which RKO will pay $7.425 million to the other applicants. Buckley
also will pay $1.5 million, in addition to the $24 million,
directly to principals of the competing applicants.
   The FCC said ``RKO's receipt of less than full market value for
the station would serve as an effective deterrent against license
misconduct.''
   The sale was the latest step in the FCC-ordered dismantling of
the RKO network, which began in the 1960s when challenges were
filed to RKO's fitness to operate its stations.
   In a 1980 ruling that stripped RKO of one TV license, the FCC
noted that GenCorp, the former General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., had been
accused of improper domestic political contributions and of bribery
overseas.
   The FCC has approved similar sales agreements for WOR's sister
station, WRKS-FM, for $50 million; KHJ-TV and KRTH-AM-FM, Los
Angeles, $320 million and $86.6 million, respectively; plus
WHBQ-AM, Memphis; WGMS-AM, Bethesda, Md.; WGMS-FM, Washington; and
WRKO-AM-FM, Boston.

Gains</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: UPDATES thruout with American Brands results.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bristol-Myers Co. and Colgate-Palmolive Co. Thursday reported
they had double-digit income growth in the second quarter despite
suffering adverse consequences from the dollar's strength.
   American Brands Inc., meanwhile, reported its net income fell 22
percent despite a strong performance by its tobacco units.
   Bristol-Myers, maker of medicines, toiletries and household
products, posted an 11.6 percent profit increase in the quarter
ended June 30. After-tax income rose to $212.51 million, or 74
cents a share, from $190.48 million, or 66 cents a shares, in
1988's second quarter.
   Sales came to $1.53 billion vs. last year's $1.46 billion, an
increase of about 5 percent.
   Colgate-Palmolive, a major manufacturer of consumer products
ranging from soap to pet food, said its second-quarter net income
increased 12.4 percent to $73.6 million, or $1.06 a share, from
$65.5 million, or 96 cents a share, in the second 1988 quarter.
Sales rose about 9 percent to $1.29 billion from $1.19 billion.
   American Brands, whose products include Lucky Strike cigarettes
and Jim Beam alcoholic beverages, said its profit sank to $120.2
million, or $1.25 a share, from $154.7 million, or $1.57 a share,
in the year-ago quarter. Revenue edged up 0.1 percent to $2.722
billion, from $2.718 billion.
   American Brands, based in Greenwich, Conn., said its 1988
results included a $46 million gain from discontinued operations.
   Richard L. Gelb, Bristol-Myers' chairman, said international
sales edged up just 1 percent while, domestically, sales were up 7
percent. Changes in the dollar's value against other major
currencies during the quarter cut international sales by an
estimated 6 percent, Gelb said.
   For the first half of the year, Bristol-Myers earned $449.6
million, or $1.56 a share, up 12.1 percent from $401.1 million, or
$1.39 a share, a year earlier. Sales amounted to $3.14 billion, up
about 5 percent from $2.98 billion in the first six months of 1988.
   Reuben Mark, Colgate-Palmolive's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said the financial improvement reflected
continuing momentum in international operations and the Hill's Pet
Products division.
   The second-quarter earning included $6.5 million, or 9 cents a
share, from the sale of land in England. This real estate gain
partially offsetthe negative impact of a higher dollar.
   Colgate-Palmolive said in a news release that the dollar's
strength, combined with economic difficulties in Venezuela and
currency translation losses in other hyperinflationary countries,
reduced second-quarter income by about $13 million, after taxes.
   For the first six months of this year, Colgate-Palmolive earned
$140.8 million, or $2.04 a share, up 7.6 percent from $130.9
million, or $1.91 a share, in the first half of 1988. Sales grew
about 7 percent to $2.5 billion from $2.3 billion.
   Both Colgate-Palmolive and Bristol-Myers have their corporate
headquarters in New York.
   Some of Colgate-Palmolive's well-known brands include Ajax
cleanser, Fab laundry detergent and Irish Spring soap.
   Among Bristol-Myers' brands are Bufferin and Excedrin pain
relievers, Windex window cleaner and Drano drain de-clogger.
   For the first half of 1989, American Brands had net income of
$292.4 million, or $3.05 a share, down 4 percent from $305.2
million, or $2.97 a share, in the comparable 1988 period.
   Revenue in the fist six months was $5.97 billion, up 2 percent
from $5.8 billion in 1988.
   William J. Alley, American Brands chairman, said tobacco
operations were strong both at home and abroad despite a strong
dollar, which makes U.S. products more expensive overseas.
   Domestically, American Tobacco Co. had record results in the
quarter with operating income up 5 percent to $131 million.
International operating income rose 46 percent to $63 million.
   It said its Jim Beam brands of liquor had record profits of $22
million, up 8 percent for the quarter.
   American Brands' products include Carlton, Lucky Strike and Pall
Mall cigarettes; Jim Beam bourbon and Gilbey's gin; Master Lockand
other hardware; life insurance, housewares and sports products.

   BankAmerica Corp.'s turnaround continued in the second quarter
as earnings jumped 88 percent over the same 1988 period, the
company said Thursday. Bank of Boston Corp. also reported a profit
rise.
   The parent of Bank of America, the nation's second-largest bank,
reported net income of $304 million, or $1.50 a share, in the
quarter ending June 30, up from $162 million, or 85 cents a share,
in the same period last year.
   BankAmerica Chairman A.W. Clausen said in a statement the
results reflected strength in key areas, including expansion of
domestic loans and deposits, particularly in consumer loan and
mortgage portfolios.
   Earnings for the first six months of 1989 were $579 million, or
$2.88 per common share, up 114 percent from $271 million, or $1.41
per common share, in the same period last year.
   Two years ago, San Francisco-based BankAmerica lost $955 million
but bounced back in 1988 to report $726 million profit.
   BankAmerica's net interest income for the second quarter totaled
$1.03 billion, up from $806 million in the same 1988 period.
Non-interest income rose slightly, to $453 million from $448
million.
   Bank of Boston said its second-quarter profit rose 29 percent to
$98 million from $76 million in the same 1988 period. Per-share
profit increased to $1.34 from $1.10.
   For the first half of 1989, Bank of Boston reported net income
of $187 million, or $2.57 a share, up 17 percent from $160 million,
or $2.34 a share, a year ago.
   Bank of Boston Chairman Ira Stepanian said the quarterly rise
came ``despite the impact of higher levels nonperforming assets.''
The bank's domestic nonperforming assets in real estate rose by
about $195 million because of weakening in the industry.
   The bank also reported a $2.6 million loss from trading profits
and commissions, compared with profits of $1.5 million in the
second quarter last year.
   H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., parent of Home Savings of America, reported
second- quarter earnings of $39.6 million, or 40 cents a share, an
18.9 percent drop from $48.8 million, or 49 cents a share in the
same 1988 quarter.
   Los Angeles-based H.F. Ahmanson attributed the decline a sharp
drop in net gains from loan sales, to $750,000 from $9 million in
the second quarter last year.

   The stock market turned downward today, yielding
to a late wave of selling that wiped out earlier gains.
   Analysts said traders were generally encouraged by the testimony
today of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
before the House Banking Committee on the Fed's credit policies.
   Greenspan said the central bank had taken note of a slowing in
the pace of economic activity, and was seeking to avoid ``an
unnecessary and destructive recession.''
   However, he also noted that inflation remained clearly above
where the Fed would like to see it.
   Brokers said Greenspan's comments squared with the recent belief
that the Fed was proceeding gradually to try to steer the economy
toward a ``soft landing'' that could set the stage for renewed
growth.

<HEAD>Quarterly Net Drops Nearly 5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PPG Industries Inc. said Thursday weakness in
its glass business and unfavorable currency exchange rates led to a
4.8 percent drop in second-quarter profit.
   The company earned $127.3 million, or $1.13 per share, in the
second quarter compared with $133.8 million, or $1.22 per share, a
year earlier.
   Sales for the comparable quarters edged higher by 2.7 percent
from $1.45 billion to $1.49 billion.
   ``Despite the slowing North American economy, we are optimistic
that 1989 will rank among PPG's best years for both sales and
earnings,'' Chairman Vincent A. Sarni said in a statement.
   First-half net earnings totaled $257.1 million, or $2.28 per
share, up 1.9 percent from $252.4 million, or $2.29 per share, a
year earlier.
   Six-month sales rose 4.6 percent from $2.82 billion to $2.95
billion.
   PPG said it benefited in the second quarter from continued
strong sales of fiber glass products and auto replacement glass. It
was hurt, however, by high product development costs and softness
in North American markets.
   New production capacity in the North American and European flat
glass industry lowered sales volumes for some products, PPG said.
   Sales of PPG's paints and other coatings were strong worldwide.
   In its chemicals business, chlor-alkali sales volumes and prices
remained strong, but markets showed weakness for chlorine
derivatives.

<HEAD>Multimedia Reports Higher Earnings in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Multimedia Inc. said Thursday its
second-quarter earnings rose 31 percent, spurred by the success of
television programming such as the Phil Donahue and Sally Jessy
Raphael shows.
   Revenues rose 6 percent overall, including gains in its
newspaper, broadcasting, cable and entertainment divisions, the
company said.
   Multimedia reported earnings of $10.8 million, or 87 cents a
share, on revenues of $121 million for the quarter ending June 30.
During the same period in 1988, the company earned $8.2 million, or
67 cents a share, on revenues of $114.3 million.
   Revenues from the entertainment division rose 21 percent, to
$19.2 million, up from $15.8 million. The three other divisions
each reported revenues increases of less than 10 percent.
   The broadcasting division accounted for $39.5 million of the
company's second-quarter revenues. Newspapers brought in $35
million and cablevision $19.2 million.
   First-half earnings climbed 65 percent from $9.3 million, or 77
cents a share, to $15.4 million, or $1.24 a share. Revenues rose 6
percent in the first six months from $214.3 million to $227.3
million.
   ``The quarter and the first six months were as expected,'' said
Walter E. Bartlett, president and chief executive officer.
``Newspapers were weak in retail advertising. Broadcasting was
good, fortunately, because of our two major NBC properties in St.
Louis and Cincinnati.
   ``Cable was very strong and entertainment was very strong due to
the continued success of Donahue and the expansion of the Sally
Jessy Raphael show to more markets and to an hour in length.''
   The gain in first-half earnings was the result of higher revenue
and less interest payments on a recapitalization project that began
in 1985, Bartlett said in a statement.
   Multimedia is a mediacommunications company that publishes 14
daily and 40 non-daily newspapers. It also owns and operates four
television and seven radio stations, more than 100 cable franchises
in four states and produces and syndicates television programming,
including the Phil Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael shows.

<HEAD>Campeau Says It Has No Acquisitions Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp., a Canadian holding company of real
estate and retail interests in Canada and the United States, plans
to concentrate on its existing businesses and has no acquisition
plans, Campeau's chairman and chief executive said Thursday.
   ``We have no intention of seeking further acquisitions,'' Robert
Campeau said at the annual shareholders' meeting. ``We're going to
keep our noses to the grindstone'' and focus on existing operations.
   Campeau's past acquisition campaign included the hostile $6.7
billion takeover of Federated Departments Stores Inc. last spring.
   Federated, which operates Abraham and Straus, Bloomingdale's,
Burdines and other chain stores, has become part of Campeau's
department stores group.
   Also within the group is Allied Stores Corp., which Campeau
acquired in 1986 for $3.4 billion. Allied operates 130 department
stores in 16 states under the Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Maas-Jordan
Marsh Florida and The Bon Marche names.
   Both Allied and Federated have headquarters in Cincinnati.
   At the meeting in Toronto, Campeau forecast sales for the
current year of about 12.5 billion Canadian dollars, up from about
10.3 billion Canadian dollars in the previous year.
   He didn't present the projection in U.S. dollars even though the
company regularly reports its financial results in U.S. dollars.
   The company's annual report for the year ended Jan. 31, 1989
showed revenue from continuing operations totaled $8.67 billion,
boosted by the acquisition of Federated and Ralphs Grocery Co.,
compared to $3.53 billion in the 13 months ended a year before.
   Campeau did not provide an estimate for this year's earnings at
the meeting.
   The Toronto-based corporation lost $34 million in its past
fiscal year, an improvement from a loss of $196 million in the 13
months ended Jan. 31, 1988.
   In separate remarks, Ronald Tysoe, Campeau's president and chief
operating officer, said Campeau's Canadian division plans to sell
up to 45 properties, producing gross proceeds of about $500
million. The cash proceeds from the sales could come to about $250
million.

<TEXT>
   The government announced plans Thursday
to sell to the public stakes in three state companies, including
the country's leading commercial bank, as part of a long-term
economic liberalization program.
   A government statement said Banco Portugues do Atlantico will
have 49 percent of its capital placed on the market. He said the
state-run cement giant Cimpor and the Centralcer brewery will be
partially privatized.
   Since election in July 1987, Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva
has launched series of free-market measures to relax state control.
   The latest privatization plans follow the successful sale
earlier this month of 49 percent of the government's shares in
Banco Totta e Acores, a leading public bank, and April's partial
privatization of the brewery UNICER.
   Like previous transactions, the sales revealed Thursday will be
limited to 49 percent of company's capital.
   However, government spokesman Fernando Nogueira said new
legislation slated to permit complete privatizations was being
prepared, the Portuguese newsagency Lusa reported.
   The government statement said BPA and Centralcer were likely to
be fully privatized eventually, although the government would
maintain a stake in Cimpor ``due to the nature of its activity and
its importance in the national economy.''

   Gannett Co. said Thursday it will begin
distributing its USA Today newspaper in the Soviet Union within a
month.
   Gannett, publisher of USA Today, said about 200 copies of the
newspaper's international edition will be distributed in Moscow and
Leningrad by Sovaminco, a joint U.S.-Soviet venture.
   The newspaper will cost either $2 or 2 rubles, depending on
which currency a vendor accepts.
   Gannett International President David Mazzarella said the
newspaper initially will be sold in hotels by Sovaminco, which
imports and sells foreign language books and holds licenses to open
bookstores.
   ``We also expect that Sovaminco will make it available through
their own devices to other sales points, meaning to newsstands run
by other people,'' he said.
   Mazzarella said the Soviet venture is designed for American
tourists, business officials and temporary residents, but Gannett
hopes the newspaper also will be read by Soviet citizens.
   ``I would hope there's some interest there on the part of
Soviets in developments in the United States,'' he said. ``Our
target is those who have a strong interest in the United States.''
   About 50,000 copies of USA Today's international newspaper are
distributed in more than 80 countries, he said.
   Gannett said in a statement that it had distributed the
newspaper in China from 1986 but the government cut off supplies
last week.
   Other English-language publications, including the International
Herald Tribune and Time magazine, already are sold in the Soviet
Union.

   A sudden selloff near the close pushed stock
prices lower Thursday, wiping out an early gain that carried the
Dow Jones industrial average briefly past 2,600 for the first time
since the fall of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 30 points at
its midsession peak, closed with an 8.92 loss at 2,575.49.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
646 up, 871 down and 482 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 204.59 million
shares, against 215.74 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 241.87 million shares.
   Analysts said the late decline stemmed in part from selling by
professional traders engaged in computer program strategies
involving options and index futures contracts, some of which expire
after the close on Friday.
   They also said investors seemed to back away from an initially
enthusiastic response to testimony by Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board, before the House Banking Committee on
the Fed's credit policies.
   Greenspan said the central bank had taken note of a slowing in
the pace of economic activity, and was seeking to avoid ``an
unnecessary and destructive recession.''
   However, he also noted that inflation remained clearly above
where the Fed would like to see it.
   Brokers said Greenspan's comments squared with the recent belief
that the Fed was proceeding gradually to try to steer the economy
toward a ``soft landing'' that could set the stage for renewed
growth.
   But they added that his testimony was typically noncommital,
leaving open the question of whether and when the Fed might take
further steps toward easier credit.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph led the active list and rose \ to

<HEAD>Pork Belly Futures Soar On Signs Of Stronger Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork belly futures prices soared Thursday by as much as 2 cents
a pound, the permitted daily limit on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, on signs that lower bacon prices may finally be
stimulating demand for the sizeable supplies of pork bellies in
cold storage.
   Hog futures prices also rose while cattle futures were mixed.
   On other markets, orange juice futures fell sharply for the
fifth straight day; grains and soybeans finished mixed as the July
contracts expired; precious metals erased some of Wednesday's
losses; and energy futures advanced.
   Frozen pork bellies settled 1.53 cents to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in July at 30.55 cents a pound; hogs were
.03 cent lower to .98 cent higher with July at 49 cents a pound;
live cattle were unchanged to .20 cent higher with August at 72.75
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .07 cent higher
with August at 83.72 cents a pound.
   The pork-belly market turned in its strongest performance in
more than six weeks in a delayed reponse to Tuesday's weekly
exchange report on pork-belly stocks in U.S. commercial freezers
outside of Chicago.
   The report showed a net out-movement of nearly 5.4 million
pounds last week compared to 3.9 million pounds for the same period
a year ago.
   Supplies of frozen pork bellies, the part of the pig from which
bacon is made, are at near-record levels. Stocks normally decline
during the summer, due to a seasonal drop in hog slaughters, but
reports since spring have failed to confirm the development of the
trend this year.
   The slack demand has prompted grocers to sharply cut retail
prices for bacon, which has been running 8 percent to 20 percent
below last year for most of the summer, said Tom Morgan, president
of Sterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   ``Maybe we're beginning to see that reflected in the demand,''
he said.
   A monthly Agriculture Department report scheduled for release
after the close on Friday is expected to again show near-record
supplies of frozen bellies nationwide, but Morgan said the
importance of that report to traders has been diminished.
   ``Their views are going to be tempered because of the recent
out-movement'' reported on Tuesday, he said.
   Orange juice futures prices fell the 5-cents-a-pound daily limit
on the New York Cotton Exchange on perceptions that large supplies
of Brazilian juice will soon hit the market.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.25 cents to 5 cents
lower with September at $1.546 a pound.
   Wheat futures prices closed higher while corn and soybean
futures finished mostly lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, where much attention was focused on the expiration of the
July soybean contract.
   Trading in soybeans for July delivery ended at 12:01 p.m.
Central time after a spurt of selling that pushed the contract's
price down to $6.88{ a bushel, 39 cents below Wednesday's
settlement price.
   Analysts said thin trading conditions made the July soybean
contract extremely volatile. Traders had been exiting that market
since July 11, when the Board of Trade issued an emergency order
requiring them to limit their holdings in the July contract.
   July wheat expired } cent higher at $3.90} a bushel; July corn
expired 6} cents lower at $2.47{ a bushel; July oats expired 3
cents lower at $1.43{ a bushel.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 6{ cents higher with September at
$3.97} a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to { cent higher with
September at $2.40 a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3 cents lower
with September at $1.51\ a bushel; soybeans were 6\ cents lower to
4{ cents higher with August at $6.81\ a bushel.
   Gold and silver rebounded on New York's Commodity Exchange in
reaction to a weaker dollar, partially erasing Wednesday's losses.
   Gold settled $2.90 to $3.10 higher with August at $372.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.4 cents to 2.8 cents higher with July at $5.181
a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices advanced on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in a technically inspired rally following a sharp decline
on Wednesday.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 23 cents
higher with August at $19.90 a barrel; heating oil was .98 cent to
1.56 cents higher with August at 51.83 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .89 cent lower to .56 cent higher with August at 53.80

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended July 10, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,119.1 billion from $3,101.6 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,008.0 billion from $3,992.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $778.7 billion from $777.4 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 2.6 percent,
which is below the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 4.3 percent, which is above the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,084.7 billion, a 1.5
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,967.4 billion, up 3.1 percent.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $562 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$530 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $289.6 billion in the two-week period ended
July 12, up from $289.5 billion two weeks earlier.

   Wholesale home heating oil prices rose Thursday
amid expectations of energy supply shortages overseas due to the
labor and ethnic unrest in the Soviet Union. Crude oil and unleaded
gasoline futures were mixed.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, No.2 heating oil for August
delivery rose 1.46 cents to 51.83 cents a gallon, after falling
0.13 cent on Wednesday.
   Contracts for heating oil delivery in more distant months also
posted gains and the September contract rose 1.56 cents, settling
at 52.57 cents a gallon.
   Among other refined products traded on the exchange, the August
contract of unleaded gasoline declined 0.59 cent to 54.10 cents a
gallon, adding to Wednesday's drop of 1.37 cents.
   Other unleaded gasoline contract months settled with moderate
gains and losses, with the September contract falling 0.29 cent to
53.08 cents a gallon.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August delivery settled 5
cents higher at $19.90 per 42-gallon barrel on the last trading day
for that contract. The September contract for the benchmark grade
of U.S. crude oil rose 13 cents to $19.68 a barrel.
   Evan Baron, of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc., said
continuing troubles in the Soviet Union which have disrupted
production in various industries ``is creating tight supplies in
European heating oil markets right now and that, in turn, is
affecting our markets.''
   He said there have been reports that scheduled oil shipments
from the Soviet Union have not moved.
   News that saboteurs in the country's Abkhazia region have
damaged the electric power system added to speculation that the
Soviet Union will need to keep more of its oil at home to
compensate for energy shortages due to strikes at coal mines.

   One man helps run a restaurant on the Jersey
shore after cleaning toilets in jail. Another solicited companies
as a consultant on business ethics. A third maintains a 4.0 grade
point average studying for an MBA at a prison camp.
   A fourth just sold his horse transporting business and the
fifth, serving a six-year prison term, is scheduled to be sentenced
Monday for lying on the witness stand at trial.
   Those are the lives of five former wealthy exectives of Bevill,
Bresler &amp; Schulman Inc., once New Jersey's largest brokerage house.
All have gone to jail for crimes in connection with the April 1985
collapse of the Livingston firm and related entities.
   The collapse has cost customers _ which include more than 75
financial institutions, municipalities and individuals in 20 states
_ more than $100 million.
   Authorities have said the executives siphoned off $15 million
for personal use.
   Half-million-dollar homes, jewelry, boats, investments, furs,
Mercedes-Benz autos belonging to the defendants are long gone now,
seized by trustees overseeing the former firm's assets.
   Robert L. Bevill, 46, was the firm's chairman. He is scheduled
for release July 27 from a federal prison camp at Maxwell Air Force
Base in Montgomery, Ala. Bevill will have served slightly more than
21 months of a sentence that began on Black Monday, the Oct. 19,
1987, stock market crash.
   ``I feel guilty, I feel shameful _ wish I could make it go
away,'' Bevill said in a telephone interview from prison. Bevill's
grade-point average is a perfect 4.0 in business courses from Troy
State University.
   He said he is considering taking a job managing apartment
complexes in Tennessee and Alabama owned by his brother.
   John D. Rooney, the former treasurer at Bevill, Bresler, cleaned
bathrooms at the federal prison in Allenwood, Pa., during his
1{-year prison term. The 43-year-old Rooney called the experience
``very humbling'' in a letter to U.S. District Judge Dickinson R.
Debevoise.
   Several miles from the Monmouth Beach condominium he once owned,
Rooney now works as as a bookkeeper at a restaurant in which his
mother made an investment. He prefers not to discuss his life or
the case in detail.
   ``I feel better about things,'' Rooney said. ``I'm trying to
start my life all over again. It's behind me.''
   He is working on a unique part of the sentence imposed by
Debevoise on the four defendants who pleaded guilty and cooperated
with the government: to read six books about ``suffering and
afflicted'' people and write reports in the form of a syllabus and
description of a possible college course on social ethics.
   Stuart Gottlieb, a former senior vice president at the firm, was
sentenced to nine months in prison. He is trying to parlay the
book-reading assignment into a new business _ using his status as a
white-collar criminal to solicit corporations for a course or
manual on business ethics.
   ``I am now extremely devoted to attempting to prevent others,
because of unethical behaviour, from placing themselves, their
firms or society at large, at risk,'' Gottlieb, 42, says in his
solicitation letter.
   Gottlieb, living in a rented condomimium in Pluckemin, would
only say in an interview, ``It's behind me. It's over.''
   Gottlieb for a time worked at a video rental store, according to
assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Weissman. The store was transferred to
his wife's name, but was padlocked by the Morris County sheriff and
its assets sold at auction March 27 after a video distributor
obtained a judgment for unpaid debts.
   Robert S. Levine, 46, former executive vice president, said he
sold his Jackson horse carrying business in the past several weeks
because ``it just wasn't worthwhile.'' The trustee settlement had
left him and his family about $770,000 in assets. At Allenwood,
where he served three months, Levine washed dishes.
   Gilbert C. Schulman, 42, the firm's former president, was
convicted, sentenced to eight years and had the term reduced to
six. He pleaded guilty to a later charge of giving perjured
testimony. He is to be sentenced by Debevoise on Monday.
   Schulman's later cooperation helped bring about the guilty plea
of Robert A. Rough, a former director of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, to charges of leaking secret interest rate data to the
Bevill, Bresler principals.
   Schulman's wife Marsha said in a letter to Debevoise that she
works 16 hours a day running an excavation and construction
business and cares for the couple's five children.

<HEAD>Eds: Ledes with 13 new grafs to update with Chicago Board of Trade
chairman's testimony, picks up with 7th graf pvs: CFTC Chairwoman ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade took its emergency
action in the soybean futures market last week after federal
regulators took steps against a single concern, the CBOT's chairman
testified Thursday.
   Chairman Karsten Mahlman would not identify the ``major
participant,'' believed to be Italian agribusiness giant Feruzzi
SpA, which took a massive position in July soybean futures.
   Mahlman said the CBOT board voted the emergency order, which
required liquidation of large positions in the July bean futures
market, after determining that only one board member, who was
excused from the meeting and did not vote, owned or controlled
positions in July soybeans.
   ``We hope our strong action in July will not be necessary in
August,'' Mahlman told reporters after testifying before a House
subcommittee.
   Although he conceded, under repeated questioning by Rep. David
R. Nagle, D-Iowa, that several other board members were employed by
companies that controlled or served customers that controlled
soybean positions, Mahlman defended the CBOT's action.
   Outside the hearing room, he said: ``I think we have
dramatically enhanced the credibility of the board.''
   Mahlman said eliminating all board members with employer links
to futures positions would force about one-third of them to resign.
   Mahlman's version of the emergency order differed from that
given by federal regulators earlier this week.
   The hearings are being conducted on proposed legislation that
would tighten anti-fraud rules and also reauthorize the agency that
regulates futures markets, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   In earlier testimony, the head of another Chicago exchange said
Congress should not ban the controversial practice of dual trading
_ where brokers trade for themselves and their customers.
   Critics say dual trading allows brokers to take care of their
own needs first, but banning it outright ``would be dangerous,''
said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's
executive committee.
   Mahlman concurred with that position. In a prepared statement
submitted to the subcommittee, Mahlman, chairman of the world's
oldest and largest futures exchange, also opposed a ban on dual
trading, saying it ``will adversely affect the liquidity of futures
markets, particularly agricultural markets, by increasing the cost
of doing business.''
   The CBOT's emergency order last week, and federal regulators'
reaction to the order was a hot topic during a subcommittee session
on Tuesday.
   CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm exasperated committee members
Tuesday with her cautious answers to questions about the agency's
consulting role in the Chicago soybean situation.
   Ms. Gramm, who also said more study was needed before dual
trading was banned, said her agency was reviewing the CBOT's
emergency order but neither directly approved or disapproved the
action.
   Subcommittee Chairman Glenn English, D-Okla., alluded to his
frustration with the CFTC at the start of the second session when
he said the congressmen present ``want to get complete answers
instead of the ones they got Tuesday.''
   The proposed bill, sponsored by English and the subcommittee's
ranking Republican, E. Thomas Coleman of Missouri, would allow dual
trading in only certain circumstances including futures that have
an average daily trading volume of less than 7,000 contracts.
   But Melamed, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange official, said dual
trading was needed to maintain liquidity when there are few
customer orders. He added that pegging dual trading permissibility
to volume ignores the monthly idiosyncracies of various markets
such as soybeans, cattle, oil or gold.
   On the other hand, Robert D. Josserand, president of the
National Cattlemen's Association, advocated complete elimination of
dual trading to restore public confidence.

<HEAD>Merck Earnings Up 25 Percent, Pfizer Down 36 Percent In 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Merck &amp; Co. Inc. said Thursday its second quarter earnings rose
25 percent over the same period last year, while another drug
maker, Pfizer Inc., posted a 36 percent drop in its second quarter
net income.
   Merck, which is based in Rahway, N.J., posted a profit of $396.6
million, or $1 per share, on sales of $1.6 billion in the three
months ended June 30. That compared with a profit of $316.3
million, or 80 cents a share, on sales of $1.5 billion during the
second quarter last year.
   Increased domestic and international sales of the drugs Mevacor,
Vasotec, Primaxin, Pepcid, Zocor and Prinivil contributed to the
company's strong second quarter showing, Merck said.
   ``Sales outside the United States accounted for 47 percent of
sales for the first six months, compared with 52 percent for the
same period last year,''said Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman
and chief executive officer.
   For the first six months, Merck's net income rose to $737
million, or $1.86 a share, from $587.7 million, or $1.49 a share, a
year earlier. First half revenue rose to $3.2 billion from $2.9
billion during the period.
   Pfizer posted a profit of $135.7 million, or 80 cents a share,
in the second quarter, compared with $213.1 million, or $1.26 per
share, in the second quarter of 1988. Quarterly revenue dipped to
$1.3 billion from $1.34 billion.
   The New York-based company said sales declined in its health
care business, reflecting worldwide sales drops in pharmaceuticals
and hospital products, and agriculture operations. Sales rose for
Pfizer's consumer products and materials science segments.
   Edmund T. Pratt Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the stronger dollar also hurt sales. A stronger
dollar makes U.S. products more expensive overseas.
   For the first six months of 1989, Pfizer had net income of
$376.5 million, or $2.23 per share, down 13 percent from $432.9
million, or $2.57 per share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue
rose to $2.7 billion from $2.6 billion a year earlier.

   MAI Basic Four Inc., spurned in its effort
to buy all of Prime Computer Inc., offered Thursday to purchase
Prime's minicomputer business for $450 million in cash and $150
million of MAI securities.
   Prime Chairman David J. Dunn said its board of directors would
meet to consider the offer.
   MAI stock fell 25 cents to close at $5.75 in consolidated
trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Prime fell 12{
cents a share to $19.
   Minicomputer sales accounted for about a third of Prime's $1.6
billion in revenues last year. The remainder of its sales were from
computer-aided design and manufacturing systems, Unix-based
workstations, service and maintenance, and other operations.
   MAI, a Tustin, Calif., computer maker controlled by investor
Bennett S. LeBow, had pursued Prime for seven months before the
Natick-based company agreed last month to a merger with J.H.
Whitney &amp; Co., a New York City venture capital firm.
   Whitney has offered to pay $21.50 a share in cash for about 79
percent of Prime's common stock and to trade securities with a face
value of $22 for each of the remaining shares. Wall Street analysts
have valued the deal at about $1.25 billion.
   Whitney's offer is scheduled to expire July 27. A spokesman for
the venture capital firm said it still plans to acquire all of
Prime.

<HEAD>Fear Of Deal Unraveling Drives Pennwalt Stock Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fear that Societe Nationale Elf Acquitaine's
offer to buy Pennwalt Corp. for $1.05 billion might unravel drove
Pennwalt's stock down $7 a share to $120.50 Thursday.
   Elf Acquitaine, a French government-controlled energy and
chemical company, said late Wednesday it had extended its
$132-per-share offer for Pennwalt, a Philadelphia-based chemical
company, until Aug. 1 under pressure from the Federal Trade
Commission.
   The FTC, expressing apparent antitrust worries, had threatened
to seek a preliminary injunction to block the deal if Elf did not
extend its offer, the company said.
   ``We felt we had no choice but to agree to extend,'' said Lowell
Williams, an Elf spokesman at the company's U.S. headquarters in
Stamford, Conn.
   The FTC said it was concerned about two chemicals both companies
produced. The companies and analysts said the government probably
was fearful the deal would give Elf too much control of the market
for the chemicals.
   ``I think people are getting nervous the deal is going to get
stopped,'' said Jeffrey Cianci, analyst for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in
New York. ``My gut feeling is the deal will get done in some
modified form.''
   Christopher Willis, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &amp;
Co. in New York, also said he doubts the deal will fall through.
   ``It's in their (Elf's) hand right now. All they have to do is
divest a couple of small businesses,'' he said, referring to Elf's
production of the two chemicals, polyvinylidene fluoride and its
precursor, vinylidene fluoride.
   Polyvinylidene, a plastic resin Pennwalt sells under the brand
name Kynar, is used to coat electrical wires and to line pipes in
chemical plants and as a coating in buildings. Elf makes some
products similar to Kynar.
   Kynar is one of Pennwalt's major products, but the company would
not release sales figures. It is made at plants in Thorofare, N.J.,
and Calvert City, Ky.
   Pennwalt management accepted the offer from Elf Acquitaine in
March. The company, whose majority owner is the French government,
outbid Centaur Partners, a New York investment group that Pennwalt
had spurned.
   Also Thursday, Pennwalt announced its second quarter earnings
were more than double the earnings produced during the same period
last year by divisions that were not sold during the fight with
Centaur.
   Earnings from continuing operations were $20.66 million, or
$2.57 per share, on sales of $148.67 million for the second three
months of the year. During last year's second quarter, the company,
minus the pharmaceutical and industrial equipment divisions that
have since been sold, posted earnings of $10.18 million, or 80
cents per share, on sales of $130.82 million.
   Sue S. Brown, a Pennwalt spokeswoman, said she could not comment
on the earnings report or offer an explanation for the increase in
profits. While fighting off Centaur's takeover bid, Pennwalt bought
back a large chunk of outstanding shares, partially explaining the
increase in earnings per share.
   The discontinued operations represented $2.57 million of last
year's second-quarter earnings.

   The U.S. dollar opened lower against the Japanese
yen Friday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
rose slightly.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 16.62 points, or 0.05
percent, to move to 33,681.49 within the first 15 minutes. The
index's rise followed gains in the last two trading days.
   The dollar opened at 141.60 yen, down 0.63 yen from Thursday's
142.23-yen finish. The currency ended at 141.32 yen in New York
overnight.
   Traders attributed the U.S. currency's lower opening in Tokyo to
its losses in New York following comments by U.S. Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Greenspan acknowledged that ``signs of softness in the economy
have shown up'' and said the Fed must closely monitor the slowing
economy.
   Masafuni Koyama, a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, said, ``The
dollar opened lower following the Greenspan comments, but Japanese
investors are inclined to buy it whenever the currency approaches
the 141-yen mark.''
   Analysts say investors fear a heavy loss for the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party in Sunday's parliamentary election, which is
widely expected, will cause the yen to plunge.
   ``Until the election Sunday, the dollar is unlikely to go lower
than its current level,'' he said, adding that interbank trading
dominated the early morning deals.
   Investors have avoided the yen and bought the dollar ahead of
the election, despite prospects of a slowdown in the U.S. economy
shown in several indicators, including a 0.2 percent rise in the
consumer price index for June.

<HEAD>Admitted Inside Trader Starts Consulting Practice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dennis B. Levine, the admitted inside trader
whose confessions spawned Wall Street's scandals, told a group of
business students Thursday he has started a financial consulting
practice in mergers and acquisitions.
   On other matters, Levine praised the performance of government
investigators as ``phenomenal,'' said the criminal justice system
treated him fairly, criticized the media's portrayal of him as
greedy, and expressed remorse for breaking the law.
   ``In my case, the combination of inexperience, unbridled
ambition, impatience and gross errors of judgment led me to break
the law,'' Levine told about 100 students and faculty at New York
University's business school.
   ``I blame myself and make no excuses and take full
responsibility for my actions,'' he said.
   Levine, 36, who was not paid to speak at NYU, traced his
involvement in a network of securities trading that used illegally
obtained information about pending corporate takeovers to net $11.6
million in illicit profits.
   Levine, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. when
he was charged in May 1986, said his illicit activities included a
network of code names, foreign corporations and overseas bank
accounts.
   ``In a vastly different environment, when I made the decision to
cross the line I didn't think about getting caught,'' he said. ``I
was a wet-behind-the-ears naive rookie who should have known better
but didn't.''
   Answering a student's question, Levine said that since his
parole he has started a financial consulting practice and fought
civil lawsuits he said have sought $1 billion in claims.
   ``I believe as a result of my prosecution and others the insider
trading has declined,'' he said, adding that people who try that
kind of activity today ``are playing Russian roulette.''
   In a plea bargain with prosecutors, Levine pleaded guilty to
four felonies, was fined $362,000 and returned $11.6 million in
illegal profits. He also told the government about Ivan F. Boesky,
the now-imprisoned insider trader who himself made millions of
dollars using information supplied by Levine.
   Levine was paroled last September from a two-year prison term
for securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.

   Federal regulators late Thursday closed the 24
banking branches of Texas American Bancshares Inc. and established
an interim institution to oversee the failed banks until they are
fully acquired by Deposit Guaranty Bank of Dallas.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it will spend $900
million in the bailout. Texas American's 24 banks will open Friday
as branches of Texas American Bridge Bank, a bank created to enact
the takeover, the agency said.
   Depositors, including those with funds that exceed the $100,000
federal insurance limit, will automatically become depositors of
Texas American Bridge Bank.
   The Texas American transaction raises the number of bank
closings in Texas this year to 95 and to 131 nationwide.
   Texas American's insolvency was blamed on loan losses, losses in
intracompany transactions and deterioration of the Texas real
estate market.
   Texas American Bridge Bank will be managed under contract by
Deposit Guaranty. The new bank has total assets of about $4.2
billion and deposits of about $4.1 billion.
   Deposit Guaranty will sell stock and debt instruments to bring
the resulting institution up to required regulatory financial
standards.
   The FDIC set aside $600 million in 1988 to assist Texas
American. The regulator will absorb losses on Texas American's
problem assets, which Deposit Guaranty will manage.
   Officials of both banks and the FDIC scheduled a news conference
in Dallas on Friday to discuss the transaction.
   Deposit Guaranty is a $600-million asset, privately owned bank
that was built on the failures of other institutions. Its chairman,
Ronald Steinhart, in May told The Associated Press he was
interested in Texas American.
   Before the Texas American transaction, Deposit Guaranty had
purchased 13 banks, 11 of them in closed-bank, federally assisted
deals. Even when Deposit Guaranty acquires troubled assets it is
protected from losses by regulators.
   ``We're buying essentially with problems fully reserved, so that
the large proportion of our people can direct their energies to
building a bank and building a customer base,'' Steinhart said in
May.
   Texas American and San Antonio-based National Bancshares Corp.
were targets of an acquisition attempt by Minnesota businessman
Carl Pohlad last year. Under an agreement announced a year ago
Thursday, Pohlad's Minneapolis-based firms would have acquired the
two bank companies with federal assistance of $475 million.
   The deal fell through in October 1988 amid speculation that a
disagreement was fueled by terms granted NCNB Corp. of Charlotte,
N.C., which took over First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas.

   Last-minute changes in the Bush
administration's clean air bill would ease up on requirements to
reduce motor vehicle pollution and let the government push back
cleanup deadlines, according to an administration summary made
available Thursday.
   The changes were made after a June 30 draft became public and
was widely criticized by environmentalists as not living up to what
President Bush promised on June 12.
   The Environmental Protection Agency summary was given to members
of Congress on Thursday, a day before President Bush was to hold a
White House ceremony to formally present the bill to lawmakers.
Members of Congress gave the summary to reporters.
   After studying the summary, the head of an environmental group
coalition, Richard Ayres, said the bill would allow ``chicanery and
fraud'' by industry and permit an EPA administrator so inclined to
wreck the effort to clean the nation's dirty air.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly, however, told reporters
earlier the bill was ``faithful in every respect'' to the program
Bush outlined on June 12 to fix the nation's air pollution problem.
``There are no games,'' he said, indismissing the environmentalist
criticism as ``inevitable pre-positioning'' on the legislation.
   ``Today's draft is far weaker than last month's draft, which was
far weaker than the president's promises,'' said Rep. Henry A.
Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce environment
subcommittee, which will hold the first hearing on Bush's bill
Monday.
   ``It undercuts the clean fuel program, pushes back compliance
deadlines and loosens emissions standards. The bill actually
appears to allow emissions from cars and trucks to increase from
today's levels,'' Waxman said.
   Some of the changes:
   _New buses in cities of more than 1 million population would be
required to use special clean-burning fuels, starting in 1991-1994.
The earlier draft required them in all cities of 250,000 or larger.
The final bill also would permit the EPA to delay the requirement
for two years.
   _The EPA administrator could postpone for two years a clean fuel
program for automobiles that would have to be sold in the nation's
most polluted cities in 1995.
   _The deadline for all cars to meet new emissions standards for
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides was pushed back from 1994 models
to 1995 models.
   _Tougher emissions standards for light trucks could be phased in
from 1993 to 1995 instead of being required by 1993.
   _Criminal penalities against automakers for violating the
anti-pollution standards were dropped.
   In contrast to the environmental groups' vocal comments,
industry has lobbied quietly, telling the administration _ and
repeating to reporters who asked _ that the legislation has become
too strict on business.
   A group of Republicans who appeared with Reilly Thursday praised
the bill, but kept repeating that the legislation wasn't perfect,
lacking tough cleanup timetables.
   ``The package does not pass all the tests,'' said Rep. Sherwood
L. Boehlert, R-N.Y., who added that the bill would have been better
if Bush and Reilly had written it alone.
   The EPA and the Office of Management and Budget reportedly
fought often during the drafting of the bill, according to
government sources who spoke only on condition they not be named.
The sources said the EPA generally took the environmentalists side.
   Rep. Robert Smith, R-N.H., said he would co-sponsor the
legislation, but believed it needed tougher provisions for some
industrial boilers, more incentives for utilities to pursue energy
conservation, more specifics on reducing air toxics emissions and
consideration of tougher provisions to reduce emissions of a
contributor to smog _ nitrogen oxide.
   The environmentalists' criticism has included these points:
sulfur dioxide emissions would be reduced less than originally
indicated in the acid rain section; proposed fleet-wide averaging
for auto emissions would fail to reduce motor vehicle pollution as
promised; and that provisions to reduce toxic chemical emissions
could be undermined by giving too high a priority to industry's
economic considerations.
   Reilly said the bill will be ``faithful in every respect to the
spirit and letter of the promises he (Bush) made,'' adding there
was no ``post-announcement erosion.''
   He contended environmentalists have been ``astonished at the
sweeping breath of the legislation,'' but acknowledged ``they have
their reservations as does everyone else. Some of the groups are
going to advocate more. That's their role. Eventually, the country
is going to unite behind this.''
