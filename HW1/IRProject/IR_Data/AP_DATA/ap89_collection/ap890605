<HEAD>Head of Peronist Party Says Alfonsin Should Step Down Early</HEAD>

   The head of President-elect
Carlos Menem's opposition Peronist Party said Monday that President
Raul Alfonsin should step down before his term ends in December so
Menem can take office early.
   Party president Antonio Cafiero said it was for the good of the
country. Argentina is besieged by economic crisis, political
paralysis and social unrest. Inflation topped 70 percent in May.
Interest rates remain at near record highs. Business is contracting.
   Cafiero said ``the country can't wait until Dec. 10'' for Menem,
winner of May 14 national elections, to assume the presidency.
   Food stores were looted in major Argentine cities last week, and
14 people were killed. The national and provincial governments
expanded programs of public subsidies to ease the situation.
   Aides to Alfonsin and Menem discussed an early transition, but
failed to agree on policies to stabilize the economy. Alfonsin
favors increased tariffs to balance the budget. Menem opposes any
program that would further shrink purchasing power.
   Menem also has insisted that Peronists who won congressional
seats on May 14 take office when he does. With those seats, his
party has working majorities in both houses.
   Menem's public position has been that the decision to shorten
Alfonsin's six-year term ``does not depend on me, but on the
outgoing government.''
   But Cafiero said Menem's decision to announce his Cabinet
appointees ahead of schedule last weekend was an indication that
``he (Menem) feels the conviction that this situation cannot be
prolonged.''
   Seven of eight ministers were named on a bipartisan list that
the financial daily Ambito Financiero called ``almost impeccable.''
   Ricardo Lopez Murphy, a key adviser to Menem's presidential
opponent, Eduardo Angeloz of the governing Radical Civic Union, was
offered the post of Central Bank president. Italo Luder, the
Peronists' presidential candidate in 1983, was named defense
minister.
   Cafiero said on Radio Provincia de Buenos Aires, ``The legal
procedures exist for the anticipated delivery of power.''
   ``I think it might happen between August and October. The dates
Aug. 17 and Oct. 12 should not be discarded.''
   Aug. 17 is the anniversary of the death of Gen. Jose de San
Martin, Argentina's founder. Oct. 12 is the date traditionally used
in Argentina to transfer power from one government to another.
   Last week, the country's biggest labor union, the most
influential business group and a major political party suggested
that Alfonsin step down early. Former President Arturo Frondizi
said he thought Alfonsin should resign immediately.

<HEAD>San Francisco Mayor Signs Domestic Partners Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Francisco became the first city in the
country Monday to grant official public recognition to homosexual
and unmarried heterosexual couples.
   Mayor Art Agnos signed the landmark law, calling it ``one of the
most important milestones in San Francisco's effort to adopt
policies to recognize the diversity of families and to extend to
all people in our city the basic human right to form families of
their choice.''
   The law ``has created a framework that clarifies the serious
nature of family relationships in the lesbian and gay community and
for other couples in committed relationships,'' Agnos said.
   Agnos also appointed a ``Task Force on Family Policy'' to
determine guidelines for allowing unmarried city workers to add
partners, adult children and extended family members to the city's
health plan.
   Though denounced by leaders of the city's powerful Roman
Catholic Church as an attack on marriage and the traditional
family, the new law won the unanimous support of the Board of
Supervisors before going to Agnos for his signature.
   ``This is important legislation because it's a step in helping
our country come to terms with the lives of parts of the American
family that have not always been dealt with, particularly lesbian
and gay couples and particularly in the time of an AIDS epidemic,''
said Harry Britt, president of the Board of Supervisors and author
of the bill.
   Agnos said it would take about two months to set up the
mechanisms and distribute the information to allow unmarried
parters to declare their relationship, either publicly through a
county clerk for $35 or confidentially with a notary public.
   He said the city attorney and the city Human Rights Commission
are developing an informational package that will outline the
rights and responsibilities of the relationships.
   Registering under the law affirms the current city policy of
providing city workers in non-traditional relationships with the
same hospital visitation rights and bereavement and maternity leave
as married city employees.
   To qualify for registration, a city worker must live with and
share basic living expenses with their partner. Registration is
intended only for people who live or work in San Francisco.
   Agnos dismissed worries that the law was an invitation to gay
couples or unmarried heterosexual couples from around the country
to go to San Francisco to legitimize their relationships.
   ``It's an invitation for gays and lesbians and all single people
in this country and in the world to take a lesson from the San
Francisco model once again and take to their own communities the
modern kind of family practices that are outlined here,'' he said.
   Matt Coles, an attorney who drafted the law and previously
helped draft similar laws in other California cities, said San
Francisco's measure differs significantly from those in Berkeley,
Santa Cruz and West Hollywood.
   Those cities, he said, pay health benefits to city workers with
domestic partners.
   ``That's important and that's what the task force is aiming at
here,'' he said. ``But what this legislation does is it recognizes
the existence of non-marital relationships. And it recognizes them
whether you're a city employee or not. ... Nobody in the world has
ever done anything like that before.''

<HEAD>Poll Finds Americans More Accepting of Gays _ Away From Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are becoming more tolerant of
homosexuals and gay rights, but that tolerance wanes the closer the
issue gets to the home, according to a national survey published
Monday.
   The poll, commissioned by the San Francisco Examiner, showed
that most heterosexuals _ 73 percent _ believe homosexuality should
not be illegal. But 57 percent disapprove of two people of the same
sex living together as a married couple.
   Only 38 percent of the heterosexuals polled approved; 5 percent
said they didn't know.
   And while only one in five Americans knows someone with AIDS,
more than half of those polled said they are willing to pay $100
more in taxes each year to find a cure for the deadly disease.
   The Examiner said the poll by Teichner &amp; Associates of Fullerton
is the most extensive U.S. survey ever undertaken involving gay
people and attitudes toward them.
   The poll surveyed 3,748 randomly selected people who said they
are heterosexual and 400 who said they are homosexual or bisexual.
The margin of error ranged from plus or minus 1.7 percent for the
heterosexual sample to 5 points either way for gay people polled.
   ``The inescapable conclusion, both nationally and in the Bay
Area, is that while people are fairly accepting of homosexual
lifestyles in the theoretical sense, they are less accepting the
closer reality gets,'' said pollster Steve Teichner.
   For example, one in three people polled said they would try to
change a homosexual youth's sexual orientation while only 15
percent would try to do so with a gay friend.
   Other major conclusions of the poll were:
   _ About two out of every three homosexual and heterosexual men
and women believe discrimination of all kinds has dropped in the
last decade.
   _ Women, Westerners, liberals and Jews tend to be more accepting
of gays than others.
   Most of the respondents _ 81 percent _ said it would be
discrimination to deny a person a job because of sexual orientation.
   The South, with two out of three straight people surveyed
disapproving of same-sex living arrangements, is the least tolerent
of homosexuality. The West, with almost half approving, is the most
tolerant, the survey found..

<TEXT>
   An officer on guard at Beijing's Great Hall of
the People fired four shots at Premier Li Peng, but the Chinese
leader escaped with only a slight wound, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
   The daily Ming Pao said the young guard fired from a distance in
the attack Sunday afternoon and Li was hit in the thigh, but his
injuries were not serious.
   Ming Pao, quoting unidentified sources, said the guard was
killed immediately and about 170 other guards at the Great Hall
were quickly disarmed.
   It did not identify the slain officer but said his sister and a
girlfriend and her brother were among the victims of the weekend
assault by army troops on students in Beijing's Tienanmen square.
   Hundreds of people were killed when troopers fired on students
in and around the square who were demanding democratic reforms and
an end to corruption.
   Ming Pao, a Chinese language paper respected for its coverage of
China, said the assassination attempt occured shortly after Li
returned to the Great Hall from an inspection tour of Tienanmen
Square, which had been cleared by soldiers and tanks.
   It said that members of the would-be assassin's family were
arrested.
   The newspaper quoted one of Li's aides as saying the premier had
appeared irritated and unstable recently, tossing cups and banging
tables in anger. It said the aide has since disappeared.
   Li, a hardliner who ordered martial law in Beijing on May 20 to
evict the stludents and others occupying Tiananmen Square, has been
a target of the anti-government protesters who demanded his
resignation.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee soon will begin
reviewing a complaint against Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, an
omen that the chamber's ethics problems are not a bad dream that
will vanish with the departure of Speaker Jim Wright and Majority
Whip Tony Coelho.
   Ethics committee members could begin as early as Thursday, at
their next meeting, to review a Democratic member's complaint that
Gingrich, R-Ga., violated rules on outside income and receipt of
gifts.
   The allegations against Gingrich, revolving around a partnership
formed to promote a book he co-authored, are not the only reasons
an ethics cloud will hover over the House while Democrats try to
divert attention from their leaders' conduct.
   Still pending are Justice Department investigations of House
members' personnel practices, Justice Department internal probes of
leaks about those investigations, the conviction of a Republican
lawmaker for having sex with a minor and more public hearings by a
House task force considering changes in ethics rules.
   But as Wright prepares to leave Congress rather than fight 69
charges of rules violations, and as Coelho, D-Calif., plans his
exit to avoid repeated questions on a junk bond deal, many seething
Democrats will pay close attention to the case against Gingrich.
The Georgia Republican filed the original complaint against Wright,
although the allegations he cited were later dropped.
   Asked if he expected to be a victim of retribution, Gingrich
said last week, ``I may be,'' but added he would trust the judgment
of the 12-member ethics panel that is equally divided politically.
   Gingrich said he wouldn't be surprised if the committee _
officially the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct _ took up
his case this week. Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said
the panel may consider the complaint, filed by Rep. Bill Alexander,
D-Ark., within two weeks.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr., D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said Democrats ``do not have an
organized strategy where we met and said, `We're going to do A, B
or C on Newt. Our strategy is to sit back and let the process work.
The assumption is the committee will move with deliberate speed.
They've got nothing to gain by postponing it.''
   Other issues that will keep ethics questions alive:
   _A reported Justice Department investigation, according to
government sources, into personnel practices of House Democratic
Caucus Chairman William Gray of Pennsylvania, including whether a
``no-show'' employee was hired. Gray has denied hiring any
``ghost'' employees.
   Gray told supporters in Philadelphia on Sunday that he will not
end his attempt to step into Coelho's post as majority whip.
   _A reported Justice Department investigation into the personnel
practices of Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's non-voting
delegate to Congress, according to sources. The AP learned a grand
jury intends to begin hearing testimony from current and former
employees of Fauntroy, a Democrat, and Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill.,
over Fauntroy's hiring of Savage's son.
   _A Los Angeles Times report that the Justice Department is
conducting a preliminary investigation of whether Coelho received
favors from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the firm that issued a
junk bond purchased by Coelho.
   _An investigation by the Justice Department into leaks by its
own employees on the House investigations.
   In Chicago on Sunday, former presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson called for an outside special counsel to investigate the
Justice Department leaks to the press, which he said have thrown
dirt on Gray's reputation.
   ``The press must not give credibility and propagate rumors,
innuendos and falsehoods on the American people,'' Jackson said at
a news conference.
   _The decision of Rep. Donald E. Lukens, R-Ohio, to remain in the
House while he appeals his conviction of having sex with a
16-year-old girl, whose mother accused the lawmaker of offering her
a government job to buy her silence.
   _Wright's parting message in his emotional resignation speech
last week, when he suggested, ``Members are entitled to know what
the rules mean and if they still mean what they meant when they
were written and promulgated. Now maybe the rules need to be
changed. Let's vote to change them.''
   _Public hearings by a House task force on ethics, established by
Wright earlier this year after collapse of plans to raise
lawmakers' pay in exchange for a ban on speaking fees.
   Alexander's 10-count complaint said Gingrich exceeded outside
earned income limits under an unusual arrangement with the
publisher of his book ``Window of Opportunity.'' As part of the
arrangement, a limited partnership of 22 investors paid for
promotion and marketing of the book.
   Several counts charged that Gingrich violated a rule prohibiting
members from keeping gifts of more than $100 from anyone with an
interest in legislation. This allegation referred to the
legislative interests of some members of the partnership, which
consisted of Republican political activists and businessmen. The
partnership raised some $105,000 to promote the book.
   Gingrich said at an April news conference that none of the
investors ever received ``unusual or extraordinary personal help''
from him in their dealings with the federal government.
   The lawmaker added that the partnership did not violate the gift
rule because the money each investor contributed did not constitute
a gift.

   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear the
appeals of a California death row inmate who says the state's
capital punishment law does not give jurors enough discretion in
sentencing.
   The justices said they will review the case of Richard Boyde.
   He challenged, among other things, that portion of the
California death penalty law that requires sentencing juries to
impose death if they find that aggravating factors outweigh
mitigating ones.
   Boyde was condemned for the Jan. 15, 1981, murder of Dick
Gibson, a Riverside convenience store clerk. Police said Boyde and
Carl Ellison abducted Gibson after robbing the store, took him to a
nearby orange grove and shot him.
   Ellison also was convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life.
   Boyde had been convicted of robbing the same convenience store
five years earlier. The store's clerk had been abducted that time
also, but was not killed.
   The case is Boyde vs. California, 88-6613.

<HEAD>Court To Consider Reinstating Armed Robbery Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating the conviction and 35-year prison sentence of a
Maryland man accused of armed robbery.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that the conviction
was tainted by evidence obtained unlawfully by police.
   Prince George's County police investigating the Feb. 3, 1986,
armed robbery of a restaurant obtained arrest warrants for two
suspects, Jerome Buie and Lloyd Allen.
   A half dozen police officers went to Buie's home in Riverdale
two days after the robbery and arrested him. After entering the
home, they looked for him on the first and second floors.
   One officer went to the basement stairs, yelling for anyone who
might be down there to come out.
   Buie eventually emerged and climbed the basement stairs to be
searched, handcuffed and arrested by the officer.
   At that point, another officer descended the stairs to the
basement, where he saw in plain view and then seized a red running
suit. A victim of the robbery had said that one of the robbers wore
a red running suit.
   Prosecutors, over Buie's objection, used the running suit as
evidence at his trial. He was convicted and sentenced to 35 years
in prison.
   An intermediate state appeals court upheld the conviction, but
the Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled by
a 4-3 vote last Nov. 28 that Buie is entitled to a new trial.
   The state court said police wrongly searched the basement
because they had neither a search warrant nor ``probable cause'' to
believe they would find Allen or any other accomplice in the
basement.
   While acknowledging that Buie was arrested lawfully, the state
court said the running suit should have been excluded as evidence
because it was seized in an unlawful police search.
   The state court said police violated the ban on unreasonable
searches and seizures imposed by the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment.
   Police who make arrests generally are allowed to conduct
so-called sweep searches of the arrest area if they reasonably
believe their safety is jeopardized.
   But the state court said, ``The facts in this case simply do not
provide probable cause to support a reasonable belief that ... any
other serious and demonstrable potentiality for danger existed.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Maryland prosecutors said other
courts have not required police officers to have ``full probable
cause to believe other persons are on the premises'' before
conducting such searches.
   They urged the justices to use Buie's case ``to fashion a
standard (for) police officers and courts'' in such circumstances.
   The prosecutors argued that the Prince George's County police
officers ``had a right and a duty to make certain that third
persons, including Buie's co-defendant Lloyd Allen, were not in
Buie's basement.''
   The case is Maryland vs. Buie, 88-1369.

<HEAD>Defendent With Criminal Past Tried in Palme Murder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who went on trial today for the
1986 murder of Olof Palme denied that he gunned down the prime
minister.
   ``I did not kill Prime Minister Olof Palme. I did not try to
kill Mrs. Palme,'' defendant Carl Gustaf Christer Pettersson told
the court. ``The shooting was an infamous crime that I could never
have committed.''
   Palme was shot in the back from a distance of eight inches on
Feb. 28, 1986 as he walked home from a movie. The gunman escaped
down a dark side street.
   Mrs. Palme was slightly wounded by a second bullet, and
Pettersson also faces charges of attempted murder.
   Chief Magistrate Michael af Geijerstam called the trial to order
in Stockholm District Court. He broke a five-month news blackout on
the defendant's identity by reading Pettersson's name live on a
radio broadcast.
   Under Swedish law his name could not be released until the trial
and he has been identified in Swedish media only as ``the
42-year-old.'' Pettersson has a history of drug and alcohol abuse
and a long criminal record.
   During the long investigation into the slaying, police and
security agencies were accused of bungling the case and failing to
turn up credible leads, despite a reward of $8 million. Three
police chiefs and a justice minister resigned at various points in
the investigation.
   Palme, a dynamic and controversial politician, was a U.N.
mediator in the Iran-Iraq war and an advocate of world disarmament.
He led Social Democratic governments in Sweden for 11 years.
   Pettersson was arrested Dec. 14 in a twist to a case that
previously had focused on possible international conspiracies.
   Pettersson, who has a previous manslaughter conviction on a
record sheet of more than 60 crimes, was routinely questioned
during the initial weeks of the investigation, but he was let go.
Pettersson's record includes a conviction for stabbing a man to
death with a bayonet in 1970 just a few steps from where Palme was
killed.
   The prosecution's case relies heavily on the evidence of Lisbet
Palme, the prime minister's widow, who told investigators she
looked for an unforgettable instant into the ``terrifying face'' of
the gunman before he fled.
   But the state attorney lacks a confession, a murder weapon and
an obvious motive, making a conviction by no means a foregone
conclusion.
   The trial, expected to last about six weeks, will be broadcast
extensively on national radio and closely watched by a nation where
terrorism and political assassination had previously been virtually
unknown.
   Two jurors were disqualified last week after being quoted on the
case in a Stockholm newspaper. Defense attorneys challenged their
impartiality and called for their replacement on the panel of six
laymen and two judges.
   A 3,000-page indictment handed down last week said the
prosecution will call 33 witnesses to support their case that
Pettersson stalked the Palmes down Sveavagen Boulevard. Some will
testify he had access to a weapon and lied to investigators about
his whereabouts.
   Defense lawyers, indicated they would question the memory of
witnesses testifying three years after the crime.

<HEAD>Court Won't Consider Medicare Patients' Bid to Pay for Assistant
Surgeons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medicare patients who want to use their own
money to pay for an assistant surgeon in eye cataract operations
lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, left intact a federal law that
generally prohibits paying assistants for such surgery.
   Medicare, a federal health insurance program for people over 65,
paid surgeons $822 million and assistant surgeons $42 million for
cataract operations in 1983.
   The surgery involves removal of a clouded lens from the eye. It
is the most common form of eye operation for the elderly, as some
one million cataract removals are performed each year.
   Congress in 1986 passed a cost-cutting law that generally bars
Medicare reimbursement for assistant surgeons in cataract removals.
   The law went beyond saving the government money for paying
assistants in such cases. It also barred Medicare patients from
using their own funds unless the services were approved by an
insurance carrier or a state committee that reviews such medical
costs.
   A group of medicare patients in New York and California and eye
doctors and their professional associations in the two states sued
in federal court here challenging the law.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last August threw out the suit.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that barring patients from
using their own money to pay assistant surgeons violates
constitutional privacy and liberty protections.
   The appeals court said not all choices made by patients and
their physicians are matters of privacy entitled to strict
protection by the Constitution.
   ``In the case of choosing the number of surgeons participating
in a surgical procedure designed to save sight ... the prerequisite
to a successful privacy claim would be a definite showing of
medical necessity and the unavailability of equally effective
alternative therapy,'' the appeals court said.
   It said there is insufficient evidence that having an assistant
present for cataract surgery ``is indispensable to patient
well-being.''
   The appeals court also said it is premature for the courts to
determine whether the patients were deprived of liberty without due
process.
   That claim first must be tested by having patients request
permission from an insurance company or state review committee to
pay an assistant, the appeals court said. Only when such requests
are denied might there be grounds for the courts to intervene.
   In the appeal acted on today, the patients said the law puts
them in an unfair position. They said they can either choose to
have the operation without an assistant present or they must give
up all Medicare benefits and pay for the entire cost of medical
treatment themselves.
   The case is New York Opthalmological Society vs. Sullivan,
88-1146.

   Carbon monoxide fumes apparently spewn by a
piece of cleaning equipment sickened more than 50 people at a
crowded supermarket that was celebrating its reopening under new
management, authorities said.
   Of the 34 taken to two hospitals Sunday, six were still there
this morning. Two were listed in satisfactory condition and four
were in stable condition, according to hospital spokespersons.
Others complained of feeling ill but were not taken to hospitals.
   ``People were laying on the sidewalks and in the road,''
Rockdale County Deputy Fire Chief J.R. Magness said Sunday. ``They
were passing out. We had about 15 out at one time.''
   The gas was blamed on a propane-powered floor buffer that had
been used overnight. Magness said fumes circulated through the
store in the air-conditioning system. The store and surrounding
stores in the shopping center were evacuated.
   The accident occurred as a former Piggly Wiggly store reopened
as Bruno's. The grocery store was crowded when employees and
customers began passing out and complaining of headaches, breathing
difficulties and nausea.
   Bruno's Vice President Morrell Dodd confirmed that the buffer
appeared to be the cause.
   ``The explanation at this point is that it was a propane floor
machine. We've never had any trouble with this before,'' Dodd said.

<HEAD>Bush Calls For Release of Hostages</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Top 8 grafs new, picks up 5th graf pvs, The White House hope</HEAD>

   President Bush said today he would make no
overtures to the new regime in Iran and demanded the release of
hostages held by what he said has been ``a terrorist state.''
   Bush told a White House news conference he was ``not sure yet''
about the implications of the change in Tehran with the death of
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the naming of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khamenei to succeed the man who led Iran's fundamentalist
revolution.
   The United States broke ties with Iran a decade ago after the
U.S. embassy was overrun. The diplomats taken hostage then were not
released until January 1981, 444 days later.
   Bush, in a clear signal to Tehran, said ``there is a way for the
relationship to improve, and that's for the release of the American
hostages.''
   But the president ruled out any overtures to the new government,
with which the United States has broken virtually all commercial
ties. ``Absolutely not,'' Bush said. ``They have been a terrorist
state.''
   The State Department's Office for Counter-Terrorism lists nine
Americans as hostages in Lebanon, as well as three Britons, an
Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian. All the Americans are believed
held by pro-Iranian factions.
   ``As soon as we see some move away from oppression and extremism
of that nature we will review our relationship,'' Bush said.
   On Sunday, the White House expressed hope that after Khomeini's
death Iran would adopt ``a responsible role'' in the world
community.
   The White House hope was echoed by former president Jimmy
Carter, whose administration was hurt by the 1979 seizure of
American hostages from the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Carter was
conciliatory in comments made Sunday outside his church in Plains,
Ga.
   ``I know he was a great hero in his own nation,'' Carter said.
``My hope is that his successor will be more inclined toward peace
and reconciliation.''
   Warren Christopher, former U.S. State Department negotiator and
now a Los Angeles lawyer, said, ``I felt so long as he was alive
there would be little improvement in U.S.-Iran relations. He had
such a monstrous hatred for the U.S. ... I wouldn't expect any
immediate change. But I don't think his level of hatred can be
maintained.''
   Despite the poor state of U.S.-Iranian relations in the past,
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said Sunday that Bush should extend an
``open arm'' to Iran now that Khomeini has died.
   Appearing on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' Lugar said the United
States may be able to take a new initiative in the region in the
post-Khomeini era.
   ``President Bush should reiterate the call that his gave in his
message at the inauguration, the open arm to Iran. Clearly ... the
relationship could be very different. We'd like to make it that
way,'' Lugar said.
   The senator said he didn't believe there are any ``moderates''
in Iran, ``but there may be people that we can deal with, and that
we have to hope for.''
   Lugar also suggested that the administration should consider
increasing the U.S. military presence in the region.
   ``We really need to have more resources with which to deal''
with the Iranian situation, he said, suggesting the administration
should think about ``extending American authority into the area
during this transition and very unstable situation.''
   Bush spent two days at his seaside estate at Kennebunkport,
Maine, after returning from a week-long trip to Italy, Belgium,
West Germany and England and a NATO summit.
   The president initially appeared unaware of Khomeini's death,
announced shortly before midnight Saturday.
   Jogging near his seaside home at 6:30 a.m. EDT Sunday, Bush was
asked by a reporter whether he had heard about Khomeini. When Bush
replied, ``No,'' the reporter shouted that the ayatollah had died.
   The president declined to comment. He also brushed aside
questions about China, where hundreds of people were reported
killed in a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.

   Grimsvotn and Stromboli, Mount St. Helens and
Karkar, Etna and Nevada del Ruiz. The names conjure up drama and
disaster, a decade of human suffering and scientific inquiry into
the earth's volcanoes.
   Around the world, the erupting mountains that help emphasize the
unsettled nature of the planet become the subject of intense
curiosity when they initiate tragedy. Then they fade from center
stage, of interest only to scientists, relief workers and local
residents.
   Some of the researchers who chronicle and study these events
have now collected a decade's worth of records, major ones of great
impact and smaller eruptions notable for little beyond their
continuing threat.
   ``Global Volcanism 1975-1985'' is largely a scientific treatise,
yet within its 672 pages of text, charts and maps are detailed some
of the most dramatic events of a decade.
   ``An explosive eruption on 13 Nov melted ice and snow in the
summit area, generating lahars that flowed tens of kilometers down
flank river valleys, killing more than 22,000 people,'' begins the
report on Nevada del Ruiz, the Colombia volcano that became the
fourth deadliest volcano in history.
   Lahars, the geological term for massive mudflows generated by
volcanoes, came crashing down 11 narrow valleys into villages,
sweeping away or burying the thousands who made their homes and
lives there in November of 1985.
   ``A frightening noise and then a blast of wind hit us and we saw
fire falling from the sky,'' survivor E. Nieto told the scientists
that day.
   Compiled by the Smithsonian Institution, the new volume is
published by Prentice-Hall and the American Geophysical Union. It
collects reports from the first 10 years of the Smithsonian's
Scientific Event Alert Network. The network is a collection of
thousands of scientists around the world who study volcanoes,
earthquakes, meteors and other such events and share their findings
with one another.
   With scientific thoroughness, for example, they reported not
only that Nevada del Ruiz ranked fourth in volcano death tolls,
they listed the three events that were even worse: Tambora, 1815,
92,000 killed; Krakatau, 1883, 36,000 dead; Mt. Pelee, 1902, 28,000
fatalities.
   One of the editors of the new volume, Tom Simkin, the
Smithsonian's curator of petrology and volcanology, co-wrote an
earlier volume, ``Krakatau 1883.'' Others who joined in editing and
updating the network reports are Smithsonian researchers Lindsay
McClelland, Marjorie Summers, Elizabeth Nielsen and Thomas Stein.
   In addition to Nevada del Ruiz, the volume reports in detail on
Mount St. Helens in Washington, which is better known to Americans.
   Its May 1980 explosion claimed more than 50 lives, cost billions
of dollars in damage and cleanup and coated large parts of several
states with thick, gritty dust for days afterward. The mountain
remains active.
   The volume notes earthquake activity at thee other Cascade or
Sierra Nevada volcanoes during the period: Mount Hood, Ore.; Mount
Shasta, Calif., and Long Valley Caldera, Calif.
   Alaska gets a full chapter on its own, and Hawaii provides the
bulk of activity in the Central Pacific Ocean section.
   Among the more than 200 volcanoes reported in the volume are:
   _Stromboli, near Sicily, which began a new effusive phase in
November 1975, continuing a history of more than 2,000 years of
almost constant activity.
   _Etna, the volcano with the longest documented record in the
world, extending back to 1500 B.C. This Sicilian volcano continued
its tradition with several eruptions during the decade.
   _Grimsvotn, in Iceland, which erupted in both 1982 and 1983.
Located beneath an ice sheet, Grimsvotn melts the ice when it
erupts, flooding local streams and in 1983 produced large steam
clouds.
   _Karkar, off the coast of New Guinea, erupted with an explosive
blast of hot gas and debris March 8, 1979, killing two scientists
who had set up camp to study the volcano.
   Robin J.S. Cooke and Elias Ravian died in the blast, just over a
year before Mount St. Helens would kill another volcanologist,
David Johnston of the U.S. Geological Survey.

   Anti-nuclear activists blocked gates at
the Seabrook nuclear power plant today, capping a weekend of
protests that brought the arrest total to nearly 700.
   Police said 48 people were arrested as they sat in the road in
front of two gates and kept workers on the 7 a.m. shift from
entering the plant on time. They were quickly loaded into a van,
many of them dragged by officers, and taken to the Seabrook police
station.
   Some of those demonstrators returned two hours later and joined
others to block one gate where management people tried to enter the
plant, and at least 17 more arrests were made.
   ``We've put in long hours and there is no reason that we should
keep having this aggravation,'' a frustrated Police Chief Paul
Cronin said today. ``And that's all it is. It's an aggravation for
the town, it's an aggravation for the police department.''
   The arrests came a day after non-violent demonstrations that
resulted in 627 arrests, the second largest number of arrests in
one day in 13 years of demonstrations that have made Seabrook a
symbol of the nation's anti-nuclear movement. The largest was in
May 1977, when 1,414 people were arrested.
   There was also a rally on Saturday, which attracted an estimated
4,000 people.
   ``I think this truly marks the beginning of a new era of
resistance to the Seabrook project. We will be back at this plant
as they continue to attempt to license it,'' said Roy Morrison,
shortly after he was arrested Sunday on a criminal trespass charge.
   Protest spokeswoman Dianne Dunfey said protests could continue
later in the week as the start of low-power testing at the plant
draws near.
   Employee Bob McCormack, who sat in his pickup truck honking at
the demonstrators in front of him, said he resented having his
passage blocked. McCormack said the protesters have a right to
express their opinion but no right to interfere with his job.
   Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said the demonstrators and the 4,000
people who rallied Saturday at Hampton Beach State Park were a
``vocal minority.'' Still, it was the largest anti-Seabrook
gathering in 11 years.
   ``The majority of people in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and the
rest of New England recognize that nuclear power is a viable energy
alternative,'' Sher said. ``We're safe, we're needed and we're
ready to produce electricity.''
   Nearly three years after the $6 billion reactor was completed,
it won its federal low-power testing license on May 26.
   During the weekend, Seabrook engineers encountered a problem
with a valve in a safety-related system, but plant spokesmen
predicted the first atomic chain reaction in Seabrook's 100 tons of
uranium fuel would start by late this week.
   The plant can't win a commercial license before the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission approves evacuation plans for crowded beaches
and communities up to 10 miles from the plant _ including
Massachusetts communities that have refused to cooperate in making
the plans.
   Interviewed late Sunday night at the Seabrook police station,
Cronin said the 627 arrests included about 75 people who were
arrested twice.
   Before the weekend, Clamshell organizers had met several times
with state and local police to discuss plans for the protest.
   ``It went pretty much as planned,'' Cronin said.
   The weekend's demonstrations were organized by the Clamshell
Alliance, which has been staging protests against Seabrook since
plant construction began in 1976.
   About 1,500 protesters converged on the plant site Sunday.
Hundreds of them climbed over or crawled under boundary fences
around the plant and sat down when they met police lines a short
distance inside.
   No protesters resisted arrest, though some would not walk to
waiting school buses and had to be dragged on. Some protesters
chatted briefly with their arresting officers and shook hands with
them.
   No injuries were reported.
   Morrison was among about 50 demonstrators who climbed a fence at
an abandoned railroad siding on the north side of the plant,
re-creating an August 1976 protest there that was the first group
civil disobedience ever against a U.S. nuclear power plant.
   The first over the fence was Paul Gunter, who was among the 18
arrested in the protest in 1976.
   Many of the protesters arrested in the first wave of civil
disobedience Sunday returned to the scene waving their pink summons
slips for criminal trespassing.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Church of Scientology in Tax Deduction Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contributions called ``fixed donations'' made
to the Church of Scientology by its members may not be claimed as
federal income tax deductions, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   By a 5-2 vote, the justices upheld the Internal Revenue
Service's contention that the fixed donations are not charitable
contributions that can be counted as tax deductions.
   Lawyers for the Scientologists had argued that the IRS singled
out their church for unfair treatment _ a contention with which two
justices agreed.
   ``The court today acquiesces in the decision ... to manufacture
a singular exception to (the IRS') 70-year practice of allowing
fixed payments indistinguishable from those made by
(Scientologists) to be deducted as charitable contributions,''
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in dissent.
   ``Because the IRS cannot constitutionally be allowed to select
which religions will receive the benefit of its past rulings, I
respectfully dissent,'' she said.
   O'Connor's opinion was joined by Justice Antonin Scalia.
   But the court's majority, in an opinion by Justice Thurgood
Marshall, said it had too little information about past IRS
practices in dealing with other religions to find any
discriminatory treatment.
   Referring to the fixed donations made by Church of Scientology
members, Marshall said, ``We hold that such payments are not
deductible.''
   Federal law allows taxpayers to reduce their tax liability by
declaring various deductions, including money or things of value
given to charities or religious organizations. But such a payment
is not tax-deductible if something of value is received in return.
   A practice within the Church of Scientology is a process known
as auditing, in which members are expected to reach a higher level
of spiritual awareness. Auditing is administered in a one-to-one
session in which the church member's skin responses to questions
are measured by an electronic device.
   The church also engages in training sessions, in which members
study the doctrines and practices of Scientology.
   Each branch of the church charges a fixed donation for training
and auditing, and almost never waives the payment requirement.
   The U.S. Tax Court ruled in a 1984 test case that the fixed
donations required by the church are not tax deductible
contributions but instead are non-deductible payments made for
services.
   Three federal appeals courts upheld the Tax Court's ruling but
one rejected it.
   Today's decision resolves the conflicting rulings, and
represents a significant defeat for the Church of Scientology.
   The high court rejected arguments that denying tax deductions
for the fixed donations violates the religious freedom of
Scientologists and creates an impermissible denominational
preference.
   Marshall wrote for the court that the IRS code defining
charitable contributions ``is neutral both in design and purpose.''
   ``It may be that a consequence of the quid pro quo orientation
of the `contribution or gift' requirement is to impose a disparate
burden on those charitable and religous groups that rely on sales
of commodities or services as a means of fund-raising,'' Marshall
said.
   ``But a statute primarily having a secular effect does not
violate (freedom of religion) merely because it happens to coincide
or harmonize with the tenets of some or all religions,'' he added.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens joined Marshall.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Anthony M. Kennedy did not
participate in the case.
   The cases are Herandez vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
87-963, and Graham vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 87-1616.

   Government and religious leaders in many countries condemned the
military attacks on pro-democracy protesters in China, and the Hong
Kong stock exchange plunged today in a sign of growing nervousness
over the turmoil in Beijing.
   President Bush today condemned Chinese authorities for the
``violent and bloody'' crackdown and said he was ordering an
immediate suspension of American military sales and commerical
export of weapons to China.
   ``We deplore the decision to use force,'' Bush told reporters in
a hastily convened news conference in Washington. He urged Chinese
authorities ``to avoid violence and to return to their previous
policy of restraint.''
   There also were calls for a United Nations session, and Chinese
people in many countries protested the heavy casualties in the
Chinese army's assaults Sunday and today on crowds of students and
other civilians in Beijing.
   World leaders including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and Pope John Paul II expressed dismay and concern at the violence,
which had a particularly strong impact on China's neighbors such as
Hong Kong and Taiwan, where huge sympathy demonstrations were held.
   ``The stability of China is important for peace and stability on
the Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia,'' a Foreign Ministry
spokesman in South Korea said today. The spokesman said Seoul hopes
the situation ``can be resolved peacefully.''
   The Hong Kong stock market suffered its worst fall since the
1987 worldwide market collapse. The Hang Seng Index of blue chips
lost 581.77 points in the day's trading, closing at 2,093.61.
   China's fast economic growth in recent years has been an
important tonic for Asian countries, and the chance of prolonged
turmoil in China was a setback to the confidence that had been
building as the region seemed more tranquil with progress in
Sino-Soviet relations and in Indochina.
   ``A China with large sections of her people, including her best
educated, at odds with the government, means trouble,'' said
Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. ``China could create
problems for herself and her neighbors.''
   Hong Kong, a British colony, is to revert to Chinese rule in
1997 under a Sino-British treaty, and the violence in Beijing has
made its 5.7 million people deeply nervous about their future.
   About 200,000 people rallied Sunday in Hong Kong to denounce the
killings, and many people wept as they watched televised reports
from Beijing.
   In Taiwan, 100,000 protesters marched in the three largest
cities today and share prices plunged. The stock market index ended
at 9,120.54 points, down 455.44 points, the largest single-day fall
in the market's 27-year history.
   The market drop was prompted by concern the $2.7 billion trade
with the mainland would suffer, analysts said. Trade between Taiwan
and China through third parties was permitted by Taiwan's governing
Nationalists two years ago, although the government still bans
official contacts between the governments.
   In Britain, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe summoned a
senior Chinese diplomat to a meeting today.
   Meanwhile, David Howell, a legislator in Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative Party, urged her to seek new assurances from Beijing
on Hong Kong's future. ``Having got a treaty with a government that
can shoot people down like this, we must have a reassurance that
the spirit of the treaty stands,'' Howell said.
   The treaty calls for Hong Kong to be able to keep its
freewheeling socioeconomic lifestyle after China takes over.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke protested by canceling a
planned October visit to China, and his foreign minister, Gareth
Evans, summoned the Chinese ambassador today for consultations.
   ``We had admired the restraint that had been demonstrated by the
Chinese government until the weekend and were shocked at the extent
to which that restraint has now been abandoned,'' Evans said
afterward.
   In West Germany, Labor Minister Norbert Bluem said there should
be a special session of the United Nations on the assault.
   ``A government that scorns human life and tramples on human
rights must reckon with contempt from all civilized states,'' Bluem
said in a statement.
   In an unusual move, the normally neutral Swiss government
summoned the Chinese ambassador to condemn the ``brutal'' use of
force.
   In the Philippines, President Corazon Aquino said she was ``very
sad about the violent turn of events in China.'' But her Foreign
Ministry spokesman, Jose Ingles, said that while his country
sympathized with the Chinese people, ``We cannot presume to
interfere in their internal affairs.''
   Philippine Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, who has visited China twice in
an effort to improve relations between Beijing and the Vatican,
said he was ``greatly dismayed'' at the use of military force.
   Pope John Paul II, on a tour of Scandinavia, expressed concern.
``As Christians,'' he said, ``we hope that these deaths may serve
to bring about new life in that great and beloved country.''
   Soviet television broadcast dramatic footage of the clashes
between Chinese troops and protesters, but Soviet officials were
silent on the attack.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry said Sunday it was ``gravely
concerned'' and hopes ``that the situation will not deteriorate
further.''
   Feng Ruomin, one of hundreds of Chinese students who
demonstrated in Tokyo and other Japanese cities, said: ``The
students in Beijing haven't even broken a windowpane, how can you
call that a riot?''
   Other protests by Chinese students were held in Paris, London,
Vienna, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Oslo, the Hague and
Vancouver.

   The Smoot is no longer moot.
   The Smoot was invented in 1958 at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology when freshman fraternity pledges were ordered to measure
the length of Harvard Bridge using only chalk and the body of one
Oliver Reed Smoot Jr. The pranksters manhandled their fellow pledge
end-to-end like a ruler to measure the bridge.
   The bridge markings, maintained by Lambda Chi Alpha pledges for
30 years, threatened to become extinct when the 1891 bridge
recently was slated for a $16.5 million reconstruction.
   However, the Metropolitan District Commission and the Department
of Public Works decided the Smoot should stay when the sidewalk was
replaced.
   ``As a result of the Smoot withstanding the test of time, it has
become part of the folklore of the Harvard Bridge, and as such is
now under the protection of the MDC,'' declared the agency's chief
bridge engineer, David Lenhardt, at a re-Smooting ceremony Sunday.
   On the night of the fraternity prank, the bridge was found to be
364.4 Smoots plus one ear.
   ``Out of the 14 pledges, I had the distinction of being the
shortest,'' explained Smoot, who is 5 feet 7 inches.
   ``And had the best name,'' said Peter S. Miller, who was in
charge of the chalk on that fateful night.
   Twice a year since, freshman pledges have faithfully
``re-Smooted'' the bridge that links MIT with Boston, marking each
10-Smoot length with a gash of paint on the sidewalk.
   The bridge's new sidewalk is scored at 5-foot 7-inch intervals
instead of the usual 6 feet, which will make it easier for future
pledges to repaint their Smoot marks, said Charles Madden, senior
vice president for Martin Continental Construction Co., the
contractor rebuilding the bridge.
   Smoot, now an executive with a trade group in Washington, D.C.,
lay down to have Miller chalk his measure on the new sidewalk.
Although the original deed was done in the dark of night,
interrupted once by a patrolling police car that sent the pledges
scurrying into the shrubs, the re-Smooting was punctuated with
flash bulbs and applause.
   Smoot and his son Stephen, MIT Class of '90, also posed in front
of a bronze plaque that was donated by Smoot's Class of '62 at
their 25th class reunion.
   It reads: ``This plaque placed in honor of the Smoot, which
joined the angstrom, meter and light year as standards of length
when in October, 1958, the span of this bridge was measured using
the body of Oliver Reed Smoot, MIT '62, and found to be precisely
364.4 Smoots and one ear.''
   Reflecting back on the obscure act that has made him a local
legend, Smoot concluded, ``We did it under orders, and we didn't
enjoy it then. But we sure as hell enjoy it now.''

   The Supreme Court today refused to review the
case of an Illinois bookstore owner found guilty of contempt for
violating a law later judged to be unconstitutional.
   The justices, without comment, let stand the contempt finding
against Sequoia Books Inc. in connection with its operation of the
Denmark Bookstore near Aurora, Ill.
   The bookstore, which sells sexually explicit material,
previously had been convicted of selling obscene material when in
1987 it was found to be a public nuisance under state law.
   A state judge issued an order permanently barring the bookstore
from ``maintaining the public nuisance (by) exhibiting, selling or
offering for sale material in the premises'' that would violate the
law.
   Sequoia Books Inc. challenged the permanent injunction as an
impermissible ``prior restraint'' of free speech. While the appeal
was pending, prosecutors sought to have the bookstore closed down
on grounds that it again was selling obscene materials.
   The sale of two magazines, ``Leather Sleaze'' and ``Hard
Leather,'' was cited by the prosecutors, who contended that the
magazines were obscene.
   Sexually explicit material, while often characterized as
pornography, is not necessarily obscene. Obscenity, a legal term,
must be determined in a judicial proceeding.
   If sexually explicit material is obscene, it enjoys no
free-speech protection. If it is not obscene, it is protected by
the free-speech guarantees in the Constitution's First Amendment.
   A state court jury in mid-1987 found that the two magazines were
obscene, and that the Denmark Bookstore therefore had violated the
court order barring it from violating the state's public nuisance
law.
   Sequoia Books Inc. was found guilty of criminal contempt of
court and was fined $10,000.
   On Jan. 19, 1988, a state appeals court ruled for Sequoia Books
in its earlier appeal of the permanent injunction. The appeals
court said the state criminal public nuisance law, when applied to
the bookstore, was an invalid prior restraint on free speech.
   State prosecutors appealed that ruling to the Illinois Supreme
Court, and that appeal is pending.
   Meanwhile, the Denmark Bookstore again was found in contempt of
the judge's order barring violation of public nuisance law. The
bookstore was padlocked for a period of time.
   Last July 21, the same appeals court that invalidated the state
public nuisance law's application to the bookstore upheld the
contempt citations stemming from violations of that law.
   The appeals court rejected Sequoia Books' argument that a
judgment of contempt cannot stand when based on an unconstitutional
injunction.
   The appeals court said the judge's order barring the bookstore
from violating the nuisance law was not ``transparently invalid''
when issued, and therefore could support a contempt finding.
   The state Supreme Court refused to review the contempt issue,
but postponed the appeals court ruling's effect _ a $20,000 fine
and possibly another padlocking _ to allow Sequoia Books a chance
to seek help from the nation's highest court.
   The case is Sequoia Books vs. Illinois, 88-1342.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
announcement Monday of sanctions against the Chinese government and
his question-and-answer session with reporters afterward:
   Well, during the past few days, elements of the Chinese army
have been brutally suppressing popular and peaceful demonstrations
in China. There's been widespread and continuing violence, many
casualties, and many deaths.
   And we deplore the decision to use force, and I now call on the
Chinese leadership publicly, as I have in private channels, to
avoid violence and to return to their previous policy of restraint.
   The demonstrators in Tiananmen Square were advocating basic
human rights, including the freedom of expression, freedom of the
press, freedom of association. These are goals we support around
the world.
   These are freedoms that are enshrined in both the US
Constitution and the Chinese constitution. Throughout the world, we
stand with those who seek greater freedom and democracy. This is
the strongly felt view of my administration, of our Congress, and
most important, of the American people.
   In recent weeks, we've urged mutual restraint, nonviolence, and
dialogue; instead, there has been a violent and bloody attack on
the demonstrators. The United States cannot condone the violent
attacks and cannot ignore the consequences for our relationship
with China, which has been built on a foundation of broad support
by the American people.
   This is not the time for an emotional response, but for a
reasoned, careful action, that takes into account both our
long-term interests and recognition of a complex internal situation
in China.
   There clearly is turmoil within the ranks of the political
leadership, as well as the political _ the People's Liberation
Army. And now is the time to look beyond the moment to important
and enduring aspects of this vital relationship for the United
States. Indeed, the budding of democracy which we have seen in
recent weeks owes much to the relationship we have developed since
1972.
   And it's important at this time to act in a way that will
encourage the further development and deepening of the positive
elements of that relationship and the process of democratization.
It would be a tragedy for all if China were to pull back to its
pre-1972 era of isolation and repression.
   Mindful of these complexities and yet of the necessity to
strongly and clearly express our condemnation of the events of
recent days, I'm ordering the following actions:
   _Suspension of all government-to-government sales and commercial
exports of weapons.
   _Suspension of visits between US and Chinese military leaders.
   _Sympathic review of requests by Chinese students in the United
States to extend their stay.
   _And the offer of humanitarian and medical assistance, through
the Red Cross, to those injured during the assault.
   _And review of other aspects of our bilateral relationship as
events in China continue to unfold.
   The process of democratization of communist societies will not
be a smooth one, and we must react to setbacks in a way which
stimulates rather than stifles progress toward open and
representative systems.
   And I'd be glad to take a few questions before our Cabinet
meeting which starts in a few minutes. I think _ I can't remember
who's first here. Tom?
   Q: Yes, Mr. President, you have said _
   Bush: And then Helen.
   Q: You have said the genie of democracy cannot be put back in
the bottle in China. You said that, however, before the actions of
the past weekend. Do you still believe that? And are there further
steps that the United States could take, such as economic
sanctions, to further democracy in China?
   Bush: Yes, I still believe that. I believe the forces of
democracy are so powerful, and when you see them, as recently as
this morning _ a single student standing in front of a tank, and
then, I might add, seeing the tank driver exercise restraint _ I'm
convinced that the forces of democracy are going to overcome these
unfortunate events in Tiananmen Square.
   On the commercial side, I don't want to hurt the Chinese people.
I happen to believe that commercial contacts have led, in essence,
to this quest for more freedom. I think as people have commercial
incentive, whether it's in China or in other totalitarian systems,
the move to democracy becomes more inexorable.
   So what we have done is suspended certain things on the military
side, and my concern is with those in the military who are using
force. And yet when I some exercising restraint, and see the big
divisions that exist inside the PLA, I am _ I think we need to move
along the lines I've outlined here.
   I think that it's important to keep saying to those elements in
the Chinese military, ``Restraint. Continue to show the restraint
that many of you have shown.'' And I understand there are deep
divisions inside the Army. So this is -- we're putting the emphasis
on that side of it.
   Yes, Helen.

<HEAD>Man Hangs From George Washington Bridge Between N.Y.-N.J.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A paraplegic hung on a rope from the George
Washington Bridge for more than two hours this morning, producing a
rush hour traffic jam before he surrendered to police.
   Police said the man apparently was the same one who lowered
himself from the Brooklyn Bridge last August.
   That was Ramond Masa, a 40-year-old paraplegic who hung over the
East River for more than an hour Aug. 1 before police persuaded him
to come down. He described himself as ``Megaman'' and ``America's
No. 1 stunt man,'' and said he wanted to inspire other paraplegics
by getting his stunt in the record books.
   Sgt. Dominic Evangelista of the Port Authority police, the force
that patrols the bridge, said the man lowered himself from the
George Washington Bridge's upper level shortly before 6 a.m., and
within an hour was about 100 feet from the Hudson River. The bridge
carries traffic on Interstate 95 between New York City and New
Jersey.
   He carried what looked like a United Nations flag, and set off
smoke bombs while hanging over the water, police said.
   Eastbound traffic was backed up this morning for four or five
miles into New Jersey, Evangelista said. Two eastbound lanes were
closed, and motorists in other lanes slowed down to look at the
spectacle.
   The man was pulled up to the bridge just after 8:30, where he
surrendered and was taken to a police stationhouse.
   At the time of the August incident, police said that Masa was
booked on charges of disorderly conduct, illegal possession of a
knife and dealing with fireworks. They were unsure this morning of
the status of the August case.

   Soldiers swept through Beijing today shooting at
enraged civilians, and there were reports of fighting between
military units sent to quell the unarmed pro-democracy protests.
   The army, which killed hundreds of people in a crackdown on the
protests over the weekend, reportedly shot and killed at least
three civilians today.
   In Washington, President Bush condemned Chinese authorities for
the ``bloody and violent'' crackdown. He said he was ordering a
suspension of American military sales and commerical export of
weapons to China.
   One Chinese military source said soldiers fought each other
around the Nanyuan military air base on the southern outsksirts of
the city today. He said the fighting was serious.
   But residents living near the restricted base said they had seen
a steady stream of planes landing and taking off but had not seen
or heard fighting.
   Artillery shelling also was heard in a far northwestern suburb.
   Asked whether soldiers were fighting each other, one Western
diplomat said: ``It's more than that. There is solid evidence.'' He
would not elaborate.
   Chinese sources said the People's Liberation Army is deeply
split over the government's May 20 decision to declare martial law
and send troops to Beijing. The 38th Army, based around Beijing,
reportedly refused to advance on the city.
   The source said the 38th was ordered to take over from the 27th
Army, which is responsible for the carnage over the weekend. It is
not clear whether the army is obeying the order.
   Although there have been no accurate tallies, more than 1,000
people are widely believed to have been killed and thousands
injured since the army moved to retake Tiananmen Square from
student-led protesters.
   Philippine Vice Consul Corazon Patarata told a Manila radio
station from Beijing today that the diplomatic community estimates
3,000 protesters have been killed by the army.
   Protests against the crackdown were reported in several
provincial cities as the government praised the military attacks as
a patriotic effort to put down rioters trying to overthrow the
communist system.
   A Chinese journalist said one man's body was ripped apart with
machine gunfire from his chin to his stomach this morning and three
others were shot and wounded when 17 truckloads of troops attacked
a crowd at a major intersection west of Tiananmen Square.
   Chinese witnesses said a girl was shot in the chest around noon
when troops charged up a narrow residential street near the square.
   Two more people died in gunfire from troops who rushed up a
central Beijing street in the late afternoon, other Chinese
witnesses said.
   A U.S. Embassy official also said soldiers fired
indiscriminately from 50 to 100 military trucks that hurtled down a
normally quiet street flanked by a park and foreign embassies. In
the evening, about 30 tanks took up positions outside an apartment
complex for diplomats.
   The American and other embassies began sheltering foreign
students studying at Chinese universities.
   Tank and troop convoys moved throughout the night and day, and
helicopters dropped off supplies at Tiananmen Square for the
thousands of soldiers occupying the area since they drove out
protesters early Sunday.
   Burned-out hulls of buses and military vehicles littered
streets, which protesters by the thousands refused to quit. Public
transportation was at a standstill and most downtown shops closed.
   No Chinese leader has come forth to take responsibility for the
decision to turn the military on civilians, filling hospitals with
the dead and dying, and it was not known how much opposition to the
move exists in the government.
   Chinese sources said senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, ordered
the attack to halt seven weeks of student protests for a freer
China and an end to official corruption. They said Deng was in a
military hospital being treated for prostate cancer.
   Premier Li Peng, who ordered martial law in Beijing, has not
appeared in public or commented on the violence. He and old guard
ideologues, many in their 80s, are believed to support the action.
   The massacre has discredited the government, army and Communist
Party and many enraged citizens are calling for revolution.
   Before the massive weekend attack, hundreds of thousands of
people had thwarted troop movements into the city.
   In eastern Beijing, soldiers let off several bursts of automatic
rifle fire today as seven military trucks moved on an intersection
where crowds had set several army vehicles ablaze.
   In Shanghai, the country's largest city, thousands of students
today blocked intersections, and in the southern provincial capital
of Changsha, sources said. They said thousands of students in the
northeastern cities of Shenyang and Changchun marched Sunday in
mourning.
   The people's defiance was symbolized in Tiananmen Square this
morning when a man wearing a white shirt ran in front of a tank
column and momentarily brought it to a halt. The man climbed on the
lead tank, got down and again moved to block its way when the tank
tried to drive around him. Finally, five or six people rushed from
the crowd at the side and dragged him to safety.
   Hundreds of people fled in panic when the column of 21 tanks and
armored personnel carriers pulled out of the square and headed
eastward. Many rode bicycles in front of the convoy. Some
bicyclists stopped in the road, seemingly daring the soldiers to
shoot.
   The street battles have paralyzed the city of 10 million,
stopping all traffic in many locations and keeping thousands from
their jobs.
   Soldiers had yet to move into campuses. At the Political Science
and Law College, a dead student was laid out on a table, with
people filing by.
   ``The Chinese government is already crazy,'' a 24-year-old woman
said.
   At Beijing University students put up slogans reading ``remember
our heroes. A blood death will be repaid in blood.''
   On Changan Avenue, the main east-west street, bicyclists today
threaded their way through tangles of road dividers smashed by
tanks and gutted buses crowds used in an attempt to stop the
military advance.
   People on the streets universally condemned the government and
military. Many had tales of people killed or maimed by
indiscriminate firing.
   ``It's just repulsive the lengths they went to,'' said one
doctor in a hospital filled with corpses.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Reinstate Connecticut Law Protecting Hunters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
Connecticut law that protected hunters against ``harassment'' and
``interference.''
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that the 1985 state law was so broad and vague that it
violated free-speech rights.
   Francelle Dorman of Niantic, Conn., was arrested Jan. 30, 1986,
and charged with violating the law.
   Her arrest occured during goose-hunting season on state forest
property located near her home.
   Ms. Dorman, described in court documents as someone opposed to
the hunting and killing of animals, had approached several hunters
in marshlands and tried to dissuade them from hunting any waterfowl.
   According to the court documents, Ms. Dorman ``walked with the
hunters ... spoke to them about the violence and cruelty of
hunting, of the beauty of the waterfowl, and (of) their right to
live peacefully and without harm.''
   When Ms. Dorman refused to leave, the hunters summoned a law
enforcement officer who arrested her.
   The criminal charges against her _ violation of the state's
Hunter Harassment Act was a misdemeanor _ later were dropped when
prosecutors concluded that her arrest had been premature. They said
Ms. Dorman only talked about what she was going to do to interfere
with hunting for geese.
   But Ms. Dorman nevertheless sued in federal court three months
after her arrest, seeking to have the law struck down. She
contended that her arrest and the threat of future enforcement of
the 1985 law violated her free-speech rights.
   A federal judge agreed and struck down the law as too vague and
overbroad.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last
Dec. 7 after turning down a request by prosecutors that the
Connecticut Supreme Court be given a chance to interpet exactly
what forms of harassment and interference would be prohibited.
   ``The Connecticut court would be in no better position than a
federal court to decide which interpretation is correct,'' the 2nd
Circuit court said, ``because (the law) is so imprecise and
indefinite it is subject to any number of interpretations.''
   The law made it a crime for anyone to ``interfere with the
lawful taking of wildlife by another person'' or to ``harass
another person who is engaged in the lawful taking of wildlife or
acts in preparation for such taking.''
   The appeals court said, ``The terms `interfere,' `harass' and
`acts in preparation' ... can mean anything.''
   The offices of the Connecticut attorney general and the chief
state's attorney then sought help from the nation's highest court.
   The case is Satti vs. Dorman, 88-1743.

   In Washington, the applause never lasts for
long.
   President Bush, fresh from his triumphant debut on the stage of
international foreign policy at the NATO summit, has come home to
face the twin challenges posed by the violence in China and the
shifting balance of power in Tehran.
   The gusto Bush showed in forging a compromise among the
irascible North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies has been
replaced with cautious steps in response to the bloody repression
of students in China.
   Early today, Bush announced he was halting U.S. weapons sales to
China and offering humantarian aid through the international Red
Cross to those injured in the supression of demonstrations in China
over the weekend.
   ``My conviction is that this is not a time for anything other
than a prudent, reasoned response...This is not the time for an
emotional response,'' Bush said in explaining to reporters in the
White House briefing room why he was not taking stronger action.
``I don't want to see a total break in this relationship and I will
not encourage a total break in this relationship.''
   Bush, who ran for the presidency touting his foreign policy
expertise, was buffeted by members of his own party, who demanded a
tough, retaliatory response to the Chinese brutalities.
   ``It's folly,'' sniffed Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. ``We need to
stand with these young people who are trying to achieve freedom.''
   Somehow, it seemed so much easier when Bush dealt with the NATO
leaders in Brussels last week. With them, he shared a common
celebration of their democratic values and the 40th anniversary of
their pact against fascism.
   There, America's new president grabbed the international stage
with his sweeping proposals for cuts in conventional weapons and
the compromise on short-range nuclear weapons.
   But in Iran, in the wake of the Khomeini's rule, Bush must deal
with a nation that deeply embarrassed his Oval Office predecessors
and stymied U.S. foreign policy as it held Americans hostage.
   And China's explosion of violence over the weekend provided a
stark display of the difficulty a major superpower faces in
attempting to influence another foreign nation.
   For weeks, the United States had appealed for calm and respect
for the expressions of democracy in China.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III repeated those admonitions
yet again on Saturday, even as the bullets began to fly in
Tiananmen Square.
   After hearing a live report of the massacre from a reporter on
the scene with the sounds of ambulances echoing in the background,
Baker's statement's took a sharper tone. He called the situation
``extremely deplorable'' and said the developments would arouse the
concern of the U.S. government and people.
   Later, the White House issued a statement in Bush's name, saying
he ``deeply'' deplored the decision ``to use force against peaceful
demonstrators and the consequent loss of life.''
   He urged Beijing to use non-violent tactics, expressing the hope
that China ``will rapidly return to the path of political and
economic reform and conditions of stability so that this
relationship (between the United States and China), so important to
both our peoples, can continue its growth.''
   During Bush's trip to China earlier this year, he was hailed as
an ``old friend,'' of the country, where he'd served as one of the
first U.S. envoys to the People's Republic.
   If Bush's actions were not as vigorous as some might like, he
promised to monitor the situation and take further steps if
necessary.
   ``It reserve the right to take a whole new look at things if the
violence escalates,'' Bush said today.
   But now he treads cautiously, because a lot is at stake.
   Does the United States turn on the 10-year relationship that has
blossomed since formal ties were reached in 1979? Do the friendly
relations, thousands of student exchanges, the $13.7 billion
two-way trade now wither and die?
   If Bush chooses, several actions are possible.
   He could recall U.S. Ambassador James Lilley for consultations
to show disapproval. He could suspend the transfer of
high-technology items or revoke the recently renewed
most-favored-nation trading status that has helped China become the
United States 13th largest trading partner.
   Currently, U.S. firms have been investing in China to the tune
of $3 billion annually.
   He also could break relations with Beijing _ an unlikely
possibility.
   It is questionable what effect sanctions would have.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., acknowledged on Sunday that the
U.S. ability to influence the course of events in China ``is very
limited.''
   But Solarz, who appeared with Helms on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation,'' said he believed that ``much more is at stake. ... What
is involved ... is our capacity to credibly maintain our leadership
of the movement for democracy and human rights around the world.
   ``And if we appear to be indifferent or insensitive to the human
rights of one-fifth of the human race, then I think it'll be very
difficult for us to plausibly contend that we are in favor of
democracy and human rights all over the world.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Delay Pennsylvanian's Execution, But Death Already
Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to postpone a
Pennsylvania death row inmate's execution but, in a strange twist
of events, a lower federal court already had granted a postponement.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, denied an emergency request filed
on behalf of Roderick Frey, whose June 13 execution was to make him
the first to die in Pennsylvania's electric chair since 1962.
   But a federal judge, acting on a separate emergency request,
granted an indefinite stay of execution last week.
   The Supreme Court request had been filed before the federal
judge acted.
   Frey, 52, was convicted of arranging the Nov. 8, 1979 killing of
his wife, Barbara Jean. She was fatally shot while driving to work
in Lancaster County.
   Frey confessed to hiring Charles Zehring for the murder. The
couple's divorce was pending at the time.
   The nation's highest court already has agreed to review the
constitutionality of Pennsylvania's death penalty law. A decision
is expected during the court term that will begin next October.
   A still-pending formal appeal filed on Frey's behalf raises the
issue the court already is studying: Whether the state law
improperly limits the discretion of juries in choosing life or
death for convicted killers.
   Under Pennsylvania's law, a jury must impose the death penalty
if it ``unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance ...
and no mitigating circumstance.''
   The justices are being urged to rule that the state law results
in impermissible mandatory death sentences.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected that argument last
October when it upheld the death penalty law.
   State officials contend the state law is constitutional because,
despite its mandatory language, nothing prevents a defendant from
presenting any and all mitigating evidence to offset any
aggravating circumstance.
   Dissenting from today's one-sentence order denying Frey's
emergency request were Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   The case is Frey vs. Pennsylvania, A-914.

   Q: Have you had personal contact with the Chinese leadership?
Why do you think they moved in the way they did? And why did you
wait so long?
   Bush: Well, I don't think we've waited so long, Helen. We've
been _I made very clear, in a personal communication to Deng
Xiaoping, my views on this. I talked to the Ambassador last night,
Jim Lilley. We've been in _ he's been in touch constantly with the
Chinese officials, and so, I can't _ I don't feel that we've waited

   We are the United States and they are China, and what I want to
do is continue to urge freedom, democracy, respect, non-violence,
and with great admiration in my heart for the students. So, I don't
think we've waited long. What was the other part of your question?

   Bush: Yes, they did.

point. We were, and have been, and will continue to urge restraint,

he told me, and this is very Chinese the way he expressed it, the
army loves the Chinese people.
   And they showed restraint for a long time, and I don't _ I can't
begin to fathom for you exactly what led to the order to use force
because, even as recently as a couple of days ago, there was
evidence that the military were under orders not to use force. So,
I think we have to wait now until that unfolds. Yeah, Brit.
   Q: Mr. President, could you give us your current, best
assessment of the political situation there _ which leaders are up,
which are down, who apparently has prevailed here, and who
apparently has lost?
   Bush: It's too obscure, it's too beclouded to say. And I would
remind you of this history. In the Cultural Revolution days, Deng
Xiaoping, at Mao Zedong's right hand, was put out; he came back in
1976. He was put out again in the last days of Mao Zedong and the
days of the Gang of Four.
   Then he came back in, and to his credit, he moved China towards
openness, towards democracy, towards reform. And suddenly we see a
reversal, and I don't think there is anybody in this country that
can answer your question with authority at this point. It doesn't
work that way in dealing with China.
   Q: Mr. President, there have been reports that Deng was behind
the move to order the troops, and other reports that he's ailing
and in a hospital. What do you know about that, sir?
   Bush: No, don't know for sure on either, and I've talked to our
ambassador on that _ as I say, last night _ and we just can't
confirm one way or another on the other. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, you spoke of the need for the US to maintain
relations with China. But given the brutality of the attacks over
the last couple of days, can the US ever return to business as
usual with the current regime?
   Bush: I don't want to see a total break in this relationship,
and I will not encourage a total break in the relationship.
   This relationship is _ when you see these kids struggling for
democracy and freedom, this would be a bad time for the United
States to withdraw and pull back and leave them to the devices of a
leadership that might decide to crack down further.
   I do _ some have suggested I take the ambassador out. In my
view, that would be 180 degrees wrong. Our ambassador provides one
of the best listening posts we have in China. He is thoroughly
experienced. And so let others make proposals that in my view don't
make much sense.
   I want to see us stay involved and continue to work for
restraint and for human rights and for democracy. And then down the
road, we have enormous commonality of interest with China, but it
will not be the same under a brutal and repressive regime. So I
stop short of suggesting that what we ought to do is break
relations with China, and I would like to encourage them to
continue their change. Yes?
   Q: Mr. Bush, you're sending a message to the military and to the
government. A couple of weeks ago you told the students to continue
to stand by their beliefs. What message do you want the students to
hear from what you're saying right now?
   Bush: That we support their quest for democracy, for reform, and
for freedom. And there should be no doubt about that. And then in
sending this message to the military, I would encourage them to go
back to the posture of a few days ago that did show restraint, and
that did recognize the rights of the people, and that did epitomize
what that Chinese leader told me, that the army loves the people.
There's still vivid examples of that.
   Q: Should the students go home? Should the students stop trying
to _
   Bush: I can't dictate to the students what they should do from
half way around the world. But we support the quest for democracy
and reform, that this relationship is vital to the United States of
America, and so is our adherence to democracy and our encouragement
for those who are willing to hold high the banner of democracy. So
we've found, I think, a prudent path here.
   Yes?

<HEAD>Lawsuit Over Uranium-Plant's Damage Goes to `Summary Trial'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, `Final arguments...', to UPDATE with jurors selected.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unusual, non-binding trial is intended to
help settle a $300 million lawsuit brought by the neighbors of a
government uranium-processing plant in a case that might otherwise
take weeks in court.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel is presiding over the
``summary trial'' to encourage an agreement in the class-action
suit representing about 14,000 people who live within five miles of
the Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio.
   Eight jurors were selected for the trial this morning, and the
court was briefly recessed before opening arguments were to begin.
The trial was expected to last about a week, with final arguments
set to begin next Monday.
   The residents charge that the plant, owned by the Energy
Department and operated from 1951 to 1985 by National Lead of Ohio
Inc., contaminated the air, water and soil with uranium, radium and
thorium as well as dangerous non-radioactive substances including
asbestos, chlorids and barium.
   The plant processed uranium for use in the government's nuclear
weapons. National Lead and its parent firm, National Lead
Industries, are named in the suit. Residents claim the plant 18
miles northwest of Cincinnati caused them emotional stress and
lowered property values.
   The Energy Department denies the allegations but has begun a
cleanup program and admitted that more than 300,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium oxide dust escaped into the atmosphere through
faulty air-filtering systems.
   Cincinnati lawyer Stanley M. Chesley, representing the
plaintiffs, said he considers the summary trial a useful tool for
encouraging a settlement, which Chesley said the Energy Department
had been unwilling to negotiate.
   ``We're finally going to hear the story of Fernald. We're
finally going to have it in a court of law,'' Chesley said. ``We
think it's a wonderful opportunity to resolve a dispute.''
   Energy Department lawyer Henry A. Gill Jr. declined to say
whether the department would be willing to settle the case.
   The Energy Department contends that the companies are innocent
because they were contractors following the government's orders.
The department has conceded it told National Lead to emphasize
production, even if that meant ignoring some environmental
regulations.
   Gill said he would not regard the verdict of the summary trial
as final.
   ``Absolutely not. It's, by its very nature, a non-binding
verdict. It's a settlement tool that some judges like to avoid
using,'' Gill said.
   But Chesley said: ``It's not binding, but in my estimation, it
becomes very significant. I think this is the utmost conflict
resolution method that we know about.''

<HEAD>Court Upholds Conviction and Death Sentence; Doesn't Rule on Bias
Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An evenly divided Supreme Court today upheld a
Texas death row inmate's murder conviction and death sentence, but
left unresolved a key question on racial bias in criminal trials.
   By a 4-4 vote, the justices automatically upheld the conviction
and sentence of Philip Tompkins, who in 1981 killed Mary D. Berry
in Houston.
   The split vote was accompanied only by a two-sentence, unsigned
opinion that upheld Texas court rulings and said Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor did not participate in the case.
   It is not known how the other eight justices are split, but the
court is likely to search out another case offering the same
question: How difficult should it be for prosecutors to prove they
did not exclude potential jurors because of their race?
   If the high court's eight other votes remain constant in some
future case, O'Connor's vote will control the outcome.
   Lower federal courts and state courts have been confused in
trying to implement a 1986 Supreme Court decision in which the
justices banned prosecutors from taking race into account when
picking jurors.
   The 1986 ruling curtailed dramatically the traditionally broad
power of prosecutors to strike prospective jurors from trials by
using ``peremptory'' or automatic challenges.
   The justices said the exclusion of potential jurors from any
criminal trial because of their race violates the equal-protection
rights of defendants and of those people excluded.
   In the case acted on today, a Texas trial judge ruled that
Tompkins had made a preliminary showing of discrimination in the
prosecution's use of peremptory challenges.
   During jury selection, the prosecutor struck all 13 potential
black jurors. As a result, the jury that convicted Tompkins, who is
black, was composed totally of whites.
   But the trial judge ruled that the prosecutor in Tompkins' case
successfully explained her peremptory challenges as ``neutral,
relative, clear and legitimate ... and not racially motivated.''
   A state appeals court upheld Tompkins' conviction and death
sentence but noted that arguments by his lawyers ``cast
considerable doubt upon the neutral explanations offered by counsel
for the state.''
   Lower courts have disagreed over just how stringently they
should evaluate a prosecutor's explanation of allegedly racially
motivated exclusions of potential jurors.
   The case is Tompkins vs. Texas, 87-6405.

<HEAD>Report Says Attack Victim Being Moved To Pittsburgh</HEAD>

   The jogger raped and beaten in Central Park
seven weeks ago is expected to be moved soon to a neurological
rehabilitation center near her parents' home in Pittsburgh,
according to a published report.
   A spokeswoman for Metropolitan Hospital, however, said she could
not confirm the report in this week's Newsweek. ``We spoke to the
doctors and they did not confirm it to us this morning,'' said
Myrna Rodriguez of the hospital's public relations office.
   The 28-year-old woman, an Ivy League-educated investment banker,
has continued showing improvement since coming out of a coma, but
doctors say she probably will never return to normal.
   She has for the first time begun asking questions about the
attack on her, and city investigators are planning to talk to her
soon, according to one of her doctors.
   While the woman has been able to have brief conversations,
recognize visitors and tell jokes, she can so far read only the
most simple sentences, Newsweek said.

<HEAD>Up To 800 People Dead In Soviet Train Disaster</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY8</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 11 grafs to UPDATE with Tass death toll, general
saying blast equal to 10,000 tons of TNT. Pickup 10th pvs, ``In Moscow...''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 800 people may have died when gas
leaking from a pipeline filled a mountain valley, exploded and
engulfed two passing trains in flames, a newspaper editor in the
area said today.
   In the first precise official report, Tass said its preliminary
count showed 400 of the more than 1,200 people aboard the passenger
trains, including many children bound for summer camp, were dead or
missing after Sunday's explosion in the Ural Mountains along the
Trans-Siberian Railroad.
   ``Military units are searching the adjacent forest and mountains
in the hope that some of the passengers managed to escape the
tornado of fire,'' the official news agency said.
   The blast was equivalent to the explosion of 10,000 tons of TNT,
Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the Soviet military chief of staff, told
Tass.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who visited the remote site
Sunday, told the new Soviet parliament ``a few hundred people'' had
been killed. He said incompetence and a lack of discipline might
have contributed to the accident.
   Gennady K. Dmitrin, editor of Evening Chelyabinsk, said his
newspaper has a list of between 500 and 800 people dead. He said
that list was preliminary.
   Dmitrin said children under age 8 did not have train tickets and
therefore were not included in the count Tass gave for the number
of people aboard.
   Asked about the death toll given by Dmitrin, Dr. Vladimir
Ruchki, a local Health Ministry spokesman said: ``It's about
right.'' He said more than 600 people were hospitalized. Tass said
more than 500 people were hospitalized and that 85 percent suffered
severe burns.
   Moiseyev told Tass the liquefied gas explosion ``had the same
yield as a 10,000-ton bomb and was so powerful that it felled all
trees within 2.5 miles.'' He said the blast hurled two locomotives
and 38 passengers cars from the rails, with most of the cars
destroyed by a one-mile-long blaze. The total number of railroad
cars was not known.
   ``The picture I saw was terrifying, catastrophic,'' Dmitrin
said, reading from a correspondent's first-person account published
in his paper. ``The forest was practically burned to ashes by the
fire. Only blackened trunks of trees could be seen. But most
tragic, cars were blackened, twisted and even now exude a
suffocating stink.''
   A special Aeroflot flight brought 50 of the injured to Moscow
for medical care today. The wounded, their skin blistered and
peeling in places, were loaded on stretchers into waiting
ambulances.
   In Moscow, speaking to Congress, Gorbachev called for a minute
of silence and the 2,250 deputies stood to mourn the victims.
Gorbachev then recessed the session for a national day of mourning.
   The 58-year-old Soviet leader, in remarks from the Kremlin's
Palace of Congresses broadcast live on radio and television, said
the 1,153 mile-long pipeline burst a half mile from the rails.
   He said the liquefied petroleum gas poured down a slope toward
the tracks for three hours. Despite the leak, pumps were turned on
to compensate for the pressure loss.
   ``Everything started to accumulate, and when this mass reached
the level of electrical train contacts, a spark ignited this
condensed cloud,'' Gorbachev told the deputies.
   The two passenger trains _ traveling in opposite directions _
had made unscheduled stops near each other between the city of Ufa
and the town of Asha, 750 miles southeast of Moscow. One train was
on a siding, and the other was on the main tracks, the Soviet
president indicated.
   ``How could it be that again there is incompetence,
irresponsibility, mismanagement, disgrace? Comrades and I, and all
residents there, said there will be no progress if we have such
laxness,'' Gorbachev said.
   He said investigators would examine why the gas pump was turned
on despite the leak and why the two trains made unscheduled stops
at the same place.
   The busy railroad links the western, European part of the
country to the Asian region in the east. The trains were traveling
between Novosibirsk, the largest town in Siberia with a population
of 1.3 million, and Adler, a popular Black Sea resort.
   Gorbachev said among the victims was a group of children
traveling to southern resorts. Tass said 16 severely burned
children were taken to the town of Yuryuzan and that ``doctors are
struggling to save their lives.''
   ``The whole territory blew up. It was a real hell,'' Gorbachev
said Sunday in Chelyabinsk, the biggest city near the scene.
Television carried his remarks in a special late-night broadcast
Sunday.
   The television showed bloody and blackened faces and limbs of
victims. One boy lying on a stretcher in an ambulance at the
Chelyabinsk airport was so scarred the correspondent had to tell
viewers, ``He's living.''
   The film showed charred railroad cars without windows lying at
odd angles amid twisted tracks and protruding railroad ties. The
surrounding area was blackened and barren.
   The blast was so strong it shattered windows in a village seven
miles away, and incinerated dozens of acres of trees, television
said.
   It was the third major Soviet train accident in a year and added
to the disasters during Gorbachev's 4-year-old rule. They include
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion, the sinking of a
cruise ship and a nuclear-armed submarine, and the Armenian
earthquake.
   Sunday's accident was the worst in the Soviet Union since June
4, 1988, when nearly 100 people were killed as three trains loaded
with industrial explosives blew up in Arzamas, 240 miles east of
Moscow.
   In the most recent fatal train accident a freight train carrying
propane collided with another freight on May 20 in Soviet
Kazakhstan causing a fire and eplosion that killed five people and
destroyed factories and 13 houses.

   Q: Do you think that the events in China can have a chilling
effect on democratic reforms occurring in other communist
countries, particularly in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
when they look at the kind of uprising that is sparked in China?
   Bush: No. I think the moves that we're seeing in Eastern Europe
today, and indeed, in the Soviet Union, are going to go forward.
And I think people are watching more with horror, and saying,
``How, given this movement towards democracy, can the Chinese
leadership react in the way they have?''
   And so I think it's _ I think _ I think this may be a sign to
others around the world that people are _ are heroic when it comes
to their commitment to democratic change. And I would just urge the
Chinese leaders to recognize that.
   Last row here. We're going across, and that's it. Yes, Dave?
   Q: Mr. President, there are reports that the Chinese military is
badly divided, and that, for this crackdown, the authorities
brought in some troops from the Tibet conflict. If that's the case,
how does suspending our _ these military relationships _ encourage
any kind of change? I mean, could you explain what the point of
doing that is?
   Bush: I already did, David. You missed it. I explained it
because I want to keep it on the military side. I have expressed
here rhetorically the indignation we feel. I have recognized the
history of China moving into its own middle kingdom syndrome, as
it's done in various times in its past.
   And I want to encourage the things that have helped the Chinese
people, and I think now the suspension is going to send a strong
signal. I'm not saying it's going to cure the short-range problem
in China. I'm not sure any outside country can cure the
short-range, the today in Tiananmen Square problem.
   But I think it is very important that the Chinese leaders know
it's not going to be business as usual, and I think it's important
that the army know that we want to see restraint. And this is the
best way to signal that. Any others in there? Yes?
   Q: Mr. Bush, do you fear conflict? You talked about the
divisions within the Chinese army. Do you or your advisors fear
that there could actually be a civil conflict between army
commanders?
   Bush: Well, I don't want to speculate on that. But there are
differences, clearly, within the army in terms of use of force.
Otherwise, they wouldn't be doing what David Hoffman properly
pointed out is happening, units coming in from outside.
   And it is not, incidentally, just in Tiananmen Square that the
Chinese _ that this problem exists. It is in Shanghai, it's in
Chengdu today, it's in Guangzhou, I am told, in a much smaller
scale.
   But they brought the troops in from outside because the Beijing
troops apparently demonstrated a great sensitivity to the cause of
the young people, and were _ disciplined though they were, they
opted for the side of democracy and change in the young people.
   So those others came in, but I certainly don't want to speculate
on something that I don't have _ I can't reach that conclusion; put
it that way.
   Q: There were some news reports that some of the soldiers' units
had burned their own trucks. Have you received the same type of
intelligence reports?
   Bush: I think _ I just saw a speculation. I haven't got it on
any _ I don't believe the intelligence said that. But there are
reports that it is very difficult for some of these -- for some of
the military, who are much more sympathetic to the openness, to the
demonstrators.
   And I again go back to the original question here that Tom
asked. I think, with the change that's taken place so far, we're
beyond kind of a cultural revolution response. I think it _ I think
the depth of the feeling towards democracy is so great that you
can't put the genie back in the bottle and return to total
repression. And I think what we're seeing is the manifestation of
that in the divisions within the PLA.
   But I _ I certainly want to stop short of predicting a civil war
between units of the People's Liberation Army. Thank you all very
much.
   Q: How about Poland?
   Bush: I have a Cabinet meeting at 10:00.
   Q: What about Poland? What did you think of the elections?
   Bush: I think they were very interesting. We don't _ haven't
seen the final results, but communist bureaucrats beware in Poland.
It looks to me like there's quite a move moving towards this
freedom and democracy.

<HEAD>Court Says Group Does Not Own Sculpture's Copyright Exclusively</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a victory for artists
and authors, said today a homeless-rights group does not own
exclusively the copyright to a sculpture it commissioned an artist
to create.
   The 9-0 decision ordered further lower court hearings to
determine whether the Community for Creative Non-Violence (CCNV)
and its founder, Mitch Snyder, may share in the copyright of a work
entitled ``Third World America'' that depicts the plight of the
homeless.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said the
sculpture is a ``work made for hire'' and therefore its creator,
James Earl Reid of Baltimore, must at least share in the copyright.
   Marshall said CCNV did not become the copyright owner just
because it played an active role in designing the work and may
control its display. Reid is a free-lance artist, not an employee
of CCNV, he said.
   ``Transforming a commissioned work into a work by an employee on
the basis of the hiring party's right to control ... the work is
inconsistent with ... the work-for-hire provisions'' of a 1976
federal copyright law, Marshall said.
   CCNV, based in the nation's capital, decided in 1985 to
participate in the annual Christmas Pageant of Peace here by having
Reid help create a display dramatizing the plight of the homeless.
   Reid, using a synthetic substance tinted to resemble bronze,
scuplted two adult figures and a child huddled on a streetside
steam grate.
   The life-sized figures were intended as part of an updated
Nativity scene.
   CCNV provided a steam grate and pedestal for the work.
   Reid was paid $15,000 for expenses and for his assistants. He
donated his own services without charge.
   CCNV sent the entire sculpture back to Reid in January 1986 for
some repairs.
   The group planned to take the sculpture on a tour of several
cities to raise money for the homeless.
   But Reid objected to the tour because, he said, the sculpture
was too fragile. He urged CCNV to cast the work in bronze or make a
master mold that would withstand the tour.
   CCNV declined, but said Reid could do so if he wished.
   Two months later, Reid refused to return the sculpture and
registered it in his own name. He also said he planned to take the
work on a less ambitious exhibition tour.
   CCNV then filed a lawsuit claiming exclusive copyright ownership
of the sculpture.
   A federal judged ruled in favor of the organization. But the
U.S. Court of Appeals here overturned the judge's decision,
ordering further hearings in the dispute to determine whether CCNV
is entitled to share in the copyright.
   A group representing more than 100,000 artists and authors urged
the Supreme Court to uphold the appeals court decision.
   The reputation and income of free-lance artists depends on their
ability to own the copyrights of their works, the group said.
   The case is Community for Creative Non-Violence vs. Reid, 88-293.

<HEAD>South African, U.N. Officials Agree on Return of Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African and U.N. officials said
today they reached a tentative agreement to scrap discriminatory
laws in Namibia and clear the way for more than 40,000 Namibian
refugees to begin returning home.
   Officials said Pretoria agreed to abolish remaining
discriminatory laws in Namibia, end detentions without trial, and
provide amnesty for black nationalist guerrillas who have fought
for 23 years to oust South Africa from this mineral-rich territory.
   Louis Pienaar, South African-appointed administrator of Namibia,
and U.N. envoy Martti Ahtisaari reached the agreement on the
discriminatory laws last week, according to their spokesmen.
   South African President P.W. Botha was to sign legislation
enacting the accords today or Tuesday, the spokesmen said.
   ``With the signing by President Botha, the U.N. high
commissioner for refugees will be told immediately to start the
repatriation of refugees,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhardt.
   U.N. officials have registered 41,000 Namibian refugees in
Angola and Zambia who could start returning home early next week,
officials said.
   South Africa, which has ruled the territory for 74 years, agreed
to a U.N. independence plan that began April 1 and will lead to
November elections.
   Returning refugees will include members of the South-West Africa
People's Organization, which is widely favored to win the
elections. It is unclear, however, if the organization will be able
to capture the two-thirds majority necessary to control a new
government.
   Campaigning is to begin July 1, but none of the movement's
senior exiled leaders has returned.
   Several matters remain unresolved, including voter registration
procedures and the release of political prisoners. Pienaar and
Ahtisaari met today and will meet again to discuss these questions,
their spokesmen said.
   Namibian authorities say they hold 29 political prisoners, while
the guerrilla organization says authorities recently released 201
dissidents.
   More than 4,000 U.N. personnel are in Namibia to monitor the
transition to independence.
   Under the plan, South Africa has withdrawn 46,000 of its troops,
leaving less than 4,000 in Namibia. That number should be reduced
to 1,500 by June 20, the military said.
   Namibia's independence is part of a regional peace plan signed
by Pretoria in exchange for the removal of some 50,000 Cuban troops
helping Angola's government fight right-wing rebels backed by
Washington and Pretoria.

<HEAD>Judge Jails Three UMW Officials for Contempt of Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ordered three United
Mine Workers strike organizers jailed for violating his ban on
sit-down demonstrations designed to block coal delivery trucks.
   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams said his May 24 order
prohibiting the demonstrations against Pittston Coal Group had been
ignored, and found strike coordinators Marty Hudson, Jackie Stump
and C.A. Phillips in contempt of court. About 1,500 miners in
Virginia and West Virginia have been on strike against Pittston
since April 5, after a year of working without a contract.
   Evidence presented last week showed the three UMW officials
orchestrated the sit-down demonstrations in front of Pittston's
mines and coal plants, the judge said.
   The defendants, taking the 5th Amendment, declined to testify on
their own behalf, saying their statements might be used against
them in other strike-related court cases.
   Stump did tell the judge that he had tried everything he could
to make sure the strike remained peaceful and that he will continue
to do so.
   Williams told the three officials that they will remain in jail
until they promise to halt the illegal strike activity.
   ``The purpose of this hearing was to get obedience to my order,
in other words, undo what you have done,'' he said. ``The purpose
of sending you to jail is not to punish you but to make sure you
comply with my order.''
   On Friday, a state judge, Circuit Court Judge Donald McLaughlin,
fined the union $3 million for breaking his ban on mass picketing
and sit-down demonstrations in southwestern Virginia.

<HEAD>Suspected KGB Computer Hacker Apparently Commits Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOLFSBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German computer hacker
suspected of providing the Soviet KGB with code words to gain
access to Western research and defense computers apparently has
committed suicide, police said today.
   The body of a man found burned to death Thursday near the city
of Gifhorn, about 25 miles east of Hanover, has been identified as
that of Karl Koch, police said. Koch, 24, was under investigation
for his part in a computer scandal that resulted in international
headlines in March.
   Wolfsburg police said in a statement that Koch apparently doused
himself with gasoline and set himself on fire.
   A melted plastic gasoline canister was found near the body,
``and there were no signs of foul play from an outside source,''
the statement said.
   Koch was one of eight West German computer hackers under
investigation for allegedly supplying Soviet agents with code words
to gain access to Western computers. Those computers included the
U.S. Defense Department's general databank, known as Optimus, and a
NASA ``Star Wars'' research computer.
   Authorities said at the time that the hackers were believed to
have been recruited by the KGB, the Soviet intelligence agency, in
1985 and ``were paid in cash and drugs'' to provide the code words.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, confirmed today that Koch was one of the
hackers under investigation.
   ``We are still investigating the others and expect to file
charges when the probe is completed,'' Foerster said.
   Officials have said that while the code words allegedly provided
by the hackers gave the Soviets access to various computer
networks, they were not sufficient to gain access to classified
information.

   The death of Rep. Claude Pepper, whose
larger-than-life national status made his congressional seat
untouchable, has unleashed a frenzy of speculation and backroom
politicking over his replacement.
   Florida Republicans see an opportunity to bolster their new
majority in the state's congressional delegation by nominating and
electing the first Cuban-American representative.
   Democrats have promised to campaign under the banner of Pepper,
who had held the 18th District seat since its inception in 1962.
   The date of the special election will be set after today's
funeral for Pepper, who died Tuesday at age 88.
   ``It's sort of like a chess game,'' said Mayor Xavier Suarez,
who was busy last week trying to broker his political influence
with possible candidates in hopes of boosting his political capital.
   ``The alliances are shifting by the hour,'' Suarez said in
between phone calls. ``It's like an earthquake; a hole opens up and
then it gets filled in.''
   State GOP Chairman Van Poole and John Buckley, spokesman for the
Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, said the party
believes it can win the seat, which covers most of Miami and Miami
Beach and some suburban areas.
   But Dade County Democratic Chairman Simon Ferro said: ``As far
as we are concerned, this is going to be the Claude Pepper memorial
seat.''
   The Republican Party in Florida is coming off its most
successful election since Reconstruction.
   Besides giving George Bush his largest margin over Michael
Dukakis of any state in the presidential election _ nearly 1
million votes _ Florida elected Republican Connie Mack to replace
retired Democrat Sen. Lawton Chiles, won two congressional seats
from the Democrats and took a 10-9 lead in the delegation when
Democratic Rep. Bill Grant switched parties.
   Florida is expected to gain at least three congressional seats
after the 1990 census, and Democrats see the elections that year as
a watershed.
   ``We're on edge here,'' state Rep. Mike Abrams, a Democrat whose
district includes North Miami Beach. ``All the trend lines are
wrong. We need a win.''
   Pepper's district reflects the changes in Florida politics.
   When carved out for Pepper, who earlier had served 14 years in
the Senate, it was filled with retirees from the Northeat. The
percentage of voters calling themselves Democrats has dropped in a
decade from 72 percent to 54 percent. A little less than 50 percent
of residents are Hispanic, many of them Cuban exiles solidly behind
Presidents Reagan and Bush.
   Pepper won every 1980s election by a landslide and drew no
opposition last year. He was a holdover New Deal liberal who
adopted a tough anti-communist viewpoint.
   ``Claude Pepper transcended politics,'' said Miami Beach Mayor
Alex Daoud. ``He was just unique. ... He was not a politician, he
was a statesman.''
   Daoud, coming off a lopsided re-election victory in 1987, is
among the likely Democratic candidates to replace Pepper.
   Another is Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez. The Cuban-born mayor of
the 80 percent Hispanic city since 1981 said he wouldn't comment on
his plans until later this week.
   Other Democratic speculation has focused upon state Sen. Jack
Gordon, who shares most of Pepper's constituency and liberalism.
But Gordon, 67, may be hamstrung because of his opposition to U.S.
aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, whose cause is popular among local
Hispanics.
   The Republicans have several promising Hispanic politicians to
field.
   State Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Al Gutman, and state Sen.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen are among those mentioned most.
   Ros-Lehtinen's husband, U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, a Vietnam
War hero and former state legislator, had been considered a likely
candidate but has said lately he is content in his current job.

<HEAD>Nigerian President Vows to Continue Economic Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ibrahim Babangida on Monday said
he will not abandon his tough economic policies despite widespread
rioting caused by price increases.
   Speaking at the opening of the Armed Forces Consultive Assembly
in Nigeria's new capital, Babingida said there was no viable
alternative to the new economic program.
   Austerity measures instituted recently by the military
government were demanded by Western creditors and have led to sharp
price hikes for some basic goods and services.
   Those price increases touched off a violent student
demonstration at a university in the midwestern city of Benin on
May 24 and rioting spread to most of Nigeria last week.
   A Lagos newspaper, Punch, reported Sunday that 50 people had
died nationwide in six days of clashes between police and
demonstrators.

   Hungry seals and sea lions are dining on
salmon off Oregon and fish experts say residents are picking up the
check.
   Harbor seals and California sea lions have flourished since the
federal Marine Mammal Protection Act was adopted in 1972, but
Oregon fishemen say it's time to control the population.
   The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife estimates there are
5,000 to 7,000 harbor seals in state waters, double the population
in the mid-1970s. Biologists say the sea lion population has
increased by one-third since 1972.
   The seals and sea lions cruise the river estuaries for salmon
returning from the ocean to spawn.
   ``A seal eats about 25 pounds of fish a day,'' wildlife
biologist John Johnson says. ``If you multiply the number of seals
in the bay times 365 days a year, that's a staggering figure.''
   Tom Robinson, manager of the Oregon Salmon Commission, says each
10-pound chinook represents $75 to Oregon's economy, and each
five-pound coho represents $35.
   ``That's a fairly expensive meal,'' he says.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Search for De Soto's Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists planned to begin scouring
parts of northern Mississippi on Tuesday in search of the
16th-century trail of Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto and his
expedition's 1540-41 winter campsite.
   ``Our ultimate goal is to find the campsite,'' said University
of Mississippi archaeologist Jay Johnson, who will lead the team.
``And from that we could figure out a lot more about De Soto's
expedition, including the spot where he crossed the Tombigbee
River.''
   Some researchers think the crossing is between Aberdeen and the
site of the old Nashville Ferry, an area that includes Columbus.
   The campsite was the scene of a March 1541 battle in which
Chickasaw Indians destroyed much of the Spaniards' supply train and
killed 49 men. The Indians called the place ``Chicasa.''
   Researchers requested the help of a NASA airplane equipped with
infrared sensors in an effort to locate the campsite. The sensors
can detect heat differences between normal land and phosphate
deposits that characterize inhabited sites.
   ``But if we're going to do aerial surveys, we need to do them
before September,'' Johnson said. ``Once crops start coming in,
it's hard to see the ground, and we want to cover as much ground as
possible.''
   Johnson spoke Friday at the first meeting of the Mississippi De
Soto Commission at the Columbus Convention Center. The state
commission is one of 10 in the Southeast trying to pin down and
mark the path of De Soto's 1539-1542 explorations, which included
the first European sighting of the Mississippi River.
   ``We have the responsibility of erecting markers to signal the
exploration, and then planning events commemorating the
expedition,'' said Elbert Hilliard, director of the state
Department of Archives and History.
   ``We want to promote scholarly, archaeological and historical
research that results in more information on this expedition and
its impact on the history of our region,'' he said.
   The 34-member commission is funded by private donations, and
includes a representative from all eight state colleges.

<HEAD>New Program To Pay Private Insurance for AIDS Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA ZAGAROLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michigan hopes to save millions of dollars
with a new program designed to keep AIDS victims off the Medicaid
rolls by paying their private insurance premiums.
   The two-year pilot program, given final legislative approval
last week, is already being discussed by other states and likely
will be copied if it proves successful, said state Rep. David
Hollister.
   ``The program is aimed at someone who has a job, has insurance,
and at some point they lose their job because of their illness,''
said Hollister, who got the idea for the program while attending a
workshop of the National Academy of Science on insurance companies
and AIDS.
   ``They can continue their insurance for up to 18 months at their
own expense after they lose their job, but most people don't have
18 months of reserves to pay that,'' he said. ``So at a certain
point they're going to lose their insurance, and at that point they
become impoverished and we pay it out of Medicaid.''
   The cost of treating a person with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome in Michigan is about $1,600 a month. The state share of
Medicaid expenditures usually is about 45 percent, or $724.
   Insurance premiums vary with different policies; the average
cost of a health plan offered to state employees is about $135 a
month.
   If an AIDS patient becomes too sick to work and continue paying
insurance premiums, Medicaid could save about $1,465 a month per
person by paying the private insurance premium.
   The state predicts about 180 people will participate in the
program this year, saving the state about $323,000; 370 in 1990,
saving $2.6 million; and 580 in 1992, saving $4.1 million.
   It is scheduled to start Oct. 1 as a three-county experiment in
the metropolitan Detroit counties of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb,
which are home to about 70 percent of the state's AIDS-infected
population.
   ``The trickiest part is to make sure the state only pays the
premiums for the people who would have become Medicaid eligible,''
said Scott Merwin, a senior analyst with the Department of Social
Service's Medicaid division, who wrote the proposal with Hollister.
   Most people would become eligible for the program after they
have lost their jobs and their disability insurance has expired.
   Critics say that the plan takes into account only participants'
incomes, not assets, and that the largest growing population of
AIDS carriers _ intravenous drug users _ likely never had insurance
at all.
   Robert Lundy, legislative officer for the Michigan Organization
for Human Rights, a homosexual-lesbian group based in Detroit, said
he was pleased with the program but didn't think it went far
enough, noting it only covered three counties.
   The insurance industry, which has the most to lose with the
setup, has responded mildly.
   ``An in-force insurance policy is an in-force insurance policy.
If an AIDS patient borrows the money from Uncle Harry, that policy
is good,'' said Robert Waldron, director of the New York office of
the Health Insurance Association of America. The trade association
represents about 85 percent of the commercial health insurers in
the country.
   ``They're obliged to pay. That's the business they're in. In
fact, our advice has been, `Hang on to that insurance policy. Beg,
borrow, try not to steal, but hang on to that insurance policy.'
Why should we complain?'' Waldron asked.
   Even Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, which has to take
all comers regardless of illness, backs the idea.
   ``This seems to be a fairly restricted approach and it's aimed
at just those AIDS patients who have insurance already,'' said
Dennis Larson, public relations coordinator for the company. ``It
doesn't lead me down the road to believe the state's going to be
recruiting AIDS patients to get on insurance.''
   As of May 8, 1,120 cases of AIDS had been reported in Michigan
since 1981, and 650 of those patients had died. The Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta reported that as of April 30, there were
90,280 cases nationwide, and 54,402 of those people died.
   AIDS weakens the body's immune system and leaves it susceptible
to cancers and infections. It is transferred through the exchange
of body fluids, most often through sexual intercourse and sharing
contaminated hypodermic needle or syringes.

   The army's attack on pro-democracy demonstrators
has thrown the Chinese capital into chaos. Most public
transportation is suspended, soldiers patrol the streets and food
shortages are developing.
   The army's unexpectedly brutal attacks on students and their
sympathizers during the weekend, and soldiers' continuing rampage
through the streets of Beijing, have disrupted normal life.
   ``All we have to eat are instant noodles, and the only way we
can get anywhere is by bicycle,'' said a worker in his 30s.
   Lines already are forming for such staples as milk, oil, salt,
soy sauce and coal gas for cooking. With the military's blockade of
major access roads to Beijing, suppliers are finding it difficult
if not impossible to enter the city, and fruits, vegetables and
meat have increased 40-50 percent in price.
   Tens of thousands of soldiers stormed Tiananmen Square Saturday
night and early Sunday to disperse student-led protesters who had
occupied the square since May 13. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were
believed shot, beaten or crushed to death.
   Soldiers periodically charge out from the square with their guns
blazing. At least eight people were reported shot Monday, three
fatally.
   There have been scattered calls for a general strike. But with
People's Liberation Army soldiers roaming the streets and firing
randomly at buildings and people, few are showing up at their jobs
anyway.
   ``What are we going to do, go to work and get shot?'' asked an
office clerk.
   ``We have no guarantee for the safety of our lives,'' said a
36-year-old Communist Party official. ``We don't want to overthrow
the government, but we never thought the government could be so
inhumane.''
   A senior at Beijing's No. 65 High School joined the chorus.
``We're afraid to walk the streets,'' he said. ``We never know when
some plainclothes policeman or a soldier will shoot us in the
back.''
   With nowhere to go, people are streaming onto the streets
despite the danger, to share what they've seen and heard, gawk at
bullet holes and vent their outrage at the government for ordering
the slaughter.
   ``What we need are United Nations peacekeeping forces here,'' a
40-year-old man said. ``They would be warmly welcomed.''
   A senior from Beijing Commercial College complained the citywide
disruption could keep her from graduating. ``There's no way I can
do research for my senior thesis,'' she said.
   Changan Avenue, Beijing's main road, was strewn with discarded
shoes, chunks of bricks, gutted remains of burnt-out buses and
mangled traffic dividers crushed by tanks.
   The gates were locked at the Beijing Hotel, two blocks from
Tiananmen, and guests had to climb over them to get inside. At the
posh International Hotel, also on Changan Avenue, one worker said
only 30 percent of the staff was on duty.
   ``I've been working for 48 hours straight since there's no staff
to relieve me,'' he said. The hotel was only serving cheese and ham
sandwiches, he said.
   A receptionist at the Capital Hotel, also near the square, said
there were no guests left and that employees were staying at the
hotel because they were afraid to go home.
   The Mengchuan Restaurant, a small place facing the wide
thoroughfare, closed Saturday after the troops entered the square.
   A few workers showed up nevertheless, spending their time
watching tanks go by.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Tougher for Minorities To Prove On-The-Job Discrimination</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: INSERTS 2 grafs after penultimate graf pvs bgng, `the companies,'
to UPDATE with breakdown of justices' vote on bias case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today dealt a blow to
minorities who say they are victims of on-the-job discrimination,
making it easier for employers to refute claims of racial bias
based on statistical evidence.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices overturned a ruling that favored
Filipinos, Alaska natives and Asians employed at Alaska salmon
canneries.
   The justices ordered further lower court hearings in the case.
   In a sharply worded dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
ruling ``retreats'' from 18 years of court decisions aimed at
helping minorities who are victimized by discrimination that may be
unintentional.
   He said the court was ``turning a blind eye to the meaning and
purpose'' of the principles underlying the federal Civil Rights Act
of 1964 outlawing workplace discrimination. ``The changes the
majority makes today, tipping the scales in favor of employers, are
not faithful to those principles,'' he said.
   Today's ruling said when minorities allege that statistics show
they are victims of bias, employers only have the burden of
producing evidence that there is a legitimate reaon for apparently
neutral business practices.
   The burden of proving the practice is non-discriminatory _ of
persuading a jury there is no bias _ does not shift to the
employer, Justice Byron R. White said for the court.
   ``The plaintiff bears the burden of disproving an employer's
assertion that the adverse employment action or practice was based
solely on a legitimate neutral consideration,'' White said.
   Furthermore, the court limited the statistical evidence that
minorities can use to prove discrimination.
   White said an absence of minority group members in skilled jobs
is not evidence of bias if the absence reflects ``a dearth of
qualified non-white applications for reasons that are not (the
employer's) fault.''
   Also, he continued, the minority groups must show that any
under-representation in a job category must be caused by specific
business practices that are under attack.
   White said that without such protection for employers their only
recourse to eliminate racial imbalance intheir work forces would be
unlawful quotas.
   In other actions today, the Supreme Court:
   _Dealt a significant defeat to the Church of Scientology, ruling
in a 5-2 decision that contributions, called ``fixed donations,''
to the church by its members may not be claimed as federal income
tax deductions.
   The court upheld the Internal Revenue Service's contention that
the donations are not charitable contributions and rejected
arguments that denying tax deductions for the fixed donations
violates the religious freedom of Scientologists and creates an
impermissible denominational preference.
   _Upheld the murder conviction and death sentence of Texas inmate
Philip Tompkins, but left unresolved in its 4-4 decision a key
question on how difficult it should be for prosecutors to prove
they did not exclude potential jurors because of their race.
   Tompkins, who is black, was convicted by an all-white jury of
the 1981 slaying of Mary D. Berry in Houston. The prosecutor used
peremptory challenges to reject all 13 prospective jurors who were
black.
   _Cleared the way for trial of a government lawsuit against junk
bond specialist Michael Milken and removed a major obstacle to a
$650 million payment by his former employer to investors and the
federal treasury.
   The court, without comment, rejected Milken's appeal to
disqualify the federal judge presiding over the cases, U.S.
District Judge Milton Pollack in New York City. Milken and two
co-defendants contended that Pollack has an apparent conflict of
interest because his wife is receiving $30 million from the sale of
a corporation in which Milken's former employer, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., helped set up the financing.
   _Left intact a 1986 federal law that generally prohibits
Medicare patients from using their own money to pay for an
assistant surgeon in eye cataract operations.
   A group of medicare patients in New York and California and eye
doctors and their professional associations in the two states had
contended that the law violates constitutional privacy and liberty
protections.
   _Ruled that a homeless-rights group, the Community for Creative
Non-Violence, does not own exclusively the copyright to a sculpture
it commissioned an artist to create.
   The 9-0 decision _ a victory for artists and authors _ ordered
further lower court hearings to determine whether CCNV and its
founder, Mitch Snyder, may share in the copyright of a work by
sculptor James Earl Reid of Baltimore entitled ``Third World
America'' that depicts the plight of the homeless.
   The bias case stems from discrimination charges against Wards
Cove Packing Co. Inc. of Seattle, Wash., and Castle &amp; Cooke Inc of
Astoria, Ore.
   The companies operate salmon canneries in remote areas of Alaska
during the summer salmon run.
   Non-whites say that while they hold nearly half the jobs at the
canneries, the jobs are racially stratified with whites dominating
in higher-paying positions such as machinists, carpenters and
administrative slots.
   The cannery companies said any racial divisions are caused by
legitimate business reasons.
   For example, they said most higher-paying jobs require skill and
prior experience that it is difficult for non-whites to acquire
because they are seasonal workers from remote regions of Alaska.
   The companies said statistics showing non-whites holding most of
the lower-paying seasonal cannery worker jobs and fewer better
positions do not prove discrimination.
   The high court today agreed. White said the proper comparison is
between the racial composition of the skilled jobs and the racial
composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor
market.
   The companies said the Pacific Northwest labor market that
provides workers for the higher-ranking jobs is only 10 percent
non-white. The companies say they filled these more desirable jobs
with more than 20 percent non-whites.
   Joining White were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Joining Stevens in dissent were Justices William J. Brennan,
Harry A. Blackmun and Thurgood Marsahall.
   The case is Wards Cove vs. Atonio, 87-1387.

   Two of Iran's bitterest foes, Iraq and Israel, today hoped for
closer ties with the fundamentalist Islamic state in their first
official reaction to the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   President Bush said, ``There's a way for Iran's relationship
with the United States to improve and that's for the release of the
American hostages.'' India proclaimed three days of mourning, and
the pope spoke of Khomeini's impact on the world. Iranian exiles in
the United States danced in the streets.
   ``Iraq is looking only for a comprehensive peace with Iran based
on strong relations,'' the Iraqi state daily Al-Thawra said,
referring to deadlocked peace negotiations since an Aug. 20
cease-fire that ended their eight-year war. But Al-Thawra's
commentary also called Khomeini a ``grudge-bearing tyrant'' and
described Iran as ``disunited and confused.''
   Iran's revolutionary patriarch died Sunday after suffering a
heart attack while recovering from stomach surgery. He was 86.
   Israel said it wants post-Khomeini Iran to renew formerly
friendly ties ruptured by the revolution. Government spokesman Avi
Pazner said Israel hopes for ``an ensuing future improvement in
relations.''
   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Allon Liel called ``a little
premature'' a newspaper report that Israel is seeking a dialogue
with the new regime.
   The Kuwait Times echoed a hope expressed by many of Iran's Arab
neighbors: that the new leadership will bring peace and ``guarantee
permanent stability in the region.''
   In India, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government declared
three days of state mourning, canceling official entertainment and
ordering flags flown at half-staff. ``May the Iranian people and
the bereaved family have courage and fortitude to bear this
irreparable loss,'' Gandhi said in a message.
   Pope John Paul II, speaking in Helsinki, said: ``It is necessary
to state with great respect and with deep reflection his impact on
his country and a considerable part of the world.''
   Governments of most Persian Gulf states sent polite cables of
condolence to Tehran but refrained from public comment on the death
of the man many of them held responsible for a decade of regional
instability.
   Oman was the only country among the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council to announce it is sending a delegation to the funeral
Tuesday.
   The council groups Oman with Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the six countries directly in
the firing line of Khomeini's pledge to export his fundamentalist
brand of Islam.
   Saudi Arabia, the country with a particular grudge against
Khomeini's repeated attempts to politicize the annual pilgrimage to
Mecca, did not immediately send a cable of condolence.
   In Lebanon, the only country outside Iran where Khomeini's
fundamentalism won a beachhead, 75,000 Shiite Moslem mourners
processed through west Beirut chanting: ``Israel, Israel is our big
enemy! America, America is the great satan! Death to Israel! Death
to America!''
   It is unclear whether Khomeini's death will affect the 15
foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, most by pro-Iranian extremists.
The hostages include AP correspondent Terry A. Anderson and eight
other Americans.
   In the United States, the Iranian leader's death prompted both
mourning and celebration. Wearing red, the Iranian color of
celebration, 1,000 Iranian exiles danced for joy, chanting ``Death
to Khomeini! Long live Iran!''
   ``The Iranians have gathered here in Los Angeles to congratulate
each other and resolve to work harder to overthrow the regime of
the mullahs in Iran,'' said Habib Momayez, a former professor at
Tehran University.
   Also on the West Coast, members of the Islamic Center of
Southern California dedicated their noontime prayers to Khomeini,
praised by many for the 1979 revolution that deposed the late Shah
of Iran and established the rule of Islamic Shiites in the Middle
Eastern nation.

   Every day after lunch, the robed, turbaned man with eyes like
nuggets of coal would pick his way across a French village lane and
address the faithful from the top of a flight of steps.
   From the young men mustered at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
feet would arise a shout that has since become part of the
international political language:
   ``Allahu aqbar! Allahu aqbar! Allahu aqbar!''
   Then, after the last chant of those Arabic words for ``God is
great,'' Khomeini would shuffle back to his little cottage, and the
war against the Shah of Iran would continue.
   Neauphle-le-Chateau, a village 20 miles outside Paris, seemed an
unlikely place from which to orchestrate a revolution thousands of
miles away.
   Khomeini had moved there in September 1978 after 15 years of
exile in Iraq. With unrest mounting in his kingdom, the shah wanted
the Ayatollah as far away as possible, and he had persuaded his
Iraqi neighbors to expel him and the French to give him asylum.
   It was a mistake. Neauphle-le-Chateau meant access to
international telephones and the world media, and these were to
play a critical role in the revolution.
   At first, only a handful of supporters gathered at
Neauphle-le-Chateau _ Abolhassan Bani Sadr, future president of the
Islamic republic, and Sadegh Ghotbzadeh and Ibrahim Yazdi, both
foreign ministers-in-waiting.
   Khomeini lived with his family in the cottage while the
revolutionaries set up operations across the street in a larger
house. On warm days Khomeini would sit under a tree and answer
questions from his followers.
   Khomeini was a healthy, alert 76. His lifestyle was spartan:
rough blankets to keep out the cold in the unheated cottage; an
apple and a bowl of bean soup for lunch; no television.
   His most compelling feature was his eyes, burning out from under
glowering black eyebrows that seemed to freeze his face into a
permanent frown.
   His message, delivered in a calm, low monotone, never changed:
the shah must be tried by Islamic judges as a mass murderer;
America was corrupt, Western influence destructive; he would soon
go back to Iran and set up an Islamic republic, governed by Islamic
law. It was only a matter of time. It was Allah's will.
   As the uprising in Iran spread, Neauphle-le-Chateau filled up
with Iranian exiles from all over Europe. They packed the little
garden outside the operations cottage to overflowing.
   Everything Khomeini said in his daily homily was tape recorded
and played over the phone to supporters in Iran who would rerecord
the speech and circulate it clandestinely.
   A blue-and-white tent was set up for prayers. More phones were
installed, and a tape-duplicating machine arrived, so that
Khomeini's words could reach Iran even faster.
   Striking Iranian telephone operators in Iran would take calls
only from Neauphle-le-Chateau.
   Bearded mullahs manned the phones while Westernized Iranian
intellectuals sought out reporters to tell them about the liberal,
Islam-based constitutional democracy that would arise once the shah
was gone.
   The growing number of reporters churned the garden into mud.
Like a hall of mirrors, Khomeini fed the media and the media fed
Khomeini. The French weekly l'Express published a cover photo of
Khomeini above the caption: ``The man who makes the world
tremble.'' The next day a huge blowup of the cover hung on the
cottage wall.
   On Jan. 16, the shah left Iran and in Neauphle-le-Chateau plans
were made for Khomeini's homecoming.
   But no airline would carry the party to Tehran for fear the
plane would be shot down. So Khomeini chartered a Boeing. It had to
carry extra fuel in case it was forced to return, and only half its
normal passenger load was permitted.
   At a table under a tree, scores of journalists and Khomeini
supporters lined up in darkness and freezing rain and paid wads of
cash for one-way tickets to Tehran.
   It was the final seal on the surreal, often chaotic spectacle
that had been unfolding in the little French village in the
preceding weeks.
   Bani Sadr looked elated. He would soon become president, then be
brought down and forced to return to Paris, an exile again.
   Ghotbzadeh told a reporter he hoped to see him again in Tehran.
He would end up slain as Khomeini's revolution devoured its own
children.

   For Judge Cynthia Hall, a vacation is a month
in Malaysia watching birds. For Judge Richard Cudahy, investments
earn enough in a year to pay the salaries of all nine Supreme Court
justices _ perhaps twice over.
   They are two of the nation's several dozen, or more, millionaire
federal judges. An Associated Press study of 935 financial
disclosure reports by federal judges found at least 62 and possibly
as many as 176 millionaires.
   Exact numbers cannot be determined, because the disclosure forms
value most assets and income within wide numerical ranges rather
than in exact dollar amounts.
   Among the 62 certain millionaires are names familiar to many
Americans:
   _Lewis F. Powell, Jr., 81, retired Supreme Court justice, with
investment holdings between $1.7 million and $3.2 million. Powell
now sits as a senior judge on circuit courts.
   _Circuit Judge James L. Buckley, 66, a former New York senator
and the brother of columnist-talk show host William Buckley, put
his holdings between $1.4 million and $2.9 million.
   _Circuit Judge Clement F. Haynsworth Jr., 76, nominated
unsuccessfully by Richard Nixon to the Supreme Court in 1969, had
holdings between $2.8 million and $4.6 million.
   _District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, 78, who presided over Oliver
North's Iran-Contra case, had holdings between $1 million and $1.3
million.
   Many of the judges made their money in private practice before
becoming judges; others inherited great wealth. Some, such as
senior Circuit Judge Bailey Aldrich of Massachusetts, did both. He
practiced law for 22 years and is a member of one of America's old,
wealthy families.
   Aldrich reported an investment portfolio of between $2.9 million
and $5.1 million.
   Aldrich, who at 82 still works full time eight months a year,
believes judges need a pay raise. ``If you want to get good judges,
you've got to pay something not too far below what the judge would
earn if he was working as a lawyer,'' he said. ``One of the big
problems is that judges get paid the same whether they're in
Massachusetts or Wyoming. A judge in Massachusetts is grossly
underpaid; a judge in New York is more than grossly underpaid.''
   Other judges were more reluctant to discuss their wealth or the
30 percent raise which the federal judges have demanded since
Congress rejected a 51 percent raise for them Feb. 7. Judges'
minimum $89,500 salaries already place them in the top 1 percent of
Americans.
   ``I never discuss the economics of being a judge,'' said Cudahy,
perhaps the richest judge in America. A member of the 7th Circuit
Court of Appeals in Illinois, Cudahy said, ``I just don't think
that I'm terribly representative.''
   Heir to a Milwaukee meatpacking concern which he ran for 11
years, the 63-year-old Cudahy reported holdings worth at least $8.4
million and perhaps more than $16.1 million. He has large bond
holdings as well as an extensive stock portfolio; he lists 12
separate assets as worth ``over $250,000.''
   Cudahy's investment income was at least $1.1 million and
possibly more than $2.5 million. By comparison, the Supreme Court
gets an aggregate annual salary of $995,000.
   Judge Hall of the 9th Circuit Court in California is a former
Tax Court judge and is the widow of a prominent tax attorney. At
60, she reported holdings of at least $2.4 million and as much as
$5.8 million.
   Fond of travel to Asia, she said in a 1985 interview that she
had worried five years earlier when her husband died whether she
could afford to educate her son and four stepchildren and stay on
the bench. She sent her son to an East Coast boarding school and
``decided we could make it financially if we reduced our standard
of living.''
   She declined to be interviewed about the pay raise because,
according to a clerk, ``she'd prefer not to discuss it with the
press. She just doesn't think it's appropriate.''
   It's certain there are more than 62 millionaires because the
disclosure forms understate wealth. The value of the judges' homes
and some other assets are not reported at all.
   In addition, the AP study did not count the assets and income of
spouses and dependent children. The AP analyzed the forms of the
935 judges who worked at least 60 days during 1987, the most recent
year with a complete set of forms.
   Among the potential millionaires, her wealth somewhat obscured
by the reporting rules, is Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, 59. Her holdings were reported between $730,000 and $1.1
million. If her husband's assets were counted, those figures would
be $545,000 to $995,000 higher. Even then, any equity they have in
a $660,000 suburban home remains unreported.
   No other active Supreme Court justice reported holdings even
close to $1 million.
   Among the 62 certain millionaires, the average age is 64.6 years.
   All but four are men. The women, in addition to Hall, are Helen
W. Nies of Washington, D.C., Karen Henderson of South Carolina and
Maryanne Trump Barry of New Jersey. Barry, who estimated her
holdings between $1.8 million and $2.3 million, is the sister of
New York real estate magnate Donald Trump.
   South Carolina, with at least six and possibly seven
millionaires among 13 federal judges, has by far the highest
proportion.
   Ten states have none of the certain or likely millionaires:
Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.

   Two years after the courts declared her
the illegitimate daughter of the late country legend Hank Williams,
Jett Williams made her professional debut as a country singer.
   Ms. Williams, 36, was given a standing ovation Sunday at the
16th annual Hank Williams Memorial Celebration when she opened her
20-minute performance with her father's ``Your Cheatin' Heart.''
   ``I'd like to tell you it's great to be back in Alabama,'' she
told the crowd of about 4,000. ``I'm meeting a lot of people who
knew my father, and I'm getting to know him through them.''
   Ms. Williams, who wore a belt buckle with her father's picture,
also performed ``Hey, Good Lookin''' by Williams, one of her own
works called ``Baby Blues'' and a poem by Milton Brown, ``Conceived
in Love,'' which chronicles her legal battle for recognition as
Williams' daughter.
   She was born in Montgomery in 1953, five days after her father
died on Jan. 1. Williams had lived with, but never married, her
mother. In 1987, a Montgomery judge ruled Ms. Williams she was the
singer's daughter but that under Alabama law she could not inherit
from his estate.
   Ms. Williams still has other suits pending in an attempt to
share the estate with her half brother, country singer Hank
Williams Jr.

   Peter Fonda is working on a book about
his life, but the actor promises it won't be a ``kiss and tell''
saga of the Fonda family.
   Fonda, best known for his role in the counterculture classic
``Easy Rider,'' is the son of Henry Fonda and the younger brother
of Jane Fonda. He said although the book will talk about his family
it will focus on his own life, especially during the turbulent '60s.
   Fonda, 50, who has lived in Montana's Paradise Valley for 14
years, said he began the '60s with the ``perfect Dwight Eisenhower
image'' and came out of it as ``Captain America on top of an
outrageous chopper.''
   Fonda told the Livingston Enterprise in a recent interview that
he has already begun the book and hopes to see it in stores by next
June. The book is being published by Delacorte-Dell.

   Edie Brickell and New Bohemians wrapped up their
U.S. tour with a Dallas homecoming before heading off for Europe.
   A capacity crowd cheered the six-member band during a
performance Friday night at the 2,400-seat Bronco Bowl. ``This is
weird being back home and being here,'' said Ms. Brickell. ``But
it's great to be back. We're excited.''
   The group, which got its start in clubs in Dallas' stylish Deep
Ellum neighborhood, left Sunday for Europe, where it will open for
Bob Dylan during his overseas tour.
   New Bohemians' debut album, ``Shooting Rubberbands at the
Stars,'' has sold 2 million copies since its release last summer.
The group's first single, ``What I Am,'' reached Billboard's Top 10.
   The Dallas performance concluded the band's three-month tour
through 65 U.S. cities.

   Queen Mother Elizabeth was honored Monday
on the 10th anniversary of her installation as Lord Warden of the
Cinque Ports, an ancient but no longer arduous post.
   She has the dubious privilege as royal beachcomber of claiming
any flotsam or jetsam washed up on England's southeast coast. She
is also obliged to pay for the burial of stranded whales.
   Cinque Ports, from the French for five ports, is the title given
to five coastal towns in southeast England that formerly had
special privileges as ports. The Confederation of the Cinque Ports,
which honored the mother of Queen Elizabeth II on the anniversary,
was formed during the 11th century to furnish ships and sailors for
the monarch.
   The queen mother is the 160th Lord Warden and the first woman to
hold the appointment.

exhaustion, the team said Monday.
   Anderson, 55, left the team May 19 and returned Sunday night to
Detroit from his home in Thousand Oaks, Calif. The team's
physician, Dr. Clarence Livingood, said Anderson needed a break
from a hectic schedule of appearances, endorsements and other
non-baseball activites.
   Tigers spokesman Greg Shea said Anderson would be managing
Monday night's game against the Boston Red Sox. ``He will be in

   A judge today issued a divorce decree for a
Methodist minister who said he wanted to end his marriage to his
paralyzed wife of 32 years so she could afford nursing care.
   ``Our system is such that we must impoverish people so they can
afford necessary nursing care,'' lawyer Virginia Johnson said after
Lancaster County Judge Paul Merritt issued the decree for the Rev.
Lincoln B. Justice and his wife, Rose Marie.
   ``This is not uncommon,'' said Johnson, who represented Mrs.
Justice, 56.
   After Mrs. Justice was paralyzed from the neck down in an
automobile accident 10 years ago, the couple had a specially
designed wheelchair-accessible home built and coped using homemaker
services.
   But Justice told Merritt today that his wife's bout with
pneumonia in January left her in need of 24-hour care.
   ``I can't work and provide that care,'' Justice said.
   Under a property settlement approved by the court, Mrs. Justice
will remain in the Lincoln home. Justice told reporters he expects
to live in Weeping Water, where he has been transferred, and visit
his ex-wife about once a week. The town is about 35 miles away.
   ``Financial reasons were the main stress in this marriage,''
Johnson said. ``Rather than impoverish both husband and wife, this
will allow her to spend down her assets, remain in her home and be
eligible for Medicaid.''
   Johnson said that if the couple had remained married, Medicaid
rules would handicap Justice to the point he wouldn't be able to
work. The rules also keep Mrs. Justice, who wants to live at home,
from qualifying for some benefits she would get if she were
institutionalized.
   The couple plan to have a divorce ceremony at Trinity United
Methodist Church on Sunday and will be ask those present to bless
their divorce. Justice said the ceremony will help people
understand the way the two feel about the situation and dramatize
their criticism of the nation's health care system.

   President Ali Khamenei is Iran's
caretaker leader, but the true successor to the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini has yet to be chosen.
   The transfer of power may be resolved Aug. 18, when a
presidential election is scheduled in tandem with a referendum on
constitutional changes aimed at eliminating a system of competitive
power centers that has snarled decision-making.
   Khamenei, 49, was chosen Sunday by the 83-member assembly formed
after Khomeini's fundamantalist Shiite Moslem revolution in 1979 to
determine the succession and write the new constitution.
   Khamenei acknowledged his temporary role and said that, when the
constitutional changes have been ratified, ``we should be able to
fill the vacuum'' caused by Khomeini's death.
   Reports from Tehran indicate Iran will have a collective
leadership of three to five men in the absence of a single figure
with Khomeini's religious and political authority.
   In order for that to happen, the 20-member committee Khomeini
assigned to reform the constitution will have to change the
religious requirements for leadership to allow lower-ranking
figures to participate.
   Most analysts believe the power struggle of rival factions and
leaders will intensify.
   Here are sketches of the main candidates for a collective
leadership:
   _Hashemi Rafsanjani: The 55-year-old speaker of parliament, a
middle-ranking cleric, also is military commander-in-chief.
Rafsanjani is a member of the Supreme Defense Council, deputy
chairman of the Assembly of Experts and sits on other important
bodies.
   He is a skilled political operator with a wide power base that
includes parliament and the Revolutionary Guards Corps, and leads
the so-called pragmatists in the hierarchy.
   With Khamenei's support, Rafsanjani sought to improve relations
with the West and end Iran's isolation. He was a key figure in
persuading Khomeini to accept the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire that
halted fighting in the 8-year-old war with Iraq last August.
   Rafsanjani and his allies were set back by the radical
resurgence that followed the outcry over Salman Rushdie's novel,
``The Satanic Verses.'' He is the only declared candidate for
president.
   _Ali Akbar Mohtashemi: The interior minister, 43, is among the
most radical hardliners. As ambassador to Syria in 1981-1985, he
was closely linked to the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party
of God, in Lebanon and considered by Western Intelligence to have
masterminded suicide bombings of American, French and Israeli
targets.
   He heads much of Iran's security apparatus and appointed most of
the 24 provincial governors.
   _Hussein Musavi: The prime minister, 48, is a radical who has
led the government since 1981. He sits on the 12-member Council of
Guardians, which is dominated by conservatives and oversees all
legislation, and is a member of a special Expediency Council
appointed by Khomeini in 1988 to resolve differences between the
parliament and Council of Guardians.
   Musavi been criticized, mainly for economic policy, but survived
three confidence votes, largely through Khomeini's support. He is
opposed by conservative clerics and the business class but has the
support of powerful hard liners.
   _Ayatollah Ali Meshkini: The radical chairman of the Assembly of
Experts, 66, is a ranking Islamic jurist and leader of sabbath
prayers in the holy city of Qom, which gives him an important
platform. He is the father-in-law of Intelligence Minister Mohammad
Mohammadi Rey-Shahri, another major hardliner.
   _Musavi Khoeiniha: The prosecutor-general, 47, is anti-Western
and known as ``the red mullah'' because he studied at Patrice
Lumumba University in Moscow and Leipzig University in East Germany.
   He was removed as head of the pilgrimage bureau for inciting
pilgrims visiting the shrines of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia
to violence and to spread Iran's revolution.
   Khoeiniha was the political leader of student ``followers of the
imam's line'' who stormed the U.S. Embassy in 1979. He is a leading
member of the Society of Combatant Clergymen, a powerful radical
group, and supports Hezbollah, which is considered an umbrella for
Shiites holding most of the Western hostages in Lebanon.
   _Ahmad Khomeini: The late patriarch's son, 43, has wielded
considerable political influence behind the scenes. He holds no
office, but controlled access to his increasingly reclusive father
and now is making an open bid for power. He formerly was allied
with Rafsanjani, but now is aligned with Mohtashemi and the hard
liners.
   Mohammad Mohammadi Rey-Shahri: The 43-year-old intelligence
minister has emerged as a powerful figure in recent years. He is a
middle-ranking cleric allied with Mohtashemi and the hard liners
opposed to Rafsanjani, and formerly served as a judge in the
military revolutionary tribunals.
   _Ayatollah Abdulkarim Musavi Ardebili: The chief justice, 63, is
a centrist and member of the special assembly appointed by Khomeini
in 1988 to resolve differences between the parliament and Council
of Guardians.

   Chinese wearing black armbands of mourning are
streaming to hospitals and university campuses that have been
turned into makeshift memorial halls in honor of China's newest
martyrs.
   Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people are believed to have been
gunned down during the weekend by Chinese troops ordered to clear
Tiananmen Square of students demanding a freer society and less
corruption by their Communist rulers.
   Several dead were taken to Fuxing Hospital in Muxudi, site of
the massacre that began the siege of Beijing late Saturday night.
   By Sunday, the narrow alley leading to the hospital entrance was
jammed with people coming to view nearly two dozen victims whose
bodies were strewn in two hospital rooms for friends or family
members to identify.
   Thousands of mourners quietly filed through the rooms, quickly
placing handkerchiefs over their noses against the overpowering
stench of formaldehyde.
   Gaping bullet holes were clearly visible on most of the bodies.
Some faces were so disfigured that mourners had to pull back the
blood-soaked sheets covering the bodies to search for clues to make
a positive identification.
   Most of the victims were men in their 20s and 30s. One had
quickly been dressed in a gray suit and red tie, while the others
still had on the torn clothes of the night of the massacre.
   ``I want to cry,'' said a shaken woman as she peered into the
room from a dirty window.
   ``If we had guns, we'd get back at them,'' fumed a 40-year-old
worker after viewing the bodies.
   By Monday, many Beijing residents were wearing black armbands in
honor of the students and their supporters who died.
   The names of victims were read over the loudspeaker system at
Beijing University. Large banners and posters honoring the dead
went up at all major schools.
   ``A generation of brave heroes will go down in the annals of
history,'' read a black-draped banner across the main gate at
Beijing Normal University, one of the major centers of the
pro-democracy movement.
   Funeral music blared from loudspeakers in front of the Central
Academy of Minorities, where a black banner with the photograph of
a fallen student was strung.
   Across the street, an even larger black banner was put up above
the entrance to the Beijing Medical University Stomatological
Hospital. White flowers, a traditional Chinese sign of mourning,
were draped on trees and the main gate.
   Students at Political Science and Law University turned the
foyer of a classroom building into a memorial hall, where they
placed a bloodied and disfigured body of a dead classmate.
   A steady stream of students and residents filed through the
building's large front doors, which were flanked by huge banners
reading: ``An eternal injustice'' and ``Tragic beyond compare in
this human world.''
   The body lay on a table just to the left of the entrance. Huge
chunks of ice were scattered around the body to slow decomposition.
   ``I've come to grieve over the students who died,'' said a
middle-aged worker as he emerged from the building.
   After seeing the body, a trembling 24-year-old woman could only
berate the government that ordered the murderous attack.
   ``The Chinese government is crazy. They've gone way too far,''
she said.

   The political fallout from the death of
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is likely to prolong the
captivity of Western hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
extremists in Lebanon.
   Most of the 15 captives, including nine Americans, are held by
factions believed controlled by Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's
main Lebanese ally.
   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
has tried in vain to keep his party out of the power struggle
between rival factions in Tehran for supremacy in the post-Khomeini
era.
   Hezbollah militants, backed by some 3,000 Iranian Revolutionary
Guards based in the ancient Roman city of Baalbek in eastern
Lebanon, have sided with Iran's hardliners led by Interior Minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, according to Shiite sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Yet the party's political leadership in Beirut's southern slums,
Hezbollah's main power base, is aligned with Tehran's so-called
pragmatists, led by Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, the
sources said.
   Rafsanjani holds Hezbollah's purse strings.
   ``No one can tell how badly this split will reflect on the
hostages, but it's going to be bad,'' said one source close to
Fadlallah.
   ``There's going to be no way for quite a while to break the
deadlock shrouding their case,'' said the source.
   Much will depend on who emerges as the victor in the Tehran
power play. But that could take months.
   The Bush administration ``will have to sit tight and wait for
the dust of the Tehran power struggle to settle before it can make
any move on the hostages,'' the source said.
   President Bush said today in Washington he is unsure what will
happen in Iran now that Khomeini has died. But he added, ``There's
a way for Iran's relationship with the United States to improve and
that's for the release of the American hostages'' being held in
Lebanon.
   There has been no word on the hostages since the latest round of
fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war broke out March 8.
   Hezbollah and the rival pro-Syrian Amal militia has stayed out
of the battles, which pit Syrian against Christian forces. Many in
Beirut believe the Shiites' role on the sidelines has minimized the
risk that the hostages would be hit in shelling that has killed 360
people and wounded more than 1,400.
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York made a three-day visit to
Lebanon two weeks ago to refocus attention on the hostages.
However, he left empty-handed after his repeated appeals to see the
American captives drew no reponse.
   A week before Khomeini's death, Beirut's Ash-Shiraa magazine
said the ``file of the hostages held in Lebanon is now in the hands
of Ahmad Khomeini,'' the ayatollah's son.
   Ash-Shiraa, which broke the story of the secret U.S.
arms-for-hostages deal that came to be known as the Iran-Contra
affair, also said Ahmad Khomeini recently summoned several
Hezbollah officials to discuss the hostages.
   The magazine said Khomeini's son is allied with Mohtashemi. It
suggested Iran's hardliners have taken charge of the hostage issue.
   Hezbollah publicly contends it has not been involved in the
waves of kidnapping that have swept Lebanon since Khomeini's brand
of fundamentalism swept Lebanon in 1983.
   But there is little doubt among Western and Lebanese
intelligence sources that all four factions holding most of the
American hostages operate under Hezbollah's wing and are controlled
by the party's militants.
   Among them is Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, which claimed
the abduction of American journalist Terry Anderson, the
longest-held hostage, and U.S. educator Thomas Sutherland.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Sutherland was grabbed June 9
of that year.
   Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite is also believed to be held by
Islamic Jihad, although no claim has been made. He disappeared
after leaving a west Beirut hotel Jan. 20, 1987 for a meeting to
try to win the Americans' release.

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Hear ARCO's Appeal in Antitrust Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set the stage for an
important antitrust ruling, agreeing to decide whether a major oil
company's price-cutting plan illegally harmed independent dealers.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that revived a
lawsuit for triple damages against Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO) by
independent gas stations in California and Washington state.
   The high court will hear arguments in the case in its next term
beginning in October, with a ruling likely in 1990.
   USA Petroleum Co., an independent oil dealer, accused ARCO of
conspiring with ARCO gas station dealers to fix prices illegally to
drive the smaller independents out of business.
   ARCO said its plan, lowering gasoline prices to attract more
customers and discontinuing credit cards to save money, is
legitimate.
   ARCO said its share of the retail gasoline market in California
and Washington was 10 percent to 12 percent in 1981 and increased
to 14 percent to 16 percent in 1983 as a result of the lower prices.
   A federal judge threw out the suit against ARCO. But the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling, reinstated it last
October.
   The appeals court said that even though there is no proof that
ARCO engaged in predatory pricing, it still may have injured USA in
violation of federal antitrust law.
   ``The objective and effect of ARCO's illegal pricing scheme has
been to reduce the number of independent gasoline retailers,'' the
appeals court said. ``This is the type of injury that the antitrust
rules were meant to prevent.''
   Predatory pricing is defined as setting prices below the level
necessary to sell a product or below an appropriate measure of the
cost of producing the product.
   In urging the Supreme Court to hear its appeal, ARCO said the
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Chicago has handed down
rulings in direct conflict with the 9th Circuit court decision.
   The case is Atlantic Richfield vs. USA Petroleum, 88-1668.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   JOB BIAS
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   The court dealt a blow to minorities who contend they are
victims of on-the-job discrimination, making it easier for
employers to refute claims of racial bias based on statistical
evidence.
   The 5-4 ruling said when minorities allege that statistics show
they are victims of bias, employers do not have to prove their
practice is non-discriminatory, only that there is a legitimate
reason for apparently neutral business practices.
   In a sharply worded dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
ruling ``retreats'' from 18 years of court decisions aimed at
helping minorities who are victimized by discrimination that may be
unintentional.
   The case is Wards Cove vs. Atonio, 87-1387.
   
   SCIENTOLOGISTS-TAXES
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   In a defeat for the Church of Scientology, the justices upheld
the Internal Revenue Service's contention that contributions called
``fixed donations'' made to the church by its members are not
charitable contributions that can be counted as federal income tax
deductions.
   The 5-2 vote rejected the Scientologists' argument that the IRS
had singled out their church for unfair treatment.
   The cases are Herandez vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
87-963, and Graham vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 87-1616.
   
   SCULPTURE-COPYRIGHT
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   The court ruled 9-0, in a victory for artists and authors, that
a homeless-rights group, the Community for Creative Non-Violence,
does not own exclusively the copyright to a sculpture it
commissioned an artist to create.
   The justices ordered further lower court hearings to determine
whether the CCNV and its founder, Mitch Snyder, may share in the
copyright of a work by James Earl Reid of Baltimore entitled
``Third World America'' that depicts the plight of the homeless.
   The case is Community for Creative Non-Violence vs. Reid, 88-293.
   
   MILKEN
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   The court, without comment, cleared the way for trial of a
government lawsuit against junk bond specialist Michael Milken and
removed a major obstacle to a $650 million payment by his former
employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., to investors and the federal
treasury.
   The justices rejected the appeal by Milken and two co-defendants
to disqualify U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack in New York City
from their case. The defendants had contended Pollack had an
apparent conflict of interest because his wife is receiving $30
million from the sale of a corporation in which Drexel Burnham
Lambert helped set up the financing.
   The case is Milken vs. SEC, 88-1628.
   
   CATARACTS-MEDICARE
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   The court left intact a federal law that generally prohibits
Medicare patients from using their own money to pay for assistant
surgeons in eye cataract operations.
   Without comment, the court upheld the 1986 law that prevented
such payments by Medicare patients unless the services were
approved by an insurance carrier or a state committee that reviews
such medical costs.
   The case is New York Opthalmological Society vs. Sullivan,
88-1146.
   
   TOMPKINS
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   By a 4-4 vote, the justices upheld the murder conviction and
death sentence of Philip Tompkins for a 1981 murder in Houston, but
left unresolved the question of how difficult it should be for
prosecutors to prove they did not exclude potential jurors because
of their race.
   The court in 1986 banned prosecutors from taking race into
account when picking jurors, and Tompkins had contended that the
prosecutor in his case had improperly rejected all 13 black
potential jurors, leaving Tompkins, a black, with an all-white jury.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate in the decision.
   The case is Tompkins vs. Texas, 87-6405.
   
   CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   The court agreed to hear the appeals of California death row
inmate Richard Boyde, who says the state's capital punishment law
does not give jurors enough discretion in sentencing.
   Boyce _ condemned for the Jan. 15, 1981, murder of Riverside
convenience store clerk Dick Gibson _ challeneged the portion of
the California death penalty law that requires sentencing juries to
impose death if they find that aggravating factors outweigh
mitigating ones.
   The case is Boyde vs. California, 88-6613.
   
   EXECUTION
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   By a 5-4 vote, the court refused to postpone the execution of
Roderick Frey in Pennsylvania, but Frey's scheduled June 13
execution had been delayed indefinitely by a lower court last week.
   The top court rejected Frey's bid for a delay even though it has
agreed to review the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's death
penalty law in an appeal that questions whether the law improperly
limits the discretion of juries in choosing life or death for
convicted killers.
   Frey, 52, confessed to hiring Charles Zehring to murder Frey's
wife, Barbara Jean, in 1979.
   The case is Frey vs. Pennsylvania, A-914.
   
   ANTITRUST
   
   The court set the stage for an important antitrust ruling,
agreeing to decide whether a major oil company's price-cutting plan
illegally harmed independent dealers.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that revived a

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 8 gras to UPDATE with meeting starting, Lukman speech;

   OPEC's president said today an
unexpectedly robust oil market could falter and send crude prices
tumbling, as the cartel formally met to set price and production
levels for the rest of 1989.
   ``There is still considerable inherent weakness in the market,''
said Rilwanu Lukman, president of the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Lukman said oil prices have surged higher than expected this
year, but he cautioned it was not clear the gains would be
permanent.
   ``We have yet to ascertain whether they form part of a long-term
upward trend in pricing levels or whether they merely constitute a
short- or medium-term cyclical peak,'' he said. ``We therefore urge
caution against complacency, at this stage, for these gains have
yet to be consolidated.''
   Lukman called on the producing nations to hold their output
levels to the quotas set by the cartel.
   Potential problems, he said, could come from increased
production in areas recently slowed by accidents, such as in the
North Sea. He also said a pickup in inflation could lead to a
contraction in industrialized economies.
   Earlier in the day, officials said ministers from Nigeria,
Venezuela, Indonesia and Algeria met to consider the options after
a compromise failed to win Kuwaiti backing.
   ``There's no deadlock,'' insisted Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul
Raheem al-Chalabi.
   The cartel is trying to reach a quick agreement on a new pricing
and production accord, in part to let Iran's oil minister,
Gholamreza Aqazadeh, return home for the funeral of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The ministers seem in general agreement on lifting their
July-December production ceiling to 20 million barrels a day, an
increase of 1.5 million barrels from the current accord.
   An increase along those lines, analysts say, would likely leave
oil prices _ and gasoline prices at the pump _ unchanged.
   An official of one delegation, who demanded anonymity, said the
elements of a compromise emerged over the weekend. Under this plan,
the output cap would be lifted to 20 million barrels a day.
   Of that sum, 500,000 would be divided up among five countries _
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Gabon, Ecuador and Qatar. Those
countries have been pressing for higher quotas, or shares of the
overall total.
   The additional one million barrels would be shared
proportionately among all 13.
   The official said, however, Kuwait has insisted on a still
higher chunk of the total.
   Kuwait's oil minister, Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, reportedly wants to
boost his current quota from 1.037 million barrels a day to as much
as 1.35 million barrels.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said he would like to
see higher crude prices, but he declined to say how much. ``The
market decides the price,'' he said.
   Nazer, the pivotal negotiator in the talks, said he expects
crude oil demand to increase ``a substantial amount'' in the
remainder of the year.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, pumps nearly a
quarter of all OPEC oil, giving it powerful leverage over the
negotiations.
   Some of the OPEC countries, seeking an advantage at the meeting,
have turned up production in recent weeks. Total OPEC output is
estimated at about 21 million barrels a day.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
has skyrocketed from $12.34 a barrel at the end of November to
nearly $17.70 a barrel last week. West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, was trading at just under $20 a barrel.
   Prices have been pushed up not only by OPEC's output cuts but
also by accidents in oil-producing areas that have reduced supply.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon notified Congress on Monday it
had approved sales of torpedoes and anti-aircraft missiles valued
at $68 million to Pakistan.
   The plans were announced the day Pakistan's Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto was scheduled to arrive in the capital for talks
with President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
congressional leaders.
   Pakistan has supported anti-Communist fighters battling the
Marxist government in neighboring Afghanistan, and has served as a
conduit for U.S. aid destined for the rebels.
   Assuming there are no objections on Capitol Hill, the Pentagon
said the Pakistani government would be allowed to purchase 64
Standard anti-aircraft missiles for deployment on some retired
frigates the United States has leased to Pakistan.
   That missile transaction is valued at $40 million, the Pentagon
said.
   Pakistan also will be allowed to purchase 64 Mk-46 torpedoes for
the same vessels in a deal valued at $28 million, the Pentagon
added.
   The U.S. Navy will oversee both transactions and will serve as
the prime contractor for the Standard missiles. The prime
contractor for the torpedoes will be Honeywell Inc. of Minneapolis,
Minn., the Pentagon said.

   A stowaway cat and her litter of kittens
born during a slow boat trip to Hawaii flew back home in style and
were met by a welcome home committee.
   When handlers opened a crate of cat chow in Hawaii, Sylvester
the cat and two surviving kittens emerged relatively unscathed,
although the new mommy was dehydrated, said Dick Rossow, customer
service manager at the Purina Mills plant in Turlock.
   During the sea voyage, Sylvester, who had been a mascot at the
Turlock plant 100 miles southeast of San Francisco, scratched open
a sack of food, Rossow said.
   The cat and kittens were flown back to the mainland courtesy of
Continental Airlines and were met at San Francisco International
Airport on Sunday by a limousine and a banner reading ``Welcome

   Rossow reported that company employees plan to adopt the kittens.
   ``The kittens are really cute, and they're all doing just
fine,'' he said. ``Sylvester's fine too but a little thin.''

   The Smoot as a unit of measure was
invented in 1958 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when
freshman fraternity pledges were ordered to measure the length of
Harvard Bridge using only chalk and the body of one Oliver Reed
Smoot Jr.
   The pranksters manhandled their fellow pledge end-to-end like a
ruler to measure the bridge. On the night of the fraternity prank,
the bridge was found to be 364.4 Smoots plus one ear.
   The bridge markings, maintained by Lambda Chi Alpha pledges for
30 years, threatened to become extinct when the 1891 bridge
recently was slated for a $16.5 million reconstruction.
   However, the Metropolitan District Commission and the Department
of Public Works decided the Smoot should stay when the sidewalk was
replaced.
   ``As a result of the Smoot withstanding the test of time, it has
become part of the folklore of the Harvard Bridge, and as such is
now under the protection of the MDC,'' declared the agency's chief
bridge engineer, David Lenhardt, at a re-Smooting ceremony Sunday.
   ``Out of the 14 pledges, I had the distinction of being the
shortest,'' explained Smoot, who is 5 feet 7 inches.
   ``And had the best name,'' said Peter S. Miller, who was in
charge of the chalk on that fateful night.
   Twice a year since, freshman pledges have faithfully
``re-Smooted'' the bridge that links MIT with Boston, marking each
10-Smoot length with a gash of paint on the sidewalk.
   The bridge's new sidewalk is scored at 5-foot 7-inch intervals
instead of the usual 6 feet, which will make it easier for future
pledges to repaint their Smoot marks, said Charles Madden, senior
vice president for Martin Continental Construction Co., the
contractor rebuilding the bridge.
   Smoot, now an executive with a trade group in Washington, D.C.,
lay down to have Miller chalk his measure on the new sidewalk.
Although the original deed was done in the dark of night,
interrupted once by a patrolling police car that sent the pledges
scurrying into the shrubs, the re-Smooting was punctuated with
flash bulbs and applause.
   Smoot and his son Stephen, MIT Class of '90, also posed in front
of a bronze commemorative plaque that was donated by Smoot's Class
of '62 at their 25th class reunion.

slippery mess when Mother Nature added water.
   Officials closed the ramp connecting northbound state Route 99
to westbound U.S. 50 for about six hours Sunday after rain made the
road too slick for safe driving.
   Workers had tried to clean up the glue after it leaked from a

   The thunderstorm Sunday dropped .22 inches of rain on
Sacramento, nearly twice the average rainfall for all of June.

<HEAD>Bush Announces Halt to Weapons Sales to China</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 7-9, The State Department, with American students
in Beijing advised to leave campuses.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he did not want ``to
see a total break'' with China in the wake of the government's
bloody repression of student demonstrations, but he announced a
series of sanctions in response to the crackdown.
   ``We cannot condone the violent attacks and cannot ignore the
consequences for our relationship with China,'' Bush said in a
statement in the White House briefing room.
   ``This is not the time for an emotional response,'' Bush said in
explaining to reporters why he had decided not to cut U.S.
diplomatic ties or to recall Ambassador James Lilley.
   ``I don't want to see a total break in this relationship and I
will not encourage a total break in this relationship,'' Bush told
reporters. ``When you see these kids struggling for democracy and
freedom this would be a bad time for the United States to
withdraw.''
   He renewed his call on the government in Beijing to avoid force
and to exercise retraint. To signal U.S. displeasure with the
crackdown, which left hundreds of students dead and hundreds of
others wounded, the president said he would suspend all military
sales and visits of Chinese military leaders.
   Also, Bush said, Chinese students wishing to extend their visits
here would get a sympathetic audience from U.S. officials. And, he
said, he was encouraging the Red Cross and other humanitarian
agencies to speed help to the injured.
   The State Department later announced all American students in
Beijing were being advised to leave the campuses and gather in
hotels because of the chaotic situation.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said there had been no threats
against the Americans.
   In other actions, the State Department issued a new travel
advisory, cautioning Americans not to visit the country, and
instituted a so-called ``warden system'' of asking those already in
China to make their presence known to U.S. diplomatic offices.
   Taking the long view, Bush said he was confident democracy will
triumph. ``The genie cannot be put back in the bottle again,'' he
said.
   Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing during the
opening days of modern U.S.-China ties, is slated to meet with
congressional leaders this afternoon.
   Although the topic is last week's NATO summit, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he expected the group also would
discuss the Chinese crisis.
   Bush released a statement Saturday after Chinese troops opened
fire on demonstrators in Beijing, saying the administration
deplored the violent turn of events and urged ``restraint,
non-violence and dialogue.''
   On Sunday, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep. Stephen Solarz,
D-N.Y., from the far points of the liberal and conservative
spectrum, joined forces on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' to demand
that Bush end military aid in retaliation for the bloody
suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Solarz said that unless Bush took a stronger stand on China,
``Congress will do it for him.''
   Solarz is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Asian
subcommittee, and Helms is the ranking GOP member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   Besides calling for the immediate return of Lilley, Solarz said
the United States should consider a suspension of trade in
high-technology items and a change in immigration regulations to
allow pro-democracy Chinese students to remain in America until it
is clear they won't be punished.
   ``I think it would be politically unacceptable and morally
unthinkable ... for us to continue to sell arms to a country that
is engaged in the wanton slaughter of its own people,'' Solarz said.
   Helms said he believed there was ``strong bipartisan support''
for the move.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of Foreign Relations
subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific affairs, also called for a
halt to all military assistance and cooperation with the People's
Republic of China, saying U.S.-Chinese relations had been dealt ``a
bloody blow.''
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., another member of the Senate
panel, advised a cautious approach.
   ``He ought to keep our ambassador there. ... We ought to
maintain our agreements (to supply aid),'' Lugar said on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press.'' The senator said the U.S. leverage in the
matter is ``always very limited. There are some situations we
really cannot control.''
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who helped forge the
first U.S. ties to China during President Nixon's term, also
advised that the president ``can't afford emotional outbursts'' in
the present situation.
   Appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
Kissinger said he was ``appalled'' by the events in Beijing but
cautioned that the United States must be ``very careful'' about
considering cutting ties with the Chinese in order not to give the
Soviet Union ``a free ride'' in influence in Asia.
   The U.S.-Chinese relationship has blossomed on economic,
military and political fronts since formal diplomatic relations
were established in 1979.
   Since that time, the United States has sold more than $748
million in arms to China, most recently a $100 million deal in
which Beijing purchased six Chinook CH-47D helicopters manufactured
by Boeing Co.
   China, with U.S. approval, also reached a $245 million agreement
with Grumman Corp. in 1987 under which the U.S. company improved
the avionics of China's F-8 fighter jet.

   The Communist Party today said Solidarity
candidates overwhelmingly won the country's first democratic
elections since World War II and that voters apparently removed
some party officials from parliament.
   The party acknowledged the Solidarity triumph in a statement at
the start of the evening newscast by its spokesman Jan Bisztyga,
who was shown sitting at the elbow of Solidarity national spokesman
Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
   ``The results are genuinely unfavorable for the (party-led)
coalition,'' he said. ``The elections had a plebiscite nature and
Solidarity got a decided majority.'' However, he did not give
specific results.
   Final official results from Sunday's election for a new Senate
and the existing Sejm, or lower house, were not expected until
Wednesday.
   Bisztyga pledged that the party would not quarrel with the
results. ``We will not back away from the road of democracy and
reforms.'' But he called on the opposition to also share
``responsibility for the country.''
   ``If feelings of triumph and adventurism cause anarchy in
Poland, democracy and social peace will be seriously threatened.
Authorities, the coalition and the opposition cannot allow such a
situation,'' he said.
   Onyszkiewicz spoke briefly after Bisztyga and cautioned that
some returns were still coming in. ``But despite that, it is a
victory,'' he declared.
   Earlier in the day, when partial returns indicated a Solidarity
landslide, Lech Walesa, the leader of the newly legalized union,
said: ``It's too early for congratulations and we don't have
complete information yet.''
   In its first dispatch on results, the official PAP news agency
tonight confirmed overwhelming Solidarity victories in at least 11
cities. It cautioned that the results were unofficial and might
vary in other places.
   Only a few Solidarity candidates in the race for the new
100-seat Senate appeared unsure of first-round victory, said
Onyszkiewicz, indicating firm opposition control of the East bloc's
first freely chosen legislative chamber.
   Under an agreement with Solidarity, the Communist Party was to
receive 65 percent of the Sejm. To achieve that some Communist
Party candidates ran unopposed, but the party's results indicated
that some of them did not get the 50 percent voter approval
required to be elected.
   It was not immediately clear what would happen to any Sejm seats
not filled in the election. Solidarity argued they should be left
vacant, but the government left open the possibility of another
election for just those seats.
   The economy is a shambles, and the communists badly needed the
opposition's cooperation if it is to be revived.
   Under the deal struck April 5 by communist authorities and
Solidarity, the opposition was given a chance to control the
Senate. The opposition gained the rights to field candidates for
all 100 Senate seats, and for 161, or 35 percent, of those in the
460-member Sejm.
   The communists were thereby theoretically guaranteed a majority
when the chambers jointly convene to elect the president, but the
Senate would have veto power over all legislation approved by the
Sejm.
   No results announced today, official or unofficial, indicated
that a Communist Party candidate won a seat on the 100-member
Senate.
   Unofficial returns issued earlier today showed that with 159 of
1,253 voting stations reporting in Warsaw, Solidarity candidates
for the three Senate seats from Warsaw were leading handily. The
Solidarity tallies indicated all had obtained more than 70 percent
of the vote.
   The numbers were similar in the races for the Sejm.
   In the southern city of Krakow, with about half the precincts
reporting, Solidarity's Senate candidates led all others for the
two seats, drawing in 83 percent and 74 percent of the vote, the
Solidarity campaign there said.
   In a district near Krakow with 62 percent of precincts
reporting, the Solidarity Senate hopefuls had 82 percent and 75
percent of the vote, the campaign said.
   Results from Gdansk showed Solidarity also well ahead in the
Sejm races and indicated that prominent party figures and their
allies running for the Sejm were failing to get the 50 percent
approval required.
   Partial results showed that the highest vote-getter on the party
list of candidates in Gdansk, Poltiburo member Wladyslaw Baka,
received 44 percent of the votes based on reports of 20 of the
Baltic port's 189 precincts.

<HEAD>Two Million Crowd Square to See Khomeini; 8 Crushed to Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two million mourners crowded into a Tehran
square Monday to glimpse the white-shrouded body of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, and at least eight were killed and hundreds hurt
during the huge show of mass grief.
   State television showed scores of people being carried from the
dusty Mousalam Square. The crowd swayed around the glass-covered
bier in which the revolutionary patriarch lay, his trademark black
turban on his chest.
   Iranians flowed into the north Tehran square under a blazing
sun, drawn by the tightly shrouded body in its air-conditioned
cubicle on a platform hastily assembled from shipping containers.
   Mourners beat their chests and heads with fists in a traditional
Shiite Moslem expression of grief, chanting, ``Oh Khomeini, why
have you left us?'' Some scratched their faces until the blood ran,
and threw ashes over their clothes.
   ``Imam Khomeini was our great leader. ... Nothing can ever
replace him,'' said Mohammad Mahdi, an aircraft technician.
   Iranians called Khomeini their imam, or spiritual leader.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the dead were
crushed in a stampede to the bier and many people collapsed in the
heat, which reached a temperature of 104.
   Khomeini died Saturday of a heart attack suffered 11 days after
surgery for internal bleeding. His death created Iran's most
serious political crisis since he was swept to power in the 1979
Islamic revolution.
   Ahmad, Khomeini's son, read a section of his father's political
testament over the radio. It called for national unity and warned
of ``enemy conspiracies and world-devouring America.''
   In Washington, President Bush said: ``There's a way for the
relationship with the United States to improve and that's for the
release of the American hostages'' held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian
kidnappers.
   Lord Glenarthur, a Foreign Office minister, said in London that
Britain is prepared to resume normal diplomatic relations if Iran
renounces terrorism and violence.
   Pope John Paul II, on a pilgrimage to Scandinavia, said of
Khomeini: ``It is necessary to state with great respect and with
deep reflection his impact on his country and a considerable part
of the world.''
   Israeli leaders expressed hope that former friendly relations
with Iran could be resumed. ``Israel can only hope that the future
leadership in Iran will have a more positive attitude toward human
rights, the West and Israel,'' said Allon Liel, Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
   In its first official reaction, Iraq called for a lasting peace
with Iran. The official newspaper Al-Thawra daily newspaper said in
an editorial that Iraq wants ``a comprehensive and just peace
beased on good-neighborly relations and non-interference in each
other's affairs.''
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire suspended the 8-year-old war Aug. 20,
but peace negotiations are deadlocked.
   The extract of Khomeini's poltiical testament read by his son
said nothing of who would succeed him as leader of the revolution.
   President Ali Khamenei, 49, was appointed caretaker leader
Sunday, winning 60 of the 74 votes cast the Assembly of Experts
chosen by Khomeini in 1979 to handle the succession.
   A presidential election and a referendum on constitutional
reforms, which are likely to increase the president's executive
power, are scheduled for Aug. 18.
   Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, wiping away tears with a
white handkerchief, tried to address the mourners from the Mossalla
mosque overlooking Mousalam Square, but broke down.
   ``Beloved imam, this nation has shown it will not forget you,
and we beg that you will not forget us either,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani said on television earlier: ``We are confident we are
able to follow in the Imam's path.'' He said the choice of Khamenei
as caretaker ``is the sign we are moving correctly. The people need
not worry at all.''
   In a gesture of respect, Rafsanjani referred to Khamenei as
``ayatollah,'' although the president is only a middle-ranking
cleric called hojatoleslam.
   In the absence of anyone with Khomeini's religious and political
authority, it seems likely Iran will be ruled by a collective
leadership.
   Khamenei, a moderate with close ties to the merchant class, has
been president since 1981 but is barred by the constitution from a
third four-year term.
   The constitutional reforms up for approval Aug. 18 are expected
to increase the president's executive power. Khamenei has endorsed
the candidacy of Rafsanjani, a political ally and the only declared
candidate so far.
   Former President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said from exile in France
that Khamenei would head a leadership group including Rafansajani
and Ahmad Khomeini.
   ``A week before Khomeini's death there was a compromise between
... Rafsanjani, Ali Khamenei and (Ahmad) Khomeini,'' Bani-Sadr said
in an American television interview.
   ``They chose Khamenei as guide because he is somehow a neutral
man,'' he said.

   Marine mammals, lighthouses and even beach
umbrellas will bring an oceanic theme to some of next year's
postage stamps, the U.S. Postal Service reports.
   While the full list of 1990 stamps and postal stationery has not
been completed, the agency has announced several of the issues
planned.
   The bicentennial of the U.S. Coast Guard will be marked by
issuance of a booklet of lighthouse stamps, the agency said.
   Featured will be the beacons at Admiralty Head, Wash.; Cape
Hatteras, N.C.; West Quoddy Head, Maine; American Shoals, Fla., and
Sandy Hook, N.J.
   A set of four stamps will feature marine mammals _ a walrus, sea
otter, bottlenose dolphin and killer whales.
   And turning to the shore, a colorful beach umbrella will appear
on a postcard-rate stamp intended for vacation use in writing home.
   Niagara Falls will make its appearance on a postal card in 1990,
while postal cards in the Historic Preservation series will feature
Constitution Hall of the Daughters of the American Revolution in
Washington and Stanford University.
   The national bicentennial stamps will continue in 1990 with a
stamp honoring the Supreme Court.
   And three statehood stamps will be issued, marking the
bicentennial of the last of the original colonies, Rhode Island,
and the centennials of Idaho and Wyoming.
   Two stamps will be issued offering views of America as it
appeared to early explorers.
   The Folk Art series will display five headdresses of Plains
Indians _ the Cheyenne, Comanche, Shoshone, Flathead and Assinboine.
   There will be a Love stamp, two Christmas stamps, and several
famous Americans will be honored with stamps in 1990. They include:
   _The late President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who will be honored on
the centennial of his birth.
   _George Caleb Bingham, a 19th century artist whose work featured
life along the Missouri River during the opening of the American
West.
   _Ida B. Wells, one of the founders of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
   _Luis Munoz Marin, first governor of Puerto Rico.
   _Claire Lee Chennault, founder of the Flying Tigers, a squadron
of American pilots who aided China in World War II.
   _Jesse Owens, a track and field legend.
   _Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Marianne Moore.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq on Monday called for a comprehensive
peace with Iran following the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   At the same time, Iranian rebels based in Iraq shut down their
propaganda machine in what diplomats suspect was an Iraqi move to
muzzle them in a goodwill gesture to Tehran.
   In Baghdad's first official reaction to Khomeini's death on
Saturday, the al-Thawra daily said: ``Iraq once again calls ... for
a comprehensive and just peace based on good neighborly relations
and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.''
   Iran and Iraq declared a cease-fire in their eight-year war in
August 1988, but have not concluded a peace treaty.
   The newspaper, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Socialist Party,
said in an editorial that the ``death of Khomeini means the passing
of a vicious despot who spared no effort to fulfill his dream of
building a Persian empire at the expense of Iraq and other Arab
nations.''
   It warned that Khomeini's death will trigger a ``chapter of
struggle among different factions'' in Tehran.
   But it stressed that Iraq ``is looking forward to the new rulers
working for a peace settlement to the gulf war and new relations
based on non-interference.''
   The army-run al-Jomhuriya daily noted that Khomeini's death has
``opened the gates'' for peace between the two Persian Gulf
neighbors.
   Iraq has repeatedly charged that peace talks to formally end the
Persian Gulf war have deadlocked because political feuding in
Tehran has paralyzed Iran's decision-making.
   The editorials clearly reflected Baghdad's hopes that a more
flexible leadership will emerge in Tehran following Khomeini's
death.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, announced in
Baghdad that in the wake of Khomeini's death, they have halted
publication of their magazines, shut down their television station
in Iraq that beams propaganda into western Iran and called off
anti-Khomeini demonstrations in world capitals planned for June 20.
   The Mujahedeen noted, however, that their radio station, the
Voice of Mujahed, will continue broadcasting 16 hours a day.
   The group, the main Iranian opposition movement, said in a
statement the actions were ``part of efforts to make ever-greater
preparations to overthrow the remnants of Khomeini's regime.''
   But diplomats in Baghdad said it appeared that the shutdown was
more likely ordered by the Iraqi government to minimize Mujahedeen
propaganda and encourage Iranian leaders to respond to Iraq's peace
call.
   The diplomats said that was the only explanation for the
Mujahedeen action at a time when they had been expected to
intensify their propaganda to exploit the political uncertainty in
Iran.
   Mujahedeen officials said Sunday that their military arm, the
National Liberation Army of Iran, was ready to return to Iran to
overthrow the Tehran government ``at the appropriate time.''
   There was no indication that the army, with a strength estimated
at more than 20,000 fighters, was preparing military action.

   Rep. Claude Pepper was remembered for
his ``boldness, vision and courage'' as mourners gathered today at
his funeral in this city where the 88-year-old congressman began
his political career 60 years ago.
   ``Claude Pepper never forgot his duty as an elected official to
fight for the common welfare,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine. ``His energy, and his vision will be sorely
missed as the Congress now moves to take up Claude Pepper's last
testament _ legislation to provide long-term care for America's
elderly.''
   Pepper, known nationally as a champion of the elderly and the
poor during his years in the Senate and the House of
Representatives, died last Tuesday in Washington of stomach cancer.
   His body was brought to the First Baptist Church for the funeral
after lying in state in Florida's historic Old Capitol, where he
had first served as a lawmaker beginning in 1929. The funeral was
attended by nearly 1,000 mourners, including members of Congress
and Florida political dignitaries.
   Pepper was also honored at a memorial service Sunday in Miami,
which he had represented in the House for 26 years.
   At the funeral today, former Gov. Reubin Askew recalled Pepper
as a man of ``great integrity, a keen intellect, boldness, vision
and courage.''
   ``He was willing to stand when there weren't a whole lot of
people willing to stand for people.''
   Mitchell said Pepper had a range of concerns that served his
nation in many different ways.
   ``Long before America entered the Second World War, Pepper
recognized the menace to freedom (that Adolf) Hitler represented,''
Mitchell said. ``His energy and vision will be sorely missed.''
   On Sunday evening, young and old filed past Pepper's open casket
in the rotunda of the Old Capitol.
   ``He's the last of the people we can depend on any more,'' said
Novelyn McCarty, 77. ``He's what I consider Mr. Social Security ...
Mr. Medicare.''
   Mrs. McCarty and her husband, Eulis, traveled to Tallahassee
from Fort Myers to view Pepper lying in state.
   ``I know I'll be a senior citizen one day, and that makes me
feel good, what he was trying to do,'' said Barbara Rhodes, 34, of
Tallahassee. ``I respect him.''
   Former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice B.K. Roberts, 82,
knew Pepper since 1929, when Pepper entered politics as a state
representative from Taylor County in North Florida. Pepper worked
as a freshman legislator in the Old Capitol, used as a museum since
1978.
   ``He was the most sincere, dedicated and committed public
official to the poor and needy and elderly that I have ever
known,'' Roberts said Sunday night. ``And I have known him well for
60 years. It was a religion with him.''
   Pepper, elected to the U.S. Senate in 1936, served there until
1951, when he lost a bitter primary race during which he was dubbed
``Red'' Pepper because of liberal views and ``softness'' on
Stalinist Russia.
   Roberts recalled a 1949 incident when friends had urged Pepper
to ``ease up'' on his liberal leanings because of his upcoming
re-election bid.
   ``Tears running down his cheeks, he said `I would rather be
defeated standing up for a just cause that will ultimately succeed
than to succeed with an unjust cause that will ultimately fail,' ''
Roberts said. ``I remember that time. I was very much impressed.''
   In 1962, Pepper was elected a U.S. representative to a South
Florida seat he never lost.
   ``Claude Pepper's constituency had no borders or boundaries,''
Gov. Bob Martinez told the crowd waiting to view Pepper's body
Sunday night. ``He was a leader like no other we will ever see in
our time.''
   Earlier in Miami, congressional leaders, the elderly and poor
praised Pepper during a service at Central Baptist Church as a
shining example of U.S. citizenship, filled with passion and
dedication to those who needed his help and influence the most.
   Friends and admirers of Pepper were joined by three busloads of
members of Congress and staff, including resigning U.S. House
Speaker Jim Wright, his presumed successor Tom Foley, Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and Tennessee Sen. Al Gore Jr.

   Three out of five newspaper people rate their
paper as ``adequate but not outstanding'' and even most of their
bosses feel that way, according to a survey released Monday by the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Four editors who presented the study at a news conference said
that given the self-critical nature of the business, they were not
surprised that only 34 percent of reporters, copy editors,
photographers and news executives rated their papers ``very high.''
Five percent put the paper down as ``poor'' while 61 percent chose
to describe them as ``adequate.''
   When only executives were counted, the ratings were somewhat
higher. Forty-six percent gave their papers a ``very high'' rating,
54 percent thought they were only adequate and 1 percent ranked
them as poor.
   Only on big papers, those with circulations over 250,000, did a
bare majority _ 52 percent _ rate their papers highly.
   ASNE president Loren Ghiglione, editor of the Southbridge,
Mass., News, and past president John Seigenthaler, editor and
publisher of the Nashville Tennessean, said so self-critical an
attitude was healthy and reflected the idealism of journalists.
   Seigenthaler recalled that in his career as a reporter he had a
low regard for his paper on days his stories were cut or not
prominently displayed.
   Linda Grist Cunningham, executive editor of the Parsippany,
N.J., Daily Record, said the ratings may demonstrate disagreement
between editors and reporters over a paper's mission. If the paper
sees its job as covering the city council thoroughly but the
reporter sees it as investigative journalism, those results would
be inevitable _ and would show the paper needs to communicate
better with staff and readers alike ``what we're supposed to be
doing,'' she said.
   And Barbara A. Henry, editor of the Rochester, N.Y. Times-Union
and Democrat and Chronicle, said the results reflect a tendency
among journalists to be more critical than other people of their
performance.
   ``When we get together we talk about what isn't good,'' she said.
   The findings were drawn from 1,200 valid responses, out of 1,345
sought, from 72 newspapers, chosen randomly in circulation groups
to represent a cross-section of the nation's nearly 55,000
professionals on nearly 1,600 daily papers.
   Fifty-four percent of participants said the paper was getting
better. That view was especially prevalent among people on big
papers and people who had been with their paper 25 years or more.
Thirteen percent said the paper was getting worse; 33 percent saw
it as marking time.
   A third of participants thought newspapers will be less
important in American life by the year 2000 than now. Twelve
percent said they will be more vital and 55 percent saw no change.
   Only 42 percent of participants gave their immediate superior a
high rating; 45 percent rated the boss as adequate and 13 percent
as poor.
   Other findings:
   _Copy editors, who edit reporters' stories before they are
published, give their jobs a lower rating than other people in the
newsroom when asked to compare it to previous work. Forty-three
percent thought newspapers will be less important than now in the
year 2000 and 43 percent said they would be unhappy if still doing
the same job in five years. The study called the copy desk ``the
Mount Everest of newsroom discontent.''
   _Members of racial minorities are more pleased with their
careers than white _ 85 percent of the minorities would choose
newspapering again _ but 49 percent of the blacks aged 26 to 35
think race is the biggest obstacle to their advancement.
   _Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed describe themselves as
Democrats or liberal or leaning that way. Twenty-two percent call
themselves Republicans or conservative and 17 percent define
themselves as independent.
   _A lack of feedback is more important to most participants than
pay. Thirty-six percent said they would improve communication if
they were put in charge while only 25 percent would improve pay and
benefits. Three quarters said they got little or only occasional
feedback. On small papers, pay was more important, however, than
staff communication.

   The government has sent thousands of troops into
the southern republic of Uzbekistan to quell ethnic rioting that
has killed two people, injured at least 72 and burned thousands of
homes, official media said Monday.
   Eight policemen were reported wounded and 48 people detained in
the Fergana Valley region in a rampage sparked by clashes between
members of the Uzbek majority and an ethnic Turk minority.
   The rioting in the Central Asian republic, about 1,500 miles
southeast of Moscow began as the Soviet Union's latest ethnic
violence, but it was fueled by chronic unemployment in the region
and soon turned into ``vicious clashes between thousands of furious
people,'' Soviet television reported.
   Soviet Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told the nightly
television news program Vremya: ``This outburst has been provoked
by somebody. So far I can't say by whom. But it's clear that some
evil forces are involved who think that the worse things are, the
better.''
   Bakatin, interviewed in Uzbekistan, warned that 6,000 Interior
Ministry troops were brought in Sunday night after a curfew was
imposed on the troubled areas and more were on the way, so ``we
have enough force to resist hooligans and extremists.
   ``Let no one think they can give us ultimatums,'' he said.
``Ultimatums will not succeed here.''
   Vremya showed smoking hulks of houses and cars, the remains of
Sunday night's violence. It said ``armed extremists in cars and on
motorcycles'' would ``appear and disappear unexpectedly,'' injuring
people and torching buildings.
   The Soviet Congress on Monday issued an appeal calling upon
``those involved in ethnic clashes to turn to the voice of reason
and stop the bloodshed.'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev read it
aloud and it was broadcast live to the nation as part of the
Congress' proceedings.
   ``Think about all the innocents who are threatened _ women,
children and old people. And stop, prevent injustice from being
committed,'' it said.
   The spiritual leader of Central Asia's millions of Moslems,
Mufti Mahammadsadyk Mamayusupov, also appealed for calm.
   In Margelan, one of the towns in the region, party leaders
retreated into their headquarters behind the protection of a ring
of soldiers instead of trying to hold a dialogue with protesters,
Vremya said.
   It complimented the Interior Ministry troops for ``behaving very
delicately'' in a complex situation, apparently meaning they had
caused no injuries.
   No units of the Red Army have been brought in to bolster police
and internal forces, Tass said. Army troops were last used to
handle Soviet ethnic unrest in Georgia, where their April 9 clash
with protesters left at least 19 dead.
   The last report of fatalities in an ethnic disturbance in
Central Asia occurred in December 1986, when the Kazakhstan capital
of Alma Ata was rocked by rioting touched off when the local
Communist Party leader, a Kazakh, was replaced by an ethnic
Russian. Two people were killed in the first major outbreak of
ethnic violence since Gorbachev's rise to power in March 1985.
   Gorbachev's policies of greater openness and more tolerance of
dissent have been followed by outbursts of ethnic and nationalist
unrest in several of the Soviet Union's 15 republics and among its
scores of ethnic groups.

<HEAD>Bush Calls for Release of Hostages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taking a tough line, President Bush on Monday
ruled out any U.S. overtures to the new regime in Iran and demanded
the release of the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
   Bush told a White House news conference Iran has been a
terrorist state. ``As soon as we see some move away from oppression
and extremism of that nature we will review our relationship,'' he
said.
   He described Ali Khamenei as the apparent successor to the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, indicating the U.S. government may
expect some jockeying for control. The Iranian president was chosen
Sunday night by 80 Islamic theologians to succeed Khomeini.
   But Bush, when asked who was in charge in Tehran after the death
of the 86-year-old fundamentalist cleric, said ``we're not sure
yet.''
   ``In a society of that nature, it's hard to predict,'' he said.
   Bush was positive, however, about not offering any U.S.
incentives to Iran in an attempt to repair the nine-year break in
U.S. relations with the Persian Gulf country.
   ``No, absolutely not,'' Bush said about any overtures. ``They
know what they need to do. They have been a terrorist state.''
   Referring to his inaugural speech, Bush said: ``I would simply
repeat what I said on January 20th, that there's a way for the
relationship with the United States to improve and that is for a
release of the American hostages.''
   U.S. relations with Iran were broken in April 1980, five months
after the U.S. Embassy was overrun and American diplomats, clerical
workers and Marine guards taken hostage.
   The action was taken by revolutionaries angered by the support
the United States had given the toppled Shah Reza Pahlavi. The last
52 hostages were released on President Reagan's inaugural day in
January 1981 after 444 days in captivity.
   In line with the diplomatic break, Americans were cautioned not
to travel to Iran and firms were directed not to deal with Iran.
Two years ago, after it was discovered that large quantities of
Iranian oil that had passed through third parties was reaching the
United States the ban was made virtually airtight.
   Only humanitarian assistance was permitted to go to Iran.
   Still, while urging other countries to join the boycott, Reagan
secretly approved U.S. weapons shipments to Iran in an effort to
gain the release of American hostages in Lebanon and to moderate
the Tehran regime.
   The State Department's Office for Counter-Terrorism lists nine
Americans as held by Iranian-inspired Shiite Lebanese. Also, Iran
is widely suspected of having played a role in the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, last year that killed 270
people.
   On Sunday, the White House expressed hope that after Khomeini's
death Iran would adopt ``a responsible role'' in the world
community.
   Former President Carter, who was in the White House when the
embassy was seized and then suffered politically by being unable to
free the hostages, offered some conciliatory remarks Sunday outside
his church in Plains, Ga.
   ``I know he was a great hero in his own nation,'' Carter said of
Khomeini, who may have cost the former president any chance of
re-election in 1980. ``My hope is that his successor will be more
inclined toward peace and reconciliation.''

   New York City has more reported AIDS cases than
the next four largest cities combined, and the epidemic is moving
swiftly through populations of drug abuses, minorities and the
poor, the city's top health official said Monday.
   ``The city's experience with the epidemic is in many ways a
foretelling of the future of AIDS for many other cities and
countries of the world,'' said New York's Commissioner of Health,
Dr. Stephen Joseph.
   ``An examination of this experience will yield, I suggest,
useful and important insights for application on the global
scale,'' he told the Fifth International Conference on AIDS.
   New York recently recorded its 20,000th case of the acquired
immune deficiency syndrome _ more than combined totals reported in
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston and Washington, D.C.
   More than 10,700 New Yorkers have died from the disease and
about 200,000 are infected, Joseph told the Montreal meeting.
   Sixty percent of New York's intravenous drug abusers already
have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that
causes AIDS. In 1988, for the first time, the number of new cases
in drug abusers equaled the number of new cases in homosexual men.
   ``The increasing role of the drug abuser makes AIDS more a
disease of poor families,'' he said.
   In 1988, blacks and Hispanics made up close to 70 percent of New
Yorkers with AIDS.
   ``More and more, cocaine and crack are the engines driving the
spread of HIV infection among drug users and their sex partners,''
Joseph said.
   He elicited shouting and boos from activists when he said the
epidemic is reaching the point where it would be useful to begin
confidential reporting of the names of people who test positive and
to begin tracking their sexual contacts more actively.
   ``I think we will see a relative shift from anonymous to
confidential testing,'' he said, citing the increasing possibility
of preventing or at least forestalling illness in people infected
with the virus but otherwise healthy.
   In other reports, the National Gay Rights Advocates, a public
interest law firm in San Francisco, reported that Medicaid coverage
for AIDS patients varies widely from state to state.
   ``The brutal fact is that under the present Medicaid system, a
recipient's ability to survive the AIDS crisis often hinges upon
his or her state of residence,'' the group's report said.
   Dr. John Phair of Northwestern University Medical School in
Chicago reported the homosexual men who develop AIDS soonest are
those with the most sexual partners during their lifetimes. His
study also showed that most newly infected homosexual men will not
develop AIDS for more than 3{ years.
   Researchers at the University of Miami reported that of 122
homeless men and four homeless women who volunteered for AIDS
tests, 14, or 11 percent, were infected. ``The rate of HIV
infection among homeless persons voluntarily seeking testing is
relatively high,'' the researchers said.
   Joseph's speech was constantly interrupted by shouts and
chanting from AIDS activists, many from New York. They were
especially critical of his call for confidential reporting of the
names of infected people, fearing such information could be used to
discriminate against victims.
   Joseph estimated the cost of treating AIDS patients and others
infected will exceed $7 billion during the next five years.
   By the end of 1993, the city will need 4,000 to 5,000 hospital
beds daily to care for infected patients, he said. They now occupy
1,600 beds in New York.

   With strong words and an even stronger
gesture, President Bush lent his moral support Monday to the
students struggling for democracy in China.
   The words came in a stern statement read at a hastily called
White House news conference.
   The gesture came a few hours later when four Chinese graduate
students were ushered into the Oval Office for a meeting with the
president of the United States.
   The White House had rounded up the guests by contacting local
universities and asking for names of Chinese students active in
support of the pro-democracy demonstrations in their homeland.
   Like state visitors, the four students had their pictures taken
and their words recorded by a horde of reporters on hand to
chronicle the opening of the meeting.
   When Jia Hao, 38, a doctoral student at George Washington
University, began speaking before all the cameras were ready, Bush
held up him a moment to make sure none of the media missed the
words.
   The political science student from Shanghai then spoke with the
aplomb of someone accustomed to tete-a-tetes with world leaders.
   Bush's actions, including a suspension on arms sales to China,
``will be a great support spiritually and physically to the people
who are fighting for the freedom and the democracy, and after all,
for China's future,'' he said. ``Also, it will be a big blow to
those who are responsible for the massacre, those butchers of
Beijing.''
   Bush later praised his eloquence, thanked the students for
coming and added, ``I apologize to you for the short notice.'' Then
he gave the other visitors a turn to speak.
   Shen Zhengfun, 34, who is pursuing two doctorates _ in sociology
at the University of Maryland and economics at American University
_ said, ``We are very glad to be here to have the chance to give
you our views.''
   ``Normally we don't do questions at these,'' Bush explained to
the visitors, ``but I might tell you what we want to do is to
continue to find ways to support democracy ....''
   ``We've got to speak out against the brutality _ and you just
did it very eloquently,'' he said to Jia Hao, ``but somehow make
clear that our argument, like yours, is just with those who resort
to force, certainly not to the Chinese people.''
   A White House press aide called out, ``Lights. Thank you.'' That
is the customary signal for the media to file out, leaving the
president and his guests to talk in privacy.
   Bush would have none of it. He motioned for the students to keep
talking.
   Zhao Shanyang, 31, studying for a Ph.D. in sociology at the
University of Maryland, said, ``I think all of us are patriotic and
we want to promote the movement in China. We think the popular
revolution is not something caused or promoted by any foreign
country.''
   Bush nodded in agreement.
   ``But we as students from China are very concerned and certainly
want to do anything in our very humble efforts to help,'' said Zhao
Shanyang.
   As aides again made a move to clear the room, Bush said, ``No,
no, let them make this point.''
   Shi Zhengfun, then spoke up again, praising Bush's ``measured
response'' to the crisis. The situation in China, he said, is
``very critical, very sensitive. We wish the United States could do
more, but we also understand that it's very complicated, and that
the response made by this country will certainly affect things that
are happening in China. A measured response, I think, may help the
things in China move toward a good direction.''
   Bush smiled, for he had made much the same point at his news
conference.
   The fourth student, Han Xiaoxing, 35, a Ph.D. candidate in
political science at Georgetown University, did not speak while
reporters were in the Oval Office.
   Bush met with the four students for 45 minutes, 15 minutes
longer than planned.

   Heavy rain Monday hampered workers
trying to rescue thousands of villagers stranded by weekend floods
and mudslides that killed at least 250 people, officials said.
   Air force helicopters dropped 70,000 parcels of food to people
cut off from the rest of this island off India, officials said.
Other pilots were directing navy and fishing boats to marooned
people, they said.
   Peasants in search of belongings scoured through the rubble of
mud and brick homes and ruined furniture piled on streets.
   State radio said the devastation triggered by a monsoon left at
least 250 people dead and 1,000 injured.
   At least 100,000 people made homeless sought refuge in schools,
churches and Buddhist temples, police and relief workers reported.
   On Saturday, eight inches of rain fell, causing deluges of earth
and water in valleys that wind through the southwest corner of Sri
Lanka.
   Kegalle town, 45 miles northeast of Colombo, and the surrounding
district of coconut and rubber plantations were worst hit.
   ``We know there is a family of four buried under that rubble,''
said Mahinda Vipula Jayaratna, pointing to a mound of earth. ``We
cannot dig because of the rains and the mud that keeps piling up.''
   Jayaratna's wife and two children died when his house collapsed
under a mudslide Saturday. He said their bodies and those of 18
other villagers lay in a local school building because the rain
prevented villagers from digging a mass grave.
   Upul Dissanayake, another villager, said the mudslide was
heralded by an explosion.
   ``I heard a loud sound like thunder and rushed outside my
home,'' the 27-year-old farmer said. ``The next moment the earth
moved under my feet tossing me aside and my home disappeared under
mud and rock.''
   Dissanayake's mother and father were trapped in the house and
killed.
   Searchers have recovered 165 bodies from the mud, according to
Ratna Jayasinghe, assistant director of social services.
   The Sri Lankan Red Cross appealed for food, clothing, tents and
medication.

<TEXT>
   The Polish election allowing the
opposition to share power with the Communist Party is a major part
of the historic movement for political reform in the East bloc and
the Soviet Union.
   Poland's first competitive election in four decades could end
the Communist Party's political monopoly at a time when other
Soviet bloc leaders are considering democratic change without
losing power.
   The emergence of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1985 and
his call for openness and economic restructuring gave Kremlin
approval to reforms that leaders in Poland and Hungary where quick
to embrace.
   Leaders of other East bloc countries such as Bulgaria, Romania,
East Germany and Czechoslovakia still cringe at a possible
challenge to their power.
   The stimulus for change in the Soviet Union and Hungary comes
from reform-minded communists. In Poland, an independent opposition
strongly influenced by the Solidarity independent union movement
has led the reform drive.
   Party and opposition reformers in Eastern Europe hope change can
be achieved gradually rather than by a revolution that might
disrupt Europe's postwar alliances.
   A Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslavakia in 1968
ended a Communist Party effort to reform socialism.
   Poland's fledgling opposition took a different path. In the
1970s a unique alliance between workers and opposition
intellectuals was forged that paved the way for Solidarity, which
was born in August 1981 and led the fight for political reform.
   Solidarity directly challenged the Communist Party's claim to
rule in the name of the working class, and the party tried to crush
the union in the Dec. 13, 1981, martial-law crackdown that
demoralized much of the nation.
   But Gorbachev revived hope that change was possible.
   After a Polish political amnesty in 1986, two waves of strikes
last year and continuing economic crisis, the opposition was strong
enough again in 1988 to press its demands for legalization of
Solidarity.
   After two months of talks, the two sides reached a historic
accord April 5 that legalized the union again after a seven-year
ban in exchange for opposition support of partially democratic
elections to parliament.
   ``There is no doubt without Gorbachev the situation in Poland
could not have happened,'' said historian Bronislaw Geremek, a
close adviser to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   The March elections in the Soviet Union to the Congress of
People's Deputies do not go as far as Poland in allowing voters to
freely choose their representatives.
   The Communist Party of the Soviet Union retained control of
access to the ballot, limiting the number of independent candidates
and cutting off anyone who challenged its ultimate authority.
   But for the first time in 71 years, Soviet voters were able to
choose between rival candidates, and in rare cases radical
reformers like Boris Yeltsin were able to muster enough popular
support to be seated in the congress.
   As a result, a Soviet parliamentary session going on now has
been marked by heated debates on such subjects such as the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan, the KGB, the performance of top officials
and the sovereignty of individiual republics.
   By contrast, in Poland candidates totally independent of the
party were allowed to stand for 161 seats of the Sejm, as the
existing parliament is called, and for all 100 seats of the newly
created Senate, the East bloc's first democratically elected
legislative chamber.
   Some Poles criticized Solidarity for accepting partially free
elections with no guarantee that authorities will keep a pledge to
hold completely democratic elections in four years.
   Historian Geremek said Solidarity had no choice.
   ``We decided to accept what was possible ... because there were
two dangers,'' he said. ``One was the risk of a social explosion
that later even political decisions could not solve and we thought
the international context might not last.''
   Opposition activists in Poland meanwhile express hope that the
Hungarian Communist Party's commitment to a multi-party system may
influence Polish leaders, who so far have rejected new political
parties as such.
   Parliamentary elections are due in Hungary next year and for the
first time since the communists consolidated power in 1948, other
parties will be able to take part.
   ``If Poland got a contract at too low a level, we think the
Hungarians will do better and that will influence our situation,''
Geremek said.

   The Federal Reserve announced new rules Monday
requiring financial institutions to disclose more information to
people applying for home equity loans.
   The Fed said the new rules are effective Wednesday, although
compliance is optional until Nov. 7. They are designed to carry out
provisions of the Home Equity Home Loan Consumer Protection Act, a
law enacted last November.
   The regulations require lenders to make the disclosures at the
same time an open-end home equity plan application is given to the
customer.
   The disclosures include payment terms, an example of the
payments, the fees the creditor imposes to open or use the plan, an
estimate of fees imposed by third parties, and any variable-rate
features, including the index used to determine the rate.
   The Fed said lenders also must give variable-rate applicants the
frequency of changes in the annual percentage rate and a 15-year
historical table showing how the rate and payments would have been
affected by changes in the value of the index.
   The Fed also is preparing a brochure outlining the general
features of home equity plans that lenders will be required to
distribute to prospects.
   Advertisements for home equity loans must include cost
information such as loan fees, the rate used to compute finance
charges, the maximum annual percentage rate for variable-rate loans
and tax implications, the Fed said.
   It said the variable rate must be based on an index outside of
the lender's control and that lenders may not terminate a plan and
accelerate any outstanding balance or change the terms of the plan
after it has been opened.
   The new rules also permit a consumer to terminate the plan
within three business days if the home used as collateral is the
principal dwelling.

   Candidates for governor made final pleas to
voters at train stations, senior citizen centers and shopping
centers Monday while mobilizing volunteers on the final day of
campaigning before Tuesday's primary elections.
   The four GOP front-runners were in a virtual dead heat in the
race to succeed Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
   ``... This race looks to be extraordinarily close,'' said Cliff
Pintak, campaign manager for Assembly Speaker and Republican
hopeful Chuck Hardwick.
   Analysts predict the Republican contest could be won with as few
as 100,000 votes out of the roughly 400,000 expected to cast
ballots in the GOP primary.
   In Jackson, Miss., voters go to the polls to elect a new mayor
for the first time in 12 years. State Rep. Cane Ditto, an attorney
and a Democrat, faces only token opposition from three challengers
in Tuesday's general election. Ditto upset incumbent Dale Danks Jr.
in the May 16th primary runoff and is opposed by Republican John
Bonelli and independents Liz Gilchrist and Ricky Godbolt. Danks was
mayor for 12 years.
   In Sacramento, Calif., voters who gave the troubled Rancho Seco
nuclear plant a reprieve last year will vote Tuesday on whether the
utility passed its probation or should be shut down.
   Critics fearful of nuclear accidents and angry at a $400 million
repair cost and rising utility bills, want to close the 15-year-old
plant permanently. But supporters say the plant's bad days are over
since it has gotten new management.
   Residents of Sacramento County and parts of neighboring Placer
County will vote on the propostion. It is not binding on the
municipal utility that owns Rancho Seco, but a majority of the
utility's elected board members have said they will abide by the
vote.
   In New Jersey, Republican volunteers for Hardwick, U.S. Rep.
James Courter, former Attorney General Cary Edwards and state Sen.
William Gormley operated telephone banks, put literature on car
windshields and knocked on doors to win support on the last day for
their candidates.
   A fifth major Republican candidate, state Sen. Gerald Cardinale,
has lately lagged in the polls and in the fund-raising necessary to
keep up with his opponents' brisk spending for television
commercials.
   There has been little suspense in the Democratic race, with U.S.
Rep. James Florio enjoying a nearly insurmountable lead in the
polls over Assemblyman Alan Karcher and Princeton Mayor Barbara
Sigmund.
   Kean, the popular two-term governor who is barred by the state
constitution from seeking a third straight term, could have made
the Republican primary less suspenseful. Analysts believed his
endorsement would have propelled the recipient well ahead of the
rest of the field, but Kean backed down from plans to endorse a
candidate.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has agreed
to abandon a site off the Texas Gulf Coast designated as the
country's only location for ocean incineration of hazardous wastes,
agency officials said Monday.
   Steps to revoke the designation of the site 220 miles east of
Brownsville hinge on resolution of a federal lawsuit in the
District of Columbia. The case challenges the EPA's decision not to
issue a permit to a Connecticut company, SeaBurn Inc., for
industrial waste incineration at sea.
   EPA argued in court it may not issue permits without
incineration regulations in place, and it has decided not to issue
those regulations. Also, the agency argued, congressional action
last year barring new ocean dumping of industrial waste also bars
incineration.
   Although the court in April sided with EPA's position, time has
not run out for SeaBurn Inc. to appeal the decision, said Tudor
Davies, director of EPA's office of Marine and Estuarine Protection.
   Once the court case is resolved, the EPA will officially propose
to revoke the site designation.
   ``EPA will begin proceedings to de-designate the site and the
conclusion of the judicial process in that case if the courts
ultimately uphold the agency's view of the law,'' said a May 24
letter to Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, signed by William A.
Whittington, acting deputy assistant administrator of the EPA water
office.
   EPA decided in 1977 to formally designate the Gulf of Mexico
site in the event it eventually formulated regulations to permit
the burning of toxic wastes at sea. Early last year, the agency
decided not to proceed because of widespread concerns about the
impact of incineration.

   Trade between China and the United States
jumped by more than a third last year to a record $13.4 billion,
the U.S. International Trade Commission reported Monday.
   The increase marked a rise from the 1987 total of $9.7 billion.
In 1978, the figure surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first
time.
   ``A high rate of industrial growth in China during 1988 was
accompanied by record high inflation,'' the report noted.
   Now, like many other big U.S. trading partners, China sells much
more than it buys in this country. The U.S. deficit with China rose
to $3.4 billion from $2.8 billion the year before.
   Chinese sales to the United States rose by $2.2 billion to a
total of more than $8 billion. The increased Chinese exports were
largely manufactured goods, such as toys and games, but also items
that take more technical skill to produce: electrical, sound
recording and telecommunications equipment.
   U.S. exports were largely raw materials. They also rose, by $1.5
billion to more than $5 billion, with the increase led by
chemicals, wheat and softwood logs.
   The report noted that a new agreement with China on limiting
U.S. imports of textiles went into effect last year. There were
also new accords on sea transport and on launching American-built
communications satellites from Chinese soil. An agreement on
favorable U.S. tariff rates was renewed.
   U.S. trade with the Soviet Union showed a surplus of $2.2
billion, twice the 1987 figure, thanks to increased sales of corn,
wheat, soybeans and fertilizers. The Soviets increased their
exports by $155 million, largely because of increased fuel oil
shipments. Trade with the Soviets was up, but at $3.3 billion it
was less than one-fourth the China trade.
   The report called attention to improvement in U.S. trade
relations with the Soviets, including lifting of the embargo on
Soviet furs, extension of the agreemment on U.S. grain sales,
increased interest among U.S. companies in doing business in the
Soviet Union.
   Overall, U.S. trade with Communist countries reached a record
$19.2 billion in 1988, up from $13.8 billion the year before.
Increases were registered with all Eastern European countries with
the exception of Hungary.

   The White House has decided to nominate
Commerce Department official Alfred C. Sikes as the new chairman of
the Federal Communications Commission to replace Dennis R. Patrick,
according to a published report.
   The nomination of Sikes, who heads the department's National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, will be sent to
the Senate this week along with two names to fill three vacancies
on the five-member commission, Broadcasting Magazine said in its
June 5 issue.
   The magazine, quoting a source it did not identify, said Sikes,
a longtime friend and associate of Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., won
out for the chairmanship over Sherrie Marshall, a Washington
attorney and former top aide to Patrick.
   Marshall will be nominated for one of the commissioner's seats,
along with Andrew C. Barrett, the magazine said. Barrett, a
Republican, is a member of the Illinois Commerce Commission.
   A call to Chase Untermeyer, director of the White House
personnel office, was not immediately returned Monday. Tom Cohen,
majority counsel to the Senate Commerce communications
subcommittee, said there had been no official word from the White
House as of Monday.
   A spokeswoman for Sikes, Nancy Mason, said rumors of his
nomination were still just that.
   Patrick, the deregulation advocate who battled continually with
Congress during his two years as FCC chairman, said in April he
would step down as soon as a successor was confirmed. He denied he
was being pushed out by the White House.
   The magazine said Sikes' nomination for the post had been
promoted by Danforth, the ranking Republican on the Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee, which oversees the FCC.
   Sikes served as an assistant Missouri attorney general in 1969.
He managed Danforth's unsuccessful Senate campaign in 1970 and
served as director of the Missouri Department of Consumer Affairs
from 1974 to 1977. He also owned several Missouri radio stations.
   During his tenure at Commerce, the department endorsed
deregulation of the seven regional Bell telephone companies to
allow them into the information services areas.

<TEXT>
   Mississippi teachers' salaries are off the
bottom thanks to four years of big raises, and educators in the
nation's poorest state are starting to see dividends: higher scores
on national achievement tests.
   But state education officials say the efforts that moved teacher
pay from 50th to 45th in the United States must continue.
   ``We have to make a bold commitment to our children that we
don't want them to be 50th,'' said Olon Ray, education assistant to
Gov. Ray Mabus. ``An important part of that is having a good
teacher in every classroom.''
   The 1988-89 national average teacher salary was $29,567. The
State Department of Education estimates the average in Mississippi
at $22,677. The 1988-89 average in the Southeastern states was
24,863.
   Education leaders hope the prospect of fatter pay checks will
attract better teachers and help enhance student performance.
   A U.S. Department of Education report released May 3 showed that
Mississippi students scored worst among those in 28 states where
the American College Testing Program, or ACT, is the predominant
college entrance examination.
   However, state officials noted that performance had improved
with the average Mississippi ACT score up 0.7 point to 16.2 in 1988
over 1987. Nationwide, the average score was up 0.1 point to 18.8,
and declines were shown in 11 states. The test is scored on a scale
of 1 to 36.
   Officials credit the 1982 Education Reform Act, which made
sweeping changes in Mississippi's education system, for the
improvements and Mabus has promised to propose an ``Education
Reform II'' package this year.
   Mabus made education improvements in general, and teacher
salaries specifically, a cornerstone of his successful 1987
campaign.
   He pushed through the Legislature's 1988 session a teacher pay
raise averaging $3,800 over two years. The second half takes effect
in July.
   That money, added to $3,000 in 1986 and $2,400 in 1987, helped
move Mississippi teacher salaries from next to last place to 45th
among the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of March 16,
state education officials said. They said Monday that, based on
National Education Association figures, Mississippi now is followed
by Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Arkansas and
South Dakota.
   ``Teacher pay is the key issue to being able to both recruit and
retain good people into the classroom,'' Ray said.
   Mabus wanted in 1988 to raise state teacher salaries to what was
then the Southeastern average. But the Mississippi Association of
Educators, the state's largest teacher organization, wants salaries
to reach the national average by 1995.
   Dr. Joe Ross of Vicksburg, chairman of the state Board of
Education, said Mississippi has made progress but he believes the
state should continue pressing toward the Southeastern average.
   ``There's no question but that we've made great strides in the
past couple of years, but everybody else keeps going up, too,''
Ross said.
   ``I think the fact is that nobody who went into education ever
went in with the idea that they could get rich,'' state Education
Superintendent Richard Boyd said. ``It was a field where people
thought they could do some good for humanity. But it makes it more
attractive if they know that they can made a decent living.''
   Ross said students entering college would look more favorably at
teaching if they knew they could make a reasonable living.
   ``A lot of people like to talk about education being a
calling,'' said Peggy Peterson, president of the 13,000-member MAE.
``Yes, you have to be dedicated, but you can't live on dedication
and you can't live on chalk dust.''

   An associate of Lyndon LaRouche Jr. was
sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison on securities violations
stemming from the political extremist's fund-raising activities.
   Rochelle Ascher, 38, of Towson, Md., had been convicted on
charges of selling an unregistered security with intent to defraud,
sale of a security by an unregistered agent with intent to defraud
and conspiracy, and six counts of securities fraud involving six
sales to four individuals.
   In a statement to Loudoun County Circuit Judge Carlton Penn, Ms.
Ascher maintained her innocence, and said the LaRouche
organization's ``entire purpose for existing is to combat
injustice, evil and poverty.''
   The judge declared: ``Not everything you have done is to the
benefit of the hungry and poor.''
   A jury on April 5 had called for her to be sentenced to 86 years
in prison, but Penn reduced it to 56 years and ordered that the
sentences be served in such a way that her term in prison would be
10 years.
   State officials had maintained that Ms. Ascher, 15 co-defendants
and five LaRouche organizations were part of a fund-raising
operation that allegedly bilked hundreds of people out of as much
as $30 million.
   The trial of other defendants has been moved to Roanoke.

<HEAD>Uno Pledges Reform; Party Leaders Prepare to Quit Factions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New prime minister Sousuke Uno told lawmakers
Monday that political reform is at the top of his agenda. Governing
party leaders were reported ready to show their support by quitting
party factions.
   In a major policy speech, his first address to Parliament since
becoming prime minister on Saturday, Uno said restoring the
nation's trust in politics is his administration's most pressing
task.
   ``Restoring the people's faith in politics will strengthen the
base of peace and prosperity of our country and is indispensible to
strengthening our world image,'' he said in separate speeches to
both houses of Parliament.
   Uno took office more than a month after former Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita announced he would resign to take responsibility
for the Recruit scandal, which has sent support for the governing
Liberal Democratic Party to all-time lows.
   ``Our cure must go to the very roots of this affliction so that
no similar disgrace will ever again occur,'' he said.
   Uno said his primary aims are to improve political ethics, draw
a clear line between the public and private use of political funds
and create an election system that does not require tremendous
funds.
   Fund-raising was a major factor in the scandal, named after the
Recruit Co., a publishing conglomerate that sold underpriced,
unlisted shares in its real estate subsidiary to more than 150
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen in 1986.
   More than a dozen people have been arrested on bribery and other
charges. Two politicians were charged with accepting bribes, and
three Takeshita-appointed Cabinet ministers were forced to step
down due to Recruit ties.
   The reform campaign appeared to make progress Monday when
Liberal Democratic leaders and all Cabinet ministers said they
would resign from factions within the party, according to the Kyodo
News Service.
   Party factions, which provide formidable voting blocs, increase
the party's appetite for funds because faction leaders need money
to support the political activities of their followers.
   Uno, who has resigned from the faction formerly headed by
ex-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, has vowed to abolish the
blocs, but he was careful to maintain a balance among factions when
naming his Cabinet.
   ``He may think he has demonstrated his will ... by placing
`political ideals and reform' at the top of his speech and with his
unprecedented wordiness on the subject,'' said an editorial in the
liberal Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second-largest newspaper. ``But the
speech sounded hollow.
   ``When you are caught in a whirlpool, it's difficult to see how
big it is,'' the editorial said, referring to the scandal.
   Analysts and opposition party members regard Uno, who served as
Takeshita's foreign minister from 1987, as a weak politician and
doubt he has the power to change Japan's money politics.
   ``He hasn't made amends for (the scandal) at all,'' said Iwao
Teramae, a Japan Communist Party legislator.
   On foreign policy, Uno said fulfilling Japan's international
responsibilities is ``indispensible.'' He indicated he will support
Takeshita's International Cooperation Initiative, which involves
peacemaking efforts, expanding overseas aid programs and
strengthening international exchange programs.
   Uno reaffirmed Japan's dual committment to the advanced
industrialized nations and to Asia, and he promised to support
continuing domestic demand-fueled growth as well as improve access
to Japan's markets.
   ``Now that Japan, which received the greatest benefit from the
postwar free trade system, has become strong economically, it is
not proper for her to express her own self-centered positions,'' he
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Schedules Another Talk Despite Infiltration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has scheduled another
meeting with the Palestine Liberation Organization despite reports
of an attempted infiltration of Israel by Palestinian militamen.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the
session would be on Thursday.
   In opening talks with the PLO last December the Reagan
administration gave public assurances to Israel that the dialogue
would be suspended if the PLO resorted to the terrorism that had
been renounced by Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   ``The series of infiltration attempts during the past week in
South Lebanon is very disturbing,'' Ms. Tutwiler said Monday. ``We
urge those responsible to refrain from incidents that can only
result in further violence and bloodshed.''
   The Israeli army said three infiltrators were intercepted within
the Israeli border early Sunday morning carrying Soviet-made
rockets and assault rifles and grenades. They were killed. An
Israeli Bedouin soldier also died in the clash.
   This was the third attempt by the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine to infiltrate Israel since Arafat's
statement cleared the way for talks with the United States, the
Israeli army said.
   The Palestinian group is part of the PLO and its deputy general
secretary is Abd al-Rabo, who heads the PLO delegation in the talks
with Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia.
   Nine Arab guerrillas and one Israeli soldier have died in four
clashes over the past nine days.

   The Pentagon notified Congress on Monday it

   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Pentagon
said it planned to sell South Korea 30 F-4E jet fighters along with
spare parts and support equipment in a deal valued at $246 million.
   The transaction with Egypt calls for helping that country modify
three of its Boeing 707 aircraft into KC-135 aerial refueling
tankers. The work is valued at $130 million.
   The deal with Singapore involves the sale of three
artillery-locating radar systems worth $31 million.
   The U.S. Air Force will oversee the first two transactions and
the U.S. Army will oversee the deal with Singapore, the Pentagon
added.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday he hopes a new
United Nations ``deconfrontation plan'' for Cyprus will be the
prelude to further progress in settling the dispute that has
divided the island for 15 years.
   Bush made the comment in a letter sent to leaders of Congress
advising them on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the
Cyprus question.
   Bush is required by law to submit a bimonthly report on Cyprus
to the speaker of the House and the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   Since the last report, Bush said, ``the U.N.'s deconfrontation
plan went into effect on May 17, greatly alleviating the
probability of incidents posed by the dangerously close proximity
of the two sides' military units in the Nicosia area.''
   He said the United States had worked hard for the U.N. effort
and added, ``we are hopeful that this achievement will prove the
prelude to further progress.''
   He said the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot sides have
continued efforts under the auspices of U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar ``to assemble the basic elements of a
settlement.''
   The subject has been discussed by top U.S., Greek and Turkish
officials in bilateral talks, he noted. Bush said he also discussed
it in a meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal in Tokyo in
February.
   Bush also commended the appointment of Maj. Gen. Clive Milner of
Canada as commander of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.
   Cyprus has been divided since Turkish troops invaded the
northern third of the island in 1974 in a move the Ankara
government said was to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority.

   The possibility of a conventional arms treaty
that would cut U.S. troops in Europe creates a greater need for
fast cargo ships to reinforce them in case of war, the chairman of
a Senate subcommittee said Monday.
   President Bush last week proposed ceilings on troops, tanks,
combat aircraft and attack helicopters, artillery and armored
personnel as part of a revised NATO response to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's planned cuts in Warsaw Pact forces.
   ``If mutual reductions take place in Europe, American forces
will be withdrawn across the Atlantic while Soviet forces will
remain at the other end of the European rail network,'' Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
subcommittee on projection forces and regional defense, said at a
hearing of the panel.
   ``In such an environment, a robust fast sealift program would be
a crucial element of continued conventional deterrence in Europe,''
Kennedy said.
   But the Massachusetts Democrat said the ``biggest gap to
reinforce NATO Europe is in fast sealift,'' a complaint that was
echoed by a series of former and present Pentagon officials.
   Witnesses told the Senate committee that U.S. sealift capability
has suffered as the nation's merchant marine has declined and
annual spending for research and development in shipbuilding has
decreased from $4.4 million to $500,000.
   ``Our long suit is people and technology and we're exploiting
neither in the world today,'' said Gen. Duane H. Cassidy,
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Transportation Command.
   Robert Costello, the Pentagon's former undersecretary for
acquisition, expressed dismay over Japan's 60-knot cargo ship, two
or three times as fast as conventional ships. ``We don't have
anything like that on the agenda,'' he said.
   Bush's proposal would reduce U.S. deployments in Europe from
about 330,000 troops to about 275,000. The president proposed the
same ceiling for Soviet deployments in eastern European countries
outside the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   A former CIA agent facing trial in the
Iran-Contra affair misled the Tower Commission and CIA
investigators in 19 instances, the government alleges in a newly
filed document.
   Joseph Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica,
withheld from investigators early in 1987 details of his
involvement with Oliver North's secret Contra resupply network,
according to prosecutors.
   The three-page bill of particulars filed by the office of
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh is the most detailed summary to
date of allegedly misleading statements made by Fernandez.
   He faces a trial July 24 on charges of obstructing inquiries
into the Iran-Contra affair and making false statements. The 19
instances of allegedly misleading statements form the basis of the
government's two obstruction charges.
   Fernandez told congressional investigators in 1987 under a grant
of immunity from prosecution that he had been involved from the
inception in the planning of a secret airstrip in Costa Rica. He
also detailed extensive dealings with the Contras and a number of
contacts with North.
   Several months earlier, Fernandez told the CIA's office of
inspector general that he merely monitored the development of the
airstrip, according to the bill of particulars.
   Fernandez told the Tower Commission in January 1987 he had only
occasional conversations with North before September 1986,
according to the document.
   It was filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va.,
and a copy was made available Monday by the independent counsel's
office in Washington.
   Fernandez also told the Tower Commission that he had never
communicated with Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted to run
arms to the Contras.
   In his subsequent testimony to Congress in a deposition,
Fernandez said he had met with Secord in Washington and discussed
the secret Costa Rican airstrip. The airstrip was to be used to
help resupply the Contras battling the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
   Fernandez also said in January 1987 that he hadn't had any
contact with Felix Rodriguez since 1971. He later told Congress
that he spoke with Rodriguez by phone during the period of the
secret Contra resupply operation.
   North brought Rodriguez into the resupply operation in September
1985.
   Rodriguez is a long-time acquaintance of Donald Gregg, who was
George Bush's national security adviser when he was vice president.
Bush has nominated Gregg to be U.S. ambassador to South Korea, but
the nomination is mired in the Senate over questions about Gregg's
role in the Iran-Contra affair.

   Hundreds of downtown office workers were sent
home Monday after an early morning fire shut down six electrical
feeder cables.
   An estimated 150 offices were closed, ranging from small
businesses with a few employees to entire buildings with thousands
of workers, according to Potomac Electric Power Co. spokesman
Eileen Griffin.
   Traffic police at intersections without stoplights could not
prevent rush-hour snarls in the afternoon.
   Dave Masters, Pepco's on-site supervisor, said up to 60 major
buildings were affected.
   ``Right now we expect to have power back sometime between
midnight and 4 a.m. (Tuesday),'' said Pepco spokesman Tom Welle.
``People can come back to work, but we're asking them to try to
conserve some power.''
   The cause of the fire was not determined, said Welle. He said
the blaze started in a secondary cable that carries 600 volts.
   The underground fire in the six, 13,200-volt lines and resulting
explosion blew manhole covers into the air, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported, but workers had to replace 1,000 feet
of cable, tedious job.
   Among those apparently affected by the outage were the CBS News
Washington bureau, MCI Communications corporate offices and the
Federal Communications Commission.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A fire engulfed one of the
capital's two public hospitals, destroying most of its facilities
and killing four people, including a baby in an incubator, a radio
station reported Monday.
   The independent radio station Haiti-Inter said the fire broke
out at 3 a.m. Sunday at Hospital de L'Asile in downtown
Port-au-Prince and destroyed two operating rooms, the maternity
ward, the pharmacy, laboratory and administrative offices.
   ``My wife was in labor. She had to jump out of a window of the
maternity ward to save herself and our unborn baby,'' one man said
on condition of anonymity.
   In addition to the baby, an adult patient and two visitors were
killed. Two others, including a nurse, were injured.
   The public hospital, one of two in the city of 1 million people,
was founded in 1878. It employs 180 people and has 59 beds,
compared with 1,000 beds in the State University Hospital.
   Haiti-Inter said that before the fire, two power failures
blacked out the area and shooting was reported in the neighborhood.
   Hospital administrators said they were awaiting results of a
police investigation before commenting.

<HEAD>Pol Pot Asks to Resign from Last Official Post</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pol Pot, whose Khmer Rouge regime was
blamed for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians, has asked
to resign from his last official post, a radio report said Monday.
   Some Western diplomats expressed doubt that the Cambodian
guerrilla leader was calling it quits.
   The Khmer Rouge's clandestine Voice of Democratic Kampuchea
radio station said Sunday that Pol Pot, in a letter dated March 4,
had asked to step down as head of the guerrilla group's High
Institute for National Defense.
   The Khmer Rouge defeated Cambodia's U.S.-backed government in
April 1975. His regime is blamed for the deaths of more than a
million Cambodians who were killed in purges or who perished during
a radical campaign to abandon the cities and establish a rural,
communist society.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ousted the Khmer Rouge
and established another communist government. The Khmer Rouge then
returned to guerrilla warfare.
   The broadcast said Pol Pot addressed the letter to Khieu
Samphan, who became the Khmer Rouge chairman in 1985 after Pol Pot
announced he had resigned from all major military and political
posts.
   It said Pol Pot asked for a decision on his request by the
beginning of June. No reason was given for the request, but the
broadcast said Pol Pot asked to remain with the research institute
``until all the Hanoi (Vietnamese) aggressors are driven out of
Cambodia. From then on I will cease all my activities in the organs
of the future state of Cambodia.''
   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said,
``I certainly wouldn't take it at face value that he is no longer
involved in the leadership of the Khmer Rouge.
   ``They are moving towards negotiations, and Pol Pot is the No. 1
unacceptable figure.''
   The Vietnamese-installed government and an opposition coalition
of the Khmer Rouge, supporters of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and
non-communist guerrillas have held negotiations on a peace
settlement and new government.
   All parties except the Khmer Rouge have insisted that Pol Pot
and other leaders of his regime be removed from any position of
power.

<HEAD>Canada Opens Door to American Oats _ No License Required</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American oats and oat products can be sold to
Canada without import licenses because the U.S. price support level
is below Canada's, the two countries announced Monday.
   The U.S. support level for oats is 8.74 percent, while in Canada
it is 11.09 percent, the Agriculture Department said.
   Under the free trade agreement signed between the two countries
last year, Canada agreed to remove import licensing requirements if
U.S. support levels were equal to or below those of Canada.
   Supports are government subsidies that put a floor under prices.
The U.S. mechanism for doing this is a price-support loan program
under which farmers use crops as collateral and are free to forfeit
and keep the money if that nets them a greater return than selling
on the market.
   Import licenses will be required for wheat and barley. The
support comparisons for those commodities are wheat, 61.62 percent
in the United States and 46.28 percent in Canada; barley, 72.49
percent in the United States and 50.23 in Canada.

<HEAD>HUD Secretary Announces Subsidies To Reward Urban Development Efforts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using Miami's bleak Overtown neighborhood as a
backdrop, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp announced a program Monday to
use federal housing subsidies to reward cities with promising
anti-poverty programs.
   Operation Bootstrap, dedicated to the late U.S. Rep. Claude
Pepper, will allocate about 3,000 Section 8 housing subsidy
certificates among areas with innovative projects such as job
training, inner-city business development and public-private
partnerships, said the secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
   Section 8 recipients receive federal subsidies for 70 percent of
their rent. There are presently 2.9 million people in the
15-year-old Section 8 program, said HUD spokesman Bill Galvin in
Washington.
   Under the new program, each of the 3,000 certificates would
supply funding for one person. Kemp did not say how much the
certificates were worth.
   Kemp, a former conservative Republican congressman from Buffalo,
N.Y., also told Dade County business leaders that he encourages tax
reforms to eliminate capital gains taxes for companies opening or
expanding in some of the nation's most impoverished areas.
   ``We have to bring the entrepreneurial spirit, the spirit of
risk-taking, into the inner-city, places like Overtown or the South
Bronx or East LA,'' said Kemp, referring to sections of New York
City and Los Angeles.
   Kemp said the idea for Operation Bootstrap was launched earlier
this year by Pepper, the Miami Democrat who died of cancer last
week at the age of 88. Pepper's funeral and burial were held Monday
in Tallahassee.
   The program is intended to help defray housing costs for
low-income people seeking jobs and, eventually, home ownership,
said Kemp.
   ``I don't think you can talk about jobs without housing, and I
don't think you can talk about housing without jobs,'' said Kemp.
   Kemp said HUD officials will review proposals submitted by
cities and distribution of the Section 8 certificates will begin in
September.
   Kemp said sections of the nation with high refugee and immigrant
populations, such as South Florida and Southern California, are a
priority for Bush Administration funds.
   ``How can we tell China or the Soviet Union or African or Latin
nations that democracy works if it's not working in Overtown and
Liberty City ... in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Watts,'' said Kemp, who
visited Overtown following three days of rioting last January.
   Earlier Monday, Kemp visited the 31-year-old Camillus House
homeless shelter in downtown Miami and pledged to seek federal
grants for the privately funded, 70-bed facility.
   Kemp visited the shelter at the invitation of Norman Braman, a
Miami businessman and owner of the Philadelphia Eagles NFL football
team.
   With reports circulating that outgoing NFL Commissioner Pete
Rozelle was considering Kemp as a possible successor, the former
quarterback said he is content with his HUD post, but would not
reject an NFL offer before it is made.

<HEAD>Woman Goes To U.S. Supreme Court To Have Boyfriend Spend The Night</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A divorcee who was told by the state
Supreme Court that she cannot let her boyfriend spend the night
while her three children are home has appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court, her lawyer said Monday.
   Carla J. Parrillo's appeal asserts that the state court deprived
her of a ``fundamental right to be free from government influence
within the confines of her own home,'' said Patrica A. Hurst, an
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer.
   Hurst said the state decision, in a case initiated by Ms.
Parrillo's ex-husband, has affected her client's rights as a parent
to ``organize the care and custody of her children'' and ``to
conduct her life as she deems fit.''
   ``The fact that the state of Rhode Island stepped into her home
to regulate her conduct is something that we all find very
offensive,'' Hurst said at a news conference.
   ``Until someone can prove that I'm harming my children, I will
continue to live my life as I see fit,'' Ms. Parrillo, 33, of
Johnston, said Monday.
   The state Supreme Court upheld a Family Court decision in March,
saying ``we see no great constitutional issue in this controversy.''
   Ms. Parrillo's boyfriend ``may still visit the marital domicile
overnight, with the exception of those times when the children are
with their mother,'' the court wrote.
   Hurst had argued that the 1986 decision by Family Court Judge
William Goldberg, now retired, was based on the judge's personal
opinions on family life.
   ``A transcript of the conversation between the trial justice and
the children is devoid of any facts which could support the judge's
inference'' of harm to the children, Hurst said. She added that
Goldberg rejected her request to have an independent psychologist
examine the children to determine if the overnight visits were
harming them.
   Ms. Parrillo and her husband, Justin Parrillo Jr., were divorced
in May 1986 after seven years of marriage and she was given custody
of her children, aged 9, 11 and 13 at the time. He was given
visitation rights.
   In June, the Parrillos returned to Family Court. Ms. Parrillo
wanted her ex-husband to see the children away from her home.
Parrillo wanted his ex-wife restrained from having any unrelated
males stay overnight at her house.
   Ms. Parrillo maintained that overnight visits by her boyfriend,
Joseph DiPippo, once or twice a week caused no harm to her
children. She testified that they liked DiPippo, but she did not
plan to marry him in the near future.
   Parrillo felt his children didn't like the situation, and
noticed a change in their behavior, according to his attorney,
Thomas DeSimone.
   The children told Goldberg in a private meeting that they all
got along well with DiPippo, although the eldest said there were
times he did not like the man.
   The judge ruled the overnight visits ``in the presence of the
children were not conducive to their general well-being, at least
in terms of their psychological welfare,'' the high court noted.
   Goldberg said if Ms. Parrillo married DiPippo, the issue would
become moot.
   ``No one gave Carla Parrillo credit for knowing what was right
for her kids as a mother,'' said Hurst, who maintained Ms.
Parrillo's decision to introduce a man to the family slowly was
easier on the children than an abrupt marriage.

<HEAD>Ethiopia Unveils New Eritrean Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament adopted a peace plan
Monday that includes public negotiations with Eritrean insurgents
in the presence of an international observer.
   The six-point proposal, approved in a one-day session called by
President Mengistu Haile Mariam, seeks to end a 28-year conflict in
Ethiopia's northernmost province that is the longest civil war on
the continent.
   Public talks with an observer agreed upon by both sides is a
departure from previous plans. The government and rebels have met
secretly in the past with no apparent progress.
   It appeared unlikely that latest proposal would find favor with
Eritrean rebels, who control about three-fourths of the province.
   Shewan-Dagne Belete, chairman of a legislative committee that
drafted the plan, said it was based on ``the unity and territorial
integrity of the country.''
   That was emphasized in the preamble, which described the
conflict as a ``challenge to the Ethiopian entity and the single
Ethiopian identity.''
   There was no immediate response from the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front, which is fighting for the independence of the Red
Sea province that provides Ethiopia's only sea outlet.
   The government has offered limited autonomy but demands that
Eritrea remain part of Ethiopia.
   Mengistu called the special session less than than three weeks
after his government crushed a coup attempt. Among the coup leaders
was the commander of the 2nd Revolutionary Army, which has borne
the brunt of fighting in Eritrea.
   He was was among about a dozen generals slain in the coup
attempt, which Mengistu followed with a thorough shake-up of the
high command.
   In 1988 and early this year, the army suffered humiliating
defeats in Eritrea and in neighboring Tigre province, which has its
own rebel movement.
   One Western diplomat said privately, ``The generals have lost
their stomach for the war.'' Mengistu is under both internal and
external pressure to end it.
   The Soviet Union has urged Mengistu to seek peace, threatening
to cut off military supplies when the current aid pact expires next
year. Moscow provided an estimated $5 billion in the past decade,
most of it in military assistance.
   Shewan-Dagne told the legislature the government had held nine
secret meetings with the rebels. He did not say when or where the
meetings took place or whether they were fruitful.
   He also confirmed a meeting was held recently in Khartoum,
Sudan, with the Eritrean Liberation Front, the first movement to
take up arms in 1962. It has been pushed out of most of the region
by the larger People's Liberation Front, which boycotted the
Khartoum talks.
   Neither Mengistu nor Shewan-Dagne mentioned the Tigre People's
Liberation Front. Rebels in Tigre say they want only greater
autonomy for the province, not independence.

<HEAD>Improper Prayer Scrolls Blamed for Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mayor who feared that divine retribution
killed three city managers in less than a month has ordered dozens
of improper prayer scrolls removed from doorjambs in the city hall,
a spokesman said Monday.
   Mayor Maxim Levy of Lod, near Tel Aviv, became suspicious of the
mezuzahs, or parchment scrolls traditionally attached to doorjambs,
after the third death May 18, spokesman Jack Sheetrit said.
   All three deaths were from natural causes, doctors said, and
none of the circumstances were unusual.
   According to Talmudic writings, affixing a mezuzah helps protect
believers from harm.
   Levy asked ultra-Orthodox rabbis to examine the building's 111
scrolls and they discovered faults in 87 that made them improper,
Sheetrit told The Associated Press.
   ``There were all kinds of problems. Some ... were only
photocopies, and in others the words of the prayer were wrong,'' he
said.
   ``The mayor is religious and he believes in the power of the
mezuzah. So he thought the first thing he had to do'' was change
them.
   According to Jewish law, a mezuzah must contain certain verses
from the book of Deuteronomy written in square Hebrew characters on
a piece of parchment made from the skin of a clean animal. The word
``Almighty'' must be written on the back of the parchment.
   The rolled parchment is inserted in a small case, which is
affixed to the right doorjamb.
   Sheetrit said Levy had changed the mezuzahs at the entrance to
the city hall and on the doorjamb of his office, and had ordered
new scrolls for the rest of the building.

<HEAD>Federal Study Says Nation Needs Additional Rocket Launch Pads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If American companies are to remain
competitive in the commercial rocket launch business, the nation
needs to build more launch pads, a Department of Transportation
study concludes.
   The study, released Monday by the Office of Commercial Space
Transportation, said that most commercial rocket launches to orbit
must use one of six launch pads at the Cape Canaveral in Florida
and that the same pads are also in demand by the Department of
Defense and by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``The single most significant potential constraint affecting the
commercial use of government launch ranges is the limited number of
launch pads available,'' the study said.
   Directors of the Eastern Space and Missile Command have made
``significant progress'' in adapting to a sharply increased demand
for commercial launch services that followed policy changes after
the Challenger accident, the report said. But potential commercial
launch customers, many of whom are foreign companies, are still
concerned about U.S. companies being able to launch satellites on
schedule.
   ``Many payload customers have stated that their misgivings about
`flying American' are a direct result of past and current U.S.
government policies,'' the study found.
   The study also noted: ``Payload owners have expressed skepticism
about the ability of U.S. launch firms to meet their needs because
U. S. launch firms rely on government facilities that are subject
to government policies.'' It said the customers worry that the
launch range must accommodate U.S. national security needs ``which
will affect the level of support that can be provided to commercial
launch operations.''
   The 1986 Challenger accident that destroyed a space shuttle and
killed seven astronauts delayed American space launches for more
than two years. President Reagan ordered that commercial payloads
would no longer be launched on the shuttle and laws were passed to
encourage establishment of commercial launch services.
   There now are at least seven U.S. commercial rocket launch
companies competing with French, Chinese and Soviet concerns for
the commercial launch business of the world. The French Arianespace
company now launches about half of all commercial satellites, the
study said.
   In addition to a shortage of launch pads, the Department of
Transportation study also found that policies by the Air Force,
which controls the Florida commercial launch pads, are not ``user
friendly,'' a factor that affects the ability of U.S. companies to
compete. The report also said that Air Force safety review
procedures are time consuming and could cause delays, and that
shared launch range facilities, such as propellant storage depots,
create delays in preparing for commercial launches.

   President Bush said Monday he will nominate
Edward C. Stringer, a Pillsbury Co. executive, to be general
counsel of the Department of Education.
   Stringer, a Minneapolis resident, has been general counsel of
Pillsbury since 1980. He is also the company's executive vice
president and chief administrative officer.
   The White House said Bush also plans to nominate Constance
Bastine Harriman as assistant secretary of the interior for fish
and wildlife.
   An attorney, she is a former associate solicitor for energy and
resources at the Interior Department. She has been in private
practice with the firm of Steptoe and Johnson in the capital since
1987. She lives in Bethesda, Md.
   Stringer is a 1957 graduate of Amherst College and a 1960
graduate of the University of Minnesota Law School.
   Harriman graduated from Stanford in 1970 and from the University
of California law school in 1980.
   Bush also named Everett Ellis Briggs, the U.S. ambassador to
Honduras since 1986, as a special assistant for national security
affairs. Briggs will be senior director of the National Security
Council for Latin America and the Caribbean.
   Briggs was ambassador to Panama from 1982 to 1986.
   Bush also named two other special assistants for national
security affairs:
   _Arnold Kanter, a RAND Corp. senior staff member and former
State Department official who will be senior director for defense
policy and arms control.
   _Deane E. Hoffman, a career intelligence officer who will be
senior director of international economic affairs.
   _Peter W. Rodman, a former Henry Kissinger assistant, as
counselor for the National Security Council.
   The White House said Bush also has accorded the personal rank of
ambassador to Peter Tomsen in his capacity as special envoy to the
Afghan resistance. Tomsen is a career foreign service officer.

   Iraq and Kuwait expressed hopes for peace
after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but the United
States and Britain said Monday that normalizing relations depends
on ending the extremism he espoused.
   Iraq, Iran's archenemy, had its first official reaction since
Iran's revolutionary patriarch died on Saturday.
   Referring to the cease-fire that began last Aug. 20 after eight
years of war, and to stalled peace talks since then, the
state-owned daily Al-Thawra said, ``Iraq is looking only for a
comprehensive peace with Iran based on strong relations.''
   Al-Thawra said Khomeini was a ``grudge-bearing tyrant'' and
commented that Iran now is ``disunited and confused.''
   Other nations that have clashed with Iran also made wary
soundings for better relations.
   In London, Foreign Office Minister Lord Glenarthur said Britain
is ready to resume normal relations with Iran if the Tehran
government renounces terrorism and violence.
   President Bush said the United States will review ruptured
relations with Iran ``as soon as we see some move away from
oppresssion and extremism.'' But he said he would not make
overtures to the new government in Iran as he was ``not sure yet''
about the meaning of changes there following Khomeini's death.
   Bush told a news conference Monday, ``There is a way for the
relationship to improve and that's the release of the American
hostages.''
   Nine Americans are among 18 foreign hostages held in Lebanon by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups.
   In Beirut, Lebanon an estimated 75,000 Shiite Moslem mourners
staged a farewell parade for Khomeini and chanted ``Death to
America, death to the great Satan.''
   The Kuwait Times echoed a hope expressed by many of Iran's Arab
neighbors, that Iran's new leadership ends the deadlock in
negotiations for a peace ``that will guarantee permanent stability
in the region.''
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi eulogized Khomeini as a great
prophet of Islam and revolution and a staunch foe of imperialism
and Israel.
   But Gadhafi, writing in a condolence book at the Iranian Embassy
in his capital of Tripoli, said the Iran-Iraq war ``made a black
record in the contemporary history of Islam,'' the Libyan news
agency reported.
   The government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India declared
three days of state mourning for Khomeini, canceling official
entertainment and ordering flags flown at half-staff.
   Gandhi messaged Iranian President Ali Khamenei, ``May the
Iranian people and the bereaved family have courage and fortitude
to bear this irreparable loss.''
   Pope John Paul II, on a visit to Helsinki, Finland, sent a
polite message of condolence and said: ``It is necessary to state
with great respect and with deep reflection his impact on his
country and a considerable part of the world.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Hundreds of citizens in predominantly Moslem Turkey phoned
newspapers to complain about their government's decision to fly
flags at half-staff Tuesday for Khomeini's funeral.
   They expressed rage that the flag would be lowered over the tomb
of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish republic, whose
westernizing reforms turned Turkey into a secular state and who was
frequently attacked by Khomeini.
   Governments of most conservative Persian Gulf Arab states sent
polite cables of condolences to Tehran, but refrained from public
comment on the demise of the man many held responsible for a decade
of instability in the region.
   Oman was the only country among the six-nation Gulf Cooperation
Council alliance to announce it was sending an official delegation
to attend the funeral on Tuesday and to convey the condolences of
Sultan Qaboos.
   The council groups Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain
and the United Arab Emirates, the six countries who were in the
direct firing line of Khomeini's pledge to export his brand of
fundamentalist Islam.
   The leadership in Saudi Arabia had yet to send even a cable of
condolences to Tehran. Saudi Arabia bore a particular grudge
against Khomeini for the repeated attempts to politicize the annual
Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca with Khomeini's teachings.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, in an announcement timed to
mark World Environment Day, said Monday the United States is
banning the import of elephant ivory from all countries.
   ``We do this out of mounting concern for the rapid decline of
the wild elephant, one of nature's most majestic creatures,'' he
said.
   ``If their populations continue to dimish at current rates, the
wild elephant will soon be lost from this earth. We urge the
nations of the world to join us in this ban.''
   Bush said people around the world have become more and more
concerned about such environmental problems as global warming,
depletion of the ozone layer, and mounting waste disposal problems.
   But, Bush said, ``I am optimistic about the future.''
   The United States has made ``remarkable progress in cleaning up
our air and water. We have shown what we can do when the will is
there and we work together,'' the president said.
   ``If we can probe the depths of space and engineer the genetic
building blocks of life, we can surely protect the quality of our
environment,'' he said.
   The United States already bans the import of ivory outside the
current system of international regulation. Last month the Bush
administration said it would press for a complete end to
international trade in ivory.
   The population of the African elephant today is estimated as low
as 400,000, compared with 1.5 million in 1978, because of the
inroads of poachers killing the animals for their ivory.

<HEAD>Judge Sentences 19 Foreigners to Death for Drug Smuggling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUEZ, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge in this port city sentenced an
American and 18 other foreigners to death after they were convicted
of attempting to smuggle more than six tons of illegal narcotics
into Egypt.
   Six of the accused, including the U.S. man, are still at large
and were sentenced in absentia at Sunday's court session.
   The 13 imprisoned defendants were arrested in July in Suez
aboard the freighter Reef Star, registered in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. They are from Sudan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and
Kenya.
   The six men sentenced in absentia were identified as Kayed
Mohammed Hussein Berro, a Lebanese-born naturalized U.S. citizen;
Berro's Lebanese father; three Palestinians and an Israeli. Berro's
hometown was not known.
   Prosecutors said that in the raid on the Reef Star police seized
4.1 tons of opium, 1.8 tons of hashish and more than 600 pounds of
heroin hidden in butane gas bottles. They said the narcotics were
being smuggled into Suez for sale in Egypt and transfer to other
countries.
   Judge Mohammed Hafez Tawfik convicted the 19 of drug smuggling
in a verdict announced May 18 and sent their records to Egypt's
highest Moslem cleric, the mufti. Egyptian law requires an opinion
from the mufti in cases where the death sentence is decreed but the
specific crime does not violate Islamic tenets.
   The mufti's decision is not binding, but the theologian approved
the sentences for the 19, and Tawfik issued them Sunday.
   The defendants have 40 days to appeal.

   President Jose Azcona Hoyo
announced Monday he and four other Central American chief
executives will meet in July to pursue a regional peace plan.
   In an interview on radio station HRN he said he and the
presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala will

   The five presidents have held several summit conferences under a
peace plan proposed in 1987 by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   Arias won the Nobel Peace Prize for the plan designed to
negotiate an end to the war in Nicaragua between the Sandinista
government and U.S.-backed rebels and the fighting between
left-wing insurgents and government forces in El Salvador and
Guatemala.
   The initiative has achieved a frail cease-fire in Nicaragua, but
the conflicts continue in El Salvador and Guatemala.

   A federal appeals court refused to close the
landmark 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education desegregation case,
saying the Topeka, Kan., school board has failed to carry out fully
the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate.
   In an opinion published Friday but not made available until
Monday, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed an October
1986 ruling that could have closed the case that paved the way for
nationwide school desegregation.
   ``We are convinced that Topeka has not sufficiently countered
the effects of both the momentum of its pre-Brown segregation and
its subsequent segregative acts in the 1960s,'' the appeals court
said. The panel also reversed a lower court ruling that the Topeka
school district had not violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964.
   In Topeka, Rich Jones, an attorney representing the parents of
17 schoolchildren who reopened the case in 1979, said the group was
vindicated in its contention that the district had not done enough
to eliminate segregation.
   ``We won. ... We feel that 10 years of work was not in vain,''
said Jones, Included in the group was Linda Brown Buckner, whose
maiden name provided the title for the 1954 ruling.
   The court noted that neither the Topeka school district nor the
Topeka community are actively resisting desegregation and cited the
national recognition of the district's innovative curriculum.
   ``This active engagement has largely been directed at concerns
other than desegregation, however,'' the appeals court said, adding
that ``for the most part, the Topeka school district has exercised
a form of benign neglect.''
   ``The duty imposed by the Constitution, and articulated in
numerous cases by the highest court in this land, requires more,''
the appeals court said.
   The court sent the case back to the Kansas U.S. District Court,
saying that Judge Richard Rogers of Topeka erred in requiring the
plaintiffs to prove intentional discriminatory conduct.
   ``We are convinced that defendants (the Topeka school board)
failed to meet their burden of proving that the effects of this
past intentional discrimination have been dissipated,'' the court
said.
   The 35-year-old case springs from the landmark U.S. Supreme
Court ruling on a class action lawsuit filed by black Topeka
residents against the school district. The lawsuit challenged the
constitutionality of a Kansas law authorizing school segregation.
   The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the lawsuit, finding that
separate but equal schools were unconstitutional.
   The Topeka school district later submitted an integration plan,
which was approved by the U.S. District Court in Kansas in 1955.
The court called it ``a good-faith effort to bring about full
desegregation in the Topeka schools.''
   But in 1979, the case was revived again by a group of black
parents who claimed they were members of the original class in the
1954 case. They claimed Topeka had failed to desegregate its
schools and that the Topeka school district operates a racially
segregated school system.
   Topeka School Board Chairman Curtis Hartenberger said the
board's attorneys were reviewing the decision.
   ``I have been told the findings relate primarily to student,
faculty and staff assignment, and that Judge Rogers' findings of
equality of education, curriculum, facilities, transporation and
extracurricular activities were not contested,'' he said at a news
conference.

   President Bush suspended U.S. arms sales to
China on Monday to protest the military's bloody weekend crackdown
and called on people around the world to stand symbolically with
the young Chinese demonstrator who braved a column of tanks.
   ``That image I think is going to be with us a long time,'' Bush
told an evening meeting of business executives in a departure from
a prepared text on education.
   Earlier, at a news conference, the president declared that
Chinese leaders must learn ``it's not going to be business as
usual'' and accused the Beijing government of ``brutally
suppressing popular and peaceful demonstrations.''
   But, while announcing sanctions on military sales, Bush also
said he would not withdraw the U.S. ambassador, take any other
steps toward severing diplomatic ties or take abrupt actions,
including economic sanctions, that could ``hurt the Chinese
people.''
   Later, Bush told an audience of the nation's top business
leaders he was haunted by the ``bravery of that individual that
stood alone in front of the tanks rolling down the main avenue.''
   ``What is it that gives him the courage to stand up in front of
a column of tanks right there in front of the world?'' Bush asked.
``All I can say to him, wherever he might be, and to the people
around the world is we are and we must stand with him.''
   Network television news broadcasts showed the remarkable
confrontation of the young man, who held up a column of 18 tanks
for three minutes, arguing with the crew of the lead tank. He was
pushed to safety by the crowd and the tanks moved on.
   Bush also told members of the Business Rountable that U.S.
companies should continue to trade with China, that he did not
support a suspension of trade despite the military brutality in
Beijing.
   Earlier, addressing two other international subjects at his news
conference, Bush spoke approvingly of a strong showing by
Solidarity-backed candidates in Polish elections and said that if
the Iranian government wants to improve relations after the weekend
death of the Ayatollah Khomeini it should use its influence to free
American hostages from Lebanon.
   He said the events in China the past few days, in which hundreds
of Chinese demonstrators were killed and many more wounded as the
army moved to clear Tiananmen Square, were being followed in horror
by people around the world.
   Bush, at a hastily called morning news conference, said the
United States would:
   _Immediately suspend military sales to China by the U.S.
government as well as commercial exports of weapons.
   _Halt visits between U.S. and Chinese military leaders.
   _Give ``sympathetic review'' to visa extensions for any of the
40,000 Chinese students studying in the United States who were
afraid of returning home.
   _Offer humanitarian and medical aid through the Red Cross to
those injured in the assault.
   Bush held out the possibility of further steps if the situation
worsens. However, he said, ``I don't want to see a total break in
this relationship and I will not encourage a total break in this
relationship.''
   He also said keeping an ambassador in Beijing provided a ``good
listening post.''
   Bush's steps won praise from Democratic and Republican leaders
on Capitol Hill. ``I think there was a general consensus for the
president's position,'' House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., said after a midafternoon meeting among Bush and
congressional leaders at the White House. ``I think he's done the
right thing.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said ``there was a well-done feeling from all
of us. We agreed right around the table that it would be incorrect
to take any precipitous actions, that the president was handling it
just right and accordingly.''
   Senate leaders said they would introduce a bipartisan
sense-of-the-Senate resolution on Tuesday backing the president's
moves and condemning the violence in China.
   Conservative Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said Bush's actions were
``fine so far.'' However, he said stiffer measures, including trade
sanctions and U.S. opposition to further international loans to
China, might be needed if the violence continues.
   ``Those students in Beijing have played the real China card.
They are demanding freedom and I think they are going to get it,''
Helms said.
   At the State Department, a spokeswoman said American students in
Beijing were being advised to leave the campuses and gather in
hotels because of the chaotic situation. However, the spokeswoman,
Margaret Tutwiler, said there had been no threats against the
Americans.
   The State Department also issued a new travel advisory,
cautioning Americans not to visit China, and it instituted a
``warden system'' of asking those already there to make their
presence known to U.S. diplomatic offices.
   Later Monday, at a meeting in the Oval Office, Bush told a group
of visiting Chinese students: ``We've got to speak out against the
brutality (but) somehow make clear that our argument, like yours,
is just with those who resort to force, not the Chinese people.''
   One of the students, Jia Hao, a doctoral candidate in political
science at George Washington University, said suspension of
military sales would encourage the student demonstrators and be `a
big blow for those who are responsible for the massacre, those
butchers of Beijing.''
   Some congressional critics have accused Bush of waiting too long
to act in response to the crackdown.
   But the president, who served as U.S. envoy to China in 1974-75
and said he decided his course of action based on his knowledge of
Chinese history, defended his pace. ``I don't feel that we've
waited long when you have a force of this nature and you have
events of this nature unfolding,'' he said.
   On another subject, Bush said it was still unclear what the
death over the weekend of Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini might mean for U.S. relations with that Islamic nation.
   ``There's a way for the relationship with the United States to
improve and that's for the release of the American hostages'' being
held in Lebanon, he said.
   On still a third international subject, Bush said the fact that
candidates backed by the labor union Solidarity appeared to be
winning in the Polish elections suggested this message: ``Communist
bureaucrats, beware in Poland. It looks to me like there's quite a
move moving towards freedom and democracy.''
   On developments in China, Bush said, ``I can't begin to fathom
exactly what led to the order to use force, because even as
recently as a couple of days ago, there was evidence that the
military were under orders not to use force.''
   Bush said halting arms sales ``is going to send a strong signal.
I'm not saying it's going to cure the short-range problem in China
... but I think it is very important the Chinese leaders know it's
not going to be business as usual.''
   White House officials said that over $600 million in continuing
military sales to China would be affected _ including a $502
million program to help the Chinese upgrade electronics on their
F-8 fighter jets.
   Also affected are the final two units in a $62.5 million sale of
four artillery-locating radars, a $28.5 million program for
upgrading large-calibre ammunition production, and an $8.5 million
sale of torpedoes.
   More than $700 million in commercial arms sales to China have
been made since relations were normalized in 1979, including $85
million last year.
   He said he had not talked to Chinese leaders directly since the
violence but had talked to U.S. Ambassador James Lilley, who had
been in constant touch with them.

   Solidarity won a landslide victory in
Poland's most democratic elections in more than 40 years, the
ruling Communist Party conceded Monday. Dozens of senior officials
apparently were turned out of Parliament.
   The astounding admission of defeat, two days before the official
results of Sunday's voting were to be released, came in a statement
at the start of the evening newscast by party spokesman Jan
Bisztyga, who was shown sitting at the elbow of Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
   A special slate of prominent government officials apparently was
overwhelmingly rejected by voters.
   ``The results are genuinely unfavorable for the (party-led)
coalition,'' Bisztyga said. ``The elections had a plebiscite nature
and Solidarity got a decided majority.''
   He reminded viewers that Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the country's
leader and head of the Communist Party, offered Friday to form a
``grand coalition'' after the election with the opposition.
   ``The first step of the opposition toward this is joint concern
about order in the country,'' said Bisztyga.
   It appeared possible that at least some government ministries
might be offered to Solidarity. The free trade union movement
shunned such offers in the past, saying it prefers to remain in
opposition.
   However, Solidarity was not emphatically ruling it out Monday.
   ``Solidarity's participation in a grand coalition would require
more talks,'' said senior union adviser Bronislaw Geremek.
   He said no proposal had been forwarded so far.
   Despite Solidarity's win, the Communists still are expected to
retain control of Parliament because election rules guarantee it a
majority of seats.
   But the union said Solidarity won almost all seats it was
allowed to compete for, indicating the opposition may have veto
power in the two-chamber legislature.
   The Communist Party's immediate concern seemed to be in
maintaining public calm.
   ``If feelings of triumph and adventurism cause anarchy in
Poland, democracy and social peace will be seriously threatened.
Authorities, the coalition and the opposition cannot allow such a
situation,'' Bisztyga said.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said earlier Monday in Gdansk,
``It's too early for congratulations and we don't have complete
information yet.''
   But the official PAP news agency on Monday night confirmed
overwhelming Solidarity victories in at least 11 cities.
   Only a few Solidarity candidates to the new 100-seat Senate
appeared unsure of first-round victory, Onyszkiewicz told an
afternoon news conference, indicating firm opposition control of
the East bloc's first freely chosen legislative chamber.
   Under the historic accords between the Solidarity-led opposition
and the communist government, all 100 seats in the Senate were up
for grabs in Sunday's balloting.
   The opposition also was allowed to run for 161 seats, or 35
percent, in the 460-seat Sejm, the lower chamber. The rest of the
seats were reserved for the ruling Communists and their allies.
   Thirty-five of those reserved seats are for prominent government
and party officials who face no challengers.
   But those uncontested party candidates must win 50 percent of
the vote to be seated, and there were widespread reports voters
were overwhelming rejecting those candidates.
   If Solidarity wins all of its seats in both chambers, it would
have 261 seats and the party would have 299. If all 35 unopposed
candidates are rejected, the party would still have a 264-261 edge
in the legislature.
   However, under the newly revamped constitution, the Senate has
veto power over all legislation passed by Parliament. The veto can
only be overridden by a two-thirds vote in the Sejm.
   If Solidarity's projections match the final official returns,
the Communist Party and its allies would be at least 10 votes short
of being able to override a veto by an opposition-dominated Senate.
   The 35-member ``national list'' of prominent candidates includes
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, Interior Minister Czeslaw
Kiszczak, No. 2 in the Politburo Jozef Czyrek and official unions
leader Alfred Miodowicz.
   All would retain their regular party posts if defeated in
Parliament.
   Solidarity leaders were hoping at least some on the list would
survive.
   If the 35 seats were vacant, the opposition would be in a
stronger position when the Sejm and Senate meet jointly next month
to elect a president.
   Solidarity has not determined who, if anyone, it will support
for the new office of president, which will have control of the
armed forces and be able to call parliamentary elections. The party
plans to nominate Jaruzelski.
   Walesa on Saturday went on national television to announce that
he was voting for 34 of the 35 people on the ``national list.''
   But many voters apparently saw it as a chance to express
displeasure at the poor economy and the past behavior of the party.
   About 16 million Poles cast ballots, a turnout of about 62
percent.
   A runoff election is to be held June 18 in those contested races
where no candidate obtained more than 50 percent of the votes, but
it appeared that the runoffs would be mainly for seats in the Sejm
reserved for the party and its allies.

   A river ferry crowded with people
returning from a gold-mining community's beauty queen contest
capsized Monday, drowning eight people and leaving 21 missing,
according to the National Radio Network.
   It said 25 survivors were injured in the early morning accident
on the Condoto River near the town of Andagoya, 230 miles west of
Bogota.
   The station said the wooden ferry was carrying about 200 people
but its legal capacity is 150.
   Most of the passengers were gold miners and peasants returning
to their homes from a beauty contest and festival in Andagoya, near
the Pacific coast, the broadcast reported.
   It quoted Red Cross officials as saying three adults and five
children drowned and many of the missing are children.

   China has purchased another 1.8 million metric
tons of U.S. wheat, the Agriculture Department announced Monday.
   The announcement came as President Bush was halting military
sales to China over that government's bloody crackdown against
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Bush said, however, he wants regular trade between the two
countries to continue without interruption. He said economic
sanctions to protest the use of force to dispel the demonstrators
could ``hurt the Chinese people.''
   The latest sale of soft red winter wheat brought to 2.65 million
metric tons of the commodity that the Chinese have purchased for
delivery in the marketing year that began June 1.
   Most of it has been purchased over the last two weeks.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pound and equals 36.7 bushels of
wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   In the marketing year that ended May 31, exporters sold 8.3
million metric tons of U.S. grain to China.

   Ronald Reagan said Monday he supports
President Bush's criticism of the Chinese government following the
killing of protesters in Beijing over the weekend.
   However, the former president had little else to say on the
recent struggle for democratic reforms in China as he cut short a

   When asked about the other major event of the weekend, the death
of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Reagan said only that he hoped the
situation would improve in Iran under new leaders.
   Bush suspended U.S. arms sales to China on Monday, and accused
the Beijing government of ``brutally suppressing popular and

   Reagan was in Portland to speak at a private luncheon for the

<HEAD>Witness Says Former Congressman Knew Money Laundering Was Involved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who introduced Pat Swindall to an
undercover agent testified Monday that the former congressman knew
money laundering was involved in an $850,000 loan deal involving
the three men.
   ``Mr. Swindall told me he didn't give a damn where the money
came from,'' Charles LeChasney said during Swindall's federal
perjury trial.
   Swindall is accused of lying to a federal grand jury about his
1987 dealings with LeChasney, a political associate, and Internal
Revenue Service agent Mike Mullaney, who was posing as money broker
``Mike Martinez.''
   Swindall was seeking money to finish building his suburban
Atlanta home.
   In his second day on the stand, LeChasney said that on Sept. 14,
1987, when the deal was discussed in Swindall's presence, the
defendant indicated he understood money laundering was involved.
   The prosecution witness said Swindall told him the deal was a
good way for Mullaney and his clients, purportedly drug kingpins,
``to wash the money.''
   LeChasney said he discussed with Swindall how he would handle
the $850,000 ``in such a way that we would not be caught''
violating money-laundering laws.
   LeChasney, an admitted con man who has been convicted of money
laundering, testified that he became concerned after Mullaney
suggested Swindall meet with his boss, ``Raul,'' another undercover
agent.
   The witness said he urged Swindall to ``tell Mike he could not
launder his money.'' Swindall followed that advice on Sept. 26,
1987, when the deal fell through, LeChasney said.
   The day before, Swindall signed papers arranging for a $150,000
advance on the $850,000 loan from LeChasney's Gulf Coast Mortgage
Corp., according to documents entered as evidence Monday.
   Swindall's attorney has called the $150,000 a separate loan, but
LeChasney said Monday the terms were those outlined in his
discussions with Swindall and Mullaney.
   The $150,000 check Swindall received from LeChasney's attorney
was backed by a personal check from LeChasney to the lawyer, with
the understanding that Mullaney would make the check good, the
witness said.
   Swindall attorney Richard Hendrix began cross-examining
LeChasney late Monday afternoon, attacking the witness's history of
fraud and deceit.
   LeChasney said he has never lied under oath in court, but
conceded he was an accomplished liar in attempts to influence
others. He said he told Mullaney and a government informant that he
had extensive political and diplomatic connections and was
executive producer of the hit films ``Urban Cowboy'' and
``Romancing the Stone,'' among other falsehoods.
   Swindall's attorneys have indicated they will seek to prove
LeChasney is a ``sociopathic'' liar who deceived the government
into thinking Swindall was a crook and tricked the congressman into
thinking the money deal was OK.
   Swindall, a two-term Republican, lost his 4th Congressional
District seat to Democrat Ben Jones last November.
   If convicted of all 10 counts against him, Swindall faces a
maximum sentence of 50 years in prison.

army spokesmen reported Monday.
   Police said the five officers were killed Sunday by rebels of
the Maoist Shining Path movement in an ambush on a road near Tingo

<TEXT>
   An Ariane 4 rocket lifted off
flawlessly from the European Space Agency's launch center Monday
and placed Japanese and West German telecommunications satellites
into orbit.
   Agency officials called the launch from this French territory in
South America a complete success.
   They said the rocket, a 44L model that is the largest in the
Ariane series, left the launch pad at 7:36 p.m. (6:36 p.m. EDT)
with the West German post office's DFS Kopernikus 1 and the
Superbird A satellite owned by Space Communications Corporation, a
subsidiary of Japan's Mitsubishi.
   It was the 31st launch of the Ariane series and the fourth this
year.
   It had been scheduled for May 26 but was postponed during the
final countdown because of insufficient liquid hydrogen pressure in
the third stage.
   Officials reported no problems Monday, and the rocket went into
orbit 17 minutes and 53 seconds after liftoff. Seven minutes and 13
seconds later both satellites were released into geostationary
orbit, they said.
   It was the 13th consecutive successful launch for Ariane. There
have been four failures since the first launch on Dec. 24, 1979,
and three were blamed on problems with the third stage.

   An airline ticket agent pleaded to be
reinstated in his job just hours before he opened fire aboard an
airliner carrying the boss who fired him, killing all 43 aboard, an
FBI agent testified Monday.
   Special Agent Alan Hawkins told a Superior Court jury that
former USAir ticket agent David A. Burke confessed to his
supervisor that he had a drug and alcohol problem but wanted the
airline to rehire him.
   But supervisor Raymond Thomson refused to rehire Burke because
of theft allegations, Hawkins said. Shortly thereafter, the two
boarded Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 in Los Angeles on
Dec. 7, 1987, bound for San Francisco.
   Investigators believe that after the plane took off, Burke shot
Thomson with a handgun he had smuggled on board. Burke then stormed
the cockpit, shot the pilot and co-pilot, and their slumping bodies
sent the plane into a steep, fatal dive.
   The testimony came in the second week of a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit focusing on how Burke was able to pass through a security
checkpoint armed with a .44-caliber Magnum.
   The owner of the ranch where the plane went down and the
survivors of seven passengers and two crew members claim the
security measures were faulty. The defendants _ PSA, USAir, the
city's Department of Airports and Ogden Allied Security Co. _ hold
Burke alone responsible and have filed a countersuit.
   Ronald Wecht, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said Burke also
bought a $350,000 insurance policy from a vending machine before
boarding the flight.
   Burke, a 16-year employee, approached the PSA passenger
screening station at Los Angeles International Airport wearing an
invalid badge, said Gerald Sterns, a member of the legal team
representing plaintiffs in 35 cases consolidated for the trial.
   Sterns said security should have checked to see whether the
badge Burke was wearing was current. And since Burke was not in
uniform, he should have been searched.
   ``But none of this was done,'' Sterns said. ``She just says,
`Have a nice day.' And he replies, `I'll have a very nice day.'''
   ``The next thing we know, he turns up, back on the public side
of the checkpoint,'' Sterns said.
   That's when Burke talked to his former boss, Thomson, pleading
for his old job as a USAir ticket agent. Thomson, 48, a station
manager for USAir, the company that bought PSA, took six pages of
notes during the 30-minute meeting with Burke.
   After his unsuccessful attempt to regain his former post, the
35-year-old Burke stopped by a PSA passenger counter, where he
bought a ticket, according to court documents.
   Investigators believe that about 30 minutes after the plane took
off, Burke handed Thomson a note, scribbled on an airsickness bag.
The note said: ``Hi, Ray. I think it's sort of ironical that we
ended up like this. I asked for some leniency for my family.
Remember? Well, I got none and you'll get none.''
   All on board were killed as the four-engine plane slammed nose
first mph into the rugged coastal backcountry of San Luis Obispo
County.

   Political and religious leaders of the world Monday
condemned the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing,
and hundreds of thousands of protesters swarmed to rallies to
denounce the bloodshed.
   In Ottawa, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark told Parliament
during an emergency debate on China that Canadians are being
advised to leave Beijing at once and that Canada has arranged for
aircraft to be available if the Beijing airport closes. Clark was
given a standing ovation when he proposed an all-party resolution
condemning the ``excessive and indiscriminate'' violence used
against the demonstrators.
   Switzerland, which rarely criticizes foreign governments,
summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest the force used by troops
trying to quell the student-led popular uprising.
   President Bush said in Washington he will suspend all military
sales to China and visits of Chinese military leaders, but will not
cut diplomatic ties.
   Delegations and dignitaries from Australia, Denmark, Norway,
Sweden and the European Economic Community canceled planned trips
to China. Protest rallies included ones throughout West Germany, in
Oslo and across from U.N. headquarters in New York.
   Students from China and Portuguese-administered Macao protested
in Lisbon and Coimbra, Portugal, but Portugal said there were no
plans to suspend a 1986 accord to return Macao to China in 1999,
state RTP television reported.
   Sunday's killing of hundreds of unarmed students and residents
in Beijing sent strong shock waves through neighboring Hong Kong
and Taiwan, where sympathizers staged huge rallies.
   President Lee Teng-hui said the Chinese military's attacks will
bring down the Beijing government, Taiwan's rival since the 1949
communist revolution drove the Nationalist Chinese from the
mainland.
   A similar sentiment came from President Francois Mitterrand of
France, who said: ``A regime which is reduced to firing on its
youth to survive, when the youth it has educated rises up in the
name of freedom, has no future.''
   Hong Kong, a British colony and bustling center of capitalism,
is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997. The violence left its 5.7
million people fearing for their future.
   Many in Hong Kong wept as they watched televised reports of
Sunday's assaults. Up to 1 million residents on Sunday staged the
colony's largest march in solidarity with Beijing demonstrators.
   ``I do not think the British people would accept the idea that
Hong Kong should be handed over to a bunch of medieval murderers,''
said legislator Anthony Beaumont-Dark of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative Party.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe summoned a senior
Chinese diplomat to register Britain's concern about the bloody
repression. But he said Hong Kong's future remains ``inextricably
bound ... with mainland China.''
   Soviet television broadcast dramatic footage of clashes between
Chinese troops and protesters, but officials made no comment,
apparently silenced by the fledgling friendship growing from last
month's historic summit between Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Chinese leaders.
   ``We have been taught by our own history that truth does not
come from the barrel of a rifle, nor do solutions,'' the Hungarian
Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag said.
   A spokesman for Yugoslavia's Foreign Ministry said Yugoslavs
feel ``grief for the human casualties.''
   Tiny, orthodox-communist Albania's official news agency referred
to Chinese troops ``brutally oppressing'' students.
   Czechoslovak media quoted casualty figures reported in Western
media, while East Germany stressed Chinese press releases.
   The Foreign Ministry of conservative El Salvador said, ``It is
one more example that the Marxist-Leninist system is contrary to
basic rights of citizens.''
   Lonely voices of support for China came from Nicaragua and in an
official Vietnamese radio broadcast, which said troops in Beijing
were attacked by hooligans and ruffians and were justified in
fighting back.
   Nicaragua's official Barricada newspaper quoted Chinese leaders'
claims that the order to attack avoided chaos and greater bloodshed.
   In West Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl angrily denounced the
``barbaric use of force,'' and Labor Minister Norbert Bluem said a
special session of the United Nations should be convened on the
assault.
   But U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar cautioned
there is little the world body can do.
   ``The secretary-general is greatly saddened that it was felt
necessary to resort to force in Beijing,'' spokesman Francois
Giuliani said. ``The secretary-general is most mindful of the
(U.N.) charter's requirement that the United Nations abstain from
intervention in regard to matters that are essentially within the
domestic jurisdiction of states.''
   For the same reason, the United Nations has taken no action on
China's crackdown on Tibetan activists.
   The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, said he was
deeply saddened by the loss of lives.
   In London, Amnesty International called on all governments to
condemn the ``deliberate killing'' and to press China's government
to halt the violence.
   ``It is important for governments carrying out human rights
violations to be made aware of the revulsion such actions cause to
ordinary men and women in every part of the globe,'' the human
rights organization said.
   The World Council of Churches on Monday expressed ``shock and
profound consternation'' on behalf of its 300 churches representing
400 million non-Roman Catholic Christians.
   Pope John Paul II, on a tour of Scandinavia, said, ``As
Christians, we hope that these deaths may serve to bring about new
life in that great and beloved country.''
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, swept to power by a
popular uprising that ousted President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986,
said she was ``very sad about the violent turn of events.''
   Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, where troops killed
thousands last year to crush a peaceful democracy movement, said:
``It's terrible. We deplore it.''
   No official response to the events in China has come from the
ruling military government in Burma nor has the state press covered
the events.
   Japan's Prime Minister Sousuke Uno told reporters he was
``seriously concerned'' and ``praying for the return of calm.''
   Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore said he was ``shocked,
horrified and saddened.''
   A spokesman for the South Korean government said, ``The
stability of China is important for peace and stability on the
Korean peninsula.''
   British publisher Robert Maxwell announced in New York he
suspended publication in Europe of China's official
English-language newspaper, China Daily, saying he wouldn't honor
the joint venture because of revulsion over the Beijing massacre.
   About 250 university students threw tomatoes at the Chinese
Embassy in Mexico City and broke a security camera there in a
protest action.
   An editorial in the government newspaper El Nacional said of the
Beijing slaughter: ``It's clear that the bloodbath was deliberate.''

<TEXT>
   The trespass trial of 155 anti-abortion
activists opened under the glare of floodlights Monday, with
potential jurors and defendants sitting in a theater because no
courtroom could hold all of them.
   Hillsborough County Judge James D. Arnold consolidated the cases
and rented the 300-seat Jaeb Theater at the Tampa Performing Arts
Complex for what is expected to be a weeklong trial.
   Arnold sat center stage at a makeshift judge's bench, while the
95 prospective jurors occupied the first five rows. The defendants
took up the orchestra, mezzanine and balcony seats of the theater
designed as an intimate hall for nightclub acts and jazz ensembles.
   Prosecutors say the defendants broke the law April 15 when they
tried to disrupt operations at the Women's Health Center. About
1,200 people organized by Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group,
demonstrated at the clinic.
   More than 180 were arrested and charged with trespass after
warning, a misdemeanor that carries a possibile maximum sentence of
one year in prison and a $1,000 fine. Some pleaded no contest in a
deal with prosecutors and received six months' probation; the rest
opted for trial.
   Jury candidates were bused to the arts complex. Attorneys
expected to take all day to seat a six-member jury.
   Outside, four demonstrators representing both sides of the issue
picketed peacefully.
   The judge ruled earlier that the defendants wouldn't be allowed
to argue that any trespass was justified and excusable because they
were saving lives.
   Defense attorney Gregory Boyer had hoped to present what he said
was evidence that many women arriving at the center on April 15
were scheduled to have abortions, and that most women, deterred
once, are less likely to follow through with a second appointment.
He said the defense has been used in jury trials in similar cases
elsewhere.
   But Arnold agreed with prosecutors that because abortion is
legal in Florida and a first-trimester fetus is not considered a
viable baby, the defense is irrevelant and would become an
emotional plea to jurors.

<TEXT>
   Former Cleveland mayor Carl B.
Stokes, now a municipal judge, was charged Monday with petty theft
by a pet store owner who says he stole a $17.25 bag of dog food.
   It was the second shoplifting allegation in six months involving
Stokes, who has been mentioned as a possible Cleveland mayoral
candidate this year.
   In a statement he read Monday to The Associated Press, he said
he would plead innocent to the charge and request a jury trial.
   The judge also said he would continue his judicial duties
between now and his June 26 arraignment, and request an earlier
arraignment.
   ``However, to avoid any appearances of impropriety, I will refer
all cases alleging petty theft to presiding Judge Charles Flemming
for their disposition,'' he said.
   Stokes is accused by Kim Liedtke, owner of the Pad &amp; Fin pet
store, of stealing 20 pounds of dry dog food Friday.
   Petty theft is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by as much
as six months in jail and a maximum $1,000 fine.
   On Jan. 4, Stokes acknowledged that he took a $2.39 screwdriver
from a Handy Andy store in Bedford last Dec. 15 without paying for
it.
   Stokes was not charged in that incident. He said he had
absent-mindedly put the screwdriver in his pocket, then argued with
a cashier over the price of other merchandise and forgot he had the
screwdriver. He later paid the store $50 restitution.
   Stokes was mayor of Cleveland from 1967 to 1971, then worked as
a newsman in New York for eight years before returning to Cleveland
to practice law in 1980. He was elected a municipal judge in 1983.

<HEAD>Voyager 2 Begins Picture-Taking Encounter With Neptune</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voyager 2 began taking pictures Monday
of Neptune, the last planet the space probe will encounter since it
was launched nearly 12 years ago on a spectacular tour of the solar
system, NASA officials said.
   The spacecraft still is about 73 million miles from the planet,
about the distance from Earth to the planet Mercury, said Ellis
Miner, Voyager deputy project scientist at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   But even at such distances, Miner said the electronic
picture-taking equipment aboard Voyager 2 can provide more detail
and clarity than anything available on Earth.
   ``Each new picture gives us new information,'' Miner said. The
probe is taking about six images every three hours as it approaches
the planet at roughly 37,200 miles per hour.
   ``We're seeing a lot of detail on the atmosphere that we really
hadn't anticipated,'' Miner said.
   Enthusiastic members of Voyager's imaging team already are
speculating that the findings will be more exciting than the images
of Jupiter, where Voyager cameras discovered extraterrestrial
volcanoes on Io, a moon.
   On Aug. 6th, Voyager 2 begins its close-encounter phase and the
probe's closest approach is scheduled for Aug. 24, when it will
pass within 3,000 miles of the planet.
   The first images were being recorded by the spacecraft's tape
recorders, and will be played back Tuesday at the JPL laboratory,
operated under contract by the California Institute of Technology
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The probe now is so far away, more than 2.6 billion miles, that
data radioed at the speed of light take nearly four hours to reach
Earth, JPL officials said.
   Voyager 2 and its sister space probe, Voyager 1, were launched
within weeks of each other in the summer of 1977 in what has proved
to be one of the most successful data gathering efforts from deep
space.
   ``They are the two most complex spacecraft missions that we have
launched to date,'' Miner said. ``It's been a truly amazing journey
that the two have had.''
   Voyager 1 was directed to make an extraordinary fly-by of
Saturn, which threw the space probe above the plane of the planets
and made it impossible to visit any more of the solar system's
outer planets.
   Voyager 2, however, sailed on to Uranus in 1986, where it
observed 10 new moons, measured the planet's rotation and took
pictures of major portions of the planet and its moons.
   In addition to taking images of the planet, Voyager 2 also will
be measuring ultraviolet radiation and searching for escaping gases
and activity similar to Earth's aurora borealis and australis.

   Chinese students rallied at the Capitol and
across the street from the White House on Monday, chanting, singing
and listening to speeches appealing for international help to
``stop the killing'' in Beijing.
   Members of Congress applauded President Bush's decision to
suspend military sales to China and to cut off contacts with
Chinese military leaders.
   But a few said the United States should go further, ending all
U.S. trade with China and stopping U.S. investment in China's
economy.
   Rep. Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., the House majority leader
expected to be elected speaker on Tuesday, said after a meeting
with Bush that ``in the very uncertain circumstances at the present
time I think the president is correct in leaving our ambassador in
Beijing.''
   ``It's important both for the flow of information and ... for
strong action to ensure the protection of American citizens as well
as expressing at the highest level our deep concern, our anguish
over further loss of life,'' Foley said.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois called Bush's
decision to stop arms sales ``a measured and, in my view,
appropriate response.''
   In Portland, Ore., former President Reagan said he supported
Bush's criticism of the Chinese government.
   The demonstrating students, from universities and colleges along
the East Coast, held banners and placards aloft in the steamy heat
at the Capitol's West Front displaying slogans that have echoed in
American revolutionary and civil rights history: ``Don't Tread On
Me!'' _ ``Live Free Or Die!'' _ ``We Shall Overcome.''
   Elsewhere around the country, students and supporters also
demonstrated in Cincinnati, Austin, Texas; Flagstaff and Tucson,
Ariz.; Little Rock and Fayetteville, Ark.; Oxford, Miss.;
Morgantown, W.Va.; Lincoln, Neb.; Birmingham and Huntsville, Ala.;
Stillwater, Okla.; Hanover, N.H.; Worcester, Mass.; Helena, Mont.;
Grand Forks and Fargo, N.D.; and Madison, Wis. Many of the protests
took place at college campuses.
   After marching up Pennsylvania Avenue, the Washington group
gathered in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, to show
support for, as one banner read, ``those brothers killed by
troops.'' Some in the crowd, which was estimated at about 3,000 by
police, carried placards with messages such as ``Democracy for
China Now'' and ``Stop China Deaths.''
   Slogans written on headbands, on banners, on placards, on
T-shirts and on flags reflected fury at the crushing of the
pro-democracy demonstration in Beijing's Tiananmen Square by the
Chinese Army.
   A sampling at the Capitol: ``Glory to the Martyrs'' _ ``Down
With Warlords'' _ ``Our Hearts Are Bleeding For The Students'' _
``Help Us Stop the Massacre'' _ ``Retribution!''
   One sign said: ``President Bush _ Read Our Lips _ Break Ties to
Killer Government.''
   Addressing the students, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said Bush took ``the exact, appropriate steps. ...
I applaud his statement, I applaud his deeds.''
   ``We should provide our arms only to those who use them for
defense and to advance the cause of liberty and democracy,''
Cranston said. ``Otherwise, what do we stand for?''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., took a harder stand, saying he will
introduce legislation to suspend trade and investment ``if the
atrocities continue.''
   Later, Helms told reporters: ``You cannot deal with rattlesnakes
and you cannot deal with communist governments. They are all
rattlesnakes and they will bite you when the occasion arises.''
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said events in Beijing have called into
question the legitimacy of the existing government.
   ``When the statue of liberty was toppled, when the army turned
against the people, the legitimacy of the government of the
People's Republic of China collapsed,'' Leach said.
   Inside the Capitol, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, endorsed Bush's suspension of U.S.
military sales adding, ``We will need to watch developments closely
to determine what additional measures are necessary.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said Bush's appeals ``could help
to encourage forces of moderation within the (Chinese) army.
   He said the message being sent from Washington is that further
violence ``will profoundly threaten the future relationship between
our two countries.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said: ``No government can long survive at odds
with its own people.''
   ``The events in Tiananmen Square may have sealed the fate of the
current Chinese leadership,'' Lugar said. ``It may take three
months or three years but eventually the students will prevail.''
   The leaders of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus _ Reps.
John Porter, R-Ill., and Tom Lantos, D-Calif. _ issued a statement
urging Bush to recall the U.S. ambassador to China, a step Bush
says would be counterproductive.
   On the House floor, Rep. James Bilbray, D-Nev., urged a national
letter-writing campaign to bombard the Chinese Embassy here with
expressions of ``abhorrence over what happened.''
   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said: ``The American honeymoon and
love feast with China that was started in 1971 by Richard Nixon is
over.''
   In Tallahassee, Fla., Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he wants the United
States to meet with other industrialized democratic nations to come
up with a unified response to the situation in China.
   ``It's not only important for the United States to make a strong
moral satement, but that people join together everywhere to protest
this brutality that has existed,'' Fascell said.
   Fascell commented to a group of Chinese students gathered
outside the church where Rep. Claude Pepper's funeral was held.
   Among the demonstrations:
   _About 200 people rallied on the Capitol steps in Austin,
shouting, ``Down with communism'' and ``Power to the people.''
   _About 200 Chinese students marched from the University of
Nebraska in Lincoln to the state Capitol eight blocks away,
carrying effigies of Premier Li Peng and senior leader Deng
Xiaoping and posters calling Li a ``vampire.''
   _About 150 people gathered at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham. Shen-Quan Ho, a student from Tianjin, China, said young
people in China are determined to fight even if it means death.
   ``They are martyrs fighting for freedom, and Chinese all over
the world are proud of them,'' he said.

   The search for ways to predict some of
nature's most unpredictable rampages is examined in a new
documentary Wednesday in the PBS series ``The Infinite Voyage.''
   The special, ``Living With Disaster,'' looks at hurricanes,
tornadoes, volcanoes, earthquakes and a recently discovered
atmospheric phenomenon, the microburst, which has knocked airliners
out of the sky.
   In central California, Dr. Allen Lindh, a seismologist with the
U.S. Geological Survey, is working on a program to predict the next
major earthquake.
   In Denver, Dr. Wayne Sand is helping to develop computer
software for a radar that will warn air traffic controllers and
pilots of a microburst.
   ``We can't control these natural forces,'' said producer Gail
Willumsen, ``but through scientific research we are learning how to
better predict disasters and live through them.''
   ``Living With Disaster'' is tied in with the International
Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, which begins in 1990. The
United Nations proclaimed the observance to recognize scientific
and technological advances that help save lives and lessen property
damage.
   The show, the eighth in ``The Infinite Voyage'' series, was
produced by WQED-TV, Pittsburgh. It will be shown next week on some
commercial stations and on cable.
   The area around Parkfield, Calif., along the San Andreas fault,
is one of the most closely monitored earthquake areas in the world.
Hundreds of sensors measure earth movement, and lasers calculate
any shift in the fault. The seismologists expect an earthquake in
the Parkfield area measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale sometime in
the next year or two. The last five earthquakes there have been in
that range.
   ``All the data is fed into computers that give us precise
information on small earthquakes in the area,'' said Lindh. ``We
know that Parkfield earthquakes in 1934 and 1966 were preceded by
foreshock sequences. We're monitoring the area looking for
foreshocks. Our first line of defense is to identify these
foreshocks as they occur. That will give us an indication that the
main event is about to occur.''
   Lindh said as yet they could not predict the next great
earthquake. ``We're at the stage of learning to crawl before we
walk,'' he said. ``Our focus now is on Parkfield. After that, we
can evaluate whether gearing up for a major earthquake in Southern
California is justified.''
   The microburst, also known as windshear or divergent wind flow,
has been recognized as a hazard to aviation for only about 10
years, said Sand. The flows develop beneath thunderstorms. They are
known to have caused airliner crashes in New Orleans and Dallas and
are a possible cause of several crashes since the late 1960s.
   ``The microbursts form rapidly, but the computer software we've
developed to detect these events looks for precursors that give us
a warning,'' said Sand, deputy manager for the research
applications program at the National Center for Atmospheric
Research at Denver's Stapleton Airport. ``You can anticipate them
to some degree.''
   Sand said the downward flow of air beneath a thunderstorm hits
the earth and sprays out in all directions, like a garden hose
spraying water on a sidewalk. An airplane flying through this would
hit sudden headwinds, followed by a downdraft, followed by
tailwinds.
   ``An event in Denver last summer showed a difference of 80 knots
in the wind speed as it changed direction 180 degrees,'' Sand said.
   The documentary also looks at sea erosion at Ocean City, Md.,
where Dr. Stephen Leatherman, a coastal geologist with the
University of Maryland, says condominium buildings in the resort
could be under water in less than 11 years.
   The death and destruction from the earthquake in Soviet Armenia
were due largely to poor building design and construction,
according to Dr. Peter Yanev, who was a member of the National
Academy of Sciences delegation that reached Armenia within days of
the great quake. He warns that similar construction is found in
such earthquake-prone cities in this country as Boston and Salt
Lake City.

<HEAD>Bush Copes With Success</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Bush was asked whether his
journey to the western summit was his greatest political triumph,
he smiled and said ``No'' without an instant's hesitation.
   Was it his election to be president? ``Now we're talking,'' Bush
said, relaxed and satisfied as Air Force One neared the runway
Friday, ending his week-long diplomatic mission. He called it a
triumph for the Western alliance and for Western values.
   It had been his best week since the inauguration. Now the
challenge is to make it last. The successes that heartened Bush and
his high command are preliminary.
   Proposals are not achievements. And the agenda already has
changed, posting a new challenge. What was to have been a series of
leadership briefings on NATO turned instead from last week's
success to this week's crisis _ the savage Chinese crackdown on
protesters demanding democracy.
   Still, there are points in any political career at which one
turn can alter the whole plot.
   For Bush, one came in the summer of 1980, when Ronald Reagan put
him on the ticket after an improbable mini-boom for former
President Gerald R. Ford as vice president.
   There was another in the winter of 1988 when Bush, his
presidential candidacy in trouble, turned it around with victory in
the New Hampshire presidential primary.
   Europe '89 could become that kind of landmark in the Bush
presidency. There's a lot to be done first. But Bush did get one
immediate dividend _ he came home to altered perceptions of his
leadership.
   He went to the NATO summit at Brussels under fire at home from
critics who said he was too slow and too timid in dealing with the
peace offensive of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   At NATO, Bush launched his own, and the allies unanimously
embraced it. He proposed sharp cutbacks in conventional forces, and
he said it ought to be done by 1992 or 1993.
   In addition, the administration engineered an alliance
compromise on the timetable for negotiations for cutbacks in
short-range nuclear missiles.
   All this cast Bush as a decisive leader of the alliance _ he
said it showed the way he intends to lead the free world. In short
order, he seemed to have overcome a springtime of criticism over
style, pace and proposals.
   Bush had commissioned a foreign policy review that dragged well
into May, and followed it with a series of four foreign policy
speeches that were intended to describe his vision but were long on
rhetoric and philosophy, short on proposals.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu said those speeches were
an essential part of the Bush plan. He said they were written to
send signals to Europe, east and west, and to the Soviet Union.
``It was a hard time for us to go through and make sure we did that
part right _ and keep hearing that nothing was happening,'' Sununu
said.
   Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, said Bush was
determined to make all his proposals on Europe at Brussels, rather
than have them disclosed in advance and made into a fait accompli.
   ``Fortunately, it all came together right,'' Sununu said.
   At least for openers. There's still a long course to cover. Bush
said he will press the U.S. and NATO bureaucracies to swiftly
convert the ideas into a package that can be put before the Soviet
Union when the conventional weapons talks resume in Vienna on Sept.
7.
   That's a challenge. The weapons Bush proposals to curb must be
defined in treaty terms the United States and the Soviet Union both
can accept. Moscow already is talking about including some things
NATO omits. There also is likely to be a demand that cutbacks
include U.S. Navy forces.
   Scowcroft said verification of the proposed cuts will be a
problem but should be manageable.
   So far what has happened is that the president has gained NATO
endorsement of his plan to cut about 30,000 U.S. troops in NATO if
the Soviets will withdraw ten times that many. That's a deal no
ally would be likely to refuse, even if NATO were in the habit of
rebuffing American presidents.
   The hard part comes at the bargaining table with Soviet
negotiators. Nothing goes on the arms control scoreboard unless
there's a deal there.
   Nevertheless, Bush already has scored politically. ``This
helps,'' Sununu said. ``We're going to try to take full advantage
of it.''
   That's been done before. Nothing perks up a presidency like a
successful foreign mission. ``We're not going to turn out backs on
any time-honored successful techniques,'' Sununu said.

<NOTE>EDITORS' NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a Supreme Court guarantee that U.S.
prisoners receive medical care, many still clamor for improvement.
They say treatment remains inadequate, sometimes slipshod, largely
because good doctors steer clear of their grimly crowded, padlocked
societies. The court guarantee has been further dulled by two
developments no justices could have foreseen: the onslaught of AIDS
and the graying of the prison population. ``People should not go to
prison to die for lack of health care. We're better than that as a
country,'' says inmates' advocate William Rold. This is the first
story in a three-part AP Extra series, ``Medicine Behind Bars.''

   Medicine behind bars begins with the fundamental
paradox of caring for misfits banished by a society that could care
less about their well-being.
   Add a heap of more specific problems and the provision of health
care in prisons becomes a constant struggle.
   Doctors and nurses, in great demand in the outside world, must
be recruited to work for civil service wages in steel-bar
surroundings. A federal program that helped in this search, the
National Health Service Corps, which allowed doctors to pay off
school loans by working in prisons, was dismantled by the Reagan
administration.
   The patients are murderers, rapists, drug dealers and thieves
who bring a hodgepodge of untreated ailments into prison.
   Overcrowded cellblocks sizzle with the fear of AIDS, as well as
tuberculosis and other contagious diseases. Prisons are being
forced to open costly geriatric units to treat chronic heart, lung
and other conditions of graying inmates.
   And the source of relief for many other societal ills, the state
lawmaker, has been more likely to dole out condemnation than
compassion for criminals who can't vote.
   Inmates' advocates say quality medical care in prisons is
elusive despite court orders, national guidelines and more money
grudgingly given.
   ``There's a general contradiction in providing health services
and locking people up in steel cages. Prisons deform everybody,''
said Robert Cohen, former medical director at New York City's
Rikers Island Prison and an expert medical witness in health-care
suits.
   Added Armond Start, medical director of the Wisconsin prison
system, ``Prisons are the most anti-therapeutic places there are.''
   Too, most Americans feel indifferent about prisoners' rights.
   ``Prisoners are a pariah kind of constituency,'' said Edward
Koren of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``We treat them like
garbage. You leave it outside in the trash can and don't want to
see it again. Nobody cares, unless it comes back again.''
   Said Minnesota inmate Henry Jackson, a 69-year-old sex offender
who has diabetes and high blood pressure, ``We're just dogs. We're
nothing.''
   Medical care, however, is a legal obligation.
   A 1976 Supreme Court ruling said ``deliberate indifference to
serious medical problems of inmates constitutes cruel and unusual
punishment.'' It made prisoners the only class of U.S. citizen
guaranteed health care by the government.
   But having the right to care doesn't guarantee Mayo Clinic-style
treatment. Because no federal or state authority has spelled out
what constitutes adequate medical care, quality is a matter of
court interpretation. Since 1982, only 10 percent of the nation's
600 prisons have met voluntary guidelines set by health
professionals.
   The following court cases are all based on prison care provided
since the guidelines were issued:
   _Six inmates died at a Pittsburgh prison in the last two years
after getting ``appalling, shocking and dangerously inadequate''
medical care, according to Cohen, who testified in May in a federal
case brought by several inmates. Cohen said an AIDS-afflicted
prisoner died of pneumonia, a diabetic from lack of insulin; the
other deaths are alleged to have resulted from improper diagnosis
and treatment of heart attacks and cancer.
   _At Minnesota's Stillwater Prison, one-third of the 1,200
inmates and at least five guards were infected with tuberculosis
from 1982 through 1986. The first case wasn't diagnosed until six
months after the inmate went to sick call, and officials waited two
years after inmates filed suit to test the prison for the air-borne
germ.
   _A 25-year-old convict died in May 1987 during an asthma attack
at Deer Island House of Corrections, a pre-Civil War lockup near
Boston. According to a current wrongful death suit, the man was
turned away from the infirmary at the 8 p.m. lockup, and the guards
who dragged him to his cell ignored agony so intense that the
inmate urinated as he was hauled up three flights of stairs.
   _Hospitalized inmates from Rikers Island were shackled to bed
frames and watched by guards until 20 months ago. They included
AIDS patients, pregnant women and inmates on life support systems.
``They were too ill to get out of bed, much less get out of the
building,'' said Dale Wilker of the Prisoners Rights Project, which
sued to have the shackles unlocked.
   _At New York's Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women,
several patients had to be hospitalized because dentist Donald
Collings' drill slipped in their mouths while he was drunk,
according to a 1984 suit filed by the Prisoners Rights Project.
Collings resigned, and the state paid damages of $650,000.
   Medical care remains a favorite target of lawsuits filed by U.S.
inmates, who totaled a record 627,402 in January.
   Courts have ordered eight states and Puerto Rico to improve
prison health care throughout their systems and are demanding
corrective action at individual prisons in 30 other states.
Lawsuits are pending in five states, according to the ACLU.
   Still, there is unanimous agreement that prison medical care has
been bettered since courts prescribed legal remedies.
   Robert Brutsche, who served 19 years as medical director of the
Federal Bureau of Prisons before retiring in 1988, said care had
``improved by light years. The changes are like night and day.''
   One indication of progress is funding.
   The states spent $80 million on prison health care in 1975 and
$215 million in 1980, according to a 50-state survey by The
Associated Press. The health-care costs this year will be about $1
billion, or about 8 percent of the $16 billion tab it costs to
house inmates, according to national estimates.
   Michigan spends the most of any state, an average of $7.58 per
day for prison health care, according to Corrections Yearbook.
Hawaii spends the least, $1.14. The national average is $3.57.
   The tide of reform began 15 years ago, when federal Judge Frank
Johnson found ``barbarous'' and ``shocking'' conditions in Alabama
and for the first time placed an entire state system under federal
control.
   Johnson said ``unsupervised prisoners without formal training
regularly pull teeth, screen sick-call patients, dispense as well
as administer medication, give injections, take X-rays, suture and
perform minor surgery.''
   The conditions, which inmates' attorney Matthew Myers called
``symptomatic of a national crisis,'' included these atrocities:
   _A quadriplegic's bedsores developed into open wounds and were
infested with maggots. His bandages weren't changed in the month
before his death.
   _An inmate who was supposed to get intravenous feeding received
no nourishment for three days before his death.
   _An inmate who'd had a stroke was forced to sit on a bench so he
wouldn't dirty his bed. But he fell so frequently his legs became
swollen and crippled, and he died a day after one leg was amputated.
   Alabama bettered conditions enough that federal control was
lifted last December.

   One problem Alabama shared with other states was allowing
doctors to practice on inmates even when not licensed to treat the
public. It was the first state to hire a private company that used
fully licensed doctors to provide medical care in its prisons; now
all or part of care in 29 states comes from private providers.
   ``The norm 15 years ago was a broken-down doctor with an
institutional license, someone who couldn't practice on the outside
because he was too old, too sick or an alcoholic,'' said Dr. Jay
Anno of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care.
   About the same time the courts began correcting ills, health
groups were seeking reform, reacting to conditions exposed by
several prison disorders, including the 1971 riot at Attica, N.Y.
   What evolved was the National Commission on Correctional Health
Care, which determined 71 minimum things prisons should provide.
About 60 prisons have met the standards since 1982.
   The guidelines include medical screening of all incoming
inmates, daily access to sick call, 24-hour nursing care for
inpatients, and requiring uniform licensing and regulation of
doctors, nurses and other staff.
   While most states now assure their prison physicians are
properly licensed, problems with doctors persist.
   In the hiring competition, many prisons turn to doctors from
foreign medical schools who struggle with English.
   ``That doesn't necessarily mean they're quacks. Their English is
terrible, and they have a hard time communicating,'' said William
Rold of the Prisoners Rights Project in New York.
   Doctors in prison may also be treating ailments for which they
have no training. In the 1970s, a gynecologist did dental exams at
Bedford Hills, the Prisoners Rights Project said. In another New
York prison, a pathologist practiced general medicine, and a
pediatrician served as an internist.
   Salaries are one of the biggest barriers to attracting doctors.
   Hawaii, for example, pays prison doctors $35,000 a year, about
half what they could earn outside. One-third of the nursing slots
in Hawaii's prisons are unfilled.
   ``What doctor in his right mind would want to practice medicine
for civil-service pay under harsh conditions for a group of
patients that doesn't like or trust him?'' said Curtis Prout,
director of the internship program at Harvard Medical School.
   Added Dr. Ronald Shansky, medical director of the Illinois
prison system: ``No one goes to medical school and says, `Boy, when
I get out, I'm going to go to a prison and make my mark.'''

   It was bad enough Antti Haavisto
coughed up blood in his prison cell all night. He also had to
listen to death threats from neighboring inmates kept sleepless by
the diseased man's ceaseless hacking.
   ``Hurry up and die,'' convicts snarled through the steel bars
inside Stillwater Prison in eastern Minnesota. ``Shut up or we'll
shut you up.''
   Haavisto's lungs were being consumed by tuberculosis, which
remained undiagnosed through 11 visits to sick call over six months
in 1982. Prison doctors failed to spot the TB on two X-rays;
although Haavisto was coughing up sputum with the consistency of
sludge, the doctors told him he had emphysema or pneumonia and gave
him cough drops to ease the hacking.
   ``I thought I was going to die. I couldn't get air in, and I
couldn't cough that mud out. I almost drowned twice,'' said the
wheezing Haavisto, a Finnish immigrant convicted of manslaughter.
   ``Before I'd go to eat, I tried to cough up enough stuff so I
didn't bother anyone. I was afraid they would hate me and beat me
up,'' Haavisto, 64, said in an interview.
   Even after Haavisto was diagnosed and released from prison in
May 1983, the air-borne germ stalked the Stillwater cellblocks.
   One year after Haavisto's diagnosis, the prisoner in the next
cell came down with TB. An outbreak occurred in 1984, when inmates
sued the prison for deficient medical care, and another rash of
infections hit in 1986, when the entire prison was finally tested.
   Ultimately, one-third of the 1,200 inmates and at least five
guards were infected.
   Tuberculosis is a bacterial lung disease once known as
consumption because it eats away lung tissue. Scientists estimate
10 million Americans are infected, but the vast majority will never
get the disease.
   TB is far worse in crowded prisons. Lawyers and inmate advocates
say TB outbreaks show what can happen when a contagious disease
infects a closed environment with antiquated ventilation systems
and inattentive medical watchdogs.
   The incidence of TB among prisoners is more than triple the rate
of those not in jail, according to a May report by the federal
Centers for Disease Control. In New Jersey, the rate is 11 times
higher for inmates; in California, six times higher. New York
prisons had a sevenfold increase in the disease in the 10-year
period ending in 1986.
   The CDC recommended these corrective measures for prisons: TB
tests at least once a year, quick X-rays for inmates showing
symptoms and isolation of those infected.
   In Minnesota, federal Judge Diana Murphy said the handling of
the epidemic by prison officials and the state Department of Health
``evidenced a lack of care or reckless disregard for the medical
needs of inmates.''
   In January, five years after the lawsuit was filed, she ruled
that conditions had improved and there was no need to order
corrective actions.
   Nevertheless, she severely criticized prison administrators,
saying they ``passed off responsibility to Department of Health,
which assigned reponsibility to the doctors, who denied any role in
managing the crisis other than providing primary care.''
   ``It was a shocking case of negligence,'' said Stephen Miles of
the University of Chicago's Center for Clinical Medical Ethics.
``Prisoners were not only incarcerated but negligently exposed to a
contagious disease.''
   ``The prison became a pest hole of tuberculosis infection. Not
only was there neglect, prison officials turned a blind eye to
known facts. There was recklessness,'' said Arlo Vandevegte,
attorney for the inmates who sued the state.
   Haavisto apparently brought the TB with him into Stillwater. On
his trips to sick call, he even suggested the medical staff check
for TB.
   ``I told them I think I got some real bad problem. I couldn't
talk. I couldn't even make a phone call it was so bad,'' Haavisto
said. ``I said I got to get out of this hole or I'm going to die in
here.''
   Inmate Tony DeGidio contracted TB during the epidemic. His
father caught it when he came to the prison to visit Tony.
   ``You're trapped. You don't have a way out,'' DeGidio said. ``We
used to tell the guards to do something. This guy's got a problem.
Treat it or we're going to treat it our way. Eliminate him.''
   Prison officials say treatment and tracking have improved.
   ``We don't have those problems now,'' said LeRoy Siegel,
executive assistant to Stillwater's warden. ``We responded the way
the so-called experts told us to.''

   Take a population rejected by society for its
misdeeds. Then look the other way when a killer virus takes hold
and the afflicted complain about cruel treatment and deficient
medical care. That's the impact of AIDS in prison. ``Prisoners are
regarded as ... people who don't matter. It's a double stigma for
inmates with AIDS,'' said Nick Fruedenberg, a New York expert on
AIDS counseling and education. The second story in a three-part AP
Extra series, ``Medicine Behind Bars,'' addresses care and
treatment of inmates with AIDS.

   Carmen Harris, isolated with other female
Alabama prisoners carrying the AIDS virus, feared she would bleed
to death in her cell.
   Stitches from routine uterine surgery had torn open, but nurses
on three shifts failed to answer her pleas for help in November
1987, she said.
   ``They was afraid of the blood. They was afraid of catching the
virus. They had a fear of the word AIDS,'' said Ms. Harris, who
waited 12 hours before she was taken to a hospital near Montgomery.
   ``You're treated like an alien, like you had the plague,'' she
said. ``I got sentenced for manslaughter. The judge could have just
as well sentenced me to death row. It's like being punished for my
crime and my diagnosis.''
   Behind prison walls, AIDS is a crackling health issue.
   Some states isolate inmates who have the virus even if they
haven't developed symptoms. Those in segregation consider it cruel
confinement to a new death row. Prison officials defend it as a way
to contain the virus and protect those infected from harm.
   While arguments can be made for segregation, nothing excuses the
failure to provide medical care, inmates' advocates say. Yet
prisons aren't equipped to treat the long-term debilitating
illnesses wrought by AIDS.
   ``Those on the new death row are not getting appropriate medical
attention. They are being condemned to waste away,'' said Benjamin
Schatz, director of the AIDS Civil Rights Project of the National
Gay Rights Advocates. ``They are treated as if infection indicates
they have done something wrong.''
   ``AIDS has made the job of providing prison health care more
difficult, more hazardous and more expensive,'' said Curtis Prout,
director of the internship program at Harvard Medical School.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most commonly transmitted
during homosexual acts and the sharing of contaminated needles
while injecting drugs, two behaviors common among prisoners.
   In the most recent count last October, 3,136 AIDS cases had been
diagnosed among the U.S. prison population of more than 627,000,
according to the National Institute of Justice. AIDS in prison
increased 60 percent last year, as against a 76 percent jump in the
general population, which can pursue high-risk behaviors more
freely.
   Alabama and five other states _ California, Georgia, Nevada,
Tennessee and Wyoming _ segregate prisoners who carry the HIV virus
that causes AIDS, whether or not they have the disease.
   Prisoners with full-blown AIDS are segregated in 20 other
states, and 14 states test or will soon start testing all incoming
inmates for the disease.
   Federal prisons randomly test 10 percent of incoming inmates and
all those leaving the system. Those with AIDS or the virus are not
isolated.
   Mandatory mass screening and segregation of all HIV-positive
inmates is opposed by the National Commission on Correctional
Health Care, which sets voluntary standards for health care in
prisons. It favors solutions such as education and changing
behaviors that cause AIDS.
   Alabama inmates who tested positive to the AIDS virus have
charged in a class action lawsuit that they receive poor medical
care and cruel treatment. The federal trial began in March.
   Suits are pending in two other states that segregate. Inmates
with AIDS in Connecticut say their medical care is grossly
inadequate. California prisoners assert that the level of their
medical and psychiatric care is ``atrocious.''
   ``They're treated like lepers. They might as well be wearing a
scarlet letter. They're shunned, ostracized and stigmatized,'' said
Alexa Freeman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union,
which filed the Alabama suit.
   ``There is no logic, no rational basis and no medical basis to
the (segregation) policy,'' said Robert Cohen, former medical
director at New York City's Rikers Island Prison and an expert
medical witness. ``It is only fear and discrimination which gives
rise to such barbarous actions.''
   Of the 12,000 inmates in Alabama, 138 have tested positive for
HIV since 1987. All but eight are men.
   Men are segregated at the Limestone Correctional Facility inside
Dorm 7, where even the exercise yard is cut off from the main yard
by a 14-foot-high chain-link fence topped with razor wire.
   The sense of doom is so heavy that inmates call it Thunder Dorm,
recalling the futuristic city in ``Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,'' a
movie about society's collapse after a nuclear holocaust.
   Inmates eat with wooden ice cream sticks instead of forks and
spoons. Meals come on color-coded trays. Their dirty laundry goes
out in red plastic bags so it is washed separately.
   They worship apart from other inmates and don't have equal
access to programs that would allow them to have jobs or earn early
parole.
   One inmate with the virus was forced to mop the halls behind him
as he walked. Others were given surgical masks and made to clean
telephones with bleach or ammonia swabs after making calls.
   ``The same hysteria on the streets is multiplied in prison,''
said Alvin Bronstein of the ACLU.
   Michael Marsh, 41, a thief, said life in Thunder Dorm features
fights, knifings and high-risk sex among prisoners who figure
they're going to die anyway.
   ``Guys would rather be killed here than die from AIDS. They
hunger for death another way. Any other way. Something that would
be honorable,'' Marsh said. ``It's like living in the valley of the
shadow of death. If AIDS don't kill you, one of the guys might.''
   Some inmates want to keep the HIV prisoners isolated, saying
those infected would be killed ``as soon as they got into the
yard.''
   ``It's either we take them out or they take us out,'' said
Stewart Hughey, 28, a rapist, who testified in favor of segregation
in the Alabama case. ``If one of them gets his semen or blood on an
open cut, they just signed your death warrant.''
   In New York state, where AIDS is the leading cause of death
among inmates, medical care is deficient, according to an 18-month
study released last year by the Correctional Association of New
York.
   Doctors were unfamiliar with AIDS treatment and detection, the
study said. Since 1981, more than 500 prisoners have died of AIDS;
in 25 percent of the cases, the disease was not diagnosed until an
autopsy.
   Prisoners with AIDS also have an unusually low survival rate,
the report said.
   Inmates from New York City who got the disease from dirty
needles had a mean survival rate of 159 days, half that of those in
the outside community with similar backgrounds.
   ``AIDS and prison is proving to be a devastating combination,''
said Cathy Potler, author of the report. ``Imprisonment becomes a
virtual death sentence.''

   State and federal prisons, already straining to
meet the court-ordered medical needs of record numbers of inmates,
face the costly new problem of geriatrics. The growing population
of those graying behind bars requires long-term care, special diets
and treatment for failing eyes and teeth. Some prisons have
geriatric units, but as one New Jersey corrections official says,
``We know how to run prisons. We don't know how to run old-age
homes.'' The last of a three-part series, ``Medicine Behind Bars,''
looks at elderly care in prisons.

   Augustus Bass has had seven heart attacks
and a stroke. He has arthritis, high blood pressure and recurring
chest pains. The 67-year-old man is also locked up in prison,
serving 5-15 years for manslaughter.
   ``This is a good place to bring you to let you die,'' said Bass,
his close-cropped beard and thinning hair flecked with gray. ``If
you have a heart attack in prison, you're up the creek without a
paddle.
   ``It's pretty depressing to be old and in prison,'' said Bass,
who limps about with a cane. ``Every time you get a pain in your
chest, you don't know if it's the last time. I just don't want to
die in here. You'd just be another number gone.''
   Bass is 2{ years into his sentence at Kansas' Norton
Correctional Facility, where prison officials are building a
geriatric unit to care for the special medical needs of elderly
inmates.
   Nationwide, the number of graying prisoners is growing, due to a
rising prison population and the introduction of nonparole and
mandatory sentences in the mid-1970s. And they are beginning to
pose costly health care problems.
   As of last summer, 18,801 prisoners were older than 55, a 50
percent increase in four years, according to a tally by the
American Correctional Association. Florida expects its elderly
population to grow by 129 percent in 11 years.
   These elderly inmates, still a fraction of the 627,402 total
prisoners, may have chronic heart, liver, lung and kidney
conditions. Some suffer from cancer, diabetes, strokes, Alzheimer's
disease, high blood pressure, arthritis and the effects of years of
alcohol and drug abuse.
   They may need foods free of salt and sugar, not the starchy fare
served in mess halls now. They require hearing aids, eye glasses
and dentures. They may need ramps and elevators for their canes and
wheelchairs. Or they may need an extra blanket in winter or a
firmer mattress for their frail backs.
   ``Prisons were not designed for older people,'' said Julia Hall,
a social psychologist at Drexel University specializing in aging
and criminals. ``Nobody is brutalizing them or purposely neglecting
them, but nobody is prepared to care for them and it is costly.''
   Kansas, where the elderly prison population doubled in six
years, has 153 inmates over 55, including 31 who are past 65.
   A geriatric unit is being built at a former state tuberculosis
hospital and mental unit surrounded by farm fields, four miles
outside this prairie town of 3,400 residents.
   The unit will be more like a college dorm than a prison
cellblock. Outer doors, including one leading to the chapel, have
wheelchair ramps.
   Cells are converted hospital rooms and close with wooden doors
rather than steel bars. Inmates, all medium- or minimum-security
prisoners, will have keys to their rooms.
   Prison staff will be specially trained to be more sensitive to
older inmates' needs. A gym and basketball court would presumably
get little use, so the recreation room will have board games. Each
cell has a cable TV hookup to accommodate inmates too infirm to
work.
   ``It's been a neglected population. Older people have more
medical problems,'' said Louis Bruce, director of the Norton
prison. ``When you get older, you don't see as well, you don't hear
as well and you just can't get around as well.''
   Corrections officials also want to separate them from young,
bullying inmates who might harm them.
   ``They can't fend for themselves. They just become easy prey.
They're pretty fair game,'' said Jay Shelton, assistant prison
director.
   Richard Baker, 66, came to the Norton prison to serve his
1-to-5-year sentence for driving without a license after a drunken
driving conviction. He has emphysema, arthritis and a heart
condition, and he was given a cane after twice falling down steps
at the prison reception center in Topeka.
   ``I don't have any trouble getting down steps. Getting up them
is a different story,'' the white-haired Baker, dressed in prison
denim, said with a laugh.
   But he promptly stopped his joking. ``I don't think the public
or the institution sympathizes with us. The attitude is `let him
die.' If you did the crime, do the time,'' he said. ``I stay to
myself. I stay in my room and play solitary. I don't mix with
crowds. I stay away from excitement.''
   Ernest Smith, 57, serving 4 to 20 years for possession of
marijuana, said, ``Prison is a place called hell. For the elderly,
it's even worse. Everything hurts more in prison. Every emotion is
intensified.''
   The indignities are manifold. Elderly inmates who need
painkillers, medications and sleeping pills must queue up two or
three times a day for single doses _ individual prescriptions in
bottles might encourage black market trade.
   Canes are given to lame or unsteady inmates only under special
conditions, for fear they could become weapons or vehicles for
smuggling contraband. Even wheelchairs are searched.
   ``We know how to run prisons. We don't know how to run old-age
homes,'' said Bud Walsh, an executive assistant in the New Jersey
Department of Corrections.
   His state, where the elderly inmate count is expected to
increase fivefold in 11 years, is considering adding a geriatric
unit. One study projects that 9 of 10 prisoners now in their 30s
will be older than 50 before they get their first chance at parole
or release.
   ``The biggest complaint from elderly inmates is their medical
problems aren't being addressed fast enough,'' Walsh said. ``We
really don't do preventive medicine. We don't have the staff and
the facilities. The regular prison unit is not equipped to handle
the kinds of problems geriatric inmates present. And the medical
costs may be astronomical.''
   The average cost putting someone behind bars for a year is
$23,000, but the tab for an elderly inmate triples, mainly because
of health needs, according to Larry Fultz of the Maryland Parole
Commission.
   Money goes for such expensive operations as heart bypass
surgery, procedures like kidney dialysis or long-term medications
for high blood pressure and enphysema.
   At the Eastern State Correctional Facility near Philadelphia,
inmates formed the Concerned Seniors Group. They meet Thursday
evenings to discuss health care and other issues of concern.
   ``It's a sad way to end a life,'' said Drexel's Hall, who helped
organize the group. ``They have such a sense of despair and
depression. They feel their lives have been totally wasted.''

   In 1984, thousands of Ethiopian Jews, unable to
practice their religion as they chose in their own country, were
secretly airlifted to Israel to begin a new life. This is a report
on how these people of dark skin and different ways are faring
today among Israelis.

   Five years have passed since Ayano Mamo
abandoned his farm and began a months-long odyssey from the forests
of Ethiopia to the Holy Land, where ``all would be bright and
wonderful.''
   Now Mamo, like many of Israel's 16,500 Ethiopian Jewish
immigrants, feels disillusioned and alienated in a country where
quiet, traditional Africans don't quite fit in.
   Their primitive farming methods are not needed, their lack of
sophistication is a cause for condescension, and their skin color
is sometimes a target of discrimination.
   Even their Jewish faith has been questioned.
   The Ethiopians' disappointment is all the greater because of
their harsh struggle to emigrate and their dramatic arrival from
Sudan in the secret ``Operation Moses'' airlift, for which the
United States provided planes and pilots; the operation was
overseen by George Bush, then Ronald Reagan's vice president.
   Mamo's road to Israel was harder than most.
   After leaving his village in 1984, he was detained by
anti-government Ethiopian rebels for one month. They beat his wife
and stole his money.
   Let go, the family joined 150 other emigrants in walking to
Sudan. It took a month, and without adequate food and water their
2-year-old daughter died, one of 10 who perished en route.
   In Sudan, 25 more of the group died because of malnutrition and
disease, including Mamo's aunt, uncle and three nephews.
   ``We had faith in the Holy One, blessed be He, that despite the
suffering, He was with us,'' Mamo said through an interpreter in
his native Amharic at his apartment in the southern coastal city of
Ashkelon.
   As he walked through the desert, Mamo said, he ``thought about
the Israel of my dreams. All would be bright and wonderful. Even at
night there would be sunshine, after we gathered in from the
exile.''
   Five years since the exodus, almost 30 percent of Ethiopians
still live in dormitory-style government housing centers. The
National Council for Ethiopian Jews says unemployment among the
Ethiopian immigrants above age 35 is about 45 percent.
   Mamo, 54, lives in a small government-supplied apartment with
his wife and four of his chidren. He has no job, partly because he
acquired a blood disease from drinking polluted water on the trek
to Sudan and cannot do heavy work.
   The apartment complex where he lives is filled with almost 2,000
Ethiopian immigrants and is disparagingly called the ``Ethiopian
Ghetto'' by unsympathetic neighbors.
   Israel officials say they are making progress in settling the
new immigrants. The children have proven able to quickly adapt to
the new culture, with more than 400 Ethiopians enrolled in Israeli
universities and many others serving in elite army units.
   But officials concede the newest immigrants had more
difficulties than any of the Jewish communities that came from
Europe, the Middle East and North Africa as part of the
in-gathering that began after the creation of Israel as a nation in
1948.
   ``Most new immigrants spoke French or English and they had some
skills,'' said Uri Gordon, director of immigration and absorption
in the Jewish Agency. ``With the Ethiopians we had to start anew.''
   He said Ethiopian immigrants are given intensive Hebrew classes
and provided social workers to help them acclimate.
   The three-month ``Operation Moses'' airlift in 1984 brought more
than 8,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel, joining others who managed to
flee earlier.
   The new Ethiopian immigrants, many villagers who spoke only
Amharic, found themselves shunted aside in a society known for its
``chutzpah,'' a Hebrew word meaning audacious to the point of
rudeness.
   ``We left our culture and came here where they don't speak our
language or follow our customs, and now we find ourselves in poor
jobs and gaining little respect,'' said Mesfin Ambau, director of
the Jerusalem-based Organization of Ethiopian Immigrants. ``There
is a lot of pain inside.''
   The Ethiopians' first confrontation in Israel was with the
nation's powerful rabbinate, which ruled that the community, after
2,000 years of isolation from world Jewry, had deviated in its
religious practice and needed to undergo symbolic conversions.
   ``Nothing hurt us more than that,'' said Ziv Sahelev, 20, an
Ethiopian immigrant who lives in a government absorption center.
   The Ethiopians refused any type of conversions, and the
rabbinate was forced to seek a compromise that quieted the dispute.
   Like more than a third of the Ethiopian community, Sahalev left
behind close relatives, in his case his father and three sisters,
on the expectation that he would return and bring them to the
Promised Land.
   But Ethiopia's Marxist government, which has no diplomatic
relations with Israel and close relations with radical Arab states,
halted the airlift shortly after it was disclosed and 15,000 Jews
remain stranded in Ethiopia.
   Rahamim Elazar, director of the National Council for Ethiopian
Jews, said Ethiopian youngsters, many separated from their parents,
have a suicide rate five times higher than other Israeli teen-agers.
   ``There are so many who were left behind and the children feel
terribly guilty,'' he said.
   Sahalev said that since he came to Israel, he has given up hope
of returning to Ethiopia to bring the rest of his family.
   ``I write to them every week, and after a month or two I get an
answer,'' he said.
   Another problem for the Ethiopians is that they are virtually
the only blacks in Israel.
   ``Sometimes people joke with me and point at me and start
saying, `Look, he's black,''' Sahalev said. ``It makes me feel very
uncomfortable.''
   In Kiryat Chaim, a residential area of small cottages near Haifa
in northern Israel, neighbors rose up in protest when the Jewish
Agency moved four large Ethiopian families into the area's only
apartment complex in January.
   ``It's a quiet area and people came to me and complained that
the Ethiopian children made noise at night, they didn't throw their
garbage away,'' said Giora Fischer, district head of Kiryat Chaim.
   ``In informal ways, they also made it clear to me that they felt
their property values were declining.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Some 35 million Americans lack health insurance
and, according to some estimates, as many as 250,000 patients are
batted from hospital to hospital each year because they can't pay
the bills. Here is the story of the first doctor prosecuted under
the nation's patient dumping law and the circumstances surrounding
his decision to transfer a woman about to give birth.

   It was Dr. Michael Burditt's day off when
Rosa Rivera showed up at DeTar Hospital late on a Friday afternoon,
poor, uninsured and about to give birth to her sixth baby.
   Her blood pressure also was high, so high that the obstetrician
asked the nurse who called him to repeat the figures.
   ``I didn't think I'd heard what I heard,'' Burditt recalls.
   There was no mistake. Rosa Rivera's blood pressure was 210 over
130 _ higher than any Burditt had seen in 12 years of delivering
babies in this South Texas city.
   In one respect, Rosa Rivera was not unusual at all. Poor
pregnant women frequently come to DeTar to give birth without
having seen a doctor before.
   She ``sounds like more than I can handle,'' said Burditt, chief
of the private hospital's obstetrical department. He asked nurse
Tammy Kotsur to arrange for an ambulance to transport the woman to
John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, 160 miles away.
   Kotsur put him on hold, turned to her supervisor, Donna Kiening,
and said, ``He wants to transfer her. What should I tell him?''
   ``Tell him you've got to check on a few things,'' said Kiening,
a by-the-rulebook nurse who had recently become the supervisor of
the OB-GYN department.
   So began a case that eventually would land a doctor in trouble
with Washington and force a new look at an old question: When
should the government second-guess a doctor's judgment in treating
patients.
   The nurses were uneasy because of a new, federal anti-patient
dumping law that was part of something called COBRA, the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.
   Hospitals cannot turn away patients needing emergency care or in
active labor.
   A case could be made that Rosa Rivera qualified on both counts.
   About 2{ hours after arriving at DeTar and after some heated
words between Burditt and the nurses, Rosa Rivera left the hospital
in an ambulance. She had her baby a half-hour later in the
ambulance by the side of the road.
   Mrs. Rivera and her son survived the Dec. 5, 1986, ordeal.
   But DeTar Hospital nearly lost its eligibility for Medicare
funding and Michael Burditt became the first doctor prosecuted
under the patient dumping law.
   DeTar paid a $5,000 fine, but Burditt refused to pay the $25,000
he was assessed. The Texas and American Medical Associations took
his side, and he is now awaiting the verdict of a Health and Human
Services administrative law judge, expected in July.
   Some 35 million Americans lack health insurance. According to
some estimates, as many as 250,000 patients are batted from
hospital to hospital each year because they can't pay the bills.
   The following account is drawn from interviews with Burditt,
Mrs. Rivera and others, as well as the 961-page transcript of the
four-day hearing held in late January in the case of the Inspector
General vs. Michael L. Burditt.

   Rosa Rivera, two days shy of 32, had misgivings about going to
DeTar, then part of the Hospital Corporation of America, the
country's largest for-profit hospital chain.
   ``I had heard that it was a real expensive hospital, that people
had to take money with them,'' Mrs. Rivera said.
   But she felt she had no choice. Citizens Memorial, the county
hospital, had shut its obstetrical unit a few months earlier.
   It had not been an easy year for the Riveras. Rent money was
always a problem, and they had moved at least twice. After losing a
$300-a-week janitor's job, her husband, Adolph Rivera, could only
find part-time work.
   Still, Mrs. Rivera knew she should see a doctor early in her
pregnancy. A doctor at Citizens had warned her in 1982 after her
fifth child was born that she had chronic hypertension.
   At the county clinic they told her to apply for Medicaid. She
was turned down. And her family made too much to qualify for a
Texas medically needy program with an income cutoff of $468 a month.
   Dr. Pattie Dodson, head of the Victoria County Health
Department, said that if Mrs. Rivera had been more persistent, a
clinic nurse would have examined her.
   But Mrs. Rivera gave up looking for free care.
   ``I called several doctors and they all wanted $900. They all
told me they needed a lot of money down _ $400, $600, different
prices. We just didn't have it,'' she said.
   In October 1986, she called the clinic to ask about a midwife.
She says a clerk told her, ``Don't worry about it. When it's time
for you to have your baby, just go to DeTar and they have to see
you.''

   Burditt came to Victoria in 1974 after training in obstetrics at
John Sealy Hospital in Galveston.
   As a state-funded teaching hospital, Sealy routinely accepts
seriously ill transfer patients from hospitals across East Texas.
Its nursery and neonatologists are capable of caring for preemies
and other babies clinging to life by the thinnest of strands.
   Burditt was brought to Victoria by two obstetricians who later
formed the Victoria Women's Clinic. After an acrimonious split in
1982, Burditt felt he couldn't call on a Women's Clinic doctor for
help, even in an emergency.
   Burditt, a broad-shouldered man who favors Stetsons and boots
and relishes the hours he spends outdoors on his cattle ranch, La
Matrice (``The Womb''), chose to practice by himself.
   For two years, Burditt was on call around the clock, 365 days a
year.
   He also was a single parent. Kimberly, then 13, eldest of three
girls, chose to live with her father after her parents split in
1983. ``As best I could, I tried to ensure my presence in her
life,'' Burditt said.
   So Burditt eliminated some of the uncertainties of an
obstetrical practice.
   The sign inside his office door reads, ``We do not accept
Medicare or Medicaid.''
   He screens the patients he does accept, providing a low-cost
ultrasound at 18 weeks that allows him to rule out half the major
fetal abnormalities and to get a better fix on the mother's due
date.
   Burditt, who charges the highest price in town, refers women
with high-risk pregnancies to another doctor in town or to
specialists in Houston or Galveston.

   Burditt induces labor in most of 12 to 15 women whose babies he
delivers each month, allowing the newborn to enter the world at a
more convenient time for mother and doctor alike. He takes Fridays
and weekends off.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Burditt also was on an emergency rotation list in the hospital
to handle ``unaligned'' patients like Rivera who come in without a
doctor.
   In practice, unaligned usually also means poor and uninsured.
   In an era of soaring malpractice insurance premiums, such
patients pose a special worry for the physicians.
   ``They can be very frightening,'' said Dr. Terry Whitehouse, a
Women's Clinic obstetrician. ``You don't know them. You've got no
rapport whatsoever with them. They've got the same access to the
lawyers with the 1-800 numbers that everybody else has got. They've
got the best legal care available post-event, but they've got no
prenatal care before the event.''
   But attending such patients is part of the price physicians pay
for the privilege of practicing at DeTar.
   That Friday, Doye Bridges was next on the rotation. He was out
of town, so the call went to Burditt, who was covering for him.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. Rivera, her water broken, was wheeled into the hospital at
4 p.m.
   Burditt, who insists he would never transfer a patient sight
unseen, said he shifted course to the hospital as soon as the nurse
called him about the Rivera case.
   ``You picture this lady and she's a time bomb to blow her head
off, have a heart attack, amniotic fluid embolism,'' he said. ``She
probably has a baby that could be severely growth retarded...You
don't have any idea where you are or what you're going to be
dealing with.''
   Kotsur had told him not only Rivera's blood pressure, but other
essential facts: Her previous labors lasted 24 hours; her largest
baby was 8 to 9 pounds and breech; her cervix was 3 centimeters
dilated and 70 percent effaced; the baby's head was not yet in
position to come through the birth canal.
   Her contractions were coming every three to five minutes and
lasting 60 seconds.
   In the labor room, Mrs. Rivera said, ``I felt safe. I thought
that it would just be a little bit more and the baby would be
born.''
   When Burditt called back, he asked for Kotsur, but, ``I was
immediately directed to Kiening, which I considered very unusual.''
   Kiening told him that the nurses believed the transfer would be
unsafe because of Mrs. Rivera's blood pressure. She also told him
that she had talked to Jean Herman, the associate director of
nursing, and Charles Sexton, the hospital administrator.
   ``Here all of a sudden I've got this severely ill patient...and
this incompetent nurse is telling me I can't transfer her? That's
bull,'' Burditt said later.
   Kiening told him he'd have to ``come in to evaluate the patient
and make arrangements.''
   ``He said he was on his way.''
   Kiening then asked ``if I could have some orders to start an IV
or if he wanted me to do anything else.''
   Burditt's response was so unusual the nurse didn't write it in
the medical record because she felt ``that would be damaging to Dr.
Burditt.''
   Burditt said she could start an IV on Rivera, but only if the
woman could be transported by ambulance to Galveston.
   ``If she couldn't be transported (by ambulance), I was not to
start an IV because she would need to be transported (by) private
vehicle,'' the nurse said.
   Burditt said later his instructions about the IV were meant just
``to aggravate Donna.''
   Kiening started the IV without waiting to check on the
ambulance. By the time she returned to the nurses' station, Burditt
had arrived.
   As he heade` off to examine Mrs. Rivera, another Labor and
Delivery nurse, Dawn Burns, called out to him.
   ``I have another unaligned patient here. She's bleeding
heavily,'' she said.
   Burditt, next in the alphabetical rotation for unaligned
patients, replied that he would see the new woman, Sylvia Ramirez,
after checking Mrs. Rivera.
   For Burditt, one look at Mrs. Rivera was reassuring.
   ``She didn't look like somebody who had acute hypertension, or
pre-eclampsia,'' he said. ``She looked like a typical multiparous
Latin-American female.''
   Burditt estimated that Rivera was carrying a 6-pound baby,
``smaller than any she'd had before. I felt like we had a
growth-retarded child.'' This confirmed Burditt's first inclination.
   ``This lady was indeed more than I felt like I could handle,''
he recalled.
   It was shortly before 5 p.m. Burditt went to the doctors' lounge
to call John Sealy Hospital.
   Burditt said he knew he'd get ``nothing but a big runaround'' if
he called one of the big hospitals in Houston, 122 miles away.
   ``But I knew that I could call John Sealy Labor and Delivery and
I would talk to somebody,'' he said.
   That somebody turned out to be Dr. Peggy Downing.
   Burditt told her the ambulance had been called, and asked for
instructions. Downing, now practicing in Palmer, Alaska, told him
to start Rivera on magnesium sulfate, an anti-convulsant drug.
   Burditt passed the order on to Kiening.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Jean Herman, meanwhile, informed Burditt it was against the law
to transfer a woman in labor.
   ``Against the law? What are you talking about? I'm a doctor Through
the years, word got out that money was to be made
recycling brass shell casings ejected by aircraft on strafing runs.
That led to a May 1974 incident in which five young men, hired to
collect the casings, died after being abandoned on the range
without provisions.
   There's little likelihood of a repeat tragedy: Most of the
100-rounds-per-second cannons aboard the F-15, F-16 and A-10
aircraft used today spit the valuable casings into containers and
bring them back.
   ``The lead sells for about 25 cents a pound. By the time you
hauled it out, it wouldn't be worth it,'' says Ray Murphy, a
civilian spotter on a gunnery monitoring tower.
   More recently, a Marine helicopter found 22 illegal aliens who
survived an attempt to march north over the range to reach
Interstate 8. Three others died in the ordeal.
   Roberts said history ought to warn visitors to enter the desert
prepared, carrying food, maps and water.
   Luke, home of the 832nd Air Division, is a Tactical Air Command
base and has no heavy bombers, but its fighter pilots must be able
to hit ground targets with cannon fire, bombs or rockets and must
be able to fight enemy aircraft.
   St. John's men use an on-base junkyard to fabricate targets.
Metal drums, laid end-to-end and decorated with fins off old aerial
targets, emerge as aircraft on a runway; old road machinery turns
into a train parked on a siding.
   Pilots are given simulations of every possible target, including
missile emplacements, and are trained on both flat and uneven
terrain.
   He said beginners in aircraft rigged to carry bombs drop a
small, tube-shaped object which contains a smoke charge visible for
miles. But before graduation from tactical training, each pilot
also has to drop a live bomb.
   There's nothing like the experience, says Roberts, a decorated
officer who flew 170 combat hours in Southeast Asia in the 1970s.
   ``It feels different when you drop a 500-pound bomb,'' he says.
``They need to feel it drop off the plane. And also, it's the
training involved in telling somebody, `This is a live weapon.
Preflight it and make sure it has no defects.'''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Not much has changed on the island of Sark in
the past several centuries, except for the Nazi occupation during
World War II, and that suits the islanders just fine. They don't
turn tourists away, but they don't court them either. And the
island's leaders pride themselves more on what they don't do rather
than what they do.

<DATELINE>SARK, Channel Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trapped in a time warp between
England and France, the tiny island of Sark clings to its feudal
ways, resolutely shunning such 20th-century delights as cars,
planes and income tax.
   With high cliffs set in a fickle sea, and a perplexing
constitutional setup to keep the foreigners guessing, Sark remains
what the Victorian poet Algernon Charles Swinburne called a
``small, sweet world of wave-encompassed wonder.''
   Its 560 people are ruled by a ``seigneur'' whose privileges
include the sole right to keep pigeons and female dogs, and a
parliament with 40 hereditary members and 12 elected deputies.
   Land on the 4-square-mile island cannot be sold without the
seigneur's permission, and every real estate deal nets him a 7.5
percent commission. And if he wished, he could sell the whole
island to a new seigneur, subject to royal permission.
   Sark is part of the Channel Island archipelago in the English
Channel, which makes it British but not part of the United Kingdom.
So while London takes care of such trivia as defense and foreign
affairs, Sark's parliament wrestles with the major issues, like
whether to reroute horse-and-carriage traffic to keep horse
droppings off the main street.
   There are no paved roads, drugs, sex crimes or pollution.
   Sark's sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II, but in her capacity as
Duke (not Duchess) of Normandy. It's an anachronism which, like
Sark's French place names, attests to the ebb and flow of French
and English conquest over the centuries.
   Spring sunshine is already brightening the cliffs of Sark as the
morning boat from Guernsey finishes its bumpy 7-mile voyage and
jostles gently into place against the limpet-encrusted jetty.
   Islanders and early-season tourists disembark and wobble up the
stone stairs. Some clamber aboard a tractor-towed wagon for a
one-minute journey into ``town.'' A lady carrying a potted plant is
carried grandly away in a horse-drawn carriage. A few brave souls
prefer the footpath up the savagely steep hill, walking through
carpets of blue wildflowers.
   A short ride by rented bicycle down The Avenue, Sark's main
street, leads past the island's one pay phone and mailbox to the
Seigneurie, the gardened mansion where 61-year-old Michael Beaumont
exerts benign lordship over Sark.
   Beaumont inherited the title from his grandmother, the
redoubtable Dame Sybil Hathaway who ruled Sark for 47 years and
became world-renowned as the woman who kept the 20th century at bay.
   She it was who fended off every bureaucrat, mainland or local,
who tried to tamper with Sark's ways. It was, she wrote, ``a battle
for existence'' against ``men who can take off for the moon but
cannot be reasonable and leave people in peace in this world...''
   She refused to flee when the Wehrmacht overran Sark, and when
World War II was over the captured German occupiers were made to
fix the roads their tanks and trucks had damaged.
   In 1969 she threatened to abdicate rather than let Chief Pleas,
the island parliament, change the law banning cars.
   When she died in 1974 at age 90, many wondered whether Sark
would finally emerge from its time capsule. But Beaumont has
faithfully guarded his grandmother's legacy.
   The seigneurship was quite a career change. He was an engineer
working on guided missiles in Bristol when, as eldest son of the
dame's eldest son, he inherited Sark.
   He's an affable, soft-spoken man of 61 who prefers open-necked
shirts and believes in hands-off government. ``A lot of the power
of the seigneur,'' he says, ``is in his ability NOT to do things,
rather than to do things.''
   Does Sark have any problems? He can't think of any serious ones.

<TEXT>
   Does the island want more tourists? ``Well, we don't want to go
down-market just to attract people, great leisure camps or
Disneylands, anything of that sort.''
   A marina? He looks horrified. ``Oh no, no, no. Nothing like
that.''
   Nor will there be an airport. Concorde's occasional sonic booms
are bad enough. The ban on cars holds firm, and the only motorized
vehicle permitted is the tractor. There are 61 on the island, plus
73 horses and 1,102 bicycles. The dame got about in an electric
wheelchair when arthritis afflicted her, but it took special
legislation in Chief Pleas to make that possible.
   Sark was a wild, pirate-infested place until 1565, when a
Jerseyman named Helier de Carteret set out to clean it up. He
parceled out the land to 40 farmers, giving each a piece of cliff
to guard.
   Sark passed down by sale or inheritance until a 19th-century
seigneur mortgaged it to Dame Sybil's great-grandmother, Marie
Collings, to finance a silver-mining venture on the island. He went
broke, Mrs. Collings foreclosed, and the present seigneurial
dynasty began.
   Many of the seigneurial rights have since fallen away. The
seigneur's veto over legislation, once absolute, is now limited to
21 days. He still gets his cut, or treizieme, on land sales, but
has had to make ends meet by converting part of the seigneurie into
vacation cottages for rent.
   No longer does each farmer have to render a chicken a year to
the seigneur. He'll settle for 85 cents instead.
   The seigneur is still entitled to all flotsam and jetsam on
Sark's coast, but nothing of value ever turns up. ``A few years
back an awful lot of wood arrived on the island,'' Beaumont
recalls, ``and they did phone me up and ask me if I wanted it.'' He
didn't.
   Queen Elizabeth I's charter required the seigneur to pay her an
annual rent totaling ``one-twentieth part of a knight's fee.'' It
didn't, however, foresee inflation. So the check Beaumont mails to
Buckingham Palace every Michaelmas Day is for just $3.04.
   Sark has never had income tax. Welfare, schooling and basic
utilities are financed by the dame's charities, a $1 landing toll
on each of its annual 80,000 visitors, and an annual capital tax.
   Its collection is thoroughly informal. Each householder declares
his wealth to the douzaine, or 12-member finance committee of Chief
Pleas, which takes up to 10 percent. No audits are needed, the
Sarkees say, because everyone knows everyone else's worth.
   With excise duties non-existent, cigarettes and liquor cost half
the mainland price.
   The Channel Islands have become prosperous tax havens. But Sark,
accessible only by small boat, is unattractive to tax exiles, and
anyway, says Beaumont, ``I don't think Sark needs any more people,
and we're not looking for investment.''
   Things are quiet on Sark these days. The last serious crime was
in 1987, when a tire-slashing war broke out between two rival
bike-rental firms.
   So with the court idle and Chief Pleas in recess, the greffier,
or town clerk, is spending his days transcribing the minutes of
Chief Pleas from centuries past.
   He copies the handsome, flowery handwriting onto the backs of
old calendars, and it will then be typed into a computer by his son
Trevor for posterity. He started at 1675 and four years later he is
up to 1928.
   The greffier, John Hamon, doubles as Sark's blacksmith. He's 64,
speaks Gallic-tinged English and can converse in the island's dying
Norman-French patois. And what does he learn from the minutes of
Chief Pleas past?
   ``That as things change, you adapt,'' he says. ``You only have
to look back a few hundred years at the minutes of Chief Pleas to
see that everything that happens today has happened before. So we
manage very well indeed and long may it stay that way.''

   SARK, Channel Islands (AP) _ Sark is a law unto itself. English
courts have no jurisdiction here, so rulings by the seneschal, or
chief magistrate, can only be appealed directly to the queen.
   A prevot (sheriff), connetable (constable) and vingtenier
(deputy) keep the peace and lock offenders in a windowless two-cell
jail, but only for two days. Bigger crimes, such as a tire-slashing
war between rival bike-rental firms, are dealt with in Guernsey,
the island 7 miles away.
   In the 15th century it took a papal threat of eternal damnation
to deter the French, English, Scots and Danes from periodically
pillaging the Channel Islands.
   Today Sark's main aggravation is pub rowdiness, attributable in
part to tax-free liquor at half the mainland price. One summer,
things were so bad that police had to be called in Guernsey.
   Bits of Norman law survive, such as the ``clameur de haro,''
whereby a wronged person declares in front of the offender and a
witness, ``Haro, haro, haro! A l'aide mon prince, on me fait tort''
(Help me, my prince, I am being wronged), followed by the Lord's
Prayer.
   The offender must immediately desist and wait for the court to
rule. It works well in settling trespass cases, which are common on
a tiny island with farmland in short supply.
   Sybil Hathaway, for 47 years the dame of Sark, was sometimes
accused of being a dictator. She showed her mettle in 1969 when she
threatened to abdicate unless Chief Pleas, the island parliament,
behaved itself.
   ``I feel that it becomes unbearable when the very laws that are
made by Chief Pleas are broken by the members themselves,'' she
declared then. ``I can no longer publicize the island as a haven of
rest when there are 42 tractors, few of which obey the traffic
laws..I am tired of...the utter disregard for the (pub) licensing
laws.''
   But she also was fed up with fielding everybody's complaints
``as if I were personally to blame for everything that other people
dislike...After all, I have only one vote in Chief Pleas like
everyone else and, contrary to what many imagine, I have no power
to impose any views of my own.''
   The abdication threat worked. The laws were tightened, and the
dame ruled on until her death five years later at age 90.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Do people love their pets enough to pay for
their braces, a few root canals and crowns, or even just some
dental checkups? A growing number of veterinarians are deciding
that the answer is yes. Pet dentistry, though still in its infancy,
has become a hot topic in the field of animal health care.

   A woman came into Dr. John Saidla's offices
several years ago and said she just couldn't bear another look at
her toothless schnauzer's gummy grin.
   Was there anything the veterinarian could do?
   Most animal doctors would have said no, but not Saidla, a
pioneer in dental care for pets.
   ``We put in a bridge and it stayed in there for 2{ years until
he died,'' says Saidla, who has been poking around in animal mouths
for decades. ``We never had any trouble. She used to use a water
pick to clean it.''
   Dentistry has become a hot topic in the field of pet health
care, a $5 billion-a-year industry.
   And that begs a question for the '90s: Do people love their pets
enough to pay for their braces, a few root canals and crowns, or
even just some dental checkups?
   Saidla and a growing group of veterinarians at the top of the charts.
Rock has undergone a lot of
changes since then and Dion DiMucci, who was recently inducted into
the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, became a solo singer years ago.
Today he thumbs his nose at those who scoff at ``geriatric
rockers'' and keeps on playing his music his way.

   Dion is turning 50, but he's ready to rock 'n'
roll till he's in a rocking chair.
   As a teen-ager in the Bronx, Dion DiMucci put together a group
of singers and named it for the neighborhood's Belmont Avenue. Dion
and the Belmonts became the most popular vocal group of rock 'n'
roll's doo-wop era.
   At 15, he made his first professional appearance, on a Paul
Whiteman show, and he first saw, walking down the street, the
redhead who's still his wife and the mother of his three daughters.
   Five years later, Dion and the Belmonts had their first Top 10
record, ``A Teenager in Love.''
   This year, Dion, who wears a jaunty Bronx taxi driver's cap even
at home in Boca Raton, Fla., has a new rock 'n' roll album, ``Yo
Frankie,'' which is getting good reviews. He wrote most of the
songs.
   Dion, who turns 50 on July 18, was inducted into the Rock 'n'
Roll Hall of Fame in January.
   Some of his generation became tuxedoed nightclub singers.
   ``I'm a die-hard,'' Dion says. ``I've always been a rock 'n'
roll enthusiast. In case I lose my job as a rock 'n' roll singer,
I'll drive a cab. I've got my cabbie cap. But I've been fortunate.
I always paid the rent. I've never done another job. Never.''
   Dion isn't buying any ``don't trust anybody over 30'' stuff or
pronouncements by Mick Jagger and Peter Townshend of the Who about
not wanting to be geriatric rockers.
   ``When I started there was no rock 'n' roll, no expectations, no
rules,'' Dion says. ``Some people got the idea that rock 'n' roll
was just for the young. Today we know that's not so. You could be
an old fogey at 19. You can be kicking up your heels at 63. It's an
attitude.
   ``Rock at its best lifts your spirit, keeps you aware, makes you
feel and think, keeps you young.
   ``If you start with the anger and a sound to get the girls, and
keep on, you find out it's really an artistic expression. You can
share your thoughts. This is powerful.''
   Rock 'n' roll may have moved through doo-wop, British invasions
and disco to post-punk, but for Dion it hasn't changed much.
   ``The only thing that has changed is the equipment,'' he says.
``Basically, you've got a backbeat, electric guitars and it's dance
music.
   ``This new album is an '80s album. But it has elements of my
music. It's black music filtered through an Italian neighborhood.
You come out with an attitude.
   ``I always used a bunch of guys to imitate a horn section,
because I couldn't afford a horn section. I became kind of
identified with that sound _ `Ruby Baby,' `Runaround Sue.' I use it
all through this album.
   ``When I was growing up we used to bang on cardboard boxes and I
had a guitar and a bunch of guys would sing. You put a drum to that
and you go. With all the technology today it comes out with more
power and clarity.''
   After doo-wop faded and Dion conquered a drug problem, he became
a folk singer. He had a hit with ``Abraham, Martin and John.''
   ``I wasn't striking lightning in the sky,'' he says. ``That song
gave me a chance to sit in coffeehouses which were flourishing
around the country and play acoustic guitar and express myself.
   ``Those times were wonderful for me. For the first time it
became a two-way street, the audience and me. When I started out,
we used to run out at the Brooklyn Fox and do two songs. Then Fats
Domino would do two songs. Jerry Lee Lewis would do two.
   ``In 1980 I got into gospel music. It was a way to express what
was inside me. I made five gospel albums. I don't call it religious
music. I don't look at myself as religious.''
   Dion, a solo singer since 1960, had a reunion concert with the
Belmonts in 1972 but has stayed off rock revival tours. ``I feel
like I would dry up if I did that.
   ``But I love doing the old songs. Those songs become more
valuable to me every year. I love to see the joy `The Wanderer' and
`Runaround Sue' bring to people. When Arista Records wanted me to
do an album, I said I'd do it if I can do a rock 'n' roll album in
the tradition of those two songs, meaning get into some strong
characters.''
   Dion says he got a lot of help on his new album. Paul Simon
sings on ``Written on the Subway Wall'' and he's in the video. ``We
did it on a subway platform in the middle of the night,'' Dion
says. ``We had about 15 cops, 20 Guardian Angels. It was great. We
had dinner served down there.
   ``I had Paul sing one of my favorite doo-wop songs, `Little
Star,' done by the Elegants, in the middle of `Subway Wall.'
   ``One of my friends had a bunch of 8mm film of us from the old
days. It's woven through the whole video. The end shows me in my
first car, which I bought for $75.''
   Personally, Dion says, ``I'm kind of an oddball. I've got the
same wife I started off with. We grew up together. We love each
other. The real thing that kept us going is that we accepted each
other at our worst. We walked through the valley. I was with her at
her lowest and she was with me at my lowest.
   ``We've got three great daughters. They're a joy. I'm blessed.''
   Dion is looking forward to his 50th birthday party.
   ``It's going to be a bash,'' he says. ``There'll be a lot of
friends with instruments. I probably will get into the mood to
play.''

   Scott Bakula, in his role as
time-traveling Sam Beckett in NBC's ``Quantum Leap,'' never knows
who he will be from week to week.
   Beckett, in fact, seldom knows who he is, or what he looks like,
until he catches sight of himself in a mirror. Beckett, you see, is
a scientist tap-dancing his way through time as the result of a
time-travel experiment that went haywire.
   Whenever he leaps in time he becomes a different person. The
audience sees him as Beckett, but to people in the story he appears
as the other person. He must stay there, as that person, until he
solves a problem and leaps again in time.
   He has been a teen-age hot rodder, a black man, a professor, a
test pilot and assorted other identities. Next season he's a woman
and a ghost-busting parapsychologist.
   He's occasionally joined by his mentor, Albert, played by Dean
Stockwell. Albert, however, appears as a holographic projection
visible only to Beckett and to the audience.
   ``In one show I was a gangster hit man,'' he says. ``I popped in
with my pants around my ankles and a woman saying, `Frankie, you
were terrific.' Dean popped up a minute later.
   ``It's great for me as an actor. Every show is so totally
different. Although we only travel within the lifetime of my
character, which is from 1953 to the present, we can do some period
stories with old cars and props. The hairdressers a couple of weeks
ago had to do 50 beehive hairdos every day.
   ``It's a fun show to do. It has elements of `Peggy Sue Got
Married' and `Back To the Future.' The twist is I get to be in
somebody else's shoes.''
   Bakula, which rhymes with Dracula, is in Pasadena for an episode
set in a haunted mansion. The huge stone house, lined inside with
marble and filled with statuary, sits atop a hill across the Arroyo
Seco from downtown Pasadena.
   Donald Bellisario, executive producer and creator of ``Quantum
Leap,'' and his wife, Deborah Pratt, the producer, are among those
in the show. Bellisario is his mirror image and Pratt is a woman
who hires the parapsychologist because she believes her late
husband's spirit is in the house.
   ``Ideally, my own character of Sam Beckett shines through each
new character every week,'' says Bakula. ``Don Bellisario has
written Sam as a warm human being with a passion for his fellow
man. Hopefully, that'll come through so I'll get involved with
people.
   ``I come into a situation, I don't know what's going on, then
have to get acquainted and solve the problem. It's whimsical, yet
has an element of sadness. Sam is lost in time. His life seems to
be ended. He lives his life as other people.''
   Bakula says the offer to do the series came ``out of the blue.''
He'd just returned from New York where he had appeared in the
musical ``Romance, Romance.''
   ``I got the script on a Wednesday and by Friday we had a deal,''
he says. ``It was such a good script. I didn't know Don Bellisario
because somehow I'd totally missed `Magnum, P.I.,' which was his
show. So it was a surprise to get a script that good.''
   ``Quantum Leap,'' which NBC has renewed for next season, is
Bakula's third TV series. He smiles and says, ``Knock on wood. The
third time's a charm. It's awfully nice to be picked up. It's
disappointing when a show fails. But both were great experiences
for me.''
   His first was ABC's ``Gung Ho'' in 1986-87, based on the hit
movie about the cultural clash when a Japanese car company opens a
factory in Pennsylvania. He played the intermediary between the
Japanese bosses and the American workers.
   Next in 1988 was CBS' ``Eisenhower &amp; Lutz,'' a comedy created by
Alan Burns, co-creator with Jim Brooks of ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Show.'' He played Buddy Lutz, a slightly shady lawyer who adds the
name of Eisenhower to his struggling, one-man law office in an
attempt to add some class.
   His first television appearance in many years was in the pilot
episode of CBS' ``Designing Women'' as Annie Potts' former husband.
   ``I had been working in New York doing mostly theater work,'' he
says. ``The last television I'd done was `On Our Own' in 1977.
Dixie Carter was in that and she's also in `Designing Women.' I
told her I only work in shows she's in.''
   After his move here in January 1986, Bakula also worked on ``My
Sister Sam'' and ``Matlock'' and was in a television movie with
John Ritter. He starred in a Disney TV movie pilot called
``I-Man.'' He played a man who breathed radiated gas and became
indestructible.
   ``I did a few soap opera things when I was in New York,'' he
says, ``but mostly I worked in the theater.''
   Bakula met his wife, Krista, while on tour in Connecticut. They
were both appearing in ``The Baker's Wife.'' They now have a
5-year-old daughter and she has ``taken a leave of absence from
acting.''

   Robert LuPone uses his off-and-on employment in
``A Chorus Line'' to help finance his real dream _ a small theater
troupe called the Manhattan Class Company.
   ``It's my passion,'' says LuPone, describing his non-profit
company which is located in a ramshackle building on 42nd Street's
Theater Row. ``The whole thing was born out of volunteer labor and
still is.''
   Supporting this dream is why LuPone returns periodically to ``A
Chorus Line,'' Broadway's longest running musical. He was the
original Zach, the enigmatic director in the show when it opened on
Broadway 14 years ago.
   ``I don't even play a full week in `A Chorus Line' because half
the time I'm doing something here,'' he says, referring to the
Manhattan Class Company. ``But I evidently bring something of value
to the show because they accept me on those terms.''
   LuPone started Manhattan Class in 1983 with Bernard Telsey, a
one-time actor. The company grew out of an acting class that
LuPone, a veteran member of such groups as Actors Studio and Circle
Repertory, was teaching. Telsey, who had been been a theater
administration major, was one of his students at New York
University.
   ``I never found the ensemble that I was looking for, so I formed
my own,'' says the 42-year-old LuPone.
   ``But I didn't want to form another acting company,'' he
recalls. ``So Bernie and I decided to develop new plays to sell to
producers. It would be a for-profit company and we would present
staged readings of new American plays.''
   Its guiding principle would be that playwrights would have the
time here to develop an idea in workshop using professional actors
and directors. Their first reading six years ago was optioned for
Broadway the next day.
   ``We thought we were really hot stuff,'' LuPone recalls. ``But
we learned. Two and a half years later, the play still wasn't
produced.''
   That first season, Manhattan Class did four readings each of
three plays-in-progress for would-be producers, a process that
continued until 1986.
   ``The adventure of collaboration turns me on _ the director, the
actor and the playwright working together,'' LuPone says. ``When
you have a play that's already written, half of the challenge is
gone.''
   To survive, Manhattan Class switched in 1986 to non-profit
status and became more of a mainstream theater when it began to
give seasonal one-act productions at its tiny space on Theater Row.
The following year, one of their one-act efforts, ``Beirut,'' a
futuristic AIDS play by Alan Bowne, was done commercially
off-Broadway.
   ``The reason that a year could pass between festivals is that we
don't have the money or we are out working,'' the actor says.
``This is everybody's second job.''
   LuPone, big brother to Broadway actress Patti LuPone, has been
in show business for nearly 30 years. The Long Island native
started as a dancer at 15. After graduating from Juilliard, he
moved on to theater roles, working in some Broadway shows that were
hits like ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``The Magic Show'' and
others that never made it to New York like ``Nefertiti.''
   But it's ``A Chorus Line'' that has been LuPone's annuity over
the years.
   He was a dancer in director Michael Bennett's original workshop
productions in 1975 and when the role of the director, modeled
after Bennett himself, was created, LuPone knew he could do it.
   Since then, he has had almost a love-hate relationship with the
part of Zach.
   ``It's just a facility for the dancers to talk to,'' says
LuPone, explaining that the show is built around a series of
auditions by dancers for a director who almost never is seen on
stage.
   ``Plus I have diametrically opposed experiences in `A Chorus
Line,''' he recalls. ``I did it 14 years ago when there were yells
and screams and standing ovations. We were the darling of the town.
Now you get Japanese tourists who don't understand what's going on;
it's not a full house, and there are no yells.''
   If a job interests him or the money is good, LuPone will tear
himself away from the Manhattan Class Company. In 1987, he starred
on Broadway in the infamous ``Late Nite Comic,'' a four-performance
musical flop. Last fall, he traveled to the Cleveland Play House
for a chance to appear in Budd Schulberg's stage adaptation of ``On
the Waterfront.''
   Running a company has mellowed LuPone's own intense career
desires that dominated his early acting days.
   ``I was intense because I was so hungry,'' he says. ``When you
have your own theater company, my approval and acceptance doesn't
come from acting anymore or whether people like me. It comes from
something of content, hopefully. That's the difference in me now
vs. me 10 years ago.''
   LuPone and Telsey are now planning the company's 1989-90 season.
If things go according to schedule and the duo can raise the funds,
they will do full-length new American plays in the fall and spring
with a one-act festival held in the winter. Their budget is an
estimated $250,000, most raised from corporate and foundation
grants.
   ``You start with the hope of what the theater can and should
be,'' LuPone says. ``That's why I get people to work here for
little or no money. That's what we sell, not necessarily a superior
product. What we do sell is a community of committed artists.''

<HEAD>Whites and Blacks Get Together More Frequently in South Africa</HEAD>

   A steady erosion of apartheid
laws allows people of different races to use the same public
restrooms, libraries and elevators, stand in the same line at the
post offices, eat at the same restaurants, dance and drink together.
   South African whites and blacks also can sit next to each other
at theaters, picnic at the same parks and, in some instances, share
trains, buses and beaches. They worship together at some churches,
compete together on some soccer teams and running clubs. They can
have an interracial love affair or marriage without fear of arrest.
   But in many other ways, they remain divided by ignorance and
fear that has developed over decades of forced separation.
   ``The average South African wouldn't know how to mix across
different groups. He wouldn't know what to say after he said,
`Hello','' said Bernard Chalmers, a white management consultant who
conducts cross-cultural encounter groups for businesses, schools
and churches.
   The phenomenon has been described as an invisible Berlin Wall
that keeps blacks and whites from understanding and communicating
with each other even though many of them now interact in ways that
once were prohibited.
   Such encounters have become a fad as more people are working and
living next to someone whose culture they don't understand.
   ``Blacks find out whites are not really as rich as they think,
and whites find out things like the black guy loves his children,''
said Chalmers. ``It's really at that level of finding the other
human being is there.''
   The Rev. Nico Smith, a white minister who was shunned by family
and friends when he moved into the black township of Mamelodi,
outside Pretoria, belongs to a nationwide religious organization
that brings blacks and whites together for meals, home visits and
church services.
   ``Apartheid has been very successful,'' Smith said. ``White
people tell me, `We discovered black people are ordinary people
like we are.' Just that one expression is an indication of the
total alienation that developed over the years.''
   The chasm is so wide that black professionals often say they
feel insulted and patronized, usually by well-meaning white
colleagues who think they are reaching across the cultural divide.
   ``More dangerous than apartheid are the pseudo-liberals who are
really saying if you do things like me and come to be like me and
take on my culture, I will accept you,'' said Gabriel Setiloane, a
black professor of religion at the mostly white University of Cape
Town. ``All my life I have been among these people who are
insulting me every day because they can only accept me when I speak
their language and do things they want to be done.
   ``I tell them at the university ... how much of the African
understanding of the being of life, of values, are coming into your
curriculum, your articles, your relationships? Otherwise it means
you have black students at the university that you are making
white.''
   Pearl Ntuli, a black marketing manager for a black magazine,
Africa Now, said, ``I do make friends with white people, especially
now that people are trying hard to reach out. But some people end
up being too patronizing. We (blacks) are also very suspicious of
them. We think they they don't really mean it. But eventually you
learn to recognize the good people.''
   More businesses are recognizing they must rely on the growing
black labor force to fill supervisory, professional and technical
positions, and that the black majority population is their primary
market.
   Daniel Pholo, the black manager of social programs for Makro
wholesale stores, said his company has a program to promote black
managers and a multiracial employee soccer team. He instructs white
supervisors about black employees' different needs, such as more
time for lengthy mourning rituals after the death of a loved one.
   But black and white Makro employees seldom visit each other on
weekends, he said, because few blacks have transport to white
suburbs, and ``whites are scared to go into black townships.''
   The government has moved from a policy of forcing apartheid on
everyone to proposing the creation of integated residential areas
for those who prefer them. However, it is committed to maintaining
separate voter rolls and providing segregated neighborhoods, public
schools and hospitals for whites who want them.
   Apartheid laws still deny the black majority of 28 million the
right to vote on national affairs, assign them to underfunded
schools with unqualified teachers, and force most of them to live
in impoverished rural homelands or underdeveloped, overcrowded
urban townships. Blacks are tried by white judges for breaking laws
passed by white legislators. All municipal governments have power
to prohibit blacks from using any public facility.
   Blacks and whites get to know each other most easily as
next-door neighbors, said John Kane-Berman, head of the independent
South African Institute of Race Relations. He said an estimated
100,000 to 200,000 black people live illegally in white
neighborhoods, engaged in ``grassroots civil disobedience on a mass
scale.''
   The government seldom enforces the residential segregation law.
In most of the mixed areas, Kane-Berman said, whites are either
apathetic or enthusiastic about their black, Indian or mixed-race
neighbors.
   ``There have been a couple of ugly incidents,'' he added, ``but
because the opposition has in fact been pretty small, the
government has been able to turn a blind eye to it.
   ``Social contact across the color line is the rule now, rather
than the exception,'' Kane-Berman said. ``In the process of
economic integration, people are just discovering that when you
actually meet people (of another race) they are not as terrible as
you were brainwashed into believing.''

<TEXT>
   Far fewer generations will see the world's
ancient monuments than have seen them already. Fewer still will see
them if nations don't decide soon which to save and which to let
die.
   Changing temperatures and humidities, indoor and outdoor air
pollution, artificial light, traffic, bacteria and other ills are
causing monuments and antiquities everywhere to fall apart.
   ``The decisions are going to be difficult, but if governments
and officials don't act, there'll be very little left,'' said Luis
Monreal, an international conservation specialist.
   ``The next decade is crucial. We have the technology. Where's
the courage?''
   What concerns Monreal is a tendency of governments to ignore the
warnings of archaeologists and conservationists, who are spokesmen
for the monuments and not for powerful political lobbies. The
problem becomes especially acute in countries rich in artifacts but
poor in finances, when antiquities officials try to take stands to
save artifacts only to be overruled by politicians more interested
in tourist dollars than in the monuments' survival.
   ``But we must decide which monuments can and should be saved,''
Monreal said. ``Whatever we do, even if it's the right thing, man
is going to lose 60 to 80 percent of his cultural heritage in the
centuries ahead.''
   Monreal heads the Getty Conservation Institute of Marina del
Rey, Calif., the only private institution that researches ways to
carry out cultural conservation and puts up the money to do it.
   Bits and pieces of the past, from miniscule to gargantuan, from
the Americas to China, are specimens for Getty's experts: Tombs.
Mummies. Paintings. Adobe. Old photographs. Oriental lacquerware.
Tapestries. Primitive rock drawings. English silver.
   How to save them?
   Getty money and expertise are cooperating with local officials
in four major projects:
   _Restoration and conservation of decaying wall paintings in the
3,500-year-old tomb of Queen Nefertari, favorite wife of Pharaoh
Ramses II, across the Nile River from Luxor in southern Egypt.
   _A pilot project to conserve Roman-era floor mosaics at Paplos
on Cyprus in the Mediterranean.
   _Preservation of two major Buddhist sites in China: rock temples
dating as early as A.D. 366 in the Mogao grottoes at the edge of
the Gobi Desert and the Yungang grottoes, 200 miles west of Beijing.
   _A preservation showcase for organic materials, including 27
royal mummies in Cairo's Egyptian Museum and the Dead Sea Scrolls
in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
   Monreal, who recently was in Cairo to discuss Egypt's crumbling
past with officials, said technology must be matched with specific
needs.
   ``It's hard, but officials are going to have to decide which
monuments live and which die.''
   Monreal cites two examples: Spain's medieval castles and the
4,500-year-old Sphinx near Cairo.
   Spain, which is Monreal's home country, wants to preserve its
heritage but has so many troubled monuments it can't save them all.
   ``There are 2,000 medieval castles built during 700 years of
warfare,'' Monreal said. ``Even if the entire (Spanish) defense
budget were turned over to save the castles, it wouldn't be
enough.''
   The problem is different with the Sphinx, a stone lion with a
pharaoh's face unique for its size. Monreal said there's no doubt
it should be saved.
   ``But the Sphinx is terminal. It's dying. What do you do for any
terminal patient? You put him in intensive care, on a life support
system.''
   He suggests covering the monument while scientists debate what
to do, but Egyptian officials are uneasy about isolating one of the
country's top tourist attractions.
   ``You can cover it and still allow people to see it as
scientists decide what's the matter. Up to three years of study lie
ahead. But once they know, officials will have to make a decision.
   ``And that decision might not be popular.''
   Monreal said getting the money for such work is the ``easiest
part if it's a good project. Saving the Sphinx would be a gold mine
for public relations. Companies would fall all over themselves to
save the Sphinx.''
   But too often, he added, ``wasting money, a lot of money''
results from wrong-headed priorities.
   ``Some monuments will be saved that really don't matter, and
some that should be saved, won't be,'' he said. ``What are you
going to choose: To save 30 percent of your monuments for 100 years
or 10 percent for 1,000?
   ``It's superficial to spread the batter too thin. ... In some
cases projects are taken on by corporations not because the relic
is worthy of being saved but because it's the pet of the chairman
of the board.
   ``We see this in Italy, and in the United States the situation
is terrible.''
   On the other hand is Mexico, a country with many fragile
monuments, which Monreal said is doing the best job of saving the
artifacts that should be saved despite its economic problems.
   ``Years ago those who wanted to preserve the past were given the
political power to make decisions,'' he said. ``Today Mexico's past
is doing well.''
   Monreal, 46, has spent his adult life in museums, seeking ways
to preserve treasures. Co-workers call his life with monuments a
passion, and he admits it's a utopian dream.
   ``I'm perishable; they're perishable. But I'm trying to keep
what's standing, standing,'' he said.
   ``Even in 1,000 years some monuments will be standing because
they were so well-built, but when it's finished, it's finished. You
can't change history, but maybe you can prolong a monument's life.''

   John Keating is the kind of teacher of which every student
dreamed but rarely encountered. He tickles the ribs, he fires the
mind, he preaches nonconformity. He even instructs his pupils to
rip out the innocuous introduction from a book of poetry.
Obviously, John Keating isn't going to last at a rock-ribbed New
England prep school in the 1960s.
   Robin Williams portrays John Keating in ``Dead Poets Society''
with only a trace of Adrian Cronauer of ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''
While trying to rouse his bored students, he demonstrates how
Shakespeare could be done by Marlon Brando and John Wayne.
Otherwise, he plays it straight-arrow, and he is wonderful.
   ``Dead Poets Society'' itself is wonderful, like a cool oasis
amid the arid summer of sequels. It is that rare comedy-drama that
stimulates the mind as well as the emotions.
   The title may be a turnoff for some folks, but it shouldn't be.
When Keating was a student at the school, he and other freethinkers
formed the society to read poetry and plot against the faculty.
Unbeknownst to him, his own students revive the custom in an
obvious collision course with the authorities.
   The film focuses more on the boys than on their teacher, and
they are portrayed with true insight. The central figure is Neil
Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), who yearns to be an actor despite his
father's stern opposition. Neil's roommate is Todd Anderson (Ethan
Hawke) who is so withdrawn he can't speak up in class.
   With their teacher's inspiration, Neil decides to defy his
father, and Todd comes out of his shell. There is a terrific scene
in which Williams forces Todd to recite a poem he had written. The
other boys in the cast are equally well drawn; they talk and behave
as you would expect rich boys of the period to.
   Australian Peter Weir, who captured the American scene in
``Witness,'' does it again in ``Dead Poets Society.'' His direction
of the young actors is brilliant, and he keeps Williams on a tight
rein. Tom Schulman's script is literate and clever, veering to the
ultimate tragedy. The ending may jar some viewers unless they note
the portents along the way.
   Robin Williams should be applauded not only for his performance
but for taking a role that is not a star turn in a film that may
have to hunt for an audience. A major factor in the film is John
Seale's gorgeous photography of the New England scene (actually
Delaware)
   A Touchstone Picture produced by Steven Haft, Paul Junger Witt
and Tony Thomas, ``Dead Poet's Society'' is the biggest movie treat
of the year so far. Rated PG for language and intensity. Running
time: 126 minutes.

   ``A Cry in the Dark'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95.
Rated PG-13)
   
   Another movie with Meryl Streep showing off a foreign accent.
That was the joke last fall when the prodigious actress starred in
``A Cry in the Dark'' as an Australian mother wrongfully accused of
murdering her infant daughter.
   But this grim tale, based on a true story, is a lot more than a
vehicle for Streep to astonish with her facility for the cadences
of an exotic dialect. It's a gripping account of how press, police
and prosecutors unwittingly conspired to send an innocent woman to
jail for several years.
   Streep plays Lindy Chamberlain, wife of a Seventh-day Adventist
minister and mother of three young children, who goes on a camping
trip with her family to mammoth Ayers Rock. One night a dingo, a
wild dog of the outback, steals into the tent where 9-week-old
Azaria is sleeping, kills the baby and runs off with her into the
wilderness.
   The film leaves no doubt this is what happened, and at first
witnesses, police and the media seem sympathetic to the family's
tragedy. But as time goes by and no body is found _ only some
bloodstained clothes _ gossip and speculation begin to arise in the
tabloid press and on television talk shows that Mrs. Chamberlain
may have killed the child herself.
   Various forensic ``experts'' add credence to this theory from
studying the blood and rips on the baby's garments, and soon Mrs.
Chamberlain is on trial for murder and her husband as an accessory.
Both are convicted, and she is sentenced to life imprisonment at
hard labor, while pregnant with her fourth child.
   Streep's performance is impressive, especially her refusal to
soften the mother's aloof, at times hard-bitten personality, which
prevents the jury from sympathizing with her. Sam Neill does well
in the less-interesting role of her husband, who suffers a crisis
of faith and even turns on his wife when the pressure becomes too
much for him.
   Director Fred Schepisi maintains a claustrophobic atmosphere
that keeps our attention riveted on the seemingly unbelievable
nightmare into which the Chamberlains are dragged. He and Robert
Caswell adapted their screenplay from John Bryson's book ``Evil
Angels.''
   The moviemakers' timing was better than they could have
anticipated. Last September, just as the film was about to be
released, Mrs. Chamberlain was formally cleared of all charges.
   Not a movie for a casual night's light entertainment, but a
strong, provocative piece of work that documents with chilling
realism one of the more amazing criminal justice stories of our
time.

   ``Midnight Cop'' (Vidmark. VHS, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   ``Midnight Cop'' is not a bad little mystery, with its blend of
blackmail, murder and mayhem in the German underworld. And to add a
little spice, a little pornography and incest are thrown in.
   The movie clearly deserves its R rating, with a good bit of
nudity, sexual situations and bloody violence. But star Morgan
Fairchild doesn't shed very much beyond her undies.
   One could ask what she's doing in this movie, which also stars
Michael York and Frank Stallone. They just don't fit in with the
teutonic tone of the flick. And the movie is actually carried by
German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl, who plays a burned-out, woman
chasing, hard drinking detective named Alex Conrad. He's the type
usually found in the LAPD or NYPD, rather than with the stiff
discipline styled Prussian cops.
   The movie also has a continuity problem with some characters
speaking English while others speak German. There's also a bit of
dubbing. These incongruities tend to throw off the pace of the
story, an exploration of the classic outlaw side of society.
   While investigating the death of a young dancer, Alex hooks up
with Lisa (Fairchild), and battles a vicious drug dealer
(Stallone). York plays a district attorney who is obviously not
quite what he seems to be.
   The video also has some truly comic moments, mostly involving
Mueller-Stahl.

   ``Rocket Gibralter'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98.
Rated PG)
   
   No one is more fun to watch than Burt Lancaster as an eccentric.
That gentle face is so forgiveable, though his antics in ``Rocket
Gibralter'' _ as in ``Atlantic City'' and ``Local Hero'' _ can
annoy those around him.
   And Lancaster does not disappoint as Levi Rockwell in Daniel
Petrie's endearing tale of a man who knows he is soon to die.
Rockwell is about to turn 77 and his four children and eight
grandchildren have gathered to celebrate at his gracious spread on
New York's Long Island.
   The family is close and caring, although perhaps a little too
pretty, well-off and hip to engender complete sympathy. Their
problems are sometimes hard to relate to, such as a son-in-law who
is a professional pitcher having trouble with his curve ball.
   Rockwell, a widower who says he has come to live 90 percent in
the past, seems to communicate best with his young grandchildren,
who accept his ideas about the proper way to die without the
emotional turmoil the adults display. And it is the grandchildren's
acceptance of Rockwell's wish for a Viking funeral that makes for a
sweet and moving conclusion to the 1988 film.
   Well-acted and well-written, ``Rocket Gibralter'' would make a
good introduction to a discussion with older children about death.
It also has a lovely soundtrack of original Billie Holiday songs.

   ``Love Season'' (Orpheus) _ Alex Bugnon
   
   The first cut on ``Love Season,'' keyboardist Alex Bugnon's
debut album, is fantastic _ a playful, strutting number that jumps
out from the speakers with a shout of joy.
   That the rest of the album fails to live up to ``Going Out,'' is
less the fault of the material than the high standard set by the
lead song. The seven other songs on ``Love Season'' are pretty
good, too.
   ``Going Out'' should be required listening for anyone who thinks
_ maybe with good reason _ that most jazz fusion music is too
sterile and mechanical, music for admiring rather than enjoying.
   Bugnon brings a lot of humanity and feeling to his music, and
avoids allowing his varied influences (his background includes
classical, jazz, gospel and rock) to meld into faceless mush. As
they say, this guy's got personality.
   The album shifts effortlessly from elegant to all-out jams, with
high points including a sharp version of the Brenda Russell hit,
``Piano in the Dark,'' the funky ``Falling for You'' and ``Magie
Noire,'' a percussion and synthesizer party.

   ``Conviction'' (Blue Wave) _ Hamell on Trial
   
   Ed Hamell has a chip on his shoulder and a gift for melody, two
things that ought to add up to great rock 'n' roll. What he lacks,
and what sinks his group Hamell on Trial's debut album, is a sense
of humor.
   With a tight four-piece band led by Hamell's brilliant acoustic
guitar playing, ``Conviction'' attacks such things as liars, drugs
and MTV and muses on the pain of love at 100 words per minute. The
album also sets what must be some sort of record by having two
songs containing references to boxer Mike Tyson.
   But after opening with the bright pop of ``Looking for You,''
Hamell on Trial overdoes it with the heaviness. And it's not just
the lyrics. The performances, which include talking blues and
straight-out rock with folk overtones, have a veins-in-the-neck
intensity.
   Listen to some of the great angry artists of rock _ Lennon,
Dylan, Costello, for example _ and you'll get the seriousness
balanced with some humor and compassion. That mix is part of what
made the songs work, but it's an approach that has not been grasped
here.
   Even when Hamell's pledging his love, things get a bit
overwrought. In ``When You're Alone,'' he sings: ``If I were
Michael Tyson standing in the ring, knowing that I needn't fear
another living thing, I'd be standing there, shiny, black and
proud, I'd see you in the audience, I'd lift you from the crowd, if
you needed it, some night when you're alone.''
   Lighten up, Ed.
   The power displayed on ``Conviction'' indicates Hammell on Trial
has what it takes to make a good record. We'll have to tune in next
time to see if they actually do it.

   Remember William Hurt's sister in ``The
Accidental Tourist,'' the one who marries his boss?
   Or Amy Irving's friend in ``Crossing Delancey,'' the one who has
the baby?
   What about Holly Hunter's fellow beauty contestant in ``Miss
Firecracker,'' the one whose piano recital is ruined by Tim Robbins?
   Picture an actress with big brown eyes, strawberry blond hair,
and a wide smile, specializing in offbeat characters. She has
appeared in John Huston's ``Wise Blood'' and Woody Allen's
``Stardust Memories,'' as well as ``Breaking Away,'' ``The Deer
Hunter'' and ``The Amityville Horror.''
   Her name is Amy Wright and her experiences on film sets are not
of 18-hour days or endless retakes, but of finding ways to fill
free time.
   She can relate well to the character in the long-running
off-Broadway play, ``The Fantasticks'' who pronounces, ``There are
no small actors, only small parts.''
   ``On `Accidental Tourist,' we had two weeks of rehearsal and
that was wonderful,'' the actress recalled. ``Then we started
shooting and I just sat around. I wasn't needed except here and
there, that's the way it goes.
   ``I wanted to be at work; I didn't want to be sitting in a hotel
reading. I got a lot of reading done, but I thought, `What am I
doing? My life is passing me by and I'm just sitting here.' At
least in a play, you're busy all the time.''
   For ``Crossing Delancey,'' she had to make due with a limited
role.
   ``I didn't do a whole biography of where she was born and how
she got to that point in her life,'' Wright said of her character.
``You have a little baby in your arms, you go to a bris, you have
your friends. You can just imagine all that, some things you can
just easily identify with.''
   But Wright's career is picking up. Critics praised her
performance in ``The Accidental Tourist,'' and the actress could
gain wider recognition this fall when she appears opposite Jeff
Daniels in ``Love Hurts.''
   ``I think that more people know who I am,'' Wright said of her
recent string of hit films. ``Now they can connect the name and the
face. I have a good reputation.''
   Her decision to become an actress was a bit of an accident
itself. Wright, a native of Chicago, grew up in a house without a
TV set and had little interest in film or stage. But as a senior in
high school, she became ``inspired.''
   ``I had a mad crush on this fellow at the University of Chicago.
He was an actor, an undergraduate student. He had a friend who was
making 16 mm movies, and I used to hang around.
   ``We went to this acting workshop and the teacher told me I was
really good. She said, `Why don't you try out for plays at your
school or come here and try out.'''
   The crush eventually faded, but she caught the acting bug and
appeared in several high school plays. After majoring in theater
arts at Beloit College, Wright moved to Stockbridge, Mass., and
taught high school.
   ``It served its purpose,'' she said. ``It was a step into the
real world; it was halfway there. I was always able to do summer
stock and get a pretty good workout. Then I went to Rockville,
Ill., where a friend of mine had started The New American Theatre,
which is still going strong.''
   Wright moved to New York in 1974 and appeared on Broadway in
Lanford Wilson's ``5th of July.'' She also became friends with
director Martha Coolidge and made her film debut in Coolidge's
documentary feature, ``Not a Pretty Picture.''
   Parts in ``Girlfriends,'' ``Breaking Away'' and ``The Deer
Hunter'' quickly followed. In 1980, she had a featured role in
``Wise Blood,'' playing the sly Sabbath Lily Hawks in Huston's
adaptation of the Flannery O'Connor story. Wright considers the
film her favorite and enjoyed working with the director.
   ``It was very nice,'' she said. ``We'd start about 8 in the
morning and finish about 4 or 5 in the afternoon. If you got him
telling stories, that was the best. He believed that if you cast
the right person, 90 percent of his job was done as far as the
performance was concerned. He didn't like to tell actors what to
do.''
   But ``Wise Blood'' was a box-office failure and for the next
five years, Wright worked exclusively in theater.
   ``There have been some hard times when I was wondering what
should I do instead with my life. Something more fulfilling than
waiting around for the phone to ring.''
   She appeared on Broadway in Michael Frayn's ``Noises Off,'' and
made a valuable contact with Joan Micklin Silver, who directed
``Crossing Delancey.''
   ``It gave me a boost to get that job,'' Wright said. ``It'd been
a long time; it gave me confidence. Then reading for (director)
Larry Kasden and `Accidental Tourist,' I thought, `Oh, this is
great.'''
   She has finally dropped the dreaded status of ``between parts.''
   ``Things are better,'' said Wright. ``You have to make the
poeple think you're really sought after or they think, `Well, she's
not getting offers so I'm not going to offer anything either.'''

<HEAD>The Artists: A Return to Traditionalist Painting</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Dunlay's struggle to learn the traditional
techniques of painting led him to despair 17 years ago, and
thoughts of a career change. After all, no one was interested in
classical realism, teachers were scarce and collectors even fewer.
   But he stuck with traditional painting, training in the style of
the once popular Boston school. And as cultural tastes turn from
the unrestrained moods of modernism to the craftsmanship of the
traditional arts, Dunlay and other Boston school painters now are
thriving.
   The tall, husky 37-year-old artist's earnings have reached six
figures in recent years, and Dunlay's paintings are selling faster
than he can paint them.
   Last year his ``Winter Snowfall,'' a familiar scene of Boston's
Public Garden at dusk, sold for $100,000. Now Dunlay has been
commissioned by a former State Department official to paint the
White House Rose Garden.
   ``Traditional painting has come back very, very strong. It is
here to stay,'' Dunlay said. ``There is only one major problem:
that is that so much of the craft and the language has been lost.
Except for a handful of people in the world, it may be lost
forever.''
   The Boston school, considered to be the longest continuing style
of traditional painting that survives today, brings together the
sharp images of American realism with the bright colors of
impressionism. About 40 painters around the nation and in Europe
consider themselves Boston school painters, disciples of a
tradition that developed here in the 19th century.
   The aims and values of the Boston school are evident in ``Winter
Snowfall,'' a view of pedestrians in winter garb traversing the
bridge over the Public Garden's duck pond as the bridge's lights
bob against shadowy images of distant office buildings.
   The often-reproduced painting hung for about a year in the
exclusive St. Botolph club before communications mogul David Mugar
paid $100,000 for it last year. Dunlay said he receives calls every
day from people wishing to purchase it.
   ``It became a kind of popular icon through these Christmas cards
and reproductions and prints that were sold,'' said William Coles,
a noted Boston art historian.
   At the outset of World War I, several major Boston school
painters established the Guild of Boston Artists. The cooperative
gallery proved to be one of the most successful in the city and is
still operating.
   Boston was a natural source of strong traditional painting,
according to Coles. John Singer Sargent and John Singleton Copley,
noted painters with ties to the European art community, made their
homes here.
   ``Boston was always a center for painting from the 18th century
on. Major painters like Copley and Gilbert Stewart worked here and
also worked in England so they had international connections and
expertise,'' Coles said.
   At the end of the 18th century the new values of the French
school began to influence Boston painters studying abroad, but
Coles said it was the Boston Museum of Fine Arts' establishment of
a school in 1876 that entrenched Boston painters in European
training.
   The Boston school emphasized accurate drawing, which combined
with the impressionists' use of color to produce a realism that was
more pleasing to the eye than the somber tones of other traditional
styles, such as Renaissance painting. But from the Great Depression
to World War II, traditional painting in the United States reached
its nadir and modernism, with its disregard for form and line, grew
in prominence.
   ``It had a very destructive effect because the whole traditional
curriculum of the schools began to fall apart and the focus was
really on self-expression rather than on training,'' Coles said.
   Dunlay was a victim of the art school rebellion. The traditional
training he sought was unavailable when he entered the
Massachusetts College of Art in 1969.
   ``At that point there was a real movement to suppress anything
to do with traditional painting,'' Dunlay said. ``The teachers
tried to ridicule me into leaving, quitting painting, because I
wasn't interested in `expressing myself' in terms of modern
attitudes.''
   Frustrated by repeated confrontations with his instructors,
Dunlay left the MCA and searched for a painter with whom to study.
When he had nearly given up, he discovered a key figure in the
transition from the old Boston school to today's Boston school
painters: R.H. Ives Gammell.
   Gammell set up an atelier in Boston's Fenway neighborhood when
he foresaw the potential collapse of accurate drawing and
traditional painting in the 1930s. Until his death in 1981 he had
dozens of pupils, many of whom are working today in Minneapolis,
Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and Florence, Italy, and other cities.
   As paintings began to fetch higher prices, so did the works of
the original Boston school painters _ especially since their works
can now be evaluated at a distance by collectors and historians.
Works by artists such as Edmond Tarbell that could have been
purchased for very little in the 1960s, today sell for more than $1
million.
   ``I deal with people who just love the pictures,'' Dunlay said.
``They're not buying for snob appeal, they're not buying them
because they're fashionable. They're buying them because they just
plain like them.''
   Coles attributed much of the success today's Boston painters are
enjoying to the new respectability of the old generation and a
return to traditional values in painting.
   ``I think you find now, in art schools, a movement back to
figure drawing. Forty years ago, nobody wanted that discipline,''
he said. ``And of course traditional genres like figure painting
and landscape painting are now much more popular and they appear in
galleries.''

   Rock 'n' roll has always meant the unexpected
for Tom Petty, even when he was growing up in Gainesville, Fla.
   ``Rock 'n' roll came over me like a fever that I never got rid
of,'' he recalled in a recent interview, ``consumed me like a
poison _ completely consumed me to where I can honestly say I
didn't think of anything else. It was all I could do, think or
anything.
   ``It made for a terrible home life. My family didn't understand;
my father thought I was mental. I understand why because I was very
obsessed with it. It was an alternative to working. I had no
opportunity for anything in my life, with where I lived and what I
was up against.''
   He was a non-musical child who discovered a knack for guitar. A
quiet, skinny kid who never dreamed of being famous. Petty was soon
playing in local bands.
   ``You'd go and see some other kid whose hair was long, this was
around '65, and go, `Wow, there's one like me!' You'd go over and
talk and he'd say, `I've got a drum set.' `You do! Great!' That was
my whole life. Still is, I'm afraid.''
   The Traveling Wilburys was a surprise, the result of a jam
session with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, the late Roy Orbison and
Bob Dylan that grew into a best-selling album. Petty's new record,
``Full Moon Fever,'' was an accident as well.
   Late in 1987, he pulled up to a traffic light in Los Angeles and
in the next car spotted Lynne, who had just produced Harrison's
``Cloud Nine'' LP.
   ``Jeff and George both started to come to my house a lot and
we'd just sit around and play,'' Petty said. ``One day, I was
showing Jeff this song I'd written and he suggested some changes.
It was really good input. We wrote another one and thought we'd put
it on tape while he was in town.''
   They headed over to the house of Mike Campbell, a guitarist in
Petty's band, The Heartbreakers, and went to work.
   ``We did the first couple and thought it was pretty good, that
maybe we should keep on working. `C'mon Jeff, do one more, now just
one more . . . '''
   ``Full Moon Fever'' is Petty's ninth album, and first without
The Heartbreakers, although Campbell and keyboardist Belmont Tench
contributed. Lynne helped produce the record and co-wrote eight of
the 12 songs.
   ``Jeff's brilliant,'' said Petty, who will tour with The
Heartbreakers this summer. ``He's certainly (one of) the top two or
three people I've ever seen in the studio. He's growing as an
artist by leaps and bounds _ much better than a lot of the people
that we hold up as great rock heroes.''
   Petty makes no secret of his love for The Byrds; his vocals and
12-string Rickenbacker guitar have made some of his songs, notably
``American Girl,'' sound almost uncannily like the 1960s folk-rock
group.
   On ``Full Moon Fever,'' he does a note-for-note cover of The
Byrds' ``Feel a Whole Lot Better.'' The song was recorded,
naturally, on a spur-of-the-moment decision.
   ``We were in the studio and had seen (former Byrd Roger) McGuinn
play the song. We started playing it, and said, `Let's cut it.' I
thought, `Well, it's my solo album, I'll put it on, I don't care.
   ``I couldn't think of how else to do it,'' he laughed. ``I've
stolen so much from them already.''
   Petty has had his share of unpleasant surprises. When MCA bought
out his first label, Shelter, in 1978, he angrily filed suit for
artistic control and eventually settled out of court after a
lengthy battle. In 1981, he fought to lower the list price on his
``Hard Promises'' album, forcing MCA to release the record at $8.98
instead of $9.98. While recording ``Southern Accents,'' which came
out in 1985, he punched a wall and broke his hand, an injury that
took a year and a half to heal.
   Then, Petty's house in Los Angeles burned down, destroying
everything he owned.
   ``I'm very cynical,'' he admitted. ``I try to temper that
somewhat because it's no fun to be cynical all the time and also
not very productive. You try to be as positive as you can in the
world of these days.''
   But along came the Wilburys.
   ``I felt maybe, in a way, some cosmic way, that was given to me
to compensate for the house,'' Petty said. ``The nice thing about
the Wilburys, other than it being a great album, was I made some
very good friends, people that are very much a big part of my life.
If Jeff and George didn't play a guitar or anything, I'd still love
them very much.
   ``It was very refreshing, one of the nicest things that's ever
happened to me.''
   Much of ``Full Moon Fever'' was recorded before the Wilburys
album and features Petty's familiar contrast of upbeat music and
wary, sometimes bleak lyrics.
   ``I Won't Back Down,'' the first single, follows the pattern of
Petty's AOR standard, ``Refugee,'' maintaining hope in an unhappy
world.
   ``It's sort of the classic theme of a lot of the work I've done.
I think faith is very important just to get through life. I think
it's really important that you believe in yourself, first of all.
It's a very hard to thing to come by, but when you get it, it's
invaluable.''
   More often, Petty's lyrics are about betrayal. ``You gotta be
careful what you dream,'' he warns on ``A Thing About You,'' a
track off ``Hard Promises.'' In ``Depending on You,'' another song
from ``Full Moon Fever,'' he pleads with his girlfriend to trust
him, not to let him down.
   ``When you love somebody you become very dependent on them
whether you like it or not. Sometimes it's a very scary thing.
   ``I've been an independent person in a lot of ways, but you
realize how dependent you are on the people you love, on your
friends, your pals, you're dependent on them. I don't believe I can
make it all alone.''

   Even with sales of over 30 million books,
Frederick Forsyth, the author of ``The Day of the Jackal'' and
``The Fourth Protocol,'' insists he does not like to write.
   ``It's partly because I'm not a compulsive writer, like some of
my colleagues,'' explained the 50-year-old British author. ``I try
and take a period off between books and do something that has
nothing do do with books.''
   When Forsyth does force himself to the typewriter, he maintains
a strict schedule: rise around 7 a.m., at his desk by 8, reread the
previous chapters, start writing at 9, continue until his daily
ration of 12 pages is completed.
   The books usually take 4-5 months to research, 6-7 weeks to
write and arrive faithfully every 5 years. The results are just as
predictable: tightly constructed, easy-to-read spy thrillers that
blend historical figures and fictional characters.
   ``It's the story that identifies what I have to research,''
Forsyth said. ``I work out the story first, beginning middle and
end, chapter and verse _ right down to almost the smallest
details.''
   Originally a journalist, Forsyth chooses an international topic
of interest and carefully works out every plot twist, making sure
to establish a logical motivation for each of his characters.
   ``The Devil's Alternative,'' published in 1979, anticipated the
fall of the Shah of Iran and the rise of a female prime minister in
Great Britain. For his latest novel, ``The Negotiator'' ($19.95,
Bantam), Forsyth imagines the world shaken by a major energy
crisis. The idea came while Forsyth was lunching with a friend.
   ``He said there's a feasibility of our running out of oil,''
Forsyth said. ``The Saudis are going to own us. Out of 41 producer
nations, 31 are scheduled to run out within 20 years. Six of the 10
remaining are from the Middle East. That's power.
   ``I saw that Russia is due to run out in nine years. That
started my thought processes. What the hell are they going to do?
They're in more dire straights then we were.''
   The plot centers on the kidnapping of college student Simon
Cormack, the son of John Cormack, the president of the United
States who has agreed to a sweeping arms reduction deal with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Desperate U.S. officials turn to an embittered former hostage
negotiator, Quinn, to attain the young Cormack's release.
   In a book filled with presidents, prime ministers and
millionaire businessmen, Forsyth considered it essential to
structure the story around Quinn.
   ``It's difficult for the public to identify with a big
organization or a big government ministry,'' he said. ``We prefer
to empathize with one individual. The guy who stands up to the
establishment.
   ``The only way a man would have that capacity to act as a loner
would be that role. If he's for the FBI he's going to be on strings
to superior officers. If he's CIA, it's the same thing.''
   He used the same approach for his first book, ``The Day of the
Jackal,'' which came out in 1971.
   French President Charles de Gaulle had been under harsh
criticism in the early 1960s for favoring the independence of
Algeria, and several assassination attempts were made by the OAS
(Organisation de l'Armee Secrete).
   ``It just occurred to me that they weren't getting anywhere near
him because they were infiltrated,'' recalled Forsyth, a French
correspondent for Reuters at the time. ``French counterintelligence
got so many people in OAS they were being blown away.''
   He decided to write a book about a hired assassin's attempt,
code name ``The Jackal,'' to kill de Gaulle.
   ``I just dashed it off in a break between journalistic
assignments, thinking I might make a quick $1,000. Even my
publishers (Huntington; Viking), they decided they were going to
print 5,000 copies, thinking that was a very good print run.''
   The novel sold millions of copies, was translated into 11
languages and won the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe
Award. He was immediately comissioned to write two more books,
leaving behind his career in journalism.
   ``I thought it was like playing football,'' said Forsyth, who
followed up ``Jackal'' with ``The Odessa File'' and ``The Dogs of
War.''
   ``If the ball suddenly arrives in your hands, don't just stand
there staring at the stadium, run. You may crash, but go for it.''

   Little Casey Schlitz, whose dad is a
songwriter, had just learned the Lord's Prayer and got into the
habit of saying ``forever and ever, amen'' at the end of everything
he said.
   Schlitz and a hot singer-songwriter named Paul Overstreet
started tinkering with what the 4-year-old said and turned it into
the 1988 Grammy-winner ``Forever and Ever, Amen,'' which was
recorded by country star Randy Travis and became one of the biggest
hits in recent years.
   ``We started monkeying around with it, and before you knew it,
it started being fun,'' Overstreet recalled. ``It was done in an
hour and a half or so, and we had an idea who should sing it.
   ``It was a unique way to say something at that time, but it
didn't give me chills the first time I heard it. A lot of the
success was due to Randy Travis' popularity at the time.''
   Overstreet was surprised to win a Grammy for the song.
   ``I don't think it's sunk in yet to be recognized with the `big
boys.' That's the big leagues there. Being a country boy from down
in Mississippi and going to New York (for the Grammy show), it was
pretty neat. It was an opportunity you don't get every day.''
   Sixteen years ago, Overstreet, who was born in Newton, Miss.,
and raised in Vancleave, arrived in Nashville without a job and
homeless. He slept in an empty church until he could find work as a
welder. Then he finally broke into the music business, writing and
singing. In the past three years, he's probably been the top
songwriter in country music.
   He wrote ``On the Other Hand,'' also recorded by Travis, which
was voted song of the year in 1987 by both the Country Music
Association and the Academy of Country Music. And he wrote or
co-wrote a string of other country hits: ``Diggin' Up Bones'' and
``Deeper Than the Holler,'' both recorded by Travis; ``When You Say
Nothing at All,'' recorded by the late Keith Whitley; ``Same Ole
Me,'' by George Jones; ``You're Still New to Me,'' by Marie Osmond
and Paul Davis; ``One Love at a Time,'' by Tanya Tucker; and ``I
Fell in Love Last Night,'' by the Forester Sisters.
   As a recording artist, his debut RCA album ``Sowin' Love'' has
produced two hit singles this year: the title cut plus ``Love Helps
Those.''
   The 34-year-old Overstreet has also tackled an alcohol and drug
problem, and says he's found an inner peace after quitting
substances four years ago. That's when his songwriting career also
blossomed.
   ``I'm in a real peaceful place with myself right now,'' he said.
``I still expect quite a bit from myself, but I feel I'm in the
right place on the right road and I'll progress as time goes on.
This is the first time in my life I can actually say I'm on the
right road. I feel I'm building in the right direction.''
   He used cocaine and developed a reputation as one of the biggest
boozers in music industry hangouts. ``I drank 'til it was over,''
he recalled. ``It was a miserable time.
   ``I definitely was wasting my talent. I didn't finish songs. I
didn't have the energy to work. I was operating at 25 to 50 percent
of my capabilities on an average.''
   In his songwriting, he tries to convey positive messages and
talk about life's potentials.
   ``I've tried to say things in songs to encourage people rather
than take advantage of weaknesses,'' Overstreet said. ``I try to
see things that would help people see how things could be.
   ``I try to sew a lot of that into the songs. It's a real
complicated process. I'll think of something in a way I've never
looked at it before. Then I can formulate the two ends together
with the chorus in the middle.
   ``I try to paint the picture, set the story I'm developing
around the idea. At that point, the lyrics and music kind of come
together.''
   And that's how ``Forever and Ever, Amen'' happened.
   A memorable line from the song is ``as long as old men sit and
talk about the weather, as long as old women sit and talk about old
men.''
   ``That's pretty plain,'' Overstreet said. ``It's real. It hit
the heart of a lot of people.''

<HEAD>Woman Granted Marijuana For Glaucoma Crusades For Those Denied</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elvy Musikka begins most days like she
ends them _ smoking a legal joint and hoping others like her can do
the same some day.
   Either rolled like a cigarette or baked into brownies, marijuana
has been in Musikka's life for more than 12 years as she tried to
lessen the effects of glaucoma, which has left her with only 10
percent of her sight.
   Yet she clearly sees herself as a crusader for the thousands of
glaucoma victims around the United States denied legal use of the
drug that reduces the high eye pressure caused by the disease.
   ``I think people have every right to sue the government for
keeping them from what could be their one hope left of keeping
their sight,'' said Musikka, 44, one of three people given
government-grown marijuana for medical reasons.
   ``I am constantly haunted by the idea there are others who will
never see the stars again or look upon their children because they
were denied a simple plant.''
   Musikka's application for legal marijuana was approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October, two months after a
Broward Circuit Court judge was persuaded to clear her of
marijuana-growing charges.
   Each month, Musikka receives 300 marijuana cigarettes shipped to
Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami.
   If she smokes, it's a joint every three hours. ``But actually I
prefer to eat it,'' said Musikka. ``You feel less stoned and it
lasts longer. I can eat some pot brownies and go about 12 hours.
Also, your throat doesn't get so raspy. But that's OK if you want
to sing some blues.''
   Musikka has turned to music since her limited sight keeps her
from working. She now travels around Florida discussing marijuana
treatment for glaucoma and promoting her newly released four-song
record partially funded by a $6,000 grant from the state Division
of Blind Services.
   The songs _ two in English and two in Spanish _ are among lyrics
and melodies she began after her glaucoma worsened in 1976. ``I was
scared to death of going totally blind. The music was a way to keep
my mind off my problems.''
   Musikka has a scrapbook with the cover photograph showing her
beside a bushy marijuana plant in 1984. The pages are covered with
clippings about her legal fight and her clandestine days growing
her own marijuana.
   In 1976, she conducted an interview under a pseudonym for a
newspaper in her hometown of Hollywood, about 15 miles north of
Miami. When friends realized Musikka was the subject of the story,
they began bringing her marijuana.
   ``It was great because I was raising two kids and couldn't
afford to keep a supply on my own. But I decided to grow my own to
save some money and at least have some always on hand... The
problem was keeping out animals _ birds, cats and dogs. They seem
to love it. One time my puppy ate a whole plant. He slept for a
couple hours but otherwise he was alright.''
   For nearly 10 years, Musikka grew several marijuana plants on
the deck of her screen-enclosed pool. A roommate in February 1988
tipped police and Musikka spent a night in jail before being bailed
out. Her case drew wide publicity and support from two others
allowed legal marijuana: glaucoma sufferer Bob Randall and South
Florida stockbroker Irvin Rosenfeld, who has a rare disease that
causes tumors in his bones.
   Randall, president of the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics in
Washington, said Musikka is only the third person to be guaranteed
a supply of marijuana.
   ``I can't explain why the government is withholding marijuana
while people are going blind,'' said Musikka.
   FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said no figures are available on
the number of people given marijuana under medical experiments,
including cancer patients who use it to counteract the nausea from
chemotherapy.

<HEAD>Decades Later, TV's Inventor is Focus of New Attention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK WARBIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIGBY, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years after commercial television made
its flickering debut at the New York World's Fair, the passion of a
gangly teen-ager who made it possible is finally being requited.
   ``It's high time,'' said Elma ``Pem'' Farnsworth, who for 44
years was sounding board, sweetheart, lab assistant and wife to
Philo Taylor Farnsworth.
   But she wasn't his first love. Television was.
   Farnsworth, who died in 1971, was 15 years old in 1922 when he
diagrammed his idea for an electronic TV system on a high school
blackboard in this eastern Idaho farming town.
   Chemistry teacher Justin Tolman's memory of that drawing,
including the first description of an electronic ``image
dissector'' TV camera tube, helped Farnsworth win the first in a
series of patent battles with RCA over early TV technology in the
1930s.
   But if Farnsworth won the battles, RCA won the war. Outside
Idaho and his native Utah, most history and reference books place
him on the sidelines among ``other pioneers'' who contributed to
television's development.
   Most of the glory went to Vladimir Zworykin, the
Russian-American inventor who developed the iconoscope and
kinescope during a career primarily with RCA. Farnsworth, who
received some 160 patents, finally was inducted into the National
Inventors Hall of Fame in 1984 _ seven years after Zworykin.
   ``We're going to set the record straight across the country,''
said Kent Farnsworth, the inventor's son.
   Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter proclaimed May 2 ``Philo T. Farnsworth
Day,'' kicking off a fund-raising effort for a bronze statue of
Farnsworth in National Statuary Hall. It is scheduled for placement
May 2, 1990 in the U.S. Capitol.
   Farnsworth, who was born in the southwestern Utah town of
Beaver, was picked for the honor by the Utah Legislature at the
urging of a Salt Lake City elementary school class that researched
a number of famous Utahns.
   ``People kind of like a guy who's an underdog,'' said Bruce
Barnson, principal at Ridgecrest Elementary. ``Here's a guy who was
brilliant, came up with television and really got nothing out of
it.''
   In Rigby, the Farnsworth Television Group is raising money for a
TV museum to highlight his achievements. There already are signs on
U.S. 20 leading into the town of 2,600 proclaiming Rigby the
``Birthplace of Television.''
   The Community Center, in a former bank building, has a
collection of Farnsworth memorabilia in what used to be a vault.
Last year it featured the Emmy he won posthumously in 1978 for his
contributions to TV technology.
   Mrs. Farnsworth, now 81, recently wrote an essay about her
husband for People magazine, criticizing RCA chief David Sarnoff's
effort to ``control the television industry just like he'd
controlled radio.''
   That theme is explored further in a book Mrs. Farnsworth hopes
to publish titled, ``Distant Vision: Romance and Discovery on an
Invisible Frontier.''
   She recounts how the financial strain of legal disputes with RCA
forced the Farnsworth Television &amp; Radio Corp. to the verge of
bankruptcy, and finally to sell out to International Telephone &amp;
Telegraph in 1949.
   But Edward W. Herold, a former RCA researcher and retired
director of the electronics research laboratory at the David
Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, N.J., said jabs at Sarnoff,
Zworykin or RCA are misplaced.
   ``I think Farnsworth got plenty of credit from the historians,
more than he deserves. He was really a genius; a really bright
guy,'' Herold said.
   ``Farnsworth was a competitor, and a good competitor... But I
would say he was eventually overwhelmed by the number of brilliant
people we had at RCA.''
   Farnsworth, who continued research in physics after selling the
business, developed an early electron microscope to study the
uniformity of the phosphor coating on tubes in the image dissector.
His work also helped in development of night-vision scopes, radar
and an incubator for premature babies.
   He was at Brigham Young University at the time of his death,
working on an area of physics that science has yet to conquer _
nuclear fusion.
   Mrs. Farnsworth said new attention to his life should be an
example to a new generation of discoverers. ``Phil was told
television was impossible by everyone he talked to about it. I'm
hoping this will encourage young people to stick by their guns and
not be dissuaded by anyone.''

<HEAD>Consumer Demand Prompts Study for Low-Salt Cheese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health-conscious consumers are demanding
foods that are low in salt, but taking it out of cheese does more
than change the taste _ it can allow some bacteria to flourish,
making the food unsafe.
   ``Fermentation in cheese is tolerant of salt, but the bacteria
that makes us sick don't tolerate salt,'' said Steve Taylor,
director of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln food processing
center.
   Under a grant from the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board through
the University of Wisconsin, Taylor and assistant professor Robert
Hutkins will study bacteria growth in low-salt cheddar cheese
produced by food chemist Bob Lindsay at the Madison, Wis., school.
Wisconsin researcher Eric Johnson will test the cheese for
clostridium botulinum, the toxin that causes botulism poisoning,
which can be fatal in humans.
   ``No one's ever got botulism from cheese, for two reasons,''
Taylor said. ``One is salt and the second is moisture content.
There is not much likelihood that it would grow, but the industry
will say, `Prove it, then we will consider this product,' and
that's basically the reason for the study.''

<HEAD>INEL to Test Waste Glassification, Vapor Removal Systems</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   IDAHO FALLS, Idaho _ Thousands of pounds of radioactive waste
buried beneath the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory will be
melted into glass and chemical vapors sucked from the ground in
tests starting in August.
   For ``in situ vitrification,'' electrodes will be buried and 5
megawatts of electricity will heat the soil to more than 3,600
degrees Fahrenheit, trapping the hazardous waste in an inert,
glassy substance like Pyrex pans.
   The Department of Energy has used vitrification at its Savannah
River nuclear site in South Carolina and the Environmental
Protection Agency uses it at a non-radioactive waste site in Ohio.
   The estimated $350 million it would cost to vitrify wastes
buried here from 1954 to 1970 compares with an estimated $1 billion
to $2 billion for removal, shipment and storage, said project
manager Janice Landon.
   In 1987, the DOE found organic vapors in the ground below the
waste complex, and determined there wer thousands of gallons of
carbon tetrachloride, a cleaning solvent, and other materials.
   Workers will drill about 260 feet through basalt this summer and
install a ground vapor extraction system to suck out up to 500
cubic feet a minute of the vapors. The gases will be passed through
a filter to remove radioactive particles and through a charcoal bed
to remove organic components.
   Tests will run for four months beginning Aug. 1 at a cost of
$630,000.
   The process has been used elsewhere to clean up gasoline leaks,
but this is the first time it would be tested that deep in the
ground, officials said. The state and the EPA must approve the use
of the vapor system.

<HEAD>Universal Vaccination Suggested For Hepatitis B</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The current strategy for vaccinating against
hepatitis B has not significantly curbed the disease, and it may
make sense to inoculate every infant and 12-year-old instead, a
federal expert says.
   That would cost up to $150 million a year just for publicly
funded programs, said Miriam Alter, head of hepatitis surveillance
at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Hepatitis B
infections cost the nation more than $700 million a year in
treatment and lost worktime.
   No cost-effectiveness analysis of the massive vaccination
approach has been done, but ``that's what we think is the ideal
strategy,'' Alter said.
   CDC is not now recommending it because no money is available,
and much organizing among pediatricians, parents and local health
departments would be required before it could begin, she said in an
interview, adding she hoped it could be put in place ``someday
soon.''
   An estimated 300,000 new hepatitis B infections occur every year
in the United States, said Alter. The annual number of new cases
rose 67 percent from 1978 to 1985 although a vaccine became
available in 1982. Some 5,000 to 6,000 Americans a year die from
resulting liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and
cancer.
   Vaccination is now recommended for people in high-risk groups.
Because the virus can be spread by sexual contact or infected
hypodermic needles, those at risk include homosexually active men,
heterosexuals with multiple sex partners, health care workers, drug
abusers and those who have sex with infected people.
   Although about 2.5 million Americans have been vaccinated, Alter
said, the effort has done little to stem the disease. At least 30
percent of the infected people don't come from any of the high-risk
groups, and most inoculations have been given to health care
workers, who comprised no more than 5 percent of hepatitis B cases
even before the vaccine was available, she said.
   Vaccinating every infant would be effective, but it would take
years before the children got old enough to affect disease totals
appreciably, Alter said. Including 12-year-olds at the same time
would have a faster impact.
   The two-pronged program would initially cost $100 million a year
in public funding and peak at $150 million, the decline because
adolescent immunizations would be stopped once inoculated infants
reached age 12, she said.
   CDC recently gave the cost figures to Congress, which sought a
strategy to eliminate hepatitis B. Alter said she was not aware of
any reaction.

   Paul Gabriel Bailey Holc is a big name for a little boy, but it
honors those who gave him a big gift _ life.
   Paul Holc was known to the world simply as Baby Paul when he was
born 1{ years ago with an underdeveloped heart that was replaced by
Dr. Leonard Bailey with the walnut-sized heart of Baby Gabriel,
born with virtually no brain.
   ``To leave such a legacy ... you can't be anything but proud. To
know there's another little child alive even though there's no hope
for your own child. I swell up I just feel so good,'' said Karen
Schouten, whose daughter was named after the archangel Gabriel, the
herald of good news.
   Bailey, too, is proud of being part of Paul's life. ``I feel
he's touched down in all of our lives in different kinds of ways.
... There's no dark side to this story that I can perceive.''
   Others do see a dark side, however. And because of the
controversy surrounding the use of the doomed, anencephalic infants
as organ donors, Paul's transplant was the last.
   Some experts contend the babies should be used because they will
die within days and many infant organs are needed. Critics say
keeping them on respirators just for their organs is inhumane and a
frightening precedent.
   Karen Schouten and Alice Holc have never met or even talked to
one another, but the two mothers react similarly in the face of
such condemnation.
   ``It doesn't bother me because I understand you can't please
everybody all the time. There's always a group of people who are
going to disagree and want to play the devil's advocate on any
issue,'' Mrs. Holc said from her home near Vancouver, British
Columbia. ``What bothers me is when a group of ethicists ... delve
into it and they don't really seem to know all the facts.
   ``They don't even know what an anencephalic baby looks like.''
   There is no hope for these infants who are born dying. And there
can be no mistake, doctors say, in identifying them.
   Victims of anencephaly are born with a brain stem, which
controls breathing and neurological reflexes, but no cerebral
hemispheres and only a partial skull. Because there is brain-stem
activity, they are not brain dead, legally a necessary condition
before organs can be removed for transplantation.
   Anencephaly is believed to result from failure of the neural
tube to fuse in the uppermost portion of the brain during the first
month of pregnancy. Like other neural tube defects, the overall
incidence is decreasing, mainly because of prenatal diagnosis that
often leads to abortion.
   About half the 1,000 to 2,000 anencephalic babies born each year
in the United States are stillborn, said Dr. Muin Khoury of the
Centers for Disease Control's birth defects branch. The rest die
within a few days or a week at most and so receive only ``comfort
care'' _ food, water and warmth.
   Without life-support systems, their hearts and livers
deteriorate because of insufficient oxygen and are useless for
transplantation. Kidneys, though damaged, still might be viable.
   Meanwhile, 243 children under age 5 were awaiting organs in
early May, 24 of them under age 1, according to the United Network
for Organ Sharing, which administers the National Organ Procurement
and Transplantation Network.
   Experts estimate as many as half of those under age 2 die
waiting.
   ``The problem is, you cannot find baby donors because children
routinely don't die under the circumstances of brain death. You
don't get a child who goes out on Friday night, has a few beers and
gets in a car accident,'' said Brian Broznick, executive director
of the Pittsburgh Transplant Foundation.
   The shortage prompted Bailey, of Loma Linda University Medical
Center, to transplant a baboon heart into a 12-day-old girl known
as Baby Fae in 1984. She died 20 days later amid public uproar. The
operation was never repeated.
   Experts disagree on whether anencephalic babies feel pain and
whether artificially prolonging life might pressure parents into
continuing a pregnancy solely for organ donation. Critics fear who
else could become targets.
   ``Once you start defining one set of human beings as being
somehow less human than the rest of us, where the heck are you
going to draw the line?'' asked Leslie Bond, associate editor of
the National Right to Life News.
   Jen Molnar of Cincinnati, whose anencephalic son, Jeremy, lived
three days in 1985, also worries about this ``slippery slope.''
   ``That respirator serves no purpose for that child to live. The
only purpose it serves is to promote them as an organ farm,'' she
said.
   ``The notion of anencephalics as organ donors has gotten so
bound up in philosophical notions that we've kind of lost the
central focus, that is salvaging organs,'' Bailey said. ``We
certainly can't salvage anencephalics... We're very likely to
structure the use of the salvage of organs in such a way that all
the other baggage isn't of vital concern.
   ``I don't see it as being such a huge issue that human beings
can't come to grips with it in realistic terms and pragmatic terms
in ways that would enrich us as a society.''
   Loma Linda had no official policy on anencephalic newborns when
Alice Holc learned in 1987 that the left ventricle of her baby's
heart was underdeveloped, a condition that would kill him soon
after birth. In an unprecedented move, the unborn child was placed
on a transplant waiting list.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Schouten and her husband, Fred, of Barrie,
Ontario, had approached Canadian doctors about donating the organs
of their unborn daughter, diagnosed in the womb as anencephalic.
``We wanted to have some good come from this,'' Mrs. Schouten
explained.
   Paul, born by Caesarean section, was just three hours old on
Oct. 16, 1987, when Bailey's surgical team made him the world's
youngest organ recipient.

   Fred Schouten died two months later of a heart attack at age 36,
and his wife said donating Gabriel's heart ``gives me the ability
to smile when I think about her and him, instead of cry.''
   Also in December 1987, Loma Linda established a procedure for
accepting anencephalic infants as prospective organ donors. The
babies would be placed on respirators for up to seven days awaiting
cessation of brain stem function.
   The California medical center's program was established at the
urging of many parents of anencephalic infants, most notably Brenda
and Michael Winner of Arcadia, Calif., who were determined to share
their unborn daughter's organs.
   But Jarren Winner was stillborn on Dec. 22, 1987, dashing their
hopes. She was cremated and her ashes placed in a silver urn
decorated with turquoise, her birthstone. The urn is prominently
displayed on a living room shelf.
   ``I was very proud of her. From the neck down, she was
perfect,'' said Mrs. Winner, 33, who is writing a book titled ``Ten
Perfect Fingers.''
   Above the neck, though, Jarren was fatally flawed.
   ``If you go right above the forehead and saw off the back of her
head, that's what it looks like,'' Mrs. Winner said. ``It was all
open. It looked like liver in a butcher market ... with the brain
stem protruding.''
   Loma Linda suspended its program last July after only two of 12
babies met brain death standards. Neither became a donor, one
because the organs were no longer viable and the other because no
suitable recipient was found.
   ``Twelve infants were sufficient to show us this is not a
feasible technique or solution'' to the infant organ shortage, said
Dr. Joyce Peabody, Loma Linda's chief of neonatology.
   Children's Hospital of Western Ontario, where Gabriel was born,
put its program on hold in March. Two of the next three
respirator-sustained infants were not brain dead within the
required week. A 5-day-old girl's liver was sent to the United
States but the recipient needed another transplant, said Dr.
Timothy Frewen, director of pediatric critical care.
   With such a low incidence of brain death, Frewen and other
doctors wonder if the issue is worth pursuing. The Canadian
Pediatric Society plans to make a recommendation at its annual
meeting this month. A task force of five U.S. medical societies
expects to publish a report this year.
   The United Network for Organ Sharing's directors in February
declined to impose a moratorium, but adopted a policy discouraging
use of anencephalic organs, at least until further study.
   ``Society and the medical profession to some extent have learned
following Baby Gabriel's experience,'' Frewen said. ``Without
accumulating experience, one can't say one way or another.''
   Worldwide, 80 anencephalic infants have been accepted as
prospective donors since the 1960s, said Dr. David Stumpf,
professor of pediatrics and neurology at Northwestern University
and coordinator of the U.S. task force. Forty-one became donors,
providing 37 kidneys, two livers and three hearts; transplants were
successful in 11 kidney cases and one heart case, Paul's.
   Of six such kidney transplants at Children's Hospital Medical
Center in Cincinnati, only one recipient still has the original
anencephalic organs, said Dr. Paul McEnery, head of the kidney
transplant program.
   That patient, Brian Bourgraf, now 25 and an assistant credit
manager for a Wilmington, Ohio, hardware manufacturer, received new
kidneys in 1968.
   ``If that person was here, as he's looking down, he's probably
saying, `I'm glad I did it,''' he said. ``His parents are more than
glad, because they've seen what's come out of it.''
   Bourgraf frequently is cited by supporters of proposed Ohio
legislation to establish brain-death category solely for
anencephalic infants that is based on their ability to breathe
without life-support systems. Similar measures have been considered
in New Jersey and California.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, suspects ``a significant number'' of
parents would donate their anencephalic babies' organs if they
could.
   Karen Schouten agrees. ``When you see a little baby like Paul it
makes it all worthwhile.''

   The stock market declined slightly today,
pulling back from the post-crash highs it reached at the end of
last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.62 to 2,511.21
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 461 up, 517 down and 514
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.49 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the U.S. market registered no strong response to
the strife in Beijing, although stocks in Hong Kong took a severe
drop.
   Rather, they said, it appeared that some traders were cashing in
on the market's recent gains, believing it was due for at least a
pause after its steady advance in recent months.
   The domestic business and financial news background was
generally positive, brokers noted. Several large banks lowered
their prime lending rates from 11.5 percent to 11 percent.
   And a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives gave
further support to the belief that the economy was slowing, and
thus presumably giving the Federal Reserve added incentive to relax
its credit policy.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
dropped \ to 36; General Electric \ to 55{; Eastman Kodak [ to 47,
and International Business Machines | to 109{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .20 to 181.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .15 at 360.62.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.20 to
2,517.83, finishing the week with a net gain of 23.06 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 1,115 up, 422 down and 464 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 229.14 million shares, against 223.16
million in the previous session.

   The Italian telecommunications equipment maker
Italtel on Monday signed an agreement with American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. for a far-reaching partnership in manufacturing and
sales of equipment.
   Under the accord, AT&amp;T will acquire 20 percent of Italtel. In
exchange, Italtel's parent, the Italian state holding company STET,
will take a 20 percent share of AT&amp;T-Network Systems International
(ATT-NSI), a joint venture between AT&amp;T and NV Philips of the
Netherlands.
   In addition, AT&amp;T has agreed to make a direct investment of
almost $150 million in Italtel, said an official involved in the
deal who requested anonymity.
   The accord, which was widely expected, was an important victory
for AT&amp;T. It allows the U.S. giant access to the ripe Italian
telecommunications market, which is dominated by Italtel, and
improves AT&amp;T's position for the post-1992 unified European market.
   Stet and Italtel hope to gain advanced technology, investment
and increased credibility through the alliance.
   Both AT&amp;T and Italtel have only limited access to foreign
markets at present.
   Although the value of the share swap wasn't disclosed at a news
conference announcing the deal, AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen said
they ``balanced out in terms of value.''
   The cooperation agreement was signed following four months of
detailed negotiations between AT&amp;T and Stet-Italtel.
   AT&amp;T was selected as Italtel's partner over Siemens AG of West
Germany, Alcatel NV of France and Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson
after a politically charged decision-making process that took more
than a year.
   Allen said it was ``premature'' to estimate the value of the
orders AT&amp;T expected to receive through the partnership.
   But AT&amp;T is expected to win a big chunk of the nearly $26
billion in orders for equipment and technology that the Italian
phone company SIP has planned as part of a five-year investment
plan.
   The AT&amp;T-Italtel agreement involves cooperation in research and
development, production, the purchase of components, sales,
installation and servicing in the fields of public switching,
transmission, support systems and private telecommunications.
   Part of the accord provides for establishment of an
equally-owned company to market a ``common catalogue'' of
AT&amp;T-Italtel telecommunications equipment to European and Asian
markets.

   Grain and soybeans futures prices turned mixed
after opening lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Pressure came early on two fronts, the first being the plentiful
rain over the weekend in key growing areas for beans and corn. The
second reason was that the Chinese, thought to be in the market for
as much as a million tons of grain, would be postponing their buy.
   Political upheaval was generally regarded as the cause for the
Chinese decision not to come to the market at this time.
   Both the grains and beans, however, made a comeback within the
first hour and turned mixed as new crop months gained at the
expense of old crop months.
   On the open, wheat was 3 cents to 5{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.86{ a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to 1} cents lower, with July $2.60{ a bushel; oats were }

   Livestock and pork futures were mostly higher at the Chicago

   Live cattle were unchanged to .40 cent higher, with June at

with August at 78.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent lower

   A fish industry spokesman said today ``it's
ludicrous'' to claim deficiencies in seafood inspection make eating
seafood more dangerous than eating fat.
   But Lee Weddig, executive vice president of the National
Fisheries Institute, said he favors improved seafood inspection as
much as do consumer groups who made the claim.
   When American try to improve their eating habits by cutting down
on fat they often turn to fish.
   ``Unless legislation establishing a comprehensive mandatory
seafood inspection program is enacted and signed in this Congress,
those same health-conscious consumers will be putting themselves at
increasing risk for serious illness, even death,'' said Ellen Haas,
spokeswoman for the consumer group Public Voice.
   Currently, the Food and Drug Administration has a shellfish
sanitation program and a canned salmon control program, which are
both voluntary, Haas said.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service, in the Department of
Commerce, has a voluntary inspection and grading program, but it
emphasizes uniformity of size, flavor and freedom from blemishes.
It is not a public health program, she said.
   Weddig and Haas were among the witnesses who testified today
before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, which is gathering information for possible fish
inspection legislation.
   While the Agriculture Department is in charge of most food
inspection, including livestock and poultry, it does not inspect
seafood, Haas said. In an interview Friday, she said it would make
sense to put such an inspection under the USDA because it already
has the structure.
   Weddig said he also favors USDA inspection of seafood.
   He said his organization went to Congress in 1985 seeking an
inspection program. He said the National Marine Fisheries Service
has been working for two years on the best approach and will be
making recommendations to Congress.
   ``These hearings are running parallel to that,'' said Weddig.
``We hope they will come together.''
   But Weddig said ``it's ludicrous'' to make a claim such as that
made by Public Voice. He said the fish sold commercially is safe.
   ``Waters that are polluted, mostly in the inland lakes, have
been closed to commercial fishing for years,'' he said.
   As for the salmon affected by the oil spill in Alaska, Weddig
said public officials were monitoring the catch carefully and would
not allow anything to be sold that was not safe.
   The subcommittee hearing, chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
was the first congressional hearing on seafood since 1974.
   Haas said it came at a critical time.
   ``Annual consumption of seafood in the United States increased
by over 20 percent between 1980 and 1987 and is now well over 3
billion pounds,'' she said.
   Haas said seafood has certain characteristics that increase
health risks. Namely, it comes from uncontrolled environments where
bacteria and parasites dwell.
   ``The waters from which fish are taken may be polluted with
sewage, industrial chemicals or pesticides,'' she said. ``In
addition, certain types of seafood, such as shellfish, actually
concentrate contaminants in their tissue.''
   Though cooking kills many causes of food poisoning, fish often
is eaten raw.
   Haas said that according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control statistics from 1973 to 1984, more people got sick from
fish and shellfish than from beef and poultry combined.
   She said the figures attain added significance when it's
realized that Americans eat more than four times as much beef and
three times as much poultry as they do of seafood.
   Public Voice has been working with Dingell's subcommittee on the
issue. Dingell said in March he hoped to have legislation prepared
soon.

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing
today, pausing after last week's climb to new highs since the 1987
crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.17 to 2,510.66
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 711 up, 642 down and
498 unchanged.
   Analysts said the U.S. market registered no strong overall
response to the strife in Beijing, although stocks in Hong Kong
took a severe drop.
   Rather, they said, it appeared that some traders were cashing in
on the market's recent gains, believing it was due for at least a
pause after its steady advance in recent months.
   The domestic business and financial news background was
generally positive, brokers noted. Several large banks lowered
their prime lending rates from 11.5 percent to 11 percent.
   And a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives gave
further support to the belief that the economy was slowing, and
thus presumably giving the Federal Reserve added incentive to relax
its credit policy.
   Windmere Corp. fell 3[ to 15~ as the most active NYSE issues.
The company, which has extensive facilities in China, said its
operations there had not been affected so far by the turmoil.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down [ at
55|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down ] at 35~, and
International Business Machines, down \ at 109~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.01 to 181.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .11 at 360.58.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 76.01 million shares at
noontime, down from 127 million at the same point Friday.

   Several major banks lowered their prime lending
rates half a percentage point to 11 percent today, responding to
the decline of interest rates on financial markets.
   Citibank, the nation's largest bank, was the first to announce
it had lowered its prime lending rate. Several other big banks,
including Chase Manhattan Bank, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Chemical
Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Bankers Trust Co.,
quickly followed suit.
   Today's decline was the first drop in the prime rate _ used as a
base for a variety of other interest rates, including those on
consumer loans _ since Feb. 2, 1988. On that day, the prime fell
0.25 percentage points to 8.5 percent, but then began a climb that
ended today.
   The latest decline places the prime rate back at the level it
reached on Feb. 10 of this year, when it rose to 11 percent from
10.5 percent. Two weeks later, on Feb. 24, it rose another 0.5
percentage points to 11.5 percent, and remained at that level until
today.
   Economists said today's decline came in response to market
interest rate trends.
   ``The banks have finally acknowledged the drop in rates that has
occurred in recent weeks,'' said Ward McCarthy, a managing director
of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc., a money market
research firm based in Princeton, N.J.
   The Federal Reserve pushed interest rates higher early this year
to keep the economy from overheating. But rates have fallen
recently ``primarily because the economy has clearly lost a lot of
steam,'' McCarthy said.
   On Feb. 24, the interest rate on the Treasury's 30-year bond was
9.18 percent, while today, the yield was quoted at 8.43 percent.
   McCarthy said it was somewhat surprising that the banks decided
to act although the Fed has not yet eased its stand on interest
rates.
   ``I think it's pretty much a foregone conclusion that the Fed
will ease policy,'' he said.
   But economists also did not foresee the Fed allowing rates to
plunge.
   ``They have not yet been convinced that the inflation dragon has
been tamed,'' said Donald Ratajczk, director of economic
forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
   The prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money,
including interest it pays on customer accounts, short-term
certificates of deposit and bonds, and as such mirrors rather than
forecasts rate trends.

   A 13,000-gallon oil spill that fouled the
Yampa River in northwestern Colorado has been contained, said an
environmental official who criticized the weekend cleanup effort by
the oil company.
   The spill occurred Friday, when a pipeline carrying light crude
oil running beneath the river burst. Amoco Pipeline Co. shut off
the line after Craig police reported the pipe break.
   Amoco crews tried to contain the spill Saturday but weren't
successful until Sunday.
   ``They didn't really put up the booms correctly, which was a
factor in causing the (oil trap anchor) cable to snap,'' said Jeff
Knoy, a spokesman in Denver for the Environmental Protection
Agency. ``They haven't had a lot of experience, or they put it up
incorrectly.
   ``Basically, Amoco's not done the best job. And we've had to
jump on them some,'' he said. ``Part of the problem was high water.
I don't think they've had to do this in a while, but they didn't do
a very good job.''
   But Amoco spokesman Jack Rigg said today the company ``did
everything we reasonably could.''
   He said the pipeline was shut off within 45 minutes of the time
the leak was reported, and said Amoco had 40 people and several
thousand feet of booms at the river within two hours. But the
river's roughness and remoteness foiled those early cleanup
efforts, he said.
   Rigg said Amoco managed to get the oil contained and diverted
within 50 miles of the spill by Sunday, and crews with shovels and
plastic buckets were cleaning up the 50-mile stretch today.
   The Yampa River is a breeding ground for three endangered
species of fish: humpback and bonytail chubs and Colorado squawfish.
   ``The environmental impact was minimal, considering what it
would have been,'' Knoy said Sunday. ``The Fish and Wildlife
Service went up and down the river quite a bit the last few days.
As of last night, there were no dead fish, no fish in distress and
no dead birds.''
   The spill was not expected affect drinking water in this town of
8,000 because it occurred downstream of the point where water is
taken from the river.

<TEXT>
   American consumers' assessment of current
economic conditions is down but expectations remain positive about
the next six months, according to a survey released Monday.
   More than 20 percent of 5,000 households nationwide surveyed in
May by the Conference Board said they anticipate that business
conditions will improve in the next six months. That was up from 17
percent a month earlier.
   Thirty percent of those surveyed said they believe current
business conditions are ``good,'' a slight rise from the April
survey. Despite an increase in unemployment, 34.5 percent of
respondents said they believe jobs are ``plentiful,'' the same as
in April.
   The number of people expecting more jobs to become available
increased to 19 percent from 15.4 percent, but there was also an
increase in the number of people who expect the reverse to happen,
to 15 percent from 13 percent.
   ``The fact that consumer confidence has remained strong, despite
signs of a slowing economy, is reassuring,'' Fabian Linden,
executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center, said in
a statement.
   ``Consumers, who are evidently in the first instance wage
earners, have always been quick to sense oncoming recession,'' he
said. ``But there are none of the indications in recent survey
readings that generally signal troubles ahead.''
   The board's monthly consumer confidence index gained one point
to 117.8, with 1985 as 100. That was down from 120.2 a year ago.
   The Conference Board is a nonprofit business network that
provides information and management and economic research for
business leaders worldwide.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on London's stock exchange ended
significantly lower Monday for the fifth session in a row, as the
market remained unsettled by weakness in sterling and the outlook
for British interest rates.
   Trading activity was dull, however, as many players stuck to the
sidelines, waiting for further evidence of Britain's economic
performance.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 14.1
points lower at 2,088.5, just 0.6 point below its best level
reached at mid-afternoon. At its lowest, the index was down 26.1
points in morning business.
   Volume slowed sharply to 359.2 million shares from 635.9 million
shares on Friday.
   The major factor worrying the London market was the weakness in
sterling, which continued to lose ground despite reported
intervention by the Bank of England to bolster the currency.
   Players were concerned the pound's weakness could trigger yet
another rise in interest rates, which were pushed up 1 percentage
point to 14 percent last month.
   ``There's been no real underpinning of sterling'' from the 14
percent interest rates, said Bill Smith, a market analyst at
Prudential Bache Securities in London. ``The danger of 15 percent
is that much higher, so the danger of a hard landing (for the
British economy) is that much higher.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest consumer survey report suggests that
economic expansion will slow, unemployment and interest rates might
rise and inflation will dig in at a rate of at least 5 percent.
   This isn't an especially negative forecast, because the economy
is expected to continue expanding, but it is a downturn. Consumers
remain comfortable, according to one interpreter, but they expect
things to get worse.
   That information, from the University of Michigan's Survey
Research Center, is being distributed to clients and is destined to
become part of the Commerce Department's index of leading economic
indicators.
   As part of that index, it then will be used by investors,
economists, bankers, regulators, business people and others who
seek to get a peak into the future and, if possible, take some
action about events to come.
   But can consumers forecast?
   You bet they can, says Richard T. Curtin, director of the
Michigan institute. They can, that is, if they are questioned
professionally and their responses recorded and analyzed
scientifically.
   To demonstrate their accuracy, Curtin measured expectations with
what followed in several areas, including interest rates, jobless
rates and inflation rates _ and found a remarkable accuracy rate.
   He found, for instance, that consumers anticipated changes in
interest rates two quarters, or six months, in advance of changes
in the prime interest rate. That beats many a professional's record.
   For unemployment, Curtin found their anticipation time span even
longer, at three quarters or nine months in advance. Regarding
inflation, the foresight was only one quarter in advance but the
accuracy rating was especially high.
   The same general levels of accuracy also pertain to some of the
more specific money items that are measured. Changes in consumer
expectations, for example, accurately foretell housing and vehicle
markets six months in advance.
   There is little mystery to why consumers, en masse, can
forecast. To some extent, in sales for example, they are not
forecasting so much as foretelling. They are, that is, telling the
markets what they intend to do.
   Measured accurately, their own economic condition becomes a
projection of the whole economy, of which consumers are the biggest
segment, bigger than business or government.
   In each area of the Michigan survey, consumers are asked to give
their overall opinions and to describe in their own words reasons
for holding these views. Of course, their financial condition and
hopes enter the picture.
   According to Curtin, when many people change from an optimistic
to a pessimistic view at the same time, it has been found that a
widespread shift toward postponement of expenditures follows.
   It is in this manner, he says, that the economic optimism and
confidence of individual families exert their influence on the
course of the aggregate economy.
   Of particular interest in the latest monthly survey, based on
500 interviews in which about 25 core questions were asked, is the
attitude toward inflation and interest rates.
   Many professional forecasters in financial and economic circles
are expecting a decline in interest rates, reasoning that the
latest economic measurements show the inflation threat is ebbing.
   Consumers, however, see worsening inflation and higher interest
rates.

<HEAD>Macmillan Agrees to Sell Gump's Retail Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC said Monday it
has agreed to sell Gump's, a Macmillan Inc. subsidiary that sells
luxury items through four speciality stores and a mail order
division, for $36.5 million in cash.
   Robert Maxwell, head of Maxwell Communication, said in a
statement that the Gump's sale completes the company's asset sales
as far as Macmillan is concerned.
   Gump's, which specializes in selling fine art, jewelry, antiques
and other high-quality merchandise, will be sold to GMP Acquisition
Corp., a new company formed by the New York-based investment firm
Charterhouse Group International Inc. and Tobu Department Store Co.
Ltd., a Tokyo-based retailer.
   The sale is part of a strategy of focusing on publishing that
the British-based Maxwell has pursued since its $2.5 billion
acquisition of Macmillan and its $750 million buyout of Official
Airlines Guides last year.
   Since those acquisitions, Maxwell estimated that it has sold
about $2 billion in assets.
   The sale of Gump's is expected to be completed by June 30,
subject to regulatory approval. Maxwell had said last December it
planned to sell Gump's.
   Gump's was founded in 1861 and has stores in San Francisco,
Beverly Hills, Houston and Dallas.
   Among the assets sold by Maxwell over the past six months were
the Macmillan Book Clubs, the magazine publisher Gryphon Editions,
the Katherine Gibbs secretarial schools, Macmillan's technical
schools division, Maxwell's BPCC printing business and the Michie
Co., a legal publishing business.

   The dollar ended mostly higher in Europe on Monday
after uneven trading that reflected mixed signals the market was
receiving on the dollar's short-term direction.
   Gold prices also rose.
   Concern about the violence in China heightened the dollar's role
as a ``safe-haven'' currency, dealers said. At the same time, a cut
in the U.S. prime rate to 11 percent from 11.5 percent by major
U.S. banks was a bearish factor, they said.
   ``There are too many signals in the market and therefore no
clear direction,'' said Shani Shamah, corporate dealer at
Continental Illinois Ltd. in London.
   The market's unsettled tone kept many corporate players on the
sidelines, which resulted in thin volume, dealers said.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5815 to buy one pound, cheaper than $$1.5900 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.9630 West German marks, up from 1.9585; 1.6950 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6850; 6.6645 French francs, up from 6.6470; 2.2010 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.2180; 1,416.50 Italian lire, down from
1,428.50; 1.2003 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2063.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 1.15 yen to a closing 140.65 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 141.75 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $366.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $$362.25.
   In Zurich, gold rose to close at a bid $366.00 compared with
$362.00 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.55 to close at a bid $369.20.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Review Illinois-Florida Bank Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide
whether Florida may block an Illinois-based bank holding company
from establishing an industrial savings bank in Miami.
   The justices said they will review the dispute even though Bush
administration lawyers, asked for their views, said a change in
federal banking law may have made the case moot.
   Continental Bank Corporation, based in Illinois, filed an
application with the Florida Department of Banking an Finance in
1981 to establish and run an industrial savings bank in Miami.
   The proposed bank would not accept demand deposits or make
commercial loans _ making it a so-called ``non-bank bank'' that
fell outside the federal law's definition of banks.
   But deposits in the proposed bank would be insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
   The application was denied, and Continental subsequently sued in
federal court. The suit alleged that Florida's denial of the
application was unconstitutional.
   Under federal banking law, a bank holding company based in one
state may not establish a bank in another state unless the latter
state's laws specifically authorize it to do so.
   But because ``non-bank banks'' fall outside the scope of federal
banking law, state regulation of such institutions is subject to
the Constitution's requirement that states not unduly interfere
with or discriminate against interstate commerce.
   While the Continental case was pending before a federal appeals
court in 1987, federal banking law was amended to include in the
definition of ``bank'' any institution the deposits of which are
insured by the FDIC.
   Because the proposed industrial savings bank in Miami was to be
FDIC-insured, it fell within the scope of federal banking law and
subject to Florida's legally authorized discrimination.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, refused to
declare the case moot.
   It instead ruled that the Florida law banning the industrial
savings bank was unconstitutional. The appeals court said it could
say that the change in federal law would make Continental's
operation of the Florida institution ``banking'' activity ``in
every instance.''
   Gerald A. Lewis, who heads the state Department of Banking and
Finance, then sought Supreme Court review.
   The case is Lewis vs. Continental Bank Corp., 87-1955.

<HEAD>Bankers Skeptical Of Brady Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
called on international bankers Monday to help impove Third World
economies by forgiving some of their outstanding debt.
   Brady told the International Monetary Conference, whose
membership includes 99 major commercial banks in 22 countries, that
bankers could enhance their claims if they offered countries the
types of debt reductions proposed in the so-called Brady Plan.
   The plan stresses cutting debt principal and interest payments
over continued lending to heavily indebted countries.
   ``I ask you to compare the risks of inaction with the benefits
of concluding transactions that meet the tests of realism and
reasonableness,'' Brady said.
   If banks follow the Brady plan, ``bank claims will be somewhat
lower, but they will be better claims _ and they will be better
serviced,'' he said.
   But Brady added that Third World debtor nations, which owe about
half their $1.2 trillion debt to commercial banks, would only be
eligible for the plan if they reformed their troubled economies.
   Some bankers, however, were skeptical of the propposal.
   ``It's a bit one-sided to state that debt reduction by the
commercial banks is the answer to the problem,'' Fop Hoogendijk,
managing director of the Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV, told
reporters. ``People should pay their interest.''
   The two main international lending agencies, the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, have backed the debt reduction
strategy, known as the Brady plan, as have the major industrialized
creditor nations.
   In other developments at Monday's conference, bankers and
industrialists discussed the European Economic Community's plan to
drop internal trade and capital barriers in 1992.
   Helmut Sihler, the chief executive officer of the West German
chemical company Henkel KGAA, said companies based outside the EEC
will reap early benefits from the plan. But he said EEC-based
companies face more obstacles to taking advantage of the single
market because they are oriented toward their own national markets.
   Percy Barnevik, the head of Swiss engineering firm ABB Asea
Brown Boveri Ltd., said two-thirds of the EEC-based companies would
be hurt as a result of the market integration proposed in the
Single European Act.
   Barnevik said politicians stressed the positive aspects of
economic unification but ignored the ``hardships ... reduction of
plants, reduction of people'' inherent to industrial progress.
   Other IMC panelists underlined their belief that EEC companies
faced their principal challenge from ever-stronger Japanese and
American companies, regardless of the creation of the single market.
   ``It's not a question of Europe `92. The problem is the
cutthroat outside competition,'' Jean-Louis Beffa, the chief
executive officer of the French glassmaker Saint Gobain, said.
   ``Europe 1992 is not a problem _ it's an answer.''

   Grain and soybeans futures prices closed mostly
higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Pressure came early on two fronts, the first being considerable
rainfall over the weekend in key growing areas of the Midwest.
   The second reason was that China, thought to be in the market
for as much as a million tons of grain, apparently have decided to
postpone such purchases in the wake of civil unrest.
   Both the grains and beans, however, bounced back from early
session lows as buyers came into the markets to cover short
positions. Volume was light in all the pits.
   On the close, wheat was 3{ cents higher to 6 cents higher, with

   The stock market turned downward today, pulling
back after last week's climb to new highs since the 1987 crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 17.46 to
2,500.37 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 678 up, 819 down and
464 unchanged.
   Analysts said the U.S. market registered no strong overall
response to the strife in Beijing, although stocks in Hong Kong
took a severe drop.
   However, several individual stocks of companies with operations
or investments in China and nearby Asian nations ran into selling
pressure.
   Windmere Corp. fell 3{ to 15{ in active trading. The company,
which has extensive facilities in China, said its operations there
had not been affected so far by the turmoil.
   Hong Kong Telecommunications dropped 1~ to 17[; Taiwan Fund 3\
to 36}; Korea Fund 2} to 31; Asia Pacific Fund 1] to 9{, and Thai
Fund } to 15~.
   Otherwise, analysts said, it appeared that some traders were
cashing in on the market's recent gains, believing it was due for
at least a pause after its steady advance in recent months.
   The domestic business and financial news background was
generally positive, brokers noted. Several large banks lowered
their prime lending rates from 11.5 percent to 11 percent.
   And a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives gave
further support to the belief that the economy was slowing, and
thus presumably giving the Federal Reserve added incentive to relax
its credit policy.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Electric, down ] at
55]; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down | at 35|, and
International Business Machines, down ~ at 109\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.69 to 180.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .52 at 359.95.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 131.85 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>Court Clears Way for Drexel Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way
for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. plead guilty to six felonies and
pay $650 million in a long-delayed settlement of a landmark
securities fraud case.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Drexel junk
bond financier Michael Milken to have the federal judge presiding
over the case disqualified on grounds of a conflict of interest.
   Milken, his brother Lowell and a former colleague, Pamela
Monzert, sought to have U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack in
Manhattan removed from their case.
   Pollack must approve a settlement announced in May between the
New York investment firm and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The settlement resolves charges including insider
trading in more than 20 alleged fraud schemes.
   Approval of that settlement is a precondition for Drexel to
plead guilty to six felony counts and pay a record $650 million in
fines and restitution in a separate criminal settlement with the
Justice Department.
   Martin Flumenbaum, an attorney for Michael Milken, declined to
discuss the Supreme Court ruling.
   The Milkens had argued that Pollack has an apparent conflict of
interest because his wife is receiving $30 million from the sale of
a corporation in which Drexel helped set up the financing.
   The acquisition of the corporation owned by Mrs. Pollack is
unrelated to the financial dealings that landed Drexel and Milken
in trouble with the government.
   Pollack refused to disqualify himself from the Drexel-Milken
cases and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year said the
judge acted properly.
   ``We believe...a reasonable person would not conclude that the
judge's impartiality could reasonably be questioned,'' the appeals
court said. ``Judge Pollack's connection (to Drexel) is too remote
to mandate recusal because Drexel has no obligation direct or
indirect to Mrs. Pollack.''
   The challenge to the judge's role in the case has held up
resolution of the SEC's lawsuit against Drexel, which was filed
last September. The SEC also named Milken in the civil suit and
Monday's Supreme Court ruling clears the way for a civil fraud
trial of Milken.
   The 2nd Circuit court refused to assign the case to a different
judge, but barred Pollack from approving the settlement until the
Supreme Court acted on Milken's appeal.
   Once settlement of the SEC's civil suit against Drexel is
concluded, Drexel formally will plead guilty to the felonies and
pay $300 million to the government and $350 million for
compensation of investors victimized by alleged insider trading.
   Drexel originally tried to get Pollack to disqualify himself
from the SEC suit but later dropped its objections.
   The ruling does not affect a separate 98-count criminal fraud
and racketeering indictment against Michael and Lowell Milken that
contains charges similar to ones filed by the SEC. A trial in New
York in that case is scheduled for March 1990.

   The nation's Big Three automakers said Monday
that late May car and light truck sales fell 5.6 percent from last
year, ending the two-month spring buying season that saw a flurry
of incentives to spark sales.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
they sold vehicles at a daily rate of 47,359 during from May 21-31,
compared with a daily rate of 50,181 in the same 1988 period.
   Car sales were down 4.2 percent and truck sales were off 7.9
percent.
   The 10-day period last year was one of the strongest of 1988,
which proved to be the second-best sales year in automobile history.
   Through the first five months of this year, the car- and
truck-selling pace is lagging 5.3 percent behind the rate last
year, with cars running 7.4 percent behind last year's rate and
trucks off by 1.6 percent.
   Typically, April and May are among the hottest selling times in
the automobile industry, as Americans prepare for summer vacations
and weekend road trips.
   Sales through March of this year ran below expectations,
resulting in larger-than-anticipated inventories. The Big Three
offered incentive packages in early April that boosted cash
rebates, lowered finance rates and extended the deal to more models.
   The strategy appears to have worked somewhat.
   Combined April and May car and truck sales by the Big Three
automakers ran 0.7 percent ahead of vehicle sales during those two
months last year. This year's daily sales rate was 38,944 vehicles
in April and May, compared with a rate of 38,654 last year.
   But inventories remained swollen, and companies have been
temporarily idling plants to reduce them. Speculation has continued
that summer shutdowns, during which factories are retooled for next
year's models, may be longer than normal.
   Ford sustained the largest decline in car sales among the Big
Three in late May. Its cars sold at daily rate of 9,121 during,
down 8.4 percent from 9,956 last year. Light trucks made by Ford
sold at a rate 2 percent below last year.
   GM said late-May car sales were 16,400 a day this year, down 3.1
percent from the 16,927 rate during the period last year. Light
truck sales during the period fell 16.5 percent.
   Chrysler posted a modest 0.7 percent gain in car sales with a
daily rate of 4,439, compared with 4,407 last year. Chrysler's
late-May truck sales were up 0.3 percent.

   NWA Inc.'s board of directors rejected all
offers to buy the company Monday and invited suitors to revise
their bids, but the parent of Northwest Airlines indicated there
was no assurance it would get an offer it deemed acceptable.
   ``NWA Inc. has received a number of acquisition proposals in
response to its request for offers,'' the board said in a
statement. ``None of the proposals is acceptable in its present
form. Further, none of the proposals is sufficiently more
attractive than the others.''
   The statement said each of the bids is ``subject to unacceptable
material conditions,'' but did not elaborate. However, in letters
to bidders the company said interested buyers needed to address
concerns raised by federal regulators and the issue of compensating
NWA in the event it accepted an offer that later collapsed.
   NWA stock tumbled $2 to $106.75 a share in late trading on the
New York Stock Exchange following the company's announcement.
   The company declined to identify bidders who met last week's
deadline for submitting offers or to outline the proposals.
   Known bidders included oil billionaire Marvin Davis, who earlier
this year made a $2.7 billion buyout proposal; New York-based Pan
Am Corp., which has made a proposal valued at $3.3 billion;
Northwest's 20,000-member machinists' union; and an investment
group led by former hotel executive Alfred Checchi which includes
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and the Australian holding company Elders
IXL Ltd.
   A five-member committee of the NWA board reviewed offers from at
least four groups. The board said Monday that suitors had until
June 16 to submit revisions ``so as to enhance the attractiveness
of their proposals.''
   A letter to the bidders directed them to be specific about their
ability to finalize a deal in light of financing concerns and
scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Transportation, which regulates
the airline industry.
   Accepting a proposal that later might fall through would hurt
NWA, and in revising proposals the bidders should consider means of
compensating NWA for such damage, the letter said.
   ``There can be no assurance that a sale of NWA or any other
transaction will result from NWA's review of alternatives,'' the
letter said.
   Pan Am was the only bidder to disclose details of its financial
package, which could support a bid of $110 a share.
   The takeover firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. has been rumored
as a possible bidder but has declined comment.

<TEXT>
   Pilot fatigue and disorientation may have been
a factor in fatal crashes of two secret Stealth fighters in
California and Nevada, according to heavily censored Air Force
accident reports.
   The 1986 and 1987 crashes involved aircraft stationed at Nellis
Air Force Base north of Las Vegas.
   The reports, released by Nellis, indicate the pilots fought
fatigue brought on by a rigorous flight schedules, with many pilots
working 12- to 14-hour shifts.
   The secret jets flew only at night until Nov. 10, when the Air
Force acknowledged the existence of the radar-eluding jets and said
they would begin daytime operations.
   Fifty-two Stealth fighters are assigned to the 4450th Tactical
Fighter Group at Nellis, with the program operating out of the
Tonopah Test Range, 150 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   The reports suggest that disorientation resulting from the night
environment or certain aircraft features may have contributed to
the crashes. They did not specify the causes of the crashes but
outlined circumstances surrounding the accidents.
   The first crash occurred July 11, 1986, about 17 miles northeast
of Bakersfield, Calif., killing the pilot. The report indicates
there was no precrash fire or attempt by the pilot to eject and no
indication of mechanical failure.
   In a memo dated the day before the crash, Lt. Col. John Miller,
a squadron commander, wrote: ``I believe that these extended hours
are taking their toll on overall pilot performance. I have detected
more and more instances of poor judgment that weren't evident
two-three months ago.''
   The pilots flew A-7 aircraft for proficiency during the day,
then flew the Stealth flights at night.
   The second crash occurred Oct. 14, 1987, about 61 miles east of
Alamo, also killing the pilot. Again, there was no indication of a
precrash fire or of attempts to eject.
   There are only three known crashes of the Stealth jet. A crash
occurred when Lockheed Corp., the manufacturer, was testing the jet.
   In Washington on Monday, the Air Force announced the A-7 jets
assigned to the 4450th Tactical Group were being transferred to the
Air National Guard. The service said the 18 A-7's would be replaced
with eight AT-38 jets.
   The Air Force declined further comment. But one official who
would not be identified by name said the service could now increase
training in the stealth fighter itself since the end of strict
secrecy made possible daytime flights.
   The stealth fighter carries the military designation F-117A.

   Hanson PLC, which took over Smith Corona Corp.
in 1986, announced Monday it plans a public offering of up to 15.75
million shares of its subsidiary.
   Hanson, which said it had filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for approval of the offering, said it expected the
shares to sell between $23 and $25 each.
   The proceeds of the offering will go to Hanson, the company said
in a statement.
   If all of the 15.75 million shares are sold, Hanson will retain
approximately 46.3 percent of the stock in Smith Corona.
   Hanson acquired Smith Corona as part of its $930 million buyout
of SCM Corp. in early 1986.
   Smith Corona manufactures typewriters, word processors, office
supplies and other products. Hanson, whose U.S. arm is Hanson
Industries, is a London-based conglomerate that also owns Ground
Round restaurants, Kaiser Cement, Endicott Johnson shoes, Jacuzzi
Whirlpool Baths and Farberware cookware.
   Hanson said it expected the Smith Corona stock to be listed on
the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ``SCO.''

<HEAD>Hasbro Adopts Anti-takeover Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toy manufactuer Hasbro Inc. said Monday
it has adopted measures to stave off potentially hostile takeover
bids after rumors the company might become a target.
   The measures do not prohibit sale of the company, but
effectively give shareholders the right to buy Hasbro stock at a
discount in the event of a hostile takeover bid.
   The move follows the hospitalization of Hasbro Chairman Stephen
D. Hassenfeld, 47, for treatment of pneumonia, which has stirred
rumors the company might be sold if he does not return to work.
   Hasbro, which was the second most actively traded company on the
American Stock Exchange last week, closed Monday down 37.5 cents at
$21.25.
   The shareholder rights plan is ``intended to assure that
shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in connection with
any effort to gain control of the company without paying all
shareholders a premium value,'' Hasbro President Alan G. Hassenfeld
said in a statement.
   The plan, approved by the company's board, ``meet the board's
desire to provide protection against abusive takeover tactics such
as partial tender offers and open market purchases,'' he said.
   Under the plan, Hasbro shareholders of record June 15 will get
one preference share for each common share they now hold.
   If a person or group buys or annouces a tender offer to buy 20
percent or more of Hasbro common stock, preference shares will
allow Hasbro stockholders to buy more stock at a low price.
   Hasbro directors may buy back the rights for one cent per share.
The rights expire June 30, 1999.
   The release said the plan contains exceptions for the Hassenfeld
family and related entities, but did not elaborate. The family
controls nearly 30 percent of Hasbro's common stock.
   The company also staggered terms for board of directors, which
helps prevent hostile parties from acquiring control of the board
at once.
   Stephen Hassenfeld was listed in stable condition Monday at
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York.

   Publisher Robert Maxwell suspended publication
of China's official English-language newspaper Monday in Europe,
saying he wouldn't honor the joint venture because of revulsion
over the massacre in Beijing.
   ``China's economic reforms have greatly improved the prospects
of prosperity for its people,'' the British newspaper magnate said
in a statement released in New York. ``But all that progress has
been disfigured and nullified by the events of last weekend.''
   Maxwell said ``it will be a standing disgrace to the name of
China that the guns of the People's Army should have been turned so
brutally upon the people themselves. Patience has always been one
of the greatest Chinese virtues. Patience was called for in
Beijing. Not bloody murder.''
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC has been publishing and
distributing the China Daily in Europe as part of an agreement with
the Chinese government, which began the English-language paper
several years ago to broaden foreign awareness of the economic
changes taking place in the country.
   ``It is impossible for friends of China to say and do nothing in
these circumstances,'' Maxwell said. ``For my part, I am suspending
immediately the publication of China Daily in Europe. I hope it
will not be long before I can resume, but that depends on a drastic
reversal of the course upon which the Chinese leadership has
embarked.''

   U.S. automakers have made headway in improving
the quality of their new cars this year but still lag behind
Japanese imports, according to a survey released Monday.
   The survey by J.D. Power and Associates showed the number of
problems reported during the first 90 days of vehicle ownership
fell for domestic and imported makers, indicating the industry was
doing a better job at improving quality.
   According to the survey, owners of domestic cars reported 163
problems per 100 vehicles this year, down from 177 in a similar
survey last year. Owners of Japanese vehicles reported 119 problems
per 100 this year, compared with 144 last year.
   The survey showed the Nissan Maxima had the fewest problems per
100 vehicles sold, with 83. It was followed by the Buick LeSabre
and the Toyota Corolla, both with 89, the Ford Crown Victoria at 91
and the Mercedes-Benz S-class at 93.
   On a nameplate-by-nameplate basis, the Mercedes-Benz had the
fewest problems with 103 per 100 vehicles, followed by Porsche at
106, Nissan at 111, Honda at 112 and Toyota at 117.
   European imports showed the largest number of problems for every
100 vehicles sold, at 204 this year, compared with 258 during the
1988 survey.

   Economists said major banks' reduction of their
prime interest rates by a half-point to 11 percent did not
necessarily signal a full-scale plunge in interest rates for the
near future.
   Experts said Monday's cut in the prime was more an attempt by
the banks to attract business than an indication they expect the
Federal Reserve to push market rates sharply lower to forestall an
economic recession.
   The prime is a benchmark used to set interest rates on a variety
of bank credit ranging from corporate loans to adjustable home
mortgages.

<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods on Monday extended its
tender offer for all outstanding shares of poultry rival Holly
Farms Corp. of Memphis, Tenn., until noon Friday.
   Tyson's $63.50-a-share cash tender offer will stand until 4 p.m.
CDT Friday, the company said in a news release.
   The Arkansas-based poultry giant said it had received tenders of
about 900,000 shares of Holly Farms stock as of June 2.
   Tyson is locked in a battle with another rival, ConAgra Corp. of
Omaha, Neb., for control of Holly Farms. Holly Farms stockholders
have rejected one merger agreement with ConAgra, but a vote has yet
to be taken on a second offer by ConAgra.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Enjoins Federal Reserve in its Claims Against MCorp</HEAD>

   A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction
Monday to keep MCorp's bankruptcy case in the courts and out of
regulators' control, a decision analysts said will benefit holders
of more than $400 million of the bank holding company's debt.
   U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes forbid the Federal Reserve
System, which regulates bank holding companies, from using its
authority to ``effect, directly or indirectly, a reorganization of
the MCorp group or its components or to interfere, except through
participation in the bankruptcy proceedings, with the restructuring
being developed in the bankruptcy proceeding.''
   The order sides with MCorp, which has been fighting Fed efforts
to make it use an estimated $400 million in assets to prop up its
weak subsidiary banks.
   The Fed has maintained that bank holding companies should be a
``source of strength'' for their member banks. If a holding company
files for bankruptcy protection, the Fed says, the need to provide
capital for a subsidiary bank should take precedent over the
obligation to pay off creditors.
   MCorp was Texas' second-largest bank holding company until
regulators seized 20 of the 25 MBanks in March, combining them
under one bank which has been operating since as Deposit Insurance
Bridge Bank, with $15.4 billion in assets and $11.6 billion in
deposits.
   MCorp, which retained five banks and a trust operation,
subsequently filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code.
   In his order Monday, Hughes said the ``waste and confusion
attendant upon parallel bankruptcy and administrative proceedings''
increases costs and conflict and protects no interests that could
not be addressed solely in the bankruptcy proceeding.
   ``From our reading of the order we're pleased,'' MCorp said.
   Don Dorsey, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas,
said he was aware of the ruling but declined to comment.
   Robert Rieke, a banking analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes
Inc. in Dallas, said the decision leaves the reorganization plan in
MCorp's hands.
   ``If (the Fed) had been successful on this issue, it would have
pushed some of the questions about MCorp into an administrative
forum,'' Rieke said.
   Rieke said bondholders should feel gratified that the court
retains jurisdiction over the reorganization of the company.

<HEAD>Congress, White House Steer Clear Of Using Food As Retaliation Against
China</HEAD>

   Both Congress and the White House are
expressing outrage at the violence in China, but neither is
suggesting that the millions of tons of U.S. commodities sold to
that country each year be stopped.
   ``I don't believe in using food as a weapon,'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said
Monday. ``With all that the Chinese people are suffering, we should
not deprive them of food as well.
   ``However, the Chinese government must not use our food as a
weapon against its own people. I know the world community would
object to any attempt of the Chinese government to restrict the
flow of food to its people.''
   The Agriculture Department announced Monday that China has
bought another 1.8 metric tons of soft red winter wheat from U.S.
farmers, according to exporters. That makes 2.65 million metric
tons of the commodity bought for delivery in the marketing year
that began June 1.
   Most of it has been purchased in the last two weeks, according
to the Agriculture Department.
   During the marketing year that ended May 31, exporters sold 8.3
million metric tons of U.S. grain to China.
   China also buys poultry to breed, livestock semen, hogs and seed
to plant for animal feed, according to the Agriculture Department's
foreign agricultural service.
   By far, the largest commodity is grain, said a spokeswoman in
the department. China gets other products from Canada, Australia,
New Zealand and Europe, she said.
   Since former President Carter's grain embargo against the Soviet
Union for the invasion of Afghanistan caused controversy, the
federal government has opposed using agricultural products as
foreign policy weapons. But that doesn't mean it won't refuse to
extend the Export Enhancement Program to China.
   The first 300,000 metric tons of wheat purchased this year by
China were under that discount program, but all the rest has been
bought at market prices.
   ``We must be absolutely clear that China's brutality against its
own people is unacceptable,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
ranking Republican on the Agriculture Committee.
   ``At the same time, it's important that U.S. actions be moderate
and targeted against the government rather than the people of
China.''
   President Bush said Monday that weapons sales would be suspended
and ``other aspects of bilateral relationship'' would be reviewed.
   ``On the commercial side, I don't want to hurt the Chinese
people,'' Bush said during a news conference. ``I happen to believe
that commercial contacts have led, in essence, to this quest for
more freedom.''
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, said the United States should be committed
never to use food embargoes as a weapon because they ``are
ineffective and hurt both sides.''
   ``Food embargoes are never the answer, and particularly in this
case it could worsen the pain and suffering of the Chinese
people,'' he said.

<HEAD>Louisiana Insurance Company Declared Insolvent</HEAD>

   Champion Insurance Co., the
fourth-largest auto insurer in Louisiana, was declared insolvent
Monday and was placed under control of Louisiana Insurance
Commissioner Doug Green.
   Officials said policyholders will remain covered by the
Louisiana Guaranty Association, a group of insurance firms that
handles unpaid claims by any company that fails.
   District Judge Joseph Keogh signed the order placing the company
under state control at about the same time employees left work at
Champion's Baton Rouge headquarters, saying they had been told the
company was closing and that they were not to return.
   Keogh's order declared Champion insolvent and said the insurance
commission is to liquidate the company.
   Keogh acted shortly after Green took the matter to court. Green
was under pressure from the governor and attorney general to
investigate the company, which has been linked to him in ethics
investigations.
   In his petition, Green said Champion may not have the money to
pay claims in Louisiana. For months, the insurance commissioner has
said Champion was financially sound.
   The company, which recently gave up its license to operate in
Alabama, sold slightly less than $1 million a week in premiums in
Louisiana, officials said. In the two states, the company had
324,000 customers, mostly in high-risk policies. Champion also
writes policies in Tennessee.
   Louisiana has at least 1,300 complaints on file from Champion
policyholders who said they had trouble getting claims paid. More
than 7,000 suits have been filed against the company in the state.
   Green's office said Champion has refused to pay or has delayed
payment of fees for attorneys hired by the company to defend suits
involving policyholders.
   Green has been under fire from Gov. Buddy Roemer and Attorney
General William Guste, who have accused him of being too closely
tied with the owners of Champion. A lawsuit alleges that a
Champion-related company illegally bankrolled Green's campaign.
   Green could not be reached immediately for comment.
   The insurance department in Alabama filed a complaint against
the company in March, seeking to revoke its license to do business.
That state claimed Champion was in unsound financial condition.
Champion subsequently gave up its license to do business in Alabama.

<HEAD>Dollar Jumps, Share Prices Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. dollar opened sharply higher against the
Japanese yen Tuesday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange plunged.
   The dollar started at 142.50 yen, a sharp 1.85-yen gain from
Monday's close of 140.65 yen.
   A trader with the Bank of Tokyo attributed the dollar's higher
opening in Tokyo to its overnight upswing in New York, where
investors bought the currency following a federal reserve bank
selling operation conducted to increase the amount of money in the
market by selling bonds, without manipulating the discount rate.
   ``Investors took the action as indicating the Feds would not
ease the monetary policy by lowering the federal fund rate,
although it was expected, and began buying the dollar,'' the trader
said.
   Japanese investors followed the trend on Wall Street and also
bought the U.S. currency, he said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
210.34 points Monday, quickly lost 209.93 points, or 0.63 percent,
to fall further to 33,255.15 points within the first 15 minutes of
morning trading.
   Dealers said the Nikkei declined after a 37.16-point loss in the
Dow Jones industrial average in New York overnight.
   The yen's decline against the dollar on the foreign exchange and
the deteriorating student-military dispute in China also
discouraged trading, said a dealer with a major securities firm in
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>California Insurance Department Begins Rollback Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELISABETH DUNHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators are sifting through thousands of
financial documents to decide which insurers may be exempt from
rate rollbacks approved by California voters, Insurance
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Monday.
   If the 850 boxes filled with exemption applications from
insurers doing business in California are any indication, it could
be some time before policyholders see a change in their insurance
bills.
   ``Our intent is to have them all out of here by November,''
Gillespie said. ``Some people will do what we tell them, others
will appeal and go to court. It will depend upon the extent
litigation ensues from our decision.''
   In May, the state Supreme Court upheld most of Proposition 103 _
the insurance rate-reduction ballot measure approved by voters last
November _ setting the stage for the Insurance Department to decide
how the law is enforced.
   Insurers will be allowed to increase rates without prior state
approval until November. However, any amount that the insurance
commissioner rules to be excessive, when measured against a
standard of a ``fair rate of return,'' will have to be refunded to
customers, with interest.
   Gillespie predicted few insurers will raise their rates during
the next six months.
   She spoke to reporters at a news conference at the new rate
rollback office, where about 35 financial examiners will look at
thousands of documents submitted by insurers. Another 35 examiners
will work at an office in Los Angeles.
   Many companies may have gone overboard in submitting documents
in order to play it safe, turning in dozens of boxes, Gillespie
said.
   Most of the more than 700 insurers doing business in California
have filed for some kind exemption, she said.
   While all types of insurance may be subject to rollbacks under
the new law, much of the attention has focused on auto insurance.
   Under the measure, people with clean driving records will be
entitled to a 20 percent rate discount starting in November.
