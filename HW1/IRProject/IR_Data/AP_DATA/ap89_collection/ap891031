   Playfully and masterfully, Julia Child seduced
America into the kitchen in the 1960s. Now, finally, she is back,
seasoned oh so slightly by the health fanatics but as spicy and
devoted to the joys of the table as ever.
   To much of America, she is the French chef they know and love,
trilling ``bon appetit'' at the close of her landmark TV cooking
lessons and willing to be a little like us by occasionally dropping
a piece of chicken live on television and putting it back in the
pan.
   ``Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' in two volumes, became
mandatory for serious cooks. And Julia Child became etched in our
culture, her voice, her 6-foot-2 frame and her funny, charming
presence. Even non-cooks know Dan Aykroyd's parody on ``Saturday
Night Live'' (she found it ``terribly funny'').
   Now, at 77, she has published her seventh _ and, she says, last
_ book, with the no-nonsense title ``The Way to Cook'' and a
no-nonsense price of $50. With more than 800 recipes in 511 pages,
it weighs in at a very serious 5{ pounds. It is the first cookbook
chosen as a main selection by Book of the Month Club.
   ``I felt it was time for a new book and a new look,'' she said
in a recent interview. ```Mastering' was very classical French, no
deviating at all.''
   ``The Way'' deviates, blending classic technique with free-style
American cooking.
   Aimed at a generation for whom cooking may mean ``Lean Cuisine''
in the microwave, ``The Way to Cook'' includes such things as
Chinese manicotti, which she calls an ``Italo-Sino conversation
piece and unusually good eating.''
   But this is by no means a new world of food. While there are
plenty of low-fat recipes, there's no shortage of butter or cream.
   Or the egg, ``that perfect, pristine, primal object. We may not
gobble it up as profusely now as we used to, but every mouthful
should be memorable.''
   And that is the essence of her attitude toward the fervor over
healthy eating. Give up nothing. Eat with pleasure but in
moderation.
   She bemoans the loss of ``those happy days in the '60s when
everyone ate butter and cream. ... Oh, they were lovely days.''
   Child says she has had to watch her weight for the last 35 years.
   ``I am very careful about my fat content and calories and eat
much smaller portions. I am conscious of not wanting to be a Mrs.
6-by-6.''
   But that does not mean a lack of good food or good company.
   ``The main thing is getting people together,'' said Child, who
first learned to cook so she could feed her husband. ``I get very
depressed when I don't eat well _ and that doesn't mean fancy.''
   Americans' approach to food these days has her worried.
   ``What's dangerous and discouraging about this era is that
people really are afraid of their food. Sitting down to dinner is a
trap, not something to enjoy. People should take their food more
seriously. Learn what you can eat and enjoy it thoroughly.''
   In a discussion of the nutrients in vegetables, she writes of
``nervous nutritional nellies,'' who boil sprouts or green beans in
a small covered pan rather than lots of water. The results, she
writes, are ``invariably unappetizing, inedible and a dull
gray-green. One reason, I am sure, that many people hate vegetables
is because they're cooked like medicine. But fresh vegetables are
glorious food.''
   Child is foremost a teacher, though she says she would have been
happy as a butcher and is proud of her puff pastry method and of
the work she's done with poultry and bread.
   In ``The Way to Cook,'' published this month by Alfred A. Knopf,
Child teaches. The book is demanding but accessible, without
recipes like the daunting 13 pages for French bread in the second
volume of ``Mastering.''
   The color photographs show the food as the cook sees it and
there are plenty of them. Nine, for example, show step-by-step how
to truss a chicken, and nine take the cook from a pile of butter
and flour to puff pastry.
   ``It's really sort of a distillation of her whole career,'' said
Peter Kump of Kump's New York Cooking School. ``She's expressing
herself more clearly, more ably, in a way that I think is just
superlative.''
   And like a great teacher, Child anticipates questions. When she
suggests creaming butter with a wooden spoon, she adds: ``You can
use a hand-held mixer, but it's such a nuisance to scrape the
butter out of the blades!''
   Recipes are grouped unconventionally by technique, so, for
example, pork and veal chops are together rather than pork chops
and pork roast. The croutons for fish soups are with the soups, not
the breads. There are master recipes and then variations.
   ``I want to encourage them to think of their own ways,'' Child
said, and while she has little patience for fads (``It's as though
people didn't dare do anything traditional.''), the master recipe
method allows for adding the trendy ingredient de jour.
   Modern appliances, like the food processor, are used, but Child
has not been won over to the microwave oven, which she uses for
defrosting, rewarming or starting dishes, but leaves her too little
control over actual cooking.
   She does, however, suggest using a blowtorch. A blowtorch?
   ``A blowtorch is not just for laughs _ it is a legitimate
kitchen tool, and marvelous for loosening aspics from their
molds.'' She even suggests what kind to buy.

   And who but Julia Child could get away with explaining yeast
dough in terms of burps: ``The main ingredients of flour are starch
and gluten. It's the starch in the dough that feeds upon the yeast,
belching forth gas that pushes up the gluten.''
   Child nurtures you through bread-baking, explaining how yeast
works, what flour to buy, what kneading is all about. Photographs
make it clear just how the dough should look along the way.
   And how can anyone resist trying a souffle when she writes:
   ``The souffle is undoubtedly the egg at its most magnificent,
the egg in all its puffing power. How impressive is the chocolate
or cheese souffle, its head rising dramatically out of its dish,
and swaying ever so slightly as it is borne to the table.''
   In a bow to health, she includes ``cream'' soups made with
pureed rice. But she also suggests adding heavy or sour cream ``if
you like.'' She also offers a fat-free ``heaven-sent'' poached
chicken and recommends a cast-iron grill to cook meat without fat.
   But she writes: ``I, for one, would rather swoon over a few thin
slices of prime beefsteak, or one small serving of chocolate
mousee, or a sliver of foie gras than indulge to the full on such
nonentities as fat-free gelatin puddings.''
   Child grew up in Pasadena, Calif., in a home with a hired cook,
and did not take a cooking lesson until she was in her 30s.
   She graduated from Smith College in 1934 and after writing
advertising copy for a short time, joined the Office of Strategic
Services, the forerunner of the CIA. She was sent off as a clerk to
Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where she met Paul Child, a career diplomat
10 years her senior, in 1943.
   They married in 1946 and remain very close; she often talks in
terms of ``we.'' He recently moved to a nursing home near their
Cambridge, Mass., home. They have no children.
   ``They just never came,'' she said matter-of-factly. ``I would
be very happy to be a grandmother at this point.'' But in addition
to her book, Child is busy these days working to improve the status
of food professionals through the American Institute of Wine and
Food, which she co-founded, and the James Beard Foundation in New
York.
   Two years after their marriage, the Childs were sent to Paris,
where she enrolled at the Cordon Bleu cooking school. She was
considered a bit odd by her friends, who all had hired help in the
kitchen.
   ``I'd been looking for my life's work all along. And when I got
into cooking I found it. I was inspired by the tremendous
seriousness with which they took it.''
   In France she also met Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, who
needed an American collaborator for the first volume of ``Mastering
the Art of French Cooking.'' Nine years in the making, it was
published in 1961 with a foreword that began: ``This is a book for
the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion
with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children's meals, the
parent-chauffeur-den mother syndrome, or anything else which might
interfere with the enjoyment of producing something wonderful to
eat.''
   And it ends: ``Above all, have a good time.''
   Two years later, when Child was 51, WGBH in Boston launched
``The French Chef'' series, and for 206 meals, she entertained and
cajoled and encouraged viewers to do as she did.
   ``I happened to be the right woman at the right time,'' she said
with modesty, noting that John F. Kennedy had a French chef at the
White House and more Americans were traveling abroad.
   ``Suddenly people began considering food with a capital `F'.''
   Besides, she was fun to watch, perhaps partly because of the
on-air disasters, the first of which occurred with an apple
charlotte.
   ``As I was looking, it did a slow collapse. You could hear the
tears in my voice.'' To cover, she told viewers: ``You don't want
it too stiff.''
   But the mistakes taught viewers how to make repairs, and made
her more familiar.
   And since it's the good company that counts, her advice to
others who make mistakes: ``Don't apologize ever. It's very bad to
apologize because people will say, `That wasn't very good, was it?'

<DATELINE>KATYN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerzy Rudzinski took one look at the
Soviet memorial at Katyn dedicated ``To victims of Fascism _ Polish
officers shot by the Nazis in 1941.''
   Then, the 53-year-old sculptor turned away bitterly, quickly
climbed 15 feet up a pine tree, and nailed in a small wooden plaque
inscribed with his father's name and true date of death: 1940.
   Uniformed and plainclothes Soviet police watched him from afar
but did nothing.
   Rudzinski, one of the relatives of the 4,300 murdered Polish
officers whose deaths in this Russian forest have been wrapped in
mystery and lies for more than 45 years, was part of the largest
group of Poles ever allowed to go to Katyn.
   For the first time, the family members were able to mourn them
in the secluded wood where, according to the weight of historical
evidence, the young officers _ the elite of their generation _ were
shot in the back of the head and stacked into mass graves by the
Soviet secret police, known then as the NKVD.
   More than 15,000 Polish officers deported to three camps in the
Soviet Union in 1939 after the outbreak of World War II were never
heard from again after the spring of 1940. The Katyn bodies were
found by the Germans in 1943. Traces of the 11,000 other men have
never been located.
   Relatives of the victims accounted for most of the 468 Poles who
boarded a special train organized by a Polish state tourist agency
for a chance to spend several hours in the forest Monday.
   ``Poles don't want those graves to be anonymous because we know
the names,'' Rudzinski said. ``These are not unknown soldiers, but
the Russians don't allow us to personify the deaths.
   ``I wanted to climb the tree, to put up a symbol high so that
they wouldn't be able to take it down so easily,'' he said.
   Seeing Rudzinski, Iwona Mlokosiewicz hurried over and asked him
also to nail in a brass plaque for her father that she knows only
from old photographs.
   ``My mother received one card. She was pregnant when my father
left so he probably didn't even know I was born when he died,''
said Mlokosiewicz, holding a bag of dirt from the forest for her
77-year-old mother, who couldn't make the trip.
   Other visitors also scooped dirt and small trees to take home.
   The Soviet Union maintains the men were murdered by the Nazis in
1941. Most Poles and Western historians, based on an International
Red Cross investigation and other inquiries, have long concluded
the Soviet secret police committed the crime in April or May of
1940.
   With Poland in the Soviet orbit after World War II, it was
impossible to speak openly in Poland about Soviet responsibility
until the 1980s, when the birth of Solidarity ushered in a period
of openness.
   Even so, it was not until this year that the Polish side of a
joint Polish-Soviet historical commission set up in 1987 by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski conceded there is no reasonable doubt the Soviets were
responsible.
   Katyn remains an emotional wound for Poles, an obstacle to
reconciliation and a major source of Polish mistrust of the Soviets.
   Many in the group became irritable when the train was late and
the guides told them to stay in the train at Smolensk until they
boarded the buses for Katyn, about 17 miles away. The presence of a
police car that led the buses also upset them. Tension built when
someone saw a statue of Josef Stalin along the route.
   ``We are very nervous. It is our first time here. For the past
50 years my mother promised that before she died she would lay
flowers for her brother at Katyn,'' said Jozef Skotnicki, a zoo
director who accompanied his 82-year-old mother and an aunt.
   Once there, the Poles walked to the memorial, a 45-foot-long,
chest-high polished stone wall set in a grove of pine and birch
trees.
   A Solidarity sticker quickly was used to fasten a piece of paper
with the letters NKVD on it over the word ``Nazi'' on the monument.
   Tears streaming down her face, one woman stood motionless behind
the monument holding a candle in the shape of ``1940'' with a
lighted wick on each numeral.
   Hundreds of other candles were lighted, dozens of wreaths laid,
a Polish flag planted in the damp soil and a table set up for a
Mass in front of a wooden cross. At least one man broke down and
was carried to an ambulance brought to cope with those overcome
with emotion.
   There was one Soviet broadcaster present who had mixed results
trying to conduct interviews in Russian.
   ``Go away!'' one Pole told him.
   ``It's high time this thing is regulated by our countries and
you can start by saying this deed was done by the NKVD,'' another
said.
   Many said they hope the Soviets will acknowledge the NKVD's
guilt by the time Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki visits
Moscow on Nov. 23.
   ``The fate of every lie is that sooner or later it will be
revealed,'' Rudzinski said.
   Last week in Warsaw, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union was committed to establishing
the truth. But a Soviet admission of responsibility could lead to
compensation claims and even homicide trials for those still alive
who may have taken part in the massacre.
   For now, Poles intend to take advantage of the new opportunities
to travel to the site since Gorbachev assumed power.
   ``It seems to me that this will become a traditional place of
pilgrimage,'' said Maria Kowalska, who came on her own in the
spring and served as a guide this time for another chance to pay
tribute to her father, who lies somewhere in the forest.

   Parking a pickup truck in the driveway is against
the law in swanky Flossmoor, and a resident truck owner unhappy
with the restriction is making a federal case out of it.
   Supporters of the ordinance, which banishes pickups to owners'
garages, say the trucks are unsightly and don't belong out in plain
sight in their upper-class south Chicago suburb.
   Jim Minx contends the village is snobby and its ordinance
unconstitutional.
   ``If I pay taxes on my property, why can I not park my truck in
my driveway?'' asks Minx, whose lawsuit seeking to overturn the law
is pending in U.S. District Court.
   ``It's just that they say that it creates a slum environment and
gives the village a blue-collar image,'' Minx said Tuesday in a
telephone interview.
   Some folks don't have garages, he noted. He does, but there
isn't room in it for his black Mazda pickup.
   ``People have been told ... `Either sell your truck, sell your
home, or park your truck outside town and walk back to your
house,'' said Minx, a 30-year-old state law-enforcement officer who
moved to Flossmoor a year ago.
   ``We feel it's a violation of civil rights,'' said Minx, whose
Truck Owners Rights Association has 35 resident members.
   The lawsuit, filed in March, argues that Minx's constitutional
right to use his own property is being violated, according to
Richard Hutchison, Minx's attorney. A judge is expected to rule
Nov. 20 on the village's contention that the matter should really
be decided in state courts, Hutchison said.
   At issue is a zoning ordinance in the largely residential
village of 8,500 that says residents who own pickups must park them
in the garage at all times, not in the driveway or in front of
their homes.
   Plumbers and other tradespeople may park commercial pickups
temporarily in driveways of homes where they are working, but may
not leave the same vehicles in their own driveways.
   Offenders are ticketed $10 for each violation, and Minx says he
owes $200 in fines on his truck.
   The ordinance is an amended version _ thanks largely to the
efforts of Minx and 165 supporters who signed his petition _ of a
decades-old measure that said residents couldn't even keep trucks
in their garages.
   Richard Rosenthal, a commercial land broker, vehemently supports
the original law. He photographs offending trucks and reports them
to the police department, said Minx, who calls Rosenthal a snob.
   ``I don't care what he thinks, but don't come to my community
and try to debase it with his damn truck,'' said Rosenthal, 58.
   ``I've lived in Flossmoor 32 years. I moved to the community
because it was beautiful, quiet, upper-class. ... And I've seen it
weakened by so-called liberal attitudes,'' he said.
   ``If they want a pickup truck and there's an ordinance in the
village that says you cannot have one on your property, then go
live somewhere else,'' Rosenthal said.
   The ordinance, amended by village trustees in May, is aimed at
banishing unsightly commercial vehicles from village streets, said
Mayor Frank Maher.
   ``We're trying to retain the integrity of the neighborhood,'' he
said. ``It's not a matter of being snobbish.''
   But what about Minx's argument that his truck is his only means
of transportation, and not a commercial vehicle?
   ``That's a real difficult point to define,'' Maher said.
   ``If a guy's in the cement business, and he's got three
wheelbarrows in the back of his pickup ... (but) uses it primarily
for transportation,'' the village still doesn't want it parked out
in the open, the mayor said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``other'' demonstration in
Prague last week was staged by the Society for Happier Present
Times, a merry crew of a few dozen Czechs whose past exploits
include floating an artificial whale on the Vltava river and
staging a ``run for political prisoners.''
   Their cause this time was as dear to Czechoslovaks as the
democracy desired by the 10,000 who marched through Prague streets
on Saturday.
   With a frivolous display, they wanted to voice the popular anger
over the new 100-crown ($10) note, a garish green bill which bears
a portrait of Klement Gottwald, the first Communist president.
   In the best Czech tradition of getting even by poking fun, this
note is the butt of the latest pranks in Prague.
   Some wit figured out that if you folded the note a certain way,
Klement Gottwald looks just like Steven Spielberg's E.T.
   Another bill seen in recent days had a small swastika etched on
Gottwald's forehead.

   The many foreigners staying in beautiful ``zlata Praha,'' or
``golden Prague,'' last weekend included Western correspondents the
Communist authorities blamed for Saturday's protest.
   Others were foreign ``provocateurs'' among the 355 detained when
hundreds of helmeted riot police swarmed through the picturesque
streets to break up the march.
   A third group was the scores of Western travel agents in the
golden city for a congress intended to boost the official drive for
more hard currency tourism.
   Some of these visitors were astonished on Saturday afternoon
when white-helmeted riot police swinging batons ran into hotel
lobbies, pursuing an American and a West German camera crew filming
the violent end to the demonstration.
   Outside, a banner fluttered, proclaiming ``Welcome to The
Congress Delegates.''

   While Westerners see Czechoslovakia as the odd man out in an
eastern Europe bubbling with revolutionary change, the needy
comrade citizens of neighboring East bloc nations know the place as
a consumer paradise.
   Bulgarians, their many bags bursting with Czechoslovak plenty,
block the path to customs at Prague airport. On almost any day,
hundreds of Poles can be seen selling an assortment of goods on the
black market. They spend the cash at well-stocked food stores
before returning to Poland.
   Czechoslovakia's government, which knows that its relative
consumer plenty cannot be maintained forever in a stagnating
economy, fired the first shot last fall in an East bloc ``customs
war'' designed to halt this foreign plundering of the shops.
   Restrictions were imposed on the export of everything from tea
to mopeds.
   It worked _ but evidently not well enough. So, last week, the
Communists took more steps to protect their consumers. A vast list
was issued of things that could now be exported only with express
permission.
   Some of the items catching the attention of the customs
officials baffled even those Czechs accustomed to daily mangling of
their language by bureaucrats. What, they pondered, is a ``juice
meter''? And why would anybody need or seek permission to export
one?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The weight of bureaucracy last week fell on Eva Stolbova, a
literature teacher who also is a member of the Democratic
Initiative, one of the more flourishing independent groups
beginning to bud in Czechoslovakia.
   Mrs. Stolbova was summoned to Bartolomeska for a meeting with
the secret police.
   She later recounted some details of the session. Like other
dissidents, she found that much police interest focuses these days
on Vaclav Havel, the banned playwright and a prominent government
critic.
   Havel himself has reported that the authorities who have banned
his work for the last 20 years now seem anxious to rehabilitate him
as a writer, if he will just stop his political activity.
   As Mrs. Stolbova recounted her chat with police, segments of
Havel's 1960s play ``The Garden Party'' made their first
reappearance on an official Prague stage in 20 years, along with
songs by the banned folksinger-heroine of the ``Prague Spring,''
Marta Kubisova, and writings by emigre authors Milan Kundera and
Josef Skvorecky.
   The censors were not amused. Having permitted the performance,
they then demanded so many changes that the actors refused to go on
stage.
   Unlucky ticket holders turned back from the theater joined glum,
bruised demonstrators on Prague's streets Saturday night.
   But most Czechs seemed to be having a much jollier time, whiling
away the weekend in their country cottages or savoring beer and the
latest witticism in smoke-filled pubs.
   On Wenceslas Square, where police sirens had wailed hours
before, discos blared electronic rhythm into the street. Other
teen-agers, true to bourgeois traditions that have survived decades
of Communism, donned shiny suits and best dresses and took off to
demonstrate their dancing skills at the social season's first balls.

   A gunman wearing a yellow mask shot the son
of Philadelphia's imprisoned mob boss Tuesday night as he was
dining at an Italian restaurant, police said.
   Nicodemo Scarfo Jr., 24, was in stable condition late Tuesday at
Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, according to hospital
spokesman Steve Brown.
   Doctors determined that Scarfo was shot at least four times:
once in the neck and the left arm and in each side of his chest,
Brown said.
   Witnesses said a man wearing a yellow mask and black clothes
walked up to Scarfo in the bar of Dante and Luigi's restaurant in
south Philadelphia at 7:15 p.m. and shot him at least five times,
according to police.
   He was shot once in the right neck and at least once in each
side of his chest, police said.
   Officers said they found a semiautomatic gun outside the
restaurant.
   The gunman ``was like greased lightning,'' said Joseph Oberman,
who was dining in the restaurant's main room. ``He came in and out
of the door.
   ``After the shot, nobody moved,'' Oberman said.
   But another diner remembered the aftermath differently.
   ``The dining room was in chaos,'' said Fran Tosconi.
   At least two dozen men have died in the past eight years in the
struggle for control of the Philadelphia-area mob.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel Friedman of the Philadelphia
Strike Force speculated late Tuesday that Tuesday's shooting was
not part of a renewed mob war but a punishment to the elder Scarfo
for gangsters who've agreed to testify in the past several years.
   ``Many of the (other) important members and leaders of the La
Cosa Nostra are currently cooperating and testififying,'' Friedman
said. ``That could be deemed an embarrassing situation for Nicodemo
Scarfo as the leader.
   ``There would be many out there that would wish to punish Scarfo
for the lack of discipline within his family,'' he said.
   The elder Scarfo, known by the nickname of ``Little Nicky,'' has
been imprisoned since his indictment in 1986 in a $1 million
extortion attempt. He was convicted in the extortion attempt and
later on a murder charge. He is serving a 69-year sentence for
racketeering at the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill.
   Until his sentencing with 16 others last April, the elder Scarfo
was considered the leader of organized crime in the area.
   The 1980 slaying of mob boss Angelo Bruno triggered a struggle
for contorl of the Philadelphia-southern New Jersey mob in which at
least 24 men have been killed.
   The younger Scarfo has had several brushes with the law, but
none in connection with the mob.

<HEAD>Sullivan Declines to Make Fetal Tissue Decision, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.
Sullivan has declined to make the decision on whether to end a ban
on research using fetal tissue, The Washington Post said in
Wednesday editions.
   That puts the decision in the hands of an assistant secretary,
James O. Mason, an opponent of abortion who opposes such research.
   The newspaper did not say why Sullivan had declined to make the
decision and some officials said they had not been informed that it
would be Mason's issue to decide.
   Conservative supporters of the Bush administration have promised
a firestorm of protest if the administration lifts the ban.
   James Brown, spokesman for Mason, said he had not been informed
of a decision to give the issue to his boss.
   ``I know nothing of it,'' said press officer Campbell Gardett.
   A Sullivan, Robert Schmermund, would say only, ``The final
decision is under review.'' He declined further comment.
   Fetal tissue is believed by many scientists to offer important
advantages in research on Parkinson's Disease and other disorders.
   But Mason's predecessor as assistant secretary for health,
Robert Windom, last year forbade use of government funds to finance
such research and established a special advisory committee on
whether it should continue.
   Later last year, the committee recommended the ban be lifted.
   Sullivan had been expected to make the decision himself on
whether to accept the committee's recommendation and resume the use
of fetal tissue in research.

<HEAD>Book Published Of Those Hitler Would Have Executed Had Britain Been

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adolf Hitler's list of people to be executed in
the event of a successful invasion of Britain is now a book.
   The ``Black Book,'' discovered in 1945 after the defeat of
Germany in World War II, listed 2,820 top people to be wiped out,
including Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden, the
foreign minister.
   Some of the prominent Britons on the list gathered Tuesday at
London's Imperial War Museum, where one of two known copies of the
list is kept. The other is in the United States.
   The book gives the address of each target, as well as details of
trade unions and other organizations to be eradicated.
   One target, 92-year-old author Naomi Mitchison, said she went
and talked over her predicament with a fisherman when she
discovered from government contacts in 1940 that she was on a list
of people to be executed.
   ``He said I shouldn't worry because they would take me away to
America on a fishing boat, provided they could get the fuel,'' Mrs.
Mitchison said. ``I thought that a bit unlikely and dangerous at
the time but I was very upset.''
   Poet Sir Stephen Spender, 80, said: ``I felt honored to be in
it. Leonard Woolf, Virginia Woolf's husband, and I had a suicide
pact because it was obvious we would be on a hit list. We didn't
actually do anything more about it. It's a good job we won.''
   When novelist Rebecca West learned after the book's discovery
that she was on the list with Noel Coward, she wrote the playwright
saying: ``My dear, the people we should have been dead with!''
   One blunder is the inclusion of Sigmund Freud, who died in 1938.
Playwright Lord Willis, who is also on the death list, said: ``A
mistake like that disproves the German image of efficiency.''

   American and Soviet women have made gains in
the workplace but remain concentrated in lower-paying jobs as they
struggle to balance family and career, speakers at a U.S.-Soviet
conference said Tuesday.
   ``We really have differences in the status of women in our
societies, but all in all, I think we have more problems in common
than differences,'' said former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro.
   Ms. Ferraro, actress Marlo Thomas and a Soviet expert spoke on
women's issues at the Fifth General Chautauqua Conference on
U.S.-Soviet Relations.
   Ms. Thomas said American women once were relegated to keeping
house or holding low-paying jobs.
   ```Ah, those were the days,' sigh certain Americans,'' she said.
``Unfortunately some of them are in the Congress or the Capitol.''
   Soviet women comprise about 52 percent of the work force in that
country, said Alevtina V. Fedulova, first deputy chairman of the
Committee of Soviet Women, a non-governmental group of women's
councils.
   Women comprise 44 percent of the American work force, Ms.
Ferraro said.
   Mrs. Fedulova said many Soviet women make less than men because
they tend to hold jobs requiring less skill and, even in more
skilled professions, advance more slowly than men.
   ``Men get better wages because given ... the same educational
background men have a higher professional status,'' she said.
   Mrs. Fedulova said women have made strides in the fields of
medicine, education and electronics. Sixty-seven percent of the
Soviet's physicians are women, she said.
   On another subject, Mrs. Fedulova said access to sex education
and contraceptives must improve in the Soviet Union, where abortion
is the main means of birth control.
   ``The situation with contraceptives in the U.S.S.R is as bad as
the situation with computers ... that is very bad,'' said Fedulova.
``Contraceptives are not widely available.''
   Western experts have estimated the average Soviet woman has nine
abortions during her childbearing years.
   ``We have to educate people,'' Mrs. Fedulova said in an
interview through an interpreter. ``What we really need to make the
woman understand is the need to preserve her health, and at the
same time she should have the resources to do that.''
   ``Abortion is not a benefit to any woman because it is a blow to
her health,'' Mrs. Fedulova said. ``A woman should be taught to
avoid abortion.''
   About 200 Soviet delegates, including 20 Soviet journalists, are
attending the conference, which is sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh and Chautauqua Institution in western New York.
   In another conference session Tuesday, a Soviet scientist and
American official called for increased cooperation between the two
countries to fight global warming, depletion of the Earth's ozone
layer and other environmental problems.
   ``The world has no time left to solve these problems,'' said
Boris N. Laskorin, deputy director of the All-Union Scientific
Research Institute of Chemical Technology.
   Alan Hecht, deputy assistant administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency's Office of International Activities, said
improved relations between the two countries already has resulted
in joint projects.

   Milan Huebl, 62, who headed
Czechoslovakia's Communist Party Academy during the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms and later joined the independent human rights
group Charter 77, was found dead Saturday.
   The exact cause of his death was unknown.
   Huebl, a key ideologist of the communist-led reforms of
Alexander Dubcek that were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion, served
as director of the Communist Party Academy during that brief period.
   However, he was convicted in 1972 on charges of ``anti-state''
activities and sentenced to 6{ years in prison. He was released
early, in December 1976, with three other prominent activists.
   Huebl was one of the first people to sign the Charter 77
manifesto on human rights and more recently joined Obroda, a group
of former communists advocating reform.

   A former lieutenant governor was charged
Tuesday with violating the state's Campaign Finance Act by making
excessive contributions to Gov. Mike Hayden.
   Former Lt. Gov. David C. Owen, a former state senator and
longtime political aide of Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., was charged with
11 counts of exceeding campaign contribution limits by $26,500 and
making donations of $34,000 in the names of others.
   He also was charged by special prosecutors with four counts of
theft and one count each of criminal solicitation, conspiracy and
making a false writing.
   Owen said he found it ``appropriate that this witch hunt
culminated on Halloween,'' and charged the investigation was
politically motivated.
   He said he did not intentionally violate the law and pledged a
``vigorous defense'' to exonerate himself and ``establish the
motives of everyone involved in this investigation.''
   The charges stem from allegations by the Kansas Public
Disclosure Commission that Owen funneled money into Hayden's 1986
election campaign in excess of donation limits in effect at the
time.
   Also charged were John E. Palmer, an Overland Park businessman,
and Elliot M. Kaplan, a Kansas City, Mo., attorney. Palmer was
named in one count of conspiracy, while Kaplan was charged with one
count of theft and one count of conspiracy to commit theft.
   Three persons were named as unindicted co-conspirators and
granted immunity in exchange for their testimony, including Owen's
wife, Beverly.
   Owen ran unsuccessfully for governor of Kansas in 1982. He was a
national fund-raiser for Dole in his bid for the 1988 Republican
presidential nomination but media disclosures about Owen's
involvement in the Hayden contribution case and Owen's business
dealings prompted him to resign from the Dole campaign in January
1988.
   In their report, special prosecutors Michael Barbara and Thomas
Haney said they had not attempted to determine what knowledge
Hayden had of the allegedly illegal donations.
   Hayden issued a statement saying the report exonerated him and
his staff.
   All 18 felony and misdemeanor counts were filed against him in
Johnson County District Court in Olathe.

   Four people shouting ``burn, baby, burn'' set
fire Monday to three American flags on the steps of the U.S.
Capitol in an attempt to force a court test on the
constitutionality of a new law banning flag desecration.
   ``We defy your law,'' said spokeswoman Nancy Kent.
   ``We challenge you. Arrest us. Test your statute. Take it back
to the Supreme Court and try once again to claim it is all
consistent with your constitutional standards of free speech.''
   One of those arrested was Gregory ``Joey'' Johnson, whose 1984
arrest for burning a flag at the Republican National Convention in
Dallas set in motion the court case that led to the new law.
   Another was Scott Tyler, 24, who stirred controversy in Chicago
earlier this year by placing a flag on the floor as part of a
student exhibit at the School of the Art Institute.
   Capitol police charged Johnson, 33, of Richmond, Ind., Tyler and
two others with violating the Flag Protection Act of 1989,
demonstrating without a permit and disorderly conduct, said police
spokesman Dan Nichols.
   The other two were identified as Shawn Eichner, 24, of New York
City, and David Blalock, 39, of Johnstown, Pa.
   Coincidentally, the 1984 flag burning charge against Johnson was
officially dismissed on Monday by Dallas County Criminal Judge John
Hendrik, who acted after receiving the official order from the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ordering him to do so.
   The demonstration came two days after members of a radical
Vietnam veterans' group in Seattle, Wash., burned a full-size
American flag and 1,000 paper flags to protest the law.
   President Bush, who favors a constitutional amendment to protect
the flag, allowed the measure to become law without his signature.
It went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
   It provides punishment of up to one year in jail and a $1,000
fine for anyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically
defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon
any flag of the United States.''
   The Supreme Court sparked the controversy earlier this year by
declaring an existing law aimed at protecting the flag to be an
unconstitutional intrusion on free speech. Johnson had been
convicted under that law.
   Flags were burned in several cities shortly after the new law
went into effect. U.S. Attorney Mike McKay said in Seattle that the
FBI is investigating the flag burning there to determine if a
criminal complaint is warranted.
   Monday's flag-burning had been scheduled for in front of the
Supreme Court, but organizers led photographers and television
cameras to the Capitol steps.
   One demonstrator produced a flag and ripped it in two. Two
police officers struggled with him and tore the pieces of the
banner from his hands.
   Behind them, another man produced a flag and set it afire.
   Two other flags also were set ablaze, crumbling into bits of
charred cloth as the four demonstrators chanted: ``Burn, baby,
burn. Burn, baby, burn.''
   ``One shouted: ``Stop the fascist flag law. Oppose it.''
   ``I'm a Vietnam veteran and I am burning this flag,'' said
another. ``We saw what this country is.''
   Police tried to extinguish the flames by stamping on the flags,
then aimed fire extinguishers at the burning remnants, dousing them
in a chemical stream and shrouding the scene in white smoke.
   ``This law enshrines the American flag as a sacred symbol above
criticism,'' Miss Kent read from a prepared statement. ``We refuse
to be silent in the face of such an attempt by the government to
dictate the bounds of speech, protest and artistic expression.''
   David Cole, a staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional
Rights who has represented Johnson, said the ``new statute is just
as unconstitutional as the old law.''

<TEXT>
   High school students on Molokai Island
wept and prayed Monday for classmates and educators who were among
20 people killed in Hawaii's worst commuter airplane crash.
   A National Transportation Safety Board team arrived Monday to
investigate Aloha IslandAir Flight 1712, which slammed into a ridge
near Halawa Valley on the island's eastern end Saturday night en
route from neighboring Maui. There were no survivors.
   Rescuers recovered 20 bodies Sunday from the charred wreckage of
the DH6 Twin Otter.
   The victims included eight members of Molokai High School's
volleyball teams, the coach of the girl's team and the school's
athletic director. Three other island residents also were killed.
   The crash stunned Molokai, a rural island with 6,000 residents.
Many drivers attached green and white streamers to their car radio
antennas Monday. Molokai High's colors are green and white.
   ``It's small enough here so that everybody knows each other,''
said the Rev. Robb Kojima of Kalaiakamanu Hou Congregational
Church. ``It's almost like the feeling when the (space shuttle)
Challenger blew up. In the same sense, we all feel the grief.''
   Students at Molokai High gathered for a morning assembly. State
psychologists and psychiatrists and two sent by Aloha IslandAir
were on hand to help students cope with the tragedy.
   The school will establish a special counseling center as well,
Principal Clifford Horita said.
   State Health Director Dr. John Lewin said a six-member Mental
Health Division crisis team will be available to counsel families
and friends of the victims.
   Fire rescue teams used helicopters to ferry the bodies back to
Kahului Airport on Maui. State crisis team workers were on hand to
assist relatives who were flown to the island.
   The twin-engine plane was 16 years old and had made 28,000
flights, Peter Dudgeon, Aloha IslandAir's vice president and
general manager, said Sunday. It was rebuilt in 1986 and had no
significant maintenance problems, he said.
   The plane left Kahului Airport at 6:25 p.m. Saturday for a
scheduled 35-minute flight, said Don Early, air traffic manager for
the Federal Aviation Administration at Honolulu Airport.
   The Coast Guard launched a search shortly after 8 p.m. when the
airline reported the plane missing, officials said. The plane was
sighted at 5:45 a.m. Sunday. Wreckage was found over a 300-foot
area.
   There was no distress call from the crew and no signals were
detected from an emergency locator transmitter aboard the plane,
said Sgt. William Bowker of the Joint Rescue Coordination Center.
   The pilot of the plane, Captain Bruce Pollard, 30, had flown for
the airline for two years, Dudgeon said. He and First Officer Phil
Helfrich, 27, were from Oahu Island, which includes Honolulu.
   Aloha IslandAir said the passenger list included Peter and
Elizabeth Wiley of Philadelphia, John Craig and Christina Batura of
Houston, and Hank Gabriel of Maui. The airline earlier identified
Ms. Batura as Christina Craig, which is how she checked in with the
carrier. Her real name was released Monday.
   The Molokai passengers were identified by the airline as girl's
volleyball team coach Odetta Rapanot; athletic director John Ino;
Leilani Ahina, Jared Elia, Lea Dunnam, Colette Kekalia, Natalie
Helm, Nancy Pierce, Nancine Mahiai, Aloma Spencer, Rodrigo Senica,
Jovencio Ruiz and Testa Ku. No ages were given.

   Michael J. Fox was called ``cute'' and
``charming'' after his initial success, but he didn't like the
labels.
   He then tried a dramatic role in ``Light of Day,'' which bombed,
and a comic role in ``Secret of My Success,'' which was a huge
success.
   ``So I came to realize that I'm not interested in yielding to
cynicism and saying you can't be at all appealing or accessible or
there's something wrong with you,'' he said in November's
Gentlemen's Quarterly. ``And if I get branded `McActor,' it's not
my problem, you know.''
   Fox, who is filming two sequels to his hit, ``Back to the
Future,'' said that in his next film, ``The Hard Way,'' he plays a
TV star who feels guilty about becoming rich playing lightweight
comedic roles and is determined to prove himself as a dramatic
actor.
   ``Actors take on roles for a lot of reasons, and you can read
whatever you want into this one,'' he said. ``I think I can have
fun with it.''

   Entertainer Bette Midler will be $400,000
richer thanks to a jury award against an advertising agency for
imitating her voice in a TV commercial, but she called it a victory
for ethics.
   A U.S. District Court jury decided Monday that Young &amp; Rubicam
violated Miss Midler's rights by imitating her voice.
   In a statement, the agency called the award ``unfortunate but
bearable.''
   ``I hope my victory will in a small way contribute to higher
ethical standards in the advertising field,'' Miss Midler said in a
statement. ``I also hope it will cause companies to pause before
they knowingly and willfully trod on the property rights of
others.''
   At the trial, Miss Midler testified, ``I don't do commercials,''
and said one of her former backup singers was hired to perform the
song ``Do You Wanna Dance?'' for a 1986 Mercury Sable car
commercial.
   Miss Midler, who has appeared in such films as ``Beaches'' and
``Outrageous Fortune,'' filed the lawsuit against Young &amp; Rubicam
seeking $2.5 million in damages. A claim by Midler against Ford was
rejected last week.

   Mayor Barbara Boggs Sigmund, who
unsuccessfully ran in the Democratic primary for governor last
spring, faces another battle with cancer.
   Ms. Sigmund, 49, the colorful mayor of the community that
includes Princeton University, said Monday that the cancer was
diagnosed during a mammography last Wednesday.
   The examination indicated that the malignant melanoma, which
required the removal of her left eye in 1982, had spread.
   Since the loss of her eye, Ms. Sigmund has made a trademark of
her large collection of fashionable eye patches.
   Ms. Sigmund is the daughter of Rep. Lindy Boggs, a Democrat from
New Orleans, and the late Hale Boggs, who was the House majority
leader slated to become speaker of the House when he was killed in
a plane crash in 1972.

   Dame Vera Lynn, the Allied forces' sweetheart, is
leading a campaign for increased pensions for World War II widows.
   Dame Vera, who received her title for entertaining troops, said
she feels strongly that the law must be changed to give World War
II widows the same pension as women who lost husbands in later
battles.
   Defense Ministry rules give wives of servicemen killed after
1973 a second pension on top of their war widows' pension.
   World War II widows receive about $100 a week, while those who
qualify for the second pension get about $220.
   The government says increasing pensions for World War II widows
would cost $320 million a year.
   ``The cost is irrelevant,'' said Dame Vera, 70. ``They gave
their lives, the wives gave their husbands and the fathers of their
children, so whatever it costs they should have it.''

   Wearing cowboy hats and talking about peace
between the United States and their country, 10 Soviet legislators
ended a two-day visit to Kansas.
   The delegation led by Yevgeniy Primakov, whose rank is similar
to the speaker of the U.S. House, visited Dodge City, attended a
town meeting, toured a grain elevator, had home-cooked roast beef
at a farm and looked at planes at McConnell Air Force Base.
   At Monday's farewell ceremonies at the base, Primakov said
improving relations with the United States ``is ... a very big
encouragement.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who arranged the visit,
echoed Primakov's call for peace.
   ``It's a very difficult path and a very difficult course
sometimes,'' he said.
   The Soviets had a good look at a Kansas Air National Guard F-16
fighter. Primakov described the plane in one word: ``Ferocious.''
   Another member of the delegation, Veniamin Yarin, called the
B-1B ``a piece of art.''

   Dick and Beth Pratt's dairy cows always go
to bed with the morning newspaper: They sleep on it.
   The Pratt farm, tucked along the shores of Lake Champlain about
30 miles south of Burlington, is one of at least a dozen in the
state where dairy cows are snoozing on recycled, shredded
newspapers.
   The papers are replacing typical bedding materials like sawdust,
straw, hay, crushed corn stalks and sand.
   ``It's a spectacular market for rural recycling,'' said Jerry
Powell, editor of Resource Recycling magazine.
   Shredded newspapers also are comforting cows in Illinois, Iowa,
Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
   Experts say the trend could be a boon to recyclers, who are
stuck with excess newspapers, and farmers, who pay high prices for
traditional bedding materials.
   ``It's been an obvious way to combine two problems,'' said Will
Gehr, a waste management specialist with the Vermont Department of
Environmental Conservation. ``Old newspaper is typically the
highest amount of materials collected at recycling centers.''
   Vermont recently started a campaign to match dairy farmers with
recycled newspapers. Gehr said the potential demand by Vermont's
2,400 farmers is almost three times greater than the number of
newspapers distributed in the state.
   Farmers say a cow will use between 2 and 5 pounds of bedding
daily. A typical newspaper weighs about a pound.
   The Pratts started with recycled newspapers five years ago at
the suggestion of an agricultural extension agent.
   ``It's just fantastic,'' Beth Pratt said. ``It's far more
absorbent than anything we've ever used. It keeps the animals
cleaner and it makes them feel good.''
   Dairy farmers now use just a fraction of the newspapers recycled
in the United States. Powell said of the 4.54 million tons
collected in 1988, only 100,000 tons were used by dairy farmers.
   But as other bedding prices continue to rise, farmers are eyeing
newspapers as a cheap substitute.
   In Vermont, recycled newspapers are free; sawdust and straw sell
for between $60 and $100 a ton. That's $2,000 a year in savings for
the Pratts.
   The newspapers also may have health benefits for the cows.
   Several studies say the highly-absorbing newspapers lower the
rate of mastitis among dairy cows, said Robert Appleman, a dairy
animal scientist with the University of Minnesota. Mastitis is a
potentially-fatal bacterial infection of the cow's udders.
   Universities say there is no danger to the milk supply from cows
ingesting newspaper. Newspapers no longer use dangerous heavy
metals in their inks and the cows only eat a little of the
newspapers, if any at all, said Terry Musson, a senior regional
milk specialist with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   There are some drawbacks. Glossy inserts do not absorb moisture,
staples injure cows, shreddings blow easily in the wind and farmers
often drive to recycling centers and shred the papers themselves.
   The Pratts' cows seem to like their new beds, though.
   As Beth Pratt shredded some newspapers on a recent Indian-summer
morning, the cows surge toward the confetti.
   ``They love it,'' she said. ``They'll stick their noses in it
and throw it up in the air. They have a good time with it.''

   The Bush administration and the Soviet Union
are discussing a possible summit meeting as early as December,
perhaps on a ship in the Mediterranean to discuss U.S. help in
transforming the Soviet economy, the Washington Post said in
Tuesday editions.
   A well-placed U.S. official, while declining to confirm the Post
account, said it was ``on the right track.'' Other officials said
they were under instructions not to discuss the situation.
   The meeting between Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
President Bush would not replace another between the two leaders
expected next summer, as was agreed between Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
in Wyoming last month, according to an unidentified administration
official, cited by the Post.
   The meeting discussed in Wyoming would be in the United States
while the December conference might be in neutral territory, the
official told the newspaper.
   Among sites he mentioned as a possiblity was a ship in the
Mediterranean.
   The purpose of the meeting that Baker and Shevardnadze agreed to
work toward was described at the time as arms control.
   But a December meeting might concentrate on ways the United
States could help the Soviet Union move closer to a market economy,
according to the official.
   A White House spokesman, Roman Popadiuk, declined to comment on
the newspaper report.
   Bush has been criticized by congressional Democrats for alleged
timidity in responding to the fast-moving changes sweeping the
Soviet Union and some of its satellite states in eastern Europe
that are resulting in freer societies.
   In a recent speech, Baker said the Bush administration was
prepared to give technical economic help to the Soviets and in fact
U.S. economic officials already have been consulted about technical
matters. On Monday, Bush said he would send a Cabinet-level
delegation to Poland late next month to help the Warsaw government
plan ways to repair its ravaged economy.
   Gorbachev's economic reforms so far have not improved the
availability of consumer goods in the Soviet Union or the
performance of the Soviet economy.

   The restaurant ship Princess Louise, a
331-foot-long former Canadian cruise ship, sank at its mooring in
Long Beach Harbor on Monday. No one was on board and no one was
injured, officials said.
   The vessel capsized at Harbor Marine on Terminal Island at 12:19
p.m., and sank 23 feet to the harbor floor, leaving the ship
half-submerged, Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said.
   The cause of the sinking was not known. ``Some refurbishing was
done ... but it was not being worked on when it sank,'' said Los
Angeles Harbor Department spokeswoman Julia Nagano.
   Built in 1921, the Princess Louise carried passengers between
Vancouver, British Columbia, and Alaskan ports. The ship served as
a ferry for the Canadian Pacific Railroad before it was converted
to a restaurant ship in 1966 and taken to Terminal Island.
   The ship's seven banquet rooms and three dining rooms could
accommodate 1,200 diners at a time.
   The restaurant closed Jan. 15.

<HEAD>Though Indicted, Former Socialist Premier Is In The Running</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite open-heart surgery, a messy
divorce and indictment on corruption charges, former Premier
Andreas Papandreou is a strong contender in Sunday's national
elections.
   Remarkably, the charismatic 70-year-old socialist and former
economics professor appears to have held on to his personal support.
   At a rally Sunday attended by tens of thousands of supporters,
he insisted his party will triumph.
   It was not an empty boast: three polls this month indicated
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) would retain
the 39 percent it won in June's election, when the conservative New
Democracy party fared better but failed to attain a parliamentary
majority.
   ``We are talking about victory. The forecasts look better every
day,'' Papandreou told the Athens daily Epikairotita.
   Actually, victory appears far from assured. Papandreou is going
into the polls an underdog, after winning easy victories in 1981
and 1985 then losing his party majority in June. But no one is
ruling him out.
   Papandreou's durability is due to several factors: political
astuteness; the strong party loyalty of Greek voters; support from
farmers and his autocratic rule of PASOK and personal charisma.
   The most serious difficulty facing Papandreou are charges he
authorized the embezzlement of millions from a private bank and
instigated a wiretapping network with which he allegedly listened
in on friends and foes.
   In September, he was indicted by Parliament, the first Greek
civilian leader ordered to stand trial for alleged wrongdoing in
office. He and five former ministers are expected to be tried by
special courts early next year.
   Papandreou claimes the indictments stem from a conspiracy to
annihilate him politically.
   ``Under the guise of performing a cleanup they settled personal
and party accounts,'' he told his supporters Sunday. ``They
promoted the defamation of their political rivals.''
   His defense appears to have worked.
   ``We watched the (parliamentary) debates on television but no
one was convinced that Papandreou is guilty,'' said Nikos
Christonakis, a 78-year-old retired farmer and PASOK supporter on
Crete. ``The government's arguments were unconvincing.''
   Political scientist Michalis Spourdalakis said the right- and
left-wing parties may not get much advantage from attacking
Papandreou on the scandals.
   ``They failed to understand that you don't dismantle a movement
which once enjoyed 48 percent of the vote,'' he said. ``A different
political program is what's needed.''
   In addition to the scandal charges, conservatives and leftists
accuse Papandreou of ruining the economy, citing a $58 billion
deficit.
   But farmers, who form 25 percent of the working population,
point to improvements in education and health care in the
countryside and to European Economic Community agricultural
subsidies for which they credit the Socialists.
   Papandreou has in the past won support from the left through
pledging to pull Greece out of NATO and the EEC. However, he has
acted pragmatically, keeping Greece in the EEC and negotiating a
new five-year defense accord with the United States in 1983.
   Spourdalakis says Papandreou was able to capitalize on the
anti-American sentiments that followed the fall in 1974 of a
seven-year military dictatorship that was seen as having enjoyed
American support.
   Papandreou promised a new future for Greece but also represented
a link with the past. He was a Cabinet member in the centrist
government of his father George, who was removed from power in 1965.
   Spourdalakis says Papandreou personifies Greeks' yearning for
change in the political system: ``Being educated and a technocrat
he could fulfill the demand for modernization in society, politics
and the economy.''
   The first serious blow to Papandreou came in August of 1988 when
he left for London urgently for medical treatment. He underwent
open-heart surgery that October and was hospitalized again in July
for pneumonia and kidney failure.
   He has a doctor at his side continually but claims that his
health has not affected his ability to lead.
   While in London, Papandreou went public with his affair with an
air hostess half his age, Dimitra Liani. He was still married to
his American-born wife of 38 years, Margaret. A poll conducted
after the June elections found that PASOK had lost 7 percent of its
women voters.
   Papandreou married Liani in July and neither the opposition nor
the press have concentrated on his personal life in this campaign.
   One of the biggest questions about the elections is what will
happen if _ as in June _ no one gains a majority.
   After the June deadlock, The New Democrats and the Communist-led
Coalition of the Left and Progress formed an unprecedented alliance
with a limited mandate to clean up political life.
   Having obtained the indictments it sought of Papandreou and its
associates, the coalition government resigned Oct. 7.
   The Communist coalition said recently tht it would consider
governing with PASOK _ but only if Papandreou were removed.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Lester Maddox said Monday he will
enter the 1990 Democratic race for governor in January, making good
on his vow that he would run if no true conservative candidate
emerged.
   Maddox released a statement saying his candidacy ``now appears
to be a certainty.'' In a telephone interview, he said that means
he plans to run but will make no official announcement until
January.
   Asked if anything could change his mind, the 74-year-old former
governor said, ``I don't anticipate anything.''
   Maddox announced last year that he would enter the 1990 race if
no conservative Democratic candidate came forward to challenge the
party's national establishment.
   Since then, Lt. Gov. Zell Miller, state Rep. Lauren ``Bubba''
McDonald and state Sen. Roy Barnes have formally entered the
Democratic race for governor, and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young has
indicated he will run. On the Republican side, state Rep. Johnny
Isakson and former Superior Court Judge Greeley Ellis are in the
running.
   ``It is true that a number of candidates have announced, or
promised to announce. ... Most are men I personally know as good
men,'' Maddox said in his statement. ``... However, they are all
followers and captives of the political establishment without
conservative records, and in my judgment could not be elected as a
Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia in 1990.''
   He also said the other candidates ``would be unable to provide
the strong and free conservative leadership so badly needed for the
years ahead in our state.''
   Maddox said he plans to raise his campaign funds from ``the
outsiders, the average Georgians'' who are ``fed up with their
government.''
   He said he believes he could win the primary, a primary runoff
and the general election with a total warchest of $1 million to
$1.25 million.
   ``I don't have to have the $15 million they're going to raise _
$3 million or $4 million each,'' he said.
   Although he has been treated for cancer, Maddox said his health
is now ``fantastic'' and he doesn't consider himself too old for
the office. ``I've determined that somewhere between 85 and 90,
people get old,'' he said.
   Maddox served as governor of Georgia from 1967 to 1971 and later
was lieutenant governor under former Gov. Jimmy Carter.

   Fierce winds that pushed flames over 4,000
acres of brushy hillsides diminished Monday, allowing firefighters
to surround the wildfire and declare it controlled.
   Firefighters snuffed out the blaze Monday evening, and planned
to remain at the scene until Tuesday afternoon to prevent
flare-ups, said Ventura County fire department spokeswoman Liz
Pickles.
   ``There's no more smoke, no more flames, and they'll decide
tomorrow whether to pull out,'' Ms. Pickles said.
   Two hundred firefighters, most of them using picks and shovels
to quell hot spots, took part in the mop-up.
   The fire began around 5 a.m. Sunday, when 50-mph winds downed a
power line, igniting the brushy Santa Monica Mountains area
northwest of Malibu.
   The fast-moving blaze destroyed two mountaintop homes and three
other buildings, sending residents, including entertainer Dick
Clark, rushing toward the ocean for safety. More than 2,200 people
were routed from campsites, authorities said.
   Thick, dark smoke from the fire forced closure of the busy
Pacific Coast Highway. The fire could be seen up to 30 miles away.
   Up to 570 firefighters from Los Angeles and Ventura counties
battled the blaze as four air tankers and six helicopters bombed a
two-mile front of flames with retardant and water.
   Residents hosed down the roofs of their homes just north of the
county line, and charred trees and smoldering brush lined the
coastal highway.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly farmer doesn't understand the
excitement about a ``bunch of old bones'' found on his farm. But
scientists say the remains are that of a stag-moose and may provide
clues about the Ice Age creatures.
   The Biddle family on Monday gave the state the antlered skull,
identified as that of a ``Cervalces scotti,'' a moose-like animal
that stood about 12 feet tall, weighed about 1,700 pounds and ate
aquatic plants.
   John C. Biddle, 73, of Elburn, 40 miles west of Chicago, said
the skull was found five years ago while the family was digging a
pond in a swampy area. Further digging turned up no additional
remains.
   The Biddles cleaned the skull and put it in the garage, where it
gathered dust for years and was considered ``nothing more than a
bunch of old bones.''
   ``It meant nothing to us,'' Biddle said in a telephone
interview. ``To us it was just like a white elephant. ...
Interesting to look at, but what are you going to do with it?''
   But officials at the Illinois State Museum in Springfield say
the skull, which has the features of a deer and the flattened
antlers of a moose, is an important find because of the lack of
information on the species.
   The animals roamed the northern part of the continent until
about 10,000 years ago and probably competed with the present-day
moose and the now-extinct mastodon, said Jeffrey Saunders,
associate geologist at the museum.
   The stag-moose found on the Biddle farm was an adult male,
because only males have antlers, Saunders said. The beast had very
long legs, like a camel, and resembled a giant big deer.
   The Biddles' stag-moose probably was munching on some plants in
a marshy bog, got stuck in the mud and eventually died, Saunders
said. The rest of the body probably turned to dust, while the
thicker head and antlers survived, he said.
   The skull will be studied and exhibited at the museum, Saunders
said. It is the eighth stag-moose fossil found in the state, but
the first one with antlers.
   Scientists have extracted sediment from the farm and hope to
perform radio-carbon dating tests on the skull to determine the
exact age of the animal.
   But the Biddles say prehistoric moose heads take a back seat to
the harvest on their 450-acre farm.
   Biddle said his son, Michael, who found the skull, decided not
to attend the formal presentation Monday on the family farm.
   ``He's got more important things to do,'' Biddle said.

   An array of religious groups _ from Hare

over state taxing powers.
   The justices today were to hear arguments challenging
California's taxation of books, tapes and other merchandise sold by
the Louisiana-based Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.
   Backing California in the dispute are two organizations not
usually allied in court _ the American Civil Liberties Union and
the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   California court rulings forced Swaggart's ministry to pay the
state $183,000 in back taxes and interest for 1974 through 1981.
   But lawyers for Swaggart's organization say the California tax,
as applied, violates religious freedom and due process and unduly
interferes with interstate commerce.
   After hearing from both sides today, the nation's highest court
is expected to announce its decision by July.
   The disputed state sales and use tax is imposed on ``retailers''
for the privilege of selling personal property in California, and
on the consumption of products within the state.
   The tax was imposed on sales by the Swaggart ministry during
crusades in California and sales made through the mail.
   For the years at issue, mail-order sales from Baton Rouge, La.,
to California consumers totaled $1.7 million. Sales of merchandise
at California crusades totaled $240,000.
   Swaggart's lawyers are relying heavily on a 1943 high court
ruling that overturned the convictions of Jehovah's Witnesses who
violated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged in
door-to-door canvassing to get a license and pay a fee.
   The Jehovah's Witnesses were distributing religious literature,
and the 1943 ruling said, ``This form of religious activity
occupies the same high estate under the (Constitution's) First
Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the
pulpits.''
   But a California appeals court ruled that ``nondiscriminatory''
taxes levied on sales _ including sales by religious groups _ are
constitutional. The California Supreme Court refused to review
Swaggart's appeal from that ruling.
   Numerous organizations have filed ``friend of the court'' briefs
in the case.
   Defending the state tax, lawyers for the ACLU said the
constitutional guarantee of religious freedom ``does not mandate a
religious exemption from a neutral, nondiscriminatory tax on sales
of tangible property.''
   Providing such an exemption, the ACLU brief contended, would
violate the constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
   But lawyers for the National Council of Churches, representing
most Protestant denominations among its members, called the
California tax ``a serious threat ... a tax on the dissemination of
religious messages, and thus a forbidden tax on the exercise of
religion.''
   A similar brief submitted by the International Society for
Krishna Consciousness said that group has paid, under protest,
nearly $300,000 in taxes to California for sales of religious
literature by its members.
   Under the Hare Krishna ritual of Sankirtan, members are required
to distribute such literature and solicit money from the public to
support the religion.
   Lawyers for a coalition of evangelical ministries argued that if
the California tax is upheld ``the door will be wide open for over
7,000 taxing jurisdictions to impose a similar burden on national
religious ministries.''
   The case is Jimmy Swaggart Ministries vs. Board of Equalization,
88-1374.

   Don't save a place in your wallet for the
Montana Card.
   The Legislature thought getting a bank to issue cards with a Big
Sky Country theme would be a dandy way to raise some extra money,
but bankers don't seem to share the enthusiasm.
   No financial institution put in a bid to offer a Montana Card by
the Revenue Department's Oct. 20 deadline.
   ``I honestly don't know what happened,'' Jack Ellery, deputy
director of operations for the agency, said Monday. ``I was
surprised because there was so much interest (before).''
   The idea's sponsor, Rep. Mark O'Keefe, got calls from across the
country about the state's plan to offer a so-called ``affinity
card.''
   Sponsors of such cards cards get a fee from the banks issuing
the plastic, and in theory, the bank gets more customers for its
cards. Montana officials who had hoped to bring in $7.6 million by
1993 with the idea will decide next month whether to try again.
   Ellery thinks the bankers may have been put off by the paperwork
of competitive bidding.
   But Ed Jasmin, president of the Montana Bankers' Association,
has another explanation: Montana, population 805,000, doesn't have
enough people to make such a venture profitable.

   Brian Theriot always regretted passing
up a chance to play college football. Now, more than a decade
later, he's turned a community college gridiron into his field of
dreams.
   The 32-year-old businessman enrolled in Orange Coast College and
joined the Orange Coast Pirates as a running back.
   ``I think what he's done is really remarkable,'' coach Bill
Workman said, hurrying to add: ``I wouldn't suggest that any other
32-year-olds come out of retirement and try to make it on a
community college team.''
   Theriot said he still has much of the speed that took him to the
Olympic track and field trials in 1980, 1984 and 1988. Although his
playing time with the Pirates has been limited, he said he's having
a great time. But, he added, ``they hit a heck of a lot harder than
I remember.''
   Theriot was welcomed by his younger teammates, though running
back Jason McGehee said they had to correct one fashion gaffe:
   ``When he first showed up, he had his socks pulled up way above
his knees, like he thought he was back in 1975.''

   The folks who run Florida's Turnpike have figured a
way out of a sticky situation.
   Chewing gum isn't sold anywhere on the road's 309 miles _
especially in the clean new rest stations that dot the length of
the turnpike.
   ``So many times, the gum winds up on the sidewalk, on the
floors, under the tables, in the carpet,'' said Jim Butch, the
manager of the Lake Worth rest station. ``That's the reason.''
   The new stations opened in September, but the gum ban has been
in effect for two years, ever since the Marriott Corp. took control
of turnpike rest stops.
   Not everyone is happy with the restriction.
   Highway Patrol Lt. Phil Moan stocks the glove compartment of his
cruiser with gum and packs his own stash when he goes to Palm Beach
International Airport, which has also banned gum sales.
   ``I'm going to have to become a gumshoe on this, and stick to
it,'' he said.

   Shining Path guerrillas killed two policemen
in Lima and hung the bodies of eight dogs from lampposts with death
threats against the leaders of the Soviet Union and China,
authorities said.
   They said a police commander assigned to Interpol, the
international police organization, was shot to death Monday while
driving his daughter to school.
   Police said several men in a car intercepted the commander's
vehicle, hurled a bomb under it, then opened the fire. They said
the commander's daughter was not hurt.
   In the other fatal attack Monday a patrolman was shot as he
entered a telephone booth in Lima's El Agustino district.
   Police said the bodies of the dogs were found hanging from
lampposts in various sections of the city Sunday night and notes
fastened to the cadavers read: ``Death to Gorbachev and Deng
Xiaoping.'' The lampposts also were draped with red flags with the
hammer and sickle, the symbol of the Maoist Shining Path movement.
   The Shining Path, which emerged in 1980, claims to follow the
principles of the late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung.
   It has denounced China's top leader, Deng Xiaoping, and other
members of the Chinese Communist Party hierarchy as ``traitors'' to
Mao's teachings. Shining Path has condemned Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a violator of Marxism and because of Soviet
arms sales to the Peruvian armed forces.
   The Shining Path used the practice of hanging dogs as a
threatening gesture when it first began its anti-government
campaign but had not carried out such acts in recent years.
   Shining Path guerrillas have stepped up their attacks this month
in an effort to disrupt nationwide municipal elections scheduled
for Nov. 12. The government says 330 people have been killed in
political violence in October.
   The government on Monday extended for 60 days the state of
emergency in eight provinces of Peru because of continuing rebel
violence. The measure suspends constitutional guarantees and places
the areas under military control.
   Most of the province of Lima, where the capital is located, was
placed under a state of emergency last week.
   More than a third of Peru and half of the nation's population of
21 million people are under states of emergency.

<HEAD>Sullivan: `Days are Numbered' At `CBS This Morning' Unless Ratings
Improve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``CBS This Morning'' co-anchor Kathleen Sullivan
said her job is in jeopardy if the ratings for her program don't
improve.
   ``I can't lie about that _ I know the ax is right there,''
Sullivan said when asked by Phil Donahue on his syndicated
``Donahue'' show if she was feeling the pressure of being on a
program with poor ratings _ now third among network morning shows.
   Sullivan appeared Monday with her two female competitors on
network morning programs, Joan Lunden of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' and Jane Pauley, who is leaving ``Today'' at the end of
this year.
   The CBS program, which Sullivan co-anchors with Harry Smith,
premiered on Nov. 30, 1987. It was the latest in CBS' long effort
to compete in the morning.
   Sullivan said her program's ratings have risen 50 percent since
it began, but she added that if more viewers don't watch ``and we
don't improve from where we are (in ratings), my days are
numbered.''
   There was no immediate comment from CBS.
   During Monday's show Pauley _ who last Friday told her national
``Today'' audience that she is leaving after 13 years and will be
succeeded by news anchor Deborah Norville _ said if Norville hadn't
been hired, she wouldn't be leaving so soon.
   Norville became the show's news anchor on Sept.5.
   ``No, I would not be leaving at this time because the shift in
attitude would have come along much more slowly,'' she said,
referring to her own attitude about leaving the top-rated program.
   Pauley, whose current NBC News contract has been extended to
1992, will co-anchor a prime-time news series that will premiere in
late June or early July. She also will anchor a prime-time special
called ``Changes'' in March.

<HEAD>Navy Jet Drops 500-Pound Bomb on US Cruiser</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy officials are questioning the pilot of a
fighter jet that dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile
cruiser USS Reeves, blowing a gaping hole in the ship's bow and
injuring five sailors.
   The incident, which occurred while the cruiser was escorting the
aircraft carrier USS Midway on training operations in the Indian
Ocean, was the Navy's second major training accident in as many
days.
   On Sunday, a student pilot slammed a T-2 Buckeye into the
carrier USS Lexington, killing himself and four members of the deck
crew during training exercises off Florida.
   Navy spokesmen said the pilot of the single-seat F-A-18 Hornet
had just taken off from the Midway.
   The bomb, which detonated upon impact, blew a five-foot hole in
the top deck and set off a small fire in the ship's forecastle that
was quickly extinguished, said Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman at
the Pentagon.
   ``We don't know yet why it happened,'' said another spokesman,
Cmdr. Mark Baker. ``The incident is under investigation.''
   Baker said the pilot was returned to the Midway and was being
questioned by Navy officers.
   Cole said the five sailors received minor injuries ``as a result
of flying glass and concussion'' from the exploding bomb. The
sailors were treated on board the USS Reeves, he added.
   The spokesman said the Navy did not plan to release the names of
the injured until their families were notified.
   Cole and Baker said the aircraft carrier and guided missile
cruiser were conducting routine weapons training in the Indian
Ocean about 32 miles from Diego Garcia, the site of a U.S. base.
   Cole said the F-A-18's pilot ``inadvertently'' dropped the bomb,
apparently as it passed over its cruiser escort. The spokesmen said
they did not know the altitude of the plane or how far apart the
two ships were.
   Although the bomb left a large hole in the deck near the
cruiser's bow, it did no damage to the outer hull, Cole said.
   The Reeves is described as a ``nuclear capable'' ship, but the
Navy spokesmen refused to confirm whether nuclear weapons were
aboard. Such weapons _ anti-submarine rockets that are being phased
out of the Navy's inventory _ are usually carried in a forward
compartment of the ship near where the bomb struck.
   The cruiser was returning to the U.S. base at Diego Garcia under
its own power, Baker said.
   The Mark-82 bomb was described as about four feet long and 14
inches in diameter. It is a gravity, or free-fall bomb, and can be
used against ships at sea, land targets, or adapted to be used as a
shrapnel device against humans.
   The plane is a jet which can adapt to both the fighter and
attack roles.
   The incident occurred at 9:06 p.m. local time, Cole said.
   Both the Midway, which is one of the Navy's oldest aircraft
carriers, and the Reeves are permanently based in Yokosuka, Japan.
   The 533-foot Reeves is a Leahy class guided missile cruiser
displacing 7,800 tons fully loaded and carrying 450 officers and
enlisted men. It was commissioned in 1964.
   The 980-foot-long Midway, displacing 64,000 tons at full load,
was commissioned in 1945 and has undergone a number of overhauls.
It carries a crew of approximately 2,500 officers and enlisted men.
   The accident was at least the sixth aboard a Navy ship, not
counting sailors lost overboard, since the April 19 turret
explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa that killed 47 sailors.

<HEAD>Mayoral Candidates Across the Country Accentuate the Negative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A paternity suit in Detroit, a wife-beating allegation in
Cleveland, a stock sale in New York _ all are high-profile issues
in mayoral elections at a time when voters say they are worried
about drugs, crime, homelessness and the quality of schools.
   ``This city faces very large problems,'' said Rudolph Giuliani,
Republican candidate for mayor of New York City. But discussion of
those problems keeps getting shoved aside by juicier stuff in the
harsh campaign between Giuliani and Democrat David Dinkins.
   From the nation's largest city to many of its smallest, voters
will elect hundreds of mayors on Nov. 7, with most incumbents
facing only token opposition.
   There are issue-oriented contests in Dayton, Ohio, and Seattle,
but in other cities with tough races, the campaigns accentuate the
negative and raise unpleasant memories of the worst aspects of the
1988 presidential race.
   The tactics are ``an extension of 1988'' and an example of the
importance voters give to character as a political issue, said
Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
   ``People vote for people, they don't vote for issues,'' said
Republican consultant Eddie Mahe, arguing that an emphasis on
character rather than position papers makes sense. ``These
proponents of one-sided positive campaigns, that's goo-goo land.
That's a dream world...''
   Drugs are named by many as the biggest problem facing the
nation, but politicians are all proclaiming their opposition to
drugs and drug dealers, a fact that Mahe said diminishes it as a
campaign issue.
   ``It appears negative stuff moves (polling) numbers and positive
doesn't,'' said James Ruvolo, Ohio Democratic Party chairman. ``I
think there's a mean spirit out there and I think people want to
believe the worst about politicians.''
   In Ruvolo's own back yard is one of the year's nastiest mayoral
races _ the contest in Cleveland between City Council President
George Forbes and state Sen. Michael R. White.
   Both finalists in the race to succeed Republican Mayor George
Voinovich are Democrats, but their common party affiliation has
done nothing to diminish the bitterness of the race.
   ``The master of sleaze,'' was White's description of Forbes.
   ``Slum lord'' was how Forbes characterized White.
   White accused Forbes operatives of leaking reports that the
state senator had beaten his first wife and said he was the object
of ``a campaign of political terror.'' A short time later, White's
second wife told reporters she had been shoved and beaten.
   Mary Forbes was described as a ``front person'' for her
husband's investments in two radio stations, a drive-in theater,
and a nursing home.
   ``I respect his wife,'' said Forbes. ``I demand he respect my
wife.''
   About the time 71-year-old Coleman Young was gearing up to run
for a fifth term as mayor of Detroit he was hit with a paternity
suit filed by a former city employee. But what looked like a golden
opportunity for Young's opponents faded as an issue when the mayor
agreed to set up a trust fund for 7-year-old Joel Loving and
provide for the boy through his 25th birthday.
   Opponent Tom Barrow emerged from the September nonpartisan
primary as Young's challenger and proclaimed, ``You can run,
Coleman, but you can't hide.''
   So far, Young has run quite well and holds a 10-point lead in
polls over the man he beat four years ago. Barrow has attacked
Young's leadership during 16 years as mayor, hoping voters will
decide it's time for a change.
   The city's two major newspapers think it is. Both the Detroit
News and the Detroit Free Press endorsed Barrow.
   Drugs and crime are issues in Dayton where Mayor Richard Clay
Dixon, a Democrat, is challenged by Abner Orick, a Republican city
commissioner.
   ``He's been in office for three years and each year he'd been
in, crime has increased substantially,'' said Orick.
   ``My records show I have been fighting the war on drugs since I
became mayor,'' retorted Dixon. ``Where was Abner when we declared
war? He did not mention drugs until he became a candidate.''
   Norm Rice, a Seattle city councilman, is favored to become the
city's first black mayor in a campaign in which an initiative aimed
at ending mandatory school busing is a major issue. Doug Jewett,
Rice's Republican opponent, helped draft the measure.
   Rice has criticized the initiative for lacking controls to
prevent the resegregation of schools, but also has said, ``Let's
face it, Doug Jewett is not a racist.''
   Even more low-key is the debate in Miami where Mayor Xavier
Suarez is challenged by Armando E. Lacasa who conceded, ``I do not
believe I was the best candidate to face Suarez. He's going to be
very difficult to beat. But we want to send a message to the mayor
that we are not happy.''
   No such politeness or modesty was detectable in New York City.
   Voters are told that Dinkins is careless about his finances and
that Giuliani is a cold prosecutor, that Jesse Jackson is an ally
of Dinkins and that comedian Jackie Mason's support of Giuliani
proved not very funny.
   ``I refuse to cede the moral high ground. Negative campaigning
doesn't work,'' said Dinkins as his campaign started running a
commercial in which Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., attacked
Giuliani for flip-flopping on abortion and supporting ``judges and
policies to roll back basic civil rights and civil liberties.''
   Jewish voters are a critical group in New York elections and
Giuliani welcomed the support of Mason, an ordained rabbi who
became a standup comic and now stars in the television series,
``Chicken Soup.''
   But Mason's help turned sour when he was overheard saying,
``There is a sick Jewish problem of voting for a black man no
matter how unfit he is for the job.''
   The resulting controversy had Giuliani reeling, but then Dinkins
was put on the defensive by a report he understated the value of a
stock he sold to his son and by an anti-semitic remark attributed
to a black activist who worked for the Dinkins campaign.
   The activist, Robert C. ``Sonny'' Carson, said it was incorrect
to call him anti-semitic. ``I'm anti-white,'' he said.
   Dinkins swiftly denounced Carson, but the incident reminded some
Jewish voters of their antipathy to Jackson who campaigned for
Dinkins during the primary in which he defeated Mayor Ed Koch.
   Even in the calmer atmosphere of Des Moines, Iowa, it's hard to
get people's attention with an issue-oriented campaign.
   Paul Sanfield is running city-wide against City Councilman
George Flagg for an at-large seat.
   ``My issue is affordable housing and neighborhood
redevelopment,'' said Sanfield, who lamented his problem getting
his message out. ``I guess issues aren't that important.''

<HEAD>Terrorist, Police Officer Killed When Grenade Explodes Too Soon</HEAD>

   A terrorist attacking a police patrol
was killed when a grenade blew up in his hands before he could
throw it, but an officer was also killed and two other people
wounded, authorities said.
   Three more in a series of dynamite bombings blamed on drug
traffickers also shook the capital Monday, police said.
   A police statement said the grenade attack occurred Monday in a
middle-class neighborhood of Bogota.
   After the grenade exploded, fragments injured two police
officers, one of whom died moments later, the statement said.
   Police captured another man slightly injured in the blast and
accused him of aiding in the attack, it said without giving details.
   There was no immediate word on a possible motive for the attack,
which may have been related to the government's war on the the
illicit drug trade.
   The government and drug gangs have been engaged in a bloody
struggle since mid-August, when traffickers killed a leading
presidential candidate.
   Authorities blame drug traffickers for most of the 237 bombings
that have rocked Colombia since the government of President
Virgilio Barco declared the crackdown. The blasts have killed 33
people and injured 222.
   In several of the latest attacks, terrorists have targeted
police. On Thursday, five police officers were killed when a bomb
exploded beside a bus carrying officers to night duty in Medellin.
   The next day, another policeman died in the bombing of the
national police air base outside Bogota.
   Monday's attack occurred about the same time the wave of
dynamite bombings hit the capital. Three bombs exploded in
different parts of the city, causing extensive damage but no
injuries.
   The bombs targeted a bank, a social security office, and a
grocery store.
   It is believed the drug traffickers are retaliating for the
government's extradition of Colombian drug suspects captured in the
anti-drug campaign. Authorities have sent five suspects to face
trial in the United States.
   The government has repeatedly rebuffed offers from the Medellin
cartel to negotiate an end to the violence. Barco has said he will
not deal with traffickers accused of killing a justice minister, a
newspaper publisher and scores of other leading Colombians in the
last five years.

   Author William Styron got his start as a
12-year-old writing a short story for his school newspaper about a
ship in a typhoon, with a captain who ``mused darkly'' and a mate
who gave a ``despondent shriek.''
   Doris Grumbach's first literary effort was titled ``A Man and
His Dog.'' It was good enough to win a high school contest and help
her finagle admission to college despite failing grades. She didn't
write her first novel until 37 years later.
   ``Eggs'' was the first piece written by novelist William
Kennedy, then a college freshman. His short story about a man who
ordered scrambled eggs in a diner was praised by Kennedy's mother
and his banjo teacher but panned by his father, who read it over
breakfast and snapped, ``What the hell is this?''
   Kennedy still has the rejection slip from Collier's magazine.
``It taught me that you don't trust your parents with literature,''
he said.
   They were among 21 prominent American novelists, poets and
essayists who took turns Monday night on the Elizabethan stage of
the Shakespeare Theater at the Folger describing how they got
started in the writing business.
   Their readings, which focused on the theme of Eudora Welty's
book ``One Writer's Beginnings,'' were the highlight of a 10th
anniversary celebration of the PEN@Faulkner Award for Fiction, an
annual prize honoring the best published works of fiction by
contemporary American writers.
   The award is named for the late novelist William Faulkner, who
used his Nobel Prize funds to support talented young writers, and
is financed by gifts, grants and an annual series of readings at
the Folger Shakespeare Library.
   Many of the writers thanked their parents for introducing them
at an early age to what Richard Bausch called ``the power of
words,'' with family traditions of storytelling and book reading.
   Gloria Naylor, winner of the American Book Award for first
fiction for ``The Women of Brewster Place,'' said she inherited her
``passionate love of books'' from her mother, a poor Mississippi
black who joined mail-order book clubs because she was barred from
the local library.
   Joyce Carol Oates, an award-winning novelist, playwright and
essayist, said she grew up poor in Lockport, N.Y., and lived in a
``world of imagination,'' fired by her visits to the town library
and hours of listening to stories read by her parents and
grandparents.
   ``Writers begin as privileged listeners,'' she said.
   After his clumsy boyhood attempt at writing an adventure story
in the style of Joseph Conrad, Styron said he abandoned his
literary interests in favor of moviegoing until he turned 18 and
discovered Thomas Wolfe's novels.
   For five years, Styron indulged the ``intoxicating and
dizzying'' pleasure of reading hundreds of books, and then began
his first novel, ``Lie Down in Darkness.'' He later won a Pulitzer
Prize for ``The Confessions of Nat Turner'' and the American Book
Award for ``Sophie's Choice.''
   Susan Sontag described herself as ``a voluntary misfit'' as a
child. ``At home in bed with a book was not only the safest place
to be but the freest,'' she said.
   Both Larry McMurtry and Miss Welty said they developed their
love of words and keen imaginations during long periods of illness
as children.
   As a sickly youngster in West Texas, McMurtry said he ``lived in
radioland'' listening to popular radio serials of the 1940s. When
wartime bulletins pre-empted his favorite radio shows too often, he
finally dipped into a box of books left by a cousin who had joined
the Army, and ``the literary life began for me.''
   Miss Welty said she was taken out of school at age 6 or 7 and
put to bed with a heart condition for several months. She remembers
that ``an opulence of story books covered my bed _ they were my
counterpane.''
   She fell in love first with the alphabet, then ``the wizardry of
the initials and letters and words'' of her fairy tales, then heard
``the voice of the story'' as she learned to read and later to
write.
   ``I was a writer who came from a sheltered life, but a sheltered
life can be a daring life, and the daring begins within,'' she said.
   Other writers who joined more than 200 guests at the
celebration, which included a candlelight dinner in the library's
Great Hall, were Amiri Baraka, Gwendolyn Brooks, Hortense Calisher,
Pat Conroy, Annie Dillard, Brendan Gill, Stephen Goodwin, Reynolds
Price, Maurice Sendak, Mary Lee Settle, Susan Richards Shreve and
Robert Stone.

   Former President Nixon today brought his private
mission of U.S. reconciliation with China to senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, who agreed the two powers should put common interests
above ideological differences.
   ``I'm very much in favor of your view regarding state-to-state
relations,'' the 85-year-old Deng said at the beginning of their
meeting at the Great Hall of the People.
   ``You should focus on the strategic interests of a country, and
you should not talk about historical roots or differences in
ideology or the strength of a country.''
   Nixon, on the fourth day of a private visit, has called on the
two countries to bury their differences over the June killings of
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing and mend their frayed
relations.
   He is the most prominent American to visit China since the
crackdown and is expected to brief President Bush upon returning to
the United States.
   Soldiers killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed
civilians in Beijing June 4 as the government moved to crush the
student-led movement for a freer China.
   Chinese leaders have agreed it is time to renew ties but say the
United States is to blame for the poor relations and must take the
initiative.
   At today's meeting, Deng praised Nixon for his 1972 trip to
China, which ended 23 years of unveiled hostility and paved the way
for restoring relations. ``What you've done deserves our admiration
and interest,'' Deng said. ``It was you who as president of the
United States changed this status.''
   Nixon, 76, told Deng he had watched Chinese-American relations
for 17 years and that China should understand the depth of American
concern over the government's suppression of the pro-democracy
movement.
   A member of the Nixon party who attended the meeting described
it as a ``tough, no-holds-barred exchange'' that covered the
crackdown, China's ties to the United States and the Soviet Union,
reform in eastern Europe and other subjects.
   Deng appeared tired at today's meeting. Usually, he walks out to
greet visitors. This time, Nixon was escorted into a room to meet
Deng, who was already seated.
   Deng disappeared from public for three months after the June
military crackdown and was rumored to be seriously ill.
   However, talking to reporters after the meeting, Nixon said he
``was impressed by his vigor.''
   ``We found that we did not agree about many elements, but we
found that we agreed on some,'' Nixon added.
   Nixon said the current rift between the two countries is
``without question the most serious'' since 1972.
   But he said he was confident the relationship ``will be
sustained and those that are signaling its death are much
premature.''
   At a state banquet Monday hosted by Premier Li Peng, the former
president urged a restoration of good relations but also called for
a ``humanely governed China'' that won't ``turn away from greatness
and consign itself to the backwater of oppression and stagnation.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, commenting on Nixon's
appeal for rapprochement, said the United States wants to normalize
relations but the conditions are not yet right.
   Washington has suspended high-level official contacts and cut
off arms sales since the crackdown.

   The U.S. Embassy has protested to Chinese
authorities over slashed tires, soldiers terrorizing diplomats'
children with rifles, and other harassment, an embassy source said.
   The charges were made in three protests filed in recent days
with the Chinese government, the source said Monday.
   The protests came as the Chinese have increased surveillance of
the U.S. Embassy's compounds.
   The embassy source said that in the past week, one embassy staff
member found a tire on his car flat on two mornings, each time
after he had entertained Chinese guests. Two other staff members
found their car lights had been turned on during the night,
draining the batteries, and in one case a car's fan belt was stolen.
   Twice in the past week, armed police outside the embassy pointed
automatic rifles at children of U.S. diplomats and pulled the
triggers, the source said. The guns were not loaded.
   Security forces also are tailing embassy employees when they
leave the compounds, he said.
   Late Monday night, eight cars without license plates, one car
with police plates and two police motorcycles were parked in front
of U.S. Ambassador James Lilley's residence.
   More than a dozen plainclothes police, wrapped in cotton-lined
coats against the autumn chill, stood on the sidewalk, and others
could be seen through the dark-tinted car windows. They watched
passing cars closely.
   An equal contingent of marked and unmarked police cars sat on
the street in front of the main embassy compound, and two more were
parked on an adjoining street.
   People's Armed Police with automatic rifles and helmets have
surrounded the embassy and Lilley's residence since June, when
Chinese dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge
in one of the compounds and relations between the United States and
China deteriorated sharply.
   Police had issued warrants for them after the army crushed the
pro-democracy movement on June 4. Chinese officials accused the
United States of violating international law by giving them shelter.
   A few plainclothes security officials also have been stationed
outside the other U.S. compounds since then, but the number
increased a few weeks ago and further increased on Saturday, the
embassy source said.
   ``I don't know what it all means ... but it's getting worse,''
he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The intense vigilance at the U.S. compounds coincides with the
visit of former President Nixon, who arrived Saturday on a private
trip as the guest of the Chinese government.
   Nixon, who helped pave the way for a restoration of bilateral
ties by visiting Beijing in 1972, has been staying at the Diaoyutai
State Guesthouse.
   The embassy source said he could see no connection between the
Nixon visit and the heightened security.

   The Bay cities capped World Series mania
with muted celebration and returned to the business of recovery
from billions of dollars in earthquake damage as lawmakers prepared
to debate how to pay the bill.
   The scale of the disaster continued to become more apparent as
the number of applicants for emergency housing, grants and loans
reached 30,000, but a poll indicated most Californians would
support a sales tax hike to help out.
   Businesses, meanwhile, began ad campaigns to bring back tourists
and conventions to prevent economic disaster on top of the natural
calamity.
   About 4,000 fans cheered the Oakland Athletics in Oakland's Jack
London Square on Monday, but there was no parade and the Oct. 17
quake that delayed the A's victory over the San Francisco Giants
for 10 days was in mind.
   ``Nobody likes the reason we had to wait so long to be the world
champions, but I know it means a great deal to all of us,'' A's
manager Tony La Russa told the crowd, which was asked to contribute
to quake relief.
   The team's arrival by ferry was an implicit endorsement of
officials' pleas for commuters to use public transportation to ease
congestion caused by closure of the damaged Bay Bridge, collapse of
double-decked Interstate 880 in Oakland and damage to other
Northern California roads and bridges.
   About the same time, workers demolishing the I-880 structure
removed the flattened car in which longshoreman Buck Helm amazingly
survived four days before his rescue. Helm remained in serious
condition at Highland Hospital.
   In Sacramento, Gov. George Deukmejian and state lawmakers
announced that a special session of the Legislature will convene
Thursday to consider legislation to help fund quake relief. Damage
has been estimated at more than $7 billion.
   The governor proposed a temporary quarter-cent increase in the
state's 6 percent sales tax. Beginning Dec. 1 and lasting 13
months, it would raise $800 million to pay the state's estimated
share of repairing public buildings and highways and providing
grants to families and assistance to local governments.
   According to a Los Angeles Times poll published Monday, 52
percent of 1,377 Californians surveyed would support a sales tax
increase to pay for earthquake repairs and to aid victims.
   The governor also said the state might have to dip into its $1.1
billion emergency reserve if costs prove to be higher, Deukmejian
said.
   Congress last week approved $3.5 billion for California
earthquake relief.
   The state transportation department director, Robert Best, said
$1.8 billion is the projected cost of repairing state and local
roads, including retrofitting all highway bridges in the state to
make them earthquake safe.
   The federal funds include $1 billion for highways. Best said he
hopes more federal money will be allocated once damage estimates
are firmed up.
   Elsewhere, state schools superintendent Bill Honig said public
schools suffered comparatively little damage because of strict
school construction standards, but repairs still will cost more
than $50 million.
   Seven of the 1,482 schools in the eight hardest-hit counties had
severe damage to buildings with classrooms. Five buildings without
classrooms also were damaged. Honig said 95 percent of students
returned to school in two days.
   Around the San Francisco Bay area, the San Francisco Convention
and Visitors Bureau, the Hyatt hotel corporation and Oakland
businesses began preparing advertising campaigns to keep the
tourists and their dollars coming to the region.
   ``We're doing a lot because the world thinks we've tumbled into
the bay,'' said Charles McElroy, general manager of the
Hyatt-Regency in San Francisco.

   The captain of the aircraft carrier USS
Lexington praised his crew's performance after the crash-landing of
a training jet that killed five people dead and sent flames rolling
across the flight deck.
   The crash killed the pilot, three sailors and a civilian
technician, and injured 19 aboard the Lexington, a training ship
fondly called ``Lady Lex'' because it is the Navy's only carrier
that allows female sailors. One of the 180 women in the crew of
1,440 was among those killed.
   ``Members of the crew responded superbly. They demonstrated they
were very well-trained and they moved. Their shipmates were injured
and they did all that they could to take care of them,'' said Capt.
C. Flack Logan after the ship arrived at its home port here Monday.
   One crew member who said she never thought of running for safety
was Airman Dee Votolato, a camera operator who kept her videotape
running until the instant the T-2 Buckeye jet crashed at her feet
Sunday and cartwheeled in flames.
   Ms. Votolato, 21, of Houma, La., was knocked to the deck when
the jet flipped upside down and crashed into the carrier's tower.
But she got back up and kept taping as shipmates put out a fire.
   ``The women were in fighting the fire, taking the medical
precautions, taking every step the men were taking,'' Ms. Votolato
said. ``A ship is not a beautiful place, it's not, but when you are
here to do your job and when get the job done you are not a woman,
you are a sailor.''
   Within 12 seconds of the crash, the first fire hoses turned on
the flames and the main blaze was extinguished in about two
minutes, Logan said.
   Two separate investigations will be conducted, as is routine in
such accidents, Logan said. Safety investigators will watch the
videotape and try to determine what caused the accident while the
Judge Advocate General's staff will look for possible wrongdoing.
   Aboard another Navy vessel Monday, a U.S. warplane accidentally
dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided-missile crusier USS Reeves
during maneuvers in the Indian Ocean. The bomb left a 5-foot hole
in the main deck and five sailors were slightly injured, the Navy
said.
   The Lexington crash took place in near-perfect flying weather
when the ship was in the Gulf of Mexico, about 30 miles south of
Pensacola, Logan said, adding that the pilot didn't report
mechanical problems. Ms. Votolato said the plane was coming in too
low, appeared to overcorrect and climbed at a steep angle before
flipping upside down and hitting the ship.
   ``As I see it,'' Logan said, ``he ended up in a position, which
in naval aviation is known as being low and slow, which is a very
terrible place to be when you are coming aboard a ship.''
   Landing signal officers radioed the pilot to add power and waved
him off, but for some reason the airplane was unable to comply,
Logan said.
   The pilot, Ensign Steven E. Pontell, 23, of Columbia, Md., was
making his first attempt to land on a carrier, Logan said. He was
the only one aboard the two-seat trainer, as is normal when
aviators make their first carrier landings.
   Pontell was a member of Training Squadron 19 at Meridian (Miss.)
Naval Air Station and was a 1988 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy.
   Also killed were Petty Officer 3rd Class Burnett Kilgore Jr.,
19, of Holly Springs, Miss.; Petty Officer 3rd Class Timmy L.
Garroutte, 30, of Memphis, Tenn., and Airman Lisa L. Mayo, 25, of
Oklahoma City, all Lexington crew members; and Byron Gervis
Courvelle, 32, of Meridian, Miss., a civilian employee of DynCorp,
which has a contract to maintain Navy aircraft. All four were
killed on the flight deck.
   Ms. Mayo had joined the Navy only four months ago, said her
mother, Doris Fant of Oklahoma City. The mother said she didn't
blame the death on her daughter's choice of career.
   ``I feel that she made a decision, that that's what she wanted
to do,'' Mrs. Fant said. ``You can't fail unless you try.''
   Two of the 19 others injured remained hospitalized, the most
serious in critical by stable condition.

<UNK>Compensation For Quartet Wrongly Convicted In IRA Bombing</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three people jailed for 14 years on a wrongful
conviction for an Irish Republican Army bombing will each get
$79,000 as an interim compensation payment, the government said
today.
   Paul Hill, the fourth person wrongly convicted in the 1974
bombing that killed five people in Guildford, southwest of London,
will get $15,800, officials said.
   Home Office Minister John Patten said in a statement to
Parliament on Monday that the so-called Guildford Four would each
get an initial payment. His aides, requesting anonymity, specified
the amounts later.
   The four were freed last week after the country's second-ranking
judge, Lord Lane, quashed the convictions, ruling that police
officers probably lied at the trial.
   Hill, 35, was also serving a life sentence on a separate
conviction of murdering a British soldier in Belfast, Northern
Ireland. He was freed on bail pending an appeal.
   The others, Gerard Conlon, 35, and Patrick Armstrong, 39, both
from Belfast, and a London woman, Carole Richardson, 32, were freed
unconditionally.
   The ruling, after a prolonged campaign to exonerate the four,
has damaged the reputation of the police and led to demands for
reopening of other cases. The government has ordered an inquiry
into the police conduct in the Guildford case.
   Britain's recently retired top legal officer, Lord Hailsham,
said appeal judges were right to turn down previous appeals by the
Guildford Four on the evidence then available.
   ``I cannot see how you can blame the piano because someone
strikes the wrong note or blows a computer because someone feeds it
false information,'' Hailsham said in a television interview on
Monday.

   The dollar fell marginally against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index bounced back with
a moderate gain.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average recouped 132.00 points, or
0.37 percent, ending at 35,549.44. It had shed 109.85 points Monday.
   Dealers said the index recovered after losses in the last two
trading days although afternoon trading lacked direction as
participants' interests became widespread.
   Masahiro Umemori, a Nomura Securities analyst, said the index's
uptrend slowed toward the end of the afternoon session, but it
remained higher as some participants picked up electricals.
   Among winners were trading houses and real estate issues,
following news reports that Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co. acquired
a majority of Rockefeller Group, Inc., dealers said.
   The dollar finished at 142.15 yen, down 0.02 yen from Monday's
142.17-yen close. It opened higher at 142.32 yen, and ranged
between 142.12 yen and 142.50 yen.
   ``The currrency trading was boring today,'' said Toru Kanai, a
foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities, Co. in Tokyo.
   He said some investors bought the dollar in early morning
trading prior to their end-of-the-month account settlement.
   But other market players pushed the U.S. currency down when it
hit the 142.50-yen line for profit-taking, Kanai said.
   Other traders said trading was slow ahead of a series of U.S.
economic data to be released later this week. The U.S. jobless
rate, which is watched most closely, is due out Friday.

   Vietnam has agreed to work to resolve
the cases of about 80 more U.S. soldiers missing from the Vietnam
War and other Americans reported lost in Laos, a U.S. envoy said
today after talks in Hanoi.
   John W. Vessey Jr. said he presented the Vietnamese with two new
lists totalling about 70 ``discrepancy cases'' involving the loss
of about 80 Americans in the war.
   ``Discrepancy cases'' are those to which the United States has
assigned highest priority. They are cases that the Vietnamese
should have information, according to U.S. officials.
   They include servicemen who were believed to have been taken
prisoner but were not freed when the U.S. involvement in the war
ended in 1973.
   Vessey told a news conference he also asked the Vietnamese to do
research on ``similar types of cases'' over the border in Laos. The
war spilled over into Laos, which North Vietnam used as a sanctuary
to fight U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
   ``The Vietnamese accepted both the suggestions that we made,''
Vessey said. He held two days of talks ending Sunday with Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach.
   It was Vessey's second mission to Vietnam as presidential envoy.
During his August 1987 trip, he presented the Vietnamese with 70
cases. Specialists from both sides are now involved in their eighth
joint field investigation to resolve those cases.
   Vessey said 19 of the 70 cases have already been resolved
through the discovery of remains.
   In other cases, he said, ``we've gained new information but
they're still inconclusive and others, we don't know any more than
we did when we started out.''
   He said his team urged the Vietnamese to go back over the
unresolved cases and find soldiers or other witnesses who know
something about them.
   ``If the man is alive, we want him back. If he is not alive,
we'd like to be able to tell his family what happened to him,''
Vessey said.
   Vietnam says it is not holding any live Americans.
   Vessey said he also exchanged views with Thach on the conflict
in Cambodia, where a Vietnamese-installed government is fighting
guerrillas backed by the United States and other countries. The
United States has said it will not establish diplomatic ties with
Hanoi until it helps resolve the conflict.
   Vessey declined to give details but said Thach ``clarified'' his
government's position on Cambodia.
   Vessey's delegation to Hanoi included senior officials of the
Defense and State Departments and Ann Mills Griffiths, the head of
the private National League of Families of American Prisoners and
Missing in Southeast Asia.
   A U.S. Embassy official said Mrs. Griffiths and David F.
Lambertson, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian
affairs, would visit Laos for talks Nov. 2 to 3 on accounting for
missing soldiers there.

   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., is putting a hold on
the confirmation of James Cason as assistant secretary of
agriculture because he thinks Cason is a ``James Watt clone.''
   ``I think he would be a disaster,'' Reid said Monday of
President Bush's nominee to head forest and conservation programs
at the Agriculture Department.
   Reid's action postpones full Senate consideration of Cason until
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell removes the hold.
   Reid said if Cason's confirmation is taken up on the floor,
``I'll talk for a real long time,'' implying a filibuster to tie up
Senate business.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has been urging the Senate
to confirm Cason as quickly as possible, stressing to senators he
expects Cason to follow the environmental agenda he sets.
   ``He feels confident that Jim Cason is the person to do the
job,'' said Yeutter's spokeswoman, Kelly Shipp.
   ``In terms of policy, the buck stops with Clayton Yeutter,''
said Shipp. ``It's unfair to allege that Cason would be the sole
person here at USDA making natural resources policy.''
   Reid said he feels strongly because 87 percent of the land in
Nevada is owned by the federal government. When James Watt was
Interior Secretary under President Reagan, Watt's pro-development
policies harmed environmental interests in the state, said Reid.
   ``I think he (Cason) is a James Watt clone,'' said Reid.
   Cason was hired at the Interior Department while Watt was
secretary, but when questioned during confirmation hearings about
Watt, Cason said he barely knew him.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., also
opposes Cason, but the committee voted 12-7 to send the nomination
to the full Senate.
   Reid does not serve on the committee.
   ``I spent a lot of my career developing a national park in
Nevada, the last one created by the government, the Great Basin
National Park,'' said Reid. ``He (Cason) authorized a mining in the
parks rule that weakened strip mining restrictions.''
   Although that decision has not affected Great Basin, Reid said
he feels protective of the parks.
   Cason, 35, has held a variety of high-ranking posts at the
Interior Department since the early days of the Reagan
administration. Leahy accused him of consistently putting private
interests ahead of public ones.
   For example, he said Cason suppressed a report that said the
spotted owl would be endangered if logging were conducted in
certain forests in the Pacific Northwest.
   Cason said that only withheld the report to get more information.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., a member of the committee, had
threatened to put a hold on the confirmation process, saying he
wanted to know more about Cason's sale of 82,000 acres of federal
oil shale land at $2.50 an acre.
   The government sold the land for $17,000 to private interests
who weeks later sold it for about $37 million.
   Meanwhile, the League of Conservation Voters has sent a letter
to all 100 senators saying their votes on Cason will be noted as
the organization prepares its environmental scorecard.
   ``Mr. Cason has a record of antagonism toward environmental
protection, mismanagement, and fiscal irresponsibility,'' the
letter said. ``Surely the president can find someone better to fill
his slot.''

   Farmers who are growing substitute crops on
land where drought destroyed or damaged earlier plantings will be
able to get a break on federal aid under a new law.
   President Bush on Monday signed a bill that eases restrictions
on federal farm-disaster aid.
   The revised rules protect winter wheat and cotton farmers who
otherwise might have been denied disaster payments for their lost
crops under an Agriculture Department plan, even though the
producers expect to earn little or no profit on replacement crops
such as grain sorghum or soybeans.
   Under the Agriculture Department's initial plan, even farmers
who had replanted only a few acres would have to wait until they
harvested their second crop before they could obtain disaster
benefits for damage to the first crop.

   A closed courtroom in rural New Hampshire
has become a battleground for deciding when parental discipline
becomes so harsh that the state must intervene.
   The state has asserted a right to protect the children of
Stephen and JoAnn DeCosta by filing felony assault charges against
them and by taking their four children, ages 3 to 14, on grounds
that the parents abused the two youngest in beatings administered
with a stick and a paddle.
   But the DeCostas and their supporters, many of them fellow
parishioners at a fundamentalist church that advocates strict
child-rearing, say the state has no business intruding into a
matter as private as disciplining children.
   ``It comes down to this: Who owns the kids, the state or the
parents?'' asked Bill Taylor, a friend of the DeCostas.
   Taylor and others have sat for many hours this fall outside
Plymouth District Court as Judge Edwin Kelly hears testimony on
whether the state Division for Children and Youth Services was
justified in taking the children.
   Character witnesses for the DeCostas have included friends such
as former Gov. Meldrim Thomson and State Police Lt. David McCarthy,
whose children attend a church-run school with the three oldest
DeCosta children.
   In Rumney, a small town in the southern White Mountains where
the DeCostas live, rumors have circulated about the case for weeks,
frustrating the family and supporters who say they want to talk but
cannot because state law prohibits it. The law makes it a
misdemeanor to discuss what goes on at a civil child abuse or
neglect hearing.
   No such restrictions apply to a criminal indictment issued Oct.
19 by a Grafton County grand jury. The indictment accused each
parent of second-degree assault. Court papers do not say who
brought the matter to police or indicate what prompted the
DeCostas' actions.
   The charges allege the parents beat their two youngest children,
a 7-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter, with a stick and a paddle
until the children's buttocks were red and bruised. Arraignment is
scheduled Nov. 20.
   The DeCostas' lawyer, Andrew McEvoy, called the indictments
``legally insufficient.'' He argued that the documents do not say
that the alleged victims were their children, and that the alleged
attack took place when the parents were punishing their children
for misbehaving.
   Judy Bell, a lawyer for Children and Youth Services, would not
discuss the case, but said the state doesn't deny parents the right
to discipline their children physically. She said the agency does
insist that there are limits _ though it isn't clear exactly where.
   ``I think that that's the question that everyone would like to
have answered, to actually have a line drawn,'' Bell said.
   She said the agency's goal in every case is to bring the family
back together.
   ``The goal has to be reunification,'' she said.
   The three youngest children are now living with a family that
attends DeCostas' church; the oldest lives with another family
nearby.
   DeCosta, 48, who operates an auto transmission repair shop next
to his home, declined to comment on the case. ``I can't talk about
it. I can't even contact my representatives, my elected officials,
so I'm bound by the law,'' he said Monday.
   But his pastor defended the use of the paddle in disciplining
children.
   ``The Bible definitely and expressly teaches the use of the rod
in the discipline of children and we believe in it, and we do it,
and I teach it,'' said Richard Anderson of Meredith, pastor of
Calvary Independent Baptist Church.
   Anderson said he generally teaches that ``spanking should sting
enough to make the point and never be so hard that it would damage
a child.''
   The pastor would not discuss the allegations against the
DeCostas, but said pointedly that if children behave well, do well
in school and are happy, their parents must be doing a good job,
whatever the form or amount of discipline.

   Saving the V-22 Osprey aircraft from Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's budget ax is not an easy task for the
Marine Corps, lawmakers concerned about jobs back home and military
contractors.
   Ever since Cheney told Congress in May that budget constraints
had forced him to propose canceling the $27 billion project to
build the tilt-rotor aircraft, the campaign to spare the Osprey has
been intense.
   The contractors _ Boeing Helicopter of Lester, Pa., and Bell
Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth, Texas _ have filled the airwaves
with television ads showing the helicopter that can fly like an
airplane. Newspapers and magazines carry advertisements
proclaiming, ``V-22 Osprey, Affordability.''
   And key congressional backers of the aircraft, particularly
lawmakers from Pennsylvania and Texas, have fired off ``dear
colleague'' letters that include editorials and articles of praise
for the program.
   Marine Corps officials have even discussed the concept of an
assault support aircraft for the Osprey.
   The effort, however, has not met with much success.
   House and Senate negotiators hammering out a final defense
budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 are considering a
proposal of about $255 million for research and development of the
Osprey but no procurement money. The Osprey's fate likely will be
decided this week as House and Senate negotiators wrap up work on
the defense bill.
   The future of the program would be tied to commercial use of the
V-22, said lawmakers and congressional sources, who requested
anonymity.
   ``The proposal is unacceptable,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa.,
a member of the House Armed Services Committee who has sent a
number of letters to colleagues urging them to support the Osprey.
   ``With just research and development, in effect there will never
be a V-22. ... Continue the funding and a make a decision next
year. But without procurement money, the program is, in fact,
dead,'' Weldon said.
   In proposing to cancel the Osprey, Cheney argued a mix of
conventional helicopters would serve as an alternative to the V-22,
which at $23 million a copy was too expensive.
   Weldon contends Cheney based his decision on inaccurate
information.
   ``Several military witnesses have appeared before the Armed
Services Committee, and all except Secretary Cheney's pencil
pushers are on the record acknowledging that the V-22 costs less
and delivers more capability than DOD's proposed alternatives,''
Weldon said in one letter.
   Rep. David O'B. Martin, R-N.Y., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee and former Navy pilot, said the Bush
administration's alternatives ``aren't any cheaper or as effective
as the Osprey.''
   While lawmakers argued their case, representatives from Bell
Helicopter Textron promoted the V-22 during a recent trade show in
Washington, saying it could have been used during the Panamanian
rebels failed coup attempt against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
to help earthquake victims in northern California.
   ``Delaying (the program) would cause us some grief,'' said Dick
Spivey, the director of V-22 business development.
   Supporters of Cheney's decision say the secretary had to make
the ``hard choices'' and they scoff at the argument the V-22 could
be used in Panama.
   ``That's a little like saying the B-2 can be used to blow up
(Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi's tent,'' said Rep. Andy Ireland,
R-Fla., a member of the Armed Services panel. ``It isn't a good,
hard argument.''
   Meanwhile, Gen. Michael P. Sullivan, director of the Marine
Corps Combat Development Command at Quantico, Va., has talked about
``the concept of an assault support aircraft that would provide
support for the V-22.''
   Congressional sources, who requested anonymity, said the
discussion by the Marine Corps of the support aircraft possibly was
an attempt to bolster the campaign for the V-22.
   But Lt. Col. Robert McLean, spokesman for the center at
Quantico, said the discussion of support aircraft is ``conceptual
only, not something that's in a sort of formal, proposal stage ...
This is not something that has special sponsorship'' of the Marine
Corps.

<HEAD>EPA Says Many Lakes Polluted or Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half of the lake acreage in 34 states
is badly polluted or likely soon to become that way, the
Environmental Protection Agency said today.
   The EPA's latest survey of lake water quality shows that serious
pollution problems have impaired about one-fourth of more than 12
million acres of lakes examined in those states. Pollution
threatens similar impairment in another 20 percent of the lake
acres.
   While the causes for the lake pollution varied, three-fourths of
the pollution was attributed to agricultural and urban runoffs.
Another 11 percent was blamed on industrial or sewage releases and
the remainder to natural causes.
   Meanwhile, the EPA was named in a lawsuit Monday charging that
the agency has failed to develop national standards for toxic
pollution of public waterways.
   Two environmental and public interest groups, the Natural
Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen, claimed in the suit
filed in U.S. District Court that the EPA was violating the Clean
Water Act by allowing millions of pounds of unregulated toxic waste
to be released into waterways.
   ``Over two-thirds of the industrial facilities that release
toxics into our waterways are not covered by nationwide EPA
regulations,'' said Robert Adler of the Natural Resources Defense
Council.
   The suit claimed that at least 70 million pounds of unregulated
toxic wastes are released directly into waterways or through public
sewage systems by sources ranging from pharmaceutical companies to
the mining and textile industries.
   The EPA had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.
   The agency's lake quality report said the most significant cause
of lake impairment was excessive plant and algae growth resulting
from high levels of nutrients being released into the water. Often
those releases came from sewage facilities or agricultural runoff,
the study said.
   Such unwanted plant and algae growth often harms recreational
activity and reduces a lake's scenic value. But more importantly,
the growth depletes necessary oxygen and chokes off other life,
including fish, said Erik Olson, an attorney with the National
Wildlife Association.
   Olson said the EPA findings understate the true problem with
water pollution nationwide because not all pollutants that affect
water quality are included.
   ``If you consider all the pollutants that have potentially
devastating effects on fish and wildlife, perhaps on people as
well, the number (of impaired lake acres) would be significantly
higher,'' maintained Olson in an interview.
   EPA officials acknowledged that the degree of lake pollution has
been difficult to document nationally because of shortcomings in
data collection.
   For example, the new report on lake quality did not include data
from 16 states because they did not report to the EPA. It also did
not include data from the Great Lakes, the country's biggest lake
system, which has had major pollution problems.
   Other reasons for lakes becoming impaired are high levels of
sediment from rocks and soil being deposited into lakes, warm water
discharges that disturb fish habitat and the release of pesticides
and other toxics. According to the report, 15 percent of the
pollution problem on the lakes examined was attributed to metals
and inorganics and another 3 percent to pesticides.
   The study involved lake water quality studies in 34 states with
more than 18 million lake acres. Of those, 12.4 million acres were
assessed and 45 percent were determined to be either impaired or
threatened with impairment.

<HEAD>Democrats Say Dole Gas Tax Idea Needs Bush Backing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House rejection of Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole's suggestion for higher federal gasoline taxes
means the idea will go nowhere in Congress, say Democratic House
and Senate leaders.
   Consistent with President Bush's campaign promise to not raise
taxes, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater deflected the
proposal Monday.
   ``We do not feel that an increase in federal gas taxes is
necessary at this time,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   On NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' program Sunday, Dole, R-Kan.,
said he would support an increase in the 9.1-cent-per-gallon
gasoline tax ``for rebuilding the infrastructure, not for debt
reduction.''
   But top Democrats said Monday that Dole's endorsement for the
idea meant little without Bush's backing.
   ``Before it goes through Congress, we would have to be ensured
of the president's support,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash. Foley said he favors raising the fuel levy to rebuild
crumbling roads.
   ``He (Bush) has veto power, and there's no way to override a
veto on a tax increase, that's for sure,'' said Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``So there's no point going
through the exercise.''
   Democrats _ who have learned painfully in recent elections that
voters oppose higher taxes _ have been loath to push any major
revenue legislation without lining up presidential approval in
advance.
   Dole, who unsuccessfully challenged Bush for his party's
presidential nomination last year, has supported tax increases for
specified purposes before.
   He originally supported the income surcharge on the elderly to
pay for Medicare coverage of extended illnesses, a program Congress
enacted last year and now is in the process of rolling back. He has
also favored an oil import fee.
   Dole did not suggest an amount for a gasoline tax increase.
Officials estimate that for each penny increase, the levy would
raise an additional $1 billion.
   Other lawmakers from both parties _ Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee,
and members of the Senate and House panels that oversee public
works _ have previously suggested boosting the gasoline tax.
   Some have suggested using the money for road programs, while
others have said it would be a good way to reduce the federal
deficit, which reached $152 billion last year.
   A penny-a-gallon gasoline tax first took effect in 1932. The
most recent increase occurred Jan. 1, 1987, when it was raised by
one-tenth of one cent to pay for cleaning up leaky underground fuel
tanks.
   Of the rest, all but one cent goes to road and bridge work. The
remaining penny is for mass transit assistance.

<HEAD>Pierce's Lawyer Complains Government Won't Pay Legal Fees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr.'s
attorney says the Justice Department is stretching regulations to
avoid paying Pierce's legal bills from a congressional
investigation.
   A Justice Department spokesman said the agency's ruling was
based on a legal interpretation.
   But attorney Robert Plotkin said the Justice Department offered
an ``off-the-wall'' reason why regulations did not qualify Pierce
for reimbursement of private legal fees arising from a House
subcommittee's probe of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   The former secretary twice refused to answer questions when he
appeared before the House Government Operations employment and
housing subcommittee, which has conducted hearings on mismanagement
and political favoritism in the award of HUD grants during Pierce's
tenure.
   Pierce asked HUD to pay his legal expenses because they arose
from questions about his performance of official duties in the
Reagan administration.
   But the Justice Department, asked by HUD to rule on the request,
said two weeks ago that the department has no responsibility to
represent Pierce and therefore wouldn't rule on whether he
qualified for reimbursement of private legal fees.
   Department spokesman David Runkel said ``our decision was based
on the civil division's interpretation of the law. The lawyers took
a look at it and that's their decision.''
   ``It's a hot potato,'' said Plotkin. ``HUD hands off to Justice,
Justice hands off back to HUD.''
   The Justice Department, Plotkin said, stretched the clear
meaning of the regulations to say it wasn't responsible for
representing Pierce.
   ``I couldn't believe that of several potential grounds that
perhaps they might have used to justify not paying it, the one they
used seemed so off-the-wall,'' Plotkin said.
   The regulation says current and former federal officials ``may
be provided representation in civil and congressional proceedings
and in state criminal proceedings ... when the actions for which
representation is requested reasonably appear to have been
performed within the scope of the employee's employment and
providing representation would otherwise be in the interest of the
United States.''
   ``One would think that clearly on it's face we are eligible,''
Plotkin said. ``And then they have to exercise their discretion as
to whether or not they want to pay it.''
   But in an Oct. 25 letter to HUD, Deputy Assistant Attorney
General Stephen C. Bransdorfer said legal representation by the
Justice Department ``is available only in situations where the
employee is subject to civil or state criminal proceedings as a
result of actions taken within the normal scope of that employee's
authority.
   ``If there are no such underlying proceedings then
representation is not available,'' Bransdorfer said.
   There are no civil or state criminal proceedings against Pierce.
   HUD said that based on Bransdorfer's determination, Pierce's
request was denied.
   Plotkin declined to describe the size of his law firm's legal
bill, saying only that he had been prepared to negotiate with the
Justice Department over what expenses the government would pay.

   The Navy accident in which a fighter jet pilot
dropped a bomb on the guided missile cruiser USS Reeves was at
least the sixth aboard a Navy ship since the April 19 explosion on
the battleship USS Iowa.
   The 500-pound bomb, which officials said was ``inadvertently''
dropped on the ship Monday, blew a five-foot hole in its bow and
injured five sailors.
   Navy officials are questioning the pilot of the fighter, which
had just taken off from the carrier USS Midway. The carrier was
being escorted by the Reeves during training operations in the
Indian Ocean.
   The turret explosion aboard the USS Iowa in April killed 47
sailors.
   The other accidents, not counting sailors lost overboard,
include:
   _Oct. 29. Five sailors are killed aboard the training carrier
USS Lexington, including a Navy student pilot and four members of
the deck crew. Nineteen others were injured.

   Contrary to reports of deadlines and imminent
showdowns, Secretary of State James A. Baker III says he does not
expect a ``make-or-break'' decision on Mideast negotiations while
he is on an eight-day visit to Australia.
   Baker is leaving late tonight for talks with Prime Minister Bob
Hawke and also to attend a meeting in Canberra of 12 nations
considering the formation of a new economic compact to foster free
trade and an open-market system.
   Known as the Pacific Basin initiative, it has Baker's support as
timely because the United States is boosting trade with Asia to new
heights. Trade has more than tripled in 10 years to $280 billion in
1988, a senior U.S. official said Monday.
   Ten Asian nations, but not China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, are
attending, along with the United States and Canada. Some,
especially Japan, have been accused at times of protectionist
policies.
   But the Canberra meeting is designed ``to put pressure to open
markets around the world,'' said the U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Open market systems tend to be associated
with greater freedom.''
   As he prepared to depart, Baker said he was reviewing his
five-point proposal for Mideast talks at Israel's request. But, he
told The Associated Press in an interview Monday: ``I don't
anticipate we will have definitive answers _ either yes or no _
before I get back from Australia.''
   He said Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens may be traveling in
Asia during the period, and ``we may continue to talk.'' But, Baker
added: ``I would guide you off of looking for either a make or
break on this thing before the trip is over.''
   Arens last week notified Baker the Israeli government accepted
the U.S. proposal _ but with two provisos. They were that the
Palestine Liberation Organization be excluded from any Israeli
meeting with Palestinians and that the agenda be limited to
preparations for an election on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir proposed the election, with U.S.
endorsement, as a way of having Palestinians choose their
representative to negotiate five years of limited self-rule in the
territories. The PLO, which Israel shuns, contends it is the sole
representative of the Palestinians.
   Baker's proposal gave Israel assurances it would talk only to a
Palestinian delegation it found satisfactory. He also said he was
not pressuring Israel to deal with the PLO.
   Recent reports from Israel suggest Baker is close to a decision
on whether to keep trying. Shamir was quoted last Tuesday as saying
there was ``no large gap'' between the two approaches and ``in a
few days we will know if there is an agreement or not.''
   But Baker disputed his month-long effort was at a critical point.
   ``I have not put any deadlines down and we will continue to try
and work the problem,'' he said. ``But I really don't anticipate
it's going to make or break before we get back from Australia.''

   The only FBI agent ever convicted of
espionage walked out of prison with a smile on his face as he was
released on $337,000 bond to await a third trial.
   After five years behind bars, Richard Miller was released from
custody Monday afternoon, said Charles Almanza, supervisor of court
operations for the U.S. Marshal's Office.
   The 52-year-old former agent is accused of passing secret U.S.
documents to his lover, Soviet emigre Svetlana Ogorodnikov. Mrs.
Ogorodnikov and her husband, Nikolay, pleaded guilty in the case
and are serving federal prison terms.
   Miller's 1985 trial ended with jurors unable to reach a verdict.
A second jury convicted him in 1986 and U.S. District Judge David
Kenyon sentenced him to two life terms plus 50 years in prison. The
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in April,
ruling that Kenyon erred in allowing lie-detector evidence.
   Although Miller declined to meet with reporters after his
release, he had issued a statement earlier in the day in
anticipation of his being freed.
   ``I am hopeful that in a fair trial the truth will come out and
I can be vindicated,'' he said.
   ``After five years in prisons I need a little time with my
family and my lawyers before answering your questions,'' he added.
``I did not betray my country.''
   Earlier Monday, Kenyon scheduled Miller's third trial for April
3, 1990.
   Miller's release was delayed by the prosecution's review of bond
papers to ensure that property put up for bail was accurately
described to the court.
   Miller's sister, brother and a friend each had put up property
to secure his release.
   Miller, who has been imprisoned since his Oct. 2, 1984, arrest,
appeared briefly in court Monday with his hands shackled behind his
back.
   Clad in a gray suit, he gave a thumb's up sign to relatives in
the courtroom.
   Later, when he was released from jail, he had a smile on his
face, said his attorney, Stanley Greenberg.
   Prosecutors portrayed Miller as an ineffectual agent whose
bitterness over his undistinguished FBI career made him an easy
target for Soviet spy recruiters.
   They said the 20-year FBI veteran was planning to travel to
Vienna with Mrs. Ogorodnikov to meet with Soviet intelligence
agents.
   Miller went to FBI agents on Sept. 27, 1984, and revealed his
relationship with Mrs. Ogorodnikov. However, he has maintained he
was trying to redeem his FBI career by infiltrating the Soviet KGB.

   Friends grieved for eight high-school
athletes and two educators who were among 20 killed in a plane
crash that shocked this community so deeply one person lamented,
``Our lifeblood is gone.''
   Across the close-knit rural island, people flew streamers of
green and white _ the Molokai High School colors _ from their car
antennas in memory of those lost when a commuter plane crashed
Saturday, killing everyone aboard.
   ``It's small enough here so that everybody knows each other,''
said the Rev. Robb Kojima of Kalaiakamanu Hou Congregational
Church. ``It's almost like the feeling when the (space shuttle)
Challenger blew up. In the same sense, we all feel the grief.''
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
arrived Monday to study the wreckage of the Aloha IslandAir de
Havilland Twin Otter, which slammed into a ridge near Halawa Valley
on the eastern end of the island during a flight from neighboring
Maui. Rescuers recovered the bodies Sunday from the charred
wreckage.
   There was no indication the pilot knew he was in trouble, said
NTSB acting Chairman James Kolstad, who heads the agency's
investigation team here.
   Thirteen victims were Molokai residents. Eight were members of
the school's volleyball teams returning from a tournament, the
coach of the girls' team and the school's athletic director. Also
killed were a honeymooning couple from Philadelphia, a couple from
Houston, a Maui island resident and the plane's pilot and co-pilot,
who live in Honolulu.
   A special assembly was held at the 655-student school Monday,
but the grief spread across the island of 6,000.
   ``This island, we're like a big family. When one hurts, everyone
hurts,'' said Wilma Grambusch, a Molokai High teacher. ``This is a
true tragedy. They're our young people. Our lifeblood is gone.''
   The Rev. Rick Lazor of Kaunakakai Baptist Church urged students
to help each other, particularly a group of athletes who caught an
earlier flight home and were suffering from what he called
``survival guilt.''
   ``You need to be there for each other today,'' Lazor told the
assembly.
   The twin-engine plane was 16 years old and had made 28,000
flights, said Peter Dudgeon, Aloha IslandAir's vice president and
general manager.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said there were no recent
reports of service difficulties or accidents.
   The airline has been negotiating to acquire more hangar space at
Honolulu International Airport because mechanics now service planes
in the open, Dudgeon said recently.
   However, Aloha IslandAir spokeswoman Stephanie Ackerman said
Monday the situation didn't affect the quality of maintenance.
   ``The maintenance is still thorough and complete where we are
now,'' Ms. Ackerman said. ``If it wasn't the FAA would know about
it.''
   Pete Beckner, an FAA manager of the Honolulu flight standards
office, said Aloha IslandAir wasn't required to have an enclosed
maintenance area. There weren't any pending maintenance complaints
against the airline, he said.
   The plane left Kahului Airport on Maui Saturday evening for a
scheduled 35-minute flight. The wreckage was sighted early Sunday,
spread over 300 feet.
   There was no distress call from the crew, authorities said.
   The plane had neither a flight-data recorder nor cockpit voice
recorder because that equipment isn't required of small commuter
aircraft, the NTSB said.
   The 30-year-old pilot, Capt. Bruce Pollard, had flown for the
airline for two years, Dudgeon said. The first officer was Phil
Helfrich, 27.
   The passenger list included Peter and Elizabeth Wiley,
honeymooners from Philadelphia; John Craig and Christina Batura of
Houston; and Hank Gabriel of Maui.
   The Molokai passengers were girl's volleyball coach Odetta
Rapanot; athletic director John Ino; students Leilani Ahina, Jared
Elia, Lea Dunnam, Natalie Helm, Nancine Mahiai, Aloma Spencer,
Jovencio Ruiz, and Testa Ku; and residents Collette Kekalia, Nancy
Pierce and Rodrigo Senica.

<HEAD>House Members: Re-Opening of American Embassy in Beirut Discussed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The re-opening of the American Embassy in
Beirut is being discussed between U.S. officials and Lebanese
Christians, according to two House members who want a resumption of
diplomatic business in the war-torn country.
   Reps. Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., and Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio,
returned from a 24-hour trip to Beirut over the weekend convinced
the State Department should send some American employees back to
Lebanon. Both lawmakers are of Lebanese descent.
   More than two dozen Americans were evacuated from the embassy
Sept. 6 after Ambassador John McCarthy said the security situation
had deteriorated to the point where safety could not be guaranteed.
   The impetus for the pullout was Gen. Michel Aoun's threat to
subject the Americans to a ``dose of Christian terrorism.'' Aoun,
head of the Christian militias fighting 40,000 Syrian troops based
in Lebanon, also supported sit-ins that had forced the embassy to
be supplied by helicopters.

<HEAD>Military Recruits Show Improved Test Scores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's military recruits have shown
improvements in standard military test scores and educational
background since 1980, according to a congressional study of the
nation's all-volunteer service.
   The study, conducted by the Congressional Budget Office, also
showed that the percentage of blacks among the nation's recruits
has dropped since 1980 but that minorities continue to be
disproportionately represented in the armed forces.
   The report, released Monday, said the results ``represent a
considerable change from the beginning of the decade, when testing
problems and recruiting difficulties resulted in large numbers of
low scorers and non-graduates being accepted for military service.''
   In 1980, less than 70 percent of active-duty recruits for the
armed services had high school diplomas, but seven years later, 94
percent of active-duty recruits had diplomas.

<HEAD>Study Shows `Modest Success' in School Reforms</HEAD>

   Although states made a greater effort to
improve public education in the 1980s than ever before, ``doubts
still linger'' about quality and classroom reforms met with only
``modest success,'' according to a report.
   The Center for Policy Research in Education said Monday that
states have introduced an ``unsurpassed number of education-related
bills, increased state aid, and examined the findings of hundreds
of state-level task forces and commission.''
   The report cited gains in high school curricula, teachers'
salaries and educational funding, but it said ``reforms met with
only modest success in achieving their goals.
   ``Doubts still linger about the rigor and challenge of some of
the new courses in academic subjects, the impact of reform on
at-risk students, the quality of teachers and teaching and the
equitable funding of schools.''
   The federally funded Center for Policy Research in Education is

and the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

<HEAD>Court Document Gives New Details of Unsuccessful Plea Offer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos rejected a plea
bargain last year that the U.S. attorney general told them was
approved by then-President Reagan, Mrs. Marcos' attorney says in
court papers.
   The plea offer was made at a meeting briefly attended by U.S.
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, according to the papers filed
last month by Richard A. Hibey.
   ``The attorney general started the meeting by advising us that
the president was aware that the meeting was taking place, and what
would be conveyed to us during the conference had the president's
full knowledge and approval,'' Hibey said.
   On Oct. 21, 1988, three days after the meeting, the deposed
Philippine leader and his wife were charged in a racketeering
indictment with stealing more than $100 million from their
country's treasury and using the money to buy artwork, real estate
and jewelry in the United States.
   Marcos died Sept. 28. The trial of Mrs. Marcos and co-defendants
including Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi is scheduled to begin
March 14 in U.S. District Court.
   The plea offer was made by then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.
Giuliani, who is now the Republican candidate for mayor, and
Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella, the papers said.
   The president's personal attention in a criminal case is
unusual, but the White House does get involved in sensitive matters
that have implications for foreign policy, government officials
said.
   Justice Department spokesman Dave Runkel and Reagan's spokesman,
Mark Weinberg, declined to comment on the case because it is
pending in the courts.
   After Thornburgh left the meeting, Giuliani described a
``non-negotiable proposal with respect to the disposition of
proposed charges against our clients,'' Hibey said.
   Giuliani said he would go forward with the indictment unless the
Marcoses agreed to his proposal by the end of the business day of
Oct. 20, 1988, according to Hibey. He did not provide any details
of the government's proposal.
   LaBella declined to comment on Hibey's account.
   Published reports at the time of the indictment, citing
unidentified sources, said the offer called for Marcos to forfeit
millions of dollars worth of real estate, artwork and jewelry in
return for a recommendation that he be spared prison.
   Hibey's statement was filed in connection with a pretrial motion
seeking thousands of confidential government documents that Mrs.
Marcos' lawyers say they need to defend her.
   Another Marcos attorney, John Bartko, who was also at the
meeting, said in a separate statement that Mrs. Marcos' lawyers
were seeking documents that might show prior U.S. knowledge of the
Marcoses' allegedly illegal behavior; knowledge that the Marcoses
had substantial assets other than those in the indictment; and U.S.
participation in the overthrow of the Marcos regime.
   In response papers, LaBella called the motion ``a witch's brew
concocted to stultify this prosecution in a bewildering search for
`evidence' that is irrelevant to this fraud case.''
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan has not ruled on the request.

<HEAD>Soviets Think About Taxing Luxuries to Raise Revenue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet lawmakers are considering heavy sales taxes
for cigarettes and beer and raising the price of caviar and other
delicacies as part of efforts to significantly reduce the country's
crippling budget deficit.
   At the same time they are calling for more spending on infants,
the sick and the elderly and suggest that such outlays be funded,
in part, by auctioning the vast fleet of official luxury cars.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature, which is grappling with the
national budget for the first time, is trying to cut an estimated
$143 billion budget deficit to $95 billion at the official rate of
exchange.
   The U.S. budget deficit for the year ending Sept. 30 was $152
billion. The proposed Soviet deficit would be about twice as bad
considering the smaller size of the Soviet economy.
   Selling off government and Communist Party automobiles would
raise $398 million, while a 30 percent tax on tobacco and a 20
percent tax on beer would provide $3.7 billion in revenue,
according to a report issued Monday by Finance Minister Valentin
Pavlov.
   Also suggested were cuts in the losses of state-owned
enterprises, and higher prices on delicacies such as crab, caviar
and tongue.
   Supreme Soviet committees called for $4.3 billion in new
spending on pensions, medicine, orphanage food, maternity hospitals
and other social programs, Pavlov said.
   The budget, originally proposed by the Kremlin and now adjusted
by the legislators, retains the basic bias of previous plans.
Rather than free the market to distribute scarce resources, it adds
privileged allocations for special groups from sick infants to
striking miners.
   Coal miners across the country went on strike in July, returning
to work only after being promised raises and a wealth of shipments
of scarce soap, food and other items. The new budget includes $1.6
billion for wage increases in the coal regions.
   Other appropriations include $512 million for material
encouragement of the fish industry, $111 million for the
Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk regions of Siberia, and $398 million for
raises for the police and other Interior Ministry workers.
   A special appropriation of $1.4 billion for the social needs of
railway workers apparently stems in part from fears that a railroad
strike could quickly cripple the economy. In recent weeks, various
problems on the rail network led to a pileup of millions of tons of
cargo in ports and stations for lack of unloading.
   The government is suggesting cutting oil exports by roughly 2.8
percent or 3.8 million tons per day next year to ease domestic fuel
shortages, according to one budget document.
   The Soviet Union suffers erratic domestic gasoline shortages,
and Soviet television has shown farms unable to harvest grain for
lack of fuel. Officials have warned in recent weeks that continuing
strikes in the coal fields could result in power shortages in the
long Russian winter.
   Budget documents also indicated that planners are running into
difficulties finding enough foreign currency to finance the grain
purchases planned for 1990.
   The Soviet Union announced a drastic devaluation of the value of
the ruble last week from $1.59 to 16 cents, but the lower rate is
limited to the cash transactions of tourists and to Soviet citizens
changing money for travel abroad. The budget figures are converted
to dollars at the old rate.

   A series of explosions that ripped
through an oil field service company sent explosive devices
shooting up to three-quarters of a mile away. Two workers received
minor injuries and 25 mobile homes were damaged.
   ``It was just like cannon fire,'' Police Chief Dean Akings said
in this city about 110 miles northwest of Wichita.
   Monday morning's explosions and fire at Wire Tech Service also
forced evacuation of about 200 people, authorities said. All had
returned home by late Monday except for the 25 families whose
properties were damaged.
   Fire Chief Dick Meisinger said the first blast was caused by
explosives used in the oil industry. About six more explosions and
a fire followed.
   ``There was over 1,000 of those projectiles inside the
business,'' Meisinger said. ``We've had some of those projectiles
located up to three-quarters of a mile away.''

<HEAD>Homeless Man Convicted in Slaying of Pregnant Doctor in Hospital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A homeless man who said he secretly lived in a
hospital storeroom and roamed the corridors in surgeon's garb was
convicted of raping and murdering a pregnant doctor in her office
at the hospital.
   Steven Smith, 23, admitted strangling Dr. Kathryn Hinnant at
Bellevue Hospital on Jan. 7.
   The state court jury rejected Smith's attorney's claim he was
insane and therefore wasn't responsible for the crimes.
   Jurors deliberated less than two hours before accepting the
prosecutor's argument that the insanity plea was a ruse by a
street-smart defendant.
   Ms. Hinnant, 33, who was five months pregnant, was found by her
husband, Eric Johnson, the morning after the killing in her
fourth-floor office in the 1,200-bed hospital.
   The defendant's mother, Marian Smith, said, ``He didn't have a
ghost of a chance with the ghosts in that courtroom.''
   Smith was convicted of all counts: intentional murder, murder
during commission of another felony, rape, robbery and sodomy. He
could be sentenced to a maximum of 50 years to life in prison.
Justice James Leff set sentencing was set for Nov. 21.
   According to testimony, Smith told police he sometimes slept in
a storeroom on the hospital's 22nd floor and walked around
unnoticed in surgical garb and carrying a stethoscope. He claimed
he watched operations, slept in the doctor's quarters and visited
patients' rooms.
   Smith's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, argued that Smith deliberately
left clues at the scene so police would find and hospitalize him.
   As proof of Smith's insanity, Kornberg cited medical records
back to when his client was 14. Almost all say Smith has low
intelligence, delusions, and hallucinations.
   A psychiatrist who testified for the defense said Smith appeared
to have a psychosis related to schizophrenia.
   Smith initially told police he had an accomplice named ``John.''
Kornberg said John was a delusion, that the defendant really
thought this person had punched and raped Hinnant and then helped
him kill her.
   ``The man is mentally sick,'' Kornberg told jurors. ``The man is
not criminally responsible for what he does.''
   But Assistant District Attorney James Kindler argued that Smith
is sane. ``He was aware of what murder was, and he was aware that
Kathryn Hinnant was murdered,'' Kindler said. ``So why is insanity
a defense?''
   Kindler said Smith invented stories about hearing voices,
compulsive behavior and ``John'' because he was trying to escape
responsibility for what he did.
   Smith ``was aware of what he did,'' said juror Alvin Klein, a
drama critic.

<HEAD>In Two Fraud Cases, Boeing to Pay $11 Million, GE Charges on Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing agreed to pay the federal government
$11 million in connection with alleged overcharges on Air Force
contracts but denied wrongdoing.
   Federal officials in Wichita and Washington announced Monday
that Robert L. Dryden, president of Boeing Military Airplanes,
signed the settlement, which the company characterized as a
good-faith disagreement over pricing procedures.
   In Philadelphia, meanwhile, jury selection began in a case in
which General Electric Co. and two employees are charged with
bilking the government of $10 million for a battlefield computer
system.
   Jury selection is expected to be completed by Thursday. GE,
facing its second such fraud case in four years, is charged with
mail fraud and making false statements. The fine could reach $71.9
million.
   In the Kansas case, the Boeing Inc. division did not acknowledge
the validity of the government's claims.
   However, a document reportedly presented to federal grand jurors
contained a company official's calculations of how much money would
be generated by the overcharges.
   Under the settlement, the company must pay the $11 million
within five days. The agreement says Boeing won't face civil or
criminal prosecution in the case, except possible Internal Revenue
Service claims.
   ``We're certainly pleased that an amicable settlement could be
reached,'' said company spokesman Richard L. Ziegler.
   Ziegler refused to discuss the potential IRS liability or how
the alleged overcharges occurred.
   The case involved contracts for new aluminum skins, or outer
coverings, on KC-135 refueling tankers and transports from 1974 to
1986. Government investigators alleged Boeing overcharged for
aluminum raw materials by quoting supplier catalog prices instead
of their actual costs, which were 12 percent to 13 percent less.
   A federal grand jury in Wichita, where the division is based,
heard hundreds of hours of testimony, and inspected thousands of
documents for more than nine months before prosecutors withdrew the
case late last month.
   In Philadelphia, the government also has filed a civil lawsuit
against GE seeking $23 million in overcharges and damages in the
$234 million project from 1983 to 1986.
   Under the no-bid contract, the GE subsidiary Management and
Technical Services Co. in the Philadelphia suburb King of Prussia
was to provide 233 mobile units in five production years beginning
in 1984.
   The government alleges the company padded the costs and failed
to notify the Pentagon of savings negotiated with subcontractors.
   Accused with GE are James Badolato, 41, of Springfield, Pa., and
Gerald A. Leo, 51, of King of Prussia.
   The company and officials have pleaded innocent, although GE
acknowledged an internal investigation uncovered discrepancies
totaling $3.69 million, which the company has refunded.
   GE, the nation's second-largest defense contractor, pleaded
guilty in May 1985 to illegally claiming $800,000 in cost overruns
on Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles and paid a $1.04
million fine.

   A state judge ordered himself and the

complaints that people on court business littered, damaged the
building and took up parking space.
   Judge Michael Conway on Monday entered a judgment that will
require the state to find a new home for the Superior Court.
   The court, which handles misdemeanor cases and motor vehicle and
housing complaints, has occupied the second floor of Killingly Town
Hall for about 20 years, paying $25,000 a year rent for the last
seven years.
   ``We just want 'em out of there,'' said Donald F. Costello,
chairman of the Town Council, which voted last year to ask the
state to move the court. ``The business of the town is the business
of town hall.''
   Conway, whose ruling came on a suit filed by the town in June,
is expected to set a deadline for the move at a Dec. 4 hearing.

   Tammy Faye Bakker, the teary-eyed wife of
former evangelist Jim Bakker, headed home after visiting her
husband, who is serving a 45-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy.
   ``I feel like my heart is hanging on the outside of my chest,''
she said during the visit to her husband, who temporarily is being
held in a nearby medium-security federal prison.
   Since the PTL founder's arrival last week, reporters have been
at the lockup almost daily. And Mrs. Bakker has ventured out into
the community when not visiting her husband, who was convicted of
defrauding his TV followers of more than $3 million.
   After spending much of Sunday with her husband and evading press
scrutiny, Mrs. Bakker went to a dress shop in nearby Sylacauga and
chatted for 45 minutes with sales clerks.
   ``I knew it was Tammy because she had her eyebrows painted on,''
said June Harvey, 28, manager of Cato's Dress Shop. ``Nobody else
looks like that.''
   Mrs. Bakker had talked with reporters earlier in the day, tears
welling in her eyes as she prepared to leave the Colony House Motel
in Talladega for the prison.
   ``This is just so hard; it's so upsetting and I wish I could
just be upset in private,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bakker checked out of the motel Monday afternoon. She told
reporters she planned to visit her husband again before returning
home to Orlando, Fla., to be with their son, Jamie.
   Officials declined to reveal when Bakker would be transferred to
a federal prison in Rochester, Minn.

<HEAD>Says He Will Enter Georgia Governor's Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Lester Maddox, once a flamboyant
symbol of segregation, says his plan to enter the 1990 Democratic
race for governor appears to be a certainty.
   But the 74-year-old Maddox said he will make no official
announcement until January.
   Maddox, who announced last year he would enter the race if no
conservative Democratic candidate came forward to challenge the
party's national establishment, released a statement Monday of his
intentions.
   Lt. Gov. Zell Miller, state Rep. Lauren ``Bubba'' McDonald and
state Sen. Roy Barnes have formally entered the Democratic race,
and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young has indicated he will run.
   On the Republican side, state Rep. Johnny Isakson and former
Superior Court Judge Greeley Ellis are running.
   ``It is true that a number of candidates have announced or
promised to announce,'' Maddox said. ``Most are men I personally
know as good men.''
   Maddox contended, though, that ``they are all followers and
captives of the political establishment without conservative
records, and in my judgment could not be elected as a Democratic
candidate for governor of Georgia in 1990.''
   Maddox called the other Democratic contenders ``a bunch of
look-alikes'' who need campaign consultants to create an image.
   Although he has been treated for cancer, Maddox said his health
is ``fantastic'' and he doesn't consider himself too old for the
office.
   Maddox, who was Georgia governor from 1967 to 1971, later was
lieutenant governor under then-Gov. Jimmy Carter.
   Maddox gained national attention before he became governor by
selling his restaurant rather than serving blacks.
   Yet, despite fears of a segregationist administration, Maddox
named more blacks to high state office when he was governor than
any of his predecessors and adopted a moderate approach to racial
issues.

<TEXT>
   The search for an 11-year-old boy who
was abducted at gunpoint last week intensified after a motorist
reported seeing a young man and a boy in a car stopped along a
road, the FBI said.
   About 35 sheriff's deputies, city police and state patrolmen
searched four south-central Minnesota counties Monday for a sign of
Jacob Wetterling. Authorities arrested a man who was driving a
white Chevrolet, which matched the motorist's description of the
vehicle.
   But the motorist later failed to identify the man in a photo
lineup, authorities said.
   Elsewhere, searchers hunted in an Oregon gold mine for a missing
boy, while authorities in West Sacramento, Calif., recovered the
remains of an 8-year-old boy who was missing for two months.
   In Minnesota, FBI spokesman Byron Gigler said a 19-year-old
motorist on Monday saw a boy and a man in his 20s get into a car on
a road near Hector, 75 miles west of Minneapolis and 60 miles south
from where Jacob was abducted.
   The motorist said he went over to see if the had car trouble,
but the man and boy drove off. He said the man showed something
that looked like a gun.
   The boy was described as being 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches _ about
the size as Jacob _ and was wearing a red jacket similar to the one
Jacob wore when he was abducted a week ago from his home in St.
Joseph, police said.
   Less than an hour after the motorist's sighting, a Carver County
deputy sheriff spotted an eastbound car near Victoria _ 45 miles
east of Hector _ matching the general description of the other car,
said Eden Prairie Police Capt. Jim Clark.
   The driver, a Minneapolis man, was arrested for carrying two
handguns without a permit, Clark said. The man, whose name was not
released, was alone in the car. He was being held on the gun
charges.
   Gigler said authorities will look today for other white
Chevrolets.
   Jacob, a top student and hockey player, was abducted at gunpoint
by a masked man on a dark stretch of road less than a mile from his
home on Oct. 22. The abduction occurred as Jacob, his 10-year-old
brother, Trevor, and an 11-year-old friend were returning home.
   The abductor grabbed Jacob and threatened to shoot the other two
unless they ran into the woods.
   Gigler said authorities on Monday called off a ground search in
the township where the abduction occurred. About 225 National
Guardsmen and about 80 state workers had combed the 36-square mile
area over the weekend without finding clues to the abduction.
   In south-central Oregon, authorities searched for 9-year-old
Nathan Madsen in an abandoned gold mine after someone told them
about the little-known mine. The boy, on horseback, disappeared
Oct. 22 while on a family cattle roundup. Today, divers are
expected to search bogs and sinkholes in the area.
   In California, skeletal remains of 8-year-old Ysidro Valles was
found Sunday by a passer-by in an isolated area near the Sacramento
River, police said. The boy vanished two months ago from his
Sacramento home. An autopsy Monday found that the death was a
homicide, but police released no further details.

   An Army sergeant charged with running a ring
that sold NATO secrets reportedly was recruited 15 years ago by a
Hungarian who immigrated to the United States, fought in Vietnam
and served as an Army captain in Germany.
   The captain, Zoltan Szabo, now retired, left Hungary in 1956,
became a U.S. citizen and joined the Army, ABC news reported Monday.
   He fought in Vietnam and was decorated for bravery, but spent
much of his military career in West Germany with the 8th Infantry
Division.
   In 1967, Szabo made his first contacts as a spy for Hungary's
secret service, ABC said, citing documents, unidentified
investigators and unidentified members of the spy ring.
   In 1974, he recruited then-Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad, who was
arrested Aug. 23, 1988, in West Germany and is awaiting trial there
on a charge of high treason, ABC said. Conrad is accused of selling
NATO secrets to Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   Szabo lives in neutral Austria and so can't be touched by West
German authorities, said Alexander Prechtel, chief spokesman for
the federal prosecutor's office.
   ``The Austrians have not permitted any extradition, and are not
pursuing him, because under Austrian law what Szabo is said to have
done is not punishable. And this did take place in Austria,''
Prechtel told The Associated Press.
   The FBI is investigating at least a dozen people believed to
have worked with Conrad, who operated one of the biggest rings
spying on the United States since World War II, ABC said.
   The FBI expects to arrest at least one other person before
Christmas, the network said.
   German authorities aren't pursuing other members of the
purported ring, Prechtel said, noting the prosecutor's authority in
military spy cases extends only to ``non-active soldiers.''
   ``We are not investigating in this direction,'' the spokesman
said.
   ABC said the documents Conrad and Szabo copied or stole included
NATO's plans for fighting a war against the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact,
including detailed descriptions of nuclear weapons and plans for
movement of troops, tanks and aircraft.
   Except for a 14-month period in the United States, Conrad served
with the 8th Infantry in Bad Kreuznach, West Germany, about 50
miles from Frankfurt, from 1975 through 1985.
   Quoting an alleged member of the spy ring, ABC said Conrad, who
was in charge of a vault where all the 8th Infantry Division's
secret documents were kept, took suitcases stuffed with classified
papers out of the base.
   He then copied pages of documents with a 35mm camera, a copying
machine and even a home video camera, ABC said.
   Citing investigative documents, ABC said Conrad once tricked the
CIA into paying at least $70,000 for parts of a classified U.S.
document he had already stolen and sold to Hungary.
   ABC also reported that one of Conrad's recruits continued to
work for Conrad after returning to the United States, illegally
exporting hundreds of thousands of advanced computer chips to the
East Bloc through a phony company in Canada.
   If convicted, Conrad faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   A statement from the federal prosecutor's office in Frankfurt
said Conrad received $1 million from the Hungarians and $100,000
from the Czechs for his work.
   Conrad, 42, a native of Sebring, Ohio, retired from the Army in
1985 after 20 years and continued to live in Bad Kreuznach.

   The dollar was mostly higher but trading in a
narrow range in Europe late this morning. Gold prices fell slightly.
   The British pound gained ground, and was quoted at $1.5790,
compared with $1.5785 late Monday.
   Currency dealers said they don't expect major movements in the
dollar in the near-term.
   ``Not much has changed since the day before,'' said one trader
in Milan, Italy. ``The dollar is fairly stable ... and I don't
expect any disturbances to change the situation.''
   ``There's nothing special going on today,'' agreed Jens-Uwe
Fischer, senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover in Frankfurt.
   ``It seems to me we're still closely tied to the Dow Jones
(Industrial Average). The last two days we've followed it almost
exactly.''
   Traders said the market was calm ahead of the release later
today of the U.S. September index of leading indicators and
Friday's release of U.S. unemployment data for October. The index
is expected to show a month-to-month rise of 0.4 percent.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.02 yen to a closing 142.52 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 142.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates in London at midmorning compared with late
Monday:
   _1.8405 West German marks, up from 1.8360
   _1.6125 Swiss francs, up from 1.6065

   _1,348.50 Italian lire, up from 1,348.00
   _1.1732 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17475
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $376.00 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $376.75. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $376.05.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $376.10 compared with $376.75 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.75 to close at a bid $376.00.

   The government has freed 625 prisoners
who were among thousands jailed without trial in 1986 on suspicion
of supporting rebel groups, officials said today.
   The prisoners, released Saturday, brought to 4,332 the number of
political detainees freed in the past 16 months, officials said.
   Joseph Etima, the acting prisons commissioner, said fewer than
2,000 of the prisoners remained in jail but ``will be released in
due course, after their papers have been processed.''
   The prisoners were taken into custody during fighting between
government troops and the rebel Uganda People's Democratic Army in
1986. Museveni seized power in January 1986 after a five-year
guerrilla war.
   Four groups of prisoners have been released since the rebels
signed a peace accord with the government in June 1988.
   The releases also followed criticism from human rights groups,
which complained that the government of President Yoweri Museveni
was allowing the prisoners to languish in jail without charge or
trial.

<HEAD>China Bars Two Hong Kong Residents From Constitution Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's parliament today ousted two Hong Kong
residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony,
saying they were unfit because they had condemned China's crackdown
on its pro-democracy movement.
   Its leadership ruled Szeto Wah and Martin Lee no longer fit to
serve on the Chinese-dominated committee that is formulating the
British colony's constitution for when it reverts to Chinese
control in 1997.
   The Chinese lawmakers said the two can only return to the
committee if they ``abandon their antagonistic stand against the
Chinese government and their attempt to nullify the Sino-British
joint declaration on Hong Kong,'' the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
   Britain and Hong Kong agreed in 1984 that the colony, a coastal
enclave, would revert to Chinese rule in 1997.
   The new constitution, known as the Basic Law, is supposed to
guarantee a ``one country-two systems'' formula under which the
territory is to keep its Western capitalist system for 50 years.
   With the takeover date drawing nearer, China and Hong Kong have
been sharply at odds.
   China has strongly objected to the active support that has
blossomed in Hong Kong for people involved in the Beijing
pro-democracy movement that China's Communist leaders crushed on
June 4.
   Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the military
attack, after which many leaders of the student-inspired movement
fled into hiding and exile.
   Earlier this month, China suspended repatriation of illegal
Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong for two weeks after the colony
allowed a world-class Chinese swimmer to seek asylum in the United
States.
   Residents in Hong Kong, in turn, have been worried that the
Chinese crackdown has demonstrated it will not honor its promises
to maintain personal freedoms and capitalism in Hong Kong.
   Xinhua said the two members removed from the committee had
organized a group called the ``Hong Kong Citizens' Federation In
Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement.'' It said the
group openly advocated the overthrow of the Beijing government.
   Congress noted that the two had already said they would not take
part in law-drafting work under the current Chinese government,
Xinhua said. The Chinese lawmakers also said the pair had called
for re-examination of the 1984 British-Chinese pact.
   A poll published today indicated a large majority of Hong Kong
residents are skeptical about whether China will keep its promises
to Hong Kong.
   Nearly 70 percent of the 600 people surveyed in the telephone
poll expressed a lack of confidence that the new constitution would
ensure that the ``one country-two systems'' promise will be kept by
China.
   Just 3 percent said they were ``very confident'' the Basic Law
would guarantee the formula.
   The poll, conducted by Inrasia Pacific, was sponsored by the
English-language South China Morning Post.

<TEXT>
   About 20 Soviet journalists are attending a
conference on issues including outer space and pollution. Absent
was an editor who's doing penance for publishing a recent poll that
found Mikhail Gorbachev less popular than a leading dissident.
   Vladislav Starkov was to appear at the fifth General Chautauqua
Conference on U.S.-Soviet Relations.
   But Leonid Drobrokhotov, a senior member of the Soviet Central
Committee of the Communist Party, said the liberal editor of the
26-million circulation weekly, Arguments and Facts, was strongly
urged to remain at home to resolve problems arising from the poll.
   ``We have a very difficult situation now in the country,''
Drobrokhotov said at news conference Monday. ``He has a great
responsibility for correct information and for this reason, the
best way is for him to be in Moscow.
   ``He is a communist and we have the right to advise members of
the Communist Party what to do and what not to do.''
   Gorbachev reportedly called for Starkov's resignation after the
weekly, the country's most popular newspaper, published a reader
survey indicating human rights activist Andrei Sakharov was more
popular than the Soviet president.
   Soviet lawmakers, the newspaper's workers and other editors
rallied in Starkov's defense, and he was not fired.
   Dobrokhotov said Gorbachev told Starkov, ``I'm waiting for the
correct results.''
   The following edition that appeared Oct. 20 was a chastened
version of Arguments and Facts. The lead story confessed that the
first poll was an unscientific sampling of readers' letters and
included what it described as a scientific poll in which
Gorbachev's performance got a favorable assessment from the
majority of respondents.
   Yuri Ustimenko, chief editor of the American desk of the
official Soviet news agency Tass, said the Starkov case does not
represent a tightening of restrictions on Soviet journalists.
   ``It's an exceptional case. I don't see any trend or any
pressures,'' he said. ``It's very unlike Gorbachev to demand the
resignation of a particular editor.''
   Although Dobrokhotov acknowledged that polls in the Soviet Union
are not always correct, he said they nevertheless must be conducted
scientifically.
   ``The criticism toward Starkov was not because he had his own
point of view,'' Dobrokhotov said. ``But he did not objectively
reflect the real opinion of the public. He agreed this public
opinion poll was not correct. The results of the second poll
reflect more objectively the real situation in the country.''
   Dobrokhotov said the decision to delay Starkov's visit abroad
was not punishment but rather ``an objective solution.''
   The conference in Pittsburgh is sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh and Chautauqua Institution in western New York.
   About 200 Soviet delegates, ranging from laborers to
psychiatrists, are staying with Pittsburgh area residents.
   ``This is citizens' diplomacy versus official diplomacy,'' said
Vladimir V. Petrovsky, Soviet deputy minister of foreign affairs.
``It's a place for a new kind of exchange.''

   A 17-year legislative battle for gay rights in
Massachusetts ended with state Senate passage of a bill banning
discrimination against homosexuals in employment, credit and
housing.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis said he would sign the measure that emerged
from the Senate Monday and make Massachusetts only the second state
in the nation, after Wisconsin, to enact such legislation.
   ``This is the single greatest victory that gay people in the
United States have won in 1989,'' said David LaFontaine of the
Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Civil Rights. ``I think by far and
away the greatest impact of this bill will be the national
resonance.''
   The House approved the measure last week. LaFontaine predicted
the passage of the bill in Massachusetts would spur gay rights
efforts in other states.
   Dukakis said, ``It has taken 17 long years, but when I sign this
bill Massachusetts will be able to ensure that all of the rights
and the privileges that we all enjoy as citizens will not be denied
to anyone based on sexual orientation.''
   The Senate reserved the right to reconsider its 22-13 vote, but
the measure's sponsor said that was just a formality.
   ``Everything is over but the celebrating,'' said Democratic Sen.
Michael Barrett.
   The battle could continue until the 1990 election as at least
two groups have promised to try and repeal any gay rights
legislation through a statewide vote.
   The legislation bans discrimination based on sexual orientation
in employment, housing, credit and public accommodations and
empowers the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination to
investigate complaints.
   The bill's chief Senate opponent, Republican Sen. Edward Kirby,
scoffed at what he says amounts to providing rights to a group
based on the behavior of its members.
   ``Why don't we have an amendment to the bill that protects
members of the Flat Earth Society?'' Kirby said.
   Sen. David Locke, a Republican, speculated that the measure
would open the door to unreasonable protests against layoffs and
firings.
   ``No longer will the standards be competence or ability or
diligence or arriving on time or absenteeism. It will be whether or
not they were fired because they were gay,'' Locke said.
   The bill moved through the final stages of the legislative
process after its backers agreed to amendments that some
homosexuals found offensive.
   Among the amendments are provisions stating that the state does
not endorse homosexuality, exempting religious institutions and
stating that it does not recognize homosexual partnerships.
   ``This bill isn't going to end bigotry ... but this bill will
say the state neither encourages nor condones discrimination,''
said Arline Isaacson, co-chairman of the Massachusetts Gay and
Lesbian Political Caucus. ``For 17 years, by not passing this bill,
the state has, perhaps not deliberately but tacitly, encouraged
discrimination.''

<HEAD>Scaring Up Insurance For Haunted Houses Can Be Tough</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children delight in the axe-wielding
psychopaths, monsters, ghosts and other horrors of haunted houses
each Halloween. It's the insurance companies that are spooked.
   Civic groups that set up haunted houses to entertain children
and raise money are finding that scaring up insurance can be
expensive and tough, especially if insurers think the house's
attractions are dangerous.
   ``Some of (the haunted houses) are innocuous. But some get
pretty involved, with people jumping out and grabbing you, hanging
nooses and open flame,'' said Fran Brown, underwriter at Crump E &amp;
S of Florida Inc., an insurance broker.
   Moving staircases are frowned on too, because they could cause
people to lose their balance and fall, Brown said.
   Because of the possibility of injury and damage, most insurers
do not offer coverage. And those that do may charge thousands of
dollars for the few days the house operates.
   The Brookfield High School Band Parents are paying $1,439 for
property and liability insurance for a haunted house they hope will
raise $10,000 for a band trip.
   ``I think it's a very excessive amount,'' said Noel Costa, vice
president of fund-raising for the parents.
   But insurers say prices are based on what they perceive to be
the risk.
   Liability insurance alone can cost $750 to $12,000 depending on
how elaborate the house is and how much coverage is sought, Brown
said.
   Rates are also based on the number of visitors expected and the
length of time the haunted house will be open, she said.
   Major insurance companies seldom sell temporary policies for
spook houses. Hartford's Travelers Corp., for example, says it is
not financially feasible to sell them.
   Some companies, like Massachussetts-based Lexington Insurance
Co., are picky about what they'll insure and what they won't.
Lexington avoids insuring houses with rolling floors for fear they
will collapse.

   Former President Lyndon B. Johnson bragged he was
a World War II hero, but he actually observed only 13 minutes of
combat, according to a book to be published next year.
   An excerpt from ``Means of Ascent'' published Monday in the New
Yorker magazine claims the Silver Star that Johnson said he won for
his heroism in World War II was awarded merely as a political
gesture by Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
   The book, by Robert A. Caro, will be the second volume of his
comprehensive biography of Johnson, covering the former president's
``hopelessness and despair'' from 1941 to 1948.
   Caro writes that in the years after the war Johnson ``portrayed
himself as a war-scarred veteran of many battles on many fronts.''
   Actually, Caro says, Mr. Johnson saw combat in the South
Pacific, only as an observer, ``for a total of 13 minutes.''
   ``Not only did Johnson accept the Silver Star,'' the New Yorker
serialization says, ``he arranged to accept it in public. Several
times. Buying the decoration (in an Army-Navy store in Washington),
he took it to Texas, where, in a number of public appearances, it
was affixed to his lapel as if for the first time.''
   Caro said ``Johnson rapidly came to feel not only that he
deserved it but that he deserved more: that the Silver Star was not
a sufficiently high honor for such heroism as his.''
   George Christian, Johnson's presidential press secretary, said
Monday he never heard Johnson brag about his war record.
   ``I never heard him embellish it, although he did wear his
little Silver Star in his lapel,'' Christian said. ``It's
conceivable. A lot of people in World War II like to imagine they
did more than they did.''
   Caro's first volume, ``The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Path to
Power,'' was published in 1982 and won the National Book Critic's
Circle Award for non-fiction.
   Earlier, Caro won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of New York
power broker Robert Moses.
   Caro said Monday he spent four years near Austin researching
Johnson's early years. He said what emerged from his interviews was
a portrait less flattering than those found in some of the 17
Johnson biographies published before his.
   ``Texans are very honest,'' he said. ``They will not lie to you.
If you can find the right question, they will answer.''
   Lady Bird Johnson, the former president's widow, stopped
cooperating with him early in his research, Caro said. But former
Texas Gov. John Connally decided to talk to Caro only after reading
the first volume. Connally granted four days of interviews.

   A Palestinian guerrilla blew up his boat
near an Israeli gunboat in a suicide attack in the Mediterranean
off south Lebanon and Israel said today that three sailors were
wounded.
   The Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
claimed responsibility for the Monday night's attack and said
several Israelis were killed or wounded. It did not name the
attacker.
   In Jerusalem, the army said one sailor on the patrol boat was
slightly wounded and two others were ``scratched'' by shrapnel from
the explosion north of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
   News reports said the attack occurred about 12 miles north of
the border. A spokesman for the Marxist PFLP said the attack was
carried out after dark near the southern border village of Naqoura.
   The spokesman, who refused to be named, said the guerrilla was
sailing a sophisticated motorized fishing boat rigged with a large
quantity of heavy explosives.
   An Israeli radio report said an estimated 1,100 pounds of
explosives were aboard what it described as the guerrilla's rubber
dinghy.
   Sailors on the Dvora patrol boat first fired warning shots when
the guerrilla did not identify himself, then the dinghy moved
closer and exploded, an army official said on condition of
anonymity.
   Israel's navy carries out regular patrols in the area to block
guerrillas from infiltrating into Israel by sea.
   In a similar encounter April 9, an Israeli navy boat opened fire
on a rubber craft with two men aboard in the same area, killing the
two and destroying the boat. No sailors were injured.
   The worst guerrilla attack by sea was March 11, 1978 after a
13-man squad from the Palestine Liberation Organization landed in a
boat north of Tel Aviv. They then attacked two buses, killing 33
people and wounding 82.

   Fifteen seconds of turbulence that one

flying and knocked people into partitions, injuring seven aboard an
American Airlines flight.
   The Boeing 747 en route from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Detroit
with 100 passengers and seven crew members landed as scheduled at
Nashville International Airport on Monday night after weathering
the turbulence over the Atlantic.
   ``It was hair-raising,'' said passenger Sharon Hart of Dallas.

ailments as sore backs and shoulder and hip pain were treated at a
hospital, officials said.
   The turbulence hit about 90 miles north of Nassau in the
Bahamas, at 31,000 feet, said American spokesman Al Becker. The jet
was checked for damage, then continued on to Detroit.
   The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate, officials
said.
   Passengers said that they noticed clouds gathering moments
before the incident and that the seat belt sign had not been turned
on. But John Raymond, another American spokesman, said the jet
encountered unforeseeable ``clear air turbulence.''
   ``There is no scientific way to predict it, but fortunately it
doesn't happen very often,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ortega Asks Jesse Jackson to Intervene with Bush Administration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said he has
asked the Rev. Jesse Jackson to persuade U.S. officials and
lawmakers to support the disbanding of the Nicaraguan Contra rebel
force.
   A presidential communique said Ortega spoke by telephone Monday
with Jackson, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination last year.
   Frank Watkins, a Chicago spokesman for Jackson, said Jackson was
in Washington when he spoke with Ortega. Jackson did not issue a
statement on the conversation.
   Ortega said in his statement that he asked Jackson to try to
have U.S. money allotted for the Contras diverted to the United
Nations and the Organization of American States. He said that would
speed demobilization of the rebels and assure the Nicaraguan
elections set for Feb. 25 would be held in peace.
   ``We asked ... Jackson to focus his mediation efforts on (having
the United States) stop placing obstacles on the demobilization of
the Contras,'' the communique said.
   Ortega stunned a meeting of 17 nations at a Costa Rican
independence celebration on Saturday by announcing he intended to
suspend the 1{-year-old cease-fire in the government's war with the
rebels.
   He accused the rebels of disrupting voter registration by
ambushing security units and intimidating citizens. Ortega said he
would make a final decision on the truce by today.
   At the United Nations in New York, Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar urged Ortega to extend the truce.
   In a message to Ortega the U.N. chief said Monday he shared
Ortega's concern about ``the attacks which the Resistance (Contras)
have been carrying out despite the cease-fire, which has been
observed in general terms since March 1988.''
   But, he said, war in Nicaragua would hurt peace efforts for
Central America as a whole.
   In Washington, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said the Bush administration was ``waiting and watching'' to see
what action Ortega takes.
   ``We, obviously, are urging that the cease-fire be maintained,''
he said.
   About 11,000 Contras withdrew to camps on the Honduran side of
the border after the United States suspended weapons and ammunition
supplies in February 1988. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 are in
Nicaragua, conducting sporadic attacks.
   Washington has continued non-lethal aid to the rebels.
   Under an agreement signed Aug. 7 in Tela, Honduras, by Ortega
and four other Central American presidents, the Contras are to
disband and be relocated from their Honduran base camps by Dec. 8.
   In exchange, Ortega's Sandinista government advanced the date
for presidential elections to Feb. 25 and promised political
reforms, including greater campaign freedom for the opposition.
   Government and Contra leaders signed a cease-fire agreement
March 23, 1988. Talks broke down the following month but the
government has declared monthly unilateral cease-fires since the
temporary truce expired.

<HEAD>Rising Wages, Benefit Costs Push Employment Costs Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost to employers to pay the wages and
benefits of workers climbed 1.6 percent in the third quarter and
5.1 percent in the past year, with health insurance premiums again
driving up benefit costs at a faster pace than salaries, the
government said today.
   The 1.6 percent gain was up from a 1.3 percent increase in the
July-September period last year. The 5.1 percent jump in overall
compensation costs for the year ended last month was up from 4.7
percent for the 12 months ending in September 1988, the Labor
Department said.
   The department's Employment Cost Index report confirms that
tight labor markets and rising health care costs are driving up the
cost of doing business. But the biggest wage gains came in the
government sector, where the pricetag for salaries is traditionally
higher in the third quarter because of new contracts for teachers
and other public employees. Wages in the private sector grew at a
faster rate than last year but the gains have not been as
pronounced as some analysts have predicted.
   Excluding benefits' costs, wages and salaries rose 1.6 percent
in the quarter for all civilian workers _ double the 0.8 percent
gain posted in the second quarter, with state and local government
workers posting a 3.1 percent gain largely because of new
collective bargaining agreements. The wage gains for private-sector
workers averaged 1.2 percent in the third quarter, up from 1.0
percent compared to both the second qyarter and the July-September
period last year.
   For the year ended last month, wages and salaries for all
civilian rose 4.6 percent, up from 4.3 percent for the 12 months
ending in June and up from the 3.9 percent year-to-year gain posted
at this time last year. Because of tight labor markets,
particularly in high-skilled fields, economists have been
predicting persistent, if not dramatic, wage inflation.
   The wages and salaries for private sector workers were up 4.4
percent in the last 12 months, compared to 4.1 percent for the year
ending in June and 3.7 percent from October 1987-September 1988.
   Here again the wage gains were greater for state and local
government workers, whose wages and salaries climbed 5.5 percent in
the last year, up from 5.0 percent for the 12 months ending in June
and 4.7 percent year-to-year gain posted at this time last year.
   Salaries for school teachers, college and university professors
and health and hospital workers in the public sector all rose by
more than 6 percent in the last 12 months, the Labor Department
said. Union workers continue on average to make more than non-union
workers but the year-to-year wage gains on non-union employees were
nearly double those of union workers, 4.9 percent compared to 2.5
percent, continuing a six-year trend.
   On paper, the data reflected some relief for employers, who have
seen the costs of benefits in general and health care costs in
particular skyrocket in recent years.
   The third quarter increase in benefits costs was 1.4 percent,
down slightly from the 1.6 percent posted for the three months
ending in June, the government said.
   For the year ended last month, the costs of benefits alone grew
by 6.0 percent, up from 5.6 percent for the year ending in June but
down significantly from the 6.7 percent increase posted last year.
The decline, however, is almost entirely attributable to the fact
that the Social Security tax did not rise this year. It rose 5.0
percent last year and drove up overall benefit costs.

   Devil's Night fires flared across the city early
today despite the efforts of an estimated 30,000 patrolling
volunteers and hundreds of arrests under a curfew intended to stem
the annual Halloween orgy of arson.
   At least five families were left homeless by fires. Overworked
firefighters took up to 20 minutes to respond to alarms. No
injuries were reported.
   Police and firefighters refused to release a count of blazes
blamed on youths who take part in the city tradition of setting
fires during the three nights culminating in Halloween. They
deferred to the office of Mayor Coleman Young, whose aides said no
information would be given until a tally is completed Wednesday.
   But it was clear that dozens of blazes were set in trash bins
and abandoned buildings. City Councilman Mel Ravitz said today that
the number of fires was up from last year but was still lower than
in earlier years.
   ``There has been a great effort made ... to reduce the number of
incidents of vandalism or arson,'' he said. ``That we may be up a
few this year. I don't think that means the city is going
backwards.''
   As the sun set Monday, columns of smoke rose from blazes
scattered through the poor, mostly low-rise east side, and fires
glowed orange as darkness fell.
   During the past two nights, at least 334 youths were arrested,
police said, four for investigation of arson and the rest for
violating the 6 p.m.-to-dawn curfew imposed for the period. Police
are allowed to detain children under 18 overnight if they are
caught on the streets without a parent.
   One burned-out resident, Penny Thomas, blamed Devil's Night
revelers for the blaze that erupted in an abandoned house next door
and destroyed her home.
   ``The house just went to burning in the front, and me and my
friends, we ran out of the house,'' Thomas said. ``The fire kept
burning and the fire truck hadn't got here yet.''
   Benny Braxton, a retiree whose home burned this morning, said he
stayed up late watching the abandoned house next door out of fear
of arsonists before finally going to sleep. Neighbors roused him
when his house caught fire.
   ``Because that house was empty, I had a feeling something was
going to happen,'' Braxton said.
   ``We don't know what started it or who started it, but somebody
definitely started it,'' Fire Capt. Amos Horton said. ``When a
place is going like this is going, we know it was set.''
   The peculiar tradition apparently peaked in 1984, when
firefighters battled 808 fires during the period. The number of
fires has declined steadily, and last year there were 229 reported
Devil's Night blazes.
   Civilians have joined the battle against arson, and this year,
an estimated 30,000 people signed up to patrol the streets,
reporting curfew violators and trying to spot fires before they
spread.
   In part, the strategy is intended to relieve firefighters of the
burden of patrolling so they can devote all their time to putting
out fires.
   The fire and police effort was bolstered by other city workers
who cruised the streets of fire-prone neighborhoods in their
official cars looking for flare-ups.

<HEAD>Questioning of Potential Jurors Continues in Police Shooting Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who said she feared riots might break out
if a policeman is acquitted in the slaying of a black motorcyclist
was among five people excused as potential jurors at the officer's
manslaughter trial.
   Lawyers on Monday began questioning potential jurors one at a
time about their knowledge of the Jan. 16 shooting, which touched
off three days of rioting that left one person dead and caused
millions in damage.
   People were called into the courtroom from a jury pool created
last week and were asked how they felt about past riots and the
potential for more violence after a verdict.
   A white woman in her 50s said she couldn't put aside her fear of
violence and was dismissed.
   ``It's frightening,'' she said. ``You're afraid that if you were
on the jury and brought in a verdict the black community didn't
want to hear, there'd be rioting.''
   In all, nine people were retained and five excused Monday. Those
excused included two men and a woman, all white, who had formed
strong opinions on the case, and a black woman with seven children.
   Selection of potential jurors was to continue today.
   The trial of Colombian-born William Lozano, 30, has raised fears
of more violence in Miami, which erupted in 1980, 1982 and 1984
after slayings of black men by police or the officers' acquittals.
   The Miami officer is charged in the deaths of Clement Anthony
Lloyd, 23, who was shot in the head during a chase, and Allan
Blanchard, 24, a passenger killed in the crash of Lloyd's
motorcycle.
   Lozano contends he fired in self-defense.
   Some of those questioned said there was the potential for unrest
whichever way the verdict went.
   ``There's two sides and somebody's going to be dissatisfied,''
said one middle-aged woman. She was retained for the jury pool.
   This year's disturbance started on the Martin Luther King
holiday and came as Miami got ready to be host of the Super Bowl.

<HEAD>Nebraska Agency Can't Force AIDS Tests on Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs last graf to update with latest figures</HEAD>

   A Nebraska agency will not be allowed to force
public employees who supervise the mentally retarded to undergo
testing for AIDS, under a new Supreme Court order.
   ``Obviously I'm disappointed,'' said Don Moray, director of
Eastern Nebraska Community Office of Retardation, after the high
court Monday turned aside his agency's appeal to require testing.
   ``We believed in the policy very strongly as a means of
protecting our clients,'' Moray said. Workers were never tested
under the policy.
   The justices, who have never ruled on the lawfulness of AIDS
testing, let stand decisions that blocked the agency from imposing
mandatory blood testing of employees who come into direct contact
with the mentally retarded people the agency serves.
   The Bush administration urged the court to leave intact a ban on
the tests imposed by lower courts. Justice Department lawyers said
the lower court rulings comply with Constitution's ban on
unreasonable government searches and seizures.
   In other developments, the Supreme Court:
   _Agreed to settle a dispute in which federal protection for 30
million American workers' pensions could be at stake. The court
will decide what authority the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation has to order employers to revive scrapped pension plans.
   _Agreed to decide whether the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, and perhaps other multi-state agencies, may be sued in
federal courts.
   _Said it will use a Chicago drug case to consider expanding the
authority of police to search homes without court warrants.
   _Was urged during an oral argument session to strike down as
``taxation without representation'' a federal judge's order that
doubled local property taxes to pay for racially desegregating
Kansas City, Mo., public schools.
   _Heard arguments over a challenge to the partial merger of
Detroit's two daily newspapers.
   _Rejected, in a Virginia case, arguments that states must not
favor the clergy over secular humanists in licensing people to
perform weddings.
   _Barred a lawsuit against the Christian Science church by a
Michigan couple whose 15-month-old boy died after they, as church
members, were counseled to rely on faith healing and avoid seeking
medical help.
   The AIDS testing case focused on the Nebraska agency's 1987
policy requiring some employees to submit to blood testing for the
virus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The contagious disease attacks the body's immune system,
rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood,
blood products or semen from infected persons.
   The incurable condition is believed caused by a virus called the
human immunodeficiency virus or HIV.
   The Nebraska agency said it wants to test its workers because
retarded clients can engage in violent conduct such as biting or
scratching. An infected worker could then pass on the virus to
other clients, the agency suggested.
   But U.S. District Judge Lyle Strom barred the tests when workers
sued, and his ruling was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   The chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug users, although a small percentage of cases is
attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual
contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of Aug. 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 105,990
Americans, of whom 58 percent, or 61,655, have died since June 1,
1981, according to the Center for Disease Control. No one is known
to have recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>DA to Investigate Possible Jury Tampering in Medgar Evers Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The district attorney says he will
investigate whether jury tampering occurred in the 1964 trial of a
white businessman in the assassination of Mississippi NAACP leader
Medgar Evers.
   ``It could be that it will take a grand jury investigation,'' Ed
Peters said Monday. The City Council voted last week in favor of
reopening the case.
   The council resolution came after published reports said the
Sovereignty Commission, a now-defunct state panel established in
1956 to preserve segregation, screened potential jurors to help the
defense of Byron De La Beckwith at his murder trial in 1964.
   Beckwith was tried twice but both trials ended in hung juries.
Murder charges against him were dropped in 1969.
   Documents show that the Sovereignty Commission described certain
potential jurors as likely to be ``fair and impartial.'' One was
noted as Jewish and another as having improper ``thinking.''
``Fair'' jurors made the final panel; the others did not.
   Mere background inquiries by the commission do not constitute
tampering, Peters said. A grand jury would look for evidence that
jurors were influenced, he said.
   Other legal hurdles remain in the way of reopening the case,
including the right to a speedy trial, the district attorney said.
   Erle Johnston, former Sovereignty Commission director, said the
agency's role in Beckwith's first trial ``was unethical, but it
wasn't tampering.''
   Evers, an NAACP leader who fought to open white schools to black
children, was gunned down in the driveway of his Jackson home.
Beckwith's fingerprints were found on the rifle used.
   Beckwith, who said during the trial that his weapon was stolen,
could not be reached for comment. There is no telephone listing for
the Greenwood businessman in the area.
   Evers' widow, Myrlie, now a Los Angeles public works
commissioner, said, ``I'm heartened to know that the interest is
growing in the possibility of reopening Medgar's case.''

<TEXT>
   As the United States and Soviets
resumed talks at the United Nations on reducing chemical weapons,
ground was broken on a windswept plain here on the first plant with
that goal in mind.
   The plant, scheduled for completion in 1992, is the first of
eight planned in the continental United States for dismantling and
incinerating old mustard and nerve gas weapons, many of which date
from World War II.
   Ronald Lehman II, the Bush administration's chief arms
negotiator, said Monday that construction of the $212 million plant
represented the ``leading edge'' of the U.N. talks 2,500 miles away.
   The facility is 50 miles southwest of Salt Lake City on a
sagebrush-strewn corner of the Tooele Army Depot dotted with
concrete igloos housing more than 40 percent of the nation's aging
chemical stockpile.
   Lehman and others said renewed negotiations at the United
Nations in New York and talks at the U.N. Disarmament Conference in
Geneva had bolstered hopes for limiting and ultimately destroying
old chemical weapons.
   Both nations have called for the destruction of existing
chemical weapons but differ on the timetable and the rules under
which new ``binary'' chemical weapons might be manufactured.
   Binary weapons contain two chemicals that are not harmful until
combined for use.

<HEAD>Economic Index Inches Upward in September</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs with other economic reports after 5th graf,
The economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge inched ahead 0.2 percent in September for its second
consecutive monthly advance, the Commerce Department said today,
indicating continued but slow growth in the months ahead.
   The increase in the Index of Leading Indicators, designed to
foretell economic activity six to nine months into the future,
followed an advance of 0.5 percent in August that was revised
upward from a 0.3 percent gain reported earlier.
   The often-volatile index was unchanged in July and had dipped
0.1 percent in June. The July figure also was revised, down from
the 0.1 percent increase originally reported.
   Analysts said that, while the index indicates continued but slow
growth, the immediate future will be a precarious time.
   ``The economy looks very soft right now,'' said Bruce Steinberg,
senior economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. The
next few months ``will be a period of vulnerability,'' he added.
   Underlining that concern, the Commerce Department also reported
that sales of new homes plunged 14 percent in September, their
steepest decline in nearly eight years, as interest rates crept
back to the double-digit level of the preceding months.
   New single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 618,000 last month, following a 3.1 percent decline
in August.
   The Labor Department, meantime, reported that employers' costs
for wages and benefits of workers climbed 1.6 percent in the third
quarter and 5.1 percent in the past year, with health insurance
premiums again driving up benefit costs at a faster pace than
salaries.
   Four of the 11 forward-looking business statistics that make up
the composite index contributed to the September gain.
   The index measuring consumer expectations was the largest
positive contributor last month and the major cause for the August
and July revisions, the Commerce Department said.
   Other positive factors were an increase in the money supply, a
longer average work week and higher stock prices.
   The other statistics pointed down, led by a decrease in
manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods. That was followed by
a decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders; fewer orders for
plants and equipment; faster vendor performance, meaning declining
demand; higher initial unemployment claims; fewer building permits
and lower prices for sensitive materials. indicating weakening
demand.
   The various changes left the index at 145.0 percent of its 1982
base of 100. So far this year, the index has fallen at an annual
rate of 0.1 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent for
the first nine months of 1988.
   The economy has been slowing since the Federal Reserve applied
the brakes last year to dampen inflation. But while inflation
appears to be abating, analysts are concerned the Fed's grip could
thrust the economy into recession.
   Steinberg and other economists point to excessive inventories
and slackening durable-goods orders, including a weaker demand for
new automobiles, as major threats to the economy because both could
trigger growing unemployment and stagnant growth.
   Other areas of concern include the nation's trade deficit, which
increased in August after falling for two straight months, and
declining corporate profits, which could affect stock market prices.
   Steinberg and Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for
the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., both noted the consumer
confidence category as a major positive indicator in the September
index.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, accounted for much of the year's growth so far.
   ``As long as confidence holds up, we probably won't have a
recession,'' Chimerine said.
   But he and other economists have noted that consumer spending
has begun to wane and believe it will be substantially weaker in
the last quarter of the year, leading to a decline in manufacturing.
   Chimerine said Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California
earthquake could promote the construction industry in the coming
months as the disaster areas begin to rebuild.
   But he also said the possible damage to factories in the areas,
combined with commuting problems of employees, getting to work
could disrupt output.
   ``At this point, it's difficult to say which might outweigh the
other, but I don't expect any major effect on the economy,''
Chimerine said.

<HEAD>Cruise Ship Converted to Restaurant Sinks Suddenly at Dockside</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cruise ship converted into a dockside
restaurant mysteriously rolled over and sank in the harbor with a
shattering of glass as a security guard who had gone aboard to
investigate popping noises scrambled ashore.
   ``She fell splat into the water and then it was glog, glog,
glog,'' said Michael Barnes, first mate of a passenger ship nearby
Monday.
   The 68-year-old S.S. Princess Louise, which had plied the
Pacific for decades before being retired, went down in 23 feet of
water, leaving half the 331-foot, 6,000-ton vessel submerged, Fire
Department spokesman Jim Wells said.
   The cause of the sinking was under investigation.
   The security guard escaped without injury. No one else was
aboard; the ship had closed its restaurant in January.
   ``Chairs started flying all over the place, glass was breaking.
I was just trying to get out of there,'' said the guard, Minnie
Morgan.
   The Princess Louise Restaurant, a fixture on the harbor for two
decades, fell on hard times last year and went out of business. It
is now owned by the Bank of San Pedro and was being refurbished for
sale when it sank.
   The ship had spent three weeks in dry dock for some hull work
and had been put back in the water last week, said Lance Oak, bank
president and chief executive officer. He said the ship was insured
for $1.5 million.
   Built in 1921, the Princess Louise ferried passengers between
Vancouver, British Columbia, and Alaskan ports. It was converted to
a restaurant ship in 1966.
   Its seven banquet rooms and three dining rooms could accommodate
1,200 diners.

<TEXT>
   The army today removed
roadblocks around this town and called off a six-week campaign of
raids that was aimed at breaking a tax boycott by Palestinian
residents.
   Also today, masked Palestinians hacked to death a 22-year-old
woman and wounded her sister; both were accused of cooperating with
Israeli authorities, Arab reports said.
   The operation in Beit Sahour was the army's first concentrated
show of force designed to break a Palestinian tax boycott. Such
civil disobedience has been a key element of a 22-month-old
uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories.
   Beit Sahour, a predominantly Christian town of 10,000 near
Bethlehem, has been a stronghold of the tax boycott.
   As soldiers removed blockades, about 300 to 400 residents took
to the streets proclaiming victory and singing the Palestinian
anthem, ``Biladi, Biladi,'' which means ``My country, My country.''
   ``We stood up to the army, and we won,'' said one resident.
   But Israel's West Bank military governor, Brig. Gen. Shaike
Erez, also claimed victory, saying he was ``convinced the tax
rebellion is broken,'' Israel radio reported.
   For the past six weeks, foreign diplomats, church leaders,
journalists and most non-residents have been barred from entering
Beit Sahour.
   In a series of raids, soldiers seized property valued at $1.5
million from 398 debtors, an army communique said. It said 33 motor
vehicles along with cash and money in bank accounts were seized in
lieu of taxes.
   Forty debtors were arrested and 35 were indicted. Of these, four
were fined $3,000 or ordered to spent 180 days in jail, the
military said.
   The English-language Jerusalem Post put the arrest total at 60.
   The army communique said that because of the raids, tax
boycotters elsewhere in the West Bank had come forward to pay debts.
   In defense of the operation, which was widely criticized abroad,
the army said ``it was intended to restore law and order and was
conducted in an organized and orderly fashion.''
   The army said it launched the raids Sept. 20 after 320 residents
stopped paying their taxes.
   The army announcement did not directly address numerous
published complaints of brutality during the raids but indirectly
acknowledged soldiers may have confiscated the wrong property in
some cases.
   Authorities decided to lift the siege of the town after
completing seizures of property and arrests of those refusing to
pay taxes, said one security source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip today, two sisters who worked at
Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis were attacked. The victims were Serya
El Kadi, who was hacked to death, and Sumaya El Kadi, who was
seriously injured, said Arab reporters.
   The reporters said both were accused of helping authorities
identify Palestinian youths brought to the hospital with wounds
from clashes with Israeli soldiers.
   Palestinian activists often give false names to hospitals to
avoid being arrested later by security forces on the basis of
hospital reports.
   Last week, five masked attackers fatally stabbed a nurse inside
Nasser hospital. They scrawled slogans on a wall accusing the
victim of collaborating with Israeli security forces.
   The latest slaying brings to 138 the number of Palestinians
killed by fellow Arabs in the 22-month-old uprising against Israeli
occupation. Most were slain as suspected collaborators.
   At least 607 Palestinians have been killed by soldiers or
Israeli civilians during the revolt, and 40 Israelis also have died
in the violence.

<TEXT>
   A gun of choice among Colombia's drug
traffickers is the Colt AR-15 semiautomatic assault-style rifle,
say U.S. firearms officials tracing the guns seized in that
country's drug crackdown.
   Most guns traced thus far were delivered either individually or
in small batches, dispelling the notion that huge shipments of guns
are heading to Colombia, say officials with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
   The ATF said it needs to send agents to Colombia permanently to
get more information on the guns being seized.
   ``My understanding is the Colombia officials think that is a
good way to proceed'' and Drug Enforcement Administration and
Treasury Department officials also support the plan, ATF Director
Stephen E. Higgins said in an interview Monday. State Department
spokeswoman Catherine Shaw said she expects the ATF proposal to be
approved.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco and then-Colombian Justice
Minister Monica de Greiff called on the United States in September
to help halt gun shipments to drug traffickers who declared ``total
war'' on the government after it launched a crackdown in August.
   Drug traffickers have been held responsible for many shootings
as well as 237 bombings in the past 10 weeks that killed 33 people
and injured 222.
   During the summer, two ATF agents went to Colombia to help trace
the guns being used and to train Colombians in firearms
identification, Higgins said.
   Thus far, the ATF has traced 242 of the 700 weapons on which
Colombia has sought information, according to ATF spokesman Jack
Killorin.
   The most popular weapon among the guns traced thus far is the
Colt-manufactured AR-15 semiautomatic assault-style rifle, but many
other weapons also have turned up, he said.
   ``They cover the gamut,'' Killorin said. ``There are a lot of
rifles, AR-15s, some Mac-11s, also some traditional Colt .45
pistols and Smith and Wesson revolvers. The single most prevalent
weapon in the trace is the AR-15.''
   The AR-15 was the most popular U.S.-made weapon similar to the
imported AK-47 and Uzi carbines that were banned from the United
States in the spring.
   Colt Industries Inc suspended retail sales of the AR-15 after
the Bush Administration imposed a temporary import suspension on
the foreign-made semiautomatic assault-style weapons in March.
Company spokesman Mike Dunn said today that sales to U.S.
government agencies and law enforcement continue.
   It was unclear exactly how each of the AR-15s wound up in the
hands of the Colombians, but Dunn said, ``We don't sell guns to
drug dealers.''
   Killorin said the information uncovered thus far rebuts the
``perception that things are leaving the country by huge shiploads
of thousands of guns. That's not true. What appears to be going on
is very widespread small purchases, not in any particular organized
fashion, more opportunistic.''
   Typically, he said, a cocaine cartel employee in Florida
awaiting a big drug shipment might ``wander into a gun store and
buy a couple of guns,'' and hand them over to other cartel workers
who deliver the cocaine, he said.
   But some cartel employees have sought to buy much larger
quantities of weapons from ATF agents working undercover as
gun-sellers, he said.
   ``They've been approached by people working for one or the other
cartel, seeing what they can pick up,'' he said. The buyers
occasionally have sought to purchase 100 to 200 guns as well as
``things not available, for example, machine guns.''
   During the summer, Customs Service officials ``grabbed 37 rifles
on an airplane going down to Barranquilla, Colombia,'' he said.
``We were able to run down those guns, lock up some of the
purchasers. We found they had bought an additional number of guns,
about 150'' prior to the bust. Those guns were not recovered.
   One reason the ATF wants to base agents in Colombia is the lack
of specific information coming from government officials there,
Killorin said.
   ``We're hearing reports and the Colombians are saying they're
seizing thousands of weapons,'' he said. ``We're getting lists of
guns, but not the kind of information like, `These are hot off a
Medellin seizure, off Pablo Escobar's boudoir.''' Escobar reputedly
is a leader of the Medellin cartel.

   A mother whose boy died from being forced
to drink up to nine quarts of water was convicted of involuntary
manslaughter but cleared of murder after claiming she was trying to
flush stale sherbet out of his system.
   Angela West, 30, was convicted Monday in the 1988 death of
6-year-old Christopher West and was sentenced to 12 years in
prison. She could have received the death penalty if found guilty
of murder.
   Prosecutors contended Ms. West and her boyfriend, Jonathan
Crawford, forced Christopher to drink the water to punish him for
eating lime sherbet without permission.
   Doctors said the water caused the boy's brain to swell, leading
to seizures and death.
   Defense attorneys said the two were trying to get the sherbet
out of Christopher's system because it was 3 weeks old and they
believed it was dangerously stale. Prosecutors said there was no
evidence the dessert posed any danger.
   ``We believed, like they said, that they were trying to flush
out his system and it somehow went haywire and it was too late to
realize what was happening,'' said juror Belinda Lynn.
   Prosecutor Steve Balog said he was disappointed in the verdict,
which came after three days of deliberations.
   ``I think it is difficult for the average person, including the
average juror, to believe that a mother will d this to her child,
so I'm sure that was a factor in the case,'' he said.
   Crawford was found guilty of murder earlier this year and
sentenced to life in prison.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's jobless rate has soared to 27 percent
in some areas, in part because of government efforts to streamline
bloated factory payrolls, Pravda said today.
   Unemployment has reached 27.6 percent in the republic of
Azerbaijan, 25.7 percent in Tadzhikistan, 22.8 percent in
Uzbekistan, 18.8 in Turkmenia, 18 percent in Armenia and 16.3
percent in Kirgizia, the newspaper said.
   All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the
Soviet Union, and all but Kirgizia have reported rioting in the
past six months.
   The Soviet Union has long claimed that unemployment is
exclusively found in capitalist countries. It was only last summer
that Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov admitted the existence of mass
unemployment in the Soviet Union. He cited it as a cause of ethnic
violence.
   The Communist Party newspaper said it is time for the Soviet
Union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like
those in the West.
   The article gave no estimate for overall unemployment in the
Soviet Union but said an Association of the Unemployed has cropped
up that claims the number of jobless is 23 million, or 17 percent
of the work force.

   Jesse Jackson's half brother, accused of skimming
restaurant profits and hiring gang members to kill a former
employee, was denied bail after prosecutors argued he might try to
kill or intimidate witnesses.
   U.S. Magistrate Elaine Bucklo on Monday ordered 47-year-old Noah
Robinson jailed for trial.
   Robinson is accused of offering $10,000 for the 1986 slaying of
Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber in Greenville, S.C. Robinson and five
associates also are accused of diverting $650,000 from three
Wendy's restaurants they operated.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Hogan argued, ``This is a very
dangerous man who is not at all a simple businessman.'' The
government's interest is in ``keeping alive the witnesses and their
family members,'' he said.
   Robinson was sentenced earlier this year to 10 years in prison
in the murder-for-hire of a witness to the Barber slaying. He had
been free on bail while appealing that verdict.

<HEAD>Soviets Say Superpower Summit to be Informal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with Shevardnadze comment on report that main
purpose of summit is for Soviets to seek economic aid, NATO comment; no

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first summit between President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Bush will be an informal meeting to help
them get acquainted and will not cover any major issues, the Soviet
foreign minister said today.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze bristled at the suggestion the unexpected
meeting will be held so the Kremlin can ask for U.S. aid for its
faltering and shortage-plagued economy.
   The summit, set for Dec. 2-3 aboard U.S. and Soviet warships in
the Mediterranean, was announced simultaneously in Moscow and
Washington.
   Gorbachev is to visit Italy from Nov. 29 to Dec. 1.
   Shevardnadze said the superpowers do not plan to reach agreement
on any specific issue at the unusual meeting on Soviet and American
ships. He said the talks are intended to set the stage for a
``full-scale summit'' in the United States in the first six months
of 1990.
   ``The upcoming talks between the Soviet and American leaders
will be informal, aimed at allowing them to know each other
better,'' Shevardnadze told reporters.
   He said the meeting ``should be regarded as the most important
stage in preparing negotiations which will take place during the
official state visit by Mikahil Gorbachev'' to the United States
next year.
   Of the December summit, Shevardnadze said: ``I do not doubt that
this meeting between the two leaders would contribute to broadening
the changes taking place in the Soviet-American relationship.''
   Later, taking reporters' questions, Shevardnadze reacted with
visible displeasure when asked whether a Washington Post report in
today's editions was correct in saying the key element of the
December summit would be the Kremlin's quest for American economic
aid.
   ``I would ask you not to use this term _ `to help the Soviet
economy,''' Shevardnadze retorted.
   The Kremlin's current economic reforms are the affair of the
Soviet people alone, who seek ``mutually advantageous cooperation''
in trade and other fields with the Americans, he said.
   ``This meeting is not directly connected with perestroika,''
Shevardnadze said.
   In Brussels, Belgium, Manfred Woerner, the secretary-general of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, called the summit ``a
useful opportunity to discuss and improve East-West relations.''
   Woerner, according to a NATO spokesman, thinks the meeting is
``clearly of interest not only to the major powers but is ... in
the interests of the entire alliance.''
   Shevardnadze refused to identify the naval vessels on which the
Bush-Gorbachev summit will take place.
   Bush, then president-elect, attended the last meeting of
superpower leaders in New York in December 1988 when Ronald Reagan
was president.

   President Bush today left open the possibility
he would seek renewed military aid for the Contra rebels if
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega calls off the cease-fire his
leftist government declared 19 months ago.
   Asked about that possibility at a news conference, Bush said:
``I would re-evaluate this situation in a minute if the cease-fire
is broken.''
   Congress suspended military aid to the Contras in February 1988,
and the administration has chosen not to seek additional assistance
of that kind.
   Bush spoke a day after Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said threats by Ortega to suspend the truce with the Contras may be
a prelude to cancellation of national elections set for February in
Nicaragua.
   ``I worry that they (the Sandinista government) may be trying to
lay a predicate to walk away from their commitment to hold
elections,'' Baker said in an interview Monday with The Associated
Press.
   However, Ortega insisted Monday the elections will be held.
   ``The elections are taking place in Nicaragua, period,'' Ortega
said, speaking through an interpreter in an interview with NBC
News. ``With Contra or without Contra they are going to take place,
definitely. With war or no war, that is, elections are taking
place.''
   Ortega surprised a hemispheric conference on democracy in Costa
Rica last Friday by announcing that he would cancel a cease-fire
that the Sandinistas and the Contras agreed to in March 1988.
However, he later modified that by saying he would decide the
matter today.
   At his news conference, Bush renewed his criticism of Ortega.
   ``I've never seen a meeting where all the participants were so
unanimously against all the outrages of one. And we're still
getting messages in here about the outrageous performance of Daniel
Ortega,'' he said. ``He reached new embarrassing proportions of
stepping on it.''
   The president also seemed to reject a proposal by Ortega that
civil rights leader Jesse Jackson try to persuade U.S. officials
and members of Congress to convert Contra humanitarian aid to a
program under which the rebels would be demobilized.
   Bush said the idea had ``limited appeal.''
   Ortega contends the Contras have systematically violated the
cease-fire, leading to the deaths of more than 730 Sandinista
soldiers since it went into effect.
   But a senior State Department official who briefed reporters on
Monday, insisting on anonymity, said the Sandinista army has
conducted ``aggressive and continuing search-and-destroy operations
against resistance forces'' since the truce began.
   From May through September 1989, at least 105 rebels have been
killed in such operations, he said, adding that the Contra
casualties run about 15 to 20 a month since the truce went into
effect.
   In a separate interview, former Assistant Secretary of State
Elliott Abrams said he doubts that the Contras, numbering 2,000 to
3,000 inside Nicaragua and with minimal supplies, would choose to
take on the 75,000-member Sandinista army.
   ``Who believes with those odds the Contras would restart the
war?'' Abrams asked.
   Baker said Ortega's threat may reflect his concern that
opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro could have a ``real chance of
winning if the elections are halfway free and fair.''
   ``If there is a chance for democracy to win an election, maybe
the approach hasn't been all wrong,'' Baker said, answering
skeptics who contend the administration has not applied enough
pressure on Nicaragua.
   Baker has softened the Reagan administration's policy toward
Nicaragua considerably, declining to seek military aid for the
Contras and urging them to refrain from military attacks on the
Sandinistas.
   But Ortega's view is that despite a Central America peace
process that dates back almost seven years, the Contras seem no
closer to being dismantled now than they have at any time.
   Most are stationed at camps along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border
but the Sandinistas are concerned that the United States could once
again transform them into an effective fighting force.
   The administration view is that they should not be demobilized
until after the election in order to give the Sandinistas maximum
incentive to make the election process as free and fair as possible.

   Here is the text of President Bush's Tuesday
morning statement and news conference:
   President Bush: I have a statement and then I would be glad to
take a few questions.
   President Gorbachev and I will meet Dec. 2 and Dec. 3 aboard
U.S. and Soviet naval vessels on alternate days in the
Mediterranean. Our discussions will cover the current international
situation and developments in US-Soviet relations.
   And in view of the full-scale U.S.-Soviet summit to be held in
the United States during the late spring or early summer of 1990,
President Gorbachev and I have agreed that an interim informal
meeting at this time would be appropriate.
   Our talks will be informal in character, designed to allow us to
become better acquainted with one another and to deepen our
respective understanding of each other's views. Neither President
Gorbachev nor I anticipate that substantial decisions or agreements
will emerge from this December meeting.
   Now wait a minute. Here. Right _ first here. Sorry about that.
   Q: Mr. President, what do you hope to accomplish with this? I
mean, is the economy going to be one of the main parts of the
agenda or do you have arms control _ what do you think is really
going to be the agenda _ you're going to talk about?
   A: I think there will be talk of a wide array of subjects
without a specific agenda. And this is what I proposed to Mr.
Gorbachev several months ago, after our return from the Paris
Economic Summit. We've been working on this all that time. And _
   Q: It sounds like you were stampeded into this, because it
wasn't in the works and you had rejected _
   A: You mean since July it's been in the works.
   Q: Has it?
   A: Yeah, you just haven't been told.
   Q: You're right. (Laughter.)
   A: Yeah. Since July. And I made the proposal to Mr. Gorbachev.
And I'll say this, they immediately and enthusiastically _ he did _
thought this was a good idea.
   Q: And did you also?
   A: I made the proposal.
   Q: Mr. President _
   A: Yeah?
   Q: There's been some speculation that a meeting of this type
might be intended _ an idea to revamp the Soviet economy. Are you
trying to get some ideas together to go to this meeting with some
type of proposal like that?
   A: Well, I'm sure that now that the meeting is announced, there
will be an awful _ many suggestions as to the subject we should
discuss. And _ but there's not going to be an agenda or meeting
that could be seen to fail or succeed on whether we make agreements
of this nature. That's not what this meeting is about. And so, the
president _ President Gorbachev will have been in Italy, and it
seemed like a very convenient way to do this. But there's not going
to be _ there's nothing off the table, nothing on it. It's not
going to be an arms control meeting. Clearly the summit will drive
the arms control agenda.
   Q: Mr. President _
   Q: How do you assess Mr. Gorbachev's reforms? Do you think he's
in trouble?
   A: I want to talk to him about their economy, our economy, a
wide array of subjects. And we have _ I've said over and over
again, we want to see perestroika succeed. And they know this.
There hasn't been a disconnect _ as I answered Helen, we've been
talking about this meeting since July.
   Q: Mr. President _ Mr. President, could you _

<TEXT>
   Parliament voted today to hold a
national referendum on when and how to elect someone to fill the
new post of president.
   The house voted to hold the referendum Nov. 26, the date that
had tentatively been chosen for a popular vote to select a
president under an agreement signed by the ruling Socialist Party
and most of the major opposition groups.
   But two opposition groups, the League of Free Democrats and the
League of Young Democrats, had opposed that. They collected more
than 200,000 signatures on petitions calling for a referendum on
the method and timing of such elections.
   The groups want the president chosen by parliament after the
general elections, which are to be held by June. They say they need
more time to organize an effective campaign to make their
candidates better known.
   The agreement between the Socialists and most opposition groups
had called for a one-time popular vote to select a president, with
parliament choosing all subsequent presidents.
   If Hungarians vote in favor of electing a president before the
parliamentary elections next year, the presidential balloting would
be conducted Jan. 7, the lawmakers decided today.
   The presidency was created by constitutional amendments adopted
two weeks ago and the office's responsibilities include command of
the armed forces and calling elections.
   The Socialist Party is the successor to the Communist party,
which dissolved itself at a congress this month. The Socialists
promise to end one-party rule and replace it with constitutional
democracy.
   Hungarian legislators today also planned to discuss and vote on
government proposals on a suspended Danube river hydroelectric
project with Czechoslovakia. Hungary has been increasingly at odds
with that Warsaw Pact ally over the project's suspension and
Hungary's path of reform.
   Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders have refused to ease their
tight control of society and allow any degree of power-sharing.
   In declaring a moratorium in May on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam
project, the Hungarian government expressed concern about potential
enviromental damage. Czechoslovakia has said it will continue
construction and demand compensation if the Hungarians don't rejoin
the project.
   On Monday, Parliament overwhelmingly approved legislation
creating a state auditor's office to control government and party
finances.
   The laws, to take effect in November, were among several on the
agenda on the opening day of Parliament's first session since it
rewrote the Communist constitution to embrace democratic ideals.
   At its previous session, which ended Oct. 20, Parliament adopted

   Northwest Airlines reached settlements today in
all remaining lawsuits filed by victims' families over a 1987 crash
that killed 156 people.
   U.S. District Judge Julian A. Cook announced the settlements
this morning before opening arguments were to have begun in a trial
of the 145 remaining lawsuits. Terms of the settlements were not
disclosed.
   Eleven suits were settled earlier, and a 12th _ filed by a man
over the death of the five-month fetus carried by his
flight-attendant wife _ was thrown out.
   Suits are still pending against McDonnell Douglas Corp., maker
of the plane. Claims by McDonnell Douglas and Northwest against
each other also are unresolved.
   The trial was to have determined whether and to what degree
Northwest and McDonnell Douglas were to blame for the crash of
Flight 255 on takeoff from Detroit for Phoenix. Lawsuits over the
crash were consolidated into one case.
   The only survivor was Cecelia Cichan, then 4, of Tempe, Ariz.,
whose parents and brother died in the crash.
   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled in 1988 that the
pilots failed to set the plane's wing flaps and slats for takeoff
and failed to make mandatory preflight checks that would have
detected the error.
   Also, a cockpit warning system failed to alert the pilots the
flaps and slats were not set for takeoff, the NTSB said.

   President Bush announced today he would hold a
shipboard summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 2
and 3 aboard American and Soviet naval vessels in the
Mediterranean. A similar announcement came simultaneously from
Moscow.
   ``It's a chance to put our feet up and talk,'' Be the fallout, so be
it.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, questioned by reporters about the
summit, said, ``I think it's a very positive thing.'' He also
expressed his hope that the U.S.-Soviet session will ``stimulate
greater speed in moving on the arms control proposal.''
   An early Bush meeting with Gorbachev could give the
administration an opportunity to underscore its support for the
Soviet leader's program for restructuring the Soviet economy.
   Baker said in a speech Oct. 16 that the United States was
prepared to provide Moscow with advice and technical assistance. He
said perestroika presented a ``historic opportunity'' to make a
lasting improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   In an interview Monday, Baker said Gorbachev ``clearly faces
some very major problems.'' But, Baker told The Associated Press,
``it would be a mistake, notwithstanding that, just to stand pat.
We ought to try and take advantage of what we think is an
opportunity.''
   Bush's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, initially was skeptical of
Soviet motives in arms control negotiations and East-West relations
generally. But he held five meetings with Gorbachev after the
Soviet leader took power in 1985.
   Baker said at this point ``there are only nuances of
differences'' among senior U.S. officials on whether Gorbachev can
succeed in coping with ``extraordinary problems'' as he tries to
transform the country politically and economically.
   Calling that a question of ``durability,'' Baker said, ``I don't
think there is any policy difference in the administration on the
question of the desirability'' of the Soviet leader's perestroika
policy.
   Baker's comments were designed to put to rest the notion that
differences among top officials were slowing a U.S. response to
Gorbachev's bold approaches, particularly in Eastern Europe.
   Just last week, Baker acted to quash a speech by Robert M.
Gates, the deputy national security adviser, that took a
pessimistic view of Gorbachev's chances after Baker in two speeches
had set forth the administration's position welcoming the changes
in the Soviet Union. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has voiced
reservations similar to those in Gates' speech.
   A decision was made to hold the meeting on two ships in the
Mediterranean, said a senior administration official who briefed
reporters on the condition of anonymity, `because they wanted it
informal, isolated'' and to promote the concept of neutrality.

<TEXT>WASHINGTON: ...could you _    A: I'm trying to do something so _
to give everybody a little room so you can negotiate without getting it
all up here in a lot of turmoil.    Q: Now that it's out, sir, could you
tell us a little bit about the steps that led to this, your proposal, how
and when it was made, and so forth?    A: Well, I did say that I made
the proposal _ I believe it was in July _ in writing to the _ to the president,
and then got a very prompt response, and then we've been going back and
forth at that level, and then it's been discussed by the Secretary of State
and Mr. Shevardnadze, the details worked out.    Q: When was it agreed
upon?    A: Oh, a month ago, I'd say. Yes?    Q: Mr. President, since
July, several of your very top officials have said publicly that they didn't
see any value in having a summit if it couldn't be carefully prepared,
absolute guarantee of success with some kind of a serious outcome. You're
saying that's off.    A: No, the summit is on.    Q: Well, but what _
have they said no meeting _    A: No, I know _ who said that? 
  Q: I don't want to point a finger, but he's standing over here to the
side. ( aughter).    A: Well, they weren't speaking for the president.
I've told you what I think.    Q: No, but _    A: You know, there was
one time when I felt that such a meeting wouldn't be productive, and I
think it is going to be productive, but it's not going to be an agenda
_ we first set this _ an agenda meeting. We first set the summit. That
will drive the arms control agenda. That's out there with a date on it
_ rough time frame on it _ and so _ and the other is rapid change going
on. I now have a much clearer view of how our allies feel on East-West
relations. We've got problems in this hemisphere that I want to discuss,
and so the two are not inconsistent. Lesley.    Q: Mr. President, the
last time there was a summit like this was in Reykjavik, and it evolved
into a rather free-wheeling arms control negotiation that caused consternation
in Europe, because at one point, we were talking about eliminating
all nuclear weapons, which Europeans felt would give the Soviets an advantage
because of their preponderance of conventional superiority. What guarantees
are there that that won't happen at this meeting?    A: Well, because
it's _ neither side thinks it's going to happen, and we have a summit,
an arms control summit, a summit which will be dominated by arms control
issues already established, separate and apart, and the Soviet leader and
I both understand the kind of meeting we want to have, so I don't think
there's any confict there at all.    Q: Mr. President, is one of your
purposes in having this meeting to give Gorbachev a political boost at
home?    A: No. ... _ I hadn't particularly thought about that. If it
does, fine. I mean, they're _ as I said, we want to see perestroika succeed.
Yeah, Owen?    Q: Even though you say you don't have an agenda for this
meeting, can you tell us what do you think are the most pressing issues
that you want to raise with Mr. Gorbachev? What are the things that
are most important in your mind that you feel need to be raised and discussed
at this early date?    A: A wide array of regional issues, of this hemisphere,
Eastern Europe. Be sure I understand from him as clearly as possible his
aspirations for perestroika. There's all kinds of subjects that we'll be
discussing. I don't see a limit, but it's again _ I come back, there isn't
a set agenda on my _ in my mind. Charles?    Q: Mr. President, to what
extent have the events in Eastern Europe caused you perhaps to want to
accelerate this? Or will that be a major factor in your discussions? 
  A: I expect there will be a lot of discussion of that. But, as I indicated,
the genesis of this was in July when there was certainly change. We'd just
come back, as you recall, from Poland and Hungary. So _ and there's been
a lot of dramatic change since then _ in Germany, some moves in Czechoslovakia.
So things have moved, but I can't say that it _ that the meeting was predicated
on the change in Eastern Europe solely.    Q: Well,if not predicated,
has it been a factor in the discussions in arranging to have this meeting?
Has it been something that has been discussed, that East Europe _    A:
No, there's no arrangement. There's no subjects _ and I want to be very
clear on that. In any exchange I've had with Mr. Gorbachev, and in, I believe,
in Baker-Shevardnadze discussions, there hadn't been any discussion of
agenda items, or something we're going to take up. John?

   And who but Julia Child could get away with explaining yeast
dough in terms of burps: ``The main ingredients of flour are starch
and gluten. It's the starch in the dough that feeds upon the yeast,
belching forth gas that pushes up the gluten.''
   Child nurtures you through bread-baking, explaining how yeast
works, what flour to buy, what kneading is all about. Photographs
make it clear just how the dough should look along the way.
   And how can anyone resist trying a souffle when she writes:
   ``The souffle is undoubtedly the egg at its most magnificent,
the egg in all its puffing power. How impressive is the chocolate
or cheese souffle, its head rising dramatically out of its dish,
and swaying ever so slightly as it is borne to the table.''
   In a bow to health, she includes ``cream'' soups made with
pureed rice. But she also suggests adding heavy or sour cream ``if
you like.'' She also offers a fat-free ``heaven-sent'' poached
chicken and recommends a cast-iron grill to cook meat without fat.
   But she writes: ``I, for one, would rather swoon over a few thin
slices of prime beefsteak, or one small serving of chocolate
mousee, or a sliver of foie gras than indulge to the full on such
nonentities as fat-free gelatin puddings.''
   Child grew up in Pasadena, Calif., in a home with a hired cook,
and did not take a cooking lesson until she was in her 30s.
   She graduated from Smith College in 1934 and after writing
advertising copy for a short time, joined the Office of Strategic
Services, the forerunner of the CIA. She was sent off as a clerk to
Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where she met Paul Child, a career diplomat
10 years her senior, in 1943.
   They married in 1946 and remain very close; she often talks in
terms of ``we.'' He recently moved to a nursing home near their
Cambridge, Mass., home. They have no children.
   ``They just never came,'' she said matter-of-factly. ``I would
be very happy to be a grandmother at this point.'' But in addition
to her book, Child is busy these days working to improve the status
of food professionals through the American Institute of Wine and
Food, which she co-founded, and the James Beard Foundation in New
York.
   Two years after their marriage, the Childs were sent to Paris,
where she enrolled at the Cordon Bleu cooking school. She was
considered a bit odd by her friends, who all had hired help in the
kitchen.
   ``I'd been looking for my life's work all along. And when I got
into cooking I found it. I was inspired by the tremendous
seriousness with which they took it.''
   In France she also met Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, who
needed an American collaborator for the first volume of ``Mastering
the Art of French Cooking.'' Nine years in the making, it was
published in 1961 with a foreword that began: ``This is a book for
the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion
with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children's meals, the
parent-chauffeur-den mother syndrome, or anything else which might
interfere with the enjoyment of producing something wonderful to
eat.''
   And it ends: ``Above all, have a good time.''
   Two years later, when Child was 51, WGBH in Boston launched
``The French Chef'' series, and for 206 meals, she entertained and
cajoled and encouraged viewers to do as she did.
   ``I happened to be the right woman at the right time,'' she said
with modesty, noting that John F. Kennedy had a French chef at the
White House and more Americans were traveling abroad.
   ``Suddenly people began considering food with a capital `F'.''
   Besides, she was fun to watch, perhaps partly because of the
on-air disasters, the first of which occurred with an apple
charlotte.
   ``As I was looking, it did a slow collapse. You could hear the
tears in my voice.'' To cover, she told viewers: ``You don't want
it too stiff.''
   But the mistakes taught viewers how to make repairs, and made
her more familiar.
   And since it's the good company that counts, her advice to
others who make mistakes: ``Don't apologize ever. It's very bad to
apologize because people will say, `That wasn't very good, was it?'
''

   A 3-year-old boy playing with a toy
pistol was accidentally shot to death by his grandfather who
thought his own real revolver was unloaded, police said.
   Arash Valizadeh of San Ramon was killed Monday by a gunshot
wound to the heart fired by George Clifford Lewis, 72, said Manteca
police Sgt. David Thompson.
   Lewis, who was baby-sitting at his home in this community 75
miles east of San Francisco, was treated at a hospital for chest
pains after he shot his grandson with a .22-caliber revolver,
Thompson said.
   No charges were filed.
   The boy ``said `bang, bang,' and his grandfather was joining in
the game,'' Thompson said.
   ``It's quite a tragic situation,'' Thompson said. ``It was a
typical case of not taking a gun too seriously. Time after time,
somebody gets killed with an `empty' gun.''

<TEXT>
   Moving faster than a speeding bullet, though not
at all as powerful as a locomotive, CBS' ``The Pat Sajak Show'' has
begun life anew with a 60-minute format.
   Sajak's late-night talk show, begun in January, was a relatively
leisurely 90-minute affair that failed to yield Nielsen results
against NBC's ``Tonight Show'' and Arsenio Hall's syndicated talk
and music festival.
   Hmm, said CBS, let us tighten Sajak to one hour. The network
even installed a vice president, Rod Perth, to oversee the
retooling.
   The result, which made its debut Monday from Los Angeles,
indicates that CBS thinks salvation lies in a far brisker pace and
more high energy.
   If so, CBS is out of its nut.
   Sajak, tieless and wearing a gray jacket that matched the show's
gray sofa, joked with announcer Dan Miller about the new format,
said haste is needed, but claimed that the hour format is a better
one.
   That done, he welcomed Joan Rivers, who recently began her own
syndicated talk show. Looking slightly haggard but quite energetic,
Rivers commenced a rapid-fire string of observations, some on the
tasteless side.
   Inquiring minds who wanted to know and those who didn't learned
about her flu attack and gastrointestinal state; about breasts, and
what happens to California women whose string bikinis are too
tight. She also said she took Marlon Brando to Marineland for sushi.
   She kidded Sajak, 43, several times about his fiancee before
assailing _ just joking, of course _ the lady's character in what
proved to be her exit line.
   Enter jazz-rock violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. He played fast and
furiously, then was grilled by Sajak on such issues as why he took
up violin and his early problems with English. Ponty talked fairly
slowly.
   The final visitor, ``Chicken Soup'' co-star Lynn Redgrave, spoke
quickly of the silliness of censorship and playfully emitted a few
not-so-shocking examples of what some might still consider naughty.
She also said, with pride, that her 8-year-old daughter has two
lines of dialogue on tonight's Halloween episode.
   Censoring herself, Redgrave said her show is on a network whose
name ``begins with the first letter of the alphabet.'' Sajak,
casting caution to the airwaves, later said the show was on ABC.
   It was a strained night of fast pace and forgettable chatter. No
doubt it was due to a platoon of network executives who proposed so
many ideas that the show's suggestion box suffered a double hernia.
   Sajak may not be to blame for the poor restart of his series.
His manner is low-key. Asking him to go supersonic is folly. Those
who knew his early TV work in Nashville, particularly in the
late-movie announcer's booth, say he has an Ernie Kovacs mind.
   If that's the case, CBS might ask him what it was he did there
and give it a whirl. He might be able to build a following.

   Marmet Junior High School's annual
homecoming event was complete with a halftime ceremony featuring a
marching band and the crowning of a queen. What was missing was the
football game.
   The school's team disbanded several weeks ago after the coach
quit, but that was no reason to cancel the homecoming celebration.
   ``It was already scheduled so we went ahead and held it,''
acting Principal James Dillinger said. ``It would be like not
having a prom in high school.''
   Last week, students led a parade through Marmet to the football
field, where a homecoming queen was crowned before hundreds of
spectators. The ceremony ended with introductions of the football
team.
   ``It's a little bit unusual,'' the principal said. ``It would be
nicer to have a football game.''

<TEXT>
   Q: You say this pre-summit summit is not meant to bail out Mr.
Gorbachev politically. How about yourself? You've been criticized
by the Democrats for being too timid toward Eastern Europe and
toward Gorbachev, helping him with perestroika. Do you think it
will help you?
   A: That's not why we're doing it, but if that should be the
fallout, so be it. We've known what we're doing. We've been on this
track for some time. I've elected to remain very quiet in the face
of a good deal of sentiment that we were missing an opportunity.
And that _ that hasn't perturbed me because we've got good people
that know what we're doing in terms of the Soviet Union. And if
people see that a little more clearly now, so be it; that's a plus.
   Q: It seems as though you're going there without any
initiatives. And we're trying to read between the lines here. If
that's the case, aren't you going to be accused once again of being
timid?
   A: Oh, I'm sure somebody'd politically accuse me of anything, I
mean, but that's not the point. I think _ I think _ I tell you one
thing, our allies will be delighted about this. They've just been
informed this morning. And I guarantee you there will be enthusiasm
through much of the free world and a lot of the rest of the world.
But, look, I don't expect to have everybody that's been firing away
at me up there jump up with joy, but I _ we've just briefed the
congressional leaders and they seem to be quite enthusiastic about
this. They had not known about it, and I've got to let them speak
for themselves, but some who have not been overly supportive in the
last few days seem to feel this is a very good thing to be doing.
Gerry?
   Q: Mr. President, you said a few weeks ago you thought there was
a good chance to complete a START agreement by the time the real
summit in the spring or summer comes around. Are you still holding
to that feeling? Are things on track? Will this meeting, though
it's not an arms control meeting, push that process along?
   A: I don't think this meeting will push that process along, but
I'm still holding to that feeling.
   Q: Mr. President, you said repeatedly that you'd like to see
perestroika succeed.
   A: Yeah.
   Q: What plans, if any, does the administration have to make sure
that happens, in terms of any kind of economic assistance or
anything of the sort?
   A: Well, we haven't been asked for any economic assistance, and
maybe this is one of the items that we will be discussing. What I
want clear to make clear to Mr. Gorbachev, and I have done that,
and I don't think there's been a disconnect with the Soviets, is
that we do want to see it succeed. But we'll be discussing that.
   Q: Let me ask _ are you also concerned that reforms in the
Soviet Union may be moving too quickly and it could result in a
government crackdown a la China?
   A: Well, some have suggested that I am _ they use a different
word for it, but _ a little too much on the cautious side. I think
there is reason to be cautious, and I've said that over and over
again. Substitute the word ``prudent'' if you want. But I think at
this meeting, at this meeting I'll be _ after this meeting I'll be
better able to answer your question, because I know Mr. Gorbachev
to be a very frank individual, just from the contacts that I've had
with him, which have been not as many as some, but more than most.
And I think, I think that I'll be able to give you a better answer,
because that's one of the things I want us to _ I don't want to
have two gigantic ships pass in the night because of failed
communication. Tom?
   Q: Mr. President, right before and right after the Wyoming
meetings, the guidance from your closest advisers here was that
there was not going to be a pre-summit summit, and they were
specifically ruling out a meeting of this sort anytime this year.
Now, were we being deliberately misled? And assuming that we
weren't, what changed?
   A: That's one of the dangers of not telling what you know to
everybody. There could be some disconnect in that. But one of the
benefits is that the Soviets see we're dealing in good faith. Yes?
   Q: Was there a feeling on your part, Mr. President, that perhaps
waiting for spring and summer was a little bit too long, too
tenuous, since no date has been set for spring or summer?
   A: No, because I think they are two separate kinds of meetings.
One of them is to _ is to _ one of them, announced as it is, will
drive the arms control agenda, and the other one is the kind of
meeting I talked about. So, I don't _ it's not a question, Saul, of
thinking, ``if we didn't have this meeting, too long would go.''
Or, I remember in 1984, people kept saying, ``Ronald Reagan hasn't
even sat down with the Soviet leaders.'' They were admittedly
changing pretty fast in those days, but he said that, you know, and
people were _ the critics were on him about it. I don't feel that
that _ that had anything to do with it _ ``well, we've got to do it
sooner because we won't see each other till September'' _ I mean,
till, you know, the summer _ if that's _ spring of summer _ if that
was your question.

   East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenz
headed to Moscow today to discuss reform proposals with the
architect of perestroika, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The official news agency ADN reported this afternoon that Krenz
had flown to the Soviet Union but it did not specify when he
departed.
   He was scheduled to meet with Gorbachev on Wednesday morning and
hold a news conference in the afternoon before leaving the Soviet
capital, ADN said.
   Krenz's first foreign trip East Germany's leader began after a
night demonstrations in nine cities. About 500,000 East Germans
took to the streets to demand democratic reforms in the largest
protests in East Germany's 40-year history; about 300,000 people
marched through Leipzig.
   East Germany's largest opposition group today sent a message of
support to human rights activists in Czechoslovakia.
   The statement from the New Forum opposition group, which counts
more than 15,000 members, reflected the growing feeling that
Krenz's leadership is serious about loosening restrictions on free
speech.
   ``We are convinced that new times will come to you, too, and
that the Prague Spring will finally have its Summer,'' New Forum
said in a letter sent to Czechoslovak human rights activists. The
letter was made public in West Berlin.
   Czechoslovakia began a sweeping program of liberal reforms under
Communist leader Alexander Dubcek, but the so-called ``Prague
Spring'' was quashed by the Warsaw Pact invasion of August 1968.
   The current Communist leadership in Prague has strongly rejected
the need for reforms and has dealt harshly with dissent.
   About 10,000 people demonstrated in Prague on Saturday for more
democracy. Protesters were beaten by police and more than 300 were
arrested.
   Monday's protests in East Germany took place in Leipzig, Halle,
Schwerin, Karl-Marx-Stadt, Cottbus, Magdeburg, Dresden, Poessneck
and East Berlin, according to the state-run news agency ADN.
   Activists said marchers demanded that the Communist Party
relinquish its monopoly on power. Witnesses also said the
protesters carried signs demanding free elections and the
legalization of opposition groups.
   There were no reports of violence or arrests.
   The protests of recent weeks followed an exodus of East Germans
to the West. Since August, nearly 70,000 _ many of them young
skilled workers _ have fled to the West.
   Krenz replaced hard-liner Erich Honecker on Oct. 18 and the
government has launched an unparalleled campaign of dialogue and
openness aimed at winning public trust.
   In a speech to military academy graduates Monday, Krenz
reiterated his belief in the Communist Party's leading role in
society.
   He said the party was ``at the head of qualitative changes going
on in society.''
   Krenz has promised changes including freer travel to the West
and amnesty for people jailed for trying to escape the
tightly-controlled society and for those who have succeeded.
   He has also declared that East Germany has much to learn from
reforms in the Soviet Union, a major reversal from Honecker's
contention that such changes were unnecessary.
   A leader of East Germany's Communist-allied Liberal Democratic
Party charged Monday that the country's ``political structure no
longer corresponds to the will of the people.''
   Manfred Bogisch suggested in a commentary in his party's
newspaper, Der Morgen, that the Communists' leading role would have
to be won, not dictated.
   Although Bogisch said socialism was not at issue in the reform
discussion, he said the Communist leadership's policies are `now a
matter of debate.''
   Under East Germany's constitution, all recognized political
parties are allied with the Communists. However, the Liberal
Democrats have said the other parties should have more independence.
   Also Monday, leaders of the country's government-aligned trade
union federation met to discuss a confidence vote called by the
union's leader.
   Union head Harry Tisch, who also sits on the ruling Politburo,
asked for the vote on his leadership after many young members
charged the union served only the interests of the government,
neglecting workers' needs.
   The official ADN news agency said a final decision on Tisch's
vote had been postponed until Nov. 17, when the union leadership
plans to meet again.
   The agency reported that some members had already withdrawn
their support for Tisch but that the majority still backed him.
   In a statement carried by ADN late Monday, the trade union
leadership said the nation's Communist system faced ``serious
danger.''
   However, it said it was partly to blame for letting problems
pile up and pledged to better represent the interests of workers in
the future.

   A Vietnamese man who escaped from
his homeland by lashing himself to the rudder housing of a tanker
for two days in monsoon seas has been denied asylum in the United
States, a senator said today.
   The request for immediate asylum was rejected by the State
Department, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service will
allow the stowaway to stay in the country while it reviews the
request, said Bill Bryant, a spokesman for Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I.
   Bryant did not know how long the review would take.
   The Polish captain of the tanker has taken up the cause of the
23-year-old man, discovered during a routine lifeboat drill two
days out of Ho Chi Minh City.
   ``I know what living in a closed society is like,'' the captain,
Jerzy Kolasinski, said Monday, when the man was interviewed here by
INS officers.
   Officials refused to release the name of the stowaway, who was
met by immigration officials when the tanker docked at the Mobil
Oil Co. terminal Monday. He was confined to the ship pending the
appeal.
   The crew of the Cypriot tanker Success made two checks of the
ship for stowaways before leaving Ho Chi Minh City, Kolasinski
said. Then, on Aug. 30, they spotted the man, perched on a
makeshift plywood seat on the rudder housing, about four feet above
the water.
   He had been exposed to the waves and 100-degree heat for more
than 48 hours while the ship steamed down the Saigon River into the
South China Sea, the captain said.
   The refugee had only a container of water that was almost empty,
a package of cigarettes and a butane lighter, and had tied himself
to the ship with a length of hemp, Kolasinski said.
   ``This was ... the monsoon season in the southwest China Sea. It
was very stormy and he could have been washed off at any time,''
the captain said.
   Kolasinski detoured to Singapore and asked immigration officials
there to take the man. They refused, citing their lack of
diplomatic ties with the communist country, he said.
   The captain said he also tried seeking asylum for the man in
Bahrain in the Persian Gulf; Dubai, part of the United Arab
Emirates and Yambu in Saudi Arabia.
   ``Nobody cared about this man,'' Kolasinski said. ``He is
normal, intelligent person, and a normal person would not have
risked what he did for economic reasons.''
   The man, communicating to the Polish crew in sign language,
volunteered to work for passage, and Kolasinski said he was kept
busy with odd jobs.
   The ship's insurance agent, William W. Whit, a representative of
Lloyds of London, said that if the asylum request is denied,
Lloyd's will be responsible for returning the man to Vietnam.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ...your question.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: Yes, Maureen? Let me get there in back.
   Q: Mr. President, but then what changed your mind? Because this
is exactly the kind of meeting that you and your aides have been
saying for months, you did not want, and it seems exactly the kind
of meeting that Gorbachev, given his domestic troubles, needs very,
very much. What changed your mind, and why were you the one _
   A: My _ I'll tell you what changed my mind on it was
consultation with our allies; the rapidity of change in Eastern
Europe; the emergence of democracies in this hemisphere; and this
concept that I just didn't want to, in this time of dynamic change,
miss something, something that I might get better first-hand from
Mr. Gorbachev. Yes, in the back.
   Q: Mr. President _
   Q: Mr. President, what made you decide to meet on a ship?
   A: Well, we can do it without too much fanfare. We can do it
without _ where there's a relatively few number of people, not a
lot of crush of bodies out there, and a _ chance to put our feet up
and talk in the kind of meeting that I have just described for you.
And it will _ I think it's easy logistically for both sides.
   Q: How much time do you think you will spend face to face? In
your mind, what do you think it's going to take to get _
   A: A lot. A lot. And I can't tell you in hours, but we're going
to have small numbers of participants on both sides. I _ maybe I'm
getting a little ahead of the power curve there, but I know that's
my intention and I think the Soviet side has agreed to that and
it'll _ by doing it in this manner, we can have, I would say, more
time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint
appearances, things of that nature for public consumption.
   Q: Mr. President, between hemispheric summits and drug summits
and Gorbachev summits and economic summits, you're doing a lot of
mountaineering. Let me ask you this _
   A: This one isn't a summit. So scratch this one off your list of
things to worry about. I've got to make that point over and over
again. ``Summits'' take on a definition, an expectation of grand
design and grand agreements, and that's not what this is.
   Q: Let me ask you about this expectation then. About six months
ago, you proposed your conventional force reductions for Europe. If
something came through on your six-month deadline, presumably you
would want a summit with Mr. Gorbachev to sign it. Are we going to
have a third Gorbachev summit in 1990?
   A: No anticipation of it. But, look, we'll meet as often or as
little as we need to.
   Q: Well, how is that going? How is the conventional forces thing
going?
   A: Reasonably well. We still have to driving for the best we
can, our alliance, to be sure that we keep moving forward to meet a
rather ambitious time frame. Dave, and then we'll go back.
   Q: Mr. President, one of the criticisms that's been made is _ by
the Democrats particularly _ is that this is a really unique time
for you, that after 40 years of calling for free markets and open
society, that you have chance to perhaps cement some of these
changes in the Eastern Bloc in Europe and in the Soviet Union? Do
you have some kind of plan or vision for getting that accomplished?
Is this part of it?
   A: We're seeing it move, aren't we? We're seeing dynamic change,
and I want to handle it properly. I want to do whatever the U.S.
can do to facilitate these kinds of changes. You heard what I had
to say yesterday _ some of you all did _ in terms of Poland and the
group we're sending over there to help solidify the changes that
are taking place. And I've got a good group of people working with
me in this administration, knowledgeable about Europe, that assures
me that we can move this whole process _ process forward properly.
Some things have to _ the United States can't wave a wand, and say
how fast change is going to come to Czechoslovakia or to the GDR.
Way in the back. Carl, and Craig.
   Q: Mr. President, you say there will be no agreements at this
meeting. Is it possible, however, that you might firm up the date
for the meeting next year, for the official meeting?
   A: Could be. Could be. And I don't want to say that _ I guess
maybe I ought to retreat a little, and say _ not saying there would
be no agreements. The meeting is not being set up to achieve
agreements. I would hope we'd see eye to eye on certain things when
we get through, and maybe more narrowly define _ more precisely
define what differences we have. Craig, and then John.

<TEXT>
   Q: Are we to believe that the leader of the United States and
the leader of the Soviet Union will get together, and there will be
no discussion of arms control? Or what role in this meeting will
that play?
   A: I don't know, but there's not an arms control meeting.
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: Yes, John.
   Q: You keep talking about the rapid change in Eastern Europe. If
Mr. Gorbachev would suggest that the United States be more generous
in aid to Hungary, to Poland, and perhaps even to East Germany, how
receptive would you be to that idea?
   A: Well, we've got _ we've got an aid package and program, and
I'd welcome his ideas. But I don't think we could _ we would
respond to, you know, his charge on that. I think we'd have to do
it, what we felt was the right way to do, and exactly what I have
been doing. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, over the past several months, you've had
exchanges of letters with Mr. Gorbachev. Could you tell us if
there's been a change in your evaluation of him as a person, or how
you're feeling about him?
   A: No change. As I've indicated, I have a positive view of him
to begin with. But I haven't felt any changes there. I will say
that when I made this proposal, there was a very prompt response,
and the only reason it's taken time between the July initiative on
my part and his very prompt response that I think was fired back in
August, has been just working out where and how to do this. So I've
not had occasion to change my view. But as you look at the
different meetings, and if you look at the _ the way this
relationship is developing, there are a lot of positive signs. We
all go back, in one capacity or another, to times when the rhetoric
was much tougher, where you had a lot of _ well, you had a very
different approach to openness in the Soviet Union than you do now.
So I think the relationship is moving in the right direction. But I
still _ when I say ``cautious'' or ``prudent,'' I think that's the
way we ought to do it. And I will have an opportunity to explain
that when I see Mr. Gorbachev. Yes?
   Q: So you think his motivation is what he says it is?
   A: I _ you mean, do I question his word? I think he's committed
to reform, absolutely.
   Q: Mr. President, Secretary of State Baker has mentioned the
possibility of technical assistance and advice on the Soviet _
state of the Soviet economy. How far would you be willing to go
with that kind of thing?
   A: Well, again, we _ I don't know how much _ how far they want
to go. And this is one of the subjects we'll be discussing. Way in
the back.
   Q: What does the administration have in mind _
   Q: Mr. President, there's been a lot of talk around town about
the survivability of Gorbachev, especially going into the winter
months and the prospect of strikes in the Soviet Union and so
forth. When you say you would like to see perestroika succeed in
the Soviet Union, do you equate that with the success of Gorbachev
personally?
   A: I think it's tied up in that right now, yes.
   Q: And do you think if there is anything that you could do to
help strengthen his position in the Soviet Union, that you would do
it?
   A: Well, I think we've got to know what ``it'' is. And _ but
this is the kind of discussion we can have. I will say this: I
don't think you base the foreign policy of a great power like the
United States on one personality. I don't think you do that. I
don't think that is a prudent way to approach this.
   Q: Mr. President, let's have a domestic summit, on some domestic
problem like health care! The high cost of _
   A: Wait, I'm getting criticized for having too many summits as
it is! (Laughter.)
   Q: No, you need one on _ you need one on domestic issues. We've
spent a long time here talking about things when we have a vital
crucial situation out there _ catastrophic illness is nothing, it
would not take care of the situation. We had a press conference
here all day yesterday where the Canadian government officials got
up and said, ``In the United States, you only have health care for
the rich, not for the poor.'' Why can't we have a good system like
theirs, and why can't we have a summit on health care?
   A: I think what we've got to do is educate the Canadians if they
feel that way, because that's not true. That is not true. And to
suggest that it's true that our health care system is only that
simply shows _ I don't know who those officials were _ but it was
never raised with me by the Prime Minister.
   Q: Well, the Health Care _ Health Minister of Canada _
   A: We've got a lot of problems _ we've got a lot of problems.
   Q: _ (inaudible) _ that you only have health care in this
country for the rich, and not for the poor.
   A: Well _ that's where _ that's a point I'd argue. Yes, Rita.

   In the time it takes to light a flag, the
courts have their first cases to test a new law outlawing the
burning of Old Glory.
   Gregory Johnson, the protester whose 1984 flag burning led the
Supreme Court to legalize the act, was arrested with three other
people Monday as they ripped and burned American flags on the steps
of the Capitol.
   Capitol policemen tore pieces of a shredded flag from the hands
of one demonstrator who lit the first flag.
   The other protesters unfurled flags and set them afire as all
four chanted, ``burn baby burn'' before policemen aimed fire
extinguishers at the burning remnants, bathing the scene in white
smoke.
   They invited the arrest to protest the Flag Protection Act of
1989, the statute that took effect only Saturday. The protesters
were charged with violating the new statute, demonstrating without
a permit and disorderly conduct.
   They were transferred to the custody of city police and were
held in jail pending arraignment on the charges today.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas told the Senate
today that the ``outrage'' of a flag burning on the Capitol steps
gives the Supreme Court a chance to ``redeem itself from last
June's blunder.''
   ``I hope that Gregory Johnson is convicted and that _ this time
_ his conviction is upheld by the Supreme Court,'' Dole said. ``And
I hope that the Flag Protection Act of 1989 does not become `the
flag-burners protection act after all the smoke has cleared.'''
   But Dole said he continues to believe that the law is ``nothing
more than legal hocus pocus _ that it is grossly overbroad and
probably unconstitutional.'' And he said he remains convinced that
the real answer to ``the flag-burning problem is a constitutional
amendment.''
   On Monday, Nancy Kent, speaking for the group, made clear they
intended to test the law Congress passed following the Supreme
Court decision last June that flag burning as a political protest
is protected speech under the First Amendment to the Constitution.
   ``We challenge you,'' Miss Kent said, reading a prepared
statement. ``Arrest us. Test your statute. Take it back to the
Supreme Court and try once again to claim it is all consistent with
your constitutional standards of free speech.''
   Also on Monday, the 1984 charge against Johnson was officially
dismissed in Texas by Dallas County Criminal Judge John Hendrik.
The dismissal came five months after the Supreme Court ruling
overturning his conviction.
   Hendrik called the dismissal ``the most distasteful duty of my
nine-year judicial career'' and said he did it ``only because of my
oath.''
   And in Seattle on Monday, FBI agents watched as about a dozen
University of Washington students burned U.S. flags to protest the
new federal law. No arrests were made.
   David Cole, who said he represents Johnson as a staff attorney
for the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City, said he
and his client believe the new law is just as unconstitutional as
the statute it replaced.
   Capitol police identified the four persons arrested as Johnson,
33, of Richmond, Ind.; Shawn Eichner, 24, of New York City; David
Blalock, 39, of Johnstown, Pennsylvania; and Scott ``Dread Scott''
Tyler, 24, of Chicago.
   Miss Kent said Blalock is a member of the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War; Eichman represents Coalition Opposed to Censorship
in the Arts; and Johnson is a member of the Revolutionary Communist
Youth Brigade.
   Tyler stirred criticism in Chicago earlier this year by placing
a flag on the floor as part of a student exhibit at the School of
the Art Institute. The display asked viewers to describe the proper
way to display the flag and included a register that was placed so
writers had to stand on the flag to record their opinions.
   The flag law, which President Bush allowed to take force without
his signature, sparked a series of protest flag burnings in cities
across the country over the weekend.
   It provides punishment of up to one year in jail and a fine for
anyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles,
burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag
of the United States.''
   Bush questioned whether the new law meets constitutional tests
and favors a constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the
flag.

<TEXT>
   A major underground nuclear weapons test
measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale rocked the Nevada desert today
and sent shock waves as far away as this gaming capital, 105 miles
from ground zero.
   Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer pronounced the test
``highly successful.''
   The test, the first since Sept. 14, was conducted at the bottom
of a shaft 1,850 feet beneath the surface. Boyer said instruments
indicated no radioactivity had escaped the ground.
   No nuclear protesters were at the gates to the sprawling desert
site, Boyer said. Protesters have turned out for many past tests.
   John Minsch, spokesman at the National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., said the 5.8 reading on the Richter scale
was one of the higher levels recorded for such tests.
   Energy Department seismographic equipment on highrise hotels in
Las Vegas recorded the blast, with some locations recording a four
on a scale of one to six. A four indicates some rolling motion
could be detected.
   Several hotel operators said the test apparently went undetected
by guests.
   Boyer said the 7:30 a.m. blast was expected to have an explosive
force of 20,000 to 150,000 tons of TNT.
   Managers of highrise buildings in Las Vegas were cautioned not
to have workers in precarious positions at the time, an indication
the blast would be near the 150-kiloton limit set by agreement with
the Soviet Union.
   The test was the ninth of the year at the nation's nuclear
proving grounds and the 696th announced blast since nuclear testing
began there in 1951.

   Richard M. Nixon told Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday
some Chinese leaders had lost respect in the United States, and
Deng accused Washington of involvement in the democracy movement
that China's army crushed in June.
   China's 85-year-old senior leader told the former president that
``China has not done one single thing harmful to the United
States'' in the past decade, according to Xinhua, the official
Chinese news agency.
   A member of the Nixon party who attended the meeting between
Deng and the American leader who opened the door to China in 1972
characterized their conversation as a ``a very tough,
no-holds-barred exchange.''
   Nixon also met with Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin on Tuesday
about the ``tragedy'' of the military crackdown on student-led
dissent, the American informant said.
   Nixon told Deng he had observed relations closely for 17 years
and ``there has never been a more difficult crisis than at the
present time.''
   He said it was important to discuss differences and ``repair the
damage that has been done to the respect in the United States among
China's friends for some of China's leaders.''
   He did not identify those leaders. Deng, Premier Li Peng and
President Yang Shangkun have been singled out for ordering the June
attack on pro-democracy demonstrators in which hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of people were killed.
   According to Xinhua, Deng said the United States ``was involved
too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' the
government's terms for the democracy movement.
   ``China was the real victim and it is unjust to reprove China
for it,'' he said.
   Deng and Nixon, who was on the fourth day of a private visit,
agreed that ideological differences should be overcome and
relations improved on the basis of common strategic interests.
   ``I'm very much in favor of your view regarding state-to-state
relations,'' Deng said to Nixon as they met at the Great Hall of
the People. ``You should focus on the strategic interests of a
country and you should not talk about historical roots or
differences in ideology or the strength of a country.''
   Nixon has urged the governments to bury their differences over
the crushing of dissent and mend their frayed relations.
   Washington suspended high-level contacts and arms sales after
the June attack. China has repeatedly accused the United States of
trying to subvert its communist system and criticized the Americans
for harboring dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian in
their Beijing embassy.
   After the meeting with Deng, Nixon said he was optimistic the
U.S.-Chinese relationship ``will be sustained and those that are
signalling its death are much premature.''
   When he made his first trip to China in 1972, Nixon said,
``There was hardly anything we agreed upon. We disagreed about
Korea, we disagreed about Japan, we disagreed about Vietnam, we
disagreed about philosophy.
   ``Today we have a profound disagreement about a very tragic
incident, but that disagreement is not going to derail the
relationship. ... If we could do it in '72, we can do it now.''
   Deng praised Nixon for ending the 1949-72 freeze in relations
and said: ``What you've done deserves our admiration and interest.''
   Nixon spent two hours with Jiang Zemin, the man Deng chose as
party chief after the reformist Zhao Ziyang was purged in June.
   Their topics included the crackdown, political and economic
reform in China, the status of Chinese students at home and in the
United States, the Soviet Union and reform in Eastern Europe, the
Nixon staff member said.
   ``President Nixon encouraged the Chinese to consider a number of
measures that would improve the climate for Sino-American
relations,'' the informant said without elaboration.
   Nixon is the most prominent American to visit China since June.
He leaves on Thursday and is expected to report to President Bush.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, commenting on the visit
Monday, said the United States wanted normal relations but
conditions still were not right.

   More than 1,000 people have lined up for
hours to see the fate of teen-age drug abusers in a ``haunted crack
house'' in this rural town, where the police chief says no real
cocaine dens exist.
   Since this Eastern Shore village of 2,000 opened its Halloween
attraction late last week, children and adults have mobbed the town
square to enter the house of horrors in the former county jail.
   On Monday evening, the night before the final performance, the
line started forming 1{ hours before the first show.
   ``They say it's real spooky. They say it's going to scare you to
death. ... It's supposed to teach you a lesson,'' Randy Robinson, a
high school student from nearby Grasonville, said as he waited to
get in.
   ``Some of them go through two or three times. I don't think it's
just that it's such a good scare, I think people just like what's
going on in there,'' said Leon Demby, a volunteer who portrays
``Mr. Cocaine'' in one scene. ``Some people think this should have
been done a long time ago.''
   Visitors tour 11 stations starting with a courtroom starring a
real-life judge and ending with a graveyard, where actors in black
costumes and white makeup beg for help from their tombs.
   The show was organized by and stars dozens of local government
workers, members of civic groups and high school drama club
members, who rallied around the idea proposed by Police Chief John
Lechliter.
   ``Every time you pick up a newspaper, what do you see? Crack,
crack, crack,'' Lechliter said. ``This is a drug abuser's odyssey,
if you will.''
   He supervised the planning of the program, which begins outside
with a police helicopter zooming over the crowd to shine its
spotlight on a young man selling drugs to a teen-age girl. Real
police burst out of the bushes; the man pulls out a pistol and the
officers fire shotguns loaded with blanks.
   Groups of 12 are then led through the house by figures dressed
as ghosts and ghouls to witness the pair's arraignment and scenes
of children confessing their drug addictions to parents. In one
room, a teen-ager succumbs to her friends' cajoling and takes a
fatal drug overdose.
   In the next room, the feeling of being under the influence of
crack, a highly addictive form of cocaine, is portrayed by flashing
strobe lights and loud thumping sound effects. Then comes an
emergency room scene, the morgue and the graveyard.
   Even Lechliter, who said he thought the performance might give
children nightmares, was unprepared for the macabre fascination the
attraction aroused. On the first night, organizers said more than
600 people showed up to take the half-hour tour, and nearly half
had to be turned away.
   On Saturday, Lechliter said he had to stop people from joining
an even longer line an hour after the house opened. Even so,
volunteers gave tours until after midnight.
   The house received national attention and even attracted a film
crew from Japan. Cub Scouts arrived by bus from Kentucky and
Pennsylvania.
   ``In a small town, this is the biggest thing that's ever
happened,'' said Elaine Pratzner, owner of Centreville's video
store.
   Residents, including Lechliter, say drugs do not pose a major
crime problem in Centreville, which is 40 miles southeast of
Baltimore. But they say the danger should not be taken lightly.
   ``Are there drugs in town? Yes. Is it a big problem? No, except
that any drugs are a problem,'' Lechliter said. ``We're pro-active.
We're out to prevent it.''
   After the tour, two youngsters scooted away when asked if they
considered the presentation frightening. Their mother followed them.
   ``They're too scared to talk,'' she said, before disappearing
into the night.

production from Uzbekistan in several years, Tass said.
   Tass said the oil field will provide millions of tons of oil and
it is the largest deposit ever discovered in Uzbekistan or

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Yes, Rita.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, turning to Nicaragua for a minute. Today _ or
yesterday _ President Ortega now suggests that Rev. Jackson be used
as an intermediary to talk about redirecting the U.S. humanitarian
aid so it can be used to demobilize the contras. What would be your
thoughts on having Rev. Jackson involved between us and Nicaragua?
And are you in any way thinking of refocusing the aid from the
United States?
   A: That suggestion has limited appeal for me. (Laughter).
   Q: I wonder _ I wonder if you _ it might help to enlist
Secretary Gorbachev's support in encouraging reforms in some of the
more reticent Eastern Europe states like _ Eastern European states
_ like East Germany?
   A: I want to discuss it with him. Again, I'm not suggesting,
given his public statements, that he is going to be the one that
controls what happens, you know, in every detail in Czechoslovakia
or East Germany. But, it is a subject that we should discuss, just
as I'm sure he'll want to discuss changes in this hemisphere here
or others. So, I think that will come up.
   Q: Would you expect them to look favorably upon _ upon your
request for a little help _ a little pressure maybe?
   A: A little pressure on what?
   Q: Well, a little pressure on the leaders of East Germany,
perhaps, to lighten up on people who want to leave.
   A: Well, we'll have a chance to discuss all of those things, and
that's one of the good things about it. There will not be a certain
agenda on it. We'll simply sit down and I'll give you my views on
the changes that are taking place in Eastern Europe, and certainly
I'm most interested in getting his. Yes, Frank.
   Q: Mr. President, a two-part question. First of all, after you
meet Gorbachev, will you take the opportunity, since you'll be in
the region, to then meet with and brief allied leaders and solicit
their comments? And secondly, why did you hold this deliberation so
tightly? You said you wanted to show the Soviet Union good faith.
But why not involve the bureaucracy? Your administration, as you
know, has been criticized _
   A: Because I knew exactly what I wanted to do and I knew how I
wanted to go about doing it. And that's why I didn't need to. I
didn't need the advice of others in this particular subject matter.
I knew how I wanted to do it, I knew that I wanted to get the
summit, the arms control summit set. And I also knew that I wanted
to _ after the discussions I told you about, to go forward with
this. And I wanted to deal in good faith with the Soviets, because
until it was firmly locked, I should not be in a mode of committing
them to this kind of a meeting. And I think all that worked. And I
hope what we've done is to develop a certain confidence in the
Soviets as a result of these negotiations. Confidence is important.
If you're going to have frank exchanges, then you have to have a
certain degree of confidentiality. But on this one, I told you who
was involved in it. I was getting good sound advice. How they got
the information on which to advise me, why that's their business.
But I felt no deprivation of being deprived from information at
all. Kathy?
   Q: How about the first part, though, sir? Meeting with the
allies afterwards?
   A: No plans to do that. This is going to be done _ if you look
at the calendar _ like over a weekend. And, of course, we'll be in
full contact with them after that, but I don't plan to jump from
country to country after the meeting. Kathy?
   Q: Mr. President, one of the Summits _ capital ``S'' _ on your
agenda is the Economic Summit. Have you made a decision and are
next week's elections in Houston in any way a factor in why you
haven't announced it so far?
   A: No, those elections have no relevance to the decision. And
no, the decision has not been made. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, you say you have confidence in the Soviets.
What assurances do you have that you won't be surprised by
something Mr. Gorbachev might bring to the table? It's widely
believed that President Reagan was somewhat sandbagged in Reykjavik.
   A: He's free to bring anything he wants. There's no agenda. But
there's _ the idea that arms control _ we might be surprised on
arms control. I don't worry about that because we've got an
understanding that the already announced summit meeting will handle
those items.
   Q: Do you have any indication he has anything in particular he
wants to bring?
   A: I think he's anxious to do what I'm anxious to do right now,
and so I don't _ I don't _
   Q: Well, would you _ would you handle any arms control issue he
might raise by simply trying to defer it right at the spot?

<HEAD>China Passes Tough Law on Demonstrations</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's legislature Tuesday passed a law on
public demonstrations including tough provisions banning rallies
that infringe upon state interests or social order.
   The Law on Assembly and Demonstration, to take effect
immediately, was passed on the final day of the current session of
the National People's Congress Standing Committee.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the law is aimed at
protecting citizens' legal rights to gather, parade and demonstrate
while safeguarding social stability and public order.
   But the final version, revised during three sessions of the
Standing Committee since July, provides the state wide latitude to
stop public gatherings that may be critical of government policy.
   Authorities have the right to turn down requests for rallies
that may ``endanger public safety and cause social turmoil.''
Demonstrations that go against China's constitution, sovereignty or
territorial integrity, or incite national separatism, will not be
allowed.
   The ban on separatist gatherings would apply to Tibetans who in
the past two years have staged violent demonstrations against
Chinese rule.
   The law says no state employees can organize or take part in a
gathering if such action conflicts with their terms of employment.
One revision to the law added that citizens cannot organize or
participate in rallies in cities where they don't live.
   Other provisions say demonstrations must not hinder the
activities of state affairs, that rallies must not violate social
morality or use instruments that create excessive noise and affect
the normal life of residents, and that assemblies must not use
words or pictures to insult and vilify other people.
   Written applications for demonstrations must be submitted to
police prior to the event and the authorities must make a decision
two days before the date of the demonstration. The police are
empowered to ``take any necessary measure'' to disperse illegal
gatherings.
   Several Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, invoked
demonstration codes after students took to the streets in
pro-democracy marches in 1986-87. The regulations stipulated that
all demonstrations must be approved by police, but since then
almost all requests for rallies have been rejected.
   The State Council, China's cabinet, began discussing the draft
of the national aw on May 30, several days before the military
moved in to end the student-led pro-democracy movement, seven weeks
of the biggest spontaneous demonstrations in Communist China's
history.

<HEAD>Police Say 69 Detained for `Rioting' at Anti-KGB Protest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Tuesday defended their
truncheon-swinging attack on anti-KGB protesters by accusing them
of ``rioting,'' and 69 people were detained.
   Monday night's melee marked the toughest official treatment of
an unsanctioned gathering in the Soviet capital in more than 1{
years. It followed a candlelight vigil outside KGB headquarters to
commemorate Stalin's victims.
   A splinter group of about 500 people chanting slogans against
the Soviet secret police set off for Pushkin Square, where human
rights demonstrations often take place.
   They were attacked by police, and scores of protesters were
knocked to the ground, beaten and dragged into waiting police buses.
   ``It was an unsanctioned demonstration and police had to break
it up,'' said Gen. Georgy V. Postoyuk, chief of Moscow's Public
Order Department. ``They used force, as there was no other way to
make the people stop rioting.''
   He said in an interview that 69 protesters were detained. One
was given a 15-day jail sentence Tuesday by an administrative
judge, while others got seven- or five-day terms or fines, Postoyuk
said.
   Witnesses said police attacked without warning and the
demonstrators had been peaceful.
   The Tass news agency said the protesters were ``trying to create
as much disruption as possible, to display anti-Soviet posters and
shout anti-Soviet slogans.''
   Many were members of the Democratic Union, a group founded to
challenge the political monopoly of the Communist Party and create
a Western-style parliamentary democracy in the Soviet Union.
   About 1,000 people converged on KGB headquarters on Dzerzhinsky
Square after dusk to mark the unofficial ``Day of the Political
Prisoner'' and mourn the millions wrongly imprisoned or killed
under dictator Josef Stalin.
   Two rows of people holding candles lined up on three sides of
the building, home of the infamous Lubyanka prison where, under
Stalin, political prisoners were executed with a shot to the back
of the head.
   The hour-long peaceful vigil was organized by the Memorial
Society, which seeks to commemorate those who suffered unjustly
under Stalin, and the Democratic Union.
   At the end of the vigil, the splinter group of mostly young men
marched toward Pushkin Square.
   Chanting, ``Shame on the KGB!'' and ``The KGB is the enemy of
the people!'' the group was confronted without warning by riot
police two blocks from Pushkin Square as they passed out leaflets
to homebound commuters.
   The white-helmeted police, armed with long black rubber
truncheons, formed a line, then waded into the protesters, clubbing
at least four of their leaders to the ground, then dragging them
into nearby buses for detention.
   The demonstrators retreated, then formed again and headed to
Gorky Street, which leads to Pushkin Square. Riot police and other
uniformed officers sealed off the square and split the protesters
into two groups.
   On Gorky Street, riot police again charged the demonstrators,
taking about six into custody. As the protesters were dragged to
the buses, spectators shouted: ``Shame! Shame!'' Several passers-by
spat at a police car.
   Another group of demonstrators, gathered on the southeast side
of Pushkin Square, was also repeatedly charged by riot police, who
ignored the dozens of television camera teams and foreign reporters
who flocked there.
   Police formed a flying wedge to charge young people gathered
under a Gorky Street archway, and dozens were seized and dragged to
the buses.
   The brutal treatement meted out to protesters was especially
jarring because of the greater tolerance for dissenting points of
view that had seemingly become official practice in Moscow under
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In December 1987, about 200 men in civilian clothes roughed up
Jews who staged a protest demanding the right to emigrate on the
eve of Gorbachev's departure for his Washington summit with Ronald
Reagan.

<HEAD>Gov't Breaks Guerrilla Blockade on Important Highway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops broke through a
guerrilla blockade on the Salang Highway on Tuesday to allow trucks
carrying food and other necessities to reach the capital.
   About 100 privately owned trucks carrying rice and cooking oil
entered Kabul from the highway, the government said. It was the
first land convoy to reach the city in 10 days, and more trucks
were expected Wednesday.
   Soldiers said government trucks had yet to come down the highway
because of fears of a guerrilla ambush.
   The Salang is the main supply route to the capital from the
Soviet border, and fighting along the road the past 10 days has
left the city short of food, fuel, wood and other important items.
   In order to show the army was in control of the areas around
Kabul, reporters were taken south of the city to the site of a
battle last week between the Soviet-backed government and the
U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   An officer from Khad, the Afghan security agency, said 70
government soldiers disguised as guerrillas sneaked into a
guerrilla hideout in a rocky ravine and attacked.
   He said 22 guerrillas and one government soldier were killed.
   Several hundred U.S.-made Sacher rockets aimed at Kabul were
confiscated along with mortars, land mines and other weapons,
according to the Khad officer.
   Since June, rocket attacks on Kabul have killed about 400
people. The government blames the guerrillas. The guerrillas deny
rocketing civilian targets and say the government is firing on its
own people so it can accuse the guerrillas.
   Rocket attacks had intensified in recent days, but witnesses
said only two hit the city Tuesday. No casualties were reported.
   Government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said more than 200
guerrillas were killed in the fighting on the Salang.
   Most casualties occurred when the government fired two
Soviet-made Scud missiles at the highway on Friday, Amani said.
   Amani said the government tried to negotiate with guerrilla
leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, who he said organized the highway
blockade. He denied Massoud's claim that Soviet pilots were helping
Afghan troops in combat.
   The Soviet government said it pulled the last of its soldiers
from Afghanistan in February in accordance with a U.N.-mediated
accord.
   However, the Bush administration said this month it is likely
Russian soldiers are operating the Scud base in the Darluman region
outside Kabul.
   Traffic was light throughout the day in Kabul because of the
gasoline shortage. The international airport opened all day Tuesday
after rocket attacks forced it to close temporarily Monday.
   The guerrillas have been fighting 11 years to oust the
Soviet-backed government and set up an Islamic republic in
Afghanistan. Soviet troops intervened in December 1979 and began
withdrawing in May 1988.

   Corrections officials today said they have
accounted for all inmates at the riot-torn state prison here and
attributed an earlier report that five prisoners were missing to
paperwork errors.
   Authorities searched the fire-ravaged prison, double-checked
records and recounted prisoners today to find the last of the five
inmates.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of inmates who slept outdoors for three days
were returned to cells at the prison near Harrisburg, where 123
people were injured and half the buildings gutted or damaged by
fires set Wednesday and Thursday.
   Disturbances at Camp Hill and three other Pennsylvania prisons
have injured nearly 200 inmates and prison staff in the past week
and a half.
   In Illinois on Monday, an inmate with a homemade knife held four
medical workers hostage for five hours, demanding to be moved to
another state. He surrendered without harming anyone after talking
to a TV news crew.
   Authorities said Monday that five inmates were unaccounted for
at Camp Hill. Corrections Department spokesman Kenneth Robinson
said the discrepancies were resolved after all prisoners were
returned to their cells, making possible a more accurate count.
   Officials had said they didn't believe the prison's double ring
of fences had been breached during the riots.
   Crews have been working since Friday, when the riot was quelled,
to repair damaged cellblocks and reinforce some with chains.
   Over the weekend, hundreds of inmates slept in prison yards
because of the shortage of cells. The prison held about 2,600
inmates when the riots began. By Saturday, 744 had been transferred
to other state prisons.
   Officials said the federal prison system would accept at least
700 state prisoners temporarily.
   On Oct. 23, 29 prison staffers and 19 inmates were injured
during a three-hour uprising at the state prison at Huntingdon,
about 100 miles west of Camp Hill. On Saturday night, inmates at
the Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia seized a cellblock for about
four hours. Twenty prisoners and three guards were injured.
   On Sunday night, about 100 inmates at the Northeast Detention
Center in Philadelphia were moved to a gym while firefighters
cleared smoke from a fire set in a trash can.
   In Joliet, Ill., prisoner Mark LaRue, 35, took a male doctor and
three woman dental clinic workers hostage at the Stateville
Correctional Center. LaRue, who recently was transferred from a
prison in Washington state in an exchange of troublemakers,
demanded to be moved out of Illinois, said Corrections Department
spokesman Nic Howell.
   Officials refused his demand for a plane to fly him back to
Washington but agreed to transfer him to another prison, Howell
said.
   He was transferred to Illinois in May 1988 and to Stateville in
March.
   LaRue has been in nine federal and state prisons as a result of
being transferred for discipline reasons, said state Corrections
Director Michael Lane.
   He was serving a 10-year sentence for assault in Washington, and
while in prison was sentenced to an additional 23 years on two
assault charges and a weapons-possession charge.

   China and the Soviet Union on Tuesday concluded
the fourth round of talks on their disputed border, saying some
progress had been made.
   The statement at the end of the 11-day session gave no
specifics, unlike after the third round in Moscow a year ago when
the two sides said they had settled most differences over the
eastern part of the border.
   It said the talks were held in an earnest atmosphere and the
delegations discussed questions regarding the boundary alignment of
sectors on which no agreement had been reached and made some
progress.
   They agreed to the results of joint aerial photographic work on
the boundary in 1988 and 1989.
   The talks began in 1987 to resolve territorial disputes along
areas of the frontier where the nations' military forces clashed in
1969.
   The Chinese side was led by Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei
and the Soviets by Vice Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev.
   The participants also noted the significance of May's
Sino-Soviet summit in which Mikhail S. Gorbachev traveled to
Beijing to normalize relations after three decades of acrimonious
ties.

   The government Tuesday opened a new detention
center for 400 Vietnamese boat people despite the objections from
residents.
   Construction of the High Island Detention Center had drawn
contempt from residents in the Sai Kung area, who staged
demonstrations at the site for nine days in August until police
hauled them away.
   The residents feared the Vietnamese might escape, and they
thought the center would pollute a nearby reservoir.
   The center, circled with a 15-foot fence with barbed wire, will
hold 7,000 people when it is finished in two months.
   The surge of boat people continued, with 736 Vietnamese arriving
in Hong Kong in October, compared with 82 a year ago.
   There are 43,840 boat people in Hong Kong waiting to be
screened. They will be repatriated to Vietnam unless they can prove
they fled persecution.

<TEXT>
   Peace Corps Director Paul D. Coverdell said
Tuesday the agency has embarked on talks that could lead to sending
75 to 100 American volunteers to Poland next year.
   Coverdell, who has just returned from a visit to Poland and
Hungary, said a three-member Peace Corps team will go to Warsaw in
late November to continue talks with Polish officials about
establishing a program there.
   ``We would characterize our discussions at this point as
preliminary, but I found great enthusiasm for the idea when I was
in Warsaw last week,'' he said. ``I personally would like to see 75
to 100 volunteers there in 1990.''
   In July, during a visit to Eastern Europe, President Bush
announced in Budapest that Peace Corps volunteers would be going to
Hungary _ marking the corps' first effort in an Eastern European
country. That program is to involve about 60 volunteers to train
Hungarians in the teaching of English.
   Coverdell went to Poland after signing a memorandum of
understanding in Budapest that paves the way for starting the Peace
Corps program in Hungary.
   He told a news conference that English teaching also was among
prime interests expressed by Polish officials during his talks in
Warsaw.
   ``Today most professions, particularly those dealing with
science and technology, require a strong grasp of the language,''
he said. ``English also is the primary language of commerce, so we
intend to expand our programming in this area throughout the
world.''
   While he was in Poland, Coverdell also talked with several
government ministers about establishing Peace Corps programs there
dealing with the environment, health and small business development.
   ``We want the Peace Corps to respond to any country that is
requesting legitimate assistance,'' he said. ``I particularly want
the Peace Corps to be on the cutting edge in nations where in the
past there has been a lack of communications mixed with tension and
suspicion. I believe we can make a difference in situations where
these currents of change are flowing.''
   Coverdell's trip also included talks dealing with Peace Corps
programs in the Philippines and Thailand.
   In Manila, he met with President Corazon Aquino and discussed
the possibility of sending Peace Corps volunteers back to the
southern island of Mindanao. Volunteers were withdrawn from
Mindanao four years ago because of threats to their security from
communist insurgents.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: of that?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A: Well, we've indicated that that's the law and we will live by
the law. And we're going forward with that mandate because of the
way the Congress has moved on this. I don't think I need to repeat
my view on capital gains. It's something that is good for growth,
something that is good for investment, something that is good for
jobs. And we hear some shrill comments to the contrary, but in my
view, that matter was debated fully. My position was made clear and
I plan to continue to fight for my position.
   (Mixed questions from the press).
   A: Who hasn't had a question? I'm getting out of here. Right
here, and then Ellen, and then I'm leaving. No, right here.
   Q: On minimum wage, is your proposal, your original proposal,
still your first and final offer, or would you be willing even to
link it with something like capital gains which you want so badly?
   A: We're not in the _ in the posture of trying to tell the
Congress how they ought to resolve these difficulties. We sent up
clear proposals on the anti-crime package, on the minimum wage, on
the capital gains. And it has gotten so confusing up there that
they ought to move now. But I'm not going to suggest _ why do we
need to do that? We've told them what we want, and I wish they'd
get some action going on the proposals that I have put forward. I
think the American people are entitled to that. I think the
American people see that it is this Congress that is frustrating
getting the deficit down. And so they ought to move and move
promptly. But I can't sit there and fine tune for them, ``Well, if
you'll only make this one _ throw this one issue in with that one,
why you can do your business.'' I mean, we've tried _
   Q: So you're saying package deals are out?
   A: Well, I'm not saying they're in or out. I'm saying, let's get
going. We know what the administration position is; I've said it.
Send it down the way I said it, and we got harmony and light. Send
it down differently, and I'll take a look at it. Send it down with
some things in it that I can't take and I'll send it right back to
you. And I don't know how more frank I can be with the Congress.
Ellen? And then I'm leaving.
   Q: Mr. President, as recently as this summer, some of your
senior advisers, dare I say some in this room, were expressing
doubts that Gorbachev would survive all of his internal political
difficulties. Did you ever share those views? And has anything
happened _ what has happened to turn you around?
   A: Look, we are looking at everything we can regarding the rapid
changes that are taking place not only in Eastern Europe but in the
Soviet Union. And we've got very thoughtful people outside the
government that give me their opinions. And I don't think anybody
has a corner on all the wisdom, but I can't speculate on that
question. What I can say is, we're not basing the foreign policy of
the United States on any individual. We've got to look at broad
changes, we've got to look at commitment from all elements of
leadership in the Soviet Union, where they come down _ fascinating
meeting the other day with Mr. Primakov here _ and assess all of
this and spell out as clearly as you can what's in the interest of
the United States and the Alliance. And this meeting will help in
that regard. But it's not predicated _ our whole arms control
agenda _ just as _ on Mr. Gorbachev. Similarly, I don't think they,
you know, do that on a U.S. president at the time.
   Q: But, sir, you wouldn't be meeting with him, of course, if you
thought he was a goner. (Laughter.) Did you at any time have any
doubts (inaudible)
   A: A goner, no, I don't _ (laughing) _ I don't _ (laughing) _
that word never entered my mind. So you know, you hear a lot of
cross currents about how successful perestroika is going to be. But
one thing you get from all the Soviet leaders is, ``Look. The clock
isn't going to be set back and we are going to go forward with
perestroika,'' whether it was Mr. Yeltsin when he was here or Mr.
Gorbachev's statements and visits with Shevardnadze, visits with
Mr. Primakov and then others meet with other layers of the Soviet
bureaucracy and you get the distinct feeling that the clock is not
going to be set back to square one, and then you go forward.
``Well, here's how this will interact with US policy.'' But I'm
looking forward to this meeting. I think it's the right thing to be
doing. As I say, there was a time when I wasn't sure that it was,
but with this rapidity of change, I don't want to miss something.
And the way we've got it set so there will be no firm agenda, where
we can do it in a setting without a lot of public pressure from
other governments, I think it's going to be a productive meeting.
And I was very pleased with the reception that it got from the
congressional leaders. As I say, I expect we will get a strong,
positive response _ I know I will from the allied leaders and I
really can't think f any country that is going to see objection to
this, because they _ the fate of a lot countries are wrapped up in
how the United States and the Soviet Union get along and how the
changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are managed. And
when I come back from this meeting, I and my top advisers _ and
we're going to keep our traveling squad down, I say _ we'll be able
to _ we'll be able to have a much clearer perception of motivations
behind Mr. Gorbachev's pronouncements. So, I think it's worthwhile.
Thank you all very much.
   Q: There was a very important development _ (inaudible) _ Can
you address it?
   A: No. I can't. I've got a _ I'm sorry _
   Q: They passed a law _ sir, they passed a law to make it _
   A: Don't know anything about it.
   Q: Thank you.
   Q: What's Ortega stepping on? (Laughter.)
   Q: Where will they be meeting? Where is he going to stay?
   Staff: We don't know yet. We don't know yet.

<HEAD>Leading Indicators and New Home Sales Point to Sluggish Growth Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New home sales took their steepest dive in
nearly eight years last month while the government's chief economic
forecasting gauge registered only a small increase, the government
reported Tuesday.
   Analysts said they anticipate sluggish growth ahead, but few
said they see danger signals of a recession in the near future.
Despite the sharp decline in home sales, economists forecast
improvement in that industry as mortgage rates decline.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators, designed
to foretell economic activity six to nine months in advance, inched
up 0.2 percent in September.
   At the same time, the department reported new home sales dropped
14 percent, the sharpest decrease since a 19 percent decline in
January 1982 during the last recession.
   In a third report, the Labor Department said employers' costs
for wages and benefits of workers climbed 1.6 percent in the third
quarter and 5.1 percent in the past year, with health insurance
premiums again driving up benefit costs at a faster pace than
salaries.
   Many housing economists questioned the September home sales
report and suggested a more accurate reading of the industry would
be obtained by averaging sales of both new and existing homes over
the entire third quarter.
   ``That shows overall strength in the housing market,'' said John
A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of
Realtors.
   Analysts see falling mortgage rates leading to continued but
slow growth in the housing industry for the remainder of the year,
similar to that projected by the leading indicators for the overall
economy.
   The economy has been slowing since the Federal Reserve applied
the brakes last year to dampen inflation. But while inflation
appears to be abating, some analysts are concerned the Fed's grip
could thrust the economy into recession.
   The small increase in the leading index followed a revised
August advance of 0.5 percent. The often-volatile index was also
revised in July to show no change after dipping 0.1 percent in June.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Co., called the
September figure ``the fourth anemic report in the last five
months'' and said it ``signals a major slowdown, a flirtation with
recession.''
   Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said, ``This number gives us a pretty good assessment
of where we stand _ no recession but at least two quarters of
sluggish growth,'' said
   An index measuring consumer expectations was the largest
positive contributor among last month's leading indicators and the
major cause for the August and July revisions.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, has accounted for much of the year's growth so
far.
   ``As long as confidence holds up, we probably won't have a
recession,'' Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the
WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said. He and other economists
believe consumer spending will be substantially weaker in the last
quarter of the year, however.
   Other positive contributors were growth in the money supply, due
in part to lower inflation, a longer average work week, and higher
stock prices.
   But the other seven statistics, mainly in the manufacturing
sector, pointed down _ a decrease in manufacturers' new orders for
consumer goods, a decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders, fewer
orders for plant and equipment, faster vendor performance, meaning
declining demand, higher initial unemployment claims, fewer
building permits, and lower prices for sensitive materials
indicating weakening demand.
   The strong service and consumption sectors and the weakness in
manufacturing led chief economist David Berson of the Federal
National Mortgage Association to describe the economy as having a
``split personality.''
   The various changes left the index at 145 percent of its 1982
base of 100. So far this year, the index has fallen at an annual
rate of 0.1 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent for
the first nine months of 1988.

<HEAD>Optometrist's License Put on Probation for Having Patients Strip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state licensing board, under fire for
clearing an optometrist who had women patients strip to the waist
for eye exams, today ordered him to stop the practice and put him
on three years' probation.
   The Iowa Board of Optometry Examiners had previously voted
against disciplining Monticello optometrist Gary Fisher but
reconsidered under public pressure.
   The board, after a 2{-hour private meeting, voted without debate
or dissent for probation and ordered Fisher to halt the screening
tests that had the women disrobe. Fisher already had said he was no
longer performing the examinations.
   Fisher was hauled before the licensing board on ethics charges
after some women patients complained he had them partially disrobe.
Fisher said he did so to check for curvature of the spine
associated with some eye disorders.
   In its ruling last month, the board said Fisher was ``honestly
attempting to provide the best care.''
   The decision prompted an uproar, angering some women, pitting
health professionals against each other and raising questions about
closed meetings of medical regulators.
   ``It was kind of like a foot doctor looking at the brain,'' said
Sen. Jack Nystrom.
   The board reconsidered after Attorney General Tom Miller and the
board that governs the medical profession asked for the case to be
reopened. The medical board had threatened to sue, saying Fisher
strayed into the practice of medicine, for which he isn't licensed.
   Fisher complained about being hounded by reporters, before all
sides stopped commenting on the advice of lawyers, who expect the
issue will eventually land in court.
   ``The board, after 20 hours of hearing, two full days,
exonerated me completely,'' said Fisher. ``Now I'm being retried in
the press.''
   The optometry panel is made up of five optometrists and two
members of the public, all appointed by Gov. Terry Branstad. After
initially giving the board a vote of confidence, Branstad urged
another hearing.
   ``Here's a situation where the optometry board is now on trial,
and I think it's appropriate for them to see all of the evidence
before they make a decision,'' he said.

<HEAD>Budget Cuts Lead to Closing of Women's Clinics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles County's 13 family planning
clinics are closing this week because of budget cuts ordered by
Gov. George Deukmejian.
   Program directors and health workers predicted the closings
Wednesday could result in more than 5,000 additional unwanted
pregnancies each year and hurt efforts to stem the spread of
sexually transmitted diseases.
   The clinics offer gynecological exams, pregnancy counseling,
birth control and testing for venereal disease. They do not offer
abortions.
   Officials said women seeking such services, most of them poor
and Hispanic, will be referred to the county's 29 general health
clinics, which also provide family planning, but patients sometimes
must wait up to eight weeks for an appointment.
   The county's 42 clinics have provided family planning services
to 60,000 women a year.
   In July, Deukmejian cut two-thirds of the state's $36.2 million
family planning budget _ the maximum cut permitted by law. He has
suggested that California's rising teen-age pregnancy rate proves
the program has failed.
   ``It's a horrific situation,'' said Catherine J. Wylie, a
administrator of family planning programs. ``The women at the
highest risk will be the ones most affected and, by the time
they're screened, they'll already be pregnant.''
   Counties that use less state money to operate their family
planning programs, including San Diego, will not be as drastically
affected by the cuts as Los Angeles.
   Still, San Diego County health officials said they planned to
eliminate breast and cervical cancer screening for poor patients,
among other services.
   Abortion opponents on Monday backed the cuts.
   ``These clinics have long been used as a cover and funnel of
money for the abortion industry,'' said Brian Johnston, western
director of the National Right to Life Committee.

<TEXT>
   The army took down the
barricades around this Palestinian town Tuesday, ending 42 days of
seizing cars, furniture and other goods to crush a tax boycott.
Jubilant residents took to the streets to shout victory.
   But as hundreds of he townspeople waved ``V'' signs and sang,
military authorities said they had succeeded in breaking the
revolt, seizing the equivalent of more than $1.5 million to make up
for unpaid taxes.
   ``We are always collecting taxes. We have always collected
taxes. We are the authorities,'' said Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head
of the West Bank military government.
   Hanan Banura, a 25-year-old mother of two whose husband is in
jail for refusing to pay taxes, said the town's defiance
strengthened the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising against
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We won something here,'' she said. ``We did what we wanted to
do, not what they wanted.''
   The bulldozers that pushed away the earthen mound blocking off
the Christian Arab town of 10,000 people ended Beit Sahour's
unlikely role as a symbol of the revolt against occupation.
   It is a town of large, prosperous-looking homes of sun-bleached
stone located down steep, winding roads from Bethlehem. Until
recently its middle-class residents were derided as ``rich
revolutionaries'' by poor Palestinians in refugee camps who fought
Israelis with stones and firebombs.
   Of the more than 600 Palestinians killed in clashes with
soldiers or civilians in the uprising, only one died in Beit Sahour.
   But Beit Sahour, known mostly for the fields where shepherds
first learned of Christ's birth, kept up the boycott of Israeli
taxes ordered by the PLO-backed leaders of the uprising long after
most other Palestinians gave in to Israeli pressure.
   Much to Israel's consternation, the tax revolt has gotten as
much publicity as the uprising's persistent violence. Journalists
who sneaked into Beit Sahour described refrigerators, rugs, cars,
televisions and all manner of goods being hauled away.
   On one side, townspeople complained against ``taxation without
representation.'' On the other, Israel claimed it was seizing goods
only to collect taxes to support schools, roads and other services.
   Meron Benvenisti, a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem who has
researched the West Bank for 10 years, alleged in 1986 that Israel
collected more taxes than it spent on the territory since it and
the Gaza Strip were captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The army magazine Bamahane said in its most recent edition that
people in Beit Sahour owed about $500,000 in taxes, but the extra
goods were seized to cover ``transport and storage.''
   On Tuesday, townspeople ranging from youths honking car horns to
businessmen claimed their revolt delivered a rebuke to Israel.
   Chakib Awad, owner of a factory that makes bakery machinery and
metal statues of Christ for sale to tourists, said Beit Sahour
showed it had a role in the revolt.
   ``At my age, I don't throw firebombs,'' he said. ``I am not a
terrorist.''
   Awad showed a list of 18 machines he said had been seized from
his factory, which he valued at $69,250.
   He said that before the uprising, he had paid taxes to Israeli
authorities or the Jordanian government when it controlled the West
Bank. But he added he no longer wanted to pay occupiers.
   ``I am not a Jordanian any more. I am not an Israeli,'' he said.
``I am a Palestinian. I have to pay taxes to a Palestinian state.''
   Israeli officials said that debts from 398 major tax debtors
were ``handled'' in the six-week campaign and that confiscated
goods included 33 cars as well as bank accounts and cash.
   A statement by military officials said soldiers also arrested 40
tax debtors. Thirty-five have been indicted.
   ``We have realized what we wanted to accomplish and more,'' said
Erez.
   Not all Israelis agreed. Seven left-wing Israeli legislators who
visited the town Monday _ on condition they not take journalists
along _ said Tuesday the tax campaign was a failure.
   Lova Eliav, a Labor Party legislator, described the campaign
against Beit Sahour as ``a futile, foolish exercise. ... The army
has turned elite soldiers into tax collectors.''
   Legislator Dedi Zucker of the Citizens' Rights Movement said
what happened in Beit Sahour was ``a fight over who is a sovereign
... and it has not been proven Israel is a real sovereign in Beit
Sahour.''

   Wages and salaries boosted by teacher pay
raises jumped 1.6 percent from July through September, double the
increase of the previous three months, the Labor Department
reported Tuesday.
   While some economists discounted the increase because of the
special factors relating to the start of the school year, other
analysts called the wage gain a worrisome indication of underlying
inflationary pressures.
   The 1.6 percent increase in wages and salaries in the
department's Employment Cost Index followed a gain of 0.8 percent
in the April-June period.
   The biggest wage gains in the past three months came in the
government sector, where the pricetag for salaries is traditionally
higher because of new contracts for teachers at the start of the
school year.
   Teacher contracts also were a major factor in pushing wage rates
up by 1.3 percent in the July-September period last year.
   The gain in wages and salaries excludes the cost of other
benefits paid by employers, such as health care. When those costs
are added, total employment compensation rose 1.6 percent in the
past three months, up from a 1.1 percent advance in the April-June
quarter. That advance was also higher than a 1.3 percent rise in
the July-September quarter a year ago.
   ``Both the wage and salaries increase and the total compensation
increase are uncomfortably high,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co.
   Some analysts blamed the higher wage gains on the sharp
increases in consumer prices that occurred at the first of the
year. They said that new wage contracts were an effort by workers
to keep their purchasing power from being eroded by inflation.
   Consumer prices have moderated in recent months as food and
energy costs have returned to more modest levels, but analysts said
the real danger will be if the earlier spurt of higher inflation
gets embedded in wage demands, setting off an inflationary
wage-price spiral.
   ``The effects of higher inflation earlier in the year are
showing up in new contracts,'' said Michael Evans, head of a
Washington forecasting company. ``The question is: Can it be turned
around?''
   Sinai said the Federal Reserve is paying particularly close
attention to wage pressures in the economy and won't consider its
war against inflation won until these increases begin to moderate.
   For that reason, he said he wasn't looking for any significant
move on the part of the central bank toward lowering interest rates.
   For the 12 months ending in September, wages and salaries rose
by 4.6 percent, up from a 3.9 percent increase in the previous
12-month period. Total compensation costs rose 5.1 percent for the
past 12 months, compared with an increase of 4.7 percent for the 12
months ending in September 1988.
   The costs of benefits alone grew by 6 percnt in the past 12
months, compared with a 6.7 percent increase posted for the same
period ending in September 1988.
   However, the smaller rise in benefit costs was attributable
almost entirely to the fact that the Social Security tax did not
rise this year, after climbing by 5 percent in 1988.
   Wages and salaries for private sector workers were up 4.4
percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 5.5 percent increase
in wages for state and local government workers.
   Salaries for school teachers, college and university professors
and health and hospital workers in the public sector all rose by
more than 6 percent in the last 12 months, the Labor Department
said.

<HEAD>East German TV's Noted West-Basher Loses Job After 30 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler, who belabored
imperialists, revisionists and assorted capitalist villains on East
German television for nearly 30 years, has lost his job to creeping
reform.
   East Germany's most prominent TV commentator said farewell
Monday on the final edition of his 20-minute weekly show ``The
Black Channel.'' He was unrepentant, as befits a man born into a
titled Prussian family 71 years ago.
   No matter that countrymen came to revile him as a symbol of the
Cold War philosopy used to justify decades of harsh rule.
   No matter the joke that said ``Schni ...'' represented the
shortest time span in East Germany, just enough to turn off the
television as it was uttered.
   ``I have nothing to be ashamed of,'' Schnitzler told his
audience Monday night, grim-faced as ever.
   ``Revisionism is still with us and the class struggle
continues,'' said the man who once declared proudly that ``no one
has ever proved a falsification'' in his broadcasts.
   Revisionism, to Schnitzler, is something practiced by West
Germany, his regular target. He helped found a West German radio
station soon after the country was divided at the end of World War
II, but later returned to East Berlin.
   Since Egon Krenz became Communist Party chief two weeks ago,
succeeding 77-year-old Erich Honecker, the state-controlled media
have undergone a dramatic transition.
   Once-drab newspapers are filled with debate and complaints about
the nation's problems. The two TV channels have begun carrying
everything from illegal street protests to investigative reports on
government bungling and excess.
   Schnitzler, however, remained steadfast, true to the old line.
Only last week, he said East Germany faced the biggest offensive
``from the enemies of socialism'' in its history.
   Many influential people inside the Communist Party, as well as
the general populace, had come to view ``The Black Channel'' as a
shrill anachronism.
   Pro-reform demonstrators shouted ``Schnitzler to the Muppet
Show!''
   After 1,519 episodes of invective since 1960 _ during which he
often showed West German TV reports followed by biting commentary _
Schnitzler got five minutes for his farewell.
   He told viewers he would continue his television work ``in
another fashion'' and pledged to be, as always, ``a weapon in the
defense and development of my socialist fatherland.''
   There had been increasing signs the end was near for Schnitzler,
a clear liability to a government professing willingness to
consider reform.
   His program ``no longer fits with the times,'' the official news
agency ADN reported a week ago.
   A Lutheran Church publication said his unrelenting orthodoxy
contributed to the flight of tens of thousands of East Germans to
freedom in the West and to the frustrations behind mass
pro-democracy protests.

   A total of 9,194 Jews emigrated from the Soviet
Union in October, and 1,464 of them arrived in Israel, the national

   Uri Gordon, head of the Immigration Department at the Jewish
Agency, a quasi-governmental body that helps handle new arrivals,
said 51,080 Jews have left the Soviet Union this year.
   Of them, 7,275 arrived in Israel, with the rest choosing to seek
resettlement elsewhere, Gordon said.
   Gordon said 284,550 Soviet Jews have requested sponsors abroad
so far this year. Israeli officials predict half will come to
Israel.

   It's not a summit, insisted President Bush.
   It is an ``interim, informal meeting'' that he'll be having in
the Mediterranean with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``This one isn't a summit,'' he told reporters Tuesday,

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto faces
her biggest government crisis this week in a no-confidence motion
that grew out of brutal ethnic violence and has won support from
some of Ms. Bhutto's one-time allies.
   The motion goes to the floor of the National Assembly on
Wednesday and must be voted on by Thursday.
   Ethnic violence in this nation of 109 million people has chipped
away at Ms. Bhutto's power base, turning the slums of Pakistan's
largest city into virtual war zones and creating a big business in
illegal arms.
   Ms. Bhutto is confident her left-of-center Pakistan People's
Party will survive the vote, but some observers fear that whatever
the outcome, it could ignite new violence.
   Ms. Bhutto's party has 116 seats in the National Assembly and
needs 119 votes to survive the confidence motion, and she said it
can easily muster three votes from independents and minority
parties.
   ``Nor a single PPP member will join hands with the opposition,''
Ms. Bhutto said last week.
   Opposition spokesmen say at least 129 assembly members will vote
against the government. So far, 105 have pledged to do so.
   The opposition Islamic Democratic Alliance blames the ethnic
violence on Ms. Bhutto's populist party, saying it refused to take
a tough stand, to decentralize power or to spend money to improve
the welfare of the masses.
   Ms. Bhutto's major opponents are Sindh nationalists from Ms.
Bhutto's native Sindh province, who want a loose federation or
outright independence, and ``mohajirs,'' Indian immigrants to
Pakistan since the partition of the two countries in 1947.
   Fourteen assembly members who announced they will vote with the
opposition belong to the Mohajir Nationalist Movement, which until
recently supported Ms. Bhutto's 10-month-old government.
   The lawmakers announced their defection Oct. 24, claiming the
People's Party failed to deliver on promises to provide more jobs
and to free mohajir political prisoners.
   More than 700 people have died in mohajir-Sindhi riots in
Karachi, the nation's largest city, and in Hyderabad and other
Sindh cities since 1986.
   The province was the only one Ms. Bhutto's party won handily in
November 1988 elections.
   ``We are scared that if the motion is carried, Sindhis will hold
the (mohajirs) responsible for overthrowing a Sindhi prime
minister. And if it's defeated, then there will be jubilation by
PPP workers which could lead to violence,'' said Rifat Ali Khan, an
industrialist in Karachi, where many of the 9 million people live
in filthy slums.
   As a group, urban Mohajirs economically are better off than the
natives. They say this makes them the target of poorer, less
educated Sindhis, the majority of whom are fiefs of rural, feudal
landlords.
   Only a quarter of Sindh's population is mohajirs, but mohajirs
account for 80 percent of Karachi's population. ``We are on the
verge of being converted into a minority on our own soil,'' said
Hafiz Pirzada, a spokesman for the Sindh National Alliance, a
grouping of Sindhi organizations.
   The problem has created a huge illegal arms market in Sindh.
Weaponry is smuggled in from northern Pakistan, where skilled gun
craftsmen churn out arms ranging from assault rifles to grenade
launchers.
   According to unofficial estimates, there are more than 300,000
illegal weapons in Sindh.

<HEAD>Poindexter Lawyer Objects to Two Iran-Contra Prosecutors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two newly hired Iran-Contra prosecutors should
be disqualifed from handling the criminal case against John
Poindexter because they could have seen his televised congressional
testimony, Poindexter's lawyers argued Tuesday.
   Richard Beckler told a federal court hearing that independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh violated his office's own procedures by
hiring Dan Webb in September to head the prosecution team against
Poindexter, who was President Reagan's national security adviser.
   Another member of the Poindexter prosecution team, Howard Pearl,
a longtime colleague of Webb, was hired a few weeks ago.
   At the hearing, Webb disclosed he plans to call 46 witnesses in
the government's case, including former National Security Council
aide Oliver North, who in May was convicted of three felonies in
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Webb also said many of the same witnesses from the North case
will be called when Poindexter is put on trial. Webb did not
elaborate. The witnesses at North's trial included former National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., and
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   North worked in 1985 and 1986 for Poindexter, who is charged
with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts
of making false statements. The alleged crimes occurred in
connection with North's secret resupply operation to the Nicaraguan
Contras and in regard to a shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran in
1985 assisted by the CIA.
   Walsh set up elaborate regulations in 1987 to insulate his trial
lawyers from being exposed to the immunized congressional testimony
of Iran-Contra figures, including Poindexter.
   Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, has been in private law
practice and so has undoubtedly been tainted by Poindexter's
nationally televised testimony, Beckler suggested.
   ``This almost borders on bad faith,'' Beckler told U.S. District
Court Judge Harold Greene, who has set Jan. 22 to start
Poindexter's trial.
   ``Here you have a prosecutor who has built a Chinese wall to
block off the ... taint and then he has gone out and hired people
to go around the Chinese wall or go through it or under it,''
Beckler complained. ``It makes a complete mockery of the process.''
   Webb has filed an affidavit saying he didn't watch or read
Poindexter's immunized congressional testimony.
   Webb offered to undergo questioning by Beckler in Greene's
courtroom on the question of exposure to immunized testimony and
Greene indicated he would take Webb up on the offer.
   A Supreme Court ruling says that no portion of a criminal case
may be derived from a witness's immunized testimony.

   Cutting bloated factory payrolls to comply with
economic reform has put thousands of people out of work and the
jobless rate is 27 percent in some areas, the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda said Tuesday.
   It said the time had come for unemployment insurance and
retraining programs like those in the West.
   The Kremlin has claimed for generations the Soviet Union is a
worker's paradise and unemployment exists only in capitalist
countries, which deliberately keep many people out of work so
factory owners can dictate low wages.
   Only last summer did Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov admit to serious
unemployment in the Soviet Union, citing it as a cause of ethnic
violence.
   Pravda did not estimate total unemployment, but said a newly
formed ``Association of the Unemployed'' claimed 23 million people,
17 percent of all Soviet workers, did not have jobs.
   Chiding a factory manager for the comment, ``I wish I had a
couple of jobless outside my gates,'' Pravda said: ``He meant,
obviously, that at his enterprise, productivity would jump, quality
of production would increase and discipline would strengthen.''
   The paper called that a dubious conclusion because those who
were working would have to support those who were not.
   It quoted one reader as saying he did not want unemployment in
the Soviet Union, and another who said: ``Our indignation is in the
fact that thousands of drunks, thieves and simple beggars who don't
want to work will receive unemployment benefits.''
   Pravda said unemployment was at 27.6 percent in Azerbaijan, 25.7
percent in Tadzhikistan, 22.8 in Uzbekistan, 18.8 in Turkmenia, 18
in Armenia and 16.3 in Kirgizia. All are non-Russian republics
along the southern Soviet border and all but Kirgizia have reported
riots in the past six months.
   Although those figures represent about 4.3 million people,
Pravda said: ``The real reserve of able-bodied workers who could be
involved in industry in these regions amounts to about 3 million.''
   That would put the overall jobless rate for those republics at
roughly 15 percent.
   Plenty of jobs are available, Pravda contended, but they either
carry no prestige or are too far from population centers.
   Chronic labor shortages exist in areas of the Far North and
Siberia that are rich in resources but have harsh climates. Workers
are paid bonuses to live there.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reform program,
Soviet factories are being asked to earn profits this year and
``are starting to count every kopeck,'' Pravda said.
   The party paper said 3 million people had lost their jobs to
restructuring and predicted that number would quintuple by the year
2005.
   It acknowledged the communist tradition of job security ``has a
lowering effect on productivity'' and added that ``to simply find a
place for everyone is both expensive and immoral.''

<HEAD>President Says Rebels Must Withdraw Before Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president said Tuesday that
rebels must withdraw from newly occupied regions of northern
Ethiopia before negotiations with the government can be held.
   The statement appeared to cast doubt on reports that talks would
begin Saturday in Rome between the government and the rebel Tigre
People's Liberation Army.
   The rebel army has scored a string of victories since August,
pushing government forces out of the rebels' home province of Tigre
and making significant gains in neighboring Wollo and Gondar
provinces.
   President Haile Mariam Mengistu did not mention the Rome talks
in his address to an emergency session of the Shengo, the national
parliament. He said the rebels ``must withdraw quickly from Wollo
and Gondar'' before any negotiations begin.
   The Shengo called the emergency meeting to hear a report on the
growing rebel threat.
   The Tigrean rebels have been fighting the Marxist government 15
years. Another northern rebel group in Eritrea province has been
fighting a war of secession for 27 years.
   The Central Committee of the ruling Marxist party convened an
emergency meeting Monday to discuss the rebel problem. It was the
first in the committee's five-year existence.
   Mengistu told legislators one of the ``foremost tasks'' is to
strengthen the armed forces through recruitment and training.
   Ethiopia has the largest standing army in sub-Saharan Africa
with an estimated 315,000 regular troops and a people's militia
that includes everyone 18-50 years old.
   The president also said that to meet ``the dangerous challenge
in northern Ethiopia'' all development projects approved for the
1989-90 fiscal year will have to be suspended and the national
budget put on a war footing.
   The Tigre rebels said late last week they had agreed to open
preliminary peace talks with the government in Rome on Saturday,
with Italian officials acting as observers. The government has not
commented on that report.
   The talks would come two weeks before another round of talks set
to begin Nov. 18 between the government and the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front.
   The Tigre rebels claimed Tuesday the government staged a
30-minute air raid on the Tigrean provincial capital of Mekele,
damaging 20 houses but causing no casualties.
   On Monday, the rebels said 31 people were killed or injured and
30 homes destroyed in a government air raid on the same city.

   A charge accusing rock star Ozzy Osbourne of
assaulting his wife has been dropped because the couple want to
reconcile, a prosecutor said Tuesday.
   Osbourne, 41, was accused of closing his hands around the throat
of his wife, Sharon, in September, and his case was scheduled to be
heard by a court on Wednesday.
   He was originally charged with threatening to kill her at their
home in Little Chalfont, northwest of London, but after she dropped
her complaint, the Crown Prosecution Service reduced the charge to
assault.
   John Wilcox, acting chief crown prosecutor for the Thames Valley
area, said all charges have been dropped against the former Black
Sabbath singer because Mrs. Osbourne ``expressed a wish to be
reconciled with her husband.''

unique perspective on the problems of the disabled from his years
of getting around countless hotels, airports and other public
places with crutches.
   ``You get off the plane in one of the terminals in New York, and
you see a big sign: `Welcome to New York,''' Perlman told a group

   Perlman, who needs crutches because of a childhood bout with

everyone.
   ``I've never seen anybody _ handicapped or able-bodied _ avoid a
curb cut or take the stairs when an elevator was available,'' he
said.
   Referring to a Monday evening concert at the Duluth

the building had better be accessible. One step, and I'm out of
there!'' The concert went on as scheduled; the stage can be reached

   Former South African lawmaker Helen Suzman was
made an honorary dame Tuesday by Queen Elizabeth II in recognition
of her lengthy campaign against apartheid.
   Mrs. Suzman said after a ceremony at Buckingham Palace that the
queen told her she was delighted to make the award. Mrs. Suzman,
71, who retired as a lawmaker this year, said she, too, was
``delighted and honored by the award. It was very unexpected.''
   The title is the female equivalent of a knighthood. Since it is
honorary, she cannot call herself Dame Helen, but the honor still
carries prestige.
   ``I think the award is a recognition of the fundamental human
values of a democratic society,'' she said.
   Mrs. Suzman was first elected as a member of Parliament in 1952
and for many years was the lone representative of the white Liberal
Progressive Federal Party, now part of a new opposition party.
   She isn't the first foreigner to be honored by the queen this
year: In June, former President Reagan was made an honorary Knight
Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Order of Bath.

   New York Yankee Don Mattingly has been
sued by the company that makes the famous Louisville Slugger
baseball bat, accused of violating his contract by endorsing
another company's bats for children.
   The lawsuit, filed Monday in county circuit court by the
Louisville-based Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., charged that the
perennial All-Star first baseman violated a contract he had signed
in 1980 as a 19-year-old minor-league player.
   The suit says Franklin Sports Industries of Massachusetts
produced a set for tee-ball, a variant of baseball aimed at very
young children, in 1987 and a Little League bat in February that
both carried Mattingly's autograph.
   Under the 1980 contract, Mattingly gave exclusive rights to the
use of his name, autograph, nickname, initials and picture to
Hillerich &amp; Bradsby for the promotion of the Louisville Slugger bat
or any other bat the company makes, the suit says.
   In an Oct. 6 letter signed by his attorney, Mattingly said the
agreement was ``unconscionable and unenforceable.''
   In the letter, Mattingly also alleged that Hillerich &amp; Bradsby
failed to pay him royalties, and the slugger threatened to file his
own suit if Hillerich &amp; Bradsby did not stop trying to interfere
with his contract with Franklin.
   The company signs contracts with many minor league players,
supplying them with custom-made bats with the intention of using
the endorsements of the few _ such as Mattingly _ who make it big,
said James Milliman, Hillerich &amp; Bradsby's attorney.
   Hillerich &amp; Bradsby has faced other challenges to its contract
system, but ``nothing this direct,'' said Milliman.

   Three sailors and 38 non-nuclear missiles on
the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower were washed overboard
during exercises today, the Navy said. Two sailors were rescued and
one was missing.
   Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett said that the 18 Sparrow and 20
Sidewinder missiles went down in deep water and that the air-to-air
missiles posed no risk.
   ``They were not nuclear-powered. They were not armed,'' said
another spokesman, Senior Chief Petty Officer Cindy Adams.
``Therefore, they're harmless.''
   The Navy said two of the sailors were rescued at 2:15 a.m. after
an hour in the water and were treated on board. One was reported in
critical but stable condition, the other in good condition. Their
names were withheld.
   It was the third serious Navy accident in as many days.
   On Sunday, a student pilot crashed while trying to land on the
carrier Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killing him and four
people on ship. On Monday, a pilot accidentally dropped a bomb on
the guided missile cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, injuring
five sailors.
   In today's accident, the sailors were moving gear from the
flight deck to the hangar deck when a wave washed them overboard
about 90 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C., he said.
   Burnett said helicopters from a squadron in Jacksonville, Fla.,
took part in the search for the third sailor.
   By far the worst Navy accident this year was the explosion in a
turret of the USS Iowa in April. The blast killed 47 sailors.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said he saw no
connection between the three recent Navy accidents. Hoffman said
the Navy has an excellent safety record.

<HEAD>New Home Sales Off Dramatically, but Analysts See Improvement Ahead</HEAD>

   New home sales fell a dramatic 14 percent last
month, the government reported Tuesday, but analysts said a truer _
and more optimistic _ picture of the housing industry would be
obtained by averaging sales over several months.
   Many economists also predicted mortgage interest rates would
continue to fall, leading to some improvement in the industry but,
as one said, ``no major resurgence.''
   The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 618,000 units in September
compared to 719,000 units in August, the sharpest drop since a 19
percent decline in January 1982 during the last recession.
   The August sales had been revised sharply downward from 758,000
but still approximated the level in July, when sales gained 14.6
percent to an annual rate of 742,000 units.
   ``The September numbers reflect a market correction from
extraordinarily high sales activity in July and August that could
not be sustained,'' said chief economist John A. Tuccillo of the
National Association of Realtors.
   ``Buyers flooded the new home market last summer when mortgage
rates started falling and as a result borrowed sales from
September.''
   ``A better measure is probably gotten by averaging the three
months,'' agreed chief economist David Berson of the Federal
National Mortgage Association. ``That shows that home sales picked
up in the third quarter, primarily because of a decline in mortgage
rates.''
   Analysts had credited the July advance to a decline in
fixed-rate mortgages to 9.81 percent by the end of that month from
a peak of 11.22 percent last March.
   But rates edged back up to 10.22 percent by the end of August
and remained in that range throughout September, according to
surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said rates should continue to fall between now and
mid-1990 resulting in further improvement in the housing industry,
but ``no major resurgence.''
   The Realtors reported last week that sales of existing homes
rose 4.3 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.63 million units, the highest level this year.
   New home sales for the first nine months were down 4.5 percent
from the same period in 1988.
   Sales fell 35.6 percent in the Northeast in September after
declining 10.9 percent the previous month. They were off 15.7
percent in the South after a 5.3 percent gain in August, and 9.8
percent in the West following a 1.7 percent rise the previous
month. Sales in the Midwest were unchanged after falling 24.4
percent in August.
   In another report Tuesday, the Realtors said an index measuring
the ability of the typical American family to buy an existing home
rose in September to the highest level in six months, reflecting
both falling home prices and relatively stable mortgage rates.
   The National Association of Realtors said its index rose to
104.7, meaning that a family with a median income of $33,248 had
104.7 percent of the income needed to buy a median-priced existing
home costing $93,400.
   The median means that half of the families earn more and half
less, or that half the homes sell for more and half for less.

<HEAD>Guildford Four Case Brings Demands for New Look at Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The admission that four people were wrongly
convicted for an IRA bombing 14 years ago has brought demands for
reviews of other convictions based solely on confessions.
   Since the ``Guildford Four'' were exonerated Oct. 19, the Rev.
Ian Paisley and other Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland have
demanded a second look at the convictions of four members of the
Ulster Defense Regiment for murder in 1983.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey was among the first to call
for a review of the case of six Irish men convicted of killing 21
people in a pub bombing in Birmingham in 1974.
   The Guildford appeal, coming on the heels of revelations that
officers in the Midlands force had altered confessions and that
some police in Kent had solicited false confessions, has raised
fresh questions about the adequacy of laws on police procedure.
   ``It would appear that large sections of Britain's various
police forces are out of control,'' Conor Gearty, a professor of
law at Cambridge University, wrote in The Irish Times after the
Guildford convictions were thrown out.
   But Barrie Irving, director of the Police Foundation, believes
Parliament has done as much as it could do in laying down
safeguards in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984. One
provision of that act will require all interrogations to be
tape-recorded by 1991.
   However, Irving said in an interview, ``there could be more
training on the positive, ethical values in police work.''
   ``Simply saying that the legislation is in place doesn't mean
that there isn't an ethical problem in policing at the moment,'' he
said.
   On Monday, the Home Office announced preliminary compensation of
$80,000 each for Gerard Conlon, 35, Patrick Armstrong, 39 and
Carole Richardson, 32, who were freed after their convictions in
the Guildford bombing were quashed. Paul Hill, 35, who is free on
bail pending appeal of a separate murder conviction in Northern
Ireland, was given $16,000.
   The convictions of Conlon and Armstrong for a pub bombing in the
London suburb of Woolwich were also thrown out after the court
heard evidence that police had lied about their statements.
   Douglas Hurd, then the home secretary, also ordered a review of
the convictions of Conlon's aunt, Annie Maguire, and six other
members of her family on explosives charges.
   Statements by Conlon and Hill were instrumental in convicting
the seven. They included Conlon's father, who died in prison. The
other six have since been released.
   Both the UDR and Birmingham cases were raised in the House of
Commons in the hours after the Guildford Four were exonerated.
   ``The one person who brought the vital evidence has now stated
publicly that she was forced by pressure from the security forces
to make false statements,'' Paisley said.
   James Hagan, Noel Bell, Winston Allen and Neil Latimer, all
members of the locally raised British Army unit, were convicted in
1986 of the Nov. 8, 1983, murder of Adrian Carroll near his home in
Armagh, Northern Ireland.
   Latimer had been identified by a woman as the killer, but she
later recanted her testimony. The four claim their confessions were
made under duress.
   Hurd told Paisley the UDR case was a matter for authorities in
Northern Ireland.
   He also opposed reopening the Birmingham case because it had
been reviewed by an appeals court in 1987.
   In that review, Hurd said, ``the court hearing lasted for more
than a month and it spent five days considering the crucial point
about the validity of the confessions.''
   In the Guildford and Woolwich cases, there were subsequent
confessions of responsibility by members of an IRA gang.
   In the Birmingham case, there have been no such confessions to
authorities. Chris Mullin, who wrote a book on the Birmingham case
in 1986, said he interviewed three men who admitted involvement.
Mullin, a member of Parliament, has not identified those men.
   Over the weekend, retired detective constable Fred Willoughby,
who arrested five of the six men, expressed doubts about their
convictions.
   ``I am deeply concerned that those men could be detained in
prison for the rest of their lives while there is some doubt in the
case,'' The Independent newspaper quoted Willoughby as saying.
   Willoughby said the men made no effort to escape, and he said
details of their stories that he checked turned out to be true.
However, he said, the men initially concealed the fact that at the
time of their arrest, they were traveling to Belfast for the
funeral of an IRA man killed in England by his own bomb.
   Advocates for the Birmingham defendants were heartened by the
Guildford case.
   ``The case has exposed fundamental flaws in the British judicial
and appeals system,'' said Andrew Puddephatt, general secretary of
Liberty, formerly the National Council for Civil Liberties.
   A review of the Birmingham case, Puddephatt said, ``is essential
to reassure members of the Irish community who increasingly feel
they cannot get justice in British courts.''

   First there was Live Aid, then Farm Aid. And now
there's Van Aid _ a benefit concert to rescue a man's impounded
vehicle from the city of New York.
   John Rinaldi used his van to move equipment for local bands, but
the city seized it Oct. 9 because of dozens of unpaid tickets. He
needs $5,000 to get his van back from the Parking Violations Bureau.
   ``When the PVB towed the van, I couldn't work. So the bands
banded together and they're all going to play and donate the
money,'' Rinaldi said.
   It won't be the usual benefit lineup of superstars Friday night
at a Manhattan club. Raising funds for Rinaldi, 21, will be the
Rats of Unusual Size, the Deans of Discipline, The Thing, Woo, the
Wilmingtons and a band with an unprintable name. Rinaldi's own
band, Lech Patrol, is headlining.
   The $10 cover charge is expected to raise most of the money, but
Rinaldi, who is a guitarist, came up with a supplemental plan: He's
raffling off a 23-inch-by-17-inch photo of himself shaking hands
with Parking Violations Bureau boss Elizabeth Brickfield. Both are
standing in front of a tow truck.
   ``We consider him a good customer, so why not?'' said Ms.
Brickfield, the PVB director of enforcement.
   Rinaldi said T-shirts will be sold to raise additional money and
a video of the concert will be made for sale in the future ``so I
can keep getting tickets and paying them off.''

   An infant who was submerged in an
icy river for 45 minutes after an auto accident clung to life today.
   Month-old Samantha Venable was in critical condition on life
support systems at St. Mary's Hospital, a nursing supervisor said.
   A doctor lowered himself down a 60-foot rock wall Sunday to pull
the baby from an upside-down car after it slid off a snowpacked
highway and plunged into the Roaring Fork River, the Sheriff's
Department said.
   The baby's mother, Kary Venable, 19, of Kingwood, Texas, and two
grandparents were killed in the accident. Investigators said the
family was hitchhiking after their own car slid into a snowbank.
   The baby had no pulse when Dr. Steve Ayers pulled her from the
water but was resuscitated with help from more than 35 medical and
rescue workers.
   Two teen-age driver and a passenger managed to kick out the
windows and crawl to safety, said sheriff's spokesman Steve
Crockett.
   If Samatha survives, it will be a few years before doctors will
know if she suffered permanent damage, said pediatrician Dr.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany has awarded its
highest medal for civlians to a Dutch woman who helped hide Anne
Frank from the Nazis, the West German Embassy said Tuesday.
   Miep Gies is being given the Federal Cross of Merit First Class
because of her ``crucial role'' in hiding the world famous Jewish
diarist and her family, the embassy said.
   Mrs. Gies, 80, worked as a secretary in the Amsterdam canal
house where the Frank family took refuge from 1942-44. She and her
husband, Henk, smuggled food to them while keeping their existence
secret for two years.
   In recent years, she has toured West German schools to talk
about her wartime experiences.
   ``In spite of her experiences with Germans, she has eliminated
the word `hate' from her vocabulary,'' the embassy said, adding the
medal will be presented by Ambassador Otto von der Gablentz on
Friday.
   By awarding the decoration, the West Germans ``are showing they
want to come to terms with the (wartime) past,'' Mrs. Gies said in
an interview. ``It's a little late, though.''
   Mrs. Gies plays a prominent role in Miss Frank's diary, in which
she is called Miep van Santen because Miss Frank used pseudonyms
for many people in the book.
   Born in 1929 in Germany, Miss Frank and her family fled to the
Netherlands from Nazi persecution in 1933, only to be caught upin
the persecution of Dutch Jews during the 1940-45 German military
occupation of the Netherlands.
   Along with her father, mother, sister and four other Jews, Miss
Frank hid behind a secret door in the rear annex of the building
where her father, Otto, had run an importing firm.
   The hiding place was discovered by the Germans in August 1944,
and Miss Frank died at the age of 15 in the Bergen-Belsen
concentration camp in March 1945, one month before its liberation
by Allied troops.
   For most of the post-war period, Mrs. Gies avoided publicity,
but in 1987, she published her memoirs, ``Anne Frank Remembered,
The Story of Miep Gies, Who Helped to Hide the Frank Family.''
   The medal ``is a token of humanity, which I want to share with
everybody who helped'' Jewish fugitives, Mrs. Gies said. ``It's no
merit of ours that Anne Frank, of all people, ended up hiding with
us.''

<TEXT>
   Former North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt told a
House panel Tuesday that the United States must make special
efforts to interest minority and women students in math and science.
   ``There will be no stopping this nation if we do what we'are
capble of doing,'' said Hunt, who heads the National Board for
Professional Teaching Standards, a private group that pushes for
national teacher qualifcation standards.
   ``We've got to have teachers who can turn students on to science
and math. It's tough, but there are those who can do it.''
   Hunt, governor of North Carolina from 1977-85, was among 10
witnesses testifying before the House science, research and
technology subcommittee in support of an $80 million bill
introduced by Rep. David Price, D.-N.C.
   ``The United States is losing its competitive edge in the global
economy, and our stature as a major economic power will suffer
unless we take action now to improve the skills of our workforce,''
Hunt said.
   The Price measure, co-sponsored by Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y., would provide 50 percent matching grants from the National
Science Foundation to organizations to develop and distribute new
curricula in math and the sciences, and grants to local school
districts to acquire new curricula.
   It also would provide similar matching grants from the National
Science Foundation to groups that agree to develop and disseminate
new methods for teaching science and technology.
   Yet another would establish a grant program at the National
Science Foundation for community colleges that ``offer exemplary
advanced technician training,'' and would establish 10 National
Centers of Technician Training to serve as clearinghouses.

<HEAD>Hundreds March for Return of Marcos' Body</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANIQUI, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of protesters chanted
slogans Tuesday for the return of Ferdinand Marcos' body as his
supporters marched through the stronghold of President Corazon
Aquino's family.
   During the rally, about 400 townspeople joined about 500 others
who since Oct. 24 have been marching the 250 miles from Batac south
to Manila to demand Marcos' body be brought back from Hawaii, where
the former president died Sept. 28.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos' body and members of his
immediate family to return to the Philippines, citing national
security concerns.
   On Tuesday, the caravan stopped in this city of 55,000 people
about 75 miles north of Manila. Paniqui is the hometown of Eduardo
Cojuangco, Mrs. Aquino's first cousin but a strong Marcos supporter.
   Protesters chanted: ``Return the body of President Marcos!''
and, using Cojuangco's nickname, ``Return Danding!''
   Although a relative of Mrs. Aquino, Cojuangco fled to the United
States after the 1986 popular uprising that toppled Marcos. The
government has forbidden the return of Cojuangco.
   Marchers carried placards reading ``There must be justice in the
Aquino administration'' and ``Danding forever.''
   ``This administration must do justice to the Filipino people,
especially for the return of the former president,'' said former
Mayor Vivencio Tayag.
   Minibuses, jeeps and trucks lined the streets. March leaders
said they planned to drive through Tarlac, the provincial capital
and stronghold of the Aquino family, and Pampanga province, near
the U.S.-run Clark Air Base.
   On Friday, the Philippines Supreme Court, in an 8-7 decision,
upheld Mrs. Aquino's ban on the return of Marcos' body and
relatives. Marcos' body was entombed in Hawaii on Oct. 15 in what
his family said was a temporary arrangement until the body could be
returned to the Philippines.

<TEXT>
   At an unprecedented meeting of NATO
and Warsaw Pact lawmakers Tuesday, a Polish delegate accused the
West of lacking the vision of postwar America that gave rise to the
rebuilding of Western Europe.
   Western participants said too much has transpired in 40 years
for the West to launch a similar recovery plan for nations like
Poland and Hungary.
   Members of the Polish, Hungarian and Czechoslovak parliaments
are taking part for the first time in a session of the North
Atlantic Assembly, the advisory body of lawmakers from the 16
nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting through
Thursday.
   The assembly decided at its annual meeting in Rome last month
that lawmakers from the two dominant military alliances should
discuss how to enhance security while Europe undergoes sweeping
changes.
   The Czechoslovaks ignored Western slaps at their brutal
dispersing of demonstrators in Prague over the weekend. Hungarians
and Poles used the session to seek Western support for reform
programs.
   ``We need a Marshall Plan,'' said Jacek Szymanderski, a
Solidarity member of Poland's Parliament and deputy head of the
defense committee. He referred to the financial aid program drafted
in 1947 by U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall that
underwrote the recovery of war-ravaged Western Europe.
   ``You don't have the vision that Marshall had for the future of
Europe,'' Szymanderski told the NATO delegates.
   The Polish delegate and Hungary's parliamentary defense
committee chairman, Laszlo Gyuricza, argued that their nations
should be viewed as potential allies and trading partners and that
Western aid should be directed toward their eventual integration.
   U.S. and West European leaders have pledged generous financial
aid to Poland and Hungary as they take steps toward democratic
governments and market-oriented economies.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will visit Poland next week,
bearing more than $1 billion in debt relief and financing for new
projects.
   The East European lawmakers complained Western efforts are
unfocused.
   ``We want more than economic assistance, we would like a
political guarantee that you have a concept that integrates us into
Western Europe,'' Szymanderski said.
   Western participants suggested their aid will fall short of the
East's expectations.
   ``We don't see the possibility to combine the two economic
systems,'' Claude-Gerard Marcus of the French Parliament said.
``Good will is not enough to solve the problems.''
   Heinrich Vogel, head of the West German government's Institute
for Eastern and International Studies, said conditions in Eastern
Europe differ greatly from Western Europe in the late 1940s and
that four decades of East-West confrontation cannot be overcome
with simple measures.
   He advised the NATO nations to agree to short-term humanitarian
aid to all nations of Eastern Europe to help solve food and
medicine shortages.
   ``The commitment of the West will be judged by its humanitarian
nature, not its political aims,'' Vogel said.
   Another West German, Dieter Kastrup, suggested doing away with
the term ``East bloc'' because he said the reform movements in some
Warsaw Pact states have resulted in an alliance of drastically
varied nations.
   Klaus Francke, also a West German delegate, noted that some East
European nations have made little effort at reform and told the
Czechoslovak delegates their government's arrest of pro-democracy
demonstrators over the weekend was ``not acceptable.''
   Bohuslav Kucera, vice president of the Czechoslovak parliament,
responded to criticism with a lengthy defense of his nation's
economic policies.

   Want to hear about Brad Fearn's two
vacations this year? His golf trip to South Carolina was wrecked by
Hurricane Hugo and his World Series trek to San Francisco came just
in time for the earthquake.
   ``It's been a pretty bad year for vacations. It's just one of
those things that happens,'' said the sales manager for a travel
agency.
   Fearn was in Myrtle Beach, S.C., when the hurricane hit Sept. 21.
   ``I never dreamed it was going to be anything like it was,''
Fearn said. ``We moved inland farther to a small motel and kind of
weathered the storm there.''
   Fearn arrived Oct. 17 to attend the third game of the World
Series and visit a friend in San Francisco with his 12-year-old
son. They headed straight from the airport to Candlestick Park for
the baseball game.
   ``We were sitting about 13 rows from the field, just sitting and
watching batting practice,'' Fearn said. ``And then it happened.
   ``We were supposed to stay with our friend. He lived in the
Marina district and we couldn't get there because of the fire and
all of that. So we slept in our car the first night and then got a
motel room the next day.''
   Fearn, 39, and his wife, Barrie, who was not along for the
earlier trips, plan a vacation together in a couple of weeks.
   ``We're going to Marco Island, Fla., for a long weekend,'' Mrs.
Fearn said. ``And I'm kind of apprehensive about going with him.''
   Fearn has taken a lot of ribbing from his friends in this
north-central Ohio town about 50 miles northeast of Columbus.
   ``I have a tough time getting people to sit in the same
bleachers with me at a soccer game,'' he said.

<HEAD>Detainee: Overzealous Border Guards Responsible For Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Briton said Tuesday that he
and six Americans were detained in Mozambique because of
overzealous border guards who arrested them in neighboring Malawi.
   Peter Hammond, who lives in South Africa, was picked up Oct. 24
with the Americans and a South African for allegedly entering
Mozambique illegally from Malawi.
   The Mozambican government held the eight for six days before
releasing them Monday. Although one official said they had no
``malevolent intention,'' all were asked to leave Mozambique.
   The Americans are part of the Christian Emergency Relief Team, a
missionary medical group based in Carlsbad, Calif. They were sent
to assist refugees who have fled war-torn Mozambique for Malawi,
according to organization officials in the United States.
   Hammond said in Johannesburg that the group was on an isolated
road in Malawi and made a wrong turn, taking it toward a Mozambican
border post. While on the Malawi side of the border, the group
asked the Mozambicans for directions, Hammond said.
   He said the Mozambican guards raised their guns, crossed into
Malawi and detained the eight. The two sides spoke no common
language, he said.
   The eight were interrogated on several occasions and eventually
taken to Mozambique's capital, Maputo, where they were held in
solitary confinement at the Machava Prison, Hammond said.
   The six Americans are Dr. Ken Daugherty of San Diego; Dr. Fred
Leist and his wife, Lucille, of Bremerton, Wash.; John Cannon, a
dentist from Davenport, Iowa; and paramedics Carol Roberts of
Syracuse, N.Y., and Steve Sherrill of Stroudsburg, Pa.
   Hammond has been linked to helping the rebels of the Mozambique
National Resistance, which has been fighting the leftist government
since 1977.
   Hammond, head of the Frontline Fellowship missionary group,
denied he had political ties to the rebels. He acknowledged having
met a rebel official in Zimbabwe and having preached to rebel
fighters.
   Mozambique's national news agency AIM described Hammond's
organization as a ``far-right, quasi-religious outfit ... openly
supportive'' of the rebels.
   The Christian Emergency Relief Team has sent missionary medical
teams to Lebanon, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, the Philippines and other
war-torn countries since 1974. The organization is led by David
Courson, an outspoken foe of communism.
   Hundreds of thousands of Mozambican's have died in the war and a
similar number have fled into Malawi. About half of Mozambique's 15
million people are in need of some sort of food aid.

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday elected Premier
Turgut Ozal president for a seven-year term, opening the way for a
change of government under a new premier he will select.
   In a session boycotted by all 155 opposition members of
parliament, 263 deputies from Ozal's ruling Motherland Party voted
for him.
   Fethi Celikbas, the only other candidate and a member of Ozal's
party, received 14 votes.
   Ozal, 62, was elected on the third ballot, after having failed
to muster the required two-thirds majority of 300 votes in the
first two ballots Oct. 20 and Oct. 24. A simple majority was
sufficient on the third ballot.
   In a brief speech after his election, Ozal thanked the
Parliament and said the election of a president from within the
legislature was a ``victory of democracy in Turkey.''
   Ozal became Turkey's first civilian president since 1960 and the
first premier to move up to the highly respected but ceremonial
post.
   Ozal's premiership automatically came to an end with his
election. He also has to resign his party membership.
   Deputy Premier Ali Bozer will serve as caretaker premier until
Ozal names a deputy from his Motherland Party to form a new
government.
   Ozal takes over from President Kenan Evren when his term expires
Nov. 9.
   The president has little executive power. He can veto
legislation but parliament can overturn his vetoes. He can refuse
to appoint cabinet ministers suggested by the premier, but this
authority has been used sparingly in the past.
   The president can be impeached only on charges of high treason
and otherwise is not accountable for the use of his executive
powers. He cannot be re-elected to a second term.
   Analysts said Ozal, who has had heart bypass surgery, wanted the
less- strenuous job for reasons of health and political prestige.
   Hours before the presidential balloting, Ozal polled deputies
from the Motherland Party on the choice of the future premier. He
submitted 18 names, all parliament members and many included in his
cabinet, and asked deputies to choose four names they favored as
well as four they opposed. The result of the poll has not been
disclosed.
   The list included Deputy Premier Ali Bozer, Foreign Minister
Mesut Yilmaz, Finance Minister Ekrem Pakdemirli, Justice Minister
Oltan Sungurlu, Communications Minister Cengiz Tuncer, former
Education Minister Hasan Celal Guzel and former Finance Minister
Kaya Erdem.
   Ozal's candidacy drew protests from his own party as well as the
opposition. Four deputies from the Motherland Party resigned from
their party and not all members of the 285-member Motherland
parliamentary group voted for him.
   A Gallup poll published by the national daily Sabah on Saturday
showed that only 27 percent of respondents supported an Ozal
presidency. Another poll published by the daily Hurriyet showed
support of 19.3 percent.
   The opposition, citing the stinging defeat of Ozal's party in
nationwide local elections in March, has said the election of Ozal
as president would be against the spirit of the constitution if not
its letter.
   They also claimed that Ozal, the first premier attempting to
become head of state, could not be the nonpartisan president
required by the constitution.
   The opposition parties did not name a candidate of their own,
saying he had no chance in view of the Motherland majority in the
450-seat parliament.
   The military, traditionally active in presidential politics,
stayed out this time.

   The White House helped 500 local school
children celebrate Halloween Tuesday, and along with the treats the
kids got an admonition from President Bush to beware of something
truly scary: illegal drugs.
   Bush and wife Barbara _ ``the first family of ghosts and
goblins,'' as emcee and TV weatherman Willard Scott called them _
emerged through the mouth of a 15-foot jack-o-lantern erected over
the staid diplomatic entrance of the White House.
   The White House collected pledge cards from the children
foreswearing drugs.
   ``You know they say that there's a ghost in this old house, and
the most famous one is Abraham Lincoln,'' said Bush. ``Barbara and
I haven't seen the ghost of Abraham Lincoln walking the halls, but
this is our first Halloween in the White House, so maybe we'll see
him tonight.''
   The president said, ``Halloween is a time for ghosts and
goblins, for haunted houses and scary stories.''
   But there is one ``scary story that isn't make-believe,'' he
said. ``You know what I'm talking about ... illegal drugs and how
they hurt people, how they hurt families, hurt kids, some of them
just like you.''
   He read a letter from a 5th grade girl named Ana Zamora at
Pickard School in Chicago:
   ``Dear President Bush ...
   ``I never go outside because my Mom gets scared that I will get
hurt because of the gang fights. ... I have heard that you are
pushing for a war on drugs. Please help remove drugs from our
neighborhoods. I will do my part by saying no to drugs, and I hope
you can do yours. I know this is hard, but you can do it.''
   Bush promised, ``We will do our best.''
   The kids, decked out in their own Halloween costumes, left the
White House with loot bags and starfish pins to remind them of the
story Bush told last month in a lunchtime address to students about
the war on drugs.
   In that tale, an old man asks a young boy why he bothers to
throw starfish back into the ocean when there were millions drying
up and dying on the beach. It ``can't make any difference at all,''
the old man says.
   The boy just throws another starfish back in, saying, ``It makes
a difference to this one.''
   It showered briefly on the White House Halloween Spectacular, as
it was billed, but for the most part the leaden skies held their

buses.
   Even some Secret Service agents came garbed as clowns, while the
children disported themselves as ghouls, caped crusaders,

   The Bushes were joined at the festivities by 3-year-old

Margaret Bush, and Marilyn Quayle, wife of the vice president.

   A former Revolutionary Guards minister
was installed as Iran's new navy commander Tuesday amid a major
shakeup in the military.
   The transfer of Ali Saleh Shamkhani to the regular forces
underlined the unity of the Islamic republic's defense forces, said
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
   Khamenei, who is commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces,
appointed Shamkhani on Monday to replace Rear Adm. Mohammad-Hussein
Malekzadegan.
   Shamkhani, 34, was an urban guerrilla during the 1979 Islamic
revolution and commanded several successful military operations
during the eight-year war with Iraq. Shamkhani was made a rear
admiral.
   At a ceremony in Tehran, Khamenei told Shamkhani he was promoted
because of his ``valuable services and great endeavors in the
scenes of war and victorious missions, and the sensitive duties in
the Islamic Republic Guards Corps.'' An account of the ceremony was
carried on the official Islamic Republic News Agency, which was
monitored in Cyprus.
   Malekzadegan commanded the Iranian navy for the last three years
of the war with Iraq before fighting was halted in August 1988 when
a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire took effect. During his
tenure, several key Iranian warships were sunk or damaged in
battles with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf.
   Tehran Radio, announcing the move Monday, quoted Khamenei as
praising the ``great strides'' made by the 14,500-man navy under
Malekzadegan.
   It gave no reason for his abrupt dismissal, but several ranking
officers in the navy were arrested earlier this year for spying for
the CIA.
   They and other alleged CIA agents are scheduled to make public
confessions Saturday, the 10th anniversary of the storming of the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979.
   Iraq said two Iranian gunboats fired on an Iraqi tug last week
in the Persian Gulf, killing a crewman. Malekzadegan, who was
conducting naval exercises in the waterway at the time, denied the
incident occurred.
   IRNA said Tuesday that Malekzadegan has been appointed an
adviser to Khamenei, a move seen as a demotion.
   He is the highest-ranking officer to lose his post in the
shakeup launched by Khamenei, the key ally of President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, amid a major rearmament program following the
cease-fire.
   Khamenei made major changes in September in the command of the
350,000-member Revolutionary Guards Corps under Mohsen Rezaie, who
has been the force's military chief since 1982.
   He also appointed Hassan Firouzabadi, 38, deputy chief of the
armed forces headquarters, as army chief of staff Sept. 28 and
named Brig. Gen. Ali Shahbazi chief of the joint staff of the armed
forces.
   The shuffle followed the merger this year of the Revolutionary
Guards ministry and the Defense Ministry, which oversees Iran's
regular forces, to streamline the chain of command.
   Shamkhani was named Revolutionary Guards Minister in 1988 in a
major shakeup following a series of military defeats in the closing
stages of the war. He replaced Mohsen Rafiqdoust, Rafsanjani's
brother-in-law.
   Shamkani lost that position in August when Iran's new president,
Hashemi Rafsanjani, announced his government and appointed Akbar
Torkan as minister of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics.
   Torkan is a close Rafsanjani aide and formerly headed of the
Defense Industries Organization that built up Iran's military
industry during the war.
   The Revolutionary Guards and the regular army, air force and
navy remain separate entities, despite earlier moves to merge them.
   Khamenei opposes such a merger, while Rafsanjani has tried to
eliminate the parallel chains of command that hampered military
operations during the war.
   Rafsanjani was named acting commander-in-chief in June 1988 by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to upgrade Iran's battered forces. He
relinquished the post in August following his election. Khamenei,
who succeeded Khomeini, took over.
   Political and military rivalry between the regular forces and
the Guards Corps were heightened by lack of coordination between
the two forces. These were significant factors in Iran's
battlefield defeats in early 1988 that led to Tehran
unconditionally accepting the U.N. Security Council's cease-fire
resolution.
   It was not clear whether the military shake-up was linked to
political feuding between Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called
pragmatists, and revolutionary radicals led by former Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   Western analysts believe that although Rafsanjani has emerged as
the most powerful political figure in Iran, he faces potential
challenges from the radicals.
   They oppose his moves to restore relations with the West to end
Iran's isolation following Khomeini's death June 3.

<HEAD>Revolutionary Guards Whip Up Anti-American Sentiment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament passed a bill Tuesday allowing
Iran to arrest any American anywhere who offends it, and fanatics
of the Revolutionary Guards whipped up fervor about the seizure of
the U.S. Embassy 10 years ago.
   Iranian militants stormed the embassy Nov. 4, 1979, and held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days.
   Chief Justice Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said the bill approved by
150 members of the 270-seat parliament responded to the ``bullying
nature'' of the United States.
   He referred specifically to a Justice Department ruling that
U.S. government agents could pursue and apprehend terrorists in
other countries, which he called ``the worst kind of terrorism and
kidnapping.''
   The bill must be approved by the Council of Guardians, 12
religious leaders and exports on Islamic law who decide
constitutional questions.
   According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Iran's agents
could seek and arrest any Americans who committed any action
against Iranian citizens or territories and bring them to Iran for
trial under Islamic law.
   It said the authority would apply to countries that gave the
right of arrest to U.S. law enforcement agencies and would continue
while the U.S. ``enjoys the right to commit such irresponsible
acts.''
   The law ``aims at preserving the prestige and territorial
integrity of the Islamic Republic, safeguarding the lives and
properties of Iranian nationals abroad and defending the interests
of the Islamic Republic,'' IRNA reported.
   U.S. laws enacted in 1984 and 1986 gave American authorities
jurisdiction to prosecute acts of terrorism involving U.S. citizens
overseas, but not the power of arrest abroad without the permission
of foreign governments.
   In June, the U.S. Justice Department authorized the FBI to
arrest people wanted by U.S. courts without permission of the
foreign government. Details of the authorization were made public
this month.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was said to be disturbed
by the ruling on grounds it could harm relations with other
countries.
   A statement Tuesday from the Revolutionary Guards Corps said
tens of thousands of its members would lead demonstrators Saturday
outside the former U.S. Embassy to ``mark this great day'' when
militants overran it.
   The Guards, who swore personal loyalty to revolutionary
patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini until he died in June, urged
all Iranians to join the demonstration and chant ``Death to
America!''
   It said the purpose was ``humiliation of the Great Satan, the
criminal America,'' and U.S. flags should be burned.
   On Sunday, the official news agency said Nov. 4 had been named
``Day of Struggle Against Global Arrogance.'' The Great Satan and
Global Arrogance are favorite Iranian names for the United States.
   Organizations representing students, radical clerics and other
groups appealed for mass demonstrations.
   Until Sunday, President Hashemi Rafsanjani's government appeared
to be seeking a low-key approach to the anniversary.
   Rafsanjani, who leads the so-called pragmatists in Iran, was
elected president July 28. He has sought to end Iran's political
isolation and improve ties with the West, but anti-Western radicals
oppose him.

<HEAD>Treasury Proposes Tighter Recordkeeping in Drug War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department proposed on Tuesday
ways to track the billions of dollars in illegal drug trafficking
profits that escape official notice through international wire
transfers of funds.
   ``World-wide gross drug revenues are estimated to be $300
billion,'' the department said in publishing its proposals in the
Federal Register. ``Illegal drug revenues in the United States are
estimated to total $110 billion.''
   The Treasury proposals generally would require more complete
recordkeeping of international payments and reporting of large
transfers of credit between domestic and foreign financial
institutions.
   Currently, banks are required to report cash deposits or
withdrawals of $10,000 or more. But officials say this leaves a
loophole because it does not include wire transfers.
   To track the movement of drug profits, the Treasury is proposing
that financial institutions keep detailed records of the originator
and recipient of any international wire transfer.
   It also would require banks and other institutions to use ``know
your customer'' procedures to verify the legitimate nature of the
customer's business.
   Another proposal under consideration would ``require that
financial institutions develop a suspicious international wire
transfer profile and report suspicious payments to Treasury.''
   The department emphasized that the proposals published Tuesday
are not meant to be exclusive and said it is open to other
suggestions. Interested parties have 60 days to comment on the
proposals after which the department will offer specific
regulations for another 60-day comment period.

<HEAD>Bush Letter in July Set Summit Plans in Motion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High above the Atlantic Ocean, President Bush
last July composed the letter to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
that would result in the first at-sea superpower summit in nearly
half a century.
   With his visit to fast-changing Poland and Hungary fresh in his
mind, Bush wrote the invitation July 18 aboard Air Force One as he
flew home from Europe after a seven-nation economic summit in Paris.
   His journey to the East bloc nations, and talks with U.S. allies
in Paris, persuaded him that his first meeting as president with
the Soviet leader should be an informal one, ``without much
fanfare,'' Bush said in announcing the summit meeting Tuesday.
   Unveiling what had been the administration's best-kept foreign
policy secret, Bush announced that he and Gorbachev would meet Dec.
2 and 3 aboard U.S. and Soviet naval vessels in the Mediterranean.
   The meeting, with many logistics still to be worked out, would
be the first high-seas summit since President Franklin D. Roosevelt
met with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill on a battleship
in the North Atlantic in 1941 to discuss the war in Europe.
   Bush, who has been accused by some of dragging his feet on
holding a meeting with Gorbachev, repeatedly said at a news
conference that he had been the one to initiate the meeting, and
that he had done so in July.
   ``I didn't want to _ in this time of dynamic change (in Eastern
Europe) _ miss something, something that I might get better
firsthand from Mr. Gorbachev,'' he said.
   A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, provided some of the details of the genesis of
December's meeting.
   Nearly every leader Bush met with in both Poland and Hungary,
from Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to government officials,
urged Bush to ``be supportive'' of Gorbachev's efforts to reform
his own country and to ``release some of the bonds on their
countries,'' the official said.
   ``So out of that, the president's thinking was that that would
be the kind of thing that he would like to do in private
discussions but without having to worry about the pressures and
burdens of arms control agreements and the more formal agenda
items,'' the official said.
   Bush took pains to say there is no set agenda of issues to be
discussed, but the official said, ``Clearly he'll have a set of
specific ideas.''
   When Bush met with major U.S. allies during the economic summit,
many of those leaders also called on him to meet with Gorbachev,
the sooner the better, the official said.
   Bush was exploring ``a way to have a meeting with the general
secretary but which would be something short of the traditional
summit,'' the official said.
   In a meeting with top staff aides on the veranda of the U.S.
ambassador's residence in Paris, Bush advanced the idea of ``a
non-summit summit,'' the official said.
   Gorbachev responded to Bush's letter in early August _ accepting
the idea and touching off a flurry of cables between Moscow and
Washington as details slowly began to take shape.
   There was one problem, however: Specifics still hadn't been
nailed down on the next formal summit, which by custom would be
held in the United States.
   ``We wanted to get the larger summit set before we finalized
this one,'' the official said.
   Finally, when Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met in Wyoming in September to
cement plans for a formal summit next year, that opened the way to
plan details for the mid-ocean summit, the official said.
   A decision was made to hold the meeting on two ships in the
Mediterranean ``because they wanted it informal, isolated'' and to
promote the concept of neutrality, the official said.

   A: I'd just refer him to what we've decided is going to be the
matrix of the meeting.
   Q: So, basically you would try to put it off until _
   A: Well, I don't _ I don't attempt _ I don't expect other than a
very broad way this _ these questions to arise because we have a
summit set to address ourselves to those. Yeah?
   Q: Daniel Ortega was supposed to decide today whether to end the
cease-fire. If he does in fact end the cease-fire, are you prepared
with some sort of response?
   A: Well, as I said down there, I'm not going to go into that
hypothetical situation at this time. But I'll tell you, I've never
seen a meeting where all the participants were so united against
the outrages of one, I mean _ and we're still getting messages in
about the outrageous performance of Daniel Ortega _ reached a new
embarrasing proportions stepping on it.
   Q: Is renewed military aid to the Contras though, still a viable
option now? Is that something you could consider if needed?
   A: Well, I am not _ as I indicated down there, I would
re-evaluate the situation in a minute if this cease-fire is broken.
Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, were you upset at all by Secretary of State
Baker's _ (inaudible) _ Soviet policy _ (inaudible) _
   A: I've discussed this matter with Mr. Baker, and Mr. Gates, and
Mr. Scowcroft, even discussed it with Marlin Fitzwater _ (laughter)
_ don't say I don't reach out _ (laughter) _ and John, and you
know, these stories, who's up, who's down, who's winning, who's
not, who's going to be a hardline, we've got a good, strong team
coping with these problems, and you _ the degree in which Bob Gates
and the Secretary of State are together, and Brent and John Sununu.
Why, it's _ we've been very lucky. And so, I don't get all
exercised about that kind of thing. I know everybody else does
around here, but I don't. It's just _
   Q: _ he acknowledged that he stopped Gates _
   A: Well, I _
   Q: _ from giving a hardline speech.
   A: It wasn't a ``hardline'' speech and he didn't say that. And
maybe now we'll understand a little more of what's happening out
there as a result of what I'm talking to you today about. Right
there.
   Q: On a related question, Vice President Quayle has taken a very
hardline position, and that doesn't _ is he out of sync?
   A: No! He's totally in sync. And I had a chance to discuss this
with one of the outstanding reporters for the New York Times the
other day, who had a feeling he was ``out of sync.'' And he isn't!
And I just _ you know, everybody's looking for nuances. And that's
fine, that's your business. But I think we've been blessed in this
administration by _ the president can sit in _ by this, the
president can sit in there and get conflicting ideas and then we
don't have to go out and sound like there's disarray. So when some
see one statement that may sound a little different, then I can
understand running with that ball, because I know how this place
works. But that's _ the main thing is I feel that we are together
on these issues. And that goes for the vice president and the
secretary of state and my very able national security team. So I
don't sense this, you know, one being tugged one way or tugged
another. Huh?
   Q: Mr. President _
   A: Helen, you had three questions. Get at it. (Laughter.)
   Q: (Inaudible.)
   A: I hadn't thought about that.
   Q: Mr. President, on the environment _ another summit _ you have

   Q: Well, so I thought. You have people _
   A: I think.
   Q: _ going to the Netherlands next week who some say are

   A: We will play a leadership role in global warming, and it'll
be based on the finest, most up-to-date science possible. And we
will fulfill that role. And I think most countries, in spite of

that kind of leadership in science. And we will _ we will fulfill
it. So _ and you see both our national _ our science adviser and

good. Saul?

<HEAD>Anti-Abortion Activist Keeps Low Profile in Jail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion foe Randall Terry has spent the first
four weeks of his two-year sentence behind bars and out of the
limelight, but his critics still accuse him of using his jail time
as a publicity ploy.
   Terry, the outspoken leader of Operation Rescue, is serving time
for leading a wave of demonstrations outside women's clinics in
Atlanta during the Democratic National Convention last year.
   The 30-year-old born-again Christian and former car salesman has
been jailed 34 times previously for his protests, the longest time
for about a month in 1987. Unlike other jail terms, Terry hasn't
been allowed to do jailhouse interviews this time and is limited to
one 10-minute phone call a week.
   ``We don't get the access that we had before,'' said Barbara
Magera, spokeswoman at Operation Rescue's headquarters in
Binghamton, N.Y. ``We just got a little note from him, just
encouraging us and telling us he is doing well. That was all that
we heard from him.''
   Operation Rescue is a loose-knit grassroots organization founded
by Terry in November 1987, three years after he and his wife,
Cindy, began standing outside a clinic in Binghamton trying to
discourage women from having abortions. It has a mailing list of
about 20,000 people; Ms. Magera claims 35,000 supporters have been
jailed for protests.
   Terry was moved last week to the Alpharetta Correction and
Rehabilitation Center, north of Atlanta. He had been held in the
Fulton County jail since Oct. 5.
   Al Pierce, warden in charge of the medium-security facility,
said Terry is being treated like any other inmate. He lives in a
dormitory and has been assigned a job, Pierce said, although he
didn't know what the job was. Ms. Magera said she had been told
Terry worked on a crew installing water pipes.
   ``As far as I know, he's adjusting quite well. If he wasn't I
would have heard about it,'' Pierce said.
   Terry was given a 24-month sentence Oct. 5 for his criminal
trespass and unlawful assembly convictions over protests at an
Atlanta women's clinic July 19, 1988. Fulton County State Court
Judge John Bruner said he would suspend the sentence if Terry would
pay two $500 fines, stay out of the five-county metropolitan
Atlanta area for the 24 months and agree not to break any more
Georgia laws.
   Terry refused, and also refused to pay a $2,000 bond that would
have kept him out of jail while Operation Rescue appeals his
sentence. He said the amount was too high.
   No date has been set for the appeal. Terry has said he would
serve the full two years, if need be. The activist could go free
any time he decided to meet the requirements and pay the $1,000
fine.
   ``True to form, he has taken a media-grabbing tack of going to
jail rather than paying the fine. We would be surprised if his
melodramatic posturing as an ideological martyr keeps him in jail
for more than a few days,''' Patricia Ireland, executive vice
president of the National Organization for Women, said at the time
of the sentencing.
   However, Sally Tyler, executive director of the Georgia Abortion
Rights Action League, said recently that abortion supporters are
really not surprised that Terry has remained in jail this long.
   ``I do think he's there because he wants to be and is working
for an angle in that way,'' she said. ``He's not getting as much
media while in jail as he had hoped for.''
   Terry counts the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as one of his
heroes, but civil rights leaders object to his comparing Operation
Rescue to their movement.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a former aide to King, said Terry
had hoped the state would simply drop its charges against him, as
the city did.
   ``He was arrested blocking and interfering with people who were
pursuing their health care, and we never did that. He was trying to
deny people's legitimate rights, rights that are protected by the
Constitution, and we never did that,'' Young said.
   Ms. Magera responds: ``That kind of criticism is invalid. He is
a prisoner of conscience because he chose not to pay the fine and
agree to the banishment.''
   When arrested in Atlanta for anti-abortion demonstrations in
July 1988, Operation Rescue protesters clogged city jails, some for
as long as 40 days, by identifying themselves only as Baby Jane Doe
or Baby John Doe, to express solidarity with aborted fetuses.
   Some complained about police treatment, the length of their jail
stays, and about not being able to see their families.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, said that behavior contrasts with civil
rights activists' passive resistance.
   ``In civil disobedience, you willingly accept the penalty,''
Lowery said. So if jail is the penalty for your offense, then you
accept it as the price you pay for supporting your cause.''

<TEXT>
   Street attacks on women by bands of teen-age
girls using needles or other sharp objects appear racially
motivated, a police commander said Tuesday.
   All but one of 28 women jabbed between Oct. 21 and Oct. 27 along
a mile stretch of the city's diverse upper west side were white.
All were attacked between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. and
none was seriously hurt.
   ``The victims are selected. It appears that they're selected on
the fact that they're white,'' said police Capt. Maurice Collins,
commander of the Bias Incident Investigation Squad, which is
investigating.
   The attackers were described as black females between the ages
of 12 and 19. No arrests had been made and the city plans to post a
$10,000 reward for information leading to a conviction.
   Each of the victims was jabbed once, either in the upper or
lower back, in an arm or on the side of the face. They range in age
from 14 to 50, but most were in their 20s and early 30s, police
said.
   Most of the victims were walking alone on a street and ``were
approached usually from behind. They felt a pricking as the black
female teen-agers passed them. They observed laughing and
giggling,'' Collins said.
   Investigators said they did not know what kind of an object was
used in the attacks.
   ``It could be any kind of a sharp object. It could be a needle,
it could be a brooch pin, it could be a compass point. Something
that's sharp enough to prick the skin. ... The wounds are basically
shallow,'' Collins said.
   The thought that the weapon could be a hypodermic needle
heightened concerns that the victims could be infected with
diseases such as AIDS or hepatitis.
   ``I would doubt if it was a hypo needle,'' Collins said. ``These
are very quick jabs. For somebody to be injecting anybody with a
hypo needle would take time.''
   During most of the attacks, no remarks were passed. However, in
one of the assaults, a teen-ager cursed her victim, and in another
case, a teen-ager was heard to say, ``We're going to cut your hair
off,'' Collins said.

   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., a ``banshee?''
   No, said Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who said he was misquoted in

   On the House floor Tuesday, Roberts said he called Mrs. Martin

a few pet projects into a spending bill.

forest,'' according to the Congressional Record.
   In folklore, a banshee is a female spirit believed to wail
outside a house as a warning that a death will occur in the family.
   Roberts insists he had said Bambi, and Mrs. Martin backs him up.
The Congressional Record conceded the error.
   During lunch that day, Mrs. Martin explained, she had told
Roberts that ``Bambi'' was one of her favorite movies.
   Roberts is known for his colorful oratory. A defender of his
rural constituents, he once remarked that if then-President
Reagan's plane flew too low over Kansas it would get a ``pitchfork
in the belly'' in retaliation for unpopular farm policy.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Arguments in Swaggart Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart is no
charlatan and his ministry's sales of religious merchandise should
be tax-exempt, the Supreme Court was told Tuesday.
   ``This ministry is not in the business to make money. The
purpose of all of this is to spread the gospel,'' Chicago lawyer
Michael McConnell told the justices.
   ``Now, all of us can be cynical, and with good purpose,''
McConnell said in alluding to televangelist Jim Bakker's recent
criminal conviction. But McConnell said such taxation must be
prohibited ``unless we are to say that all religious leaders are
charlatans.''
   ``With religious organizations, the requirement of the
Constitution is for the government to keep its hands off,'' he said.
   McConnell's comments came after Justice John Paul Stevens,
focusing on the sale of a tape-recorded sermon, asked how to
distinguish a commercial sale from a religious activity.
   The key question, McConnell responded, must be: ``Is it to
spread the word or make a buck?''
   Justice Thurgood Marshall then asked in an incredulous tone
about the Swaggart ministry: ``They weren't interested in a buck?''
   ``The people involved draw substantial salaries, and those
salaries stem from the sales'' of tapes, books and other
merchandise, Marshall said.
   But McConnell said Swaggart's annual salary for the tax years at
issue in his ministry's dispute with California tax officials never
exceeded $20,000.
   The nation's highest court is to decide by July whether
California's sales and use tax, imposed on ``retailers'' for the
privilege of selling tangible goods in the state, must make an
exception for religious items sold by religious groups.
   California court rulings forced Swaggart's ministry to pay the
state $183,000 in back taxes and interest for 1974 through 1981.
   McConnell attacked the tax as a violation of religious freedom
and due process, and an undue interference with interstate commerce.
   ``A religious organization carrying out its religious function
cannot be the occasion for fund-raising by the state,'' McConnell
contended.
   He said the First Amendment, which ensures ``the free exercise''
of religion, bars such taxation.
   California Deputy Attorney General Richard Nielsen argued that
taxing sales made by Swaggart's ministry ``does not conflict with
any asserted belief of Mr. Swaggart.''
   ``Swaggart is using the free-exercise clause as a sword'' in
fighting for special treatment, Nielsen said.
   The justices were told that California is the only state
imposing such taxes on religious organizations. But if the tax is
upheld, other states would be free to do the same.
   Both lawyers were peppered with questions from the bench, most
frequently by Stevens and Justices Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day
O'Connor.
   Scalia challenged McConnell's assertion that the tax unduly
interferes with religious affairs. If the government may station a
police officer outside a church on Sunday to direct traffic, ``why
can't the government impose a non-discriminatory tax?'' he asked.
   O'Connor asked several questions focusing on how great a burden
is created by the 6 percent state tax.
   For the years at issue, mail-order sales from Swaggart's base in
Baton Rouge, La., to California consumers totaled $1.7 million.
Sales of merchandise at California crusades totaled $240,000.
   The case is Jimmy Swaggart Ministries vs. Board of Equalization,
88-1374.

   Voters decide on a governor and the makeup
of the Legislature's lower house Nov. 7, shaping New Jersey's
political power base in a race similar to one that landed the state
before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1983.
   The next Assembly and the current state Senate will redraw the
state's congressional districts in line with the population changes
found in the 1990 census.
   ``As long as the Legislature insists on retaining the power to
redraw districts, it's an additional prize to be won by whatever
party can control the majority,'' said Ed McCool, chairman of New
Jersey Common Cause.
   The Democrats, who already have majority status in the Senate,
are confident that this election will bring them the Assembly and
the governor's office and leave the Republicans empty-handed when
the districts are drawn.
   But if that happens, and the Democrats are too blatant about
drawing the lines for partisan advantage, they can count on finding
the map just where it was last time around _ in court.
   New Jersey's changes after the 1980 census, described by
Congressional Quarterly as a ``four-star gerrymander,'' were
overturned by the Supreme Court in 1983. The high court said the
districts varied too greatly in population to uphold the equal
representation principle.
   The replacement map, still in use today, was drawn by a federal
court and approved by the Supreme Court in 1984.
   Assemblyman Robert Franks, a former state GOP committee
chairman, says the Democrats' suspect intentions are demonstrated
by the Senate's refusal to pass GOP-sponsored reform bills that
have passed a Republican-controlled Assembly.
   The proposals call for getting redistricting out of the
Legislature and appointing a bipartisan commission to draw the
lines, the way state legislative districts are now devised.
   With the current Senate in place until 1992, the Democrats
``know they're going to be in power during the congressional
map-making process,'' Franks said. ``They've obviously been hoping
a Democratic Assembly and governor would be elected and (allow
them) to put partisan politics ahead of public interest.''
   The plan drawn by the Democratic-controlled Legislature and
signed by Democratic Gov. Brendan T. Byrne hours before he left
office in 1982 looked more like doodles than a congressional
district map.
   Many of the contorted shapes spawned nicknames, such as The
Flying Duck in northern New Jersey and The Bunny in the central
part of the state.
   A shape dubbed The Fish Hook survived the court's rewriting. It
includes a thin ribbon hugging the shore at Monmouth County. The
boundary comes so close to the water that a judge once joked that
the district was contiguous _ as required by federal law _ only at
low tide.
   Besides getting to slice the pie, the Legislature this time
might have one less piece to cut. Under the complicated process
that determines a state's number of seats, New Jersey could find
its delegation shrinking from 14 to 13.
   Franks says he hasn't given up his fight to enact reforms before
the next exercise in redistricting. But barring unforeseen election
results Nov. 7, the Democrats are likely to find themselves with an
opportunity too good to refuse, observers say.
   ``I think it's safe to assume all legislators, by their
definition, would take the opportunity,'' McCool said. ``They would
call it taking care of their side.''

   The Basilica of Guadalupe echoed with
applause Tuesday as thousands of mourners gave a final round of
applause to singer Pedro Vargas, whose rich tenor serenaded fans
from cabarets to Carnegie Hall for 60 years.
   The basilica, which holds over 5,000 people, was jammed and
thousands more gathered outside during the standing-room-only Mass.
Vargas, 85, died in his sleep of heart failure Monday. He was
cremated Tuesday after the funeral Mass at the basilica, which is
the shrine of Mexico's patron saint.
   The music of Vargas, one of Mexico's biggest stars, helped
define an era of popular culture and reached an audience of
millions worldwide. Among his fans was President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, who paid his respects by standing in an honor guard at the
casket during Vargas' wake Monday night.
   Vargas' songs evoked ``all the emotions that throb in the hearts
of Mexicans,'' Salinas said. Also in the honor guard was the film
star Cantinflas.
   ``He was one of a very few who brought renown to Mexico in the
musical world,'' said Cantinflas, whose real name is Mario Moreno.
``He was an example to all.''
   Vargas, known as the ``tenor of the Americas,'' made scores of
films during the golden age of Mexican movies, in the 1930s and
'40s. His recording career spanned the era of 78-rpm records to the
compact disc.
   He sang at the White House for Presidents Roosevelt and Truman,
performed at Carnegie Hall and Madison Square Garden and counted
Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. among his friends along with the
major stars of the Spanish-speaking world.
   Vargas' collaboration with composer Agustin Lara was regarded as
one of Latin America's noted musical partnerships. Together they
popularized the bolero and the paso doble, a lively Spanish
two-step.
   Born in 1904, Vargas first began singing in high school. He was
a shy child whose parents hoped he would enter the priesthood.
Instead he had a fling with bullfighting, then studied medicine for
a time before turning to music.
   His hits included the songs ``Bolero,'' ``Grenada''
``Fleur-de-Lis'' and ``Woman,'' but one of his best-known was the
life-affirming ``Gracias a la Vida,'' which goes:
   ``Thanks to life which has given me so much
   ``Which has given me two eyes that, when I open them,
   ``Distinguish perfectly between the black and the white.''
   The shrine rang with applause as the service ended and Pedro,
Mario and Alejandro, three of Vargas' five sons, carried his casket
outside, holding it aloft in a sea of mourners that filled the huge
plaza.

   The strangulation deaths of five women
in the same midtown area have police investigating whether a serial
killer is at work, although police say it's too early to tell if
one person is responsible.
   The victims all were found in an area not considered a
high-crime area, said police spokesman Sgt. Greg Mills. All were
black and were found either nude or partly nude.
   Janice Berryman, 36, became the fifth victim when her body was
found Saturday in thick brush in a park. The first victim was found
Sept. 16.
   The women did not live in the immediate area where the bodies
were found, Mills said Tuesday.
   Two of the women had been involved in prostitution but three of
them had not been, he said. A dozen detectives have been assigned
to the slayings, Mills said.
   ``We need to track down their past activities and associates and
see if the friends and habits of these women cross each other,'' he
said.
   Investigators won't say whether the women were sexually
assaulted or whether the victims were believed to have been killed
where they were found.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's shipboard summit with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev responds to pressure to deal more
forcefully with upheaval in the communist world. It also provides
an opportunity to support Perestroika with more than kind words.
   Gorbachev reacted positively, and no wonder. The Soviet leader
also faces political and economic pressures a summit could ease.
   There are risks in the unstructured two-day session in the
Mediterranean next month with the disarming and nimble Kremlin
chief. But the president insisted Tuesday that no agenda was needed.
   ``It's a chance to put our feet up and talk,'' Bush said of the
plans for the unexpected meeting with Gorbachev Dec. 2 and 3 aboard
U.S. and Soviet naval vessels.
   That free-form approach was reminiscent of the meeting three
years ago in Iceland between Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev. The two
leaders wound up in a breathtaking joust over who would be willing
to go further toward banishing nuclear weapons _ all of them _ and
the summit collapsed in discord.
   Even so, Bush is willing to gamble. And there are potential
political and economic benefits for both leaders.
   The Soviets would like U.S. trade credits, membership in world
lending institutions and a loosening of security restrictions on
Western technology.
   Bush, who so far has offered only vague best wishes for
Gorbachev's success, could respond with a lowering of trade
barriers that he has made conditional on new emigration legislation
and further easing of limits on sales of some types of computers.
   While risky, this summit born in secrecy is an opportunity for
Bush to cope with an image that has dogged him over more than a
quarter-century in politics, that he is reluctant to assume command.
   ``Timid'' is the word his critics use. ``Wimp'' was the crueler
term that surfaced in the presidential campaign.
   On foreign policy fronts, Bush has been unable to talk Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega out of power in Panama _ and unwilling to
use force to unseat him _ and prospects for Arab-Israeli
negotiations remain dim.
   Gorbachev could stand some international event to boost his
stock, as well.
   His prodigious perestroika program has not improved the people's
lot, while several of the nationalities bound together in the
U.S.S.R. are straining against the system and threatening to break
out.
   Hungary's attachment to the Warsaw Pact could be weakening.
Criticism of Gorbachev from more avid reformers like Boris Yeltsin
has become commonplace.
   As it turned out, Bush had broached the initiative in a letter
to Gorbachev in July while insisting all along in public he would
not be ``stampeded'' into a unprepared summit meeting.
   In his best laid-back style, Bush had said ``there will,
obviously, at some point be a meeting. But I still feel I'd like
the meeting to be seen as productive rather than just the meeting
itself.''
   These reservations have been quietly cast aside by both leaders.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze were instructed to set up the meeting even
as they worked on a more formal superpower summit to be held in
late spring or early summer. That one will be focused on arms
control.
   Amid all the secret diplomacy, withheld from most State
Department officials, Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell
of Maine was accusing the administration of not engaging Gorbachev,
of failing to encourage change in Eastern Europe.
   The NATO allies, led by West Germany, quietly have urged the
administration to be more responsive to Gorbachev's initiatives in
order to reduce tensions in Western Europe. Perestroika is also
good for business, and the West Europeans and Japan are way ahead
of the United States in pursuing business deals in the East.
   Bush finally responded while announcing the Mediterranean
session. ``In this time of change,'' he said, ``I don't want to
have two gigantic ships pass in the night because of failed
communications.''
   That is what Mitchell had feared was happening as Bush responded
last summer to revolutionary change in Poland and Hungary with a
modest _ and since improved _ aid package and expressing of
good-wishes to Gorbachev on perestroika.
   ``What we have demanded for over four decades is beginning to
occur,'' Mitchell said in a Senate speech Sept. 18. ``This is
unquestionably a triumph for the United States. Now is the time for
the United States to encourage and capitalize upon the changes we
have sought for so long.''
   But doubts were raised within the Bush administration.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger cautioned in a
Georgetown University speech on Sept. 15 that Gorbachev was no
anti-communist. ``He intends to make the Soviet Union as strong as
he possibly can,'' Eagleburger said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney were
other outspoken administration skeptics. Robert M. Gates, the
President's deputy national security assistant, was ready last week
to offer another pessimistic appraisal _ until Secretary of State
James A. Baker III quashed the speech.
   By then, Baker had made a landmark address to the private
Foreign Policy Association in New York on Oct. 16 saying the
administration was prepared to provide Moscow with advice and
technical assistance.
   That speech by the president's close friend and political and
foreign policy adviser marked the fact the debate within the
administration essentially was over.
   The shipboard meeting may answer the next question of how far
the president is willing to go to assist the nation that has been a
Cold War adversary for more than a generation.

   The head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration on Tuesday praised Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari for revitalizing his government's efforts to curb
cross-border drug smuggling.
   John C. Lawn said Mexico has hired more people for the anti-drug
effort and expanded the country's aerial crop eradication
capabilities since Salinas took office 11 months ago.
   He also noted that a number of suspected Mexican drug barons
have been arrested this year.
   ``We've seen a substantial change in law enforcement efforts,''
Lawn said. ``Anti-drug efforts are a major priority (in Mexico).''
   Lawn took part in a panel discussion on the narcotics issue at
the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group.
   Javier Trevino, a minister-counselor at the Mexican Embassy,
said that a 23-ton seizure of cocaine by Mexican authorities
several months ago meant that 373 million doses of the drug never
reached U.S. markets.
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III stressed the need for a
continuing effort to reduce drug demand in the United States. He
said surveys indicate the number of narcotics users in the country
dropped by 30 per cent between 1985 and 1988.
   Meese cautioned, however, that despite dramatic drug seizures by
authorities in the United States and Mexico, there is a ``drug
glut'' in U.S. markets. This has resulted in declining prices for
high potency drugs.
   Meese also criticized those who persistently find fault with
Mexico's record on drug enforcement. He said this ``constant
Mexico-bashing must stop,'' calling it ``demeaning, ineffective and
counter-productive.''
   Meese mentioned no names but the most prominent critic of Mexico
on Capitol Hill is Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who maintains that the
country's law enforcement effort is riddled with corruption.

   A court found 12 people guilty of first-degree
murder in the summer riots that convulsed the Uzbekistan republic
and sentenced two of them to execution by firing squad, the Tass
news agency said Tuesday.
   The 12 were convicted of hunting down four Meskhetian Turks who
tried to flee rioting in late May and early June that killed 100
people.
   Prosecutors charged the 12 with beating the four, burning their
car and leaving them tied up in field overnight, then dousing them
the next day with gasoline and setting them on fire.
   They also were convicted of robbery, malicious hooliganism and
other crimes, the report said.
   Two defendants who Tass identified only as Parpiyev and
Dzahurayev will be shot by firing squad. The other 10 were
sentenced to long jail terms, Tass said. The news agency gave no
indication when the executions would be carried out.
   Defendants included a deputy director of a school, a vocational
school teacher and farm and factory workers, Tass said.
   Meskhetian Turks were forcibly resettled in the Fergana Valley
of eastern Uzbekistan, a republic of Soviet Central Asia, by Josef
Stalin from their native republic of Georgia.
   Thousands of them were forced to flee their homes in the Fergana
Valley because of the rioting and many have been resettled at farms
and in villages throughout the country.
   Some have blamed the rioting on overcrowding and unemployment in
the valley. Others have blamed it on Uzbek nationalists.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of workers marched
Tuesday in support of 200 teachers who are on hunger strike for a
pay increase, and the government responded by ordering schools
closed for a week.
   It is the first major confrontation between labor and President
Jaime Paz Zamora, who took office Aug. 6. The Bolivian Workers
Central organized the march to back the teachers and oppose
government austerity measures.
   Education takes 18 percent of the Bolivian budget and average
pay for teachers is equivalent to $76 a month. They demanded a 15
percent salary increase and bonuses equal to a month's pay.
   Teachers in this landlocked country in the midsection of South
America asked for a raise of 330 percent initially, but backed down
after the government said there would be no pay increase this year.
   The government says paying teachers more would spur inflation
and it does not have the resources for either a bonus or a raise.
   About 200 teachers and leaders of their union started the hunger
strike last week to press pay demands. Thousands of students
supported them with a demonstration Monday, but police dispersed it
with tear gas after some protesters threw rocks at the Education
Ministry building.
   Private schools closed Tuesday and planned to remain shut on
Wednesday. The ministry said public schools would reopen for exams
Nov. 8 if circumstances permitted.
   Bolivia, an impoverished country of 6.9 million residents, has
become one of South America's most expensive countries for many
staple items. The prices of dairy products and meat are comparable
to those in the United States and Europe.
   Paz is continuing austerity measures, including a wage freeze
and lower government spending, introduced by the previous
government to combat a 1985 annual inflation rate of 24,000 percent.
   Annual inflation has dropped to 12 percent and the economy is
expected to grow by 2.5 percent in 1989 after years of decline.

<HEAD>Pollution Clogging Nation's Lakes, EPA Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pollution is clogging one-fourth of the lakes
examined in the latest government survey and more will soon meet a
similar fate if pollution trends continue, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   The EPA's latest survey of lake water quality covering lakes in
32 states shows that serious pollution problems have impaired more
3 million of the 12 million acres of lake area examined. Another 20
percent of the acres of water examined soon will be threatened with
impairment.
   According to the EPA, water is considered impaired if it no
longer can be used for its intended purpose _ such as swimming or
fishing in some cases _ because of pollution.
   The EPA said that in 76 percent of the cases, lake pollution was
caused by agricultural or urban runoffs, while in 11 percent of the
cases the pollution was attributed to industrial or sewage
releases. In the remaining cases, the culprit was naturally caused
pollution.
   The most significant cause of lake impairment was reported to be
excessive plant and algae growth as a result of the release into
the waters of high levels of nutrients. Often those releases came
from sewage facilities or agricultural runoffs, the study said.
   The unwanted plant and algae growth often impedes recreational
activity and reduces a lake's scenic value. More importantly, it
also depletes the lake of necessary oxygen, choking off fish and
other parts of the lake's ecosystem, said Erik Olson, an attorney
with the National Wildlife Federation.
   Olson said that while the EPA findings were a matter of concern,
they understated the true problem with water pollution nationwide
because not all pollutants that affect water quality are included.
   ``If you consider all the pollutants that have potentially
devastating effects on fish and wildlife, perhaps on people as
well, the number (of impaired lake acres) would be significantly
higher,'' he said.
   EPA officials acknowledged that the degree of lake pollution has
been difficult to document nationally because of shortcomings in
data collection.
   For example, the latest report on lake quality, which was
required for submission to Congress, did not include data from 16
states because they did not report. It also did not include data
from the Great Lakes, the country's biggest lake system that has
had major pollution problems.
   About one-fourth of the pollution was attributed to excessive
nutrients or other sources of organic enrichment being put into the
water, often from sewage or agricultural runoffs.
   Other causes of damage are high levels of sediment from rocks
and soil being deposited into lakes, warm water discharges that
disturb fish habitat and the release of pesticides and other
toxics. According to the report, 15 percent of the pollution
problem on the lakes examined was attributed to metals and
inorganics and another 3 percent to pesticides.
   The study reflected lake water quality studies in 32 states,
Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia where more than 18 million
lake acres were reported. Of these, 12.4 million acres were
actually assessed and 45 percent were determined to be either
impaired or threatened with impairment.
   The study did not include any of the Great Lakes, although
several of the states that border those lakes were among the states
included in the report.

   Investigators have concluded that sheets of the
explosive penthrite packed in a suitcase were used to blow up a
Paris-bound flight over a Niger desert on Sept. 19, the newspaper
Le Figaro reported Tuesday.
   Le Figaro, without citing sources, said the discovery enabled
authorities to link the attack to the Palestinian group Arab
Organization of May 15.
   It said a similar bomb was used on Feb. 23, 1985, in an attack
on the Marks &amp; Spencer department store in Paris that killed one
person and wounded 14, and that the May 15 group was believed
responsible for that attack.
   The airliner bombing killed all 171 people aboard. The French
airline UTA Flight 772 from Brazzaville, Congo, to Paris exploded
over Niger about an hour after taking off from N'Djamena, Chad,
following a stopover there.
   Le Figaro said investigators were able to determine that the
suitcase bomb was placed in the baggage container loaded onto the
plane at Brazzaville.
   Previous French news reports said traces of penthrite were found
in the wreckage.
   On Tuesday, the Transport Ministry issued a preliminary report
of the joint France-Niger commission of inquiry into the crash
saying an explosion must have caused the disaster. It said analysis
found ``strong traces of an explosive material'' in the debris, but
did not specify the explosive or speculate who might have put it on
board.
   The May 15 group, named for the date the 1948 Arab-Israeli war
began, is led by a man whose war name is Abu Ibrahim. It has been
held responsible for bombings or attempted bombings aboard airlines
or at airline offices.
   Le Figaro suggested the group was probably acting on behalf of
the extremist Lebanese Shiite Moslem organization Hezbollah, which
was angered by French support for the Maronite Christian side in
Lebanon's civil war.

<HEAD>House Sends Bush Bill Raising FHA Loan Limits</HEAD>

   Home buyers would be able to obtain
government-insured mortgages for more expensive homes under
legislation Congress sent President Bush on Tuesday.
   On a voice vote and with no debate, the House in a matter of
moments gave final legislative approval to a spending bill that
included the mortgage provision.
   The measure boosts from $101,250 to $124,875 the cap on
mortgages that can be insured by the Federal Housing Administration
in most of the country's high-cost housing markets.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America estimated that the
higher cap, which will last one year, would allow 100,000
additional families to buy homes with FHA-backed loans.
   When the government insures a home loan, the bank issuing that
loan _ facing a lower risk _ can offer lower interest rates and
downpayments. FHA-backed loans account for 900,000 home purchases
each year.
   Opponents of the higher loan cap have argued that with the FHA
having lost $4.2 billion last year from its various reserve funds,
according to a congressional report, now is the wrong time to
increase the agency's loan activities.
   Supporters pointed to the greater number of families that would
benefit from the higher limits, and argued that the increased loan
activity would reap the government about $104 million in fees paid
by borrowers.
   The bill was approved Friday by the Senate, two days after the
House voted to change it by lowering the total on the loans the FHA
can insure this year from $74 billion to $57 billion. The Senate
restored the higher sum, and the House accepted that revision
Tuesday and sent the measure to the White House.
   The spending bill provides $67 billion for housing, veterans,
space and other programs for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The measure includes:
   _$12.4 billion for NASA, including $1.8 billion for the proposed
space station.
   _$5.6 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency, including
$1.5 billion for the Superfund hazardous waste cleanup program.
   _$11.4 billion for veterans health care.
   _$15.1 billion for housing programs.

   Farmers are lobbying for governmental
disaster loans and other aid to help recoup earthquake damage that
could reach as much as $20 million in Santa Cruz County alone.
   ``There are no low-interest loans available to help growers
rebuild and we are working to find out why,'' said Steve Siri,
president of the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau.
   ``Agriculture has been forgotten after the quake,'' Siri said.
``I know a lot of growers who are on their knees right now. You can
see their suffering in their faces.''
   Early damage estimates by the University of California Extension
Service placed countywide agricultural damage at at least $9.8
million. Agricultural officials in the surrounding couties of Santa
Clara, Monterey and San Benito said they did not have estimates on
agricultural damage but all agreed that Santa Cruz County was
hardest hit.
   The $9.8 million figure is expected to more than double, said
Siri. ``That early estimate included only about 40 percent of the
farming business in the county,'' he said.
   The estimate included crops lost and structures damaged by the
Oct. 17 quake that registered 7.1 on the Richter scale.
   Agriculture is among the county's top revenue producers,
grossing about $168 million annually, Siri said. The bureau has
about 1,100 members countywide, mostly small farmers who work 50
acres and less.
   ``We probably won't see most of the damage until the spring,
when we're able to inspect the pipelines and wells,'' he said.
   Among those who suffered especially heavy losses was the A.
Nagamine Nursery in Watsonville, Siri said.
   The quake leveled a one-acre greenhouse containing miniature
pink carnations and an equal number were threatened when they were
exposed to the cold.
   ``This could be a big loss for us,'' said owner Roy Nagamine.
``These plants would have been ready for Valentine's Day.'' He
estimated his losses could reach $1 million.
   Apple growers also were hard-hit when the quake shook fruit off
trees, tossed and bruised already picked fruit and damaged
cold-storage facilities, Siri said.
   ``With the Alar scare, they certainly didn't need this,'' he
said, referring to the recent national concern about use of the
chemical Alar on apples. Siri said although it's not used in Santa
Cruz County, growers suffered when consumers stopped buying apples.
   Luckily, the quake came at the end of the season for lettuce and
strawberry growers, causing those important crops only minimal
damage, he said.
   Siri said he isn't worried the quake will have a permanent
effect on labor. Early reports said many farmworkers had moved back
to Mexico because they had been frightened by the temblor.
   ``We normally have a migration at this time of the year,'' he
said. ``This may have speeded up the process; some growers reported
they lost some of their workers early this year.
   ``But I'm confident they will return next season.''

<HEAD>Auditors Examining Records of Energy Official's Expenses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal auditors are examining records of
expenses _ including $374 for a torn blouse _ billed to the
government by Martha Hesse, chairwoman of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, a commission spokesman said Tuesday.
   The inspector general's office at the Energy Department began
reviewing the documents early last week, said Ron Harris, a
spokesman for the commission. The five-member commission falls
under the Energy Department's responsibilities.
   Judy DeMaire, executive director of the inspector general's
office, said that as a matter of policy she could neither confirm
nor deny the existence of an investigation of Hesse's expenses.
   Harris said the auditors were supplied with commission documents
on Mrs. Hesse's official travel expenses as well as spending
related to security precautions taken by the government in response
to alleged personal threats against Mrs. Hesse.
   Harris said there had been no allegations of wrongdoing. He said
he did not know what triggered the inspector general's interest in
Mrs. Hesse's official expenses.
   ``Everything was approved, everything was legal,'' he said.
   The inspector general's inquiry was first reported in Monday's
editions of the weekly publication Legal Times. It reported that
among other personal charges billed to the government by Mrs. Hesse
was $374 to replace a $535 blouse she ripped while on the job.
   The Legal Times also cited commission documents indicating that
Mrs. Hesse had taken 11 foreign trips as commission chairman since
1987, and that so far this year she had made at least 19 trips
domestically. It said the foreign trips cost the government $28,000.
   Harris said Mrs. Hesse would not respond to the Legal Times
story. He said all the reported trips were ordinary speaking
engagements that Mrs. Hesse accepted as a spokeswoman for federal
regulation of U.S. energy and power industries.
   Harris acknowledged that Mrs. Hesse has traveled more frequently
than her predecessors. He said it was ``just her style'' to keep a
heavier schedule of public speaking.
   The Legal Times also reported that the government paid $3,825
for a home security system and $3,090 for a cellular phone for Mrs.
Hesse's use. It said the equipment was deemed necessary in light of
allegations that her former government chauffer threatened her
numerous times after being removed from his job in 1988.
   Harris said the security system and the phone were
``preapproved'' costs and that it was understood from the start
that the equipment would be returned to the government when Mrs.
Hesse leaves the commission.
   The Legal Times also reported that the government picked up the
bill for $4,270 in repairs to Mrs. Hesse's Porsche automobile,
which allegedly was vandalized in the commission's parking garage
by the former chauffer accused of threatening Mrs. Hesse.
   Mrs. Hesse announced earlier this month that she planned to quit
the commission at the start of 1990 to become senior vice president
for corporate affairs at First Chicago Corp., a major banking
organization. Her term expires in October 1991.
   Mrs. Hesse has been chairman of the commission since Oct. 6,
1986. Before that she was assistant secretary for management and
administration at the Energy Department.

   President Bush's rendezvous with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbechev on the Mediterranean Sea will not be the first
time a U.S. president has taken to shipboard diplomacy.
   Franklin Delano Roosevelt joined British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill in 1941 off the Newfoundland coast to draw up the
Atlantic Charter, proclaiming freedom of the seas and leading to
the arming of U.S. merchant ships.
   They met aboard the United States cruiser August and the British
battleship Prince of Wales, in August 1941, five months before the
United States entered World War II.
   Presidents Richard Nixon and Harry Truman also put the
presidential yacht Sequoia to diplomatic use. Nixon hosted Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev on board and Truman held the first
international conference on nuclear arms control on the yacht.
   Bush and the Kremlin announced Tuesday that the U.S.-Soviet
meeting will occur Dec. 2-3 aboard Naval ships in the Mediterranean.
   The White House said it was not yet clear exactly where on the
sea the ships would go for the summit.

   Hundreds of nationalists in the Caucasus republic
of Georgia on Tuesday began a protest against Soviet power in front
of the main government buildings in Tbilisi, an activist source
said.
   David Nadiradze said in a telephone interview from the Georgian
capital that more than 200 people had begun a sit-down strike in
front of the buildings where 19 demonstrators were killed on April
9 in a charge by soldiers.
   The demonstrators were surrounded by several thousand people who
were trying to ensure their safety, Nadiradze said.
   The crowd had broken through a fence erected around the
government buildings on Rustaveli Prospekt on Sunday, he said,
adding that only a handful of police were present.
   Nadiradze said the demonstrators were protesting the drafting of
Georgian youths into the Soviet Army, the incorporation of Georgia
into the Soviet Union in 1921 and unrest among the republic's
Abkhazian minority that they say is being fomented by Moscow to
destabilize the republic.
   The protest was organized by the National Democratic Party, the
Party of National Independence and other Georgian nationalist
groups, he said.

   President Bush announced Tuesday he will hold
a shipboard summit in the Mediterranean with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev Dec. 2 and 3 ``to put up our feet and talk''
informally prior to a full-blown superpower meeting next year.
   Bush described the weekend meeting as an open-ended discussion
with no fixed agenda. He said neither he nor Gorbachev ``anticipate
that substantial decisions or agreements will emerge'' on arms
control or other matters.
   The talks will take place on U.S. and Soviet naval ships on
alternate days. The precise location was not announced, but a site
off Italy appeared likely since Gorbachev is to visit there from
Nov. 29 to Dec. 1.
   Bush acknowledged he originally had opposed the concept of a
get-acquainted session, favoring instead a well-planned meeting
with assurances of concrete results.
   However, he decided that with dramatic democratic changes
sweeping across Eastern Europe, the leaders of the two superpowers
``should deepen our understanding'' of each other.
   ``I don't want to have two gigantic ships pass in the night
because of failed communication,'' Bush said. ``I just didn't want
to _ in this time of dynamic change _ miss something, something
that I might get better firsthand from Mr. Gorbachev.''
   The president said he expected ``a lot of discussion'' about
Eastern Europe.
   Bush's announcement drew bipartisan applause on Capitol Hill,
although Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said he was not
about to rescind his criticism that the president's policies toward
the blossoming of democracy in Eastern Europe have been too
``timid.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the GOP's deputy leader, said, ``That
kind of stuff about being too timid or too cautious bounces off
George Bush like a .22-rifle bullet off a tank.''
   The summit was jointly announced in Washington and in Moscow,
where Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said the talks
between the two leaders were ``aimed at allowing them to know each
other better'' and would ``contribute to broadening the changes
taking place in the Soviet-American relationship.''
   Much of the planning appeared still to be done.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu, asked what country Bush
would use as the staging area for the talks, said, ``We don't know
yet.'' However, sources suggested that Naples, Italy, a major
seaport, was the most likely area.
   The sources, insisting on anonymity, also said the most likely
U.S. ship for the talks was the cruiser Belknap, the 547-foot long,
missile-armed flagship of the Sixth Fleet, based in the
Mediterranean. There was speculation Bush would make the ship his
headquarters and spend the night there.
   Officials said they did not know if first ladies Barbara Bush
and Raisa Gorbachev would accompany their husbands.
   Bush said he decided to meet on a ship so ``we can do it without
too much fanfare ... where there's a relatively few number of
people, not a lot of crush of bodies out there and a chance to put
our feet up and talk. ... I think it's easy logistically for both
sides.''
   It will not be the first shipboard summit.
   In August 1941, five months before the United States entered
World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt met with British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill aboard a battleship off
Newfoundland, Canada, and proclaimed an Atlantic Charter providing
for freedom of the seas and leading to the arming of merchant ships.
   It will be Bush's first meeting as president with Gorbachev,
although he participated in talks in Washington and New York with
the Soviet leader while serving as Ronald Reagan's vice president.
   Bush and Gorbachev have agreed to meet in late spring or early
summer to deal with major issues, and Bush said Tuesday he still
hopes to be able to sign a treaty then to reduce strategic nuclear
weapons.
   The December meeting gives Bush a defense against Democratic
charges that he has been slow to respond to initiatives from
Gorbachev and to the striking changes under way in the Soviet Union
and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev, meanwhile, is under
pressure to demonstrate that his program of economic restructuring
can improve the lives of ordinary Soviet citizens.
   Asked if the meeting would give Gorbachev a boost at home, Bush
said, ``I hadn't particularly thought about that. If it does,
fine.''
   And would it help Bush? ``That's not why we're doing it, but if
that should be the fallout, so be it,'' he replied.
   Bush and other White House officials said the meeting had been
secretly in the works since the president, returning from a trip to
Poland and Hungary and the seven-nation economic summit in Paris,
wrote a letter to Gorbachev on Air Force One July 18 on the flight
back to Washington.
   Bush was moved to action by appeals he heard during the trip
from leaders in Poland and Hungary, a senior administration
official said.
   ``They were urging him to be supportive of General Secretary
Gorbachev and his efforts to reform his own country and in his
efforts to release some of the bonds on their countries,'' said the
official, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   The official said Gorbachev responded affirmatively to the
invitation in early August and planning got seriously under way.
However, officials did not want to announce an informal meeting
until an agreement had been reached for a more substantive meeting
next year, he said.

<HEAD>Bush May Consider Military Aid To Contras</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Tuesday he will review
U.S. policy toward Nicaragua, including the possibility of renewing
military aid to the Contra rebels, if President Daniel Ortega calls
off the cease-fire that has been in place for 19 months.
   At a news conference, Bush also escalated his criticism of
Ortega for suggesting at the hemispheric summit conference last
weekend in Costa Rica that he might respond to Contra military
attacks by suspending the March 1988 truce.
   ``I've never seen a meeting where all the participants were so
unanimously against all the outrages of one. And we're still
getting messages in here about the outrageous performance of Daniel
Ortega,'' he said.
   Asked whether he might consider asking Congress for a resumption
of military aid to the Contras if Ortega calls off the truce, Bush
said, ``I would re-evaluate this situation in a minute if the
cease-fire is broken.''
   Congress suspended military aid to the Contras a few weeks
before the cease-fire agreement was reached in early 1988. Bush has
abandoned use of the military option against the Sandinistas,
preferring instead economic and diplomatic pressure to try to
promote a democratic outcome there.
   Ortega was to announce a final decision Tuesday on whether to
suspend the cease-fire.
   Bush spoke a day after Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said threats by Ortega to call off the truce may be a prelude to
cancellation of national elections set for February in Nicaragua.
But Ortega has said the elections will take place ``war or no war.''
   The administration's belief that Ortega may be in trouble
politically at home is based partly on a recent poll, taken by the
Costa Rican affiliate of Gallup International, showing that Ortega
trails opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro by 40 percent to 29
percent.
   But some analysts regard such polling as not necessarily
reliable because of the difficulty in obtaining an accurate
sampling in a country consisting largely of a peasant population.
   Ortega contends the Contras have systematically violated the
cease-fire, leading to the deaths of more than 730 Sandinista
soldiers since it went into effect.
   But a senior State Department official who briefed reporters on
Monday, insisting on anonymity, said the Sandinista army has
conducted ``aggressive and continuing search-and-destroy operations
against resistance forces'' since the truce began.
   From May through September 1989, at least 105 rebels have been
killed in such operations, he said, adding that the Contra
casualties run about 15 to 20 a month since the truce went into
effect.
   The bulk of the Contras are stationed at camps in Honduras but
up to 3,000 remain inside Nicaragua.

people everyone is supposed to have heard of.
   Horowitz, a 57-year-old lawyer from Tuckahoe, won a contest
sponsored by the deli, which has restaurants in New York, Boston
and Los Angeles.
   The ``Sheldon Horowitz'' sandwich was chosen from among hundreds
of entries submitted from across the country and was concocted by
his wife.
   ``Because my husband is renowned for his honesty,'' wrote Gloria
Horowitz, ``this sandwich should be open-faced, revealing all the
beautiful truth of its contents.''
   The ingredients: Tongue, smoked turkey, lumpfish caviar, red
bell peppers, lettuce and mustard on pumpernickel bread.
   Sheldon is to take the first bite at a ceremony Wednesday at the

   Nobody fell down or got bit by a dog, so Antonacci had to

   ``And I was on schedule, by the way,'' he said. ``It makes me

   Don Bateman is the maintenance man with a

   When he became maintenance man for his hometown of Kellogg, the
city marshal's badge was part of the bargain.
   ``I never really wanted to be the marshal,'' said Bateman, 64.
``But that's part of the job description. I didn't think it would
take up much time at first.''
   Bateman, who has been on the job for nine years, spends a lot of
his time dealing with accidents along three steep stretches of road
leading into the town of 450 people. That is, when he's not working
on the sewers.
   ``I get called out a lot, for every wreck,'' he said. ``A lot on
Saturday and Sunday, mostly after 2 a.m. when the bars close.
That's when you start to have your fun.''
   The city gave Bateman a two-door, compact car with a blue bubble
light on the roof for patrol duties. And he even has a desk at City
Hall.
   ``It's mostly just keeping the peace and quiet,'' Bateman said.
``When neighbors get to squabbling, that's the worst thing in the
world. A lot of them will turn on you when they get real mad.''

Claims</HEAD>

   Northwest Airlines settled the remaining lawsuits
filed on behalf of 156 people killed in a 1987 crash, but claims
against the maker of the jetliner are being pursued, a federal
judge said Tuesday.
   Northwest and McDonnell Douglas Corp., which made the MD-80
aircraft, also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the
crash near Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
   Terms of the settlements for the remaining 145 lawsuits against
Northwest were not disclosed.
   A total of 157 lawsuits were filed on behalf of crash victims.
Eleven were settled earlier and one filed on behalf of a 5-month
fetus was dismissed.
   U.S. District Judge Julian A. Cook Jr. announced the settlements
as the jury trial was to begin Tuesday. He reset opening arguments
for Wednesday.
   Attorneys and family members and friends of the victims would
not comment on the settlement, abiding by a gag rule Cook imposed.
   The jury will resolve the claims against McDonnell Douglas,
Northwest's claim that a defect in the aircraft caused the crash,
and McDonnell Douglas' claim that the plane was improperly flown.
   Flight 255 crashed Aug. 16, 1987, on takeoff from Detroit for
Phoenix.
   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that Flight 255's
pilots failed to set the plane's wing flaps and slats properly for
takeoff and failed to make mandatory preflight checks that would
have detected the error.
   Also, a cockpit warning system failed to alert the pilots the
flaps and slats were not set for takeoff, the NTSB said.
   The only passenger who survived the crash was Cecelia Cichan,
then 4, of Tempe, Ariz., whose parents and brother died in the
crash. She now lives with relatives in Alabama.
   The judge rescheduled opening arguments after questioning jurors
about published reports about the settlements before they were
announced.
   Of the six jurors and six alternates, half had seen newspaper
headlines or heard broadcast reports indicating the case was
settled, and three more had been told by friends it was over, they
told Cook.
   Cook questioned jurors individually about the reports, asking if
they understood that plaintiffs could resolve claims against one
defendant and still pursue claims against another.
   ``I am satisfied that all of them can be and will be
impartial,'' he said.
   The jury is expected to hear up to six months of testimony in
determining liability in the Northwest-McDonnell Douglas cross
claims. They also will decide if, and to what degree, McDonnell
Douglas was to blame for the crash. Money damages would be
determined in later trials.

   Some Colombian drug traffickers have tried to
buy large shipments of guns in the United States, but most U.S.
weapons winding up in their hands were bought individually or in
small batches, federal firearms officials told a congressional
panel Tuesday.
   ``We know firearms are being purchased in the United States''
for the Colombian cocaine cartels, Phil A. Orsini of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms told the House Foreign Affairs
Committee's Task Force on International Narcotics Control.
   ``What we cannot determine is what percentage of the firearms
used by the cartels are from a U.S. source,'' said Orsini, who
heads the ATF's Firearms Enforcement Branch.
   Information from traces of guns seized in Colombia indicate that
drug traffickers have attempted to buy large numbers of guns from
undercover agents, but ``far more are trickling out a few at a
time,'' he said.
   Noting that there are 270,000 licensed gun dealers in the United
States, Orsini said the dealers ``inadvertently'' contribute
greatly to the drug traffickers' armaments, primarily through
small, legal sales to individuals who then smuggle the weapons to
Colombia.
   Asked by panel chairman Lawrence J. Smith, D-Fla., whether U.S.
gun dealers are involved in conspiracies to provide arms to the
drug traffickers, Orsini said, ``It would be naive to think it's
not going on to a certain extent.'' However, he said, ``We have not
seen any indication of widespread collusion.''
   Orsini refused to criticize the legality of individual gun sales
in the United States, prompting gun-control advocate Rep. Harry
Johnston, D-Fla., to say, ``I'm embarrassed for your organization
that you gave that answer.''
   In September, Colombian President Virgilio Barco and Justice
Minister Monica de Greiff asked the United States to curb gun
shipments to drug traffickers who declared ``total war'' on the
government after the crackdown began Aug. 18.
   In the past 10 weeks, drug traffickers have been blamed for many
shootings as well as 237 bombings that killed 33 people and injured
222.
   William P. Rosenblatt, assistant Customs commissioner for
enforcement, told the House panel of several seizures of weapons
heading for Colombia:
   _An investigation in March 1988 in West Palm Beach, Fla., led to
the arrest of David Candiotti and Carlos Enrique Gil, who allegedly
were negotiating with undercover Customs and ATF operatives to buy
for export to Colombia 100 pounds of C-4 explosives, 25 Mac-11
machine guns, 20 Colt AR-15 rifles, and five fully automatic M-60
machine guns.
   During the investigation, agents identified two previous
shipments of munitions, including 25 pounds of plastic explosives,
30 AR-15 rifles, five .50-caliber rifles, 25 silencers for Mac-11
machine pistols, two sniper rifles and night vision equipment,
Rosenblatt said. These items were exported via private aircraft
``and delivered to an individual alleged to be associated with the
Cali (Colombia) cartel,'' a rival to the Medellin cocaine cartel,
he said.
   _Customs inspectors at the Los Angeles International Airport on
April 29, 1988 discovered 16 hand grenades, four AR-15 rifles that
had been converted to fully automatic operation, six bullet-proof
vests and a pair of night vision goggles concealed in a large
air-conditioning unit destined for Cali aboard Avianca Airlines.
   ATF spokesman Jack Killorin said Monday that Customs officials
during the summer ``grabbed 37 rifles on an airplane going down to
Barranquilla, Colombia. We were able to run down those guns, lock
up some of the purchasers.''
   The ATF has been helping to trace guns seized in Colombia, and
wants to send agents to that country permanently to enhance the
effort. In an interview Monday, ATF Director Stephen E. Higgins
said, ``My understanding is the Colombia officials think that is a
good way to proceed.''
   Of the weapons traced, the gun of choice among Colombia's drug
traffickers appears to be the Colt AR-15 semiautomatic
assault-style rifle, but many other weapons also have turned up,
according to Killorin.
   The AR-15 was the most popular U.S.-made weapon similar to the
imported AK-47 and Uzi carbines that were banned from the United
States in the spring.
   Colt Industries Inc suspended retail sales of the AR-15 after
the Bush Administration imposed a temporary import suspension on
the foreign-made semiautomatic assault-style weapons in March.
Company spokesman Mike Dunn said that sales to U.S. government
agencies and law enforcement continue.

<HEAD>Court Hears Arguments on Corporate Donation Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Michigan law restricting political donations
by private corporations abridges their free-speech rights and gives
their foes an unfair advantage, a lawyer for the Michigan State
Chamber of Commerce told the Supreme Court Tuesday.
   But Michigan Solicitor General Louis J. Caruso defended the law,
saying wealthy corporations could dominate the political arena if
allowed to make direct contributions to candidates.
   The Chamber of Commerce filed suit seeking to have the state law
declared unconstitutional, and the case is likely to have a broad,
nationwide impact on the way campaigns for federal and state
offices are financed.
   The law, which carries a $10,000 fine, generally prohibits
corporations from spending in behalf of political candidates.
However, corporations may establish political action committees
that funnel voluntary contributions to candidates.
   Caruso drew a crossfire of sharp questions from Justices Antonin
Scalia and Anthony Kennedy challenging his contention that the
state has a compelling interest in limiting corporate participation
in politics.
   ``Why is there a great risk to the political process from
expenditures by a family owned corporation ... but if Donald Trump
wants to come in and spend all the money he likes, that would be no
problem?'' Scalia asked.
   ``I find it difficult to see what the evil being driven at is,''
he said later. ``Is the state going to be swept away by ads signed
by General Motors?''
   Caruso said the Supreme Court historically has given states
broad authority to regulate corporate political activity.
   ``The fact is that corporations have an unfair advantage in the
political marketplace,'' he said. ``The Chamber of Commerce can
have a serious impact on the political process.''
   Chamber lawyer Richard D. McLellan argued that ``both the
purpose and the activities of the Chamber of Commerce are
ideological.'' The chamber, he said, lobbies for specific
legislation and ballot initiatives and conducts public-education
campaigns in favor of its positions on the issues.
   McLellan said the state law is unfair because it exempts
unincorporated labor unions, the Michigan business community's top
political adversaries.
   The chamber in 1985 wanted to advertise in the Grand Rapids
Press supporting a Republican candidate for the state House of
Representatives. Fearing the ad would violate the law, the chamber
decided against running it and filed suit.
   A federal judge upheld the law, ruling that it applied to the
Michigan State Chamber of Commerce.
   But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the
decision, ruling that indirect expenditures by ``a non-traditional
corporation ... formed for essentially ideological purposes ... do
not pose the threat or appearance of corruption.''

   President Virgilio Barco pledged on
Tuesday that drug traffickers will not succeed in forcing the
government to grant them amnesty through the use of terrorism.
   Barco declared in a nationally broadcast speech, ``The Colombian
people will not accept reconciliation with those who have shown
they do not respect the most basic human rights.''
   He said the drug lords in the last few weeks had tried to gloss
over a violent terrorist campaign with proposals for peace talks
with the government.
   ``The government has rejected and will continue rejecting such
proposals,'' the president said.
   Barco and Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, head of the nation's
intelligence force, spoke at the headquarters of the Department of
Administrative Security at ceremonies commemorating the force's
36th anniversary.
   The president said the struggle against traffickers was
difficult because of ``the internationalization of their
activities, their complex organization and their enormous
resources.''
   Maza Marquez, who survived a May 31 bomb attack that killed
seven people in this capital, said traffickers have declared war on
the Colombian establishment at its highest level, but that this
nation would be victorious in its crusade against ``drug
trafficking's dark scourge.''
   Leaders of Colombi's most powerful cocaine cartel, based in
Medellin, have asked for peace talks five times the past two months.
   They offered to lay down their arms, end a terrorist bombing
campaign and abandon the drug business if the government will grant
them amnesty and stop extraditing traffickers to the United States.
   The Barco administration extradited five Colombians wanted for
trafficking after beginning its drug crackdown on Aug. 19, the day
after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan was assassinated. Galan, the leading
presidential candidate, was an outspoken foe of the drug traders.
   Traffickers responded with a renewed campaign of bombings and
assassinations. A judge, eight journalists and a leading leftist
politician were among 34 people killed in a two-month spasm of
violence by the drug runners.
   Bombs badly damaged two leading newspapers, El Espectador and
Vanguardia Liberal, which denounced traffickers.
   Three bombs and a hand grenade exploded Monday night in Bogota,
killing two people, including a policeman.

<HEAD>Boosting Fleet Of Amphibious Warfare Ships Would Cost $4.5 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's plan to increase its
fleet of amphibious warfare ships would cost about $4.5 billion _
not including annual operating costs of some $3 billion _ and leave
the Navy with an aging fleet, says a congressional report.
   The total price tag is consistent with money appropriated for
such ships in the past, the Congressional Budget Office said in a
study released this week. However, a shrinking defense budget and
competition from submarines and guided-missile destroyers for funds
may force the administration to consider other options.
   ``The most realistic choice might be to reduce the goal for
amphibious lift,'' the CBO said. ``Such a reduction in the goal
would be consistent with the arguments of critics who contend that
large amphibious assaults are obsolete.''
   The Navy currently operates 63 amphibious ships and meets about
88 percent of its goal of providing enough ships to transport
simultaneously 50,000 Marine Corps troops and large numbers of
vehicles, cargo, equipment and aircraft.
   The Navy and the Marine Corps contend that the fleet needs to be
increased in response to the cut in the number of U.S. military
bases overseas. An amphibious force can operate independently of
foreign bases.
   The administration, therefore, plans to buy three different
types of amphibious vessels from 1990 through 1994, including a $1
billion assault ship that can carry helicopters and jets.
   In addition, the administration revised its plans on retiring
ships after 30 years. Instead, ships would remain in the fleet
until they reach 35 years.
   The total cost for this plan is $4.5 billion, plus about $28
billion in operating costs over the next 10 years.
   The CBO, in its study titled, ``Moving the Marine Corps by Sea
in the 1990s,'' proposes three alternatives to the administration
plan, including selectively retiring some older vessels at a
savings of $1.2 billion or canceling the purchase of two new ships
and seven landing craft for $1.4 billion in savings.
   The third option involves forgoing the purchase of all new ships
_ five in total _ and 22 of the 48 landing craft the administration
has sought. The result would be savings of $3.6 billion in
procurement money and $600 million in operating costs.
   ``The resulting fleet would meet only between 66 percent and 79
percent of the administration's goal for amphibious shipping but
would still meet the needs of any amphibious operation conducted
since World War II,'' the CBO said.
   The study noted that the administration's current goal for
amphibious capability is larger than what has been needed in any
assault since World War II.
   In 1950, the landing at Inchon, South Korea involved about
19,500 Marines and a total force of about 25,000 troops. Since
then, none of the major events involving Marines has required more
than 1,700 soldiers.

   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was the highest rated
television show for the week ended Oct. 29 as the network's
earthquake-delayed World Series coverage took a nose dive in the
Nielsen report.
   The third baseball game between the San Francisco Giants and the
Oakland Athletics was in 18th place. The fourth game on Saturday,
in which the Athletics wrapped up the series in four straight, was
29th.
   ABC's Monday Night Football game between the Chicago Bears and
the Cleveland Browns did much better, finishing in ninth place.
   Two weeks before, the first two World Series games had put ABC
in first place, breaking NBC's 68 week-dominance of the network
ratings. The two games in the week ended Oct. 15 were near the
bottom of the top 20 shows. The second game was 16th and the first
game tied for 18th place. But the San Francisco Bay area earthquake
on Oct. 17 delayed the series.
   ABC ended the week close behind NBC in second place. NBC's
average in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey was 14.9. ABC was second
with 14.2 and CBS was third with 13.0. A rating is the percentage
of the nation's 92.1 million homes.
   ``Roseanne'' was first with NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and
``Cheers'' close beind. NBC had five shows in the Top 10, ABC three
and CBS two.
   Here's the Top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,''
NBC's ``Cheers,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' NBC's ``A Different World,''
CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' NBC's
``Golden Girls,'' ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' and NBC's ``In
the Heat of the Night.''
   ``Roseanne'' and ``The Wonder Years'' are on ABC's strongest
night, Tuesday. It opens with ``Who's the Boss?,'' in 13th place
this week. But the ratings drop after ``Roseanne'' with the new
comedy ``Chicken Soup,'' starring Jackie Mason. ``Chicken Soup''
was in 19th place this past week.
   Despite that, ``Chicken Soup'' is still the highest-rated new
show of the season. The next highest new show in the current period
is ABC's ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' in 25th. CBS' ``Major Dad'' in
36th place comes next.
   Johnny Carson's celebration of the 27th anniversary of ``The
Tonight Show'' placed 15th.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s highest-ranked show was ``Married...With
Children,'' in 39th place.
   ABC once again had the top-ranked evening news show. The
ratings: ABC 10.3, CBS 10.0 and NBC 9.6.
   The lowest-rated network show was CBS' ``Wolf.'' Here are the
bottom five network shows: ABC's Saturday World Series preview,
CBS' ``Saturday Night with Connie Chung,'' ABC's ``Ghostbusters''
Halloween special, CBS' ``Tour of Duty,'' and CBS' ``Wolf.''

   U.S. schools must attract more qualified
teachers and give them incentives to remain if every child is to
receive a complete education, a Senate hearing was told Tuesday.
   ``Teaching today is a profession in crisis,'' Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., said in setting the stage for the hearing before
his Committee on Labor and Human Resources.
   ``Teachers are faced with one of the most important, most
difficult, and most thankless jobs in the nation. Often today, in
addition to their responsibilities as educators, teachers must also
respond to the outside world that students bring into the classroom
_ crime in their neighborhoods, drugs in their hallways, the abuse
and neglect in their homes.''
   Kennedy and Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., have introduced two
bills to enhance teacher recruitment, training and professional
development.
   Linda Darling-Hammond, professor of education at Teachers
College, Columbia University, told the panel that recent statistics
place the demand for new teachers at just over 2 million between
1988 and 1995, while the supply is only about 135,000 each year or
``just over 1 million over the same time period.''
   Only about three-quarters of those who prepare to teach actually
enter teaching after graduation, and of those who do enter, about
half leave during their first five years.
   ``The reasons for teacher shortages are no mystery,'' said Ms.
Darling-Hammond, pointing to a decline in teacher salary by more
than 15 percent during the 1970s and a widening wage gap that
already existed between teachers and other college graduates.
   Recruiting minorities to teach is particularly difficult, said
Shirley McBay, dean for student affairs at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
   Demographic trends, she said, show that about 22 percent of all
Americans are members of a minority, and the best estimates
indicate that by about 2020, one-third of the U.S. population will
be American Indian, Asian, black or Hispanic.
   Ms. McBay said the American Association of Colleges for Teacher
Education estimates that just 5 percent of the teachers in the
present workforce are members of a minority and less than 8 percent
of the students in teachers education programs in 1987 were
minority.
   ``If the nation is to take seriously its duty to fully educate
every student, nothing short of a declaration of emergency will
suffice,'' said Beverly Caffee Glenn, dean of the Howard University
School of Education.

   President Bush said Tuesday he will review
U.S. policy toward Nicaragua, including the possibility of renewing
military aid to the Contra rebels, if President Daniel Ortega calls
off the cease-fire that has been in place for 19 months.
   At a news conference, Bush also renewed his criticism of Ortega
for suggesting at the hemispheric summit conference last weekend in
Costa Rica that he might respond to Contra military attacks by
suspending the March 1988 truce.
   ``I've never seen a meeting where all the participants were so
unanimously against all the outrages of one. And we're still
getting messages in here about the outrageous performance of Daniel
Ortega,'' he said.
   Asked whether he might consider asking Congress for a resumption
of military aid to the Contras if Ortega calls off the truce, Bush
said, ``I would re-evaluate this situation in a minute if the
cease-fire is broken.''
   Congress suspended military aid to the Contras a few weeks
before the cease-fire agreement was reached in early 1988. Bush has
abandoned use of the military option against the Sandinistas,
preferring instead economic and diplomatic pressure to try to
promote a democratic outcome there.
   Bush spoke a day after Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said threats by Ortega to call off the truce may be a prelude to
cancellation of national elections set for February in Nicaragua.
But Ortega has said the elections will take place, ``war or no
war.''
   The administration's belief that Ortega may be in trouble
politically at home is based partly on a recent poll, taken by the
Costa Rican affiliate of Gallup International, showing that Ortega
trails opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro by 40 per cent to 29
per cent.
   But some analysts regard such polling as not necessarily
reliable because of the difficulty in obtaining an accurate
sampling in a country consisting largely of a peasant population.
   Ortega contends the Contras have systematically violated the
cease-fire, leading to the deaths of more than 730 Sandinista
soldiers since it went into effect.
   But a senior State Department official who briefed reporters on
Monday, insisting on anonymity, said the Sandinista army has
conducted ``aggressive and continuing search-and-destroy operations
against resistance forces'' since the truce began.
   From May through September 1989, at least 105 rebels have been
killed in such operations, he said, adding that the Contra
casualties run about 15 to 20 a month since the truce went into
effect.
   The bulk of the Contras are stationed at camps in Honduras but
up to 3,000 remain inside Nicaragua.

   A top Bush administration official Tuesday
denied that there is a serious policy rift between the
administration and the Federal Reserve over efforts to push the
value of the dollar down to improve the country's trade balance.
   But the comments of Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford
weren't totally backed up by later statements from Federal Reserve
Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson.
   In testimony before a House Banking subcommittee, both men
sought to minimize differences between the administration and the
Fed.
   However, Johnson left no doubt that the central bank was still
concerned about fighting inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy
and gave that effort a much higher priority than the
administration's desire to see the dollar stabilized at a lower
value in order to boost U.S. exports.
   President Bush and other administration officials have made
various comments that they believed the Fed was overly concerned
about inflation and should be doing more to lower interest rates to
boost the U.S. economy.
   Lower interest rates not only stimulate domestic demand but also
serve to push the dollar's value lower because foreign investors do
not earn as much on their U.S. investments when U.S. interest rates
fall. These lower earnings serve to divert investments to other
countries where returns are relatively better, thus driving up
those currencies against the dollar.
   A lower dollar may help U.S. exports by making American products
cheaper in terms of other currencies and thus more competitive
overseas. By the same token, U.S. imports become more expensive.
   The Fed-administration debate was brought to a head following a
Sept. 23 announcment by the Group of Seven industrial nations that
they planned to cooperate jointly on the dollar and interest rate
policies in an effort to curb the dollar's rise this year.
   However, while interest rates were increased by both Japan and
West Germany, the Federal Reserve has not changed its interest-rate
policies even though the administration has been lobbying for such
a change.
   Mulford told the committee that he believed news reports of a
dispute between the Fed and the administration had been
``substantially overstated.''
   ``The consultations between the Treasury and the Fed has been
close and friendly,'' he said in response to questions about the
policy dispute.
   While the Banking panel had originally sought to have both
Mulford and Johnson testify and answer questions at the same time,
Johnson waited to testify until Mulford had finished his two-hour
appearance and left the room.
   In his testimomy, Johnson left no doubt that the central bank
still viewed fighting inflation as its No. 1 priority. He indicated
that efforts to push the dollar lower as a way of curing the
country's trade problems were doomed to failure as long as more
basic problems such as the huge U.S. budget deficit and America's
low savings rate were not addressed.
   ``There is little room for substantial further reduction in U.S.
(trade) deficits absent a significant reduction of the
saving-investment balance,'' he said.
   Many economists support Johnson's view, contending that the
country's trade problem is primarily caused by the fact that
American consumers have been on a consumption binge, buying more
than can be produced domestically.
   To correct this imbalance, the personal savings rate and the
U.S. budget deficit must both be cut to lower personal and
government consumption, these economists believe.
   There appeared to be a substantial split among members of the
committee over the long-term success of intervention in currency
markets, the process by which governments buy and sell currencies
on the open market in an attempt to influence their price.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, argued that with $400 billion in foreign
currencies being traded every day, any amounts of intervention by
central governments would have little long-term impact on the
markets.
   Mulford agreed with this, but he said that joint intervention
was still a useful exercise to demonstrate the resolve of the
United States and its major allies to work together in solving
trade imbalances and other economic problems.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., criticized the administration and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady for being too complacent about
the dollar's rise this year. He said that unless stronger efforts
were taken, backed by the Fed, then the country's trade deficit, as
measured by the current account, could well balloon to a record
$200 billion in a few short years.
   Mulford said that it was possible that the current account
deficit, which declined to $126.6 billion last year, may worsen
next year after two years of significant improvement.

   A Republican senator said Tuesday that a
number of liberal organizations are mobilizing ``to do a job on''
the nomination of Clarence Thomas as a federal appeals judge.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo. told lawmakers that Thomas ``has
one thing going against him and that is that is is a black lawyer
of fairly conservative political and judicial philosophy.''
   ``I am concerned about what I fear might happen to my friend
Clarence Thomas when he comes before the Senate Judiciary Committee
in his hearings,'' Danforth said.
   The Bush administration on Monday nominated Thomas as a judge of
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. It
is considered a prestige post because many of the most heavily
spotlighted cases come before the court.
   Also on Tuesday, Thomas received only a ``qualified'' rating
from the American Bar Association's judicial screening panel.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel confirmed that the
ABA's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary had rated Clarence
Thomas ``qualified'' instead of ``well qualified''.
   Runkel downplayed the fact that Thomas received a ``qualified''
instead of a ``well qualified'' rating, saying that ``anyone who is
qualified is by definition an appropriate nominee.''
   According to the ABA's judicial screening handbook, a
``qualified'' rating means that the nominee meets minimum
qualifications for satisfactory performance as a judge.
   To be rated ``well qualified,'' a nominee ``must have the
committee's strong affirmative endorsement...and be regarded as one
of the best available for the vacancy from the standpoint of
integrity, competence and temperament,'' the handbook said.
   Thomas, 41, has drawn considerable criticism from Capitol Hill
during his seven-year tenure at the Equal Employment Opportuniny
Commission. After President Bush announced in June his plan to
nominate Thomas, 14 House members signed a letter asking him to
reconsider.
   Critics say Thomas has not been vigorous enough in enforcing
civil rights laws.
   The senator took the floor and said: ``I know him to be an
absolutely first-rate lawyer and beyond that I know him to be a
first-rate human being.''
   ``The interest groups that did a job on William Lucas in the
Senate Judiciary Committee are going to be mobilizing again to do a
job on Clarence Thomas,'' Danforth said.
   When such organizations wage a campaign, Danforth said,
``anything goes in an effort to destroy the person who is the
nominee with whom you disagree.''
   A wide array of liberal and civil rights organizations including
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and
the NAACP Legal and Educational Defense Fund opposed the Bush
administration's nomination of former Wayne County Sheriff William
Lucas, a black Republican, as head of the civil rights division of
the Justice Department.
   The nomination died in the Senate Judiciary Committee with a
number of Democratic lawmakers saying they did not detect a deep
enough commitment to civil rights on the part of Lucas.
   Meanwhile, a number of civil rights groups that opposed the
Lucas nomination sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee,
asking the lawmakers ``to withhold judgment until a thorough
examination is conducted to determine whether mr. thomas ... is
fit.''
   The groups included the Alliance for Justice, the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National
Education Association, the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees and the Mexican-American Legal Defense and
Education Fund.
   The letter stopped short of recommending defeat of Thomas. But
it said that his ``actions as head of the EEOC ... suggest that he
lacks the commitment to equal justice, the qualifications and the
judicial temperment for a lifetime appoint to one of the nation's
most important courts.''
   Ralph Neas of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said
said many of the umbrella group's member organizations have
concerns about the Thomas record but that the conference has not
adopted a position thus far.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Names Special HUD Investigations Panel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
named a special panel Tuesday to investigate the
multibillion-dollar scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, just as a House probe is winding down.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., was named chairman of the new Special
Investigations Subcommittee by Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich.,
chairman of the banking committee.
   Graham said no decision had been made on whether the panel would
seek testimony from former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, who has
refused to testify before a House investigative panel on
constitutional grounds of self-incrimination, or three of his
former aides who have also refused to testify.
   ``Our goal is to make sure our housing program doesn't get
sacked again,'' Graham said. ``Working with our colleagues in the
House, we'll establish causes for the breakdown at HUD and propose
corrective legislation.''
   The chairman of the House subcommitee, Rep. Tom Lantos,
D-Calif., said last week after Pierce's second refusal to testify
that his panel was about to wrap up the hearings it began
conducting last spring.
   Graham said said Lantos ``has been very generous in his offer to
assist us'' in pursuing the investigation and finding legislative
remedies for the influence peddling, fraud and mismanagement that
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has acknowledged he found at the department.
   Graham presided over a hearing by the full banking committee on
the HUD scandal, in which a pair of former Reagan White House
officials denied they exerted any influence on behalf of specific
projects seeking HUD grants.
   A third witness, William M. Diefenderfer III, deputy director of
the Office of Management and Budget, acknowledged ``a massive
failure of collective oversight responsibilities, which includes
OMB,'' was responsible for the HUD scandals. The cost of those
scandals has been estimated at $2 billion to $6 billion or more.
   ``What we learned today was there was no meaningful oversight of
HUD ... during the Reagan administration,'' Graham said later.
``The cliche of `waste, fraud and abuse' was just that _ it was a
banner with no substance.''
   Appearing before the panel was Richard H. Davis, former
associate director for Cabinet affairs at the Reagan White House,
and Assistant Attorney General Carol Crawford, who during the
Reagan administration was associate director for economics and
governments at OMB.
   Davis, who was the White House liason to HUD, said he talked
daily with Pierce's former executive assistant, Deborah Gore Dean,
who has cited her Fifth Amendment rights in refusing to testify
before Congress. But Davis said he only passed along correspondence
or calls the White House received from political figures or others,
``with no value judgment.''
   ``I can't recall an instance where I was advocating a particular
project with Miss Dean,'' Davis said.
   Crawford said that while she was a top official of the White
House's Office of Management and Budget, with budget responsibility
for HUD, she was not responsible for overseeing management concerns.
   She said she was ``aware of problems,'' however, in HUD's
moderate rehabilitation program, which provided indirect federal
subsidies sought by developers for renovating housing for the poor.
She said the administration repeatedly recommended ending the
program but ``Congress disagreed with us and continued to fund'' it.
   Also named to the new panel, besides Graham, were: Republican
Sens. Connie Mack of Florida and Christopher Bond of Missouri; and
Democratic Sens. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama and Richard Bryan of
Nevada.

<HEAD>Parliament Votes to Scale Down Joint Dam Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament decided Tuesday to let the
people decide how and when to elect a president, and approved plans
to scale down a joint Danube River dam project despite
Czechoslovakia's objections.
   A motion to hold the election plebiscite Nov. 26 was approved by
a vote of 294-7 in the 380-seat legislature. A proposal fixing Jan.
7 for a direct presidential election, assuming that is the choice,
was approved 303-6.
   Hungary's ruling Communist Party, before its transformation Oct.
7 into a new Socialist Party, agreed with several new opposition
groups to choose the president by popular vote before parliamentary
elections planned for next year.
   Two groups that want the president appointed by the new
Parliament collected more than 200,000 signatures on petitions
supporting that view, however, and the issue went to the
legislators.
   While they profess democratic ideals, the Socialists will remain
in power at least until the parliamentary elections. The
petitioning organizations contended a popular election for
president would favor the Socialists because of their hold on power.
   The decision on the Danube power project came five months after
Hungary declared a moratorium on construction because of mounting
costs and fears of environmental damage, including pollution of
Budapest's drinking water.
   Czechoslovakia, a conservative Warsaw Pact ally already unhappy
about Hungary's rapid move toward a multiparty democracy, was
angered by the suspension and the vote Tuesday was expected to make
matters worse.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth urged Parliament to authorize new
negotiations with Czechoslovakia, and acknowledged indirectly that
the project had become a difficult political issue.
   He added, however: ``Can there be a greater political question
than protection of the human environment, the responsiblity to the
living conditions of future generations?''
   Only 189 members approved renegotiating terms of the
hydroelectric project, but they were a majority because of absences
and abstentions.
   A 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia, Hungary's northern
neighbor, foresees diverting stretches of the Danube and creating a
huge reservoir east of Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, as part of
a complex straddling the border.
   Several joint negotiating sessions since the Hungarian
suspension have failed. In its latest rejection of Hungarian
efforts to reduce the scope of the $3 billion undertaking,
Czechoslovakia sent a diplomatic note Monday demanding compensation
and threatening to divert the river on its own.
   Hungary contends such a diversion would violate international
and bilateral agreements governing border rivers and has
threatened, in its turn, to seek international arbitration.

   East Germany may legalize the main opposition
group, its official media said, and democracy marchers kept up the
pressure Tuesday while Egon Krenz, the new leader, was in Moscow to
see reformer Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The ruling Communist Party Politburo held its weekly meeting
Tuesday. ADN, the official news agency, indicated more leadership
changes might be in store.
   Several thousand people rallied in Weimar; 10,000 at Meissen,
near Dresden; and 5,000 in Meiningen near the West German border,
ADN reported. It said one demand of the marchers was legalization
of New Forum, the largest opposition alliance.
   Both the agency and state television's evening news said the
Interior Ministry was studying an appeal of the ban.
   In September, the Interior Ministry turned down New Forum's
application for recognition, describing it as an anti-state
organization, and ordered its members to cease all activity.
   It has been tolerated since mass protest began several weeks
ago, however, and New Forum leaders have met recently with
Communist Party officials.
   New Forum has attracted a wide following with its calls for free
elections, free speech and a free press. It claims a membership of
15,000.
   Krenz, who became Communist Party leader Oct. 18, has made moves
toward reform that would have been unthinkable under his hard-line
precessor, Erich Honecker.
   He arrived in Moscow late Tuesday and planned to meet with
Gorbachev on Wednesday. Krenz then will travel to Poland for talks
with the non-Communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, and the
Communist Party leader, Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   Krenz has expressed willingness to discuss reforms but also has
emphasized the Communist Party's leading role.
   Since he took over, authorities have made several concessions to
popular demands, including granting an amnesty for thousands of
people who fled the country or were caught trying to do so. It has
promised eventual freedom to travel to the West.
   But street demonstrations continue and many activists are
skeptical, saying East Germany's leaders are only interested in
reforms that do not challenge their monopoly on power.
   There has been speculation East Germany's Central Committee,
meeting Nov. 8-10, will purge aging Politburo members closely
associated with Honecker's 18-year rule.
   West Germany's Bild newspaper reported that Honecker's wife,
Margot, had lost her post as education minister. The newspaper
cited ``well-informed sources'' in its report.
   ADN, in reporting on Tuesday's meeting of the 21-member
Politburo, said the body discussed ``proposals on cadre questions''
to be considered at the Central Committee session. The word
``cadre'' applies to top-ranking party personnel.
   Two Politburo members, economy chief Guenter Mittag and
propaganda chief Joachim Herrmann, were removed when Honecker lost
his job amid an exodus to the West of thousands of East Germans
dissatisfied with his rigid rule.
   Also Tuesday, ADN reported that Harry Tisch will resign after 14
years as head of the state-controlled federation of trade unions.
Tisch is also a member of the Politburo. It was not immediately
clear if he would keep that post.
   Several trade union organizations around the country had
demanded Tisch's resignation, ADN reported. It said Tisch will step
down Thursday.
   Many young East German trade unionists have charged that the
federation has been serving only the interests of the government.

   The chairman of a House panel investigating
cereal makers' health claims said Tuesday that pressure by the
White House budget office has allowed food manufacturers to lie
about the ability of their products to prevent disease.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., likened the problem to ``snake oil
salesmen'' of old who made outrageous claims about miracle cures.
   Weiss criticized the Food and Drug Administration for letting
the rule-making process be circumvented so that food companies
could put health benefit claims on their products without
government scrutiny.
   He said FDA did so under pressure from the Office of Management
and Budget.
   ``I am concerned that the agency empowered by Congress to make
the federal government's health policy is not performing that
function,'' said Weiss, chairman of the House Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations.
   ``Instead, an ideologically driven OMB has seized the controls
of the health-policy ship.''
   Weiss' remarks came as he opened a subcommittee hearing at which
Dr. Frank Young, head of the FDA, testified. OMB officials are
scheduled to testify Nov. 8.
   Weiss said the FDA in 1987 changed an 81-year-old policy against
specific disease preventive advertising on food to allow
manufacturers, particularly those making cereal, to make false or
misleading claims.
   Without the ``strongest action'' from FDA to stop the misleading
claims, ``we are approaching total chaos in the marketplace,''
Weiss said.
   ``We have a large fiber war,'' Young said, adding that the FDA
``realized there was a problem'' with its 1987 action that set in
motion the flurry of ad campaigns emphasizing health claims.
   He said he met with OMB about the issue as part of the process
followed in setting FDA policies, but he said he didn't recall any
undue pressure from OMB to refrain from correcting the problem.
   Young said four hearings would be held around the country to
gather testimony to demonstrate a consensus for a rule to correct
the situation.
   Weiss was particularly critical of the way the 1987 decision
allows cereal makers to use psyllium, a soluble fiber, and
advertise that it can lower cholesterol.
   In letters to General Mills and Kellogg Co., the FDA said there
were ``well-known safety concerns'' associated with use of
psyllium, including possible allergic reactions.
   Last month, the FDA asked General Mills, maker of Benefit
cereal, and Kellogg Co., maker of Heartwise and Bran Buds, to
submit scientific data to show that the levels of the grain in
their products is safe.
   Weiss said, and Young agreed, that because of the 1987 decision,
a cereal company can make claims about the health benefits of a
substance such as psyllium even though the FDA has not proved that
it is safe and effective.
   The issue of whether psyllium is a drug or a food additive was
raised by the Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which uses psyllium in its
Metamucil laxative. The company asked the FDA to pull Benefit off
the market because the cereal had not been subjected to
drug-testing requirements.
   Bran Buds has been on the market for a year, Benefit is being
sold in selected test markets but Heartwise is not on the market
yet.
   General Mills has a warning on the Benefit package saying that
consumers should ``gradually increase'' the amount eaten, starting
with one half serving and gradually reaching a full serving.
   ``Always consume Benefit with milk. If digestive discomfort
occurs, consult a physician and avoid laxatives. Child should limit
consumption to one serving per day,'' says small print on the
package.
   A spokesman for Quaker Oats Co., which has been sued by the
Texas attorney general for health claims on its packages, said the
company supports FDA efforts ``to provide a uniform, tough, but
fair series of regulations.''
   ``The problem with any all-out ban on health messages for food
products is that in trying to reduce the potential for false and
misleading statements, it could also prevent consumers from
receiving useful, truthful and scientifically supported information
that can benefit their health,'' said Luther McKinney, Quaker Oats
senior vice president.

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted unanimously Tuesday to
condemn Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's Saturday announcement
that he will cancel the 19-month cease-fire in the war with the
Contras.
   The strongly worded resolution, approved 95-0, demands Ortega
renew his commitment to the cease-fire and conduct elections
scheduled for Feb. 25 in a free, fair and open manner.
   It expresses concern that Ortega's cancellation of the
cease-fire ``could be a prelude to a Sandinista effort to cancel or
postpone the elections.''
   Ortega had been scheduled to officially announce Tuesday whether
he would call off the cease-fire, but his spokesman said the
announcement had been postponed until Wednesday.
   ``Even Ortega's strongest apologists in Congress are having a
hard time coming up with excuses for this one,'' said Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, referring to the declaration
made by Ortega that he would end the cease-fire because of alleged
violations by the Contras.
   Ortega made the announcement while attending a hemispheric
meeting of heads of state in Costa Rica.
   Dole said the Senate resolution is a means of letting Ortega
know ``that we _ all of us, both parties, across the political
spectrum _ are not going to put up with this outrage.''
   The resolution sends the message that ``enough is enough,'' Dole
said.
   ``He's up to his old tricks and he's treating us to the same,
tired tap dance of tyranny,'' Dole said.
   ``This resolution expresses the dismay of the Senate,'' said
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   ``After so much hope has been invested in the electoral process,
to have Daniel Ortega, in such a cavalier manner, announce that he
is going to resume the conflict is an outrage to all civilized
mankind,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.
   ``What clearly has happened is that a very strong signal of
intimidation has been sent to the people of Nicaragua by Daniel
Ortega,'' Graham said.
   The Senate resolution calls Ortega's action ``totally
unjustified, a major breach of the Sandinista regime's commitments
to its democratic neighbors and its own people and a serious threat
to regional peace and stability.''
   It calls on Ortega ``to end his reckless rhetoric.''

   President Daniel Ortega postponed
until Wednesday a decision on whether to end a 19-month-old truce
with U.S.-backed Contras, a government official said.
   A spokesman at the president's office said an evening news
conference to announce a decision was put off because Ortega was
still meeting with senior defense and interior ministry officials,
``and this meeting will last a long time.
   ``We'll have the announcement very early Wednesday,'' she said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   President Bush has left open the possibility that he would seek
military aid to the Contras if Ortega went ahead with his plans to
break the truce.
   Ortega traveled Tuesday with an American diplomat to a site
where Ortega said a rebel attack the night before left four people
dead and five wounded.
   Ortega disrupted a summit last week by threatening to end a
truce with the Contras. He cited rebel attacks as a major reason.
   Presidential spokesman Maria Antonia Cuadra told The Associated
Press Ortega would probably make his truce decision announcement
from San Miguelito, the town where the government claims a Contra
attack took place Monday night.
   John Leonard, the U.S. charge d'affairs, was invited to
accompany Ortega to the site, but Leonard sent embassy political
adviser Valentin Martinez instead, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Mercedes Borge said.
   Ortega and Martinez, who is fluent in Spanish, spoke privately
for about five minutes at the farm cooperative that was allegedly
attacked near San Miguelito, about 200 miles southeast of Managua
on the shores of Lake Nicaragua, Ms. Borge said.
   The two traveled by helicopter accompanied by Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega _ the president's brother _ and Foreign Minister
Miguel D'Escoto, Interior Minister Tomas Borge and officials from
the United Nations and the Organization of American States.
   The leftist Sandinista government and Contra leaders agreed to a
truce in March 1988. Nicaragua has extended it on a monthly basis
since, but low-level fighting continued. The latest extension
expired Tuesday.
   On Friday, Ortega told a meeting of 17 Western hemisphere
leaders in San Jose, Costa Rica, he would end the truce. The heads
of state, including Bush, had assembled to honor the 100th
anniversary of Costa Rican democracy.
   Ortega said his decision was prompted by increasing Contra
attacks in the past three weeks and a rebel ambush earlier in the
week that killed 18 people. Many Contra fighters have moved to
Nicaragua from camps in neighboring Honduras in the three months
since a Central American peace agreement was signed Aug. 7.
   Reaction in San Jose was so negative Ortega backed off and said
there were ways the truce could be extended. He left the meeting
abruptly Saturday.
   After Ortega's announcement, Bush called him ``a little man''
and an ``unwanted animal at a garden party.''
   Contra leader Enrique Bermudez said Tuesday the Nicaraguan army
already had broken the truce.
   ``The Sandinistas have been waging a silent war against our
forces,'' he said in an interview in Tegucigalpa, capital of
Honduras. ``Now they are trying to make that war public because
they are facing defeat in the Feb. 25 presidential elections.''
   The Contras say they do not initiate attacks and act only in
self-defense.
   Barricada, the Sandinista party newspaper, quoted military
leaders in north central Matagalpa province Tuesday as saying
soldiers were ready ``to respond to the latest terrorist
expressions'' of the Contras, estimated to number 1,200 in that
area.
   It quoted Deputy Commander Orlando Talavera, regional security
chief, as saying 18 Contras had been killed in the area since
Friday.
   In San Jose on Friday, Presidents Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and
Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela reminded Ortega the peace plan
signed by five Central American presidents Aug. 7 provided
mechanisms for resolving disputes.
   Provisions of the plan include disbanding the Contras by early
December in return for Ortega's pledge the Nicaraguan elections
Feb. 25 will be free and fair.
   Congress allows only non-lethal aid to the Contras, but Bush
said Tuesday he might seek renewed military aid if the civil war
resumed.
   ``I would re-evaluate this situation in a minute if the
cease-fire is broken,'' he told a news conference in Washington.
   Both the United States and Contra leaders want to keep the
rebels intact as a fighting force to make sure Ortega keeps his
promise about the elections. Congress suspended military aid to the
Contras in February 1988.
   On Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said threats by
Ortega to suspend the truce might be a prelude to cancellation of
the elections for a president and national legislature.
   In an interview the same day with NBC News, Ortega said: ``The
elections are taking place in Nicaragua, period. With Contra or
without Contra they are going to take place, definitely. With war
or no war, that is, elections are taking place.''
   His government says 700 people have been killed and more than
1,000 wounded in rebel attacks since the truce was agreed upon in
March 1988.

   The Soviet legislature approved a 1990 budget
Tuesday that cuts the deficit in half, to the equivalent of about
$100 billion, by reducing military spending and capital outlays.
   Members approved the budget 357-6 after a tie vote of 181-181
that in effect rejected a proposal for 10 percent reductions in the
budgets of the government news agencies Tass and Novosti, and state
radio and television.
   A proposal to raise the prices of beer, tobacco and luxuries
went down 338-44.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the legislators, in remarks
carried on television: ``We have made a big step toward healing the
financial and economic situation by adopting this document, but
these are only our decisions. To implement them in life, we have to
work harder than we ever worked before.''
   He said the budget still was not satisfactory, ``but we have to
stop here because it stems from reality.''
   Gorbachev commented at the end of a five-hour joint session of
the two houses of the Supreme Soviet, and after Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow and President Bush in Washington
said the two presidents would meet meet on Dec. 2-3 aboard naval
vessels of the two nations in the Mediterranean.
   Shevardnadze denied U.S. media reports that possible U.S.
economic aid to the Soviets would be on the summit agenda.
   Tass said the 1990 budget anticipates income of 429.9 billion
rubles ($693.4 billion at the official exchange rate) and
expenditures of 489.9 billion ($790.2 billion).
   Those figures are almost exactly what the government proposed in
September and, if the government sticks to them, it will halve this
year's deficit of 120 billion rubles ($193 billion). The U.S.
deficit in fiscal 1990 is required by law to be no more than about
$110 billion.
   Officials proposed a cut in the defense budget this year from
77.3 billion rubles ($125 billion) to 70.9 billion ($114.3 billion)
and large reductions in expenditures for new factories and
equipment.
   Gorbachev's economic planners say the country must make better
use of the resources it has rather than constantly building new
factories and buying new equipment.
   Tass said the final budget and economnic plan calls for sharply
higher production of consumer goods, a sore point with citizens who
face perpetual shortages. It also said the budget allocates 13.4
billion rubles ($21.6 billion) to improve living standards, but was
not more specific.
   The attempt to reduce the budgets of Tass, Novosti and the
Gostelradio broadcast conglomerate appeared to be an expression of
frustration over reporting by the official media. Opponents of the
cuts said agencies needed the money to report more rapidly and
accurately.

   An Iranian-born reporter with the London
weekly Sunday Observer said in a TV interview broadcast Tuesday
that he was spying for Israel when arrested on Sept. 15 in Iraq.
   Farzad Bazoft, 31, has an Iranian passport with the right of
residence in Britain. He was traveling on British documents when
arrested.
   In the 25-minute interview over state television, he said the
British government was aware that he was an Israeli spy posing as a
reporter.
   In London, Observer editor Donald Trelford said it was clear
Bazoft's statement was made under duress and requested immediate
consular access to him.
   ``Not a word of it should be accepted without objective
supporting evidence. Only two weeks ago the Iraqis accused him of
being a British spy. Now they say he is an Israeli spy. I don't
believe either charge is true,'' he said on Independent Television
News.
   Bazoft said he was desperate to stay in Britain but did not have
the means when ``recruited by Israeli intelligence officers in
London in 1987'' who gave him money and found him the job with the
Observer.
   They later trained him in espionage, he said, assigning him ``to
gather information about Iraq's economic and military industrial
targets, and information about the political situation and the
morale of the people during and after the gulf war.''
   A cease-fire halted the Persian Gulf war between Iran and Iraq
in August 1988.
   Bazoft spoke in English and an interpreter translated his
answers into Arabic. It was not clear when the interview was
recorded.
   The Observer said Bazoft disappeared while investigating reports
that an explosion at a military industrial complex south of Baghdad
may have killed about 700 people. Iraq reported the death of 19
people in what was described as a fuel depot explosion.
   The British government has protested to Iraq about Bazoft's
detention.
   The International Press Institute sent a protest message in
October to President Saddam Hussein.

<HEAD>FDA Delays Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration, waiting for
direction from Congress, on Tuesday again extended its deadline for
deciding whether to ban Red Dye No. 3 in foods, drugs and cosmetics
on the grounds that it causes cancer.
   This extension pushes the deadline to Jan. 29, 1990. It had been
Wednesday. There have been dozens of previous extensions in the
19-year-old controversy.
   The agency had been prepared to ban the dye when the House voted
in July to require further studies before deciding on a ban. The
requirement was added to an appropriations bill after it had been
passed by the Senate.
   But last month, House and Senate negotiators deadlocked over the
issue and decided to give the FDA conflicting advice.
   House conferees stood fast on their wish to see more studies,
while Senate conferees agreed the FDA should follow existing law in
deciding whether the dye should be banned. Both positions were
included in the appropriations bill, which is still being hashed
out in the conference committee.
   The deadline was extended to see whether Congress clarifies its
position before final action on the bill, said an FDA source who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. As the case stands, it appears
the agency would have to ban Red Dye No. 3, said the source.
   The controversy over the dye dates to 1960 when Congress called
for a ban on foods that cause cancer in laboratory animals. Red Dye
No. 3 was put on a provisional list that allowed it to stay on the
market for an additional two years pending further study.

<HEAD>Heads For Australia To Promote Economic Cooperation In Asia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III headed
for Australia Tuesday night to promote closer economic cooperation
in Asia as a way of fostering open markets and democratic trends
around the world.
   He will also hold talks with Prime Minister Bob Hawke, whose
plan for a new economic community in the fastest-growing area of
the world could enhance investment opportunities for American firms
in Asia.
   U.S. trade with east Asia has more than tripled over the last
decade _ from $80 billion in 1978 to $280 billion last year. By
comparison, trade with Europe in 1988 was $180 billion.
   American investment in Asia, meanwhile, has climbed to more than
$33 billion, providing 23 percent of overseas profits earned by
U.S. firms.
   But even while Asia has moved past the European Common Market in
productivity, ``the network of U.S. ties with the Pacific is much
weaker than it is with Europe,'' a senior U.S. official said.
   In a briefing for reporters on ground rules that prevent use of
his name, the official said Baker's participation in the 12-nation
conference next week in Canberra has political as well as economic
objectives.
   Citing South Korea as an example, he said ``open market systems
tend to be associated with greater freedom.''
   Baker's eight-day trip will take him away from Washington at a
busy time in U.S. foreign policy. President Bush announced Tuesday
he would meet Dec. 2-3 with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Arabs and Israelis still have not come together on Mideast
negotiations.
   Baker said in an interview Monday he did not expect a
``make-or-break'' deveopment on Mideast talks while he was away.
And, he said, ``we will continue to try to work it, and I hope we
can have some conversations'' while he is in Australia.
   Baker has been conducting most of his Mideast diplomacy by
telephone with Foreign Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Esmat
Abdel Meguid of Egypt.
   The 12 nations attending the Canberra conference are Australia,
Japan, South Korea, Canada, the United States, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei and New Zealand.
   China was not invited because it has a Marxist economy. Taiwan
and Hong Kong also will not attend.
   The United States had suggested China and Taiwan be granted
observer status and Hong Kong attend as a full participant, said
the official. But, he said, all decisions are being made by
consensus, and the suggestion was withdrawn when no consensus could
be achieved.

offer on budget legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday blamed Congress for
failure to act on his legislative proposals and Vice President Dan
Quayle joined the attack, saying it's time to pass stalled budget
legislation and ``get on with it.''
   ``We've told them what we want. And I wish they'd get some
action going on the proposals that I have put forward. I think the
American people are entitled to that,'' Bush said at a news
conference.
   While the president and vice president fueled the partisan
wrangling between the White House and Capitol Hill, the
administration also reached a compromise to end a lenghthy battle
with Democrats over raising the minimum wage.
   The agreement, involving concessions on the part of both the
White House and the Democrats, would take the minimum wage to $4.25
by 1991 and couple it with a subminimum ``training wage'' for
teen-agers with little work experience.
   But battling continued on other issues, as Republicans dismissed
a Democratic offer to resolve differences over passage of a federal
debt ceiling needed to avoid government default by next week.
   That and other legislative matters have been stalled by what has
become the most dominant issue in Congress _ Bush's proposal to cut
the capital gains tax.
   Bush blasted Congress when asked about capital gains.
   ``Were not in the posture of trying to tell the Congress how
they ought to resolve these difficulties. We sent up clear
proposals on the anticrime package, on the minimum wage, on the
capital gains. And it has gotten so confusing up there that they
ought to move now,'' he told reporters. ``I think the American
people see that it is this Congress that is frustrating getting the
deficit down. And so they ought to move and move promptly.''
   But Bush said he would not specify how Congress should resolve
the matter.
   ``I can't sit there and fine-tune for them _ well, if you'll
only throw this one issue in with that one, why you can do your
business,'' he said.
   Quayle put out the word that the administration is going to make
Congress the whipping boy for the inability to agree on legislation.
   In a speech to the American Stock Exchange, Quayle said that,
``On Feb. 9, President Bush submitted his budget to the Congress.
Today is Oct. 31, and the budget reconciliation package is still on
Capitol Hill and has not passed the Congress.''
   ``Now it is Congress' responsibility to pass a budget
reconciliation and to get on with it,'' he said. ``It's time to get
on with the nation's business.''
   Capital gains has become the dominant issue before Congress,
blocking agreement on a $16 billion deficit-reduction bill,
legislation to boost aid to Poland and Hungary and on the measure
raising the government's debt ceiling.
   The White House comments came as congressional Democrats and
Republicans swapped offers on plans for passing a new federal debt
ceiling, needed by next week to avert a default by the Treasury,
and other pressing fiscal legislation.
   Despite the allure of wrapping up the session before
Thanksgiving, Senate Republicans rebuffed the offer because the
Democrats wouldn't give up their procedural blockade of a capital
gains tax cut.
   ``We all gave it a horse laugh. We assume they're not serious,''
said Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., following a GOP lunch.
   ``This would kill capital gains and it was deliberately designed
to do so. I hope it is rejected out of hand,'' said Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., a chief sponsor of the proposal, prior to a White
House afternoon meeting.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, announced a parliamentary plan to
secure Senate action on a separate capital gains bill, not tied to
other budget work. However, Mitchell said he wouldn't surrender the
right to filibuster the bill, a threat of endless debate which can
only be stopped by a 60 vote majority.
   The Democrats also offered to strip from the fiscal 1990
deficit-reduction bill a Democratic-sponsored child care initiative.
   Republicans countered with an offer of their own that would
allow quick passage of debt limit and deficit-reduction
legislation, and pile the capital gains tax cut, a rollback of the
Medicare catastrophic care program and several other controversial
proposals into a single measure.
   ``We too want to get the job done and get it done on time,''
said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.

   The Senate on Tuesday delayed final
congressional action on legislation guaranteeing $20,000
reparations payments to the estimated 60,000 still-living Japanese
Americans who were interned during World War II.
   The delay came about when the Senate adopted an unrelated
amendment involving a jurisdictional dispute between the
Appropriations Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. The
action will have the effect of sending the conference committee
report on the measure back to the House.
   The Senate will continue work on the $17.2 billion
appropriations bill on Wednesday.
   The $1.2 billion reparations program will pay out $20,000 in
compensation to each of the surviving Japanese-American internees
over a three-year period beginning next Oct. 1.
   The measure also provides appropriations for the State Justice
and Commerce Departments and contains major funding for the war on
drugs.

   Wintry weather overcame unseasonably warm weather in the upper
Great Lakes as snow and rain fell from Wyoming to New York state
Tuesday.
   Snow fell on sections of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota,
Minnesota and Michigan.
   By Tuesday morning, 6 inches of snow had fallen west of
Sheridan, Wyo. Other snowfall included up to 2 inches in Sheridan
and 2 inches in Worland, Wyo., and Helena Mont.
   Advisories for snow and blowing and drifting snow were in effect
through Tuesday night for Wyoming's Big Horn Mountains and the
northern mountains of Colorado.
   In Nebraska, advisories for Tuesday night warned of low
temperatures and gusty winds, which were expected to bring wind
chills and snow showers.
   Rain fell on northeast Wisconsin and lower Michigan, and
extended from Ohio to eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia,
southern New England, southeast New York, eastern Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Maryland and Delaware.
   The cold front that brought the rain and snow also brought low
temperatures, ending nearly a week of mild weather in the Great
Lakes states.
   In Indiana, frost and freezing-temperature advisories were in
effect for Tuesday night. Below-normal temperatures were expected
in Illinois.
   At 3 p.m. EST, temperatures around the nation ranged from 22
degrees in Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 86 degrees in Miami.
   Alamosa, Colo., broke its low-temperature mark for the date with
a reading of 2 degrees, and was the coldest spot in the Lower 48
states Tuesday morning. The city's previous record of 6 degrees was
set in 1971.
   The temperature in Grand Junction, Colo., dipped to a record 18
degrees, exceeding the mark of 20 degrees set in 1979.

   The final official casualty toll in the
earthquake that struck northern Algeria is 24 dead and 456 injured,
the government said Tuesday.
   Civil defense officials said Monday they believed 30 people died
in Sunday night's earthquake, which measured 6.0 on the Richter
scale and was followed 10 minutes later by a strong aftershock.
   The total was issued after a meeting of officials from several
ministries that was presided over by Prime Minister Mouloud
Hamrouche. There was no explanation for the lower death toll.
   Nineteen of the deaths occurred in the Tipasa region along the
Mediterranean coast east of Algiers, and the other five in the
capital.

<TEXT>
   Milan Huebl, who headed Czechoslovakia's
Communist Party Academy during the ``Prague Spring'' reforms and
later joined the independent human rights group Charter 77, has
died, emigre sources said Tuesday. He was 62.
   Huebl, a historian, was found dead in a Prague building Saturday
night, but the exact cause of his death was unknown, the emigre
sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Huebl, a key ideologist of the communist-led reforms of
Alexander Dubcek that were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion, served
as director of the Communist Party Academy during that brief period.
   However, he was convicted in 1972 on charges of ``anti-state''
activities and sentenced to 6{ years in prison. He was released
early, in December 1976, with three other prominent activists.
   In an interview with Austrian television shortly before his
release from prison, his wife Eliska Skrenkova-Hublova said he had
been imprisoned because ``he did not agree with the (hardline)
policies (pursued) since August 1968,'' the date of the invasion.
   ``He criticized his superiors, the party and the government,''
she said.
   Huebl was one of the first people to sign the Charter 77
manifesto on human rights and more recently joined Obroda, a group
of former communists advocating reform.
   Huebl contributed essays and articles to a number of underground
publications within Czechoslovakia and emigre journals.
   Because of his opposition views, Huebl's children were not
permitted to study at university and his wife was demoted from a
university teacher to a clerical job and then became unemployed.

<TEXT>
   A state licensing board Tuesday refused
to reopen the case of an optometrist who had some women patients
strip to the waist, but put him on three years probation and told
him to stop performing such exams.
   In an order filed later Tuesday, the Board of Optometry
Examiners said optometrist Gary Fisher committed a serious error in
judgment but insisted ``the state did not prove that there was any
motivation by Dr. Fisher which was in any way unethical.''
   The panel voted to tell Fisher to stop the screening
examinations, in which women patients were asked to partially
disrobe. During the probation, Fisher can continue to practice.
Fisher has said he no longer performed the exams.
   Fisher was called before the board on ethics complaints after
some women patients complained to police in Monticello in eastern
Iowa. He said he was checking for curvature of the spine, or
scoliosis, because he thought it was linked to some eye disorders.
   ``No connection has been proven to exist between scoliosis and
any eye condition,'' the board noted. ``His motivation was to
attempt to find the underlying causes for his patients'
conditions.''
   Referring to its initial hearing, the board said in the written
order that ``the evidence did not show there was any voyeuristic or
any other kind of sexual motivation'' and said ``there was no
sexual physical conduct.''
   Last month, the board voted to reject the complaints, saying
Fisher was ``honestly attempting to provide the best care.''
   The Iowa Board of Medical Examiners sought to have the case
reopened, saying Fisher had strayed into the practice of medicine
for which he was not licensed. The Attorney General's office also
asked the board to reconsider.
   The medical board had threatened a lawsuit if Fisher was not
stopped from performing the examinations.
   The case also raised questions about professional regulators
operating in secret. The board Tuesday conferred privately for 2{
hours before voting unanimously, without debate or explanation.
   After the issue first surfaced, both Fisher and the optometry
board defended themselves but have since refused to comment on the
advice of lawyers.
   Fisher said he was being harassed and said the issue was fully
aired before the optometry board. He had asked that the hearing be
closed.
   ``The board, after 20 hours of hearing, two full days,
exonerated me completely,'' said Fisher. ``Now I'm being retried in
the press.''
   The optometry board is made up of five optometrists and two
members of the public, all appointed by Gov. Terry Branstad.

   France early Wednesday exploded a
20-kiloton nuclear device at its underground test site on Mururoa
Atoll in the South Pacific, New Zealand scientists said.
   The blast, equivalent to 20,000 tons of dynamite, was the sixth
this year in French Polynesia and the second in what appears to be
a series of four, said Warwick Smith of the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research.
   Smith in a statement said the explosion, monitored by
seismographs at Raratonga, Cook Islands, occurred at 5:57 a.m.
   It was the 109th underground test on Mururoa in 1975, Smith
said. The last test, at 25 kilotons, was made Oct. 24.
   France, which considers the tests vital to maintaining nuclear
deterrance, has come under strong criticism from Australia, New
Zealand and South Pacific island states.
   ``This is the second test in French Polynesia in the current
series,'' Smith said. ``A series of four were held in May and June,
and on the basis of the past five years, we can expect another two
tests in the current series before the end of the year.''

   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder, sitting on a
15-point lead in a poll on Virginia's $25 million campaign for
governor, said Tuesday he hopes he will be judged on his
accomplishments rather than his race.
   ``I've never lost an election, and I think it's too late to
start now,'' Wilder, the state's black lieutenant governor, told a
girls' school audience.
   Wilder's Republican opponent, former Attorney General J.
Marshall Coleman, showed no signs of giving up before the Nov. 7
election.
   Coleman, 47, spent the day campaigning from southwestern Bristol
on the Tennessee border to the Atlantic Ocean resort city of
Virginia Beach.
   A poll published Sunday in The Washington Post showed Wilder
leading Coleman 52 percent to 37 percent, giving a boost to
Wilder's contention that racism ``plays no part at all'' in a
campaign that could produce the first elected black governor of a
U.S. state.
   Coleman said he did not believe the poll's findings ``and I'm
not going to sit still for it.'' The poll has a margin of error of
3 percent, which means the results could be off by that amount.
   Coleman held a news conference in Bristol with members of
Virginia's Fraternal Order of Police, which endorsed his candidacy.
The organization backed Wilder's bid for lieutenant governor in
1985.
   During a question-and-answer session with students at St.
Catherine's School _ a mostly white, private Episcopal school
attended by members of upper-income Richmond families _ Wilder, 58,
was asked whether he was concerned that the racial symbolism of his
candidacy might overshadow any of his initiatives.
   ``I hope the shadow isn't there,'' Wilder said. He said his
campaign was geared to the idea that education and economic
development ``are the greatest social equalizers.''
   When people judge his record, Wilder said, he hopes the judgment
will be based on performance ``and what I look like won't be
considered.''
   In Richmond, meanwhile, the National Right to Work Committee
released a tape recording of a private meeting between Wilder and
United Mine Workers members last summer. Wilder appears to say he
would support an amendment to the state's right-to-work law that
could require non-union members to pay dues to unions negotiating
bargaining agreements on their behalf.
   The committee's political arm plans to begin airing radio
commercials in support of Coleman, using portions of the tape.
   Committee President Reed Larsen said he didn't know who made the
recording and if he did, ``I wouldn't want to carry the fire
insurance on his house.''
   Wilder met the UMW members July 31 in Castlewood in the wake of
a bitter, violence-plagued strike still under way in the southwest
Virginia coalfields against The Pittston Coal Group Inc.
   According to an edited transcript of the recording, Wilder said
the right-to-work law has as much chance of being scrapped ``as a
snowball in hell'' and that he supports the law. Then he added, ``I
have to do that.''
   Asked whether he would support a so-called ``free-rider''
amendment allowing labor contracts in which non-union members could
be required to pay union dues, Wilder responded, ``That's
correct,'' according to the transcript.
   Wilder spokeswoman B.J. Northington said the tape was an effort
to ``make something out of nothing. We're not surprised by this.
The lieutenant governor has consistently supported the
right-to-work law.''
   Coleman's press secretary, Jay Timmons, said the Republican's
campaign did not know ahead of the release what was on the tape.

<TEXT>
   A police investigation of four
Palestinians on trial in Sweden uncovered apparent links to the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which killed 270 people in Scotland
last Dec. 21, according to court records.
   The four are charged here in connection with the preparation of
five bombs used in 1985 and 1986 against U.S. and Jewish targets in
Stockholm; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. One
person was killed and dozens were wounded in the bombings.
   Court records, examined by The Associated Press on Tuesday,
showed that Mohammed Abu Talb, thought to be the squad leader,
visited Malta in October 1988. That Mediterranean island nation was
believed to be the point of origin for the bomb that destroyed Pan
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Air Malta on Tuesday denied published reports that the bomb may
have been transferred to Frankfurt, West Germany, on a Malta
flight, inside an unaccompanied suitcase. It said its flight to
Frankfurt on Dec. 21, 1988 carried 39 passengers and 55 pieces of
baggage.
   ``All pieces of baggage have been accounted for and every one of
the 39 passengers has been identified,'' Air Malta said in an
official statament.
   West German investigators suggested a Maltese connection on
Monday.
   Scottish investigators have contended for months that the bomb
was put on the jet in Frankfurt, where Flight 103 originated.
Passengers and luggage were transferred to a Boeing 747 at Heathrow
Airport in London.
   Other court documents here showed Tuesday that Swedish police
arrested a brother of two defendants on suspicion of smuggling
plastic explosives to the West German apartment where the Pan Am
bomb was believed to have been assembled.
   The brother was released last November for lack of evidence.
Prosecutors told the AP that parts of the investigation against him
were classified.
   On trial are Abu Talb, 35, Marten Imandi, 35, Mahmoud Said Al
Moghrabi, 24, and Mustafa El-Mougrabi, 23. Moghrabi and Mougrabi
are brothers. Their names are spelled differently on the charge
sheet.
   Prosecutor Stefan Karlmark said before the trial opened Oct. 16
the Swedish investigators were not probing the Pan Am bombing,
since it was not relevant to their case.
   He also said he found no link between the four and the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, the group
suspected of the Pan Am bombing.
   Abu Talb has admitted belonging to the Palestine Popular
Struggle Front, which like the PFLP-GC, is an extremist faction
which rejects the moderate policies of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   According to his passport, Abu Talb was in Malta Oct. 19-26,
1988, after spending one day in Cyprus.
   The passport supports a report in The New York Times Tuesday
that Abu Talb was seen in Malta that month with Hafez Dalkamoni,
the suspected PFLP-GC officer now in custody in West Germany in
connection with the preparation of bombs.
   The Times quoted U.S. officials as saying Abu Talb retrieved an
altitude bomb assembled in an apartment in Neuss, West Germany, and
passed it on to another person. The bombs, packed in radiocassette
players, detonate when the plane reaches a pre-set altitude.
   Sixteen members of the PFLP-GC were detained in a sweep by West
German police Oct. 26, 1988, at the Neuss apartment, seizing bombs
similar to the one believed to have destroyed Flight 103. All but
two have been released.
   Abu Talb was quoted by The Times as telling investigators he
passed on a bomb overlooked in the raids.

<TEXT>
   Britain launched a new ship Tuesday to
keep the lifeline open to its remote Atlantic Ocean colony of St.
Helena.
   The Duke of York, who visited the island in 1984, christened the
6,500-ton vessel St. Helena at Hall Russell's yard in Aberdeen, on
Scotland's east coast.
   The new ship is the only passenger and cargo link between
Britain and St. Helena. It will make six round trips a year between
its home port of Avonmouth near Bristol and the island and will
also pay one visit a year to Tristan da Cunha, the even more remote
island colony in the south Atlantic.
   St. Helena, where the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled and
died in 1821, is 1,140 miles west of Africa and used to be a port
of call for liners on the Britain-South Africa run. It is 10 miles
long and 6 miles wide, with a population of 5,500. It is 16 days by
ship from England.
   Tristan da Cunha is 1,320 miles to the southwest of St. Helena
and has 300 residents.
   The ship cost $31.4 million and was ordered by the island's
government with funding from the Foreign Office to replace a vessel
of the same name that has served St. Helena for 27 years.

Virginia-based chain of more than 30 community newspapers in
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina and South Carolina.
   The Backe Group, headed by former CBS president John Backe, and
Susan Sounders Obrecht, an investor and president of ESS Ventures
Inc. are buying the chain in a deal expected to be completed by the
end of November.
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
   The chain, fouinded in 1957, also includes several seasonal,
weekly newspapers along the Atlantic coast. At peak season, the
chain has 255,000 subscribers and 200 employees.
   George N. McMath, Atlantic's president and sole stockholder,
said Tuesday that he decided to consider bids a couple of months

   The delicate task of removing the
steeple from earthquake-battered St. Patrick's Church began
Tuesday, with the fate of this heavily Roman Catholic community's
spiritual heart still in doubt.
   The Diocese of Monterey has not issued a final decision on
whether it will demolish the 86-year-old red brick church or try to
save it, said the Rev. Mike Miller, the parish priest.
   ``The final verdict isn't in yet,'' said Miller, but said there
was only a remote chance the California Gothic-style building could
be saved.
   Reports on the church's fate have changed almost daily.
   Workers are expected to take two to five days to remove the
60-foot wood-and-copper tower and four 20-foot spires surrounding
it, said Mike Bertrand of Bay Cities Crane &amp; Rigging Inc.
   The work will cost $350,000, Miller said. He said it would cost
about $2.5 million to replace or rebuild the church in this city of
30,250 people about 100 miles south of San Francisco.
   About two dozen people, including several of the church's
estimated 4,000 parishioners, watched as a large crane removed the
first of the four smaller spires, sending red brick tumbling to the
ground.
   It was an especially sad moment for Carlos Rico, a local market
owner who was baptized, confirmed and who celebrated his first Holy
Communion at St. Patrick's.
   Rico, 49, proudly produced a copy of his yellowed first
Communion certificate, dated May 9, 1948.
   ``This is my church,'' said Rico, taking pictures of the steeple
removal. ``It's been here since I don't know how long. I don't know
what we're going to do now.''
   Since the Oct. 17 earthquake, parishioners have crowded into the
gym at Moreland Notre Dame High School across the street for 10
Masses every Sunday.
   Parishioner Joe Herber, a Watsonville resident since 1962 and a
former teacher at Watsonville High School, said he hoped the
building could be saved.
   ``My daughter was married here,'' Herber said. ``This is the
cornerstone of the community.''
   Diocese officials want to preserve as much of the original
building as possible, Miller said. The church was built by Irish
immigrants in 1903.
   Along with the steeple and spires, officials hope to save the
huge stained glass windows decorating the church. One of Miller's
personal favorites depicts St. Patrick tossing the snakes out of
Ireland.
   Diocese officials also want to save the damaged pipe organ,
Miller said.
   The church's front altar was destroyed in the quake, but a
number of items, including several statues of saints, survived and
have been removed for safety.
   ``This is a really amazing building,'' Herber said. ``It
withstood the 1906 earthquake with flying colors and it's still
standing despite damage from this last quake. Maybe we'll save it
yet.''

<HEAD>Ex-Treasury Chief Attacks Thatcher's Attitude Toward Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nigel Lawson, whose resignation as Britain's top
treasury official has rocked the government, on Tuesday attacked
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's attitude toward Europe and
hinted he quit because she interfered.
   ``For our system of Cabinet government to work effectively, the
prime minister of the day must appoint ministers that he or she
trusts and then leave them to carry out the policies,'' Lawson told
the House of Commons.
   ``When differences of view emerge ... they should be resolved
privately and, whenever appropriate, collectively.''
   Earlier, Mrs. Thatcher, shouting above scenes of near-uproar in
the Commons, faced a barrage of opposition taunts over Lawson's
resignation.
   Opponents also accused her of robbing Britain of an effective
role in the European Economic Community by balking at linking the
pound to Europe's other major currencies _ the key dispute between
her and Lawson.
   He quit last Thursday saying he could not continue as long as
Mrs. Thatcher kept her personal part-time economic adviser, Sir
Alan Walters, who opposed full British membership in the European
Monetary System (EMS) that links nine European currencies. Walters
later resigned, too.
   The new Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, pledged that
economic policy would not change. He said he will stick to the
Lawson strategy of increasing basic bank interest rates _ now at 15
percent _ as the main tool of dampening inflation.
   Major, sounding more enthusiastic than Mrs. Thatcher about full
EMS membership, added, ``The question is not whether we should
join, but when.''
   Mrs. Thatcher reiterated her stringent conditions for joining
the exchange rate mechanism of the system including free movement
of capital. She gave no date for membership.
   Opposition Labor Party legislators declared she has no intention
of joining the EMS fully before the next election, which must be
held by mid-1992.
   They attacked during a debate called by Labor on Tuesday seeking
to censure the Conservative government for its handling of the
economy. As expected, the opposition censure motion was easily
defeated by a vote of 342 to 238.
   ``In this party ministers decide and advisers only advise,''
said Mrs. Thatcher, who has a 101-seat majority in the 650-member
House of Commons.
   On Europe, she added, ``We believe in Europe, a Europe based on
a free economy ... not a regulated bureaucracy dictating to this
House from Brussels.''
   As Lawson rose to speak publicly for the first time since
resigning, the rowdy scenes subsided in the Commons.
   Intervening in the debate on the troubled economy, Lawson
described Walters' stance on British membership in the European
Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism as ``the tip of a
singularly ill-concealed iceberg with all the destructive potential
that icebergs possess.''
   ``Britain's destiny lies in Europe. ... It is vital that we
maximize Britain's influence in the community.
   ``I have little doubt that we will not be able to exercise that
influence effectively ... as long as we remain largely outside the
EMS. So for economic and political reasons alike, it is important
that we seek the earliest practicable time to join, rather than the
latest for which a tolerable case can be made.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's popularity ratings have slid further behind
Labor in the furor. Critics, including some within the party,
redoubled charges she is autocratic and fails to consult or listen
to the rest of the 22-member Cabinet.

<HEAD>New Candidate Enters Brazilian Presidential Race Near End</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millionaire businessman and TV
entertainer Silvio Santos on Tuesday announced he would run for the
Brazilian presidency two weeks before the election, a move analysts
say could alter the outcome of the campaign.
   Santos, 59, who says he knows little about politics, told
reporters during a raucous press conference at the Congress he
would run under the small and relatively unknown Brazilian
Municipalist Party.
   Santos is owner of SBT network, the country's second largest,
and host of a 6-hour Sunday raffle and prize show that is immensely
popular among Brazil's poor.
   Santos' sudden candidacy, coming 15 days before the country's
first direct presidential election in 29 years, was labeled as
``opportunism'' by businessmen and the work of presidential
operatives by other candidates.
   Analysts said Santos could hurt two leading candidates, Fernando
Collor de Mello, of the center-right National Reconstruction Party,
and Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, of the radical-left Workers' Party.
Both candidates rely heavily on support from Brazil's lower classes.
   A sharp, last-minute swing at the polls was possible since ``the
majority of the electorate has not become overly enthusiastic about
any of the 22 candidates in the race,'' wrote Clovis Rossi, a
columnist for the respected Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper.
   Antonio Ermirio de Moraes, one of Brazil's leading businessmen,
called the announcement ``handiwork of the presidential palace,''
to weaken Collor de Mello, a harsh critic of President Jose Sarney.
   Collor de Mello, who holds a two-to-one lead over his closest
opponent in nationwide polls, said he would try to invalidate
Santos' candidacy with a law that requires public personalities to
stop their professional activities three months prior to the
election.
   Santos, a descendent of Greek immigrants, worked as a street
vendor before gaining national attention for amassing a fortune
that today includes a a TV network, a bank, a chain of supermarkets
and stores.
   On Nov. 15, 82 million Brazilians _ a majority of them from the
lower class _ are to choose Sarney's successor for a five-year
term, the first popular vote for president since 1960.
   If no candidate wins a majority on Nov. 15, the two top
vote-getters will face each other in a runoff in December.

   A bomb explosion wrecked a
leftist union hall in the capital Tuesday, killing 10 people and
wounding 29.
   The devastating explosion rocked the National Federation of
Salvadoran Workers, or FENASTRAS, union hall at 12:30 p.m., hours
after a bombing slightly wounded four people at the offices of
Comadres, a human rights group.
   Two Americans _ Mark Anner of Greenwich, Conn., and Brenda
Hubbard, 41, of Los Angeles _ were injured in the attacks.
   Union leaders called for a 24-hour general strike beginning at 6
a.m. Wednesday to protest the FENASTRAS bombing. They asked workers
to join in a funeral march for the slain unionists Wednesday
afternoon.
   Journalists who reached the scene in downtown San Salvador
counted six mangled bodies in the rubble of the FENASTRAS building.
A Rosales Hospital spokesman said a union leader and a girl died
while undergoing surgery. Later, the hospital reported that two
more victims had died.
   The blast toppled concrete pillars, twisted girders and
destroyed almost the entire roof of the building, in the heart of
the capital, two blocks from the National Police headquarters and
four blocks from the Metropolitan Cathedral.
   Federation Secretary-General Gerardo Diaz was among the wounded.
   Both targeted organizations were considered guerrilla fronts by
the rightist government. Leaders of FENASTRAS and Comadres accused
the armed forces of responsibility for the bombings. The armed
forces rejected the allegation.
   The bombings were the latest flareup of violence in El
Savaldor's decade-old civil war that has killed 70,000 people, most
of them civilians. A rebel mortar attack on the Defense Ministry in
San Salvador on Monday killed one person and injured 15.
   ``We the workers see more clearly than ever that we are at war
against Arena,'' said Humberto Centeno, member of the directorate
of the National Union of Salvadoran Workers, the country's largest
labor federation. He commented at a news conference held amid the
rubble at FENASTRAS.
   Arena is the Republican Nationalist Alliance, the governing
party.
   An armed forces communique condemned the attack on FENASTRAS as
``a terrorist act'' and asked all Salvadorans ``to try to put an
end to these kinds of actions, which only bring mourning, pain and
death.''
   Hospital authorities identified one victim who died there as
Febe Velasquez, a member of the FENASTRAS directorate. Another was
an unidentified teen-age girl.
   Hospital authorities said admittance forms were filled out for
27 people but that several gravely wounded people were admitted
without forms.
   Among the dead was 21-year-old Julia Mendoza, a union official
allegedly tortured and raped during detention at National Police
headquarters in September.
   FENASTRAS was attacked Sept. 5 with an anti-tank rocket that
damaged the building's facade but inflicted no casualties.
   Hector Recinos, a member of FENASTRAS' directorate, blamed the
army for Tuesday's attack. ``This is a response to the attack on
the Joint Chiefs,'' he said, referring to the rebel assault on the
Defense Ministry.
   He said the bomb apparently was thrown from a passing vehicle.
   The earlier bomb attack was at the downtown headquarters of
Comadres, a leftist organization grouping ``disappeared people''
and political prisoners. Four people were injured, none seriously.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack.
   Members of Comadres also blamed the army, but the armed forces
press office denied the army was responsible for the blast.
   Ms. Hubbard, a ``solidarity worker,'' was cut on the face by
flying debris. Anner suffered a head injury in the larger,
FENASTRAS blast.
   ``Solidarity workers'' are members of North American and
European organizations that sympathize with and help Salvadoran
leftists.
   One civilian was killed and 15 people were injured Monday when
guerrillas mounted a mortar attack on the Defense Ministry compound
on the west side of the capital.
   In a statement broadcast on its clandestine Radio Venceremos,
the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front claimed
responsibility.
   The broadcast praised the guerrillas who mounted it, claiming it
caused ``numerous casualties to officers and troops'' and ``serious
damage'' to the installations.
   Journalists at the scene said most of the victims were
civilians, and they described damage as superficial.
   The rebel statement admitted some mortar rounds missed their
mark and caused civilian casualties, adding, ``We lament that.''
   That assault ended an eight-month rebel ban on the use of
inaccurate homemade mortars in cities.
   President Alfredo Cristiani condemned Monday's attack as
terrorism, and even leftist politician Ruben Zamora, who maintains
formal links with the rebels, termed the attack ``incorrect'' and
``condemnable'' as a violation of the Geneva Accords.
   The rebels announced Feb. 28 the suspension of use of such
weapons in populated areas because their inaccuracy resulted in
civilian casualties.
   Authorities said 16 mortars were fired at the heavily fortified
military compound housing the ministry and the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
   Half the projectiles were way off their mark, and the other half
landed on surrounding streets, sidewalks and businesses.

<HEAD>Rival Cabinets in Lebanon Squabble over U.N. Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon's rival cabinets clashed on
Tuesday over a complaint sent to the U.N. Security Council by
hard-line Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun protesting the presence
of Syrian troops here.
   Also Tuesday, seven Algerian army officers arrived in Beirut to
help set up a security zone for a Parliament meeting to elect a new
president for Lebanon, despite Aoun's opposition to convening such
a meeting.
   Aoun's forces fought six months of artillery battles with the
Syrian army that killed more than 900 people.
   In the name of his three-man Cabinet, Aoun asked U.N. Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar to distribute his cable as an
official document to Security Council members. It did not request a
debate on the issue.
   ``We reserve the right to ask for a formal Security Council
session on the Syrian and Israeli occupation of Lebanese
territory,'' the cable said. The text was released by Aoun's
administration.
   ``We wish to lay stronger emphasis on the occupation of the
Syrian army of the greater part of this territory,'' it said.
   About 40,000 Syrian troops control 70 percent of the territory
in Lebanon, which has been rent by 14 years of civil war. The
Syrians deployed in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
But Aoun said in March they betrayed the mandate by siding with the
Moslems and declared a ``war of liberation'' against them.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the rival,
Syrian-backed Cabinet, asked the Security Council in a separate
telegram to ``ignore the complaint.''
   Hoss said the protest was ``illegitimate'' because, he said,
Aoun does not represent all of Lebanon.
   Aoun's move came after separate meetings with the ambassadors of
Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China _ representing four of
the five permanent member states of the Security Council.
   The United States withdrew its diplomatic mission from Lebanon
on Sept. 6, complaining of harassment by Aoun supporters.
   The Algerian officers will now await instructions from Arab
League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, a police spokesman said.
   Ibrahimi, assistant secretary-general of the 22-member Arab
League, heads a security committee comprising representatives of
Aoun's 20,000-strong mainly Christian army as well as the main
warring factions in Lebanon.
   He said Monday he was ``optimistic that the parliamentary
session to elect a new president will be held before Nov. 7.''
   Sixty-three of Lebanon's 73 surviving parliamentarians attended
a special session in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in October and agreed to a
peace plan to end the civil war in their country.
   The plan was brokered by an Arab League committee, comprising
the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, has rejected the peace accord and
threatened to dissolve the Parliament because the plan does not
include a fixed timetable for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon.

   A 17-year-old high school senior from Mesa,
Ariz., won a full, four-year college scholarship on Tuesday in a
day-long reporting contest featuring students from all 50 states.
   Peter Robison, a senior at Mesa High School, hopes to use the
scholarship from the contest, sponsored by the Pilot Pen Corp., at
Stanford University next fall.
   Four runners-up were also chosen based on their writing on the
full day of news conferences, network bulletins and other material
on a fictitious conflict in Africa.
   The runners-up, each awarded a check for $2,500, were Michele
Helm, Regina High School, Harper Woods, Mich.; Christopher
Heimarck, Moorhead Senior High School, Moorhead, Minn,; Elizabeth
McDonald, Colonie Central High School, Albany, N.Y.; Tara Keys ,
North Medford High School, Medford, Ore.
   ``We hope that this competition, held at the National Press
Club, will focus interest in a dramatic way on the field of
journalism,'' said Ronald G. Shaw, Pilot Pen president.
   ``It was fun,'' said Robison, who was told of his victory at a
banquet following the day's events.
   Pilot Pen, based in Trumbull, Conn., is a leading supplier of
writing instruments. The fictional international situation began at
8:30 a.m., with changes developing every 15 minutes, news
conferences by both sides and culminated with a mock presidential
news conference announcing the United States was sending troops to
support its ally.
   The 50 student finalists were culled from more than 50,000
entrants from 1,000 high schools nationwide. The finalists were
required to write a 500-word newspaper story reporting the day's
events.

<TEXT>
   A government official said Tuesday
``a tacit agreement'' has been reached with United Press
International but declined to confirm that the news agency would be
able to continue operating in Panama.
   Interior Minister Renato Pereira last Thursday complained of
publication of ``false news'' and ordered UPI's Panama operations
stopped. He gave its foreign personnel 72 hours to leave the
country. UPI denied the allegation and asked for a reconsideration
of the decision on Monday.
   ``We have reflected on the problem and we have arrived at a type
of tacit agreement in the sense that UPI is going to be more
careful in the writing of news that is produced in Panama and this
ministry agrees to give a constructive solution to the difference
between the Panamanian government and UPI,'' Pereira said.
   He talked with reporters after a meeting with UPI Vice President
Pieter Van Bennekom.
   Pereira's statement indicated the agency would continue to
operate, but when asked, he would only say, ``We are going to give
a constructive solution in the next few hours.''
   He said it would be ``a constructive solution in the most
generous sense of the term.''
   ``We are waiting for a decision from the authorities,'' said Van
Bennekom.
   Van Bennekom said the solution ``does not affect freedom of
expression.''
   In its order, the ministry said UPI had ``systematically
violated journalistic ethics through the publication of false news,
with the evident intention of discrediting authorities of the
Republic of Panama and damaging the image of its leaders.''
   The agency filed a request for reconsideration on Monday, saying
the stated reasons for the order were ``not true, nor had they been
previously proven legally.''
   The trip by Van Bennekom from UPI's Washington office to Panama
to talk with authorities was ``a demonstration of good will on the
part of UPI toward the government and as a result the case deserves
to be resolved in a constructive way,'' Pereira said.
   UPI has operated in Panama since the 1930s. Its chief
correspondent is Tomas Cupas, a Panamanian. Elizabeth Lordan, an
American, has been at the office for a year.

   Workers searching the twisted wreckage of
Interstate 880 found the bodies of a woman and a man in separate
vehicles, two weeks after the earthquake, a police spokesman said
Tuesday.
   The body of Joyce Ann Mabry, 31, of Berkeley, Calif., was found
around 7 p.m. Monday, said Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Jim
Knudsen. Around 7 a.m. Tuesday, searchers found the body of James
J. Flores, 39, of Rohnert Park, Knudsen said.
   ``We're checking the vehicles for personal belongings,'' Knudsen
said. ``We have no reason to believe there are any more bodies
there.''
   The discoveries raised the death toll in the quake's worst
disaster to 41 and the overall number of people who died in the
quake to 66.
   Mabry was the mother of a 3-year-old boy and Flores had a
teen-age child.
   ``It's a terrible thought to think that sombeody you love is up
there in the rain, the cold, the night, and it's hard to decribe,
but we're glad he's down,'' Flores' brother, Leonard, said after
the body was recovered.
   Those who survived the catastrophe struggled to recover from
their injuries.
   Cathy Scarpa, 37, remained hospitalized Tuesday with multiple
fractures in both legs and a crushed hand suffered when her carpool
van was smashed in the collapse of Interstate 880 in Oakland. Five
of the University of California-San Francisco co-workers who were
with Scarpa, a registered nurse and health education, were killed
in the van.
   ``There were some services for the people who died, and it was
hard not to be a part of that. It's hard to be here dealing with
all this and not being a part of normal life,'' said Scarpa,
sometimes through tears, from her bed at Eden Hospital in Castro
Valley.
   Scarpa is one of dozens still hospitalized with broken limbs and
other injuries suffered in the devastating earthquake Oct. 17 that
killed 64, crippled the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and
buckled a 1{-mile section of the I-880 freeway in Oakland.
   In all, 2,874 people were treated and released and 439 were
hospitalized, enough to fill a large hospital, according to a
survey conducted last week by the California Association of
Hospitals and Health Systems.
   Perhaps the most famous patient is Buck Helm, the feisty
longshoreman trapped for four days in the squashed wreckage of his
car on I-880. He was listed on Tuesday in serious condition at
Highland Hospital in Oakland.
   Julio Berumen, the 6-year-old whose leg was amputated during his
rescue at I-880, and his 8-year-old sister, Cathy, both were listed
in good condition on Tuesday at Children's Hospital in Oakland, and
the hospital said they were improving daily. The youngsters lost
their mother in the freeway collapse.
   Among those still clinging to life Tuesday was Margaret
Fitzpatrick, a UCSF employee who was riding with Scarpa. She
remained in critical condition at Eden Hospital in a ``near coma''
with multiple internal injuries, said hospital spokesman Thomas
McGarry.
   Scarpa remembers the upper level of the freeway dropping 20 feet
and concrete raining down on the van, crushing it like a fist
smashing an aluminum can. She remembers a co-worker in the smoky
darkness crying, ``Oh, my God!''
   Her legs, trapped under the dash, are fitted with pins and she
is awaiting a bone graft. It will be six months before she can
stand and only then will therapists begin teaching her to walk
again.
   For now, she looks forward to a visit from her dogs and is
comforted by mail from well-wishers, including a friend she hadn't
seen in 12 years.
   ``It's tremendous. I can't believe the calls and mail and
balloons from friends and people I've worked with on projects,''
said Scarpa.
   Until Sunday, Carmen Smith, 64, was unable to discuss his
20-foot fall off the I-880 structure that left parts of his spine
crushed.
   ``He said it was like being in a washing machine while it was
going,'' said Christi Welter, spokeswoman for San Jose Medical
Center, where Smith underwent a second operation on Friday. Smith,
who is in stable condition, was driving his truck when the elevated
freeway collapsed.
   ``From the beginning he was having such nightmares. ... He was
reliving what was happening. He thought he was going to die,''
Welter said.
   Neither the state hospital association nor its Northern
California counterpart has determined how many victims remain
hospitalized, but they estimate the number at dozens.
   In all, 48 of the 112 hospitals in the nine quake-stricken
counties treated or admitted patients. And the state hospital
association estimated that the hospitals suffered $25 million in
damage themselves.
   Watsonville Community Hospital, close to the epicenter of the
quake, was hardest hit; its chief administrator, Paul Estess, put
damage at $2 million.
   In the frantic hours after the quake, Watsonville Community
Hospital lost its water supply and part of its electrical power and
had to evacuate all patients who could walk onto the lawn, Estess
said. More than 300 people were treated in the outdoor emergency
room and 12 were admitted with a variety of injuries, while others
were airlifted or taken by ambulance to other hospitals.
   Neither the Federal Emergency Management Agency nor the state
Office of Emergency Services has compiled an estimate of the total
cost of medical treatment for the injured, officials said.
   In other developments:
   _ The state Legislature will convene in special session Thursday
to consider raising $800 million for quake relief with a one-year,
quarter-cent sales tax increase, to begin in time for the busy
Christmas season.
   _ San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. announced the
defending Super Bowl champions will play at Candlestick Park as
scheduled on Monday night against the New Orleans Saints, after
receiving assurances from the city the park is safe.

<HEAD>A Reworked `Lisbon Traviata' Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not often a playwright gets a second chance
with a play, much less a third.
   Terrence McNally has had three productions of ``The Lisbon
Traviata'' done in New York since 1985. And the latest incarnation,
which opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's Promenade Theatre, is the
most satisfying yet.
   What the playwright has done is more than refine the second
version performed earlier this year at Manhattan Theatre Club. He
has radically changed its ending and deepened the characters,
particularly its protagonist, a bitter, cynical and self-centered
homosexual named Stephen.
   McNally's play deals with the comic and tragic sides of
obsession, in this case the adoration of opera star Maria Callas.
   The comedy occupies most of Act 1 and is anchored in the
character of Mendy, played with comic bravura by Nathan Lane.
Swaddled in a sagging, red satin bathrobe, Mendy sashays through
the first act, mocking every opera diva except the divine Maria.
She is his reason for living. And when Stephen tells him he has a
pirated recording of Callas' ``La Traviata,'' sung in Lisbon, Mendy
must hear it.
   Stephen shares that obsession and has another obsession of his
own, the breakup of his relationship with Michael, a doctor, who
has found someone else. This triangle becomes the focus of the
emotionally charged second act.
   In earlier versions, it was difficult to shift gears, to make
the adjustment from the wicked hilarity of Act 1 to the dramatic
fireworks of Act 2.
   McNally has made the play less violent but also more believable.
He has sacrificed a grand, almost operatic gesture for what is a
more likely and much sadder conclusion.
   Other members of the MTC cast repeat their performances here.
Anthony Heald is remarkable as the unhappy and sour Stephen. It's a
difficult role, halfway between hero and villain. Heald
successfully negotiates the contradiction. Dan Butler plays his
lover with dignity and a quiet intensity that is compelling, while
John Slattery is fine as the man who comes between them.
   This new production confirms that ``The Lisbon Traviata'' is one
of McNally's best plays, full of slashing, savage wit and an added
dimension of humanity that comes from its much more realistic and,
ultimately more moving, finale.

   Officials at a federal hearing into a
jet crash that killed 112 people said Tuesday they are not ready to
conclude that a hairline crack in an engine fan disk caused the
DC-10's engine to explode.
   James Nall, the National Transportation Safety Board member in
charge of the Sioux City hearing, said no final decision on the
cause of the July 19 United Airlines crash will be issued for
months, after the full NTSB meets to review testimony.
   ``This is simply a portion of the investigation _ part of the
early stages of it,'' Nall said on the first of four days of
hearings.
   Investigators are focusing their study on a disk from the
airplane's tail-mounted engine. They believe a flaw in the disk's
metal caused it to explode, sending pieces of metal ripping through
the airplane's tail section and severing the hydraulic lines that
give pilots control of the aircraft.
   A report released Tuesday said the fan disk of the jet's rear
engine had a hairline crack less than a half-inch long before the
plane's final flight.
   A Federal Aviation Administration official said last week that
tests on the fan disk indicated the crack was caused by a flaw in
the metal that probably was present when the disk was made 18 years
ago by General Electric Co.
   But NTSB officials said they have drawn no final conclusions.
   United Airlines spokesman Robert Doughty also said Tuesday that
it is too early to pinpoint the cause of the engine explosion.
Doughty said experts have only had 12 days to study the disk.
   ``A full analysis takes two months,'' he testified. ``It's
really premature to make a judgment.''
   The NTSB report is based on detailed testing of the fan disk,
found in two pieces in corn fields near Alta, about 80 miles east
of Sioux Gateway Airport, where the airplane cartwheeled and burst
into flames as pilots tried to make an emergency landing.
   The report by NTSB Senior Metallurgist James F. Wildey II said
the disk had two cracks but that only one existed before the
explosion. The report said that crack was visible to the naked eye
after the accident, but did not say whether the crack was
detectable earlier.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said Wildey did not attempt to
determine whether the crack was detectable before the crash.
   Lopatkiewicz also said the report does not conclude that the
crack was due to a flaw in the titanium disk that might have
existed for years.
   Wildley is scheduled to testify Wednesday.
   In another written report to the NTSB, flight simulator expert
John C. Clark said United pilot Al C. Haynes had virtually no
chance to make a safe landing after the hydraulic systems lost
fluid. Clark assembled a panel of experts who used flight
simulators to fly a DC-10 with no hydraulic controls.
   ``The consensus of the group was that the pilot could fly the
airplane but an adequate landing could not be accomplished within
the pilot's control,'' Clark said in the report.
   Engineering Test Pilot Phillip Battaglia of McDonnell Douglas,
which built the DC-10, testified that the company had not
anticipated an explosion severing all three hydraulic lines.
   Battaglia said that since there was no precedent, the company
did not have instructions on how a pilot should deal with such a
problem, and said it was unlikely any instructions could help a
pilot safely land anyway.
   ``It's my opinion that this is not a trainable maneuver,'' he
said.
   The plane cartwheeled to a stop at the edge of a cornfield on
airport property, which hampered rescue efforts, said the airport's
fire chief.
   Firefighters had trouble dousing the burning aircraft and
locating survivors because of the standing corn, said James
Hathaway of the Iowa National Guard. The Guard is in charge of
firefighting at the airport.
   The corn did provide refuge for those fleeing the burning plane,
acting as a barrier to the radiant heat, he said.
   The airport leases land along its runways to farmers. At the
time of the crash the corn stood 6 feet or taller.
   FAA regulations allow crops to be grown on airport land and
officials say the practice is common in the Midwest. But a proposed
FAA advisory to airports recommends that farming be limited and
that crops not be planted within 1,200 feet of any runway center
line.

   A wave struck a freight elevator on an
aircraft carrier as sailors moved missiles from one deck to another
early Tuesday, sweeping three men and 38 missiles into the Atlantic
Ocean, the Navy said. Two sailors were rescued.
   In the Pacific Ocean, another sailor was missing after being
swept off a Navy carrier into rough seas Monday night, a Navy
spokesman said Tuesday.
   Navy planes and ships searched through the day for the two
sailors from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Atlantic and the
USS Carl Vinson in the Pacific. The accidents aboard the Vinson 620
miles north of Wake Island and on the Eisenhower 90 miles southeast
of Cape Hatteras, N.C., were the third and fourth accidents on Navy
ships in three days.
   The accident aboard the Eisenhower occurred at 1:15 a.m. during
routine operations, the Navy said in a news release.
   The two sailors were rescued about an hour later. One was in
serious condition and the other was in good condition, said Lt.
j.g. Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman. They were being
treated aboard ship, he said.
   One was pulled from the ocean by helicopter and the other by
boat, Johnson said. Their names were withheld pending notification
of relatives.
   The search for the missing man, identified as Airman Craig A.
Harris, 22, of Uniontown, Pa., was called off late in the
afternoon, said Lt. Paul Jenkins, another Atlantic Fleet spokesman.
   Eighteen Sparrow and 20 Sidewinder missiles went down in the
deep water, but the non-nuclear, air-to-air missiles posed no risk,
the Navy said.
   ``They were not nuclear-powered. They were not armed,'' said
another spokesman, Senior Chief Petty Officer Cindy Adams.
``Therefore, they're harmless.''
   The sailors were knocked overboard by a wave while they moved
the missiles and other ordnance and gear from the flight deck down
to the hangar deck.
   The sailors were on an elevator even with the hangar deck, about
20 to 30 feet above the water line, when the wave hit, said
Johnson. The ship reported that it was raining and waves were
running 4 to 8 feet at the time, he said.
   Johnson said he did not know the value of the missiles.
   Joining in the search for the missing sailor was the destroyer
USS Dewey and the guided missile frigate USS Carr, as well as
aircraft from the carrier, Johnson said.
   In the Pacific, the Vinson, the guided missile cruisers USS
California and USS Vincennes, several aircraft and helicopters
searched for the Vinson crewman who was swept overboard the
previous night, Chief Petty Officer Erik Erickson said in Naval
Base San Francisco.
   The sailor, who was not identified, fell into the sea at 10:26
p.m. PST Monday as the aircraft carrier encountered 12-foot swells,
Erickson said. The ship was returning to its home port at the
Alameda Naval Air Station on San Francisco Bay after participating
in exercises.
   On Sunday, a pilot making his first landing on an aircraft
carrier crashed on the USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killing
him and four people on the ship. The Navy refused Thursday to
release a videotape showing the jet crash.
   The tape will not be made public because it is part of the
accident investigation, said Fred Hoffman, a Defense Department
spokesman in Washington.
   On Monday, a pilot accidentally dropped a bomb on the guided
missile cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, injuring five
sailors.
   By far the worst Navy accident this year was the explosion in a
turret of the battleship USS Iowa in April. The blast killed 47
sailors.
   Hoffman said he saw no connection between the recent Navy
accidents. Hoffman said the Navy has an excellent safety record.
   Johnson said he had no figures on how common it is for a sailor
to be washed overboard and lost.
   According to news reports, there have been at least four
incidents this year in which sailors have fallen or been swept from
vessels.

<HEAD>Indian Newspapers Single Out Gandhi in Payoff Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian newspapers on Tuesday published
documents they said show Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi may have been
personally involved in payoffs and cover-ups in the Bofors arms
scandal.
   The government issued a statement denying the reports, which
come barely three weeks before a national election in which
Gandhi's opponents have made corruption-in-government their battle
cry.
   Gandhi is fighting for his political life in what is expected to
be the closest election in India's 42 years of independence.
   Three major English-language Indian dailies carried the reports.
They were The Hindu and The Statesman, which are traditionally
independent, and the anti-Gandhi Indian Express.
   The Calcutta-based Statesman said: ``The possibility of the
Prime Minister himself being involved in the pay-offs and in
initiating cover-up operations in the wake of the Bofors disclosure
has finally emerged with references in official documents to
meetings between the representative of a company involved in the
pay-offs and a Gandhi `trustee lawyer.'''
   Indian Express, a nationwide paper and Gandhi's harshest critic
among the major media, was blunter, saying, ``Direct and
irrefutable evidence is now in hand ... which establishes the
direct involvement of the Prime Minister, Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, and his
intimates in the corrupt Bofors pay-off.''
   About nine hours after the newspapers reached readers, the
government information office issued a statement denying Gandhi was
involved.
   The scandal arises from a $1.4 billion contract signed in 1986
by Gandhi's government and the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors.
According to accounts previously published by Indian newspapers,
Bofors paid up to $50 million in kickbacks to beat out competitors
for the contract.
   Tuesday's newspaper reports were the most direct purported link
between Gandhi and the alleged payoffs. Previous reports spoke of
money going to people close to Gandhi.
   Gandhi repeatedly said he did not personally benefit from the
deal. He denied any commissions were paid or that any Indians
received payments.
   The latest stories focused on purported entries in a personal
diary kept by former Bofors company president Martin Ardbo.
   The key element, according to The Statesman and Indian Express,
is a handwritten entry that speaks of a meeting between an unnamed
``Gandhi trustee lawyer'' and a person identified only as ``Bob''
in Geneva on July 2, 1987.
   The newspapers said Bob was Robert Wilson, a former British army
major who headed AE Services, a company previously cited by Indian
and Swedish newspapers as a middleman in the Bofors contract.

<TEXT>
   China has issued regulations requiring all social
organizations to be registered and giving the state power to
disband any of the groups that are deemed undesirable, the official
press said Wednesday.
   The new rules, the first of their kind since 1950, say that no
social organization, including societies, research units,
foundations and chambers of commerce, will be legal unless approved
by appropriate authorities.
   On Tuesday, China's legislature also passed a law giving the
state broad powers to ban public rallies and demonstrations that it
deems to be threatening to social order or anti-government.
   The two measures are linked to government efforts to tighten
controls over public gatherings following the student movement this
spring in which up to 1 million people took to the streets of
Beijing to demonstrate for democratic reform.
   The movement, crushed by military force in June, also spawned
independent student and worker groups that the government has
labeled as illegal, anti-revolutionary and designed to overthrow
Communist rule in China.
   The new regulations state that social groups will be prohibited
from profit-making activities and that the Civil Affairs Ministry
and its departments will have the power to approve and disband
organizations.
   The China Daily said there are 1,100 national organizations and
about 100,000 local community groups. Many, it said, have an overly
close connection with government departments and some are
disrupting economic order by engaging in illegal businesses and
profiteering.
   It said secret societies and underworld gangs that existed
before the Communists came to power in 1949 have returned to some
lesser-developed and coastal areas.
   The daily quoted Civil Affairs Vice Minister Fan Baojun as
saying the new rules will ensure ordinary citizens' freedom of
association and define the legal rights of social groups.

   A 3-year-old boy was shot in the head
Tuesday with a pistol that police believe was part of a day care
worker's Halloween costume.
   Kenny Archer of Normangee was in serious in stable condition at
Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, about 90 miles southeast of
Bryan, said hospital spokeswoman Tina Foster.
   The child, whose breathing was being assisted by a ventilator,
was taken to Texas Children's after four hours of neurosurgery at
St. Joseph Hospital.
   Authorities said they planned to talk Wednesday with the owner
of Twice As Nice day care center in Normangee and a worker who
reportedly wore the .22-caliber handgun as part of a western
costume.
   ``I've heard that someone was dressed up for Halloween and had
their husband's pistol and didn't know it was loaded,'' said Leon
County Sheriff Royce Wilson.
   Wilson said he heard two accounts of the shooting Tuesday.
   ``One said the child reached and got the pistol and the other
said that another child got it,'' Wilson said.
   He said the interviews were delayed a day because of the shock
among the witnesses following the shooting.
   Workers at the day care center said they were told not to answer
questions, but to refer all calls to the center's owner, Janice
Roberts, who was not at the center at the time.
   Wilson and Leon County District Attorney David Barron said no
charges have been filed in the case pending the interviews
Wednesday.

   Soldiers raided a Buddhist shrine
where members of a radical group had taken refuge and killed a monk
who was the tactical planner for the underground organization, a
military official said Tuesday.
   He said the monk, Pasgodawaye Sarankere, was armed with an
automatic rifle and was shot when he tried to escape during
Monday's raid on a temple in Pattigolla, 48 miles southeast of
Colombo.
   The official, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said Sarankere was military coordinator of the People's Liberation
Front, the ultranationalist Sinhalese group fighting the government.
   Two other members of the front, both young Sinhalese men, were
also killed, he said. It was not immediately disclosed if the
soldiers suffered casualties or if any radicals escaped.
   The government reported at least 35 other killings in
Sinhalese-dominated southern and central Sri Lanka in the 24 hours
ending Tuesday evening.
   The bodies of 11 men were found in the central Kandy district
and in Gampaha, north of Colombo, the official said.
   The victims were believed to be radicals killed by vigilante
groups who support the government. The government denies it is
involved.
   The military official said nine Sinhalese men were killed by
radicals for giving information to the police. At least eight
radicals and two soldiers were killed in fighting between security
forces and members of the front across the Sinhalese heartland, he
said.
   Sinhalese radicals were believed responsible for detonating a
landmine under a police jeep in the central Anuradhapura district
on Tuesday. At least five policemen died, the official said.
   The front has fought to overthrow the government for more than
two years, saying too many concessions were given to the minority
Tamil community.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, make up 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and dominate the government and the
military. The mainly Hindu Tamils form 18 percent and claim they
are discriminated against in jobs and education by the majority
community.

   Union and school negotiators
reached a tentative agreement Tuesday, ending a 3-week-old strike
by 300 teachers that paralyzed education in this city of the rich
and famous.
   The agreement was subject to ratification by the Beverly Hills
Education Association and the city Board of Education, said board
President Dan Tomarken.
   The teachers were to meet Wednesday morning at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel to debate the agreement and cast ballots, said Stan
Kaplan, a strike captain and elementary-school teacher. A simple
majority vote was needed to approve the pact, Kaplan said.
   The Board of Education was to meet and consider the pact after
Wednesday's teacher vote.
   If approved by both sides, teachers would return to classes
Thursday, Kaplan said.
   The agreement was reached after more than 5{ hours of
negotiations that began in the morning. Details of the pact were
not released.
   Negotiators for the two sides reconvened late Tuesday to work
out further details of the agreement.
   About 200 of the district's 300 striking teachers marched
outside school district headquarters in a show of solidarity. Some
carried signs reading, ``Gucci Mentality _ Pic 'N' Save Salaries.''
   ``We've been hopeful that we could get back and we were a little
down this morning,'' said Beverly Hills High School teacher John
Borsum. ``But we're hopeful that we have a good, tentative
agreement here.''
   The school board had been facing increasing pressure from
parents, including some who threatened to recall the board if a
settlement was not reached. More than 100 angry parents and
students joined picketing teachers Monday to lobby for an end to
the strike.
   The strike was like few others, with teachers eating food
catered by trendy eateries. Parents volunteered more than $500,000
to fulfill teacher salary demands in Beverly Hills, which many
celebrities call home.
   About 300 of the school district's 315 teachers, counselors and
nurses walked off the job Oct. 16, seeking better pay.
   Starting pay for teachers is $21,604 annually, nearly $6,000
less than in neighboring Los Angeles. Top yearly pay for teachers
in Beverly Hills is $46,270, and averages $42,659.
   Ms. Tomarken said the school district may have to consider a
class-size increase, which the community has previously been
unwilling to accept. Beverly Hills averages 25 students per class,
while other districts average 36 students, she said.
   About 4,700 students attend classes at the city's four
elementary schools and one high school.

   Police arrested 51 juveniles who ignored a
Devil's Night curfew Tuesday night, the last night of the
traditional three-day Halloween arson outbreak, and firefighters
got some relief as the number of fires apparently dwindled.
   Few fires were reported Tuesday night. On Monday night, dozens
of blazes flared across the city in trash bins and abandoned
buildings, and at least five families' homes burned. There were no
injuries either day.
   Officials refused to disclose any information about fires until
Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, City Councilman Mel Ravitz
said that the number of blazes had already surpassed the 229 set
last year.
   ``We've got to find a way to either re-educate or incarcerate
those who engage in this sport,'' he said.
   Mayoral spokesman Bob Berg said 51 youths had been arrested by
10 p.m. Tuesday, raising the number arrested since Devil's Night
and the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew began Sunday to 385.
   Police arrested 165 youths Monday and 169 Sunday, said police
Sgt. Christoper Buck. Those arrests included four for investigation
of arson.
   During curfew, police are allowed to detain children under age
18 overnight if they are caught on the streets without a parent.
   Devils Night is a decades-old tradition, but youths went from
soaping windows to arson about 10 years ago.
   The blazes apparently peaked in 1984, when firefighters battled
808 blazes in the last three days of October. The number of fires
has declined steadily since then.
   Penny Thomas blamed Devil's Night revelers for a blaze that
flared in an abandoned house next door and destroyed her home
Monday night.
   ``The house just went to burning in the front and me and my
friends, we ran out of the house,'' Thomas said.
   Fire Capt. Amos Horton said arson that gutted another abandoned
house jumped to an occupied home before dawn Tuesday.
   ``We don't know what started it or who started it, but somebody
definitely started it,'' Horton said. ``When a place is going like
this is going, we know it was set.''
   Civilians have joined the battle against arson this year. About
30,000 signed up to patrol the streets, reporting curfew violators
and trying to spot fires before they spread.
   The strategy is aimed in part at relieving overworked
firefighters of patrolling so they can devote all their time to
dousing flames.

   Nearly half of the lake acreage in 34 states
is badly polluted or likely soon to become that way, the
Environmental Protection Agency said today.
   The EPA's latest survey of lake water quality shows that serious
pollution problems have impaired about one-fourth of more than 12
million acres of lakes examined in those states. Pollution
threatens similar impairment in another 20 percent of the lake
acres.
   While the causes for the lake pollution varied, three-fourths of
the pollution was attributed to agricultural and urban runoffs.
Another 11 percent was blamed on industrial or sewage releases and
the remainder to natural causes.
   Meanwhile, the EPA was named in a lawsuit Monday charging that
the agency has failed to develop national standards for toxic
pollution of public waterways.

   The Bush administration is exploring with the
Soviet Union a possible early superpower summit to discuss ways the
United States might help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev revamp his
country's faltering economy, U.S. officials say.
   The Washington Post in today's editions said a meeting between
President Bush and Gorbachev might be held as early as December at
a neutral site, perhaps on a ship in the Mediterranean.
   Two U.S. officials confirmed tentative discussions were under
way with Moscow, but declined to discuss the substance of the Post
report. ``It's on the right track,'' said one official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The planning is evidently being conducted in exceptional
secrecy. Other usually knowledgeable officials said they were
unaware of a possible early summit between Bush and Gorbachev.

   Hundreds of thousands of people in a half dozen
East German cities took to the streets to demand democratic change
on the eve of a trip by Egon Krenz to Moscow, his first foreign
journey as the country's leader.
   Krenz, who rose to power nearly two weeks ago amid a rising din
of demands for a more open society, was expected to hold talks with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on his government's approach to reform.
   Aktuelle Kamera, East Germany's main evening news program, said
about 300,000 people rallied Monday night in Leipzig, a city of
about 650,000, in what now seems a weekly ritual.
   Activists said many marchers demanded that the Communist Party
relinquish its monopoly on power. Witnesses also said the
protesters carried signs demanding free elections and the
legalization of opposition groups.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says
threats by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to suspend a truce
with the Contra rebels may be a prelude to Sandinista cancellation
of national elections set for February.
   ``I worry that they (the Sandinistas) may be trying to lay a
predicate to walk away from their commitment to hold elections,''
Baker said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press.
   However, Ortega insisted Monday the elections will be held.
   ``The elections are taking place in Nicaragua, period,'' Ortega
said, speaking through an interpreter in an interview with NBC
News. ``With Contra or without Contra they are going to take place,
definitely. With war or no war, that is, elections are taking
place.''

cruiser USS Reeves, blowing a gaping hole in the ship's bow and
injuring five sailors.
   The incident, which occurred while the cruiser was escorting the
aircraft carrier USS Midway on training operations in the Indian
Ocean, was the Navy's second major training accident in as many
days.
   On Sunday, a student pilot slammed a T-2 Buckeye into the

crew during training exercises off Florida.
   Navy spokesmen said the pilot of the single-seat F-A-18 Hornet
had just taken off from the Midway.

   In yet another Japanese takeover of an American

control of the company that owns the landmark Rockefeller Center
and Radio City Music Hall.
   The announcement late Monday by Mitsubishi, one of Japan's
largest real estate companies, follows last month's announced
takeover of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. by Japan's Sony
Corp. for $3.4 billion. It also continues a trend of major Japanese
real estate purchases in the United States.
   Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns and manages the 19-building
Rockefeller Center complex in midtown Manhattan, is a legacy of a
family whose name stands for American capitalism.
   The family, which controls the private company, traces its
fortune to John D. Rockefeller, who founded the Standard Oil trust.

<HEAD>Jessica Hahn: First PTL, Now a Heavy Metal-Mud Wrestling Special</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Let history record that on Nov. 10, those
willing to pay $9.50 for some, er, culture can see ``Thunder and
Mud,'' a pay-TV special that features heavy metal rock, female mud
wrestling and ... Jessica Hahn.
   There may be those who say, ``You're kidding.''
   To them, Jessica Hahn would say that there will be such a show,
that it runs 90 minutes, that she is the hostess and that ``it's
not `Masterpiece Theater.' It's a little crazy.''
   ``I'm just there for the p.r., if you ask me,'' says the former
church secretary, whose sexual encounter with television evangelist
Jim Bakker led to his loss of his PTL empire in 1987.
   Bakker has been sentenced to 45 years in prison and fined
$500,000 for defrauding his followers for his own enrichment. Hahn
now lives in West Hollywood, Calif., where she gave several
interviews about him last week.
   She told reporters she wasn't satisfied with the sentence given
Bakker. She is pretty much talked out about him, she now says. But
she's fully aware that ``it's always going to be identified with me
because, in one sentence here and there (in interviews), I'm always
asked about it.''
   A cheerful-sounding woman, despite occasional verbal rocks cast
at her by those who are without sin, Hahn readily acknowledges that
her ``Thunder and Mud'' stint and earlier entertainment ventures
are due to the publicity she got when the Bakker matter first
surfaced.
   ``Of course. One thing led to another,'' she says. She cites her
Playboy magazine appearance, talk show visits, and frequent on-air
joking with Howard Stern, the much-publicized bad boy of New York
radio.
   ``He's a crazy man, but I love him,'' says Hahn.
   Last year, she also was featured in a ``Wild Thing'' video that
aired on MTV. The video spoofed rock videos and starred Sam
Kinison, the comic who screams.
   ``He sang `Wild Thing' or screamed it, whichever, and I kind of
fooled around,'' she says. She describes her latest venture, taped
last month, as ``kind of a battle of the bands with a twist.''
   The twist is that female mud wrestlers grapple with each other
while rock bands grapple with music. Each wrestler, she says,
represents a different band. The bands have names like Nuclear
Assault, Tuff, and She-Rok.
   The show is directed by Penelope Spheeris who, a press release
says, produced the Albert Brooks movie, ``Real Life,'' and directed
documentaries that include ``Hollywood Vice Squad'' and ``Dudes.''
   ``I've got mud in front of me and heavy metal behind me,'' Hahn
says of her rock-and-mud show. ``The girls all look great _ I felt
like their grandmother,'' she adds.
   Hahn, who is 30, is asked if she worries that some will say the
Nov. 10 show is denigrating to women. She says no. ``It's simply
fun television. It's just entertaining. It's silly. We're not
claiming to be brain surgeons.''
   She is not certain of her next project, she says, or even if
she'll try to make show business a career. ``People have been
calling me to do a record, but I think, `What gives you people the
impression I can sing?'
   ``But they don't care ... they just want somebody with a name
that they can promote, I guess.''

   But Palmer, who also is considering other possibilities, isn't
yet negotiating with WTVJ officials about anchoring there,

talking about ways to keep him at the network in some capacity, if
not at ``Sunrise,'' she says.
   There has been speculation that Mary Alice Williams would
succeed him at ``Sunrise'' if he left. But there has been no
decision yet on who will take his job if he leaves NBC, Hubble said.

<HEAD>Dole Gets the Message: No New Taxes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It may take White House tutoring in remedial
lip-reading to keep Republicans in line with President Bush's
across-the-board vow that there will be no new taxes.
   There's been some GOP talk about boosting the federal gasoline
tax, notably by the Senate Republican leader. That's an idea that
has been advanced before, usually by Democrats, to raise money and
promote energy conservation at the same time.
   A gas tax boost is one Bush vehemently ruled out when he was a
candidate, and his spokesman did so again the other day. Democratic
leaders already had said they were not going to risk advocating a
tax increase the president would block and the GOP would use
against them later.
   ``Everyone has read his lips...'' said Sen. George Mitchell,
D-Maine, the majority leader.
   But Sen. Robert J. Dole of Kansas, the GOP leader, said he would
be for an increase as long as the money it raised went to finance
the highway system, and wasn't earmarked to reduce the national
debt as sometimes has been proposed. ``I would support a gas tax
increase for rebuilding the infrastructure, not for debt
reduction,'' Dole said Sunday.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said earlier that he would support a
gas tax increase if needed to rebuild earthquake-damaged highways
in the state where he's running for governor next year.
   But there's no real chance the tax, now 9.1 cents a gallon, is
going to be increased. Bush isn't budging, and Democratic
congressional leaders are not going to take on the political burden
of pushing an unpopular tax increase against his opposition.
   The new round of tax talk grew out of the need for disaster
funds, for California and to repair the damage caused by Hurricane
Hugo in the East.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said when the Senate
passed a disaster relief appropriation that the earthquake and
hurricane ``should have awakened us to the fact that we do not have
the revenues we need to build and maintain vital physical
infrastructure ...''
   He said Bush had an opportunity to say so, despite his campaign
refrain that he would tell Congress: ``Read my lips _ no new
taxes.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, was advocating an increase in the gasoline tax
long before the disaster hit.
   So has Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
who said a higher tax would encourage conservation and lower
American dependence on foreign oil, which is increasing steadily.
   Each one cent increase in the federal gasoline tax raises about
$1 billion a year, a prospect that led to earlier proposals for a
sharp increase to reduce the federal deficit. Gas tax revenues go
into the highway trust fund; roadbuilders, the oil industry and
allied interests are determined to keep it that way.
   Dole, appearing on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press,'' said
he'd read Bush's lips, too, and hadn't forgotten the injunction
against new taxes, but wouldn't consider a roadbuilding gas tax to
be a major increase.
   The distinction did not register at the White House. ``We do not
feel that an increase in federal gas taxes is necessary at this
time,'' said Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   When the government began the interstate highway system in 1956,
it was to be financed by a federal gasoline tax of 3 cents a
gallon. Advocates of an increase say that if the gasoline tax had
kept pace with inflation, it would now be at least 13 cents a
gallon instead of 9.1.
   With gasoline prices down, petroleum imports are increasing. In
July, oil imports accounted for more than half of U.S. consumption
for the first time in a dozen years. The Department of Energy
estimates that the import rate will reach 65 percent by the year
2,000.
   ``We are getting back into all the old habits, getting more and
more dependent on foreign oil,'' Moynihan said.
   But the idea Dole endorsed isn't going anywhere without Bush,
which means it isn't going anywhere. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., said he favors an increase, but would push one only if it
came with an ironclad Bush endorsement.
   ``We're not going to engage in a kamikaze effort to raise
taxes,'' Mitchell said.

   Holy box office! What's a caped crusader to
do? After being the hit of the summer, he's the flop of the fall _
in Norway, at least.
   Despite an extensive promotional campaign here, the megabuck
smash movie ``Batman,'' has been upstaged at the box office by
``Licence to Kill'' and ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   In Norway, even Donald Duck has been more popular than the
Batman comic for decades.
   Inspired by its worldwide success _ the movie has grossed more
than $248 million at the U.S. box office alone, and has set
all-time opening weekend records in Italy, Spain, Mexico, Portugal
and Britain _ the film's distributor hoped to trigger a little
Batmania in Norway.
   Warner Bros. Norge AS, the movie's distributor, wallpapered much
of Norway with Batman posters and stickers, in its biggest
promotion campaign ever in this small Scandinavian country.
   ``Batwho?'' responded Norwegians.
   Few had heard of Batman, even under his Norwegian comic book
name, Lynvingen, or Lightning Wing. When the comic first appeared
here in 1953, Lynvingen was the name chosen because Batman,
literally translated, means something like the Fluttering Mouse Man.
   Warner Bros. Norge kept the original title, ``Batman,'' for the
movie and set out to make it a household word with a promotion
campaign that was unusually agressive by Norwegian standards.
   Newspapers widely reported the hubbub preceding the film, which
inspired such inventions as Batdances and Batdrinks. Norwegians who
were caught up in the fad bought Batman hats, T-shirts, posters,
toys and trinkets, all emblazoned with the familiar winged
silouette.
   But few bought tickets to the movie.
   Batman got walloped at the box office during the first two weeks
after the movie's opening Oct. 5. It drew 26,427 in Oslo, compared
to 50,761 for the James Bond film ``Licence to Kill'' and 51,133
for ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' according to the Oslo
Muncipal Cinemas, which rated the sales as ``not good.''
   When the blockbuster premiered in 36 Norwegian cities, many of
the 40 theaters were less than one-third full.
   ```Batman' hasn't played to our expectations,'' said Lillemor
Kosell, of Warner Bros. ```Batman' is somewhat of an American
phenomenon. People don't know him very well. This was by far the
biggest promotion we ever attempted here.'' She refused to disclose
the amount spent.
   Among critics, Batmania became Batmoania. One wrote, ``Batman
was better before he got here.''
   The movie's billboards, posters and full-page newspaper
advertisements succeeded in spreading Batman's name, but in the
weeks before the premiere many Norwegians still wondered why he
climbed around on buildings in his pajamas and a cape.
   Anders Giaever, a reporter and comic book collector, tried to
help with ``The Beginners Guide to Batman,'' published in the Oslo
daily Arbeiderbladet.
   ``The whole thing is a little foreign,'' said Giaever.
``Norwegians don't have the background. Most haven't seen the
comic, and the TV series was never shown here.''
   But the modest level of Batmania in Norway has nothing to do
with comic books, movies, television or even Batman, said Gro
Svendsen of the Oslo department store Steen and Stroem, which sells
Batman hats and T-shirts.
   ``Norwegians read so much about Batmania in America that it's
the fad, the fashion itself, they are interested in,'' she said.
   ``Sales are nothing phenomenal, compared to products inspired by
a film like `E.T.' But Batman T-shirts are big with the skateboard
set.''
   The ``skateboard set,'' 12- to 14-year-olds, might have flocked
to the movie had the the age limit not been set at 15, Kosell said.
The state film control board deemed ``Batman'' too violent for
children.
   Kjell Johnsen, the 22-year-old editor of the local ``Batman''
comic, ``Linvingen,'' said the movie might boost his comic's sales,
which are lackluster compared to Donald Duck and other best sellers.
   One happy note for Gotham City's dark prince, because of Warner
Bros.' promotion, the comic book's name will be changed back to
Batman.

   In kitchens, at factories and on construction sites
across Japan, foreigners are doing jobs the Japanese no longer want
to do, shaking up a country unaccustomed to living with people of
different colors.
   Japan's growing reputation in the Third World as a promised land
is attracting workers from Pakistan and Bangladesh who can earn as
much in a day as they can in weeks or even months back home.
   Chinese eager to make their fortune come posing as Vietnamese
boat people in hopes of gaining political asylum, and Africans
ignore local prejudices against blacks to earn money to send home.
   The estimated 100,000 or so illegal workers and tens of
thousands of working foreign students have an influence far beyond
their numbers in a population of 120 million.
   Tokyo commuter trains used to be a sea of smooth black hair and
familiar Japanese faces; everyone talked the same language. Now
occasional black and dark brown faces and strange tongues are
making Japanese fidget in their seats.
   Heavy television coverage of boat people and foreign workers is
bringing the issue into the living rooms of millions, while
hundreds of thousands are working side by side with non-Japanese
for the first time.
   Some press comment has been thoughtful.
   ``Is it possible for us to enjoy such affluence separate from
the rest of the world, especially the people of neighboring
countries?'' Mainichi Shimbun said in an editorial.
   But other writers, noting the 1 billion people in neighboring
China, have raised visions of aliens pouring in faster than
Mexicans to the United States. Letters to the editor pages have
been flooded with fears of cultural invasion, crime and crowding.
   A 150-minute television program on foreign workers by Japan
Broadcasting Corp. in May brought calls from 1,000 viewers _ 20
times the usual number for such programs, a local press report
said. For every person arguing to let in foreign workers, two said
it was a bad idea.
   ``Foreign Workers Will Destroy Japan'' is the subtitle of a book
by critic Kanji Nishio. The book, with a large padlock pictured on
the cover, is called ``Recommendation for a Closed Country (Sakoku)
in Labor,'' using the same word that shoguns used to ban foreigners
from Japanese shores for centuries.
   Generally favoring entry for foreign workers are small
businessmen, thousands of whom have gone bankrupt because of a
severe labor shortage. For part-time jobs in such fields as
construction and restaurants, openings outnumber available workers
three or four to one.
   Owners of small labor-intensive factories have deluged refugee
authorities with job offers for the boat people, even as mass
deportations are being arranged.
   ``If it weren't for these foreign workers, we'd go under,'' says
Kenichi Masuda. In his family's century-old cast-iron foundry,
elderly Japanese blackened from head to toe with soot shovel coke
from the dirt floor into a furnace and pour molten iron into molds
in a dimly lit wooden building.
   ``Young Japanese don't want to do this dangerous, dirty work,''
Masuda shouts above the clank of machinery, pointing out a Chinese
working for him legally on a government training program.
   At a neighboring foundry, 29-year-old Paul Aduna from Ghana in
Africa works for 900 yen ($6.42) an hour under the same program,
originally designed to transfer manufacturing skills to developing
countries.
   At 6:30 a.m., at a recruiting center for day laborers in Tokyo,
crew-cut construction foremen pass over the few aging Japanese men
reclining on cardboard and reeking of alcohol.
   Young, eager, neatly dressed Chinese students wave away an offer
of 800 yen (about $6) an hour, about 25 times what they'd make in
China.
   ``Too cheap. He's crazy,'' one says.
   With an offer of 1,250 yen (about $9), the Chinese pile into a
van to be taken to a construction site.
   ``I used to work in New York,'' says ``George,'' a Malaysian who
asked that his name not be used. ``But the money is a lot better
here.''
   In the sprawling neon jungle of Kabukicho, Tokyo's answer to New
York's 42nd Street, thousands of women from the Philippines,
Thailand and Korea work in bars, sex shows and prostitution, most
brought in by Japanese gangsters.
   In Tokyo's immigration office, Thais, Ghanaians, Bangladeshis,
Pakistanis and Chinese stand in endless lines, hoping in a Babel of
languages to persuade bureaucrats to let them stay a few more
months.
   Most foreign laborers work illegally after entry on tourist
visas or student visas that allow only part-time work. Unlike many
developed countries, Japan has no legal provision to allow
foreigners to enter as unskilled laborers.
   Big business and the government want to keep it that way.
Although small businesses lobby the government to allow more
foreign workers, industry leaders argue for greater investment in
machines to solve labor shortages.
   Even many Japanese who want foreign workers for temporary help
worry that they will settle here and disturb Japan's ``social
harmony.'' But many of the foreigners, stung by Japanese prejudice,
say they don't want to stay.
   A 25-year-old Chinese woman said she came in part because of
Japan's reputation as an advanced country, in part because of the
``Japan millionaires'' returning to her hometown to build big
houses and flourishing businesses with their Tokyo earnings.
   A Japanese-Chinese translator in China, she and her technician
husband came on student visas and work long hours after classes.
Their dream, she says, was to ``learn about Japanese business and
technology and build a powerful Japanese-style conglomerate back in
China'' _ or at least save some money and start a small business.
   But now, after months working in a dry cleaning shop and then in
a Japanese pub, she says she's disappointed in a country she used
to admire, even though she earns in a day what would take a month
in China.
   ``Materially the Japanese are very advanced, but not
spiritually,'' she says. ``If you are white, they treat you well.
But if you are dark-skinned or Asian, they look down on you.''
   She said some coworkers taunted her after they saw Chinese boat
people on television, saying, ``Why don't your people stay where
they belong?''
   ``I tell them we are like bus, no matter how many you squash,
more come back,'' she said.

   After years of tight budgets, American
scientists hope the 1990s will introduce a new ``golden age'' of
space exploration. This is one of a periodic series of articles,
``The '90s,'' looking ahead to the promise and peril of the
upcoming decade, in the environment, medicine, technology and
society.

   The manned station Freedom, an
orbiting outpost of America in the icy silence of space, will take
center stage in the U.S. space effort in the 1990s, and be a
springboard for human journeys to the moon and Mars.
   American scientists also expect to reap a rich harvest during
the decade with an armada of sophisticated unmanned spacecraft that
will explore the planets and peer back into the beginning of time.
   At the same time, the Soviets will continue development of a
space shuttle and exploit their own space station Mir as they
pursue their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to Mars early in
the 21st century.
   And the growing space programs of the European Space Agency,
Japan and China will expand as they embark on their own manned
space efforts.
   As the new decade begins, America's future course is uncertain.
Its space program is at a crossroads, and it will be up to the Bush
administration, the Congress and the people to decide which
direction it should take.
   In July, on the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the
moon, President Bush stood on the steps of the National Air and
Space Museum and declared, ``We must commit ourselves anew to a
sustained program of manned exploration of the solar system, and,
yes, the permanent settlement of space.''
   He proposed ``a long-term, continuing commitment'' to completion
of space station Freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base on
the moon and a manned mission to Mars early in the next century.
   But the president provided no firm timetable or budgets for such
grand schemes, instead directing Vice President Dan Quayle, as head
of the National Space Council, to work out the details.
   Bush is expected to offer a more detailed plan in his State of
the Union address early next year.
   Freedom is the key element in the entire exploration plan, since
it would serve as a training base and launchpad for the more
ambitious flights to the moon and Mars.
   But the space station has had a troubled history. The original
plan called for astronauts aboard space shuttles to begin
assembling it in orbit in 1992, with a total of 20 shuttle flights
needed to have it fully operational by 1995.
   Cost overruns, budget cuts and NASA's poor job of selling the
station to a skeptical Congress have delayed the project, and
initial assembly is now scheduled to start in 1995 or 1996.
   The U.S. cost will be about $25 billion, with European, Japanese
and Canadian partners contributing modules and other station
facilities worth an additional $8 billion. This will give
astronaut-researchers of these nations access to the station and
provide them with valuable experience for developing independent
manned space programs.
   Orbiting 250 miles up, the station would provide living and
working quarters for as many as eight people, with astronauts
rotating back to Earth after four to six months. Some would stay
longer to gain long-term exposure to weightless living, in
preparation for a Mars flight that might take as long as 18 months.
   As a scientific base, the station will allow humans to study the
stars and planets from the pollution-free environment of space. The
weightless world will permit the processing of new, pure medicines,
metals and other products that cannot be made in Earth's gravity.
And astronauts aboard Freedom would assemble, service and repair
satellites and send them out to explore space.
   Space science is experiencing a resurgence after years of
neglect because of tight NASA budgets.
   ``We are embarking on a golden age of space science,'' said
Lennard Fisk, the agency's associate administrator for space
science and applications. ``What's coming up is an era of
unprecedented excitement and activity.''
   Among the events scheduled in the 1990s:
   _Magellan, launched from a space shuttle last May, is to orbit
Venus next August and will study that planet for several years.
   _Galileo, launched from a shuttle in October, is to orbit
Jupiter in 1995 and fire a probe into its atmosphere. En route,
Galileo will probe Venus and take the first closeup look at an
asteroid.
   _COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer), set for launch Nov. 19, will
spend years studying how stars and galaxies were formed by
analyzing cosmic background radiation consisting of particles of
light, or photons, permeating the universe.
   _ROSAT, a cooperative mission with West Germany, will be
launched next year to send back a detailed survey of X-rays emitted
into the universe by violent explosions, such as those occurring at
the end of a star's life.
   _Hubble Space Telescope, to be launched from a shuttle next
March, will enable astronomers to observe stars and galaxies so far
away that they will be viewing these remote bodies as they existed
14 billion years ago, near the time scientists believe the universe
was formed.
   _Mars Observer will be launched in 1992 to orbit the red planet
for a multiyear examination.
   _Other payloads scheduled for deployment from the shuttle in the
next few years include a series of Astro spacecraft carrying
ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes to study quasars, pulsars and
other celestial objects; the Gamma Ray Observatory to explore gamma
ray sources throughout the universe, and Ulysses, to probe the sun.
   During the 1990s, NASA will also continue research, together
with the Defense Department, on developing the National Aerospace
Plane, which would take off from a runway like a jet plane and
accelerate into orbit. If Congress provides adequate funding for
this next-generation manned space vehicle, a prototype could begin
test flights late in the decade, and it could become operational
sometime after 2000.

   Astronomers soon will be able to
look out almost to the beginning of time, to study how the universe
began and how it has evolved.
   Their ``window'' will be the Hubble Space Telescope, the most
expensive, most finely crafted unmanned space vehicle ever built.
   Scheduled for release into Earth orbit next March by a space
shuttle crew, the $1.7 billion telescope will become astronomy's
most significant tool in expanding our knowledge of the universe
during the 1990s and into the 21st century.
   ``It will be one of the premier science missions of this
century,'' said Lennard Fisk, director of space sciences for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Orbiting 370 miles high, this 25,500-pound, 43.5-foot-long
package of precision instruments will look seven times more deeply
into space, detect objects 50 times fainter and view them with 10
times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory, thus
expanding the universe visible to humans by 350 times.
   At the heart of the telescope, named for Edwin P. Hubble, a
trailblazing American astronomer of the 1920s, is a 94.5-inch
primary optical mirror, the most precise ever made. There is no
bump or ripple on its highly polished surface that deviates more
than one-millionth of an inch from an ideally perfect curve.
   From its vantage point outside Earth's murky atmosphere, the
telescope will be able to probe a distance of 14 billion light
years, offering views of galaxies so distant they will appear as
they were when the universe was formed. The best ground telescopes
look back only 8 billion years.
   Astronomers enhancing the telescope's images with computers will
gain new knowledge about black holes, pulsars, cosmic dust clouds,
gaseous nebulae, supernovae, neutron stars, quasars and other
celestial mysteries.
   Said James Westphal, a California Institute of Technology
planetary scientist, ``I suspect that we will find some amazing
things that will thrill the public, not once a year but maybe once
a month.''

<TEXT>
   After two Academy Award-nominated portrayals
of vindictive women, versatile Glenn Close returns in another
guise: as a married woman seeking to adopt the baby of an unwed
teen-ager.
   ``Immediate Family'' is the apt title of the Columbia Pictures
release in which Close and James Woods play a childless couple who
seek the child of young Mary Stuart Masterson and her
leather-jacketed boyfriend, Kevin Dillon.
   ``It's a phenomenon in this country called `open adoption,'''
explained Close. ``Instead of there being a big mystery about who
the parents are and where they came from _ they used to seal the
files, especially from the child _ as a reaction to that, it's open
who the parents are. The adoptive parents and the birth parents, as
they're called, get together. It really is the decision of the
birth mother as to who she going to give the child to.''
   What happens if the birth mother changes her mind later?
   ``It's very difficult after all the legal procedures to get a
child back,'' she said. ``There is that horrible period between
when you're given the child and everything is taken care of legally
when the mother can change her mind, and many women do, I think.
That's the terrible emotional minefield.
   ``Once the (legalities) are done, it's hard to reverse it. I
don't know the statistics on how often that happens. I know people
who send Christmas cards to the birth mother, and people who
correspond more than that. I would think that the child would want
to know who the mother is, have pictures of her and maybe even meet
her. He would consider adoptive parents as parents, what they
really are. That's the world that he knows.''
   ``Immediate Family'' follows two stunning portrayals for Close:
as the murderous career woman in ``Fatal Attraction'' and the
scheming Marquise de Merteuil in ``Dangerous Liaisons.'' In both
films she wreaked dire revenge on men who had spurned her, but she
doesn't consider the women evil.
   ``A tragic victim ... out of control,'' is her assessment of the
``Fatal Attraction'' protagonist.
   ``And I think ultimately the Marquise de Merteuil is a victim of
her society,'' she added. ``That's my subjective viewpoint. Yeah,
they were dangerous people. But they were also trying to survive.''
   Is it possible to play a role without feeling any sympathy for
the character?
   ``I don't think it is. Whenever I approach a role, there always
has to be a place where I can identify with her humanity, and
basically love them.''
   Close gives dimension to her role as the barren Linda Spector in
``Immediate Family.'' What helped with Barbara Benedek's script,
she said, ``was its wonderful sense of humor. For all the pain that
Linda and Michael are going through, they also have a sense of
humor about themselves, and about life. It helps to get through the
hard times.''
   She found close parallels between Glenn and Linda, though their
histories are different. After two childless marriages and two
divorces, she gave birth to Annie Maude seven weeks before starting
``Dangerous Liaisons.'' She lives with the father, producer John
Starke.
   Glenn (named after her godmother) Close was born May 19, 1947,
in Greenwich, Conn., the middle of three children of a well-to-do
family.
   ``When I was really little, the golden age of Walt Disney made a
huge impression on me,'' she recalled. ```The Littlest Outlaw,'
`Old Yeller,' `The Vanishing Prairie,' `The Living Desert' ...
vivid movies for a child, wonderful, wonderful movies.
   ``That had a lot to do with my fantasy life of wanting to be an
actor, to be in movies like that. I grew up in the country, and my
parents were quite _ actually antisocial. We had a great
upbringing; we could have been in Iowa. We were very near to New
York, but we only went in to see `The Nutcracker Suite' and the
Barnum and Bailey circus and to have our eyes examined.''
   She admitted that her parents were concerned when she left home
to pursue an acting career in New York: ``I come from a very Yankee
family with Yankee values. I was quite an elusive child. I had a
very active imagination. I was a bookworm and a tomboy and very
shy. My parents didn't know what acting would elicit from me. But
I've proven to them that it's fine for my character.''
   Close was a latecomer to films, starting with ``The World
According to Garp,'' playing Robin Williams' mother when she was
34. Why didn't she begin earlier?
   ``Circumstance,'' she replied. ``I was working in theater, and
I've never been good at auditioning. I feel almost characterless
when I'm put in that kind of position. I don't know how to promote
myself. Because I'm an actor, I would not be playing myself. It's a
strange, horrible, limbo situation.
   ``And I don't think people really knew what to do with me. I'd
been doing theater, but a lot of people don't see theater. So it
just had to have that time and place, which was `Barnum' (on
Broadway) and George Roy Hill, who put me in `Garp' after seeing me
in `Barnum'.''
   Filmmakers found out what to do with her. The results have
produced five Academy nominations. They are: ``Garp,'' ``The Big
Chill,'' ``The Natural,'' ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``Dangerous
Liaisons.''
   She kids about the fact that she has been a five-time bridesmaid
without becoming a bride at the Oscars: ``Well, I'm not married in
life. So we'll see.''

   The Supreme Court has agreed to resolve a
dispute that could put at risk the federal protection for the
pensions of 30 million U.S. workers.
   The justices said Monday they will decide what authority the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal agency, has to order
employers to revive scraped pension plans.
   A federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside
the agency's order that LTV Corp. and a subsidiary, LTV Steel Co.,
restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of $2.3

   In yet another Japanese takeover of an American
institution, Mitsubishi Estate Co. plans to pay $846 million for
control of the company that owns Rockefeller Center and Radio City
Music Hall.
   The announcement late Monday by Mitsubishi, one of Japan's
largest real estate companies, follows last month's takeover of
Columbia Pictures by Sony Corp. for $3.4 billion.
   Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns and manages the 19-building
Rockefeller Center office complex in Manhattan, is a legacy of a
family whose name stands for American capitalism. The family, which
controls the private company, traces its fortune to John D.
Rockefeller, who founded the Standard Oil trust.

   The House Banking Committee chairman has told

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
he doesn't want the power over airline takeovers that a bill
pending in Congress would give him.
   The House planned today to take up the Air Carrier Securities
Act, which would require the Transportation Department to block
purchase of 15 percent or more of an airline if the sale threatened
to hinder safety, reduce competition, break up the carrier or put
it under foreign control.
   Skinner made the comment Monday in an interview.

<HEAD>Interest Rates Up on Treasury Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction, which included a couple of
unusual twists to enable continued operation of the government
despite a decline in its borrowing authority.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.8 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.78 percent, up from 7.52 percent
last week.
   Another $7.8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 7.62 percent, up from 7.5 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since Oct. 2, when three-month bills
sold for 7.83 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.92 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.05 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,799.00 and 8.04 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,610.50.
   Monday's auction differed from the usual weekly sale in two ways
because of the expected drop in the government's debt ceiling at
midnight Tuesday from $2.87 trillion to $2.8 trillion.
   To ensure that the lower ceiling does not stop Social Security
checks from going out this week, the Treasury Department required
buyers of the three-and six-month bills to pay for those securities
Tuesday rather than on Thursday as usually would be the case.
   And the Treasury auctioned an additional $2 billion on Monday to
take full advantage of the $2.87 trillion borrowing authority
before it expires on Tuesday.
   The average discount rate for the new 51-day bills was 7.87
percent. But it too understates the actual return to investors _
8.07 percent for a $10,000 bill selling for $9,888.50.
   The House has voted to raise the debt ceiling to $3.1 trillion
for the current fiscal year, but Senate legislation has been
blocked by a squabble over whether to cut the capital gains tax.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for 1-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for
making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 7.81 percent
last week, down from 7.85 percent the previous week.

   Swiss police said they arrested a former
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. investment banker in connection
with the alleged embezzlement of $2.2 million from the New York
bank's Geneva office.
   A Manufacturers Hanover spokesman, John Stefans, confirmed in
New York that ``irregularities concerning customer accounts were
discovered in our Geneva office'' and that Swiss authorities were
investigating.
   Swiss court officials said Konstantin Phacos, 39, was arrested
last week and was being held during the investigation of the
alleged embezzlement, which the officials said took place over the
past three years.
   Stefans declined to confirm the amount of money allegedly
embezzled, but he said Phacos had been dismissed from the bank.
Stefans refused further comment while the police investigation was
under way.
   The spokesman said losses like those that occurred in the Geneva
office are normally covered by insurance and do not affect the
company's earnings.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is
reviewing its senior credit ratings on about $4.8 billion in
long-term debt of Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. with the
possibility of lowering the ratings.
   Shearson is a leading financial services company whose holdings
include the principal broker-dealer subsidiary Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Moody's, a leading debt-rating agency, cited ``sharpening
competition in the securities business'' as well as profit problems
at Shearson's Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. subsidiary for the
review.
   It said Monday that Boston Safe has been a major contributor to
Shearson's earnings, but recent profit problems there could
adversely affect Shearson's future returns.
   The agency said it also was concerned about Shearson's
``substantial commercial real estate exposure via its Balcor
subsidiary.''
   Moody's said it planned to review ``the prospects for and the
quality of these assets.''
   The rating agency also said it would examine Shearson's tangible
capital levels, which it said were low and were weakened by
accounting for goodwill expanded in Shearson's January 1988
acquisition of E.F. Hutton Group.
   ``In addition, Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings has a significant
level of double leverage, which is the use of debt to fund equity
investments in subsidiaries. This significant double leverage
weakens debtholder protection measures,'' the statement said.
   A spokesman for Shearson said the company had no comment on the
Moody's announcement, but would cooperate in the review.

<HEAD>Liquor Marketers Plan Unusual Holiday Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For liquor marketers, 'tis the season to be
inventive.
   As the Christmas season approaches, liquor makers and importers
have come up with magazine ads that ``talk'' when the page is
opened, dazzle with a hologram and provide peel-and-stick decals to
liven up a dull party scene.
   The ads, which are each costing $500,000 to several million
dollars to produce and place in magazines ranging from Business
Week to Rolling Stone, are designed to boost sales at a critical
time of year for the liquor industry.
   Liquor industry analysts said the holiday season, which includes
Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day, accounts for 30 percent
to 40 percent of annual sales in some categories of the distilled
spirits business, an industry with little to cheer about in recent
years.
   Health concerns, tougher enforcement of drunken-driving laws, an
increase in the legal drinking age to 21 and calls for tougher
restrictions on liquor marketing have taken a toll on consumption
of alcoholic beverages.
   According to the Distilled Spirits Council, per capita
consumption of liquor fell 3.1 percent to 1.54 gallons last year
from 1.59 gallons in 1987. It has fallen every year since peaking
at 2 gallons per person in 1978.
   John Maxwell Jr., who follows the beverage industry for the
investment firm Wheat First Securities Inc. in Richmond, Va., said
consumption of all alcoholic beverages has been declining due to
liftestyle changes.
   But the products promoted in some of this year's unusual holiday
ads are among those categories that claim sales growth.
   The House of Seagram, for instance, is spending an estimated $3
million to $4 million on offbeat ads for Chivas Regal Scotch whisky
and Crown Royal Canadian whisky.
   The four-page Chivas ad, which will appear in holiday issues of
Newsweek and Business Week, among others, asks the question, ``What
if you don't give Chivas Regal for Christmas?''
   Readers _ presumably rich ones _ are invited to tear away tabs
that reveal the humorous consequences of failing to give Chivas to
people like the gardener or the pool man. (Answers: The gardener
may pave the lawn, while the pool man could put sharks in the pool.)
   In an ad for Crown Royal, Seagram has a fold-out photograph of
eight bored partygoers stewing in an elegantly furnished room. The
ad carries 15 peel-and-stick decals with items such as Santa's
elves hats and boxer shorts with kisses that readers can use to
liven up the stuffy drawing-room scene.
   The Crown Royal ad is appearing in Rolling Stone and GQ, among
others.
   Thomas K. McInerney, executive vice president for marketing at
House of Seagram, said he hopes readers will have some fun with the
ads.
   ``If we can get them to stop for 15 seconds or 30 seconds, that
would be a success,'' he said.
   If readers have fun with an ad, the theory is they become more
favorably disposed toward the product and will remember the brand
name when stocking up for a holiday party or buying a gift.
   Absolut Vodka has come up with a ``talking'' ad that uses a
microchip to offer spoken holiday greetings in metallic-sounding
English, Italian and Spanish each time its ad is opened.
   Absolut is spending $1.2 million to include the ad in 200,000
December issues sent to Vanity Fair subscribers in New York State
and California.
   Finlandia Vodka is using a hologram that shows a bottle of the
drink and the outline of two reindeer in combat on the label in an
ad that will appear in the yearend double issue of Rolling Stone
distributed in New York, Chicago and California and the Christmas
Gifts issue of New York magazine.
   The ad cost about $500,000 to produce and place in the
magazines, and is being billed as the first liquor ad to use one of
the 3-D images.
   McDonald's Corp. used a hologram for a 1988 ad that appeared on
the back cover of National Geographic, which also had a hologram on
the front cover.
   Jim Beam Brands Co. decided to make a variation of its new ad
campaign that shows evolving consumer tastes in everything from
sandwiches to underwear.
   In its Christmas ad for Jim Beam bourbon, the company shows the
evolution of the Christmas tree from 1952 to the present from
standard evergreen to flocked to metallic to sculpted and back to
evergreen again.
   ``You always come back to the basics,'' is the message that will
appear in 17 different publications this holiday season, including
Playboy, Working Woman and Self.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appears to be
hardening her position against linking the British pound to other
European currencies despite mounting pressure from her own
Conservative party.
   The growing impression is that Mrs. Thatcher is using an
increasing number of conditions as a pretext not to link the pound
to the 10-year-old exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System. The EMS links the currencies of nine of the 12 Common
Market nations to prevent wide currency swings.
   Since Spain joined in June, only Britain, Greece and Portugal
are outside the system.
   Economists now don't expect the pound to be linked before the
next general election, which Mrs. Thatcher must call before
mid-1992.
   Nations linked to the mechanism enjoy currency stability that
helps industry and Common Market planning. But they relinquish
control over an important element of their monetary affairs.
   The European Economic Community is working toward European
monetary union, which would create a single European currency and a
single central bank for the nations.
   But Mrs. Thatcher opposes relinquishing British sovereignty and
champions free-market policies.
   The issue of British participation in the exchange rate
mechanism was seen as central in Thursday's sudden resignation of
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, which created a Cabinet
crisis and shook British financial markets.
   Lawson, who advocated joining the mechanism, said he couldn't
continue to serve in his post as long as Mrs. Thatcher's personal
economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, stayed. Walters, who called the
system ``half-baked,'' resigned hours later.
   The pound has fallen sharply in recent weeks, fueling inflation
fears and prompting the government to push interest rates to an
eight-year high of 15 percent as well as intervene repeatedly in
the market. Both measures have had limited success.
   The pound was quoted at $1.5785 in Europe late Monday, compared
with $1.6665 on July 31.
   Mrs. Thatcher used to say that the pound would be linked ``when
the time is right.'' Then, in a compromise during June's EEC sumit
in Madrid, she agreed to link the pound once capital flowed freely
in Europe and after Britain's inflation rate, now running at 7.6
percent, fell in line with the lower rates of other European
countries.
   In a Sunday television interview, she went further, saying that
Continental insurance and pension funds must be run as openly and
freely as Britain's and that government subsidies of industries
must end.
   ``You can't have a currency like sterling playing under that
higgledy-piggledy set of rules,'' she said.
   France will eliminate exchange rate controls in July, she said,
but it will take some time for Italy to follow.
   ``I like a strong pound,'' she said, but added that only
intervention and interest rates would keep it that way.
   Charles Bean, who teaches economics at the London School of
Economics, said Monday: ``I certainly interpreted it as a
strengthening of her preconditions of joining the EMS.''
   Robin Aspinall, director of currency economics at the London
investment firm Hoare Govett Ltd., said: ``It was a reaffirmation
certainly. She has been adamant in her position. That was more
fleshing out the details.''
   Labor lawmaker John Smith, the opposition party's chief
financial spokesman, said Sunday, ``Both the tone and content of
Mrs. Thatcher's interview show that she is flatly against joining
the (mechanism) for the foreseeable future.''
   The position of the new chancellor, John Major, is not yet clear.
   Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe, in a Saturday speech
widely interpreted as a challenge to Mrs. Thatcher, said it was
essential that Britain reaffirm its Madrid commitment in order to
maintain confidence among its European partners.
   Howe was demoted from the more influential position of foreign
secretary in July, apparently for his pro-Europe views.
   Bean said many politicians are now advocating joining the EMS,
including Howe, some rank-and-file Conservative lawmakers and many
Laborites.
   Joining the mechanism would remove uncertainty about monetary
policy, and would allow Britain to lower interest rates without
hurting the pound, Bean said.
   In addition, Bean said: ``It makes some difference from a
political point of view. You can argue that it indicates greater
commitment to Europe.''
   But it's not a panacea, he said, and won't prevent an expected
slowdown in the British economy.
   Aspinall said: ``We would have the same dilemma but more of an
obligation to protect the currency. The protection of the currency
would require us to be intervening or raising interest rates.''

<HEAD>Stock Index Futures Increasingly the Target of Market Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yet another major Wall Street house says it will
curb program trading, a computer-driven practice that critics claim
is dangerously distorting the stock market and scaring away small
investors.
   On Monday, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. announced it would halt so-called
index arbitrage for clients until the stock market calms down.
Paine Webber group Inc. took a similar step last week.
   Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. said Monday it would execute index
arbitrage trades only for clients, not for its own account. Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. Inc., Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. and Oppenheimer &amp; Co. made
similar announcements last week.
   Index arbitrage involves stock-index futures, contracts to buy
or sell baskets of stocks based on particular indexes like the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. These contracts have come to represent
a bigger market than that of common stocks _ and one with higher
stakes.
   Using computer programs, traders seek to capitalize on brief and
minute differences in the prices of stocks and stock-index futures
by buying or selling stocks with opposite trades in the futures.
   It has become entirely typical for stock traders and investors
to look to the futures market as an indicator of where equities are
headed. The fundamentals of individual companies _ their earnings,
their marketing strategies and the overall quality of their
products _ have fallen by the wayside.
   ``It's a disgrace,'' said James J. Cramer, investment manager of
Cramer &amp; Co. ``The market has very little to do with individual
stocks anymore and trades as a whole from the individual programs.''
   Indeed, the stock of telephone and electronic giant Contel Corp.
is down from a month ago even though it announced a 16 percent
increase in its quarterly profits a week after the Friday the 13th
stock market plunge.
   ``Why?'' Chairman Charles Wohlstetter asked rhetorically. ``What
the hell for? The stock is now selling 5{ points below where it was
before that Friday and every bit of information and news that came
out is better than anybody anticipated.''
   But Wohlstetter is determined to turn attention to trading
tactics that hurt his company. In an interview Monday, Wohlstetter
said he has talked to about 50 corporate executives who are
contemplating joining him to complain to authorities in what is
believed to be the first such effort organized at the corporate
level. He did not name his potential allies.
   ``I'll take it to the moon if I have to ... in order to bring to
the attention of the corporate world that the stock exchange has
lost its sense of direction,'' Wohlstetter said.
   The protest already has begun to take shape. In Monday editions
of The New York Times, Neuberger &amp; Berman, an investment management
firm overseeing some $17.5 billion, took out a full-page
advertisement imploring: ``Stop the numbers racket on Wall
Street.'' The ad urged investors to voice their concerns in writing
to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden and
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Arguments over unconventional trading strategies came to a head
following the 1987 Black Monday market crash. But the stock
market's recent volatility _ begun Oct. 13 when the Dow Jones
industrial average plunged 190 points in little more than an hour _
has renewed the debate.
   Virtually all observers agree that a ban on stock-index futures
is unrealistic, particularly since the Chicago-based futures
exchanges have the support of many powerful Midwestern politicians.
   But many suggest leveling the playing field by raising the
deposit requirements on futures contracts from 10 percent to 50
percent, making it parallel with margin requirements for stock
purchases.
   With current deposit requirements, someone in the futures market
is able to control $170,000 worth of stocks with a payment of
$9,000, said Larry Zicklin, a managing partner at Neuberger &amp;
Berman.
   ``If you tried to buy $170,000 worth of an underlying stock on
the New York Stock Exchange, you'd have to put up a minimum of
$85,000.''
   While no one knows just how much activity would be dampened by a
tightening of deposit requirements, Zicklin speculated it would be
``substantial.'' Others go so far as to say such a move would in
effect wipe out the strategy.
   Zicklin acknowledges his personal interest in seeing such
strategies curtailed. He neither wants to lose investors who could
become fearful of market swings caused by index arbitrage and
program trading, nor does he want to see stock prices ease as more
money is pulled out of the market.
   ``The market has to be able to attract the private investor with
some degree of comfort that he is not going to be battered around
during the course of a day,'' said Jack Barbanel, president of
First Global Asset Management Inc. in Princeton, N.J. ``He is
drastically psychologically affected when his portfolio moves up
and down in the course of an hour.''
   Barbanel noted, however, that although futures contracts to not
accurately mirror the value of individual stocks, they do correctly
reflect the value of the market as a whole.
   ``If you up the margin requirement, it's like punishing the
instrument instead of punishing the people,'' he said. He said he
favors eliminating index arbitrage rather than trading in index
futures.

<HEAD>Chevron Stock Rise Not Surprising, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent rise in Chevron Corp. stock is not
surprising since it has been undervalued in recent years, analysts
said, as share prices continued to climb amid takeover speculation.
   Chevron's stock closed at $67.25 a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Monday, up 87{ cents from $66.37{
Friday. Chevron's stock has risen about 48 percent this year, from
a low of $45.37{.
   ``It doesn't surprise me. The stock is cheap,'' said Charles
Maxwell, vice chairman and senior energy strategist for C.J.
Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., dismissing talk that a buyout of
the nation's fourth-largest oil concern is likely.
   Chevron's share price only recently surpassed its previous high
of $64 in 1987 after hardly moving during the previous year,
analysts said.
   ``Chevron stock is undervalued in relation to its asset value;
but not undervalued in terms of price-earnings ratio,'' said Paul
Ting, with the investment firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Chevron, rich in oil and gas reserves and a high-performing
chemicals unit, had sales in 1988 of $28.9 billion, down from $29.1
billion in 1987. Earnings last year totaled $1.8 billion, or $5.17
a share, up about 40 percent from $1.3 billion, or $3.65 a share.
   Its $13.3 billion purchase of Gulf Oil in 1984 came just before
a sharp drop in oil prices. The earnings potential of those assets
as well as its 1988 purchase of Tenneco Inc.'s oil and gas
properties in the Gulf of Mexico for $2.5 billion have yet to be
realized, analysts said.
   Chevron's stock has jumped in recent weeks partly on speculation
that the
   San Francisco-based oil concern is ripe for a takeover, possibly
by Pennzoil Co. British Petroleum Co. PLC also has been mentioned
as an interested party.
   A Chevron buyout would be the largest to date. Some analysts say
that in a breakup, Chevron's assets could be worth $100 to $125 a
share _ or approximately $40 billion.
   A published report Monday suggested that a group of investors
could be acting in concert to force Chevron into a restructuring
that would boost the stock further.
   A buyer, possibly a company acting alone or with partners, has
accumulated 12 million to 16 million shares of Chevron stock, or
3.5 percent to 4.7 percent, USA Today reported.
   Chevron spokesman Larry Shushan declined to comment on the
stock's purchaser, in accordance with company policy.
   Pennzoil also declined to comment, but the Houston-based oil
company is rumored to be looking for a place to park some $2.5
billion in cash that it received in a 1988 settlement with Texaco
Inc. following a prolonged battle over Getty Oil Co.
   ``How is Pennzoil going to buy Chevron with $2.5 billion? It
would have to be a junk bond situation,'' said Maxwell, adding that
leveraged deals have lost favor on Wall Street.
   ``No one is going to let Pennzoil have $30 billion to $40
billion in junk bonds,'' Maxwell said.
   ``Pennzoil threatening Chevron is like a kid threatening Mike
Tyson,'' said one securities analyst who did not wish to be named.
   Constantine Fliakos, vice president of Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, in a recent newsletter also dismissed speculation that the
Houston-based company was a serious contender ``unless Pennzoil is
interested in triggering its own `demise' in the event that Chevron
were to react defensively.''
   Although some analysts said they saw no evidence of a serious
takeover attempt featuring either junk bonds or cash, a ``group
attack'' is not out of the question, they said.
   In addition, some suggested the possibility of a BP-Pennzoil
partnership or a BP-Chevron combination. British Petroleum, which
has said it wants to boost its West Coast properties, recently
denied it would make a major U.S. purchase anytime soon.
   In its latest quarter, Chevron's earnings declined to $417
million, or $1.22 a share, from $420 million, or $1.23 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $8 billion from $7.2 billion.

   Thrift regulator M. Danny Wall's defenders are
complaining that a House committee chairman is trying to force Wall
to resign before he has a chance to answer the charges against him.
   The House Banking Committee, chaired by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, is scheduled today to conduct its third hearing into the
collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine,
Calif., which is expected to become the nation's costliest thrift
failure.
   In a letter to President Bush released by the committee Monday,
Gonzalez said Wall's policy of reviewing in advance the testimony
of his subordinates in the Office of Thrift Supervision is
hampering the committee's investigations and suggested the
regulator should step aside.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the thrift agency, said the
suggestion was ``inappropriate'' and Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, for
whom Wall once worked as chief aide, said it was ``uncalled for.''
   ``Obviously Rep. Gonzalez is looking for a scapegoat on which to
place the blame'' for the S&amp;L bailout, said Garn, the senior
Republican on the Senate Banking Committee.
   The House panel plans to conduct at least one more hearing, and
possibly more, before giving Wall a chance to respond.
   Hoyle said he is concerned Congress will recess for the holidays
before Wall and top aides get a chance to defend his actions. Three
senior thrift agency officials _ counsel Jordan Luke, regulation
director Darrel Dochow and enforcement director Rosemary Stewart _
had been scheduled to appear today, but their testimony has been
postponed.
   ``Dan Wall, like anybody else in this country, is entitled to
due process. ... Quite candidly, I think there's a very fine line
between investigation and prosecution,'' Hoyle said.
   Gonzalez, in a letter to Bush dated last Friday, said his panel
has heard ``startling evidence'' that Wall blocked efforts by field
examiners in the thrift agency's San Francisco office to collect
evidence of misconduct by Lincoln officials.
   The committee is focusing on why Wall in 1987 rejected their
recommendation to seize Lincoln and instead ordered another
examination after the institution's owner, Phoenix, Ariz.,
millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., complained he was being treated
unfairly by San Francisco regulators.
   ``In view of your commitment to not let those responsible for
these costly failures remain in positions of authority in your
administration, I believe it would be reassuring to the American
taxpayers who have been asked to pay for this regulatory failure if
Mr. Wall steps aside,'' Gonzalez told Bush.
   At today's hearing, the committee was scheduled to hear from 10
thrift examiners from around the country who were assembled by Wall
to review the work of the San Francisco office.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner says
he doesn't need the new authority to deal with airline takeovers
that a bill before Congress would give him.
   Skinner said Monday the legislation, which would give the
Transportation Department the power to approve or disapprove
airline mergers before they occur, ``smacks of reregulation'' of
the airline industry.
   ``It probably is reregulation and is inappropriate in a
deregulated environment,'' he said in an interview.
   The Air Carrier Securities Act, which was scheduled for House
action today, would require the department to block purchase of 15
percent or more of an airline if the sale threatened to hinder
safety, reduce competition, break up the carrier or put it under
foreign control.
   Skinner currently has the authority to review airline
transactions for their financial fitness, their safety and the
degree of foreign involvement. The law limits foreign interest in
U.S. carriers to 25 percent of voting stock.
   Skinner said he doesn't think he needs additional powers to
prevent a financially unsound takeover.
   ``I think there are other ways I can do it,'' he said. ``We can
advise individuals who are anticipating a transaction ... as to
some of the problems with a transaction if we see any.''
   The secretary said he had reservations about the planned union
and management takeover of United Airlines, but he denied any
responsibility for failure of the plan. Financial analysts say
collapse of the stock buyout move on United's parent company, UAL
Corp., triggered the Oct. 13 drop in the stock market.
   ``The United Airlines transaction fell for one reason and one
reason only _ it was not sound financially,'' said Skinner.
   Failure of the UAL takeover bid followed agreement of Skinner
with Alfred Checchi to scale down foreign participation in
Checchi's stock buyout of Northwest Airlines' parent company, NWA
Inc. The department concluded the original deal put KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines in a position to control Northwest.
   Responding to reports that other administration officials had
been critical of his NWA action, Skinner said, ``Anybody who says
that I did not keep the White House informed fully as to what was
going on prior to making those decisions just isn't informed.''
   Skinner said every step he took was ``thoroughly coordinated''
with senior White House officials. He declined, however, to
describe any conversations he had with other administration
officials over his NWA action.
   The secretary said his reservations about the United deal, which
was to be financed by banks and British Airways, prompted him to
conduct a department review of the proposal. But he gave no opinion
at the time about its soundness.
   ``I talked to leading scholars and accountants and management
consultants who are experts in the airline industry, and they all
expressed reservations which just fortified my concerns,'' Skinner
said, adding that financial problems with the deal would increase
safety and maintenance concerns.
   The takeover bill has had strong bipartisan support, passing the
Public Works and Transportation Committee 23-5. A similar measure
passed the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee
but has not come up on the Senate floor.
   The takeover legislation was prompted by the United and
Northwest deals and the aborted attempt by developer Donald Trump
to buy AMR Corp., parent company of American Airlines. The decline
in the stock market led Trump to withdraw his $7.5 billion plan
which was opposed by AMR management.

<HEAD>United Pilots Resume Contract Talks With UAL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines' pilots are going back to the
bargaining table and threatening to ground the carrier's newest
jetliners.
   Having failed in their bid to lead an employee buyout of United
parent UAL Corp., the pilots say the contract concessions they
agreed to as a part of that effort _ including flying United's new
747-400 aircraft _ will expire Nov. 22.
   Unless they get a new contract by then, the pilots say they'll
stop flying those planes, forcing United to substitute smaller jets
on daily round-trip flights between Los Angeles and Sydney and
Melbourne, Australia.
   ``We'll be exactly where we were in the pre-buyout
environment,'' said Hank Krakowski, a spokesman for the United
chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association.
   The pilots agreed to fly the planes beginning Sept. 18, ending a
dispute over the size of the cockpit crew that had kept the planes
grounded since June.
   Krakowski said the pilots and UAL resumed negotiations Monday on
a contract to succeed a pact that expired in April 1988.
   Also on Monday, the union representing United's flight
attendants said it had been contacted by California billionaire
Marvin Davis, who first put Chicago-based UAL into play in August.
A published report said Davis has also talked with the airline's
pilots and Machinists with an eye toward re-entering the fight for
ownership of the nation's second-largest carrier.
   United's stock rose $4 a share to $175 Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   United pilots agreed to fly the 747-400s and to increase their
workload to 85 flight-hours a month from 81 with no additional pay,
effective Nov. 1, as a show of good faith in their bid to
participate in an employee-management buyout of UAL for $6.75
billion.
   The deal, which also included minority participation by UAL's
top management and British Airways PLC, collapsed Oct. 13 when the
group failed to secure financing for their $300-a-share bid.
   British Airways has since dropped out and United's flight
attendants have signed on to the group, which hopes to make a
revised offer for UAL.
   Had the buyout gone through, the pilots also had agreed to
accept a 7-year contract requiring a 10 percent pay cut.
   UAL spokeswoman Sara Dornacker declined comment on whether
grounding the 747-400s would disrupt United service between Los
Angeles and Australia. She said the airline had flown the route
using smaller 747-SPs from early 1986 until last month, when United
put two 747-400s into service.
   ``We have the ability to substitute one aircraft for another on
any given route,'' Ms. Dornacker said.
   The technologically superior 400s can carry 392 passengers,
compared with 247 in the SPs, and have a 33 percent larger cargo
capacity, she said.
   Davis contacted the United chapter of the Association of Flight
Attendants on Friday, said AFA spokeswoman Patricia Friend. She
would not comment on the nature of the call.
   The Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday that Davis adviser
David Batchelder had discussed a potential UAL buyout offer with
the pilots, the flight attendants and the International Association
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents United's
mechanics and ground crews.
   Krakowski said he did not know if the pilots had been contacted
by Davis and the Machinists did not return telephone calls seeking
to confirm the Times report.
   Davis' office in Los Angeles also did not return calls.
   The Machinists' opposition to employee ownership was seen as one
factor in the failure of the pilot-management bid for UAL. Analysts
say the cooperation of and concessions from the unions are critical
for any succesful buyout of the airline.

   In yet another Japanese takeover of an American
institution, Mitsubishi Estate Co. plans to pay $846 million for
control of the company that owns Rockefeller Center and Radio City
Music Hall.
   The announcement late Monday by Mitsubishi, one of Japan's
largest real estate companies, follows last month's takeover of
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. by Japan's Sony Corp. for $3.4
billion. It also continues a trend of major Japanese real estate
purchases in the United States.
   Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns and manages the 19-building
Rockefeller Center complex in Manhattan, is a legacy of a family
whose name stands for American capitalism. The family, which
controls the private company, traces its fortune to John D.
Rockefeller, who founded the Standard Oil Co.
   Managers of trusts that control the family's holdings said they
decided to sell 51 percent of their shares in Rockefeller Group to
diversify the company's investments, which also include the
nationwide Cushman &amp; Wakefield commercial real estate brokerage.
   Last month, Rockefeller Group confirmed media reports that it
was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company. The
reports indicated that some Rockefeller family members wanted more
income from their investments. Most of the family members'
inheritance is tied up in real estate and other holdings.
   But the independent trust committee that manages the family's
holdings said Monday the money from the sale to Mitsubishi would be
reinvested in other Rockefeller Group operations, and would not be
paid out to family members.
   William G. Bowen, chairman of the trust committee, said one
objective of the sale was to diversify the company's holdings,
which are concentrated in real estate.
   ``The sale of a large block of shares to Mitsubishi was approved
because it offered a most unusual opportunity to enhance the
long-term prospects of the Rockefeller Group and Rockefeller Center
while simultaneously rebalancing the trust portfolio,'' Bowen said.
   In a statement, David Rockefeller, Rockefeller Group's chairman
and son of John D. Rockfeller Jr., said, ``Our agreement with
Mitsubishi Estate preserves the abiding commitment to Rockefeller
Center and New York City which my father made more than 50 years
ago, and which present generations of the family continue to feel.''
   Rockefeller Group officials said the company's board, its
advisers and the trust committee considered other options, such as
a recapitalization funded by debt, before they decided on the stock
sale. The closing date of the deal was not announced.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space,
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real
estate investment trust.
   In the year 2000 the trust has the option of converting those
shares into ownership stakes in Rockefeller Center that would put
71.5 percent of the complex in the public's hands.
   The Rockefeller family fortune was was estimated at $900 million
in 1911, when the Standard Oil trust was busted into several
companies. Today, Forbes magazine estimates the combined family
fortune at over $5 billion.
   John D. Rockefeller's son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created five
trusts for his children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal
owners of Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D.
Rockefeller Jr. the main beneficiaries.
   The 22-acre Rockefeller Center complex includes the 65-story
General Electric Building, formerly called the RCA Building, which
contains the Rainbow Room and NBC's headquarters; Radio City Music
Hall, home of the Rockettes; a famed outdoor ice-skating rink; the
Time-Life building, and The Associated Press Building, headquarters
of the news service.
   The Art Deco center, built in the 1930s, is one of the nation's
first large-scale urban developments. Its buildings are the home of
many well-known corporations, such as Time-Warner Inc., McGraw-Hill
Inc. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc.
   Rockefeller Group's other businesses include: Rockefeller Center
Development Corp., Rockefeller Center Management Corp., Rockefeller
Group Telecommunications Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc., and the 40-office Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in which
the company holds an 80 percent stake.
   Mitsubishi Estate, which is publicly traded and has historical
ties to the auto company of the same name, is one of Japan's
largest real estate companies. Its other major U.S. investments
include partnerships that built a $500 million office building at
Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles and a 2,300-acre resort complex at
Palm Desert, Calif.

   London share prices were higher at midday Tuesday
thanks to further price markups by market makers and a trickle of
follow-through buying, but volume remained light.
   Dealers said the market started in positive territory and
shifted higher, but then began to drift from its early peaks as
buying dried up.
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index showed a 14.1 point, or 0.7 percent, rise to
2,126.3 points.
   Most dealers described the market's gains as a continuation of a
technical rally which started Monday, but felt the gains could
prove fragile if some bad news hit the market.
   Volume came to 182.8 million shares at midday, compared with
129.9 million shares at the same time Monday.

<HEAD>Continental Chairman Resigns, Lorenzo Named as Replacement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than 10 months after taking office as
chairman and chief executive officer of Continental Airlines,
Joseph Corr has resigned and is being replaced by Frank Lorenzo,
the chairman of parent company Texas Air Corp.
   Corr, the former president of Trans World Airlines, resigned
Monday to pursue other business matters, Continental said in a
brief statement.
   Corr declined to comment further about his reasons for leaving
Continental. He would say only that he does not intend to go back
to work for his former associate _ St. Louis financier Carl Icahn.
   ``We regret to see Joe leave but we certainly respect his
desires,'' Lorenzo said. ``Important operation and financial
improvement has been ongoing during Joe's tenure and we are
committed that that improvement will continue.''
   Daniel Hersh, an analyst with Los Angeles-based Bateman Eichler
Hill Richards said, ``It could be a signal that things are going
worse than expected.''
   Hersh speculated that Continental's third-quarter results might
not be as good as expected ``and Corr's the scapegoat.''
   ``The logical reason is he couldn't get along with Lorenzo,''
Hersh said. ``It's a pretty autocratic company. If Frank doesn't
agree with what you're doing, it's kind of hard to make it work.''
   The airline also announced Monday that Mickey Foret, 44, was
named president of Continental after serving as Continental's
executive vice president of planning and finance. He previously was
senior vice president of Texas Air and Eastern Airlines, a Texas
Air subsidiary.
   Foret makes the seventh Continental president in as many years.
   Corr became Continental president after the resignation of
Martin Shugrue, a former vice chairman and chief operating officer
of Pan Am Corp. Shugrue resigned in February after holding the
position for a year.
   Shugrue had taken over the presidency from Lorenzo.
   Lorenzo had replaced Thomas G. Plaskett, a marketing whiz hired
away from rival American Airlines in 1986. Plaskett lasted a mere
nine months with Continental.
   Prior to Plaskett, Philip Bakes, now head of Eastern, ran
Continental. Before that was another stint by Lorenzo, who took
over when Stephen M. Wolf resigned shortly before Continental filed
for Chapter 11 protection in September 1983.
   Lorenzo, 49, has been chairman and chief executive of
Houston-based Texas Air since its founding in 1980 and has held
various senior executive positions with the company over the years.
He is currently a director of Continental and chairman of its
executive committee.
   Houston-based Continental posted second quarter earnings of
$32.1 million on revenue of $1.3 billion. The company has yet to
release its third quarter earnings for this year.
   Texas Air, meanwhile, recorded a net loss of $109.3 million for
the second quarter.

   The chairman of Revco D.S. Inc. said the
troubled drug store chain is considering an unsolicited $925
million buyout bid from Acadia Partners L.P. and the Robert M. Bass
Group.
   The proposal would add an estimated $260 million debt to the
highly leveraged company.
   Revco, with about 1,900 drugstores in 27 states, is undergoing
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The company's 1986 billion leveraged buy-out, financed with
high-interest junk bonds, ran into trouble in 1988. It was the
first large leveraged-buyout deal of the 1980s to falter.
   With the new debt, along with $150 million in cash, the
purchasers would provide $410 million for payments to creditors and
debt interest.
   Boake A. Sells, Revco's chairman, said Monday the plan by the
Fort Worth, Texas, businesses would add to Revco's existing debt of
$515 million for a total indebtedness of $775 million.
   He said the offer was being studied. He did not say when a
response would be made.
   On Oct. 24, a U.S. bankruptcy judge granted Revco an extension
of its period of exclusivity to file a reorganization plan through
April, 1990. After that, creditors may file their own plans.

   Increased productivity, higher
prices and cost controls helped push Whirlpool Corp.'s
third-quarter earnings up 27.6 percent compared with last year, the
appliance maker says.
   The company said Monday it earned $46.7 million, or 68 cents a
share, during the July-September period this year, compared with
$36.6 million, or 53 cents a share, during the same time last year.
   Revenue rose to $1.5 billion this year, compared with $1.2
billion during the third quarter of last year.
   Whirlpool said the earnings came despite a drop in appliance
orders.
   For the first nine months, the company earned $137.8 million, or
$1.99 a share, up 14.5 percent from $120.4 million, or $1.74 a
share, during the same period last year.
   Year-to-date revenue for 1989 were $4.71 billion compared with
$3.39 billion last year.

   Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. will give all its
employees a day off to celebrate passing the $1 billion sales
level, it was announced Tuesday.
   Dec. 22 will be a paid holiday for the Rochester-based eye and
health care company's 12,400 employees worldwide. The company
achieved $1 billion in sales for 1989 last week for the first time
in its history.
   Reaching the $1 billion figure ``is such a matter of pride and
prestige,'' said Daniel E. Gill, chairman and chief executive
officer of the 136-year-old company. ``It just puts you into a new
realm.''
   Gill predicted the company would reach at least $1.2 billion in
sales by the end of the year.
   Company officials have kept track of Bausch &amp; Lomb's progress
toward the $1 billion mark with daily bulletins since last
September. Ordinarily, sales are not reported on a daily basis.
   The company's sales have grown at an annual rate of more than 20
percent for the past five years, Gill said. So far this year, sales
have grown by 28 percent, led by the company's international
business and its sunglass and oral care divisions.
   Earnings for the year so far are about 16 percent higher than in
1988.

   Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it has
completed a $3.35-billion acquisition of Associates First Capital
Corp. from Paramount Communications Inc.
   Ford said Dallas-based Associates, the nation's third-largest
independent finance company based on total assets, will operate as
an independent affiliate in the Ford Financial Services Group.
   Associates has assets of about $14 billion, and has business in
real estate-secured loans, credit cards, direct installment and
revolving credit loans and mortgage banking.
   Ford Holdings Inc. was formed Sept. 1 to handle the financing
for the Associates acquisition. Included in Ford Holdings, in
addition to the Associates, is U.S. Leasing International Inc.,
Ford Leasing Development Co., The American Road Insurance Co. and
Ford Motor Land Development Corp.
   Paramount said in a separate news release that net proceeds from
the sale will total $2.6 billion, giving the company an after-tax
gain of $1.2 billion. The gain will be recorded in Paramount's
final 1989 quarter, which ended Tuesday.

   In yet another Japanese takeover of an American
institution, Mitsubishi Estate Co. plans to pay $846 million for
control of the company that owns Rockefeller Center and Radio City
Music Hall.
   The announcement late Monday by Mitsubishi, one of Japan's
largest real estate companies, follows last month's takeover of
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. by Japan's Sony Corp. for $3.4
billion. It also continues a trend of major Japanese real estate
purchases in the United States.
   Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns and manages the 19-building
Rockefeller Center complex in Manhattan, is a legacy of a family
whose name stands for American capitalism. The family, which
controls the private company, traces its fortune to John D.
Rockefeller, who founded the Standard Oil Co.
   The old 12-building Art Deco portion of Rockefeller Center,
including Radio City Music Hall, most likely will not be controlled
by Mitsubishi past the year 2000. Public shareholders of a real
estate investment trust are expected to take control that year.
   For Mitsubishi, the more valuable assets are the Time-Life
Building and a 50 percent interest in the McGraw-Hill Building,
which are in the newer portion of Rockefeller Center; as well as
the nationwide Cushman &amp; Wakefield commercial real estate brokerage
and prime real estate parcels in New York and New Jersey.
   Last month, Rockefeller Group confirmed media reports that it
was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company. The
reports indicated that some Rockefeller family members wanted more
income from their investments. Most of the family members'
inheritance is tied up in real estate and other holdings.
   But the independent trust committee that manages the family's
holdings said Monday the money from the sale to Mitsubishi would be
reinvested in other Rockefeller Group operations, and would not be
paid out to family members.
   William G. Bowen, chairman of the trust committee, said one
objective of the sale was to diversify the company's holdings,
which are concentrated in real estate.
   ``The sale of a large block of shares to Mitsubishi was approved
because it offered a most unusual opportunity to enhance the
long-term prospects of the Rockefeller Group and Rockefeller Center
while simultaneously rebalancing the trust portfolio,'' Bowen said.
   In a statement, David Rockefeller, Rockefeller Group's chairman
and son of John D. Rockefeller Jr., said, ``Our agreement with
Mitsubishi Estate preserves the abiding commitment to Rockefeller
Center and New York City which my father made more than 50 years
ago, and which present generations of the family continue to feel.''
   Rockefeller Group officials said the company's board, its
advisers and the trust committee considered other options, such as
a recapitalization funded by debt, before they decided on the stock
sale. The closing date of the deal was not announced.
   Mitsubishi's 51 percent ownership of the older portion of
Rockefeller Center is likely to diminish to about 14 percent in the
year 2000.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 billion mortgage on the historic portion of
the center east of Avenue of the Americas. It then sold shares in
that mortgage to the public through a real estate investment trust.
   In the year 2000 the trust has the option of converting those
shares into ownership stakes in the older portion of Rockefeller
Center that would put 71.5 percent of the complex in the public's
hands.
   Conversion of the shares appears likely because the properties
involved in the trust already are worth $1.8 billion, according to
an appraisal at the end of last year.
   The conversion would leave just 28.5 percent of the older
portion of Rockefeller Center under the joint ownership of
Mitsubishi Estate and the Rockefellers.
   The Rockefeller family fortune was estimated at $900 million in
1911, when the Standard Oil trust was busted into several
companies. Today, Forbes magazine estimates the combined family
fortune at over $5 billion.
   John D. Rockefeller's son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created five
trusts for his children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal
owners of Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D.
Rockefeller Jr. the main beneficiaries.
   The 22-acre Rockefeller Center complex includes the 65-story
General Electric Building, formerly called the RCA Building, which
contains the Rainbow Room and NBC's headquarters; Radio City Music
Hall, home of the Rockettes; a famed outdoor ice-skating rink; the
Time-Life building, and The Associated Press Building, headquarters
of the news service.
   The original part of the center was built in the 1930s in an Art
Deco style as one of the nation's first large-scale urban
developments and is classified as a National Historic Landmark. The
center was later expanded with a row of modern skyscrapers west of
Avenue of the Americas.
   Its buildings are the home of many well-known corporations, such
as Time Warner Inc., McGraw-Hill Inc. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc.
Among the newer buildings, the Exxon Building was sold about three
years ago to Japan's Mitsui &amp; Co. for $620 million and is now being
vacated by Exxon, which is moving headquarters to Texas. The
Celanese building is owned by JMB Realty of Chicago and the
McGraw-Hill Building is half-owned by McGraw-Hill.
   Rockefeller Group's other businesses include: Rockefeller Center
Development Corp., Rockefeller Center Management Corp., Rockefeller
Group Telecommunications Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc., and the 40-office Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in which
the company holds an 80 percent stake.
   Mitsubishi Estate, which is publicly traded and has historical
ties to the auto company of the same name, is one of Japan's
largest real estate companies. Its other major U.S. investments
include partnerships that built a $500 million office building at
Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles and a 2,300-acre resort complex at
Palm Desert, Calif.

   Georgia Pacific Corp. said today that it
offered to acquire Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. in a cash deal that
values the company at around $3.13 billion.
   The $58-a-share bid confirms several days of market rumors that
Georgia-Pacific, a forest products company based in Atlanta, would
attempt to take over Great Northern, a Norwalk, Conn., paper
products company.
   Georgia Pacific said its bid represented a 50 percent premium
over the market price of Great Northern before takeover speculation
drove up the stock's price starting last Thursday.
   Nekoosa closed up $2.75 at $42.75 in active New York Stock
Exchange trading Monday. George Pacific fell 12 cents to $53.37 a
share.
   In a letter delivered today to Great Northern Chairman William
R. Laidig, Georgia Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. emphasized
his desire to achieve a friendly, negotiated merger and requested a
meeting with Laidig as soon as possible.
   ``Unlike many of today's transactions driven by financial
engineering, the merger of our two companies represents an
excellent strategic fit based on industrial logic,'' Hahn said.
``This combination will result in a stronger and more competitive
forest products company.''
   Laidig, in a news release, said the offer was uninvited, but
would be considered, along with the request to negotiate a merger,
``in due course'' by the board of directors.
   Mark Kurland, an analyst with Mabon Nugent &amp; Co. in New York,
said the offer probably could trigger bids from other forest
products companies, including Champion International Co.,
International Paper Corp., Weyerhauser Co., and Canada's
Abitibi-Price Inc.
   ``I'm sure they have calls in to Great Northern right now,''
said Kurland, who expected Great Northern would attempt to secure
the best price for its shareholders if it could not fend off a
takeover attempt by Georgia Pacific.
   Kurland said he would not be surprised if Great Northern pursued
a friendly merger with Champion or Boise Cascade Corp. in order to
avoid an unwanted takeover.
   Great Northern would be an attractive acquisition for Georgia
Pacific because it would allow the company to acquire 7 percent of
both the linerboard and white paper markets in the United States
without having to build its own operations, Kurland said.
   Great Northern has been expanding its facilities. On Monday, it
announced it was acquiring a 50 percent interest in a linerboard
mill in Oklahoma. Two years ago, it bought a paper and box
production unit from Owens-Illinois Inc. for $1.5 billion.
   But Kurland said he was surprised Georgia Pacific's bid came
now, during a downward cycle in the paper products industry he
attributed to a general economic slowdown and expansions in the
paper industry.
   Georgia Pacific said it was offering $58 a share in cash for
each of Great Northern's approximately 54 million shares
outstanding, making the company worth around $3.13 billion.
However, it said it would cost approximately $4.5 billion to
consummate the offer, including ``refinancing certain indebtedness
of Great Northern and Georgia Pacific and pay related fees and
expenses.''
   The company said the deal was conditioned on, among other
things, acquiring at least 75 percent of Great Northern's
outstanding shares by Nov. 29.

<HEAD>House Chairman Faults OMB for Allowing Cereal Makers to Lie</HEAD>

   The chairman of a House panel investigating
cereal makers' health claims said today that pressure from the
Office of Management and Budget on federal regulators has allowed
food manufacturers to lie about the benefits of eating their
products.
   ``Based on all the evidence the subcommittee has uncovered in
this an other investigations, I am concerned that the agency
empowered by Congress to make the federal government's health
policy is not performing that function,'' said Rep. Ted Weiss,
D-N.Y., chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on
human resources and intergovernmental relations.
   ``Instead, an ideologically driven OMB has seized the controls
of the health policy ship,'' he said.
   Weiss said the Food and Drug Administration proposed in 1987
that explicit disease-prevention claims be allowed on food labels.
   He said that under OMB pressure, the FDA bypassed the normal
regulatory rules and allowed companies to begin making the health
claims immediately.
   ``The 1987 proposal has seriously weakened FDA's ability to
challenge even what the agency itself believes are deceptive
claims,'' Weiss said as he opened a hearing on the subject.
   Interviewed earlier on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, Weiss said
manufacturers are ``playing reckless games'' with the public's
health with their claims.
   The FDA said recently it had serious concerns about cereals that
contain husks of psyllium, which contains soluable fiber.
Manufacturers say the grain is safe and can help lower cholesterol.
   Last month, the FDA told General Mills, maker of Benefit cereal,
and Kellogg Co., maker of Heartwise and Bran Buds, to submit
scientific data to the agency showing that the levels of the grain
in their products is safe.
   Benefit also contains sugar beet fiber and the FDA asked General
Mills to submit data showing it also is safe.
   The cereal makers contend that their products are safe and that
they would submit the requested data.
   Bran Buds has been on the market for a year, Benefit is being
sold in selected test markets but Heartwise is not on the market
yet.
   The issue of whether psyllium is a drug or a food additive was
raised by Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which uses psyllium in its
Metamucil laxative. The company had asked the FDA to pull Benefit
off the market because the cereal had not been subjected to
drug-testing requirements.
   In letters to General Mills and Kellogg, the FDA said there are
``well-known safety concerns'' associated with use of psyllium,
including possible allergic reactions.
   The agency noted that General Mills has warned on its label
about this possibility, provides instructions for its use on the
package label and advises consuming the cereal with adequate
liquids and restricting consumption by children.
   But the FDA also said that unlike a drug product, a food is
subject to unrestricted consumption, and such unrestricted use ``to
reduce serum cholesterol levels or for any other purpose has never
been approved by FDA.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices were slightly higher while
the grain markets were narrowly mixed in early trading today on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   The strength in soybeans stemmed from stronger cash markets and
defied predictions for a lower opening based on a
larger-than-expected number of delivery notices posted this morning
against the November contract.
   Today is the first-notice day for the November soybean contract,
the first opportunity for traders to declare their intentions to
actually deliver soybeans when the contract expires next month.
   The corn market's weakness was seen partly as a reaction to an
unexpectedly low export inspection figure in a weekly Agriculture
Department report. The USDA said Monday it inspected about 34.7
million bushels of corn for export last week compared to 33.3
million a week earler and 31 million a year ago.
   The USDA also reported that both the corn and soybean harvests
were 79 percent complete as of Sunday.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to 1\ cents
higher with the December contract at $3.96{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to } cent lower with December at $2.40\ a bushel; oats
were { cent higher across the board with December at $1.43\ a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with November at
$5.62{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher, with pork bellies
up sharply in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid
speculation that Yugoslavia may buy a large amount of U.S. bellies.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with December at
74.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .47 cent higher
with November at 82.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower
to .45 cent higher with December at 46.20 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .65 cent to 1.37 cent higher with February at
54.97 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Monday, with pork
bellies posting strong gains.

<TEXT>
   USX Corp. Tuesday said its third-quarter
earnings declined 23 percent to $175 million, or 62 cents per
share, with operating income falling nearly 14 percent due largely
to asset sales.
   Quarterly sales grew slightly to $4.4 billion from $4.2 billion
a year earlier, when net income was $228 million, or 80 cents per
share. Earnings in the 1988 quarter were boosted by a $71 million
gain on a federal tax issue.
   The energy and steel company said operating income soared $104
million to $84 million at the exploration and production end of its
Marathon Oil Co. subsidiary, while operating income plunged $84
million, or 75 percent, to $112 million at Marathon's refining,
marketing and transportation operations.
   Upstream operations benefited from higher prices. Downstream
operations were hurt by lower refined product margins, USX said.
   Overall operating income was $302 million, compared with $350
million in the 1988 third quarter.
   Operating income in steel fell 10.5 percent from $95 million on
sales of $1.4 billion to $85 million on sales of $1.3 billion. USX
attributed the decline to the sale of its Lorain, Ohio, plant to a
joint venture with Kobe Steel Ltd. of Japan.
   Steel's performance remained favorable despite weakness in the
market for oil country tubular goods and moderate declines in
demand in other steel markets, the company said.
   Nine-month net earnings rose 20.5 percent to $721 million, or
$2.62 per share, on sales of $13.8 billion from $598 million, or
$2.07 per share, on sales of $12.5 billion.
   ``The improvement resulted primarily from better results in the
energy segment, where operating income was more than twice the 1988
level,'' said Chairman Charles A. Corry.
   Asset sales contributed $312 million to total pretax income of
$1.1 billion in the period, he said.
   USX said in October it is soliciting bids for its Texas Oil &amp;
Gas Corp. subsidiary, where a third-quarter operating loss of $9
million represented an improvement of $6 million.

   The White House and congressional leaders
today agreed to raise the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by April
1991, ending a lengthy political stalemate and clearing the way for
the first boost in the base wage since 1981.
   Both sides made significant concessions to reach the deal, which

with little or no job experience.
   The compromise was struck between White House chief of staff
John Sununu and House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash. Other lawmakers
who have in the past been involved in the issue agreed to it,
although some complained of being kept out of the discussions.
   One last langauge problem was being worked out, but all sides
said the compromise measure would be drafted today and put to a
House vote Wednesday. Senate approval likely would follow rapidly.
   ``No side will get the victory for this,'' said Rep. Augustus
Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and Labor
Committee. Hawkins, the House author of a $4.55 minimum-wage bill
President Bush vetoed earlier this year, said he was not involved
in the talks that led to the deal.
   Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., author of the latest Democratic
proposal, said he would reluctantly support the compromise.
   ``I think we could have done a little better if we'd held their
feet to the fire,'' he said.
   The deal was reached even as Bush told a morning news conference
he would again veto the Democratic bill if it was not changed to
meet his standards.
   ``I'll send it right back,'' he said.
   But a short time later, the compromise was presented to the
House Rules Committee as a bipartisan substitute for the Murphy
bill set for debate in the House on Wednesday. The agreement ends a
nearly nine-year fight by the Democratic congressional leadership
and organized labor against the Reagan administration and now the
Bush administration.
   The movement came only a day after Democrats and Republicans
alike complained that the administration was showing no willingness
to compromise and that another veto-override battle was likely.
   The compromise would boost the minimum wage from $3.35 an hour
to $3.80 an hour on April 1, 1990, with a second 45-cent increase
coming a year later. That would bring the minimum wage to $4.25 in
1991, nine months earlier than Bush originally proposed and three
months later than called for in the current Democratic bill.
   The issue that has been the greatest obstacle to agreement was
the language for a so-called training wage under which newly hired
workers could be paid a subminimum.
   Democratic leaders wanted such a provision to cover only new
entrants in the job market and only then for 60 days; Bush had
insisted on a six-month provision that would cover all workers each
time they changed jobs.
   Both sides gave some on that issue to reach the apparent
compromise.
   The administration had agreed to a two-tiered subminimum of an
intial three months and then an additional three months if the
employer could document actual training.
   The language concerning the second three months was unresolved
early this afternoon but was expected to be worked out by day's end.
   The subminimum provision would cover only workers 16 to 19 years
old and would expire in 1993 unless Congress endorsed it again.
   The administration agreed to the expiration of the subminimum in
exchange for Democrats dropping their insistence for a commission
to report annually on the minimum wage. Republicans contended the
panel would be used by Democrats to, in effect, seek annual
increases.
   Democratic leaders and organized labor initially had opposed any
training wage but were forced to give in because conservative
Democrats who helped Bush win the veto fight sided with the
president on that issue.
   Advocates of the subminimum say it will prevent massive job
losses among youths that they say would be triggered by a higher
minimum wage. The final target of $4.25 is also below the $4.55
contained in the bill Bush vetoed and is lower still than the $5.25
an hour originally proposed by Hawkins last year.

<HEAD>Kimberly-Clark Third Quarter Earnings Up 20.2 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kimberly-Clark Corp. Tuesday reported a 20.2
percent jump in third quarter income mainly from increased prices
and sales of disposable diapers and feminine care products.
   Kimberly-Clark said earnings in the three months ended Sept. 30
were $108.8 million, or $1.35 per share, compared with $90.5
million, or $1.12 per share, in the comparable quarter of last year.
   Sales grew 6.2 percent to $1.45 billion this year from $1.37
billion last year.
   The quarterly improvement also was helped by a $11 million
charge last year to cover early retirement and other costs
associated with a modernization program at a pulp and newsprint
plant in Alabama.
   Net income in the nine-month period was $313.2 million, or $3.89
per share, compared with $283.9 million, or $3.53 per share. Sales
in the period rose to $4.27 billion from $4 billion.
   ``The consumer business improvements generally were due to
higher selling prices, particularly for disposable diapers and
tissue products, and from increased sales volumes, especially for
feminine care products,'' the company said.
   While consumer product income was up, the company said its
newsprint business remains depressed because of industry-wide price
discounting.
   Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark markets household, personal care and
health care products under such brands as Kleenex tissues, Kotex
and New Freedom feminine products and Huggies disposable diapers.

   The Bush administration would abandon its
proposed capital-gains tax cut if faced with the threat of the
government's defaulting on its loans, a Treasury Department
official said today.
   ``If it were literally a choice between capital gains and
default, obviously Treasury would not allow default,''
Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber told a House Ways and Means
subcommittee.
   Glauber responded only after considerable prodding by Democratic
members of the oversight subcommittee. They fear that efforts by
Senate Republicans to add a capital-gains cut to a bill extending
the government's borrowing authority could jeopardize that bill and
push the government toward default next week.
   Meantime, President Bush told a news conference, ``I plan to
fight for my position'' favoring a capital-gains tax cut. ``It's
something that's good for growth ... investment ... jobs,'' he said.
   Capital gains are profits from the sales of investments such as
real estate and securities. They now are taxed at the same rate as
other income. A House-passed bill, which Bush endorses, woould
create a lower rate for capital gains for 2\ years and then
permanently adjust the tax system so that gains caused solely by
inflation were not taxed.
   Capital gains has become the dominant issue before Congress.
Bush's push for the tax cut against opposition of Democratic
leaders has blocked action on a $16 billion deficit-reduction bill,
on legislation to boost aid to Poland and Hungary and on the
measure raising the government's debt ceiling.
   Democrats say Bush and his Republican allies should be pressing
for passage of a debt-ceiling bill without any amendment _ and
especially without the capital-gains amendment. Republicans are
unwilling to let that bill pass unamended because they view it as
the best way to win the capital-gains reduction.
   If that stalemate continues past Nov. 7, the government would be
faced with the possibility of defaulting on its credit for the
first time in history.
   Glauber was asked repeatedly whether the administration would
ask Congress for an unamended debt-ceiling bill. ``The secretary
will recommend to the president that he sign a clean (unamended)
debt bill,'' he responded. But he would not say that the
administration would recommend passage of an unamended measure.
   The House has passed a capital-gains tax cut as part of its plan
for reducing the budget deficit. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has promised that
the capital-gains cut and all other extraneous provision will be
removed from that bill if the Senate will pass an unamended
debt-ceiling bill.
   But Rostenkowski emphasized today that ``if they (senators) are
going to load up that (debt) bill'' will amendments, that would
greatly diminish chances of getting a deficit-reduction bill this
year.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The music is soothing, the service sublime, the
setting splendiferous. The cuisine, supped at marble tables, is
nestled in orange plastic foam.
   Welcome to the Wall Street area McDonald's _ where the humble
Big Mac is served in a veritable temple, featuring a uniformed
doorman, a pianist performing on a black baby grand, and even an
electronic ticker for brokers bingeing on junk bonds and junk food.
   ``I went to the architects and said, `I want to build the Taj
Mahal,''' said owner Frank Madalone, who opened this, his eighth
New York City McDonald's, last December.
   It may not be the Taj, but it is like no other McDonald's. It is
located on Broadway, 3{ blocks north of Wall Street. The outside is
distinguished by two massive windows, bordered with black marble
trim, the Golden Arches painted discreetly on each one.
   Inside, an atrium is graced by two-story-tall mirrors; sleek,
Art Moderne style chandeliers; oodles of plants; and just a hint of
violet neon _ to match the violet suits worn by the smiling
hostesses.
   ``It's fun watching the customers' faces when they walk in the
door,'' said Customer Service Manager Judy Jones. ``They stop, look
around and wonder if they're in the right place.''
   Potted palms grace the sleek chrome counter, next to plastic
bins of catsup and drinking straws. Each table has a vase with a
red carnation. Delivery men in navy blue trench coats and
chauffeur-style caps heft red, insulated bags, stuffed with ``Fax
Your Max'' orders. The hostesses and cleaning crew whisk away used
bags and empty cups, sometimes before the customers have left the
table.
   Espresso, cappucino and pastries are offered at afternoon
teatime. But otherwise, it's the standard McFare, served at the
regular McDonald's metropolitan prices.
   ``This is a beautiful place _ the service, the cleanliness, the
decor,'' said Estelle Jasko, 80, of Washington Township, N.J.
``I've always had the impression that McDonald's was a run-down
place; I was shocked.''
   ``The ambience is very important,'' said a pinstripe-clad Joseph
D'Angelo of Brooklyn, vice president of an international freight
forwarding firm. ``I've never seen a McDonald's so keen on
service.''
   It's even service with a personal touch. ``We seated two people
together upstairs; now, they're dating and may get married,'' Ms.
Jones noted proudly.
   Madalone says the restaurant _ between the World Trade Center
and South Street Seaport _ is becoming a tourist attraction itself,
complete with picture postcards that spread the word when visitors
mail them to the folks back home.
   Recently, a Fax Your Max order arrived at 2 a.m. _ from
Helsinki, Finland. Apparently, a tourist carried the order form
home to Finland and, as a joke, faxed the transatlantic order: four
Big Macs, two Quarter Pounders, fries, drinks and an Oriental
chicken salad.
   Happy but not yet content, Madalone dreams of evening waiter
service; private dining rooms, where executives can munch Egg
McMuffins during breakfast conferences; and an adjacent boutique
selling pins, shirts and golf umbrellas with the McDonald's logo.
   ``I'm having the time of my life,'' he says.

   Stock prices steadied at sharply higher levels
in afternoon trading, sustaining a broad-based rally triggered
early in the day by news of a new $3 billion tender offer in the
paper industry.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 34.43 points to
2,637.91 at 2 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was up 28.28 points
at noon EST.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 2 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 998 issues up, 464 down and 439 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 117.22 million shares.
   The market opened higher on news that Georgia Pacific Corp. had
offered to acquire Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. in a cash deal
valued at more than $3 billion.
   ``The bid for Great Northern has revitalized the deal syndrome
and the paper group,'' said Larry Wachtel, equities analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Paper stocks have underperformed the market in recent months,
Wall Street brokers said. In addition, the market had reacted
negatively to the collapse earlier this month of proposed deals
involving UAL Corp. and AMR Corp., parent companies of United and
American airlines. The failure of a UAL pilot-led group to get
necessary financing for the deal helped trigger the mid-October
stock plunge.
   However, volume remained relatively low, leading some traders to
question the market's ability to sustain the momentum.
   ``It's a broad-based rally but there is still little volume,''
said Brad Weeks, head of equity trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette. ``It doesn't surprise me because confidence is still very
low.''
   New government data that suggested the pace of economic growth
is slowing boosted the credit markets slightly amid hopes that the
Federal Reserve would now move to ease interest rates. But the
reports had little impact on the stock market.
   The Commerce Department reported that the Index of Leading
Indicators, its chief economic forecasting gauge, inched ahead 0.2
percent in September for its second consecutive monthly advance.
However, the index, designed to foretell economic activity six to
nine months into the future, was revised upward to 0.5 percent for
August from a 0.3 percent gain reported earlier.
   The government also reported that sales of new homes fell 14
percent in September, their steepest decline in nearly eight years,
as interest rates crept back to the double-digit level of the
preceding months.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 1.94 at 187.55.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
gained 1.07 at 369.94.
   Great Northern Nekoosa led the NYSE most active list up 19 at
61} _ well above the $58-a-share tender offer by Georgia Pacific;
Chevron was up 2\ at 68}; and Chase Manhattan had gained \ at 36\.
   Unisys, meanwhile, was off { at 14} and Detroit Edison was
unchanged at 23~.

   Mitsubishi Estate Co., the company buying a
majority stake in the owner of Manhattan's famed Rockefeller
Center, is not a Sony, or anything like it.
   Sony Corp., the consumer electronics manufacturer that is buying
Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion, is seen in Japan as a brash,
innovative upstart.
   Mitsubishi Estate is an aristocratic collector of rents that
belongs to the Mitsubishi group, considered a grand, rather gray
old lady among Japanese business circles.
   The company's planned $846 million investment in the symbolic
heart of Manhattan was characterized by analysts on Tuesday as an
attempt to branch out from Mitsubishi's conservative base.
   Although the company's profitability is high, it trails other
Japanese property firms in overseas investment and overall growth.
   For its New York foray, Mitsubishi sought an equally prestigious
partner. As brand names are important to the Japanese tourists
mobbing the boutiques at Rockefeller Center, the same holds for
companies like Mitsubishi.
   ``They were looking for a top-tier name,'' Tadashi Kato, an
analyst at Prudential Bache Securities, said.
   Japanese stock market investors don't know much about
privately-held Rockefeller Group except the name, but Mitsubishi
stock closed up 150 points at 2,680 yen Tuesday on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange after the deal was announced.
   The Mitsubishi name rings of 19th-century oligarchs, wartime
tycoons and the postwar government-business establishment.
   Mitsubishi managers are known as quintessential organization men
in a country of organization men. Its blue-suited employees
traditionally have been considered the cream of the elite, the kind
of solid, well-heeled men people want their daughters to marry _ a
far cry from some of the Japanese real estate wheeler-dealers
famous in the United States but infamous at home.
   The Rockefeller and Mitsubishi empires began as products of the
same era, the robber-baron days of the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Yataro Iwasaki started the Mitsubishi fortune in
shipbuilding, John D. Rockefeller in oil. With Japan's wartime
expansion, Mitsubishi grew into one of Japan's leading
``zaibatsu,'' or business combines.
   Both empires fell victim to trust-busting. Mitsubishi's
209-company combine was broken up and family influence virtually
eliminated in the postwar dissolution of the zaibatsu by the
occupying Americans.
   Mitsubishi group no longer is controlled by a single holding
company, but its 41 companies maintain relations through a system
of cross-shareholding known as ``keiretsu.'' Companies operate
independently and often compete against each other, but in times of
need all know they can depend on Mitsubishi Bank for help.
Mitsubishi Trust owns 7.3 percent of Mitsubishi Estate, and
Mitsubishi Bank owns 4.1 percent.
   Group companies produce everything from gasoline to chemicals,
steel, automobiles, paper, electronic equipment, weapons and
aircraft, with a trading company buying and selling worldwide.
   Mitsubishi Estate ``is seen as a gentlemanly company in a
business that in Japan is seen as ungentlemanly,'' says James
Doherty, analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities.
   The company owns much of Tokyo's equivalent of Rockefeller
Center and midtown Manhattan _ the prestigious Marunouchi business
district next to the Imperial Palace, a stone's throw from the
glittering Ginza.
   Sitting on the most valuable contiguous piece of real estate in
the world, Mitsubishi collects rents at less than half market value
and still is the most profitable real estate company in Japan,
analysts say.
   Mitsubishi says it has the largest portfolio of office buildings
in Japan, 25 million square feet with a book value of more than $5
billion. Jardine Fleming estimated the real value at well over $70
billion at the beginning of 1988.
   But the long history of its Marunouchi property, which
Mitsubishi originally recovered from swampland on imperial orders
in the 19th century, is part of its problem.
   ``It's like it's this big diamond just sitting there,'' says
Alan Woodhull, analyst at Merrill Lynch.
   City regulations forbid Mitsubishi from tearing down existing
mid-rise buildings in Marunouchi for more efficient high-rises. The
company can't raise rents of long-term tenants to market levels in
part because of legal restrictions, in part because some of those
tenants are Mitsubishi group companies.
   Mitsubishi still hopes to get permission to redevelop
Marunouchi. Meanwhile, it has started a huge reclaimed land project
in Tokyo Bay off Yokohama, where it is building Japan's tallest
skyscraper.
   Overseas, it plans to expand business that has lagged far behind
other Japanese companies. Mitsubishi has invested only 5 percent of
its assets outside Japan, the company says.
   Mitsubishi's overseas holdings include the 777 Tower building in
Los Angeles' Citicorp Plaza and a 1,000-acre Sunrise resort project
in Palm Desert, Calif.
   Analysts say Mitsubishi is likely to take a hands-off approach
to its 51 percent share in the Rockefeller Group, which includes
the management of the Rockefeller Center Development Corp., the
Cushman and Wakefield real estate firm and Radio City Music Hall
Productions.
   ``A company like Mitsubishi doesn't mind low yields. If they
don't get a quick return, that wouldn't faze them at all,'' said
Doherty.

<HEAD>Former MCA Records Chief to Get Own Label in Joint Venture With Warner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Azoff, one of the most powerful and
highly regarded executives in the music business, said Tuesday he
was forming his own label in a joint venture with Warner Bros.
Records, the leading U.S. record company.
   Azoff spent 16 years managing the careers of rock stars, then
became head of MCA Records in 1983 and was widely credited with
resurrecting that label. He quit last summer after reports of
clashes with top MCA management.
   The as yet-unnamed recorded music and music publishing business,
to be based in Los Angeles, will open Jan. 1.
   Azoff and Warner Bros. Records Board Chairman Mo Ostin said
specifics about staff and artists were expected to be announced
soon.
   It is the second such joint venture for Warner Bros. Records, a
unit of Time Warner Inc. that has about 40 percent of the U.S.
market. Sony Corp.'s CBS Records, its closest competitor, has about
half that market share.
   Warner already has a 50-50 partnership with record and movie
producer David Geffen, for whose Geffen-Roberts personal management
firm Azoff once worked, handling the careers of Crosby, Stills,
Nash &amp; Young, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young.
   Azoff, 41, was said to have wanted a deal similar to Geffen's,
and told The Associated Press when he resigned at MCA that he would
not be a minority partner in any deal.
   Financial terms of the Warner deal were not announced, although
Warner Bros. was to manufacture and distribute recordings
domestically and through its WEA International in the rest of the
world.
   ``What I want to do is a broad-based company, the cornerstone of
which will be a record company,'' Azoff had said. ``Basically, I
intend to start the first major independent of the '90s with major
funding.''
   Azoff drew notice for his deft handling of the careers of such
rock superstars as the Eagles, Boz Scaggs and Steely Dan. But he
left all that in April 1983 to join MCA, a company he once
characterized as the ``Music Cemetery of America.''
   MCA dropped 41 of its 46 acts and started rebuilding, often
signing other labels' discards. Elton John, for example, had his
career rejuvenated when he returned to MCA. And Azoff broadened the
label's base beyond rock and jazz into black music and contemporary
country.
   For the 1982 fiscal year, MCA's recording and music-publishing
operations had $141.7 million in gross revenue; for fiscal 1988,
the Music Entertainment Group, which includes home-video revenues,
had $661 million in gross revenue.
   MCA's music group lost more than $8 million in 1983, but earned
more than $60 million last year. In the same period, units shipped
rose from 35 million to 120 million.
   A proxy statement shows Azoff was paid about $5 million in
salary and stock last year.
   MCA had hoped to negotiate its own, similar deal with Azoff. MCA
president and chief operating officer Sid Sheinberg did not
immediately return a call seeking comment on the Warner-Azoff deal.
   Azoff was succeeded as chairman of MCA Music by Al Teller, a
former CBS Records president who joined MCA last year as a
corporate vice president and president and chief operating officer
of MCA Records.

   Share prices finished at session peaks in London
Tuesday, supported by a reassuring early performance on Wall Street
and news that the British government was prepared to waive its
``golden'' share in Jaguar PLC.
   Trading was very light, however, as investors remained wary from
the market's gyrations of recent weeks.
   Volume was a modest 334.5 million shares, up from the 1989
record low of 257.8 million posted on Monday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 30.4
points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,142.6, its best level for the
session.
   The key index reached a minimum of 2,120.5 points just a
half-hour into the session.
   ``Volume has been appalling,'' said a dealer at a British
brokerage firm. ``The market was dragged up by the scruff of its
neck by Wall Street and by market makers getting caught short. No
one wants stock on their books.''
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 32.18
points at 2,635.66 as London trading finished.
   In London, the Financial Times 30-share index was up 19.7 points
at 1,721.4 points at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index
rose 16.31 points to close at 1,188.47.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said in the House of Commons
that if Jaguar's shareholders voted by a 75 percent majority to
lift a 15 percent restriction on holdings in Jaguar, the government
would drop its golden share allowing it to veto any takeover.
   Jaguar is being pursued by General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co.
   The golden share and the 15 percent limit had been due to expire
at the end of 1990.
   Jaguar's shares finished at 869 pence, or around $13.73, on the
London Stock Exchange, up 122 pence, or $1.93, from Monday's close.
Trading was suspended during most of the afternoon, pending the
government's announcement.

   Offsetting the news about a weakening economy is
some news of another sort that has surprised some economists. They
are wondering if it is too good to persist. Inflation is declining.
   This may not be news to savvy consumers who have grabbed
bargains at retail outlets of various sorts _ in automobile
showrooms and grocery stores, for example _ in recent weeks. Their
knowledge of prices is immediate.
   For economists who rely on statistics, however, the recognition
is a bit delayed, and some of them are just now expressing their
happiness. In contrast, only a few weeks ago they had thought
inflation was gaining momentum.
   So widespread was that fear during early summer that the Federal
Reserve persisted in a tight-money policy. At one point earlier
this year there wer indications of a 6 percent to 9 percent
inflation rate.
   Over the summer, however, rates decelerated sharply, especially
for food and energy, the very items that had earlier caused alarm.
Transportation, automobile, gasoline and housing costs also fell
significantly.
   The deceleration, and in some instances actual declines in
prices, still leaves some economists a bit puzzled, wondering if
some pieces of the puzzle still need to be fitted into place. They
wait to see if it will continue.
   Allen Sinai, economist for the Boston Co., observes that
disinflation at retail is surprising in an economy that grew 2.5
percent in the second quarter and probably 3 percent-plus in the
third quarter.
   He is among those who tend to suspend judgment about the
permanence of the change, saying ``the puzzle of the rapid
disinflation could well disappear in coming months with another
acceleration.'' That said, he attempts to explain.
   First, he calls attention to a weakening manufacturing sector,
accompanied by efforts to contain costs, especially in labor. With
revenue growth slowing, Sinai says, manufacturers are forced to
stay price-competitive.
   ``This is not the usual reaction of American business,'' he
observes, contending that ``typically, prices are held high to
maintain profit margins, and labor costs are cut much later.''
   He suggests also that the economy may be weaker than the
official data suggest, compelling retailers to offer more discounts
than usual. And adding to the pressure to hold prices, he says, is
intense competition from abroad.
   Other, esoteric explanations are offered in abundance, but
probably come no nearer to explaining the surprisingly good price
performance. More important are the conclusions drawn, and Sinai
sees the possibility of even lower rates.
   Looking into 1990, he talks of an inflation rate as low as 3.5
percent to 4 percent, or about a full percentage point lower than
the surprisingly low rates that now exist.
   There is a price to pay, of course _ there always is _ and that
according to Sinai might be a significant economic downturn.
   Still, if you're going to have a slowdown, let it be accompanied
by stable or lower prices. You may recall that over the past decade
or so it was demonstrated that the economy can fall while prices
rise.
   If the country is going to have an economic slowdown, that is,
let it be accompanied by some good news too, and what better news
can there be than an extended breather from rising prices?

<HEAD>Borden Posts Loss _ As Expected _ Due to Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc., the nation's biggest dairy company,
Tuesday posted a third-quarter loss of $303.4 million due to the
costs of a major restructuring program.
   Advance word of a substantial loss, which came to $2.05 a share,
had been given in September when Borden announced it was
consolidating some operations, reconfiguring others and cutting
worldwide employment by 7,000 people, bringing its payroll down to
39,000.
   In September, Borden said it would sustain a third-quarter loss
of as much as $305 million and a loss of $47 million to $58 million
for the full year.
   The loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 reflected an
after-tax charge of $404.4 million, or $2.73 a share, to cover the
costs of the corporate realignment.
   Last year's third-quarter profit totaled $91.9 million, or 62
cents a share.
   Excluding the one-time charge, this year's third-quarter income
went up by $9 million, or 9.8 percent.
   Third-quarter revenue grew 4.7 percent to $1.96 million from
$1.87 million a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Borden had an loss of $160.5
million, or $1.08 a share, compared with income of $218 million, or
$1.48 a share, through three quarters of 1988.
   Nine-month revenue rose 7.2 percent to $5.64 billion from $5.26
billion in the first nine months of 1988.
   Besides dairy products, Borden makes well-known snack foods such
as Wise potato chips and Cracker Jack popcorn. It also makes pastas
and other foods and manufacturers Elmer's Glue and Krazy Glue.

   Stock prices continued the broad-based rally
triggered early in the day by news of a $3 billion takeover offer
for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials spurted 44.68 points to
2,648.16 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator, which has climbed
steadily throughout the session, was up 34.43 points an hour
earlier.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 5 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,079 issues up, 430 down and 421
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 146.17 million shares.
   Analysts said the market was sustaining the rally started at the
opening bell on news that Georgia Pacific Corp. had offered to
acquire Great Northern Nekoosa in a cash deal valued at more than
$3 billion.
   ``The bid for Great Northern has revitalized the deal syndrome
and the paper group,'' said Larry Wachtel, equities analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Paper stocks have underperformed the market in recent months,
Wall Street brokers said. In addition, the market had reacted
negatively to the collapse earlier this month of proposed deals
involving UAL Corp. and AMR Corp., parent companies of United and
American airlines. The failure of a UAL pilot-led group to get
necessary financing for the deal helped trigger the mid-October
stock plunge.
   New government data that suggested the pace of economic growth
is slowing boosted the credit markets slightly amid hopes that the
Federal Reserve would now move to ease interest rates. But the
reports had little impact on the stock market.
   The Commerce Department reported that the Index of Leading
Indicators, its chief economic forecasting gauge, inched ahead 0.2
percent in September for its second consecutive monthly advance.
However, the index, designed to foretell economic activity six to
nine months into the future, was revised upward to 0.5 percent for
August from a 0.3 percent gain reported earlier.
   The government also reported that sales of new homes fell 14
percent in September, their steepest decline in nearly eight years,
as interest rates crept back to the double-digit level of the
preceding months.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 2.51 at 188.10.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
gained 1.38 at 370.25.
   Great Northern Nekoosa led the NYSE most active list up 19\ at

   Early strength in the soybean market faded during the morning

the U.S. corn and soybean harvests were each 79 percent complete as

<HEAD>Government Prepared to Drop Jaguar Takeover Veto Power; Stock Soars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government said Tuesday it would drop
its ``golden share'' power to veto any takeover of Jaguar PLC if
the luxury car maker's shareholders approved such a move, possibly
clearing the way for a bidding war.
   The decision, which surprised Jaguar, would allow for General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. or other potential suitors to make
proposals to Jaguar shareholders.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said in the House of Commons
that the government would relinquish its veto power if Jaguar
shareholders voted by a 75 percent majority to lift a restriction
limiting individual Jaguar holdings to 15 percent of the company.
   ``This statement paves the way for shareholders, with the advice
of the board, to reach their own view on the options which may be
available,'' Ridley said.
   The ``golden share'' veto power and the 15 percent limit are due
to expire at the end of 1990.
   However, Jaguar's articles of association still prevent anyone
from owning more than 15 percent of Jaguar without approval by
shareholders at an extraordinary meeting, the company noted.
   Jaguar's shares soared, finishing up the equivalent of $1.93 at
$13.73 a share on London's Stock Exchange.
   Jaguar, which has suffered from slumping U.S. sales, is looking
for a partner to give it financial and technological support, but
wants to remain independent.
   Analysts estimate the luxury car maker could fetch up to $15.80
a share, or $2.8 billion, if GM and Ford engage in a bidding war
for Jaguar.
   General Motors and Jaguar have been holding friendly talks for
months in an effort to reach a cooperation agreement, which is
expected to be announced by mid-November.
   General Motors is expected to take a minority stake in Jaguar
and run several joint ventures, including the manufacture of a new,
cheaper Jaguar model.
   ``We will now consider all our options and explore matters
further in light of these important new developments,'' said GM
spokesman Jack Harned in Detroit.
   Ford has acquired a 13.2 percent stake in Jaguar and said it is
prepared to mount a buyout bid once the takeover restrictions are
dropped. Ford spokesman Rex Greenslade in Dearborn, Mich., said the
company had no comment Tuesday on Jaguar.
   Jaguar said it was surprised by the announcement and had not
been consulted in advance about Ridley's move.
   ``It was, of course, always the Jaguar board's intention that
any proposals concerning the future of the company would be
submitted for shareholder approval,'' the statement read.
   Either the Jaguar board or a shareholder owning at least 10
percent of the company may call an extraordinary meeting, said
Jaguar spokesman Arnold Bolton.
   During his speech in Commons, Ridley said the government's
remaining role would be to assess the impact a takeover of Jaguar
might have on competition in the British auto industry.
   ``I am clear that it is in the best interests of Jaguar's
management, shareholders and work force for the company's future to
be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as
quickly as possible,'' he said.
   The restrictions were established in 1984 when the government
sold the car maker. They were intended to protect Jaguar's
independence during its formative years, Ridley said.
   Now, the restrictions are ``clearly causing uncertainties about
the company's future by prompting speculation over how my powers
may be exercised, so distorting the basis on which all parties
involved have to reach their decisions,'' Ridley said.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government
champions free-market policies and generally has not exercised its
golden shares.
   For example, British Petroleum Co. PLC acquired Britoil PLC last
year after the government said it wouldn't use its takeover veto.

   The stock market staged a broad-based rally
today, triggered by news of a $3 billion takeover offer for Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   The momentum began at the opening bell on news that Georgia
Pacific Corp. had offered to acquire the Norwalk, Conn.-based paper
company and continued throughout the session.
   Wall Street analysts said the tender offer helped renew investor
confidence that had eroded after the collapse earlier this month of
proposed deals involving UAL Corp. and AMR Corp. The failure of a
UAL pilot-led group to get the necessary financing to buy the
company helped trigger the mid-October stock plunge.
   ``The paper offer was helpful because it shows that deals are
still going to be done or at least are attempting to be done,''
said Brad Weeks, head of equity trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette.
   The market's ability to sustain the rally throughout the
session, however, surprised many analysts, who expected investor
pessimism to return after the initial euphoria had worn off.
   The tender offer helped revive paper stocks, which had
languished in recent months, traders said.
   New government data that suggested the pace of economic growth
is slowing had little impact on the stock market.
   The Commerce Department reported that the Index of Leading
Indicators, its chief economic forecasting gauge, inched ahead 0.2

   The government also reported that sales of new homes fell 14
percent in September, their steepest decline in nearly eight years,
as interest rates crept back to the double-digit level of the
preceding months.
   Analysts said the rally was ``orderly and pleasant'' without the
violent swings brought on by program trading. Some brokerages in
recent days announced that they were suspending index arbitrage.

   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham
Nazer said Tuesday his country is maintaining its OPEC quota and is
committed to security for oil importing and exporting nations.
   ``We cannot prosper without each other,'' Nazer said. ``It is
not only you that needs the oil. It is also us who needs the
markets.''
   Nazer, speaking to the Independent Petroleum Association of
America, said his country is particularly interested in a healthy
oil market in the United States, which last year accounted for
about one-fourth of total oil imports.
   ``We are now an integral part of the United States oil market,
and the return on our investment depends on its health,'' Nazer
said. One-fifth of the oil supplied by Saudi Arabia, the world's
largest oil exporter, goes to the United States, he said.
   While independent, or ``high-cost, low-reserve'' producers may
be a declining part of the world oil market, Nazer said, their role
is significant.
   ``Their output, and their continuing presence in the market, is
essential in a situation of robust demand. And their presence
becomes all the more important in times of excess demand, which may
well be the situation in the future,'' he said.
   Later, referring to independent producers in the United States,
he told reporters, ``I think they should get all the incentives
they need because I think their role in the market is extremely
important.''
   Asked about reports that Saudi Arabia is producing 5.4 million
barrels of oil a day, Nazer replied: ``We are sticking to our
(OPEC) quota. By the way, there is a difference between production
and quota.''
   He said his nation's OPEC oil quota is 5.14 million barrels a
day. Nazer also said Saudi Arabia's oil reserves are estimated at
252 billion barrels, but could end up being as high as 315 billion
barrels. Overall world reserves total 950 billion barrels, Nazer
said.
   Nazer also said Saudi Arabia alone cannot stabilize the world
oil market.
   ``Saudi Arabia believes in reasonable and stable oil prices
which allow appropriate returns to producers. Unreasonably high or
unreasonably low prices give both producers and consumers
misleading signals,'' he said.
   Touting the notion of ``reciprocal security,'' Nazer said oil
customers must know that the flow of oil and natural gas will
continue at a reasonable price.
   ``There is a need to enlarge the concept of energy security to
cover not only the consumers but also the producers,'' he said.
   Reciprocal security, Nazer said, is a simple equation of oil
supply and demand. ``You need the oil, we have the oil,'' he said,
to a few chuckles in the audience.
   Nazer declined to discuss what actions the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries might take at an upcoming November
meeting.
   As for oil prices in the first quarter of 1990, he said, ``I
don't see how you can get lower prices with higher demand.''

<HEAD>Former MCA Records Chief to Get Own Label in Joint Venture With Warner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Azoff, a music-business wizard who
revived MCA Records after deftly managing the careers of such stars
as the Eagles, Stevie Nicks, and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, said
Tuesday that Warner Bros. Records was setting him up as head of his
own label.
   On one level, the creation of a new record concern bucks a trend
of consolidation into a handful of huge conglomerates: Island and
A&amp;M were swallowed by Dutch-owned Polygram, RCA Records by
Germany's Bertelsmann AG and Motown by MCA. CBS Records was
acquired by Sony Corp. and Japan's Fujisankei Communications also
bought a 25 percent stake in Virgin Records.
   ``Everybody has been sold and bought,'' Azoff said in a
telephone interview. ``But rock 'n' roll is a rebellious art form
by nature. And given the choice, I think a real artist would rather
be in business with an individual than a multinational.''
   On the other hand, Azoff will enjoy the advantages of Warner's
huge size _ the company has about 40 percent of the U.S. market _
and international distribution network.
   ``You can't take an artist and say, `I'm going to be so
independent that you're not going to be distributed by a major,'''
Azoff said.
   Azoff, who quit as head of MCA Records in September, said Warner
will handle manufacturing and distribution and will fully fund the
new recording and music publishing company. He will own the company
in a 50-50 partnership with Warner.
   He declined to go into details about the deal, but had estimated
recently that it would take $75 million to $100 million to launch
an independent record label.
   MCA had hoped to negotiate its own, similar deal with Azoff. MCA
president and chief operating officer Sid Sheinberg did not
immediately return a call seeking comment on the Warners deal.
   Warner already has a 50-50 deal with record and movie producer
David Geffen, distributing recordings and movies from his
independent company.
   Geffen is another powerful music-business baron for whose
Geffen-Roberts personal management firm Azoff once worked, handling
the careers of such artists as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and
Joni Mitchell.
   ``No two deals are the same,'' Azoff said. ``But my arrangement
is similar in spirit'' to Geffen's.
   A proxy statement shows MCA paid Azoff about $5 million in
salary and stock last year. He wouldn't discuss any guarantees in
his new contract.
   Over the last two decades, Azoff's Front Line Management had
managed many acts who recorded for Warner. The company also had
funded his Full Moon Records in a joint venture and had handled
foreign distribution for MCA.
   Besides MCA and Warner, several other companies had courted him.
   ``I talked to several but all along I hoped it would be
Warner,'' Azoff said, noting that Warner has a long history of
handling distribution in close relationships with independent
labels such as Asylum, Geffen, Sire, Virgin and Island.
   ``Warner has played an instrumental role in launching all the
independents,'' he said. ``No other American company can point to
it and say that.''
   Azoff spent 16 years as a personal manager, then became head of
MCA Records in 1983. He quit in September, leaving behind a music
group where earnings had gone from an $8 million loss in 1983 to a
$60 million profit in 1988. In the same period, units shipped rose
from 35 million to 120 million.
   His as yet-unnamed recorded music and music publishing business,
to be based in Los Angeles, will open Jan. 1. He declined to talk
about what artists he might sign or staff he might hire, except to
say he would not raid MCA employees.

   The dollar ended higher Tuesday against key
currencies in quiet trading, and some dealers said the $846 million
deal by Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Japan for control of New York's
landmark Rockefeller Center helped support the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices fell following a mixed performance overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $374.70 a troy ounce, down $3.10 from late
Monday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of
$373.30 an ounce, down $3.35.
   Currency dealers said internal market influences largely pushed
the dollar higher. But they said higher share prices on Wall Street
and the Rockefeller Center purchase also supported the dollar,
particularly against the Japanese yen.
   ``It's a large amount of money and obviously it has to be
converted,'' from yen to dollars, noted Robert Ryan, a senior
trader at Bank of New York.
   Mitsubishi agreed to pay $846 million to buy a 51 percent stake
in Rockefeller Group Inc., whose most famous asset is Rockefeller
Center.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 142.15 yen, down from Monday's 142.17
yen. It traded at 142.69 yen late in London, and at 142.87 yen in
New York, up from 141.87 yen late Monday.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound. One pound
cost $1.5775 late Tuesday in London, cheaper than Monday's $1.5785.
Sterling fetched $1.5805 in New York, down from $1.5825 late Monday.
   However, the pound continued to rebound against other currencies
in Europe following its plunge Friday after Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's abrupt resignation. Lawson's successor,
John Major, stressed Tuesday that he intended to follow current
policies, fight inflation and maintain a strong pound.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8420 West German marks, up from 1.8340; 1.6160
Swiss francs, up from 1.6050; 6.2510 French francs, up from 6.2265;
1.1740 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1735; and 1,352.50 Italian lire,
up from 1,346.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.8410 West German marks, up from 1.8360; 1.6142 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6065; 6.2445 French francs, up from 6.2325;

<HEAD>Sea Containers to Resist Takeover Bid with Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sea Containers Ltd. on Tuesday announced plans to
sell ferries, ports and hotels and its entire containership fleet
in a restructuring designed to thwart a takeover bid.
   The company, whose president is American millionaire James B.
Sherwood, said it expected to raise more than 750 million British
pounds, or around $1.1 billion, from sales of its assets. Sherwood
also owns the luxury Orient Express train.
   The cash will help increase the price of Sea Containers stock
and counter a rejected 530 million-pound ($832 million) bid from a
rival ferry group, the Temple consortium. The group is comprised of
Stena, a Swedish ferry company, and Tiphook PLC, a British
container rental company.
   Sea Containers said its proposals have to be approved by the 10
million shareholders who are mainly in the United States.
   The projected sales include the profitable six Sealink ferries
between the English south coast and the Isle of Wight, eight other
ferries, the ports of Harwich near London and Heysham in northwest
England, the container fleet of 13 ships, 10 hotels, a 42 percent
stake in Isle of Man Steam Packet Co. and steamboats on Lake
Windermere in England's Lake District.
   The company said there were potential buyers for all the
businesses and that local managers might be interested in buyouts.

   Stock prices surged Tuesday in a broad-based
rally that analysts said was triggered by news of a $3 billion
takeover offer for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 41.60 points to
finish at 2,645.08. The blue-chip indicator had declined in five
straight sessions last week and recovered only slightly on Monday.
   Wall Street analysts said the $58-a-share tender offer by
Georgia Pacific Corp. for Norwalk, Conn.-based paper maker Great
Northern Nekoosa helped restore market players' confidence about
the prospects for future deal-making.
   Takeover speculation has helped buoy stock prices during the
market's rise this year.
   But Wall Street's confidence was shaken badly after the collapse
earlier this month of proposed deals involving UAL Corp. and AMR
Corp. The failure of a UAL employee-management group to get
financing for its planned $6.75 billion buyout of the company
helped trigger the Oct. 13 stock plunge, which in turn led to the
scuttling of developer Donald Trump's $7 billion offer for AMR.
   ``The paper offer was helpful because it shows that deals are
still going to be done or at least are attempting to be done,''
said Brad Weeks, head of equity trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,111 issues up, 448 down and 413 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.10 million
shares, up from 126.63 million on Monday.
   The market's ability to sustain the rally throughout the session
surprised many analysts, who expected investor pessimism to wipe
out early gains once the initial euphoria had worn off.
   ``I don't know if there was any real good news, but there was a
clear absence of bad news today. It was a good, old-fashioned
technical rally,'' said Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading for
Nikko Securities International.
   Analysts called the rally orderly, without the sharp price
gyrations evident in many recent sessions.
   New government data suggesting that the pace of economic growth
is slowing further had little impact on the stock market.
   The Commerce Department reported the Index of Leading
Indicators, its chief economic forecasting gauge, rose 0.2 percent
in September for its second consecutive monthly advance. But the
index was revised upward to 0.5 percent for August from a 0.3
percent gain reported earlier.
   The government also reported that sales of new homes fell 14
percent in September, the steepest decline in nearly eight years,
as interest rates rose.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 208.461 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market advanced $43.801 billion, or
1.34 percent, in value from Monday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.65 to 188.24.
   Great Northern Nekoosa led the NYSE most active list, rising 20[
to 62~.
   Chevron, a rumored takeover candidate, climbed 1} to 68\; Chase
Manhattan gained { to 36{; and Philip Morris advanced ~ to 43.
   Unisys, which announced a huge third-quarter loss last week,
fell } to 14{ and Pacific Telesis lost [ to 43|.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.44 to 388.54, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 5.29 to close at 340.36.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
4.26 to 455.63. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 370.58, up 1.71.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas billionaire Robert Bass may want to buy
Revco D.S. Inc. for $925 million because he thinks the nation's
aging population will be spending more money in Revco drug stores,
an analyst said Tuesday.
   Bass leads a group of investors bidding for the privately held
1,900-store chain, which is the first big leveraged buyout to file
for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   The deal would add $260 million in debt to the books of a
company that was plunged into Bankruptcy Court last year because it
couldn't keep up with its existing debt payments. It went private
in a $1.3 billion leveraged buyout in 1986.
   Jeffrey Stein of McDonald &amp; Co. of Cleveland said the offer
reflected Revco's prescription business, which is about 30 percent
of its sales, and the increasing number of older Americans more
dependent on prescription drugs.
   Revco's stores in 27 states fill 65 million prescriptions yearly.
   ``The company still has a strong franchise in the drugstore
industry,'' said Stein.
   Revco spokeswoman Diana Lueptow declined to comment on merits of
the Bass bid, saying not enough information was available. She said
the company technically considers it an expression of interest
rather than an offer. Under Chapter 11, Revco itself has first
rights until Feb. 28 to propose any reorganization plan for the
company.
   The bid was made in an Oct. 20 letter from Acadia Partners and
the Robert M. Bass Group Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, and made public
Monday.
   The $925 million figure overstates what the Bass-led group would
actually put up for Revco. It would pay $150 million in cash for
all stock in the reorganized company and assume responsibility for
$515 million of debt on Revco's books. It would also have the
reorganized company borrow an additional $260.5 million.
   The Bass organization has a policy that ``we don't discuss any
business with the news media,'' said a woman handling news
inquiries at Bass offices in Fort Worth. She declined to identify
herself.
   Acadia Partners specializes in leveraged acquisitions and is
capitalized in excess of $1.6 billion. Principal partners include
the Bass group, American Express Co., Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Robert Bass, whose holdings were valued at $1.6 billion in the
latest Forbes 400 list of wealthy individuals, has interests in
real estate, finances and oil.
   David Schulte, who advises Revco creditors on bankruptcy issues,
and Stuart Hertzberg of Detroit, representing Revco suppliers, were
unavailable for comment Tuesday.
   Anac Holding Corp., parent of Revco D.S. Inc., reported a
first-quarter loss Sept. 29 of $16.2 million, compared with a $27.9
million loss for the same period last year. Sales increased 2.4
percent, from $583 million to $597 million.
   Revco was hampered late last year by dwindling stocks amidst
supplier concerns. It is ``fully in stock and looking forward to
the upcoming holiday season,'' the company saidin a preview of
Revco's second quarter, which ends in late November.
   Stein said that, if bought at the right price, Revco could
operate profitably because it currently operates at a profit before
corporate debt payments are taken into account.

<HEAD>Pork Belly Futures Soar On Export Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork belly futures prices soared the permitted daily limit of 2
cents a pound Tuesday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
anticipation of further export sales of the meat, which normally
attracts little interest overseas.
   On other futures markets, livestock futures rose; precious
metals fell sharply; stock-index futures rallied; oil futures were
mixed; and grains and soybeans were mostly lower.
   Frozen pork bellies settled 1.9 cents to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in February at 55.6 cents a pound, its
highest settlement in nearly nine months.
   A pork belly is the part of a hog from which bacon is made.
   With Tuesday's surge, the market extended a rally that began in
the second week of August after February bellies bottomed on Aug. 9
at 38.3 cents a pound, a record low relative to hog prices.
   Analysts linked the market's comeback from 18-year lows to
export demand for bellies from Eastern Bloc nations, an unusual
development apparently prompted by the depressed prices and the
ready availability of U.S. bellies.
   Yugoslavia was reported Monday to have purchased 200 metric tons
of bellies about two weeks ago and was rumored on Tuesday to be
shopping for up to 800 tons more.
   Pork bellies also are expected to be sent to Poland as part of a
U.S. food-aid package, and the Soviet Union is believed to have
been pricing U.S. bellies recently.
   ``The fact that we've never had these sources of demand has
given the market a new dimension,'' said Charles Levitt, senior
livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., said the
health concerns that have cut into domestic demand for bacon are
secondary to survival for Eastern European people.
   Although pork bellies are about 70 percent fat, ``when you want
to buy something with a lot of energy in it for cheap money, pork
bellies are it,'' Morgan said.
   The belly rally helped lift hog futures while cattle futures
rose in line with stronger spot markets, Morgan said.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .45 cent higher with December
at 74.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .57 cent
higher with November at 83.12 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to
.88 cent higher with December at 46.57 cents a pound.
   Precious metal futures retreated on New York's Commodity
Exchange as players who had bought gold and silver during last
week's stock-market slide took their profits and shifted dollars
back into stocks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained
more than 41 points Tuesday.
   Gold settled $3.20 lower across the board with December at
$377.60 a troy ounce; silver was 6.5 cents to 7.4 cents lower with
December at $5.218 a troy ounce.
   As stocks rallied, so did stock-index futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of
stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 5.95 points
higher at 343.15. The contract is worth $500 a point.
   Heating-oil futures surged on the New York Mercantile Exchange
as cold weather moved into the Midwest and headed for the
Northeast. Crude oil rose slightly and gasoline futures were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 14 cents to 22 cents
higher with November at $18.49 a barrel; heating oil was .47 cent
to 1.13 cents higher with November at 58.64 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .10 cent lower to .35 cent higher with
December at 52.94 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower in listless trading
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$3.94{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 3{ cents lower with December
at $2.37{ a bushel; oats were \ cent to } cent lower with December
at $1.42{ a bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents lower to } cent higher
with November at $5.58{ a bushel.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines submitted its revised
reorganization plan to creditors on Tuesday, after the creditors'
committee dropped plans to develop alternatives to the company's
own plan.
   Joel Zweibel, a New York attorney representing the unsecured
creditors' committee, said Eastern sent copies of the plan to the
creditors, who will study it and meet next Tuesday to vote. The
plan details Eastern's proposals for repaying its debts after it
emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization that protects it
from creditors.
   Zweibel wouldn't comment on Monday's creditors' committee
meeting in New York.
   Other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
16-member committee voted to rescind instructions given at an Oct.
18 meeting for its financial experts to develop alternative
proposals. The committee includes representatives of four Eastern
employees' groups.
   The New York Times, quoting two unidentified sources, reported
in Tuesday's editions that creditors are near agreement on
accepting Eastern's revised plan. But a striking union official
noted that negotiations are continuing.
   ``I'm not sure there's been a change of heart,'' said Skip Orr,
spokesman for Eastern's striking pilots. ``What we've seen that I
think is most significant is that there hasn't been an agreement
and the parties are still negotiating.''
   An Eastern spokeswoman said the company was upbeat about the
negotiations, although it couldn't comment in detail.
   ``We're pleased with the progress being made with the creditors'
committee, but we're not in a position to comment beyond that,''
Karen Ceremsak said.
   Eastern on Wednesday will add 75 flights, bringing its daily
schedule to 775 flights, compared with nearly 1,100 before the
strike began.
   Some creditors have expressed concern that Eastern's effort to
rebuild without its unions, who walked out on March 4, wouldn't
generate enough revenue to pay its debts.
   But The Times reported that one source said the creditors, who
have been lobbied intensely by Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes, now believe they have a
good chance of being repaid under Eastern's plan. Eastern debts
total some $3.1 billion, with more than $2 billion in long-term
debt.
   Houston-based Texas Air is the parent of Eastern.
   ``The one thing that we have not seen come out is any refuting
of the figures that were presented two weeks ago,'' said Orr, the
pilots' spokesman. ``Those were the figures that gave the creditors
a great deal of concern.''
   The creditors' advisers, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Young,
had reported that their analysis of Eastern's rebuilding plan
showed the company would still be losing money over the next few
years, and Goldman Sachs said Eastern would have to borrow more
money to pay rebuilding costs.
   Eastern officials last April announced plans to rebuild to a
regional carrier about 65 percent its pre-strike size. But Lorenzo
and Bakes said recently that Eastern's rebuilding is moving faster
than expected and they expect to return to 85 percent to 90 percent
of pre-strike operations with 1,000 daily flights. They say Eastern
can start making profits in 1990 and would have little debt left by
the end of 1993.
   They dropped plans to sell Eastern's South American routes,
expected to raise about $400 million in cash. Eastern did sell its
Northeast shuttle service to New York developer Donald Trump, some
Philadelphia property and Canadian routes to Midway Airlines, and
made several other sales of planes, gates and landing rights to
other buyers.
   Soon after Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9,
some creditors indicated a preference for liquidation of the
carrier to pay debts, but U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland
has made it clear he wants Eastern revived.
   The Senate last week approved a bill calling for a Senate-House
commission to investigate and make recommendations about how to
resolve Eastern's labor dispute. The bill goes to a conference
committee to combine it with a similar House bill, but Bush
administration officials have said the president would veto such a
bill.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Camp Takes Early Lead in Battle Over Unix Software Standard</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that includes AT&amp;T will get a jump on
the competition Wednesday when it introduces a version of Unix
base-layer software that it hopes to make into an international
computing standard.
   The introduction is a blow to plans for a rival standard that
are being formulated by International Business Machines Corp.,
Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Each group is trying to establish itself as the standard-setter
for Unix, an underlying layer of software that makes it easy for
different kinds of computers to run the same programs. Computer
users fear that if the two groups keep fighting there will be two
incompatible versions of Unix.
   Unix International Inc., the group that includes AT&amp;T, said it
would gather 25 senior figures from the computing world on
Wednesday in New York to endorse the introduction of its Unix
System 5 Release 4.0. The version unifies and enhances several
previous Unix releases.
   The group said shipments of the new software would begin early
next year. That gives it a jump on the rival Open Software
Foundation, which is still hammering out standards and does not
expect to begin major shipments until late in 1990.
   The two groups continued to bicker over how much support they
have.
   Unix International said its version of Unix was the successor to
the software on more than 80 percent of all currently installed
Unix systems.
   The Open Software Foundation countered that an independent
survey by International Data Corp. found that its members and
sponsors accounted for more shipments of Unix last year than the
Unix International-affiliated companies.
   AT&amp;T invented Unix but had to surrender control over its
development to Unix International to avoid abandonment of the
standard it created.

   Crude oil futures prices advanced on largely
technical factors Tuesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, picked
up 22 cents to close at $19.94 per 42-gallon barrel after slipping
5 cents on Monday.
   Home heating oil futures also rose on technical factors. The
expiring November contract for heating oil rose 1 cent to 58.64
cents a gallon, and subsequent contract months also gained.
   The November contract for unleaded regular gasoline, which also
expired Tuesday, was down 0.94 cent to 52.47 cents a gallon.
Subsequent months were narrowly mixed.
   Analysts said gasoline prices fell on rumors that a large amount
of gas would be dumped onto the spot market, increasing supplies of
the fuel.
   Chris McCormack, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
said the oil market was not affected by any fundamental news.
Reports of problems at a refinery in West Germany had no impact on
prices, he said.
   The impending release of weekly oil and gasoline supply figures
also did not affect trading, McCormack said.
   After the session ended, the American Petroleum Institute
announced that U.S. stockpiles of crude and gasoline increased in
the week ended Oct. 27, while heating oil supplies declined.

<HEAD>United Machinists Say No to Davis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Machinists union said Tuesday it has no
intention of joining California billionaire Marvin Davis in another
attempt to buy UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.
   ``We've been contacted by Davis and we told him we weren't
interested,'' said James Conley, a spokesman for the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents
United mechanics and ground-crew workers.
   The unions representing United's pilots and flight attendants
said they, too, had been contacted by Davis but declined further
comment. The Los Angeles investor apparently is seeking their
support for a possible takeover bid following the failure of a
pilot-management group to secure financing for a $6.75 billion
buyout attempt.
   Davis put UAL into play with a $5.4 billion offer in August.
Both he and the pilots have said they are exploring the possibility
of making a new bid.
   UAL's stock rose 50 cents a share to $175.50 Tuesday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Meanwhile, a published report said the pilot-management group
has begun billing UAL for $53.7 million in fees and expenses
related to their failed bid.
   UAL declined comment on the Wall Street Journal report.
   According to the Journal story, a merger agreement reached on
Sept. 14 requires the UAL board of directors to reimburse certain
of the buyout group's expenses even though the transaction wasn't
completed.

<TEXT>
   The French domestic news agency Agence Centrale de
Presse announced Tuesday it was closing down, saying a job action
it described as illegal left no alternative.
   In response, the agency's staff issued a statement saying it was
ending ``the protest movement in the form in which it was begun''
and called on management to present a plan for restructuring to a
staff committee on Thursday.
   On Monday, the staff decided to suspend transmission of certain
kinds of articles _ daily wrap-ups and summaries _ demanding that
they be provided with an audit of ACP operations that was prepared
on the orders of Robert Maxwell, the British media tycoon who owns
66.8 percent of the agency's stock.
   Management responded with a statement saying the audit had to be
shown first to shareholders who were being asked to pay for
proposed steps to save the agency. ACP had losses of 20.5 million
French francs, or about $3.3 million, in 1988 on revenue of 31.7
million francs, or $5.1 million.
   Later in the day, ACP issued the statement saying Maxwell
``cannot in the circumstances continue to finance the structural
losses of the agency.'' It said management ``with great regret sees
itself obliged to announce that it has no alternative but to close
the agency.''
   ACP, established in 1951 by several provincial newspapers,
currently has a staff of 120, including about 90 journalists.
Approximately a dozen French newspapers subscribe to the service.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Boeing Co. and the Machinists
union were back at the bargaining table for a second day Tuesday,
with the federal mediator saying both sides were trying hard to
reach a settlement.
   Meanwhile, the 57,800 striking Machinists faced the expiration
of their health care benefits at midnight Tuesday, although they
could choose to continue the benefits by paying monthly premiums of
$128 to $354 themselves.
   Neither Boeing nor the Machinists union would comment on the
substance of the talks that began Monday, although Tom Baker,
president of Machinists District Lodge 751, said negotiators were
able to talk in great detail about the issues.
   Federal mediator Douglas Hammond, who convened the talks, also
would not discuss what was said but described the negotiations as
``cordial and professional.''
   ``These folks have a problem they're trying to solve and they
recognize it,'' he said.
   Hammond has said he wants to hold negotiations daily until a
settlement is reached.
   Machinists spokesman Jack Daniels said the union has a
counterproposal to the Boeing offer which its membership
overwhelmingly rejected Oct. 3, but he did not know whether it had
been presented.
   Daniels said the mood among pickets at Boeing plants ``is a
little cheerier'' now that talks have resumed.
   The strike began Oct. 4 after the union turned down a 3-year
offer that included pay raises of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3
percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3
percent in the second; cost-of-living increases to virtually cover
inflation; a reduction in mandatory overtime from 200 hours to 160
hours per quarter; and higher benefits.
   Strikers include 43,300 Machinists in the Seattle area; 12,000
in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 in Portland, Ore.; and a few hundred others
at scattered sites in California, Hawaii, Montana, Utah and other
states. Boeing has a total 164,000 workers worldwide and 106,000 in
Washington state.
   Machinists received their last paychecks Oct. 19 and the first
of their $100-a-week strike payments last Thursday. However, their
company-paid health plans remained in force through the end of
October.
   Boeing offers a variety of medical plans, but Daniels said the
cost of a medical plan for a single person would be $128.86 a
month, and for a family, $354.46. Striking workers have 60 days
after the health coverage ends to decide whether to continue the
coverage on their own.
   On Wednesday, Boeing begins ``maintable'' bargaining with its
second-largest union, the Seattle Professional Engineering
Employees Association, which represents about 30,000 engineers and
technical workers. Subcommittees of SPEEA and Boeing negotiators
have been meeting for the past week on various aspects of the
contract.
   Like the Machinists, SPEEA wants a substantial pay raise. SPEEA
officials say they believe they can work out an offer to present to
their members by mid-November, well in advance of the Dec. 1
contract expiration date.

<HEAD>Reebok Plans $15 Million Ad Campaign for Pump Basketball Shoe Intro</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sneaker maker Reebok unveiled its new
inflatable basketball shoe called The Pump on Tuesday, and said it
planned to spend an unusually large $15 million to advertise it.
   Its main competitor, Nike Inc., said it is already shipping
similar shoes called Nike Air Pressure to retailers although it has
not created special ads for them.
   Nike and Reebok are the leaders in athletic footwear, and their
new shoes are among the highest priced _ Reebok's cost $170 a pair
and Nike's cost $175.
   Frank O'Connell, president of Reebok North America, said
basketball shoes accounted for $300 million of Reebok's $1.3
billion in domestic sales last year. He said orders have already
been placed for 50,000 pairs of the new shoes, which were shown to
retailers earlier.
   Nike is the leader in basketball shoes with about 43 percent of
that market and sold $414 million in basketball shoes last year,
spokeswoman Elizabeth Dolan said.
   Atlanta Hawks basketball star Dominique Wilkins was on hand for
the introduction of the Reebok's Pump shoes at a news conference
held on the basketball court at Hunter College in Manhattan.
   He and NBA players Byron Scott, Danny Ainge, Dennis Johnson and
Doc Rivers, and coaches Pat Riley of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Digger Phelps of Notre Dame, appear in ads debuting later this
month in which they describe in unrehearsed and often humorous
style how the shoes work.
   The high-topped shoes have an orange button on the tongue that
can be pressed to pump air into a specially-designed plastic
bladder, forming a readily-adjusted cushion around the ankle, heel
and instep to support the foot and protect it against the damaging
effects of jarring, sudden moves.
   The air is released by depressing a separate valve on the back
collar of the shoe.
   Wilkins told the news conference the shoes provide a lot of
support, enabling him to skip taping his ankles as he normally does
with other shoes before playing.
   The shoes should start arriving in stores shortly after Nov. 15
and the company plans to spend $5 million on advertising them for
the final two months of 1989 and another $10 million in the first
six months of 1990, O'Connell said.
   The Nike Air Pressure shoes are inflated with a small plastic
hand pump that is separate from the shoe.
   Ms. Dolan said that while having the pump separate from the shoe
may not be convenient, Nike's tests showed an entirely internal
pump system could not withstand the beating shoes take in
tournament-style play.
   But Nike may be turning the separate pump to its advantage. It
sells the shoes and the pump in a special carrying case.
   Ms. Dolan said that emphasizes that the shoes are made for
people who are serious about basketball. ``They wear their regular
shoes to the court and change to their basketball shoes,'' she said.

<HEAD>Wendy's Earnings Flat in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wendy's International Inc. said Tuesday its
third-quarter profit was the same as a year ago, when the fast-food
chain had 46 more company-owned restaurants.
   The hamburger chain said its earnings for the quarter ended Oct.
1 were $8.7 million, or 9 cents a share, on revenue of $269.2
million, compared with earnings of the same amount on revenue of
$275.2 million in the same 1988 period.
   Systemwide sales _ total sales from company and franchise
restaurants _ were $787 million, compared with $758 million in the
same period last year.
   James W. Near, president, chief executive and chief operating
officer, said there were 46 fewer company restaurants, most of
which were sold to franchise owners.
   ``We also are addressing two major concerns that have slowed our
growth _ consistency and new unit development,'' Near said in a
statement. ``In the past year we've worked very hard at improving
consistency in operations.
   ``Next year we will renew our restaurant development program and
plan to break ground on at least 100 new restaurants systemwide in
1990.''
   Earnings for the first nine months of the year rose to $24.7
million, or 26 cents per share, compared with net income of $21.7
million, or 23 cents per share, in the same period last year.
   Systemwide sales totalled $2.3 billion for the nine months this
year, compared with $2.2 billion in the same 1988 period.
   As of Oct. 1, there were 3,754 Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers
restaurants worldwide, including 1,142 operated by the company.

<HEAD>Gulf Power Agrees to Plead Guilty in Mysterious Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf Power Co. pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal
conspiracy charges and paid a $500,000 fine in an agreement that
blamed most of the illegal activities on an executive killed last
April in an unexplained plane crash.
   The plea bargain involving the electric utility was announced by
U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr.
   The guilty pleas to two felonies do not affect a federal grand
jury probe into allegations of tax fraud against the Atlanta-based
parent Southern Co. and another subsidiary, Georgia Power, or an
investigation into the plane crash.
   Gulf Power, based in Pensacola, Fla., pleaded guilty to
violating a law prohibiting utilities from making political
contributions. It also pleaded guilty to conspiring to impede the
Internal Revenue Service through the creation of false or inflated
invoices.
   It was not immediately known which political campaigns were
involved in the charges.
   In a statement, Southern Co. President Edward Addison and Gulf
Power President Douglas L. McCrary said the pleas would allow Gulf
Power to avoid ``prolonged, distracting legal proceedings.''
   The investigation of Gulf Power includes the mysterious April 10
crash of a twin-engine Southern Co. plane that killed two company
pilots and Gulf Senior Vice President Jacob Horton, who was
suspected of accounting irregularities.
   Gulf Power officials have said they told Horton hours before his
death that a company committee was recommending his firing.
   Southern's statement Tuesday said violations were found in the
company's ``thorough review of actions taken or directed by''
Horton.
   A cockpit voice recorder recovered from the wreckage showed a
fire broke out in the back of the plane moments before the crash in
Pensacola.
   After the crash, an anonymous caller told police, ``You can stop
investigating Gulf Power now. We took care of that.''
   Fred Levin, a Pensacola lawyer whose firm represented Gulf
Power, was one of the last people to speak with Horton before the
crash.
   He subsequently found canaries on his doorstep, their necks
broken, an apparent gangland-style warning against ``singing'' to
authorities.

<HEAD>IMF Chief Says Third World Debt Talks Take Too Long</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks with banks to reduce the $1.3 trillion
debt of Third World countries are taking too long, Managing
Director Michel Camdessus of the International Monetary Fund
complained Tuesday.
   ``Meanwhile, countries are in difficulty,'' he said.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady outlined his ideas on
debt reduction March 10. Since then, committees representing
creditor banks have made tentative agreements with Mexico, the
Philippines and Costa Rica.
   On the most important deal, with Mexico, more than 400 banks
were due to report their decisions by midnight Tuesday to Citibank,
which heads the committee dealing with Mexican debt.
   The banks had a choice of reducing their share of Mexico's debt,
reducing its interest payments, making new loans to it, or some
combination of the three options. Their decisions will affect about
$53 billion of Mexico's debt, nearly half the total. Mexico's main
objective is to reduce the $12.8 billion it is due to pay this year
in interest on its debt.
   Camndessus defended the IMF's new policy of making new loans of
its own to the debtor countries before they come to an agreement
with private banks. A Frenchman, he is responsible to the 152
governments that own the fund, with the United States as the
biggest contributor.
   ``The banks have not understood,'' he said. ``They thought we
did not care about the arrears owed to them. We made our decision
with our eyes open. The purpose was to disburse a little first, to
show our committment and speed up the negotiations.''
   Negotiations between creditor banks and Venezuela have stalled.
Talks between the banks and Argentina, which is $4 billion behind
on its interest payments alone, were due to start in New York this
week.
   No progress can be made on the situation of Brazil, the biggest
Third World debtor, until after a government is installed after the
election scheduled for Nov. 15.
   Much of the IMF's attention is focused on Poland, in an effort
to help the new non-Communist government deal with the country's
$40 billion foreign debt, skyrocketing inflation and what one
official called its ``messy economy.'' The official, who spoke on
condition has name not be used, said the new government is trying
to move from a Communist economy to one ruled by market forces,
with inadequate structures and institutions, obsolete factories and
a totally distorted price system _ all amid the high expectations
of a country seeking more liberty.
   The IMF is trying to set up a 1-year program to prevent the
Polish economy from getting worse, in preparation for a 3-year
accord to be negotiated later.
   The official said it would take patience from the Poles and a
sustained effort by IMF donor countries.
   He pointed to the need for food aid in Poland, which he said was
extraordinary for such an industrialized country, but necessary so
that there are supplies on hand as prices are freed.
   Camdessus spoke to reporters at a meeting sponsored by the
Bretton Woods Committee, a private group concerned with the affairs
of the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank.

<HEAD>Helmsley Hotels Could Dry Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Manhattan hotels owned by Leona Helmsley
may lose their liquor licenses following the hotel queen's recent
conviction for federal tax evasion, a state official said.
   ``There are charges out and proceedings to revoke liquor
licenses of five hotels in which Leona Helmsley and Joseph C.
Licari are officers or directors,'' said Richard Chernela, a
spokesman for the State Liquor Authority.
   Under state law, a person convicted of a felony cannot sell
alcoholic beverages or have direct or indirect interest in liquor
licenses, Chernela said.
   Helmsley and her aide Licari were convicted of 33 counts of tax
evasion on Aug. 30 for evading payment of $1.2 million in federal
taxes.
   The five hotels are the Helmsley Palace, the Harley Hotel, the
Windsor Hotel, the Carlton House and the Park Lane Hotel.
   Helmsley, portrayed in advertisements as a persnickety hotel
queen, must apply to a state judge for a certificate of relief, he
said. If the certificate is granted, the State Liquor Authority
then has the choice of suspending or revoking the licenses, or
doing nothing, the spokesman said.
   But without the certificate, the hotels cannot sell alcohol
after Dec. 1, drying up restaurants, room service and banquets, he
said.
   Helmsley and Licari were notified Oct. 6 of the possible license
revocations, Chernela said. The liquor authority has not received a
response, he said.
   Richard O'Neill, a senior partner with the law firm of Sherry
and O'Neill, who is representing Helmsley before the liquor
authority, did not return phone calls seeking comment.

<HEAD>Stateswest Pulls Out Offer for Mesa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stateswest Airlines Inc. has withdrawn its offer
to buy Mesa Airlines Inc. because it did not receive a response to
the offer by a self-imposed deadline Tuesday, the company announced.
   Last week, Phoenix-based Stateswest proposed to the board of
directors of Mesa, based in Farmington, N.M., that it acquire 100
percent of Mesa's common stock for $7 a share cash and one share of
a new series of 6 percent convertible preferred stock of Stateswest.
   The chairman of Stateswest, Rudy R. Miller, said in a statement
that last week's offer was essentially a repeat of an earlier
offer, so Mesa had plenty of time to review the proposal. Miller
said that Mesa's refusal to act amounted to a rejection.
   Both airlines are regional carriers that serve the Southwest.
