<HEAD>Justice Marshall Says Court Risks Civil Rights of All Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall told a
group of federal judges Friday that recent high court decisions are
a risk to the civil rights of all citizens _ not just the rights of
minorities.
   Marshall said the court has ``come full circle'' back to the days
before its 1954 decision in Brown vs. Board of Education ended an
era of legal segregation, The New York Times reported in its
Saturday editions.
   Marshall made his remarks in Bolton Landing, N.Y., at an annual
meeting of federal judges from New York, Connecticut and Vermont. He
is the liaison officer for the judicial circuit in those states.
   ``It is difficult to characterize last term's decisions as the
product of anything other than a deliberate retrenching of the civil
rights agenda,'' Marshall said.
   Marshall dissented on several court rulings last term, including
decisions that make it more difficult to win lawsuits for employment
discrimination.
   Marshall said a restrictive approach to the rights of minorities
coincided with similar restrictions on the constitutional rights of
other groups, such as political dissenters.
   He said he feared that the rulings last term might pave the way
for the lowering of constitutional barriers separating church and
state.
   Referring to the court's change in its approach to civil rights,
Marshall said, ``We could sweep it under the rug and hide it, but
I'm not going to do it.''
   Marshall was concerned about the expansiveness of the court's
holdings, saying the court majority had gone beyond legal boundaries
of issues before the court to reach ``broad and wholly unnecessary''
conclusions.

   A 19-year-old man who was among seven people
arrested in the slaying of a black teen-ager by a gang of white
youths last month was indicted Friday on murder, manslaughter and
other charges.
   A state grand jury charged Joseph Serrano with second-degree
murder for showing a ``depraved indifference to life'' in the
shooting death of Yusuf Hawkins, Brooklyn District Attorney
Elizabeth Holtzman told a news conference.
   Police, meanwhile, said Friday that three white men screaming
``Get out, Spanish,'' beat two Hispanic brothers in the
predominantly white Bensonhurst neighborhood, where the original
attack occurred. No arrests were made.
   Hawkins, 16, and three friends were attacked by about 30 young
whites, many carrying baseball bats, before the teen-ager was shot
Aug. 23. The four blacks had gone to Bensonhurst to look at a used
car.
   ``The killing of Yusuf Hawkins not only took the life of a young
man full of promise, it also sent shock waves throughout our city,''
Holtzman said.
   Of the six other Bensonhurst youths arrested in the attack, three
_ Joseph Fama, 18; Keith Mondello, 19; and Pasquale Raucci, 18 _
have been indicted on murder charges. Fama is accused of being the
triggerman.
   Serrano, speaking at his lawyers' office several hours after the
indictment was handed up, extended his sympathy to Hawkins' family
but said he was not part of the gang that killed him.
   ``As far as I am concerned I am being railroaded,'' said Serrano,
who could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of murder.
   In addition to second-degree murder, Serrano was charged with
first-degree manslaughter, first-degree assault, riot, criminal
facilitation and criminal possession of a weapon, a loaded pistol.
He is not accused of actually shooting Hawkins.
   Serrano's attorney, James J. DiPietro, said the most serious
charge against Serrano when he surrendered to police Aug. 28 was
assault, and accused Holtzman of manipulating the grand jury to
obtain the murder charge in order to further her political career.
   Holtzman, a candidate for city comptroller, denied the allegation.
   Serrano remains free on $75,000 bail.
   The most recent victims in Bensonhurst, Enrique Andrade, 28, and
Luis Andrade, 22, were sitting on a bench on a street corner at 9:30
p.m. Thursday when they were approached by three white men,
estimated to be 16 to 21 years old.
   The whites shouted expletives and then screamed ``Get out,
Spanish'' as they punched, kicked and struck the men with a bottle,
said police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   The brothers, who work as independent contractors and live in the
area, managed to run away. They were treated for cuts and bruises
and released from Coney Island Hospital, Howard said.

   Beethoven was deaf when he composed some of his
greatest works. Carmelo Gannello, who is legally blind, and Tom
Woodward, a quadriplegic, also haven't let their disabilities stifle
their creativity.
   Their artworks appear in ``Imagination Without Barriers III,'' an
exhibition of works by professional disabled artists from around the
country that opened Friday.
   ``The disabled within the boundaries of their own imagination
really have no barriers,'' said Kathleen Yosko, vice president and
administrator of Chicago's Schwab Rehabilitation Center, which is
sponsoring the exhibition.
   Schwab organized its first disabled artists exhibition in 1987 to
help commemorate its 75th anniversary, drawing about 70 entries.
This year, a jury chose 46 works by 43 disabled artists from about
250 entries.
   There are also nine invited works by more prominent artists with
disabilities, including a lithograph by the late French painter
Henri Matisse, who worked from a wheelchair in his later years.
   Some of the artists have been inspired by their disabilities, but
for others, their art has come in spite of their ailments.
   D.W. Lundahl, 40, a polio victim from Beloit, Wis., is
represented by ``Walking Wounded,'' a set of three twisted welded
brass figures with straight crutches.
   ``With this exhibition, I celebrate my physical difference,''
Lundahl wrote in the exhibit's catalogue. ``By acknowledging the
impact that wearing a metal brace has had on my world view, I turn
adversity to affirmation.''
   Gannello, 69, of Oak Park, Ill., has suffered from detached
retinas for 35 years. Forced by blindness to quit work as a
commercial artist 20 years ago, he sells some of his work but lives
on Social Security and disability payments.
   Gannello's linocut, ``Eagle Eye,'' features a large ``E'' from an
eye-chart exam with two eyes in the background filled with
concentric black-and-white circles of varying sizes, representing
what he calls the ``floaters'' he sees constantly.
   ``I call it `art of the eye,''' Gannello said, in a telephone
interview. ``I want to show people how Carmelo sees the world with
his low vision.''
   Woodward, 40, has been battling his disability ever since a 1968
automobile accident left him a quadriplegic. He was an arts major in
college then.
   Woodward, who makes a living from his art, taught himself to draw
by weaving a pencil through his fingers, using his shoulder for big
strokes and manipulating his arm for finer work.
   ``It was a matter of training my large muscles to do the motor
work smaller muscles used to do,'' Woodward said from his home in
Opelika, Ala. ``The technique was just born out of my disability.''
   Woodward is represented by one of his graphite pencil drawings.
``Early October,'' which has a grainy, photo-like quality, shows a
woman lying in a bed.
   Ms. Yosko says one aim of the exhibition is to open opportunities
for disabled artists. The show moved this year from the Schwab
center to a gallery in the city's River North art district, where it
be until Sept. 29.
   The exhibit includes photographs, oil paintings, mixed media
creations, metal sculptures, pottery, and pencil sketches.
   The artworks will be sold at public auction _ with the proceeds
to be split between the artists and the non-profit private
rehabilitation center. Last year, the auction and a benefit evening
raised $61,000 overall, including $11,000 for the artists, Ms. Yosko
said.

   Forest Hill High School can keep the
nickname ``Rebels'' and the old colonel cartoon mascot, but the
Rebel flag is out.
   ``We are phasing out the Rebel flag ... because some groups feel
it is offensive,'' Principal Ennis Proctor said Thursday.
   ``It's better to phase out the flag than lose the mascot
altogether,'' Proctor said. ``Forest Hill has got a lot of pride and
a lot of good kids. We've got a lot of other good things going on to
get too upset over this.''
   School Board President Ollye Shirley said before classes started
this year that she was offended by the Confederate symbols.
   Students at Forest Hill said they were surprised when Proctor
announced the ban a week ago. Forest Hill's 1,000-member student
body is 68 percent white.
   ``When we wave that Rebel flag, it's got nothing to do with
prejudice,'' said Amy Durden, 17, a white senior. ``It's just our
school flag. I know black students at our school that wave the
flag.''

   Authorities shut down a makeshift day-care
center a bus company was running for its employees in a
stripped-down bus.
   ``They took the seats out and threw some carpeting down and they
were in business,'' said Groton building official Mark W. Tebbets.
   Inspectors from state and local fire, zoning, health and building
departments who arrived Thursday afternoon found three children
being cared for in the bus, which was parked near fuel tanks and a
trash bin at a bus depot.
   ``We cringe when the tanks are 200 feet away,'' said Wesley Bell,
the day-care licensing supervisor for the state Department of Health
Services.
   Eastern Bus Lines Inc. opened the center Tuesday. Owner George
Negro said he hired a baby sitter for children of drivers because a
new Board of Education policy prohibits parents from taking their
pre-schoolers with them when they drive their routes.
   ``The kids enjoy it. So do the parents,'' Negro said. ``I hate to
see anybody foul it up for the parents, for myself and for the
children.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir insists his peace
initiative is not dead, but in the five months since he announced it
the plan has only fostered divisions among both Palestinians and
Israelis.
   Just this week, the proposal caused arguments within the
left-leaning Labor Party and a squabble between Shamir and Labor
leader Shimon Peres. It also led to public criticism by Shamir of a
member of his own Likud bloc, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   All the arguments started with doves in the Labor Party declaring
that Shamir's peace initiative was stalled and might die if
something wasn't done to save it.
   ``They are wrong,'' Shamir said in an interview published Friday
in the Jerusalem Post. ``It was an illusion to think that such an
initiative ... can produce results in such a sort time, of a few
weeks, a few months.''
   He said he was still awaiting a positive response from
Palestinians in the occupied territories and from Arab nations to
his call for elections among Palestinians as a first step toward
negotiations on the final status of the occupied lands.
   But the arguments over his plan struck at what was supposed to be
its strength. Other than the elections, the plan offers nothing
specific to the Palestinians, who have carried on a revolt for
nearly 21 months against Israeli occupation.
   The plan's vagueness was designed to make it acceptable to both
sides of Israel's coalition government, Shamir's right-wing Likud
and center-left Labor. This worked, and the Cabinet accepted the
plan on May 14.
   But Palestinians immediately demanded that the elections lead
eventually to an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967
Middle East war.
   They also insisted the Palestine Liberation Organization, which
Israel considers a terrorist group, be part of any peace talks.
   Israel asked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's help in gaining
Palestinian support, but he first wanted answers to 10 questions
about the Israeli initiative.
   Two of these touched on the very points that divide Israel's
Cabinet: Will Israel give up occupied land to achieve peace? Will it
allow the 140,000 Arabs in east Jerusalem to vote?
   Likud refuses to give up any occupied land and rejects giving the
vote to Arabs in east Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel after
its capture in 1967. Labor accepts the U.S-backed formula of trading
land for peace and maintains east Jerusalem Arabs should cast
ballots, but outside the city. This week's arguments within Labor _
among the party's hawks and doves _ have been over just these points.
   For his part, Shamir wants no specifics added to the election
proposal.
   To head off a challenge from the far-right in Likud, he accepted
a party resolution rejecting land in exchange for peace and any vote
for east Jerusalem Arabs. But he insisted this did not change his
proposal.
   On Friday, in his Post interview, Shamir chastised Foreign
Minister Arens for suggesting the refusal to allow the vote in east
Jerusalem was official policy. ``This doesn't mean anything,'' he
said of Arens' statement.
   The prime minister, however, is under increasing pressure to
provide more specifics to entice Palestinians into elections.
   Labor doves referred to Mubarak's 10 questions in their demand to
get the peace plan moving. Sources in Washington also said the U.S.
government may use the Egyptian president's plan to press Shamir to
be specific.
   The prime minister shows no signs of giving in, however. He said
Thursday on Israel's Arab television channel he was willing to wait
a long time for Palestinians to accept his initiative as it stands.
   ``They will not see another plan proposed by us or any change in
the plan,'' Shamir said. ``There can be 10 points or 20 points, but
I see nothing to this.''
   ``There is no question of a time limit,'' he added. ``That would
be ridiculous.''

<HEAD>Architects Hit Back at Prince Charles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stop criticizing the style of Britain's new
buildings and take a closer look at why British cities are so
decrepit and ugly, leading architects are telling Prince Charles.
   ``Attacks on architects in an almost physical way are not
conducive to sitting down and getting to the next stage,'' Peter
Carolin, professor of architecture-elect at Cambridge University,
said Friday.
   His challenge closed out a week in which modern architecture was
front-page news, with the heir to the throne having a book published
that dismissed some modern British buildings as ``Frankenstein
monsters.''
   Two of Charles' targets took advantage of an offer to reply, made
by British Broadcasting Corp.'s national television network.
   One was Sir Denys Lasdun, whose National Theater the prince
compared to a ``nuclear power station in the middle of London.''
   Lasdun defended his concrete construction and compared its wide
interior spaces with the great amphitheaters of ancient Greece.
Critics were looking too much at the outsides of buildings and not
enough at the comfort and pleasure within, he said.
   The second target was Colin St. John Wilson. The prince likened
his red-brick British Library, now under construction, to a secret
police headquarters.
   Wilson said he had related the library to its neighbor, the
Victorian train station of St. Pancras, and to the local housing,
and had done everything to give readers natural daylight for their
studies.
   The architects argued that Britain gets ugly buildings and dreary
cities because it is too mean to want buildings of beauty,
preferring the job done fast and cheap. They said the culprits are
usually developers and accountants looking for quick profits.
   The prince has been campaigning for five years for better
buildings and an improved environment. His book, ``A Vision of
Britain,'' sets out his 10 principles to govern building design.
They include harmony with the surroundings, a human scale and use of
local materials.
   The prince likes classical-style buildings with decoration. His
opponents say buildings must reflect their time.
   Many architects resent the high public profile given to Charles'
criticisms because of his privileged position, but the profession
congratulated him on starting a great public debate.
   Carolin said: ``I hope the prince will now stop talking so much
about purely superficial stylistic issues. ... We have got to turn
to the things that really influence our society _ the quality of
life, the prosperity of our cities and from that the prosperity of
the nation.''
   Maxwell Hutchinson, president of the Royal Institute of British
Architects, said the problem was not just ``all that office space,''
which Charles condemns for scarring the London skyline, but the ``1
million homes in this country unfit for human habitation.''
   Richard Rogers, Britain's leading high-technology architect,
contrasted London unfavorably with Paris.
   Paris has a center, the Pavillon de l'Arsenal, where the public
can inspect designs for the hundreds of building projects in the
French capital as it seeks to become the economic and cultural
powerhouse of Europe after the creation in 1992 of a single market
for the 12-nation European Economic Community.
   ``Winning the commercial battle for 1992 is a matter of life and
death,'' said Rogers, who designed the Pompidou arts center in Paris
and the soaring Lloyd's building in London's City financial district.
   ``London is in danger of losing its advantages and slipping its
position,'' he said. ``It is not trying hard enough to improve
itself, to think about what kind of city it ought to be, to make
itself attractive to the Japanese, the Americans, the Europeans and,
of course, to its citizens.''
   ``We have forgotten the art of creating cities. We don't think
enough about the way we want to live.''

<HEAD>Government Investigators to Check Nuclear Plants in Three States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is sending
teams of federal inspectors to nuclear weapons plants in Tennessee,
Texas and Ohio to check compliance with environmental, health and
safety rules.
   The investigations are part of a broader effort by Watkins to
identify potentially debilitating problems at the 17 major weapons
plants owned by the department, and to try to reassure Congress that
flaws are being corrected.
   The department was embarrassed earlier this summer by a surprise
FBI raid on the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado. The
FBI checked out allegations of improper and illegal handling of
wastes at the site.
   The criminal investigation has gone to a grand jury, but no
charges have resulted.
   The plants earmarked for special DOE investigations are the
Pantex weapons assembly plant at Amarillo, Texas; the Y-12 plant in
Oak Ridge, Tenn., which makes uranium and other nuclear materials;
and the Mound plant near Dayton, Ohio, which produces detonators and
other components for nuclear weapons.
   In announcing the inspections, Watkins did not say whether any
environmental or safety violations were suspected at any of the
three weapons plants.
   He also gave no specific date for the start of the inspections,
expected to begin later this month, but said they would take place
over a five-week period. Inspectors from the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration will participate in the assessments and
officials from the states involved will be invited to observe, he
said.
   In July, Watkins sent groups of federal inspectors to a nuclear
facility in West Valley, N.Y., and a uranium processing center at
Fernald, Ohio. Results of those environmental and safety
investigations have not been disclosed.
   Watkins said special inspections of all 18 major federal nuclear
weapons facilities would be completed by June 30.
   New doubts about the department's commitment to safety were
raised Friday by environmentalists and arms control experts who
questioned Watkins' decision to restart an aging nuclear weapons
reactor in South Carolina before all safety issues are settled.
   Watkins announced Thursday that the Savannah River reactor, near
Aiken, S.C., would begin low-power testing late next summer and then
enter production by year's end. The reactor has been shut down for
more than a year for safety reasons.
   The department is studying the environmental impact of a Savannah
River restart, but it has refused to promise to complete the work
before firing up the reactor.
   David Albright, senior staff scientist at the Federation of
American Scientists, said in a telephone interview Friday that
Watkins appeared to have caved in to pressure from the Pentagon to
get the reactor running as soon as possible. The facility is the
only source of tritium, a perishable gas needed to make nuclear
warheads.
   ``It's tiring to see Watkins confusing our national security with
making the Defense Department angry,'' Albright said.
   Paul Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, which
specializes in nuclear non-proliferation issues, said there was no
need to resume tritium production even if the Savannah River plant
were determined to be entirely safe.
   ``There is no crisis in tritium supply for nuclear warheads that
justifies premature restart'' at Savannah River, Leventhal said.
   Watkins has provided few details about the reactor restart plan,
and Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which operates the plant for
the Energy Department, has said little about the project.
   Becky Apter, a Westinghouse spokeswoman at the plant site, said
Friday no officials were available to discuss the matter.

<HEAD>Report Accuses Somali Army Of Murdering 5,000 Civilians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Somali Army deliberately killed at least
5,000 unarmed civilians in the 10 months preceding last March,
according to a report given to the State Department.
   The report said the army killed 500 men of the Isaak clan, most
of whom died with their throats cut, and buried them in a mass
grave, according to an account of the report published Saturday by
The New York Times in a dispatch from Nairobi, Kenya.
   A U.S. official, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, said the report, prepared by Robert Gersony, an outside
consultant to the State Department, placed the overall death toll in
Somalia between 5,000 and 10,000, although it estimated that the
number probably is closer to the lower end of that range.
   The Somali government has denied the killings, the Times reported.
   The Somali government has repeatedly been accused of human rights
abuses, including one incident this summer in which 46 men were
reported to have been summarily executed by the army after Moslem
rioting that left 400 people dead.
   The human rights group Africa Watch and other independent sources
said the people were killed after Somali soldiers started shooting
at houses in Mogadishu, the nation's capital.
   Gersony's report was based on more than 250 interviews with
Somali refugees, the Times reported.
   The United States recently suspended $2.5 million in military aid
and $21 million in econimic aid to Somalia to express objection to
that government's human rights abuses, the Times said.

<HEAD>FDA, Industry Reassures Panel on Milk Cartons, Dioxin</HEAD>

   The Food and Drug Administration and the
nation's paper industry say cancer-causing dioxins in milk cartons
are being reduced to a virtually untraceable level.
   ``We expect ... that dioxin contamination of paper milk cartons
will be effectively eliminated in the very near future,'' James S.
Benson, the FDA's acting deputy administrator, told a House panel
Friday.
   ``They haven't finished the job, but they're definitely moving in
that direction.''
   The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the
environment was told that only one of the six U.S. paper mills that
make the cartons _ the Potlatch Corp. mill at Lewiston, Idaho _ is
still making polyethylene-coated cardboard with traces of dioxin
high enough to measurably contaminate milk.
   Dioxin is the most potent carcinogenic chemical compound ever
tested in laboratory animals, although it has never been shown to
cause cancer in humans.
   Red Cavaney, president of the American Paper Institute, said
Potlatch had reduced the dioxin level of its milk cartons by 46
percent in the last year and that the five other plants had cut it
by as much as 90 percent.
   The FDA reported last week that tests indicated that dioxin had
leached into milk from four of 15 sampled half-pint cartons produced
by the six mills.
   Benson estimated the risk of getting cancer from drinking milk
from dioxin-contaminated milk cartons over a lifetime at less than 5
in 1 million.
   Subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., said he wouldn't
be satisfied until all avoidable dioxin had been eliminated from
milk cartons as well as a wide variety of other paper products,
including disposable diapers, toilet paper, coffee filters, tea bags
and TV dinners.
   ``There is continuing scientific disagreement over some
characteristics of the dioxin risk, but no one believes that
avoidable exposure to dioxin is acceptable,'' Waxman said.
   Benson said the FDA had not completed its studies into the
possible migration of dioxin traces from other paper products into
food.
   ``We believe the manufacturing changes now in progress will
reduce, if not eliminate, this source of these compounds in food,''
he said. ``We thought milk was the most important, so that's why we
started there.''
   Dioxin makes its way into paper products through chlorine
bleaching to whiten and strengthen the material.
   Dixon has never been shown to have caused cancer in humans, but
the animal studies have raised concerns among scientists. In high
doses, dioxin has been proved to cause acne and some studies have
suggested it can also contribute to reproductive disorders.
   Cavaney said laboratory tests of milk carton samples taken from
the six mills in early summer showed only the Potlatch plant's board
had a dioxin level above the measurable threshold of 2 parts per
trillion.
   The plant, he said, is in the midst of a $145 million improvement
program to reduce the dioxin traces to well below the threshold by
the end of 1990.
   Samples from International Paper Co.'s plant at Texarkana, Texas,
measured at 2 ppt, Cavaney said, adding that the changes being made
in its production methods will reduce the dioxin content of its
paper milk cartons to below the threshold by the end of this year.
   Cavaney said the four mills producing 75 percent of the nation's
paper cartons with dioxin contents too low to cause any measurable
contamination are: International Paper at Pine Bluff, Ark.; a
Weyerhaeuser Co. facility at Longview, Wash.; Champion International
Corp.'s Canton, N.C., plant; and Westvaco Corp.'s plant at
Covington, Va.

<HEAD>Educators Helping Students Cheat on Standardized Tests, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pressure to achieve rapid school reform is
prompting some educators to help students cheat on standardized
achievement tests, a report charges.
   The problem is worsened by ``totally inadequate'' test security
in nearly every state, concludes ``The `Lake Wobegon Report': How
Public Educators Cheat on Achievement Tests.''
   The report says cheating is contributing to misleadingly high
scores on the most widely used standardized achievement tests in
grade schools, making it seem in thousands of districts like ``all
the children are above average'' as in author Garrison Keillor's
mythical Minnesota town of Lake Wobegon.
   The Associated Press obtained a draft of the report, which was
conducted by Friends for Education, a watchdog group headed by
Albuquerque, N.M., physician John Jacob Cannell. The Kettering
Family Foundation in Dayton, Ohio, financed it with a $25,000 grant.
   All but two states, Louisiana and Arizona, are reporting
above-average scores, according to the 50-state survey. Those states
recently started using new tests.
   Eighty-three percent of 5,143 elementary school districts and 73
percent of 4,501 secondary districts surveyed are reporting
standardized achievement test scores above national norms, according
to the report.
   High achievement test scores have misled many into believing that
although the nation's schools may be at risk, their own schools are
improving each year, the report said.
   The cheating includes teachers and principals coaching students
on test questions, giving students more than the allotted time to
take tests, and even altering answer sheets.
   Many states have added new standardized test requirements in
recent years as part of the school reform effort. In some states,
educators' careers can now be made or broken and school districts
can even be subject to state takeover partly on the strength of test
scores.
   The report placed the blame for cheating not so much on teachers
or principals, but on the pressures for educational quick fixes by
parents, politicians and the media.
   ``These tests that were once used only as instructional aids now
assess class achievement, school achievement, and district
achievement through student's scores,'' the report said. ``As such,
the class results then become the teacher's scores, the school's
results become the principal's score, and the district's results
become the superintendent's score.''
   Cannell said in an interview Friday that besides gathering test
data from all 50 states, he placed an ad in the May 3 issue of the
trade journal Education Week inviting educators to reveal test
cheating.
   Cannell said he received more than 300 letters from teachers,
college professors who once taught grade school, and school
administrators admitting they or collegues had tampered with tests
or helped students improperly. All demanded anonymity.
   A Tennessee teacher wrote that teachers in his school ``spent the
morning teaching the test and the afternoon giving it.''
   ``It appears that there are teachers in every school now who
cheat,'' the teacher wrote. ``The most common way is to teach the
test.''
   National Education Association spokesman Howard Carroll, whose
organization is the nation's largest teacher union, said the NEA
hadn't seen the report and couldn't comment on it directly.
   ``We would certainly deplore any cheating by teachers,'' Carroll
added. ``We don't feel it's widespread. But the report certainly
indicates this obsessive pressure on schools by the marketplace to
increase student scores on standardized tests. And we deplore that.''
   Scott Thomson, executive director of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, said, ``We do have educational
malpractice, let's not kid ourselves, just as we have medical
malpractice.''
   But he added that it's not improper for schools to use old
versions of a test to help students prepare for a newer version, and
said it was possible some teachers were incorrectly identifying that
practice as cheating.
   Cannell first documented that students in all 50 states were
scoring above average on commercial achievement tests in 1987.
   His first report, later verified by a U.S. Department of
Education-sponsored study, asserted that scores on such
``norm-referenced'' tests _ designed so that only half the students
taking it should score above the 50th percentile _ were artificially
high largely because the norms were not being updated often enough
by test publishers.
   Those tests include the California Achievement Test, the Stanford
Achievement Test, the Metropolitan Achievement Test, the Science
Research Associates Test, the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills,
and the Iowa Test of Basic Skills.
   Test publishers have argued that it's expensive to re-norm tests
as frequently as critics like Cannell demand, and defend their tests
as useful tools to identify pupil or group strengths and weaknesses.
   Few states randomly audit test scores to uncover improprieties,
according to the study. California, one the few that does, caught 50
schools cheating during the last three years on the statewide
achievement testing program.
   According to the report:
   _ Only 16 states forbid test administrators to receive tests
earlier than the day they are to be given. Four others are
instituting such guidelines.
   _ Six states forbid teachers from reading test booklets; seven
others plan to.
   _ Only a dozen states require that test booklets be sealed.
   Drafts of the report were reviewed this summer by a dozen testing
authorities, child psychiatrists and educators, including Chester
Finn Jr., former assistant U.S. education secretary.
   Finn, a professor of education at Vanderbilt University, called
the report ``a constructive and useful piece of work,'' and said he
agreed with Cannell that reporting ``rosy local scores has
contributed to a sense of unwarranted contentment at the local and
state level.''
   ``If Cannell is right, and his track record is such that he
probably is,'' Finn said, ``states are so lax and sloppy in
organizing test security that it's like letting Exxon monitor water
quality in Prince William Sound.''

<HEAD>FAA to Order DC-10 Engine Inspections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration will order
exhaustive inspections of all DC-10 engines as a result of a July
crash in Sioux City, Iowa, that killed 112 people, an agency
official says.
   Anthony Broderick, FAA associate administrator, said in an
interview Friday that the agency expects within a few weeks to order
inspections of the metal in all General Electric CF6-6 engines such
as those in the DC-10 that crash-landed July 19 in Sioux City.
   Broderick said the expected FAA-ordered inspections would take 40
hours each, and could cause some flight disruptions.
   However, officials say the investigation into the crash is being
hampered because a large section of the tail engine of United Flight
232 has not been found.
   With 8-foot corn stalks and 4-foot soybean plants obscuring much
of the ground in the flight path, authorities in Washington and Iowa
said Friday they hope the harvest season will uncover parts vital to
investigation.
   GE has offered a total of $279,000 in rewards for all the missing
parts of the tail engine.
   Investigators have said they believe the middle engine
disintegrated, severing hydraulic lines that control flight. Pilots,
relying on engine thrust, guided the plane to a crash landing in
which 184 people survived.
   Both the search and investigation are focusing on the large
titanium fan disk, which Broderick said probably broke into two or
three pieces. Rewards total $50,000 for the whole 300-pound disk.
   GE, United and American airlines already have begun testing some
engine fan disks for flaws. Each test involves sophisticated
technology using low-frequency sound waves to probe for cracks the
size of a pinhead, Broderick said.
   Microscopic flaws in the metal's crystal structure were detected
in one disk, Broderick said. The disk had been used on 10,000
flights and the flaws had to have been there since it was
manufactured, he said.
   Broderick said there was no proof that such flaws caused the Iowa
crash, but that it was prudent to check all the CF6-6 engines for
any problem that might have caused the revolving disk to break apart
in flight.
   ``We haven't found anything yet that leads us to say, `Aha,''' he
said. ``And we don't expect to until we find that disk.''
   GE spokesman David Lane said the company had been low key in
announcing the reward because it doesn't want to cause problems for
farmers along the flight path. An Aug. 31 deadline for collecting
reward money has been extended indefinitely, he said.
   ``As the farmers get out into the fields with combines and
tractors, we hope more parts will turn up,'' he said.
   Sheriff Chuck Eddy of Buenavista County, Iowa, said in a
telephone interview that fields over a 16-square-mile area where the
search has been concentrated are too muddy for much of a search this
weekend.
   Only seven aircraft parts have come in since the reward offer,
Eddy said.
   Meanwhile, the Air Transport Association announced that a special
government-industry task force on Monday will announce results of a
yearlong look into aging McDonnell Douglas airliners. The group is
expected to make recommendations for mandatory servicing and
modification of older DC-8s, DC-9s and DC-10s.
   Broderick said the recommendations would focus on structural and
other problems associated with aging aircraft, not on potential
engine problems.

<HEAD>Reid Says Impeacment Trial Of Federal Judge Is Waste Of Money</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A member of the Senate committee reviewing
evidence in the impeachment case of U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon
says two days of hearings were a waste of taxpayer money.
   The House unanimously voted to impeach Nixon on charges of lying
about his knowledge of a narcotics case involving the son of a
wealthy businessman who had sold Nixon lucrative oil properties.
   But Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Friday that he had not heard
any evidence indicating that Nixon had done anything wrong.
   ``Unless I can be convinced otherwise in the next few days, I can
think of very few instances that were a bigger waste of taxpayers'
money,'' Reid said.
   The judge was convicted by a federal court on the perjury charges
and is serving a five-year prison term, but continues to collect his
$89,500 annual salary.
   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., chairman of the 12-member committee
that will summarize the evidence for the full Senate, said the
senators would make up their own minds, but advised Nixon's lawyer
that he didn't need ``a parade of character witnesses'' when the
defense presents its case starting Tuesday.
   ``There has been substantial testimony already as to the good
character of Judge Nixon'' by the witnesses called by the House,
Fowler said.
   The dispute over Nixon's involvement in the narcotics case
revolves around whether a conversation he had with the local
prosecutor constituted a ``discussion'' of the case.
   The prosecutor, Paul ``Bud'' Holmes, testified that Nixon did not
influence the outcome because he had already arranged a plea bargain
for the defendant.
   Nixon told a grand jury he never discussed the case with the
prosecutor or influenced anyone as to it outcome.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., who is leading the House case against
Nixon said after Friday's session that the issue was simply whether
Nixon lied.
   ``This is a perjury case,'' he said. ``We've never pretended it
was anything else.''
   The case against Nixon, as described by witnesses Thursday and
Friday began as a probe into his business dealings with Wiley
Fairchild, 76, a wealthy oil man in Hattiesburg, Miss.
   In early 1980, the judge bought interest in wells from Fairchild
with money he borrowed from Fairchild to be paid back as the wells
began to produce.
   In August 1980, Fairchild's son, Drew, was arrested on charges
related to marijuana smuggling at the airport where he worked.
   Drew Fairchild arranged a plea bargain with federal authorities
and avoided prison time but later was indicted by a state grand jury.
   The elder Fairchild testified Thursday that he thought the state
indictment was an effort by Holmes to blackmail him into paying more
legal fees for his son.
   Wiley Fairchild said he called Nixon, whom he considered his
friend because of their oil dealings, and complained.
   Nixon then got together with Holmes and, according to Holmes'
testimony, said Wiley Fairchild had asked him ``to put in a good
word for his boy.''
   Since a plea bargain had already been reached, Holmes said he and
Nixon decided to call Wiley Fairchild.
   According to Fairchild's testimony, Nixon told him over the
phone, ``Everything is going to be handled to your satisfaction.''
   During Holmes' testimony early in the day Friday, Reid asked him
if he and Nixon weren't simply ``trying to ingratiate yourselves
with a rich man in your community by, in effect, doing nothing for
him?''
   Holmes said that was right.
   The articles of impeachment allege:
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case
against Drew Fairchild with Holmes.
   _Nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do
officially or unofficially with the Fairchild case and never
influenced anyone in the case.
   _Nixon undermined ``the integrity of the judiciary'' and
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during
an interview with federal investigators and in his sworn grand jury
testimony.

<HEAD>Gingrich Defends Use Of Staff For Clerical Work On Book</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich says he was
operating within House rules when he used his congressional staff to
perform clerical work on a book he wrote in 1984.
   ``What we did was entirely, precisely appropriate,'' the Georgia
Republican said Friday in response to allegations made by a former
staffer in the October issue of the magazine, Mother Jones.
   In the magazine article, Dolores Adamson said she resigned from
Gingrich's district staff in 1983 after returning from a vacation to
find that Gingrich had put the district office staff to work copying
the book.
   ``In my mind, it was illegal,'' Ms. Adamson was quoted as saying.
   Gingrich said his staff did copying, proofreading and other
clerical tasks on his book, ``Window of Opportunity.'' But he said
House rules permit such activity as long as the book deals with a
public policy issue _ which he insisted his book did _ and the
staffers work at least 40 hours a week on congressional duties.
   House Democrats have filed a complaint with the ethics committee
alleging that Gingrich violated House rules and federal campaign
laws by creating an unusual partnership to promote the book. But the
complaint does not accuse Gingrich of any improprieties in the use
of his staff to work on the book.
   The committee has hired the Chicago law firm of Richard J. Phelan
to review the complaint and recommend whether it should launch a
formal investigation.
   Phelan was the ethics committee's independent counsel in the
investigation of former Speaker Jim Wright. Gingrich said Phelan's
investigation supports his contention that House rules permit
members of Congress to use staffers to work on books dealing with
public policy.
   One of the allegations against Wright was that he used members of
his congressional staff to help put together his book, ``Reflections
of a Public Man.'' Gingrich said Phelan ``specifically exonerated
Wright'' on that charge.
   Gingrich, who filed the ethics complaint that led to the
investigation and eventual resignation of Wright, disclosed last
year that his former administrative assistant, Frank Gregorsky,
reviewed and edited the book.
   But he said Friday that Gregorsky actually had left his staff by
the time he began working on the book.
   ``To the best of my knowledge,'' he said, the only work his
congressional staff did on the book ``was purely clerical stuff.''
   ``I did the entire initial draft,'' he said. ``We didn't delegate
all that stuff. We're talking about whether or not somebody helped
(copy) things. ... All the rewrite was done at private expense, by a
private coauthor who got paid a royalty and got paid in advance by a
private publisher.''

   Actor Burt Reynolds' idea to expand
business at his ranch is causing some disagreement.
   Reynolds wants a zoning change for the B.R. Ranch, where he lives
and has a feed store, souvenir shop and petting farm.
   His plan to add a gas station and car wash, double the size of
the souvenir shop and build shops and offices was approved by a Palm
Beach County advisory panel Thursday.
   County site planner James Youngblood said the zoning change is
appropriate for the site in rural Jupiter. Earlier, a county staff
report called the planned development ``too intense'' and said it
would ``create a lone commercial pocket'' in a rural area.
   County commissioners will consider the plan at a public hearing

<HEAD>Congressional Negotiators Set Higher Spending For Arms Plant Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators are compromising
on a spending bill that gives President Bush less than he requested
for nuclear weapons production but more than he wants to correct
environmental damage at the arms plants.
   The measure earmarks $1.65 billion for environmental cleanup in
the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, compared with $1.3 billion
requested by Bush.
   The provision was part of a $13.84 billion appropriations bill
for energy and water development projects worked out late Thursday
after a full day of deliberation by House and Senate negotiators.
   The bill settled differences in the appropriations bills passed
by the House in late June and by the Senate in late July. Final
approval by both houses is necessary before the measure goes to Bush
for his signature.
   The administration had requested $13.82 billion for the energy
and water projects.
   House and Senate negotiators agreed to smaller sums than
requested by Bush for nuclear weapons activities _ $4.58 billion
instead of $4.63 billion _ as well as smaller amounts for the
nuclear materials production system _ $2.16 billion instead of $2.21
billion.
   Congress has sought to push the Energy Department to speed
cleanup of the radioactive and toxic wastes that have piled up at
the nuclear weapons plants over the past four decades, in some cases
contaminating groundwater and soil near the facilities.
   Among the funds appropriated for waste cleanup was $27.6 million
to bring the Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash., into
compliance with environmental standards, and $29.1 million for a
Hanford ``vitrification'' facility designed to treat radioactive
waste by turning it into a glass-like substance.
   The measure also provides $55 million for environmental, health
and safety improvements at the Feed Materials Production Center,
near Fernald, Ohio, which processes uranium for the weapons program
and has suffered extensive environmental damage.
   An additional $26.7 million was appropriated for unspecified
environmental and safety improvements at other plants.
   Among other energy projects to be financed in the coming budget
year is a modification to the plutonium recovery facility, known as
Building 371, at the Rocky Flats weapons plant near Denver. The bill
appropriates $45 million for that work.
   Another provision of the bill earmarks $225 million for the
superconducting supercollider, a massive physics installation at
which scientists plan to explore the nature of matter and energy.
The facility, expected to cost $5.9 billion, will be built in Ellis
County, Texas.
   The Bush administration had requested $250 million for the
project for 1990.

<HEAD>Storms Hit Midwest; One Dead, Widespread Flooding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms hit parts of Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska,
causing hail, tornadoes and flooding that swept two boys into a
storm drain.
   Flooding was widespread Friday afternoon and evening across
northern portions of the Kansas City, Mo., metropolitan area.
   Robert Ragsdale, 13, was killed when he was swept into a storm
drain in North Kansas City about 5 p.m., police said. A friend,
William East, 14, was in critical condition at North Kansas City
Hospital late Friday, a hospital spokesman said.
   Police said the boys were playing in a drainage ditch when they
were swept into the drain tunnel.
   ``They were riding the drainage ditch like a water slide and the
water current just got too strong,'' said Bob Jones, a spokesman for
the Kansas City Police Department.
   More than 3{ inches of rain fell in the Kansas City area late
Friday.
   The cities of Parkville, Claycomo and Liberty in suburban Kansas
City reported minor street flooding, and officials evacuated a day
care center in Riverside.
   In Lincoln, Neb., more than an inch of rain fell in 25 minutes,
and the Topeka, Kan., area received nearly 5 inches of rain on
Friday, the National Weather Service said.
   Large hail fell in Kansas near Concordia, Washington and
Fairmount.
   Two tornadoes also were reported in the state. Fort Riley
military police said a tornado touched down about 7:20 p.m. at the
army base in open range land in Riley County, and another funnel
cloud was reported in Kingman at 8:20 p.m., about 30 miles west of
Wichita, officials said. No damage or injuries were reported.
   A third tornado touched down near Thurman, Iowa, and thunderstorm
winds gusted to 60 mph at Wichita, Kan., and Douglas, Kan.
   The weather service's regional forecast today called for showers
and thunderstorms with a chance of heavy rains.

<HEAD>Mitchell Challenges Bush To Say How He'd Pay For New Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says the
gap between President Bush's ``words and deeds'' is growing, and
that the president says too little about how he'll pay for major
initiatives.
   ``We saw it on space. The president wants to go to Mars, but
there is no plan, no timetable, no price given,'' the Maine Democrat
said.
   In a wide-ranging interview with a group of reporters Friday,
Mitchell said Bush advocates bold new programs but seems to want
Congress to worry about how to finance them.
   Mitchell said, for instance, that Bush provided too little help
for Congress in recommending how money could be moved around in the
fiscal 1990 budget to cover the $716 million the president wants to
spend beyond what was initially envisioned for anti-drug abuse
efforts.
   Bush earlier in the week called such questions ``carping'' and
challenged Democrats to back his plan.
   ``I think that what is going to happen is that the appeal of the
president's position is going to erode,'' Mitchell said. ``The gap
between his rhetoric and action, words and deeds, continues to
grow.''
   Mitchell said he didn't know how long Bush could uphold his 1988
campaign pledge against any general tax increases, but said the
Democrats won't make ``a cavalry charge'' for such increases without
his support.
   Mitchell said lawmakers already are struggling to pass 13
appropriations bills to carry out the $1.17 trillion budget
blueprint agreed upon earlier for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   ``This is a really tough task,'' he said. ``We've reached an
agreement almost universally criticized as being inadequate and not
going far enough, and that hasn't even been enacted.''
   Unless lawmakers find a way to cut next year's projected deficit
to $110 billion by Oct. 15, the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law
will automatically trigger spending cuts in many programs.
   ``So we face these constant and, it seems, accelerating,
pressures'' to reduce the federal deficit and ``deal with these
emerging demands,'' Mitchell said.
   He said he doubts the House and Senate will meet an Oct. 1
deadline for passing the money bills _ as the two chambers did last
year for the first time in 12 years.

<HEAD>Analysts Predict Slower Rate of Borrowing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans will continue to borrow for the
remainder of the year but at a slower pace, analysts say after a
government report that consumer debt fell in July for the first time
in 2{ years.
   ``Consumer borrowing has slowed down and will continue to be
slower than it was for two reasons,'' Larry Chimerine, senior
economic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said Friday.
   One reason is that consumer spending is weaker, particularly on
durable goods, big-ticket items that people generally finance with
loans, Chimerine said.
   ``And secondly, the high debt levels for many families has
discouraged people from borrowing more and, even when they spend,
they are being forced to pay more cash,'' he said.
   The Federal Reserve reported Friday that consumer debt in July
fell $280 million, a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent annual rate of
decline. It was the first drop since borrowing fell 3.4 percent, or
$1.63 billion, in January 1987.
   Although it increased, borrowing also was slower in June than
previously thought, the Fed said. The pace was revised downward
Friday from 5.1 percent to 4.7 percent, or $2.72 billion.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with The Futures Group here, said the
decline in borrowing in July, although temporary, reflects a
cautious consumer.
   She said consumer credit should pick up, but added, ``I don't
think we should expect any major boom in consumer spending.''
   Ms. Shaber noted that automobile sales, which were down in June,
had begun to rise in July and advanced a ``hefty amount'' last
month, so August consumer credit should be expected to increase.
   But many analysts don't expect the August pace to continue
because it was driven in large part by end-of-model-year incentives
and announced 1990-model price increases.
   Auto loans, which represent a major portion of consumer debt,
fell in July for the second straight month, down 6 percent after a
2.3 percent decline in June.
   The Fed said auto loans dropped $1.46 billion in July after
falling $549 million in June. Auto loans had risen 4.5 percent in
May and 3.3 percent in April.
   Borrowing for mobile homes declined for the sixth straight month,
down $60 million or 3 percent on an annual basis.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate also
dropped, $26 million or 0.2 percent on an annual basis. That
compared with advances of 2.5 percent in June and 7.2 percent in May.
   The only category to show an increase was revolving credit, which
includes credit cards, but even that rose at a slower pace than in
previous months.
   The Fed said revolving credit rose 8 percent, to $1.27 billion.
It had advanced 20.1 percent in June and 13 percent in May.
   The various changes left total consumer debt in July at a
seasonally adjusted $700.57 billion.

<HEAD>Envoys' Union Sues State Department over Appointments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union that represents career diplomats is
taking legal steps to combat what it calls a disturbing pattern by
the White House of appointing incompetents to key ambassadorships.
   The American Foreign Service Association filed suit Friday in
U.S. District Court, naming Secretary of State James A. Baker III as
the defendant.
   The highly unusual move follows the nomination by the White House
of a number of envoys who have come under sharp criticism on grounds
they have neither the diplomatic skills nor background knowledge of
the countries where they are being sent.
   Some Democrats charge that the nominations amount to political
payoffs for Republicans who contributed generously to the party in
last year's presidential campaign or demonstrated skill in raising
funds for the party.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., has described some of the choices as
``insulting.''
   The suit is the latest salvo in a long-simmering conflict in
which career diplomats often complain they are bypassed for
ambassadorial posts in favor political activists with dubious
qualifications.
   Among the nominees who have drawn the most complaints is Peter
Secchia, who helped President Bush carry Michigan last year and was
named ambassador to Italy. Many Italians were upset when he joked
that the new Italian Navy has glass-bottom boats ``so they can see
the old Italian Navy.''
   The New York Times complained in a July editorial that Bush's
nominee for Spain, Joseph Zappala, a Florida developer, has but one
claim to the Madrid assignment _ ``a distinctively large
contribution to the Republican Party, reportedly $126,000.''
   Senate confirmation of Zappala and two other nominees have been
delayed because of doubts about their credentials.
   The diplomats' union filed the suit to obtain release of
``Certificates of Competency'' that the law requires the president
to submit to the Senate on the qualifications of each nominee.
   The association said the State Department maintains the reports
are confidential and has refused to provide them to union officials.
   Since the information in the reports isn't ``classifiable,'' the
association said, they are being withheld ``only to avoid
embarrassment because they so clearly demonstrate the lack of
qualifications of many of the nominees.''
   Charles A. Schmitz, AFSA vice president, said that hiding
certificates from public view is self-defeating because they
routinely are made public after they reach the Senate, which must
confirm ambassadorial appointees for them to become effective.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, herself a
political appointee, cited the example of a 1970 nomination to
demonstrate the wisdom of some selections outside the Foreign
Service.
   She said that President Nixon chose a defeated candidate for the
Senate to be his ambassador at the United Nations, over the strong
objection of a ``major news publication.'' The appointee's name:
``George Herbert Walker Bush.''

<HEAD>With PM-Reagan Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of President Reagan's
health difficulties:
   _1967: While he was governor of California, Reagan had
approximately 30 seed-like stones removed from his urinary tract. He
had a transurethral prostatic resection, the same kind of operation
performed during his second presidential term in 1986.
   _1979: He complained of pain in the right thumb, which was
determined to be osteoarthritic.
   _March 30, 1981: A bullet fired at Reagan in an attempt on his
life hit him in the upper chest below the left arm, traveled
downward and was deflected into the left lung, coming to rest an
inch from his heart. He was rushed to George Washington University
Hospital, complaining of soreness in the rib cage. He collapsed in
the hospital corridor. The bullet was removed during three hours of
surgery and Reagan returned to the White House after 12 days in the
hospital.
   _April 1, 1982: Reagan underwent a routine urological examination
at Bethesda Naval Hospital after complaining of discomfort. Doctors
found no evidence of malignancy.
   _Sept. 7, 1983: Reagan, having grown noticeably hard of hearing,
was seen wearing a small hearing aid in his right ear when he
appeared before a group of business and education leaders. He has
attributed his hearing loss to the firing of a handgun too near his
ear on a movie set many years ago. Reagan later began wearing a
hearing aid in the left ear as well.
   _May 18, 1984: A small polyp was discovered in the president's
colon, but an examination showed the polyp was noncancerous and it
was not removed.
   _March 11, 1985: The White House disclosed that doctors examining
Reagan earlier that month found evidence of blood in his stool and a
growth in his lower intestine. A statement said tests of occult, or
hidden, blood in the feces were positive but that ``physicians
believe this may be from the polyp or from diet and will be
monitored.''
   _March 29, 1985: Reagan suffered a burst blood vessel in his left
eye, causing it to fill partially with blood and appear red. White
House spokesman Larry Speakes said no treatment was needed.
   _July 12, 1985: Doctors removed a small, benign polyp from
Reagan's colon and found another, larger one that was removed the
next day along with 2 feet of the president's intestinal tract. The
larger, 2-inch, polyp was found to be cancerous, but doctors said
the cancer had not spread beyond the tissues that were removed.
   _Aug. 1, 1985: The White House, responding to questions, said an
irritated patch of skin had been removed from Reagan's nose two days
earlier. A statement said the tissue ``was submitted for routine
studies for infection, and it was determined no further treatment is
necessary.'' Four days later, he told a news conference that the
``pimple'' had been skin cancer.
   _Jan. 17, 1986: Reagan had three small polyps removed from his
intestine during a six-hour visit to Bethesda in his first major
post-cancer colonoscopy checkup. They were described as ``very
small,'' measuring 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters in size.
   A shaving of facial tissue from a growth on the right side of
Reagan's face was also taken. Lab tests showed that the three polyps
and facial tissue were benign.
   _June 21, 1986: In a five-hour visit to Bethesda, Reagan had two
small polyps removed from his colon. The growths, ranging in size
from 1 millimeter to 1.5 millimeters, were benign.
   Reagan also had an eye examination and a dermatological
examination of his nose, from which he has had two small skin
cancers removed.
   _Jan. 4, 1987: Reagan had four benign polyps removed from his
colon by doctors at Bethesda, and the president's physician, Army
Col. John Hutton, said tests ``show no evidence of a recurrence of
the cancer found in July 1985.''
   _Jan. 5, 1987: Reagan underwent successful prostate surgery. The
surgery, which removed nearly an ounce of tissue, was to relieve
what a spokesman called ``mild, recurring discomfort'' apparently
due to an enlarged prostate, a gland surrounding the urethra at the
base of the bladder.
   _June 26, 1987: Reagan had two small polyps removed from his
colon during an examination in the physician's office in the White
House. They were found to be benign. Hutton said a routine prostate
exam was also performed as a follow-up to the president's January
surgery, and it ``was found to be entirely normal.''
   _Jan. 7, 1989: Reagan underwent surgery on his left ring finger
to correct a curvature known as Dupuytren's Contracture, a common
but deforming condition that caused his finger to fold inward.
   _July 4, 1989: Reagan, an accomplished rider, was thrown from a
horse while visiting a Mexican ranch near Cananea, about 30 miles
south of the Arizona border. He was flown by Army helicopter to a
U.S. military hospital in Arizona and kept about four hours,
declining a doctor's suggestion that he remain overnight for
observation.
   _Sept. 8, 1989: Reagan undergoes hour-long surgery at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., to drain fluid on his brain, a condition
doctors say probably resulted from the July 4 fall from the horse.

   When Bill Nalder found an envelope
containing $2,500 in cash in a bank parking lot, he picked it up
without a thought of contacting police or bank officials.
   Instead, Nalder, 70, of Scottsdale counted the money and set out
to find Shelly Clay, the Phoenix woman whose name and address was in
the envelope.
   ``I guess if it had been a huge wad of green stuff, I'd have
thought it was dope money and taken it to the police. But I just
thought it would be nice to see the person's face who lost it,''
said Nalder.
   In addition to the cash was a receipt for a $71,000 certificate
of deposit, he said.
   Mrs. Clay said she and her husband, Curtis, had concluded the
money was lost and would never be returned when Nalder arrived at
her home.
   She said she'd withdrawn the money from her CD account for a car
purchase and apparently dropped it as she was leaving the bank.
   ``My husband was mad. And I just kept hoping that whoever found
it was poor, really needed it and wasn't some rich person. That way
I could feel like at least I hadn't lost it all for nothing,'' she
said.
   She said she insisted on giving Nalder $200 for his honesty.

<HEAD>`High Priestess' of Sex Church Guilty of Prostitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The priestess of the Church of the Most High
Goddess, who wears a red sequin strapless dress and fishnet
stockings, insists sex with hundreds of men is her religious duty,
but a jury says it's prostitution.
   Known as Sabrina Aset to her flock, Mary Ellen Tracy says she
takes part in an ancient, misunderstood Egyptian religion in which
sexual rituals put men on the ``path back to the divine.''
   But a Superior Court jury wasn't convinced, deciding after 3{
days of deliberations Friday that Mrs. Tracy, 46, was no more than a
prostitute working out of a Beverly Hills home that was a thinly
disguised brothel.
   ``I am not a prostitute,'' Mrs. Tracy said after the verdict.
``I'm very hurt by that. I'm a very sincere and honest person. To be
portrayed as some kind of money-grubbing schemer is really
devastating.''
   Jurors convicted her of operating a house of ill fame and two
counts of prostitution. Her husband, Wilbur Tracy, 51, was also
convicted of operating a house of ill fame.
   They face a possible six-month jail sentence and $1,000 fine on
each count when sentenced Thursday by Municipal Court Judge Marion
Obera. The ``church'' had drawn more than 2,000 male followers and
was born of divine inspiration, Mrs. Tracy said.
   The couple have vowed to appeal the misdemeanor convictions,
contending their activities are protected by the First Amendment.
   ``We were found guilty of heresy,'' Wilbur Tracy said.
   The Tracys contend that they worship the oldest religion in the
world, dating back to 3200 B.C. They said aspects of the religion
are found on Egyptian scrolls.
   Once a Mormon, Mrs. Tracy said she was ordained as the high
priestess by her husband in 1984. Wilbur Tracy said he had been
ordained as a high priest that year by a priestess he did not
identify.
   At various times as many as 10 other women acted as priestesses,
all ordained by Wilbur Tracy. The ``church'' is a Spanish-style
rented house near Beverly Hills.
   The sparsely furnished home had no pews or pulpit. The few wall
hangings included posters of movie stars and a framed nude
photograph of Mrs. Tracy.
   The Tracys advertise in a risque newspaper called the Hollywood
Press, in exchange for a column Mrs. Tracy writes for the paper.
   Men who want to attend the church phone ahead for an interview
with Mrs. Tracy, who decides whether to accept them. She claims to
have turned down many men who were insincere about the spiritual
aspect of the rituals and ``asked for massages and all kinds of
weird things.''
   When the men arrive at the church, they take part in a series of
rituals that include sexual acts with the priestess that Mrs. Tracy
says spiritually cleanses the men.
   ``What he's doing is symbolically giving up ... his very all in
order to have his sins wiped out,'' Mrs. Tracy said.
   The men then leave a ``sacrifice,'' usually money, in a practice
that Mrs. Tracy acknowledged ``gave the police a few problems.''
   Mrs. Tracy said that before she became a high priestess she had
never had sex outside of marriage, but that she has continued to
practice her religion with the help of prayer.
   ``I've always been very willing to do what God required, whether
to be monogamous or to have sex with a few thousand men,'' she said.
``It really doesn't matter. I try to be accepting or open-minded.''

<TEXT>
   The mayor and officials at a private
school for minority children claim that a group of neighbors helped
shut down the school for racially motivated reasons.
   Neighbors who signed a petition challenging the school's zoning
included chef Julia Child and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe,
a Harvard Law School professor.
   ``They want peace and quiet at the expense of children and ethnic
people,'' said Mayor Alfred Vellucci, who also heads the school
committee, which had backed the private school. ``They don't want
anyone around while they smell the flowers.''
   Classes at the Commonwealth Day School were called off because
the petition led to a review of its zoning approval. School
officials could not guarantee the school would be open after next
week, when the state land court reviews its zoning status.
   Residents say they pressed for the repeal of zoning approval
because Commonwealth violates city zoning laws and causes traffic
congestion on a long, narrow street.
   Their attorney, Howard Medwed, denied racism was an issue.
   ``Some people are claiming racism is involved when there are far,
far different motives,'' Medwed said.
   He said the residents, some of whom own houses valued at more
than $1 million, were concerned for the peace and quiet of the
historic neighborhood.
   Commonwealth, which was founded in 1971, moved last September to
the building at Brattle Street that formerly housed the mostly white
New Preparatory School. Bert Giroux, of the city schools department,
said the high school was at the site for 50 years without major
complaints from residents.
   The petition said Commonwealth would come under different zoning
standards than the high school since it was for younger children.
   Commonwealth's headmaster, Robert Myette, said the zoning board
voted unanimously in October to grant permits to run the preschool
and elementary school.
   Jean Brooks, who lives next door to the school, solicited
signatures from more than 150 neighbors in the area and filed for an
appeal of the school's permits.
   Brooks said she doesn't believe the petition closed the school.
   ``They closed because they could not build up a large
constituency,'' she said.
   Several people affiliated with the school said the petition
played a major role in the closing.
   ``Through court orders, they choked the school economically,''
said Jack Gottlieb, whose 5-year-old daughter was one of seven white
students among the 50 students at the school. ``I think they didn't
like to see black little kids running around.''
   But some people said they were confused by the petition.
   Tribe said that when he was presented the petition he was told
the residents were trying to improve safety for the school children.
He said he was angered by the way the case turned out and that he
would investigate further.
   David Ives, president of WGBH, said he signed the Brooks petition
because of simple neighborly interest in zoning laws, and that he
knew nothing about the fate of the school in the matter.
   Julia Child was traveling to Massachusetts from California on
Friday and could not be reached for comment.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp says his agency is
developing a new code of ethics to prevent the type of scandals that
have plagued the Department of Housing and Urban Development in
recent months.
   ``My first order is to clean house, stem to stern,'' Kemp told a

   Federal and congressional investigators are looking at
allegations of fraud and mismanagement that may have cost the
government billions of dollars in HUD money.
   The actions occurred before Kemp took office earlier this year,
but much of his attention has been focused on cleaning up the
problem, he told the urban representatives.
   Kemp said his agency is putting the final touches on ``a program
of ethics'' that is intended to prevent future scandals. He did not

<NOTE>Report Says Mortgage Refinancing Rose This Summer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A trade group says homeowners took advantage of
lower mortgage rates to refinance their loans this summer.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America, which surveyed 30 of
the nation's largest mortgage bankers, said Friday that all but one
company reported an increase in refinancing.
   The median rise in refinancing was 25 percent from early June to
late August and companies reported overall mortgage business up a
median 29 percent, the group said.
   Fixed-rate mortgages, which hit a peak of 11.22 percent in March,
fell to below 9.82 percent in mid-July and have risen since,
averaging 10.17 percent this week, according to the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.

<NOTE>Metal Detectors to Apply to Staff, Too</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional staffers will have to line up
with lobbyists, tourists, reporters and other visitors waiting to
pass through metal detectors at Senate office buildings.
   Only senators and U.S. Capitol Police officers are exempt from
the new security procedures that take effect Tuesday, Capitol Police
spokesman Dan Nichols said Friday.
   The move is part of a two-year effort to improve security,
Nichols said, and the same procedures will be applied to the three
House office buildings.
   In June, syndicated columnist Jack Anderson engineered the

<HEAD>Regulators Put Five Big S&amp;Ls Up for Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are putting five more large
savings institutions up for sale, saying they hope to complete the
multibillion-dollar deals by the end of the month.
   The five, all with total assets of $9 billion, are in Texas,
Pennsylvania, Kansas, California and Florida.
   ``Due to the structure of the sales, we anticipate lengthy
negotiations with prospective investors should not be required,''
David C. Cooke, executive director of the Resolution Trust Corp.,
said Friday.
   The new agency, created last month to dispose of failed S&amp;Ls,
controls more than 270 thrift institutions. So far, it has closed 11
small S&amp;Ls, transferring their deposits to other institutions or
paying off customers directly.
   The RTC was originally planning to spend about $5 billion by the
end of this month on S&amp;L resolutions, but, with Friday's
announcement, is increasing the estimate to $8 billion, according to
agency spokesman Alan Whitney.
   The latest institutions offered are:
   _University Federal Savings Association, Houston, with $2.6
billion in assets and 362,890 deposit accounts.
   _Hill Financial Savings Association, Red Hill, Pa., with $2.6
billion in assets and 295,520 deposit accounts.
   _Peoples Heritage Savings, Salina, Kan., with assets of $1.8
billion and 101,268 deposit accounts.
   _Pacific Savings Bank, Costa Mesa, Calif., with assets of $1
billion and 46,898 deposit accounts.
   _Freedom Savings and Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., with $1
billion in assets and 148,102 deposit accounts.

<HEAD>Barco Asks Bush to Help Arrange Higher Coffee Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco is asking
President Bush for help in supporting higher coffee prices, the
White House says.
   Colombian coffee growers have been hard hit by recent price
declines, and some analysts worry that at least some might be
tempted to switch to coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine.
   Coca can produce far higher profits per acre than any other crop.
   U.S. support for higher coffee prices would represent a switch
from the U.S. position in international negotiations for a renewal
of key provisions of an international agreement on coffee marketing.
   ``President Barco did communicate on this issue,'' spokesman
Roman Popadiuk said Friday night. ``We are studying the issue
carefully.''
   He declined to give details about Barco's request.
   Colombian cocaine gangs, the source of 80 percent of the drug
consumed in the United States, and the government are engaged in a
bitter battle over the cocaine trade. Hundreds of judges,
journalists and other officials have been murdered by the drug
traffickers.
   As a result of a breakdown of negotiations in July, the 74-nation
International Coffee Organization suspended export quotas for member
nations for the third time in its 26-year history.
   The United States and some producing nations opposed quotas
during the negotiations.
   The July 1 price of about $1.20 per pound for unroasted beans,
the floor target price of the organization, fell to 80 cents by the
end of the month. It now stands at about 85 cents.

   U.S. Justice Department observers will monitor
Tuesday's mayoral primaries to protect minority voters' rights,
members of a coalition that had requested federal intervention said.
   The announcement Friday came on the heels of a new poll showing
Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins slightly ahead of Mayor
Edward I. Koch in the four-candidate Democratic primary.
   The announcement was made by state Assemblyman Jose Serrano of
the Bronx and the Center for Constitutional Rights, members of the
coalition of elected officials and residents.
   ``The basis for our request was the manner in which the New York
City Board of Elections conducted the April 19, 1988, presidential
primary,'' Randolph M. Scott-McLaughlin, a law professor at Pace
University in White Plains, said in a statement issued by the center.
   ``In that election, thousands of minority voters were
disenfranchised when they were improperly purged from the election
rolls, election machines broke down repeatedly and minority voters
were discouraged, deterred and in some instances coerced from
exercising their right to vote.
   ``Out of a fear that this conduct would once again occur, we
sought federal intervention,'' Scott-McLaughlin said.
   He said the center was told Friday by David Marblestone, an
attorney in the Justice Department's voting rights section, that
observers would be coming to New York.
   Marblestone referred calls from The Associated Press to Justice
Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade, who said it is the
government's policy not to comment on voting observers until the day
before they are sent.
   A federal observer with broad powers under the Voting Rights Act
will be stationed in the city and a team of observers and lawyers
will visit polling places, the center said.
   In the Daily News-Eyewitness News poll of 280 Democrats likely to
vote in the primary, Dinkins was ahead of Koch 47 percent to 43
percent. The other two Democratic candidates, Comptroller Harrison
J. Goldin and Richard Ravitch, got 4 percent and 2 percent
respectively. Four percent were undecided.
   Koch and Dinkins were considered statistically even because the
margin of error, 6 percentage points, was greater than the gap
between the two.
   Nine out of 10 blacks surveyed said they would vote for Dinkins,
who is black, a 20 percentage-point gain over a July poll.
   In the Republican primary, former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani
faces Ronald Lauder, a former U.S. ambassador to Austria. Giuliani
is also on the Liberal Party line and Lauder is also on the
Conservative Party ballot.
   The Daily News and Eyewitness News, WABC-TV's nightly news show,
plan to release their poll Sunday on the Republican contest.

<HEAD>Administration Considers Giving $3 Million to Ortega's Election Opponent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will ask for up to $3
million for the political campaign of an opponent of Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega, according to a report published today.
   The administration had been considering using the CIA to affect
the election in Nicaragua, but now is leaning toward using the
donation to the campaign of Violeta Chamorro because it wouldn't
draw as much fire from Congress, The Washington Post reported.
   The February election is seen by the Bush administration as an
opportunity to end the rule of Ortega's Marxist-led Sandinista
government.
   The money would be drawn from the National Endowment for
Democracy, an organization created by Congress in 1982 to support
democratic processes worldwide, the Post reported.
   Under Nicaraguan law, half the money donated to a political
candidate from outside the country must be handed over to the
Supreme Election Council. The Supreme Election Council is supposed
to use that money to help defray costs of the election.
   But that law means if the United States will have to donate a
total of $6 million to ensure that $3 million goes into the
Chamorro's campaign treasury, the Post reported, citing unnamed
sources.

   The chief surgeon in the operation to
remove old blood from the brain of former President Reagan is an
international leader in vascular surgery and editor of a medical
journal on neurology.
   Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt of the Mayo Clinic led the one-hour surgery
Friday in which he and two neurologists assisting him drained fluid
that had collected on the top of the right side of the former
president's brain. The buildup was the result of a July 4 injury in
which Reagan was thrown from a bucking horse, said Mark Weinberg,
Reagan's spokesman.
   Weinberg said doctors considered the surgery a success, and
Reagan was conscious and resting in his hospital bed Friday night.
Reagan's condition was described by Weinberg as ``excellent and
stable.''
   Sundt said in a telephone interview he was assisted by Mayo
neurologists Michael J. Ebersold and Richard W. Marsh. Three nurses
also assisted in the operation, which ended about 5:15 p.m., Sundt
said. Ebersold said Roy Cucchiara administered general anesthesia to
the former president.
   Sundt said he and the other doctors will not comment on the
operation or the recovery stages.
   Sundt is the editor of the Journal of Neurosurgery and an expert
on the blood delivery system, Ebersold said.
   ``He would be recognized as one of the international leaders in
neurology,'' Ebersold said. ``His awards in neurosurgery are almost
too numerous to mention.''
   Sundt received his undergraduate degree from the U.S. Military
Academy in 1952 and served in the Army from 1952 to 1955. He
received his doctorate from the University of Tennessee College of
Medicine at Memphis in 1960 and interned at John Gaston Charity
Hospital in Memphis.
   Sundt entered the Mayo Graduate School for research training in
cerebrovascular diseases for one year in January 1965 and is now
Mayo's chairman of the Department of Neurologic Surgery.
   In 1984, Sundt was one of 120 doctors named by 400 peers across
the country in a Good Housekeeping magazine survey as the nation's
best physicians.
   Ebersold grew up in Alma, Wis., and received his doctorate from
the University of Wisconsin. He said his expertise is in skull-base
abnormalities, including abnormalities of the spine.
   After a residency at Mayo, Ebersold said he entered private
practice in Eau Claire, Wis., before returning to the clinic 10
years ago. He said he has worked frequently as a team with Sundt and
Marsh.
   Cucchiara received his doctorate from Louisiana State University
School of Medicine in 1969 and interned at Charity Hospital in New
Orleans. He entered Mayo Graduate School as a resident in
anesthesiology in July 1970.

<HEAD>Couple Found Guilty of Murder in Son's Starvation Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A couple convicted of third-degree
murder for starving their 14-year-old son plan to appeal on the
ground their children's religious beliefs may take precedence over
parental responsibility.
   ``One of the major issues in this case, which we were not allowed
to argue in front of the jury, was the children's constitutional
rights to exercise their religious beliefs and whether that right
exceeds the parental duty,'' said Al Flora Jr., one of the couple's
lawyers.
   Eric Cottam died Jan. 3 after the family went without food for
six weeks despite nearly $4,000 saved as a tithe for God. Larry and
Leona Cottams' 12-year-old daughter, Laura, recovered from
malnourishment and is in foster care.
   In addition to third-degree murder, which required a jury finding
of malice on the part of Cottam, 39, and Mrs. Cottam, 38, the couple
were found guilty Friday of reckless endangerment and endangering
the welfare of children.
   The Cottams held hands and showed no emotion as the verdicts were
read. Jurors had deliberated 1} hours.
   The Cottams didn't eat for six weeks beginning Nov. 22 despite
$3,775 saved as a tithe, or offering, for God. Larry Cottam, a
former Seventh-day Adventist pastor, said he believed using the
money would have been akin to stealing.
   Laura Cottam testified she had several dollars saved as a tithe,
but also believed spending the money for food would have been the
same as stealing.
   Luzerne County Judge Gifford S. Cappelini decided not to allow
use of the children's First Amendment rights to religious freedom as
a defense because they still lived in their parents' care.
   ``I think their parental duty is paramount,'' Cappellini told The
Associated Press.
   Flora said he planned to appeal.
   ``The issue of whether the children could exercise their own
religious beliefs ... gets into some significant First Amendment
issues that have not been decided in this country,'' said Joseph
Cosgrove, co-counsel for the Cottams.
   Eleanor Culpepper, a juror, said seeing pictures of the teen-age
boy's body weighed heavily on the jury. Eric was 5 feet 9 inches
tall and weighed 69 pounds when he died Jan. 3.
   ``It's kind of hard to believe,'' the Philadelphia nurse said.
   Assistant District Attorney Thomas Marsilio said previous
convictions in starvation cases in Pennsylvania had never risen
above involuntary manslaughter.
   The Cottams remained free on $50,000 bail each. An anonymous
benefactor posted bail for them Aug. 23 after they spent 230 days in
custody following their Jan. 5 arraignment.
   No sentencing date has been set pending post-trial motions. The
Cottams face a maximum 28 years in prison.
   Eric Cottam died in an upstairs bedroom of the family's modest
two-story home in Nuangola, just south of this northeastern
Pennsylvania city.
   A day later, Larry Cottam notified police. Larry, Leona and Laura
Cottam required hospitalization for malnutrition.
   Flora said during the two-week trial that the reclusive family
went without food because they distrusted authorities and believed
God would rescue them. They also believed their children would be
taken away from them if they sought help, he said.
   ``It was a situation where you had a family that, in a sense,
lost touch with reality,'' Flora said.
   During the trial, Flora said the family became alienated from
society in 1984 after their children alleged they had been sexually
abused by adults, including their paternal grandparents _ who denied
the claims _ as well as a Seventh-day Advenist leader and church
officials at the Seventh-day Adventist school near their home.

<TEXT>
   Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, who became a
folk hero for standing up to the Kremlin, is to spend a week in the
United States and meet with members of Congress and businessmen,
Radio Moscow reported.
   The official radio station said he was to depart today and arrive
in New York in the afternoon.
   In its report, Radio Moscow said Yeltsin favors ``drastic
reforms'' and that according to polls he is second only to President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in popularity. Radio Moscow did not give
details of the polls.
   Yeltsin, 58, once was a close protege of Gorbachev as Moscow
party boss. But he was fired after an October 1987 speech in which
he criticized Politburo conservative Yegor K. Ligachev and said
reforms were giving the people little.
   Yeltsin rocketed back into the forefront with a landslide victory
in parliamentary elections in March, and was elected to the Supreme
Soviet legislature a few months later in a deft political comeback.
He now heads a parliamentary committee on construction.
   Radio Moscow said he plans to use his trip to the United States
to familiarize himself with the Congress and determine whether its
operations can be applied to the Supreme Soviet.
   Yeltsin has become a populist for demanding an end to the
privileges of the Soviet elite and heads an organized opposition
group in the parliament.

<TEXT>
   The memory of the explosion was still vivid,
but crewmen from the USS Iowa were tight-lipped after an official
report found a gunners mate intentionally sparked the April blast
that killed 47 on board.
   ``What is done is done. We just want to forget about it now. But
I will never forget the smell of a burning body,'' one sailor said
Friday near Gaeta, where the Iowa was anchored.
   Sailors interviewed in bars and diners near the U.S. Naval base
at Gaeta said they had not seen a copy of the report and refused to
fully identify themselves. The Associated Press requested access to
the Iowa but it was denied by the Navy.
   The report released by the Pentagon on Thursday said
``circumstantial evidence'' indicated gunners mate Clayton M.
Hartwig intentionally sparked the April 19 explosion in a turret for
16-inch guns.
   A sailor who identified himself only as being from Miami said he
worked in the turret six months before the explosion and had asked
to be transferred to another assignment.
   ``I am glad I transferred because I had been there. I had loaded
the same guns. I would have been in the middle of it. If I had my
way, I would be off the Iowa by now,'' he said.
   ``A lot of the guys who died were my friends.''
   One crewman expressed doubt that Hartwig was to blame.
   ``I find it hard to believe that one guy could be responsible for
all that,'' said the sailor, who would identify himself only as Bob.
He said he was from Michigan.

<TEXT>
   Two of Jim Bakker's former aides were
given long prison terms and heavy fines, penalties their attorney
blamed on the television evangelist.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter on Friday sentenced David
Taggart to 18 years, five months in prison and his brother James to
17 years, nine months. He also ordered each to pay $500,000 fines
and for the two of them to pay $525,000 in back taxes.
   ``They came and they learned everything they did from Jim
Bakker,'' said Ben Cotten, the Taggarts' attorney who said he hadn't
decided whether to appeal the sentences.
   He called the sentences ``unduly harsh.''
   David Taggart's prison sentence was the maximum he could have
received.
   Cotten also predicted that if Bakker is convicted in his fraud
and conspiracy trial, the PTL founder will receive a stiff sentence.
   ``He has to look forward to an even more severe sentence, not
only because of the number of counts he's charged with but because
of Judge Potter's assessment of responsibility for what went on out
there at PTL,'' Cotten said.
   Cotten said there was a possibility of a reduction in sentence in
exchange for the Taggarts' testimony against Bakker. David Taggart
has testified. James Taggart has not been called in the case.
   Potter announced the sentences after court recessed Friday in
Bakker's trial. Bakker and another aide are accused of using nearly
$4 million in ministry contributions to fund his lavish lifestyle.
   The Taggarts were convicted of evading taxes on $1.1 million they
received from the ministry _ money they used to pay for personal
luxuries, such as expensive trips, a Trump Tower apartment in New
York and Jaguar cars, according to testimony.
   ``Judge Potter sent a message that white-collar crimes aren't
going to go unpunished,'' said prosecutor David Brown. ``They lied
to the jury under oath and showed no remorse.''
   Bakker was not in the courtroom for the sentencing.
   Potter blasted the Taggarts, saying:
   ``I cannot understand the minds of these defendants. They seem to
feel like they had an unlimited check out there. They kept going to
it over the years.
   ``White-collar criminals seem to get away with extremely light
sentences. It's time we do something about that.''
   Neither Taggart said anything during the short hearing and
neither displayed emotion. David Taggart served as Bakker's personal
aide; James Taggart worked as PTL's interior decorator. The brothers
joined the ministry as piano players.
   In testimony at Bakker's trial Friday, a minister said he felt
``robbed and cheated'' after he bought a ``lifetime partnership''
from PTL for lodging in a hotel that was never built.
   The Rev. Alan Foor, pastor of the United Church of Christ in
Beavertown, Pa., testified he was a monthly contributor to PTL, but
became angry when he learned how well Bakker lived.
   For $1,000, people were guaranteed a certain number of nights per
year in a hotel at the ministry's Heritage USA retreat near Fort
Mill, S.C.
   Foor said he never used the lodging because the hotel he was a
partner in wasn't completed.
   In Richmond, Va., a federal appeals court Friday denied Bakker's
motion for a stay of his trial. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals also rejected Bakker's motion to dismiss the indictment
against him.

<TEXT>
   World-renowned pianist Van Cliburn was the featured
performer at Friday's opening of the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony
Center, but the $81.5 million complex stole the show.
   ``I think the hall has a presence and this is something that's
important no matter what little tuning will go on,'' Cliburn said
during an intermission Friday. ``It's very hard to put in a
presence, but I think the hall has a presence, and that's
important.''
   A capacity crowd of more than 2,000 packed the hall to hear
Cliburn, a Fort Worth pianist, and the Dallas Symphony Orchestra
perform Tchaikovsky's ``Piano Concerto No. 1.''
   Architect I.M. Pei designed the hall as a series of overlapping
geometric shapes. The rectangular structure sits at an angle inside
a square, surrounded by segments of circles. The Dallas Museum of
Art and the Dallas skyline are visible through $6 million worth of
glass panes that make a sweeping curve of the lobby.
   The hall includes a 4,463-pipe organ, Italian marble and
artificially weathered limestone.
   U.S. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said the hall
sends a message to the world that Dallas is determined to be a
leader in the arts.
   ``I think the real meaning of all of this is that Dallas and its
people have the capacity to build and succeed at a time that has not
been economically good to do so,'' he said.
   Conductor Eduardo Mata said the hall's opening was a historic
moment for the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the city.
   ``This shows what people can do if they work together and work
hard,'' Mata said after Friday's concert. ``I'm sure this hall will
set the standard for years to come.''
   Even though it has been trumpeted as a world-class music hall,
the center is not without critics.
   They contend Dallas city leaders have ``misplaced priorities,''
and should have poured much of the money spent on the hall into road
repair, education and expanded police and fire protection.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, declaring ``it's time to come
together,'' says he's willing to accept changes by Congress in his
anti-drug program to win broad bipartisan support.
   ``I understand nobody's going to do it exactly my way,'' Bush
said Friday, striking a conciliatory note after earlier lashing out
at critics.
   ``I would be very close-minded if I said you can't have this
change or another or we can't make this part of it better or
another. But this is no time for partisan carping.''
   Critics complain that Bush's $7.9 billion strategy is
under-funded and doesn't go far enough. The program emphasizes
tougher penalties for drug users and more money for jails and law
enforcement, as well as increased funds to attack drugs in countries
where they are produced.
   Bush made his comments in speeches in New Orleans before the U.S.
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the predominantly black National
Baptist Convention USA Inc.
   Bush said there can be differences on some issues, ``but not on
this one, not as our country tries to fight, come up with a national
strategy and then fight the narcotics that are ripping off and
killing the kids of this country, their very soul.''
   ``It's time to come together,'' he said.
   On his return to Washington Friday evening, Bush flew by
helicopter to the presidential retreat at Camp David for the weekend.
   En route to Washington, Bush tried to call former President
Reagan at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. However, Reagan
already was undergoing surgery to relieve an accumulation of fluid
on his brain, a condition doctors say probably resulted when Reagan
was thrown from a horse over the summer.
   ``We're all worried about it,'' Bush said as he awaited word on
the outcome of the surgery. ``I hope it's all right, pray it's all
right _ lovely guy, a lovely person.''
   A Reagan spokesman said after the hour-long surgery that the
operation had been successful and that the 78-year-old former
president was resting comfortably.
   Addressing the Baptists, Bush said the drug crisis and other
problems were related to another serious problem _ ``the decline of
the most basic institution of all, the decline of the American
family.''
   ``We must work together to save the American family,'' he said in
a crusade-like call to give children the love and support that will
prompt them to choose education over the ``easy'' money of crime.
   ``How can you teach respect for a hard-earned dollar when that
easy drug money flourishes out there on the streets?'' he asked as
the audience applauded. ``And how can you persuade young men and
women to have faith in themselves when their mother and dad have
lost all faith?''
   Bush flew to New Orleans a day after a Washington Post-ABC News
poll showed 75 percent of those surveyed approved of his handling of
the drug crisis and 82 percent approved of the proposals he

   Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters that September is the

<HEAD>Ex-North Korean Army General Says Kim Il Sung Started Korean War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former North Korean deputy army chief
of staff and ambassador to the Soviet Union said today that North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung started the Korean War by ordering an
invasion of South Korea.
   ``The Korean War was personally ordered by Kim Il Sung and I can
testify on details,'' said Lee Sang Jo, 74, who defected to the
Soviet Union in 1961.
   ``Considering the fact that Seoul fell to the North Korean army
only three days after the war began, it is beyond question who
started the Korean War,'' the former North Korean army general said.
   Lee, now a naturalized Soviet citizen, said he came to South
Korea on Tuesday to visit relatives in his hometown of Pusan on the
southern coast.
   After a courtesy call on Park Chul-un, a Cabinet minister without
porfolio, Lee said he planned to hold a news conference next week to
discuss the Korean War and his relations with Kim Il Sung.
   Lee, as a lieutenant general, was North Korea's deputy army chief
of staff when the war broke out on June 25, 1950.
   The North Korean army, backed by Soviet tanks, invaded and
overran most of South Korea in less than three months but was
repelled by allied U.N. forces led by U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
   After Chinese volunteer forces intervened on the side of North
Korea, the war became stalemated, forcing both sides to start talks
to halt the conflict.
   In the armistice talks with U.N. forces, Lee served as the deputy
North Korean delegate. He later replaced Gen. Nam Il as the chief
communist negotiator in the talks. The fighting ended July 27, 1953,
but the two countries are still technically at war.
   Lee defected to the Soviet Union after serving as North Korea's
ambassador to Moscow from 1957 to 1960. He said his defection was to
avoid Kim Il Sung's mass purge of political enemies.
   Lee's trip to Seoul reflects warming relations between South
Korea and the Soviet Union. The countries have no diplomatic
relations but have expanded non-political contacts significantly in
recent years. They exchanged trade offices early this year.

<HEAD>Shrimpers Cool Off; Bush to Review Regulations</HEAD>

   Angry shrimpers who blockaded a waterway
cooled off after hearing that President Bush agreed to review
regulations requiring them to use turtle excluder devices in their
nets.
   ``We gave them 10 days, 10 days we told those guys. We have to
hear something before then. We want to hear that instead of hurting
the people and spending tax money that they're going to start a
hatchery for those turtle eggs and raise them. That's what they need
to do, not hurt us,'' said shrimper Emery Eymard.
   The Coast Guard said 37 vessels took part in the day-long
blockade on Friday in south Louisiana, but protesting shrimpers
estimated between 50 and 100 big, double-rigged boats barricaded the
industrial pass.
   The blockade ended at 5 p.m. after the Coast Guard relayed word
from U.S. Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La., that Bush had agreed to review
the regulations. Bush met with Tauzin, U.S. Reps. Lindy Boggs,
D-La., and Bob Livingston, R-La., during his visit to New Orleans
Friday.
   ``We received the president's commitment to look into the
Commerce Department decision on Monday,'' Tauzin said. He said that
John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, will meet with Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   No arrests were made Friday and no violence was reported, said
Coast Guard Cmdr. William Loeftstedt. Authorities, however, did take
down names and boat registrations of the protesting shrimpers.
   About 500 demonstrating shrimpers from Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama and Florida carried picket signs along Bush's motorcade
route in New Orleans.
   The blockade on the water formed at Belle Pass near Grand Isle
Friday morning, a few hours after the regulations requiring the use
of the TEDs took effect, the Coast Guard said. Some of the vessels
flew the skull and crossbones; others flew American flags upside
down, a distress signal.
   More than 30 boats were unable to get through the pass, which is
used mostly by shrimpers and oil company boats, Coast Guard Cmdr.
Dave Smith said.
   Another 30 to 40 shrimpers blocked the Intracoastal Waterway near
Intracoastal City, La., said Chief Petty Officer Glenn LaMont. No
arrests were made at the remote location near the center of
Louisiana's coastline, he said.
   An estimated 11,000 sea turtles die each year in Gulf Coast
shrimp nets, including the endangered Kemp's ridley, leatherneck and
hawksbill and the threatened loggerhead and green sea turtles.
   The cagelike TEDs fit in the back section of a shrimp trawl. A
grid across the middle allows shrimp to flow through but catches
turtles. Waterflow through the device helps turtles escape via a
trap door.
   Shrimpers say they lose 10 percent to 30 percent of their shrimp
through the TEDs. Commerce officials say side-by-side tests have
shown losses of 2 percent to 5 percent.
   Mosbacher had tried allowing shrimpers to limit their trawling
times to 105 minutes, with the idea that most turtles wouldn't drown
in that time. But the method was found to be ineffective.
   Failure to use TEDs could result in a maximum $20,000 fine, but
the Commerce Department will phase in its enforcement.

   President Daniel arap Moi has ordered
health officials to identify and isolate AIDS patients to try to
prevent the spread of the deadly virus, according to newspaper
reports today.
   Moi claimed some AIDS patients had ``vowed not to die alone but
to take along with them to the grave scores of others.'' He cited a
case in which he said one victim deliberately infected 100 other
people, according to reports in Kenya's three daily English-language
newspapers.
   The president asked the minister of health, Mwai Kibaki, to
determine how many of the 6,000 known sufferers of AIDS in this East
African nation were Kenyans and how many were foreigners, and to
isolate them, the newspapers said.
   Moi did not elaborate further. He made the comments Friday at a
fund-raising meeting in Karatina, 90 miles north of Nairobi.
   There is no known cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
which destroys the body's immune system and with that its ability to

   Haggling over percentage points representing
thousands of dollars in commissions for laundering drug money was
common in the world of the the Medellin cocaine cartel's financial
director, court documents indicate.
   An affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta by Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Albert D. Latson chronicles part of
the government's 2{-year undercover investigation of the cartel. It
portrays Eduardo Martinez Romero as having a role in laundering tens
of millions of dollars through U.S. and Panamanian banks.
   Martinez, 36, remained in custody Friday under tight security on
federal money-laundering and fraud charges after his extradition
from Colombia. He was flown to Atlanta early Thursday and faces a
Monday court hearing.
   Martinez, who told a federal judge in a preliminary hearing
Thursday that he has a graduate degree in marketing, bargained with
undercover DEA agents during a secretly videotaped meeting in March
1988 on the Caribbean island of Aruba, according to the Latson's
affidavit.
   The undercover operation, based in Atlanta, used DEA agents to
act as Americans interested in laundering cocaine profits from
Colombia.
   A typical transaction worked this way, according to the court
documents: money would be delivered to a ``financial broker'' in the
United States, who then took it to one of several companies, some
legitimate and some false.
   The company would deposit the cash under its name and then send
the now ``clean'' money by wire transfer to a second bank account
controlled by Banco de Occidente in Panama.
   Typically, those banks were in New York and Los Angeles, but
Martinez told the agents that Banco de Occidente wanted to open an
account in an Atlanta bank in hopes of the money being delivered
faster.
   Banco de Occidente would have the funds transferred to Panama to
accounts controlled by Martinez, according to the affidavit.
   Delays in getting the money moving cost the cartel in lost
interest and made it more likely that U.S. authorities would have an
opportunity to seize the funds.
   As the agents attempted to get Martinez' business, he compared
them to a Uruguayan group known as La Mina, a precious metals
exporter but also known to federal prosecutors as another drug money
launderer, Latson said in the document.
   La Mina, Martinez told the agents, charged 7 percent per
transaction, but the undercover agents' organization would cost him
8 percent _ and he wanted a discount. Martinez also was taped saying
La Mina could launder huge amounts of money in only 48 hours.
   Go-betweens and couriers working for the launderers could make
thousands of dollars per transaction _ $44,710 for a $1.035 million
deal in December 1987; $109,514 for $1.5 million in January 1988,
for example.
   At an earlier meeting in Panama, Martinez told the agents that if
something goes wrong with the process, an unidentified ``they''
would kidnap and interrogate those involved and retaliate ``if the
answers were not satisfactory,'' Latson said in his affidavit.
   Eventually, the affidavit said, the agents reached an agreement
with Martinez to launder some of the Medellin cartel's money,
including a series of transactions in February and March of this
year involving some $6.2 million.
   The La Mina group was indicted earlier this year in Los Angeles
on money-laundering charges stemming from the same investigation
that snared Martinez, Operation Polar Cap.

   Willie B. has shown there is hope for even the
most sheltered bachelors of the world.
   Zoo Atlanta's famous lowland gorilla _ who spent almost three
decades alone in a cage _ mated Friday with a 6-year-old female in
front of his stunned trainer and visiting children who hadn't
expected to see such monkey business.
   ``What better way to have an introduction to life,'' said Amy
Gross, a zoo visitor.
   Zoo officials thought it would be at least another year before
the 31-year-old gorilla, well, did what comes naturally.
   ``We're just excited he has shown us he knows what to do,'' said
Dr. Terry Maple, the zoo's director. ``He's not as bad off as we
thought.''
   Kinyanni, Willie's newly matured partner, and the longtime
bachelor had been ``wrestling and chasing each other'' since they
were placed together about two months ago, said Charles Horton,
Willie's longtime trainer.
   But Friday, Horton walked by and Willie ``had his arm up on her
shoulder; she had a hand on him, and they were touching each
other,'' he said.
   Horton said Willie followed Kinyanni around but grabbed her when
she decided to walk away. Kinyanni stepped toward Willie, Horton
said, and Willie answered the call of the wild.
   Zoo officials said the tryst lasted about two hours.
   ``It was totally unbelievable to see this,' Horton said. ``It was
astonishing to see. ... I hope he keeps on doing this.''
   Willie has progressed quickly since May 1988, when he stepped
outdoors for the first time since he was captured in the wild at
about age 3.
   Researchers say they will wait about a month to see whether
Willie and Kinyanni produce offspring. Willie's sperm count has been
deemed a little low.
   Later Friday, the lovers had another romantic encounter.
   Some zoo visitors were surprised. Others were embarrassed, but
not Jerry Hymanson of Atlanta, who seemed proud of Willie's progress.
   ``At 31 years old, don't you think it's about time?'' he said.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Assailants shot into President
Noor Hassanali's limousine, but the president was not inside and his
wife narrowly escaped the attack unharmed, police said.
   Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson refused to speculate on a motive
for the attack but told Parliament Friday that ``all measures to
catch the perpetrators have been put in place, and I urge the public
to remain calm.''
   The attack occurred Thursday night when Hassanali's wife,
Zaylahar, 65, was returning home in the limousine. Police
Superintendent Sorzano Araetes said three men attacked 200 yards
from the couple's home on the outskirts of Port-of-Spain.
   ``A white Mazda vehicle pulled up alongside and shots were fired
into the presidential car, barely missing the president's wife,''
and other bullets hit the side of the limousine, Araetes said.
   The chauffeur also escaped injury, he said.
   Araetes said police found the attack car Friday, with AK-47 shell
casings inside.
   Hassanali, 68, a retired Supreme Court judge, became president in
1987 and has avoided controversy. The post of is ceremonial.
   Trinidad and Tobago, a two-island state of 1.2 million people in
the southern Caribbean off South America, gained independence from
Britain in 1962.

Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's lawmakers are sidestepping crucial
decisions on when life begins and when it should end despite medical
advances on both issues, a judge told a conference of doctors,
judges and ethicists.
   ``The other branches of government by and large refuse to accept
their responsibility,'' Washington, D.C., Superior Court Judge
Gladys Kessler said Friday. ``These issues do not have a consensus
in society.''
   She said apparently lawmakers believe that ``the waters are too
turbulent'' to take strong stands on the life-and-death issues.
   Kessler told the National Judicial College Bioethics Conference
that most laws nationwide say the state ``has an absolute right to
preserve life.'' But few laws have been passed that take into
account fine legal distinctions that have developed as people live
longer and survive illnesses that would have killed them just a
decade ago.
   ``How can we avoid the harder and most emotion-laden issue of the
quality of life?'' she asked some 150 conferees from across the
country.
   Chief justices nationwide were invited to send two judges to the
conference at the nation's premiere school for judges on the
University of Nevada, Reno campus.
   Twenty national organizations, including the American Medical
Association and the National Bar Association, also were asked to
send two delegates each to the meeting.
   ``We wanted to hold the conference because these issues must be
discussed to come up with some answers that judges can take back to
their states,'' said Thomas Russell, associate dean of the college.
``The courtroom usually is the place of last resort for these
medical-ethical issues to be resolved.''
   Ms. Kessler was joined Friday by Ruth Purtilo,
ethicist-in-residence at Massachusetts General Hospital, in
explaining to conferees the latest bioethical dilemmas.
   ``Everybody's thinking about ethics these days ... it's almost a
national pastime,'' Ms. Purtilo said. ``We have a complete society
that's worrying.
   ``We all are in a new neighborhood of thought, of deliberations.
People are living longer and surviving longer because of medical
technology. ... It's the stuff of science fiction, but it's here.''
   Ms. Purtilo told doctors and judges they must not only consider
medical facts surrounding the case, but also review what's best for
patients, families and, in some cases, the unborn.
   In doing that, Ms. Purtilo warned that often there would be more
than one wrong and one right answer to a dilemma and judges and
doctors would be forced to make such life-and-death decisions
``under terrible pressures of time.''
   ``We as a society have to understand that the patient's voice
must be heard,'' she said.

   An American missionary was deported after
Kenya's chief immigration official told him he should have left last
year when his organization was banned, the missionary's daughter
said today.
   Richard Hamilton of Medford, Ore., boarded a Kenya Airways flight
to London Friday night after spending about 24 hours in the custody
of Kenyan officials, said his daughter, Carolee Laroi.
   ``We were told by the (U.S.) Embassy that he was sent out last
night,'' Mrs. Laroi said. ``We never heard from him.''
   An embassy official was prevented from seeing Hamilton at Kenya's
immigration department but caught up with him at the airport, she
said.
   ``They contacted us to tell him he was OK,'' she said.
   Hamilton, 51, was director of the East African Christian Mission
in Kenya.
   Kenya's chief immigration official, Frank Kwinga, on Friday said
Hamilton and his wife, Jane, should have left Kenya in July 1988
when their mission, which has been in Kenya 15 years, was banned.
   Mrs. Laroi said her mother was prepared to leave the country but
had not been officially contacted as of today.
   ``She's going to wait until they tell her to go,'' she said by
telephone from the Hamiltons' home in Kitale, about 215 miles
northwest of Nairobi, the capital.
   On Friday, Mrs. Hamilton said she believed her husband was being
used as a ``scapegoat'' in a local scandal.
   Hamilton was deported one day after being extensively questioned
about a meeting he had a week earlier with a controversial bishop of
the Anglican Church of the Province of Kenya.
   Mrs. Hamilton said the Kenyans apparently believed her husband
passed information to the bishop, Alexander Muge. Muge on Tuesday
claimed that a senior Kenyan civil servant skimmed 462,000 pounds of
maize from relief food destined for famine-stricken parts of
southern Sudan.
   Mrs. Hamilton and the bishop, contacted by telephone, denied
Hamilton had passed any such information to Muge during their
meeting.
   Mrs. Hamilton and Muge said the meeting concerned Hamilton's
interest in whether Muge's church would act as an umbrella
organization under which Hamilton's mission could be re-registered
with the government.
   The mission was ordered to close after a local official
complained to Nairobi authorities that he believed the Hamiltons
were allied with his political enemies, Mrs. Hamilton said.
   She said that although their work permits were consequently
invalidated, the couple appealed and received verbal assurances from
the attorney general and local officials that they could continue
their development work in the arid West Pokot region until the
appeal was decided.
   In November 1987, the Hamiltons were threatened with deportation
after the Kenyans accused them of involvement in an alleged Ku Klux
Klan-backed plot to overthrow the government of President Daniel
arap Moi. The alleged plot was later found to be a baseless threat
from a disgruntled Kenyan-born priest living in the United States.
   A year earlier, the Kenyans detained two Americans working at the
Hamiltons' mission and accused them of illegally trying to import
guns and radio transmitters. One of the detained missionaries, Lyle
Hutson, 63, also of Medford, had a heart attack and died while in
police custody.
   The mission said the suspect shipment included air rifles and air
pistols but no real weapons.

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate Against Pardon for Military Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 30,000 people marched
through downtown Buenos Aires to protest possible presidential
pardons for military officers accused of torture and killings in the
1970s.
   The march Friday was the first large demonstration during the
2-month-old administration of President Carlos Menem, who is
considering pardons for officers accused of human rights violations
in the military's ``dirty war'' against leftists.
   The marchers trailed behind a huge banner reading, ``No Impunity
_ Trial and Punishment for the Guilty!'' Police said about 30,000
people participated.
   Menem called the march ``political'' and told reporters he
planned to resolve the ``military problem'' by the end of the year.
He provided no details.
   Speaking to reporters at Government House, Menem said Argentines
should ``begin working in the present for the future'' and ``set
aside the past, without forgetting it.''
   The demonstration was organized by human rights groups and some
leftist political parties, including a faction of Menem's
labor-based Peronist Party.
   ``The pardon Menem is promising the murderers is a way of showing
that justice does not exist in this country,'' said Hebe Bonafini,
president of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group of mothers
and relatives of people who disappeared during the anti-subversion
campaign and are presumed dead.
   Menem has said action is needed to end military-civilian tensions
growing out of the brutal campaign against suspected left-wing
subversives by military governments that ruled from 1976 until 1983.
   A government commission named by Menem's predecessor, former
President Raul Alfonsin, determined that at least 8,900 people
disappeared during that time.
   ``It is going to be very difficult for us to fulfill the
fundamental objective of growth and development with social justice
if we maintain permanently open wounds in the heart of our
community,'' Menem said Friday.
   Two separate military groups are involved in reports of possible
pardons.
   One includes about 30 middle-ranking army officers, headed by
Col. Mohamed Seineldin and Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who face disciplinary
action for taking part in army uprisings in April 1987 and January
and December.
   The revolts, quelled with little bloodshed, were aimed at ending
the civilian-court trials of officers accused of human rights abuses
in earlier cases.
   In the second group are 17 army generals and two navy admirals
who face trial on charges that include murder, torture and
kidnapping.
   The Buenos Aires newspaper La Nacion quoted Menem on Friday as
saying he would order a pardon for the rebels when he returns from a
trip later this month to the United States.
   Officials have indicated that before the end of the year Menem
also would pardon the generals and admirals awaiting trial but not
not for six former members of the military junta and high-ranking
officers already convicted and sentenced.

   A weakened Hurricane Gabrielle is pushing north
today in the open Atlantic Ocean toward Canada's Maritime provinces
after brushing by Bermuda and skirting the U.S. coast.
   Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said late Friday
they expect Gabrielle to shift to the northeast over the weekend and
move away from the Canadian coast.
   ``The slowing down means (Gabrielle) is probably going to change
direction,'' said meteorologist Jim Gross. ``We're not forecasting
landfall.''
   But Gross said there is still a 10 to 15 percent chance Gabrielle
could move toward Nova Scotia or Newfoundland by late Monday.
   Meanwhile, Gabrielle was expected to gradually lose forward speed
and strength, he said.
   ``The swells are going to affect the eastern U.S. coast and the
Maritime provinces of Canada for some time,'' Gross said, ``at least
the next two days.''
   Swells up to 20 feet lashed at the eastern tip of Bermuda Friday,
where one house was damaged the day before. Marine traffic around
the island was halted as the storm produced 10-foot swells even in
harbors.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, the center of Gabrielle was located near
38.4 north latitude and 60.0 west longitude, or about 400 miles
south of Sable Island, Nova Scotia.
   Gabrielle had 90 mph winds and was moving north at 10 mph. The
hurricane which earlier peaked at 135 mph was expected to keep
hurricane-strength winds of at least 74 mph through the weekend,
Gross said.
   Meanwhile, Felix, which has rumbled around the Atlantic as both a
storm and a weak hurricane, was headed on a northeastern course,
away from land, late Friday.
   The storm lost its tropical characteristics and would not merge
with Gabrielle, as both systems' earlier courses indicated, Gross
said.
   There have been five hurricanes in this Atlantic hurricane
season, which began June 1 and runs to Nov. 30.

   A mezzanine platform collapsed on workers in
a fruit packing warehouse, killing one woman and injuring seven
others, authorities said.
   Sharon Raschke of Yakima died after a portion of the balcony fell
on her as she was sorting fruit at a Hansen Fruit Co. warehouse
Friday afternoon, police said.
   Four other plant workers also were trapped beneath the debris
until freed by fire rescue crews in less than an hour, said fire Lt.
Al Chronister. Rescuers used inflatable bags and materials from an
adjacent lumber yard to lift the debris off the women, he said.
   Chronister said the survivors were lucky. ``There was some pretty
heavy stuff coming down,'' he said. He estimated the platform, which
was built into a wall, weighed several tons.
   There were 60 workers inside the concrete warehouse when the
accident occurred, said Barb Dunn of the state Department of Labor
and Industries in Olympia. State and local officials are
investigating.
   Two women were in serious condition at St. Elizabeth's Medical
Center, said hospital spokeswoman Kathy O'Meara-Wyman. They were
identified as Carolyn Storms, 47, and Barbara Gray, 62, both of
Yakima.
   Of the other injured workers, most were treated and released but
one woman, who is pregnant, was hospitalized for observation.
   Ms. Dunn said it was the first fatality in the state's
fruit-packing industry since the early 1970s, when such
record-keeping began. Hansen Fruit was inspected by the state last
June and no violations were found, she said.
   Hansen officials ordered reporters out of the building and
refused to answer questions.

<HEAD>Parliament Grills Cabinet Nominees</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with committee meetings resuming, quotes

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers today interviewed more Cabinet
nominees for a Solidarity-led government that would end four decades
of Communist control of foreign affairs, the news media and the
economy.
   Some nominees were questioned in Parliament about issues that had
long been virtually unmentionable, such as Soviet-Polish relations.
   Eight committees of the Sejm, or lower house of parliament, held
their first day of hearings Friday and gave a positive
recommendation to all but two of the nominees they questioned.
   Further sessions were planned through the weekend to get ready
for a vote Tuesday on the government proposed by Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Committee votes do not oblige Mazowiecki to
withdraw candidates.
   The candidates include 13 Solidarity members and four from the
Communist Party. The two independent political parties that helped
put Solidarity in power last month _ the United Peasant Party and
the Democratic Party _ have four and three nominees respectively.
   Gen. Florian Siwicki, the Communist nominated to remain as
defense minister, told one committee: ``The army is a pro-reform
institution.''
   Solidarity's Leszek Balcerowicz, nominated as vice premier and
minister of finance, outlined a program to rescue Poland's
hard-pressed economy that includes restructuring the tax system to
lower levies on profits while setting up a progressive personal
income tax and a sales tax.
   The program also includes controls on wage inflation,
liberalizing foreign trade rules, protecting the drain of goods and
capital from Poland, and unifying the official and ``commercial''
currency exchange rates, he said.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa kept his distance from the
enactment of the historic changes his movement initiated.
   Interviewed late Friday upon returning from four days of meetings
in West Germany, he denied there was a danger of a two-front
government _ run by Mazowiecki in Warsaw and Walesa from his Gdansk
home.
   ``No, I am out,'' he told the government news agency PAP. ``I am
interested only in pluralism, freedom, democracy. And when
everything works, I am really going on vacation. I will not enter
the government.''
   The foreign minister nominee told lawmakers that Poles forced to
remain in the Soviet Union after World War II should be allowed to
return, PAP said.
   Krzysztof Skubiszewski, a little-known independent, also said
Poland's foreign policy must not be formulated any one political
party, the news agency said. He made the remarks to the legislative
committee responsible for contacts with Poles living abroad, which
along with the Foreign Affairs Committee voted in favor of his
nomination, PAP said.
   Thousands of Poles in the Soviet Ukraine and the Baltics,
particularly Lithuania, live in what was Polish territory until the
Soviets annexed it after the war. Some have demanded to be allowed
to travel more freely back to Poland. There was no immediate comment
by Soviet officials.
   PAP said Mazowiecki, elected Aug. 24 prime minister, nominated 19
people for posts Thursday and four Friday. He plans to present a
final list of nominees on Tuesday, when he outlines his government's
program in a speech.
   It appeared Solidarity would control 13 posts, including prime
minister, in the 24-member Council of Ministers, or Cabinet. The
Communists, who until this year had controlled the government since
1948, would have the ministries of interior, defense, transportation
and foreign trade.
   Government and legislative sources said more posts could be added.
   Late Friday, the parliamentary commission for food and
agriculture voted against the nominations of Czeslaw Janicki of the
Peasant Party and Artur Balazs of Solidarity, television news said.
   Janicki, an agriculture professor, was nominated for the combined
post of deputy prime minister and agriculture, and Balazs as
minister without portfolio for rural and civic issues. The TV report
said voting was secret and gave no reasons for the rejections.
   The new government will face an economy ravaged by inflation, a
chronic shortage of basic goods, low productivity and a foreign debt
of $39 billion.

   Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun
whose devotion to the destitute and dying earned her a Nobel Peace
Prize, remained in intensive care today recovering from a heart
attack, a co-worker said.
   ``There has been no change in her condition since yesterday
(Friday),'' said a nun at the Missionaries of Charity, the order
founded by Mother Teresa to care for the poor in this eastern Indian
city. She requested anonymity.
   Mother Teresa's doctors refused to answer questions about her
health, and hospital officials said a statement would be issued
later in the day.
   The frail 79-year-old nun suffered a heart attack Friday, three
days after she was admitted to Woodlands Hospital with a high fever
and irregular heartbeat. Doctors said her condition had stablized
and she was improving.
   She became ill on Sunday night but insisted on attending Mass on
Monday. Her condition continued to deteriorate, and on Tuesday she
hospitalized.
   The soft-spoken nun, who was born in Yugoslavia, has become known
for her work with the poor. She received dozens of honors, including
the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize and the U.S. Presidential Medal of
Freedom, which she received in 1985 from then-President Reagan.
   Despite heart problems and failing eyesight, Mother Teresa
continued to travel widely in recent years and spoke out vigorously
against abortion.
   She founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950 in an
abandoned, run-down hostel donated by the city. The order,
recognized by the Vatican in 1965, now has 3,000 nuns working in 87
countries.

<TEXT>
   A group of gendarmes on a nighttime
joyride with three female companions today crashed their police
helicopter into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all six people aboard,
said an officer for the force.
   The Ecureuil helicopter and its crew had been posted on temporary
duty at the small seaside town of Mimizan-Plage for the summer
vacation season. Its mission was beach surveillance and medical
evacuation.
   However, an officer at regional gendarme headquarters in Bordeaux
told French radio that the helicopter's pilot had taken the aircraft
for a joyride with a flight engineer, a doctor in the gendarmes, and
three women.
   ``It was not an official mission,'' said the unidentified officer.
   The craft, which was not equipped for night flight, crashed into
the ocean 50 miles southwest of Bordeaux, killing all six aboard,
officials said.
   A witness alerted police about 2 a.m. that he saw a helicopter
crash into the sea. A search was launched, and the wreckage of the
aircraft was found 500 yards offshore, officials said.
   The gendarmes are part of the French police force but serve under
the Defense Ministry. Many of them have recently complained in a
rash of letters published in French newspapers about the poor pay
and difficult conditions they endure in the quasi-military unit.

<HEAD>70 East Germans Flee Over Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 70 East Germans, five Romanians and
a Bulgarian fled from Hungary to Austria overnight, seeking freedom
and a new life in the West, a Red Cross official said today.
   The number of East Germans making the risky overnight dash across
the border was down from the 100 or so who arrived early Friday.
   Red Cross officials attributed the drop to new hopes that more
than 6,000 East Germans now waiting in Hungary to go to West Germany
will be allowed to leave en masse in the next few days.
   Officials in Budapest said Friday they expect the thousands of
East German refugees to leave for the West within days from tent
camps, summer cabins and other makeshift lodgings where many have
spent weeks.
   Hungary has been caught between the two Germanys, anxious to
prove to Bonn that it is committed to human rights but worried about
angering the orthodox leadership in East Berlin. Negotiations were
under way to resolve the issue.
   Another 6,000 East Germans have fled to Austria from Hungary this
summer since Budapest began removing barbed wire and other barriers
from its border with Austria in May. All but one have gone on to
West Germany, where they receive automatic citizenship and help in
starting a new life.
   Few East Germans are allowed to visit the West, but trips to
neighboring Hungary have been easy to arrange.
   The Hungarian border increasingly is serving as a way West for
other Soviet bloc citizens who seek asylum in Austria, Red Cross
officials say.
   Most nights this week, Romanian citizens have been among those
arriving in Austria, which has a policy of caring for them while
they apply to become political refugees or seek emigration to
another Western nation.
   Today's new arrivals included five Romanians and one Bulgarian,
Red Cross officials said. Earlier this week, a Soviet citizen was
among those crossing from Hungary.

   A natural gas explosion ripped through an apartment
complex, injuring at least 13 people, two critically, said fire
authorities who continued to search for more victims today.
   A leak or break in a gas line at the Robin Village Apartments
occurred Friday evening after maintenance workers attempted repairs
there, said a Dallas fire department spokesman.
   Fire Capt. Don Howard said 13 people were injured, including
several who had to be rescued from the debris. Rescuers were
checking the debris today to see if there was anyone still trapped.
   Four apartments were heavily damaged in the explosion, but there
was no fire damage because ``the explosion had such force that it
blew the fire out,'' Howard said.
   Apartment residents said they had smelled gas shortly before the
blast.
   Clifton Cleveland, a 44-year-old maintenance worker at the
complex, and Edward Robertson, 39, were in critical condition today
at Parkland Memorial Hospital with severe burns, said hospital
spokeswoman Becky Posell.
   Two children, ages 5 and 8, were hospitalized in fair condition,
two children and three adults were treated and released, and the
condition of the four other injured persons was not immediately
available.
   Howard said the exact cause of the blast had not been officially
determined but maintenance workers probably triggered it while
trying to repair the leak.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of refugees from Christian-Syrian
fighting marched through the streets of Sidon today during
torrential rains to appeal for an end to the battles and a chance to
go home.
   ``Have mercy on us! We want to return to our city,'' they
shouted, their voices mingling with thunder claps.
   Three people were killed and 12 wounded in today's exchanges over
Beirut's Christian and Moslem neighborhoods, police said. Rockets,
artillery rounds and tank fire rained onto residential neighborhoods
near the battlefront.
   Making matters worse for refugees, heavy rain flooded fields and
river banks where thousands have been camping outside Beirut to
escape the battlezone. In Sidon, about 25 miles south of the
capital, 200 refugees took part in the unscheduled protest.
   A prominent city politician tried to calm the demonstrators.
Oussama Saad, a Sunni Moslem, told them they would be given shelter
at government schools.
   However, a protest organizer yelled back: ``We don't want
charity! We don't want shelter! We want our Beirut back!''
   The Christians and Syrians allied with local militia fighters
began their duels in March after the Christian leader, Gen. Michel
Aoun, blockaded militia ports in an effort to recover lost levies.
Aoun leads a Christian Cabinet challenging a Moslem-led government.
   About 40,000 Syrian troops moved into Lebanon under terms of a
1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Aoun says they lost their
credibility as peacekeepers by siding with Moslem and leftist
factions, and he has vowed to drive them out of the country.
   The warring forces also fought today on a mountain ridge east of
the capital and a coastal highway to the north. No casualties were
reported from the fighting in those areas.
   Today's victims from the Beirut bloodshed raised the overall toll
to 833 killed and 2,474 wounded since the outbreak of fighting on
March 8.
   Most of Beirut's 1.5 million people have fled to safer areas or
left the country altogether in recent weeks as the fighting
escalated into some of the most destructive battles of the
14-year-old civil war.
   Only 150,000 people have remained in Beirut, police estimate.
They are generally trapped in underground shelters most of the time
and suffer from acute shortages of supplies.
   Thousands of Beirut refugees have been camping on the banks of
the Awali River, the northern entrance to Sidon. The overnight
downpour knocked down many of their tents and makeshift wooden
shacks. Rain is unusual for this time of year in Lebanon, where
winter starts in late October.

   Most of the 55 people who died when a
charter plane crashed in the North Sea were lottery winners taking a
free trip to West Germany, the company that sponsored the contest
said.
   Forty ships and a helicopter today searched the waters off
Denmark's west coast for bodies from Friday's crash, Denmark's
public radio said.
   The twin-engine CV-580 Convair turboprop plane was traveling from
Oslo, Norway, to Hamburg, West Germany, when it went down 18 miles
north of the Danish fishing port of Hirtshals. The cause of the
crash was not known.
   Rescue officials previously had identified the aircraft as a
Convair 440, but company officials said it was a CV-580.
   All 50 passengers, employees of the Wilhelmsen Lines shipping
company of Oslo, and the crew of five were presumed dead. Three
women passengers carried British passports but were living in
Norway, the company said.
   A West German navy vessel taking part in a NATO sea exercise in
the area at the time of the crash pulled 31 bodies from the water
and brought them to Hirtshals where Danish officials began the task
of identification. Rescue officials said previously that 32 bodies
were recovered.
   The U.S.-built plane belonged to the Norwegian Partnair charter
airline company.
   In Oslo, the shipping company released the passenger list with
the names of 38 men and 17 women.
   The passengers, most of the top management and half of the staff
of Wilhelmsen Lines, were chosen by lottery for the trip to see a
ship christened in West Germany, company officials said.
   ``This is unbelievable tragedy on what was supposed to be a day
of celebration,'' said Leif Terje Loeddesoel, president of Wilh.
Wilhelmsen Ltd., the shipping line's parent company.
   Next of kin, many crying, arrived at the concern's Oslo office
late Friday and early today where a crisis team of pychologists and
clergymen awaited them.
   Clusters of people whose friends worked for the company gathered
outside its offices today waiting for a list of victims to be made
public.
   A Norwegian air disaster commission was preparing to go to
Hirtshals to work with Danish officials trying to determine the
cause of the crash.
   ``It would be pure speculation to say what caused the crash, but
whatever it was it must have happened very suddenly,'' said Rolf
Grimsrud, director of the Norwegian Civil Aviation technical
division.
   ``It could have been an explosion, due to sabotage or something
else, or it could have lost a major surface, such as a wing or the
tail,'' he said.
   Public radio quoted flight supervisor Karl Andersen at
Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport as saying that parts of the plane might
have broken off in mid-air.
   ``The radar signal disappeared very suddenly from our screens,
and it (the plane) went down fast,'' Andersen was quoted as saying.
   The Convair probably disintegrated when it hit the water, he
added.
   It was flying at an altitude of 23,000 feet when air controllers
at Kastrup Airport lost contact with it.
   Rescuers said most of the bodies were found within a radius of a
few hundred yards, which would appear to indicate that the plan did
not explode in mid-air.
   Partnair's managing director, Syvar Leivestad, said a fishing
boat picked up an underwater sonar echo that might be the wreckage,
but West German navy divers sent down to check could not confirm the
report due to poor visibility.
   The plane was built by General Dynamics 35 years ago and its
engines were refitted about 20 years ago.
   One week ago it had undergone a five-week maintenance check in
Canada before going back into service at Partnair.
   ``Despite being old our planes have less total mileage than many
planes built in the 1970s,'' Leivestad said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bush administration official says the United
States has sent a special envoy to the former King of Afghanistan to
discuss a possible political settlement of the Afghan civil war.
   The king, Zahir Shah, has been living in Rome since he was
deposed in 1973. A Soviet-backed coup took place in 1978, and a year
later Soviet forces invaded to install another puppet government.
   The Afghan government has faced a U.S.-supported insurgency that
was widely expected to topple the Soviet-supported government after
the withdrawal of Soviet troops in February.
   However, the government has held on, helped by both continuing
heavy arms shipments from the Soviet union and heavy air support as
well as disunity among the rebel factions.
   The United States has been exploring a political settlement for
several months.
   The king has both supporters and opponents among the resistance
groups.
   The U.S. envoy visited the king in Rome last week, said the
official who disclosed the visits Friday night, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   It was at least the second such consultation, he said. ``It was
not an extraordinary event.'' He declined to identify the envoy.
   In Rome, Gen. Abdul Wali, the king's brother-in-law and
spokesman, today declined to comment on the reported meeting.
   ``As a rule, we do not comment about these matters,'' he said.
``I really have no comment to make on this.''

   India will withdraw its peacekeeping
troops from Sri Lanka on or before Dec. 31, a senior government
official said today.
   An agreement on the new withdrawal date was reached by Indian and
Sri Lankan officials during a meeting of non-aligned nations in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the official said. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said Friday in New Delhi that
an agreement had been reached on the pullout of the estimated 42,000
Indian soldiers from Sri Lanka's northeast. But he refused to give
details.
   Gandhi held at least two meeting in Belgrade with Sri Lankan
Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne, who led his country's delegaion
at the non-algined meeting. Wijeratne also met with his Indian
counterpart, P.V. Narasimha Rao.
   The Sri Lankan official said Wijeratne told President Ranasinghe
Premadasa of the Indian proposal to withdraw Indian troops on or
before Dec. 31.
   Also today, the Sri Lankan government said in a statement that
Premadasa has agreed to examine opposition demands for reforms that
would overhaul the structure of the government.
   ``All these proposals need careful study and examination with a
view to achieving peace, normalcy and stability,'' the government
statement quoted Premadasa as telling the leaders of five opposition
parties on Friday night.
   Sri Lanka's opposition is calling for the formation of a
provisional government, the replacement of the presidential system
of government by the earlier parliamentary system, new elections and
efforts to bring anti-government militants to the democratic
mainstream.
   Opposition leaders met with Premadasa before an all-party
conference that he will convene on Wednesday.
   As Premasada met with opposition leaders, security forces killed
eight Sinhalese radicals in a continuing crackdown in central and
southern Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese heartland, the government said.
   Five militants were killed in a police attack in Peradeniya town
in Kandy district, 55 miles northeast of Colombo, a communique said.
Three radicals died in an ambush by soldiers in Kalutara district,
25 miles south of Colombo, the communique said. No other details
were disclosed.
   Elsewhere, a Sinhalese police constable and a woman were shot to
death by extremists in southern Sri Lanka and more than 235
suspected Sinhalese militants were arrested, the communique said.
   Sinhalese radicals belonging to the People's Liberation Front
have been trying for more than two years to overthrow the
Sinhalese-dominated government.
   They claim the government granted too many concessions to the
minority Tamils demanding a separate homeland in north and east Sri
Lanka and compromised the country's sovereignty by inviting India to
send its peacekeeping troops to help end the Tamil rebellion.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people.
They claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who
make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and
military.
   India, the regional power and home of more than 60 million
Tamils, mediated the July 1987 peace accord that offered the Tamils
limited autonomy if they surrendered their weapons.
   The accord was rejected by the largest and most militant Tamil
group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which began fighting
Indian forces.
   Premadasa earlier demanded Indian troops leave the island once
known as Ceylon by July 29, the second anniversary of the peace
accord. But Gandhi refused, saying a hasty withdrawal could lead to
even more bloodshed.
   The presence of Indian soldiers became a point of contention
between the two countries and resulted in a diplomatic deadlock that
at one point threatened to snowball into an armed confrontation.

   Masked activists stormed South
Africa's Consulate in Copenhagen and extensively damaged the offices
by throwing acid and setting small fires, newspaper reports said
today.
   Late Friday 20 to 30 people arrived in front of the consulate in
a truck, jumped out and smashed down the doors of the building with
wooden rams and crowbars, the Copenhagen newspaper Berlingske
Tidende reported.
   The masked intruders then vandalized the consulate offices by
pouring acid on the floor, smashing inventory, and scattering and
burning papers, the newspaper said.
   Police in riot gear arrived on the scene within a few minutes of
the break-in but failed to arrest any of the activists who had
strewn the street with steel blades to puncture the tires of the
police vans.
   Police said the activists were members of a squatter movement
known as BZ which has been in numerous violent confrontations with
the authorities in recent years, the paper said.
   It said the action was an apparent protest against this week's
South African elections in which the black majority was not allowed
to vote.
   The squatter movement is made up of several groups of youths who
have illegally occupied derelict buildings in Copenhagen for years.
Police have failed to evict them despite using force.
   BZ also is believed to have been behind a series of attacks on
Shell gas stations, presumably to protest Shell's business ties in
South Africa.

   More than 1,000 workers at one of the
country's two national broadcasting networks went on strike for the
second day Saturday, forcing regular radio and television programs
to be curtailed.
   The strikers say they want a say in selecting department chiefs
to ensure fairness and protect the company from government
interference. They say past authoritarian governments have tampered
with editorial policy.
   A union spokesman at Moonhwa Broadcasting Co. said the strike
will continue until its demands are met.
   Company officials said newscasters were replaced with non-union
members. They said some live programs, such as news and talk shows,
were suspended or shortened.
   The Korea Broadcasting System is the larger of the two national
broadcasting networks in South Korea.

<TEXT>
   Senators are calling for use of force as a last
resort to down planes delivering cocaine, and national drug policy
director William Bennett isn't ruling out such a policy.
   ``I agree with the sentiment expressed, Senator,'' Bennett said
Friday after Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other lawmakers urged
such action at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee session.
   Bennett stopped short of endorsing a McConnell amendment that
would provide law enforcement officials with such powers, but
acknowledged that the concept had appeal.
   ``It is analogous to, not identical to, but analogous to, it
seems to me, the authority we give a police officer in the inner
city in this country to stop someone from speeding away in a four by
four,'' Bennett said.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told the panel that if a drug-running
plane was ordered to land and refused to do so, then as a last
resort, ``I think we should blow it out of the air.''
   At the hearing, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., questioned Bennett
about reports that there have been cutbacks in a Miami-based program
designed to ferret out money-laundering drug kingpins, ``Operation
Greenback.''
   Bennett said he was unaware of it, but an aide, Bruce Karnes,
said, ``I have heard of it.'' He said after the hearings that he had
no details.
   ``Apparently there have been some cutbacks,'' said John Hanlon, a
spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, which has been operating
the program in conjunction with the Justice Department. He said
details would not be available immediately.
   Bennett said there was no plan to send U.S. fighting troops to
Colombia to engage the cocaine cartel. Among other things, he said,
Colombian President Virgilio Barco does not want foreign troops in
his country.
   The same applied to any multinational military force designed to
fight the drug lords, Bennett added.
   He said that if Colombia asked for troops to combat the cartel,
the United States would have to consider the request, but he added
that the possibility seemed remote and that there are no plans on
the drawing board.
   He said American officials aim to keep the several hundred U.S.
military advisers in Colombia away from any hostilities, but added
that there could be no guarantee.
   ``Hostilities can break out anyplace,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Turned out of power last month after 45
years of supreme rule, the Communist Party is hunting for a new
image and a program to win it a place in a more democratic Poland.
   Everyone agrees it will not be easy.
   As the first Communist Party in the East bloc to lose control of
government, it has few models to follow.
   ``Now it's a not a question of following examples, but setting
examples,'' said Janusz Kubasiewicz, Warsaw party chief and
Politburo member.
   Never accepted by most Poles who viewed the party as a Soviet
puppet, Polish communism itself never really fit the rigid Soviet
mold.
   The party grew out of the 1948 forced merger of the Polish
Socialist Party, an authentic Polish leftist movement, and the
pro-Moscow Polish Workers Party that replaced the Polish party
liquidated in the late 1930s on Stalin's orders.
   After the war, workers and students repeatedly challenged the
party's authority in a series of bloody uprisings. In 1980, the
independent workers' movement, Solidarity, seriously eroded the
party's legitimacy.
   Hundreds of thousands of party members joined Solidarity and 16
months later, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law to crush
the movement and stop further decline in the party.
   After labor unrest broke out in 1988 and the economy slid,
Jaruzelski forced the party to agree to legalize Solidarity again.
The April deal to legalize the union also called for Solidarity to
back partially free elections.
   Union-backed candidates swept to victory and the Communists
suffered a humiliating defeat. Although guaranteed a majority in the
Sejm, the powerful lower house of parliament, the Communists were
unable to form a government.
   On Aug. 24 Solidarity adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected to
lead Poland's first non-Communist government in 45 years.
   In the past few months, pragmatic party members have realized
drastic changes are needed if the party is to recover.
   One of the first tasks was to consider pruning the word Communist
from the lexicon.
   ``Our party must be a socialist party, we must get away from the
word `communism' because nobody knows what it means,'' said newly
elected Central Committee secretary Marek Krol. ``From now on we
must be a political party, or it's over.''
   Other changes are also in the offing. Fifteen deputies on behalf
of the Communist parliamentary caucus have proposed removing the
clause in the constitution that mandates that the Communist Party be
``the leading political force in society.''
   Deputy Sejm speaker Tadeusz Fiszbach says more such iniatitves
are likely. ``We don't want to be seen by the electorate as those
who are blocking change.''
   But cosmetic changes are not enough for Fiszbach. He wants to
ensure that the 173-member Communist caucus in Parliament will play
a role in shaping party policy, rather than being just a tool of the
Central Committee as in the past.
   Party leaders used to be seated in Parliament, but in June almost
all top party candidates were defeated. Those elected feel they owe
their election to the voters and not the party.
   ``The party leadership has to seek our opinion. We are not going
to cooperate with them under a dictate,'' said Fiszbach, former
Gdansk party leader who signed the agreements to legalize Solidarity
in 1980 and was stripped of his party positions for pro-Solidarity
sympathies in 1982.
   Changing its name and initiating popular legislation may help the
party, but it is trying to change its image at a time that it will
no longer have unlimited access to media.
   Mazowiecki intends to keep the powerful post of president of
radio and television committee for Solidarity.
   The Central Committee has turned over its department of
propaganda to Krol, who attracted attention as the editor of Wprost,
a provocative party weekly in the western city of Poznan.
   He wants to depoliticize the party's newspaper, Trybuna Ludu, get
internal party matters off the front page, and develop interesting
television programs.
   ``We have to prove we can be attractive, because biologically the
party is dying,'' he said.
   Party membership stands at about 2.1 million down more than a
million from 1980 and the average age is 46, the oldest in its
history. And 17.6 percent of the members are retirees, said an
August article in the party weekly Polityka.
   Membership slipped by 35,000 in the first half of 1989, Polityka
said, and party officials say they expect more members to quit.
   One of the things party members are worried about are their jobs.
Three out of four administrative jobs in Poland are held by people
who secured their positions through party patronage, Polityka said.
   There are signs that some of those workers already may be in
trouble. The strike committee at a northeast Poland meat packing
plant called off a protest Thursday after winning dismissal of the
manager, a party member, according to a Solidarity journalist
present at negotiations.
   Some party members are reportedly securing their futures by
converting government-owned businesses into private businesses owned
by them. Such conversions have been bitterly attacked in the
pro-Solidarity press.
   Fiszbach says the party cannot win social support as long as its
members retain privileges it cannot justify. But he said other party
members are determined to hang on to those perks.
   Such divisions threaten to split the party and there is talk that
the party could splinter into two or three groups.
   The question is what political orientation the party should
adopt. Some favor becoming an orthodox Communist Party while others
would prefer simply a broad-based social democratic party that could
possibly attract even left-leaning members of Solidarity.

   A high-ranking drug trafficker imprisoned
for the past month at the height of the drug crackdown was released
because authorities lacked an extradition request from the United
States, police said.
   However, a Drug Enforcement Administration official in Washington
said the trafficker was not being sought in the United States.
   The army said today it captured the four leading members of a
cocaine death squad in the drug center of Medellin and said the men
also served as bodyguards for the wife of fugitive drug kingpin
Pablo Escobar.
   Botoga's El Tiempo newspaper said today the army raided 30 sites
in Bogota and the rural town of Pacho and seized 49 vehicles,
including two bulletproof Mercedez Benz sedans, thought to belong to
drug boss Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha.
   In other developments:
   _The army said Friday it had arrested the pilot of one of the
nation's top cocaine barons and that he had flown cocaine to the
United States.
   _In Medellin armed gangs wearing white hoods terrorized the
embattled city Friday, setting fire to nine government vehicles,
including trucks and vans. The gangs, suspected of working for the
drug lords, hurled firebombs and fired shots in the air. No injuries
were reported, and police arrested one man. Many businesses closed
after receiving death threats over the telephone.
   Regarding the trafficker who was freed, police identified him as
a key aide to Escobar and said he was released Thursday because
there was no arrest warrant, legal paperwork, or extradition request
for him by the United States.
   Police Col. Oscar Pelaez Carmona said the aide, Luis Fernando
Galeano, was held at an army base for a month after being arrested
during a raid on a Medellin office building believed to house money
laundering operations. Pelaez said Galeano also was arrested in 1988
on charges of money laundering but had to be released because all
the legal paperwork on him disappeared.
   It was not known why his latest arrest was not made public either
in Colombia or the United States, which is helping Colombia with
financial aid and military equipment in its war on drugs and seeking
the extradition of top drug lords. The government began the
crackdown last month after a police chief, a judge and a
presidential candidate were killed in attacks blamed on dealers.
   Escobar, who leads the United States' most-wanted list, is said
to head a $3 billion worldwide cocaine empire. The government of
Colombia has offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to
his arrest.
   Colombian newspapers have said Galeano is a financial
administrator for the Medellin cartel and have linked him to the
assassination of city councilman in the town of Monteria and the
attempted slaying of a man connected to a rival drug cartel in the
city of Cali.
   In Washington, Frank Shultz, a spokesman for the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration, said Galeano was not wanted in the
United States and that there were no charges against him.
   Regarding the arrest of the death squad members, the 4th Army
Brigade in Medellin said in a communique that the gang, called
``Love for Medellin,'' took its name from a local charitable
organization and operated as a vigilante gang that killed suspected
drug addicts, prostitutes and homosexuals.
   It did not say when the four men were captured, but it said
``Love for Medellin'' frequently guarded Maria Victoria Henao
Vallejo, the wife of Escobar, alleged head of the Medellin cocaine
cartel.
   The newspaper El Tiempo said it received its information about
the confiscation of the drug barons' property from military sources.
   The Defense Department's press office was closed for the weekend.
   Colombian military authorities earlier showed reporters documents
attesting to vast holdings of Rodriguez Gacha, in which the reputed
drug boss, now in hiding, operated like a one-man multinational
corporation.
   The government, using its emergency powers, this week assigned a
military officer to replace the elected mayor of Pacho, 50 miles
northwest of Bogota. But it rescinded the action a few hours later,
after political parties said the move was unconstitutional.
   The army announced Friday it had arrested Escobar's pilot,
Nicolas Gonzalez Cardona, who allegedly flew cocaine to the United
States. The pilot was arrested in raids in the opening days of the
crackdown.
   The army said in a communique that Gonzalez made ``international
flights on one of the Medellin cartel's main routes'' between
Colombia, Miami and New York. The cartel is believed to supply 80
percent of the U.S. cocaine supply.

   Former President Reagan was in excellent
condition today after successful, hourlong brain surgery to remove
blood that accumulated following a horseback riding accident this
summer, spokesmen said.
   ``President Reagan is conscious and recovering in his room, where
he is comfortable and in good spirits,'' Mark Weinberg said, adding
that the operation went without complications.
   Weinberg said Friday he was unsure how long Reagan would remain
at St. Marys Hospital, which is part of the Mayo Clinic. ``When the
doctors tell him he can go home, he will,'' he said.
   The chief surgeon, Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt, would not comment on the
operation or the outlook for recovery, but Weinberg said Reagan was
listed in ``excellent and stable'' condition after the one-hour
operation ended about 5:15 p.m.
   At midmorning today, Dr. Michael J. Ebersold, a Mayo Clinic
spokesman, said Reagan's condition was unchaged, describing it as
stable. He refused to elaborate.
   Nancy Reagan spent the night in a room across the hall from her
husband at the hospital.
   Weinberg said the 78-year-old former president ``will be
carefully monitored, although no further treatment is anticipated.''
   Henry Brem, a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University Hospital
in Baltimore who was not involved in the surgery, said normal
recovery periods for the type of operation Reagan received include
about a week of hospitalization.
   The fluid on the upper right side of the brain _ blood that
accumulated after Reagan was bucked from a horse July 4 _ was found
during a routine examination at Mayo, where the Reagans have
received annual checkups since their pre-White House days.
   The decision to perform the surgery was made Friday morning after
doctors reviewed the results of a CAT scan done Thursday as a
follow-up to the horseback riding accident, Weinberg said. Neither
the former president nor Mrs. Reagan objected to the surgery, he
said.
   Sundt, an internationally renowned specialist in the human blood
delivery system who also is editor of the Journal of Neurosurgery,
was assisted by two other Mayo neurosurgeons, an anesthesiologist
and three nurses.
   Although Reagan had not experienced any symptoms, physicians had
advised the fluid be removed by making a ``small burr hole'' in
Reagan's skull and draining the fluid, Weinberg said. The procedure
was performed under a general anesthesia.
   Weinberg's description of the president's problem as a ``subdural
hematoma'' indicated the fluid had collected underneath the dura, a
membrane that covers the brain inside the skull. A hematoma is a
pool of blood, as in a bruise.
   A checkup at the clinic found the former president in otherwise
good health.
   President Bush tried to phone his predecessor from Air Force One
en route from New Orleans to Washington, but Reagan had already
entered surgery.
   ``I hope it's all right, pray it's all right,'' Bush told
reporters.
   The Reagans arrived Wednesday in the southeastern Minnesota town
about 70 miles southeast of Minneapolis and checked into the clinic
Thursday.
   The horse riding accident happened while Reagan was visiting the
ranch of William Wilson, a friend, near Cananea, Mexico, about 30
miles south of the Arizona border.
   Reagan was flown to an Army hospital in Arizona and kept about
four hours, declining a doctor's suggestion that he remain overnight
for observation. He was described as suffering from scrapes and
bruises.
   During his two terms, Reagan was hospitalized several times,
recovering from various ailments at a speed doctors called
impressive for a man his age.
   On March 30, 1981, Reagan was wounded in an assassination
attempt. A bullet one inch from his heart was removed, but by Oct.
30 he was declared in excellent health. On July 13, 1985, he
underwent successful surgery for cancer of the colon. Later
examinations during the balance of his second term showed no
recurrence.
   He also had surgery during his second term for enlargement of the
prostate, for skin cancer and for Dupuytrin's contracture, a
condition that caused his left hand to curve inward.

   The Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive
thundered into Billings just after sunrise today as 2,700 cattle and
2,400 riders moved slowly down Main Street in the morning chill.
   The sound of hooves and the rumble of the iron-shod wheels of 200
covered wagons reverbrated along the three-mile parade route.
Thousands of people gathered before dawn to watch the procession,
led by a Union cavalry unit and brought up by the mass of cattle.
   The herd of largely longhorn cattle swept across the six lanes of
the parade route, nearly surrounded by the 105 drovers who had
herded them over the plains during the past six days. A few people
reached out to touch the animals.
   The six-day journey, which began at Roundup about 60 miles north
of Billings, was to end tonight with a country-western concert.
   The drive was part of Montana's centennial celebration and also
commemorated the great cattle drives of the last century, which
began when Nelson Story brought the first herd of Texas longhorns to
Montana in 1866.
   Billings took extraordinary steps to welcome the sprawling
caravan.
   The U.S. Postal Service suspended mail delivery in north Billings
for today and all off-duty police officers and street sweepers were
called in.
   Assistant City Administrator John Lawton also urged viewers to
use ``extreme caution'' near the herd out of concern of a stampede.
   ``No one can predict with certainty how the animals will react,''
Lawton said Friday.
   Words of caution have been heard for days, but the experienced
wranglers tending the herd managed to head off any major problems on
the trail.
   Trail boss Jay Stovall, noting that he and 20 ranch hands
routinely herd 3,000 head of cattle between pastures on his ranch,
said having 100 top hands to handle the chore made the task simple.
   ``If we had 100 people who didn't know what they were doing, it
would be way too many,'' Stovall said. Experienced hands
``anticipate problems before they happen.''
   Thousands of Billings residents greeted the travelers Thursday at
the fourth-night camp about 21 miles north of the city _ and created
a miles-long traffic snarl.
   Cool, gray skies and light rain hung over the drive Friday
morning as the participants began their last day on the trail, but
the mood was exuberant.
   Hundreds of cars, trucks, mobile homes and even buses lined U.S.
87 north of Billings on Friday afternoon as spectators again swarmed
to watch the arrival of the wagon train and, a couple of miles
farther out, the cattle herd.
   The head of the column began to gather at a giant
red-and-white-striped ``beer tent.''
   Within minutes, Friday night's camp was set.
   The cattle were led to a pasture near the highway, and spectators
climbed over and through a barbed-wire fence to shake hands with the
drovers.

   A former Baylor University student contends in a
lawsuit that she was forced to quit school in 1987 because she was
pregnant and single.
   The Dallas Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit Thursday on
behalf of Dawn L. Bonner, alleging that officials of the university
in Waco violated her constitutional rights by failing to tell her
about an ``unwritten policy'' that requires unmarried, pregnant
students to leave the school.
   The policy also is discriminatory, the suit alleges, because no
male student has been forced to leave because a woman to whom he was
not married became pregnant.
   The school is run by the Southern Baptist Convention.
   A.A. Hyden, emeritus vice president for student affairs, one of
the officials named in the suit, and Basil Thomson, legal counsel
for the university, said Friday they had just received copies of the
suit and would have no immediate comment.
   Ms. Bonner, a pre-med student, was four months pregnant when she
asked her dorm mother if the school would make her move into private
housing because of her condition, the lawsuit said. She allegedly
was told, ``We have a reputation to keep and we can't have you
walking around pregnant.''
   The lawsuit alleges that a counselor at Baylor told Ms. Bonner
she could stay if she obtained an abortion. Ms. Bonner left Baylor
in October 1987, returned home and gave birth to a son in February
1988. She seeks damages and lawyers' fees.

<HEAD>Washington Topsy-Turvy: Deficit Helping Save Major Social Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one of the ironic twists that could happen
only in Washington, it appears the federal budget deficit is all
that is standing in the way of killing a major social program _
catastrophic health insurance for retirees.
   The way the government works, repealing the program would worsen
next year's deficit by about $5 billion. That's because taxes to
finance catastrophic are being collected more quickly then benefits
are being paid.
   Some who watch Congress closely say that even the deficit problem
is not enough to save the new insurance program. They predict the
House and Senate will repeal it.
   Catastrophic, which everyone eligible for Medicare is required to
buy, is under attack from some retirees who already have such
coverage and from some wealthier older Americans who don't like
having to buy coverage for those with lower incomes.
   Because of a barrage of complaints, the House Ways and Means
Committee and the Senate Finance Committee are making major changes
in the program, reducing benefits and cutting the surtax on
higher-income retirees that provides most of the money. But in Ways
and Means especially, there is heavy sentiment for repeal.
   Will the changes be enough to stave off repeal? Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, was asked.
   ``I don't know that,'' replied Mitchell, a member of the Finance
Committee.
   When Senate Republican leaders met with President Bush at the
White House last week, they came down hard for repeal. The
administration wants no changes.
   Neither committee will advocate repeal, because if it did so, it
would have to find about $5 billion of new taxes to prevent
worsening of the deficit.
   However, when the hotly disputed issue reaches the floor of the
House, congressional aides predict, most lawmakers will be unable to
resist voting for repeal.
   When the catastrophic-coverage law was enacted a year ago,
Congress and the Reagan administration agreed that it should be set
up like an insurance program. At least in the early years, money to
finance benefits would be collected at a faster pace than benefits
would be paid out.
   The first part of coverage went into effect this year, providing
some protection against expenses of a lengthy hospital stay.
Doctors' bills will be covered starting next year; most prescription
drugs will be covered starting in 1991.
   Some of the taxes and fees that finance catastrophic benefits are
already being paid by retirees; the biggest part of the bill will
become due when tax returns are filed early in 1990. But for at
least most of 1990, significantly less will be going out in benefit
checks than is being paid in.
   The Office of Management and Budget estimates that if
catastrophic coverage were repealed, the 1990 deficit would be
swollen by between $4 billion and $7 billion. That would be enough
under the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law to trigger automatic
reductions in most federal programs.
   But what is happening to those taxes and fees that retirees are
paying for catastrophic coverage? The money is being mixed with all
other tax dollars in the treasury _ paying federal salaries, buying
weapons and fighting illegal drugs.
   The money also is making the budget deficit look smaller than it
is _ and that's another burr under the saddle of those who don't
like the catastrophic program.
   When OMB Deputy Director William Diefenderfer was asked about
repeal at a Finance Committee session last week, he replied, ``Any
model I've seen for repeal increases the deficit. Therefore, we
would have to oppose it.''
   ``Does this program make money?'' demanded Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y. ``Is that why you want it?''
   Diefenderfer hastened to add that Bush likes the program for what
it does for retirees.
   But opponents of catastrophic coverage had another argument for
repeal. Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., accused the administration of
favoring the program as part of a strategy to balance the budget
``from the already-inadequate pensions of America's seniors.''

<HEAD>Tobacco Industry Lobbyists Fight Airliner Smoking Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minutes after the Senate Appropriations
Committee's decision last week to expand the smoking ban aboard
airliners, tobacco-state Sen. Ernest Hollings stood in a Capitol
corridor talking about the meeting.
   Interrupting the conversation, a bald, rotund man in a suit
sauntered up from behind the lawmaker and reached out to shake his
hand.
   ``Thanks on behalf of R.J. Reynolds,'' he told a smiling
Hollings, D-S.C., who had just been on the losing side of two votes
aimed at diluting the prohibition. ``It was a good try, but it was
stacked against us.''
   These are tough times on Capitol Hill for the R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. and the rest of the tobacco industry, one of the most
free-spending lobbies in Washington.
   Cigarette manufacturers find themselves puzzling over how to
prevent Congress from broadening the current ban on smoking on
airline flights of two hours or less, and they are clearly on the
defensive.
   The House voted Aug. 3 to make the restriction permanent, thus
preventing it from expiring next April. The Senate votes this week
on even stronger language permanently prohibiting cigarette smoking
on all domestic routes.
   ``I don't know what we'll do,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
whose state leads the nation in tobacco production. ``We'll do what
we have to do.''
   Helms doesn't rule out a filibuster _ protracted debate aimed at
preventing a vote _ and smoking ban supporters say they expect one.
   But other tobacco supporters concede that with the threat of
higher excise taxes on tobacco products and restrictions on
cigarette advertising always looming as a possibility, an all-out
fight over smoking on airplanes might not be wise.
   ``Is this the place we really want to lay down the gauntlet, or
should we fight it out over taxes,'' said Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky.,
who represents the country's No. 2 tobacco-growing state.
``Strategically, you have to be careful. You don't want to use all
your chips up.''
   The tobacco lobby has lots of ammunition to use. According to a
survey by Common Cause, the public interest lobbying group, the
cigarette business gave members of Congress $261,000 in speaking
fees last year, more than any other industry.
   Cigarette companies have also stepped up their efforts in recent
years to politically mobilize smokers.
   R.J. Reynolds, for example, maintains lists of smokers it
compiles from coupon rebates and other promotions and encourages
them to form local smokers' groups. The company pays for a meeting
space and provides refreshments, literature and a videotape at the
first meeting, encouraging them to fight restrictions such as
no-smoking areas and local cigarette taxes.
   Reynolds also mails smokers a newsletter six times per year
called ``Choice.'' And it maintains a toll-free hotline that it
encourages smokers to call when they hear of local anti-cigarette
efforts that may be brewing.
   ``We started the program because of the volume of mail we were
getting from smokers telling us they feel like second-class
citizens,'' said Betsy Annese, Reynolds spokeswoman in company
offices in Winston-Salem, N.C. ``It's all part of a program to help
smokers regain the rights they feel have been taken away from them.''
   Supporters of the airline smoking ban _ health groups and airline
employee unions _ say that all of this leaves them outgunned.
   ``There were two of us standing outside that room yesterday,''
ban supporter Jo Ellen Deutsch, a lobbyist for the Association of
Flight Attendants, said of Thursday's Senate Appropriations
Committee meeting. ``There were at least 30 tobacco people in that
hallway.''
   Nonetheless, most participants say they expect some tougher
version of the current restrictions to eventually become law.
   Advocates of the ban have several factors on their side,
including the fact that the author of the expanded restrictions in
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of the Appropriations
transportation subcommittee. Few lawmakers care to challenge him and
risk losing transportation projects for their districts.
   The issue is also one that many lawmakers have intense personal
feelings about because of their own experiences as smokers and
because they spend long hours on airliners traveling to and from
their districts.
   ``You try at every turn because our constituents don't understand
unless you fight at every turn,'' said Hollings. ``But we're in the
minority position.''

   Cabinet nominees to the Solidarity-led
government on Saturday unveiled plans for a Western-style tax system
and a liberalized economy, saying radical changes are crucial to
removing the vestiges of Communist control.
   The proposals were outlined for members of Parliament, who will
have final say on the new government proposed by Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   The 24-member Council or Ministers, or Cabinet, would include 12
ministers clearly aligned with the Solidarity labor movement. The
Communists would get four posts, although they have been guaranteed
control of the key defense and interior ministries.
   The shape of Poland's historic new government began to emerge as
Parliament members quizzed Cabinet nominees on economic, political
and social issues.
   ``We face an economic process unknown in history. Nobody ever
tried to pass from the socialist economy to a free-market economy,''
said Witold Trzeciakowski, a Solidarity adviser nominated as
chairman of the Economic Advisory Council.
   Solidarity's Leszek Balcerowicz, nominated as vice premier and
finance minister, outlined an overhaul in the tax system that
includes lowering taxes on profits and instituting a progressive
personal income tax and a value-added tax, a form of sales tax.
   Controls on wage inflation, liberalizing foreign trade rules,
protecting the drain of goods and capital from Poland and unifying
the official and black-market currency exchange rates also will be
part of the program, he said.
   The Parliament committees, which began the hearings Friday, have
generally given favorable assessments.
   The committee assessments are advisory, and the final decision
will be up to the Sejm, the powerful lower house of parliament which
is to vote on the cabinet Tuesday. A Solidarity-led coalition
controls the chamber, and it is unclear how it will react to
Mazowiecki's nominees, who are considered compromise candidates to
placate the Communists.
   By heading the interior and defense ministries, the Communists
will retain control of the army and police, although it remains
unclear how much power Mazowiecki will have to overrule individual
ministries.
   ``The army is a pro-reform institution,'' Gen. Florian Siwicki, a
Communist nominated to remain defense minister, declared to one
committee Saturday.
   Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, Mazowiecki's predecessor as prime minister
and his nominee to remain head of the Interior Ministry, told a
committee he will not nominate non-Communists as his deputies.
   He said that would invite ``political discussions'' making it
difficult to execute his powers, but he added that he wants the
ministry independent of party control and he will be loyal to
Mazowiecki.
   Also joining Mazowiecki's proposed government are the Peasant
Party and Democratic Party, former Communist Party allies who
shifted allegiance to Solidarity and creating a coalition strong
enough to convince the Communists to cede control.
   Peasant Party members have been nominated to four posts and
Democrats to three.
   The foreign minister nominee, lawyer Krzysztof Skubiszewski, is
considered an independent, although he is friendly toward Solidarity.
   Skubiszewski said he would like his foreign ministry ``to open a
very difficult matter'' amd make possible the return of deported
Poles forced to remain in the Soviet Union after World War II.
   Jacek Kuron, a veteran opposition activist nominated as labor
minister, said the law on strikes would be amended to simplify the
procedure for staging a legal work stoppage, while introducing the
principle that no wages are paid to strikers.
   Because of the disparate and still-evolving elements in Poland's
embryonic government, officials have cautioned that compromises and
debates in the coming days still could alter the makeup of the
government that Mazowiecki has proposed.
   Despite the Western slant the new government may take, the
Communist Party will still wield considerable economic power through
President Wojciech Jaruzelski, who appointed Politburo member
Wladyslaw Baka as president of the National Bank of Poland,
newspapers reported Saturday.
   But the Communists will no longer control the vast minsterial
bureaucracies they have run since 1948. Mazowiecki has promised
personnel decisions based on competence, not a ``witch hunt.''
   Solidarity Leader Lech Walesa, who put together the coalition
that elected Mazowiecki, was maintaining a distance from the
historic changes in keeping with his role as opposition figure. He
said he will not be pulling the strings from behind the scenes.
   ``No, I am out,'' he told the state news agency PAP. ``I am
interested only in pluralism, freedom and democracy. And when
everything works, I am really going on vacation. I will not enter
the government.''

<HEAD>Crackdown in Beijing Highlights Changes in Taiwan</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For most of its 40 years in power, the
ruling Nationalist Party has maintained that when the people of
mainland China rose up, Taiwan would attack and win back its right
to rule.
   But in April, May and June, when China was rocked by
pro-democracy demonstrations, the Nationalists dropped the idea that
Taiwan could govern the mainland.
   That was part of Taiwan's complex reaction to the repression in
Beijing _ a reaction that highlights the about-face Taiwan has made
since the death of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.
   The political opposition provided another example: During the few
years since political debate has been allowed in Taiwan, opposition
politicians have advocated the declaration of a Taiwan independent
from the mainland.
   But after the brutal crackdown in Beijing, just when the time
seemed right, the opposition changed its tune.
   Talk of independence was placed on the back burner as the
opposition pushed for further democratic reforms on this island of
20 million.
   Once known for its rabid anti-Communism, Taiwan is now famous for
its powerhouse economy. Once notorious for its jackboot security
agencies, the island now has a lively political scene, which is
evolving towards democracy.
   Among the common people, reaction to events in China was a
contradictory mixture of detachment and pain. Donations of blood and
millions of dollars, which never made it to China, coincided with
celebrations of a new stock market high.
   ``The massacre in Beijing has showed us we cannot be part of the
Communists, but we also cannot be rid of them,'' said Hsiao
Hsia-huang, professor of sociology at Taiwan University. ``We have
different societies but we are still Chinese.''
   For the ruling Nationalist Party, the trouble in China helped
solidify the most important policy change since martial law was
lifted in 1987 after 38 years.
   On June 3, as Chinese troops used tear gas for the first time in
40 years in Beijing, Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui abandoned a
decades-old myth that Taiwan can govern China.
   ``We must have the courage to face the fact that at this moment
we are unable to effectively exercise the right to govern the
mainland,'' Lee told a meeting of party leaders.
   For the bulk of their 40 years in power, the Nationalists, under
Chiang's leadership, had vowed to invade the mainland once the
Chinese rose up.
   Lee, instead, committed the island to a pragmatic foreign policy
designed to compete with Beijing for international recognition. On
July 20, the policy had its first big success when Taiwan
established relations with Grenada, making the Caribbean nation the
first country with ties to both Beijing and Taipei, although China
later severed its ties.
   On the ideological front, the crackdown in Beijing gave Taiwan
``an opportunity to vindicate what we've been saying for 40 years,''
said Ma Ying-jeou, a rising star in the ruling party and head of the
Cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council.
   But that opportunity wasn't seized.
   The party issued several lackluster statements and organized
demonstrations among university students to support the democracy
movement, but government officials closed a ``democracy wall'' at
Taiwan University once criticism turned to Taiwan.
   A Hong Kong activist said Taiwan refused to help him smuggle
Chinese dissidents from the mainland. And a government source said
Taiwan's military on Quemoy Island turned back a Chinese student who
rowed there and claimed he had participated in the pro-democracy
movement.
   While other countries imposed sanctions, Taiwan took no measures
to limit its blossoming contact with the mainland. Instead, less
than a week after the massacre, Taiwan opened direct mail and
telephone links for the first time since 1949.
   ``The government policy was based on its security concerns,''
said Jaw Shau-kang, a Nationalist legislator. ``They fear the
Communists, so they were very careful. I personally think we could
have done more.''
   Some observers say the government appeared uncomfortable
criticizing China for human rights violations when Taiwan's
increasingly lively press is willing to expose the skeletons in the
Nationalist's own closet.
   Indeed, after the crackdown, opposition politicians and
intellectuals filled newspapers with essays and letters, calling on
the government to quicken the pace of democratic reforms in Taiwan.
   ``If those students who marched to Tiananmen Square came to
Taiwan, I believe they would also demonstrate,'' editor Antonio
Chiang wrote in The Journalist, Taiwan's leading news magazine.
   Chaing said the only thing Taiwan could do in response to the
massacre was to democratize.
   Following the lead of their Beijing classmates, Taiwan high
school students put up posters calling for the withdrawal of
military officers stationed in every school on the island.
Authorities ripped them down.
   ``As Chinese dissident Liu Binyan and student leader Wu'er Kaixi
were heading overseas, was the Nationalist Party thinking about
letting its own blacklisted dissidents return?'' opposition leader
Lin Cheng-chieh wrote in the China Times.
   Despite the debate, many observers said they didn't think the
stronger calls would spark faster change.
   ``The Nationalists can relax because they know that no matter
what they do, they're still better than the Communists,'' said
Chiang of The Journalist.
   Add to that the confusion the crackdown caused among the
opposition and the case for quickened reform seems even weaker.
   Before June 3, many in the opposition felt that Taiwan should
declare independence from China and abandon the ``one China'' policy
pursued by Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist allies.
   But China has warned Taiwan that it risks invasion if the island
declares independence. After the crackdown, many activists began to
take the threat seriously.
   ``If they are crazy enough to shoot their own people, they might
be crazy enough to attack us,'' said Lu Yu, a top official in the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
   Since the Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to Communist forces on the mainland, Taiwan and China have
had little to do with each other.
   But in the 1980s, the two sides began to edge closer. China began
opening to the West. Taiwan allowed its people to travel to China
and invest in the mainland's reforming economy. Beginning last year,
Taiwanese journalists were welcomed on the mainland.
   The crackdown came as the two sides were just getting to know
each other.
   ``Things were just getting better between all of us, and then
this had to happen,'' said Lee Ying-shih, a noodle stall operator
who returned to Nanjing last year for the first time since 1949.

<HEAD>Legal Expert Cites ``Zero Chance'' of Families Winning Compensation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The families of the 47 sailors killed in an
explosion aboard the USS Iowa last spring stand little chance of
winning compensation by suing the Navy, legal experts say.
   ``It's like rolling huge boulders uphill to try to sue the
military for this kind of thing,'' said Paul Rothstein, a Georgetown
University law professor.
   Because ``all the victims were on active duty, they have zero
chance of prevailing (in a lawsuit) against the federal government
regardless of the cause,'' said Eugene Fidell, a Washington lawyer
specializing in military affairs.
   He noted that the families of the victims are entitled to
standard death benefits from the government and that most members of
the military take out a $50,000 life insurance policy. Those
payments, however, likely would be a fraction of the typical jury
award in cases of alleged civilian negligence.
   The Pentagon, in its report Thursday on the April 19 gun turret
explosion that claimed the lives of 47 sailors, said circumstantial
evidence indicated gunner's mate Clayton M. Hartwig intentionally
caused the blast.
   Hartwig's family says the Navy is trying to make him the
scapegoat for its own negligence.
   The Pentagon report cited other problems on the Iowa, such as
sailors not trained fully in firing procedures. But officials ruled
out those deficiencies as a cause of the blast.
   And legal experts said the Pentagon has no direct financial
incentive to place the blame on Hartwig.
   ``The question that occurs as a policy matter is should these
victims (in military catastrophes) receive something more than the
usual compensation,'' Fidell said.
   The Supreme Court, in a 1950 decision that has come to be known
as the Feres Doctrine, gave the government sweeping protection from
lawsuits by members of the military injured on active duty.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote in 1988, extended that shield to
military contractors in most cases as it threw out a $725,000 jury
award to the family of a Marine helicopter copilot killed in a 1983
crash when he was unable to open an escape hatch.
   The court said in that case a military contractor is protected
from being sued when the product it sells conforms to reasonably
precise Pentagon specifications and the government is warned about
any known potential dangers.
   Thus, even if the Pentagon had concluded the gun and ammunition
aboard the Iowa were defective, there might be little grounds for a
successful suit against any military contractors.
   While military victims of disasters have little legal recourse
against the government or its agents, political factors sometimes
come into play.
   For example, the families of some of the seven astronauts who
died in the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion were granted
millions of dollars in a settlement with the government and Morton
Thiokol, manufacturer of the shuttle's booster rockets.
   ``That had to do with politics rather than law,'' said Rothstein.
The government wanted ``to keep the space program sympathetic to the
American people. It would have had a good case to resist paying
anything.''
   While Congress allows the government to be sued in some cases,
there is little indication it is willing to lower the military
immunity shield put in place by the 1950 high court ruling.
   But the Iowa explosion is causing concern on Capitol Hill.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, noted that the Pentagon report
cited Navy shortcomings without exploring them fully.
   ``The report gives a lot of detail on (Hartwig) while leaving
many questions about Navy failures open,'' she said. ``I really do
hope they're not sweeping things under the carpet.''

   The specter of world hunger is moving nearer as
the population grows and the land loses its capacity to grow enough
food to keep pace, says Lester R. Brown, head of Worldwatch
Institute.
   ``With more hungry people in the world today than when this
decade began, there's little to celebrate on the food front as we
enter the '90s,'' he said.
   Brown, in a World Watch magazine report released Saturday, said
he sees no sure-fire way to boost global food production enough in
the 1990s to keep pace with expected population growth.
   ``The only reasonable goal will be to try and cut (population
growth) in half by the end of the century, essentially what Japan
did in the '50s and what China did in the '70s,'' he said.
   But reaching that goal will be ``perhaps more demanding than
anything the international community has ever undertaken,'' Brown
added.
   ``For the United States, the obvious first step is to restore its
funding of the United Nations Population Fund and International
Planned Parenthood Federation, which was canceled several years ago
in response to pressures from the political right,'' he said.
   The United States halted its support for the U.N. agency in 1986.
   ``Given the link between population growth and environmental
degradation, President George Bush cannot credibly call himself an
environmentalist if funding is not resumed,'' Brown said. ``In the
process, the United States could reinvigorate the international
family planning effort.''
   Last May, the United Nations Population Fund said that unless
women win more access to birth control, education and employment,
the world's population could almost triple to 14 billion by the year
2100.
   Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. agency, said the
world's population, now at 5.2 billion, may be held to 10 billion in
the next century if family planners succeed in reducing birth rates.
   In pulling its funding for the U.N. agency, the Reagan
administration contended it promoted coercive abortion, but Mrs.
Sadik said the reasons were political. She said movements such as
religious fundamentalism ``seem to be designed to somehow keep women
in bondage.''
   She expressed hope the Bush administration would resume the U.S.
contribution.
   However, the Bush administration has continued Reagan's policy of
not funding the agencies based on the idea that no federal funds
should be spent for population control that involves abortion.
   Brown, whose private, non-profit Worldwatch Institute for years
has espoused population control as part of its research and policy
recommendations, said some progress has been made in scaling back
birth rates, from about 2 percent annually in 1970 to 1.7 percent
this year.
   However, this decline has been so slow the annual incremental
increase is actually going up, he said. The world is now projected
to add 921 million people during the 1990s, the largest increment
ever for a decade.
   ``In many developing countries, soaring population now has a dual
effect on food balance,'' Brown said. ``It increase demand as it
degrades the agricultural resource base.
   ``For instance, crowded cities and villages create a need for
firewood that exceeds the sustainable yield of local forests.
Deforestation is the outcome, which in turn increases rainfall
runoff and soil erosion.''
   Brown said soil erosion tops the list of enviromental trends that
threaten humankind. Other hazards include air pollution's damage to
crops and its long-term effect on climate.
   Last year's drought in the United States and its lingering
effects in some areas reduced world grain output. Even with larger
crops this year, global stockpiles are still short, Brown said.
   With reduced output, world grain prices rose by roughly one-half
from July 1987 to July 1988 and have remained relatively high since,
he said.
   ``For many heavily indebted Third World countries, rising grain
prices are combining with falling personal incomes to pose a policy
dilemma,'' Brown said. ``Price hikes are needed to stimulate output
and encourage additional investment by farmers, but the world's poor
can't cope easily.
   ``Perhaps a billion or more of the world's people already spend
70 percent of their income on food. For many in this group, a
dramatic rise in the cost of grain is life threatening.''
   In the United States, a $1 loaf of bread contains only about five
cents worth of wheat. If the price of wheat were to double, the
price of the loaf would increase to only $1.05, Brown said. But in
poor countries, where wheat is bought at local markets and ground
into flour at home, a doubling of wheat prices means a doubling of
bread prices.
   ``A food price rise that is merely annoying to the world's
affluent can drive consumption below the survival level among the
poor,'' he said.

   About 200 refugees from Beirut fighting,
shouting ``Have mercy on us,'' protested in Sidon Saturday to demand
a halt to six months of battles between Christian and Syrian forces.
   Police said military duels Saturday in the capital area killed
three people and wounded 12. The latest casualties raised the toll
to 833 people killed and 2,474 wounded since the fighting broke out
in March.
   As the refugees marched in Sidon, they chanted, ``Have mercy on
us, we want to return to our city!''
   Ousama Saad, an official of the Popular Nasserite militia that
controls Sidon, told demonstrators they will be sheltered in
government-run schools during the weekend.
   ``We don't want charity! We don't want shelters! We want our
Beirut back!'' a demonstrator shouted back.
   Schools have been closed throughout Lebanon during the
confrontation between Michel Aoun's mostly Christian forces and
Syrians allied with local militias. The fighting broke out after
Aoun blockaded ports run illegally by the militias.
   Aoun has vowed to drive out the 40,000 Syrian troops, who came to
Lebanon under terms of a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. He
says they have sided with the Moslems in the country's 14-year-old
civil war.
   In Beirut, about 20 members of the International Youth for Peace
Movement gathered Saturday for about 15 minutes at a
Moslem-Christian crossing to demand an end to fighting. They
released six white pigeons to symbolize peace.
   The group, which included several foreigners, broke up as the
crackle of machine guns echoed nearby.
   Unusually heavy rains and high winds struck Lebanon on Friday,
uprooting tents and some flimsy shacks that had sheltered the
refugees on the outskirts of Sidon.
   About 300 families, mainly Sunni Moslems from Beirut, have been
camping on the banks of the Awali River at the southern provincial
capital of Sidon about 25 miles from Beirut.
   ``May Allah's wrath fall on all the combatants. Their dirty war
has destroyed our houses and prevented us from repairing them,''
said Aisha Itani, a housewife. She has been living in a tent on the
river bank with her husband and two sons.
   According to police estimates, all but 150,000 of Beirut's 1.5
million people have fled the city for safer areas during the
fighting. Many of the refugees have been living in tents, cars and
shacks in fields and on river banks awaiting an end to the fighting.
   Also Saturday, rival Christian and Moslem leaders urged a
three-member Arab League mediation committee to resume its stalled
peace efforts.
   The committee _ which includes leaders of Saudi Arabia, Morocco
and Algeria _ said July 28 it was suspending its efforts on Lebanon
and blamed Syria for blocking its mission.
   The committee is to hold a meeting in the Saudi Red Sea port of
Jeddah Wednesday to decide if it can take up its mission again.
   Sunni Moslem leader Sheik Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, in a statement
broadcast by the Moslem Voice of the Nation radio, said he
``welcomes the revival of Arab efforts to deal with the Lebanese
crisis.''
   A Christian Cabinet led by Aoun, which is vying for power with
the Syrian-backed Moslem government of Salim Hoss, also welcomed the
committee's efforts.

told about proposal. Pickup 4th pvs, `The reformist.. .'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hungary is seeking a military accord
with Yugoslavia and Austria, the first time a Warsaw Pact nation has
sought to forge such an agreement with nations that do not belong to
the Soviet-led alliance.
   Communist Party chief Rezsoe Nyers unveiled the proposal Friday
that includes creation of a security zone with the two neighbors
that would be free of Warsaw Pact tanks.
   Nyers also said he would remove 14 of the 28 nuclear launching
pads in Hungary to reduce military costs and improve relations with
the West.
   The proposal awaits formal government adoption before being
presented to Austria and Yugoslavia, but he and other Communist
leaders consulted with the two neighboring countries before
presenting it Friday, Nyers said.
   ``We consulted with Vienna and Belgrade and received favorable
feedback,'' he said during a news conference in the capital.
   The reformist leader said he would ask the Soviet Union to pull
out two armored battalions, 72 tanks, from a planned security zone
that Hungary envisions establishing with neutral Austria and
non-aligned Yugoslavia.
   The initiative illustrates the great changes in the Soviet bloc
since Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took power in 1985.
   As a member of the Warsaw Pact alliance, Hungary normally acts in
concert with its six military allies. Nyers said Moscow had been
consulted on parts of the plan that directly involve the Soviet
Union, but neighboring Czechoslovakia and Romania, which also are
allied, were not.
   ``The present foreign policy doctrine of the Warsaw Pact allows
for independent initiatives by member countries,'' he told
reporters. Nyers was apparently alluding to a Warsaw Pact meeting in
July that ended with the seven member nations pledging to let each
go their own way.
   Hungary plans multiparty elections by June, the first since it
became a Communist country. The nation is at odds with the rigid
Communist leadership of Romania and Czechoslovakia over political,
ecologial and human rights issues.
   Its plan to unilaterally improve military ties with its
non-Warsaw Pact neighbors was likely to worsen tensions with those
Communist allies.
   Nyers' proposal includes:
   _Halving the number of launching pads capable of delivering
nuclear devices.
   _Calling on the Soviet Union to withdraw two armored battalions
from a 35-mile buffer zone along common borders with Austria and
Yugoslavia and scrapping 200 Hungarian tanks now in the zone.
   _Asking Austria and Yugoslavia to declare security zones on their
sides of the border, expanding the common buffer zone to 60 miles.
   _Providing information on the size and location of forces within
the zone.
   _Limiting the frequency and size of military maneuvers and
allowing military observers from the two neighboring countries to
attend such exercises.
   Nyers also proposes that the three countries join forces to limit
and reduce military-related nuclear activities, to ban chemical
weapons, and to explore jointly cutting military expenditures.
   Nyers offered no further details about the location of the
nuclear launch bases or the range of missiles they could be used for.
   Hungary in May removed its border fortications with Austria,
allowing thousands of East bloc residents to flee to the West.
Hungary, like Poland, is embarking on a wide range of liberal
economic and political reforms and is seeking closer ties to the
West to bolster its economy.

   National Public Radio is taking a new hard line
on sports.
   If sports news is important, it gets on the air; if it isn't, it
doesn't.
   Pete Rose's gambling woes were important at NPR, as were the
death of Major League Baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti and firing
of Dallas Cowboys football caoch Tom Landry.
   Until recently, NPR's popular ``Morning Edition'' show may have
tossed such stories into short, hourly compilations of scores and
games results that often are called the ``ghetto'' approach to radio
sports coverage.
   Not now.
   ``Sports today is no longer scores,'' says Robert Ferrante,
executive producer of ``Morning Edition,'' which has dropped its
hourly sports updates and now lets sports compete for airtime with
other types of news.
   NPR, a nonprofit, private corporation that provides national
programming and support for 377 stations nationwide, is touting its
``different kind of news'' in its first multimedia campaign for
``Morning Edition'' and ``All Things Considered.''
   Local TV stations are playing sprightly animated ads for the
shows, and national and regional magazines are scheduled to carry
print ads as part of a drive to expand the audience of 6 million who
are attracted to NPR news shows, NPR spokeswoman Cate Cowan said.
   The 10-year-old ``Morning Edition'' is an eclectic mix of
in-depth news, arts, business, political and science features and
interviews hosted by Bob Edwards. It still has segments by veteran
sportscasters Red Barber and Bill Littlefield, but it no longer
locks sports into hourly 3}-minute slots.
   ``It was too restrictive. It didn't give due attention to sports
as part of the culture of this country,'' Ferrante said in an
interview last week.
   The allegations that Rose, baseball's alltime hit leader and
manager of the Cincinnati Reds, bet on the game ``was a morality
play for America,'' Ferrante said.
   Giamatti's unexpected death a week after he barred Rose from
baseball ``is probably as important to a larger section of America
as any national leader,'' Ferrante added.
   ``The part that sports plays in our culture is a news story and
should be judged the same way as other news stories,'' Ferrante
added. ``Sports is news, sports is fitness, sports is health. Sports
today rarely reflect the outcome of the game.''
   Ferrante said scores now are delivered once on ``Morning
Edition'' ``as a quick measurement'' of sports activity. But he
denied that NPR was rolling back it's sports coverage.
   The features by Barber and Littlefield still air in the old
sports time slot and still are among the most popular features on
``Morning Edition,'' Ferrante said. The other sports carried
throughout the broadcast means more airtime for sports, he said.
   ``Since June 19 there have been 120 (sports) stories on `Morning
Edition,''' he said.
   The change appears to have been well received at public stations.
   ``I think it's a good idea to treat sports news as news when it
is news, rather than ghetto-ize it,'' said Iris Adler, news director
of public station WBUR-FM in Boston. ``Our listeners tune in for
news and information. I don't think they listen to us for one type
of news or feature story. All they want is quality.''
   ``I'm happy with the change,'' said Carol Pierson, program
director for all news station KQED-FM in San Francisco. ``I think
it's more logical to treat topics according to their news importance
rather than dedicating a specific amount of time to a particular
topic.''
   Pierson said a lot of public stations previously cut out the
hourly NPR sports segment to broadcast local news or sports, ``and
we were one of them. So I'd say sports is now getting on our air
more than it was before.''
   She noted NPR's new approach was more in line with sports
coverage on the major TV networks.
   ``You hear sports news if it is important, and none if it
isn't,'' she said.
   The change was not without its critics. Edwards, the affable host
of ``Morning Edition,'' thinks it was a bad idea, although he
admitted his probably was a minority view at NPR.
   He said listeners don't know when to tune in for the sports.
   Edwards said a recent Gallup Poll conducted for NPR mostly on
``Morning Edition,'' ``showed our listeners don't care much for
sports,'' so sports news should be placed where those who are
interested can find it.
   ``Sports fans expect to hear sports where they've always heard
sports. And people who don't like sports feel the rest of the news
is being trivialized by having sports in that slot,'' he said.
   Edwards said listeners ``sort of plan their activities'' around
certain segments of the show: ```Oh, that's Afghanistan. I can
shower now.'''

   Screenwriter Barry Morrow, who won an
Academy Award for the script of ``Rain Man,'' has finally been
awarded his bachelor of arts degree by St. Olaf College.
   St. Olaf President Melvin George described Friday's presentation
as ``a production 20 years in the making.''
   Morrow thought he had earned the degree in 1970, when he first
attended the school's commencement, joining his classmates in the
procession to the podium to receive diplomas. But when he returned
to his seat and opened his diploma, he found a message: ``See Miss
Frayseth.''
   Morrow had spent his junior year studying in Hawaii. Miss
Frayseth, a St. Olaf registrar, had decided to reject certain
credits from Hawaii, leaving Morrow one credit short of graduation.
   After Morrow won an Oscar this year for best original screenplay
for ``Rain Man,'' college officials told him he could earn that
elusive final credit by handing in his script as a sort of
graduation thesis.

   Britain said Saturday it will free an Iranian
convicted on bombing charges after nine years in prison. Iran has
indicated it would like to exchange the Iranian for a jailed Briton.
   The Foreign Office said it will release Kourosh Fouladi, a former
doorman at the Iranian Embassy who was convicted in 1982 after a car
bombing attempt and sentenced to 10 years in jail. Authorities said
two of Fouladi's accomplices were killed in the explosion in West
London.
   In August, Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi of Iran linked
Fouladi's case with that of Roger Cooper, a Briton who has been
imprisoned in Iran without trial since 1985 on suspicion of spying.
   However, Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said earlier
this year there was no provision in British law for exchanging
Fouladi for Cooper.
   A British Foreign Office official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Iranian's release ``has absolutely nothing to
do'' with Cooper.
   A spokesman for the Home Office, speaking about Fouladi's
release, said Saturday: ``He was convicted and sentenced to 10 years
which he has now served, taking into account normal remission which
is available to any prisoner. He will now be deported to Iran.''
   Britain had been trying to improve ties with Iran, but relations
soured after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a death
threat in February against British author Salman Rushdie.

<HEAD>Numbers Swell In Hungarian Refugee Camps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The number of East Germans waiting in
shelters swelled to nearly 7,000 Saturday as more refugees poured
into Hungary in hopes of being included in a mass migration to West
Germany.
   Seventy refugees fled from the camps to Austria overnight, but
Hungary was forced to open two new makeshift shelters to accommodate
the estimated 200 East Germans who continue to arrive in Hungary
each day.
   There are now almost 7,000 East Germans waiting for word that
Hungary will become the first East bloc government to help the
citizens of another communist nation go west, Hungarian Red Cross
leader Csilla von Boeselager said Saturday.
   They were being housed in tent communities and boarding houses in
Budapest and in a summer camp taken over by nearly 2,000 refugees on
the shores of Lake Balaton.
   Refugees who talked to reporters Saturday appeared hopeful they
could leave early next week. They were reacting to reports from
Hungary's Communist Party President Rezso Nyers and West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher that the refugees will be
taken to West Germany soon.
   ``We can pack our few things together any moment and leave,''
said one East German who refused to give his name. ``Let's hope it's
soon.''
   Red Cross officials who requested anonymity said it was still not
clear whether the refugees would be taken in buses, trains, or their
own cars.
   Austrian railroad officials said more than a week ago that they
had 50 rail cars ready to go if they got word that a ``freedom
train'' would take the East Germans from Hungary across Austria to
tent cities in Bavaria.
   The East Germans have ridden a roller coaster of emotions in the
past 10 days. Initial optimism gave way to disillusionment when top
Hungarian officials said the situation might take weeks to resolve.
   Hungary has been caught between the two Germanys in the crisis.
It is anxious to prove to Bonn that Budapest has a new commitment to
Western concepts of human rights, but fearful of deepening an
ideological rift with the hard-line Communists in East Berlin. Under
a long-standing bilateral agreement, Hungary is obliged to return
home East Germans fleeing to the West.
   The camps, meanwhile, have celebrated at least two baptisms and
one wedding. Andras Kovacs, an official at the largest Budapest
facility, said in an interview that the unidentified bride at one
wedding was so grateful for the shelter she received that she gave
her bouquet to camp officials.
   Six thousand East Germans have fled over the border with Austria
since Hungary began dismantling fortifications along the divide in
May. Seventy more arrived in Austria early Saturday after trudging
through territory that still contains barbed wire, flares and other
remnants of the Iron Curtain.
   Red Cross officials noted the number was down from the 100 or so
who arrived the night before, and they attributed the decrease to
growing optimism in the camps that the refugees will be taken to
West Germany.

   Billy and Cole Neer, two little boys with
a passion for baseball, hunted for golf balls outside a driving
range near their home, selling them back for a penny apiece and
spending the proceeds on baseball cards.
   On Labor Day, they told their father they were going out to look
for more golf balls. Hours later, the boys, age 10 and 11, were
found stabbed to death in a nearby park.
   ``They were pretty quiet, and real polite,'' recalled Chad Johns,
19, a clerk at Diamond Kings Baseball Card Co., a tiny shop the
brothers had frequented. ``They wouldn't interrupt when you were
helping somebody else.''
   ``How could somebody murder two little kids like that?'' Johns
asked.
   That question is heard often in the cafes, stores, churches and
schools in this verdant Columbia River city of 46,000.
   Autopsies showed Billy died of a stab wound in the abdomen and
Cole of a stab wound in the chest. Police said both boys had been
stabbed repeatedly, though there was no evidence they had been
molested or tortured.
   The boys were buried Saturday at their birthplace in North Dakota.
   As police search for leads, school counselors are busy soothing
the fears and grief of schoolmates and other children. Counselors
and parents are warning their children to beware of strangers and to
stay away from isolated areas.
   The boys' bodies were found in David Douglas Park, which they
often cut through to get to the driving range, said their father,
Clair Neer.
   The wooded, hilly park often a place of shouting children,
mothers with babies, joggers and bicyclists. But on a sunny
afternoon four days after the bodies were found, few ventured there
except police on small motorcycles.
   There is widespread shock at the brutality and senselessness of
the killings, and there is anger too, said Linda Herrington, a
spokeswoman for the Vancouver School District.
   ``Children have lost their freedom to explore and enjoy the
outdoors,'' she said, ``and that is a real loss.''
   ``The kids are telling us: `I'm scared, maybe this will happen to
me, too,'' said Syreece McLean, a school counselor. Parents are
turning out by the score to walk their children to schools, she said.
   Parents must confront the fact that crime they read about in the
newspaper can happen even in a peaceful community like this one,
Herrington said.
   ``This kind of thing just doesn't happen in Vancouver,'' said
Police Capt. Ray Anderson.
   ``We don't know who did this, but I've got to think that the
killer had something really wrong with him,'' Anderson said. ``Good
Lord, to go out and kill 10- and 11-year-old boys ...''
   He said police have no motive for the killings and no suspects.
   On Friday, Vancouver detectives contacted FBI agents in
Washington, D.C., and received an initial psychological profile of a
possible killer. Anderson said that was helpful, but he would
release no details. Detectives also combed David Douglas Park again
during the weekend to make sure they missed no evidence.
   The boys' father told The Columbian newspaper he also is
convinced the boys were killed by ``an awful sick person,'' a
stranger.
   Clair Neer, 35, a single parent and unemployed automobile glass
repairman, moved with his surviving son, Richard, 6, across the
Columbia River to Hillsboro, Ore., after the killings.
   An estimated 200 people attended funeral services for the boys
Saturday morning at Calvary Lutheran Church in Oberon, N.D., a town
of about 200 near the Fort Totten Indian Reservation where the boys
were born. Their caskets were covered with star quilts, an Indian
funeral tradition. Their mother is a member of the Devils Lake Sioux
tribe.
   The Rev. Kevin Brown called the slayings ``a tragic injustice,''
but said Christians believe hope comes even through tragedy. Brown
said the boys were baptized at the church.
   ``The sentiment of a lot of the people around here is like they
lost someone from their family,'' he said.

   People are just mad about Harry. But
Harry the 3-week-old rhinoceros didn't seem too thrilled by all the
gawkers staring at him as he ventured into public view for the first
time at the Fort Worth Zoo.
   Harry, who seems to be mostly head and legs, stayed close to his
mother as onlookers oohed and aahed Friday when he was put on public
display for the first time.
   His mother, Ngwete, was one of 10 black rhinos flown from
Zimbabwe to the United States in July in a program aimed at
maintaining the worldwide population of the species. Harry's
successful birth was hailed as a milestone in the conservation
effort.
   ``He's getting playful now, and he think's he's a real tough
guy,'' said zoo keeper Jeanne Jacobsen, who carries photographs of
her small charge in her wallet. Although he is named after Harry
Tennison, who helped bring the black rhinos to this country, she
prefers to call him ``baby boy'' or ``little pumpkin.''
   Ms. Jacobsen said Ngwete has been very protective of her baby.
   ``When I'm in there petting him, she'll come over and push him
out of the way.''
   Although zoo officials are watching Harry closely because of his
important role in preservation of his species, zoo patrons had a
more basic fascination with the small beast.
   ``I think he's cute,'' said 4-year-old Shelby Ames, watching in
wide-eyed curiosity.

<HEAD>Mother Teresa Develops High Fever; Irregular Heartbeat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALCUTTA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa developed a
high fever and an irregular heartbeat Saturday a day after suffering
a heart attack, hospital officials said.
   Doctors said they have decided to place a temporary pacemaker to
help the ailing heart of the frail 79-year-old nun, who has
dedicated her life to the destitute and dying.
   Officials at Woodlands Nursing Home, where Mother Teresa was
admitted Tuesday, refused to elaborate or say whether they already
implanted the pacemaker. In a statement, they said the nun is not
responding to medication.
   ``Her rising temperature and irregularity of pulse is causing
anxiety,'' the statement said.
   Mother Teresa became ill Sept. 3 and was admitted to the
hospital's intensive care unit last Tuesday. She suffered a heart
attack on Friday, but doctors had said her condition had stabilized
and she was improving.
   Saturday's statement said Mother Teresa spent a ``sleepless
night'' Friday but rested throughout the day Saturday.
   It said a renowned Calcutta physician had been called for
consultations, but did not name him. Mother Teresa's cardiologist in
Rome also has been contacted and may fly to Calcutta soon, the
statement said.
   Mother Teresa was born in Yugoslavia and received several honors
for her work with the poor in this eastern Indian city, including
the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize and the U.S. Presidential Medal of
Freedom, the highest American civilian award, which former President
Reagan presented to her in 1985.
   In October 1950, Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of
Charity in an abandoned, run down hostel donated by city officials.
The order, recognized by the Vatican in 1965, now has 3,000 nuns
working in 87 countries.
   Despite heart problems and failing eyesight in recent years,
Mother Teresa traveled widely and vigorously spoke out against
abortion, an act she called ``the greatest sin a woman can commit.''

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court's decision on flag burning is
steadily fading from the forefront of public concern, but lawmakers
returning from a summer recess say it remains a political powder keg
as they deal with the matter this week.
   ``The issue that has been made such a major issue in Washington
is on the wane across the country,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.
``It is beginning to be seen in perspective now. People believe it
was overblown.''
   ``It's an abstraction to most people,'' said Rep. Phil Crane,
R-Ill. ``Who personally has ever witnessed a flag burning? ... It
does not have, except through some veterans' organizations, a
specific hard-core constituency.''
   Even so, leadership aides in both parties predict lawmakers will
move quickly this fall to pass legislation to outlaw burning and
other acts of flag desecration, if only to take the steam out of
President Bush's drive for constitutional amendment to do the same
thing.
   Top Democratic leaders in both houses back the legislative
approach, in part out of fear that outright opposition would leave
them vulnerable to criticism from Republicans in the 1990
congressional elections.
   The issue arose when the Supreme Court ruled June 21 that burning
the flag could be free speech protected by the First Amendment. That
triggered a wave of outrage, including Bush's call for a
constitutional amendment. Many veterans groups, including the
American Legion, want the change written into the Bill of Rights to
make it safe from any future court ruling.
   The House will be the first to address the issue when it takes up
a bill on Tuesday that would impose fines and up to a year in prison
for physically desecrating a flag, an approach supporters say should
be at least tried before seeking to amend the Constitution.
   Lawmakers just back to work after a month at home agreed passions
on the issue have cooled over the summer.
   ``I did not have one single person bring it up,'' said Rep. Beryl
Anthony, D-Ark.
   ``I think the momentum to build up to a constitutional amendment
has diminished substantially,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., who
held 63 meetings with constituents during August. ``A statute will
suffice. Even veterans' groups ... are telling me right now they
think a statute's sufficient.''
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who supports the amendment, agreed.
``If a statute can address the problem, that will take care of the
issue,'' she said.
   But Republicans are betting lawmakers will vote for any measure
that would protect the flag, fearing any ``no'' vote could be turned
by an opponent into a 30-second political attack ad.
   ``I'm going to support whatever comes up,'' said Rep. Claude
Harris, D-Ala. ``I'm not going to be in a situation of voting
against anything that would punish someone for violating the flag,
whether it be a statute or a constitutional amendment.''
   ``My sense is that people are concerned that Republicans will use
the issue in the same unprincipled but politically effective way in
which they used the Pledge'' of Allegiance against Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis last year, said Rep. Ted Weiss,
D-N.Y.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, already has
promised a vote on legislation as well as the amendment in October.
And late last week, House Democratic leaders were discussing a
similar agreement with Republicans.
   Democratic sources said leaders in the majority were prepared to
allow a House vote on a constitutional amendment sometime after the
Senate acts on it if Republicans would support the statutory measure
that comes to the floor Tuesday.
   The measure was tentatively scheduled to be brought up under an
expedited process normally reserved for non-controversial bills.
That means it would require a two-thirds majority to pass.
   Opponents of the constitutional amendment, including House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., apparently are gambling passage of
statutory flag protection will defuse the issue _ and indeed, many
lawmakers said that's exactly what they heard back home.
   ``They (constituents) want to stop the burning of the American
flag, and they don't care how we do it up there in Congress,'' said
Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., a primary sponsor of the
constitutional amendment.

<HEAD>Doctors Condemn Shooting of Children; Violence Continues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors in Cape Town said they
have treated children as young as four years old with gunshot
wounds, which relatives said were inflicted by police during
election violence.
   Police said Saturday they used pistols, birdshot, rubber bullets
and tear gas to disperse mobs overnight and Saturday morning in
mixed-race townships near Cape Town, where violence has been
reported since Wednesday's elections. The elections excluded South
Africa's 28 million black majority.
   Also Saturday, the National Union of Mineworkers said three black
mineworkers were shot to death by private security guards in a
protest related to the elections. Mine owners said the workers
attacked the guards.
   ``It is extremely saddening to find children caught up in the
firing line,'' said Dr. David Bass, head of the Red Cross Children's
Hospital Trauma Unit. He said 10 children, aged four to 12, had been
treated there for birdshot or buckshot wounds on election day.
   Bass was one of 75 Cape Town area doctors who issued a statement
late Friday describing the injuries to children as ``barbaric and
stomach-turning.''
   Police issue daily unrest reports, which give few details, but
their extensive listing of more than 300 incidents from Wednesday
through Friday do not refer to any children being hurt by police
action.
   ``To apportion blame without being there is very difficult, but
to have buckshot and birdshot fired into crowds where there were
women and children present points to questionable responsibility,''
Bass said.
   Relatives of injured children have alleged that police shot them.
   He described some of his patients in an interview with the
independent South African Press Association.
   ``One of them, a four-year-old girl, has birdshot inside her
skull. Another eight-year-old girl has an eye injury and wounds to
her limbs and trunk. A 12-year-old boy was shot in the leg, foot and
buttocks,'' said Bass.
   The Ministry of Law and Order has disputed the claims of
anti-apartheid activists, clerics, doctors, journalists and township
residents who have reported indiscriminate police firing in the Cape
Town area during elections for parliamentary seats reserved for
whites, mixed-race and Asians. Blacks have no voice in national
affairs.
   Cape Town attorney Essa Moosa said Friday that 29 people were
killed on election night. He was referring to reports from
mortuaries, doctors, relatives and an ambulanceman.
   Most were killed by police, Moosa said, but some were involved in
factional fighting which he and other activists said was instigated
by police.
   Police have not acknowledged killing anyone, although they say 15
people died and 26 policemen were injured. They have reported only a
handful of civilian injuries from police shootings on election day,
while Cape Town activists and doctors have reported up to 200.
   On Saturday, police said in a statement that they fired pistols,
birdshot, rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse stone-throwers who
damaged vehicles in four mixed-race townships overnight and Saturday
morning. Pistols with live ammunition sometimes are used to fire
warning shots.
   ``No injuries were reported as a result of police action'' since
Wednesday, said the statement.
   One mixed-race man was hurt in a stoning incident, and four were
arrested for stoning a delivery vehicle, the statement said.
   In Johannesburg, meanwhile, the General Mining Union Corp. said
three people were killed and 11 injured Friday night when a crowd
armed with sharpened sticks and knives attacked security guards at a
workers hostel at Kinross gold mine in Evander, 60 miles east of
Johannesburg.
   But the National Union of Mineworkers said the company ``used
live bullets to intimidate union members who had been involved in
protest action against the general election, and management were
using mine security to assault workers'' taking part in a nationwide
work stoppage.
   The union said security guards opened fire on workers who wanted
to ask them to stop the assaults, killing the three.

<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat will fly to
New York to call on the U.N. General Assembly to convene an
international peace conference on the Middle East, a newspaper
quoted him Saturday as saying.
   Last year, Washington denied Arafat a visa, prompting the world
body to move to Geneva to hear the Palestinian leader.
   ``I am going to New York to discuss the convening of the
international conference'' on Middle East peace, Arafat was quoted
as telling the daily newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat.
   Arafat appeared confident he will be allowed to enter the United
States to address the United Nations later this month.
   Mark Dillen, a State Department spokesman, said Saturday that
``as far as we know he has made no visa application.''
   On Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told reporters
after a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III that his
government would view issuance of a U.S. visa to Arafat ``very
gravely.''
   During last year's session in Geneva, the 60-year-old Arafat
openly renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist,
encouraging the United States to end a 13-year ban on dealings with
the Palestine Liberation Organization and to begin a dialogue with
the movement.
   Asharq Al-Awsat said it interviewed the Palestinian leader in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia, this week during a summit of 102 non-aligned
nations. He said he was ``heading to New York with the leaders of
the nine states who met on sidelines of the non-aligned summit
conference ... to discuss the international peace conference with
the U.N. secretary-general and the permanent members of the Security
Council.''
   Egypt is spearheading Arab efforts to persuade Washington not to
block Arafat's intended visit, despite pressures by Israel.
Palestinian sources have said Arafat would offer new peace proposals
in his address.
   Arafat told Asharq Al-Awsat that convening an international
conference as envisaged by Arab leaders ``is not going to be easy as
some might think, because nothing comes on a silver platter.''
   He said he discussed the issue with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar at the Belgrade summit that ended Friday.
   Arafat charged the United States is proving ``intransigent'' in
the peace process by ignoring Arab proposals and supporting only
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's election plan.
   A Palestinian uprising, funded and largely directed by the PLO,
has been under way in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for 21 months,
resulting in the deaths of more than 550 Palestinians and more than
35 Israelis.
   The PLO has rejected Shamir's proposal for elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to allow Palestinians to choose
their own representatives to negotiate with Israel. Arafat insists
on an Israeli withdrawal from the territories and international
supervision of these elections.
   But Arafat said he has detected ``positive indicators on the
horizon'' because President Bush has referred to the need to end the
Israeli occupation and Secretary of State James A. Baker III has
spoken of ``something similar.''

   A child's balloon knocked out power to
two of Rhode Island's largest hospitals for up to 40 minutes
Saturday, forcing surgeons to operate by flashlight and nurses to
help intensive-care patients breathe by hand.
   Emergency generators that normally would kick in within one
minute of a power failure at Rhode Island Hospital failed to work
for unknown reasons, said hospital spokesman Rick Piester.
   The neighboring Women &amp; Infants Hospital, which is on Rhode
Island Hospital's electrical system, also was without power for
several minutes until its own generator started, said spokesman
Robert Ball.
   ``It was a period of no little panic,'' Ball said. ``We've never
lost power before.''
   A balloon with an aluminum foil streamer got loose from a
waterfront festival being held on Narragansett Electric Co. property
and drifted upward into a transformer that serves the two hospitals,
causing a short circuit but no permanent damage, said Charles F.
Moran, a utility spokesman.
   Although the festival's organizers had been coached about safety,
``we never anticipated anybody would bring in balloons with aluminum
trailers on them,'' Moran said. All such balloons _ which were being
given away by a restaurant running a food booth _ were hunted down
and destroyed after the power failure, he said.
   Two patients were in operating rooms at Rhode Island Hospital
when the power went off. Surgery on one had not yet begun, and the
other patient, who was on local anesthesia, remained awake while his
operation was finished by flashlight, Piester said.
   At Women &amp; Infants, a surgeon completed a Caesarean section by
flashlight and mother and child were doing fine, Ball said.
   About 40 intensive-care patients on respirators were respirated
by hand, with nurses using bags to force air into their lungs,
Piester said. Some emergency room patients were taken to a lobby so
their condition could be monitored in sunlight, he said.
   Nurses also helped premature infants breathe by hand at Women &amp;
Infants, said Ball. Women &amp; Infants, which specializes in obstetrics
and gynecological procedures, had 110 adults and about 170 infants
Saturday. The number of premature infants on respirators was not
immediately available.
   One emergency room patient at Rhode Island Hospital was
transferred elsewhere, ambulances were warned away by radio, and the
hospital was preparing to transfer some of its other 575 inpatients
when the power came back on, Piester said.
   Narragansett Electric said power was restored 25 minutes after it
went off, but Piester said it was 40 minutes before Rhode Island
Hospital's power was fully restored.
   Deputy Fire Chief Frederick Miller said all five of the city's
ambulances stood by to transfer patients, and nearby cities were
warned to expect calls for help.
   Miller said the fire department had never practiced coping with a
hospital blackout, and Ball said there had never been any drills at
the hospital to practice for total power outages.
   ``What happened today is the thing that would never happen,''
Ball said.

   A paraplegic rock 'n' roll musician who
alleged that the popular rock club the Troubadour refused to book
his act has filed a discrimination complaint with the state.
   ``They told me they'd heard I had a following of 50 wheelchair
groupies coming to watch me perform and they couldn't have that
stampede,'' Dorik Perman said. He complained to the state Department
of Fair Employment and Housing.
   Perman, 34, has been disabled since childhood by muscular
dystrophy. But he has earned favorable reviews as a rock 'n' roller,
playing such Los Angeles clubs as the Roxy, Gazzarri's and Club
Lingerie.
   Troubadour officials denied they discriminated against Perman.
   ``He does not have a following, and those who don't, we don't
book. That's just business,'' said Gina Barsamian, who is in charge
of bookings for the club. She added that the club has no ramp or
room for wheelchairs on stage, so ``This would be for his own
safety, too.''

<TEXT>
   Six months ago Mayor Edward I. Koch was an
anyone-can-beat-him underdog. Now he's a comeback-of-the-year
contender in his quest for an unprecedented fourth term.
   Polls have the three-term incumbent running nearly even with his
prime opponent, Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, in
Tuesday's Democratic primary. Strategists on both sides said their
ability to turn out voters would decide the election.
   ``I think it's going to be very, very close,'' said David Garth,
Koch's political and media adviser. Asked his plans for last-minute
appeals, he joked: ``We're going to ask the people to join us in
prayer.''
   ``It's neck and neck. I don't think you can ever count out an
incumbent who has been in office as long as Ed Koch,'' said Bill
Lynch, Dinkins' campaign manager. He claimed a slight lead,
confirmed by most polls.
   The latest survey, conducted Wednesday and Thursday by WABC-TV
and the Daily News, found 49 percent support for Dinkins and 42
percent for Koch. But the margin of error for that poll was six
points, and previous polls showed the race within the margin of
error.
   Koch, reacting to the latest poll results, declared: ``A big
turnout, I win.'' But he also expressed more anxiety about this race
than any other in his career.
   Meanwhile, he presides over a troubled city.
   When Koch was elected to his third term in 1985, only a handful
of investigators were aware of city corruption scandals about to
break open. Crack was virtually unknown. The full devastation of the
AIDS epidemic was not yet generally apparent. There were fewer
homeless people. Crime rates had not hit the historic levels they're
at now.
   The Democratic primary is about all those issues, said Rep.
Thomas Manton, Democratic leader of the borough of Queens and a new
Koch supporter. ``But more than anything, it's a question of the
incumbent and his record.''
   Whatever the primary's outcome, it will make history. Dinkins
would be the first black man nominated by a major party for mayor in
New York; Koch would be the first mayor nominated for a fourth term.
   The Democratic nomination usually means election, because there
are five Democrats here for each Republican. But Rudolph W.
Giuliani, a popular former federal prosecutor, is front runner for
the GOP nomination and could mount a creditable challenge in the
Nov. 7 general election.
   Attention for the moment was riveted on the Democratic race, a
contest of style as much as substance between the reserved,
unflappable Dinkins and the outspoken, occasionally outrageous Koch.
   But while he trailed badly in early polls, Koch appears to have
regained many of the voters who had left him for the now-faltering
candidacy of city Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin. Goldin and a
fourth candidate, former transit chief Richard Ravitch, trail the
leaders badly, as does Giuliani's only challenger in the Republican
primary, cosmetics company heir Ronald Lauder.
   ``Koch's campaign has been focused on his record. His TV ads are
about what Ed Koch has done,'' said Lee Miringoff, pollster at the
Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. ``The net effect of
that seems to be to have driven down his negative rating somewhat.''
   Dinkins got help last weekend from Jesse Jackson, who got 45
percent of the New York City vote in last year's Democratic
presidential primary. Jackson came back ``to energize our support,''
said Lynch, but he has not played a major role because of his
negative appraisal by many Jews, another important voting group.
   Jews may make up 25 percent of the Democratic vote; blacks, up to
a third. Koch himself is Jewish.
   The greatest energizer of the black vote may prove to be the Aug.
23 killing of a black youth, Yusuf Hawkins, by a white gang in
Bensonhurst. Koch drew sharp criticism by suggesting protest marches
after the killing had exacerbated racial tensions.
   ``It's my feeling the Bensonhurst thing has hurt us,'' Garth
said, by motivating blacks in Brooklyn to vote. ``Bensonhurst has
upstaged, for at least the last two weeks, every other issue.''
   Even before the killing, Dinkins stressed harmony and
conciliation as his campaign themes, and since then he has
maintained a soothing response. However, some analysts have
suggested that the protests by militant black activists may give
Koch a white backlash vote.
   Said Lynch: ``I can make an argument for it hurting, or helping.''
   Certain help for Dinkins will come from a major get-out-the-vote
effort on his behalf by most of the city's largest unions, including
teachers, municipal employees and Teamsters.
   About 5,000 union volunteers will make telephone calls, hand out
literature and carry signboards urging votes for Dinkins on primary
day, said Brian McLaughlin of the Central Labor Council of the
AFL-CIO. He called the coordinated effort unprecedented.
   Koch, with less union support and fewer volunteers of his own, is
unlikely to approach Dinkins' strength on the streets. Koch's aides
express concern on this point, and Dinkins' campaign manager called
it crucial.
   ``In a race that's neck and neck,'' Lynch said, ``turnout is
going to be the issue.''

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's most prominent human
rights activist has appealed to Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki and leading Hungarian reformer Imre Pozsgay to help free
two Slovak activists.
   In an open letter, Vaclav Havel told Mazowiecki and Pozsgay that
they might well be in jail rather than in leading positions if they
lived in today's Czechoslovakia. He begged them to speak out for Jan
Carnogursky and Miroslav Kusy.
   The two were arrested last month and could face up to 10 years in
jail if convicted on subversion charges. They were arrested for
signing a document calling for a silent protest on the anniversary
of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed reforms in Prague.
   ``I cannot imagine that the efforts of your countries to create a
democratic and pluralistic society could be permanently successful
if Czechoslovakia were to remain stuck between Poland and Hungary
like a dark wedge, a country which ... imprisons probably more
critics of its leadership than in (late Soviet President Leonid I.)
Brezhnev's time,'' he wrote.
   Havel's letter was written Friday and made available by the
London-based emigre publishing house Palach Press.
   Havel, who was jailed for four months earlier this year, compared
Kusy, a former senior Communist Party official, to Pozsgay. He
likened Carnogursky, a leading Roman Catholic lay activist, to
Poland's new non-Communist premier.
   To Mazowiecki, the playwright noted that ``if the situation in
Czechoslovakia developed toward democracy, it cannot be ruled out
that one day, Jan Carnogursky might be holding the same post with
which you have been entrusted in Poland.''
   Both Carnogursky and Kusy repeatedly have been harassed and
detained for their role as Charter 77 human rights activists.
   Hungary and Poland have embraced democratic reform while
Czechoslovakia has resisted change.

   Separatist guerrillas raided a remote
border village in northeastern India and killed 12 people, Press
Trust of India reported Saturday.
   Friday night's attack by militants of the Bodo tribe also left at
least 27 people injured in the village of Bokajali in Assam state,
the news agency said. The village is about 800 miles east of New
Delhi.
   The agency said all the victims were native Assamese whose houses
were burned in the raid.
   The latest deaths bring to 20 the number of people killed in the
past week by Bodo guerrillas fighting for a separate homeland in
Assam, a hilly state bordering Bangladesh and Bhutan.
   Police are searching nearby forests where the attackers are
believed to have fled, Press Trust said.
   Bodo militants pressed their demands for more than 20 years, then
took up arms two years ago. At least 270 people have been killed in
the violence this year.
   The government refuses to consider their tribal demand, but held
unsuccessful peace talks last year with militants who allege they
are discriminated against by the state's majority Assamese people.
   Bodos are mostly farmers who were animists before they converted
earlier this century to Christianity and Hindusim, India's dominant
religion. They are 30 percent of Assam's 20 million people.

   Three days of talks between Ethiopia and Eritrean
rebels have convinced each side that the other sincerely wants to
end their 28-year war, former President Jimmy Carter said Saturday.
   ``I don't really see a major obstacle now,'' Carter, a neutral
observer in the talks between Ethiopia's Marxist government and the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front, told reporters.
   Carter said negotiators had agreed on 13 items during discussions
aimed at setting an agenda for future, more substantiative, peace
talks. He would not elaborate but said a statement with more details
would be issued after the talks end, probably Sunday or Monday.
   Carter also announced he plans to travel to Nicaragua later this
month and again around year's end to examine preparations for that
country's national elections. He went to Panama earlier this year to
observe the national voting there, and accused the Noriega
government of stealing the election.
   Since 1961, the Ethiopian government and rebels have been
fighting over the independence of the province of Eritrea, a former
Italian colony that has Ethiopia's only direct access to the Red
Sea. An estimated 1 million people have died in the war and related
famine.
   ``I think each side, when I began talking to them, was totally
convinced that all the other side wanted to do was have a propaganda
victory of some kind,'' Carter said.
   ``And now, after these hours of communicating with each other,
making concessions to each agreement, I don't think there's any
doubt that they both know that the other side really is sincere in
trying to make progress toward peace,'' he said.
   He said the leaders of the delegations here frequently have
called Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam and the liberation
front's general secretary, Isaias Afwerki, for guidance. The
delegation representatives were not on hand with Carter at
Saturday's briefing, but Carter said they would participate in a
news conference at the conclusion of the talks.
   Carter, who is participating in the talks as a private citizen,
said he has notified the State Department of the progress of the
discussions. He said he also has been in contact with the Soviet
Union, which supports the Ethiopian government. He would not comment
on the U.S. or Soviet response.
   The talks are being held at the Carter Center. Opened in 1986,
the center houses the presidential libaray, a museum, a think tank
and organizations dedicated to peace, public health and other issues.
   Carter, who as president a decade ago helped Egypt and Israel
negotiate the historic Camp David accords, said his role in the
Ethiopia talks has occasionally been frustrating.
   ``The thing that's frustrating to me as a mediator is the
time-consuming exchange of ideas, the repetition and so forth,'' he
said. ``What I do is I listen to each side, let them debate one
another, maybe recess for a few minutes. I go up to my word
processor and type out what I think is an acceptable compromise. I
come back and present this to the chairman and the whole group and
let them, hopefully, discuss my papers instead of their previous
original proposals.''

<HEAD>Catholic Primate Cancels Trip To United States</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with reaction from Jewish, Polish groups in Chicago.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic primate Jozef Glemp, who has
been at the center of a dispute over a convent at the Auschwitz
death camp, has canceled a planned trip to the United States, the
state news agency reported Saturday.
   The PAP agency said the leader of Poland's Catholic Church is
postponing his visit because of ``circumstances not favorable'' for
the trip. It did not refer to the controversy over the convent.
   The primate has been at the center of the dispute over the
presence of Carmelite nuns at the site of the Nazi death camp. The
convent is in a former warehouse just outside the camp site.
   Glemp was to visit Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Detroit,
Washington and Boston beginning Sept. 21.
   The Polish church did not meet a Feb. 22 deadline to move the
convent to an interfaith center as agreed under a 1987 accord
reached by Catholic and Jewish leaders.
   Many Jews and others view the nuns' presence as an offensive
intrusion of Christian symbols at a place where 2.5 million Jews
were murdered by the Nazis during World War II.
   Glemp's efforts to calm the dispute, which has brought protesters
to the convent, backfired when he said the pact should be
renegotiated. He also said in an Aug. 26 sermon that Polish
anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews would abandon anti-Polish
sentiments.
   Glemp also angered many by suggesting Jews helped spread
communism, and by mentioning that some collaborated with Nazis
during World War II.
   The primate and a Polish church commission have urged more talks
without preconditions to resolve the future of the convent.
   Efforts to move the convent have found little sympathy among many
Poles, who say 1.5 million Christians also were killed at the site.
   In Chicago, leaders of the Polish and Jewish communities praised
Glemp's decision to call off the trip. Jewish leaders said remarks
made by Glemp about the convent had strained relations to the
breaking point.
   Michael Kotzin, director of the Jewish Community Relations
Council, said in a telephone interview, ``Now we in this community
have the opportunity for quiet attempts to deal with tensions in
Polish-Jewish and Catholic-Jewish relations.''
   Chicago Alderman Roman Pucinski, head of the Illinois division of
the Polish-American Congress, also praised Glemp for his decision.
   ``In view of the worldwide controversy that the Auschwitz camp
has developed into, I'm sure that the cardinal is doing a very wise
thing,'' Pucinski said in a telephone interview. ``It's an explosive
situation.''

<TEXT>
   East German leader Erich Honecker is
weak but recovering in a hospital from successful gallbladder
surgery, a West German magazine reported Saturday.
   The Hamburg-based Der Spiegel, quoting unidentified sources in
East Berlin, said the Communist leader was being treated in a
hospital outside his country's capital.
   The report contradicted recent reports from state-run East German
media that the 77-year-old Honecker had been released from the
hospital and was recovering at home after the surgery.
   Spiegel also said doctors are concerned about the condition of
Honecker's liver and a kidney. It did not elaborate.
   East German reports have not elaborated on Honecker's medical
problems. Previous Western news reports have speculated the
hard-line Communist leader was suffering from cancer.
   In its report, Spiegel said Honecker ``will eventually be able to
return to work but will not regain his previous energy.''
   West German officials have said Honecker's illness has hampered
efforts to resolve a diplomatic crisis over a flood of East Germans
seeking to emigrate to the West. Most of them are in Hungary
awaiting permission to travel into Austria.

<HEAD>India Agrees to Withdraw Troops From Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India has agreed to withdraw its
peacekeeping troops from Sri Lanka by end of the year, a senior
government official said Saturday.
   Sri Lankan officials have been trying for months to obtain the
withdrawal of the troops, who were sent to this island nation two
years ago to quell ethnic violence.
   An agreement on the new withdrawal date, Dec. 31, was reached by
Indian and Sri Lankan officials during a meeting of non-aligned
nations in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the official said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said Friday in New Delhi that
an agreement had been reached on the pullout of the estimated 42,000
Indian soldiers from Sri Lanka's northeast. But he refused to give
details.
   Gandhi held at least two meetings in Belgrade with Sri Lankan
Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne. The Sri Lankan official said
Wijeratne apprised President Ranasinghe Premadasa of the Indian
proposals.
   India had earlier proposed a withdrawal by the end of February.
Sri Lanka rejected the date, triggering a dilplomatic deadlock.
   The official said Premadasa will consult his ministers on the new
proposal on Wednesday. The government was ``very likely'' to approve
the December withdrawal, the official said.
   India sent its troops under a peace accord it had sponsored to
end a Tamil insurrection for an independent nation in Sri Lanka's
northeast. The accord, signed on July 29, 1987, offered Tamils
limited autonomy if rebel groups surrendered their weapons.
   While most militias abided by the accord, the dominant rebel
group reneged on the pact and began attacking Indian troops. India
despatched more soldiers to put down attacks by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam but the fighting continued and at least 1,000
Indian soldiers have been killed.
   In June, Premadasa asked India to withdraw all its troops by July
29. Gandhi refused, saying a hasty pullout would lead to even more
bloodshed.
   A military showdown between the two countries, however, was
averted when India agreed to make a token pullout on July 29 and
subsequent limited withdrawals. But the two countries failed to
agree on a timetable for the complete withdrawal.
   Premadasa asked for the withdrawal to appease Sinhalese radicals
in the south who had launched a campaign of assassinations and
terror to protest the accord and the presence of Indian troops. The
militants say the Indians compromise the country's independence, and
they say the accord made too many concessions to the Tamils.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. They
claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who make
up 75 percent of the population and control the government and
military.
   India got involved because of the sympathies of its own 60
million Tamils for the rebel cause.
   At least 10,000 people have died in the 6-year-old Tamil war.
Officials say at least 5,000 have died in the 2-year-old uprising by
the Sinhalese militants.
   In a bid to end the violence, Premadasa has called a meeting of
all political parties on Wednesday and also invited militant
leaders. They have not said if they will come, however.
   On Friday, security forces killed eight Sinhalese radicals across
the Sinhalese heartland, the government said.
   Elsewhere, a Sinhalese police constable and a woman were shot to
death by the extremists in southern Sri Lanka, and more than 235
suspected radicals were arrested, the government said.

<TEXT>
   Troops battled supporters of a former
mayor suspected in the slaying of an election official, and three
bystanders were killed, the military said Saturday.
   The former mayor was arrested after the shootout Friday in the
town of Bacolod Grande in Lanao del Sur province, 510 miles south of
Manila.
   Lt. Col. Omar Manabilang, Philippine Constabulary provincial
commander, said that in addition to the three slain bystanders,
seven people were wounded. He said the wounded included four of the
ex-mayor's bodyguards.
   The fighting broke out when the soldiers went to the home of
Dimangadap Dipatuan to serve a warrant for his arrest in the
February slaying in Manila of Vicente Gerochi, an election
commission official, the commander said.
   Gerochi was in charge of nationwide village elections, which were
held in March. He was gunned down by unknown assailants near his
Manila home a few weeks before the balloting.
   Manabilang told reporters Dipatuan's bodyguards and about 50
other supporters opened fire, touching off the 25-minute gun battle.
The mayor's defenders fled after military reinforcements arrived.
   Soldiers then arrested Dipatuan, a former mayor of Kalawi, a
small town near Bacolod Grande, the commander said.
   Also Saturday, the military said soldiers arrested eight ranking
Communist leaders, including a Roman Catholic priest, in raids in
the central city of Cebu.
   The Communists have been fighting for nearly 21 years to
establish a Marxist government in the Philippines.
   A report from the Philippine Constabulary headquarters in Manila
said the arrests were made Wednesday and Thursday in Cebu city,
about 360 miles southeast of Manila.
   Those arrested include Federico Guanzon, an alternate member of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines.

   Boris N. Yeltsin, the gadfly in Mikhail
Gorbachev's ointment, arrived Saturday for his first visit to the
United States _ a two-week national tour featuring the Soviet
political maverick's views on glasnost and government.
   ``I want to see the Washington Monument, Library of Congress and
other cultural treasures of the United States,'' Yeltsin said at an
impromptu news conference at Kennedy International Airport.
   ``I also want to meet with you. ... I'm meeting with businessmen,
politicians and universities,'' Yeltsin said through a translator.
``It's a good opportunity to visit your country.''
   Yeltsin, wearing a blue suit with a Soviet flag on the lapel, was
presented with a bouquet of roses upon his arrival by
representatives of the Esalen Institute, which invited him as part
of its Soviet-American exchange program.
   As he moved through the airport, Yeltsin got a taste of Western
life _ a greeting from a Hare Krishna follower who gave him two
books and two roses.
   ``It's kind of a little thanks for the changes in the Soviet
Union,'' said David Jakupko, director of Soviet affairs for the Hare
Krishnas worldwide.
   The visit brings Gorbachev's most vocal critic to the U.S. and
caps Yeltsin's comeback from political outcast to populist hero.
   ``He's in a class by himself. He has an enormous vitality. He's
an iconoclast ... He's become a symbol of resentment against party
bureaucrats,'' said Marshall Shulman, an adviser to Carter
administration Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and a Soviet expert.
   On Monday, he is to deliver a luncheon address to the Council on
Foreign Relations, followed by an evening speech at Columbia
University.
   ``We expect Boris will be on `Good Evening America' or `Good
Morning America' _ whatever it is,'' said Yeltsin's chief aide, Lev
Sukhanov.
   Two years ago, Yeltsin was booted from his post as Moscow's
Communist Party chief after he criticized the slow pace of reform
under Gorbachev.
   But Yeltsin thrived after his dismissal. He campaigned for a seat
in the Soviet Congress, and in March was swept into office with more
than 90 percent of the popular vote in the first contested Soviet
election since 1917. He now heads the Soviet Union's radical bloc of
legislators.
   Yeltsin, 58, through an intermediary, sent word earlier this year
to the Leigh Bureau in Princeton, N.J., that he was interested in
coming to the United States, said Bill Leigh, head of the speakers
agency.
   An invitation was extended via Esalen and the final details
worked out the first week in August, Leigh said. Yeltsin's visit may
also have a capitalist purpose: Yeltsin has a book deal with a U.S.
publisher, Shulman said, although Yeltsin plans to donate his
speaking fees to a Soviet fund to fight AIDS and said he hoped to
visit AIDS clinics.
   Yeltsin is scheduled to leave Sept. 23; in the meantime, he'll
stay busy.
   Appearances have already been announced in New York,
Philadelphia, Chicago, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Dallas,
Miami and Washington, although Leigh said his exact schedule was not
set.
   It's not clear if Yeltsin plans to criticize Gorbachev during his
visit _ Leigh would only say his Columbia speech concerned ``the
future of Soviet democracy.''
   Shulman believes Yeltsin will tread lightly when it comes to
criticizing the Soviet leader while in this country.
   ``He is conscious of the fact that Gorbachev is in a difficult
position. He supports Gorbachev, but he would like Gorbachev to move
along more quickly with reform,'' Shulman said.
   ``My guess is he will be constrained in his criticism, but it's
hard to predict. He's a mercurial man.''

<HEAD>Oil Spill Gave Alaska Governor National Spotlight, But Future Uncertain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Steve Cowper got his first word about
the nation's worst oil spill while he was telling an interviewer
that he had decided not to run for re-election.
   Since then, he's had little time to think about life beyond the
governor's mansion.
   Cowper announced his decision March 24, coincidentally the same
day the tanker Exxon Valdez ripped its hull open on a reef and
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into
Prince William Sound.
   The disaster has defined his political life ever since.
   In recent weeks, Cowper has been lobbying Congress and seeking
support from other governors for federal laws to improve the
nation's response to major oil spills.
   ``The major thing that we've learned as a result of the spill is
that this nation doesn't have the capability of cleaning up an oil
spill as big as this one,'' he said.
   Cowper would like to see the Coast Guard put in absolute charge
of any oil spill larger than 12,000 barrels, a national inventory of
spill equipment including some Soviet-class oil-skimming vessels,
and a trained corps of spill experts who can respond quickly.
   ``Speed is of the essence when you're responding to an oil spill
and you're standing around trying to figure out where the equipment
is,'' he said. ``An oil spill can get out of hand pretty quickly.
That's what happened in Prince William Sound.''
   The spill gave Cowper the kind of national exposure coveted by
any ambitious politician, and his frequent appearances on national
TV led to rumors that he was training his sites on a seat in
Congress. He has not ruled that out, but in a recent interview he
said he will take a long leave from politics when his four-year term
expires next year.
   ``I may come back for another try for elective office, but if I
do, I expect it will be years from now,'' said Cowper, who was due
back in the state during the weekend after a 10-day good will trip
to Siberia.
   ``If I had to make the decision right now, I'd say I'd never be
interested in going to Washington,'' he said. ``My impression is
that people don't enjoy those jobs anymore. They have to spend half
their time in useless activity and a lot of what's left over is
directed toward raising money.''
   Cowper, 50, moved to Alaska in 1968 but still speaks with the
distinctive drawl of his native Virginia. He worked as an attorney,
prosecutor, businessman, newspaper reporter, research diver,
arbitrator, state lobbyist and served two terms in the Alaska House
in the late 1970s. He was elected governor in 1986 after defeating
incumbent Gov. William Sheffield in the Democratic primary.
   Despite his varied career, many were surprised by his decision to
look for a new job in 1990.
   ``Actually, I have never even remotely considered running for a
second term,'' he said. ``I always did think that I was going to
serve for four years and step down. I was persuaded not to mention
it _ not till March.''
   At times the stress of being governor of this vast, oil-dependent
state has been evident on Cowper, who concedes: ``I don't have much
of a poker face.
   ``If I've looked anxious from time to time it's because Alaska's
gone through some very hard experiences while I've been in office.
   ``The economy had crashed, the government appeared to be in
crisis, the budget was in severe imbalance, we had an assortment of
emergencies including the oil spill. I had an organization in the

<HEAD>Say Metal Fatigue Might Have Caused Plane Crash that Killed 55</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aviation specialists said Saturday
that metal fatigue might have caused the crash of a Norwegian
charter plane that plunged into the North Sea, killing all 55 people
aboard.
   The twin-engine CV-580 Convair turboprop was flying from Norway
to West Germany when it vanished from radar screens Friday and
crashed 18.5 miles north of the Danish fishing port of Hirtshals.
Whatever occurred happened so quickly the pilots had no time to send
a distress signal, according to investigators.
   Tommy Jensen, head of the Danish crash investigation team, was
quoted by the Norwegian NTB news agency as saying ``so far no burns
or other damage on bodies or wreckage has been found to indicate an
explosives blast. Bodies and wreckage were found within a
concentrated area whereas midair explosions usually scatter them.''
   Some victims were found still strapped in their seats that had
torn loose from the fuselage, he said.
   In Norway, political parties canceled the rest of the campaign
for national elections in mourning for the crash victims but the
balloting will be held Monday as scheduled.
   Rolf Grimsrud of Norway's Civil Aviation Board said parts of the
plane might have been ripped apart when cabin pressure dropped as
the craft arrived at its cruising altitude of about 23,000 feet. The
cause could have been metal fatigue in some section, he said,
indicating a bomb explosion was seen as unlikely though not ruled
out.
   All 50 passengers were employees of the Wilhelmsen Lines shipping
company of Oslo. They had been chosen by lottery for the free trip
to Hamburg, West Germany, to see a ship christened. The plane had a
crew of five.
   Officials initially said all of the victims were Norwegians. But
a company list, which reported there were 38 men and 17 women
aboard, said three of the women had British passports and were
living in Norway.
   Rescue officials reported late Saturday that 31 bodies had been
recovered and it was presumed the others were trapped in the
wreckage. They had reported Friday that 32 bodies had been found but
lowered that figures as the remains were brought ashore.
   The U.S.-built plane belonged to the Norwegian Partnair charter
airline company. The 35-year old aircraft had recently undergone a
major maintenance checkup in Canada, the airline said.
   Flight Supervisor Karl Andersen at Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport
was quoted by Danish radio as saying parts of the plane might have
broken off in flight. ``The radar signal disappeared very suddenly
from our screens, and the plane went down fast,'' he said.
   No other flights or flying objects were spotted on flight control
radar screens at the time, discounting the possibility of a
collision or the craft had been shot down, Andersen added.
   Officials said a fishing trawler participating in the search
received a sonar echo that could have been from the wreckage but
West German navy divers could not confirm that because of poor
visibility at the 90-yard depth.
   A Norwegian vessel with minisubmarines was on its way to the area
to help locate the wreckage, including the flight recorders,
according to officials.
   They said the effort to recover all of the bodies and complete
the salvage operation could take up to two weeks.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, resuming command
after his summer vacation, on Saturday dismissed warnings of
impending chaos and assured Soviets his reforms are on track.
   Looking rested and slightly tanned, Gorbachev covered a wide
range of national issues in a half-hour speech on the nightly
television news program Vremya, including strikes, crime, shortages
and the need for ``the consolidation of all progressive forces'' to
further his reforms.
   He skirted the ethnic conflicts that are plaguing the Soviet
Union, and did not mention the recent Central Committee attack on
separatists in the Baltic republics or the weeklong strike in the
southern republic of Azerbaijan.
   ``Intimidation about impending chaos, and speculation about the
threat of a coup, even a civil war, can be heard,'' Gorbachev said.
``It's a fact that someone wants to create in society an atmosphere
of anxiety, hopelessness and insecurity.''
   But, Gorbachev assured viewers, ``We are building up and
deepening the changes that we started, and they will bring results.''
   Gorbachev last was seen in public in early August, and he was
presumed to be on vacation until this week. But an official Soviet
spokesman said the president was involved in a stinging Central
Committee statement on the Baltic republics two weeks ago warning
Baltic residents about nationalists who were going too far and
leading them into an abyss.
   Gorbachev also reportedly consulted by telephone at the time with
Lithuanian party chief Algirdas Brazauskas.
   On the explosive ethnic conflicts, Gorbachev said only that they
would be discussed at a plenum of the policy-setting Central
Committee. The plenum is expected this week or next week at the
latest, and Tass reported Saturday night that the ruling Politburo
met Friday and discussed ethnic issues to prepare for it.
   Gorbachev warned Saturday that strikes can have ``dangerous
consequences for society,'' and ``we should not tolerate the huge
economic losses'' they create.
   Hundreds of thousands of Soviet coal miners went on strike in
July to demand better conditions, and many workers in the southern
republic of Azerbaijan were on strike all this week to press for
control of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   On crime, Gorbachev called for ``the strictest order'' in cities
and towns, and he praised informal crime-fighting groups.
   He said the government has to answer for shortages that steadily
have worsened in the last year, including such staples as sugar,
tea, butter and meat.
   Gorbachev warned that some measures taken to fix the economy
``might be unpopular, tough in some ways and painful to a certain
extent.''
   He defended the Communist Party, which has been under fire for
reacting too slowly to changes in Soviet society. He said the party
was ``overcoming its dogmatism and conservatism.''
   ``Those who hope to take advantage of difficulties of the period
of transition for some unsavory purposes and try to undermine the
party's influence should know that this will not work,'' he said.
   As he often has before, Gorbachev called for a middle road
between radicals who want to effect changes too fast and
conservatives who hope for a return to the past.

   About 50 AIDS activists disrupted opening
night of the San Francisco Opera, chanting, ``You have the power to
stop AIDS now.'' But an opera spokesman said the protest was
misdirected.
   ``The audience that these people irritated are the people who are
paying for AIDS benefits in San Francisco. It was the wrong audience
to do this in front of,'' Tom Illgen, the opera's marketing
director, said after Friday night's demonstration.
   The protesters were members of the group Stop AIDS Now or Else,
also known as SANE. Members of the same group blocked off the Golden
Gate Bridge during rush hour for about 45 minutes on Jan. 31 before
being arrested. Police made no arrests Friday night.
   Shortly after the conductor took his place and the orchestra
prepared to strike the opening chords of ``Falstaff,'' the
protesters stormed through the aisles.
   ``We are demanding that those in attendance tonight wield their
power to make ending the AIDS epidemic a national priority,'' a
group statement said.
   As the activists chanted, threw leaflets and displayed banners,
the orchestra played the national anthem, and members of the
audience stood and sang along, Illgen said.
   ``I don't think the message that was meant to get across got
across,'' he said.
   Opera staffers carried and shoved the protesters out of the
auditorium, Illgen said.
   He said the 30-minute protest upset the opera audience, which
included singer Linda Ronstadt and actor Raoul Julia, ``but it was
not a big problem because opening night goes up about 20 minutes
late anyway.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal disease caused by
a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer. Federal officials say it has
afflicted more than 100,000 Americans.

<HEAD>Kemp Not Happy With Fence Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said he does not
want to see security fences put up around public housing projects as
called for in President Bush's anti-drug strategy, saying it's more
important to make the projects better places to live.
   Kemp called a proposal in Bush's National Drug Control Strategy
put security fences around the housing projects ``at the margin, a
possibility, but it's not my idea.''
   ``I don't want to put up some type of fence around public
housing,'' the secretary of Housing and Urban Development said in
the interview broadcast on CNN's ``Newsmaker Saturday'' program.
   The strategy includes a plan to ``make the nation's public
housing projects safer and freer from drug activity.''
   The outline suggests steps including new regulations Kemp has
already supported to speed the eviction of public housing residents
who are found to be drug dealers. It continues, ``Security
improvements such as better lighting, guards, identification cards,
security fences will be added to protect law abiding citizens from
the threat posed by drug dealers.''
   Asked on the broadcast about the fences, Kemp said, ``Not in
every instance. And very frankly, that is at the margin, a
possibility, but it's not my idea.
   ``And I think Bill Bennett as well as the president would, if
they had been where I've been _ and I've been in many public housing
communities in the last six months _ what we mean by `security' is
not ... dogs and machine guns and fences,'' he said.
   ``What we mean by security is well-lit residences, public housing
authority figures on the premises, or maybe police on the corner. It
means getting the drug dealer out and it means making sure that
these units are not being used for crack dealers,'' said Kemp.
   He added, ``I think the president's program is justified in terms
of putting out some of the brush fires that already exist in public
housing.''

<HEAD>Norway Calls off Election Campaign Because of Air Crash</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Dennar-Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political parties on Saturday canceled the
rest of the campaign for national elections in mourning for victims
of a plane crash that killed 55 people in Norway's worst air
disaster.
   But Monday's elections will be held as scheduled.
   ``A major, tragic accident has hit our nation .... The only right
and proper thing to do is to end the campaign right now,'' Prime
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said late Friday.
   The Norwegian Convair CV-580 turboprop was en route to West
Germany from Oslo on Friday when it crashed into the ocean north of
Denmark, killing all aboard. Most of the passengers on the charter
flight were Norwegians who won a lottery at the shipping company
where they worked to see a ship christened in West Germany.
   The chairmen of Norway's seven largest parties agreed to cancel
the rest f the campaign out of respect for the victims.
   A poll published Saturday gave Mrs. Brundtland's socialist Labor
Party 33.7 percent of the vote, down from 40.8 percent in the
previous general election in 1985.
   The largest opposition party, the Conservatives, was picked by 20
percent of the polled voters. It had 30.4 percent of the vote in
1985.
   The right-wing Party of Progress had climbed from 3.7 percent of
the 1985 vote to 22 percent in a late August poll. However, it
slipped to 16.1 percent in Saturday's survey.
   Several other small parties gained support from the rest of the
voters in the telephone poll.
   The survey of 1,215 voters, with a 2.8 percent margin of error,
was published in the daily newspaper Aftenposten.

   Anti-communist guerrillas have blocked
a 1,300-vehicle supply convoy outside a provincial capital, a senior
government official said Saturday.
   It was believed to be the biggest convoy of the 10-year-old civil
war between the Marxist government and rebels.
   In Kabul, six people were killed and eight wounded by three
rockets, a government spokesman said.
   More than 300 people have been killed and 700 injured in almost
daily rocket attacks on the capital since late June. The government
blames the attacks on the Pakistan-based guerrillas, but the rebels
accuse the Soviet-backed government of firing on its own civilians.
   Deputy Prime Minister Mahmoud Baryalai said the huge supply
convoy was stopped short of the southern city of Kandahar by heavy
fighting.
   ``The opponents are not sitting idle,'' he said, and they knew
they would lose a crucial advantage if the supplies are delivered.
   Government officials have said the convoy, which left in late
August from the town of Torgundi near the Soviet border, is carrying
military and civilian supplies to keep Kandahar going through the
winter.
   Two days ago the government said the convoy was in Maywand, 36
miles east of the Kandahar.
   Baryalai said the rebels stopped the convoy with random rocket
attacks on the road.
   He again denied a rebel claim that 80 vehicles have been
destroyed. He said only three were lost.
   Around the eastern city of Khost, government forces repulsed an
attack on an outer defense line, the state news agency Bakhtar
reported.
   Diplomats said the battle for Khost appeared to be stalemated.

   The army said Saturday it has captured
four leaders of a terrorist gang employed by drug kingpin Pablo
Escobar to protect his wife and kill his enemies.
   The death squad, which called itself ``Love for Medellin,'' also
acted as a vigilante morals squad, killing prostitutes and
homosexuals in the drug-infested city of Medellin, a military source
said.
   Also Saturday, military officials were quoted as saying they have
made new raids on properties linked to Colombia's No. 2 drug lord,
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. They said a computer disk showed he owned
374 vehicles, all with telephones.
   The daily terrorist attacks linked to drug traffickers continued
in Medellin, home of the powerful cocaine cartel of which Escobar is
the overlord. Bombs knocked out telephone lines, and damaged two
factories and a restaurant, police said. Three people were injured,
they said.
   Also, police in Medellin said they arrested five suspects in
connection with a mid-week bombing there of a government-run savings
bank.
   The 4th Army Brigade in Medellin said it had arrested four
leaders of Escobar's feared ``Love for Medellin'' assassin squad _
sarcastically named after a local charity group.
   The group acted as bodyguards for Maria Victoria Henao Vallejo,
Escobar's wife, the communique said. An army lieutenant, speaking on
condition of anonymity, described them as ``hit men.''
   The gang also operated as a morals death squad, killing local
drug addicts and others to ``clean up the streets'' in the city of 2
million, the army said.
   Escobar heads the list of Colombian drug lords wanted in the
United States and who are believed to supply the vast majority of
cocaine-consuming Americans.
   On Friday, authorities said Luis Fernando Galeano, a key aid of
Escobar's and a suspected trafficker, was released from custody
because there was no legal Colombian warrant for holding him and
also no extradition request from the United States.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington said Galeano
was not wanted there.
   Colombian newspapers said Saturday that Galeano was a financial
administrator for the Medellin cartel. They said he was linked to a
political assassination earlier this year in Monteria and a failed
death plot against a man with ties to the rival cocaine cartel in
the city of Cali.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco began a crackdown on
Aug. 18, after death squads linked to drug traffickers assassinated
leading presidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   Drug traffickers responded with bombings and shootings and
threats to kill judges, journalists and government officials.
   Barco assumed special emergency powers, such as confiscating bank
accounts and property linked to suspected traffickers and the
``administrative extradition'' of traffickers to the United States,
bypassing the slow, often corrupt and highly intimidated Colombian
court system.
   Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper reported Saturday that the army
raided 30 sites in Bogota and the rural town of Pacho suspected to
belong to Rodriguez Gacha, No. 2 on the nation's most-wanted list of
drug bosses.
   Colombia is offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to
the arrest of either Escobar or Rodriguez Gacha. Gacha's wealth has
been estimated at $3 billion.
   El Tiempo, citing unnamed military sources, said the army raid
netted 49 vehicles, including two bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz sedans.
Authorities also seized the computer disk showing Rodriguez Gacha
owns a total of 374 vehicles, all with telephones, worth about $10
million, the paper said.

   The government wants to restore
full diplomatic ties with Albania, cut in 1961 because of the Soviet
Union's break with Albania, the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo
said Saturday.
   By upgrading relations with an exchange of ambassadors,
Czechoslovakia would be following Hungary, East Germany, Romania and
Bulgaria.
   However, the isolated Communist leadership in the small Balkan
nation has refused Soviet overtures to restore ties severed because
of Albania's hard-line Stalinist and pro-Chinese stances.
   Rude Pravo said it was ``abnormal'' for Czechoslovakia and
Albania to maintain only charge d'affaires in each other's
countries. A note requesting improved ties was handed Friday to
Albanian charge d'affaires Idriz Dhrami, who said Saturday he had no
comment on the proposal.

   Heavy rain fell Saturday across the southern Plains as showers
and thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold front that stretched
from the southern Plains to the upper Great Lakes.
   Late Friday, severe thunderstorms hit parts of Missouri, Kansas
and Nebraska, and the heavy rain continued Saturday from southern
Texas across Arkansas and Kansas into southern Missouri.
   Eureka, Ark., got nearly 3 inches of rain in 6 hours during the
morning.
   The Kansas City, Mo., area got 4.5 inches of rain in the storms
from Friday into Saturday.
   Rivers and streams rose across northeastern Kansas, southeastern
Nebraska and northwestern Missouri.
   Minor flooding occurred along the Republican River near Clay
Center, Kan., and several rural roads in the area were closed by
water, the National Weather Service said.
   The Platte River at Platte City, Mo., is expected to rise to 10
feet above flood stage by Monday morning and the Missouri River at
St. Joseph, Mo., already 2 feet above flood stage, was expected to
climb 7 feet above flood stage, the weather service said.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the Tennessee
Valley and along the Gulf Coast, and showers extended from Iowa into
the upper Great Lakes.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.06 inches at Milwaukee and 1.02 inches at Springfield, Mo.
   Cool, moist air pushing into the northern and central Rockies
produced showers, with snow at higher elevations. In Wyoming, up to
5 inches of snow fell across the Wind River range and the Laramie
Range received a half-inch of snow.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 40s and 50s from the
northern and central Rockies across much of North Dakota into
northern Minnesota.
   Great Falls, Mont., tied its record low for the date of 31
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees at Riverton, Wyo., to 98 at Harlingen, Waco and Austin,
Texas, and Palm Springs, Calif. Saturday morning's low in the Lower
48 states was 26 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from the
eastern half of the southern Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley
across the Ohio Valley and the eastern half of the Great Lakes
region to northern New England. Scattered showers were forecast from
the northern Plains and Nebraska into the northern and central
Rockies. Snow was forecast at higher elevations of the northern
Rockies.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted over northwestern and central
Montana; in the 50s and 60s from Idaho across Wyoming, the northern
Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley to the western half of the
upper Great Lakes region; in the 90s from the southern Atlantic
Coast and Florida across the Tennessee Valley and the Gulf Coast to
southern and eastern Texas; between 90 and 105 across the desert
Southwest into interior valleys of California; and in the 70s and
80s across much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   An estimated 30,000 people attended the
consecration Saturday of the new Roman Catholic bishop in the Slovak
diocese of Spis, the Catholic news agency Kathpress reported.
   The new bishop, Frantisek Tondra, is one of four named by the
Vatican in July after years of negotations with Czechoslovakia's
communist government.
   Tondra, a 53-year-old former parish priest, is the first bishop
appointed in the diocese of Spis in almost four decades. The last
resident bishop there was Jan Vojtassak, who in 1951 was sentenced
to 24 years in jail, according to Kathpress. It gave no further
information about Vojtassak.
   Kathpress said that a Vatican envoy, Archbishop Francesco
Colasuonno, the other Czechoslovak bishops and Vienna's bishop Kurt
Krenn were among those attending the consecration ceremony.
   Seven of Czechoslovakia's 13 dioceses are still without bishops,
and the Catholic church has said not enough priests are allowed to
train at the country's three seminaries to fill vacant parishes.
   In May 1988, the Vatican selected the first three bishops
appointed in 15 years in Czechoslovakia, but none was a residential
bishop. Those appointments and the July announcement followed
intense negotiations and a petition for more bishops, priests and
religious freedom signed in early 1988 by more than half a million
Czechoslovaks.

   Three rockets fired from the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon hit the headquarters of
the Norwegian contingent of the U.N. peacekeeping force in southern
Lebanon Saturday, police reported.
   They said there were no casualties.
   Police said the Katyusha rockets were fired during artillery
exchanges between Arab guerrillas and units of Israeli troops and
their allied Lebanese militiamen in Israel's self-designated
security zone.
   U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel confirmed the report and said 10
rockets also exploded near the Norwegian battalion's headquarters in
Ibl El-Saqi village.
   Ibl El-Saqi is in the eastern sector of Israel's ``security
zone,'' a 6-to-10-mile deep border strip in south Lebanon.
   The Norwegian battalion's area of operation overlaps with the
zone, which Israel established as a buffer against cross-border
guerrilla raids into Israel's northern settlements.
   The 680-strong Norwegian battalion is part of the U.N.
peacekeeping force deployed in southern Lebanon since 1978.
   Other nations participating are Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana,
Ireland, Italy, Nepal and Sweden.

   A quadriplegic who won court permission to
turn off his own life support system said Saturday he knows that
whatever happens after he does so will be better than life without a
body.
   ``Try to imagine being frozen, not being able to move anything,
not even being able to breathe,'' said Larry McAfee, an engineer and
avid outdoorsman before a 1985 motorcycle wreck severed his spine,
paralyzing him from the chin down.
   The 33-year-old Atlanta resident received permission Wednesday
from a Georgia judge to return to that state and turn off the
ventilator that has breathed for him and kept him alive since the
accident.
   McAfee said he was not frightened, but wonders what will happen
when he dies.
   ``I believe in God. I pray a lot. I believe that whatever happens
after death will be better,'' he said.
   McAfee met with reporters for about 30 minutes at a nursing home
where he has been for the past month. He sat strapped into a
wheelchair with breathing tubes in his throat and mouth, his words
interrupted by loud gasps for air.
   He would not say when he plans to turn off his life-support
machine.
   McAfee said that in ``some small way'' he hoped publicity over
his decision would help others in similar conditions.
   ``I wasn't aware of the problems involved in trying to obtain a
court order like this _ the problems and the time it took for me,''
he said.
   McAfee said he did not consider the decision to end his life to
be suicide. ``To me, suicide is an unnatural act. Turning off a
ventilator ... and letting nature take its course, to me that is not
unnatural,'' he said.
   McAfee said his family supported his decision, but none of his
relatives attended the news conference. Julie Orr, one of his
sisters, said he had not discussed his plans with family members.
   McAfee said he has spent the last four years ``watching a clock,
watching TV and doing a small amount of reading.''
   He said that although the high cost of his care was a factor in
his decision, the main reason was the indignity of having to depend
on others for everything.
   ``Year after year, day after day, it just slowly drains
everything you have,'' he said.
   Georgia Superior Court Judge Edward Johnson ruled last week that
McAfee's right to refuse continued life-sustaining treatment
outweighed the state's interest in preserving his life.
   ``The ventilator to which he is attached is not prolonging his
life,'' Johnson said his order. ``It is prolonging his death.''
   Johnson ordered the state to appeal the decision to the Georgia
Supreme Court, but said McAfee would not have to await the outcome.
   McAfee met privately Saturday with his attorney, Randall H. Davis
of Atlanta, who said McAfee plans to go to a friend's apartment in
Atlanta. He said McAfee wants to activate a timer that will shut off
his ventilator.
   The two men told reporters that offers of high-tech machines that
would help McAfee perform routine household tasks were generous, but
could not provide a life that he wanted to live.
   Davis said McAfee has been in counseling for four years and has
had ample opportunity to discuss innovative technologies that would
allow him to perform some functions. ``He's heard it all,'' Davis
said.

   A doctor who believed he was cursed because he was
born on Friday the 13th is insane and not legally responsible for
axing his wife to death and drowning his infant daughter, a judge
ruled.
   Dr. Lee Robin, 31, from the Chicago suburb of Palatine, in August
1988 attacked his wife with an ax while she slept and continued the
assault after she awakened, said Assistant State's Attorney Nicholas
Trutenko. Robin then drowned the baby in a bathtub, Trutenko said.
   Robin told authorities he didn't know why he killed his wife,
Annette, 28. But he said he decided to drown their 2{-month-old
daughter, Denise, because he didn't want her growing up without a
mother, Trutenko said.
   On the day of the killings, Robin told police he was born on
Friday the 13th and that his life had been miserable ever since. He
tried to commit suicide a week before the killings, police said.
   Three psychiatrists testified that Robin was insane. Cook County
Criminal Court Judge James M. Bailey announced his ruling Friday.
   An Oct. 23 hearing was scheduled to determine if Robin should be
committed involuntarily to a state psychiatric hospital.

<DATELINE>HOWARD AIR BASE, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A four-member U.S. congressional
delegation on Saturday accused Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who
controls the Panamanian government, of being a ``narco-terrorist.''
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., told a news conference that the
United States will continue its efforts to oust Noriega and will
``increase pressure against him and his associates in areas such as
preventing their travel to the United States and preventing their
conducting business with the United States.''
   He was referring to recent U.S. measures aimed at further
isolating the Panamanian government economically by forbidding U.S.
companies from doing business with Noriega's associates.
   ``Noriega's involvement in drug dealing and money laundering, for
which he faces indictment before U.S. courts, makes him a premier
narco-terrorist,'' Edwards said in a statement. ``From the streets
of American cities to the unfolding drama in Panama's neighbor to
the south (Colombia), we can see the effects of men like Noreiga
choosing power and profit over principle.''
   His statement said the United States will ``stand by the people
of Panama until their fight for self-determination is respected and
democratic government is restored.'' It also said the United States
will continue to ``oppose any accommodation with any regime or
official appointed by Noriega.''
   Noriega, commander of Panama's Defense Forces, was indicted by
two federal grand juries in Florida in February 1988. They accused
him of dealing in illegal narcotics including laundering drug money.
   The congressmen came to this Air Force base, part of the U.S.
Southern Command, from El Salvador. They left Saturday for Nicaragua.
   They met with former presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and
his vice presdiential running mate Guillermo Ford, whom they called
``the elected leadership of this country.''
   International oberservers said opposition candidates Endara and
Ford won the May 7 elections, but the government annulled the
balloting, saying U.S. financial assistance and other support for
the opposition distorted the election results.
   Edwards declined to say if he thought the United States should
recognize Endara as president, as it did ousted President Eric
Delvalle.
   ``That is a decision for President Bush and Mr. Endara,'' Edwards
said. ``The world is full of presidents in exile. We do not want a
president who does not hold power.... It is not up to the United
States to put an elected president in power ... that is up to the
Panamanian people.''
   Noriega has denied all U.S. allegations against him and claims
the United States want to remove him and renege on the Panama Canal
Treaties that turn the canal over Panama at the end of the century.
   Other members of the congressional delegation are Doug Bereuter,
R-Neb., Bill Grant, D-Fla. and Elton Gallegly, R-Calif.

<TEXT>
   Montana's Old West centennial spectacular
of longhorn cattle, cowboys and covered wagons rumbled into town
just after dawn Saturday, drawing an uproarious welcome along a
three-mile parade route.
   Thousands began lining the Main Street route through Billings
Heights in spite of a pre-dawn temperature of 47 degrees to cheer on
the cattle drive and wagon train that revived _ for six short days _
the romanticism, heroism and friendship of a bygone era. Some people
had begun reserving viewing spots with parked cars the day before.
   The cattle and drovers had been accompanied on the trail by some
240 covered wagons and 2,400 ``social riders.''
   ``This is the best Western movie I've ever seen,'' said Ingemar
Gleissman of Stockholm, Sweden. Gleissman said he decided he had to
join the cattle drive after reading about it during a business trip
to San Francisco.
   To take part in the drive, riders had to have an animal for the
cattle herd. If they didn't own one, they could lease one.
   ``All our friends loved the fact that we're renting a cow,'' said
Sally Branning of Cherry Hills, N.J. ``They all asked how I'll tell
it apart from the other cows.''
   After the parade, the cattle were driven to two Billings
livestock markets, where most cattle arrive by truck, and the riders
dismounted for an auction of memorabilia and a concert.
   The six-day celebration was the most ambitious of scores of
official events created to celebrate Montana's 100th year as a state.
   The parade opened with one rider bellowing a long ``Yeeeee-HAW!''
as a procession headed by a Union cavalry unit rolled into town.
   The riders and covered wagons accompanying the drive arrived
first, followed by the 2,700 head of cattle that had been driven 60
miles the old- fashioned way since leaving the small town of Roundup
on Monday. Roundup was chosen as the starting point partly because
of its name.
   Although the riders and wagons were confined to one-half of the
street, the cattle swept along all six lanes of the boulevard when
they hit the parade route.
   ``Nobody explained to the cows that they're only supposed to use
half the street,'' a police officer said.
   The rangy longhorns that made up most of the herd, trail-wise and
a little tired after six days, caused little trouble on city streets
and delighted the exuberant crowd in the city of about 65,000 people.
   Although they were nearly surrounded by the 105 drovers who had
herded them over the route, the animals still passed within easy
petting distance of the crowd and a few people reached out to touch
them as they moved by.
   Riders and horses strutted and pranced in response to the crowd's
admiration, but the cattle were largely indifferent. They plodded
sedately _ and unknowingly _ past McDonald's, Arby's and other
symbols of their fate.
   Billings police, augmented by sheriff's and Highway Patrol
officers, turned out full-force to control and protect the crowds.
   A full force of street cleaners, both people and machines, swung
into action immediately after the cattle and horses were gone.
   A hint of Saturday's turnout came Thursday when an estimated
20,000 people drove 21 miles north of town for a public concert at
the wagon camp. Traffic was snarled for hours, and police had to
turn back about 5,000 people.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steffi Graf won her third major tennis tournament
of the year Saturday, beating the heat and Martina Navratilova 3-6,
7-5, 6-1 in the U.S. Open final.
   The only blemish on the top seed's record in the four Grand Slam
events this year was a final-round loss to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
in the French Open.
   ``It's very difficult to play in the four (major) tournaments and
do the best you can,'' Graf said. ``I'm very happy I won another
three.''
   The match, played in near 100-degree temperatures on the court,
ended with an ace on a second serve by Graf, who then sprinted to
the courtside boxes to hug her father. She also signaled to a group
of fans high in the stadium that had been chanting her name
throughout the 1-hour, 50-minute match.
   Graf, 20, has won seven of the last eight major tournament _ the
third woman to do so and first since Margaret Smith Court in 1969-70
_ while Navratilova hasn't won one since the 1987 Open, when she
beat Graf for the title.
   ``It was really just a matter of a couple of points here and
there,'' said Navratilova, who received an ovation. ``I'll keep
trying until those points go my way.''
   Graf, of West Germany, has won each of the Grand Slam titles
twice.
   Graf won $300,000 for her 11th tournament win this year.
Navratilova, 32, a native of Czechoslovakia who is now a U.S.
citizen, earned $150,000.

<HEAD>Navy Launches New Trident Sub; Six Protesters Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy on Saturday launched its newest
Trident nuclear submarine, the $1.2 billion USS Pennsylvania. About
100 anti-nuclear activists protested and six were arrested.
   The 560-foot long submarine is the second ballistic missile
submarine equipped to carry the Trident 2 missile, which is intended
to have a range of up to 4,000 miles and accuracy of within 200
yards.
   ``Fleet ballistic missile submarines, and particularly our
Trident submarines and the men who take them to sea, are the heart
and soul of our deterrent,'' Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III
told a crowd of about 1,000 at the commissioning. The sub will be
based in Kings Bay, Ga.
   About a quarter of a mile from the ceremony, members of the
environmental and anti-nuclear group Greenpeace formed a flotilla of
10 small boats in the Thames River. Several protesters floated in a
wooden replica of the yellow submarine made famous by the Beatles. A
four-piece band on a sailboat played ``Anchors Aweigh'' and ``Yellow
Submarine.''
   ``We're committed to the cancellation of the Trident program.
Even though we make light of the Pennsylvania, it's the taxpayers'
money that's being wasted,'' said Shannon Fagan, a Greepeace
organizer.
   Six protesters in three inflatable rafts deliberately crossed
barriers the Coast Guard had set up about 50 yards from the
submarine. One of the rafts reached the submarine, and protesters
were trying to affix an anti-nuclear flag to its side when Coast
Guard boats arrived with New London police aboard.
   Coast Guardsmen sprayed the protesters briefly with water
cannons. No one was injured. The six demonstrators were arrested and
charged with criminal trespass and reckless operation of a motor
vessel. They were released after posting bond.

   The Bush administration is shunning covert
intervention in Nicaragua and instead is looking for money from
Congress to openly support the Sandinista government's political
opposition, sources said Saturday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to speak with
congressional leaders this week on prospects for a grant to the
National Endowment for Democracy, which would help the opposition
campaign in the February elections, said the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The administration is considering asking for around $3 million to
help Violeta Chamorro, the prominent newspaper publisher chosen by
several opposition parties as a consensus presidential candidate,
plus an unspecified amount for such things as voter registration,
election observers and repatriation, said the sources.
   Carl Gershman, president of the National Endowment, said he did
not know if Congress or the administration was using the $3 million
figure but ``my understanding is that it is roughly in the range of
what some of the Nicaraguans thought they need.''
   Gershman said he has discussed new funding with members of
Congress and the NED board of directors, which would approve how the
money is spent, will take it up at the end of the week.
   The Endowment is a private foundation created by Congress in 1982
to support democratic elections worldwide, with money appropriated
by Congress. For 1989, it got $15.8 million for its
democracy-promoting activities, such as holding conferences and
observing elections.
   The organization since 1985 has provided support for La Prensa,
the opposition newspaper led by Mrs. Chamorro.
   Earlier this year, Congress approved $1.5 million for the
Endowment to promote democratic activity in Nicaragua, along with
the same amount to pay for election observers under the auspices of
the Organization of American States.
   ``We don't want to go the covert route,'' said one administration
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official added
the administration believes there would be no support in Congress
for covert action of the sort the CIA used for years in Nicaragua.
   White House spokeman Roman Popadiuk declined to comment
specifically on the administration plans.
   ``The United States has long supported a return to democracy in
Nicaragua,'' he said. ``The National Endowment for Democracy has
played a role in this process. The administration is continuting to
examine ways in which it can play a role in a fair and open
election.''
   Nicaragua's political opposition leaders signed an agreement with
the Sandinistas this summer agreeing there would be no secret
funding of political activity.
   Under Nicaraguan law, half of any funds coming into the electoral
system from outside the country must be given to the national
Supreme Electoral Council which oversees and monitors elections.
   That means giving $6 million would have to be sent to Nicaragua
to ensure Mrs. Chamorro got $3 million and some of the money would
benefit the Sandinista ticket under the national council's
activities.
   Gershman said the U.S. funds, if approved, would help even out an
``incredibly unbalanced situation'' in Nicaragua where President
Daniel Ortega's Sandinistas control government resources.
   ``They're getting massive subsidies from the Soviet bloc,'' he
said, adding any U.S. funds would be spent by his group ``in the
spirit of trying to introduce a degree of fairness in the
situation.''
   He said the opposition forces also are expected to seek campaign
funds in Europe and Latin America.
   The Washington Post, which initially reported on the aid proposal
Saturday, said the administration had been considering using the CIA
in the election in Nicaragua, but anticipated heavy congressional
opposition.
   After years of pinning its policy on the Contra rebels that were
fighting to oust the Sandinistas, the United States under President
Bush has endorsed diplomatic efforts underway to achieve peace.
   With little sentiment in Congress for renewing military aid, Bush
agreed with congressional leaders on a $49 million non-lethal aid
package to keep the Contras in supplies and food until the election,
and to be used for repatriation where needed.
   The last U.S. military aid to the Contras came in a $100 million
package in 1986 that was accompanied by a lifting of restrictions on
CIA covert activity in Nicaragua.
   The presidents of Nicaragua and four other Central American
nations reached agreement this year calling for disbandment of the
Contras, coupled with moves toward democratic reform in Nicaragua
leading to the February elections.

   Two Ukrainian leaders joined Saturday in calling
for the ouster of the last Old Guard member of the ruling Politburo,
an activist said.
   At a different meeting Saturday, another conservative Politburo
member, Yegor K. Ligachev, warned that ethnic unrest could lead to
the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   The calls for the removal of Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, who is
also chief of the Ukrainian Communist Party, came at a meeting of
the Ukrainian Popular Movement for Perestroika in the republic's
capital, Kiev. Speakers called for creation of a sovereign, free
Ukraine with a multiparty system.
   Sergei I. Konev, a member of the new Soviet Congress, called on
the grass-roots group ``to express its lack of confidence in the
government of the Ukraine headed by Shcherbitsky,'' according to
Anatoly Dotsenko, Moscow-based spokesman for the U.S. human rights
group Helsinki Watch.
   Konev said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev should ``do everything
he can, as soon as possible, so that the criminals of Chernobyl get
out of the Ukrainian government.''
   Shcherbitsky was in charge of the Ukraine when a reactor exploded
at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, killing 31 people, spewing
radiation and forcing the evacuation of thousands. Some residents
accuse him of covering up the radiation damage, restraining the
local press and arresting and harassing dissidents.
   At 71, Shcherbitsky is the oldest of the 12 men on the ruling
Politburo, and is considered one of the most conservative. Except
for Gorbachev, he is the only member who dates back to the late
President Leonid I. Brezhnev, now blamed for the country's economic
decay.
   Many of the 2,000 delegates and guests applauded Konev's remarks,
Dotsenko said, quoting observers at the meeting.
   Ligachev spoke out for the second time in a week against ethnic
unrest.
   ``If there is no inter-ethnic accord and friendship between
people, there will be no effective work in the economic sphere, at
businesses, in fields and at farms, and then the disintegration of
the union of Soviet republics is unavoidable,'' Ligachev said.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda reported Ligachev's remarks at
an agricultural seminar in Frunze, capital of Soviet Kirghizia.
   A mass meeting late Saturday in Baku, the capital of the southern
republic of Azerbaijan, supported extending the weeklong strike
called by the People's Front, according to a member of the front.
   Activist Ingilab Aslanov said several hundred thousand people
attended the meeting and voted to prolong the strike, originally set
to last only seven days, because ``the government hasn't accepted
any of our demands.''
   The strikers want new elections, official recognition of the
People's Front, Azerbaijani control of the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh and a visit by a top Kremlin official to the
republic. The republic of Armenia also wants control of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The strike has paralyzed Azerbaijan's railroads and affected most
of its industry, but the oil-rich republic's refineries are working,
Aslanov said in an interview from Baku.
   In Kiev, Shcherbitsky also was denounced by Ivan Saly, a
secretary of the Communist Party regional committee in Kiev's Podol
region.
   ``Comrade Shcherbitsky, your time is up!'' Saly told the meeting.
   Petro Poberezhny, deputy chairman of a committee that organized a
coal miners' strike in Donetsk in July, lashed out at the Ukrainian
party chief's handling of news media.
   ``As a communist, I announce that the republic newspaper Pravda
Ukraine is an organ of Vladimir Shcherbitsky, and not of the
communists of the republic,'' he said.
   Gorbachev, during a visit to Kiev in February after six Ukrainian
leaders were defeated in parliamentary elections, ordered party
leaders there to work ``with the people and for the people.''
   Shcherbitsky has remained firmly in control, however, reportedly
because he ensures that the important industrial and grain-growing
region _ popularly known as the Soviet breadbasket and the second
most populous republic _ meets its economic targets.
   In an interview earlier this year, Shcherbitsky accused the
leaders of the Ukrainian Popular Movement for Perestroika of
ambition and nationalism that ``leads the way to permissiveness and
national antagonism, contradicting the interests of perestroika,''
or restructuring of the economy and society.

   Recovering rapidly from surgery to remove
fluid from the surface of his brain, former President Ronald Reagan
on Saturday joked with visitors and read several newspapers, his
spokesman said.
   ``He is in excellent spirits, telling baseball stories and joking
with his staff,'' Reagan's spokesman Mark Weinberg said.
   In reference to the removal of at least some of his hair for the
surgery, Reagan quipped, ``I guess my barber can have the week
off,'' Weinberg said.
   Shortly after awaking at 6:30 a.m. Saturday, Reagan underwent a
follow-up CAT scan to view the upper right portion of his head where
surgeons on Friday drilled a hole in his skull to remove a buildup
of blood. Weinberg said the problem stemmed from a July 4 incident
in which Reagan fell from a ``wildly'' bucking horse. It was
detected on a routine physical examination.
   The ``evacuation'' of the puddle of blood had progressed
``exactly as had been anticipated'' as of Saturday morning and
doctors removed the drain that had been placed on his skull at the
time of surgery, Weinberg said.
   Friday's hour-long operation was led by Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt,
chairman of the Mayo Clinic's department of neurologic surgery.
Sundt, editor of a leading medical journal on neurology, was
assisted by two neurologic surgeons, three nurses and an
anesthesiologist at the clinic, located about 70 miles southeast of
Minneapolis.
   Reagan's postoperative recovery room is located in an otherwise
unoccupied section of St. Marys Hospital which was under security
guard. Nancy Reagan spent the night in a room across the hall from
her husband and will remain at the hospital ``at least for the time
being,'' Weinberg said.
   He would not say when Reagan is expected to be released and Sundt
would not comment about any aspect of Reagan's care.
   Weinberg said Reagan spent part of Friday night watching the
Minnesota Twins play the Kansas City Royals on television. He ate a
breakfast Saturday of bran cereal, whole wheat toast, orange juice
and decaffeinated coffee and will continue to be able to choose his
own diet, Weinberg said.
   ``President Reagan read several newspapers and visited with Mrs.
Reagan and members of their staff,'' Weinberg said. ``President
Reagan will spend the rest of the day reading and resting.''
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said President Bush called
Reagan about 6 p.m. EDT and the call lasted about five minutes.
   ``The president wished him well.'' said Popadiuk. ``President
Reagan sounded strong and very well. He said he had no pain. He
stated that he hopes to get out soon and expressed his appreciation
for the flowers the president and Mrs. Bush had sent.''
   Among the others sending messages to Reagan were Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain, the Rev. Billy Graham, Henry
Kissinger and former presidents Ford and Nixon, Weinberg said.
   Also Saturday, delegates to a state Republican convention in
Mankato, Minn., received an unexpected call from Reagan.
   ``I'm being handsomely treated here in your state, and it's a
pleasure to be here,'' Reagan said. ``I'm going to be out on the
mashed potato circuit as much as I can.''
   A hospital employee who asked not to be identified said only a
mild pain killer was prescribed for Reagan. Weinberg said he did not
know if Reagan was taking any pain-killers.
   ``He looks great, he feels great, his spirits are terrific,''
Weinberg said ``No further treatment is now anticipated.''
   Several doctors not involved in the surgery or connected to the
Mayo Clinic said the type of surgery Reagan underwent was common.
They say the recovery period usually includes up to a week of
hospitalization.
   Weinberg said he does not know if the recovery period will limit
the former president's activities.

   Hurricane Gabrielle stalled in the Atlantic on
Saturday, annoying the Northeast coast of the United States with
heavy swells, but remaining far from land.
   ``It's losing its steering currents,'' said forecaster Bob Case
of the National Hurricane Center. ``It looks like its going to hang
up and become almost stationary for the next two days.''
   Gabrielle's 85 mph winds will probably weaken because the storm
is partly over water that is too cold to maintain its circular
motion, he said.
   ``But it continues to create large swells along the coastline,
especially along the New England and mid-Atlantic coast,'' Case
added.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle's center was located near 39.2 degrees
north latitude and 60.2 degrees west longitude, or about 335 miles
south of Sable Island, Nova Scotia.
   It continued to slow and was moving north near 5 mph, and was
expected to drift northwards or become stationary Saturday night or
Sunday, forecasters said.
   The former Hurricane Felix lost its tropical characteristics to
the north of Gabrielle on Thursday, forecasters said, and was no
longer being monitored.
   Gabrielle was the seventh named storm of the 1989 Atlantic
hurricane season. It was at one time the strongest of the season,
with winds that peaked at 135 mph, but never got close enough to
land to cause serious damage.
   Systems become named tropical storms when their winds reach 39
mph, and are termed hurricanes at 74 mph.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ Attorneys for a Seventh-day Adventist
couple convicted of starving their teen-age son to death say they
will appeal the verdict on grounds the boy was expressing his
freedom of religion.
   Fourteen-year-old Eric Cottam died Jan. 3 after the family went
six weeks without food despite $3,775 set aside by Eric's father, a
former Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor, as a tithe for God.
   A jury on Friday deliberated for less than two hours before
finding Larry Cottam and his wife, Leona Cottam, guilty of
third-degree murder, two counts each of recklessly endangering
another person and endangering the welfare of children in the cases
of Eric and their 12-year-old daughter, Laura, who since has been
placed in a foster home.
   ``They were under the care, control and custody of their parents
... Even though they may not want to eat, the parents' duty
supercedes,'' Luzerne County Judge Gifford S. Cappelini said after
the verdict.
   The family had contended that each member agreed to the fast
because of their religious convictions. But Cappelini ruled the
Cottams couldn't raise the children's religious freedom in front of
the jury.
   Al Flora Jr., an attorney for the Cottams, said he plans to
appeal on the grounds the children's constitutional rights to
religious freedom were not considered by the jury because of
Cappelini's ruling.
   ``Some of the issues involved in this case are novel ones,''
Flora said in asking the judge to allow the Cottams to remain free
on bail pending appeal. ``They are issues that have not been taken
up by our appellate courts.''
   Cottam, 39, and Mrs. Cottam, 38, remain free on $50,000 bail
each. An anonymous benefactor posted bail for them Aug. 23 after
they spent 230 days in custody following their Jan. 5 arraignment at
Mercy Hospital.
   After he was arrested, Cottam told police he couldn't spend the
nearly $4,000 in tithe money for food because it belonged to God.
Spending it would have been akin to stealing, he said.
   Seventh-day Adventists generally give 10 percent of their
earnings as a tithe, but a church official testified at the trial
tithing was not a requirement for membership in the church.
   Mrs. Cottam testified she had several dollars saved as a tithe,
but also believed spending the money for food would have been the
same as stealing.
   Neither Cottam or his wife commented following the verdict, nor
did they testify during the trial.
   No sentencing date has been set. They face a maximum 28 years in
prison.
   Eric Cottam died in an upstairs bedroom of the family's modest
two-story home in Nuangola, just south of this northeastern
Pennsylvania city. His 5-foot, 9-inch frame weighed 69 pounds.
   A day later, Larry Cottam went to a neighbor's house to call
police to his home. He, his wife and daughter were hospitalized for
malnutrition.
   Flora said the family went without food because they distrusted
authorities and believed God would rescue them from their plight.
They also believed their children would be taken away from them if
they sought help, he said.

   A knife-wielding Arab passenger stabbed the
Israeli driver of a bus and tried to force the vehicle off the road
Saturday at the same site were 16 people were killed in a similar
attack last June.
   Other passengers grabbed the attacker and the bus remained on the
road, according to news reports.
   In the occupied territories, Palestinians brought business and
transportation to a standstill in a general strike marking the
beginning of the 22nd month of the uprising against Israeli
occupation.
   Police or hospital officials also reported that in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip an Arab deputy mayor was slain as a
suspected collaborator with Israel and 22 Palestinians were wounded
in clashes with Israeli forces.
   Israel television said a Palestinian man, seated in the third row
of a bus, dashed forward, plunged a knife into the driver's stomach,
grabbed the steering wheel and nearly succeeded in driving the
vehicle off the road and into a steep ravine.
   On June 6, 16 people including two Canadians and an American were
killed when an Arab passenger forced a bus off the road only yards
away from the location of Saturday's attack.
   Israel radio said that Saturday other passengers wrenched the
steering wheel away from the Palestinian and beat him. Two policemen
driving near the bus on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway saw the
fighting and when the bus stopped took the assailant into custody,
according to Israel television.
   The radio broadcast said the bus driver, Reuven Assor, 40, was
hospitalized for stab wounds and the Arab, identified only as a
Palestinian from the occupied territories, also was hospitalized for
injuries.
   In the West Bank town of Qalqilya, masked assailants burst into
the home of deputy mayor Yusuf Milhem and shot him at least six
times in the chest, Arab reports said.
   An army spokesman said Milhem was rushed to an Israeli hospital
where he died of his wounds.
   Milhem's death raised to 111 the number of Palestinians killed by
their fellow Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli
authorities. At least 560 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
troops or civilians and 39 Israelis have been slain since the
uprising broke out on Dec. 8, 1987, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In the occupied territories, troops shot and wounded 22
Palestinians, including a 60-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man,
hospital officials said.
   An Israeli policeman was burned severely when his car was
firebombed Saturday morning near the West Bank town of Beit Hanina,
Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandouri said. He said the officer
was returning to his Jerusalem home and was out of uniform and
driving a private car. Israel radio said four suspects have been
detained.
   In the occupied territories, streets were deserted as
Palestinians observed a strike ordered by the underground leadership
of the uprising, Arab reports and Israel radio said.
   In the Gaza Strip, 20 Arabs were shot and wounded by army
gunfire, hospital officials said.
   The wounded included 32-year-old Fayiz Abu Ishbeka, and Zeinab
Ahmed Abu el-Khair, a 60-year-old woman accidentally shot as she
passed by a demonstration in the Shati refugee camp, hospital
officials said.
   In the West Bank's Askar refugee camp, two Palestinians were
wounded when a group of Arabs violated an army curfew and began
stoning troops, Arab reports said. The refugee camp, near the town
of Nablus, has been under curfew for the past week.
   The army confirmed the wounding of Ishbeka and said it was
investigating the other incidents.
   Army spokesman Col. Raanan Gissin told Israel radio Saturday that
220 Palestinians suspected of being local uprising leaders have been
arrested in the last two weeks during raids in the occupied lands.
He said 700 other suspects were still sought.
   In the army's Ketziot prison, a Palestinian prisoner was severely
beaten by fellow inmates on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli
authorities, Arab reports and Israel radio said.
   Prison guards rescued Munir Mohammed Yasin, 22, of Gaza's Shati
refugee camp, and rushed him to an Israeli hospital, where he was
reported in moderate condition, the radio said.
   Also Saturday, more than 20 Katyusha rockets fell on U.N. and
Israeli positions in southern Lebanon, causing slight damage but no
injuries, the army and a U.N. spokesman said.
   The U.N. spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 10
of the rockets landed in territory patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers.
He said three of those rockets exploded near a local U.N.
headquarters.
   No one claimed responsibility for firing the rockets, which came
from the north, he said.

<HEAD>Little Red Riding Hood Exposed As ``Fake''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Little Red Riding Hood story read to
generations of children is a fake, distorted from original folk
versions by male writers who made the girl into a frail victim, an
anthropologist said Saturday.
   ``Male writers completely ruined the tale by bringing men into
it,'' said Alan Dundes of the University of California-Berkeley,
editor of a new book of scholarly essays on the classic folktale.
   ``They made the girl a weak little thing who had to be rescued.
The original folktale is a female story in which the mother sends
the daughter out and the little girl is triumphant.''
   Dundes' book includes analyses of Little Red Riding Hood by
psychologists, historians, anthropologists and sociologists, plus
versions of the oral folktale collected in Europe and Asia.
   ``There are enough oral versions around in different languages so
that we know what the original must have been like,'' Dundes said in
an interview.
   The original folktales may have been considered too crude by
Charles Perrault, the French writer who first put the story into
written form in 1697 and made it into a moral fable warning girls
against listening to strangers, Dundes said. At the end, Little Red
Riding Hood got gobbled up by the wolf.
   The Grimm brothers, Jacob and Wilhelm, based their popular 1812
story on a second-hand account of Perrault's version and changed the
ending. This time the girl was saved by a hunter, who cut open the
wolf's stomach to allow Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother
to spring out alive.
   Once upon a time, though, Little Red Riding Hood was a craftier
character who escaped the wolf's big teeth. In fact, said Dundes,
the wolf was orginally female and the little girl didn't even have a
red hood.
   In European oral folk stories, the girl unwittingly eats the
flesh and blood of her grandmother, who had been killed by the wolf,
Dundes said. In various Asian versions, she is tricked by the
villain, usually a female tiger or ogress, into eating her sister's
finger or bone.
   In all the oral stories, Dundes said, the girl triumphs over the
villain and gets away.
   Perrault and the Grimm brothers left out the cannibalism and made
Little Red Riding Hood into ``a real wimp'' who ``stupidly tells the
wolf where she's going'' on the way to her grandmother, Dundes said.
   ``The feminists have attacked the wrong tale,'' Dundes said.
``They are rightly concerned about the influence fairy tales have in
society. But they should be attacking the Grimm or Perrault or Walt
Disney versions. It's not the tale that's at fault. It's the male
versions.''

<TEXT>
   Police have begun suspending the
drivers' licenses of people caught soliciting prostitutes.
   Police say the license suspension is worse than the standard $500
fine for the crime, which most offenders pay after pleading guilty
rather than risk the public embarrassment of a trial.
   ``The fine isn't bad, but when they risk losing their driver
license, it takes on a whole new light,'' said police Sgt. Robb
Robertson.
   Police arrested 23 men for soliciting prostitutes last week and
issued the license revocation charge.
   ``They were not happy,'' Lt. David Hughes said. ``I think it will
have a good deterrent effect.''
   The law, which says violators making a deal for sex from a car
can lose their licenses for one year, was dormant for years and
re-enacted this year.

   A man who raised a stink at a grocery
store was arrested when he refused to leave.
   Employees at Buttrey's called police early Friday when a man
reeking of skunk fumes came in and wouldn't leave.
   The man apparently had a run-in with a skunk as it was rummaging
for food behind the store, police said.
   The man went inside to get some tomato juice to rid himself of
the smell, but store workers and several customers turned up their
noses at him and asked him to leave.
   When officers arrived, the man was in the store and attempting to
shower in tomato juice, said Capt. Dale Brunson.
   Belva Williams, 29, of Richland, was cited by police for
trespassing and for being a public nuisance.
   Williams spent the night at Benton County Jail, after showering
with disinfectant and having his clothes laundered, police said.
   A judge released him later Friday morning without bail.

   A bolt of lightning downed a
helicopter during U.S.-Honduran military maneuvers, killing four
Honduran soldiers and injuring four, the government said Saturday.
   Military sources said the accident occurred Friday night during a
heavy thunderstorm near the small village of San Antonio de Majada,
180 miles northeast of Tegucigalpa. The source said the Honduran air
force Bell-124 chopper was returning to the air base at San Pedro
Sula, 120 miles north of Tegucigalpa.
   The victims were identified as Lt. Col. Daniel Arturo Tabora
Talbot, Lt. Col. Wilfredo Mendoza Garay, Capt. Luis Felipe Reyes and
Lt. Nelson Henriiquez.
   The military said that three soldiers and the pilot were
hospitalized in stable condition on Saturday.
   Police and soldiers began recovering the bodies Saturday morning.
   The camouflaged helicopter and its occupants were participating
in the aerial part of the joint exercises, which conclude on Sept.
12. Military sources said 1,300 American and 2,700 Honduran soldiers
are participating in the maneuvers.

<TEXT>
   A fire destroyed two Main Street
buildings early Saturday on this popular resort island in northern
Lake Huron, killing a man and a woman, authorities said.
   The bodies were found on the second floor of the LaSalle
Building, where the fire broke out about 3 a.m. Saturday, said Pam
Brown, a dispatcher with the City of Mackinac Island Police
Department. The building, and one next door that also was destroyed,
both contain shops that cater to the thousands of tourists that
visit the island each year.
   The victims were identified as Stephen S. Kinney, 22, of
Muskegon, and Michelle A. Krizan, 21, of Kentwood. Several
firefighters suffered smoke inhalation, but none required
hospitalization and no other injuries were reported, she said.
   Firefighters, aided by rain that began falling later Saturday
morning, contained the blaze by 10 a.m. and extinguished it an hour
later, Brown said. The cause remained under investigation.
   Frank Nephew, owner of the LaSalle Building, said the second
floor contained rooms rented to as many as 30 employees during the
summer tourism season. Fewer than six employees were in the building
Saturday, he said, adding: ``Most of them are gone, thank God.
Sometimes these kids just check out and leave without telling
anybody.''
   ``I believe everyone else has been accounted for,'' Brown said.
   In addition to the two buildings that were destroyed, other
buildings sustained smoke and water damage.
   Most motorized vehicles are banned from the island, which has
only about 400 year-round residents. But its fire department has
four trucks, including one formerly owned by a Detroit suburb that
was delivered just Friday.
   ``I want to thank all the firefighters, both our own volunteers
and our neighbors, for saving Main Street,'' Mayor Margaret Doud
said in a statement. ``It is providential that only yesterday we
received a fire truck through the state Legislature from
Southfield.''
   The island is located in the Straits of Mackinac connecting lakes
Huron and Michigan and accessible primarily by passenger ferry.
Incoming visitors were banned from using the ferries while the
vessels transported firefighters and equipment from St. Ignace on
the Upper Peninsula mainland.
   Passenger service to and from the island resumed by 1 p.m., Brown
said.
   The island is best known for the century-old landmark Grand
Hotel, with a huge porch that was at one time billed as the longest
porch in the world. The hotel is on a hill some distance from the
site of the fire.

   More than half of Americans think President Bush
is shortchanging his anti-drug program and nearly three out of four
favor higher taxes on cigarettes and alcohol to pay for it,
according to a Newsweek poll released Saturday.
   Fifty-two percent of those polled said the anti-drug program
announced by Bush this week ``proposes spending too little money for
such a big problem,'' although 83 percent agreed ``it was a good
first step.''
   To pay for an anti-drug program, the poll showed that 73 percent
would support raising federal taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic
beverages and 65 percent said they would support a 1 percent surtax
on corporate income taxes.
   But 63 percent would oppose a 1 percent surtax on personal income
tax for the same purpose, the poll found.
   The poll showed that 86 percent of Americans say they would be
willing to take random, voluntary drug tests. Sixty-two percent
would support mandatory drug tests for public school students, while
36 percent would oppose this measure.
   The Newsweek poll, conducted by the Gallup Organization,
interviewed 609 adults Sept. 7-8. The margin of error is plus or
minus 4 percentage points.

   Two Missouri teen-agers drowned in separate incidents while
playing in flood-swollen waters, and at least seven people were
injured in Indiana, one by lightning, as a powerful thunderstorm
moved through Saturday.
   Bryan Hammer, 18, of Gladstone, Mo., was killed when he was
pulled into the 7-feet-deep Line Creek in Kansas City, Mo.,
authorities said.
   Hammer's roommate, Mike Marquez, said the two had gone to the
creek about midnight.
   ``We were out late and had nothing else to do, so we thought we'd
mess around in the water,'' Marquez said.
   Up to 4 inches of rain fell in the Kansas City area overnight.
   A 13-year-old North Kansas City boy died when he was swept into a
storm drain Friday night. Robert Ragsdale was pronounced dead about
7 p.m. at North Kansas City Hospital.
   Ragsdale and a friend ``were riding the drainage ditch like a
water slide and the water current just got too strong,'' said Bob
Jones, a spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department.
   In Indiana, the storm sparked flash flooding and cut electrical
power in Indianapolis.
   An unidentified 14-year-old girl was treated and released after
lightning struck near her during halftime of Saturday's football
game between Miami of Ohio and Purdue in Lafayette, officials said.
   And in New Palestine, between six and eight people received minor
injuries when gusting winds knocked down a tent at a festival,
police said.

<HEAD>New Premier Named in Algeria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid, trying to
come to grips with a stubborn economic crisis, on Saturday sacked
his government and named a senior aide, Mouloud Hamrouche, as
Algeria's new premier.
   A communique issued by the presidency indicated Premier Kasdi
Merbah was removed because of the slow pace of political and
economic change, launched after riots swept the country in October,
1988. Merbah had been in office since November.
   The president called on the new premier to adopt the reforms,
which were approved in February. They were designed to transform
Algeria into a multiparty democracy from the one-party Socialist
state it has been since independence from France in 1962.
   Hamrouche, 46, had been Bendjedid's chief of staff since 1986.
   The new premier has extensive military and political experience.
At the age of 15, he joined the ruling National Liberation Army to
fight in Algeria's eight-year war for independence from France.
   He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and earned degrees in
law and political science.
   In 1979, at the fourth congress of the National Liberation Front,
Hamrouche was elected an alternate member of the party Central
Committee. He became a full member at the next congress in 1984.
   He was named secretary-general of the government in 1984, and
chief of staff of the presidency in 1986.
   The job of premier will not be easy. Algeria is in the midst of a
severe economic crisis, in large part because of plummeting oil
prices. Petroleum is Algeria's only export.
   For years, oil income propped up Algeria's economy and paid for
imports of basic items such as wheat, milk and meat. The drop in oil
income in recent years has led to cuts in imports.
   Economic grievances sparked the 1988 riots in which 159 people
died.

   The wreckage of a
military plane that disappeared more than two weeks ago was
discovered Saturday in the Southern California mountains, officials
said.
   Two bodies found at the scene were tentatively identified as the
two crew members from the reconnaissance plane, said Lt. Gene
Browne, spokesman for the El Toro base.
   The plane, an OV-10A assigned to the 3rd Marine Aircraft wing,
left Camp Pendleton on Aug. 24 for a three-hour mission and was
never heard from again.
   The plane was discovered in the San Gorgonio wilderness.
   San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department officials and the
military both took credit for finding the airplane.
   Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Singley spotted the crash site on the
5,300-foot-high ridge line of San Gorgonio Mountain between Banning
and Big Bear Lake, Bryant said. The San Gorgonio wilderness is 60
miles northeast of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station and about 90
miles east of Los Angeles.
   The mission crewmen were Capt. Sergio R. Vivaldi, 29, of Port
Chester, N.Y., the pilot, and 1st Lt. Joel H. Piehl, 31, of Fargo,
N.D., the observer.
   The aircraft was on a visual reconnaissance training mission that
could have covered an area from Camp Pendleton east toward the
Colorado River, north toward Las Vegas and south to the Mexican
border.

<HEAD>Protesters Demonstrate Peacefully in Bensonhurst</HEAD>

   About 300 people marched through a New York City
neighborhood Saturday to protest again the racial slaying of a black
teen-ager, but this time the demonstration was peaceful.
   Also Saturday, an unarmed robbery suspect who was resisting
arrest died after being subdued by police officers, police said.
Witnesses said the man was kicked and beaten by the officers, who
shackled his hands and feet and then shouted insults and racial
epithets.
   In a similar protest staged a week ago in the New York City
borough of Brooklyn, residents of the predominantly white
Bensonhurst heckled, taunted and shoved the mostly black marchers.
   Residents Saturday refrained from violence and catcalls as they
watched the chanting, sign-carrying protesters.
   The demonstrators walked past the spot where Yusuf Hawkins, 16,
was shot and killed Aug. 23 after he and three friends were
surrounded by a group of whites carrying baseball bats and at least
one gun.
   Hawkins had gone to the neighborhood to look at a used car for
sale.
   Four white youths face murder charges in the case.
   In Saturday's incident, police said their initial investigation
into the death of Henry Hughes, 25, who is black, indicated he had
not been beaten.
   Assistant Chief John J. Holmes said Hughes was chased and caught
by the officers, then was ``fighting so strongly'' that they could
not get one set of handcuffs on him and had to use two handcuffs
linked together.
   A witness, Steven Perez, 27, said he was across the street and
saw three officers _ a woman and two men _ beating, kicking and
using nightsticks on the man for as long as an hour, while other
officers stood by.
   ``They killed him for no reason,'' said another witness, Victor
Vega, who said he was waiting at a bus stop when the suspect and
police ran by.
   Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office,
said a preliminary examination of Hughes' body indicated no obvious
death-causing injuries.

<TEXT>
   U.S. military troops may be given an expanded
role in the Latin American drug war, according to a secret section
of President Bush's anti-drug program quoted in a published report.
   A National Security Decision Directive signed by Bush would
authorize U.S. Special Forces to accompany local forces on some
narcotics patrols, The Washington Post reported in its Sunday
editions.
   The directive would allow deployment of U.S. military in
``secure'' areas of Peru's Upper Huallagua Valley, a coca-growing
jungle that U.S. officials have acknowledged is ``effectively
controlled'' by far-leftist Shining Path guerrillas, the unnamed
sources told the newspaper.
   Officials estimate that more than half the cocaine consumed in
the United States comes from coca grown in the Upper Huallagua.
   A senior administration official quoted by the Post said the
directive doesn't call for any combat role for U.S. troops or covert
operations in Peru, Bolivia or Colombia.
   But the official, who was not named, said as many as ``several
hundred'' U.S. military trainers, advisers and other support
personnel may be deployed to the three countries under the ``Andean
initiative'' announced by Bush.
   A National Security Decision Directive conveys a presidential
decision to key government officials who must implement it.
   Bush unveiled his anti-drug strategy in a nationally televised
address last Tuesday, but a portion of the program remains
classified.
   The administration has said repeatedly in recent weeks that it
would not consider sending U.S. combat troops to Colombia unless
that country made such a request. Colombian President Virgilio
Barco, whose government is waging a bloody war with drug
traffickers, has said he does not want U.S. troops.
   There has been no public discussion about U.S. military troops in
Peru or Bolivia.
   Administration and congressional sources told the Post that the
directive calls for enhanced involvement by the Pentagon and U.S.
intelligence agencies in the drug effort and includes language that
loosens rules for U.S. troops in the Andean region.
   A rotating team of about a dozen U.S. Special Forces from the
Southern Command in Panama has been based in Bolivia's Chapare
region for about two years to help train that nation's
anti-narcotics police. Under existing rules, U.S. troops are
restricted to their base camp and are prohibited from accompanying
the local police on patrols.
   The directive relaxes those rules, permitting the U.S. military
to accompany troops on ``routine'' patrols, the Post said. However,
it does not allow U.S. military to direct raids or attacks on drug
labs or trafficker hideouts, an official told the newspaper.
   In addition, the Post reported, the directive would permit the
deployment of the Special Troops in ``secure'' or ``safe haven''
areas of the Upper Huallaga Valley, including a newly fortified base
at Santa Lucia used as the staging ground for joint raids by
Peruvian police and a small team of Drug Enforcement Administration
agents.
   During internal debates, DEA and some State Department officials
argued against deploying U.S. troops in Peru, saying it would give
the guerrillas American targets, the newspaper said.

   Police used tear gas to turn
back demonstrators who burned temporary housing and overturned cars
Saturday in a protest of the hiring of non-union construction labor
at a Boise Cascade paper mill.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich put the National Guard on alert for possible
duty in the usually peaceful town on the Canadian border. But the
crowd, estimated at 400 in the morning, dwindled by afternoon and
city officials said the violence had ended.
   Police Chief Tom Hardy said officers used tear gas to turn back
the crowd and witnesses said protesters threw rocks at security
guards. A police dispatcher said several vehicles were overturned at
the housing camp about a mile from the construction site.
   Five people were treated at Memorial Hospital for various
injuries and released, said hospital administrator Randy Olson.
Koochiching County Sheriff Bill Elliott said 32 people were arrested
on charges of criminal damage to property and contempt of court.
   The violence stemmed from Boise's hiring of a non-union general
contractor for a $535 million expansion project at the paper mill, a
move that sparked a wildcat strike by union members in July. Since
then the company has been hit by sporadic violence including an
arson fire that caused an estimated $250,000 damage.
   Police expected to make more arrests after reviewing videotapes
of the violence, Elliott said.
   Mayor Jack Murray, in a statement read to local radio stations
Saturday morning, urged the town's 6,500 residents to stay in their
homes and asked bars and liquor stores not to serve liquor that day.
   ``You don't have a lot of control in this situation,'' Elliott
said. ``The people involved in it showed no respect for the law or
for International Falls.''
   About 45 officers from several jurisdictions were on hand, he
said, but ``we could have had all the police manpower in northern
Minnesota and still it wouldn't have been enough.''
   Union officials say they have tried to dissuade protesters from
violence or mass demonstrations in International Falls. There was no
immediate comment Saturday from Brad Skarich, president of the Iron
Range Building Trades Council, and Bill Peterson, head of the
Minnesota Building Trades Council; Skarich did not return a message
left on his home answering machine and there was no answer at
Peterson's office.
   Protesters pushed through a gate at a temporary housing complex
being set up for construction workers and tore down part of the
fence surrounding the camp.
   Boise Cascade spokesman Bob Anderson said eight to 10 mobile
homes in the camp were destroyed, including some that were ``totally
burned to the ground.'' He estimated that the facility, intended to
eventually house about 1,000 people and include a cafeteria, was 60
percent destroyed.
   The 100 workers already living there were removed Friday night in
anticipation of trouble, Anderson said. Boise also canceled work
Saturday at the project, he said.
   Police as a precaution Saturday morning evacuated an apartment
building leased largely to workers hired by BE&amp;K, the construction
project's general contractor, said police Capt. Randy Borden. He
could not say how many people were evacuated.
   ``The building trade activists from the area have just gone
berserk,'' said Anderson.
   ``It was non-union and racially motivated,'' Anderson said.
``People destroyed property and went after lives. We've had many
people threatened. It's been building trades activists that are just
acting as terrorists.''
   Anderson said a black family was threatened Saturday and the
company moved them inside the plant for protection. Police were
previously called to a Mexican-American family's home after an arson
threat, he said.
   He said there had been complaints that the company was only
hiring blacks and Hispanics.
   Borden said three black people were the targets of ``a lot of
name-calling and yelling'' when the apartment building was
evacuated. He said racial elements ``certainly come forth when
there's a confrontation, but how much that motivates it, I'm not in
any position to evaluate.''
   Elliott dismissed allegations that the riots had any racial
overtones. ``Someone might have made a remark about blacks,'' he
said, but added that racism wasn't linked to the rioting.
   By 6 p.m., state officials sent to International Falls told
Perpich that the situation was under control and that ``it is not
necessary to move additional resources into the area at the present
time,'' according to a statement from the governor's office. Guard
members will remain on standby, the statement said.
   Anderson complained that the governor was ``playing politics''
and siding with labor by not immediately sending National Guardsmen,
only putting them on alert. Although the situation had calmed by
afternoon, Anderson said protesters were drinking and he thought
more violence could erupt.
   Anderson said Saturday's protesters had come from North Dakota,
Wisconsin and Michigan.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of oil-spattered workers
hampered by worsening weather have only a few more days to clean
crude oil off Alaska's petroleum-fouled shoreline before Exxon Corp.
stops work for the season.
   Exxon says it will pull out the last of its workers by this
coming Friday after treating more than 1,000 miles of shoreline
tainted by the nation's worst oil spill. The company claimed
Thursday that only four miles remained to be treated, but state and
federal agencies disagree with Exxon about how much has been cleaned
and how well.
   ``Our position is that the weather is going to make us go
regardless of what the numbers are, regardless of how much is
left,'' said Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard.
   Exxon said it chose Sept. 15 for the withdrawal of the last of
its thousands of workers and hundreds of vessels to avoid
increasingly poor weather and reduced hours of daylight. In this
land where winter comes early, the first dusting of snow can already
be seen in some higher elevations.
   ``We have buses and planes set up for them to leave that day,''
Beathard said. ``They don't have the option to take that free trip
three days later.'' Already, the first fall storm has raked Prince
William Sound, where the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil on March 24. Gusts to 70 mph and 6-to
10-foot seas shut down the Point Helen cleanup operation once. On
Smith Island, a test of a solvent Exxon wants to use to clean oily
shores was delayed for at least four days by the storm.
   Point Helen, one of the last heavily hit shorelines on the
cleanup list, was left untouched until after mid-August to avoid
disturbing a fish hatchery at Sawmill Bay, officials said.
   Weather permitting, the shore will be ``environmentally stable,''
if not clean, by Exxon's deadline, the company said.
   ``I'm quite confident we are going to make it _ if we can just
get a few good days of weather,'' said beachmaster Warren Winstead
of Baton Rouge, La. ``I think if we can get another few days in,
we'll beat it.''
   But the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and Exxon
dispute just about everything, including how many miles have been
treated, how well the job has been done and whether Exxon plans to
duck out after giving the shore a quick once-over.
   The state has sued Exxon and a half-dozen other oil companies
that get oil from Alaska's North Slope by way of the Alyeska
pipeline, claiming they were negligent in preventing and cleaning up
the spill. The Exxon Valdez was outbound from the pipeline terminal
at Valdez when it ripped its bottom open on a reef.
   On Saturday, environmental and fishing groups took two dozen
boats into Port Valdez for a demonstration demanding greater
protection against oil spills.
   Organizers of the event held with Coast Guard permission said
their main goal was to draw attention to tankers of foreign registry
that travel in and out of the port, terminus of the trans-Alaska oil
pipeline.
   Seven vessels that are registered in Italy, Liberia and Israel
and use the port are not regulated adequately and do not carry
sufficient liability insurance for oil-spill compensation, said
Nancy Lethcoe, vice president of the Prince William Sound
Conservation Alliance and a partner in a local tourism business. The
Coast Guard said a total of 70 tankers use the port.
   Crews have removed gross contamination from many shorelines, but
they remain oily. Exxon claims about 244,000 gallons of oil and
water emulsion have been recovered.
   Exxon, the DEC and the Coast Guard all have different figures for
virtually everything, in part because they use different criteria
for measuring contamination and what constitutes an effective
cleanup. The state agency's figures show Exxon claiming to have
treated more shoreline than was fouled.
   ``We're the only people honest about the numbers,'' said Joe
Bridgeman, a DEC spokesman. ``The numbers are being manipulated to
show great shoreline progress.''
   Exxon officials acknowledged discrepancies. ``I honestly don't
have an adequate explantion,'' said spokesman Karsten Rodvik.
   As the cleanup operation grinds down from its peak of 12,000
workers and 1,300 vessels, Valdez officials are bracing for a
shrunken economy.
   Temporary housing set up by Exxon will close. The Valdez
population likely will plunge from 13,000 to about 4,500.
   Public agencies are getting ready to pare their staffs to winter
levels, although some work will continue. Scientists are studying
the effects of fertilizer spread on test beaches to stimulate the
growth of oil-eating bacteria. Other agencies plan to collect
samples and study the environment during the winter.
   Otter and bird rescue operations are shutting down. More than
32,000 birds and 980 otters died from the spill's effects.
   Exxon has started shipping millions of pounds of equipment to
winter storage in Anchorage, home of its Alaska headquarters.
   State environmental officials say Exxon's withdrawal is premature
and that it should stay on the job as long as the weather permits.
``We don't buy the deadline. We not only want them to come back next
year. We want them to work past Sept. 15,'' Bridgeman said.
   Over the winter Exxon plans to monitor how the shoreline looks.
It has made no commitment to come back next summer but says it will
abide by any reasonable decision of the Coast Guard on whether more
cleanup is necessary.
   The price tag for this summer's cleanup is expected to top $1.2
billion and the effort has become an industry of its own.
   Exxon's spending spree was felt statewide and helped lower
unemployment, said state labor economist Neal Fried. In Valdez and
Cordova, unemployment was about half the previous year's level.
   Exxon has paid more than $90 million in damage claims so far, and
is paying up to $3 million a day, about two-thirds directly to
fishermen who were kept in port by oil-covered water.
   Exxon bought 302,000 pairs of rubber gloves, 167,000 sets of rain
gear, 73,000 pairs of rubber boots, 125,000 coveralls and 53,000
life vests.
   The company said it purchased more than 12 million pounds of
groceries, amounting to 1,000 cows, 360,000 chickens, 1,000 turkeys
and 700 pigs. Washing machines agitated more than 3 million pounds
of laundry, and equipment consumed more than 400,000 gallons of
diesel fuel each week.

<HEAD>Sailor's Letter Says Iowa Crew Doesn't Believe Hartwig Caused Explosion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Iowa Inquiry, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sailors aboard the USS Iowa don't believe
Clayton M. Hartwig caused the explosion on the ship that killed 47
sailors, according to a letter sent to Hartwig's sister and revealed
Saturday.
   The Pentagon released a report Thursday on the gun turret
explosion that said circumstantial evidence indicated Hartwig
intentionally caused the blast. Hartwig, a gunner's mate, died in
the April 19 explosion.
   Kathleen Kubicina, Hartwig's sister, said she got a letter dated
Aug. 27 from a sailor she would identify only as ``Tom'' that said
crew members did not believe Hartwig was capable of causing the
explosion.
   ``The people on board who knew him believe as I do that the idea
of Clay being capable of such a crime is insane,'' the sailor wrote.
``I don't know what the reults of the investigation will be, but it
will not change mine or a lot of this crew's minds as to what we
believe could never have happened because we knew Clay.''
   Ms. Kubicina said the author's mother would not allow her son's
last name to be released for fear of retaliation from the Navy. Ms.
Kubicina provided a copy of the letter to The Associated Press.
   The Iowa left its Norfolk, Va., homeport in June for six months
in the Mediterranean Sea.
   ``When I first read it I felt this incredible relief,'' Ms.
Kubicina said. ``Even though it was written before the report was
released, it shows a lot of the guys support our position. It made a
world of difference to know the guys support me.''
   Ms. Kubicina and Hartwig's father, Earl, have said they believe
the Navy sought a scapegoat and blamed Hartwig for the explosion
that caused the biggest loss of live in the Navy since the Vietnam
War.
   Ms. Kubicina said the family planned to file a defamation of
character lawsuit against the Navy for alleging Hartwig may have
caused the explosion.
   ``We will file because this has caused undue emotional distress
to the family,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old nurse who testified as a witness
to the 1988 massacre of 29 peasants, allegedly by army troops, was
shot and killed at her home in Ayacucho, police said Saturday.
   They also reported at least three people were killed in clashes
involving rebels of the Maoist Shining Path movement and police near
Huancayo.
   Martha Crisostomo was believed to have been the last living
witness who testified to investigators about the May 15, 1988,
killings of 29 civilians in the village of Cayara, 230 miles
southeast of Lima.
   Three other people who testified against the army in the
investigation, including Cayara's mayor, were slain earlier this
year.
   According to police, eight armed people wearing hoods broke into
Ms. Crisostomo's home on Friday and fatally shot her and a
companion, Olga Farfan, a high school student.
   Government investigators are examining accusations that soldiers
killed the villagers in reprisal for a rebel ambush of an army
convoy on the outskirts of the town. The government has not issued a
report on its investigation.
   The Shining Path movement launched its armed insurgency in 1980
in the mountainous area around souch-central Ayacucho. The
guerrillas now operate throughout the country's Andean highlands and
in the coca-producing jungles in the northeast.
   By government estimates some 15,000 people, mostly civilians,
have been slain in the fighting.
   Also Saturday, reports published in Lima newspapers said army
unit killed 20 rebels after they attacked a police vehicle near the
anti-drug base at Santa Lucia, 270 miles north of Lima.
   The newspaper El Comercio said soldiers killed 20
``narco-terrorists'' between the towns of Uchiza and Progreso in the
Upper Huallaga River Valley. The valley is the source of much of the
world's coca leaf, the raw product for cocaine.
   The Shining Path allegedly works in alliance with drug
traffickers in the area, offering them protection from police in
exchange for payment.
   In other incidents, a policeman was killed by Shining Path rebels
who interrupted classes at a high school near Huancayo Friday to
urge students to join their movement. Police said they persued the
rebels and killed one of them.
   In Orcotuna, 10 miles from Huancayo, a street vendor was killed
Friday when his stand was dynamited by a group of presumed
terrorists, police said.

   U.N. observers arrived in Honduras
Saturday and prepared to make plans for monitoring the
demobilization of U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.
   About 12,000 Contras and their dependents are living in bases in
Honduras near the Nicaraguan border. Some have expressed reluctance
at accepting the demobilization, agreed to under a peace plan signed
by five Central American presidents in August.
   The observers are to watch over the voluntary repatriation or
relocation of the Contras, who have been fighting the Sandinista
government since 1982. The demobilization is to be completed before
year's end.
   Eugenio Castro Claramount, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the
first group of U.N. observers to arrive included 18 civilians and
soldiers from Brazil, Canada, Fiji, Ireland, Peru, Spain, Sweden and
Venezuela.
   Castro Claramount said the observewrs were arriving on commercial
and military flights and the entire group should be in Honduras by
Sunday.
   The commission members will travel Monday by helicopter and land
to areas along the border with El Salvador and Nicaragua to inspect
the area. Castro Calarmount said the observers will meet with
Honduran officials Wednesday.

   Police gave a job application to an unarmed
bank security guard who chased and tackled a man later booked for
investigation of robbery Saturday, authorities said.
   ``He's the type of guy we're looking for,'' Sgt. Bob Grant said
of the Pinkerton guard, Aundra Spencer.
   A man walked into a Bank of America branch and handed a teller a
withdrawal ticket that read, ``This is a holdup,'' Grant said. The
teller gave the man $1,020, then triggered a silent alarm that
alerted Spencer as the suspect left the branch, he said.
   Spencer chased, tackled and handcuffed the man as onlookers and
subway construction workers cheered him on, the sergeant said. He
then escorted the man back to the bank and forced him to lie on the
floor until police arrived.
   Police later said James Ernest Davis, 44, was booked for
investigation on four counts of bank robbery. Davis was being held
at Parker Center Jail in lieu of $6,000 bail.

   A balcony collapsed on workers sorting fruit
at a packing plant Friday afternoon, killing a woman and injuring
seven other people, authorities said.
   ``It caved in like a wedge, right where everybody was sitting,''
said fire Lt. Al Chronister.
   Five workers, including the woman who died, were trapped beneath
debris at the Hansen Fruit Co. until fire department rescue crews
freed them, Chronister said.
   Chronister estimated that the balcony, which was built into a
wall of the cavernous concrete building, weighed several tons. The
portion that collapsed measured 15-by-15 feet.
   Firefighters continued looking through the rubble, but Chronister
said it was unlikely anyone else was beneath the packing boxes,
fruit sorting trays, wooden pallets and other debris that came
tumbling down.
   At least 60 employees were in the plant, said Barb Dunn of the
state Department of Labor and Industries in Olympia.
   The injured were taken to St. Elizabeth's Medical Center and
Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital. The injuries included a broken arm,
head lacerations and minor cuts and bruises, hospital officials
said. Three victims were listed in serious condition.
   A pregnant woman who suffered bumps on the head and leg was taken
to Yakima Valley Memorial's maternity floor for observation, but was
in good condition.
   One firefighter suffered heat exhaustion, Chronister said.
   The dead woman's name was withheld pending notification of
relatives.
   Ms. Dunn said the cause of the collapse was not known, and the
state agency will investigate.
   The fatality was the first in Washington's fruit-packing industry
since the early 1970s, when record-keeping on accidents began, Ms.
Dunn said.

   Shrimpers blockaded boat traffic Friday to
protest federal requirements that they use turtle-protecting devices
in their nets, and apparently won a promise from visiting President
Bush to review the rules.
   The Coast Guard said 37 vessels up to 100 feet long participated
in the daylong blockade of an industrial waterway near this Gulf
Coast city, but protesters put the number of boats at 50 to 100.
   At one point, 30 vessels were waiting to pass through the
blockade, said Chief Petty Officer Glenn LaMont.
   The protest ended at 5 p.m. after the Coast Guard relayed word
from Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La., that Bush, who was visiting New
Orleans about 50 miles north of here, had agreed to review the
regulations.
   In a meeting with Tauzin and Reps. Lindy Boggs, D-La., and Bob
Livingston, R-La., Bush promised a review of regulations concerning
turtle excluder devices, or TEDS, Tauzin said in a news release.
   The congressman said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu would
meet with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher ``and will hopefully
reach an acceptable balance between the need to conserve endangered
turtle species and allow shrimpers to stay in business.''
   Shrimpers and their supporters in Congress have succeeded in the
past in having TED rules delayed for weeks and sometimes months at a
time. Shrimpers also organized blockades in protest in July.
   About 500 shrimpers from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and
Florida lined the motorcade route used by Bush during his visit
Friday morning.
   No arrests were made and no violence was reported during the
protest, said Coast Guard Cmdr. William Loeftstedt.
   Another 30 to 40 shrimpers blocked the Intracoastal Waterway near
Intracoastal City, La., said Chief Petty Officer Glenn LaMont. No
arrests or violence was reported.
   The blockaders ``were violating the law and those who violate it
could find themselves in trouble if they persist,'' Loeftstedt said.
   Blockading vessels were warned throughout the day to clear a
passage or the vessels could be boarded and crews arrested, said
Cmdr. Dave Smith.
   The Coast Guard gathered names and boat registration numbers of
the protesters. No decision was made on whether to charge them, but
the shrimpers could face civil fines of up to $25,000 if charged,
Loeftstedt said.
   Several angry shrimpers were glad to have the president's ear but
said they were only willing to wait a short while for new rules.
   ``Right now, shrimpers are in a no-win situation,'' said Randy
Adams, captain of the Sunshine Lady. ``They change the rules every
three minutes, and you can't win with any of them. If you pull a
TED, you can't make any money. If you don't, you get fined.''
   Designed to keep endangered sea turtles from being snared and
drowned in shrimp nets, TEDs are cage-like devices with trap doors
and slats designed to deflect turtles out of the nets while
preserving the shrimp catch.
   Shrimpers, however, claim they lose large amounts of shrimp
because of the TEDs, and say they can't afford to operate with them.

   A high-ranking drug trafficker imprisoned
for the past month at the height of the drug crackdown was released
because authorities lacked an extradition request from the United
States, police said.
   The army said Friday it had arrested the pilot of one of the
nation's top cocaine barons and that he had flown cocaine to the
United States.
   In Medellin, home of the powerful drug cartel by the same name,
armed gangs wearing white hoods terrorized the embattled city,
setting fire to nine government vehicles, including trucks and vans.
   The gangs, suspected of working for the drug lords, hurled
firebombs and fired shots in the air. No injuries were reported and
police said they arrested one man.

   Eight committees of the Sejm, or lower house of parliament, held
their first day of hearings Friday and gave a positive

   Further sessions were planned through the weekend to get ready
for a vote Tuesday on the government proposed by Prime Minister

   The Federal Aviation Administration will order
exhaustive inspections of all DC-10 engines as a result of a July
crash in Sioux City, Iowa, that killed 112 people, an agency
official says.
   Anthony Broderick, FAA associate administrator, said in an
interview Friday that the agency expects within a few weeks to order
inspections of the metal in all General Electric CF6-6 engines such
as those in the DC-10 that crash-landed July 19 in Sioux City.
   Broderick said the expected FAA-ordered inspections would take 40
hours each, and could cause some flight disruptions.
   However, officials say the investigation into the crash is being
hampered because a large section of the tail engine of United Flight
232 has not been found.

<TEXT>
   The Bath Iron Works built 83 destroyers in
World War II, more than turned out by all the shipyards of Japan.
This week it launches the lead ship in the Navy's new class of
destroyers, hailed as the world's most advanced surface combat ship
and 200 times more expensive than those built here 4{ decades ago.
   Sailor-turned-shipbuilder Bob Bourget spent three years aboard
one of the ``tin can'' destroyers produced in Bath during the war,
so he speaks from experience when he praises the combat capability
of the ships built in this small city along the Kennebec River.
   Bourget was on the USS Stembel, seeing action in the Pacific from
Tarawa to Okinawa before returning home to build ships at BIW.
Bourget says the durable destroyer is still in service with the
Argentine navy.
   ``That's the same kind of ship they're going to get there except
with a lot more technology,'' Bourget said, pointing to the ways
cradling the Navy's new destroyer, the Arleigh Burke.
   The new ship is to be launched Saturday in a ceremony that will
focus on one of the legendary leaders of World War II.
   Burke, an 87-year-old retired admiral, will be guest of honor at
the launching. His wife, Roberta, will christen the ship, and about
400 veterans who served in Burke's famed ``Little Beavers''
destroyer squadron are scheduled to join him at a post-launch dinner.
   Known as ``31-Knot Burke'' for the speed with which he pushed his
destroyers in pursuit of the Japanese, Burke has kept tabs on the
design and construction of the ship that will bear his name.
   Wide-beamed with a low profile, the 466-foot ship bears little
resemblance to the earlier generations of destroyers. The roughly $1
billion it cost to build is more than double the price of all of the
destroyers built here in World War II, when the yard turned out one
every 17 days at the height of production.
   While critics suggest the nation might be better served by a
larger number of smaller, less expensive ships, Navy and BIW
officials maintain the Arleigh Burke destroyers are being built for
the type of warfare in which threats from aircraft, submarines and
surface ships must be dealt with instantly.
   ``It's really the first surface ship that's been designed and
built to meet the warfare requirements of the 21st century,'' said
William E. Haggett, BIW chairman and chief executive officer.
   Much of the cost is earmarked for sophisticated Aegis computers,
electronics and weaponry including Tomahawk cruise missiles,
anti-aircraft missiles, anti-submarine torpedoes and a .54-caliber
gun.
   To enhance its prospects of survival, the 8,500-ton Arleigh Burke
was designed with a more expensive all-steel superstructure instead
of one that was part aluminum and would be more prone to splintering
and fire damage. Designers also built in better protection against
nuclear blast, radioactive fallout and chemical warfare agents.
   Haggett says ships of the future must have capabilities far more
advanced than those of today's fleet.
   ``They have to be able to detect, engage and eliminate targets
that can come from any direction, at almost any speed and in large
numbers. A lot of inferior ships out there in the kind of battle a
destroyer is designed to engage in would be meaningless.
   ``This ship is as capable as perhaps 20 or 40 ships that are of
an older design,'' he said.
   The Arleigh Burke program is also seen as the key to future
prosperity of the 105-year-old shipyard, which has found itself
competing for a dwindling number of Navy contracts at a time when
civilian ship construction is virtually non-existent in the United
States.
   While other major yards have closed or gone into bankruptcy, Bath
and its archrival, Litton's Ingalls Shipbuilding Division in
Mississippi, are among a handful of survivors.
   Thanks to its participation, with Ingalls, in the Aegis cruiser
program, BIW now has a $2 billion construction backlog and a
workforce that remains at a peacetime high of 11,000.
   But with cruiser construction winding down, the Aegis destroyer
program was viewed as vital because it was seen as the last surface
ship the Navy plans to build for some time.
   Unlike the cruisers, which combined the Aegis systems with the
modified design of an existing destroyer, the Arleigh Burke is an
entirely new ship designed from the keel up to accommodate the
advanced technology.
   Winning the contract for design and construction of the lead ship
gave BIW a leg up and the yard now has contracts for five of the
destroyers to Ingalls' three. Haggett said the Navy plans to build
five more per year for an indefinite period and his yard plans to
compete vigorously for its share of the contracts.
   Haggett said the Arleigh Burke, scheduled for delivery in 1991,
is the kind of ship that would make a potential adversary think
twice before challenging it.
   ``Probably the greatest value of these Aegis ships is that they
are so good that they become a very meaningful deterrent to any kind
of hostilities,'' he said.

   The Replacements, four rock 'n' roll bad boys
beloved by college radio stations, worshipped by a musical
underground but known by few others, might just make the big time.
   Then again, maybe not.
   The Minneapolis quartet, which started out in 1980 with fast,
rough, thrashy rock tunes colored with adolescent anger and wit,
released its seventh album this year _ the third with Warner Bros.
subsidiary Sire Records _ and spent the summer touring with Tom
Petty.
   Musician Magazine, in a cover story in February, proclaimed
portentously that they were the ``last, best band of the '80s.''
   No doubt they are the closest ever to major recognition in the
mainstream market. But lead singer and songwriter Paul Westerberg
said their brush with success could be shoved aside for another
pursuit, namely obscurity.
   ``We don't embrace success,'' he said over breakfast, his voice
deep and hoarse, cut rough from a performance the night before. ``If
it happens, it happens. We aren't really trying to kill ourselves to
get it.''
   Such a nonchalant attitude may sound a bit self-defeating, but
it's not that the Replacements welcome failure.
   Success, Westerberg said, can be a trap.
   For instance, on ``Don't Tell a Soul,'' their latest album, there
was a major push by Warner and the band to get the single ``I'll Be
You'' high on the charts. Album sales passed a respectable 350,000,
but ``I'll Be You'' didn't do well on the charts.
   ``When `I'll Be You' dropped off the Top 40 I was going, `Damn,'
'' Westerberg said. ``But now I go, `Great,' because now it's not
like `I'll Be You' is No. 1 and I'll have to play it for the rest of
my life. Next year no one will even remember it so I can play
whatever I want.''
   The Replacements were discovered when Westerberg gave a tape to
Peter Jesperson, who was booking bands at a Minneapolis nightclub
and had a small record label called Twintone. Jesperson recalled
that Westerberg was hoping to get a $25 gig warming up for one of
the top-billed groups.
   But after the first play, ``I immediately called them back and
said, `Were you thinking of 45 or album?'''
   ``I swear it was about 20 seconds into the first song that
something got me deep down. I actually called three of my best
musical pals at the time and said, `You have to come over right now.
Either I'm out of my mind or this is the greatest rock band I've
heard in ages.' It was a real inspirational moment, one I'd consider
calling magic.''
   Jesperson managed the band for six years, going to almost every
gig as they crisscrossed the country playing smaller venues and
building a reputation for their chaotic, unpredictable and often
drunken shows.
   Stories abounded about the recklessness of the young band _
bassist Tommy Stinson was just 12 years old and Westerberg, the
oldest, was 20. Former lead guitarist Bob Stinson, Tommy's older
brother, was often the ringleader, showing up for gigs smashed. He
once performed in the nude.
   He was kicked out of the band when he ``couldn't adapt to more
tasteful or quieter things,'' Westerberg said, and now has a band in
Minneapolis called Static Taxi.
   The spectacle of Westerberg's highwire act also was a big draw.
Reeling drunk, he'd often forget words of a song halfway through.
Sometimes they would refuse to play their own tunes and launch into
an hour of covers like ``Yummy Yummy'' or ``Hitchin' a Ride.''
   Once the band reportedly stopped suddenly, gave their instruments
to the audience and told them to play. Another tale has it that
Westerberg tossed all the cash from his pockets to the audience and
told the crowd to ask for a refund because they played so badly.
   But he had enough savvy to know it's not necessarily what you
play but how you play it that counts and if you're lucky the crowd
will remember both.
   ``We did it because we wanted to make an impact. If we played on
the weekend, we wanted to make sure there were people talking about
us on Monday. If that meant being absolutely horrid, than that's
what we'd do.''
   And, adding another essential ingredient of the classic rock 'n'
roll fable, the outrageous shows helped disguise the fact that they
didn't know how to play their instruments.
   ``When we started we weren't good musicians,'' Westerberg said.
``We were smart enough to realize that playing your instrument is
not going to get us anywhere. So we just created a smoke screen
until we learned how to play.''
   While they learned to play, Westerberg learned to write better
songs. The first albums, ``Sorry Ma, Forgot to Throw Out the
Trash,'' ``The Replacements Stink'' and ``Hootenanny'' often
chronicled an inane, silly side of youth with songs like ``More
Cigarettes,'' ``Hangin Downtown'' and ``Dope Smokin' Moron.''
   But in the last few, ``Tim,'' ``Pleased to Meet Me,'' and ``Don't
Tell a Soul,'' Westerberg reflects the loss of a friend to suicide,
the conflicts of commercialism, romantic longing and loneliness.
   In ``I Don't Know,'' from ``Pleased to Meet Me,'' he talks about
the band's precarious position straddling corporate, record-industry
success after being so aligned with scrapy rock 'n' rollers: ``One
foot in the door, the other in the gutter, the sweet smell you
adore, I think I'd rather smother.''

   It sounds like the plot of a steamy novel:
dashing doctor finds success and riches in small-town America, leads
charmed life until sex scandal erupts _ and he's in the middle of it.
   But it's fact, not fiction in this tranquil town.
   The protagonist is Dr. Pravin Thakkar, accused of gross
negligence, lewd conduct, rape and other offenses against more than
a dozen women. Many are ex-patients. In some cases, women he dated
say he impregnated them and then performed abortions without their
consent.
   ``We've had lewd and immoral allegations before ... but never in
this volume against one man,'' said Dan Foley, assistant to state
Attorney General Linley Pearson, whose office filed a complaint
against Thakkar.
   Thakkar, whose license has been temporarily suspended, denies the
charges and says he'll be vindicated.
   ``You are giving a forum to people who are lying ... (and trying)
to cash in,'' he said. ``These are not the facts.''
   Jeffrey Lockwood, his attorney, added, ``Many of the allegations,
if not all of them, are not worthy of belief.''
   Madison County Prosecutor William Lawler says charges involving
five women and a sixth unrelated accusation will likely be presented
to a grand jury within several weeks.
   A 23-count state complaint pending before the Indiana Medical
Licensing Board accuses him of a litany of misconduct, including:
prescribing an addictive drug to a patient as long as she would have
pelvic exams; fondling patients in the examining room; forcing a
woman to have sex in her house; impregnating women, then performing
unwanted abortions.
   Separate suits and malpractice claims are pending against Thakkar.
   He also faces an October trial on charges that he withdrew more
than $132,000 from his bank accounts in a way that allegedly skirted
federal rules on reporting withdrawals.
   Many of Thakkar's accusers came forward at a February state board
hearing that resulted in the temporary suspension of his license. A
hearing on whether to revoke the license has not been scheduled.
   One panel member called it ``probably the worst abuse of
physician-patient trust'' he'd seen. The board called Thakkar ``a
clear and immediate danger to the public health and safety.''
   ``The commonality of all of their stories was pretty
convincing,'' Foley said.
   Since then, the Indianapolis Star reported Thakkar left an Ohio
medical training program in 1980 amid charges he had a sexual
encounter with a patient and mishandled a case in which a woman
hemorrhaged to death after giving birth.
   Court records claim Thakkar left a Texas medical residency
program in 1981 after a patient complained he made sexual comments
and was known as a doctor who ``would conduct a pelvic exam for a
head cold.''
   Carmen Brutchen Hertzinger, a divorced teacher's aide, claims
Thakkar impregnated her in 1983, then pressured her to have an
abortion.
   ``I said, `No way. I want this baby. I love you,''' she recalled.
   When she refused, she claims he drugged her, induced labor
without her consent and delivered an 8-month-old fetus. She contends
she heard a cry, but never saw the baby and Thakkar told her it was
stillborn and claimed to have ``six bullets'' to kill her, others
and himself if she revealed what happened.
   Ms. Hertzinger has sued Thakkar. He has responded with a slander
suit, claiming she was still pregnant more than a month after the
alleged abortion.
   ``I think he specifically sought out women who were emotionally
vulnerable,'' said Bonnie Coffey-Myers, who answered a personal ad
Thakkar placed in ``Indianapolis Monthly'' magazine.
   ``I was overweight, divorced, raising two kids on my own ...
attracting the attention of a healthy, intelligent, wealthy,
powerful physician,'' she said. ``It's every woman's dream.''
   Ms. Coffey-Myers said after she became pregnant, Thakkar told her
he'd perform an abortion but would have to falsify records because
the procedure wasn't allowed at the hospital.
   Despite the allegations, Thakkar has supporters.
   He's ``one of the finest doctors I've ever had,'' Joyce Thompson
wrote in a local newspaper letter. ``He's always been there when
needed _ taken great care and showed genuine concern for me.''
   But Thakkar's lawyer said such support may have little impact.
``He's already been tried and convicted in the press,'' Lockwood
said, noting some of his client's accusers have made the
Oprah-Geraldo talk show circuit.
   ``A small group of people are getting an awful lot of media
attention and ... feel they're going to get an awful lot of money
from the doctor.''
   Pravin Thakkar, 38, came to this central Indiana town of 2,000 in
1981, replacing the only doctor, who had died.
   ``He was a congenial sort of person,'' said Gerald Harper, a
member of the Lions Club, which organized a doctor-search committee.
``He seemed very ... settled in his ways.'' Thakkar was married at
the time and he has a child.
   ``He seemed like he cared about whether you were ill and he would
be available whenever possible,'' said Betty Janney, clerk-treasurer
in nearby Gaston, where he had a part-time practice.
   The man who had known poverty in India built a prosperous
practice, earning a reported gross annual income of $500,000.
   Some women met him as a patient but Thakkar also placed blind-box
newspaper and magazine ads _ he met his current fiancee through one
_ describing himself as filled with ``dreams, love &amp; sensitivity.''
   For some, the 5-foot-6, graying doctor lived up to his claims,
wooing women with soft music, sweet words and a soothing manner.
   ``It's almost like having a spell put over you,'' Ms. Hertzinger
said.
   ``He was like no other man I'd ever met,'' said Kathy Collins,
the first to sue Thakkar. ```He was very soft. He was very caring.''
   Ms. Collins says she met Thakkar as a patient and after years of
on-and-off dating, became pregnant. When she told him, she says he
aborted the fetus without her consent.
   ``I hurt so bad inside, I knew I had to do something,'' she
explained. ``I just knew that I couldn't go on knowing what he did
and letting him get away with it.''
   Her suit opened the floodgates. Many allegations are several
years old, raising questions as to why some women waited so long and
continued to see him as their doctor.
   ``If they thought he was a heel ... why did they go back to
him?'' asked Harper of the Lions Club. ``It just don't make sense.''
   Some of the women cited financial reasons. Coffey-Myers said
Thakkar agreed to do her tubal ligation for whatever fee her
insurance would cover.
   Some feared they wouldn't be believed challenging a doctor.
``Once they saw others coming forward, (they thought) if they banded
together with other folks, maybe something would be done,'' added
Foley, the attorney general's aide.
   Today, they have mixed feelings about Thakkar.
   ``My attitude ranges from pity to hatred,'' said Ms.
Coffey-Myers. ``Perhaps some of us were naive and gave him the
benefit of the doubt too many times. That doesn't mean any of us
deserved what we got. I feel much the same way a rape victim does.''

<HEAD>Give Great Plains Back to the Buffalo, They Propose</HEAD>

   If Deborah Epstein Popper and Frank Popper
weren't from New Jersey, it might be easier to win converts to their
notion that the Great Plains ought to be emptied of people and given
back to the buffalo and the tall grasses.
   But the Poppers are professors at Rutgers University in New
Jersey, a state that is the butt of more than a few jokes, and that
makes them easy targets for more of the same.
   Prominent among their critics is Rep. Pat Roberts, a Republican
who represents most of western Kansas, and who says that every time
the region goes through hard times ``you get another think-tank
effort to send us back to the buffalo.''
   ``We still believe Woody Allen was joking when he claimed every
place has redeeming social value `with the possible exception of New
Jersey,''' the congressman wrote to The Washington Post. ``We only
hope the Poppers were joking as well.''
   The Fargo Forum in North Dakota suggested in an editorial that
instead of letting the Plains slip back into grasslands, New Jersey
might be turned into a vast gasoline storage area.
   A Montana paper suggested paving over the Garden State.
   The High Plains Journal of Dodge City, Kan., called the plan ``a
real buffalo pie in the sky idea.'' And Mike Hayden, governor of
Kansas, said, ``I can only conclude their suggestions were in jest.''
   Not at all. The Poppers _ he's Harvard-educated, originally from
Chicago, and teaches urban studies; she's from New York, did
graduate work at Rutgers and teaches geography _ are serious.
   ``We believe that over the next generation the Plains will, as a
result of the largest, longest-running agricultural and
environmental miscalculation in America, become almost totally
depopulated,'' they wrote in Planning magazine, published by the
American Planning Association.
   It was a historic mistake, they say, to break the sod _ a process
started by the 1862 Homestead Act, which gave 160 acres to anyone
who would settle the land and stay five years.
   The Plains, they say, are inhospitable to agriculture and subject
to dust bowls, windstorms and droughts that will only worsen as the
water table falls.
   ``Endlessly windswept, nearly treeless, semiarid, austerely
beautiful, historically untenable, increasingly empty and now facing
ecological devastation,'' almost all of the area from the 98th
meridian west to the Rockies ultimately will become deserted, the
Poppers predict.
   The only question, they say, is whether the process will be eased
through government intervention or imposed brutally by raw market
forces.
   In an interview, Popper argued that without subsidies the Plains
cannot sustain agricultural life and ``as Gramm-Rudman kicks in it
is not going to make sense to keep subsidizing agriculture when what
the Plains produce mostly adds to national farm surpluses that are
already too big.''
   So instead, they propose letting the government gradually buy
back farmland ``and tear down the fences, replant the shortgrass and
restock the animals, including many bison _ creating what we would
call the Buffalo Commons.''
   They figure in 20 to 30 years vegetation and wildlife could
``reassert themselves'' and the Plains would be restored ``to their
pre-white condition.''
   ``We're not talking about some awful rural version of urban
renewal,'' says Potter. ``We're talking about a long-term,
demographic-economic evolution that would occur regardless of
whatever government does, an evolution that is market driven.''
   Vast areas are involved. The Poppers are talking about a third to
half the area of 10 states: most of the Dakotas, the western
two-thirds of Nebraska, the western halves of Kansas, Oklahoma and
Texas, the eastern tips of New Mexico and Colorado, eastern Wyoming
and all but westernmost Montana.
   ``The only way to keep the Plains from turning into an utter
wasteland, an American Empty Quarter, will be for the federal
government to step in and buy the land _ in short, to deprivatize
it,'' the Poppers wrote.
   Small ``service center'' cities such as Bismarck, N.D., and
Cheyenne, Wyo., or towns near interstate highways might stay in
business. So would locales able to sustain themselves through
agriculture, energy development or tourism _ but they're few, the
Poppers say.
   ``The Buffalo Commons will become the world's largest historic
preservation project, the ultimate national park,'' they wrote.
``Much of the Great Plains will become what all of the United States
once was _ a vast land mass, largely empty and unexploited.''
   Mrs. Popper says she's been overwhelmed by the reaction to their
article; the idea ``certainly has struck a nerve.''
   And ``even the people who say we are crazy,'' she says, usually
concede the area has serious problems.
   ``The government is not looking for new ways to spend money,''
Mrs. Popper says. ``We see this happening only after greater
devastation, greater catastrophe.''
   Adds Popper: ``We would like not to see it happen. We both like
the Great Plains. If our proposal is able to prevent this disaster
from occurring, we'd be delighted.''
   For all their Plains states critics, some there acknowledge the
Poppers have hit upon a home truth.
   ``I agree with Frank that it was a miscalculation when the social
engineers put as many people as they did out here through that
Homestead Act,'' says rancher Jim Strain of Rapid City, S.D., who
runs the American Cowman's Association.
   ``But I don't agree it should be a Buffalo Commons. I think it
was meant to be a vast grasslands for producers of red-meat animals
to graze their herds on. It was a mistake to plow this land with its
limited topsoil and limited moisture. The natural grasses which
nature had matched to the soil types preserved the soil and they had
a natural value, which is grazing.''
   In their hearts, would his fellow Plains people agree?
   ``It would be a 50-50 split,'' says Strain. ``There are people
who make some pretty good bucks out of this government
intervention.''
   Mark Lapping, dean of architecture at Kansas State University,
says the Poppers are wrong about one thing: ``Deprivitization is
something that will not happen.''
   He adds: ``There will always be some very large islands of
population and economic activity. While we see depopulatization of
many small towns, we're seeing the creation of many larger and
economically viable regions. ... Those people are not moving to
Washington or Kansas City but to Garden City and Liberal and
Manhattan and Lawrence and other places that have sufficient scale
and diversity.''
   And geographer Bret Wallach of the University of Oklahoma said
the Poppers are ``a bit quixotic in the short term but in the long
run it is an idea whose time will probably come.''
   ``This country probably has a lot more cropland than in the long
run it will need and we ouight to think about what to do with it,''
Wallach says.
   ``Countries in the Third World are going to be able to take care
of themselves one of these days,'' he says. ``In New England they
let the farmland grow back into trees and maybe that is the
enlightened thing to do _ restore it to its virgin use.''

<BYLINE>Do We Have To Have a Recession? ^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a survey of chief executives a few weeks ago
about 60 percent said that over the next two years recession, not
inflation, was the biggest threat facing the economy.
   At the same time, a Commerce Department survey shows, businesses
were expressing optimism about the economy by raising their capital
outlays 7 percent over a year ago, with much of the money going for
expansion.
   The same dichotomy shows up in consumer surveys: Those
interviewed express fear of a recession but then go out and buy cars
and houses, strengthening those industries at the very time
economists are warning of turndowns.
   Everyone talks about recession, economists, business people,
consumers, government officials, academics, students. But do they
really believe a recession is imminent? That, it seems, is an
entirely different matter.
   Part of the explanation lies in the conviction that after seven
years of expansion, an unusually long growth period, the economy
MUST have a recession. Hasn't it always been that way? Aren't
recessions necessary to restore balance?
   Throughout this century, at least, recessions have indeed been
viewed as antidotes to excesses in buying, borrowing and
expectations, and there is lots of circumstantial evidence to
suggest officials have deliberately created them.
   But there is nothing sacred or inevitable about recessions _
nothing in the books that says economies must have recessions, which
generally if not officially are said to involve two successive
quarters of economic shrinkage.
   Many economists believe that in some instances an economic
slowdown might accomplish all the correction necessary _ reduce
expectations, discourage debt and overspending, lessen strains on
capacity _ without shrinking output.
   In fact, the possibility of doing that very thing is the current
aim of the Federal Reserve Board _ its reason for tightening or
loosening the money supply, for raising, not raising or even
lowering interest rates.
   That effort, as some economists view it, might very well result
in a ``growth recession,'' a contradictory term that nevertheless
suggests an economy continuing to move forward but at an almost
imperceptible rate.
   More and more economists today speak of rolling recessions, in
which the economy never shrinks as a whole while separate industries
within the economy go through private downturns at different times.
   In such a situation the national statistics never show a
recession, but for practical purposes something did occur that had a
similar impact. Within the past seven years there are indications
that it actually has happened.
   Something similar occurs when the economy in some geographical
areas of the country shrinks while expansion, even boom, occurs
elsewhere. Averaged out, the national economy does not have a
recession, but recession has occurred.
   Within recent years, for instance, large areas of the country
experienced severe downturns because of simultaneous problems in
energy, agriculture, manufacturing and mining, but coastal booms
prevented an official recession.
   For those who continue to fear a recession simply because the
current expansion is so old there might be some solace, therefore,
in the notion that, official statistics aside, the economy might
already have had its recession.
   In 1984, one analyst, Sindlinger &amp; Co., estimated that 34 states
involving a majority of the nation's land area had fallen into
recession, some of them very deeply. Offsetting booms elsewhere hid
the fact, at least statistically.
   For practical rather than statistical purposes, those downturns
may have accomplished the same results. If so, the current economic
expansion might not be so sold as it seems, and things might even be
looking up.
   The University of Michigan economic outlook, which has a pretty
fair record for anticipating events over the year to come, calls for
the current slowdown to bottom out by the end of the year without
turning into recession.
   No boom, say the Michigan economists, but no recession either _
official or unofficial.

<HEAD>New-High Celebrations Subdued on Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new highs reached by the Dow Jones industrial
average in late August have so far proved to be more of a letdown
than a breakthrough for the stock market.
   Some observers had thought that when the Dow average at last
surpassed its 1987 peaks, the many skeptics who had doubted the
durability of the market's post-crash recovery would surrender and
join in the party.
   But so far they have instead dug in their heels, intensifying
their predictions of an impending ``correction'' or something worse.
   As analysts at the Merrill Lynch Market Letter put it: ``The Dow
Jones industrial average has finally made a new record high, but the
general market picture hasn't changed much in the past two weeks.
   ``The move to a new high marks an important step in the market's
recovery from the October 1987 collapse, but we doubt that it will
lead to a substantial new advance at this time.
   ``There wasn't much follow-through to the new high and we think
that will continue to be the case.''
   Some analysts say a primary obstacle in the market's path is the
risk that the economy will fail to live up to some very high
expectations.
   ``Wall Street thinks that business will rebound next year. We
doubt it,'' says Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg,
Thalmann &amp; Co. ``Tight money and falling profits have the economy on
track to a modest downturn.''
   To other doubters, the problem lies in the recent performance of
stock prices themselves.
   ``I believe there are a number of disturbing similarities between
the rally of 1989 and the rally of 1987,'' says Charles LaLoggia, a
Rochester, N.Y., investment adviser.
   Just as in 1987, he points out, ``the number of new (individual)
highs on the New York Stock Exchange has been declining
significantly even as the Dow has been making new highs.
   ``This situation reached a new level of absurdity on Monday, Aug.
28 when only 90 stocks, or 4.5 percent of the stocks traded on the
NYSE, were able to make new 52-week highs as the Dow rose to a new
record.
   ``This is a signal that the rally is thinning out and taking
progressively fewer stocks along for the ride, and that's almost
always a sign that the advance is in its final phase.''
   Investors apparently took such warnings to heart in the past
week. The Dow Jones industrials fell 42.55 points to 2,709.54,
ending a run of nine straight weekly gains.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 2.42 to
193.95; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
lost 0.03 to 471.31, while the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up .14 at 384.10.
   Big Board volume averaged 155.31 million shares a day, against
151.49 million the week before.
   Some bulls on the market outlook aren't at all distressed that
the new highs this summer have produced so little enthusiasm.
   In fact, they contend, the longer it takes to convert the bears,
the more room stocks may find to keep on rising.
   ``This year's rally has been strange in that each mini-move up
was met with doubt,'' said William LeFevre at Advest Inc. ``Each
move up brought a new set of reasons why the rally couldn't continue.
   ``As the doubts grew, so did the market's gains. The old cliche,
`every bull market climbs a wall of worry,' was never truer.''

<HEAD>British Investment in United States Keeps Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investors get the headlines, but the
British have been on a buying spree for control of American
companies that range from pineapple harvesters to typewriter makers,
Standard Oil Co. to Burger King.
   Britain is the biggest foreign investor in the United States, as
it has been since colonial days. What is less widely known is that
Britain is actually extending its lead over Japan as well as the
No.3 Netherlands and others.
   British investors added $21.5 billion to their direct investments
in the United States last year, compared with additions of $14.2
billion for Japan, Commerce Department figures show.
   It appears that Britain's lead is widening even further in 1989:
   _Grand Metropolitan PLC bought Pillsbury Co. for $5.8 billion, a
deal that gave it such famous names as Green Giant, Haagen-Dazs and
Burger King.
   _Late last month Bass PLC agreed to buy Holiday Inns Inc., the
nation's innkeeper, for $2.2 billion.
   _Just this past week, Polly Peck PLC agreed to pay $875 million
for a very large quantity of pineapples, bananas, papayas and
mangoes: the fresh fruit operations of RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Del Monte
Foods Inc.
   Economics would seem to give Japan the edge over Britain in
buying into the United States. Japan accumulates huge sums of
dollars through its bulging trade surplus with the United States,
which was greater than $50 billion last year. In contrast, Britain
ran a slender trade deficit with the United States in 1988.
   But Britain moves more boldly into the United States than Japan
does because of its history of internationalism, the ease of dealing
with another English-speaking nation, and the momentum generated by
past dealings.
   ``The Japanese have the ability to be the largest acquirer in the
United States, but the British have the incentive,'' said Mark
Dixon, editor of the British-American Deal Review in New York.
   ``British companies are aggressive, entrepreneurial,
international,'' Dixon said. ``In terms of moving into foreign
markets, they are probably at the moment the most pioneering in the
world.''
   In contrast, Dixon said, ``The Japanese are very cautious, and
they end up missing opportunities.''
   Analysts say Japanese investors get most of the attention from
the news media and politicians because they are seen as a bigger
threat to U.S.-based competitors. Differences in race and culture
probably add to the discomfort on both sides, analysts add.
   While Japanese investment is concentrated in heavy industry and
high technology _ for example, steel, autos and computers _ British
investment is across the board.
   John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co. is part of British
Petroleum Co., while Robert Maxwell owns Macmillan books, Hanson PLC
owns Smith-Corona typewriters and BAT Industries owns Farmers Group
insurance.
   Britain's investment in the 1980s harks back to its investment in
the 1890s, when London bankers helped finance American railroads. It
is also ``a signal of the wave of the future,'' said Ethan Harris,
an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York.
   ``As businessmen become more familiar with each other's markets,
there's more and more of these cross-border mergers, and the natural
leader in that would be two countries that have historical and
business ties going back centuries,'' Harris said.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _United Airlines' Machinists union said its officials had been
contacted by two buyout specialists seeking UAL Corp., the parent of
United and a prime takeover target. The new parties are billionaire
investor Robert Bass and takeover firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Meanwhile, Eastern Airlines' pilots said they had chosen ``a
gladiator'' _ Skip Copeland, an Eastern captain based in New York _
to lead them after ousting the union leader who a month ago
suggested they end their strike.
   _The dollar approached the peaks reached three months ago as
bullish traders combated intervention by central banks, which are
trying to keep exchange rates stable. At week's end the dollar was
trading just below 2 West German marks and a little above 147
Japanese yen.
   _Ford Motor Co. and Saab Scania AB of Sweden said they were
discussing ``closer cooperation in various areas of the automotive
business.'' Saab Scania didn't rule out a sale of a majority stake
in its struggling car division. A partial or full merger of the car
divisions could mark the beginning of a consolidation in the
worldwide automaking business.

<HEAD>Planned Bloomie's Sale Dashes Campeau Hopes for Real Estate-Retailing
Empire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Campeau was on top of the world a year and
a-half ago, gloating after his victory in the two-month-long battle
for Federated Department Stores Inc.
   The real estate developer, who already had Allied Stores Corp.
among his holdings, had dreams of a real estate and retailing
empire, with the crown jewel of department store chains,
Bloomingdale's, giving him an entree into new shopping malls in
untapped markets.
   But those dreams are all but shattered now as Campeau, unable to
handle his company's massive debt as the retail business soured, has
been forced to put his prize chain on the block.
   ``Bloomingdale's would be the last thing he would want to sell,''
Walter Loeb, a retail industry analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
Inc., said of Campeau last week.
   But Campeau has no choice but to sell: He faces an estimated $450
million loan payment that is coming due, he doesn't have the cash on
hand to pay it and selling the coveted Bloomie's is the fastest way
to get that cash.
   In a statement Friday announcing Campeau's plans to sell the
chain and undertake a financial restructuring, the developer's
holding company, Campeau Corp., tried to put the best face on what
could only be called a defeat:
   ``Following the Bloomingdale's divestiture, Federated and Allied
will continue to be a major force in U.S. retailing ...''
   Campeau will still own 240 department stores, including Allied's
The Bon, Jordan Marsh, Maas Brothers and Stern's stores and
Federated's Abraham &amp; Straus, Burdine's, Goldsmith's, Lazarus and
Rich's chains. But without Bloomingdale's _ now a part of Federated
_ he will not have the same influence in shopping center development
that he had hoped to possess.
   And, the forced sale of Bloomingdale's is a black mark on his
financial reputation.
   Robert Campeau was a virtually unknown Canadian developer when,
in late 1986, he launched a hostile bid for Allied. He won the
company, paying $3.4 billion, and then began to unload most of
Allied's store units to help pay off his bank loans.
   In January 1988, just a year after closing on the Allied deal, he
began his run at Federated. Campeau found himself in a bidding war
with R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc., one that drove up the price for the
company until Campeau ended up paying $6.6 billion for the
retailer's shares, and a total of $8.8 billion for the entire
company once costs were figured in.
   That price is what did Campeau in.
   ``They paid too much for it,'' said Pamela Stubing, an analyst
with Moody's Investors Service.
   Campeau took over staggering bank loans and sold billions of
dollars in junk bonds to finance his deals. He also sold off
billions of dollars in assets, leaving only department stores _ and
their valuable real estate _ in his retail portfolio.
   He was depending on the stores to generate enough cash flow to
pay the debt, but the stagnant consumer spending climate has taken a
larger toll on sales than he expected.
   ``They were optimistic in the early part of the year, looking for
a 5 to 6 percent increase in sales, but that might not have come
true in the second quarter,'' said Edward Johnson, an analyst with
Prescott Ball &amp; Turben.
   Campeau is not the only developer-turned-retailer to run into
problems. L.J. Hooker Corp., which owns the Bonwit Teller and B.
Altman chains in the United States, has run into financial problems
in its home country, Australia, and its retail operations here have
suffered as well.
   Hooker's U.S. subsidiary was forced to file for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in New York.
   Analysts say developers have bitten off more than they could chew.
   ``Developers should never have taken on this kind of debt,''
given the uncertain nature of retailing, Morgan Stanley's Loeb said.
   Ms. Stubing agreed. Developers ``look on the properties as an
asset, but it's a working asset and it's only valuable if you make
money from it,'' she said.
   ``Though they knew the value (of the real estate), they didn't
know what they could get from it with the cash flow,'' she said.
   When Campeau bought Federated, the retailing industry was already
mired in a sales slump. The developer claimed that he had factored a
continuation of the downturn into his plans.
   Johnson said increasing competition from stores like the booming
Nordstrom chain has hurt the big department stores.
   Another problem Campeau has faced _ and likely caused _ is the
high management turnover since the chains were acquired. Several
high-level executives at Campeau Corp. and the retail companies have
come and gone in the past two years, and this has not helped matters.
   ``Whenever you have changes at the top continuing, it puts
adverse pressure on the management underneath,'' Johnson said.
   If the developers have good retail management, they have a better
chance of succeeding, but ``if they're looking to pyramid the
profits'' without trying to run a solid merchandising operation,
they can't get the cash flow they need, Johnson said.
