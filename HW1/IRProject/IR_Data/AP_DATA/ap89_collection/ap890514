   Fire erupted Sunday aboard a Liberian
tanker carrying 450,000 barrels of crude oil, but U.S. Coast Guard
officials said the cargo was not threatened and the blaze was
extinguished nine hours later.
   ``The fire is safely out, there was no pollution and no
problems,'' said Lt.j.g. Robert R. Dubois with the Coast Guard in
Port Arthur.
   Two crew members aboard the 810-foot Jalinga were taken to Park
Place Hospital in Port Arthur for treatment of smoke inhalation
after the fire erupted in the vessel's engine room about 9:30 a.m.
Sunday, said another Coast Guard spokesman, Lt. j.g. Robert Garrott.
   The two unidentified men were being held overnight for
observation, Garrott said. No other injuries were reported.
   Two tugs were holding the Jalinga in place Sunday afternoon
while firefighters battled the fire, which was contained in the
engine room, Garrott said. It was extinguished about 6:15 p.m.,
Dubois said.
   The cause of the fire has not been determined, but Garrott said
the Coast Guard has begun an investigation.
   Garrott said the Jalinga originated in Galveston and was bound
for the Fina docks in Port Arthur. The ship is owned by Jalinga
Navigation, Inc., Monrovia, Liberia, he said.

<HEAD>Inmate Captured After Escaping Jail With Semiautomatic Carved From
Soap</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jail inmate who made his second escape in
two months by pulling a gun carved from soap was captured Sunday in
a pecan grove.
   Roy Kenneth Sanford, 23, was caught while walking in the grove
south of Perry, said Houston County Sheriff Cullen Talton. He
escaped Saturday after he pulled what looked like a semiautomatic
weapon on three guards and ordered another inmate to open a
cellblock door.
   The gun had been carved from two bars of soap and painted black,
Talton said.
   ``At first glance, it looked like the real thing,'' Talton said.
``Of course, when you looked close you could tell it wasn't. He
even used an eye from a shoe, like you run shoelaces through, to
make the barrel look real.''
   Sanford, serving time for armed robbery and kidnapping, was one
of seven inmates who escaped from the county jail two months ago.
He was making a phone call Saturday when he asked jailer Clarence
Cash if he could get a drink of water from a cooler outside the
security door, Talton said.
   Cash let Sanford through, Talton said. Sanford went to the water
cooler, then pulled what appeared to be a gun, forced jailers to
lie on the floor and made his escape, Talton said.
   ``It's a situation that never should have happened,'' Talton
said Sunday. ``It's a case of jailers being negligent and not
following the rules of the jail.''
   Talton said authorities would consider disciplinary action
against Cash Monday.

<TEXT>
   Gay activist Peter Scott, who canceled a run
for the state Assembly after learning he had AIDS, has died of
complications from the disease. He was 50.
   Scott, the former chairman of AIDS Project-Los Angeles, died
Saturday at his home, friends said.
   A former lawyer who gave up his practice to champion gay rights,
Scott worked to defeat measures to fire homosexual teachers and a
state initiative requiring that people with AIDS be registered with
the state.
   Scott founded the Municipal Election Committee of Los Angeles,
the city's most powerful gay rights political group. He was active
in fund-raising until his illness worsened last month.
   Scott led the fight in California to hasten testing of
experimental AIDS drugs, resulting in a drug-testing bill passed
into law in 1987.
   Scott was diagnosed with AIDS in 1986, just as he was planning
to challenge Assembly Majority Leader Mike Roos for his 46th
District seat. Instead, he worked to raise money to find a cure for
AIDS.
   He is survived by his longtime companion, David Quarles; his
mother, Camille Scott; and sister, Mary Jamison.

<HEAD>Even Sweet Vidalias Can Drive Researchers To Tears</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TIFTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Janie Hayes wears a mask and goggles at work.
Otherwise, her job would drive her to tears.
   The lab technician at the University of Georgia's Coastal Plain
Experiment Station peels and grinds samples of Vidalia onions and
then conducts chemical tests that may someday enable consumers to
identify the strength of an onion.
   The gourmet onions have a reputation of being the sweetest,
mildest in the world, but when there are 50 to 60 Vidalias to slice
in a day, her lab fills with eye-burning fumes and a pungent odor.
   ``I have to wear a mask and goggles,'' Mrs. Hayes said.
``Otherwise, my eyes burn and my sinuses throb.''
   She and horticulturist Doyle Smittle are collecting information
on sugar and pungency levels in Vidalias.
   ``We're trying to develop a rapid, objective method of measuring
quality in onions,'' said Smittle. ``We'd like to have a technique
... simple enough that a grower or group of growers could measure
the quality in at least every field of onions they have.''
   This summer, food scientist Robert Shewfelt will convene a taste
panel at the Experiment Station in Griffin to sample some of the
same onions that have been tested.
   Smittle, who has been studying the compounds in onions since the
mid-1970s, hopes to establish a relationship between the chemical
composition of Vidalias and the onions preferred by the taste panel.
   Onions have virtually no odor until their tissue is damaged by
slicing. At that point, an enzyme triggers a chemical reaction that
produces ammonia and other substances that cause tears.
   Chemical tests give a good indication of an onion's pungency,
but they're too complicated and costly for routine use by growers,
said Smittle.
   Taste buds aren't as reliable as laboratory tests because humans
tend to forget how bad or good a sample was, he said. Members of
the taste panel will sample six onions a day, then they'll come
back a week or two later and evaluate the same onions.
   The horticulturist foresees use of an infrared device that would
scan onions in the packing sheds and determine their mildness.
Since sugars absorb infrared light, there may be a correlation
between taste and the amount of light that passes through onions,
he said.
   Smittle believes growers eventually will be able to place
stickers on each onion, with a picture of a thermometer showing the
degree of mildness. His tests have shown that onion mildness varies
from field to field and season to season.
   With a pungency rating, consumers could use the hotter onions in
dishes that require more flavor. The rating also would help
consumers adjust the thickness of slices to specific needs.
   Georgia's 260 registered growers and packers have turned the
Vidalia onion into a $30-million-a-year crop. Protected by state
law, onions bearing the Vidalia label have to be a yellow Granex
hybrid. The growing region encompasses 13 counties in southeastern
Georgia and parts of six other.
   Growers claim Vidalias are sweetest because of the variety and
the low-sulfur soil around Vidalia, a town of 10,000 residents
about 80 miles west of Savannah.

   Norbert Rillieux and Jan Matzeliger helped
revolutionize American history with their inventions, but the two
men scarcely rate a footnote in the annals of Yankee ingenuity
simply because they were black.
   Historian Portia James is setting matters straight with an
ambitious new Smithsonian Institution exhibition that celebrates
the genius of America's unsung black inventors.
   The show, which opens Sunday, pays belated tribute to 40
inventors whose creations include a trouser-stretching device for
eliminating wrinkles, a machine for producing paper bags, a press
for baling cotton and a mechanical traffic signal patented in 1923.
   ``The exhibition says a lot about their urge to create, and how
important it was for blacks to feel they were part of the growth of
American technology,'' said Ms. James, the show's curator. ``It was
their assertion of black participation in the Yankee innovative
spirit.''
   The exhibition at the Smithsonian's Anacostia Museum of
Afro-American history and culture is titled ``The Real McCoy:
African American Invention and Innovation, 1619-1930.''
   The show's name is taken from an invention by mechanical
engineer Elijah McCoy _ a grease cup designed for lubricating rail
locomotives while they sped down the tracks. Admiring train
engineers nicknamed it ``the real McCoy.''
   On display are the two devices created by black inventors which
probably have had the greatest lasting impact on American society,
said Ms. James, a native of Detroit who is the Anacostia Museum's
resident historian.
   One of them, developed by the New Orleans inventor Rillieux in
1830, is a vacuum evaporation machine that made refined sugar
widely affordable. It later was used to produce such foods as
evaporated milk and cocoa powder.
   The other is Matzeliger's shoe-lasting machine, patented in 1883
by the inventor from Dutch Surinam. The machine radically changed
the American shoe industry by eliminating the need for costly
hand-stitching of soles to the soft leather uppers of shoes.
   The museum duly recognizes one of the few prominent black
inventors, George Washington Carver, with a sampling of the
products he derived from peanuts, soybeans and sweet potatoes in
his laboratory at Alabama's Tuskegee Institute.
   But it also highlights such unknowns as Lewis Latimer of Queens,
N.Y., the only black associate on Thomas Edison's laboratory team,
who patented a carbon light bulb filament. Another is Garrett
Morgan of Cleveland, who invented both the stop-go traffic signal
and an industrial ``safety hood'' or gas mask which he used to
rescue workers trapped by a tunnel explosion under Lake Erie.
   Ms. James notes that African slaves introduced the banjo to
American music, and that Boston clergyman Cotton Mather learned of
inoculation against smallpox from his North African slave Onesimus.
   The exhibition honors New York tailor Thomas Jennings, the first
black believed to have received a patent, for his dry cleaning
process in 1821. On display are three wood planes designed in the
1770s by Cesar Chelor, a freed slave from Wrentham, Mass., who is
believed to be the earliest black toolmaker in America.
   Ms. James said her research for the exhibition took three years
because of the scarcity of historical records.
   Material came from old newspapers and magazines published for
the black community and from an exhaustive record of pre-1900
patents awarded to black inventors that was compiled by Henry
Baker, an early black U.S. patent examiner, she said.
   Ms. James' research yielded the tale of Oscar J.E. Stuart, a
Mississippi planter who tried to obtain a patent in 1857 for a
labor-saving ``double cotton scraper'' invented by his slave, Ned.
   Stuart argued that ``the master is the owner of the fruits of
the labor of the slave both intellectual and manual,'' but the
federal government granted neither man a patent.
   Undaunted, Stuart began manufacturing Ned's creation and issued
advertising circulars containing this testimonial from a fellow
plantation owner:
   ``I am glad to know that your implement is the invention of a
Negro slave _ thus giving the lie to the Abolition cry that slavery
dwarfs the mind of the Negro. When did a free Negro ever invent
anything?''
   As for the ingenious slave, Ms. James says, ``Ned disappeared
from history, and nothing is known of what became of him.''

<HEAD>Coelho Defends Legality of Junk Bond Loan, but Says he Regrets it</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A top House Democrat says an arrangement that
earned him $6,882 in four months through buying junk bonds with
other people's money ``wasn't worth the trouble'' in light of the
current focus on ethics.
   ``With the benefit of hindsight, I now regret having made this
transaction,'' Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said Sunday as he
released his lawyer's report on the bond purchase.
   As House majority whip, Coelho is the third-ranking Democrat and
chief vote-counter for House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who has
been charged by the House ethics committee with violating rules in
his personal financial dealings.
   Coelho, who could move up in the House leadership if Wright
falls, said Sunday he would be amending his 1986 financial
disclosure to include a previously unreported $50,000 loan that
financed half of a $100,000 investment in junk bonds in 1986.
   His lawyer's report said the chief executive of the savings and
loan that provided that financing had suggested the junk bond
investment to Coelho and then purchased the bonds on Coelho's
behalf when the congressman needed more time to raise the money.
   Junk bonds are high-risk, high-yield bonds often used to finance
corporate takeovers.
   According to his lawyer's report, Coelho first considered
investing his 1986 campaign funds in the 12 1@2 percent bonds,
based on a suggestion by Thomas Spiegel, chief executive officer of
the Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif.
   After Coelho decided against that investment for his campaign
treasury, Spiegel suggested that Coelho himself could make an
investment in the bonds, which were being issued for a takeover of
Beatrice foods arranged by Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   When Coelho could not come up with the $100,000 by the required
purchase date of May 5, Spiegel bought the bonds himself and held
them for a month while Coelho completed his financing. Half the
money came from Spiegel's thrift institution and the rest from two
other banks.
   At that point, Coelho bought the bonds from Spiegel and paid him
interest equivalent to what the bonds made during the period of the
loan. When the congressman sold the bonds in October 1986, he was
able to repay the loans and realize a $6,882 profit.
   In his report, attorney Robert F. Bauer concluded that Coehlo
did not violate House rules in his arrangement with Spiegel,
because the congressman paid interest and thus accepted no ``gift''
which might have been improper.
   The fact that the investment was issued at first to Coelho's
campaign committee, instead of the congressman, was a clerical
error, Bauer said. Errors in the reported dates of the transactions
might require Coelho to amend his 1986 tax returns, he said.
   ``We believe that the appearances presented by the transaction
can be properly addressed by a full disclosure of all surrounding
circumstances,'' he said.
   There is no indication whether the ethics committee is
considering or plans to review the bond purchase.
   Coelho insists Spiegel has asked for no legislative favors and
none were granted. Coelho said in his statement he was ``accepting
without reservations the conclusion of my legal counsel that the
purchase of the bonds was totally above board.''
   But, he said, ``public officials are today, however, living in a
period of intense questioning.
   ``With the benefit of hindsight, I now regret having made this
transaction,'' he said. ``I don't like it when my public decisions
or private actions raise questions, as this investment did, and the
$6,882 profit wasn't worth the trouble.''
   Coelho last year put all of his holdings into a blind trust.
   Coelho did not disclose the bond transaction with Spiegel or the
loan from Spiegel's financial institution when The Washington Post
last month first reported on his junk bond investment.
   David Dreyer, Coelho's press secretary, said the congressman's
staff had taken a month ``to understand fully and reconstruct this
transaction.''
   He said that effort did not include checking whether Spiegel had
any interest in legislation, since that indicates a violation of
House rules only if Spiegel had conferred a gift.

<HEAD>Speeches for a Fee: Congress Now Must Tell How Much it Gets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the House and Senate must soon
disclose how much outside income they earned from speeches and
other activities that have fueled debate over a congressional pay
raise and created a preoccupation with ethics.
   On Friday senators and on May 22 members of the House of
Representatives will make public their financial disclosure forms,
which all high-level people in the government must file.
   Although the forms reveal such matters as what stocks the
members of Congress bought, sold and own and how much they got in
reimbursements when they went on the road to make a speech,
attention this year, as never before, is apt to focus on the fees
paid members of Congress for giving speeches.
   Common Cause, the public interest membership group which has
campaigned for tougher ethical standards, says it has counted 245
newspaper editorials demanding an end to these honoraria _ calling
the fees ``legalized bribery,'' ``legislative prostitution'' and
``lobbyists' payola.''
   Under Congress' own rules, members are permitted to take $2,000
for giving speeches, writing articles or sometimes merely putting
in an appearance. The fees are often paid by groups or companies
with a vital interest in legislation before the speakers'
committees.
   Last May, members of Congress reported getting $9.8 million in
honoraria fees in 1987, a 30 percent increase over 1986.
   Because House rules restrict outside earned income to 30 percent
of salary and Senate rules restrict senators from taking honoraria
fees worth more than 40 percent of salary, many members get more
than they can keep and give the overflow to charity.
   Last year, members of Congress kept $7.5 million and gave away
$2.3 million.
   The average senator kept $23,200 and the average House member
kept $12,200.
   The defense industry alone paid more than $500,000 in speaking
fees to members of congressional committees that deal with defense
issues.
   President Bush, in endorsing a 51 percent pay boost in January
that had been recommended by a commission appointed by former
President Ronald Reagan, also endorsed a simultaneous ban on
honoraria.
   When a public outcry caused Congress to vote down the pay raise,
it also rejected the honoraria ban, but the issue didn't go away.
   A commission appointed by Bush to recommend tighter ethics rules
for government proposed a ban on all honoraria and more stringent
limits on how much outside income can be earned by someone in
government.
   More recently, House Speaker Jim Wright was charged with ethics
violations, stemming in part from his earnings on a book. The House
ethics committee charged he used bulk sales of the book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' to circumvent restrictions on
outside income.
   Former Attorney General Griffin Bell, a member of the
commission, said honoraria fees present the appearance of a
conflict of interest.
   ``People wonder who's paying all these honoraria,'' he said.
``It undermines confidence in government.''
   The financial disclosure requirement grew out of the
Watergate-spawned demand for higher ethical standards in
government. Congress adopted an ethics code in 1977 and put it into
law in 1978.
   Bush adopted most but not all of his commission's
recommendations. He called for banning honoraria for judges but not
for members of Congress.
   He said he would deal with an honoraria ban when he again
approaches the delicate issue of proposing a pay raise for Congress.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee that will consider Bush's ethics recommendations, said
he favors a ban on congressional honoraria fees, although he would
allow members to continue earning some outside income for such
activities as teaching a course in law school.
   Frank refuses honoraria, as do a number of freshman congressmen.
   Congress is also required to disclose reimbursement for the
``actual and necessary travel expenses incurred'' when engaged in
speechmaking.
   But Common Cause says many in Congress ``have used creative
interpretations of these rules.''
   The organization cited a report by Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., that
he and his wife accepted round trip airfare to Hawaii and eight
nights food and lodging paid for by the American Association of
Airport Executives as necessary travel expenses or the report by
Rep. Herb Callahan, R-Ala., that he got $3,948 in travel and
lodging reimbursement for three days at Las Vegas, Nev., paid by
the National Moving and Storage Association.

<HEAD>US Needn't Fear Shift in Sino-Soviet Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration can't afford to be
complacent about warming relations between the Soviet Union and
China, but neither must it fear the shift is taking place at
Washington's expense, say analysts of Sino-Soviet ties.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's four-day pilgrimage to
Beijing, which begins today, is unlikely to result in a renewal of
the 1950s military alliance of communist giants, says Seweryn
Bialer, a Soviet specialist and professor of international
relations at Columbia University.
   ``I don't think it's a (military) alliance. ... but it is a
summit of major significance, because both countries need each
other again,'' Bialer said at a recent luncheon hosted in
Washington by the East-West Forum.
   Bialer predicted that economic cooperation between China and the
Soviet Union will grow extensively now that the 30-year rift
between Moscow and Beijing has been healed.
   ``Economic cooperation is in the interest of both countries,''
he said.
   And, he noted, Chinese officials have taken pains to let the
United States know that renewed Sino-Soviet links will not come at
the expense of the expanding U.S.-China relationship.
   An invitation to U.S. warships to visit Shanghai, delayed until
a day after Gorbachev tours the port city, is designed as
``reassurance for America, because the Chinese are very worried
that this (summit) would be received very badly in the United
States,'' the professor said.
   Andrew Brick, an analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, argues that a military pact doesn't appear to be in the
offing because neither Gorbachev nor Deng Xiao-ping wants ``to risk
access to vital Western financial and technological assistance.''
   He points out that Americans can hardly criticize the Chinese
for following the pattern of warming U.S.-Soviet relations. Also,
he argues, the summit comes at a time when U.S. and Chinese ties
``have deepened on so many fronts _ industrial, trade, military
cooperation, shared technology and vast cultural and educational
exchanges _ there is almost no possibility that a rapprochement
with the Soviets would come at the price of cooler relations with
the U.S.''
   But the administration must be wary of any renewed military
cooperation and let both nations know that such a development could
cause the president to reassess his support for the normalization
of relations, Brick said.
   If the Soviets and Chinese iron out their so-called ``three
obstacles'' to improved ties _ tensions along their 4,670-mile
border as well as Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and Vietnam _ a
more stable Asia could result, Brick said, a development that would
benefit the United States.
   RAND Corp. analyst Jonathan Pollack, in an essay on the summit
written for the Asia Society, points out that the summit occurs
``at a time when the Sino-American relationship is on a vastly more
diversified footing than when Soviet initiatives toward Beijing
first began.''
   Pollack points to the growth in U.S.-China trade, which in 1988
surpassed $13 billion, or more than four times the level of
Sino-Soviet trade; U.S. investment in China has topped $3 billion,
more than any other single country; and more than 30,000 Chinese
students are in the United States as technological and military
exchanges are growing.
   ``American interests would not be well served by an attempt to
curry favor with either state in the aftermath of the summit; the
basis for good relations with both Moscow and Beijing can and does
exist independent of their relations with each other,'' says the
think tank's specialist on Chinese-Soviet ties.
   Most analysts agree the summit may mark the symbolic end of the
strategic triangular relationship that gave birth to the notion of
the United States playing the so-called ``China card,'' or the idea
that the antagonistic relationship between Moscow and Beijing
offered the United States leverage in dealing with either nation.
   ``There is no more triangle _ it is a quadrangle,'' said Bialer,
who points to the entrance of Japan as the major economic power in
Asia.
   The shift does present a new and more complex challenge, Pollack
says, ``especially since there no longer seem any illusions about
the ability of the United States to manipulate Sino-Soviet
differences to the advantage of American interests.''

<HEAD>Soviet Grain Sales Keep the Trains Rolling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One million metric tons of wheat would fill
11,100 covered hopper cars used by railroads to move grain.
   If towed by a single locomotive, the train would be about 116
miles long, according to figures supplied by the Association of
American Railroads.
   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet Union has already
bought enough wheat and corn this fiscal year to fill about 20 of
the million-ton trains.
   If those were lined up one behind the other, they would stretch
2,320 miles _ roughly the distance from Washington D.C. to Twin
Falls, Idaho.
   Specifically, Moscow has bought a record 19.3 million tons of
U.S. wheat and corn for delivery through Sept. 30, and has been
cleared to purchase a maximum of 24 million tons by then.
   And the Soviet Union is only part of the huge annual export flow
of U.S. farm commodities that move by railroad, truck and river
barge to seaports and then to overseas points.
   Japan is the biggest single foreign customer of American
farmers, and China _ this year, at least _ is the largest buyer of
U.S. wheat.
   But Moscow's grain needs, coupled with historic secrecy in the
early dealings with Soviet buyers, are paramount in the way USDA
and farmers look at the export situation.
   Crop failure in the Ukraine, or even the hint of significant
losses, can send tremors through the U.S. and world commodity
markets. It's something that's watched closely by farmers, private
traders and USDA analysts.
   By law, private exporters must report all big sales _ 100,000
tons or more _ to USDA within 24 hours. All sales, regardless of
size, are reported weekly.
   Jean Nollmeyer of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
has updated her records showing the high marks for one-day grain
sales. No specific country's are listed, however.
   The public announcements of large grain sales go back to early
1977, although weekly disclosures go back several more years.
   When very large grain sales are announced, there are sometimes
inquiries about their relative size and whether a record has been
reached. Nollmeyer's list helps answer those questions.
   The biggest day's activity on Nollmeyer's list was on July 6,
1979, when exporters reported sales totaling nearly 2.48 million
tons of grain, including 1.86 million tons of corn and 616,200 tons
of wheat. But, because of a provision in the law, the exporters
reported the grain's foreign destination as ``unknown.''
   Often, however, the grain in the initial ``unknown'' category is
changed in later reports to the Soviet Union, China or some other
buyer.
   Unofficially, since Nollmeyer's one-day records go back only to
April 14, 1977, there were a few sales larger than the one she
cites. This requires a bit of history.
   The export reporting system was ordered by Congress in the early
1970s following huge secret dealings between Moscow and private
grain companies. The Soviet Union in 1972, for example, secretly
bought about a fourth of that year's U.S. wheat crop, plus corn,
barley and soybeans.
   In all, more than 16 million tons of those commodities were
contracted in a few weeks of dealing in the summer of 1972. About
three-fourths of the grain was wheat.
   ``The huge, anticipated Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat and corn
that year produced a sizable runup in U.S. food prices and depleted
U.S. reserve stocks,'' the USDA says in a background report.
   And there were charges that some USDA insiders had played along
with the Soviets, that fat export subsidies were involved and that
there was even a commodity spy at work.
   Congress stepped into the fray in 1973, ordering an export sales
reporting system to help bring order and accountability to the
business.
   But there was still turmoil, and Moscow, periodically faced with
huge food deficits, continued to be an erratic customer of the
American farmer.
   In 1975, after another round of large sales, further shipments
were embargoed by President Ford in July and finally lifted the
following October after a long-term agreement was worked out with
the Soviets to buy annual amounts of U.S. wheat and corn.
   The pact took effect on Oct. 1, 1976, and has been renewed or
extended since then.
   Even so, sales to the Soviet Union sometimes were huge. On April
28, 1976, for example, USDA announced sales of corn totaling 1.4
million tons. Later the same day, officials announced a further
sale of 1.7 million tons of corn plus 300,000 tons of wheat.
   In all, the one-day flurry involved the sale of 3.4 million tons
of grain to the Soviet Union.
   Nowadays, with exporters and the Kremlin accustomed to the
long-term agreement's terms and the reporting requirements, a sale
of a million tons or so in one day is considered unusual.
   In fact, according to Nollmeyer's list, one-day total grain
sales to all foreign buyers, including the Soviet Union, have
exceeded 2 million tons only three times since 1977.

<HEAD>Corporate America Upbeat in Face of Slowdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of corporate America say
business is surprisingly good and they're prepared to weather the
sharp downturn that looms ahead.
   Members of the Business Council, made up of chief executives
from 65 major corporations, gathered at the posh Homestead resort
this past weekend for their semiannual country retreat.
   The Business Council's economists are projecting that economic
growth, as measured by the gross national product, will fall from
last year's strong 3.9 percent pace to 1.4 percent by the end of
the year and rebound late in 1990.
   But many executives were generally more bullish than their own
analysts.
   ``We really see that as good news, not bad news,'' said David T.
Kearns, chairman of Xerox Corp. ``When you get a slowing of growth,
it should keep inflation down.''
   Signs of an economic slowdown have proliferated in recent
months, in weak retail sales, flat industrial production, plunging
home sales and construction and slower overall spending by
consumers.
   Still, even among leaders of industries most affected by the
slowdown, there were few furrowed brows over the weekend or
admissions that trouble lies ahead.
   Philip Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores, said
general merchandisers are seeing ``somewhat better sales than
anticipated.''
   Hawley did acknowledge the onset of a slowdown in spending on
big-ticket ``durable goods'' such as major appliances, but he said
companies are doing a good job of keeping their inventories under
control.
   A similarly bright outlook for the auto industry, which has
experienced sluggish sales so far this year, came from Roger Smith,
chairman of General Motors Corp. and of the Business Council.
   ``Any time that our industry is looking at car and truck sales
up in the 15 million area, why it's got to be a good year for us,''
Smith said.
   He conceded that sales are being propped up by big rebates and
cut-rate financing, but said surveys showing that consumer
confidence remains high bode well for future sales.
   John F. Welch, chairman of General Electric Co., said business
leaders are making few plans to retrench because the slowing
economy still offers the prospect of reasonable growth.
   ``We don't see, at least in front of us today, any precipitous
drop,'' Welch said. ``Capital spending will remain about where it
is and productivity will continue to improve.''
   Said Walter V. Shipley, chairman of Chemical Banking Corp., ``My
view is that there's a little stronger undercurrent to the economy
than this forecast, and I think there will be higher inflationary
pressures.''
   Shipley said he believes gains in American productivity have
been underestimated and favorable exchange rates are making U.S.
products more competitive overseas.
   S.D. Bechtel, chairman of the giant engineering and construction
company that bears his name, had a similarly positive outlook for
the economy overall, although he said the construction business
remains weak.
   ``We've been down for several years and the economy got its
strength without us,'' he said.
   Several chief executives said a possible jinx to the bright
outlook lies in the risk of interest rates rising further.
   ``That changes currency rates and starts a whole set of things
going that are difficult to plan for,'' Kearns said.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to rein in inflation by restraining
economic growth.
   A growing number of analysts are expressing concern that the Fed
could push interest rates so high and slow growth so much that it
unintentionally pushes the country into a recession.
   ``The biggest thing that we would fear would be ... hype on the
economy that would lead to Fed quick-trigger action,'' Welch said.

   Protesters demanding the dismantling of U.S.
garrisons in Spain tried to go over a wall and into a U.S.-Spanish
naval base but were turned back by police using clubs, rubber
bullets and tear gas, police said.
   No arrests or injuries were reported in Sunday's confrontation.
   The roughly 400 protesters, many with their faces covered, were
among about 5,000 people who had marched on the joint-use base,
police said. March organizers estimated the crowd at 15,000.
   The marchers, who also shouted anti-NATO slogans, walked nearly
10 miles to the base from the town of Puerto de Santa Maria. The
Atlantic Coast base is about 50 miles north of the Strait of
Gibraltar.
   The march was organized by regional pacifist groups.
   Spain and the United States signed a new eight-year pact on Dec.
1 that mandates removal of 72 U.S. F-16 fighter bombers from
Spanish soil by 1992. But it permits continued U.S. use of three
military bases, including Rota.
   The new agreement reduces the maximum number of U.S. troops
allowed to be stationed in Spain by 36 percent, from 12,545 to
8,078.
   Though a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Spain
remains outside the alliance's military command structure.

   An Army Chinook helicopter Saturday found
the body of a climber on Mount Rainier after a two-day search that
began with the discovery of his climbing partner's frozen corpse.
   The helicopter's crew spotted the body of 26-year-old Peter
Derdowski of Stateline, Nev., around noon at the 9,400-foot mark of
Carbon Glacier, on the mountain's north side, said Cy Hentges,
Mount Rainier National Park spokesman.
   A crew of six to eight climbers were prevented from getting the
body because thunderstorms made it unsafe for a helicopter to fly
into the area, a Mt. Rainier dispatcher said. Rescue crews will try
again Sunday, he said.
   ``He apparently slipped off Liberty Ridge as he tried to come
back down,'' Hentges said. ``He apparently died of the fall.''
   Derkdowski's climbing partner, 33-year-old Richard Mooney of
South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was found dead below Liberty Cap on the
14,410-foot mountain Thursday by two others in the climbing party.
   Larry Duin, 26, and Steve Newell, 27, both of South Lake Tahoe,
came upon Mooney's body Thursday at the 13,700-foot level and
descended to alert authorities, who dispatched 30 searchers and
three helicopters to look for Derdowski.
   Derdowski apparently had left Mooney to find the two other
climbers, Hentges said.
   Mooney's body was taken to the county medical examiner.
   Derdowski is survived by a wife and a 9-month old son. Mooney
was single.
   The deaths brought to 11 the number of men killed while climbing
Mount Rainier since 1979.

Sunday.
   Agency spokesman Mitsuru Akiyama said the No. 103 Koryo Maru, a
125-ton trawler with 16 crewmembers aboard, was seized southeast of
Cape Nossapu, 680 miles northwest of Tokyo, at around 2:45 a.m.
Saturday (1:45 p.m. EDT Friday).
   He said the fishing boat was within territory claimed by the
Soviets.
   The Foreign Ministry has asked the Soviet Union for an

   Thousands of students huddled in wind-swept
Tiananmen Square on Sunday after the first night of a hunger strike
for democracy, ignoring government appeals they end their protest.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang on Saturday urged the students
not to disrupt the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who
arrives Monday for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years. The
official Beijing Daily announced the central square will be cleared
of all pedestrians and traffic on Monday.
   Zhao also told a workers' group Saturday in the Great Hall of
the People, adjoining the square, that the government is seriously
considering ways to promote democracy and end official corruption.
Both are student demands.
   About 3,500 students from more than a dozen universities, all
wearing white headbands to signify participation in the fast,
converged on the square Saturday afternoon and evening. However, by
Sunday morning there were only about 1,800 who appeared to be
participating. They were encircled by about 1,000 other non-fasting
students.
   Police made no attempt to interfere with the protest.
   But the Beijing Daily said the square will be closed to
pedestrians from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Monday (7:30 p.m. EDT
Sunday to 7:30 a.m. EDT Monday) and on Tuesday from 8 a.m. to noon.
   Zhao told the workers Saturday that democratic changes and
corruption will be discussed next month when the Standing Committee
of China's legislature meets.
   ``Every patriotic Chinese citizen should safeguard the dignity
of the motherland and its international image,'' the official
Xinhua News Agency paraphrased Zhao as saying. ``Nobody should do
anything to impede or jeopardize the summit.''
   Zhao's remarks followed a meeting of the ruling Politburo last
week that endorsed his moderate line toward student demands,
according to Sunday editions of The New York Times.
   The newspaper, quoting three unidentified Chinese familiar with
the proceedings, said the result of the meeting held Wednesday and
Thursday was to bolster Zhao's faction and its calls for economic
and political reform.
   Leading activist Wang Dan of Beijing University said fasting
students may still be in the square when the Soviet leader arrives
Monday for the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years. ``As for
whether we will disrupt Mr. Gorbachev's visit to China, that
depends on the government,'' he said.
   ``We will persist to the end,'' said fasting graduate students
from Qinghua University. ``This is a last resort.''
   Early Sunday, hundreds of students and workers began flocking to
the square with banners and posters to express support for the fast.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong arrived at the square shortly before 3
a.m. Sunday but was shouted down when he tried to address the
crowd. Chen was accompanied by State Education Committee Minister
Li Tieying and they left 15 minutes later.
   About 30 students met earlier with Yan Mingfu, head of the
Communist Party's United Front Work Department. He was the
highest-ranking party official to confer with the demonstrators.
Two student leaders reported that he told them that some party
members want to use the turmoil as a reason to stop reforms.
   The hunger strikers, wearing white headbands and sashes, sat
inside a protective cordon of several thousand non-fasting students
in the vast square that is the symbolic center of power in China.
   As temperatures dropped after sunset Saturday to below 50
degrees, many pulled on jackets or covered themselves with
blankets, while others wrapped themselves in their red and white
banners.
   Shortly before midnight, four trucks and two buses of police
pulled up to the square and security forces stood watching. They
did not intervene.
   The fast began Saturday evening after the students marched
several hours from their campuses to the square. It is the latest
in a month-old student campaign for a free press, human rights, an
end to official corruption and other reforms.
   After repeated student marches, sit-ins and a class boycott, the
government made a major concession Friday by offering to meet
Monday with an independent student group.
   However, students said they were still discussing with officials
the terms of a possible dialogue. They were dissatisfied with
government conditions that include a limit on the number of student
delegates and insistence that students from state-sponsored
organizations also attend. Students also said they wanted the talks
to be broadcast live.
   If talks are held, the students want the government to guarantee
not to punish students who have protested; to observe
constitutional guarantees of free speech; and to reinstate a
liberal newspaper editor fired for resisting censorship.
   China announced a one-day delay in the arrival of U.S. warships
in Shanghai so the event does not coincide with Gorbachev's planned
visit to the port city. The Foreign Ministry said Saturday the
ships will make the port call May 19, the day after Gorbachev's
visit.
   The announcement appeared to defuse a major source of diplomatic
friction between the Soviets and the Chinese.

<TEXT>
   SAN BERNDARDINO, CALIF _ The braking systems were faulty on two
locomotives of a freight train that thundered down the steep Cajon
Pass, smashed into 11 homes and killed four people, investigators
said Saturday.
   National Transportation Safety Board acting Chairman James
Kolstad told reporters Saturday night that the so-called dynamic
brakes failed to work. But it was too early to tell if that caused
the wreck, he said.
   Locomotives have air brakes which apply pressure to the wheels;
dynamic brakes reverse the direction of the wheels, he explained.
   ``It appears a great majority of the cars were braking at the
time of the accident,'' he said.
   The search of the wreckage ended Saturday afternoon, and heavy
equipment began removing the twisted train cars that flew off
curved tracks into the homes Friday.
   The body of a crewman was found at 2:30 a.m., hours after a man
was pulled alive from his crumbled home. No one else was reported
missing.
   Twenty-nine families were evacuated from their homes because the
wrecked cars lay over an underground gas line. By Saturday night,
19 families still had to remain out of their houses, including
those houses hit in the derailment, said Theresa Schroeder of the
local Red Cross.
   The 69-car Southern Pacific freight hauling a sandy mineral
raced down 4,109-foot Cajon Pass between the San Bernardino and San
Gabriel Mountains, derailed on a curve and hit 11 homes about 7:40
a.m. Friday.
   The crew radioed to a dispatcher that it was out of control at
90 mph.
   ``The train was all over the place,'' said a witness, Al Dorame.
``It looked like a toy in a sandbox. ... Some of the people thought
it was an earthquake.''
   The dead were identified as stepbrothers Jason Thompson, 9, and
Tyson White, 7; conductor Everett S. Crown, 36, a 17-year Southern
Pacific employee; and brakeman Allan R. Reiss, 44, an 18-year
employee, whose body was not found until Saturday morning.
   Three trainmen and six other people were injured.
   One of the injured, Christopher Shaw, 24, survived for hours
under the wreckage. He was found Friday evening later in a pocket
of air under rail cars and the sandy cargo that crushed his home.
   He had surgery to have a pin put in a broken leg and was in
serious condition at San Bernardino County Medical Center, said
nursing supervisor Helen Ramirez.
   Officials of the NTSB, Southern Pacific, the Federal Railroad
Administration and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers met to
coordinate the investigation, said NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   Plans included on-site investigations and study of three event
recorders that monitored train functions. ``They will certainly
tell the speed of the train and might tell about brake
application,'' Lopatkiewicz said.
   Investigators will also examine the train crew's history of work
performance and whether there was evidence of alcohol or drug use,
he said. Surviving crewmen will be interviewed, but probably not
Saturday, he said.
   Shaw was half-asleep when his home was flattened. He lay there
all day and into the night before he was found, still conscious
beneath the rubble.
   Rescuers extended an oxygen tube and encouraged him during the
1{ hours it took to free him. Debris had apparently formed a cave
with enough oxygen to sustain him, said Gene Brooks, a rescue
supervisor.
   Shaw's mother, Maryann Shaw, watched nervously during the rescue.
   ``I was so confused,'' Mrs. Shaw said. ``I told him that his
mama was outside and I was out here for him.''
   The train was going from Mojave in the high desert to Long Beach
with a load of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, components
of potash, a mineral used to make fertilizer and soap, railroad
spokesmen said.
   The tracks were expected to remain closed at least a day,
forcing the detour of 15 freights and two passenger trains.

   A strong earthquake in the South
Pacific early Sunday shook the tiny Kermadec Islands, 760 miles
north of here, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research
said.
   Initial reports said the quake measured 6.6 on the Richter
scale, said a spokesman for the department's Seismological
Observatory in Wellington, the capital.
   No information was immediately available on injuries or damage
on the remote islands, which measure only about 13 square miles and
belong to New Zealand.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas, while one measuring 7 is considered a major earthquake,
capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

   Charging riot police lashing out
with truncheons and shields Sunday dispersed thousands of
protesters who marched for a second day to protest the death of a
radical student.
   About 5,000 riot police tore into a crowd of about the same
number in front of the provincial government headquarters.
Screaming protesters were trampled underfoot as troopers broke up
the crowd after some people tried to force their way past police.
   Radical students pelted police with rocks and bricks as fighting
surged up and down Kwangju's main street.
   Some police and protesters were hurt in the fighting. Police
officials said they had no figures on injuries.
   Protesters were marching to denounce authorities over the death
of radical student Lee Chol-kyu. Dissidents claim police tortured
and killed him.
   Lee's body was found Wednesday in a reservoir near Kwangju, a
provincial capital 170 miles south of Seoul. Police, who were
hunting Lee for anti-government acitivies, have denied any
involvement in the death.
   In Seoul, officials said pathology tests were conducted Sunday
to determine if Lee's body contained plankton, which they said
would suggest that he died by drowning. Initial results would be
released Monday, they said.
   Radical student leaders told a news conference Sunday they would
appeal to Amnesty International to conduct an independent
investigation of the death if an official Korean probe concludes
police were not responsible.
   Dissident leaders called during the protest Sunday for the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's government and demanded the
expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.
   The dissidents claim Roh and the United States are trying to
impose authoritarian rule on the country.

<HEAD>Cabinet Approves Shamir Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Cabinet on Sunday approved Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's long-awaited plan for elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The vote was 20-6.
   The four-page, 20-point Shamir plan passed easily, largely
because it sidestepped controversial points such as foreign
supervision of elections, participation of 140,000 Arabs in east
Jerusalem and a timetable for the balloting.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon led right-wing opposition to the
proposal. He was joined in voting against the plan by two other
ministers from the Likud Bloc members, two from the center-left
Labor and one from the National Religious Party.
   Sharon was quoted by an aide as telling the Cabinet it was ``a
sure recipe for more violence and terror'' and one that could raise
``a danger of war.''
   He was quoted by an aide as proposing his own seven-point plan,
which calls for extending Israeli law to Jewish settlements in the
occupied lands, an act equivalent to annexation.
   Sharon, a member of Shamir's Likud Bloc, accused the Cabinet of
rushing into a decision because of the presence of a U.S. State
Department delegation led by Dennis Ross, chief of policy planning.
   Ross met with four moderate Palestinians but 11 others boycotted
the meeting in Jerusalem. The key topic was the elections proposal,
which Palestinians made clear would have to be endorsed by the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Five Palestinians who did not attend sent a letter to U.S.
officials criticizing the Shamir plan as ``grossly deficient.''
   The daily Yediot Ahronot said U.S. officials pushed for a
timetable on elections. It said Shamir believed elections could be
held within one year while Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin estimated
six months were needed.
   In addition to the timetable, the United States urged Israel to
allow 140,000 east Jerusalem Arabs to vote and to permit
international supervision of balloting.
   Shamir's plan does not refer to either issue. It reportedly
calls for electing 10 Palestinians from the occupied territories to
negotiate with Israel on an interim period of autonomy, with talks
to begin after three years on the final status of the territories.
   Israel hopes the plan will help end the 17-month Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories, in which at least 472 Arabs
and 21 Israelis have been killed.
   Israel captured the West Bank, Arab east Jerusalem and the Gaza
Strip from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel
later annexed east Jerusalem.

   Two crew members were killed in an explosion
and fire Saturday night aboard the aircraft carrier USS America
while the ship was operating in the western Atlantic, the Navy
announced Sunday.
   A statement issued by the Atlantic Fleet's Naval Air Force
headquarters in Norfolk, Va., where the America is based, said the
incident occurred about 7 p.m. EDT Saturday in carrier's No. 2 fuel
pump room.
   ``Shipboard firefighters successfully extinguised the fire with
no additional casualties,'' the statement said.
   The victims were identified as Petty Officer 3rd Class Richard
E. Childress, 22, of Ham Lake, Minn., and Airman Recruit Larry J.
Brunson, 19, of Akron, Ohio.
   ``An investigation into the cause of the explosion is now under
way,'' the Navy statement said.
   It said the America is continuing on her assigned mission, a
previously scheduled deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian
Ocean. The ship left Norfolk on Thursday.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev left Sunday for
Beijing and the first Soviet-Chinese summit meeting in 30 years.
   Gorbachev's morning departure, reported by the Tass news agency,
came a day early. He arrived in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, where
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesmen in Beijing said he would rest
before continuing to Beijing on Monday. The spokesman spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Tass called the visit to Irkutsk a ``working stop-over,'' and
said he had a ``warm talk with working people'' at the airport.
   Tass said Gorbachev was accompanied by Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze, who just returned from a visit to West Germany,
and Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, alternate Politburo
member Yuri Maslyukov and Health Minister Yevgeny Chazov.
   The last Soviet-Chinese summit was in 1959 when Nikita S.
Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung. Relations soured then as Mao
challenged the Soviet claim to leadership of the world communist
movement.
   Both sides expect Gorbachev's meetings with Deng Xiaoping will
normalize their governmental and party relations, and help ease the
remaining tensions along their 4,300-mile border.
   The Soviet Union announced last week that it will begin
withdrawing soldiers from its Mongolian ally on Monday, the day
Gorbachev's visit to China is to begin.
   Soviet soldiers were stationed in Mongolia, sandwiched between
the Soviet Union and China, because of border disputes that flared
briefly into fighting in the late 1960s.

   A West German relief worker who
disappeared 10 days ago returned on Sunday to his organization's
headquarters.
   Markus Quint arrived at the ASME-Humanitas base in this southern
town of Zahrani accompanied by Nabih Berri, head of the Shiite Amal
militia.
   Berri, also the justice minister in Lebanon's Moslem cabinet,
said his militia obtained Quint's release from kidnappers, but he
refused to identify the kidnappers.
   ``I don't want to say anything that will hurt Quint and his
colleagues,'' Berri said.
   Quint, wearing a brown track suit and smoking a cigarette,
turned to the pro-Syrian militia chief and thanked him for his help
in his return.
   Quint disappeared on May 4. There had been no claim of
responsibility.
   Palestinian guerrilla leaders had said unidentified kidnappers
were holding Quint in connection with the case of TWA hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   On Saturday, the West German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported
Quint had signed a letter saying he was abducted in connection with
Hamadi case. ``The kidnappers are demanding a mild sentence for
Hamadi,'' it said.
   West German officials did not comment on the report.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, faces life in prison if
convicted of murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of a
TWA jetliner and the slaying of an U.S. Navy diver on board. He
confessed to the hijacking but denies taking part in the murder.
   He is on trial in Frankfurt, West Germany. A verdict that is
expected Wednesday.
   There are 15 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was seized March
16, 1985.
   In addition, Jack Mann, an elderly Briton, disappeared Friday,
and his wife said she believes he has been kidnapped.
   ASME-Humanitas is a private organization that provides medical
aid, mainly to Palestinian refugees in the camps of Ein el-Hilweh
and Mieh Mieh.

<HEAD>Report: Israel and South Africa Involved in Technology Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper said Sunday that Israel's Mossad
secret service was involved in South African efforts to obtain
British missile technology.
   The Sunday Telegraph, a conservative weekly, attributed its
report to unidentified ``security sources in London.'' It said the
sources claimed Mossad and the South African arms manufacturer
Armscor were linked to an operation that led to the arrests of five
men in Paris last month in an arms deal.
   The report said, ``The ultimate goal of the Paris operation is
thought to have been for South Africa and Israel to undertake joint
development of a series of high-speed missiles for use by both
ground and air forces.''
   It claimed three of the men arested in Paris were Northern
Ireland Protestants who allegedly were negotiating with a South
African diplomat and a U.S. arms dealer to exchange British missile
parts made in Northern Ireland for South African arms.
   According to the newspaper, the plan involved smuggling parts of
the shoulder-launched Blowpipe missile to South Africa to enable
Armscor to develop its own missiles. It said Mossad wanted to
acquire the technology for Britain's Starstreak missile.
   Both the Blowpipe and Starstreak missiles are made at the Short
Brothers factory in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
   The Sunday Telegraph said Britain's MI6 intelligence service was
trying to determine how Protestant activists in Northern Ireland
received arms believed to have been purchased with South African
money and shipped through militia groups in Lebanon.
   ``It is here that sources believe Mossad actively assisted with
the South African operation,'' the newspaper said.
   Protestant and Roman Catholic militants have been battling in
Northern Ireland for nearly 20 years. The Catholics want to unite
the British province, where Protestants outnumber Caholics 3-2,
with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and allied Druse gunners showered
the besieged Christian heartland with sporadic artillery fire on
Sunday, and gun battles broke out in the hills above Beirut.
   Police said Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian troops were locked in
sniper fire and rocket-propelled grenade duels with Syrian and
Druse forces at the mountaintop town of Souk el-Gharb southeast of
Beirut.
   The strategic town sits atop a road network leading from the
Druse territory in the Chouf mountains to the Christian enclave
north and northeast of Beirut. No casualties were reported at the
Souk el-Gharb front.
   Police said at least 40 shells were fired from Syrian-controlled
west Beirut onto a coastal stretch running trough the port of
Byblos, 19 miles north of Beirut. No casualties were reported in
the barrage, apparently aimed at preventing ships from entering the
harbor.
   At least 359 people have been killed and 1,393 wounded since the
current round of fighting in the 14-year-old war broke out March 8.
The confrontation began when Aoun's gunboats and helicopter
gunships blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of
Beirut.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party
retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave. The Syrians later
joined the bombardment and sealed off the enclave's land and sea
outlets.
   The fighting Sunday came despite a truce called by the Arab
League, the fourth cease-fire called by the group in two months.
   Arab League mediators proclaimed the latest cease-fire Thursday,
calling it an ``inland truce'' to halt the shelling duels that
wreaked havoc on Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors and many
summer resort towns in Lebanon's central mountains.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, a secretary-general of the 22-member Arab
League, said he would begin new negotiations with the warring
factions this week. Ibrahimi was in Damascus on Sunday where he met
with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa.
   Syria's allies said they would keep shelling the Christian
coast, despite the truce, to prevent arms supplies to Aoun's 20,000
troops.
   They contend that at least three ships carrying arms from Iraq
were waiting in international waters off Lebanon to cruise in and
resupply the Christian forces. Aoun's spokesmen have denied the
claim.
   Iraq is Syria's main Arab foe. The Syrians maintain 40,000
troops stationed in 70 percent of Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League.
   Aoun has charged the Syrians have become an occupation force
because they sided with the Moslems. He has vowed to drive them out
of Lebanon.

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov said
Sunday that the reforms of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
have not gone far enough to cure an ailing economy or bring
democracy.
   The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner flew to Italy on Saturday with
his wife, Yelena Bonner, to speak at an Italian Socialist Party
congress in the northern city of Milan.
   Sakharov, who was recently elected to the new Soviet parliament,
said that while Gorbachev's reforms were ``moving in the right
direction'' in foreign affairs, ``there are many aspects that are
causing profound distress.''
   ``Economic reforms go ever more slowly and the people are losing
interest in their work because they can't buy anything,'' he said.
   He said the stagnation was occurring because the government
dismantled old bureaucratic structures but has not created new ones.
   The 67-year-old physicist criticized Gorbachev for emergency
measures he had taken to limit demonstrations in the wake of
nationalist uprisings.
   ``We are in a blind alley, and there have been various political
decisions taken lately which I will not hesitate to define as
anti-democratic,'' he said.
   Sakharov was detained for nearly seven years in the northern
city of Gorky after he criticized the Soviets' 1979 military
intervention in Afghanistan.

   More than 100,000 North Koreans greeted Iranian
President Ali Khamenei on Sunday as he arrived in their capital to
drum up aid for rebuilding his country, devastated by the
eight-year war with Iraq.
   Crowds lined the streets of Pyongyang shouting ``Friendship and
unity!'' according to the Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo.
   Khamenei arrived after a six-day visit to China and was received
by North Korean President Kim II Sung at the presidential palace,
the agency said. Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, quoted
Kim as saying he looked forward to an expansion of ties between
North Korea and Iran.
   The radio said Khamenei told his host: ``Fortunately our
countries enjoy friendly ties at the best possible level.''
   Neither the North Korean agency nor Tehran radio said how long
Khamenei would stay in Pyongyang.
   Tehran has been strengthening relations with non-Western
industrialized nations that could help its postwar construction.
   China and North Korea were the main suppliers of arms to the
Islamic Republic throughout the Iran-Iraq war, when a Western arms
embargo virtually isolated Iran. A cease-fire took effect Aug. 20.
   Both China and North Korea hope to pick up lucrative
reconstruction projects in Iran.
   The North Korean daily Rodong Shinmun said: ``The Korean people
will steadily develop friendly and cooperative relations with
Iran'' in their common struggle against ``imperialism in ideas of
independence, peace and friendship,'' according to the North Korean
agency.

<DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot troops Sunday broke up a march
by thousands of people protesting the death of a radical student
they claim was tortured and killed by police.
   Police used clubs and shields on the crowd of about 5,000 who
gathered outside the provincial government headquarters in Kwangju,
170 miles southwest of Seoul.
   Some protesters were trampled as people tried to force their way
past police. Injuries were seen during the violent confrontation
but police said they had no figures.
   Radical students pelted police with rocks and bricks as fighting
surged up and down Kwangju's main street. Hundreds of onlookers
jeered and yelled insults as police tried to clear the street by
marching in lines with interlocked shields.
   ``Down with the military dictatorship!'' protesters chanted.
``Drive out the Yankees!''
   A larger but less-violent protest was held Saturday, and a march
by about 1,000 people earlier on Sunday was peaceful.
   The marches were called by radical students to protest the death
of Lee Chul-kyu, whose body was found Wednesday in a reservoir near
Kwangju.
   Authorities fear Lee's death will keep heightening tensions in
Kwangju, which marks the anniversary this week of the May 18, 1980,
uprising in which at least 192 people were killed. Many students
blame President Roh Tae-woo, a former military general, for the
bloody suppression of the uprising.
   All police in Kwangju and nearby areas were put on special alert.
   Dissidents claim Lee, who was being sought by police for
anti-government activities, was tortured to death by authorities.
Police said an autopsy last week showed no signs of torture and
that pathology tests Sunday confirmed the existence of plankton in
his body, indicating death by drowning.
   To ensure the credibility of the tests, authorities allowed two
independent medical experts and opposition lawmakers to take part
in or witness the process.
   Radical student leaders told reporters they would appeal to
Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, to
conduct an independent investigation if the official Korean probe
concluded police were blameless.
   Kim Hyung-jang, one of the student leaders, claimed government
pathologists were helping cover up police involvement. ``We cannot
trust them,'' he told the news conference.
   During the march, dissidents called for the overthrow of Roh and
demanded the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South
Korea.
   The dissidents claim Roh and the United States are trying to
impose authoritarian rule on the country.
   Radical students and dissidents, estimated by government
officials at 10,000, are a well-organized minority in South Korea's
42 million population. But they lack public support because of
their violent tactics and extreme views.

   Scottish nationalists blew up a stone-crushing
plant because the quarry where it was located was going to be used
as a nuclear waste dump, an anonymous telephone caller claimed on
Sunday.
   Police have not commented on the cause of the fire Saturday
night that destroyed the four-story plant at the Glensanda granite
quarry near the Scottish town of Oban on the Movern peninsula.
   There were no injuries.
   Press Association, the domestic news agency, said it received a
call at its London office from a man who claimed the plant was
bombed by the Scottish National Liberation Army.
   The caller said the plant was attacked because the quarry was to
be used for the disposal of civilian and military nuclear waste.
   The Scottish group is a shadowy nationalist organization that
has sent letter bombs to government ministers in recent years,
including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Secretary for
Scotland Malcolm Rifkind.
   Scotland Yard blamed the organization for a 1983 bomb attack on
London's Woolwich Arsenal that slightly injured four soldiers and a
civilian.

<TEXT>
   The meeting between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Deng
Xiaoping will alter a 30-year-old constant in the geopolitical
equation _ the Sino-Soviet split. The result will be a more complex
world with hazier alliances.
   For Gorbachev, the dynamic 57-year-old leader of the Soviet
Union, the visit is one step of many on his way into history.
   ``He will bring his people peace on their southern flank,'' said
one Asian diplomat. ``He will also show the world that having dealt
with the West, he can now deal with the East.''
   For the 84-year-old Deng, the summit could constitute the last
waltz of a tumultuous 60-year career as a soldier of the revolution
and guiding force of the world's most populous country.
   ``A successful summit will be the icing on the cake of Deng's
career as a revolutionary,'' said a Western expert. ``It will
cement China's standing as an international force.''
   The United States has welcomed the summit as a development
destined to reduce international tensions. But it also has been at
pains to emphasize to Beijing the importance Washington attaches to
its ties with China.
   U.S. officials reacted with glee when President Bush managed a
hurried visit in February, months ahead of Gorbachev. They also
expressed satisfaction that the U.S. 7th Fleet will arrive in
Shanghai on the heels of Gorbachev's departure.
   China for its part emphasizes that the summit does not mean a
new socialist bloc. On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin
Guihua said China would not enter ``into alignment or develop
strategic ties with any big power or power groups.''
   The summit will not be without drama _ both international and
domestic.
   Chinese students, who have been demonstrating for a month for
democracy and freedom, are planning a special ``welcoming session''
for the Soviet leader, well-regarded in this tightly-controlled
country for redefining the boundaries of dissent in his country.
   Coinciding with Gorbachev's arrival, Soviet troops in Mongolia
begin their withdrawal as part of Moscow's promise to cut tensions
on the Soviet-Chinese border.
   Knowing Gorbachev's penchant for unexpected gifts, the meeting
will not likely lack surprises.
   Two possibilities, according to Xing Shugang, a Soviet expert at
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, would be to give ground on
the border or provide a timetable for pledged withdrawal of 200,000
troops stationed near China.
   Hanging over the summit is a 10-year war in Cambodia that both
nations say they want to end. Vietnam, a Soviet client state,
invaded Cambodia and ousted the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge in
December 1978.
   China will attempt to keep Cambodia in the foreground while the
Soviets will try to avoid the issue, diplomats said.
   The critical point, according to diplomats, is whether Moscow
will accept Beijing's desire to be the main peace broker, thereby
recognizing China's traditional claim to influence in the region.
   ``Cambodia is the touchstone of the summit for the Chinese,''
said an Asian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They
will stop any communique until the last minute so they can get what
they want.''
   ``For the Russians,'' he said, ``the main goal is the symbolism
of these meetings. They are in a better position because they don't
want anything specific.''
   Solutions to other problems, such as a border dispute and their
world views, depend on Cambodia, he said.
   When communist China was founded in 1949, the Soviet Union was
the first country to recognize it, and China relied on Soviet
assistance to develop.
   Moscow and Beijing signed a strategic alliance, and thousands of
Soviet advisers flooded the country, setting up industrial projects.
   But relations soured in the late 1950s and early 1960s because
of an ideological split centering around Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev's policy that socialist countries could peacefully
coexist with countries in the West. A personality clash between
Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung and Khrushchev added to the problem.
   Officials are optimistic this summit will be an improvement on
the last one, between Khrushchev and Mao in October 1959, when the
Soviet leader stormed to the airport with a dour look on his face.
   Relations hit a low point in 1969 when the two clashed
repeatedly on the border.
   But following political changes in both countries, ties began to
improve in the late 1970s. Trade began again and is now worth about
$3.25 billion a year.

   Voters Sunday chose from among writers, a
weightlifter, a popular investigator, and many others across the
political spectrum in a second-round election to fill the remaining
198 seats in a new parliament.
   More than 1,200 candidates, an average of six per district, were
vying for seats in the Congress of People's Deputies left open
after March 26 elections. The seats being contested were those in
which no candidate received a majority of the vote.
   In March, voters rejected dozens of top government and party
leaders in Moscow, Kiev and Leningrad. Most officials embarrassed
on March 26 did not run again.
   On Sunday, one district in Leningrad fielded 34 candidates.
Another in Kiev had 33. In many districts, another run-off election
was likely before a winner was decided.
   Results were expected to trickle in Monday or Tuesday.
   Candidates included such figures as Vitaly Korotich, the editor
of Ogonyok magazine, in the Ukrainian city of Kharkov; prosecutor
Nikolai Ivanov, an anti-corruption crusader in Leningrad; Olympic
weightlifting champion Yuri Vlasov, and playwright Mikhail Shatrov,
in Moscow; commentator Alexander Bovin, and Anatoly Ivanov, editor
of the ultra-conservative monthly Molodaya Gvardiya, in Zagorsk.
   The new 2,250-member parliament was created by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in a reform that he said will strengthen the
legislature. It will choose the president and the new ruling
Supreme Soviet, but less than two weeks from the May 25 first
meeting, many of its functions and procedures have yet to be
decided.
   In Moscow's Kunsovsky district, a retired army colonel said he
and many other veterans voted for Afghan war hero Alexander
Rudskoy. ``We fought during the last war and understand the man
well,'' said the colonel, who refused to identify himself.
   In Leningrad, prosecutor Ivanov, who led a broad anti-corruption
probe, was a favorite among 33 candidates seeking a seat.
   In Kiev, another 33 candidates were seeking the seat that local
Communist Party leader Konstantin Masyk lost March 26. Among them
was theater director Les Taniuk, a leader of the People's Front
group that seeks greater independence for the Baltic republics.
   In the Baltic republics there were eight races. One candidate in
the Latvian capital of Riga was prosecutor Janis Djenitis, a party
hardliner who topped the list of most unpopular Latvians in a poll
conducted last year by a youth newspaper. Another was political
reformer Mavrick Wulfson.
   The first vote on March 26 hurt the Communist Party's prestige.
Gorbachev said it showed Soviets were enthusiastic about reforms
but frustrated that local leaders were lagging behind.
   Of the 198 seats up in Sunday's election, 195 were in districts
were voters rejected the choices given them in March. In three
districts in Armenia, repeat elections were held because fewer than
half of the voters participated the first time.

   When President Bush looks for votes on Capitol
Hill to sustain a minimum wage bill veto or win passage of his
savings and loan bailout plan, his clout is limited by the fact
most congressmen ran far ahead of him in their districts last
November.
   House members and political analysts differ among themselves on
the impact of Bush's lack of coattails.
   But there is no argument that while Bush was carrying 40 of the
50 states, voters by the millions were opting for divided
government by choosing a Republican president and a Democratic
Congress.
   ``There was a big message in this election and George Bush
picked it up,'' said Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the House
Democratic whip.
   Coelho praised Bush for ``trying to establish a level of trust
that hasn't existed for 12 years.''
   ``You run independent of everyone,'' said Republican Rep. Lynn
Martin of Illinois.
   But she insisted that a president's persuasive ability is not
tied to the results of the last election.
   ``If the president calls you and asks you to vote for something,
any living member of Congress who says it is easy to say no, is
absolutely saying that for a press statement,'' she said. ``After
the election it isn't Democrat or Republican, it's the president.''
   An analysis of the 1988 election results, published in the
National Journal, found that Bush ran ahead of the successful House
candidate in only 56 of the 435 House districts.
   Bush out polled only 26 Republicans and 30 Democrats. Half of
the Democrats were from the South, Bush's strongest region in the
presidential vote.
   While those numbers might be viewed as a sign of the president's
electoral weakness, they might more accurately reflect the strength
of House members. Of the 435 House winners in 1988, only 63
received under 60 percent of the vote.
   By contrast, when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, he ran
ahead of 59 Republican winners. In addition his coattails were
credited with giving Republicans control of the Senate for the
first time in a quarter century and with a GOP pickup of 33 House
seats.
   Did that make a difference?
   ``It was very easy to deal with reluctant Republicans or
persuadable Democrats'' during Reagan's first two years in office,
said Rich Bond, a Republican consultant who was involved in trying
to generate support for Reagan's agenda.
   Reagan's clout on Capitol Hill diminished sharply after the 1982
midterm election when the Democrats won back 26 House seats.
   ``It was back to business as usual,'' said Bond.
   ``I've always been the Republican in whose district our
presidential candidates did least well,'' said Rep. Bill Green of
New York whose district runs along the East Side of Manhattan.
Green was re-elected with 61 percent of the vote, while Bush was
receiving only 33 percent against Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``I was the only Republican elected in a district Reagan didn't
carry in '84,'' said Green.
   Green describes himself as a progressive Republican and his
support for Reagan in House votes declined from a high of 55
percent of the time in 1981 to 38 percent in 1986, according to
Congressional Quarterly.
   The New York congressman said, ``Plainly in 1981 one of the
things Reagan had going for him in winning votes in Congress was
the ability to persuade marginal Democrats in certain parts of the
country that if they didn't come along they'd be very vulnerable in
1982.
   ``Obviously, that kind of capacity is lacking (for Bush) at this
point.''
   Tom Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution, said, ``We're getting to the point where there will be
zero correlation between presidential and congressional returns.
   ``It reinforces the view on Capitol Hill that their electoral
fates are not shared with the president and therefore there are no
electoral ties that bind. Whatever incentives they have for working
with the president, elections are not one of them.''
   ``Not many members of Congress are going to quake in their boots
when presidents try to force them to do things,'' said Norman
Ornstein, a political scientist at the American Enterprise
Institute.
   ``Presidents win by big margins; presidents win by small
margins; members of Congress go marching on,'' he said.
   Stephen Hess, who served on the White House staffs of presidents
Eisenhower and Nixon, said members of Congress get a sense of a
president's clout in their districts from polls and letters and
from their trips back home.
   ``They don't need to look at last November's election returns to
know how well George Bush stands in their district and, of course,
George Bush probably stands in their district better than he did on
November 8.''
   ``A president is not a hapless giant,'' said Hess. ``There are
appointments members want, there are grants that they want, there
are an awful lot of symbolic things that they want.''
   Lynn Martin echoed that view.
   ``What the president has to offer members is not really
electability,'' she said. ``It's coming in for fund-raisers, it is
the White House, it is members feeling they are working with the
president of the United States to accomplish something.''

<HEAD>Soviet Exit Permits At Record Heights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Emigration from the Soviet Union is soaring to
new heights, sending thousands of Germans, Armenians, Pentecostals
as well as Jews, on their way to new lives in other countries.
   In the first four months of this year, 57,000 exit permits were
granted while the Soviets also moved closer to adopting laws that
will ease most of the restrictions of the past.
   Richard Schifter, director of the State Department's human
rights office, was shown drafts of some of the legislation in
Moscow where he worked on the human rights issue before and during
the two-day visit last week of Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   Beginning in September, Soviet lawyers and judges will be coming
to the United States for extended visits to study American legal
procedures _ another sign of the changes brought about by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union reached an all-time high
in 1979, as superpower relations were improved during the period
known as detente. That year, 51,320 left the country with visas for
Israel but most of them wound up in the United States.
   Last month, 4,557 Jews left, the highest figure for any single
month since October 1979, the peak year.
   The issuance of 57,000 permits this January through April points
to a new record, though actual departure generally lags for a few
months behind receipt of a permit.
   Schifter said the figures break down this way: 27,000 ethnic
Germans were granted permits to go to West Germany; 17,500 Jews for
Israel; 3,500 Pentecostals for Israel, 5,000 Armenians for the
United States; and 4,000 others for the United States and elsewhere.
   If past practice is a guide, nearly 90 percent of the Jews with
permits for Israel will revise their destinations once they have
left the Soviet Union, and most of them will come to the United
States.
   Pentecostals, who also contend authorities severely restrict
their religious practices, are invariably given permits for Israel
and also wind up elsewhere.
   Schifter was encouraged by the projected changes in Soviet law
as well as by the rise in emigration.
   While in Moscow he was shown a draft of a decree that would
repeal a requirement that a would-be emigrant have an invitation
from a close relative.
   The restriction had been applied to German ethnics seeking
permission to go to West Germany and to Jews and Pentecostals.
   Schifter also was shown a draft of another legal directive
abolishing the right of parents to block the departure of would-be
emigrants.
   The Soviets, he said, also are lowering another barrier:
involvement in the past in sensitive work.
   All prospective emigrants who were engaged in security-related
occupations will be eligible for permits five years after leaving
the job.
   There will be special exceptions, but only high-level officials
rather than bureaucrats in the security agencies will have the
power to invoke them.
   The easing of the restriction will not be retroactive. But,
Schifter said, Soviet authorities said they would consider old
applications ``in light of the new rules.''
   The State Department official said a new law assuring freedom of
religion would leave the Ukrainian Catholic Church as ``the only
problem.''
   He said Soviet authorities consider the church a source of
Ukrainian nationalism.
   Generally, though, most of the signs are positive.
   One example: All the Jewish ``refuseniks'' invited to the U.S.
embassy for a Passover Seder in 1987 attended also by
then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz _ some 40 of whom
previously had been denied visas _ have since been permitted to
leave the country.

   Young bicyclists who break the law this
summer will be hauled off to Bicycle Court for a spin on the wheels
of justice.
   Those convicted won't be put on a chain gang, but they could be
sentenced to a week with crayons and a coloring book full of safety
hints.
   The kids' court was designed to simulate the legal system and
teach youths a lesson in safety. The program was discontinued last
year, when youths served as judge and jury, but has been revamped
by the police department in time for this summer, safety officer
Jerry Kittel said.
   This time, a police officer will mete out justice, Kittel said.
   ``Some kids got let go because they were friends with the kids
serving as court officers,'' he said. ``Others got pretty stiff
penalties because they were not friends with the kids serving on
the court.''
   Children age 7 to 9 who are convicted in Bicycle Court this year
must color a safety coloring book. Youths 10 to 13 must write
essays on bicycle safety.
   Each has one week to complete the ``sentence.''
   Bicycle Court will be held at the police station once a week
beginning later this month. Kittel said he expects a full court
docket once school gets out.

   This city claimed champion status in
the battle of the breakfasts when 33,869 locals turned out to dine
on thousands of pounds of pancakes washed down with 600 gallons of
coffee.
   Springfield claimed the title of world's biggest breakfast
Saturday morning when volunteers who had spent 12 hours mixing
pancake batter served up a four-hour meal that would not have won
approval from Weight Watchers.
   The pancake recipe included 3,000 pounds of flour, 600 egg yolks
and 400 gallons of water. The final product was drenched in 200
gallons of maple syrup.
   ``We're getting it down to a science,'' said Amy Barron, a
spokeswoman for the event.
   But the city's claim to glory could be fleeting. Battle Creek,
Mich., citizens will try to reclaim the title next month when they
convene to share their own mass breakfast.
   The Springfield eat-a-thon marked the 14th time that the city,
which is celebrating its 353rd birthday, has gone up against Battle
Creek.
   The rivalry dates to 1976, when Springfield promoters staged a
Bicentennial bid to wrest Battle Creek's record for the world
largest breakfast table.
   Last year, Battle Creek claimed a turnout of 32,000, and
Springfield had 31,279.
   The Michigan city had established its claim during celebrations
marking the 100th anniversary of the Kellogg Co. in 1952.

   Two Soviet trade officials arrived in
Taiwan on Sunday for an international economic meeting, the first
known visit by Soviet officials to this staunchly anti-communist
island.
   Yuri V. Akhremenko and Vladimir Ivanov are to attend as
observers the three-day annual meeting of the Pacific Basin
Economic Council, which promotes economic cooperation in the
Pacific rim.
   During a stopover in Tokyo, the two were quoted by Taiwanese
reporters as saying the Soviet Union intended to become a member of
the council.
   Their arrival came as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev flew
to China for the first Soviet-Chinese summit in three decades.
   About 300 bankers and business leaders from 14 countries and
territories are to attend the Taiwan conference, which begins
Tuesday.
   Akhremenko is executive secretary of the Soviet Union's National
Committee for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. Ivanov is chairman
of the Pacific Region Research Department of the Institute of World
Economics and International Relations.
   Taiwan has issued special travel permits instead of entry visas
to the Soviet representatives. Foreign Ministry officials said the
ministry would not stamp official seals on their passports to avoid
giving the impression that Taiwan recognizes the Soviet Union.
   The Nationalist government on Taiwan has no diplomatic ties with
the Soviet Union and has long considered it a hostile nation.
   The Nationalists, who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to communist forces on the mainland, have claimed the
Soviets aided the Chinese Communists' victory.
   However, Taiwan's indirect trade with the Soviet Union has grown
significantly in the past year as the government adopted a more
liberal trade policy to promote trade exchanges with countries in
Eastern Europe.
   Last year, Taiwan's indirect exports to the Soviet Union totaled
$3.5 million, up about fivefold from 1987, while imports from the
Soviet Union increased threefold in the same period, totaling $3.1
million.
   In March, two Soviet women were allowed to participate in an
international beauty pageant in Taiwan. They were the first Soviet
citizens to be issued entry visas to Taiwan.

   Baltic activists Sunday called for
economic independence from Moscow by next year and demanded a trial
of Soviet officials blamed for killing or deporting thousands of
countrymen.
   The first gathering of grass-roots People's Fronts groups from
the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania stopped short
of demanding independence for their once-sovereign homelands.
   But the 400 activists meeting in the House of Political
Education in the Estonian capital urged Moscow not to ``obstruct
the restoration of state sovereignty'' in their homelands. Some
said the wording was a legal prelude to independence.
   In the final session of the two-day meeting, the Baltic assembly
said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political reforms failed to
halt economic decline, and the assembly called for economic
independence from Moscow by early next year.
   The resolution said the republics have the right to choose any
economic system that would meet material needs, protect the
environment, and break the stranglehold of Moscow-based planners
and officials.
   The assembly rejected a Kremlin plan that would concede control
over food and consumer products to the republics but retain control
over energy and at least half of regional heavy industry.
   Another resolution demanded that national leaders recognize the
``Stalinist genocide'' in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and convene
a trial of its perpetrators similar to the Nuremberg trials of Nazi
war criminals after World War II.
   The Baltic republics were absorbed by the Soviets in 1940 in a
secret deal between the Nazis and dictator Josef Stalin. Hundreds
of thousands of Baltic residents were deported or killed under
Stalin, including 80,000 in 1941 alone, the assembly draft charges.
   In a separate closed-door meeting, 61 Baltic representatives
elected in March to a new Soviet parliament, the Congress of
People's Deputies, hammered out a common platform to take to the
inaugural session that begins May 25.
   In four resolutions, including an appeal to all congressional
deputies, the Baltic lawmakers called for ``radical perestroika''
and asserted each republic's right to self-determination and choice
of its own ``historical path.'' Perestroika refers to Gorbachev's
policy of political reforms.
   The appeal was designed ``to rally all progressive deputies
wherever they may come from in order to find a common path to solve
economic, social, and ecological problems in the Soviet Union,''
said Estonian Popular Front leader Marju Lauristin.
   She told the assembly that the lawmakers also discussed
formation of a coalition with other progressive congress deputies
``so the struggle for perestroika can go on.''
   Such a coalition would be the first faction created in the new
parliament.

   Grief returned Sunday to this close-knit
community, which marked the first anniversary of a fiery bus crash
that killed 24 teen-agers and three adults returning from a church
outing.
   ``Anniversaries are always bad,'' Mayor Joseph Hutcherson said.
``And of course, it's Mother's Day, too. That will have quite an
impact, I'm afraid.''
   Hutcherson said thousands of people were expected for
observances that were to include the unveiling of a monument
listing the victims of one of the worst bus crashes in U.S.
history. A memorial service also was scheduled at a high school
stadium.
   Because of parking limitations, those attended the observances
were being brought in from local shopping centers on school buses.
The irony was not lost on the Rev. Mark Denney, who heads the
Community Memorial Committee.
   ``I don't think there ever will be a bus outing in this
community that is planned without concern for that carefree outing
that became so tragic,'' Denney said.
   The old school bus, owned by the Radcliff First Assembly of God,
was carrying 67 passengers home for a trip to a Cincinnati
amusement Park when it was hit by a pickup truck going the wrong
way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, Ky, on May 14, 1988.
   The truck driver, Larry Mahoney of Owen County, will be tried in
November on 27 counts of murder and count of driving while
intoxicated.
   The tragedy has prompted some in the community to campaign
against drunken driving.
   ``This is a crusade for me,'' said Army Sgt. Lee Williams, who
lost his wife and two daughters in the crash.
   Others said their goal has been simply returning to a normal
life.
   ``Drunk driving might be the worst thing in the world, but I
can't do anything about it now,'' said David Voglund, whose
13-year-old daughter was killed in the smashup.
   ``I'm still trying to distance myself from the whole thing
because I feel better that way,'' he said. Although he still thinks
about his daughter every day, Voglund said he has found an ally in
the passage of time.
   ``You don't feel nearly as lousy as you did six months ago,'' he
said. ``We're probably eventually going to be in pretty good shape.
Life does get better, or at least it has for us.''

   Warner Records is betting on Zvuki Mu, even though
its flashy lead singer, Peter Mamonov, insists on singing in
Russian. Columbia is going with Boris Grebenshikov, a rock 'n' roll
switch-hitter who can belt 'em out in both Russian and English.
   It's all part of a rush by major entertainment companies to
bring out albums by Soviet rock musicians.
   The companies hope the curiosity of Americans about contemporary
Russia will sell records. They say the Gorbachev era has made
Soviet culture a hot product.
   But record executives have widely varying views of how authentic
a sound the public will pay to hear. Some are deliberately
Westernizing the music, prompting critics to say Americans are
missing the real soundtrack of glasnost.
   At one end of the spectrum is Grebenshikov's solo album ``Radio
Silence,'' which Columbia Records plans to release in June. Ten of
the 12 songs are in English and were written especially for the
album. All were recorded in the West by a successful British
producer, David Stewart of the rock group the Eurythmics.
   It has poetic, dreamy lyrics that are not overtly political or
even distinctively Russian in content. Aside from the raspy voice
of the chain-smoking, pony-tailed Grebenshikov, ``Radio Silence''
bears little resemblance to his wildly popular Leningrad band
Akvarium (Aquarium), which has sold 3.5 million official albums and
countless underground tapes in the Soviet Union.
   Jack Rovner, Columbia vice president for marketing, said
Grebenshikov himself decided to do the album in English because,
otherwise, the music's appeal ``obviously would have limitations.''
   Some record companies, however, are taking the plunge into
Russian lyrics.
   In late April, Opal-Warner Bros. released an album entirely in
Russian by Zvuki Mu, a Moscow band whose name means ``Sounds of
Mu'' _ a tongue-in-cheek tribute both to ``The Sound of Music'' and
to the mooing of cows.
   Like Columbia, Opal-Warner used a big-name Western producer,
Brian Eno. But the recording was made in a Moscow studio and
preserved Zvuki Mu's homegrown flavor, a blend of intellectual rock
and funk. The initial 50,000 records, cassettes and compact disks
have just reached the stores.
   Zvuki Mu is scheduled to bring its rambunctious stage act to New
York's Lincoln Center in July. Grebenshikov also is planning a U.S.
tour, probably in the fall.
   Of all the new releases, perhaps the most authentic is ``Gruppa
Krovi'' (Blood Type), a collection of Russian protest songs and
dance numbers by singer-poet Viktor Tsoi and his punk group Kino
(Cinema). The album was recorded in the apartment of one of the
band members.
   Joanna Stingray, an American singer married to Kino guitarist
Yuri Kasparyan, said she recently sat in a plush Leningrad
restaurant with a group of Soviet rock performers reminiscing
``about the old days when they literally went hungry.''
   Today, she said, top Soviet stars travel back and forth to the
West and earn tens of thousands of dollars from record contracts,
as well as commanding thousands of rubles per concert in the Soviet
Union.
   ``It used to be they couldn't afford a taxi ride home at
night,'' Stingray said. ``Now they are getting rich, at least by
Soviet standards.''
   Kino's four-track recording was released in April by Gold Castle
Records, a small Los Angeles label, but has the muscle of Capitol
Records' distribution network behind it.
   ``We wanted to make sure it was the real Russian stuff,'' said
Gold Castle promotion director Jeff Heiman. ``That seemed like the
hippest thing to do.''
   It is also the smallest release, at 10,000 copies, an example of
the trade-off between artistic integrity and commercial success
that worries Stingray and others on both sides of the rapidly
parting Iron Curtain.
   Artemy Troitsky, a Moscow rock impresario, has warned that the
newfound respectability of Soviet groups is fraught with peril, not
only because the government could crack down at any time, but also
because bands may be tempted to sell out.
   ``We've waited a long time for this, and it's a great day,''
Troitsky wrote in ``Back in the USSR,'' a history of Soviet rock
published last fall. ``But previously, musicians exercised their
creativity under the slogan `We've Got Nothing To Lose,' and thus
didn't think much about altering their work to ... win official
prestige.
   ``Now, whether they recognize it consciously or not, the new
conditions push them toward compromise.''

   Congress offers a classic example of the
fickleness of politics this week as it considers a federal budget
worked out in advance with President Bush and a minimum wage
increase that sets lawmakers and the White House on a collision
course.
   The House and Senate will demonstrate how cooperative they can
be with the Bush administration when they consider the $1.17
trillion budget for fiscal 1990. Negotiators from the two chambers
completed work on a final version of the plan last Thursday, and
final passage of the spending plan is expected to be little more
than an exercise in rubber-stamping.
   The budget, for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, would hold
natural resources, transportation, agriculture and veterans
programs to growth rates below the rate of inflation. It would also
limit defense spending to $299.2 billion, $4.2 billion below what
would be needed to keep up with natural cost increases.
   But it would boost beyond inflation federal efforts for science,
education, and health programs. A looming dispute between Bush and
Democrats over how to collect $5.3 billion in additional tax
receipts has been postponed until later.
   Overall, the spending blueprint claims to compress the federal
deficit to $99.7 billion _ just within the $100 billion limit set
in the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.
   The harmony between the two branches was set in motion by a
deficit-reduction deal they reached last month. But when it comes
to their views on the minimum wage, Bush and the
Democratic-controlled Congress are anything but in harmony.
   Last Thursday, the House passed legislation that would increase
the $3.35-per-hour minimum wage to $4.55 by October 1991. The
Senate is poised to pass a similar measure this week, and Bush is
already threatening veto.
   The White House prefers a version that would limit the increase
to $4.25 by January 1992. Its version would also impose a
subminimum wage for six months, as opposed to the 60-day training
wage congressional Democrats prefer.
   Democrats seem unlikely to be able to muster the two-thirds
majorities in both houses that would be needed to override a veto.
But they are pressing the issue anyway in an attempt to position
themselves politically as the friend of the country's working class.
   More fireworks could come when Congress considers a domestic
spending bill with money for this year. Most of the money in it is
for veterans and for college loans, but the most controversial
provision would provide about $300 million this year for anti-drug
programs.
   Rep. Neal Smith, R-Iowa, chairman of the Appropriations justice
subcommittee, has said he wants to pay for the spending by using
part of the $650 million fine Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is
scheduled to pay for securities violations. Other lawmakers,
however, believe spending cuts must be made in other programs to
offset the drug spending.
   If the entire package contains too much new spending,
administration officials have said Bush might veto the measure. The
final size of the bill will not be known until early this week.
   The Senate also plans to vote on a resolution aimed at halting a
proposed deal between the United States and Japan to jointly
produce a new warplane.
   President Bush wants to move ahead with the $7 billion
arrangement, under which General Dynamics and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries would jointly produce the FSX fighter. The plane, a
modernized version of the American F-16, would be deployed by Japan
in the late 1990s.
   The question has sparked debate between supporters who stress
the importance of U.S.-Japanese cooperation, and opponents who say
the proposal would cost American jobs and constitute a giveaway of
U.S. technology.
   A similar disapproval resolution has been introduced in the
House. If the measures are passed and vetoed by Bush, it would take
a two-thirds vote in each chamber to block the deal.

   1. This document presents the principles of a political
initiative of the government of Israel which deals with the
continuation of the peace process, the termination of the state of
war with the Arab states, a solution for the Arabs of Judea,
Samaria, and Gaza Districts, peace with Jordan and a resolution of
the problem of the residents of the refugee camps of the Judea,
Samaria and Gaza Districts.
   2. The document includes:
   a. The principles on which the initiative is based.
   b. Details of the processes for its implementation.
   c. Reference to the subject of the elections under consideration.
   Further details relating to the elections as well as other
subjects of the initiative will be dealt with separately.
   Basic Premises:
   3. The initiative is founded upon the assumption that there is a
national consensus for it on the basis of the basic guidelines of
the government of Israel, including the following points:
   a. Israel yearns for peace and the continuation of the political
process by means of direct negotiations based on the principles of
the Camp David Accords.
   b. Israel opposes the establishment of an additional Palestinian
state in the Gaza District and the area between Israel and Jordan.
   c. Israel will not conduct negotiations with the PLO.
   d. There will be no change in the status of Judea, Samaria and
Gaza other than in accordance with the basic guidelines of the
government.
   Subjects to be Dealt with in the Peace Process:
   4. a. Israel views as important that the peace between Israel
and Egypt based on the Camp David Accords will serve as a
cornerstone for enlarging the circle of peace in the region, and
calls for a common endeavor for the strengthening of the peace and
its extension through continued consultations.
   b. Israel calls for the establishment of peace relations between
it and those Arab states which still maintain a state of war with
it for the purpose of promoting a comprehensive settlement for the
Arab-Israeli conflict, including recognition, direct negotiations,
ending the boycott, diplomatic relations, cessation of hostile
activity in international institutions or forums, and regional and
bilateral cooperation.
   c. Israel calls for an international endeavor to resolve the
problem of the residents of the Arab refugee camps in Judea,
Samaria and the Gaza District in order to improve their living
conditions and to rehabilitate them. Israel is prepared to be a
partner in this endeavor.
   d. In order to advance the political negotiation process leading
to peace, Israel proposes free and democratic elections among the
Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza
Districts in an atmosphere devoid of violence, threats and terror.
In these elections, a representation will be chosen to conduct
negotiations for a transitional period of self-rule. This period
will constitute a test for coexistence and cooperation. At a later
stage, negotiations will be conducted for a permanent solution
during which all the proposed options for an agreed settlement will
be examined and peace between Israel and Jordan will be achieved.
   e. All the above mentioned steps should be dealt with
simultaneously.
   f. The details of what have been mentioned in (section) d above
will be given below.
   Principles Constituting the Initiative:
   Stages:
   5. The initiative is based on two stages:
   a. Stage A: A transitional period for an interim agreement.
   b. Stage B: Permanent solution.
   6. The interlock between the stages is a timetable on which the
plan is built: The peace process delineated by the initiative is
based on (U.N. Security Council) Resolutions 242 and 338 upon which
the Camp David Accords are founded.
   Timetable:
   7. The transitional period will continue for five years.
   8. As soon as possible, but not later than the third year after
the beginning of the transitional period, negotiations for
achieving a permanent solution will begin.

   ``In the Upper Room'' a plotless ballet
choreographed by Twyla Tharp to music by Philip Glass, is an
exhilarating, athletic work that doesn't give its American Ballet
Theater dancers a moment to stop.
   The dancers at the Metropolitan Opera are forever twirling,
traveling all over the stage.
   Watching ``In the Upper Room,'' one can be reminded of a time
when male dancers lifted women, hands on their waists, and set them
down again.
   In Saturday night's company premiere of ``In the Upper Room,''
Miss Tharp has choreographed seven ways to Sunday to lift
ballerinas, including one in which the dancer rolls around the back
of her partner's neck and slides down his other side.
   One of the most interesting variations has three ballerinas put
their arms over each other's shoulders, facing the audience like a
chorus line. Their partners pick them up, their legs dangling,
without breaking the lineup.
   The dance has nine parts; tempos vary. One has to be familiar
with Glass' music to discern melodies, but two of the sections
sounded like his opera ``Akhnaten.''
   The stage seemed to be in a fog, which sometimes poured from the
wings and at other times was done by gray lighting by Jennifer
Tipton.
   At first, the dancers were dressed in light gray with accents of
red _ red shoes, red socks and red belts. As ``In the Upper Room''
progressed, costumes, designed by Norma Kamali, became all or
mostly red.
   Twyla Tharp is artistic associate of the American Ballet
Theater, having disbanded her Twyla Tharp Dance troupe.
   The evening began with ``Les Sylphides'' with elegant,
effortless-looking dancing by Andris Liepa, a guest artist from the
Bolshoi Ballet. His partners were Cheryl Yeager, Julie Kent and
Leslie Browne. The corps de ballet, dancing like a dream in
floating white chiffon, is prominent in this 1908 ballet
choreographed by Michel Fokine to Chopin music.
   George Balanchine's ``Prodigal Son,'' choreographed in 1929 from
the Bible story to Prokofiev music, had Danilo Radojevic dancing
the title role with power and naivete. Cynthia Gregory was
glitteringly cold as the siren who tempts him, then tosses him to
her minions to rob and beat.

   The Bush administration on Sunday welcomed the
visit to China by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a sign
of improving Sino-Soviet relations, and also applauded the
restraint Chinese authorities had shown in dealing with recent
student demonstrations.
   President Bush within the past few days sent a message to
Chinese leader Deng Xiaopeng saying ``we welcomed the fact that the
People's Republic and the Soviet Union were getting together,''
said Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``It's not something that the United States ought to be worried
about,'' Baker said on the CBS-TV interview program, ``Face the
Nation.''
   In the past, Bush administration officials have welcomed the
apparent Sino-Soviet rapprochement as a step toward lowering global
tension.
   Baker also applauded restraint that Chinese authorities had
shown in dealing with thousands of students demonstrating in the
heart of Beijing.
   ``We take note of the fact that the authorities in Beijing have
really not, as they quite frequently have in the past, have not
cracked down on these demonstrations. These students have been
permitted to express their views rather freely, if you look at what
has been traditional in the past,'' he said.
   Baker added that ``we support freedom of expression around the
world. We support self-determination, freedom of expression,
democratization.''

<HEAD>Former Klansman Charged In Slaying Of Black Teen Goes On Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Ku Klux Klansman goes on trial this
week as an accomplice in the beating and hanging death of a young
black man _ a crime that has already resulted in a death sentence
against another man and a multimillion damage verdict for the
victim's mother.
   Benjamin Franklin Cox, 27, is charged with murder in the March
21, 1981, death of Michael Donald, 19, who was was abducted at
random from a Mobile street as part of a Klan conspiracy. He faces
up to life in prison.
   The killing led to a $7 million civil lawsuit verdict in 1987
that bankrupted the nation's oldest Klan group, the United Klans of
America. Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, wound up acquiring the
Klan's headquarters in Tuscaloosa, the group's only major asset, in
partial payment. Mrs. Donald died last year.
   In 1983, Klan member Henry Francis Hays was convicted of capital
murder and sentenced to death in connection with the killing. And
ironically, a black civil rights group intervened on behalf of Hays.
   The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an offshoot of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, found
an Ohio lawyer willing to handle Hays' appeal. The group frequently
intervenes on behalf of indigent death row inmates.
   Cox faces the less serious charge of non-capital murder because
prosecutors have described him as an accomplice.
   Cox and Hays' father, Bennie Jack Hays, went on trial in
February 1988 on murder charges, but the elder Hays collapsed in
court, prompting a mistrial. This time, the two are being tried
separately, with Cox's trial scheduled to begin Monday.
   In the trial last year, the main prosecution witness was James
L. ``Tiger'' Knowles, who received a life prison sentence after he
pleaded guilty in 1983 to a federal charge of violating Donald's
civil rights.
   Knowles told how he and Henry Hays, 33, abducted Donald from a
downtown street and then beat him, bound him and put him in the
trunk of a car. Donald's body was found hanging in a tree in a
residential neighborhood in Mobile.
   Knowles testified that Cox provided a nylon rope used to hang
Donald. He also testified that the elder Hays ordered the killing
of a black as revenge for the mistrial of a black man who was
charged in the slaying of a white police officer in Birmingham.
   On Friday, a judge heard testimony at a hearing requested by
attorneys seeking to get Henry Francis Hays a new trial. His
attorney said he had new evidence that could warrant a new trial
and also that Hays was provided ineffective counsel at his first
trial.

   A former postmaster accused of shooting
his wife and three sons to death and then trying to make it look as
though the eldest son had done the killings was found guilty of
murder and sentenced to four consecutive life sentences.
   Clinton County Judge Carson V. Brown Jr. imposed the sentence
Saturday on Bernon D. Shank after jurors became deadlocked over
what sentence to give the former postmaster from Lamar, in nearby
Clinton County. Brown moved the trial here, because of pre-trial
publicity.
   ``I'm very relieved,'' said Shank, who could have received a
death penalty from the jury. ``I'm still in a fog, really. I
haven't had too much time to think about it.''
   Shank, 41, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the
shooting deaths last May of his wife, Charlaine, 37; and sons
Christopher, 16; Bernon Jr., 14, and Ryan, 3. Each was shot in the
head at the family trailer.
   Peter Campana, Shank's attorney, said he planned to appeal the
verdict.
   The jurors deliberated about 4{ hours before sending a note to
Brown that they were deadlocked on the sentence.
   Brown was required by law to give Shank life sentences for each
first-degree murder. A life sentence in Pennsylvania has no parole.
   The jury found Shank guilty Friday after 27 hours of
deliberation over four days.
   Clinton County District Attorney Ted McKnight contended that
Shank wanted to start a new life with a family friend with whom he
had become romantically involved.
   He said Shank tried to frame his son Christopher by planting the
murder weapon and a ``suicide note'' next to the teen-ager's body.
   Shank steadfastly denied his guilt during three days on the
witness stand. He testified that Christopher had killed three
family members and then himself.

<TEXT>
   The new executive director of the John
Birch Society insists that his conservative group's relocation to
the birthplace of the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy is nothing but a
``happy coincidence.''
   Community leaders, who have long dissociated themselves from
McCarthy's reckless anti-communism, agree that it's a coincidence,
although not one that makes everyone happy.
   ``It was more of an accident that Joe McCarthy was born here and
it's more of an accident that the John Birch Society is moving
here,'' said Michael O'Brien, a University of Wisconsin professor
who has written a book on the activities that led to McCarthy's
censure by the Senate in 1954.
   The Birch Society, a conservative political organization that
emphasizes anti-communism and reducing the size of U.S. government,
announced in March that it was closing its headquarters in Belmont,
Mass., and San Marino, Calif., and moving them to Appleton, a city
of 65,000 on the banks of the Fox River in east-central Wisconsin.
Employees are due to begin moving in this week.
   Since the announcement, city officials have repeatedly denied
that the arrival of the society will affect the city's image.
   ``I don't think anyone is frightened and certainly no one is
alarmed,'' Mayor Dorothy Johnson said. ``I don't think anyone will
be much affected by the coming of the John Birch Society. It's
fairly esoteric. We have people of all persuasions.''
   McCarthy, who was born in nearby Grand Chute, is not the only
Appleton-area native who has gained the town some notoriety. In
addition to the annual memorial at McCarthy's grave in St. Mary's
Cemetery, there is a seance each Halloween for the late magician
and escape artist Harry Houdini, who was born and raised here.
   But those events, city officials say, are oddities in what is
otherwise a typical Midwest community, a Republican stronghold,
that is gradually shedding its rural roots for a more urban
economy. Johnson, who has been mayor since 1980, calls it ``the
best of Middle America.''
   G. Allen Bubolz, 52, who stepped down as an executive at Secura
Insurance in Appleton to become executive director of the Birch
Society, said the group chose Appleton as its new headquarters
because he lives there, not because of the city's ties to
conservatism or McCarthy's legacy.
   However, he said, the fact that McCarthy was born there is a
``happy irony.''
   ``We're quite pleased because Sen. Joe McCarthy was a great
American, a stalwart of patriotism, a warrior of the evils of
communism. It's a happy coincidence,'' he said.
   The society was founded in 1958 by 11 men, including William J.
Grede, founder of Grede Foundries in Milwaukee, and Robert Welch, a
retired candy company executive. It was named after John M. Birch,
a Baptist missionary and U.S. Army captain who was killed by
Chinese communists a few days after World War II ended.
   The organization now claims ``several tens of thousands'' of
members who meet in local chapters around the nation, Bubolz said.
   He said the organization's militant anti-communism has given way
to a less aggressive style, although he stressed that the society's
underlying philosophy hasn't changed.
   Outagamie County Supervisor Ronald VanderVelden, who led a
futile fight to remove a life-size bust of McCarthy from the
courthouse in Appleton three years ago, said he's worried that the
Birch Society leaders might try ``integrating their philosophies
into state and local government.''
   But William J. Welch, president of the Fox Cities Chamber of
Commerce (and no relation to the Birch Society founder), dismissed
such worries.
   ``The last time I checked, the John Birch Society wasn't
advocating the violent overthrow of the United States government,''
Welch said. ``And quite frankly, if they have any problem it is
that people don't take them quite that seriously.''

<BYLINE>Federal Authorities To Open Hearings On Oil Disaster</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When federal investigators open
hearings this week into the nation's largest oil spill, they will
be looking for answers to fundamental questions that so far have
stymied authorities.
   Coast Guard personnel, Exxon executives and crew members from
the tanker Exxon Valdez all face scrutiny as the National
Transportation Safety Board, in five days of hearings beginning
Tuesday, tries to solve these mysteries:
   _Why did the 987-foot tanker stray far from estabished shipping
lanes and rip its single-sheath bottom open on Bligh Reef, a
well-charted obstacle about 25 miles from Valdez?
   _Was the captain, Joseph Hazelwood, 42, of Huntington, N.Y.,
intoxicated at the time of the crash?
   _How long was the vessel stranded before the crew reported the
accident to the Coast Guard?
   _Did the crew's frenzied attempts to free the ship by
``rocking'' it off the reef widen the gash in the hull, spilling
still more oil into the icy water?
   _Did the Coast Guard, the oil industry, Exxon and state
officials react promptly to the emergency?
   The board's final report won't be completed for nine to 12
months, board spokeswoman Drucella Anderson said. ``We hope to
determine the probable cause and make some safety
recommendations,'' she said.
   Although the focus of attention shifts from Valdez to the
hearings in Anchorage this week, the hard work continued Sunday in
Prince William Sound where the accident took place and where crews
are still trying to clean fouled beaches.
   The Coast Guard continued its reconnaissance flights over the
spill. The flights were ordered to help halibut fishermen avoid
polluted areas on Monday, when their 24-hour commercial season
opens.
   ``Oil sightings will be relayed to fishermen by radio,'' Coast
Guard spokesman Dennis Hubbard said Sunday. ``Whatever we've got,
we're using. C-130s, helicopters, whatever.''
   It has been nearly two months since the catastrophe changed life
in what had been a quiet fishing village.
   The trouble began shortly after midnight on March 24, when the
Exxon Valdez, its 13 tanks filled with North Slope crude from the
trans-Alaska pipeline, slammed into a reef shrouded in darkness.
   The crippled vessel quickly began hemorrhaging oil _ by latest
estimate, 10.9 million gallons _ into the pristine waters of Prince
William Sound.
   The sound, named after the third son of England's King George
III, is one of Alaska's most popular and scenic recreational areas,
teeming with animals, fish and birds.
   The huge vessel, apparently maneuvering to avoid the glittering
ice chunks cast into the sound by Columbia Glacier, swerved from
its outbound lane and across the incoming zone, then continued
miles off course toward the submerged, jagged outcropping.
   Minutes before the crash the crew, apparently aware that their
vessel was at risk, frantically tried to avoid the reef, according
to an analysis of radio traffic between the Exxon Valdez and the
Coast Guard.
   Then, in the words of helmsman Robert Kagan, the Exxon Valdez
went for ``a bumpy ride.''
   As its massive hull scraped along the reef, it scooped up
boulders the size of automobiles and stuffed them into its huge oil
tanks.
   ``We've fetched hard aground. ... We're leaking oil. We're going
to be here a while. I just wanted to make a report,'' Hazelwood
radioed shortly after 12:20 a.m. As he spoke, the crude gushed into
the water.
   In the more than seven weeks since the crash, oil has spread
some 450 miles southwest of Valdez, fouling shorelines throughout
Prince William Sound and along the Alaska coast to Wide Bay, near
Kodiak Island. The oiled beaches include those of the spectacular
Katmai National Park.
   To probe the accident, the transportation board has assembled
what it describes as a panel of inquiry _ one board member to
conduct the proceedings, staff members and investigators to sift
the evidence and representatives of each ofthe four parties having
a direct interest in the proceedings.
   Those are the state of Alaska, Exxon, the Coast Guard and
Alyeska, the oil industry's jointly owned company that operates the
800-mile-long trans-Alaska pipeline.
   The chairman for the hearings is Lee Dickenson, the only member
of the board who will be present in Anchorage. Later, in
Washington, D.C., the full board will consider the evidence
developed from the Anchorage testimony.
   Unlike a court of law, the NTSB's rules specifically bar lawyers
from posing questions. Instead, representatives of each of the four
parties at interest directly question the witnesses, as does
Dickenson.
   Crew members from the Exxon Valdez are scheduled to testify
first, followed by Coast Guard personnel, representatives of Exxon
and Alyeska, and winding up on the final day with more Coast Guard
officials.
   One person who won't be at the hearings is Hazelwood, who
declined to testify but who offered information in writing to the
board. Hazelwood has been charged in an Alaska court with three
misdemeanor counts that include operating a vessel while drunk, and
his trial is scheduled to begin June 20 in Valdez.

   First lady Barbara Bush urged graduates
of tiny Bennett College on Sunday to heed the example set by 19th
century black activist Frederick Douglass and help people
``enslaved by ignorance'' to become educated members of society.
   ``Someday in your lives, the walls will part and you'll see a
little Frederick Douglass,'' Mrs. Bush said in a commencement
address at the predominantly black, liberal arts college for women.
   ``I hope that you will remember the abiding principles and
values that we learned when we were young and I hope you will say,
`I want to be fair and I want to share.' It can be done and I want
to help you do it.''
   Mrs. Bush was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters by
the college, which was founded in 1873. In her speech, said
Douglass had been one of her heroes since she read the
autobiography of the one-time slave who became a scholar and writer.
   She said she was particularly struck by Douglass' account of
overhearing his owner admonishing his wife not to teach slaves how
to read because doing so would make them impossible to control.
   ``Frederick Douglass' revelation holds true today,'' Mrs. Bush
said. ``There are many types of slavery, and education is the key
to freedom.''
   The first lady, who is active in literacy programs and is
honorary chairperson of the National Advisory Council of Literacy
Volunteers of America, challenged the 92 graduates to ``help the
young, modern Frederick Douglasses out there today who are enslaved
by ignorance. Help them learn their A-B-C's and escape,'' she said.
   The ceremony was held beneath overcast skies on the school's
grassy quadrangle, lined with oak trees.
   Mrs. Bush walked at the rear of the procession, wearing a black
academic gown and cap and a triple trand of pearls. As she
approached the dais, a child handed her a dozen red roses.
   Mrs. Bush, the mother of five and grandmother of 11, said her
honorary doctorate was ``a wonderful Mother's Day present for me.''
Her speech was laced with jokes about children, but she said the
basic lessons learned in early childhood form the basis of adult
character.
   She also challenged the graduates to follow the example of
Dorothy Brown, who despite being an orphan, graduated from Bennett
College in 1941 and went on to become a surgeon and Tennessee
legislator. She quoted Mrs. Brown as having said, ``I haven't
accepted defeat, not my entire life.''
   The speech was the only commencement address Mrs. Bush will
deliver this year, according to press secretary Anna Perez. The
first lady chose to accept Bennett's invitation because she met the
college's president, Gloria R. Scott, in a White House Rose Garden
ceremony earlier this year.

   Floodwaters began to recede slowly Sunday
after Maine's swollen rivers gave residents in low-lying areas a
scare without causing major damage.
   While spectators lined riverbanks to gawk and take pictures of
the high water, meteorologists continued to keep a close watch on
levels of the rain-filled waterways, said George Wiseman of the
National Weather Service.
   Several families living along the Androscoggin River in Auburn
and Lewiston had been asked to evacuate their homes as water filled
basements and forced the shutoff of electric utilities on Saturday.
   On Sunday, police said they had no reports of evacuations having
taken place.
   ``It's nothing major at all,'' said Lewiston Police Officer John
Moyer. ``It's not nearly what it was back in '87,'' when floods
caused tens of millions of dollars in damage across Maine.
   This weekend, spectators casually watched the Androscoggin's
waters rush over Great Falls and cascade onto rocks below in
Lewiston's downtown section.
   Rising waters flooded several roads in central and southern
Maine, but none was reported blocked as of Sunday. In Minot, Road
Commissioner James Bryant said damage was worse than during the
April 1987 flood. Sections of some roads were washed away in Hebron.
   In Hallowell, the Kennebec rose to the doors of some businesses
on Saturday. But by Sunday afternoon, the river had backed away.
   ``It has since receded and we're damn glad it did,'' said Willie
Bridges, owner of the Speakeasy Restaurant and Pub in Hallowell.
``We're happy we've seen the worst of it.''

   A bus crowded with vacationers from
neighboring Nicaragua lost its brakes, rolled off the road and
crashed into a hillside Sunday, killing at least two people and
injuring 71, authorities said.
   All victims were believed to be Nicaraguan.
   The crash occurred early Sunday near Taulabe, 74 miles northwest
of Tegucigalpa, said Lt. Ernesto Ruiz of the Honduran fire
department.
   He said 73 people were on board the bus.
   The injured were rushed to hospitals in the nearby towns of
Siguatepeque, Comayagua and the Enrique Soto Cano air force base,
where a contingent of U.S. troops is stationed. Some of the
critically injured were taken in U.S. Army helicopters to the
capital, Ruiz said.
   It took rescue workers nearly two hours to pull the injured from
the wreckage, he said.

   A light plane crashed while attempting to

five people on board, the government news agency Notimex said.
   The Cessna plane was en route from Reynosa, across the border
from McAllen, Texas, when it crashed on a runway Saturday
afternoon, the agency said.
   Investigators speculated a rudder problem may have caused the
accident.
   Police said two of the victims and one survivor were Mexicans.
The other two victims were still unidentified but believed to be
Mexican.
   The survivor was hospitalized in serious condition, Notimex said.

<HEAD>At Shrine, Mother's Day Draws 200 Visitors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAFTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oldest mother who's a regular at the
International Mother's Day Shrine is easy to shop for this time of
year.
   ``Usually they send flowers, but I told them if I couldn't eat
it or wear it, don't send it,'' said Carrie Marshall, who at 98 was
the oldest mother attending Sunday's services at the church where
Mother's Day began in 1908.
   Mrs. Marshall's 71-year-old son, Charles Jr., is a member of the
Grafton Mother's Day committee.
   The committee's roots go back 81 years, to the time when Anna
Jarvis of Grafton wanted to set aside a day to honor her mother,
also named Anna Jarvis, who had organized a Mothers Friendship Day
after the Civil War to unite families who had split because of the
conflict.
   When Mrs. Jarvis died on May 9, 1905, Anna became determined to
establish Mother's Day.
   On May 10, 1908, the first Mother's Day service was held in
Andrews Methodist Church, which has since become the International
Mother's Day Shrine and is used only for Mother's Day services and
an occasional wedding.
   This year, the Sunday services attracted about 200 visitors, not
quite enough to fill up the church, said Betty Hayhurst, the
director of the shrine for six years.
   This year marks the 75th anniversary of federal recognition for
Mother's Day. And if the holiday seems overly commercialized today,
it's interesting to note that its founder was concerned about that
decades ago.
   Like Mrs. Marshall, the younger Anna Jarvis didn't want to see
flowers deliverered on Mother's Day.
   ``They're commercializing my Mother's Day,'' she once wrote to
newspapers. ``I wanted it to be a day of sentiment, not of profit.
   ``Flowers are about half-dead by the time they're delivered. You
ought to give your mother something useful, something permanent.
   ``A maudlin and insincere printed card or a ready-made telegram
means nothing except that you're too lazy to write to the woman who
has done more for you than anyone else in the world.''

   Army Spec. 4 Peter Lucas and his
buddies got a hot and humid welcome to Panama as they began to
settle into their posts Sunday near the Panama Canal.
   ``It's only 8 a.m. and it already feels like the hottest day of
the year in Minnesota,'' said the Duluth man as he ate breakfast
near a row of 10 armored personnel carriers.
   ``You guys ever have any breeze here?'' he asked.
   It was only 85 degrees, but Lucas and 150 men from the 5th
Infantry Division were camped in a steamy, windless jungle clearing.
   They are among the nearly 1,900 fresh troops dispatched by
President Bush to assure the security of the Panama Canal, U.S.
installations and American citizens.
   They arrived Saturday from Fort Polk, La., and Sunday morning
they were oiling and cleaning equipment following an intense
tropical downpour during the night.
   Lucas, who said he was a history student, said he was familiar
with Panama.
   ``I know that for once, we are here to support democracy. It
didn't use to be that way in the past. I know Panama was part of
Colombia and we supported the separatist movement and that's how we
made a deal about building the canal,'' he said.
   ``It's hot and humid,'' said Pfc. Craig Schoenfelder, 21, of
Pittsburgh. ``What other kind of weather you have?''
   Hot and dry, he was told. ``Can't wait 'til noon,'' he said.
   Spec. 4 Jorge Montes of Houston, a medic, said, ``We are here to
support Americans citizens and property and help other military
units.''
   Pfc. Larry Duckles of Stillwater, N.J., a grenadier, and Pfc.
Scott Deninski, of Alfred, N.Y., a machine gunner, were cleaning
their weapons.
   ``We are just doing our job protecting Americans,'' Duckles said.
   Pfc. Michael Grant of Chicago sat on the wet ground cleaning his
weapon and looked up to say, ``This place is nice from what I've
seen. I talked to some Panamanians last night and I doubt they'll
have to use us. They seemed friendly. They said, `glad you're
here.'''
   Grant said he knew about the problems between Panama and the
United States.
   ``We are a peacekeeping force. But I don't think they will have
to use us,'' he repeated.
   ``It boils down to the fact that we have a job to do and we are
here to do it,'' said Ricky Zimmerman of Hoboken, N.J., a division
cameraman. ``This looks like a beautiful country, but coming out of
the tent this morning felt like getting hit with a wet towel.''
   The ``tent'' was a 100-foot, inflatable, air-conditioned dome
where all 150 soldiers slept in cots Saturday night.
   ``It's nice in there,'' smiled Lucas. ``This is a volunteer
army. They have to be nicer to us.''

<HEAD>Police Condemn `Weekend of Shame;' 255 Soccer Fans Arrested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police and lawmakers on Sunday condemned a wave of
fan violence that broke out on the last full day of the English
soccer season. Authorities arrested 255 fans during and after the
matches.
   The incidents Saturday and early Sunday came less than a month
after 95 fans died during an April 15 stampede at a soccer game at
Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield.
   ``What happened last night has brought the game back to its
knees,'' charged David Evans, a Conservative member of Parliament
and chairman of the Luton Town club.
   Fellow Conservative parliamentarian John Carlisle called the
violence a ``weekend of shame that reinforces the government's
determination to clean up soccer and rid the country forever of the
scourge of the football hooligan.''
   On Saturday, fans poured onto the field and briefly stopped the
Crystal Palace-Birmingham City match. Twenty-four fans were
arrested on charges that included drunkenness, threatening, assault
and drug possession. Sixteen people were hospitalized and two were
kept overnight, one suffering from knife wounds, police said.
   Later Saturday, 42 Birmingham fans were arrested after they
smashed dishes and furniture at a roadside diner in Toddington,
police said.
   ``The youths started charging about ... throwing people and
furniture about,'' said a Bedfordshire police spokesman on
condition of anonymity.
   About 200 youths _ mainly Sheffield United supporters _ went on
the rampage in Weston-super-Mare after seeing their team beaten 2-0
at Bristol City. Police said 27 people were arrested for fighting
and breaking windows.
   Elsewhere, 44 Leeds United supporters were arrested after a bar
fight after a match in Shrewsbury. A 25-year-old Leeds man was
hospitalized with serious head injuries, police said.
   At Portsmouth, 57 Chelsea fans were arrested after trouble
around the Fratton Park stadium, and 11 Plymouth supporters were
arrested for disorderly conduct on a train headed for a match at
Bournemouth.
   Police on Sunday arrested 50 passengers aboard a bus chartered
by Bristol Rovers fans. Authorities said about 30 of the drunken
fans had gone to a party in Tewkesbury on their way home from a
match and had injured two guests.
   Police in Birmingham said the behavior of the town's fans at
Crystal Palace in south London suggested they had short memories.
   ``One wonders, in the light of (the) Hillsborough (stampede),
what on earth these mindless idiots were thinking of,'' said deputy
chief constable Paul Leopold.

<HEAD>Cult Leader's Charisma and Clairvoyance Attracted Stars, Wealthy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo used his good looks and
claims of clairvoyance to charm Mexico's elite and attract drug
traffickers and cultists willing to do anything for their
``godfather,'' a newspaper reported.
   Constanzo, who ordered his own execution and that of companion
Martin Quintana Rodriguez as police closed in May 6 on his Mexico
City residence, has been linked to as many as 24 slayings _ 15 that
were discovered last month outside Matamoros, Mexico, and many that
included ritualistic sacrifices.
   Those who knew him said Constanzo built a career as a reader to
the stars, The Dallas Morning News reported in Sunday's editions.
   His clients included top-ranking police and government officials
and popular entertainers, according to statements last week by his
family, followers and authorities. Some clients paid as much as
$8,000 a session for his predictions and ritual ``cleansings'' that
promised good luck, family members told the newspaper.
   ``He would tell rich people what to do, how to make things
better, and since what he would say would happen, they would pay
him $30,000 or $40,000,'' said Constanzo's brother, Fausto
Rodriguez, 21, of Miami.
   Authorities depict Constanzo, 26, as a bisexual who had affairs
with several members of his cult and wore rubies, sapphires and
diamonds on every finger, drove a 1989 Mercedes-Benz and twice
bought a boyfriend $10,000 worth of clothes in Brownsville, Texas.
   Constanzo's mother, Delia Gonzalez Del Valle of Miami, described
her son as a homebody who kept a neat house, cared about his family
and had few close friends as a youngster. But, she said, Constanzo
had striking good looks, charisma and what appeared to his admirers
to be an ever-increasing clairvoyance.
   ``People were always asking, `Who's that?' _ everybody believing
he was somebody and asking if he's a movie star,'' Mrs. Gonzalez
told The Morning News. ``He had cachet.''
   And, she said, ``he knew things.''
   A high school dropout, Constanzo predicted former President
Reagan would be shot in 1980, but would survive, Mrs. Gonzalez
said. He predicted a great tragedy was coming to Mexico just months
before the Mexico City earthquake of 1985.
   The son of teen-age Cuban immigrants, Constanzo was born in
Miami but moved to Puerto Rico as an infant with his mother after
his parents divorced. The family returned to Florida when he was 10
to seek medical care for his stepfather, who died of cancer in 1973.
   At 14, Constanzo fathered a child by his 13-year-old girlfriend
and dropped out of high school. He also began claiming to have
out-of-body experiences, healing the sick and predicting the
future, the paper reported.
   He did odd jobs until he landed a modeling job in Mexico City in
1984. There he fathered another child and began attracting clients
for his readings _ including such celebrities, cult members say, as
pop singer Oscar Athie, actress Irma Serrana and renowned
hairstylist Alfredo Palacios. All of them have denied any link to
the cult.
   Athie said Constanzo's followers harassed him for more than a
year because he rejected their requests to perform in concert and
pay for a ritual cleansing.
   ``They said that they were witches and that Constanzo had
powers, and for $2,000 or $3,000 I could be cleansed for good
luck,'' Athie told the newspaper. When he refused, Athie said
``they became angry and called back to say that I was going to die
slowly of a serious illness.''
   Authorities believe Constanzo performed several human sacrifices
_ including as many as nine in the Mexico City area _ in addition
to revenge killings.
   Cult member Alvaro de Leon Valdez said members would stand
around an altar, sometimes blindfolded, while Constanzo killed his
victim. Constanzo would allow members to dismember the corpse.
   Members of the Hernandez drug-smuggling family told police
Constanzo offered them protection from their enemies _ police,
rival drug gangs and feuding family members _ in return for 50
percent of the profits.

<TEXT>
   The first exhibit to bring together
works by contemporary Soviet and American artists opened to eager
viewers Sunday at the Modern Art Museum.
   The exhibition, called 10 Plus 10, includes 60 paintings by 20
artists _ 10 from the Soviet Union and 10 from the United States.
It will be the first such exhibit to tour both nations.
   Chief curator Marla Price said more than 200 visitors came
through the doors in the first hour of the exhibit's debut.
   Modern Art Museum Director E.A. Carmean said the show is the
first chance the Soviets have had to help organize and take part in
touring shows.
   ``They want to participate,'' Carmean said. ``They want to
change the rules about exhibition touring. And we got there just
when they decided they wanted to change them.''
   In November 1985, when President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev signed an agreement to further cultural
exchanges, work was already under way in Fort Worth for such an
exhibition.
   Dee Smith, president of InterCultura, a Fort Worth-based museum
services group, had been talking to State Department officials
about the possibility of U.S.-Soviet cultural exchanges.
   In June 1987, Smith met with Genrikh Popov, chief of the Soviet
Department of Fine Arts, and returned with several ideas for an
exhibition, including a show of contemporary art.
   The exhibition came together over cookies and tea when Carmean
and Smith met Popov in February 1988.
   ``10 Plus 10 epitomizes cultural dialogue more clearly than any
other exhibition we've done,'' Smith said. ``The exhibition is a
direct dialogue between two completely different cultures that are
meeting each other for the first time.''
   A $150,000 grant from the Dallas-based Meadows Foundation helped
underwrite 10 Plus 10.
   The exhibit includes works by David Bates of Dallas and
Christopher Brown of Oakland, Calif., as well as Ross Bleckner,
April Gornick, Peter Halley, Annette Lemieux, Rebecca Purdum, David
Salle, Donald Sultan and Mark Tansey, all of New York.
   Soviet exhibitors are Yurii Albert, Vladimir Mironenko, Yurii
Petruk, Leonid Purygin, Andrei Roiter, Sergei Shutov, Alexsei
Sundukov, Vadim Zakharov, Anatolii Zhuravlev and Konstantin
Zvezdochetov.
   After 10 Plus 10 closes in Fort Worth on Aug. 6, it will travel
to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Albright-Knox Art
Gallery in Buffalo, N.Y., the Milwaukee Art Museum and the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.
   Then 10 Plus 10 will be exhibited in the Artist's Union Hall of
the Tretyakov Embankment in Moscow, the State Picture Gallery of
Georgia in Tbilisi and the Central Exhibition Hall in Leningrad.

   A Palestinian man shot at a police jeep in
northern Israel Sunday, wounding two Israeli officers before being
shot and wounded himself, hospital officials and Israel radio
reported.
   In the occupied lands, two Palestinians accused of collaborating
with Israel were reported killed by fellow Palestinians.
   Also Sunday, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least 21
Arabs, mostly teen-agers, in stone-throwing clashes, and a
10-year-old boy was injured by a rubber bullet, Arab hospital
reports said.
   An assailant opened fire with a pistol on the police vehicle
near Hefzi Bah, a settlement 50 miles northest of Jerusalem, Israel
radio and hospital officials said. They said the vehicle was
carrying a bomb expert and a Civil Guard volunteer.
   The Palestinian, identified as being from the West Bank village
of Araba, jumped from roadside bushes and ``emptied the whole
magazine, standing there like a Rambo,'' the radio quoted one
officer as saying.
   The bomb expert drew his pistol and fired, wounding the attacker
in the stomach and head, the radio reported.
   ``This man lost a lot of blood from the head .... His condition
is hopeless,'' said Yossi Fahima, an emergency service medic. He
said the two officers suffered only minor arm wounds.
   A West Bank man, Hassan Awdeh, 60, died of stab wounds received
Saturday in the West Bank village of Kfar Salit, according to Arab
reports confirmed by the army. Awdeh was attacked by masked youths
who accused him of collaborating with Israeli authorities, the
reports said.
   In the Gaza Strip, Ahmed Ibrahim Fakawi, 22, was found dead near
Khan-Yunis. Fakawi died of stab wounds, and Israel radio said he
was suspected of being an army collaborator.
   More than 40 Palestinians have been killed as collaborators by
fellow Arabs.
   The latest deaths bring the number of Palestinians killed in the
17-month uprising against the Israeli occupation to 474. Twenty-one
Israelis have also been killed.
   In other violence, stone-throwing clashes erupted in seven Gaza
Strip refugee camps and towns, and Arab hospitals reported 18
wounded, mostly teen-agers. A 10-year-old was hit in the cheek by a
rubber bullet, they said.
   In the West Bank, three teen-agers were shot in clashes in
Nablus and the Balata refugee camps, doctors said. The army said it
was checking the reports.
   In southern Israel, Jews enraged over the death of a soldier
blamed on Palestinians stoned Arabs' vehicles, injuring one of the
drivers and damaging nine cars, witnesses said.
   The Jews mounted their attacks along a road from the Gaza Strip
to retaliate for the death of Avi Sassportaz, whose body was found
last week.

<HEAD>Actress Who Co-Starred With Buster Keaton Dies</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Marion is cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Silent film actress Marion Mack, a
small-town girl who went on to become a Mack Sennett bathing beauty
and Buster Keaton's co-star in the classic ``The General,'' has
died. She was 87.
   Miss Mack died May 1 of heart failure after a lingering heart
condition. She was buried Saturday in a private service.
   Miss Mack, whose real name was Joey Marion McCreery, was born in
Mammoth, Utah, and came to Hollywood in April 1920.
   ``I went to Mack Sennett's studio and they gave me a job right
away at $25 a week,'' she told the Los Angeles Times in a 1987
interview.
   As a bathing beauty, she appeared in a number of short films,
then went on to make comedies and features for other studios before
writing and starring in a semi-autobiographical film, ``Mary of the
Movies.'' She eventually adopted the screen name Marion Mack.
   Her best-known role was in Keaton's 1926 Civil War comedy, ``The
General,'' in which she played his estranged girlfriend, Annabelle
Lee, who is accidentally kidnapped by Yankee spies.
   She later abandoned acting to write scripts for her husband,
producer Louis Lewyn. In 1949, she entered the real estate business
and moved to Orange County, settling that year in Costa Mesa. Lewyn
died in 1969.
   ``The General'' was a critical and financial failure at the time
of its release but is now considered Keaton's masterpiece. When
interest in the film revived in the 1970s, Miss Mack was tracked
down by a film historian and made the rounds of film festival
screenings until illness forced her to quit.
   ``I enjoyed going back to traveling with the movie and being an
actress again,'' she said.
   Miss Mack is survived by her son, a stepsister and three
grandchildren.

<HEAD>No. 3 House Democrat Amends Report on Junk Bond Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Tony Coelho acknowledged Sunday that a
California savings and loan executive set him up in a junk bond
investment that netted the congressman a $6,882 profit without him
having to put up any of his own money.
   Coelho released a detailed report of the arrangement, in which
the S&amp;L executive purchased the $100,000 in bonds for Coelho and
held them until Coelho could raise money to pay for them, in part
with a loan subsequently obtained from the executive's S&amp;L.
   Except for some reporting errors, Coelho said, the 1986 deal was
``totally above board.''
   The California congressman _ as majority whip the No. 3 Democrat
in the House _ released his attorney's review of the financial
transaction. The review was begun after The Washington Post last
month first reported on Coelho's investment in the high yield bonds.
   According to the report, Coelho first considered investing his
1986 campaign funds in 12{ percent bonds, based on a suggestion by
Thomas Spiegel, chief executive officer of the Columbia Savings and
Loan Assn. of Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Although Coelho ruled out that type purchase for his campaign,
Spiegel suggested that Coelho himself could make an investment in
the bonds, which were being issued for a corporate takeover.
   When Coelho could not come up with the $100,000 by the required
purchase date of May 5, Spiegel bought the bonds himself and held
them for a month while Coelho completed his financing _ half of
which came from Spiegel's bank.
   At that point, Coelho bought the bonds from Spiegel and paid him
interest equivalent to what the bonds made during that period. When
the congressman sold the bonds in October, 1986, he was able to pay
back his loans and realize a $6,882 profit in four months.
   Coelho's lawyer, Robert F. Bauer, concluded that Spiegel's role
could not be construed as a ``gift'' which would violate House
rules, since Coelho paid him interest. He also said the original
issuing of the bond to Coelho's campaign committee, instead of the
congressman, was a clerical error.
   Coelho spokesman David Dreyer said the report was given Friday
to the House ethics committee, which routinely reviews House
financial reporting compliance. He said the amended financial
disclosure was to be filed Monday.
   There is no indication whether the ethics committee is
considering or plans to review the bond purchase.
   Coelho insisted in his statement that the deal was proper but
said he regretted it.
   ``The report shows that although my purchase of the bonds was
lawful, appropriately financed and that no questions about `gifts'
can be fairly raised, my 1986 financial disclosure form was
incomplete and contained some reporting errors,'' Coelho said.
   ``I am accepting without reservations the conclusion of my legal
counsel that the purchase of the bonds was totally above board,''
he said.
   ``Public officials are today, however, living in a period of
intense questioning. ... With the benefit of hindsight, I now
regret having made this transaction.''
   Coelho, who has ambitions of climbing higher in the House
leadership, last year put all of his holdings into a blind trust.
``My greatest regret is not having gotten into the blind trust
sooner,'' he said Sunday.
   Dreyer said the congressman's staff had spent a month ``to
understand fully and reconstruct this transaction'' instead of
releasing details piecemeal. He said the effort did not include
checking whether Spiegel had any interest in legislation, because
that is only an issue if Spiegel had conferred a gift.
   ``We don't think it's going to end up as a big deal,'' he said
of the transaction.

   Michael D. Eisner, the head of Walt Disney
Productions, doesn't get Mickey Mouse pay. He received more than
$40 million in compensation last year, making him by far America's
best paid chief executive officer, says Forbes magazine.
   The Los Angeles executive took top honors in the cover story in
Forbes' upcoming May 29 issue on the nation's 800 best paid CEOs,
rising from No. 14 in last year's survey.
   Forbes considered such things as stock option plans in addition
to salaries and bonuses in putting together its list.
   Eisner received $7,506,000 in salary and bonuses plus
$32,588,000 in stock gains in 1988 for a total of $40.1 million.
   ``He's been able to build a company that can do incredible
creative work, and he is equally good with implementation,'' said
Apple Computer CEO John Sculley, who came in ninth with about $9.49
million in compensation.
   Far back in second place was Steven J. Ross of Warner
Communications Inc., who had about $14.16 million and was in 48th
place last year. Richard L. Gelb of Bristol-Myers Co. was third at
about $14.14 million, rocketing up from 165th place.
   Rounding out the top 10 were: William P. Stiritz of Ralston
Purina Co. ($13 million), Paul B. Fireman of Reebok International
Ltd. ($11.44 million), James D. Robinson III of American Express
Co. ($11.24 million), Donald E. Petersen of Ford Motor Co. ($10.49
million), Kenneth H. Olsen of Digital Equipment Corp. ($9.98
million), Sculley and Michael W.J. Smurfit of Jefferson Smurfit
($9.25 million).

<HEAD>Syria Welcomes Egypt Back to Arab Fold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria on Sunday welcomed Egypt's return
to the Arab fold, saying Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
expected participation at an Arab League summit in Morocco was a
positive development.
   Presidential spokesman Jibran Kourieh issued a statment saying
``Syria supports and approves the return of Egypt to its natural
place in the struggle'' against Israel.
   Egypt was isolated from the 22-member Arab League and most Arab
nations severed relations with Egypt after it signed the Camp David
peace accords with Israel in 1979.
   But in the past two years all but three of the countries,
hardline Syria and Libya and war-divided Lebanon, restored ties.
   Syrian Oil Minister Mutanius Habib said last week Syria did not
object to Egypt's return to Arab organizations. He spoke during a
meeting in Kuwait of the Organization of Arab Oil Exporting
Countries in Kuwait. Egypt was readmitted to that organization on
Saturday.
   Kourieh's statement did no specifically mention the Arab League
but made clear Syria would no longer oppose Egypt's participation.
   He said Syrian President Hafez Assad and Mubarak were ``old
friends,'' and Assad ``is aware that President Mubarak is not Anwar
Sadat.'' President Sadat signed the Camp David pact, making Egypt
the first Arab country to agree to peace with Israel. He also made
a historic journey to Jerusalem.
   Mubarak became president after Sadat was assassinated by Moslem
fundamentalist extremists in October 1981.
   ``Syria asserts that the presence of President Mubarak at the
summit is a positive development,'' Kourieh said.
   An Arab League summit is scheduled for May 23-24 in Casablanca,
Morocco.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has said he would not attend
the summit if Egypt is invited.

<HEAD>Radiation Fear Forces Closing Of Summer Camp Near Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 67-year-old children's summer camp located
two miles from a uranium processing plant closed Sunday because of
concerns over radiation poisoning.
   The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati, which owns Fort
Scott Camp, announced last month it would permanently close the
retreat near the federal government's Fernald uranium plant.
   Residents of the area surrounding the camp have filed a $300
million class-action lawsuit against the former operators of the
plant, contending they allowed radioactive dust to contaminate
local land, water and air for three decades.
   The Energy Department has conceded that figures released in past
years measuring the amount of radiation were too low. It is
revising them.
   The plant processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons-making
facilities.
   The camp in Crosby Township, north of Cincinnati, opened in 1922
and provided recreation for more than 150,000 campers over the
years.
   Debbie Bonekamp, a member of the Fort Scott Camp Advisory Board,
said she disagreed with the decision to close the facility.
   ``We felt there was no danger with the environment,'' she said.
``We'd had the water and soil tested each year (for uranium
contamination), and it was always fine.''
   The advisory board had suspended operations at the camp for the
summer because of dwindling enrollment, but hoped the enrollment
might bounce back the next year.

   Thunderstorms brought heavy rain and hail to the Rockies on
Saturday and also soaked parts of the South and Northeast. Some
snow fell in the West.
   Showers and thunderstorms spread over Colorado, spattering
Colorado City and Denver with hail. Locally heavy rain fell in
portions of the central Rockies, and a flash flood watch was posted
for parts of southern Wyoming.
   Severe thunderstorms were expected further south in the southern
high Plains. Tornado watches were posted for northeast and
east-central New Mexico and a large part of western Texas.
   Thunderstorms were scattered throughout the day across much of
Arkansas, Mississippi, western Tennessee and Alabama. Some hail was
reported in Oldham County, Ken.
   Thunderstorms also developed over southeast Florida and along
the Georgia and Carolina coast.
   Showers reached across portions of the middle and northern
Atlantic coastal states, with thunderstorms over central and
western Pennsylvania and New York state.
   In Maine, however, swollen rivers began to recede after forcing
some precautionary evacuations and flooding several roads in the
central and southern parts of the state.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included almost an inch at Meridian, Miss., and two-thirds of an
inch at Savannah, Ga.
   Snow fell over higher elevations in the western states Saturday
and Sunday. An inch of snow was on the ground Sunday morning
between Flagstaff and Winslow, Ariz., and 6 inches fell at Duck
Creek, Utah. Portions of Yellowstone National Park received 2
inches overnight.
   Skies were generally clear over the Pacific Northwest and partly
cloudy from the Dakotas across the upper Mississippi Valley to
Michigan. Skies were sunny in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Lander, Wyo., to 94 degrees at Laredo, Alice and
Beeville, all in Texas.
   The low in the nation Sunday morning was 21 degrees at Truckee,
Calif.
   The forecast for Monday included showers and thunderstorms from
Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley, Gulf Coast states and
the central and southern Appalachians to the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast. Rainshowers were expected over New England, New
York, Pennsylvania and eastern Michigan, with showers and
thunderstorms forecast over western portions of the central and
southern Plains and across most of the mountains of the West.
   Afternoon high temperatures were expected to be in the 50s over
the northern and central Rockies and western Pennsylvania; in the
80s over western Minnesota and portions of the Dakotas, from the
south Atlantic Coast across Florida and the central Gulf Coast
region, and across most of Texas and the desert Southwest to
interior valleys of California; and in the 90s along the Rio Grande
in Texas. Elsewhere, highs were expected in the 60s and 70s.

<HEAD>North Jury Forewoman Was Cousin of Prosecutor's Secretary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury forewoman in the Oliver North trial
said her undisclosed kinship to the secretary of a prosecutor in
the case did not affect her judgment or her decisions.
   ``She knew her job, and I knew mine. Just because she worked for
(prosecutor John) Keker didn't mean diddlywink,'' forewoman Denise
Anderson said in an interview in the May 22 issue of People
magazine.
   In a courthouse elevator during the trial, Ms. Anderson bumped
into Gertrude Griffin, a cousin who Ms. Anderson had learned was
working as a secretary for Keker.
   Ms. Anderson said the two did not discuss the case and she did
not report the meeting or the relationship to Judge Gerhard Gesell.
   The forewoman and her 11 fellow jurors found North, a former
Marine colonel and National Security Council staffer, guilty of
three felony counts and acquitted him of nine others.
   In the interview, Ms. Anderson, a 34-year-old hospital
administrative secretary, said reaching the decision was a
stressful, nerve racking and divisive process that left her feeling
alienated from the other jurors.
   ``A lot of times I would come back to my (hotel) room, shut the
door and just cry,'' she said.
   When she requested additional copies of the judge's instructions
and trial evidence, Ms. Anderson said some of her colleagues were
angered.
   ``Some people fought me on it. They didn't want to read. They
didn't want to discuss,'' she told the magazine.
   Later, when she asked for larger quarters in which to work
without consulting the other jurors, ``they began cussing me out.''
   ``We didn't have time for politeness,'' she said. ``A man's life
was in our hands.''
   The panel couldn't even agree on rest breaks.
   ``I figured we were taking too much time off, (but) they wanted
to take more breaks and goof off,'' she said.
   In the end, she said, her prodding paid off.
   The jury ``did the work because they realized it was
important,'' and ``we had some good conversations and good
arguments.''
   She said the jurors saw North as a scapegoat who followed the
orders of his bosses. She admitted she was concerned about the
stiff sentence North faces, including 10 years in jail and $750,000
in fines.

<TEXT>
   Israel's coalition Cabinet on Sunday overcame
deep divisions and endorsed Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
20-point plan for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   The plan passed by a 20-6 vote after an intense seven-hour
debate.
   It calls for Palestinians to elect representatives to negotiate
on a plan for eventual self-rule, but specifically rules out
negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization and says
Israel will oppose creation of a Palestinian state.
   Many Palestinian leaders rejected the plan.
   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said in Tunis, Tunisia, that
the PLO executive committee would meet ``and then we may have a
response to the plan. The PLO leadership must look over the main
points before we will have any comment.''
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner called the vote a ``great victory''
for the 73-year-old premier. ``It is the first time the Likud and
Labor have been able to unite behind one plan,'' Pazner told The
Associated Press.
   Observers suggested one reason for the positive vote by the
fractious coalition was that the plan sidestepped controversial
issues, such as Palestinian demands for international supervision
of elections and for the participation of the 140,000 Arabs in east
Jerusalem.
   Another Shamir spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, said approval of the
Knesset, the Israeli parliament, was not necessary for the plan.
The Likud-Labor coalition has a majority in the Knesset.
   Pazner said the key question is whether an Arab partner could be
found for negotiations. He said this would be the focus of U.S.
State Department envoy Dennis Ross' forthcoming trip to Egypt and
Jordan. Shamir briefed Ross for 45 minutes after the Cabinet
session.
   Pazner said Ross would return to Israel Tuesday and confer with
Shamir on Arab reactions.
   Most prominent Palestinians reacted negatively to the plan,
although Shamir picked up support from Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij.
   Freij, considered a moderate, told Israel's Arabic TV that
Shamir's plan is a ``worthy idea if it is fairly conducted under
international supervision with the consent of the PLO and the
participation of the residents of east Jerusalem.''
   The plan calls for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
with candidates chosen from districts. Those elected would
negotiate self-rule for the 1.7 million Palestinian residents of
the territories.
   Israel radio said that under the plan the occupied territories
would be divided into 10 districts with each district represented
by one person in the elected body.
   After three years, talks would start on a permanent settlement
of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, with the same local negotiators
playing a ``central role.'' The settlement would be in the context
of a treaty between Jordan and Israel.
   Ziad Abu Ziad, a leading Palestinian, criticized the plan
because it called for a treaty with Jordan, not with Palestinians.
   Five prominent Palestinians sent a letter to U.S. Consul-General
Phillip Wilcox opposing the plan. ``We find the Shamir proposal ...
grossly deficient in as much as it is not part of a political
process that leads clearly to the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state,'' they wrote.
   The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a
hard-line faction of the PLO, called the plan a ``false
enterprise'' aimed at undermining the Palestinian uprising and
plans for an international Middle East peace conference.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a leader of the left-leaning
Labor Party and author of key elements of the plan, said the
Cabinet vote meant that after a long period of paralysis, Israel
had a ``serious and practical plan.''
   Communications Minister Gad Yacobi, also of Labor, said ``I
think the Palestinians would be crazy not to accept the possibility
of electing representatives, a delegation to talk to Israel about
their own future.''
   The daily Yediot Ahronot said Shamir believed elections could be
held within one year, while Rabin estimated six months were needed.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon led right-wing opposition to the
proposal, arguing it would intensify the Palestinian uprising,
divide Jerusalem and lead to creation of a Palestinian state.
   ``This plan ... carries a clear recipe for more violence, more
terrorism and even a danger of war,'' he said on Israel army radio.
   At least 474 Palestinians have died in the 17-month Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Twenty-one Israelis have died.
   Two Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israeli officials
were found dead Sunday, and Arab hospital reports said Israeli
soldiers wounded at least 22 Arabs, including a 10-year-old boy hit
with a plastic bullet.

   A harsh midday sun beat down Sunday on
hunger-striking students in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Some napped after a sleepless night of chanting and singing;
others sat listless amid discarded plastic water bottles and torn
newspapers.
   Then the first stirring musical notes broke the calm. The
Beijing College of Aeronautics' glee club had arrived.
   Several dozen students, led by their conductor, lined up in
front of the strikers and began to sing the ``Internationale,'' the
socialist anthem that has become the hit song of the month-long
students' democracy movement.
   Heads raised, a few strikers joined in.
   The glee club sang the anthem a few times and the performance
ended to cries of ``Thank you!''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Speaking of singing.
   Late Sunday, students demanded that Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang and Premier Li Peng address them from the center of
Tiananmen Square.
   But what could they say to appease the student anger over
corruption and official incompetance?
   ``Make them sing,'' said one student.
   ``And make it the Internationale,'' said another.

<TEXT>
   Students from Beijing Medical University donned white coats and
arm bands and established a first-aid squad.
   ``The first symptoms will be headache,'' said one young man, who
like many others feared to give his name because of possible
reprisal. He and his colleagues set up shop amid boxes containing
aspirin, packets of Chinese medicines and bottles of glucose.
   ``We'll be needed,'' they predicted early in the first full day
of the hunger strike, and they were. As a strong sun blazed down on
the square the first-aid team moved among their fellow students and
handed out pills.
   ``If they fall down fainting, and they are in real danger, we'll
send them out,'' said one member. ``But if someone insists on
persisting and won't go, we have to accept it.''
   At least 10 students were carried Sunday afternoon to a nearby
city ambulance, suffering from dehydration and too much sun.

<TEXT>
   Workers who have cheered the students during earlier protests
and occasionally accompanied them demonstrated their support again.
Two groups with about 200 people in each each paraded around the
square before dawn Monday under banners proclaiming themselves the
``Capital Workers Group'' and chanted, ``Long live the students!''
   Several joined the hunger strikers.
   ``I've been marching with the students since (April) 18th,''
said a fasting construction worker. ``My boss has chewed me out ..
. and my wife opposes it too. But I'm concerned about democracy. We
workers should be the masters.''
   He said other workers ``are waiting. If there is bloodshed, they
will rise up.''

   What some people call ``Gorbachev fever'' has yet
to invade China, but the Chinese media and public are praising the
Soviet leader in connection with this week's summit.
   ``We hope our leaders will learn from him,'' said a middle-aged
man who lauded President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,
or openness.
   The Soviets ``even had election protests,'' the man said. ``We
haven't come that far.''
   The summit symbolizes the end of a 30-year rift between the two
communist giants.
   The Chinese government, however, has maintained a low-key
attitude toward the historic meeting. It appears determined to
assure Western countries that China has no intention of restoring
the close ties it had with the Soviets in the 1950s.
   In the week leading up to the summit, state-run newspapers began
publishing a few articles on the Soviet Union and on Gorbachev and
his wife, Raisa, but little was said of the summit.
   The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, carried a
glowing profile of Mrs. Gorbachev on Sunday, writing of her beauty,
intelligence and ``vivacious personality.''
   National television broadcast a program Sunday night on
Gorbachev and his family. But on the national evening news,
Gorbachev's departure from Moscow followed reports on a steel
conference and a student hunger strike at Beijing's Tiananmen
Square.
   Despite the lack of coverage Beijing residents are aware of the
summit and the Soviet leader's experiments in allowing greater
political and cultural debate.
   Demonstrating students who are demanding a free press and
greater political freedom view Gorbachev's reforms with special
interest.
   About 6,000 students signed a letter delivered Saturday to the
Soviet Embassy inviting Gorbachev to speak to them at Beijing
University. The embassy said it would deliver the letter to
Gorbachev but his schedule during the three-day Beijing visit is
tight.
   Qinghua University students at the Tiananmen Square protest
referred to the Soviet Union and some East European countries as
examples of a worldwide trend toward democratization. They said
China will be affected.
   ``The mainstream is moving toward economic liberalization and
political democratization,'' they declared in a manifesto read at
the square. ``The People's Congress of the Soviet Union has
realized a relatively high level of democracy compared to other
socialist countries.''
   There seems to be little public animosity or suspicion toward
the country that the official Chinese media lashed for many years
as a war-mongering territory grabber.
   ``If they demobilize some of the troops from their border and we
demobilize some of ours, we'll reduce the burden of military
spending,'' said a young man on a bicycle.
   ``Of course, in foreign relations, two countries always use each
other, don't they?'' he addeds. ``I'm sure we're willing to use the
Soviets if we can.''

<TEXT>
   Churchgoers applauded nationwide
Sunday when Roman Catholic clergy read a letter condemning
electoral fraud and violence, and opposition supporters staged
brief, peaceful protests.
   The pastoral letter, which urged Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
Defense Forces not to use arms against ``a defenseless people,''
also was read during a service broadcast on state-run television.
   At churches across the capital and in other Panamanian cities,
worshipers waved white handerkerchiefs, paper, and Panamanian flags.
   Opposition supporters handed out leaflets urging similar
displays during a general strike called Wednesday to protest fraud
during the May 7 election and violence by Noriega, the nation's de
facto ruler.
   ``We must say `no' to all of this corruption and `yes' to
liberty and justice,'' said the Rev. Javier Villanueva at Cristo
Rey church.
   The congregation chanted ``Justice, Justice'' and waved white
handkerchiefs when opposition vice presidential candiates Ricardo
Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford walked in.
   In brief comments to reporters after services, Arias Calderon
said rumors were being spread about a political settlement
involving a power-sharing junta.
   However, he rejected the idea.``Nothing doing. No playing with
the popular will of the people,'' he declared.
   ``The only solution begins with recognition of the May 7
election. Nothing more, nothing less,'' he said.
   The opposition has said it will negotiate only with the
military, because it does not recognize the current government. It
has said Noriega can join talks, but only with the understanding
that any agreement will call for him to leave.
   The opposition's presidential candidate, Guillermo Endara,
remained hospitalized, recovering from injuries sustained when he,
Arias Calderon and Ford were beaten by Noriega supporters Wednesday.
   At Iglesia del Carmen, in an affluent neighborhood of the
capital, the congregation applauded for several minutes after the
pastoral letter was read. Members of the congregation waved white
paper, white handkerchiefs and Panamanian flags.
   The same was true at churches in the poor neighborhoods of San
Miguelito and Rio Abajo, and in the cities of David, about 200
miles west, and Colon, 50 miles to the north.
   In the past, such services have been broken up by gunfire from
police.
   One leaflet being distributed outside churches asked members of
the congregation to stop playing the national lottery or going to
the race track, because that money helps the government.
   Meanwhile, nearly 1,900 newly deployed U.S. troops dispatched by
President Bush settled into tents around bases a few miles from the
city.
   ``This place is nice from what I've seen. I talked to some
Panamanians last night, and I doubt if they'll have to use us,''
said Army Pfc. Michael Grant of the 5th Division from Fort Polk, La.
   Bush deployed the troops following widespread reports of fraud
during the presidential vote and the violence against the
opposition candidates. They will back up the 10,000 American
soldiers already in Panama.
   Opposition leaders say Endara easily defeated Noriega's
hand-picked candidate, Carlos Duque, in the presidential race.
   The government nullified the election results.
   Televised church services were followed by a weekly news program
produced by the Defense Forces, which include the police and
military.
   An announcer read a brief statement saying the United States
``has forgotten that a small and weak society also has its
dignity.''
   ``When the drums of war sound from the White House ... we are
ready to give our lives for Panama,'' it said.
   One normal feature of the program was omitted: a summary of
Noriega's week. Instead, an old tape of a visit Noriega made to the
Panama Canal was broadcast.
   The pastoral letter was issued Thursday by Archbishop Marcos
McGrath and other bishops of the Roman Catholic Episcopal
Conference of Panama and was read by Catholic clergy nationwide.
   There had been some doubt the government would permit it to be
read on the government-controlled television's normal Sunday Mass
broadcast.
   McGrath did not appear at the service as he usually does, but
the letter was read by a lay person. McGrath was celebrating Mass
at an undisclosed location, a spokeswoman for the church said.
   Church support for fair elections is a new factor in the
political equation here, where the church has not been as
influential as it is in Nicaragua or El Salvador.
   Noriega has been indicted for drug trafficking in the United
States, which has been trying to remove him for more than a year.
   Wednesday's general strike is to coincide with a meeting of the
Organization of American States in Washington to discuss the
Panamanian situation.
   The Panamanian government maintains the meeting should focus on
U.S. interference in Panama. The opposition says the meeting should
focus on election fraud and political repression.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis is due to leave Panama on Monday
following his recall by Bush. The Mexican and Venezuelan envoys
also are being recalled.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
been compared to Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria and Winston Churchill,
but she says her historical counterpart is actually an American.
   ``You go back to the person who really had to fight for what he
believed in and _ I couldn't begin to compare myself with him _ it
was Abraham Lincoln,'' she said in an interview in the June issue
of Vanity Fair magazine.
   The daughter of a small-town grocer, Thatcher married and had
twins while studying to become a lawyer. When her children were 6,
she was elected to parliament for the first time and went on to
lead the Conservative Party.
   Now in her third term as prime minister, she has a reputation
for toughness that has earned her the nickname ``Iron Lady.''
   ``I'm driven to be confrontational,'' she told Vanity Fair. ``I
have had to learn to be combative to get it across. Of course, when
you're a woman and you're combative they say you're an iron lady.
Let me tell you, if you hadn't got a spine which was strong and
firm, and a will which was strong and firm, we would never have got
through.''
   She also quotes Rudyard Kipling: ```Being a female of the
species is more deadly than the male.' So it's nothing unusual _
it's just that people have got this strange thing that to be strong
you have to be a man.''

<HEAD>Government Opens Detour to Bypass Rebel-threatened Highway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of trucks on Sunday rumbled
along a dirt road built to bypass a section of the major supply
route to the capital that is frequently cut by anti-communist
rebels.
   The 18-mile detour runs across flat planes, unlike the main
Salang highway that weaves through the mountains between Kabul and
the Soviet border, 260 miles away.
   Soldiers stationed at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Kabul
said the new road was opened Wednesday and it has been used by more
than 1,000 privately operated trucks. They said about 200 trucks
reached Kabul Sunday.
   There are government checkpoints every 1.5 miles along the
detour, according to the soldiers.
   Guerrillas in the mountains north of Kabul often attacked
convoys on the Salang highway, causing a shortage of food, fuel and
other essential supplies in the capital.
   ``The government controls this road,'' said one driver,
42-year-old Ghulabb, as his truck passed through the checkpoint to
enter Kabul. The truck was hauling three cars and auto parts with
firewood, bags of rice and cans of gasoline piled on top.
   Ghulabb, who uses only one name, said he left the Soviet border
Friday and made the journey to Kabul in two days.
   But finding drivers to make the hazardous trip is difficult and
owners must pay high wages to ge supplies delivered.
   Ghulabb said he earns the equivalent of about $500 per month,
which is more than double the average annual income in Afghanistan.
   Ghulabb, the father of five children, said he does not worry
about getting caught in the crossfire between rebels and government
troops.
   ``I've been driving for 16 years and haven't been fired on
yet,'' he said. ``Someone controls the road and someone wants to
use the road and it's how you make your deal.''
   When the rebels intensified their attacks on the Salang highway
in January the Soviet Union began an airlift to Kabul to overcome
severe shortages.
   The airlift is continuing with as many as 50 military transport
planes flying into Kabul daily with food, fuel, weapons and
ammunition.
   The Soviet Union sent military personnel into Afghanistan in
December 1978 to help the Marxist government battle the rebels and
for several years had more than 100,000 soldiers in the country.
   The Soviets agreed to withdraw under an Afghan-Pakistani
agreement and Soviet officials said all of their soldiers had left
the country by Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Man Claims `Bust Lorenzo' Hat Got Him Arrested On Eastern Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 28-year-old button collector says he was kicked
off an Eastern Airlines jet after he put on a ``Bust Lorenzo'' hat,
but airport officials say he was arrested for criminal trespass.
   Atlanta police Lt. Eugene Bell said John Zaubler, 28, of New
York was arrested on the misdemeanor charge following the incident
Thursday and later released on bond.
   Mark Coates, a supervisor with airport operations at Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport said Zaubler was arrested after he
refused to sit in his assigned seat on the Eastern flight from New
York to Florida.
   Coates said Eastern personnel ``asked him to sit in the seat and
he didn't want to sit there. ... Then he refused to leave the
airplane.''
   Eastern officials called the police who arrested Zaubler, Coates
said.
   Coates said he did not believe the incident was related to the
ongoing strike against Eastern Airlines, which has been
characterized by bitter disputes between union workers and Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp.
   Zaubler, however, gave a different version of events in an
interview Sunday in New York City.
   Zaubler said he had gotten off the jet during a layover in
Atlanta. At the airport terminal, Zaubler saw pickets with ``bust
Lorenzo'' buttons and, as a collector of about 50,000 political
buttons, he asked for and was given one. Then, he said, he paid a
picket $5 for a ``bust Lorenzo'' cap.
   Zaubler, a real estate executive, said he wore the button and
cap into the Eastern terminal and finally took them off after
repeated objections from Eastern personnel.
   When he got back on the plane, he said someone was sitting in
his seat and some passengers had taken his three bags from the
overhead compartment and were going through his possessions.
   He said Eastern ticket agents on the plane refused to help him
and ordered him to sit somewhere else, telling him the flight now
had open seating so the seat assignment on his boarding pass from
New York no longer was valid.
   ``I put the Lorenzo cap back on for 15 seconds,'' he said.
   At that point, he said, one of the ticket agents told him:
``That's it. You're off the plane.''
   Zaubler, who described himself as a conservative Republican who
thinks ill of unions and has ``tremendous respect'' for Frank
Lorenzo, said he apologized but was taken off the plane by police
officers and arrested.

<TEXT>
   Young survivors of a bus crash that left 24
children and three adults dead helped unveil a black granite
monument on Mother's Day, the first anniversary of the fiery
tragedy.
   The Rev. W. Don Tennison, whose Radcliff First Assembly of God
church owned the bus, prayed for an end to drunken driving and for
the passage of laws to ``make it too costly to get into an
automobile ... drunk.''
   The aging school bus was carrying 67 passengers home from a
Cincinnati amusement park on May 14, 1988, when it was hit by a
pickup truck going the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton,
about 100 miles northeast of here. It was the nation's worst
alcohol-related highway accident and one of the worst bus crashes
in U.S. history.
   The truck driver, Larry Mahoney of Owen County, will be tried in
November on 27 counts of murder and one count of driving while
intoxicated.
   The monument, raised triangular slabs sloping away from a
benchlike centerpiece, stands in North Hardin Memorial Gardens,
where many of the victims are buried. It bears the names of the 27
dead and the 40 survivors _ as well as the emblem of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving.
   ``We felt a positive statement must be made,'' said Roy Keith,
owner of the company that built the monument. The idea was for a
memorial that would remind viewers of ``the terrible blight of
drunken drivers,'' he said at the ceremony.
   The monument was unveiled by survivors Aaron Conyers, 16; Carey
Aurentz, 15; Katrina Muller, 14; and Harold Dennis, 15; as well as
sons of two of the adults who died: John Robert Pearman Jr., whose
father drove the bus; and Charles J. Kytta III, whose father was
the church's youth minister.
   The Rev. Gene Waggoner, pastor of Stithton Baptist Church in
this northern Kentucky city of about 14,000 people, prayed for
inner peace for those mourning the victims, but said ``we have
every reason to be bitter.''
   Kentucky's top state highway official said the government was
trying to ensure that the tragedy will not be repeated.
   Kentucky Transportation Secretary Milo D. Bryant renewed his
criticism of the state school board's refusal 11 days earlier to
require more stringent training of school bus drivers.
   That was a recommendation of a bus-safety task force appointed
by Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and chaired by Bryant. The school board
balked because the state did not provide the $250,000 the panel
estimated would be the cost of the extra training.
   ``I say that you cannot put a price on the safety of our
children,'' said Bryant, who did not mention the board by name.
   Bryant said he would ``fight to have another emergency door ...
on the left side of all new school buses,'' a move also opposed by
the state Department of Education.
   The dedication was to be followed by two other ceremonies.
   Members of a surviving-family support group planned a community
appreciation service in the gymnasium of nearby North Hardin High
School, which overlooks the cemetery.
   That was to be followed by a public prayer and memorial service
in the football stadium behind the high school.

<HEAD>Teachers Strike Looms With No Last-Minute Reprieve in Sight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE M. PETERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers cast aside any chances for a
last-minute resolution of their lengthy labor dispute with the
school district and spent Sunday readying picket signs and rallying
the troops.
   ``We've got our people all across the district making phone
calls to their teachers telling them to be ready for the picket
line,'' said Catherine Carey, spokeswoman for United Teachers-Los
Angeles.
   Board of Education President Roberta Weintraub said the district
would make no last-ditch contract offer.
   Despite the consensus that a strike was imminent, Ms. Weintraub
said she expected teachers to back down and settle before the
midnight strike deadline.
   ``The reality of the offer _ which is one of the best in the
nation, quite frankly _ is what makes me optimistic,'' Ms.
Weintraub said. ``With the variety of things we see on the table,
it is very unusual to have a strike.''
   The walkout was set to begin Monday, with hastily hired
substitutes crossing picket lines to teach the district's nearly
600,000 students.
   With five weeks remaining before summer vacation, the strike
threatened to create havoc with students' final grades. But
teachers stood by their demands for higher pay and more say in how
schools are run.
   ``We have not received any indication from the school district
that they want to come to the bargaining table,'' Ms. Carey said.
   Teachers have been adamant in their demand for a two-year
contract with a 21 percent pay hike. They also want elimination of
unpaid, non-teaching duties like school yard supervision and
after-school meetings, and more influence in how their schools are
run, an issue known as teacher governance.
   The district has offered teachers a 21.5 percent pay raise
spread over three years and a teacher governance plan that union
leaders have dismissed as tilted in favor of administrators.
   No formal bargaining talks took place during the weekend. Union
and district officials talked informally but were unable to arrange
any formal resumption of negotiations, leading to gloomy
predictions about any hope of settling the dispute.
   ``It looks like it's going to happen,'' said Pat Spencer,
spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District. ``We have
been preparing and planning for this for two months.''
   The district conducted mass hirings of substitutes, as teachers
marched outside recruiting centers carrying picket signs bearing
messages such as ``this is no way to begin a teaching career.''
   Hundreds of people responded to the district's call for
emergency substitutes, but the number fell far short of
replacements needed for the thousands of teachers expected to
strike.
   Ms. Weintraub warned teachers that their benefits would lapse
Monday if they strike, unless they paid $270.83 a month from their
own pockets.
   Los Angeles Unified School District, with about 800 schools
serving 594,000 students, is second only in size to New York City
and hasn't been struck by teachers since a 23-day walkout in 1970.
   United Teachers-Los Angeles, which represents about 22,000 of
the district's 32,000 teachers, nurses and counselors, has been
locked in the contract battle with the district for more than a
year.
   State and local elected officials stayed out of the dispute
until last week when Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti, D-Los
Angeles, said the district would get at least $34 million, and
possibly as much as $60 million in new revenue that could be used
for higher teacher salaries.
   But district officials refused to raise their offer based solely
on projections of funds that might be received.
   In March, teachers overwhelmingly rejected a 20-percent pay
raise over three years, effectively stalling negotiations despite
the efforts of a state mediator.
   Teachers salaries start at $23,440 and can go as high as $43,319.
   Administrators' salaries range from $37,000 to $95,600. District
Superintendent Leonard Britton, who has been criticized by union
leaders for his perceived hard-line attitude, receives an annual
salary of $141,000.

<HEAD>Actors Campaign to Save Remains of Elizabethan Theater</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shakespearean actors took to a makeshift stage
Sunday in a bid to block construction of an office building at the
site of a 16th century theater where the Bard himself once
performed.
   The players entertained a rally that attracted hundreds of
supporters to the remains of the Rose Theater on the south bank of
the River Thames.
   ``It's like the Greeks knocking down the Parthenon to make a car
park,'' Sir Peter Hall, former director of the National Theater,
said at the rally.
   ``I do not believe any other country at this moment in the world
would do this and it's a terrifying example ... of a situation in
our country where cash is more important than the soul of the
country itself,'' he said.
   On the makeshift stage a few yards from the Rose, members of the
Royal Shakespeare Company read from William Shakespeare's ``Henry
VI,'' which they now are performing in London.
   Shakespeare is thought to have acted in ``Henry VI'' at the
Rose. His early plays were staged there.
   Bulldozers were scheduled to begin work on an office building at
the site Monday morning. Construction has been postponed for five
months since the remains of the theater were found.
   Archaeologists pressed ahead with their excavation Sunday, and
protesters declared they would conduct an all-night vigil.
   The effort to save the theater site has attracted the support of
American actor Dustin Hoffman, who is in London to perform in
Shakespeare's ``The Merchant of Venice.'' Other dramatic luminaries
who have called for preserving the site include actors Laurence
Olivier, Derek Jacobi, Ian McKellen, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Dame Judi
Dench and playwright Tom Stoppard.
   Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley, whose responsibilities
include the ancient monuments, said Friday he had not yet decided
what to do.
   The developers have said the work will cause ``minimal damage''
to the remains of the theater.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons
Thursday, ``Everything possible must be done to preserve the
theater .... There have been very constructive discussions between
the developers, English Heritage (a body that preserves historical
sites), and the Museum of London, with the result that the remains
are going to be preserved with the minimum of damage.''
   However, Hedley Swain of the Museum of London said Sunday: ``We
do not feel that their idea of preservation is very suitable. A lot
of the site will be irreplaceably damaged.''

restructuring of the economy.
   In foreign policy he put the West on the defensive with his
initiatives on arms control. He withdrew Soviet troops from
Afghanistan, eased Kremlin controls over the Soviets' Eastern
European allies and improved relations with the United States and
Western Europe.
   In 1988 the Supreme Soviet elected Gorbachev president.

   Deng was purged twice by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution and then staged a comeback that turned China around.
   He transformed a country dominated by ideological battles into
one with pragmatic, market-oriented economic policies.
   Living standards have improved for millions of Chinese but the
modernization drive has led to serious problems of inflation and
corruption.
   Deng wears a hearing aid and smokes heavily but is not known to
have any serious health problem. There are persistent rumors he
will retire from all his offices after the Gorbachev visit.

the Central Military Commission in 1982. He backed Deng's 1985
decision to end the wartime footing of the army and reduce the
force of more than 4 million soldiers by 1 million.
   The post of president is largely ceremonial but Yang does have

   A premature infant born to a
brain-dead teen-ager has died, about 32 hours after her mother was
taken off life support following her birth.
   The baby, born seven weeks premature Thursday and suffering from
lung problems, died at 9:05 p.m. Saturday, said Jan Westerson,
nursing supervisor at San Bernardino County Medical Center.
   The child's mother, Tanya Marie Rivera, 15, was removed from a
respirator and died at 12:58 p.m. Friday.
   The child was named Tanya Marie by her grandparents, who had
argued in court that hospital officials were wrong in keeping their
daughter on life support.
   They said she should be allowed to die but backed off after
anti-abortion activists joined the debate and urged that the girl
be kept alive until her baby was brought to full term.
   The teen-ager was declared brain-dead March 15 after being shot
in the head, allegedly by her 16-year-old boyfriend, Benny Danny
Tapia. A witness has said the shooting was accidental, and no
charges have been filed.
   Tapia has been jailed in Long Beach, charged with killing a
21-year-old man in an unrelated incident.
   An autopsy was planned to determine the cause of the baby's
death.

<HEAD>Cheney Says Diplomacy Must Be Used In Removing Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diplomacy must be used if Panamanian leader
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is to be removed from power, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday.
   Cheney, adopting a moderate tone a day after President Bush
urged the Panamanian people to drive Noriega from power, said
support from other South American leaders would help the
administration's efforts to encourage the general's departure.
   ``I think whatever you do is going to have to be done
diplomatically,'' the former Wyoming congressman said at
commencement exercises at the University of Wyoming.
   ``It would help if the other Latin American nations would come
together and make it clear that they won't deal with a Panamanian
government headed by Mr. Noriega.
   ``The Organization of American States will meet next week. If
they take a tough, strong position and join in supporting, for
example, the U.S. economic sanctions, those kinds of things might
conceivably, ultimately result in his departure,'' he said.
   Cheney praised Bush for his decision to send U.S. troops to
Panama in the wake of Noriega's efforts to nullify the results of
an election in which the general's handpicked candidates were
defeated.
   ``I think it was a necessary move, it was a step that a prudent
man would take,'' he said. ``We've got some 40,000 Americans who
live in Panama, we've got major obligations ... under the Panama
Canal Treaty.
   ``Hopefully, the situation will be resolved peaceably. Mr.
Noriega should obviously step down and let the people of Panama
prevail in terms of the election,'' he said.
   Cheney said the United States would like to avoid violence, but
added that the country has a commitment to protect the Panama Canal
under the treaty.
   ``That commitment runs to the end of the century and the
president, as commander-in-chief, has an obligation to carry out
the treaty responsibilities and also to safeguard American lives,''
he said. ``I think it is important that Noriega understand that we
are there specifically to see to it that we enforce our rights
under the treaty.''
   Cheney, who was honored as a ``distinguished alumni'' of the
university, also said he hopes Congress will increase defense
spending in the future.
   ``Everybody has this myth in mind that somehow we had this
massive arms buildup in the 1980s and it's been growing year by
year,'' he said. ``It did grow in the early 1980s, but it's been
stable to downhill ever since. If you keep cutting the defense
budget, we'll end up sooner or later with less military
capability.''

   Young survivors of a bus crash that left 24
children and three adults dead helped unveil a black granite
monument Sunday, one of three ceremonies marking the first
anniversary of the fiery tragedy.
   ``In some ways, today is worse than others. It's the first
anniversary combined with Mother's Day, of all things,'' Rev. David
A. Seamands of Asbury Theological Seminary told a televised
community memorial service.
   More than 1,000 people attended the service at North Hardin High
School's football stadium, which overlooks the cemetery where many
of the victims of the May 14, 1988, accident are buried.
   About the same number of people attended the first service
dedicating the monument at the cemetery, as well as the second
ceremony at the high school to thank those who helped victims'
families through the past year.
   The aging school bus was carrying 67 passengers home when it was
hit by a pickup truck going the wrong way on Interstate 71 near
Carrolton, about 100 miles northeast of here. It was the nation's
worst alcohol-related highway accident and one of the worst bus
crashes in U.S. history.
   The truck driver, Larry Mahoney of Owen County, will be tried in
November on 27 counts of murder and one count of driving while
intoxicated.
   At the football stadium Sunday, the Rev. W. Don Tennison, whose
Radcliff First Assembly of God church owned the bus, read the names
of the 27 victims ``whose lives were cut short so suddenly by a
drunk driver.''
   As each name was called, a family member placed a yellow rose on
one of 27 wreaths of yellow carnations. Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and
his wife, Martha, then placed roses on a larger wreath of yellow
roses and white carnations.
   Wilkinson promised to take any action necessary to prevent a
recurrence. ``Where stronger penalties are needed, then stronger
penalties we will impose,'' he said.
   Tennison pleaded for all to refrain from drinking and driving.
   President Bush, who attended a Republican fund-raiser the night
before in Woodford County nearly 70 miles to the east, declined an
invitation to attend the service but sent a lengthy telegram, which
was read aloud.
   The telegram called drunken driving ``a national tragedy,'' and
said laws against drunken driving must be strictly enforced.
   The monument dedicated in North Hardin Memorial Gardens consists
of raised triangular slabs sloping away from a benchlike
centerpiece. It bears the names of the 27 dead and 40 survivors _
as well as the emblem of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
   ``We felt a positive statement must be made,'' said Roy Keith,
owner of the company that built the monument. The idea was for a
memorial that would remind viewers of ``the terrible blight of
drunken drivers,'' he said at the ceremony.
   The monument was unveiled by survivors Aaron Conyers, 16; Carey
Aurentz, 15; Katrina Muller, 14; and Harold Dennis, 15; as well as
sons of two of the adults who died: John Robert Pearman Jr., whose
father drove the bus; and Charles J. Kytta III, whose father was
the church's youth minister.
   The Rev. Gene Waggoner, pastor of Stithton Baptist Church in
this northern Kentucky city of about 14,000 people, prayed for
inner peace for those mourning the victims, but said ``we have
every reason to be bitter.''
   Kentucky's top state highway official said the government was
trying to ensure that the tragedy will not be repeated.
   Kentucky Transportation Secretary Milo D. Bryant renewed his
criticism of the state school board's refusal 11 days earlier to
require more stringent training of school bus drivers.
   That was a recommendation of a bus-safety task force appointed
by Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and chaired by Bryant. The school board
balked because the state did not provide the $250,000 the panel
estimated would be the cost of the extra training.
   ``I say that you cannot put a price on the safety of our
children,'' said Bryant, who did not mention the board by name.
   Bryant said he would ``fight to have another emergency door ...
on the left side of all new school buses,'' a move also opposed by
the state Department of Education.

   A NASA Boeing 747 carrying the space
shuttle Atlantis back to Kennedy Space Center in Florida remained
grounded here Sunday because of stormy weather.
   ``The weather here is fine, it's the weather between here and
where it's going that's bad,'' said a spokesman for Biggs Army Air
Field, who declined to identify himself.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration jet, carrying
the space shuttle on its back, left Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
Saturday on the first leg of a flight to return to Kennedy Space
Center. It arrived in Fort Bliss early Sunday.
   The Fort Bliss spokesman said the jet planned to depart Monday
morning, weather permitting.
   Thunderstorms and some tornadoes plagued most of Texas over the
weekend.

   Barry Manilow returned to the Broadway stage
Sunday, one night after a stomach ailment forced the popular singer
to cut his concert short.
   ``I'm fine,'' the 42-year-old performer told the Gershwin
Theater audience after his opening number Sunday. ``I'm really fine
and I want to thank everyone for their concern.''
   Saturday evening, Manilow was rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital
after suffering a reaction to medication prescribed for a stomach
ailment, the singer's spokeswoman, Susan Dubow, said Sunday.
Manilow was stricken during intermission, and the second half of
the concert was canceled.
   ``He is feeling much better. I think he rested much better,''
the spokeswoman said.
   Manilow's Broadway run was recently extended to June 3.

   An international team of eight explorers completed
a 620-mile trek to the North Pole on Sunday despite poor visibility
and drifting ice that hampered their journey, expedition organizers
said.
   Organizers said the bad weather prevented a Twin Otter plane
from making the trip to pick up the explorers who completed their
journey at 3:38 a.m. EDT.
   ``They're just verifying their position by satellite,'' said
Wendy White, a spokesman for the trip, known as Icewalk. ``They
think they're at the Pole.''
   The explorers left Ellesmere Island in Canada's Northwest
Territories on March 20. They made their journey to draw attention
to pollution and the dangers of global warming, known as the
greenhouse effect.
   The team includes members from the United States, Britain,
Canada, the Soviet Union, Australia, West Germany and Japan.
   The mission was designed to be different from previous
expeditions by making use only of human power. The group planned
its mission with skis and sledges for supplies, but without
dogsleds or skimobiles.
   The mission has been led by Robert Swan, a British explorer who
walked to the South Pole with two other men in 1986. A successful
completion of the current trip would make him the first person on
record to walk to both poles.
   The trekkers are scheduled to hold a news conference Monday at
Resolute Bay in the Northwest Territories if they are able to
return by then.

<HEAD>So What's a Model Year Anyway?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The solar calendar is 365 days long, the lunar
calendar 354. But only in Detroit can you have a year 638 days
long. Or 371 days, starting the day after Christmas.
   For a range of reasons, automakers create their own calendars
and call them model years. It's May 1989. Look how many
advertisements are on the air and in print pushing 1990 model cars
now in dealer showrooms?
   To outsiders, just when a model year starts is anybody's guess.
Technically, automakers open their books on a model year on Oct. 1
and close it the following Sept. 30. All during that time, new cars
and trucks are rolling off assembly lines and into showrooms.
   Ford Motor Co. recently has tilted toward introducing cars on
the day after Christmas. Ford started that in 1985 with the
Taurus-Sable and did it most recently with new Cougars and
Thunderbirds.
   What about the Chevy that replaces the General Motors Corp.
division's Celebrity line? Right now, it's possible for a new-car
buyer to pick up an '89 Celebrity or the car that replaces it, a
'90 Lumina, at the same dealership on the same day. A few new '88
Celebrities are still around, too.
   GM spokeswoman Ruth Bouldes said marketing was the driving force
behind introducing Lumina in April.
   ``The spring market is the most important market for the
calendar year,'' she said. The Lumina should be available for 638
days, figuring that the car will be around on Dec. 31, 1990.
   Marketing is just one factor in decisions on when to introduce a
car. Others involve retooling factories for the new model and
working out unforeseen problems.
   ``All the preplanning in the world can't take care of things
that need to be done to coincide with a date that was established
years before,'' said Ford spokesman Dave Krupp. ``With the growing
concern for satisfied customers, it just doesn't make sense to put
a car in the marketplace if we are not certain it was ready.''
   The government pretty much steers clear of model years.
   Passive restraint regulations _ which call for automatic seat
belts and air bags, for instance _ are keyed to date of the
vehicle's manufacture, said National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration spokesman Tim Hurd.
   ``It doesn't matter what the manufacturer calls it,'' Hurd said.
   At the Environmental Protection Agency, which governs fuel
economy and emissions, the law reads:
   ``The term `model year' with reference to any specific calendar
year, means a manufacturer's annual production period (as
determined by the EPA administrator) which includes Jan. 1 of such
calendar year. If a manufacturer has no annual production period,
the term `model year' means the calendar year.''
   Volkswagen United States Inc., a subsidiary of the West German
automaker, has still another interpretation. It markets Wolfsburg
Limited Editions cars to test consumer reaction to new colors and
options.
   That annual practice started with a car officially christened a
1983{.

<HEAD>High Fructose Corn Syrup Futures Trading A Flop At Grain Exchange</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even though the trading board for high
fructose corn syrup futures at the Minneapolis Grain Exchange has
been without a regular pulse for nearly two years, the originator
refuses to declare it dead.
   ``Occasionally there is a seller and occasionally there is a
buyer but it seems that never the two can meet,'' said Richard
Rhodie, who led the exchange's effort to become the world's only
licensed hub for the trading of high fructose corn syrup futures
contracts.
   After a sweet debut in the spring of 1987, the giant millers and
prolific soda pop bottlers who were expected to feed off the market
departed with a sour taste. To their dismay they discovered in July
of that year that shipping routes for the sugar substitute included
stops not authorized by quality control experts at Pepsi and
Coca-Cola bottlers, Rhodie said.
   Handling the raw material had not been contemplated by many of
the traders, but a group of sellers suddenly exercised their right
to make deliveries, Rhodie said. One contract buys 48,000 pounds of
the corn syrup, the equivalent of a tank truck.
   A sudden liquidation of contracts occurred and trading slammed
to a halt. The shipping snafu has been corrected, Rhodie said, but
trading never recovered. Months go by without a trade, leaving
players with no assurances that they can buy and sell as they need.
   ``The fact is obvious that it isn't trading well,'' said James
Lindau, president of the exchange. ``It's safe to say that it
hasn't made any money for the grain exchange.''
   Rhodie thought he had a natural when he picked high fructose
corn syrup as a diversification tool for the commodity exchange.
The industry includes big suppliers like A.E. Staley, Archer
Daniels Midland and Cargill Inc. who are used to futures markets.
And there is a booming demand for the product.
   An estimated 14 billion pounds of the material is consumed every
year as an ingredient in soda pop, and baked goods, Rhodie said. It
has a consistency and taste that make it an increasingly attractive
substitute for granular sugar, Rhodie said.
   More important, its price is low, ranging from eight or nine
cents a pound up to 26 cents a pound.
   Rhodie said he envisioned more than 100 contracts a day changing
hands. Bottlers, he thought, would be driven to ``lock in'' the
cost of their most expensive ingredient to ensure profitability in
long-range marketing plans.
   For instance, a bottler could buy a contract to set the cost at
17 cents a pound for syrup needed three months later.
   If the price drops below 17 cents a pound in three months, the
bottler still makes a profit on the sale of the pop. If the price
increases, the bottler makes an additional gain on the sale of the
futures contract.
   ``The market is there if they want to use it,'' he said. ``Right
now they're just living within the traditional constraints of their
business. They pay cash for the product. If they guess right,
they're lucky.''
   The highest volume ever recorded on the exchange was 286
contracts on May 20, 1987, Rhodie said. But volume was dismal in
the second half of 1987 and 1988 was miserable. Rhodie could name
only a few dates in 1988 when more than 10 contracts traded hands,
and activity this year has been nil.
   ``It's unfortunate but, you know, you do your best and you hope
it works,'' Rhodie said. ``I guess I can't take it personally.''
   Lindau said there has been no talk of discontinuing the futures
market. Like Rhodie, Lindau said another drought or other
significant event could jar a response from the industry.
   ``There is still scattered interest,'' Rhodie said. ``But
everybody's still on the sidelines and saying, `I'll trade it if
you trade it.'''

<HEAD>TWA Reports Widening of First-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. said it lost nearly
$83.1 million during the first quarter, widening the shortfall it
suffered a year earlier.
   The nation's ninth-largest airline said its operating expenses
increased in the three months ended March 31, largely because of
higher employee costs.
   The carrier, which was taken private by takeover strategist Carl
Icahn last year, also said it had $16.3 million in charges that
primarily resulted from that transaction.
   TWA lost $52.5 million in the first quarter of 1988.
   The carrier reported revenue of $989.7 million in the first
quarter, compared with $920.2 million a year earlier.
