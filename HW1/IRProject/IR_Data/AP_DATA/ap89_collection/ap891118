<HEAD>Talks Resume In Boeing Strike; Union Warns It Wants Movement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. and Machinists are returning to
the bargaining table Saturday, the 46th day of a strike that's
idled production lines at the world's biggest commercial airplane
builder.
   ``I just felt it is time to get them back to the bargaining
table,'' federal mediator Doug Hammond said of his call for the
meeting.
   The face-to-face talks, which broke off Nov. 4, were set for
1:30 p.m. at Hammond's offices.
   Meanwhile, the union representing engineering workers for Boeing
agreed Friday to extend its present labor contracts beyond their
Dec. 1 expiration dates while negotiations continue.
   The contracts cover nearly 28,000 workers, who are represented
by the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association.
   Agreement on the engineers' and professional workers' pacts,
however, is not expected until there is a settlement in the
Machinists' strike.
   While both Boeing and the Machinists welcomed new talks, the
union warned ``continued stonewalling by the company would lead to
a continuation of the seven-week-old strike.''
   The previous talks broke off after union leaders rejected a
Boeing offer that had a new look but the company conceded included
no new money. The union accused Boeing of trying to build up
workers' hopes, then forcing a membership vote.
   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr declined to say whether there was
any change in either side's position.
   ``Our objective all along has been to get the 57,000 Boeing
employees back to work and the fact the meeting is called is
hopefully a sign that we can get them back to work,'' he said.
   The strike, which began Oct. 4, on Saturday it becomes the
second-longest strike in Boeing's history, surpassing a 1977 work
action that lasted 45 days. The longest, in 1948, lasted 140 days.
   The latest three-year offer from Boeing included annual wage
increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent; annual bonuses of
10 percent of gross pay, 4 percent and 4 percent; a reduction in
mandatory overtime from the current 200 hours a quarter to 144
hours by mid-1990, and across-the-board increases in retirement
benefits.
   Machinists represent 57,000 Boeing workers, including 43,000 in
the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore.,
and a few hundred others at scattered sites in other states.
   Work on production lines has been severely curtailed by the
strike, though Boeing has said it is continuing with help of
supervisory personnel and a few thousand machinists who crossed
picket lines.

<HEAD>`Inchon' Heads List of Decade's Most Disastrous Movies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Inchon,'' the disastrous war epic produced
by the Rev. Sung Myung Moon's Unification Church, has been selected
as the biggest box-office fiasco of the 1980s.
   In a list released Friday by the entertainment research firm
Baseline, 1982's ``Inchon,'' with Laurence Olivier and Jacqueline
Bisset, was said to have cost an estimated $46 million but made
less than $2 million at domestic movie theaters.
   The movie's net loss, $44.1 million, placed ``Inchon'' on top of
Baseline's survey.
   ``Heaven's Gate,'' widely considered the greatest flop in
Hollywood history, landed in fourth place on the top-turkey index.
Director Steven Spielberg, whose ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' is
the all-time box-office champ, finished in a tie for 10th with
``Empire of the Sun.''
   The list does not take into consideration ancillary revenues
such as home video and overseas markets.
   The 10 most spectacular failures, in order:
   ``Inchon'' ($46 million cost, $1.9 million box office, $44.1
million loss); ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' ($52 million,
$9 million, $43 million); ``Ishtar'' ($45 million, $7.7 million,
$37.3 million); ``Heaven's Gate'' ($36 million, $1.5 million, $34.5
million); ``The Cotton Club'' ($46 million, $15 million, $31
million).
   ``Pirates'' ($31 million, $700,000, $30.3 million); ``Rambo
III'' ($58 million, $28 million, $30 million); ``Santa Claus'' ($45
million, $16 million, $29 million); ``Lion of the Desert'' ($30
million, $1.5 million, $28.5 million); ``Empire of the Sun'' ($38
million, $10.5 million, $27.5 million); ``Once Upon a Time in
America'' ($30 million, $2.5 million, $27.5 million).

<TEXT>
   Rats devour or destroy nearly a
half-million tons of grain in Bangladesh each year, enough to feed
at least 3 million people in this impoverished nation, a newspaper
said.
   The destruction begins in farms and continues up to the dining
table, the Bengali-language newspaper Dainik Bangla said Friday,
quoting agricultural experts. The rats destroy about 100,000 tons
of grain in stores alone.
   More than 480,000 tons of rice and wheat _ 2.5 percent of the
country's total grain production _ is lost to the rodents annually,
the paper said.
   Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in the world with an
annual per capita income of $160, produces about 19 million tons of
rice and wheat a year.
   The nation of 110 million people imports 1.6 million tons to 3
million tons of grain to meet yearly shortfalls.
   The rat population reaches its peak during November and December
when winter crops are harvested. During those months, authorities
launch an annual rat-killing campaign.

   Rare silver coins, uncut emeralds and a
70-pound silver bar from a sunken Spanish galleon are among items
to be auctioned to raise money for citrus research and 4-H programs.
   The treasure is just part of the hoard brought up from the
Nuestra Senora de Atocha off Key West by treasure hunter Mel Fisher
in 1985.
   The items were donated by two couples who got them in return for
their investments in Fisher's Treasure Salvors Inc. Organizers of
the auction, scheduled for Dec. 2 in Gainesville, won't disclose
the estimated value of the treasure.
   The donors are Eugene Lyon, a Florida historian specializing in
the Spanish colonial period, his wife, Dotie, and by Barney Greene
and his wife, Hariot. Lyon uncovered records in the Archive of the
Indies in Seville, Spain, that provided valuable clues in Fisher's
search for the treasure ship.
   Fisher will be the guest of honor at the auction.
   Proceeds will go to the University of Florida's Institute for
Food and Agricultural Sciences and Florida 4-H programs.

   East Germany's dreaded secret police, who
attacked pro-democracy protesters last month, will have a new head,
will soon answer to Parliament and will be reduced by 5,000
employees, officials say.
   The Ministry of State Security, previously under direct control
of the General Prosecutor's Office and the ruling Politburo, is in
charge of interior security and counter-intelligence. Many East
Germans fear its agents, who often have been charged with spying on
citizens.
   The state-run news agency ADN announced the changes late Friday.
   Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, the new head of the Office of
National Security, said ``We welcome the control of Parliament ...
and will do everything to win its trust.''
   ``We're leaving everything behind that in the past was
inappropriate or mistaken,'' Schwanitz said in an indirect
reference to past excesses, such as the beating of peaceful
demonstrators.
   He said the department would now concentrate on
counter-terrorism, investigations of ``imperialist espionage'' and
neo-Nazi activities.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Swede Guilty of Smuggling Arms to Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury Friday found a
Swedish businessman guilty of smuggling military hardware to Iran
in violation of the federal Arms Export Control Act.
   The jury also found Karl Erik Nissen, 62, guilty of conspiracy
and money laundering. He and two Canadians were arrested by U.S.
Customs agents who set up a fake company for the investigation.
   Jurors found Nissen innocent of three money laundering charges.
The jury deliberated all day Thursday and for three hours Friday
before reaching a verdict.
   Prosecutors said he faces up to 27 years in prison and fines of
up to $1 million when sentenced in January.
   Nissen, a resident of Norrkoping, Sweden, was arrested May 25
and indicted in connection with the alleged conspiracy to ship
military jet parts to Iran without a proper U.S. license.
   Nissen's alleged co-conspirators, Ronald Hilton Arab, 52, and
Eileen Audrey Arab, 52, both of Vancouver, Canada, pleaded guilty
to similar charges in October and agreed to testify against Nissen.
They will be sentenced next month.
   The three were caught in an undercover investigation by U.S.
Customs agents who set up a bogus business at Corpus Christi
International Airport.
   The government accused Nissen and the Arabs of smuggling 13 air
pressure control devices for F-4C Phantom jet fighters. The devices
were delivered to Iran in March, officials said. The government
said a separate $4.7 million deal was in the works when Nissen and
the Arabs were arrested.
   Nissen maintained that he was a legitimate broker and unaware
the transactions were illegal.
   ``Mr. Nissen is one of those persons who saw Iran after the
revolution (in 1979) as a land of opportunity,'' federal prosecutor
Robert Berg said in his closing argument Thursday. ``He got a copy,
one way or the other, of an Iranian wish list.''
   Defense attorney Bill May argued that Ronald Arab, not Nissen,
was the ``con man'' of the alleged scheme.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Recommends Tribal Self-Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Department officials say they realize
the federal government has mishandled Indian affairs and welcome a
Senate report that recommends allowing tribes to govern themselves.
   ``Quite clearly the federal government in the past has not been
as efficient, as careful or as caring as it should have been in a
number of instances,'' Frank Bracken, Interior undersecretary, said
Friday.
   But he said the department already has begun to correct problems
identified in a 238-page report released by a special investigating
panel of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
   The report summarizes a two-year investigation into government
corruption relating to Indians.
   It recommends that the federal bureaucracy be broken apart to
allow tribes interested in self-determination to negotiate for
grants from the federal government much the same way as do states
and local governments.
   ``Fraud, mismanagement and corruption pervade virtually all
federal Indian programs,'' Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman
of the special committee.
   He said the committee's work showed that many tribes are capable
of managing their own affairs.
   He said federal Indian agencies should continue to exist for
tribes that want the services, but in time all tribes would see the
benefits of self-government, ``assuring that the billions now
wasted on self-perpetuating federal bureaucracies will belong to
tribes themselves, to determine their own destiny.''
   ``In all, the federal budget for Indian programs equals $3.3
billion annually. Yet, surprisingly little of these funds reach the
Indian people,'' DeConcini said.
   Under the committee's proposal, the federal government would
provide an annual grant to each tribe, equal to the tribe's
proportional share of the current federal Indian budget. It would
be a permanent entitlement, in lieu of federal services from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs or other agencies.
   The tribes would have to be accountable for the funds and tribal
officials negotiating the agreements would have to be proven
representatives of their tribes.
   ``I have not yet consulted with Indian tribes about the
recommendations contained in this report and will withhold any
final comment pending consultation,'' said Eddie Brown, head of the
BIA.
   But he said he agreed with the report's finding that ``we must
take real actions and not merely offer Band-Aid solutions.''
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., the only native American
in Congress, joined DeConcini and Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., and Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, in announcing the
proposals.
   ``Two hundred years of mistakes in dealing with the American
Indian can only lead to more of the same without drastic reform,''
Campbell said.
   The lawmakers said it would take a long time to put the
proposals into action, but that they would draw up legislation soon
and that Inouye, chairman of the Select Committee on Indian
Affairs, would hold extensive hearings.
   Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., who chairs the House Interior
Committee, said he had reviewed the Senate report and would work
with Inouye on legislation.
   The special committee, appointed by Inouye, held more than four
weeks of hearings last winter and spring.
   The committee staff visited more than 70 Indian tribes in 16
states, conducted about 2,000 interviews and analyzed more than 1
million documents.
   The panel examined contracting fraud, gaming operations on
reservations, child sexual abuse in federal schools, protection of
natural resources belonging to the Indians, housing, the Indian
Health Service and corruption among tribal officials.

   Western novelist Louis L'Amour is dead, but
he may ride high on the best-seller lists for years thanks to
unpublished and out-of-print work.
   ``We have a couple of full-length novels and we have some
(unpublished) short story material and we have short story material
that was written for the pulps,'' Kathy L'Amour, the author's wife
of 32 years, said recently.
   ``So we're in good shape and we'll have a publishing program
well into the '90s,'' she said.
   L'Amour, a favorite of former President Reagan, died of cancer
in June 1988 at age 80.
   The unpublished works are from what he called his ``toxic dump''
_ piles of papers stacked haphazardly on the floor and desk of his
workroom.
   ``I took about seven days of randomly walking around and
randomly sampling stuff to try and find if there was any order or
not,'' said the author's son, Beau, 28. ``After that week I just
decided there wasn't any order.''
   L'Amour's ``Education of a Wandering Man,'' published a few
weeks ago, is on the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times
bestseller lists for hardcover nonfiction books.
   He was proofreading the memoir the day he died. It was his 105th
published book, including 86 novels, 16 collections of short
stories and three non-fiction books.
   A hardcover book, ``The Sackett Companion,'' and two paperback
collections of short stories, ``Lonigan'' and ``Long Ride Home,''
also have been published since his death.

<TEXT>
   Abortion-rights supporters say they are
setting the stage for next year's congressional battle with a bill
that would write into law the 1973 Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court
ruling that legalized abortion.
   ``This bill is going to be the rallying point,'' said Rep.
Claudine Schneider, R-R.I.
   Bills were introduced in the House and Senate on Friday that
would effectively overcome the Supreme Court decision last summer
in the so-called Webster case that gave states greater authority to
restrict abortions, supporters said.
   Just a few lines long, the bill would forbid states from
restricting a woman's right to have an abortion before the time her
fetus becomes viable for life outside the womb, or at any time when
necessary to protect the life of the mother.
   A leader of the abortion opponents, Rep. Christopher Smith,
R-N.J., said he welcomed the bill because it would bring a full
debate on abortion. He said he was confident the House would defeat
it.
   ``I hope they bring the bill to the floor very quickly,'' he
said. ``The question will then be very squarely: `Will we permit
abortion on demand for the whole nine months of pregnancy?'''
   Although no action was expected until next year, abortion-rights
backers said the bill would become the central focus of future
congressional and political debate on the abortion issue.
   The House bill had 88 sponsors, and a version introduced in the
Senate carried 19 sponsors.
   The bill was aimed at writing into law the landmark 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision establishing a woman's right to an abortion and at
reversing the Webster ruling. Abortion-rights supporters contend
the Webster decision eroded rights established 16 years earlier and
signaled a possible further erosion in future high court decisions.
   The Webster decision, however, has energized abortion-rights
leaders and raised the temperature of the abortion debate in many
states.
   Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., an abortion-rights supporter,
predicted passage by both the House and Senate but acknowledged
backers probably would not be able to override a presidential veto.
   President Bush is appearing in Rhode Island on Monday at an
event for Schneider, despite their differences on abortion.

   Stewart signed 300 to 350 books while several hundred fans

   The show was taped by satellite Nov. 9 at the Wetterlings' home.
Patty Wetterling, the boy's mother, later said she was upset with
the makers of the show because they focused on statistics that

churches, was one of the thousands of East Germans and millions of
West Germans who believed medium-range missiles should not be
stationed in Western Europe to counter Soviet SS-20s.
   The small peace movement in East Germany then centered largely
on its Protestant church, the only institution in the country
independent of the Communist authorities.
   Fuehrer, a quietly determined 46-year-old father of four,
started ``peace prayers'' every Monday.
   Dozens, even hundreds, came. But once NATO missiles were
stationed, Fuehrer recalls, disillusioned East Germans stopped
coming to the Monday prayers and attendance sank to just ten.
   Things changed early in 1988, when East German police arrested
dozens of youths bold enough to celebrate in their own way at an
official ceremony honoring Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Liebknecht,
heroes of Germany's failed communist revolution in 1918.
   ``Many people came, asking to pray for those who were
arrested,'' Fuehrer said in an interview.
   ``And it was there that I first heard from people with problems,
who were waiting to leave the country.''
   Then, the wait could take two or three years. People who had
applied to emigrate West faced obstacles at work, in schools, even
at home. They needed counseling, and they found it in Fuehrer's
Nikolaikirche, where the motto is that the church is ``offen fuer
alle'' (open for all).
   ``Really, we were a substitute for the state,'' Fuehrer said.
``But the state was not ready for, or capable of any dialogue.''
   Despite harassment from the authorities, Fuehrer kept counseling
the would-be emigres, and providing shelter for small alternative
groups such as those concerned with cleaning up Leipzig's heavy
polluted environment.
   ``Now, I've taken down the posters for New Forum,'' East
Germany's largest opposition movement, Fuehrer noted. ``They have a
place of their own now. My philosophy is, political parties have no
place in church. But if they have no other place to go, then the
church will offer them protection.''
   By May 7 of this year, Leipzig's authorities had enough of the
Monday prayers. Police cordons were thrown up around the church and
everyone who attended was registered.
   In a sign of mounting popular discontent, however, the
repression backfired. Curious passers-by stood behind the police
cordons, and gradually became interested in the Monday service,
forcing Fuehrer to ask other Leipzig churches to arrange similar
sessions to get people off the street.
   But the crowds kept growing, irritating the Communist
authorities. Under pressure from a mass exodus of tens of thousands
of young people through Eastern Europe, the government started to
crack down hard on dissent.
   On Oct. 7, the nation's 40th anniversary, police in Leipzig and
other cities beat hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators in what
Fuehrer saw as a ``dress rehearsal'' for a move against his Monday
service and spontaneous marches afterwards.
   Two days later, the attempt was made. After Fuehrer refused to
bow to threats of prosecution, the local Communist Party sent about
a thousand of its members to church.
   The Communists intended to fill most of the 2,000 seats hours
before the service began.
   Again, the tactic backfired. Fuehrer hurriedly asked two other
churches to open for prayer, then went ahead and held his own
regular session.
   What Fuehrer calls the next ``miracle'' of that day occurred
during the service. A message arrived from three Communist
functionaries and Kurt Mazur, conductor of Leipzig's famed
Gewandhaus orchestra, saying they supported peaceful demostrations.
   This encouraged the congregation to join a crowd of tens of
thousands outside in a peaceful march, despite a strong presence of
police and special anti-riot forces.
   ``You had the impression that a world war, or at the very least
a civil war, was on its way,'' Fuehrer said of the security forces.
``But in the end there was no violence,'' and East Germany's
peaceful revolution was born.
   Now, hundreds of thousands of people seeking free elections
march through Leipzig's streets every Monday after the ``peace
prayers.''
   ``Without the church, the demonstrations would not have been
possible,'' Fuehrer noted. ``But we didn't organize them. I never
imagined, of course, where the peace prayers might lead.''

<HEAD>Bush Consults Western Leaders About US-Soviet Summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, steering clear of the
controversial subject of German reunification, is making a
concerted show of consulting with Western leaders before his
shipboard summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The White House issued a statement Friday saying Bush had called
French President Francois Mitterrand and Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney on Friday, and had received a call from West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Another statement was issued later to report Bush had called
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and to say they will
continue their talks when they meet next Friday at Camp David, the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
   The leaders talked about the meeting this weekend of European
leaders on the fast-moving developments in Eastern Europe and
Bush's summit with Gorbachev Dec. 2 and 3 on ships off the coast of
Malta, the White House said.
   The calls seemed designed to ease European concerns that Bush
was going to meet Gorbachev without the benefit of advice from NATO
allies.
   Preparing for the summit, Bush was to meet at Camp David today
with two groups of academic and think-tank experts on Soviet
politics and East-West relations.
   Bush also held a round of pre-summit talks Friday, meeting at
the White House with four former U.S. ambassadors to the Soviet
Union: George Kennan, Malcolm Toon, Thomas Watson and Arthur
Hartman.
   In a radio interview aired today by Mutual and NBC, Bush brushed
aside fears about the possibility of German reunification, saying,
``I don't think history need repeat itself if there evolves a
single German state.''
   Bush said reunification is ``a matter for the people of the
Germanies to determine. And it is a very _ it's a highly sensitive
matter as far as the Soviet Union is concerned. And it's better to
leave it right there.''
   The opening of the Berlin Wall has prompted talk about a
reunified Germany, which has been divided into East and West since
the end of World War II. Gorbachev has said that talk about
reunification would mean interference in the affairs of the two
Germanies.
   Moreover, there is nervousness in Western Europe about restoring
Germany to full strength, since a militarily strong Germany was at
the center of two world wars in Europe this century.
   In another development, Bush sent a cable to Gorbachev
expressing hopes for ``a calm and peaceful period of change'' in
Eastern Europe.
   Bush, responding to a virtually identical message from Gorbachev
a week earlier, indicated his support for the dramatic changes in
Eastern Europe and reforms under way in the Soviet Union, said
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   A senior administration official said Bush would not agree at
the summit to look the other way in case the Kremlin deems it
necessary to crack down against labor unrest and citizens'
unhappiness over expected food shortages this winter.
   ``This American president, like his predecessors, will have no
understanding for the violent suppression of man's desire for
freedom, period,'' the official said, insisting on anonymity.
   The State Department, meanwhile, welcomed recent political
changes in East Germany and Bulgaria.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the formation of a
new Cabinet containing 11 non-communist members ``could be a first
step'' toward meeting the East German people's demands for
democratic reform. She said those demands could not be met fully
without free elections.
   Ms. Tutwiler also applauded the dismissal Thursday of three
hardline Politburo members in Bulgaria and the installation of four
officials who are likely to support new Communist Party leader
Peter Mladenov. She called it ``an encouraging sign'' that Mladenov
has ``the will and the ability to carry out needed reforms.''

<HEAD>Cable TV Has `Unrestricted Monopoly,' Broadcasters Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television companies enjoy an
``unrestricted monopoly'' that lets them overcharge customers and
seize control of sports programs, broadcast competitors contend.
   The criticism came Friday from independent and network
broadcasters at a hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation's communications subcommittee on the regulation of
the cable TV industry.
   The broadcasters say cable television operators pay nothing for
72 percent of the programming viewed by their customers because it
is supplied by networks and independent stations.
   At the same time, the broadcasters contend, the cable industry
programmers favorably treat the local cable outlets while charging
excessive rates to others.
   Five companies serve 42 percent of cable households in the
country and rates rose 29 percent in the first two years of
deregulation starting in 1987, according to the critics.
   In addition, they say, the same companies that produce cable
programs also have the cable systems, giving them control of
``conduit and content.''
   ``Cable's unrestricted monopoly operations _ its nearly free use
of the compulsory license, and its use of a triple revenue stream
of subscription rates, advertising and pay-per-view _ has led to a
completely distorted marketplace,'' said Edward O. Fritts of the
National Association of Broadcasters, which represents the networks.
   The cable industry disputed those contentions, saying rates
jumped after being kept artificially low by local regulation. It
said rates are now rising at a lower rate than inflation.
   The industry, through the National Cable Television Association,
also claims that cable helps networks by extending their reach and
improving their signals. The cable industry also says it has
increased the amount of sports programming available and blames the
team owners for jacking up the bids.
   Fritts' group supports legislation proposed by Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo., that would re-regulate the cable industry, which
was basically de-regulated by the 1984 Cable Act.
   Danforth's bill would allow cities to regulate cable rates
unless cable companies had effective local competition and would
make it easier for cities to revoke the franchises of cable
operators who do not serve the community well.
   Preston R. Padden, president of the Association of Independent
Television Stations, claimed that cable is monopolizing sports
television. He showed the subcommittee a Los Angeles billboard
warning, ``No Cable, No Gretzky, No Cable, No Magic,'' a reference
to stars Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and
Magic Johnson of the Lakers basketball team.
   He also complained that such sports siphoning was occurring in
college conference sports.
   Lynn McReynolds, a spokeswoman for the cable industry group,
acknowledged that there have been ``a few instances'' where sports
events have been moved to cable.

   Peace talks between the Nicaraguan government
and the Contra rebels resume on Monday with the two sides at an
apparent impasse over terms for reviving a cease-fire.
   During the seventh day of discussions on Friday, the Sandinista
government remained adamant in its insistence on a full withdrawal
of Contra forces from Nicaragua to base camps in Honduras.
   For its part, the Nicaraguan resistance stood firm in refusing
to consider even a partial withdrawal of the estimated 5,000
Contras deployed in Nicaragua.
   United Nations and Organization of American States mediators
were spending the weekend drafting a revised working document for
presentation to the negotiators when they resume their discussions
here on Monday at the OAS.
   President Daniel Ortega suspended the cease-fire on Nov. 1,
citing what he described as Contra terrorist activities. He has
said the Feb. 25 national elections will go ahead as planned even
if no truce agreement is reached.
   After a two-hour negotiating session Friday, Sandinista Vice
Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco warned that a cease-fire in
place, as proposed by the Contras, would create in Nicaragua a
situation similar to that in El Salvador where truces have never
taken hold.
   ``We consider that an effective cease-fire in Nicaragua means a
separation of forces, and a separation of forces means all the
Contras to withdraw with their arms to their camps in Honduras,''
Tinoco said. ``Otherwise, there will be no cease-fire.''
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said such a retreat would leave
the rebels at a disadvantage.
   ``Once our forces have withdrawn from certain areas, the
government forces have taken advantage to move there in force,
deploy huge amounts of weapons, huge amounts of forces, to repress
our civilian supporters,'' he said.
   After two days of talks at the United Nations and five more
here, Matamoros said there are ``substantial differences'' but
noted that both sides are willing to continue the negotiations.
   Tinoco also ruled out the possibility of reaching a compromise
by allowing the Contras to redeploy in designated enclaves inside
Nicaragua, subject to international inspection.
   He said the Nicaraguan terrain doesn't lend itself to such a
solution because much of the country is heavily wooded and the
rebels would have the ability to move in and out of the enclaves
undetected.
   The enclave concept, he said, ``has never functioned in human
history.''
   OAS mediator Hugo De Zela of Peru resorted to understatement in
characterizing the status of the talks.
   He said there are ``some discrepancies'' between the two sides.
But, he added, ``the fact that we are continuing signifies
progress.''

<HEAD>U.N. Report Says Torture, Political Repression Rising in El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. report says El Salvador's
government presided over a ``resurgence of torture'' this year that
included sexual abuse and beatings of prisoners and summary
executions of political opponents.
   The annual report was released Friday, a day after eight people,
six of them Jesuit priests, were slain in San Salvador.
   Jose Antonio Pastor Ridruejo, special representative of the U.N.
Human Rights Committee, said in the report he ``is again extremely
disturbed by the number and seriousness of the human rights
violations committed thus far in 1989, particularly by the
resurgence of torture.
   ``Members of the state apparatus, particularly of the armed
forces, have carried out politically motivated summary executions
whose exact numbers cannot be determined but are generally
comparable to those for last year.''
   Pastor also castigated leftist rebels for kidnappings and
assassinations.
   President Alfredo Cristiani, who took office June 1, said his
rightist government was not involved in the Jesuit slayings, which
took place amid the biggest rebel offensive in the 10-year-old war.
   The killings fit a pattern of rising repression, torture and
political violence perpetrated by uniformed soldiers, as documented
in Pastor's report.
   The Roman Catholic church's Archdiocesan Legal Protection office
said 50 people were killed through August, and the government's
Salvadoran Human Rights Commission said 68 people have been killed.
   However, hundreds of others have been slain by unidentified
assassins, or have disappeared.
   About 250 people were detained for political offenses as of Oct.
14, Pastor said, ``a much higher figure than the previous year.''
   Non-governmental organizations that contacted Pastor in El
Salvador during his visit Oct. 8-14 ``complained about a marked
increase in the torture of political prisoners by their
interrogators,'' he said.
   ``Witnesses belonging to organizations invariably made roughly
the same statement:
   Long periods of interrogation while blindfolded and without
being able to sit down or rest, extensive beatings, continuous use
of a hood which impedes breathing and causes fainting, electric
shocks in water tanks, use of drugs and acids, and on many
occasions rape and sexual abuse of both women and men, as well as
threat to family members,'' Pastor said.
   ``Witnesses who did not belong to organizations complained of
psychological ill-treatment and sometimes of beatings and death
threats to themselves or to members of their families,'' he said.
   The government told him detainees were blindfolded to prevent
them from recognizing their interrogators but denied there was
systematic use of torture.
   Salvadoran authorities said the claims of torture were
``orchestrated'' by the rebels of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Movement.
   Pastor found that ``thus far in 1989, government action against
trade unions and peasant and other organizations has increased. The
government claims that some of these organizations answer to FMLN.
   ``The organizations concerned deny this, although independent
Salvadoran sources have indicated ... that in some cases ... the
activities of some organizations are not entirely independent of
FMLN,'' he said.
   Pastor blamed the rebels for assassinating alleged collaborators
with the armed forces, soldiers, officials and ideological
opponents.
   He said individuals have been abducted by the guerrillas, and
probably by government-sanctioned death squads, and are still
missing.
   El Salvador only recently emerged from a period of repression
during which death squads and rightist elements of the military
were accused of killing thousands of people. The Salvadoran right
considers church activists and church intellectuals to be
subversives.

<HEAD>22-Month Extension of Civil Rights Panel En Route to Bush's Desk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation extending the life of the troubled
U.S. Civil Rights Commission for almost two years is headed for
President Bush's desk after winning final approval from the House.
   ``They're on probation over there for the next 22 months,'' Rep.
Don Edwards, D-Calif., said Friday as the House approved the
measure, 389-0.
   The measure, a compromise reached Thursday night between the
Senate and the White House, would prevent the commission from going
out of business on Nov. 30 when its charter runs out.
   The Bush administration had sought to put the panel out of
business for one day only _ allowing Bush to dump the members and
engage in what Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., called ``a
complete housecleaning.''
   The commission then would have been reauthorized for six years.
   A Democratic version passed by the House on Wednesday would have
kept the commission in business for only six more months, buying
time for an overhaul by Congress designed to end the panel's
infighting and other problems.
   The compromise provides for no housecleaning, but Bush will have
a chance to appoint two new commissioners, including the chairman,
and a staff director by the end of the year.
   Sensenbrenner noted, however, that the rest of the panel would
remain intact, ``including two commissioners who have been at the
center of the personality disputes that have dragged the commission
into disrepute.''
   He did not specify which commissioners he had in mind, although
former Chairman William B. Allen, still a member of the panel, has
been under fire for delivering before a conservative group a speech
titled: ``Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What is a Minority?''
   Allen, who is black, says that he is the only conservative on
the commission and that he does not believe ``in coddling people.''
   At a recent House Judiciary Committee meeting, Sensenbrenner
complained that commission member Mary Frances Berry has been
making ``bizarre'' remarks.
   In the 1960s, the commission was lauded by civil rights forces
for its hearings across the South, its ringing reports on racial
injustice and its bold legislative proposals. Over the last six
years, however, that atmosphere on the panel has soured, according
to lawmakers of both parties.
   A report from the General Accounting Office in 1986 found
political, financial and other problems on the panel but they
``have never been addressed by the commission,'' Edwards told the
House.
   A statement issued Friday by the office of Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., said the commission had been ``mired in controversy for
much of the last nine years, leading many in Congress to question
whether it should be kept alive when its charter expires.''
   ``This is a new lease on life for the commission, and I hope
it's put to good use,'' Simon said. ``It's a long enough lease to
give the president the chance he deserves to steer a new course for
the commission, and it's a short enough lease to give Congress a
chance to take another look later.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solar Maximum satellite, with most of its
instruments shut down, is expected to fall to Earth by the end of
the month.
   The satellite, which has been sending back information about the
sun for nearly 10 years, was repaired by a visiting space shuttle
crew in 1984. But now it has run out of fuel to power the rockets
that have kept it out of the grip of Earth's atmosphere.
   ``They are projecting Nov. 29, give or take a few days,'' said
Randee Exler, spokeswoman for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.
   A few weeks ago, NASA said three big chunks of the satellite
might survive the fiery trip through the atmosphere and crash to
Earth. But Ms. Exler said there are estimates that as many as 11
pieces might survive.
   ``There will be debris, but we feel confident that most will be
small pieces,'' she said. The satellite's path is 70 percent over
water.
   Solar Max flies over much of South America, Africa, India,
Australia and the southernmost tip of China. The only portions of
the United States under its track are South Florida, the extreme
southern part of Texas and Hawaii.
   For weeks, the satellite's altitude has been dropping steadily.
On Friday, Solar Max's orbit was 177 miles high, a 25.7 mile drop
since Oct. 31. It fell 2.6 miles since Thursday.
   Engineers turned off fine-pointing instruments and the
spacecraft went into a ``safe hold.'' Scientific operations didn't
cease completely; three instruments still were taking and sending
data.
   Even at the end, the satellite will perform useful service.
Engineers will try to blow off its solar panels, an exercise that
would be required if such a satellite were to be put into a space
shuttle cargo bay for return to Earth.
   Once the panels are gone, all work will cease.
   Solar Max cost $77 million to build and launch in February 1980,
at a time of maximum activity in the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.
Its mission was to study solar flares.
   But after 10 months of service, three fuses blew in the
satellite's attitude control box and it was unable to point itself
accurately. That, in turn, caused four onboard instruments to fail.
   In 1984, the shuttle Challenger pulled alongside Solar Max and
astronaut Terry Hart reached out and grabbed it with the ship's
robot arm. The next day, two astronauts working in the open cargo
bay replaced the control system module and an electronics box.
   The satellite has been working well since then. For a time there
were plans to reboost it to a higher orbit but that would have set
back other missions and the idea was abandoned.

   Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa went
through a whirlwind series of meetings Friday with union officials,
Jewish leaders, politicians and businessmen, and paused to praise
American generosity.
   He told a group of state union leaders that as he was listening
to speeches that preceded his own, he came to appreciate what he
termed ``the greatness of America.''
   In Poland, he said, ``We fight, we risk, but you are in a
different situation. You don't have to fight, you don't have to
share with us, you don't have to help us.
   ``But this is not the way you behave. I thought, `Would I behave
as you do? Would I be seeing this as clearly?'''
   The Senate voted Tuesday to authorize $657 million in economic
aid to Poland over three years. On Thursday the House went further,
approving a three-year package of $846.5 million.
   After a full day of meetings in New York, Walesa flew to Chicago
late Friday, arriving at Midway Airport at 11 p.m. CST. A crowd of
about 100 people, many of them Polish-Americans who painted signs
of welcome, applauded as he stepped of a plane into blowing snow
and ice-cold temperatures.
   Walesa's meeting with New York state labor leaders began a day
that included other sessions with Jewish leaders, newspaper editors
and businessmen.
   Walesa also met Friday with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who said:
``We hardly know the man. ... But we cheer him for all the
wonderful ideas he represents.''
   Cuomo announced plans by Harper &amp; Row to publish a collection of
Abraham Lincoln's speeches and writings on democracy in Polish and
English next year.
   Cuomo said he conceived of the ``Lincoln on Democracy Project''
during a meeting in June with teachers from Poland who told him
books on Lincoln were not available in their country.
   Walesa thanked Cuomo for the Lincoln project and alluded to the
speed of political change throughout Eastern Europe: ``I don't know
if you can keep pace with translations for other languages because
the line is already forming.''
   Walesa met with about 75 Jewish leaders, several of them
survivors of the Nazi campaign to exterminate Polish Jews. One,
Reuben Gruenbaum, told Walesa of life at Auschwitz, where he was an
inmate and where his parents and grandparents were killed.
   Walesa said he hoped for resolution of a controversy over the
location of a Roman Catholic convent on the site of the death camp.
He also promised to protect the vestiges of Jewish life in Poland.
Although the nation had a Jewish population of over 3 million in
1939, only a few thousand remain today.
   Walesa received numerous gifts, which he accepted with good
humor. After he was given a set of knives, he said in mock protest:
``I'm all for nonviolent struggle. I will not use these against
anybody.'' Presented with a bust of Lincoln, he balanced it on his
head for photographers.
   He expressed regret over his inability to meet more people,
especially Polish-Americans.
   ``I would like to reach every American home, to visit every
American home,'' Walesa said. ``I would like to drink a cup of
coffee with every American girl, but time is short.''
   Walesa did manage to spend a quick 40 minutes among Poles during
a meeting with the editorial staff of the Polish Daily News, the
largest Polish daily newspaper outside Poland. He begged for some
plain talk, Pole-to-Pole.
   ``How did you feel in Congress?'' a tired-looking Walesa was
asked.
   ``Oh, my God,'' he said to a chorus of laughs. ``I have a
complex, standing next to all those greats.''
   ``But you too are great,'' offered Boleslaw Wierzbianski, the
paper's publisher.
   In the evening Walesa met more than 100 business executives at
the Forbes Gallery, repository of publisher Malcolm Forbes'
eclectic collection of artifacts, memorabilia and oddities.
   The former shipyard worker seemed most impressed by the blunt
letter President Harry Truman mailed in 1950 to a critic who had
unfavorably reviewed his daughter Margaret's singing.
   Walesa chortled as his translator read him Truman's hand-written
note. ``Someday I hope to meet you,'' Truman wrote. ``You'll need a
new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes and perhaps a supporter
below!''
   Walesa concluded his visit to the gallery with yet another
impassioned plea for investment in Poland, asking the executives:
``Can we work together in business?''
   On Thursday night, Walesa accepted an award from the
International Rescue Committee, a non-sectarian, voluntary agency
that assists refugees fleeing political, religious or racial
persecution. Past recipients included Winston Churchill, George
Meany, Hubert Humphrey and Elie Wiesel.

   Democratic senators are threatening to slash
U.S. aid to El Salvador unless President Alfredo Cristiani can end
violence in the war-torn Central American nation.
   As an American-trained team of Salvadoran forensic experts began
an investigation of the slayings of six Jesuit priests and two
others, leftist protesters disrupted a Capitol Hill hearing,
demanding a halt to U.S. aid to Cristiani's government.
   During Friday's rancorous hearing, Sen. Christopher Dodd
declared: ``The time has come for President Cristiani to evidence
his commitment to controlling those officials within his own
government and within his own party who are in very large part
responsible for the civil conflict.''
   ``President Cristiani is either in control, or he is not ...
President Cristiani either deserves our support, or he does not,''
said Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of a Foreign Relations subcommittee on
the western hemisphere.
   Said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.: ``In an era of scarce foreign
assistance, we need to be asking what we are achieving for the
dollars sent.''
   In a statement late Friday, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
called for a return to negotiations and for an investigation of the
killings.
   ``This outrage must be investigated thoroughly, those
responsible apprehended and promptly brought to justice,'' they
said. ``Any other result would be unacceptable to the community of
nations, and in particular to the American people.''
   Bernard Aronson, the State Department's senior official for
Latin American policy, agreed that without improvements, ``the
policy won't go on.'' But he blamed the current conflict and human
rights abuses that have accompanied it on rebel provocations.
   ``Implicit in our support is a demand that they make real
progress in human rights,'' he said. ``Things have to change in
Salvador.''
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which has been
fighting El Salvador's government in a bloody civil war for the
past decade, has undertaken assassinations designed to lure
right-wing death squads ``out of the closet,'' Aronson said.
   ``Their strategy is to polarize'' the country and cripple the
new government of Cristiani, the rightist president, Aronson said.
   And he said the purpose of the current FMLN offensive in the
capital of San Salvador has been not to strengthen the rebels'
negotiating position, as the FMLN contends, but ``to take total
power.''
   ``Had they succeeded ... another ally of Cuba and Nicaragua,
holding power with Soviet bloc weaponry, would have been firmly
entrenched in Central America,'' Aronson said.
   He said the murders early Thursday likely were the work of
violent right-wing death squads blamed for most of the 70,000
deaths that have occurred during the country's civil war. But
Aronson cautioned against leaping to conclusions before the outcome
of the U.S.-supported criminal investigation.
   ``We want this crime investigated fully, swiftly and those
responsible punished with the full force of the law,'' he said.
``Promises will not satisfy the high standards that President
Cristiani proclaimed in his inaugural address, they will not
satisfy the Salvadoran people and they will not satisfy the United
States.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler noted that
Cristiani had assured U.S. Ambassador William Walker that even if
members of the Salvadoran armed forces were involved, ``they will
feel the full weight of the law.''
   ``The United States expects him to meet that commitment,'' she
said.
   In another development, a U.S. general who drafted a classified
military strategy for El Salvador said the guerrillas cannot be
defeated on the battlefield, and said the war drags on because of
corruption within the U.S.-backed government.
   Gen. Fred Woerner, who until recently headed the U.S. Southern
Command in Panama, also said the murder of six Roman Catholic
priests most likely was the work of the radical right wing acting
without the support or tacit consent of the conservative government.

<HEAD>Recommended Gun-Control Program Hugely Expensive, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A program of instant background checks for
gun-buyers _ intended to prevent sales to convicted felons _ would
be so expensive the Justice Department isn't expected to recommend
immediate implementation, congressional sources say.
   Such instant background checks could cost up to $27 billion to
begin, sources said Friday.
   The Justice Department recommendation, due to be released
Monday, suggests such a program but does not call for immediate
implementation ``because of lack of funds and lack of
computerization'' of all the criminal records, one source said.
   The computerization of complete information, including final
dispensation of charges that often are not included in law
enforcement computer systems now used, ``will cost tens of millions
of dollars and will delay this for several years,'' said that
source, who said he was informed of the report by Justice
Department officials.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel declined to comment on
the report's contents, saying, ``It's still in the process of being
reviewed. Until the review's been completed, there's no final
decision.''
   The report was required by an Anti-Drug Abuse Act amendment that
had been approved as an alternative to another measure that would
have required a seven-day waiting period _ while authorities
conducted background checks if they wished _ before a person could
buy a gun.
   The Justice Department was required to provide a report to
Congress by Nov. 18 on its recommendations for preventing sales of
guns to felons. Implementation was to begin Dec. 1.
   Rep. Edward Feighan, D-Ohio, who introduced the waiting-period
measure _ dubbed the ``Brady amendment'' in reference to former
presidential press secretary James Brady who was wounded by an
assailant trying to shoot then-President Reagan _ said Friday,
``The report is a compelling argument for immediate enactment of
the Brady Bill.''
   ``The report acknowledges that a point-of-sale check will be
enormously expensive and cannot be implemented in the relatively
near future,'' he said. ``I appreciate the attorney general's
effort, but I am bitterly disappointed that we have lost a year's
time in saving the lives of Americans.''
   Selecting the option of instantaneous checks at the point of
sale would be a move toward one of the most expensive undertakings
possible at a time when the federal government is strapped for
funds, he said.
   Start-up costs for an immediate, live scan of fingerprints by
gun dealers would be $9.6 billion to $27 billion, according to the
report by the Task Force on Felon Identification in Firearm Sales
published in the Federal Register on Oct. 25.
   Also being recommended, according to the sources, are
point-of-sale telephone checks by gun dealers to authorities with
access to computerized information and similar telephone checks to
an intermediate computer with the same access to information.
   Those would have start-up costs of $36 million to $44 million,
according to the task force.
   Runkel said in June that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had
rejected another option _ the issuance of firearm owner's
identification cards following background checks _ that would have
had start-up costs of $148 million to $153 million.
   These costs do not include the original computerization of
information, which the task force said will involve ``substantial
resources.'' It did not give a precise figure.
   Gwen Fitzgerald of Handgun Control Inc. criticized the
recommendations because they call for no immediate action.
   ``This removes every obstacle for not passing the Brady Bill as
soon as possible,'' Fitzgerald said. ``Last September, during the
vote on the Brady amendment, and for an entire year, Congress
didn't have to deal with this because they had the McCollum
Amendment (the one enacted) to hide behind. They were waiting for
this announcement.''
   ``It's now clear that nothing is going to happen anytime soon
under this directive, which means that convicted felons are still
buying guns over the counter in 28 states,'' she said, adding that
the rest of the states have some kind of background check or
waiting period before an individual can buy a gun.
   The McCollum Amendment is named for Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.

   A 40-year-old musician interrupted the
planning for his own memorial service by calling from Denmark to
ask if he could come home, a newspaper reported.
   Morten Berntsen disappeared six months ago and the evidence
indicated that he jumped to his death from a bridge, the newspaper
Verdens Gang said Friday.
   The jazz musician was unaware that a memorial sevice was being
planned for Friday when he called last weekend and asked a shocked
friend to come get him in Denmark, said the report.
   The paper said Berntsen apparently had been under a lot of
stress due to financial problems and recalled little about the six
months he was gone.

<TEXT>
   The federal government is calling for a
voluntary nationwide recall of L-tryptophan, a dietary supplement
linked to a potentially fatal rare blood disorder.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday its offices around
the country will start contacting manufacturers on Monday and ask
them to recall their products.
   A week ago, the FDA issued a warning telling consumers to stop
using the supplement.
   At least 287 potential cases of the rare disorder,
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, have been reported in 37 states and
the District of Columbia. At least one death is believed to have
been caused by taking L-tryptophan, according to the Centers for
Disease Control.
   The New York state Health Department on Friday banned the
distribution of L-tryptophan. Department spokeswoman Vicki Zeldin
said, ``The ban is effective immediately. All of the products
should be off the shelves this weekend.''
   Two trade associations earlier this week encouraged
manufacturers to pull the product off retail shelves.
   An FDA statement announcing the recall effort said there is a
``strong, virtually unequivocal link between consumption of
L-tryptophan tablets or capsules and the syndrome.''
   However, the FDA said scientists investigating L-tryptophan do
not know why this is happening.
   Symptoms of the disorder include an abnormally high number of
white blood cells, called eosinophils, along with severe muscle
pain.
   The agency said the condition posed a ``moderate to severe and
perhaps life-threatening hazard to certain individuals.''
   L-tryptophan is used by some people for insomnia, depression,
premenstrual syndrome or appetite control.
   The FDA said all cases involved people who took tablets,
capsules or caplets in which L-tryptophan was the main ingredient.
No cases have been reported among people who consumed diet
supplements in which it was a minor ingredient.
   Jeff Nesbitt, a spokesman for the FDA, said the agency decided
to take the action because of the ``preponderance of the
epidemiological evidence that has been obtained this week.''
   Nesbitt said the recall action is voluntary but the FDA believes
it has the evidence to obtain a court order if needed to remove the
product from the shelves.

<HEAD>Senate Passes CIA Inspector General Bill</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: TOP 2 grafs new with Senate passage; picks up 3rd graf pvs,

<TEXT>
   The Senate early Saturday gave final
congressional approval to legislation that would create an
independent inspector general to monitor the Central Intellingence
Agency, answerable to Congress as well as the CIA director.
   The provision was in a compromise bill authorizing the
government's intelligence activities for the coming year. Both the
House and Senate passed the legislation by voice vote.
   While President Bush, a former CIA director, is said to object
to establishing a tighter oversight office within the agency,
members of the congressional intelligence committees have said they
do not believe he will veto the measure because of the new
requirement.
   In addition to setting up a new inspector general, appointed by
the president and confirmed by the Senate, the bill would guarantee
the congressional oversight committees access in most cases to the
IG's audit and investigation reports.
   CIA Director William Webster has fought the committees over that
access in the past, and some Republicans complained that Webster
had mishandled the matter.
   ``CIA recalcitrance was its own undoing,'' said Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., during House floor debate on the measure.
   The new oversight provisions grew out of the Iran-Contra
scandal, when the nation's intelligence apparatus skirted the law
to sell arms to Iran and send money to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels
despite bans on such activity.
   But the bill omitted a series of other steps that grew out of
the Iran-Contra affair, including codification of requirements that
covert operations be brought to the attention of the intelligence
committees promptly and in written form, and that any third parties
involved be disclosed.
   Those provisions were dropped because the House committee wants
to try again next year to negotiate stricter controls with the
administration, and to write anything into the law now would
pre-empt such discussions, said committee chairman Rep. Anthony C.
Beilenson, D-Calif.
   The new inspector general position would be like other
government agency IGs who conduct audits, review the way programs
are run and generally try to ferret out abuses, fraud or waste in
federal programs.
   Congressional investigators who probed the Iran-Contra scandal
said the CIA inspector general lacked independence and didn't have
``the manpower, resources or tenacity'' to uncover
arms-for-hostages transactions or the diversion of profits to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   Currently, the inspector general is appointed by the CIA
director and reports only to him.
   Opponents of the change, including the White House, had argued
that it would create an impression that the CIA would be unable to
protect sensitive information, particularly about intelligence
sources and methods, and valuable information might dry up.
   Money to carry out the government's intelligence operations is
hidden in the Pentagon budget and is secret, but reports put the
overall spending level at upwards of $25 billion.
   Sources said the bill keeps on track a five-year,
multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the nation's intelligence
collection through so-called ``national technical means,'' or
satellites and other electronic spying.
   Impetus for the buildup began with U.S. ratification of the
intermediate-range nuclear arms control treaty with the Soviet
Union, which brought new requirements for verification.
   It has been given additional urgency by developments in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe that enhance the prospects for new
strategic and conventional arms control treaties with the Soviets
in the coming months.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee investigation of
five senators is gathering steam with the hiring of a prominent
lawyer, who will gather evidence to help the panel decide its next
move.
   Robert S. Bennett of Washington, D.C., was retained Friday to
``assist in obtaining and analyzing additional information'' on the
five senators who met with federal regulators on behalf of the
failing Lincoln Savings and Loan _ after receiving campaign
contributions from the head of the thrift.
   The committee said Bennett also will work on the case of Sen.
Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., accused in a complaint by a former
election opponent of violating rules in the federal housing scandal
and other matters.
   Committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Vice Chairman
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said Bennett will ``assist the committee in
determining whether to proceed to a preliminary inquiry'' in both
matters.
   The preliminary proceeding is the first of three stages of a
formal committee investigation, and Rudman said it could take
several months to decide whether this stage will be approved.
   The hiring of Bennett ``does not suggest in any way that the
committee has found any indication of wrongdoing, or that a
violation of any rule or law has occurred,'' the two senators said
in a statement.
   All five in the savings and loan case have denied wrongdoing:
Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John
Glenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz., and Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich. So has D'Amato.
   After the announcement, Glenn said it ``was expected,'' and
D'Amato commented, ``Sure, let them do it. I'm not concerned.''
Cranston said the outside counsel was ``not necessary'' but pledged
his ``utmost cooperation.'' ``I am confident the outside counsel
will concur with our view that my conduct was entirely proper,''
Cranston added.
   The five senators who met with regulators did so while banking
investigators were examining the collapsing Irvine, Calif., savings
institution in 1987. The chairman of the thrift, Charles H. Keating
Jr., gave $1.3 million to the senators' campaigns or their
political causes in the mid-1980s.
   Riegle, DeConcini and Glenn also issued fresh declarations of
innocence during the day.
   The five men are among the most powerful in the Senate _ with
Cranston the No. 2 Democrat and Riegle and Glenn holding committee
chairmanships.
   Glenn told reporters he never discussed any deals for Keating
when participating in discussions with the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board about Lincoln.
   ``I do not recall that there was any deal whatsoever that was
ever made. I was not party to any deal, did not agree to any
deal,'' said Glenn, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
   DeConcini said, ```I'm prepared and we'll cooperate with the
independent counsel. If that's the decision of the committee, it
would be very positive to bring out all the facts related to the
... charge.
   ``I hope the independent counsel will expedite it, or rapidly
bring it to conclusion,'' DeConcini said.
   Riegle, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, commented, ``I
strongly support whatever level of inquiry the Senate Ethics
Committee feels is appropriate. Their review will show my conduct
in this matter to have been ethical and proper at all times.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate late Friday got cold feet and
backed away from a congressional pay raise of more than $30,000 _
passing instead an increase of only $8,900 for itself.
   The House, which would still get the bigger pay boost, then
shipped the bill approved by voice vote early today to President
Bush for his expected signature.
   The Senate approved its plan 56-43 only hours after it seemed to
be ready to accept the House-passed package. The Senate left in
place the raises of more than 35 percent for the House, federal
judges and top government executives.
   ``I believe it to be an unwise decision for the Senate,'' said
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, not o adopt the
full pay raise and accompanying ban on speech honoraria in the
House plan.
   When it became apparent he didn't have the votes, Mitchell
proposed, as a fallback, that the Senate take a raise of only 9.9
percent, or about $8,900, for itself, billed as a cost-of-living
adjustment. Both chambers now make $89,500 a year.
   With the smaller raise, the House bill's key ethics provision _
elimination of speech honoraria in 1991 _ would take place more
slowly for the Senate.
   The Senate decision would mean different salaries for the Senate
and House, with the Senate earning more at first and the House
passing it later.
   That would be unusual but not unprecedented. From Dec. 21, 1982
to July 1, 1983, the Senate was paid $60,662 and the House $69,800.
   The final Senate action came only short while after the Senate,
by a vote of 65-34, had killed a move by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
strip the pay raise provisions from the bill as passed by the House.
   The House approved a bill Thursday under which congressional pay
should soar from the current $89,500 to at least $120,800 and
probably closer to $125,000 by Jan. 1, 1991. An initial
cost-of-living raise of only 7.9 percent was in that version.
   Mitchell and Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas argued through
the day for the Senate to take the full raise.
   ``If the voters in our states look at what we do, if we work
hard, have a complete disclosure of our assets, our speaking fees,
then they can make the final judgment,'' Dole said.
   ``The need for Congress to come to grips with the ethics issue
is evident. Public opinion demands it,'' said Mitchell.
   Helms argued that the bill was being ``rammed through.'' The
public won't accept the argument that ethics can be reformed only
if members get more pay, he said.
   ``Mr. Joe Lunchbucket is going to stand there and thumb his nose
at any congressman who says that,'' he said.
   Even as they were announcing their intentions on Friday
afternoon to follow the House example, Senate leaders were still
drafting their version of the legislation.
   With President Bush's support, the House voted 252-174 on
Thursday to raise its pay and that of other top government
officials for the first time since early 1987.
   Their pay would increase at least 35 percent in less than 14
months. If rank-and-file civil servants receive a cost-of-living
adjustment for fiscal 1991, as they usually do, that would be added
and the total raise would be more like 40 percent.
   With the higher pay, lawmakers would be barred, beginning in
1991, from earning extra income by making speeches before interest
groups. Other outside earned income generally would be limited to
15 percent of their salaries and public disclosure would be
increased.
   The Senate amended the ethics portion of the House plan to
restrict post-employment lobbying by lawmakers and the president's
top aides.
   No lobbying anywhere in the legislative branch would be allowed
for one year. Cabinet-level officials at the White House would also
face a similar ban on lobbying in their branch of government,
according to the provisions drafted by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
and Warren Rudman, R-N.H.
   Dole said the ``revolving door'' provision was especially
important, and that senators should accept the plan even though the
ban on speech fees would for many make a cut in their income.
Senators are now allowed to add to their earnings by 40 percent
with speaking fees.
   ``This isn't really a pay raise. ... It's sort of a transfer,''
he said. ``Instead of coming from the private sector, from
honoraria, it's going to be coming from the Treasury.''
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., a leader of the successful fight
against a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise early this
year, said eliminating the ``tawdry'' system of interest-group
honoraria won his support for the new plan.
   In addition to banning honoraria, the legislation would put new
restrictions on gifts and free travel lawmakers can accept from
people outside of family.
   The legislation also would end in 1993 the ability of House
members elected before 1980 to, upon retirement, transfer for
personal use the balance of their campaign treasuries.

   A $31,000-plus pay raise for the House _ but
only $8,900 for the Senate _ is on its way to President Bush's desk
after careening through Congress in just two days.
   The Senate voted 56-43 Friday night to approve the bill, but
only after deciding at the last minute that it couldn't take the
poltical risk of the bigger House-passed pay raise. Instead,
senators would keep taking honoraria from interest groups, a
much-criticized practice eliminated by the House.
   ``We have done exactly the wrong thing tonight. We have
failed,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo.
   But the Senate didn't cut back the raise that applies to the
House, federal judges and top government executives, and the House
early today gave the measure final approval and shipped the package
to the president. The House gave its approval in a voice vote at
nearly 1:30 a.m. with whistling and cheers in the chamber.
   Bush has said he would sign the bill, which includes a series of
reforms of congressional and government-wide ethics rules.
   For the House and the other top officials, salaries would rise
from the current $89,500 to $96,600 by Jan. 1 and to at least
$120,800 and probably closer to $125,000 a year later, depending on
government-wide cost of living adjustments at that time.
   In 1991, when a 25 percent pay boost making up the bulk of the
increase takes effect, the practice of House members accepting
speaking fees for appearances before interest groups will end and
Congress' other outside earnings will be limited.
   The Senate opted for taking a 9.9 percent raise on Jan. 1 to
$98,400, and gradually reducing the amount of honoraria its members
can keep. Currently, they can keep speaking fees up to 40 percent
of their salaries.
   The Senate decision meant different salary scales for the Senate
and House, with the Senate earning more at first and the House
passing it later.
   That would be unusual but not unprecedented. From Dec. 21, 1982,
to July 1, 1983, the Senate was paid $60,662 and the House $69,800.
   Besides the pay-honoraria issue, the legislation contains a
broad range of changes in ethics rules.
   No lobbying anywhere in the legislative branch would be allowed
for one year. Cabinet-level officials at the White House also would
face a similar ban on lobbying in their branch of government.
   In addition to banning honoraria, the legislation would put new
restrictions on gifts and free travel lawmakers and other
government officials can accept from people outside their immediate
family.
   The legislation also would end in 1993 the ability of House
members elected before 1980 to, upon retirement, transfer the
balance of their campaign treasuries for personal use.

   The Senate early Saturday gave final approval
to a three-year authorization bill calling for up to $938 million
in U.S. aid to Poland and Hungary.
   Actual aid to Poland and Hungary still faces hurdles, however.
   An appropriations measure providing $533 million in hard cash
for the two East European nations this year is awaiting action on
the Senate floor.
   But the bill faces a veto threat from President Bush because of
unrelated provisions dealing with abortion.
   The authorization bill, which sets spending ceilings and policy
guidelines for the aid program, hit a snag Thursday night when
Republican senators complained that Democratic staff members had
removed provisions intended to provide safeguards that the aid
program not benefit communist causes and client states.
   On Friday, a formal conference of House and Senate members dealt
with the problem, dropping some proposals and accepting or
modifying others. The House approved the revised version Friday
night.
   The Senate approved the legislation by voice vote early Saturday
morning.
   Quick action on the aid authorization to help Poland deal with
its serious economic problems was urgently requested Wednesday by
Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa as he addressed a joint meeting
of Congress.
   The assistance includes programs for Poland with a value of
$846.5 million. Hungary would receive benefits with a total value
of $91.5 million.
   During the conference, negotiators refused to accept an
amendment offered by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., extending the
efective life of 12 unrelated domestic tax credits, including the
low-income housing tax credit.
   The conference also softened the impact of amendments offered by
GOP senators, some of which sought the outright termination of the
aid program if funds were diverted.
   It accepted language stating that the program could be ended if
the country involved was found to be engaged in international
activities ``directly and fundamentally contrary to U.S. national
security interests.''
   But it rejected an attempt to cut off aid if Poland or Hungary
were found to be providing weapons or military training or other
military aid to Cuba or Nicaragua. Instead, it required the Bush
administration to report in six months on the extent, if any, of
such activities.
   House Democrats contended that the provision was too extreme,
and subject to exploitation by enemies of reform.
   They said it would require ending all U.S. aid if Cuba received
just one rifle or if just one Nicaraguan policeman were trained.
   The conference dropped entirely an unrelated amendment by Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., dealing with the potential sale of Chinese
missiles to Middle Eastern nations.
   In its current form, the bill includes a $200 million standby
trade credit insurance program for Poland added earlier by the
House.
   The centerpiece of the bill is the authorization of a $240
million Free Enterprise Fund to bolster free-market reform in
Poland and a $200 million fund to help Poland stabilize its
inflation-battered economy.

   A national anti-abortion group says it will
continue blocking entrances to abortion clinics following the
arrests of more than 700 people on charges of violating a city
ordinance barring such demonstrations.
   Spokesmen for Operation Rescue said they would continue protests
at abortion clinics in the Washington area throughout the weekend.
   The group's members demonstrated at four Washington clinics
Friday, where they were met by members of various abortion-rights
groups. Police said 733 people were arrested.
   ``Our only objective here today is to save the children that are
scheduled to die,'' said Susan Finn, spokeswoman for Operation
Rescue. ``And right now, the doors are blocked so the women who are
scheduled to have their babies killed today can't get in. And at
every rescue we have there are babies saved.''
   More than 1,000 protesters traveled from around the country to
oppose the city's new ordinance banning anti-abortion
demonstrations within 100 feet of an abortion clinic.
   Members of Operation Rescue are seeking a temporary restraining
order that would allow them to protest. A hearing is scheduled in
federal court on Tuesday.
   Those arrested Friday will face misdemeanor charges of blocking
an entrance, with a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a $50
fine, or crossing a police line, which carries a $50 fine, police
Sgt. Joe Gentile said.
   Spokesmen for three of the targeted clinics said their
operations were not disrupted, although some patients did call in
to reschedule appointments.
   ``They did not close us down,'' said Julia Berman, administrator
of the Washington Surgiclinic. ``We have had patients all day.''
   President Bush vetoed the district's annual spending bill once
because it allows the city to use its own tax dollars to pay for
Medicaid-funded abortions. A second version of the bill, which also
permits the city to use local tax dollars for abortions, was
approved by Congress on Wednesday. Bush has not yet acted on the
legislation.

   An explosion sparked a fire and
secondary blasts at a Chevron refinery Friday night, but there were
no immediate reports of injuries and firefighters said the blaze
was stable 1{ hours later.
   The fire erupted shortly before 8 p.m. as a result of a ``major
explosion,'' said Dara Stone, an El Segundo police spokeswoman.
   Ninety minutes later, fire officials described the blaze as
``static,'' saying that it wasn't growing but wasn't diminishing
either.
   All of the dozen people working in the section of the plant
where the fire broke out were accounted for late Friday, said
Chevron spokesman Rod Spackman. Workers at the plant said flames
leaped hundreds of feet into the air when the blaze broke out. The
fire poured billows of thick, black smoke into the air.
   But John Marie, a bystander about a block away from the fire,
said it didn't appear to be in the area of the refinery towers and
``the flames are relatively small, about five or six feet in the
air.''
   Firefighters poured streams of water onto the flames that roared
within the refinery, located a few miles south of Los Angeles
International Airport. The refinery was also located near the large
Hughes Aircraft complex, which did not appear to be threatened.
   The fire broke out in the refinery's single largest crude oil
processing unit, known as a distillation unit, Spackman said. A
seal failed on a primary pump feeding the unit, he said. Hot crude
oil spilled from the pump onto the concrete pad surrounding the
unit and somehow ignited.
   Oil products in the lines were allowed to burn off.
   Firefighters from the surrounding Los Angeles County communities
of Hawthorne, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Inglewood were
called in to battle the blaze, said Paul Zavala, a Hawthorne fire
department spokesman.
   ``There are some toxic materials, we're told, so it is also a
hazardous materials situation,'' Zavala said.

   The director of a new museum hopes to
preserve traces of Jewish culture in the South, which bloomed in
the 19th century but has been slowly diminished by emigration to
northern cities and assimilation.
   Hundreds of thousands of German and other European Jews arrived
in the rural South in the mid- to late-19th century, and even after
World War II. But these small Jewish populations never had the
resilience of Northern communities.
   ``Throughout the development of the South there was definitely a
Jewish presence and that Jewish presence faded and settled into the
big cities. ... Our story is the same as the rest of rural America.
This is the story of small-town America,'' said Macy Hart, director
of the Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience.
   Exact figures are difficult to come by, but in 1987, 28 of the
42 Jewish congregations in four Deep South states had fewer than
100 families, Hart said. Twenty-three had no permanent rabbi; many
of them relied on rabbis-in-training sent by Jewish congregations
from the North.
   The museum, dedicated Oct. 15 on the site of a former summer
camp about 35 miles southwest of Jackson, will be key in linking
21st century Jews to the first years of their ancestors in America,
said Jacob Rader Marcus, the 94-year-old director of the American
Jewish Archives in Cincinnati.
   Marcus, a professor of American Jewish History at Hebrew Union
College, said he doesn't know of any other museum focusing on the
history of Jewish people in a particular region.
   ``This will encourage Jews to continue their faith. Jews are
very much concerned about that because they're assimilating and the
culture is disappearing,'' said Marcus.
   Jews were a major presence in the South in the 19th century;
many Jews fought in the Confederate army. But they never amounted
to more than 1 percent of the population in the South and their
numbers have shrunk this century, Hart said.
   When the children of Southern Jews left for jobs in the cities,
the older generation became caretakers of priceless religious as
well as family keepsakes.
   As congregations dwindled and synagogues closed, they lacked
heirs for the hand-copied Torahs; the delicately carved arks which
held the written law; the oil lamps of ``eternal light'' and the
history-engraved cornerstones of the synagogues themselves.
   Many items were discarded, but the devout continued to cling to
their heritage _ though the artifacts were often hidden in trunks
or boxes, stashed in attics or under beds, Hart said.
   ``It's pretty heavy to have a whole culture on your shoulders
and you don't know what to do with it,'' he said.
   Eventually, the various artifacts were being donated to the
Henry S. Jacobs Camp for Living Judaism, a summer camp near Utica,
established in 1970 for Jews from Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi,
Tennessee, Georgia and Arkansas.
   Camp directors didn't know what to do with the old pieces, and
originally thought of them only as a means of furnishing a
synagogue at the camp, Hart said.
   Later, they decided that only a full-fledged museum would be
worthy of the artifacts, many pre-dating the Civil War. In 1986 the
Plough Foundation, established by a wealthy Jewish family in
Memphis, Tenn., gave the camp $500,000 to build the museum.
   Along with the religious items, the museum has three historical
photographic exhibits, including one that portrays past and present
Jewish life in the South.
   Hart said he is trying to raise $5 million within five years to
prepare further museum displays and aid Southern Jewish
genealogical efforts, restore cemeteries and provide educational
programs on Jewish culture.
   Planning for the museum has spurred a movement nationwide, Hart
said. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations recently formed a
committee to look into means of preserving rural Jewish history.
   ``We're all racing against the clock,'' he said. ``But this will
be a model for others.''

<HEAD>Report: Administration Will Propose Defense Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, aiming to
take advantage of developments in the Eastern bloc, says he'll
propose cutting defense budgets over the next six years, The
Washington Post reports today.
   Cheney was quoted as saying the cuts will be ``significant,''
although he did not say how much money would be trimmed.
   The defense secretary has previously warned against overreacting
to changes in the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies.
   But in the Post interview, he said, ``While you need to be
concerned about possible reversal of trends in the Soviet Union,
there's a real sense that you want to take advantage of these
developments.''
   Unidentified officials were quoted as saying the reduction for
the 1991 fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1 would be about $10
billion, close to a cut of 3.5 percent from the $286 billion in
spending expected in the current fiscal year.
   The State Department has said it believes the Soviet Union is
reducing its military expenditures.
   The New York Times said in today's editions that the Pentagon's
comptroller had instructed the armed services to slice $180 billion
out of their five-year spending plans, the cuts to come from the
1992-1994 fiscal years.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said he could not confirm that
figure.
   Cheney said he will agree to trimming military expenses to meet
requirements for reducing the federal budget deficit and that some
Pentagon programs will feel the knife in the years to come.
   ``There is no way I'm going to do what I have to do without
force structure reductions, weapons cancellations, contract
terminations and base closings,'' Cheney said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, questioned about the reports early today, said he was
aware Cheney's ``order was out'' to the services to find ways to
cut back over a five-year period.
   Nunn said he could not confirm the $180 billion figure, but
noted that in comments he has made recently, zero percent growth
would amount to about $140 billion.

<HEAD>UN Investigator Says Iran Continues Executions, Torture</HEAD>

   A wave of executions of drug dealers and
traffickers in Iran may be a cover for political killings, a U.N.
human rights investigator reported.
   His report, released Friday, indicates Iranian authorities have
not eased the crackdown on dissent or improved the human rights
picture since the death in June of supreme leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The report by Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, a special representative of
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, said Iran was violating human
rights accords in carrying out the executions.
   ``From various sources, it has been possible to draw up a list
of some 1,700 individuals possibly executed, either for ordinary
offenses or for political offenses,'' said Galindo Pohl, a
Salvadoran.
   ``The Iranian press has reported few political executions so far
in 1989. However, many allegations have been received that the
large number of executions for drug trafficking masks political
executions,'' he wrote.
   He also cited reports that some political executions have taken
place in secret.
   He said political executions have occurred in recent months,
according to his information.
   ``Ill-treatment and torture, both physical and psychological,
were continuing in Iranian prisons,'' he said in the report.
   ``According to the reports, it would seem that, during the
months of the current year, psychological torture has been
prevailing over physical torture, with the aim of avoiding visible
marks,'' he said.
   Galindo Pohl was not allowed into Iran. He based his report on
official Iranian statements, news reports, and testimony from
refugees and opposition activists.
   He asked Iran to consider ``suppressing ill treatment and
torture, during both investigation and imprisonment.''
   According to Galindo Pohl, punishments included whipping the
soles of the feet with cables or barbed wire, sexual abuse, mock
executions, burning with cigarettes or hot metal rods, and
confinement en masse in ``small closed rooms with high temperatures
and insufficient oxygen.
   Iran contends that claims of executions stem from opposition
groups such as the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, which it calls a
``terrorist'' organization that assassinates people within Iran.
   The People's Mujahedeen of Iran, based in Baghdad and with an
office in Washington, has a military operation that attacks the
Iranian army. It also admits assassinating Iranian officials.
   Members of the Bahai faith who testified before Galindo Pohl
``described persecution and harassment to themselves and their
families, such as denial of jobs and professional education and
confiscation of property solely on religious grounds,'' said his
report.
   Iran's religious leaders contend the Bahai faith, a modern faith
originating in Iran, is a heretic cult.

   Gov. Robert P. Casey signed the nation's
toughest abortion controls into law despite warnings from
abortion-rights advocates that it could cost him re-election.
   When the bill signed Friday takes effect in 60 days, women in
the state will be banned from obtaining abortions after the 24th
week of pregnancy in most cases and will have to inform their
husbands if they plan an abortion.
   Pennsylvania is the first state to take advantage of a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling in July that gave states more leeway to make
their own abortion laws.
   Casey, a Democrat, said he was aware abortion-rights activists
would campaign heavily on the issue next year, when he is expected
to seek re-election and could face a Republican who supports a
woman's right to have an abortion.
   ``I hope that no one makes it a single-issue campaign. I
certainly don't plan to run a single-issue campaign,'' Casey said.
   He said the provisions of the law ``are appropriate and
reasonable, given the enormity of the decision any woman faces when
she considers having an abortion. The overwhelming votes in the
state House and Senate convince me that the vast majority of our
people will agree.''
   The abortion measure passed the House 143-58 last month; the
Senate approved the bill 33-17 on Tuesday.
   ``It gives a tremendous shot in the arm to the national pro-life
movement,'' said state Rep. Stephen Freind, the Republican who led
the anti-abortion fight in the Legislature.
   Jenny Daughtry, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights League chapter in Pennsylvania, said the bill was ``cruel
and demeaning and a direct attack on women's constitutional
rights.''
   ``Governor Casey's signature on this bill is an affront to the
health, welfare and interest of all Pennsylvanians. Pennsylvanians
will express their outrage over this attack on their rights at the
voting booth next November,'' she said.
   In a statement, Auditor General Barbara Hafer, the front-runner
for the Republican nomination, said she would have vetoed the bill.
   ``I believe that the bill does not reflect the will of the
majority of Pennsylvanians or, in fact, of Americans,'' Hafer said.
   Howard Fetterhoff, executive director of the Pennsylvania
Catholic Conference, said Casey's action ``demonstrated his
life-long commitment to what he believes: that innocent human life,
and in this case, the unborn ... are worthy of protection.''
   The new law also prohibits abortions based on the fetus' sex;
regulates the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses and
mandates women wait 24 hours to get an abortion. Doctors will have
to inform women about the procedure before performing an abortion
and explain risks and alternatives.
   The law also carries stiff penalties for doctors that violate
the regulations; a conviction under the sex-selection ban or
24-week provision could result in up to seven years in prison and
$15,000 in fines.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge allowed a class-action
lawsuit that challenges a state law restricting insurance for
abortions.
   The suit approved Friday by Judge Scott O. Wright challenges a
1983 statute that forbids insurance policies covering elective
abortions except by an optional rider that requires payment of an
additional premium.
   It was filed in July by Jane Coe, a pseudonym to protect the
identity of a married 39-year-old St. Louis-area woman. It names
Lewis Melahan, director of the Missouri Department of Insurance,
and William Webster, Missouri attorney general, as defendants.
   Earlier this year, Coe was pregnant carrying a fetus with
Trisomy 13 syndrome, a condition marked by congenital
malformations, including multiple-organ systems and severe mental
retardation, according to the complaint.
   Only 18 percent of such fetuses that survive birth live more
than a year, the complaint said.
   Coe underwent an abortion that resulted in medical fees of
$1,000, the suit said. Although she was insured under a
comprehensive health care policy issued by Blue Cross of Missouri,
coverage for the abortion was denied as a result of the law.

pay raise and ethics reform legislation approved by the House and
the Senate.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PAY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the House, federal judges, and top executive branch
officials would get pay increases of at least 35 percent in the
next 13{ months. The Senate would take an immediate 9.7 percent
boost.
   Except for the Senate, a 7.9 percent increase would be given by
Jan. 1 as a catch-up for two years without a cost-of-living
adjustment, or COLA. On Jan. 1, 1991, the same officials would
receive a 25 percent pay increase, on top of whatever
government-wide COLA takes effect at that time.
   Assuming no COLA in 1991, those salaries would go to $120,800.
Assuming a COLA of about 3 percent, pay would be about $124,400 _
39 percent above the current $89,500.
   After that, annual pay adjustments of up to 5 percent would be
automatic, based on the government's index of private-sector wages
and salaries.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For the Senate, the 9.7 percent increase would be a raise of
about $8,700.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>OUTSIDE INCOME</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   House members, officers and employees, federal judges and
government executives would be barred from accepting honoraria, or
speaking fees, beginning in 1991. For House members, current rules
limit such fees to 30 percent of salary. For senators, it's 40
percent.
   Once the ban takes effect, lawmakers could still steer speech
payments directly to charity, but they could not exceed $2,000.
   Senators would keep on collecting honoraria, but reduce the
limit dollar for dollar as their pay rises.
   Income earned outside of Congress by lawmakers and top staff
would be limited to 15 percent of congressional salary beginning in
1991. They could not receive directors' fees, legal fees or other
income for professional services. Book royalties would be exempt,
but must be from established publishers and at ``usual and
customary'' rates.
   Both the limit on outside income and the honoraria ban would be
lifted if the 1991 pay raise is repealed.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>GIFTS AND TRAVEL</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The two chambers would have new rules, slightly different from
each other, on accepting gifts.
   In the House, members and staff could not receive gifts from any
person, outside of family, totaling more than $200 a year beginning
Jan. 1. Most meals and gifts under $75 would not be counted in the
total. Currently, members are barred from receiving more than $100
a year in gifts from anyone with a ``direct interest in
legislation.'' Privately paid speaking trips would be limited to
four days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel.
   The Senate would have a $300 gift limit, except for family, and
would limit travel to three days domestic and seven for foreign
trips.

<BYLINE>ETHICS COMMITTEE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bipartisan House panel would be expanded from 12 to 14
members and would separate its investigative and trial functions.
If a House member is being investigated, the panel would divide
into two groups. One would serve in effect as a grand jury and the
other as the trial jury.

   House members who were in office in 1980 and now are allowed to

<BYLINE>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Both chambers would require more detailed reporting of their
assets, liabilities, income, and the gifts and travel they accept.
The members who now report their assets and liabilities in general
ranges would have to be more specific, especially when they are
worth more than $250,000.

<BYLINE>REVOLVING DOOR</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate version contains an entire section, not in the House
bill, on post-employment lobbying by government employees.
   It would bar members of Congress from lobbying anywhere in the
legislative branch for one year after they leave office. Cabinet
secretaries and very top White House aides could not lobby for a
year any other top executive branch official.
   Federal employees who gain confidential information learned from
a trade or treaty negotiation could not turn around and represent
private interests on that matter for one year.

   When 5-year-old Walt Crosby brought his
new wooden popgun to kindergarten for show-and-tell, school
officials showed him the door for violating a policy against
weapons on campus.
   ``I think somebody overreacted,'' said Wiley Crosby, Walt's
father, after the boy was suspended for one day from Jeff Davis
County Eleentary School. ``I think they need to use a little common
sense when dealing with a 5-year-old.''
   The gun is the type from which a cork pops and dangles on a
string.
   Fay Dickens, interim school superintendent for Jeff Davis
County, said the child was suspended Nov. 10 under a policy that
prohibits ``dangerous weapons, toy weapons and look-alike weapons''
and applies to all public school students, regardless of age.
   ``Five-year-olds are not excluded,'' Ms. Dickens said. ``And
with a popgun, the string could break and the cork could put out
another person's eye.''
   Ms. Dickens said another child was sent home for bringing a
water pistol to school.

   Delta Air Lines agreed to pay $1.1
million in damages to the parents of a man killed in the 1985 crash
of a jetliner outside Dallas.
   The award to the parents of Michael Epstein, 24, of West Palm
Beach, was announced Thursday, just an hour before Leo Epstein, 72,
and his former wife, Nancy Epstein, 68, were to go to trial against
Delta.
   Flight 191 crashed on approach to Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport in a violent thunderstorm Aug. 2, 1985.
   On Wednesday, a six-member federal jury awarded $3.4 million to
the parents of Julie Ann Zarnt, 15, another victim of the crash.
   In all, 182 claims and 115 lawsuits have been filed against
Delta since the crash. Delta Has paid out more than $67 million in
settlements.

<HEAD>Negotiators Repeal Catastrophic Coverage, Near Deficit-Reduction
Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators from the House and Senate are
calling for repeal of catastrophic health coverage for retirees and
nearing agreement on a compromise deficit-reduction package.
   Final action on those two bills, which could come Sunday, would
free Congress to adjourn for the year.
   Senior tax-writers in both houses agreed early today to kill the
catastrophic program, which was enacted with great fanfare less
than 18 months ago in an effort to protect retirees from being
bankrupted by costs of a major illness.
   But two Republican senators who had wanted to scale back the
program said they will work to defeat the repeal agreement. Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., promised to use every parliamentary tactic
available in an effort to prevent repeal, which he said would be an
incredible injustice.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas agreed with McCain that
repeal should be blocked. That means the Senate could be facing a
filibuster against repeal just as it tries to shut down for the
year.
   Repeal would leave many of the 32 million retirees with no
protection against catastrophic bills for hospital stays, skilled
nursing care, prescription drugs and doctors' fees.
   The Senate Finance Committee approved a compromise
deficit-reduction plan worked out on Friday by its chairman, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and the chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. The plan still was
subject to final approval by the Ways and Means Committee before
being put to a vote in the House and Senate on Sunday.
   The committees were unable to estimate immediately how much the
package would reduce the deficit. The tax committees' portion of
the plan includes several minor tax increases and targeted cuts in
Medicare reimbursements to doctors and hospitals.
   The tax increase affecting the greatest number of people would
extend permanently the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance
telephone service which is due to expire at the end of 1990.
   Even while Democratic leaders were working out a package of
deficit cuts, GOP lawmakers pronounced the Democratic effort
inadequate.
   ``They appear to be short'' of the savings President Bush is
insisting on, Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, ranking Republican on
the Senate Finance Committee, said of the Democratic package. Bush
has threatened to veto any bill that falls short of cutting $14
billion from this year's government shortfall.
   The Democratic leaders were aiming to slice at least $12 billion
from the federal budget deficit.
   It seemed all but certain that in addition to the
deficit-reduction bill, additional savings would come from allowing
the Gramm-Rudman law's constraints on federal spending to remain in
effect for at least two months.
   Because Congress and President Bush have been unable to agree to
a budget-cutting package, the Gramm-Rudman law since Oct. 1 has
trimmed about 5 percent from most domestic programs and about 4
percent from defense spending.
   Lawmakers are virtually certain to allow the Gramm-Rudman cuts
that have already been made to stand, and perhaps to extend them to
about Jan. 1. But legislators planned to halt any further
reductions under the law.
   Leaving the cuts in effect saves the government roughly $1
billion per month.
   The Senate passed a bill claiming $14 billion in savings on Oct.
13, eight days after the House approved an $11 billion version of
the measure. But the House bill was loaded with unrelated
provisions, such as changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
A large portion of the negotiations between the two houses have
been over how to deal with the extraneous House provisions.
   Bush has threatened to veto any deficit-cutting bill that relies
on phony savings gimmicks, although lawmakers say they believe they
can fashion a bill he would sign.
   Some artifices are expected to remain in the measure anyway,
such as a claimed savings of $1.7 billion by not counting money
lost by the Postal Service in the government's budget calculations.
   The Bush administration says it expects the deficit for the 1990
fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, to reach $116 billion.
Congressional experts have put the figure closer to $141 billion.

<TEXT>
   The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, its
earthquake -ruptured section repaired and sporting new silver
paint, was reopened Friday night in a din of blaring horns and
cheers.
   Six California Highway Patrol cruisers, sirens whining, and 13
private tow trucks, yellow lights flashing, led a parade on a 35
mph, 10-minute trip across the upper deck to San Francisco.
   Five American Red Cross vehicles followed the tow trucks across
the bridge. Westbound motorists were kept a mile back from the
bridge on nearby freeways until after the official opening. It was
the first traffic on the span since 7.1-magnitude quake struck
Northern California on Oct. 17, killing 66 people, most of them on
a freeway that collapsed in Oakland.
   But the true test for the 8.5-mile Bay Bridge _ the longest
high-level span in the world _ will come Monday when thousands of
commuters are expected to return to the vital artery. The bridge
carried more than 260,000 vehicles every weekday before the quake
sent a 250-ton piece of the upper deck smashing onto the lower
deck, killing one driver.
   Transportation officials warned that gridlock will result if too
many commuters abandon mass transit on Monday because several key
approaches to the bridge remain closed on either side of the bay.
   ``We had a traffic problem here even before the quake,'' said
Bob Halligan, spokesman for the state Department of Transportation.
``Now people will have to decide if they want to sit in their cars
for hours on the Bay Bridge, or do they want to get to work?''
   Halligan said Highway Patrol vehicles would lead motorists
across at the reopening to restrain any drivers who might be
tempted to set a speed record over the empty bridge.
   The quake forced thousands of commuters to switch to alternative
means of transit or take a longer route across the bay by using
four other main toll bridges in the area.
   A fleet of 20 ferry boats was amassed during the crisis,
recalling the days when even bigger ferries were common sights on
the bay.
   Terry Koenig, marketing manager of Red &amp; White Fleet, said his
company and Blue &amp; Gold, the other ferry operator, have been
averaging about 15,000 riders a day. The operators have enough
money from a $2 million emergency grant from the state to maintain
increased service through Jan. 15.
   Ridership also skyrocketed on the Bay Area Rapid Transit system,
which has a line running under the bay. On Wednesday, BART carried
355,131 people, besting the previous record of 352,696 set Nov. 3.
   One motorist who opted for BART, Bob Eberle of Emeryville, said
he plans to go back to his car.
   ``There was too much wait,'' he said as he emerged from a subway
station in San Francisco on Friday. ``With my car, I can get right
on the bridge.'' Eberle also complained there wasn't enough parking
space at the BART station in his neighborhood.
   But the transit system was a winner as far as Stanley Collis was
concerned. ``I'm going to stick with BART,'' said Collis, who works
at the state building in San Francisco. ``It's cheaper than finding
a parking space and I get a chance to read or sleep.''
   The gridlock warnings weren't the first since the quake.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos warned ``the largest traffic jams
in the history of the area'' would develop on Oct. 23, the first
full-blown rush hour to follow the devastating earthquake.
   The traffic jams didn't happen, despite heavy rain and wind
gusts over 50 mph. Officials said many people got up early for work
and helped spread out the rush hour.

   Vietnam says it may hold up settlement of
Vietnam War-related humanitarian issues if U.S. property claims are
paid from frozen assets of the fallen Saigon government, members of
Congress are being told.
   The main humanitarian issues involve efforts to account for U.S.
servicemen still missing after the war and emigration permission
for tens of thousands of people stranded after the fall of Saigon
in 1975. They include Vietnamese people who worked for Americans
during the war or their close relatives and ``Amerasian'' children
fathered by American servicemen.
   Hanoi authorities ``have given very clear indication that it
would impede progress'' on such humanitarian matters if the United
States settled citizen claims against Vietnam using more than $200
million in blocked U.S. accounts of the former South Vietnam
government, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David F. Lambertson
told a House panel on Friday.
   State and Treasury Department officials strongly opposed pending
legislation to seize the frozen funds to pay 192 American
claimants. The U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission ruled in
1986 that they were entitled to eventual reimbursement for $99
million worth of property lost during the fall of Saigon plus 6
percent annual interest.
   The claims include corporate assets, personal effects and unsold
farmland left behind by U.S. government employees and civilians who
heeded superiors' pleas to stay on until it was too late for
orderly departure, said the claimants' lawyer, Roderick M. Hills.
   R.R. Newcomb, Treasury director of foreign assets control, said
seizing the blocked assets unilaterally was a drastic step that
would undermine the U.S. position that ``foreign property _ whether
U.S. property abroad or foreign property in the U.S.'' cannot be
taken without compensation.
   Paying the private claims now could also jeopardize future
settlement of U.S. government claims against the Saigon accounts,
he added.
   Hanoi's position is that claims are matters for negotiation, not
unilateral decision, Lambertson told the Asian and Pacific affairs
subcommittee hearing.
   But the U.S. cannot now negotiate, he explained, under its
policy of holding up normalization with Vietnam until Hanoi
cooperates in a comprehensive solution of the Cambodian question.
   American interests are strongly involved in the pending
humanitarian issues, said the State Department's chief of refugee
programs, Assistant Secretary Robert L. Funseth.

<TEXT>
   Two new accidents, including a fire aboard a
nuclear-powered submarine, were reported on the last day of the
Navy's service-wide safety review that was ordered after a rash of
mishaps.
   The fire aboard the submarine USS Finback broke out in
insulation around an engine on the attack submarine, forcing the
vessel to cut short sea trials, Lt. Cmdr. Bill Sonntag of the
Submarine Atlantic Forces said Friday.
   The fire _ which broke out Wednesday _ was quickly extinguished
without danger of a nuclear accident and without injuries, he said.
   The Norfolk-based Finback returned to port Thursday to repair
the insulation, and the submarine's crew participated in the safety
review, Sonntag said.
   In the second accident, which occurred Friday, mechanical
problems forced a TA-4J training jet to ditch in the Gulf of Mexico
south of Pensacola, Fla., a Navy spokesman said. The two pilots
ejected safely.
   The stand-down halting all normal operations and training was
ordered Tuesday by Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III and Adm.
Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval operations, after a three-week
string of accidents.
   ``Never in the history of the modern Navy, have so many mishaps
happened at one time,'' said Capt. Ferguson Norton, commander of
the Naval Safety Center at the Norfolk Naval Station and the Navy's
top safety officer.
   But Norton said the accidents weren't related.
   Since Oct. 29, 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at
least 71 injured in accidents ranging from men washed overboard to
plane crashes, ship fires and the accidental bombing of a cruiser.
   Trost ordered all Navy units to hold the 48 hours of safety
review sometime over a 72-hour period beginning Tuesday; the last
reviews concluded Friday.
   Trost ordered commanders to report findings from the safety
review to him. Navy spokesmen had no details on what the reports
contained.
   Navy officials said the stand-down wasn't ordered because the
service was operating in an unsafe manner, but because Garrett and
Trost wanted to ensure that everything that could be done was being
done to protect servicemen.
   Despite the recent crop of mishaps, 1989 is the service's safest
year on record so far, with 69 major accidents reported, according
to the Navy. In 1984, 118 major accidents were reported. Every year
since then, the numbers have declined.
   The Navy defines a major accident as one that causes a fatality
or $1 million or more in damage.
   Where 1989 varies from the previous five years is in fatalities.
There have been 102 this year, including the 47 sailors killed in
the April 19 gun turret explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa.
In 1984, 64 people died in accidents.

<HEAD>Senate Leaders Turn Back Cason Nomination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders are sending the nomination of
James Cason for a top natural resources job back to President Bush
and asking him to select someone else.
   The action taken Friday marked the first time since the vote
against John Tower for defense secretary earlier this year that a
nomination was turned back when it reached the Senate floor.
   ``It will mark the first time that any assistant secretary
nominee would be defeated after being reported out of committee
with a favorable recommendation,'' said Republican leader Bob Dole
of Kansas.
   Cason, a high-ranking official at the Interior Department since
1982, was nominated to be assistant secretary of agriculture for
natural resources and soil conservation.
   After two days of hearings, the Agriculture Committee voted 12-7
to send the nomination to the Senate floor, despite vocal
opposition from committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and
some other committee members.
   Environmentalists opposed Cason because they said he showed a
preference at Interior for private development over environmental
concerns.
   Dole called the mounting opposition a ``campaign of distortion
has successfully poisoned the debate.'' But after conferring with
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and the White House, he
requested that the Senate not act on the nomination.
   Leahy said Friday that if a vote had been taken, Cason would
have been rejected by a 20-vote margin.

<NOTE>Court Clears Way for Restoration of Cable Blackout Rules</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has cleared the way
for restoration of rules designed to prevent cable TV systems from
showing syndicated programs that local TV stations also might be
showing.
   The unanimous ruling Friday by a three-judge panel of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia could mean
that TV viewers will get fewer chances to view some of their
favorite syndicated shows starting Jan. 1.
   Syndicated shows are those not controlled by a network, but made
available by their producers to stations independently. Frequently
they are reruns of previous network hits.
   The court upheld a 1988 decision by the Federal Communications
Commission to reinstate its so-called syndicated exclusivity rules
that the agency had lifted in 1980 to help boost the cable TV
industry.
   The rules allow local over-the-air stations to contract with
program suppliers for the exclusive rights in their broadcast areas.
   Broadcasters claim program duplication reduces their audiences
and their advertising revenues while giving broadcasters less
incentive to develop syndicated programming.
   The appeals court denied challenges to the rules from cable
companies and industry organizations that claimed they were
arbitrary and violated federal law and cable operators' First
Amendment rights.

<NOTE>Air Force Says This Model is `Not Your Normal Fax'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is defending its purchase of 173
custom-made facsimile machines under contracts that amount to $73
million, contending they are designed to withstand conditions of
battlefield duty.
   ``This isn't just a normal fax that sits in your office and does
its thing,'' Air Force spokesman Maj. Lou Figueroa said Friday.
``These are not machines made to sit in a wing commander's office.
They are designed to be deployed off a dirt runway.''
   The service was inundated with queries about the machines after
a published report said they cost $421,000 apiece, a figure
computed by dividing the $73 million cost by 173.
   Figueroa disputed the figure, however, saying the service was
paying $76,000 for each unit.
   He said the machines were being purchased from Litton Industries
under a contract for $33 million, and that an additional contract
for some $40 million covers ``a very extensive list'' of diagnostic
equipment, laser assemblies, and other items such as power
supplies, training for use of the units, and the paper _ which
costs $100 a roll.

   People forced from their homes by a fire that
burned for 24 hours at a propane storage area were allowed home
after oilfield firefighting experts helped extinguish the blaze.
   About 500 people _ half the town _ returned home Friday.
   They were evacuated Thursday after propane leaking from a
17-acre underground storage cavern ignited, shooting flames 200
feet into the air.
   After one attempt to put out the fire at the Williams Pipe Line
Co. failed, local firefighters moved a mile away and let it burn
until the team from Boots &amp; Coots, Inc. could arrive from Houston.
   The fire was put out when 4,000 gallons of water was pumped into
the limestone cavern to contain the propane gas.
   ``They're good,'' Carthage fire Lt. Donovan Whitman said of
oilwell firefighters David Thompson and Ace Barnes. ``We couldn't
have done it without them.
   Fifteen trucks brought in water, which was emptied into a nearby
farmer's pond. Three pumper trucks were used to build up enough
pressure to move the water from the pond to the cavern.
   A similar effort failed Thursday because there wasn't enough
water available, Whitman said.
   Jasper is 120 miles south of Kansas City.

<HEAD>Former Indian Official Hiding on Canadian Reservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Indian leader,
who has been living here as a political refugee, fled Canadian
authorities after being convicted of a sex charge and ordered
returned to the United States.
   Robert Satiacum, the former chairman of the Puyallup Indian
nation, who became a U.S. fugitive in 1982, sought sanctuary among
a Canadian Indian band, according to a spokeswoman for the band.
   Satiacum, 60, was convicted Nov. 9 of fondling a 10-year-old
girl. He was ordered deported to the United States to face
racketeering and other charges, but instead headed to the Mount
Currie Indian reservation, about 100 miles northwest of Vancouver,
Indian spokeswoman Lyn Compton said Friday.
   Mark Hilford, who resigned Friday as Satiacum's lawyer, said the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police would seek to arrest Satiacum on
charges of failing to appear for sentencing on the sex charge.
Satiacum probably would serve that sentence before being deported,
officials said.
   But Ms. Compton said the Mount Currie band was ``taking a
stand'' and refusing to surrender Satiacum to police.
   ``He is a member of this nation. He has sought refuge, sanctuary
here,'' Ms. Compton said. ``What people here are doing is standing
by their sovereign rights, their traditional laws. They do not
recognize Canadian laws or the Canada-U.S. border.''
   The Mount Currie Indians belong to the Coast-Salish ancestral
group, which extends along the coast from Washington state to
southwest Alaska and includes the Puyallups. The band adopted
Satiacum in 1987.
   ``This has happened before,'' Ms. Compton said. ``Chief Sitting
Bull sought sanctuary in the north. This is history repeating
itself.''
   Satiacum has said he wouldn't be taken alive by authorities.
   ``I don't want to see an armed confrontation,'' said Jeff
Williamson, head of the inquiries and removal section of the
Canadian Immigration Department. ``I don't want to see him in a
shootout with police.''
   In 1982, Satiacum fled Washington state, where he faced up to
300 years in jail on charges including racketeering, embezzlement,
arson and conspiracy to commit murder.
   Two years ago he became the first U.S. citizen to be granted
political refugee status in Canada, when an immigration tribunal
found he had a reasonable fear of persecution if returned to the
United States.
   In June the ruling was overturned by the Federal Court of
Appeal. Satiacum has been seeking an appeal with the Supreme Court
of Canada.

   Gunmen today massacred a Moslem
militiaman and four relatives a day before southern Filipinos vote
on a regional autonomy plan offered in response to Moslem demands,
police said.
   Elsewhere on southern Mindanao island, two bombs exploded. There
were no reports of injury.
   Voters in 13 southern provinces and nine cities decide Sunday
whether to join a regional autonomous government for the southern
Philippines.
   President Corazon Aquino had made the offer to placate demands
for self-rule by an estimated 4 million Moslems.
   Moslems who have waged a nearly 20-year-old insurgency have
rejected the plan as inadequate.
   Col. Jesus Almadin, police area commander, said the massacre
took place shortly after midnight in a village on the outskirts of
Zamboanga, a port city about 540 miles south of Manila.
   Almadin said 15 unidentified men sprayed automatic weapon fire
and exploded several grenades in the house of a Moslem militiaman,
killing him, his wife, two sons and a daughter-in-law.
   The militiaman's 9-year-old son was critically wounded and two
other relatives escaped unhurt, Almadin added.
   The assailants set the house on fire before escaping, he said.
   ``I think this (massacre) may aggravate the situation,'' Almadin
said. ``The Christians could be blamed, and the Moslems could
retaliate.''
   Ustadz Jain Jali, spokesman of the Moslem Moro National
Liberation Front, said the incident was perpetrated by Christian
militiamen who killed the Moslem militiaman because of an ``old
family feud.''
   ``It seems that they (the killers) were taking advantage of the
tension in the area,'' Jali said, referring to violent incidents
linked to the plebiscite.
   Almadin also said a small incendiary bomb exploded just outside
Zamboanga's airport. In Lanao del Sur province, a bomb exploded in
the provincial capitol building in Marawi city, destroying election
materials. There were no reports of casualties, police said.
   Marawi is about 175 miles northeast of Zamboanga and 510 miles
southeast of Manila, the nation's capital.
   On Friday, 50,000 military and police were placed on full alert
in wide areas of Mindanao because of fear the rebels might escalate
attacks as the plebiscite nears.
   Many Christian voters are expected to reject the autonomy plan,
and Moslems form a majority in only five impoverished and
geographically separated provinces. Only 28 percent of the 3.9
million registered voters are Moslem, election records show.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Aquino urged people to take part in the
referendum but did not specifically ask them to endorse her plan.
   Mrs. Aquino forged a cease-fire with the Moslem rebels in 1986.
Peace talks collapsed in May 1987, but the cease-fire generally has
held.
   Before the Moslem rebellion peaked in the mid-1970s, an
estimated 50,000 people were killed and thousands more fled to the
nearby Malaysian state of Sabah.

   Moslem fundamentalists angry over plans
for a Hindu temple at a disputed site in India attacked Hindu shops
in southwestern Bangladesh, and at least 50 people were injured, a
newspaper reported today.
   More than 340 people have died in India during riots over plans
of Hindu fundamentalists to build a temple by demolishing a 16th
century mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya.
   The Bengali-language newspaper, the Sangbad, said about 500
Moslems hurled stones at Hindu-owned shops on Friday in Khulna, 85
miles southwest of Dhaka. It said at least 50 people were injured.
   The protestors from a fundamentalist group called Council of
Priests also attacked the offices of the secular Awami League Party
after a rally in the town park, the independent daily said.
   Police fired in the air and used tear gas and clubs to disperse
the rioters, it said. It did not say whether people sustained
injuries in the police action.
   The newspaper said police arrested 13 people. Officials in
Khulna refused to comment.
   Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan protested to India
after a Hindu group laid the foundation stone Nov. 9 for the temple
of god Ram at Ayodhya. The group has agreed to postpone the
construction until next year.
   On Nov. 11, Moslem mobs angry over the planned temple damaged
three Hindu temples and burned at least 25 Hindu shops in
Narsinghdi in eastern Bangladesh.

<HEAD>Phone Company Breaks Off Negotiations With Strikers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hopes for an end to a bitter 14-week-old phone
strike were dashed today when Nynex Corp. broke off negotiations
with one of two striking unions, saying the workers had reneged on
an earlier agreement.
   No further talks were scheduled with the Communications Workers
of America, said John Bonomo, spokesman for Nynex, which serves
10.5 million customers in New York and New England.
   The CWA represents 40,000 workers at New York Telephone, the
subsidiary of Nynex that serves New York state. Another 20,000
workers represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers work for New England Telephone, the other Nynex subsidiary.
   In Boston, negotiators for IBEW and New England Telephone said
they had reached tentative agreement on local issues just before a
midnight deadline Friday night. Officials of both sides said IBEW
members would vote Sunday on that proposed agreement.
   It was unclear if the CWA and IBEW could settle independently of
each other.
   Bonomo said one of the stumbling blocks in reaching a settlement
with the CWA was health care for retired workers, an issue Nynex
said had been resolved in a tentative settlement reached Monday. At
that time, the company said it would pay all health benefits if the
unions gave up annual lump-sum bonuses and a profit-sharing plan.
   CWA spokesman Bob Masters said the talks broke down Friday
because of the company's insistence that the tentative agreement be
signed before other details could be worked out.
   The unfinished details included company demands for a longer
work week at the same pay and an extension of company rights to
hire temporary workers, Masters said.
   ``The company walked away from the table,'' he said.
   The talks were held at a hotel in Rye Brook, a town just north
of New York City.
   The strike began Aug. 6 in tandem with strikes at three other
regional telephone companies around the United States. Those
strikes were all resolved within a few weeks.
   The strike has delayed directory assistance, repairs and
installation for Nynex's 10.5 million customers in New York,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont
and Maine.

<HEAD>Report Says Ethiopia Providing Israel Naval Facilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopia will provide Israel with naval
facilities in the Red Sea as part of the deal that led to
diplomatic relations between the two nations, a Sudanese government
newspaper reported.
   The newspaper, Al-Engaz Al-Watani, also said Friday the deal
allows 22,000 Ethiopian Jews to leave for Israel and pledges
Israeli military experts to help Ethiopia's Marxist government put
down secession movements in the north.
   However, other reports say there are no more than 18,000 Jews
left in Ethiopia.
   Ethiopia two weeks ago restored diplomatic relations with Israel
after severing them over the 1973 Middle East war.
   The Khartoum daily quoted diplomatic sources for its report but
gave no names. Ethiopia supports rebels in southern Sudan and has
been on bad terms with the Sudanese government for years.
   There was no immediate comment from the Israeli government.
   The New York Times has reported that Israeli military advisers
are at an Ethiopian air force base. It said Ethiopia turned to the
Israelis for help against rebels in Eritrea and Tigre provinces
after its main supplier, the Soviet Union, demanded national
reconciliation.
   Al-Engaz Al-Watani said its diplomatic sources reported that the
Soviet government gave Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam
the go-ahead to resume relations with Israel.
   The paper said resumption of relations amounted to an exchange
of Israeli military help for the Jews, called Falashas, and naval
facilities. But it gave no specifics of military help Israel will
give under the purported deal.
   It said the ``military and maritime facilities'' are to be on
the islands of Sali and Khaja in the Bab al-Mandab, the southern
mouth of the Red Sea. The report did not say what sort of
facilities would be included or whether they would constitute
full-scale bases.
   In the 1973 war, Egypt and South Yemen sealed the area to
Israeli ships in an attempt to neutralize Israel's control of the
Strait of Tiran at the tip of the Sinai Peninsula.
   The figure of 22,000 Ethiopian Jews to go to Israel clashes with
other estimates of the number left after a controversial
U.S.-sponsored airlift spirited out around 8,000 Falashas in
November 1984-January 1985.
   Israel's Public Council for Ethiopian Jews estimates that only
18,000 remain, and the Ethiopian government sets the figure at
16,000.
   The mid-1980s operation, which incensed Arab governments who
charged that it helped their enemy Israel, went via airstrips in
Sudan.
   The day after Israeli-Ethiopian ties were restored, Israel's
foreign minister, Moshe Arens, said the move would ``facilitate the
ability to deal directly with the government of Ethiopia to bring
out the remainder of Ethiopian Jewry to Israel.''

   Fair and cold weather prevailed across much of the nation early
today, with a cold front extending into the Southeast expected to
take freezing temperatures as far south as Florida.
   Temperatures dipped to the 20s and 30s throughout the East,
Midwest and Northwest, and fell to as low as 6 degrees in
Minneapolis-St. Paul and 13 degrees in Des Moines, Ill. Snow fell
in Sault St. Marie, Mich.
   In parts of the South, temperatures dropped to the 30s early
today. Freezing temperatures were expected in northeast Florida,
Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas and Virginia.
   Record low temperatures for the date Friday included 8 degrees
at Gilbert, Ark., and 24 degrees at Greer, S.C.
   The cold front and snow moved through Chicago early Friday
evening, causing several accidents during rush hour.
   Two people died in separate accidents in Wisconsin after a snow
storm iced pavements. Milwaukee police reported 120 accidents in a
four-hour period.
   ``It's like driver's education,'' Eau Claire police Sgt. Jerry
Berg said. ``That first snowfall, you have to teach them all how to
drive again.''
   Snow fell Friday evening over southeast Minnesota, northeast
Iowa, eastern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, northern Indiana,
Michigan and northwest New York. Rain dampened parts of Iowa and
Nebraska and the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Not all of the nation was shivering under a cold front.
   Record highs for the date were set in Northern California,
including 80 degrees at Moffett Field Naval Air Station, near
Mountain View, and 75 degrees in Oakland.
   The high temperature for the nation Friday was 88 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third of this capital's 1
million people were reportedly trapped without food and water after
a week of fighting between leftist rebels and government troops.
   Journalists in the eastern provincial capital of San Miguel
reported heavy fighting in that city and on a nearby bridge Friday
night. They had no estimates of deaths or injuries in the city 85
miles east of the capital.
   Hospital and military sources say more than 800 people have been
killed and and 2,000 wounded since the Marxist-led rebels launched
the offensive against the rightist government on Nov 11.
   There was a lull in the fighting in San Salvador on Friday night
and early today, with only occasional bursts of gunfire. However,
the capital has suffered the worst fighting of the 10-year-old
civil war over the past week.
   Chavez Mena of the center-left Christian Democratic Party said
300,000 people, nearly a third of the capital's population, have
been cut off from food and water and were pinned down in homes or
shelters by the fierce fighting.
   Six Jesuit priests and two others killed along with them at a
Roman Catholic university were to be buried today after
international forensic experts examine the bodies.
   University officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniforms
enter the slain priests' residence just before the shooting began
Thursday. However, the U.S.-backed right-wing government denounced
the killings and said it would investigate.
   The murders were widely condemned in El Salvador and abroad, and
the U.S. ambassador offered protection to witnesses who come
forward.
   Dozens of religious workers, labor activists, academics and
political figures went into hiding after the slaughter of the
priests and the arrests Thursday of 12 Lutheran missionary workers.
The Lutherans, including four Americans, were released unharmed
Friday, the U.S. Embassy said.
   Union halls and a human rights office were broken into and
right-wing graffiti scrawled on the walls Friday, and a Roman
Catholic official said a right-wing supporter with a loudspeaker
yelled threats outside the residence of Monsignor Arturo Rivera
Damas, the archbishop of San Salvador.
   ``We have the justified fear that the assassinations are the
beginning of a series of actions against unions, labor groups and
politicians,'' said Fidel Chavez Mena, secretary-general of the
opposition Christian Democratic Party.
   Mena, whose centrist party governed the nation until its defeat
by President Alfredo Cristiani this year, blamed the ultra-right
for the killings.
   ``Whether they were part of the military or not, we don't
know,'' he said.
   Rivera Damas said at a Friday news conference that the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front rebels accepted his call for a
cease-fire but that the government has only said it would study the
proposal.
   Cristiani said in a television broadcast Friday night that the
fighting ``has been totally controlled'' in northern parts of the
capital and that ``only a few small centers'' of conflict remained
in San Salvador's eastern neighborhoods.
   The northern Meijicanos neighborhood was the scene of the only
heavy fighting in the capital area Friday. During that battle, a
British journalist, 44-year-old David Blundy, of the newspaper the
Sunday Correspondent, was fatally shot by a sniper.
   The shootings Thursday of Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of Jose
Simeon Canas Central American University near the capital,
vice-rector Ignacio Martin Baro, four other Jesuit priests, their
housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter drew international
condemnation.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker on Friday pressured the
Salvadoran government to quickly conduct an investigation and
launched an inquiry of his own, promising protection to witnesses.
   He said the killings were a ``blot on the image'' of El
Salvador's government that could only be erased by a full
investigation and punishment of the guilty.
   U.S. religious leaders blamed the slayings on right-wing forces
and called for a cutoff of U.S. aid to the Cristiani government.
   Democratic senators threatened to slash the aid unless Cristiani
ends the violence. The government has received $3.5 billion in aid
this decade.
   ``In an era of scarce foreign assistance, we need to be asking
what we are achieving for the dollars sent,'' Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass, told a Capitol Hill hearing Friday.
   Also Friday, Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said Salvadoran national
guardsmen had detained a New Jersey teacher and peace activist in a
church along with other church workers since Thursday night.
   In his statement, Bradley said 53-year-old Teresa Fitzgibbon, of
Trenton, is part of a Lutheran Church group providing medical care
to refugees from the fighting.
   Jose Maria Tojeira, the head of the Jesuit order for Central
America, on Friday held a memorial Mass for the slain priests.
   ``History repeats itself. They have not died, they are alive
among the Salvadoran people,'' he said.
   After the killings, most of the faculty at the University of San
Salvador, heavily dominated by leftists, had ``withdrawn,'' said
vice-rector Herbert Barillas without elaboration.
   An annual report presented Friday at the United Nations accused
El Salvador's government of presiding over a ``resurgence of
torture'' this year and a crackdown on labor groups.
   Cristiani took office June 1 as the winning candidate of the
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance founded by Roberto
D'Aubuisson, who has been linked to death squads blamed for killing
tens of thousands in the last decade.

   The vital San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge, whose ruptured span symbolized the power of the Oct. 17
earthquake, reopened to traffic exactly one month after the temblor.
   Six California Highway Patrol cruisers, sirens whining, and 13
private tow trucks, yellow lights flashing, led a parade on a 35
mph, 10-minute trip across the upper deck to San Francisco just
before midnight Friday.
   Westbound motorists who were kept a mile back from the bridge
until after it was officially reopened began driving across the
53-year-old structure for the first time since the 7.1-magnitude
quake struck Northern California.
   The temblor killed 66 people, including one motorist on the
bridge, and caused $7 billion in damages. It shook loose a 50-foot
section of the bridge. The loss of the Bay Bridge disrupted the
lives of residents who had to seek alternative routes to work, but
transportation officials warned the traffic nightmare would
continue Monday because of damaged bridge approaches and other
highway damage.
   Commuters who have been using mass transit, including cross-Bay
ferries and the underground Bay Area Rapid Transit system, were
urged to continue to do so.
   ``We had a traffic problem here even before the quake,'' said
Bob Halligan, a spokesman for the state Department of
Transportation. `Now people will have to decide if they want to sit
in their cars for hours on the Bay Bridge, or do they want to get
to work?''
   CHP officers led the way during the bridge opening to discourage
motorists from trying to set speed records on the empty span, said
Halligan.
   Drivers from two San Francisco towing companies were invited to
cross behind the highway patrol as thanks for having towed for free
dozens of cars that were abandoned on the bridge on the evening of
the quake.

   Bombs exploded at a Mormon temple and a
community hall, officials said, in attacks blamed on drug
traffickers.
   The bombings Friday night caused minor damage and no injuries
were reported.
   It was the second attack against the Mormon temple located in
the southern sector of the capital, in the district known as Ciudad
Jardin (Garden City). Last week a powerful bomb damaged it
extensively but no one was injured was injured in that blast.
   The bombings are attributed to the terrorist offensive unleashed

   The government's National Security Council says 39 people have
died and 232 people were wounded in 255 bombing and arson attacks
blamed on drug traffickers.

   In a bid to ease conflict among
Presbyterians on one of the country's most divisive issues,
advocates for and against legalized abortion vented their views at
a national conference.
   ``Church members must learn to listen to all perspectives, or
we're poorer as a community,'' said Carl Batzel, a pastor from
Susquehanna, Pa. ``In our denomination, there are too many times we
associate with only those of a like mind.''
   About 225 representatives from the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
gathered Friday for the National Dialogue on Abortion Perspectives.
The church officially adopted a stand approving legalized abortion
in 1983, but each year since then its governing body has been asked
to reverse the policy.
   The church began setting up the conferences in 1987.
   During the opening session, Louise Lawson, associate pastor of a
Presbyterian church in Memphis, Tenn., said while she supports a
woman's right to an abortion, it should be used as ``a last
resort.''
   ``Anti-abortion advocates say pregnancy and childbearing always
represent God's will,'' but such a viewpoint does not consider the
free will of humans, Lawson said.
   Dr. Carolyn Gerster of Scottsdale, Ariz., who is active in the
National Right to Life Committee, said no issue since slavery has
divided the nation like abortion.
   ``I'm a feminist, but abortion involves the death of a
developing human,'' she said. ``Abortion is the death of a person.
... And that's not a matter of personal morality, but of public
morality.''
   The conference participants were chosen from regional governing
bodies of the church, called synods, from across the country. The
synods were asked to choose a delegation with a diversity of ideas
about abortion.
   The 3 million-member denomination created a task force on
problem pregnancies and abortion in 1988 and is working on a policy
statement on abortion.

<HEAD>Air Force Proposes Three-Year Ban of Boeing Office</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Contract talks begin at 4:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing's government liaison office outside
Washington, D.C., has been suspended from signing new contracts
with the Pentagon because employees there obtained secret military
documents, Boeing said.
   The temporary suspension will last until authorities decide on
an Air Force recommendation to ban the office from doing business
with the military for up to three years, Boeing said Friday.
   Also Friday, a federal mediator scheduled negotiations in a
46-day strike by 57,000 Machinists that has virtually shut down
production lines at the aerospace giant.
   The Air Force suspension follows Boeing's guilty plea Monday in
U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., to two felony charges of
obtaining classified military budget documents. The company agreed
to pay $5.2 million in fines and restitution.
   Boeing will argue against the proposed three-year suspension of
its 100-person office in Rosslyn, Va., saying it strengthened
internal controls after a federal investigation in 1986, according
to spokesman Paul Binder.
   The case against Boeing involved classified documents obtained
between 1979 and 1985 by Richard Lee Fowler, a senior marketing
analyst who was fired in 1986. Fowler is awaiting trial next month
on 39 counts of conspiracy and unauthorized conveyance.
   Some of the documents involved studies of the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the proposed missile defense system known popularly as
Star Wars.
   The suspension of just one Boeing office may mean the Air Force
doesn't want to seriously impair Boeing's military business, said
retired Rear Adm. Eugene J. Carroll, of the Center for Defense
Information in Washington, D.C., a military watchdog group.
   ``I've never heard of debarring just one office,'' Carroll said.
``They've found a way to sound as if they're taking serious action,
knowing there will be ways around the barrier.''
   Boeing did $4.2 billion of business with the government during
the first nine months of 1989, but reported it is losing money on
its defense-related contracts.
   The strike talks called for this afternoon by federal mediator
Doug Hammond are the third round since the walkout by members of
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers
began Oct. 4.
   Union negotiators rejected Boeing's last three-year offer, which
included annual wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3
percent, plus bonuses, cuts in mandatory overtime and increases in
retirement benefits.
   The union represents about 57,800 Boeing workers, including
43,000 in the Seattle area; 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 in
Portland, Ore., and a few hundred others at scattered sites in
California, Hawaii, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and
elsewhere.

   Hot crude oil leaking from a pump
caught fire at the Chevron refinery here, sending a ball of flame
70 feet into the air, officials said.
   No injuries or deaths were reported in the blaze that began
Friday night and no refinery workers were missing, Chevron
spokesman Rod Spackman said today.
   ``I wouldn't call it an explosion _ but it was a large pop that
kind of scared us,'' said El Segundo Fire Capt. Eric Moore, one of
the first firefighters to arrive after the 7:50 p.m. alarm.
   A petroleum distillation unit was damaged, but no damage figures
were immediately available, Spackman said.
   Firefighters poured streams of water onto the flames within the
plant, a few miles south of Los Angeles International Airport.
   The fire erupted in the distillation unit of the refinery's
single largest crude oil processing plant, officials said.
   A seal failed on a primary pump feeding crude oil into the unit,
Spackman said. Oil spilled from the pump onto the concrete pad
surrounding the unit and somehow ignited.
   Police closed a heavily used boulevard to traffic for several
hours until refinery and fire officials determined that the area
was safe, although thick clouds of smoke continued to billow into
the night.
   The smoke was not toxic or hazardous, Spackman said.
   The refinery processes about 250,000 barrels a day of crude oil,
producing gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.

<HEAD>10 Suspected Drug Traffickers Arrested in Soldiers' Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have arrested 10 suspected drug
traffickers in the killings of seven soldiers and the head of a
federal police anti-narcotics group, the Attorney General's office
said.
   Its statement, released Friday, said the arrested men told
authorities their band put together heavily armed groups that
ambushed other drug traffickers, stole their drugs, and killed them.
   The office said the arrests were made Nov. 11, but it did not
say why they were not announced earlier.
   The soldiers' were shot to death Oct. 31 at a clandestine
airport in Santa Maria de Otaez, 600 miles northwest of Mexico City
in Durango state.
   A week later, Manuel Antonio Arias Palmeros, chief of a federal
judicial police unit, was killed and an agent with him seriously
wounded at a checkpoint outside Camargo, in the northwestern state
of Chihuahua.
   An investigation found Amado Levario Quiroz, a reputed drug
trafficker wanted in connection with other slayings, headed the
group that killed the eight, the attorney's office communique said.
   Levario Quiroz was killed Nov. 8, the day after the police chief
was slain, in a shootout with anti-narcotics police on a ranch near
Camargo.
   The attorney general's statement said the stolen drugs were
turned over to Levario Quiroz, who sold them in the United States.
   A Cessna airplane and six ranches belonging to him were seized,
the attorney general's statement said.
   The 10 suspects were taken for detention to Parral, Chihuahua.
Authorities are looking for more members of the band, the
attorney's office said.

   Authorities arrested four men and seized
half a ton of methamphetamine in what state Attorney General John
Van de Kamp said was the biggest seizure of the drug in history.
   At the rate of up to $10,000 a pound, the haul was worth nearly
$100 million, Vam de Kamp said Friday. ``The entire annual budget
of the San Francisco Police Department is $180 million,'' he said.
   The methamphetamine, or ``speed,'' was recovered in October from
a storage locker in Hayward, across the San Francisco Bay, Van de
Kamp said. Sixteen kilograms of cocaine also were seized.
   Methamphetamine, especially a smokeable version called ``ice,''
has grown increasingly popular in recent years on the West Coast.

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir said Soviet arms keep pouring into neighboring Syria and he
urged U.S. officials to remain loyal to longtime alliances despite
changing superpower relations.
   ``We cannot see yet in our region any signs of glasnost,''
Shamir said at a Los Angeles World Affairs Council luncheon Friday.
   In his speech and a question-and-answer session Shamir was
intent on showing the democracy movement in Eastern Europe hasn't
diminished the United States' need for longtime allies.
   ``Loyal and firm allies are important to every country and under
all circumstances. This applies especially to a superpower and
especially because of the constantly changing circumstances. Israel
is such an ally of the United States and our alliance is as
steadfast as ever,'' he said.
   Israel remains threatened by countries ``committed to the
annihilation of Israel'' and ``backed by forces as large as those
of NATO,'' he said.
   Syria alone can field 700,000 troops, more than 4,000 tanks and
650 fighter planes against Israel, Shamir said.
   ``Now it is absorbing another huge shipment of Soviet arms,
including the most modern attack planes.''
   Asked about Israel's reaction to the opening of the Berlin Wall
and the possibility of the reunification of Germany, Shamir said,
``Of course all of us are moved by these great changes'' but
reunification ``is not now on the international agenda.''
   On other issues, Shamir reiterated proposals from a May peace
initiative that calls for Arab-Israeli peace talks preceded by
elections ``that will produce a democratically chosen
representative leadership of the Palestinians.''
   Once again he ruled out talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which he dismissed as a terrorist organization.

<HEAD>Man Sues Because His Life Was Saved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An 83-year-old man sued a hospital for saving
his life, saying its refusal to let him die led to a crippling
stroke and paralysis.
   Before Edward H. Winter entered the St. Francis-St. George
hospital with chest pains in May 1988, he and his family decided
they didn't want extraordinary measures taken to preserve his life.
   To comply with those wishes, his doctor signed a ``no-code''
order telling hospital personnel not to perform any life-saving
methods.
   But when Winter suffered an attack, hospital workers ignored the
order and used electric shock to restart his heart, Winter's
attorney says.
   That effort was successful, but two days later Winter had a
severe stroke, leaving him paralyzed on the right side of his body
and dependent on others.
   In a lawsuit Friday in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court,
Winter's attorney, William C. Knapp, asked that the hospital
compensate Winter for damages and pay for his care at a nursing
home.
   ``Everyone had decided that if this was his time, this was his
time,'' said Knapp. ``They didn't let him die when they should
have.''
   The lawsuit charges hospital personnel with negligence for
ignoring the doctor's orders, and battery for using the efforts
they did to revive him.
   Knapp's wife died about 10 months before he entered the hospital.

<HEAD>Troops Told to Shoot Militiamen After Bloody Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Troops have been told to shoot to kill
members of a new Tamil militia after it attacked four eastern
police stations in battles that reportedly left 43 people dead, the
government said today.
   Eighteen guards were killed in the simultaneous attacks early
Friday in Ampara district, about 125 miles east of Colombo, the
state-run news agency Lankapuvath reported. Twenty-five members of
the militia were also reported killed.
   A government statement said the militia, known as the Tamil
National Army, has been declared an ``enemy of the country'' and
shoot-at-sight orders have been issued against its members.
   The militia is believed to have been set up by three former
rebel groups that now control the Northeastern Provincial Council,
the local government in the district.
   Although the militia was declared illegal, the government had
tolerated it. It was apparently set up to defend the provincial
council from attacks by rival Tamil groups, mainly the dominant
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   Fears of internecine fighting have been increasing with the
departure of Indian peacekeeping troops, who are to complete their
withdrawal from Sri Lanka by Dec. 31. Indian troops pulled out of
Ampara last month.
   In the first direct denouncement of the Tamil National Army and
its creators, Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne on Friday accused
the provincial council's chief minister Vartharaja Perumal of
creating the ``present situation.''
   ``We have information 13 unauthorized (militia) camps have been
set up in Ampara, trained by the Indian peacekeeping force and
armed by the chief minister,'' he told Parliament.
   Perumal ``has either gone mad or is being motivated to do
this,'' the minister said.
   ``If he cannot enforce law and order in the north and east, we
have people who can do this job,'' Wijeratne said.
   Indian officials in Colombo denied Indian troops had helped set
up the camps.
   Perumal, who heads the pro-Indian Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front, opposes withdrawal of Indian troops deployed in
northeastern Sri Lanka since July 30, 1987.
   The troops were dispatched under an Indian-Sri Lanka accord to
end a Tamil insurgency for a separate homeland. The agreement
provided limited autonomy to the Tamil minority.
   The provincial council also was set up under the accord, and
Perumal's group renounced separatism and joined mainstream
politics. The Tamil Tigers, however, reneged on the accord and
began attacking Indian soldiers.
   Days after the Indian troops withdrew from Ampara, the Tamil
Tigers attacked two Tamil National Army camps. At least 33 people
were killed.
   At least 10,000 Sri Lankans have been killed in the six-year-old
Tamil insurgency that stemmed from complaints of discrimination in
jobs and education by the Sinhalese majority.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese comprise 75 percent and control the government and the
military.

   Club-swinging riot police crushed
the largest anti-government rally in 20 years, injuring dozens of
people and arresting at least 100. A dissident called the
pro-democracy movement ``unstoppable.''
   The rally Friday began as a memorial service at the city's
Vysehrad Cathedral for a student killed by the Nazis 50 years ago.
   Reporters said tens of thousands of people were at the rally.
The state news agency CTK estimated the crowd at 15,000.
   Five hours later, riot police attacked the demonstrators as they
tried to march from the memorial service to downtown Wenceslas
Square. Witnesses said police used tear gas and filled more than
three buses with those arrested.
   At least 13 people were reported admitted to one Prague hospital
with concussions, and others were brought to at least two other
hospitals, where officials were ordered to withhold further details.
   As the demonstrators marched, they chanted slogans criticizing
hard-line Communist Party chief Milos Jakes. ``Dinosaurs, resign!''
they shouted. ``We want freedom and free elections! Communists get
out! End to one-party rule!''
   It was the largest public protest since August 1969, when crowds
gathered in downtown Prague a year after a Soviet-led invasion
smashed the reformist ``Prague spring'' led by Alexander Dubcek,
then Communist Party leader.
   Karel Srp, leader of the dissident Jazz Section, called the
rally the ``biggest and best demonstration I have ever seen, better
than in 1969 because the atmosphere is much better. We know that we
can win. This is unstoppable.''
   The memorial was organized by the official students'
organization in honor of Czech student Jan Opletal, killed during
an uprising 50 years ago against the Nazi occupation.
   Michael Schwarz, a staff photographer of The Atlanta Journal and
The Atlanta Constitution, said he went with the crowd trying to
march to downtown Wenceslas Square but was beaten on the head by
police and chased away.
   ``Many people were bleeding,'' said Schwarz, who saw about 12
ambulances taking people to hospitals. He also said he saw at least
three busloads of people being taken away by police. Rude Pravo,
the Communist Party daily, said about 100 people were taken to
police stations.
   Schwarz said police seized his camera and chased him away.
   Paula Butturini, a Warsaw-based correspondent of the Chicago
Tribune, required 15 stitches on her head, the paper said in
Chicago. She was treated at Prague's Na Frantisku hospital and then
released.
   Martin Klima, an independent student who addressed the rally,
declared: ``Oppression is worse than death! We should not only
remember the past with piety, we must care for the present and even
more for the future!''
   ``We must fight for freedom because you cannot live without
it,'' Klima said.
   Speakers representing the official student organizations urged
``constructive cooperation'' and were booed when they said the
people should ``rectify past mistakes.''
   Almost in unison, the crowd called out the question, ``Who is to
blame'' for the mistakes?
   When the crowd started moving toward the cathedral and its
cemetery, where the laying of flowers and candles was scheduled,
many students began shouting slogans against Jakes and others of
the aging leadership.
   ``You have lost already!'' the crowd yelled.
   State TV said some of the participants ``misused the mass
gathering for anti-socialist performances.''
   Some students at the rally shouted ``Masaryk!'' for Tomas
Garrigue Masaryk, who was Czechoslovakia's first president and is
credited with founding the country after the Austro-Hungarian
Empire collapsed in World War I.
   They also chanted the name of Jan Palach, a student who burned
himself to death to protest the Soviet-led invasion.
   On Wednesday, police permitted a demonstration by 1,000
environmentalists in downtown Prague but prevented 300-500 people
from marching to government headquarters.
   Czechoslovakia's hard-line leaders, who were installed after the
1968 invasion, have generally resisted the kinds of reforms adopted
in neighboring Communist nations. Earlier this week, they announced
that travel restrictions would be eased to allow people freer
movement to the West.

   Two drug suspects facing federal indictments in the
United States were extradited from Colombia today as part of a
continuing crackdown on drug trafficking in the South American
nation, authorities said.
   The U.S. Marshals Service took the pair into custody in Bogota,
Colombia, late Friday and transported them by jet to Miami early
today.
   Manuel Palma, 49, a Colombian native, was named in a Miami
indictment issued April 17, 1987, charging him with drug
trafficking and money laundering, said a news release from the
Marshals Service in Washington.
   Robert James Sokol, 29, was flown on to Greensboro, N.C., to
face a narcotics conspiracy indictment issued Nov. 26, 1984, the
release said.
   The indictments are part of a campaign started in August by the
Colombian government to attack the powerful drug cartels operating
the world's cocaine trade. The cartels responded with a campaign of
violence that has led to widespread bombings and attacks on
government officials and journalists.
   So far, none of the people extradited to the United States has
been among the dozen major traffickers sought by federal officials.

   Fernando Collor de Mello, the
conservative front-runner in the presidential election, looked for
allies today to beat back a leftist challenge in a runoff next
month.
   Collor de Mello, of the center-right National Reconstruction
Party, appeared to have won first place with 26.9 percent of
Wednesday's first-round vote, according to partial tallies released
today by the government's Superior Electoral Court.
   Marxist Rep. Luis Inacio Lula da Silva ran second with 15.9
percent, trailed by leftist populist Leonel Brizola with 15.6
percent, according to the official count.
   The tallies were based on 76 percent of the votes cast. The
government expected to have a final tally officially counted by
Sunday.
   The top two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff on
Dec. 17. The country is holding its first free presidential
elections in 29 years.
   In its own tallies, Globo TV, the nation's largest network,
showed Brizola in second, a half million votes ahead of da Silva.
It said its independent count was based on 80 percent of the vote.
   Both leftist candidates claimed slim victories, but both also
pledged to support the other in a runoff.
   Collor de Mello reportedly was seeking support on the left to
shake his image as the representative of conservatives and the
wealthy.
   The 40-year-old former governor acknowledged making contacts
with the top advisers of Sen. Mario Covas, the candidate of the
left-center Brazilian Social Democracy Party.
   He was running a strong fourth with 12 percent of the vote,
according to the official tally.
   Covas did not dismiss the possibility of a coalition, saying,
``It is not up to me, but for the party to decide.''
   But he sounded skeptical. ``Everyone knows the PSDB is a
center-left party, and that should indicate certain things,'' he
said in the radio interview Friday.
   Also Friday, Roberto Della Manna, director of the powerful
Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo State, said in a published
interview that businessmen were solidly behind Collor de Mello.
   ``Lula and Brizola, especially Lula, would be a step backward
from modernization,'' Federation spokesman Luis Carlos Granadero
said.
   Ex-labor leader da Silva, of the radical-left Workers' Party,
appeared relaxed Friday in television interviews at his home in Sao
Bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo.
   ``Our projections show us winning by 1 to 1.5 million votes,''
he said. ``We are now looking ahead to our strategy in the second
round.''
   However, Brizola's Labor Party released projections showing
Collor de Mello with 23 percent of the vote, Brizola with 18
percent, and da Silva with 17 percent.
   Brizola refused to speak to reporters Friday and remained inside
his home in Rio's beachfront neighborhood of Copacabana.

   A fire raged out of control today
in a coal mine one day after a gas explosion and fire killed 92
miners. Authorities arrested four workers who may have sparked the
blast.
   Experts had recommended closing the mine five years ago because
of a series of fatal accidents. The republic declared three days of
mourning.
   The fire in a shaft deep underground will have to be
extinguished before rescue teams can begin recovering the bodies,
said a rescue coordinator.
   The latest casualty figure was announced to reporters by Radmilo
Bogdanovic, minister of interior of the Yugoslav republic of
Serbia, in which the mine is located. Most were believed to have
died from poisonous fumes.
   Seventy-three workers in other parts of the mine escaped without
injury, mine director Branislav Mandusic said.
   Bogdanovic also said four people who were working on the mine's
conveyor equipment, where the fire started Friday, have been
arrested. There have been reports that the blaze began after an
improper welding job.
   The fire at the Aleksinacki Rudnici brown coal mine, 125 miles
south of Belgrade, the capital, was the worst mining disaster in
Serbia, said the rescue coordinator, an engineer who requested
anonymity. The mine is ``the most inflammable in Yugoslavia due to
high concentrations of methane gas,'' he said.
   He said that five years ago a commission of experts recommended
the mine be closed, after a string of fatal accidents that
culminated in the death of 38 miners in June 1983.
   The blaze Friday broke out at noon as coal transport equipment
was being welded in a shaft about 2,100 feet deep, Mandusic told
the official Tanjug news agency. The blaze cut off the main access
shaft of the mine.
   The government of Serbia met today to set up a commission to
investigate the cause of the disaster. Belgrade radio indicated an
initial finding suggests that safety regulations were violated
during the welding operations.
   On Friday, white smoke rising from the mine was visible from at
least 1 mile away. Only authorized personnel were allowed to
approach the mine while police kept relatives, newsmen and
photographers well away from the pit.
   Relatives, some sobbing softly, huddled nearby in the sub-zero
temperatures.
   Rescuers told The Associated Press during the night that with
the fire still burning, temperatures were too high for them to get
all the way through to the trapped men.
   ``Coal dust and methane gas are still burning fiercely, and it
could take a long time to put it out,'' said Slobodan Stefanovic.
He was carrying breathing equipment.
   The radio broadcast said all but 20 of the victims had families
and that the government will provide $333 in financial assitance to
each family. The radio gave the number of a bank account for
voluntary contributions to the families of the dead miners.
   The worst mining accidents in Yugoslavia were both at the
Bosnian coal mine at Kakanj and both involved methane gas
explosions. In 1934, a total of 127 people were killed, and 128
miners died there in 1965.

   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy today
presented his credentials to an aide to President Rene Mouawad,
underscoring Washington's backing for the new head of state.
   Also today, a small bomb exploded outside the home of Parliament
member Khatchig Babikian, causing damage but no casualties, police
said.
   It was the seventh attack on the property of a Christian
parliamentarian since the legislators defied Christian army Gen.
Michel Aoun and elected Mouawad this month as part of an Arab
League-sponsored peace plan for the civil war. None of the previous
blasts caused casualties.
   Sources close to Mouawad reported earlier today that McCarthy
drove to Syrian-policed north Lebanon and presented his credentials
to the new leader at his home in Ehden, a mountain resort in the
Cedars Mountains.
   However, it was later learned that McCarthy gave his credentials
to a Foreign Ministry official, Salah Staitiyeh, at Mouawad's home.
   Protocol dictates that the ministry receive ambassadors'
credentials first. Officials said that on Sunday morning McCarthy
will present his credentials to Mouawad in a formal ceremony.
Mouawad was elected Nov. 5.
   In Washington, a State Department official confirmed that
McCarthy had presented his credentials in Ehden but gave no further
details.
   McCarthy, whose embassy in Beirut closed last month after Aoun
supporters surrounded it, drove in a five-car convoy to Ehden from
Damascus, the Syrian capital, according to Mouawad aides, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   One source said Prime Minister-designate Salim Hoss, a Sunni
Moslem, and Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem,
will attend the ceremony Sunday, highlighting the three top
leaders' effort to work together.
   The United States has supported Mouawad's election on Nov. 5 in
a special Parliament session held in north Lebanon after Aoun's
threats to shell the chamber in Beirut. It also has welcomed
Parliament's approval of an Arab League-brokered plan for
Christian-Moslem coexistence after 14 years of civil war. The
accord shifts political power to the Moslem majority.
   Aoun has rejected Mouawad's election and the peace plan, mainly
because it did not include a fixed timetable for the evacuation of
40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon. Aoun fought the Syrians, the
Moslems' main backers, for six months this year in battles that
killed thousands of people. He says the Syrians, who entered
Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate, are an
occupying force.
   Washington, a traditional backer of the Christians, has accused
Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, of complicating the peace march, and
urged him to recognize Mouawad.
   Mouawad's election ended a political vacuum that prevailed after
President Amin Gemayel's term expired Sept. 22, 1988, with
Parliament unable to elect a successor.
   Aoun emerged as head of a Christian Cabinet, while Hoss, who
served under Gemayel, led a Moslem government during that period.

   More than 50,000 people chanting ``We
want democracy!'' today staged the largest protest rally in the
history of Communist Bulgaria, one day after Parliament scrapped a
law forbidding dissent.
   The crowd carried hundreds of banners and sketches, some showing
longtime Communist leader Todor Zhivkov behind bars and with an
Adolf Hitler mustache painted over his face. The hard-line Zhivkov
was forced out last week.
   At the end of the three-hour demonstration, the crowd adopted
with a show of hands a declaration calling for an end to corruption
and police repression, the abandoning of censorship, the release of
political prisoners and guarantees for freedom of religion.
   The emotional gathering, organized by unofficial human rights
and ecological groups, was held on a vast downtown square in front
of the Aleksander Nevski Orthodox Cathedral in cold but sunny
weather.
   ``This is the return of democracy in Bulgaria, and a miracle we
have not seen for 45 years,'' Hristofor Sebec, a priest and a
member of the independent ecological group Ecoglasnost, said in an
interview.
   ``Bulgaria is going toward democracy, maybe even a multiparty
system. It will not be easy to reach that goal, but we will
manage,'' Petar Beron, a senior leader of Ecoglasnost, said in an
interview.
   Hundreds of uniformed policemen, some sitting in buses at a
distance, watched the crowd and listened to the fiery speeches
without intervening.
   The 78-year-old Zhivkov, who resigned Nov. 10 as Communist Party
chief, was replaced by former Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov.
   The 400-member Parliament on Friday voted unanimously by a show
of hands for Mladenov, 53, to replace Zhivkov as head of state also.
   The election and the pro-democracy demonstrations in Bulgaria
indicate the hard-line Communist state may be ready to embrace the
reform movement that has led to dramatic changes in the Soviet
Union, Poland, Hungary and East Germany.
   Mladenov said in a French television interview broadcast Friday
that he supports holding free elections.
   Government approval of today's rally was a gesture by the
Mladenov government to show his leadership is committed to some
change.
   Under Zhivkov's rule, only official rallies were allowed. On
Friday, the National Assembly eliminated a paragraph, Article 273,
from the penal code that had been used to suppress dissent. That
article provided punishment for anyone deemed to have slandered the
government or party.
   During Parliament's session Friday, the first-ever broadcast
live in postwar Bulgaria, deputies leveled harsh criticism at
Zhivkov.
   One legislator, Slavcho Trnski, said Zhivkov led a ``flamboyant
lifestyle,'' owning more than 30 residences.
   An officially organized rally Friday in support of Mladenov drew
10,000 people, after which about 500 people demonstrated
independently with many chanting for democracy and shouting ``Down
with the murderers!''
   In today's demonstration, independent and police estimates put
the crowd at more than 50,000. Some of the banners read, ``We are
the victims of repression,'' ``Christ is Our Savior,'' ``My family
has nothing to eat'' and ``Freedom and Democracy Now.''
   The crowd shouted, ``We want free elections!,'' ``We want a new
constitution!'' and ``Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!'' It called
out the name of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, popular in Bulgaria for his
economic and political reform program. Mladenov's name was also
occasionally heard.
   ``The single-party system is the symbol of totalitarian rule,''
said Radoy Ralin, Bulgaria's best known writer of satire and other
prose and one of 15 speakers, who addressed the crowd from the
church's steps.
   For such public comments Bulgarians would almost certainly have
ended up in jail only a few weeks ago, said one of the activists.
   ``Todor Zhivkov has left us with empty shops, corruption,
bureaucracy and despair,'' said Petko Simeonov, a prominent
sociologist and a leading member of Ecoglasnost.
   He demanded criminal investigation and court action against
Zhivkov, echoing demands already heard during Friday's official
rally in downtown Sofia.
   The crowd responded by shouting ``Zhivkov to court!'' and ``Down
with Zhivkov and his aides!''
   Simeonov also called for ``immediate free election and freedom
of speech'' to the cheers of the crowd, who chanted ``Izbori,
izbori!'' (elections, elections).
   On Friday, Mladenov vowed to implement reforms. He told
Parliament that the command and bureaucratic system are beginning
to shake'' and fresh air of changes has entered the political
atmosphere.''
   The National Assembly adopted several government changes that
cleared out some hard-line Zhivkov supporters and restructured some
ministries to focus greater attention on the flagging economy and
the environment _ an issue of considerable popular concern.

   East Germany's Parliament today approved a
reform-minded Cabinet, launched an inquiry into official
corruption, and named a panel to study constitutional changes that
could end the Communist monopoly on power.
   In Leipzig, thousands of activists held a peaceful rally
demanding free elections now that would give voters a chance to
remove the Communists from power. East German state-run television
said up to 50,000 people attended, but an Associated Press reporter
on the scene estimated the crowd at 10,000.
   The turnout was lower than expected in the southern industrial
city where crowds of 300,000 and more have been protesting for
weeks. Many residents apparently decided they would rather shop or
sightsee in West Germany than attend today's rally, organized by
the New Forum opposition group.
   Elsewhere, more than a million East Germans poured into West
Berlin and West Germany, window-shopping or snacking on bratwurst
to celebrate the second weekend of their new-found freedom to
travel.
   The endorsement of the 28-member Cabinet gave new Premier Hans
Modrow the go-ahead to embark on a reform course that embraces many
principles of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika
reform program.
   The Cabinet gives 11 seats to non-Communist allies but retains
the key posts in foreign affairs, defense and economic matters for
the Communists.
   There were five ``no'' votes and six abstentions in the
500-member People's Chamber in the Cabinet vote broadcast live on
television.
   The committee set up by Parliament will study possible
constitutional changes. Manfred Gerlach, president of the Liberal
Democratic Party, has said he will ask for a change that would
remove Article 1 that guarantees the Communists' leading role.
Another panel was set up to prepare an election law. The Communist
leadership has promised free balloting but has not set a date.
   Parliament also formed a committee to investigate cases of
corruption, personal enrichment and abuse of power.
   The moves were the latest in a series of recent momentous
changes that have rewritten the politics of East Germany.
   They include massive pro-democracy protests, the replacement of
hard-line Communist Party leader Erich Honecker with Egon Krenz,
the opening of the Berlin Wall and Parliament's election of the
reform-minded Modrow.
   Almost half of the 1.2 million East Germans who came West late
Friday were in West Berlin, city officials said.
   Although the city was busier than usual, there was little of the
tumultuous street party atmosphere that engulfed the western sector
a week ago.
   ``We'd like to stay all night and make a party,'' said East
Berliner Ellen Eversberg, 18. ``But already we can see a party here
costs a lot of money.''
   The official ADN news agency reported that some trains carrying
passengers from East to West Berlin were ``recklessly stormed'' by
impatient travelers who filled the cars two or three times over
capacity.
   ADN said the moving trains had to be slowed for safety reasons,
and 72 additional trains were put into service to ease the crush.
   Marked-down merchandise and makeshift stands hawking cheap
leather handcrafts cluttered the normally stylish Kurfuerstendamm
boulevard today as businesses changed gears to meet demands from
visiting East Germans.
   The city's main shopping boulevard is usually the scene of posh
promenades, with decked-out couples poring over designer window
displays and walking well-groomed pets.
   Portable toilets were set out at main intersections for the
throngs of shoppers, who combed stores and sidewalk booths for
bargains that could pay for at least in part with their $55
handouts from Bonn.
   The West German government gives the ``welcome money'' to each
East German visitor once a year as a gift that gives them a chance
to sample Western wares.
   Tables and sales bins bearing barettes, pins, bracelets and
plastic watches crowded the broad sidewalks that were teeming with
shoppers.
   After East Germany's abrupt decision on Nov. 9 to let its
citizens travel freely, 1.3 million East Germans rushed to West
Berlin, a city already crowded with 2 million residents. East
German officials punched new crossings in the Berlin Wall to
accommodate the crunch.
   American troops at the U.S. Army base at Mariendorf in West
Berlin set up a soup kitchen, at the request of the West German
authorities, to feed 1,400 East German families who want to stay in
the West.
   Most of the East Germans who visit over the weekend will return
home, but government reception centers were prepared for those who
will not go back.
   In his first speech to Parliament since becoming premier Monday,
Modrow on Friday outlined a mix of free enterprise and socialist
planning to rescue East Germany from its economic morass. Modrow
called for more formal relations with West Germany, which has
offered aid to East Germany in return for its conversion to a more
market-oriented economy.
   ``We are waiting now for the other side to respond,'' Modrow
told the legislators in his two-hours speech.
   West German officials were cautious, saying the proposal for
greater cooperation lacked details.
   In his call for improving relations with West Germany, the
premier said the two countries could act on security, environmental
protection and other matters of common interest. But he drew a long
round of applause when he denounced reunification of the two
Germanies.
   Modrow's recovery plan appears to follow the course taken by the
Soviets over the past four years, which allows only limited private
enterprise. His address was approved unanimously by Parliament.

   There are plenty of want ads for plumbers in
the West Berlin papers, but being on the maintenance crew at the
House of Ministries in East Berlin is still the best guarantee of
the good life for Uwe Doering.
   ``When we saw all the beautiful things in the West, they were
very alluring,'' his girlfriend, Gabi Lamper, said Thursday. ``But
that doesn't mean we should leave home.''
   The couple and their 13-month-old son, Tom, were among the 99
percent of East German visitors to the West who have gawked at the
West German economic miracle in the past week and then returned
home.
   While the new travel freedom and political reforms in East
Germany dazzle the couple, their priorities are home, family and
the security of staying put.
   For the 26-year-old plumber, who joined the Communist Party as
an idealistic teen-ager, politics have taken a back seat to
economic considerations.
   Despite the cascade of changes in their country and their visit
to West Berlin one week ago, the big event in their lives is next
week's move into a new three-bedroom apartment.
   For both of them, the new apartment is a symbol of what is right
with East Germany _ a social system that Doering trusts to take
care of him and his family with guaranteed jobs and housing.
   ``People in West Berlin are jobless, on the dole,'' said
Doering, sprawled on a sofa and sipping a beer.
   ``Even though they get money, I wouldn't want my family to live
in a hotel, or a hole in the wall, if I can have a three-bedroom
apartment here and a job.''
   The couple spoke through an intepreter to The Associated Press
at their one-bedroom apartment in Prenzlauerberg, a working-class
section of East Berlin.
   Doering saved all his pay from three years' army service, which
enabled them to buy the television, stereo and the furniture that
fills half their 12-by-12 foot living room.
   ``I could afford the television because I sold my motorcycle,''
Doering joked. ``Three people don't fit on a motorbike.''
   Last year, Doering bought a 1968 East German-made Trabant, which
both he and Ms. Lamper drive.
   Now the house is too small, with Tom's playpen and toys. The
baby sleeps in a crib at the foot of his parents' bed in their
cramped 5-by-12 foot bedroom.
   Other signs of prosperity jammed into their third-floor walk-up
apartment include a washing machine, oversized refrigerator, food
processer and electric bread slicer.
   They count themselves lucky that they were able to get a new
apartment allocation from the government in just a year. Doering
remembers when life was different.
   ``I came to Berlin in 1970 with my family,'' he said with a
grimace. ``At that time, we were four people living in a one-room
apartment. It was a terrible time.''
   He and Ms. Lamper openly admit to playing along with the
Communist system for their benefit.
   For example, the new apartment might have taken three years to
get if Doering had not kept his own one-bedroom apartment when he
moved into what was his girlfriend's place three years ago.
   The combination of two one-person apartments to trade, and their
new child to consider, was enough to swing the odds in their favor.
   Now Ms. Lamper is looking for a day-care center, or a creche,
for Tom. Until she finds one, ``I get 700 marks ($35) a month for
doing nothing,'' she said.
   ``It's easier to get a creche when you're an unmarried mother,''
she said. ``In that way the GDR (German Democratic Republic) is
really a socialist state. They take care of unmarried mothers.''
   Ms. Lamper banks her money each month, and the family lives on
Doering's pay, which comes to about 1,100 marks a month, worth
about $60 at the unofficial exchange rate.
   Their apartment costs 47 marks a month, the equivalent of about
$2.50, and utilities run 20 marks a month.
   They spend about 20 marks a day on food and rarely see shortages
of meat and vegetables anymore.
   Doering said he joined the Communist Party at 18 out of a sense
of duty after being impressed by a rehabilitation plan for criminal
offenders in a factory where he worked.
   ``My mind has changed completely over the past years,'' he said.
``The confidence they have broken has to be rebuilt. The economy
has to be right, and it doesn't matter under which party.''
   Freedom to travel was ``the first step in the right direction,''
Doering said. ``Now, if a few more things change, life could be
really fine.''

   As political upheavals in Eastern Europe
continue, China is stepping up calls to preserve its own
conservative brand of socialism.
   Prominent editorials in newspapers have urged the ``perfection''
of socialism by rejecting political pluralism and denouncing the
most salient principle of capitalism: private ownership.
   Hungary has disbanded its Communist Party; East Germany, Poland
and Bulgaria have installed new reform-minded leaderships;
Czechoslovakia has replaced hard-liners in the Politburo with
moderates. But China is proving to be doctrinaire, stressing that
the conservative socialist path is best.
   ``Economic reform must on no account take the road of private
ownership, and the political reform must on no account take the
road leading to a multi-party or diversified political system,''
said the People's Daily, the main publication of China's Communist
Party.
   ``The ongoing policies of reform and opening further to the
outside world must stick to the socialist orientation,'' said the
commentary, written by Beijing University's president, Wu Shuqing,
and printed Friday.
   ``If the reform deviates from the socialist orientation and
follows the mode set by foreign hostile forces and those engaged in
advocating bourgeois liberalism (Western ideals), ... the socialist
cause and the great achievements China has obtained over the past
40 years will be destroyed in a moment,'' Wu wrote.
   Wu was installed as head of China's most prestigious university
in August, following a pro-democracy movement led by students, many
from Beijing University.
   China's brush with the call for democratic reforms was brutally
put down by the Chinese army in June in a crackdown which left
hundreds, and possibly thousands, of civilians dead.
   Since then, the government has intensified its criticism of the
West's liberal influences and exhorted Chinese to unite under the
party.
   Deng's early reforms included reviving the family farm and
allowing farmers to sell crops above state quotas for a profit and
to sometimes branch into private business.
   But at a time when democratic and capitalistic principles are
gaining the upper hand in traditionally hard-line Eastern Europe,
private ownership has come under fire in China as undermining the
socialist state.
   ``Privatization of state-owned assets under China's current
circumstances will inevitably create bureaucratic capitalism in the
country,'' a commentary in the journal Economic Research said.
   ``Instead of saving the country, bureaucratic capitalism can
only drive the masses of the Chinese people into an abyss of
misery,'' said the commentary, reprinted Saturday in the official
China Daily.
   ``In all human history, there has been only one case in which a
society of public ownership changed into a private one. And that
happened when the primitive communist society evolved into a slave
society,'' the Economic Research commentary said.
   ``If the public assets of today's China were privatized in a
short period of time, as hoped for by advocates, power could mean
greater opportunities for plundering public assets,'' it said.
   Wu, in his commentary, noted that proponents maintain that
private ownership fosters efficiency, while under public ownership
few concern themselves with economic development.
   But, he said, ``China and many other countries which have taken
the road of public ownership have developed their economies much
more quickly than many of the countries which have private
ownership systems since the second World War.''
   All shortcomings of public ownership system can be rectified
through reform, he said.

   A passenger bus collided with a

ravine and killing 12 people and wounding 21, officials said.
   Mito Lopez, a spokesman for the Fortune Bus Company, said the
accident took place in the town of Kauswagan in Lanao del Norte
province, about 490 miles southeast of Manila.
   Lopez said the bus was on a sharp curve en route to Iligan from
the adjacent province of Zamboanga del Sur when it hit the minibus
coming from the opposite direction.
   The impact threw both vehicles into a 30-foot-deep ravine, Lopez
said. The dead included two Fortune passengers and the driver, and
nine people in the other vehicle.
   He said records of how many people were on both vehicles were
unavailable.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said today
he expected next month's U.S.-Soviet summit to lay the groundwork
for greater economic cooperation between the superpowers.
   Shevardnadze said he believed President Bush would seek ``a more
basic, deeper understanding of what is happening in the Soviet
economy'' when he meets with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
near Malta in the Mediterranean.
   Bush and U.S. business leaders want to be ``convinced of the
stability of Soviet society ... and on the basis of such a
conviction, of such a conception, to build large-scale economic
cooperation,'' Shevardnadze said.
   The Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit has no set agenda, and
Shevardnadze said no proposed treaties were being prepared for the
summit and no signing of agreements was expected. But ``there could
definitely be major agreements, I don't rule that out,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Along with giving Bush his views on the Soviet economy,
Gorbachev also wants to discuss some of the shortcomings of the
U.S. economy, particularly the question of massive loans it is owed
by Third World countries.
   ``That is question No. 1, I would say, both for the United
States and for the Third World,'' Shevardnadze said. ``This is one
of the questions which demand serious attention.''
   Soviet and U.S. officials have ruled out the idea of the United
States offering aid to the Soviet Union as it has to Eastern
European countries to encourage reforms. However, Soviets have
complained that America could offer more incentive to its
businessmen to invest in the Soviet economy.
   In an example of the kind of breaks the Soviets are looking for,
U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said Thursday the expected
quick easing of Soviet emigration restrictions will open up the
Soviet Union for most-favored-nation trade status with the United
States.
   Shevardnadze said the two leaders would also discuss a wide
range of issues, including recent changes in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Clinics: Pa. Abortion Law To Affect Poor, Teen-agers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania's new abortion law, the most
restrictive in the nation, will most heavily affect poor or
otherwise disadvantaged women and those living in rural areas,
clinic directors say.
   ``It will have an intimidating and chilling effect on those
women who are most vulnerable. ... It will impact on the least
intelligent, the least financially well off and the least stable
relationships the most severely,'' said Sylvia Stengle of the
Allentown Women's Center.
   Supporters of the bill signed Friday by Gov. Robert P. Casey
counter that discouraging abortion is exactly what they want the
bill to do, since in their view it is the taking of human life.
   Clinic directors predict that teen-agers and poor women, already
confused by the abortion controversy and affected by a lack of
state funds for abortions, will suffer by being forced to obtain
abortions in neighboring states or illegally after the law goes
into effect in mid-January.
   ``We're going to be seeing teen-agers already having trouble
finding abortions ... saying goodbye to Pennsylvania,'' said Shawn
Murphy, regional director of Planned Parenthood of Northeast
Pennsylvania.
   Carol Wall of Planned Parenthood Southeastern in Philadelphia
said the law would result in ``fewer people in our clinics and more
people would be forced, through the concern for all this, to go to
illegal abortion.''
   Pennsylvania is the first state to enter a gateway opened by the
U.S. Supreme Court in July when it upheld certain restrictions in
Missouri abortion law, including a ban on the use of public
facilities for abortion.
   The Pennsylvania law goes further, and could be subject to more
court battles.
   It requires a woman wait 24 hours and notify her husband before
getting an abortion, bans abortions based on a fetus' sex, and bans
abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except to save the life
of the mother or prevent ``substantial and irreversible'' harm.
   The law also carries stiff penalties for doctors who violate the
regulations. A conviction under the sex-selection ban or 24-week
provision could result in up to seven years in prison and $15,000
in fines.
   State Rep. Stephen Freind, a Republican who sponsored the law,
said, ``If doctors are less prone to kill unborn children, that
would be a wonderful offshoot of the bill.''
   Freind has said provisions of the law were designed to directly
challenge Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that established
abortion as a constitutional right in 1973.
   Among the other provisions, the law requires physicians to
discuss risks of abortion and alternatives with women, as well as
provide information on the abortion. Directors say such discussions
have typically been handled by counselors.
   ``Doctors aren't trained to do that; they are medical
personnel,'' said Elizabeth Hrenda-Roberts of Planned Parenthood
Pennsylvania Affiliates. ``It's expensive for us, and a waste for
us, to use doctors to do counseling.''
   The concerns about rural and poor women involve the 24-hour
waiting period. Clinic directors said rural women often must drive
50 miles or more, and the waiting provision will add an extra trip
or lodging expenses to the cost of abortions, which run between
$250 and $300.
   Critics of spousal notification say it is unfair and
unenforceable. Clinics are not required to verify a married woman's
statement that her husband was informed.
   The 24-week restriction requires a woman to carry a fetus to
term unless it endangers her life or could cause ``irreversible''
harm. Those affected, directors said, will be women who discover
birth defects or potentially fatal abnormalities in their fetuses
late in term.
   According to the state Health Department, there were about
50,000 abortions in Pennsylvania last year. One abortion was
performed after 27 weeks and 127 were performed between 23 and 27
weeks, according to the records.
   Abortions have gradually declined in the state since the early
1980s, and clinic officials say the new law will further discourage
doctors from performing them.

army sergeant and his wife were wounded in a car bombing in eastern
England, police said.
   The three soldiers were on patrol in a Land-Rover near
Mayobridge, a rural area six miles from the border with the Irish
Republic, when the bomb exploded, the Royal Ulster Constabulary
said. Unconfirmed reports said a fourth soldier was seriously
injured, but no other details were immediately available.
   The off-duty sergeant suffered serious leg injuries and his wife
received less serious, unspecified injuries when a car bomb
exploded at the British army's headquarters in eastern England,
Essex police said.
   No group claimed responsibility for either attack. But suspicion
fell on the Irish Republican Army, which has often targeted the
security forces in its campaign to end British rule in Northern
Ireland and unite the mainly Protestant province with the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   Police and Home Office Secretary David Waddington blamed the IRA
for the Colchester attack. The explosion there came less than 24
hours after Defense Secretary Tom King visited the Royal Anglian
Regiment at the Goojerat Barracks in the town, which is 50 miles
northeast of London. King was Northern Ireland secretary until a
Cabinet reshuffle in July.
   The sergeant and his wife were taken to Colchester General
Hospital. A Ministry of Defense spokesman, speaking anonymously,
said the sergeant suffered very serious leg wounds.
   An army spokesman, also speaking anonymously in keeping with
British custom, said the explosion involved a car in the married
quarters at the barracks and touched off a fire.
   Kim Bryan, son of the manager of the local pub, told Independent
Radio News that his mother ran up the road after hearing the
explosion and saw the car on fire and two people inside. They were
pulled out by others who rushed to the scene.
   Police and the army sealed off part of the town, the
third-largest garrison town in Britain, and with its Roman links,
the oldest. Homes near the scene of the blast were evacuated as
bomb squad officers conducted an investigation.
   About 4,500 troops are based at Colchester, which is army
headquarters for the 11-county eastern district and home of the
19th Infantry Brigade. Many civilians in the town are employed by
the military.
   The Ministry of Defense stepped up security at barracks and
military establishments across Britain following the IRA bombing
Sept. 22 at the Royal Marines Music School in Deal, which killed 11
men.
   The IRA also has claimed responsibility for a spate of bomb and
gun attacks on British servicemen and their families stationed in
West Germany. A soldier's wife was killed this summer and a
6-month-old girl died last month with her father, a Royal Air Force
corporal, in an IRA car bombing.

   An early morning blaze gutted a trailer in a
rural area today, killing a mother, her five children and three
other children, authorities said.
   Two adults escaped, one of them the mother of three of the
children who had to be restrained from re-entering the blazing
trailer, neighbors and officials said.
   ``She was hollering, `My babies! My babies!' She wanted to go
back in and get them,'' said Angie Locklear, who lives across the
road from the trailer.
   The fire erupted about 4 a.m. on one of the first cold nights of
the season and quickly engulfed a single trailer sitting on a
wooded lot off a rural dirt road, said Robeson County sheriff's
dispatcher Gene Lambert.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   Locklear said she heard some sort of explosion and first thought
it was a gunshot, but ``when I looked out, all I could see were
flames.''
   She said a woman and a man ran out of trailer. When the woman
tried to return to rescue her children, the man restrained her.
   Neighbors said the woman was a relative of Lois Ann Hunt, 32,
the only victim who was immediately identified.
   Mrs. Hunt's five children ranged in age from 1{ to 12 years old,
while the visiting youngsters included an infant and a sixth- or
seventh-grader, neighbors said.
   Fire officials remained on the scene late this morning, sifting
through the cinders of the mobile home.
   The two survivors were treated for minor burns and injuries
suffered in the blaze and released, said Scotland Memorial Hospital
emergency room Dr. Lloyd McCaskill.

   Romania has begun severely restricting
travel in both directions across its border with Hungary and has
removed its own citizens from trains, a senior official of the
Hungarian border guards said today.
   It was not known whether the Romanian move was linked to a
congress of the ruling Communist Party starting in Bucharest on
Monday. The congress is expected to reconfirm in office hard-line
Communist Party chief and President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``For some reason, starting Friday afternoon, the Romanian
border guards have been turning back at the border people trying to
enter Romania,'' said Lt. Col. Laszlo Fenyoe.
   Asked whether those denied entry were given any reasons by the
Romanians, Fenyoe said, ``They are being told that the hotels are
full.''
   ``Those being turned away include not only Hungarians but also
Czechoslovaks, Turks, Dutch, West Germans, Poles, you name it,''
Fenyoe said.
   Between 6 a.m. and noon today, 873 people were planning to enter
Romania, but only 515 of them were allowed in, he said. More than
200 cars also were involved.
   At least 70 people were taken off a train leaving Romania for
the West, and several were subjected to body searches, according to
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not known how
many were allowed to proceed.
   Relations between Hungary and Romania, two Warsaw Pact allies,
have greatly deteriorated this year, chiefly because the Hungarian
government has accused Romania of discriminating against the 1.7
million ethnic Hungarians who claim that they are denied essential
rights as a minority.
   Ceausescu, who rejects all political and economic reform, also
has expressed disdain for the fast-moving changes under way in
neighboring Hungary and other East European countries.
   At the Romanian Embassy in Budapest, a duty officer said the
embassy has not been notified about any problems involving border
crossings.

<HEAD>Swedish Mix of Capitalism and Socialism Studied by East Europeans</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the 1930s, Sweden's mix of
capitalism and socialism became a model for reformers seeking to
protect the worker in the profit-hungry industrial West.
   Now, Eastern Europeans breaking free of Marxist economics and
stifling central planning are studying the Scandinavian way of
doing things.
   A parade of visitors has marched through Scandinavia from
Hungary, Poland, the Baltic republics and the Soviet Union itself,
and the questions they ask highlight how difficult their transition
will be to economic freedom.
   ``The Swedish model has interested us for a long time, now more
than ever, both on a practical and theoretical level,'' said
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union in a
written reply to questions from a Swedish newspaper last week.
   Reszo Nyers, Hungarian Socialist Party leader and architect of
Hungary's economic reforms, said in Stockholm there is ``a lot for
us to pay attention to concerning the Swedish model, such as how
Sweden combines a market economy and the state at the same time
takes responsibility for social solutions.''
   Bankers, company managers, government leaders and economic
planners are among those coming here. Often they seek investment
and joint ventures. More often, they just want advice on how to
cope and compete in a free market.
   The Swedish model, or what was called 50 years ago ``the middle
way,'' refers to the merging of a vigorous capitalist-based private
industry with all-embracing egalitarian welfare programs, financed
by taxes designed to reduce the gap between rich and poor.
   In the drive to strip the Communist party of total power, East
bloc visitors show interest in Sweden's muscular labor unions and
its strong municipalities, which take the bulk of tax revenues and
handle most public services.
   Sweden's government-run retraining program is being keenly
studied by Poland, which faces a grim prospect of massive
unemployment, according to a Swedish government official involved
in the contacts. He was interviewed on condition he was not
identified.
   Poland has been warned by the International Monetary Fund that
economic revitalization could initially mean one of every three
Polish workers without a job. ``They know this is not a good way to
start on the road to democracy,'' this official said.
   Sweden restructured its economy in the 1970s, phasing out
unprofitable shipbuilding and other heavy industries while giving
top priority to retraining workers and keeping employment levels
high.
   Today, the Swedish inflation rate is higher than in most of
Europe, above 6 percent, but unemployment is an enviable 1.5
percent.
   Though Sweden's Social Democrats are credited with creating the
model Welfare State, all postwar Scandinavian countries embrace it.
   Finland and Sweden, admired as prosperous and efficient, have
the additional appeal of being neutral, while Norway and Denmark
belong to the NATO military alliance.
   East bloc economic leaders have been traveling elsewhere in
Western Europe, seeking capitalistic wisdom and an infusion of aid.
   ``It's not only us,'' said the Swedish official. ``But it's hard
for a Pole to turn to West Germany, for political and historical
reasons,'' he said.
   Traffic has been heaviest to Finland, which has one of the
fastest growing economies in Europe this decade. Helsinki has a
friendship treaty with the Soviet Union and a long history of
economic links. The Finns also are culturally and linguistically
related to Estonians.
   The other Scandinavian countries have large East European
refugee populations.
   On a visit to Finland last month, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
of the Soviet Union suggested to Finnish industrialists that they
set up a management training program for Soviet factory directors.
   Similar projects are being arranged privately. The Danish
Chamber of Commerce has invited 30 company directors from Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania to attend management courses in Copenhagen
next spring.
   ``They are well educated people, as engineers and technicians.
But they don't know anything about consumer or industrial
marketing, exhibiting, transportation, appointing agents,'' said
Vagn Jensen, deputy director of the Chamber of Commerce.
   The Baltic states also want to step up business contacts in
Scandinavia for hard-cash reasons: under Soviet law, they are
allowed to use export income in the currencies of neighboring
countries to buy imports.
   So far, the Scandinavians have been wary of investing in the
shaky Eastern economies. Businessmen demand guarantees that their
governments have been unwilling to give.
   But attitudes are changing, says Tor Oestboe, senior vice
president of the Export Finance A@S in Oslo, which is owned by
Norway's commercial banks.
   ``We are working on a new finance agreement with the Eastern
Bloc countries that would be a big step forward. First we are
working it out with the Soviet Union and the other East Bloc
countries will come later,'' he said.

   A low-level mobster suspected of killing a
federal drug agent in February was shot to death, probably on
orders from mob bosses angry about the scrutiny the agent's murder
brought them, authorities said today.
   Constabile ``Gus'' Farace was shot Friday night as he sat in a
car _ the same manner in which he allegedly killed Everett Hatcher,
a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, who was
posing as a drug buyer.
   Hatcher's death Feb. 28 sparked a nationwide manhunt that
involved up to 100 federal agents working seven days a week, said
U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney. Farace was also to be featured Sunday
as the country's ``No. 1 fugitive'' on the Fox network television
show ``America's Most Wanted.''
   ``It's reasonable to assume all of that pressure could have
resulted in last night's shooting,'' Maloney said.
   ``A rational and prudent person would obviously believe that
this is probably a mob hit,'' said Robert Stutman, head of the
DEA's New York office. ``The investigation is continuing; I can't
say that for sure.''
   Hatcher, 46, was shot to death in February on Staten Island
after he went to meet Farace to set up a cocaine deal, police said.
He was shot four times in the head and upper body as he sat behind
the wheel of his car.
   Hatcher had been trying to infiltrate a cocaine ring run by the
mob, authorities said.
   On Friday, Farace, 29, was sitting in the front passenger seat
of a car parked on a Brooklyn street when a blue van pulled up
alongside him about 11 p.m. Seven to nine shots were fired into the
car, Maloney said at a news conference this morning.
   Farace was found dead slumped in his seat.
   The driver, Joseph Sclafani, who had been hit in the chest,
managed to get out of the car and fire a few shots from his
.38-caliber handgun at the fleeing van, he said.
   Sclafani, in his 20s, was found a few feet from the car and
taken to Coney Island Hospital, where he was in critical condition.
   Maloney described Farace as a ``young punk'' associated with the
Bonanno and Colombo crime families.
   ``I think it's reasonable to assume organized crime figures were
aware of the intensity of the investigation,'' Maloney said. ``I
assume that people higher up (in the Mafia) were as interested in
finding him as we were.''
   ``Mob justice isn't always swift, but it's always deadly, and
this may be an example of deadly mob justice,'' James Fox, head of
the New York FBI office, said at the news conference.
   Hatcher was a 12-year veteran of the DEA in New York and its
first agent killed here since 1972.
   His death prompted one of the largest manhunts in recent years
and rewards totaling $270,000 were offered, including $250,000 from
the federal government.
   ``I have never been involved with anything as intense or
emotional as this,'' Stutman said today. ``There were times we were
within two hours of him and he disappeared.''
   Farace was paroled in June 1988 after serving eight years for a
kidnap-murder.

   Czechoslovak playwright Vaclav Havel,
that country's leading dissident, has received an exit visa so he
can come to Stockholm to accept a human rights award, officials
said Saturday.
   Sweden's foreign minister, Sten Andersson, had planned to go to
Prague, Czechoslovakia, on Thursday to present the $15,500 Olof
Palme prize to Havel because it was not expected the government
would allow Havel to leave the country.
   ``We will leave it to Havel to decide whether he prefers to come
here or receive the prize in Prague,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Helena Boutrup told The Associated Press.
   The Czechoslovak Embassy said Havel received his exit visa
Friday.
   The Olof Palme memorial prize, named for the Swedish prime
minister murdered in 1986, is awarded to champions of human rights
and peace.
   Havel is a member of the Charter 77 human rights group and has
been jailed in Czechoslovakia various times for his stance against
the Communist government.

   Two bombs exploded in downtown Amritsar

   The explosions, in two shopping centers, injured more than 60
people, said hospital sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blasts, which occurred
around 5.30 p.m. in this city in Punjab state.
   Similar explosions in June 1988 in Amritsar were blamed on Sikh
militants campaigning for an independent homeland in Punjab.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are a
slight majority in Punjab, where militants have been leading a
violent campaign since 1982 for a separate homeland. They allege
they are discriminated against by India's Hindu majority.
   At least 1,600 deaths have been blamed on Sikh militants in
Punjab this year.

   When Mother Teresa visited the United States,
it was Charles H. Keating Jr. who lent his helicopter to her to
visit remote Indian reservations in the Southwest.
   Now this former Olympic swimmer and fighter pilot _ a benefactor
of charities and politicians, a battler of pornographers and
bureaucrats _ is the lead character in the costliest savings and
loan failure in the nation's history and a Capitol Hill drama
threatening the political lives of five senators.
   Whether bestowing his largess on church, charities, civic
causes, business associates or politicians whose help he might want
some day, ``Charlie Keating'' has always done it with a touch of
flash.
   Typifying his desire for the spotlight, Keating insisted on
being the final witness in the final episode of six weeks of House
Banking Committee hearings into the growth and collapse of his
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   He got his wish and is scheduled to testify Tuesday.
   Originally orchestrated as a forum for building a case to oust
M. Danny Wall as the nation's top thrift regulator, the hearings
instead have evolved into a near inquisition for the senators, to
whom Keating and his associates gave $1.3 million in his highly
public war with Lincoln's regulators.
   Although he was formally subpoenaed by the committee, Keating's
associates say he welcomes an opportunity to tell his side of the
Lincoln story: that it was regulators who created the S&amp;L
nightmare, not him.
   But just how forthcoming the Phoenix millionaire will be before
congressional inquisitors was unclear as of late last week. The
target of a criminal grand jury in Los Angeles, various
racketeering and fraud suits and ongoing investigations by three
federal agencies, Keating is being advised by some to keep his
silence.
   For Keating, that's a tall order. From his initial entry onto
the public stage as an anti-smut crusader, he has been anything but
silent.
   When the Home Loan Bank Board seized Lincoln last April _ two
years after the federal agency's examiners recommended _ Keating
bluntly asserted to reporters the purpose of his largesse to
elected officeholders.
   ``One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do
with whether my financial support in any way influenced several
political figures to take up my cause,'' he said. ``I want to say
in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so.''
   Four of five Keating says he meant to influence _ John Glenn,
D-Ohio; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald Riegle, D-Mich.; and Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz. _ have told the Senate Ethics Committee in
formal responses that they did no wrong. The fifth, John McCain,
R-Ariz., will submit his response to the formal committee inquiry
before Congress adjourns for Thanksgiving, according to a spokesman.
   But regulators have told the House panel they never had seen
such bold political interference as Keating engineered.
   ``We've never experienced a guy who had so much juice,'' said
William Crawford, California's savings and loan commissioner.
   Altogether, regulators expect Lincoln's failure will cost
taxpayers up to $2 billion. They contend in a suit against Keating
that the losses stemmed from fraud, insider abuse and racketeering.
   ``If our recommendations had been followed, the taxpayers would
have suffered dramatically smaller losses,'' said William Black,
one of the four Bank Board officials summoned to meet with the five
senators.
   Born into a prominent Cincinnati family with strong Republican
connections, Keating, now 65, began a three-decade-long crusade
against pornography in the late 1950s.
   In 1970, he won an appointment from President Nixon to the
Federal Commission on Obscenity and Pornography as a self-described
``book burner.'' He promptly sued the commission to block
publication of its report until he could write a dissent to its
conclusion that pornography posed no threat.
   A lawyer by training, Keating turns to suits frequently in
waging his campaigns. He's filed several against the government
since buying Lincoln for $51 million in 1984 and converting it from
a traditional home mortgage lender into what critics say was the
epitome of the kind of highflier thrifts that were at the root of
industry problems that required a $157 billion taxpayer bailout.
   Other tactics include hiring away at large salaries the state
and federal regulators and private auditors charged with overseeing
his empire on behalf of the public.
   The Phoenix managing partner of Lincoln's auditor, the Big Eight
accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co., helped set up the meetings
between the regulators and the senators with a report affirming
Lincoln's soundness. A year later, he joined Keating's payroll with
an annual salary of $950,000.
   Glenn, who accepted $200,000 in campaign donations from Keating,
recalled feeling ``livid'' when he learned that.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``Absolutely I felt I was
led down the primrose path.'' Nonetheless, Glenn said he has no
intention of returning the $200,000 contribution.
   Those Keating didn't hire, he retained, such as Alan Greenspan,
formerly the president's chief economic adviser and now chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board. Then working as a private consultant,
Greenspan wrote a study in 1986 defending Keating's practices.
   Keating's business instincts and proclivity to spend whatever is
necessary to get what he wants were developed at the knee of Carl
H. Lindner, a reclusive Cincinnati billionaire who through
takeovers built American Financial Corp. into a banking, insurance,
real estate and meatpacking empire.
   It was as a vice president and director there that Keating had
his first run-in with financial regulators. After a three-year
investigation, the SEC accused the two of fraudulently diverting
company assets for their personal use.
   They eventually signed a consent decree in 1979 admitting no
wrong but promising never to do it again. Keating later said
signing the decree was a mistake, claiming it cost him an
appointment from President Reagan to be U.S. ambassador to the
Bahamas.
   About the time the SEC was launching its first investigation of
Keating, he moved to Phoenix to head Continental Homes Inc., a
troubled home-building subsidiary of American Financial.
   Two years later, in 1978, Keating bought out Continental Homes
and changed its name to American Continental Corp. and began doling
out large contributions to candidates for every office from city
council to the presidency.
   In 1980 he was the West Coast finance chairman in now-bankrupt
former Texas Gov. John B. Connally's short-lived campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination.
   There he met Lee Henkel Jr., an Atlanta tax lawyer and former
chief counsel at the IRS during part of the Nixon administration,
who was carrying out the same task for Connally on the East Coast.
   Six years later when Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin Gray
and his staff began reigning in the way some thrifts were
operating, Keating helped win Reagan's appointment of Henkel to the
bank board.
   Henkel resigned from the board four months later after it was
disclosed he had loans or shared in partnerships with loans from
Lincoln totaling $60 million. But first he proposed changing the
board's regulations to exempt much of Lincoln's investments from
the newly imposed restrictions. The changes were rejected by the
board's other members.
   ``I have taken every action appropriate to rectify the
unwarranted bureaucratic assault ... waged against me and my
company,'' Keating said last April. ``In the contract between the
voter and the politician, we have the right to seek their help when
needed and demand it when justified. This I have done.''

   Lech Walesa came to the nation's biggest
Polish-American community to seek financial help for Poland's
struggling economy, but he said today he is not here with his ``hat
held out.''
   ``I have come here to prove that our system does not beg ... but
appeals to you as teachers, to help us to step onto the right path
of development,'' Walesa said at a morning meeting with officials
of the Polish American Congress.
   ``We want to learn from you how to develop a country, how to
move it from a system that failed to one that works.''
   The Nobel prize-winning labor leader said he is not seeking
direct financial aid from U.S. politicians or businessmen,
emphasizing that Poland wants to concentrate on joint ventures.
   ``We shouldn't go around with our hat held out,'' Walesa said,
speaking through an interpreter.
   Although business was on his mind, Walesa's first moments in
Chicago after his arrival late Friday were warmed by a welcome in
the tradition of his homeland.
   He was given a loaf of bread, a bag of salt and a bouquet of
flowers by about 100 people who greeted him at a neighborhood
monument to the Solidarity movement he helped found.
   ``He is a symbol to us. We call him `harnash,''' said Stanley
Dzierzega, vice president of the Polish Highlanders Alliance of
America. ``It means leader, and he is our leader, a symbol of
freedom.''
   Walesa arrived at Midway Airport late Friday from New York on
the latest leg of a trip intended to encourage U.S. investment in
Poland's faltering economy. The trip included an emotional meeting
with President Bush and a speech before an enthusiastic joint
session of Congress in which Walesa, an electrician, said
investment from the West is needed to ensure the success of
political reforms in his country.
   Chicago, with 800,000 residents of Polish descent, is the
biggest Polish community outside Warsaw, and Walesa's one-day visit
was expected to draw large crowds. The agenda consists largely of
meetings with business and labor leaders.
   At Friday night's ceremony in the city's heavily Polish
southwest side, the traditional gifts of welcome were presented by
members of the Highlanders, who work to preserve Polish culture in
the United States.
   ``He said he was happy to see us here in America,'' Dzierzega
said.
   Members of the group, dressed in embroidered folk shirts and
blouses and lamb's wool vests, also gave Walesa an ax, which they
said was a Polish symbol of freedom.
   Despite wind-whipped snow and sub-freezing temperatures, about
100 people greeted him at the stone memorial to Solidarity, and a
score of others were turned away by security guards.
   ``I am Polish. I was a union member, and what I like about the
guy is he had guts,'' Frank Mrozowski said as the motorcade left.
``He said he was going to organize a union, and that was it.''
   Walesa departs tonight for Philadelphia. He was scheduled to
attend Mass Sunday at a Polish shrine in Doylestown, a suburb.

<HEAD>One Year Later Quayle Has Bush Support But Wrestles With His Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For very different reasons, George Bush and
comedian Jay Leno want Dan Quayle on the 1992 Republican ticket.
   When Bush praised Quayle as ``an outstanding vice president''
who has his heart in his job, late night television personality
Leno quipped, ``Now if he can just get his mind in the job.''
   Eleven months after the former Indiana senator survived a
difficult political campaign and became vice president, he has
Bush's support for another four-year term.
   At the same time, though, he remains a popular target for the
likes of Leno _ and a worrisome factor for Republicans watching
public opinion polls giving Quayle consistently low ratings.
   ``I'm not going to do anything differently no matter what the
polls say,'' Quayle recently told reporters. ``I'm going to work as
I believe a vice president should work, that is, first and foremost
with complete loyalty to the president, for the advancement of his
agenda, in his interests and that's what I'm doing.''
   The most recent surveys, a Wall Street Journal-NBC News sampling
taken early this month, reported more than half of the voters said
Bush should choose a different running mate in 1992. Quayle could
not even claim support from the Republicans polled. By a 40 to 39
percent margin, they said he should be dumped.
   ``You can't argue with those polls. It's unfortunate that people
haven't recognized his contributions to the administration and the
party,'' said Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith.
   He said Quayle has accomplished his first-year goals of
solidifying his position within the White House and with Bush and
of working with Republican Party officials around the country.
   ``As people begin to recognize his contributions in those areas,
the polls will take care of themselves,'' Beckwith said.
   The vice president also has emerged as a link with the White
House for conservatives, some of whom are distrustful of Bush. And
Quayle is credited with raising $5 million in campaign
contributions for GOP candidates and causes.
   Expectations were low when Quayle took office, in part because
of a presidential campaign in which his selection became an issue.
   Even now, praise for the vice president from Republicans often
begins with a sigh of relief that Quayle has avoided serious gaffes
and avoided embarrassing the president.
   ``He's fulfilling the functions for which he was selected,''
said political analyst William Schneider of the American Enterprise
Institute. ``He does not challenge, he does not question the
president. He doesn't make any trouble.''
   His standing wasn't helped by a new book on the 1988 campaign,
``Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars'' by reporters Jack Germond
and Jules Witcover. Republican consultants who worked with Quayle
in the campaign were quoted as offering unflattering descriptions
of the vice presidential nominee.
   ``He was like a kid,'' the book quoted Joseph Canzeri as saying.
``Ask him to turn off a light and by the time he gets to the
switch, he's forgotten what he went for.''
   When asked by Dallas Morning News reporters this month whether
he would keep Quayle on the ticket, Bush seized the chance to say
he ``absolutely'' would.
   That word from Bush _ a vice president himself for eight years _
was widely regarded as a move to head off rumors that were
beginning to surface regarding Quayle's future.
   ``Bush knew better than anyone else how frustrating such rumors
are and wanted to put them to rest,'' said an administration
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Given Bush's support for his vice president, Republicans were
insistent that they not be linked by name to any critical
statements. One party official said GOP stalwarts ``are trying to
make the best of what might otherwise be a bad situation.''
   In speeches, Quayle often puts his own stamp on administration
policy, careful to follow Bush's lead but adding a conservative
edge.
   Quayle is a passionate defender of the Strategic Defense
Initiative _ the space-based missile defense system _ and he takes
a consistently skeptical view of the Soviet Union's reform moves.
   Recently he took a harder line on U.S.-Soviet relations than the
more optimistic view articulated just a day earlier in a major
speech by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. The White House
hastened to insist that the two speeches were not inconsistent.
   Despite private grumbling within the GOP, there is no shortage
of Republicans willing to praise Quayle publicly.
   ``Dan is personally well liked. He is eager to help everyone on
both a partisan and non-partisan level and he has the support of
the president,'' said Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., a close ally of
Bush.
   On the fund-raising circuit, the Republican National Committee
touts Quayle as one of its principle assets _ with some $5 million
to his credit so far. RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said Quayle
has been adept at building support among party regulars at the
state and local level.
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean said Bush ``is absolutely convinced
that Dan Quayle is a good public servant and that he is growing and
that he is learning on the job.''
   ``He needed that kind of reassurance from the president,'' said
Kean. Rumors that some factions wanted to dump Quayle from the
ticket in 1992 were ``very, very destructive,'' when the vice
president travels as a representative of the administration, Kean
said.

<HEAD>Pay Bill Requires Judges To Work For Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pay raise awaiting President Bush's
signature would stop able-bodied, semiretired federal judges from
collecting pay raises while doing no judicial work.
   But an exception would be granted for former Chief Justice
Warren Burger and any others who, like him, work full-time on a
federal or state entity outside the judicial system.
   The pay package for members of Congress, judges and senior
executives, approved by Congress early Saturday sent to Bush,
contains a bipartisan proposal to alter the pay provisions for
senior judges _ those who opt for a reduced workload after they
reach age 65 with 15 years experience.
   To get full raises, senior judges would have to do the
equivalent of three months of judicial work a year or be disabled.
Healthy senior judges who did not work that minimum would continue
to receive the full pay they got before they stopped working, plus
any subsequent cost-of-living increases.
   The proposal to restrict pay raises for non-working senior
judges was introduced by Reps. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., and
Carlos Moorhead, R-Calif., chairman and ranking Republican on the
House courts subcommittee, last April after The Associated Press
found that nearly 20 percent of the 277 senior judges did no
judicial work.
   Since then, drafters added one provision which, Kastenmeier
conceded, would have the effect of preserving the pay raise for
former Chief Justice Warren Burger, who has not heard a case since
stepping down in 1986. Since then, he has been chairman of the
bicentennial of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The panel
continues through 1991.
   The provision allows full pay raises for senior judges, like
Burger, who work full-time ``for a federal or state governmental
entity.'' One source, who declined to be named, said Burger's views
that senior judges ought to get full pay raises for such work had
been made known to the Congress.
   As a result, Burger's pay, and that of current Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, would rise from $115,000 now to $124,000 in
January and at least $155,000 on Jan. 1991.
   The bill would boost the salaries of federal district judges
from $89,500 to $120,800 in January and at least $124,400 in
January, 1991. Appeals courts salaries would rise from $95,000 to
$102,500 and then at least to $128,100. Supreme Court justices
would go from $110,000 to $118,700 and at least to $148,400.
   The final figures in all four categories are contingent on
inflation and are likely to be increased as a result of a
cost-of-living increase in January 1991, currently expected to be
around 3 percent.
   Kastenmeier said last week that, ``The only judges who will not
receive the raise are those who should not receive it: the ones in
good health who affirmatively opt not to work.''
   Nevertheless, spokesmen for the federal judiciary have bitterly
opposed any curtailment in raises for any category of senior judge.
As the bill neared passage, sources said, representatives of the
judiciary tried without success to find support for an amendment
that would exempt all current judges from the restrictions and
apply them only to future appointees.
   Members of Kastenmeier's subcommittee told judicial leaders at a
hearing last April that The Associated Press stories about the pay
of senior judges had prompted a torrent of constituent complaints
and introduction of the legislation.
   The AP reported previously unpublished federal figures from 1987
that showed that 20 percent of the 306 senior judges that year did
no judicial work.
   An Associated Press survey of all senior judges in February and
March of this year found that 17 percent of 277 senior judges did
no judicial work. The AP survey credited judges for dormant cases
still on their dockets, which the earlier government data had not.
   Under the new rules, senior judges could fulfill their work
requirement by hearing cases in court or by writing opinions and
handling settlements and motions. In either case, the chief judge
of their circuit would have to certify that they had done during
the year an amount of work equal to that which an active judge
would complete in three months.
   They also could complete the requirement for full raises by
working full-time on administrative duties directly related to the
operation of the courts, such as at the Federal Judicial Center.
   Senior judges who fail to meet the work requirement as a result
of either temporary or permanent disability would continue to
receive all raises given full-time judges.

<HEAD>U.S. Envoy Returns to Lebanon, Tells Aoun to Behave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KHODOR TALEB</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EHDEN, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy, pulled from
Lebanon 73 days ago under pressure from supporters of Christian
Gen. Michel Aoun, returned Saturday and urged the rebellious Aoun
to ``fall in line behind civilian authority.''
   McCarthy drove to Ehden in Syrian-controlled north Lebanon to
present his credentials to a foreign ministry official at the home
of President Rene Mouawad. A Beirut newspaper reported that the
United States is considering reopening its mission in Lebanon but
moving it out of the region controlled by Aoun.
   The presenting of credentials underscored U.S. backing for the
new head of state, whom Aoun opposes, and intensified the general's
political isolation.
   Earlier, a small bomb exploded outside the home of Armenian
parliamentary deputy Khatchig Babikian in Christian east Beirut,
causing damage but no casualties, police reported.
   It was the seventh attack on a Christian parliamentarian since
legislators defied Aoun and elected Mouawad president on Nov. 5 to
oversee implementation of an Arab League-sponsored peace plan to
end 14 years of civil war.
   The accord was reached by the legislators in 23 days of talks in
the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif.
   Mccarthy and his bodyguards arrived in Ehden in a five-car
convoy. Security around Mouawad's two-story stone mansion was tight.
   ``I wanted to bring the greetings of President Bush to President
Mouawad,'' McCarthy told reporters.
   ``My country was very, very pleased to see the developments that
took place in Taif, to see the election of a new president here, to
see that the situation, that had been ambigious in terms of
legality, has now totally cleared,'' he added. ``You have a
president. That's a wonderful thing.''
   In remarks aimed at Aoun, McCarthy said, ``Lebanon has a long
tradition of constitutional democracy. In that tradition, as far as
I know, military officers have always followed the civilian
authority.''
   The envoy said he assumed that Aoun, ``like the good soldier he
is ... will very soon fall in line behind civilian authority. I
certainly hope so.''
   McCarthy said the Bush administration ``has a good deal of
respect for Gen. Aoun'' and agreed with his goals. ``It was really
the means he was using that we quarreled with.''
   Aoun, who seeks to force the 40,000 Syrian soldiers out of
Lebanon, fought them for six months in fierce artillery battles
that killed more than 900 people and wounded nearly 3,000. The
fighting ended Sept. 22 with an Arab League-brokered cease-fire.
   The general opposed the Taif accord because it did not include a
guarantee for the withdrawal of the Syrians, who were deployed in
1976 under an Arab League mandate to quell civil war fighting. Aoun
said they defied that mandate by siding with the Moslems.
   Salah Staitiyeh, head of the Foreign Ministry's political
affairs department, said McCarthy presented a copy of his
credentials to him at 1:45 p.m.
   The ambassador will formally present his credentials to Mouawad
on Sunday, officials reported.
   McCarthy held a 30-minute meeting with Mouawad. Reporters were
not allowed in, but photographers were given 10 minutes to take
pictures.
   The two men later drove together in Mouawad's bulletproof
Mercedes to the neighboring town of Zghorta away for a lunch given
by former President Suleiman Franjieh.
   Lebanese soldiers in armored personnel carriers guarded the
mountain road between Ehden and Zghorta. Mouawad and McCarthy
returned to Ehden several hours later and talked for 90 minutes. No
statement was issued.
   Beirut's leftist As-Safir newspaper reported from Washington
that the United States was ``seriously considering reopening its
embassy in Lebanon, but outside the Christian enclave'' controlled
by Aoun.
   The daily quoted unnamed American sources as saying McCarthy
would discuss with Mouawad the idea of moving the embassy to the
Syrian-policed north.
   McCarthy and other U.S. diplomats evacuated the embassy in
Christian east Beirut on Sept. 6 after Aoun loyalists besieged it.
   Asked whether the embassy would reopen, McCarthy said: ``We'll
return as soon as our security can be guaranteed and as soon as
we're certain we can have contacts with all the different political
leaders in Lebanon.''

<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan may have settled a lot of old
scores in her memoir, ``My Turn,'' but the critics panned it when
they got their turn.
   With only a few exceptions, the book has been reviewed as
shallow and mean. The Philadelphia Inquirer's critic, Susan Page,
suggested the former first lady could have called it ``Take That.''
The Los Angeles Times' David Lauter called it a ``self-indictment.''
   The New Republic's Barbara Ehrenreich commented on its
``whining'' quality.
   Said critic Richard Dyer in the Boston Globe: ``Nancy Reagan has
written a book she shouldn't have. Instead of changing a
hoity-toity image she is unhappy with, she has reinforced it. If
you thought she cared too much about clothes and furniture and
china and decoration and every form of appearance, this book proves
you are right.''
   ``Smugness infects these memoirs,'' said R.W. Apple Jr. in The
New York Times. `` Mrs. Reagan's self-satisfaction and
self-righteousness shine out from page afer page.''
   On the other hand, some critics found an unexpected side to Mrs.
Reagan _ warm humor.
   In the Chicago Tribune, Dorothy Collin called the book as much
fun as ``a long gossipy lunch'' and predicted, ``History may be
pretty kind to Nancy Reagan.''
   San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News critic Florence King said Mrs.
Reagan had produced ``a blunt, very funny memoir.''
   Whatever the critics' verdict, of course, Mrs. Reagan, can laugh
all the way to the bank. She has produced a hit.
   Her book leaped to first-place on most best seller compilations.
It took the No. 2 spot on the New York Times' widely-watched best
seller list for Nov. 19 and her agent Mort Janklow says it will
reign as No. 1 in the list the Times will print Nov. 26.
   Random House, the publisher, denies reports that Mrs. Reagan was
paid $2 million in advance royalties but won't disclose the actual
figure. Industry scuttlebutt is that it may have been more.
   As for the reviews, Random House publicist Carol Schneider calls
them ``political,'' saying, ``People seem to be reviewing Nancy
Reagan rather than the book.''
   Agent Janklow says the reviews have been negative because people
expect a first lady to write a sweet and-then-I-entertained sort of
book, which Mrs. Reagan's isn't.
   ``She unburdens herself of her pent-up anger and I think that's
what makes it a wonderful book,'' says Janklow.
   In the Washington Post, reviewer Sally Quinn wrote that she was
struck by how much anger Mrs. Reagan displayed. She said she turned
back the corners of pages on which Mrs. Reagan mentioned being
angry, furious, outraged, irritated or annoyed and counted 42
turned corners in 370 pages.
   Among the people Mrs. Reagan was angry about were Ms. Quinn,
author of what she called ``a very negative article about me,'' and
Ms. Quinn's husband, Post executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee.
   University of Texas historian Lewis Gould, who specializes in
first ladies, says he suspects Mrs. Reagan comes across as more
bitter than she intended. That happens, he says, when people
``write'' their books, like she did, by speaking into a tape
recorder, allowing a ghostwriter to polish their words.
   By not having to put pen to paper, the author does not have to
think about what he is saying and the result, Gould says, can be
``like a heated letter you read the next morning and throw away.
Well, Mrs. Reagan sent out the heated letter.''
   Among Mrs. Reagan's targets _ people she said have made her
angry _ noted Ms. Quinn, were Don Regan, Al Haig, Jimmy Carter,
Jerry Ford, John Sears, Mike Deaver, Ed Meese, David Stockman, Bill
Safire, Raisa Gorbachev, Stuart Spencer, Nelson Rockefeller, Barry
Goldwater, Joan Didion, Walter Mondale, Geraldine Ferraro, John
Poindexter, Oliver North, George Bush, doctors who appear on
television, the press, her stephicldren Maureen and Michael and
especially her daugher Patti.
   The attack on Patti, she says, ``is so hurtful, so painful, so
embarrassing, so pathetic that it takes your breath away.''

   This is the wall everyone watches.
   ``The German question is open so long as the Brandenburg Gate is
closed,'' says West German President Richard von Weizsaecker. That,
too, is painted on the wall.
   Farther south at Potsdamer Platz is the new opening where
photographers and gawkers jostle with Berliners exercising their
new mobility. A billboard records that this barren ground was, in
1932, jammed with autos and electric trolley cars. On June 16,
1953, three years before the Hungarian uprising, rock-throwing
Germans in the Eastern sector took on Soviet tanks.
   Wallbangers have been most active where the barrier takes a big
turn to the east. One hole along the base was large enough for a
head to poke through, but most were no more than five inches wide
even though several feet long.
   Bad concrete, it's obvious, was not one of the failures of East
German socialism.
   Two young Americans tried their luck with a piece of angle-iron
and waved a little U.S. flag through the opening.
   ``Get your flag out of here!'' a German woman shouted in
English. ``Show your flag in your own country, not here.''
   ``But this is the American sector,'' one of the Americans
explained.
   ``American sector!'' the German snorted. ``Do you think this is
some kind of colony?''
   The wall here is at its rudest. It swallows streets, blocks
trolley tracks, crowds front porches along Niederkirchener Strasse.
   Proximity breeds creativity. One artist glued shards of mirrors
on the wall, creating an illusion of transparency.
   Another covered five concrete panels with a huge blue question
mark on an aquamarine background, over a tormented caption:
``Humanity is steering toward a black hole, we're gaining speed,
but the narrowest passage is ahead.''
   A misshapen cross says ``Erich Honnecker RIP,'' the misspelling
of his last name a final insult to the hardline East German leader
who was ousted Oct. 18.
   Beyond Checkpoint Charlie and the Checkpoint Charlie Museum,
fresh mums were tangled in the barbed wire entwined on a wooden
cross. It tells of the agonizing death of Peter Fechter, who was
shot and lay by the wall for 50 minutes in 1962, bleeding and
calling for help.
   West German police could only throw first-aid packs over the
wall. Finally, East German guards carried Fechter away.
   West Berlin changes from park to slum to suburb to woodland to
lakeshore, but the Wall hardly changes for miles.
   There are places of rustling leaves and birdsong, and little
desolation rows where the sidewalk is squeezed between the Wall and
the various high walls and barbed wire of private property.
   In the run-down Kreuzberg area, Berlin's ultra-left
``autonomen'' have parked their wooden caravans and shacks in the
shelter of the wall. A couple of goats were tethered across the
street, and small signs warned, ``No photographs.''
   ``No reunification. No Fourth Reich,'' said a banner hanging
from a ramshackle tower.
   ``The freedom that they mean is for the Deutsche Bank,'' said
another banner, referring to the country's biggest bank.
   Way out in suburbia, one of the newest crossings is a bridge
leading into Potsdam. The East Germans have long called it the
Unity Bridge.
   Such communist irony inspired some professionally painted
official graffiti on the Western shore: ``Those who gave it the
name of the Bridge of Unity also built the wall, strung the barbed
wire and made the death strip, and so hindered unity.''
   Back in the city, one German spoke for millions: ``Ich Verstehe
diese Mauer Nicht.''
   ``I don't understand this Wall.''

<TEXT>
   Next month's superpower summit, conceived as a
casual, get-acquainted session, is being swamped by the upheaval in
Eastern Europe and reshaped into a politically charged meeting with
an uncertain outcome.
   While struggling to keep expectations modest, White House
officials acknowledge that the dizzying events in East Germany and
elsewhere have infused more drama into the meeting between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We are aware of these expectations,'' a senior administration
official said. ``I think it's human nature that when an American
and Soviet president get together, naturally the world is glued to
the television screens.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the opening of
the Berlin Wall and the surge of East Germans to the West, add ``a
new sense of urgency and a new dimension'' to the talks.
   Moving beyond the concept of a low-stakes get-together, Bush now
says he will use the summit to advance the process of reform and
democracy.
   The Soviets say the meeting could produce a timetable for
resolving key issues facing the two superpowers.
   Along those lines, the United States says the summit will ``give
a push'' to all of the U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations but will not
produce actual formulas for reductions.
   Whereas Bush originally described the meeting merely as an
opportunity to put his feet up and chat with Gorbachev, the
president says he will explore ``opportunities to move beyond
containment in U.S.-Soviet relations, to find areas of mutual
advance in our relationship.''
   On the other hand, the rising public expectations have prompted
words of caution from both sides.
   Both Bush and Gorbachev have begun talking publicly about what
they will not do _ as well as what they will do.
   Both sides say they do not expect to sign any new agreements.
   ``We're not meeting to negotiate the future of Europe,'' Bush
said last week. ``The peoples of Eastern Europe are speaking their
own minds about that future.''
   Gorbachev, staking out similar ground, said any talk about
German reunification would be viewed as outside interference; and
that any gloating that socialism had failed would be ``wishful
thinking.''
   Bush said reunification ``is a matter for the people of the
Germanys to determine.''
   Both leaders have expressed hopes for a calm and peaceful period
of change in Eastern Europe. Bush and Gorbachev may codify that
sentiment by making a joint pledge at the summit not to interfere
in the events of Eastern and Central Europe.
   Bush and Gorbachev are to hold more than eight hours of talks,
aside from meals together, over two days, Dec. 2 and 3.
   They will meet in the Mediterranean on warships, the U.S. guided
missile cruiser Belknap, flagship of the 6th Fleet, and the Soviet
missile cruiser Slava, which has been specially outfitted for the
meeting.
   The ships will be anchored about 1,000 feet off the coast of
Malta.
   In line with the official strategy of keeping expectations low,
the senior administration official said, ``I don't think the
character of the meeting or the president's objectives have changed.
   ``What has changed is the profundity of the events that have
been occurring these last two months in the center of Europe,''
said the official, insisting on anonymity.
   Fitzwater said the Soviets traditionally play up expectations
for summits while the United States tries to keep them low. ``I
suspect the reality is somewhere in the middle,'' he said.
   Raymond Seitz, assistant secretary of state for European
affairs, said Bush `` wants to get a firsthand sense of what the
limits are. What is perestroika (the Soviet program of economic
reform)? Where is it heading? What are the goals? What are the
pitfalls?''
   To allay fears that the United States was adopting a go-it-alone
approach, Bush talked by telephone Friday with the leaders of
Britain, France, West Germany and Canada and promised more
discussions before the summit.
   Seitz said Bush ``doesn't want to get into the trap of two
emperors deciding the future of Europe.''
   There are intense preparations in Washington for the summit,
including a concerted effort to prepare Bush for any surprises
Gorbachev may spring, as he has done at previous summits.
   ``It's like a debate. You always have to game-plan every major
argument on every important issue that your opponent could use,''
said William J. Taylor, a specialist on U.S.-Soviet relations at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
   ``The president will be ready,'' the senior administration
official said. He said the administration was anticipating ``all
the issues that may come up.''
   Fitzwater said, ``Obviously, if President Gorbachev makes a
proposal, the president will say, `Well, that's very interesting,
why do you feel that way and what's your reasoning?' and he'll give
him his points of view and his ideas and say, `We'll take these
matters up with the allies and we'll talk about them again at our
next summit.'''

about 12 hours behind schedule Saturday as it worked toward
starting the countdown for the Thanksgiving Eve liftoff of shuttle
Discovery, NASA said.
   ``It's a very tight schedule, but we're still targeting the
launch for Wednesday the 22nd,'' said space agency spokeswoman Lisa
Malone, who blamed the delay on ``a bunch of little things.''
   The secret military mission, which sources said will include the
deployment of a spy satellite, is expected to last four days.
   Malone said launch officials were assessing where the lost time
could be made up before the scheduled 4 p.m. Sunday countdown
start, and ``we'll regroup tomorrow morning and see where we
stand.''
   Launch crews might be able pick up some time by speeding up the
engine closeout Sunday, she said. Some time also might be made up
by reducing the number of hours of contingency hold time included
in the countdown.
   Time was lost during the week when engineers had to replace an
electronic control box on one of Discovery's two solid fuel booster
rockets, and ``a bunch of other little things also put us behind,''
Malone said.
   She said that if officials decide Sunday that they can't make a
Wednesday launch, they could delay the liftoff until Thursday, or
put it off two days until Friday to allow most workers to spend
Thanksgiving at home.
   ``We'll look at the weather forecast for Friday and the weekend,
and if it looks good, we might reschedule for Friday,'' she said.
``But we have not ruled out a Thanksgiving liftoff.''
   Because the flight is classified, NASA and the Pentagon have
said only that the launch will occur between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30
p.m. They will not make the exact time public until just nine
minutes before the planned liftoff.
   Except for brief announcements on the shuttle reaching orbit and
on the landing time, there will be a news blackout during the
mission unless something major goes wrong.
   The flight is expected to last four days.
   Sources close to the project said Discovery's payload is an
intelligence satellite that will be able to listen in on
communications networks of the Soviet Union and other countries.
   The astronaut crew members will be commander Fred Gregory, pilot
John Blaha and mission specialists Manley Carter Jr., Story
Musgrave and Kathy Thornton.

   In the first frenzied hours after
Michaela Joy Garecht was kidnapped a year ago Sunday, volunteers
and parents of other missing children printed and distributed
42,000 fliers bearing her image.
   Millions of fliers later, Michaela is still missing, but efforts
by the volunteers, children's groups, police and FBI continue
strong.
   More than ever, parents of kidnapped children nationwide are
turning to each other for help in mobilizing community support and
publicity.
   Brought together by one of the cruelest of crimes, they also are
comforting each other when the waiting becomes too much and dark
thoughts swirl through their minds.
   A long table in the Garecht home is filled with newspaper
clippings and fliers of Michaela and others who have disappeared
and are feared to be victims of molesters and psychopaths.
   Sharon Garecht chain-smokes in the dining room near a portrait
of her daughter, who's 10 now _ if she lives.
   ``As more time goes on, it becomes harder to believe that we can
find her,'' Mrs. Garecht said. ``The one good thing about the
one-year anniversary is it's putting her and her abductor back in
the news. We're hopeful that will have some effect toward solving
the case.
   ``I'm kind of dreading next week, though. Between having passed
the one-year mark and Thanksgiving coming, I'm kind of planning in
advance to be depressed.''
   The telephone rings. It's Linda Borer in Willow, Alaska, whose
son, David, vanished last April.
   The women, linked by tragedies 2,000 miles apart, speak briefly
and agree to talk again later. Mrs. Garecht also keeps in touch
with the families of Michael Paul Henley, an 11-year-old missing
from New Mexico, and Amber Swartz-Garcia, 9, and Ilene Misheloff,
14, two other missing California girls.
   ``I have found that to be able to help somebody else with this
kind of situation has been very helpful for me,'' says Mrs.
Garecht, who founded the Michaela Joy Garecht Center to coordinate
the search for her daughter and assist other parents of missing
children.
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, based in
Arlington, Va., has recorded 511 abductions by strangers since it
opened in June 1984. Of those, 158 children were found alive, 112
dead. Most were sexually abused, authorities say.
   The non-profit center says its figures do not represent the
scope of the problem of missing children in the United States. It
contends many more cases exist than are reported to the group.
   Stranger abductions are a small percentage of the 23,899
children who have been reported missing over the past five years,
according to the national center. Nearly half are believed to be
runaways and ``throwaways.''
   David Collins of San Francisco, who led the original flier
effort for Michaela, is one of the parents of kidnap victims who
have been involved in other children's cases too. His son Kevin was
believed kidnapped nearly six years ago and has never been found.
   Last week, he was in Radcliff, Ky., in response to a request
from police looking for another missing child _ 5-year-old
Alexandria Suleski.
   Collins, who heads the Kevin Collins Foundation for Missing
Children along with his wife, Ann, also visited St. Joseph, Minn.,
earlier this month, helping organize the search for Jacob
Wetterling, an 11-year-old reported abducted at gunpoint near his
rural home Oct. 22.
   ``We have an abduction response team that helps families and
communities to distribute fliers and bring a central place and some
sanity to the situation,'' said Collins. ``People rush out to help
and often don't know what's happening, and there's often a lot of
cross efforts.''
   Michaela, whose name is pronounced Mi-KAY-la and who was called
Kayla for short, had gone with a girlfriend on their scooters to a
neighborhood market. After coming out of the store, Michaela
noticed one of the scooters had been moved. She went to get it, and
a man jumped out from a dented beige car next to it, threw her into
the car and sped away.
   The girlfriend said Michaela, a tall, slender blonde with blue
eyes, was grabbed by an acne-scarred, longhaired blond man believed
to be between 18 and his early 20s.
   There have been no ransom notes or calls from the kidnapper.
Hayward Police investigators and the FBI, each working full-time on
the case as part of an area task force on missing children, have
received 15,000 tips. Rewards total $90,000, but authorities say
they are not close to finding Michaela.
   Mrs. Garecht said people have told her to put the kidnapping
behind her, but she said neither she nor others have that option.
   ``As long as she's missing, she may be alive somewhere,'' she
said. ``If she is alive, then I can't let her down. I have to do
whatever I can to find her. And her kidnapper is still out there
and he may do it again.''

   A few blocks from the Kremlin, shoppers push
grocery carts through supermarket aisles lined with an astonishing
array of food, from powdered soup mixes to dried seaweed for sushi.
   Sugar, rationed throughout the country, was marked down last
week. And there was plenty of beef and soap, now rationed just
outside the city and practically never found in Moscow's regular
stores.
   In a shortage-plagued city, such a store might seem like a
mirage. For most, it is.
   The new market, popularly known as Stockmann's for the Helsinki
department store that established it as a Finnish-Soviet joint
venture, is not meant for Soviets with rubles.
   It is one of the cruelest ironies of Soviet life that as food
and consumer goods have disappeared from ordinary stores throughout
the country, foreign residents of Moscow can live better than ever
_ provided they have the plastic to pay for it.
   In Year 5 of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring, everyday items such as tea and matches are rationed
or simply nonexistent in many Soviet cities.
   But foreigners can purchase fresh advocados airlifted from
California for $3.40 apiece or papayas for $4.50, thanks to a
Swiss-Soviet joint venture that opened here last year. Fresh
cheeses and cold cuts are specialties at Spar, a new German market
on the Garden Ring Road.
   Stockmann, which for years has shipped everything from apples to
automobiles by rail to members of Moscow's foreign community,
opened its joint venture supermarket, which it named Kalinka, with
Soviet partners in mid-September.
   The glass-fronted former clothing store near Moscow's Paveletsky
train station was besieged the day it opened by more than 500 eager
shoppers, tempted by two truckloads of foreign foodstuffs.
   ``Many Russians tried to come in on the first day but found it
very frustrating they couldn't buy anything,'' said the store's
assistant manager, Robert Menard, 27, of Carlsbad, Calif. ``I fully
understand their frustration.''
   All transactions are by major Western credit card, which
effectively eliminates even those Soviets who, through the black
market or other means, carry hard currency.
   Now Muscovites who must line up to buy potatoes and
evil-smelling sausage sarcastically dubbed ``dog's delight,'' gawk
as foreigners haul bags of fresh pineapples and kiwi fruit, frozen
beef goulash and canned Coca-Cola to their waiting Volvos and
Toyotas.
   A teen-age girl stands at Kalinka's door to inform anyone
inquiring that the store does not accept rubles, which cannot be
converted into other currencies like dollars or Deutschmarks and
exported as profits. Opaque blinds on the windows conceal the
treasures within.
   The loosening of state controls on all business enterprise and
the active encouragement of joint ventures with Western
entrepreneurs have spawned a rush to relieve the fast-growing
foreign community of its hard currency:
   _Anyone with the yen, or the dollars, can glide through Moscow
in a 23-foot-long silver-gray Lincoln Continental stretch
limousine, thanks to a joint venture started by a U.S.-based Soviet
emigre, Viktor Bondarenko. For $32, the car is yours for an hour,
along with its built-in bar, liveried Russian chauffeur, video
player and even a tape of Tchaikovsky's ballet ``Swan Lake.''
   _At the refurbished Savoy Hotel near the Bolshoi Theater, guests
dine under the Faberge ceiling that once looked down on the Russian
aristocracy liquidated by the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. For those
seeking to ruin themselves like nobles in Tolstoy's ``War and
Peace,'' there's even a casino. Price of a luxury two-bedroom
suite: $540 a night. Not a single Soviet has checked in since the
hotel reopened after a yearlong refit.
   _The erstwhile capital of the worldwide proletarian revolution
is even getting its own golf course, thanks to former Swedish
hockey star and enterpreneur Sven Tumba. The initiation fee is
$20,000, with annual dues of $2,000 per member.
   For long-time foreign residents, this new Soviet ``dolce vita''
often seems a dream. A Moscow posting has been synonymous with
privation, and until as recently as two years ago, most diplomats,
business people and journalists with Western cash could only shop
in the state-run Soviet ``Beriozka'' shops, which because of
uncertain supply and limited selection were dubbed ``booze and
cookie stores.''
   But Gorbachev's economic reforms have unleashed a ravenous
Soviet appetite for ``valyuta,'' or convertible foreign currency.
Cooperative restaurants, car rental companies, auto service
centers, a printing company, dental clinic, office supply stores
and even a facsimile newsletter have appeared in recent months.
   Many old frustrations remain, but foreigners in Moscow
unabashedly love the improvements. ``I come here just for the
ambiance,'' joked American homemaker and three-year Moscow veteran
Margy Wiener as she maneuvered her supermarket cart by a freezer
chest at Kalinka crammed with several brands of french fries.
   In contrast, a Muscovite named Gavrilov recently expressed his
ire in a letter to a weekly newspaper: ``It's hard to put up with
the fact that the best of everything in Moscow (and in the country
as well) is for foreigners: hotels, special stores, etc. This isn't
due to traditional hospitality _ it's because of our poverty and
the servility before the rich that this engenders.''
   It's also because of the Kremlin's hunger for foreign currency
and a new willingness to do business with venture capitalists from
abroad who were once denounced for exploiting workers. The result
is often tableaux that make one wonder what seven decades of
socialist equality have wrought.
   In a scene seemingly straight from the film ``Doctor Zhivago,''
diners at the Savoy savor noisettes of wild boar in port wine and
sour cream sauce for $23 a plate. On the other side of the gauzy
curtain, Russians line up in the street to buy a plateful of boiled
dumplings and a cup of hot tea.
   Vladimir Shulov, a self-described ``security guard,'' keeps the
curious away from the hotel. As he stood outside the door one day,
chatting with a foreign visitor, a Russian ambled by and tried to
glance inside.
   ``Foreign money only,'' Shulov droned.
   ``Can I just look?'' the man asked.
   ``You want to look at something, go to a museum,'' Shulov
snapped.

   A civil defense commander says he
has room at his training center for at least 200 East Germans
returning to their Communist homeland, but no one is banging down
the door.
   ``We expect more to come as Christmas and New Year approach,''
Lt. Col. Horst Romeis said Friday over a camp lunch of soup, a roll
and East German beer. ``It needs some time to develop. The weather
is getting colder.''
   As of Friday, only 14 people had turned up at the reception
center normally used to train civil defense recruits in this drab
industrial city 25 miles east of the West German border town of
Helmstedt.
   More than 200,000 East Germans have arrived in West Germany this
year. In the new reform mood of the past two weeks, the government
has urged the refugees and emigres to come home.
   Nationwide figures are sketchy, but they suggest that perhaps
several hundred former refugees or emigres have taken advantage of
the invitation to return.
   The East German government hastily set up centers to welcome
back up to 10,000 returnees. But of the 18 reception centers opened
Monday in Magdeburg district, all but two had closed by Friday for
lack of business.
   A returnee arriving Thursday evening by train in Magdeburg,
about an hour's ride from the West German border, would have been
directed to an apprentices' residence, a brisk 15-minute walk from
the train station.
   But the home had gone back to its original purpose earlier in
the day after only seven returnees showed up.
   ``Our 350 apprentices were angry that they had to interrupt
their training for people who had turned their backs on us,'' said
residence supervisor Hans-Georg Friedebold, 32. ``That's
understandable.''
   Romeis predicts a bigger inflow of disoriented, needy returnees
in the coming weeks as East Germans find a new life is not so easy
to build in capitalist West Germany.
   The few East Germans who had turned up to enjoy Romeis'
hospitality included a family of six who ran out of money and were
unwelcome with their West German relations, and two teen-agers who
were obeying parents' orders to end their two-week adventure in the
West.
   Klaus-Dieter Krueger, 16, and Matthias Langner, 15, fled on a
motorcycle via Czechoslovakia on Nov. 4, just five days before East
Germany's surprise decision to open its borders.
   In a refugee camp near Cologne they received clothes and about
$100 from the government.
   ``We just stayed lazy and rode around the country,'' Krueger
said.
   Matthias' parents, taking advantage of the new travel freedom,
crossed the border, found the boys in the refugee camp on Thursday
and told them to come home.
   Matthias Paessler made his own decision to return after a year
and a half in West Germany.
   ``It's not bad over there but you dream too much about making a
career and all that,'' said Paessler. ``Back here, it's more
secure.''
   Living in a small Bavarian village with his family proved
frustrating.
   ``The young people were cold,'' he said. ``They gave you strange
looks if you didn't smoke hash with them. The girls had this
attitude of `I'm so rich.'''
   He worked odd jobs and made enough money to visit London,
Belgium and Canada, but couldn't afford his own apartment in West
Germany's extremely tight housing market.

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The pay raise and ethics bill Congress sent
President Bush early Saturday has less pay and ethics for the
Senate than the House _ and many senators say their decision to
take less of both will haunt them.
   ``We have done exactly the wrong thing,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth,
D-Colo. ``We have failed.''
   Senate leaders spent Friday imploring their colleagues to accept
the plan passed by the House Thursday _ to push $89,500
congressional salaries to at least $120,800 in the next 13{ months
and then bar members from padding their income with speeches.
   ``The House of Representatives demonstrated courage,'' said
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   But a majority of senators didn't buy it. Privately, it was said
Mitchell was three votes short.
   So he and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas regrouped
and pushed through a compromise to increase senators' salaries only
$8,900 and gradually, over many years, phase out the
much-criticized honoraria system.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., called it a ``safe chicken dance''
and predicted a new Senate salary-honoraria fight next year.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said the Senate demonstrated
``cowardice'' and made itself an even more elite institution for
the wealthy than it already is. ``We have failed the country, we
have failed the institution and we have failed its future,'' he
said.
   The House, which stayed in session past 1 a.m. Saturday awaiting
Senate action, took about 30 seconds to send the bill to the
president who is expected to sign it. The bill gives Bush's
Cabinet-level aides and federal judges the same percentage raises
as the House.
   House and Senate leaders waited until only a few days before the
planned adjournment of Congress for the year to push the package
through. Compared to a failed attempt at a 51 percent pay hike
early this year, their strategy gave opponents little time to mount
a campaign against it.
   But consumer advocate Ralph Nader, a critic of any congressional
salary boost, said that when the Senate blinked at the House
package, it opened the door for opponents to win repeal later.
   ``The disparity now between the House and the Senate versions
will further encourage next year a major repeal drive of the entire
package and will probably affect the next election,'' he predicted.
   By careful design, the biggest part of the House pay raise _ 25
percent on Jan. 1, 1991 _ is delayed until after next year's
elections. That way, members cannot be accused of voting themselves
a whopping pay increase _ at least not one that takes effect before
their constituents have a chance to express their displeasure at
the voting booth next fall.
   House members seemed comfortable with that delay, and with
getting rid of honoraria. It was James Madison who more than 200
years ago suggested that Congress approve pay raises for itself
only to take effect in the next Congress.
   ``Somehow, I just have this visceral feeling we look better than
the other body,'' said House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.
``I'd be willing to bet a good deal that they'll be adjusting their
own scenario within a year.''
   Seven years ago, in a similar situation, the Senate earned less
than the House for about six months before passing a catchup raise.
   The pay package finished Saturday is quirky and complex, and the
Senate will actually earn more than the House in 1990 before
falling behind in 1991.
   For the House, the federal judges and government executives, a
4.1 percent raise will take effect as soon as Bush signs a
deficit-reduction bill that Congress hopes to send him by Monday.
   Then, on Jan. 1, the Senate will take a 9.9 percent raise and
the House and the others a 3.6 percent raise. That would bring
Senate salaries to $98,400 and House salaries to $96,600 for 1990.
   On Jan. 1, 1991, the House will get a 25 percent raise to
$120,800. Both chambers also get whatever government-wide cost of
living adjustment is given at that time.
   The House bans its members from pocketing honoraria checks in
1991, but the Senate, which now allows its members to take more
than the House, decided to start now reducing honoraria
dollar-for-dollar as its salary goes up over the years.
   In 1990, House members can keep $26,850 in honoraria, the same
as in 1989. The Senate reduces its limit of $35,800 to $26,568.
   For both chambers, the legislation caps other outside earned
income at 15 percent of salary, and restricts lawmakers from being
paid members of boards of directors or performing other
professional services. Book royalties from legitimate publishers
are exempted.
   Rules on accepting gifts and free travel from other than family
are tightened.
   In addition, lawmakers and Cabinet-level administration
officials are barred from lobbying in their old branches of
government for a year after leaving office. Government employees
who get special knowledge from working on treaties or trade
agreements are barred from turning around and hiring out to private
interests who need that knowledge.
   However, in a compromise with the Bush administration, the bill
also softens recently-enacted laws on government procurement that
the administration contends are too burdensome.

   Congress is a step away from abolishing the
year-old Medicare program designed to protect retirees against
being bankrupted by the costs of a catastrophic illness.
   Senate negotiators reluctantly agreed Saturday morning to a
House demand that catastrophic coverage be repealed. However, a
Republican senator who led the battle to scale back the program
vowed to use whatever tactic is available in the closing days of
this year's session to prevent repeal.
   ``Every elderly group in America ... has come out loud and clear
that they do not want repeal,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said
after hearing of the negotiators' action. He indicated he will
filibuster in an effort to keep part of the program alive.
   Repeal, he said, would be an incredible injustice. ``Starting in
January, people now in nursing facilities will be ejected ... after
20 days,'' McCain said as an example of what many of the nation's
32 million retirees will be losing by repeal.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas also urged the Senate to
fight repeal.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee and a vocal opponent of repeal, said ``there was a lot of
deep disappointment (in his committee) starting with me'' because
of the House negotiators' refusal to back away from their
insistence on repeal.
   Despite McCain's filibuster threat, repeal is considered nearly
certain. That is because if the repeal bill is rejected, it is
quite likely this late in the congressional year that the existing
law would remain on the books. Few members of either house want
that.
   The House already has voted once for repeal by a lopsided
margin. Although the Bush administration has said it would prefer
to keep the program intact, congressional say they would expect
President Bush to sign a repeal bill.
   The catastrophic health coverage was enacted with heavy
bipartisan support last year as the largest expansion ever of the
Medicare program.
   But catastrophic protection quickly ran into a barrage of
complaints from some retirees. Many complained that they didn't
need the new federal protection because they already have
catastrophic coverage through a private plan or a retirement plan.
   Many higher-income retirees were outspoken against the program
because they were hit with having to pay an income surtax of up to
$800 a year to finance most of the program. They argued that such a
health benefit should be paid for by all taxpayers _ not just
middle- and upper-income retirees.
   The mail was so heavy against the program that the House had no
trouble voting to repeal, over objections of its Democratic
leadership. The Senate thwarted the repeal effort at first,
accepting instead a scaling back sponsored by McCain.
   The McCain amendment would repeal the surtax and coverage for
drugs and doctors' fees but retain coverage for hospital bills.
Those benefits and some relatively minor ones, including hospice
care and once-a-year mammograms, would be financed by continuing
and increasing the flat $4 monthly premium paid by most retirees.
   Even if the law is wiped off the books, catastrophic protection
for many of the nation's poorest retirees would continue being
provided through the federal-state Medicaid program.
   The catastrophic program began providing coverage for hospital
bills late Jan. 1. In the absence of repeal, protection for
doctors' fees and some prescription drugs would begin next Jan. 1.
   Under the program, a retiree could have an unlimited hospital
stay and pay no more than $560 a year. Next year, a person's
out-of-pocket payments for doctors' bills would be limited to
$1,370 a year.

   A crowd estimated at 50,000 shouted
anti-Communist slogans and burned portraits of the nation's ousted
leader Saturday at the biggest independent protest rally in
Communist Bulgaria's history.
   The magnitude of the rally, the fact that it was officially
sanctioned, and the police indifference toward it underscored the
fast speed of political change that has gripped this Balkan nation
since Todor Zhivkov was removed from power Nov. 10.
   One participant called it a ``miracle.''
   The crowd in downtown Sofia, the capital, cheered as sociologist
Petko Simeonov called for free elections and freedom of speech.
   At the end of the three-hour demonstration, they adopted by show
of hands a declaration calling for an end to corruption, the
abolition of censorship, release of political prisoners, guarantees
for freedom of religion, and an end to police repression.
   ``Todor Zhivkov has left us with empty shops, corruption,
bureaucracy and despair,'' said Simeonov, who is also a leading
member of Ecoglasnost, an independent environmental group.
   He demanded a criminal investigation and court action against
Zhivkov. Similar demands were heard during an official rally in
Sofia on Friday.
   The crowd, reported by organizers to total some 50,000,
responded by shouting ``Zhivkov to court!'' and ``Down with Zhivkov
and his aides!''
   Zhivkov was removed as Communist Party chief Nov. 10 and as head
of state Friday, and several of his associates were removed from
positions of power. They included Zhivkov's son, Vladimir, who was
kicked out as the head of the culture department in the Central
Committee.
   At a Parliament session Friday, deputy Slavcho Trnski launched
an unprecedented attack on Zhivkov, accusing him of indulging in a
``flamboyant lifestyle'' while Bulgaria fell into economic crisis.
   He said Zhivkov owned 30 homes, was ``hungry for fame'' and
retained power for 35 years through a policy of ``divide and rule.''
   Zhivkov, 78, was replaced by Petar Mladenov, 53, the former
foreign minister, who said in a French television interview
broadcast Friday that he supports free elections.
   The sudden downfall of the hard-line Zhivkov was yet another
major change to hit Eastern Europe in recent months. It followed
East Germany's decision to open the Berlin Wall, Hungary's move
toward democracy, and the installment of a government in Poland not
led by Communists.
   The crowd carried hundreds of banners and sketches, some showing
Zhivkov behind bars and with an Adolf Hitler mustache painted over
his face. Some burned portraits of Zhivkov and chanted
anti-Communist slogans.
   The emotional gathering in Sofia, organized by Bulgaria's
unofficial human rights and ecological groups, was held on a vast
square in front of the Aleksander Nevski Orthodox Cathedral.
   ``This is the return of democracy in Bulgaria, and a miracle we
have not seen for 45 years,'' Hristofor Sebec, a priest and
Ecoglasnost member, told The Associated Press.
   ``Bulgaria is going toward democracy, maybe even a multi-party
system. It will not be easy to reach that goal, but we will
manage,'' said another Bulgarian, Peter Beron.
   Some banners read, ``We are the victims of repression,''
``Christ is Our Savior,'' ``My family has nothing to eat'' and
``Freedom and Democracy Now.''
   The crowd shouted, ``We want a new constitution!'' They also
called out the name of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
architect of East bloc reforms. Mladenov's name was also heard, but
not so often.
   ``The one-party system is the symbol of totalitarian rule,''
said Radoy Ralin, Bulgaria's best-known writer of satire and other
prose and one of 15 speakers at the demonstration.
   Ralin and other speakers criticized what they called
``repression of ethnic Turks under the Zhivkov regime.''
   About 320,000 Bulgarian ethnic Turks have fled ethnic and
religious persecution here and settled in Turkey.
   Hundreds of uniformed policemen, some sitting in buses at a
distance, watched the crowd and listened to the fiery speeches
without intervening.
   Indirect criticism of Mladenov was heard as some speakers
denounced newly elected Politburo members hand-picked by the new
leader.

   Ethiopian rebels say they have captured a
small town 85 miles north of the capital of Addis Ababa and halted
a government counterattack.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi late
Friday, the Tigre People's Liberation Front said its fighters took
the town of Meranya Thursday and repulsed troops counterattacking
southward from Desse, the capital of Wollo Province.
   The rebel claims could not be independently verified. The
government, in its own communique Friday, made no mention of
fighting around Meranya.
   However, the official Ethiopian news agency said government
forces ``repulsed recently an offensive by the TPLF against Desse
from all fronts.''
   The government has rarely commented on the Tigrean offensive,
which began in late August when the insurgents pushed southward out
of Tigre into Wollo and neighboring Gonder provinces.
   If true, the front's claim means its forces have moved southward
past Desse, a heavily armed government garrison that they were
unable to capture in heavy fighting last month. Desse controls a
vital junction on the road from Addis Ababa to Assab, one of only
two Ethiopian ports on the Red Sea.
   The government and the rebel front met in Rome last week for the
first time in their 14-year-old conflict, but neither side has
commented on what were described as preliminary peace talks.
   The government is scheduled to meet in Nairobi on Monday with
representatives of another major insurgency, the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front.
   The Eritreans have been fighting since 1961 for secession.
   The Tigreans say they want to replace Ethiopia's Marxist regime
with a democratic government, although the Tigrean rebel leadership
itself is considered Marxist.

   Hundreds of jubilant mixed-race
people ended a year-old boycott of white-owned stores Saturday,
declaring victory after the government said it would scrap the
segregation law they were protesting.
   Nearly 1,000 residents of Reiger Park, a mixed-race section of
Boksburg, crowded into taxis, cars and seven banner-draped buses
for a motorcade through the main business district. Grateful white
merchants greeted them with welcome signs and free champagne.
   ``This is our victory day,'' said Danny Cassel, an organizer of
the boycott. ``We have shown that we cannot be taken for granted.''
   The motorcade ended its procession outside the civic center
where, in October 1988, the City Council voted to resegregate
public facilities that had been opened to all races. Control of the
council had just been won by the far-right Conservative Party,
which opposes easing of apartheid laws.
   Under the Separate Amenities Act, the council had the right to
re-establish whites-only admission policies at Boksburg's main
park, library, a sports complex and other facilities. The move was
widely criticized, both by anti-apartheid groups and the governing
National Party, yet the government made no move at the time to
scrap the 36-year-old act.
   On Thursday, however, President F.W. de Klerk announced the act
would be repealed as soon as possible after Parliament reconvenes
in February.
   In response, the Save Boksburg Committee decided Friday night to
call off the boycott it launched in the industrial city 12 miles
east of Johannesburg.
   De Klerk also declared that all whites-only beaches should be
opened to all races. Johannes Oosthuisen, the Conservative mayor of
the southern town of Mossel Bay, said Saturday he would fight to
maintain segregation at the town beach and that a ``spirit of
rebellion'' is rising among whites opposed to integration.
   In Boksburg, however, there was pervasive mood of good will.
Reiger Park residents chanted ``Black and white will live
together,'' white onlookers waved to them, and smiling store owners
shook hands with customers returning for the first time in months.
   ``Viva Boksburg,'' shouted people hanging out the windows of the
buses as they moved through the city.
   During the boycott, the city council had refused to back down
despite pressure from shopowners. Reiger Park residents generally
observed the boycott throughout the year, but some blacks from the
nearby township of Vosloorus had begun returning to Boksburg stores.

<HEAD>Cosmic Explorer Launched by NASA's Last Unmanned Rocket</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA launched its last
unmanned rocket Saturday to sent a satellite on a mission to study
how stars and galaxies evolved from the ``big bang'' that created
the universe 15 billion years ago.
   ``It was a joyful ride,'' Dennis McCarthy, deputy project
manager, said after the $150 million Cosmic Background Explorer
spacecraft was placed in a orbit by a 116-foot, two-stage Delta
rocket.
   Excessive wind between 17,000 and 20,000 feet delayed the
blastoff for 10 minutes, but at 6:34 a.m. the $70 million rocket
lifted off from Space Launch Complex 2 and thundered into clear
skies above this coastal military base.
   ``It was magnificent,'' NASA spokesman C.J. Fenrick said. ``The
rocket as it was rising appeared like a bright fluorescent light,
and about seven seconds later we heard the sound of the rockets and
saw a spiraling contrail of smoke.''
   The rocket's nine strap-on boosters fell into the Pacific Ocean
west of the Channel Islands.
   About an hour later, the Explorer was safely in a 559-mile-high
orbit after it was released by the Delta's second stage. Seconds
later, the Explorer deployed its antennas and large solar power
panels to reach its full 16-by-28-foot size.
   The rocket is the last expendable, unmanned rocket that NASA
plans to launch. Except for space shuttles, all future NASA
payloads will be launched by either Air Force or privately owned
rockets.
   After a 30-day shakedown, the 4,850-pound Explorer will start
measuring microwaves, heat and other ``cosmic background
radiation'' left over from the big bang _ the explosion scientists
say created the universe about 15 billion years ago.
   ``It is the first space mission ever launched to probe the
earliest stages of the universe,'' said deputy project scientist
Nancy Boggess. ``We'll reach back further than any telescope or
space mission has done before, back to the time before there were
stars, before there were galaxies _ a time when the universe was
very young.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes Explorer
will produce the most comprehensive observations ever of the early
universe and the processes that shaped it to form stars and
galaxies.
   ``It really is a search for our ultimate roots,'' Boggess said.
``Our planet is only 4{ billion years old. The universe is much
older. It would be nice to know when did stars and galaxies form
from which our own planet and solar system formed.''
   NASA once planned to launch the Explorer from a space shuttle,
but diverted it to the Delta after the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   NASA stopped buying rockets in the early 1980s and decided to
launch payloads from shuttles after its booster inventory was
exhausted. After the Challenger explosion, the space agency
admitted it was wrong to rely on the shuttle. But then-President
Reagan ordered the agency to stop launching commercial payloads and
give such business to private industry.
   Launch commentator George Diller said the rocket that carried
the Explorer was the 183rd Delta launched by NASA, the 189th Delta
ever launched _ including those sent into space by the Air Force
and private companies _ and the 339th expendable rocket of any type
launched by NASA.
   To measure cosmic background radiation during its one- to
two-year mission, the Explorer will use the most sensitive
detectors of their types.
   Scientists believe that at the instant of creation, a single
point of matter exploded into a hot, dense and extraordinarily
uniform sphere of gas containing electrically charged particles.
That sphere eventually developed lumpiness that spawned the
galaxies and stars.
   The sphere still is expanding. By measuring radiation from the
distant sphere, the Explorer will actually look back in time.
   In addition to the satellite and rocket, Explorer project costs
include $160 million for personnel at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center in Maryland and about $20 million for operations and data
analysis through the end of the mission, agency officials said.

<HEAD>Army Claims to Defeat New Tamil Militia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops backed by cannons
and shoot-to-kill orders claimed Saturday to have defeated a new
Tamil militia accused of killing 38 Moslem policemen in the eastern
Ampara district.
   Fighting that broke out early Thursday tapered off Saturday in a
power struggle that followed last month's departure of 4,000 Indian
peacekeeping soldiers.
   According to reports from the area, the Tamil militia initially
attacked Moslem policemen and civilians. Then the predominantly
Sinhalese Sri Lankan army, backed by helicopter gunships, swept in
to rout the Tamil militiamen.
   About 70 people may have been killed in the two days of
fighting, according to reports from government officials and local
residents.
   On Saturday, hundreds of Sri Lankan soldiers moved into six
camps used by the militia, which calls itself the Tamil National
Army, free-lance photojournalist Jake Gavin said from Ampara.
   Gavin quoted an army brigadier as saying the situation in Ampara
was under control but at least 50 people had died.
   ``The so-called Tamil National Army has been neutralized in
Ampara. We have taken over their camps, and we figure at least 500
members of this illegal army were in existence in Ampara and are
now on the run,'' the brigadier was quoted as saying. He refused to
give his name.
   The government said earlier the Tamil militiamen attacked four
police stations within a 15-mile radius of Ampara early Friday. It
said at least 18 policemen and soldiers and 25 militiamen died in
the fighting in nearby Kalmunai, Sammanturai, Akkaripattu and
Chavalakady.
   Gavin said residents reported at least 38 unarmed policemen were
massacred in Karativu alone early Friday. He said Ampara residents,
adding up various reports, believed at least 72 people died in
fighting throughout the district.
   The Ampara district in on Sri Lanka's east coast, where the
population is about equally divided among Tamils, Sinhalese and
Moslems. Ampara is part of the area where Tamil separatists tried
to set up an independent homeland by massacring or driving out
Sinhalese in the mid-1980s.
   India has agreed to withdraw all its 40,000 troops from Sri
Lanka by Dec. 31. They were deployed in 1987 to help enforce a plan
to grant Tamils limited autonomy in the north and east. The mainly
Hindu Tamils say the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese majority
descriminates against them.
   India was drawn into the internal affairs of its small island
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own politically powerful
Tamil minority.
   India was to supervise a surrender of arms by Tamil guerrillas.
But the largest Tamil militia, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, reneged on the deal. Indian soon found itself bogged down in
a jungle war with the Tamil Tigers, the same group that once found
sanctuary on Indian soil for its battle against Sri Lanka's
Sinhalese majority.
   Sinhhalese make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people
and Tamils comprise 18 percent. Seven percent of the population is
Moslem, a group largely immune from the ethnic violence until the
last two years when they started coming under attack from Tamil
militants.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,100 Indian soldiers, have
died in the Tamil separatist war since 1983.

   A tourist bus on a foggy Golan Heights highway
apparently swerved to avoid a car and overturned into a ravine
Saturday, killing a West German woman and injuring 50 others
aboard, police said.
   Druse Moslem villagers, Jewish settlers, military doctors and
emergency medical service workers from the nearby town of Kiryat
Shmona helped in the rescue operations.
   Those hurt included 48 tourists from West Germany, an Israeli
guide for the group and the driver, an Arab from east Jerusalem,
police said.
   No injuries were reported among the passengers of the car, which
left the scene of the accident.
   Police said the accident occurred on the Masada-Banias road in
the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights and that the bus apparently
swerved to avoid a collision with a car that came in the opposite
direction and grazed the bus.
   Witnesses said the bus overturned and rolled for about 50 yards
down the slope of a steep ravine before being stopped by old oak
trees and boulders. The vehicle remained on its roof, they said.
   Boaz Norkin, head of emergency medical service in Kiryat Shmona,
said the injuries included bruises, cuts and broken limbs. He said
the injured were taken to a hospital in the Galilee town of Safed,
where they were reported to be out of danger.
   The name of the dead woman was not released. Israel radio said
families of the victims, elderly West Germans, were informed of the
accident through their country's embassy in Israel.

   The Voice of America, the government-operated
radio station, has praised dramatic reforms under way in the
Eastern Bloc but says they haven't gone far enough, according
several recent editorials.
   ``The U.S. government welcomes the East German government's
decision to open its borders to those wishing to emigrate or
travel,'' said one editorial written on Nov. 14. ``It is a step in
the direction of a Europe which is whole and free.''
   The VOA, part of the U.S. Information Agency, broadcasts in 43
languages to countries abroad. Its charter forbids it from
broadcasting in the United States.
   VOA allows outsiders to review its editorials, take notes on
them and print material from them, but they can't be photocopied.
   Michael G. Gartner, the president of NBC News, says VOA's
decision to grant anyone access to the editorials and to print from
them stems from a policy change that resulted from a federal
lawsuit he filed in Des Moines last year. The suit was later
dismissed.
   VOA officials contend their policies remain unchanged, but they
acknowledge they've taken step to make sure open procedures are
followed.
   Several recent editorials, which are identified as reflecting
the views of the U.S. government, underscore other statements from
some U.S. officials that they were taken by surprise by the pace of
the rapid-fire changes, such as the opening of the Berlin Wall last
weekend.
   For instance, on Oct. 28, the VOA said the East German
government had made only ``vague promises'' in response to its
citizens' demands for freedom and democracy.
   It praised Hungary's reforms, and added: ``There is a profound
lesson for the East German government in the Hungarian example.''
   On Nov. 5, a week before the East Germans opened the 28-year-old
Berlin Wall, a VOA editorial said the East German leadership has
``far to go in establishing freedom of travel to all countries as a
fundamental right protected by law.
   ``Many of the recent refugees chose to flee chose to flee their
homeland because they have no faith in Communist Party leader Egon
Krenz' promise to carry out reforms,'' the editorial said.
   It continued: ``As one refugee said, `Krenz is making a lot of
promises, but we do not believe him. We do not see any future and
certainly not for our children.'''
   While thousands of East Germans who fled the country primarily
though Czechoslovakia before the dismantling of the Berlin Wall
have remained in the West, millions of East Berliners simply
crossed over the border for a visit before returning home.
   The Nov. 14 editorial pushed for further reforms in East
Germany, including free elections, a free press, independent trade
unions, market-oriented changes and parliamentary control of the
country's security police.
   Reports from East Germany on Nov. 15 indicated leaders had
agreed on some reforms like liberal foreign trade rules, more
private enterprise, reduced central planning and a greater role for
women.
   Often, the editorials stress the evils of communism.
   In discussing the opening of the wall, the VOA said the
structure ``has been a monument to the failure of communism for 28
years and last weekend's events are now confirming that failure.''
   Another editorial Oct. 7 said: ``October 7 is the 40th
anniversary of the establishment of East Germany but for the
government of Erich Honecker there is little cause for celebration.
   ``Forty years after its creation, communist East Germany has
clearly failed to establish itself as an acceptable alternative to
democratic West Germany.''
   Quoting President Bush, the editorial said, ``The United States
looks forward to the day that Germans will not have to climb
fences, freeze in embassy courtyards or dodge bullets in order to
enjoy the fruits of a free society.''

<HEAD>Special Prosecutors Take Over Case of Police Shooting of Boys</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state attorney general's office is
providing special prosecutors in the investigation into the fatal
shootings of two 13-year-old immigrant boys by a police officer
after a stolen-car chase.
   Prosecutors Robert Stanich and Mary Theisen of the attorney
general's criminal division will present the case to a Dakota
County grand jury as early as Dec. 4, officials said.
   The grand jury will be asked whether police officer Kenneth E.
Murphy, 54, was justified in firing the shotgun blast that killed
Thai Yang and Basee Lor, both of St. Paul, on Wednesday.
   The boys were shot in the back from about 30 yards away while
fleeing through a field in suburban Inver Grove Heights after
abandoning a stolen car that had been chased there, investigators
said.
   Officials and family members, who are Hmong immigrants, said the
two boys who were killed and a 14-year-old companion who was
captured unharmed all had been arrested before.
   The Hmong are a Southeast Asian people who largely sided with
the United States during the Vietnam War. Many have immigrated to
the United States since then, primarily to California and
Minnesota, and some have suffered joblessness and adjustment
problems since being resettled.
   Two community meetings have been scheduled to deal with anger
among Asian-Americans in the Twin Cities following the shooting
deaths.
   Murphy told investigators he fired after Yang turned toward him
and held up what Murphy thought was a gun. It was a screwdriver,
investigators said.
   If the shooting is deemed unjustified, the grand jury could
indict Murphy on criminal charges, deputy attorney general Steve
Kilgriff said. Kilgriff would not be more specific.
   Murphy's lawyer, Paul Rogosheske, said, `If they're saying the
shooting is unjustified, he could be convicted of murder.''
   State law forbids officers from using deadly force unless it is
necessary to protect themselves or others from death or great harm
or to arrest or capture a felon who has killed or greatly harmed
someone.
   Inver Grove Heights Police Chief Stanley Troyer said the
department's internal affairs file for the past five years contains
no complaints against Murphy.
   The suburban police force has received some telephone death
threats since the shooting, Troyer said. St. Paul police have
ordered patrol officers not to ride alone until emotions calm.

<HEAD>Blast Kills 3 British Soldiers; IRA Suspected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A roadside blast killed three
British soldiers on patrol in Northern Ireland on Saturday, hours
after a car bomb at an English garrison town injured an army
sergeant and his wife.
   The sergeant lost both legs in the explosion, Essex county
police said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility, but police and the
Home Office suspected the Irish Republican Army, which has targeted
army installations in England and continental Europe as well as
Northern Ireland in its bloody campaign to drive the British out of
the province.
   The British army patrol was in two armored Land-Rovers in the
foothills of the Mourne Mountains, about six miles from the Irish
Republic, when an explosive device was detonated, apparently from
beside the road, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   The blast hurled the first vehicle off the road. All the
casualties were in that vehicle, police said. The men in the second
vehicle ecaped injury.
   Helicopters flew into the area to help the injured soldiers, but
three died before they could be treated, police said. A fourth was
seriously injured and hospitalized in Belfast.
   At the British army headquarters for eastern England in
Colchester, 50 miles northeast of London, a car bomb exploded as
off-duty staff Sgt. Andrew Mudd and his wife were setting out from
the parking area at the married quarters, police said. The two were
dragged from the burning wreckage of their car by a lieutenant who
was driving past, witnesses said.
   One neighbor said the car was ``a mass of flames.''
   Ronald Tuckwell, who lives nearby, said he saw the car on fire
from his bedroom window. ``People had pulled the occupants out when
there was a sudden burst of flames and the whole car was
engulfed,'' he said.
   His neighbor John Clouting said, ``The front of the car was
blown apart. I could not see very much because of the smoke.
   ``I knew people had been injured because someone was carrying a
white quilt to put over them. I could hear screams. It sounded like
a child, but it could have been a woman.''
   Army spokesman Gordon Williams said, ``The soldier involved was
off duty. I suppose he would be going shopping with his wife, doing
the normal Saturday things.''
   The couple were taken to Colchester General Hospital where
General Manager Mark Shackell said Mudd had lost both legs and was
in serious condition in the intensive therapy unit after 4{ hours
of surgery. He said Mudd's wife, whose name was not released,
suffered ``relatively minor'' injuries.
   David Waddington, the Home Office secretary, blamed the outlawed
IRA, which is trying to end British rule in the predominantly
Protestant province and unite it with the Roman Catholic Irish
Republic.
   ``They will never be allowed to achieve by the bomb and the
bullet what they cannot achieve through the ballot box,''
Waddington said.
   Authorities sealed off part of Colchester, the third-largest
garrison town in Britain. Houses near the scene of the blast were
evacuated as bomb squad officers conducted an investigation.
   About 4,500 troops are based at Colchester, which is army
headquarters for the 11-county eastern district.
   The Ministry of Defense stepped up security at military
establishments across Britain after the Sept. 22 IRA bombing at the
Royal Marines Music School in Deal, southeast England, that killed
11 men.
   The IRA has also claimed responsibility for a series of attacks
on British servicemen and their families in West Germany. A
soldier's wife was killed this summer and a 6-month-old girl died
last month with her father, a Royal Air Force corporal, in an IRA
attack.
   Since the province's sectarian fighting began in 1969, 266
police, 601 army personnel, and 1,902 civilians have been killed.

   The American labor movement staged an
impressive show of solidarity last week, but such a celebration
might prove difficult to arrange again unless the mounting
complaints of minorities are addressed.
   Blacks and Hispanics are a vital constituency if unions hope to
grow, yet they still are largely excluded from labor's leadership.
   Women, too, have had their share of disputes with the
federation, but won a partial victory last week in moving the
federation closer to taking a position in the volatile debate over
abortion.
   Black and Hispanics labor activists, however, left the AFL-CIO's
biennial convention empty-handed and frustrated by what they deem
the hypocrisy of federation leaders who denounce Supreme Court
decisions seen as setbacks to affirmative action but refuse to
broaden minority representation in their ranks.
   ``I leave this convention a disillusioned delegate, but not a
defeated trade unionist,'' Oscar Sanchez of the United Steelworkers
union said after Hispanics failed again to win a seat on
federation's governing Executive Council despite constituting 10
percent of the AFL-CIO's 14.1 million members. ``We will return.''
   Black labor leaders, who saw their representation on the
33-member board fall by one seat, expressed similar frustration,
saying recruitment of minorities for unions could suffer unless
blacks and Hispanics are welcomed into the council, which consists
of two black men, three white women and 28 white men.
   The complaints come at a time of clear evidence that the
Hispanic work force is expanding rapidly _ an estimated 8 million
Hispanics are working but not members of unions _ and that blacks
are more likely to join unions than whites. Labor Department
figures for 1988 show that 23 percent of employed blacks were union
members, compared to 16 percent for both whites and Hispanics. The
modest 90,000 growth of union membership last year was entirely
attributable to blacks, whose membership in unions rose by 114,000
to offset declines among both whites and Hispanics.
   ``It is very difficult for us to understand why Hispanics are
not represented on the highest council,'' said Jack Otero, vice
president of the Transportation and Communications Union.
   That exclusion makes it difficult to convince unorganized
Hispanics that joining unions is in their best interests, Sanchez,
Otero and other Hispanic labor leaders said in an unusual public
criticism of the federation's leadership during the convention.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said he and other members of the
council were ``deeply cognizant'' of the contributions of Hispanics
and hoped to soon add one to the council. Privately, some of the
Hispanic leaders said they were growing tired of such vague
commitments.
   ``It is a question of credibility,'' said William Lucy,
secretary treasurer of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees and president of the Coalition of Black Trade
Unionists. ``It's difficult for me to say we in the labor movement
are sensitive to the needs of black workers when we do not have
fair representation at the highest level.''
   Lucy said Hispanics deserve the next vacancy on the council but
that blacks should not have to wait for at least one and preferably
two or more slots. The coalition last week demanded a meeting with
Kirkland, who is expected to agree to the request soon.
   ``It has to come from him, in a determined way,'' Lucy said.
``If Lane said `we must do this, I want it done and done now,' then
it would happen.''
   Kirkland, in a recent interview, said, ``I hope in time we can
deal with that,'' when asked about demands for expanded minority
representation on the council.
   He said he hoped the progress would come naturally through
election of minorities to presidencies of affiliated unions,
positions from which virtually all of the council members are drawn.
   Both of the blacks who serve on the council, Gene Upshaw and
John Sturdivant, are presidents of their unions but prospects for
more blacks rising to such posts with major unions in the near
future appear dim.
   In the meantime, Lucy says Kirkland must back up his stated
commitment with action, suggesting the council be expanded by
several seats to allow for addition of an Hispanic and at least one
more black.
   Kirkland added seats in the past to appoint a black women and to
allow the Teamsters a seat when they rejoined the federation, but
this year allowed a death and retirements to bring the number back
down to 33.
   ``I see no magic to the number 33,'' Lucy said. ``It's not that
Lane is anti-black or anti-Hispanic. What he is is pro-tradition.
But these are not traditional times.''
   Lucy avoids talk of racism but when asked whether he thought a
majority of council members shared his goals he laughed and said:
``No, I'm sure most of them like things just the way they are.''
   Lucy blames the lack of progress on a system that allows the
Executive Council in closed sessions to handpick candidates for
rare vacancies.
   ``We are not fairly represented in the room to begin with, and
then the dealing starts,'' he said. ``Things just aren't going to
change with the current process. And things have to change.''

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Egon Krenz was too
busy to receive him, but otherwise all went well for a swami who
returned to East Berlin on Saturday to retrace a bizarre flight
over the Berlin Wall six years ago.
   Officials at East Berlin's government headquarters on the
near-deserted Marx Engels Platz were nonplussed but welcoming when
Swami Vishnu Devananda showed up in his flowing pink and orange
peace robes to present a thank-you message to Krenz for opening the
Berlin Wall.
   ``They're swearing in the new government right now. Times are
changing and Mr. Krenz is a bit busy,'' an official at the
headquarters explained. ``But we'll see he gets the letter.''
   Swami Devananda later said he received a personal welcome from
Krenz as the party leader left the building, but there was no
official confirmation.
   The swami, head of the Svinanda Yoga Vendata sect based in
Canada, was arrested last time he dropped by in 1983.
   On that visit, he flew over the wall from West Berlin in a
motorized kite with a bunch of flowers, landed in a field outside
the eastern sector and, after six hours under arrest, was sent back
over the wall.
   On Saturday, the 62-year-old swami drove through the Checkpoint
Charlie border post, offering a homemade ``peace passport.'' The
border guard turned that down, examined the real one and then waved
the silver-haired swami and three followers through.
   At the government building, guards smiled cheerfully when the
swami settled down on the sidewalk for a yoga session.
   ``You're very happy now. Last time everyone was uptight,'' he
said.
   In his letter to Krenz, the swami asked for the motorized kite
back. But officials told his followers earlier in the week that it
had been destroyed.
   On Friday, the swami released peace balloons and pigeons at the
wall in a day of commemoration that went wrong.
   The balloons and most of the pigeons flew West and a model plane
built to commemorate the original flight crashed twice before
buzzing round the West Berlin airstrip from where he took off
secretly in 1983.

<HEAD>Congress Trying to Protect Pensions While Avoiding Employer `Bailout'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is eyeing several measures to provide
more protection for Americans' pension plans, but it faces warnings
that employers will start ``bailing out'' if confronted with
increased regulation.
   ``There are already some laws with a level of complexity that
the experts can't even figure out,'' said Paula Calimafde, a tax
lawyer and president of the Small Business Council of America.
   Congress in 1974 enacted the historic Employee Retirement Income
Security Act to protect retirees from abuses in their pension
plans. Already complex at its birth, the law has remained fluid and
further changes are proposed.
   In moving to reshape the system, lawmakers must walk a fine line
between strengthening protection for workers and retirees and
creating even more complicated laws that could cause some employers
to terminate plans.
   ``Increasing regulations make it more difficult,'' said Kathy
Utgoff, the former head of the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, which is the federal insurer of pension funds.
   ``People will start bailing out,'' she warns.
   The nation's private pension system is huge, with assests of $2
trillion in plans that cover 76 million Americans.
   The measures before Congress cover a host of pension issues.
Some would limit employers' ability to drain surpluses from pension
funds. One would increase the premium companies pay to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which is $1.5 billion in the red.
Still others would increase penalties for violations and require
more thorough auditing.
   One of the most pressing issues is regulation of surplus money
in pension plans. Many programs grew during the years of a rising
bull stock market. Now, the excess dollars are an inviting target
for corporate raiders or managements seeking to pay off debts.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., refers to the pension surpluses as
``an almost irresistable, unguarded bank vault.''
   Since 1980, about $20 billion in these ``overfunded'' pension
assets have been taken out of funds by employers. In pension
parlance, this is called reversion.
   Current law says a surplus can be taken only if a plan is
terminated and has enough money to pay off its obligations to
retirees.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has proposed legislation that
would require employers to establish a new pension plan before
withdrawing money from the old one.
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins has introduced a bill that would allow
the excess money to be transferred into health programs.
   Last week, Rep. Bill Hughes, D-N.J., held a one-day hearing in
his select committee on aging to look into charges of possible
fraud and abuse in the system. Those warnings have been coming from
the Labor Department's own inspector general's office.
   The acting inspector general, Raymond Maria, told the hearing
there is a ``window of opportunity'' for fraud because of lax
enforcement of existing laws, dependance on civil rather than
criminal remedies and inadequate audits of plan reports.
   An assistant labor secretary, George David Ball, said he would
look into Maria's recommendations but testified that the pension
system has ``never been healthier.''
   Hughes dismissed such assurances, saying, ``I heard the same
sectors saying the savings and loan situation wasn't serious five
years ago.'' He called the amount of money in the system ``an
invitation to disaster.''
   Hughes said stricter enforcement is needed to identify
violators. ``Unless we have criminal penalties, severe criminal
penalties for those who commit egregious offenses, you're not going
to deter,'' he said.
   He is asking the General Accounting Office to examine some 1,600
pension plan investigations handled by the Labor Department in
1988. Only 23 of those were classified as criminal cases.
   Hughes said he doesn't believe increased legislation would cause
employers any undue hardships. ``You hear the same argument any
time you tighten laws.''
   But Dallas L. Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit
Research Institute, a trade group, said in an interview there
``must be a balance between enough regulation and enough reporting
to not have fraud and not make it so overwhelming in your effort to
do so.''
   There appear to be no definitive figures on how many small
businesses opt out of pension plans because of regulation. The
federal insurer received notificaion of 10,790 terminations in
plans of all sizes in 1988.
   Hazel Witte of the U.S. Small Business Administration said it is
completing a study on the subject.
   Lisa Phillips, an aide to Lantos, said Congress must not push
too hard. Employers already are burdened with paperwork and
auditing expenses, she said.
   ``There is no law requiring a pension fund. When you regulate
it, you get withdrawals,'' she said.

<HEAD>Strict Rules, Remodeling Turn Hellish Housing Project Into Award

<TEXT>
   Until recently, kids at the Crook Manor
housing project fed their drug habits there.
   Teen-agers hawked cocaine on the street and in the back
hallways. Toddlers played on patchy lawns that were nothing but
needles and weeds. Mothers tapped the grapevine to find out when
someone was carrying a gun in the project, so they could haul their
children indoors.
   ``Eight murders in eight years'' was the unofficial slogan.
   But three years ago, Crook Manor began its own Cinderella story
with a $6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
   Today the big drug deals are history. The place has new sod, new
paint and a new name: Galego Court. The 450 tenants can join
tutoring and anti-drug programs, field trips to baseball games and
a youth group that holds dances. There's also a guardhouse at the
entrance manned by an off-duty policemen to keep out unwanted
visitors, and strict rules on who may live there.
   As a result, small children play outside in safety. And while
the stain of the project's bad reputation means 12-year-old Monique
Bentil still can't persuade fearful school friends to sleep over,
residents say they wouldn't live anywhere else.
   ``They got new people and the place is unbelievable,'' said
Angel Roman, a disabled truck driver who is president of the Galego
Court Tenants Association. The group's members meet once a month,
learning grass-roots democracy and self-esteem as they go along.
   ``There are people here that are poor people,'' said Roman, 45.
``But they are decent people. Now they have a nice home.''
   The change is so stunning, the project has won national public
housing awards, including one from HUD this month. Some have
suggested it's too good to be true and it won't last.
   ``It's a very fragile success story,'' acknowledges John
Burgess, who as head of the Pawtucket Housing Authority has
orchestrated Crook Manor's makeover.
   ``The most important word in this fight is `attitudes,' when you
convert tenants to your way of thinking,'' Burgess said. ``It's a
long process, but the tenants became believers.''
   Burgess knows that chasing out the drug dealers only moved the
problem up the road. ``That doesn't solve the national drug
problem, but I can't do that.''
   Galego Court _ the name, like the unfortunate Crook label, is
that of a local dignitary _ has 15 brick and clapboard buildings
opened in 1953 on a former dump in this industrial city of 70,000
north of Providence.
   For urban public housing it is a small complex. A key to its
upgrading was making it even smaller. The original 228 one- to
five-bedroom units were reduced to 164, mostly by closing off
third-story units. The remodeling also included replacing
troublesome hallways with outside entrances for each apartment.
   During the remodeling, troublesome tenants were evicted. Now,
prospective tenants must pass a strict background check and for the
first six months submit to monthly inspections which their children
must attend.
   Those who lived here during the worst troubles in 1983-85
describe a place where teen-agers paced the road that snakes around
the project, pressing drugs on everyone who dared to enter the
property. Dealers fought over customers and over prices. Car
windshields got smashed when a seller was turned down. One man was
shot in the back for turning a peddler down.
   Crook Manor was a major transfer point for cocaine shipments
between New York, Providence and Boston, said Police Cmdr. Richard
DeLyon. ``The place was rocking and rolling,'' DeLyon said, and
youngsters used drugs like candy. ``It would be like Popsicle
land.''
   During the renovation, many guns were found hidden behind
kitchen appliances, he added.
   Cynthia Clayton grew up in Crook Manor and got tangled in the
wildness.
   Childhood was ``people hanging out. Drugs, guns and shooting,''
said Ms. Clayton, now 20. ``It was hard because I got in with it.
I'm always one of those people that follow.''
   At 14 she had a cocaine habit. At 15, she was punching her
mother. They fought and filed charges against each other. At 16 she
quit drugs but a year later she quit school. Now she is expecting a
baby and unemployed. But Cynthia has joined her mother Shirley, 49,
in studying for a high school diploma through classes at the
project.
   Mrs. Clayton calls her daughter ``my mouthpiece'' but, urged to
speak up, the resident of 20 years said the improvements please
her, too.
   All in all, Mrs. Clayton said, ``It's a lot better.'' Will it
last? ``God only knows that,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A super Saturday for Woolworth's was a lost
weekend for its snootier neighbors on West Berlin's elegant
Kurfuerstendamm shopping strip.
   For the second straight weekend, East Berliners jammed the
sidewalks around the ``Ku'damm,'' as the street is known, until
police blocked off streets to handle the overflow.
   ``We're the ones who feel walled in,'' complained a manager at
Leiser, a store with little choice but to push cheap sneakers
instead of expensive footware on the street named after ranking
German princes of the Holy Roman Empire.
   East Germans, with their $54 of ``welcome money'' from the West
German government, couldn't afford the more expensive fare.
   Trash bins were full to the brim with beer bottles, pop cans and
banana skins, a reminder that East Berliners call West Germany a
``banana republic'' and mean it as a compliment because the
tropical fruit is so rare back home.
   There were no free bottles of champagne this weekend, but there
was the same feeling of good cheer and even a little nostalgia for
the giddy days just after the opening of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9.
   Sidewalk merchants hawked T-shirts and buttons bearing the magic
Nov. 9 date and the boast: ``Ich war dabei!'' _ I was there.
   Katrin Kupfer, 16, and three companions from Dresden said they
had each spent all of their $54 of ``welcome money'' from the West
German government, buying clothes and a Walkman and saving money by
sleeping all night in a shopping center.
   ``When I got here I thought I was hallucinating, there were so
many lights,'' she said. ``At 3 a.m., people are still coming and
going here. At home, forget it.''
   Gerd Friedrich had his family up at 6 a.m. to drive in from
Leipzig, and they went to the upscale Ka De We department store to
buy chewing gum and candy bars for the return trip. ``It's a little
more costly here, but back home it doesn't taste as good,'' said
his son Lars, 10.
   At Woolworths, crowds were so heavy that employees controlled
the doors and made some people wait. ``A very big day,'' especially
for chocolates, cosmetics and toys, manager Martin Woestmann told a
reporter.
   ``Another day, I'd have more time. Not now,'' he said
apologetically, and darted down an aisle.
   The manager at the Leiser shoe store wouldn't give her name _
she was just a branch manager, she explained _ but she wasn't
withholding her misgivings about the new West Berlin.
   ``The only thing we can sell are these tall sneakers,'' she
said, pointing to a rack on the sidewalk, not the place where her
store usually displays merchandise.
   This Saturday, the market was for $21 sneakers and $5.40 socks,
not for $215 wingtips or sleek pumps.
   ``It is very difficult for our customers,'' said the manager,
whose fur-trimmed black leather coat set her apart from the
shoppers in well-worn cloth coats.
   Beneath the World War II-damaged tower of Berlin's famous
Memorial Church, the free market of ideas was bustling.
   ``We need a coordinated traffic plan,'' said a speaker at
talkfest set up by the Social Democratic Party and inflicted on the
masses by huge loudspeakers.
   ``Germany needs Jesus Christ,'' said a Seventh-day Adventist
preacher with a lower-powered microphone. A little ways away, a
dour woman in a blue raincoat wore a placard extolling the joys of
free love, while Hare Krishnas tinkled their cymbals nearby.
   ``Test the West!'' said one big banner _ not the way of life,
but a brand of cigarette. Employees offered to swap East German
smokes for their brand and found plenty of takers.
   One West Berliner had parked a truckload of beer along the
sidewalk and pitched one-pint cans at $1.10 each.
   ``Come closer!,'' he yelled. ``We'll rip you off just like the
next stand.'' That got a good laugh from the East Berliners.
   Kurfursten, or electors, were German princes entitled to take
part in choosing the sovereign head of the Holy Roman Empire, which
existed from 962 to 1806. Damm is German for roadway.

<TEXT>
   The silent majority of
Salvadorans, who never have taken sides with the rightist
government or the leftist guerrillas, are damning them both for
turning their neighborhoods into battlegrounds.
   Fear and desperation have the run of bloody streets barely
traveled by city dwellers, who live day in and day out through
combat and curfew. The massacre and mutilation of six priests, all
prominent educators, added to the terror.
   Speaking with a reporter Friday in the capital's battle-ravaged
Soyapango district, the father of a family of five criticized both
the government for sending warplanes to rocket and strafe his block
and the dug-in guerrillas who converted the neighborhood into a
military objective.
   Asked his name, he provided it, and the reporter wrote it down
in his notebook.
   ``Wait a minute,'' the man said, and calmly took pen and pad
from the journalist's hand and blacked out his name.
   ``They'll come and get me, and I'll end up like her,'' he
explained, nodding toward a girl about 13 years old, lying dead six
feet away.
   The girl had ventured out in search of food during a lull in
combat and was felled, apparently by a stray bullet.
   It has been battle after battle since some 2,000 Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front rebels descended on San Salvador and its
1 million people on the evening of Nov. 11 and turned it into a war
zone.
   About 2,000 more attacked dozens of targets in other parts of
the country. The fighting here and elsewhere continued throughout
the week, and relief workers have been unable to evacuate the
wounded or remove bodies.
   The fighting slackened Saturday, allowing thousands of exhausted
residents to evacuate with their children and whatever possessions
they could carry.
   Casualty figures are sketchy. Hospital and military sources
estimate that more than 800 people have been killed and 2,000
wounded.
   In the combat zones, decomposing bodies lie here and there,
shiny bloated semblances of human bodies, a nauseating odor filling
the air.
   ``We're not with one side or the other, thank God,'' Marta
Rodriguez said as she and her family closed their house in the
devastated Soyapango section of Conacaste, scene of some of the
fiercest alley-to-alley and house-to-house fighting, and fled the
area.
   Each of her family of five had eaten one tortilla with a few
sips of coffee Thursday, when they ran out of everything except a
gallon of water.
   The facade of their humble cinderblock home was cratered with
bullet and shrapnel holes, the yellow metal door sporting seven
bullet holes, and part of the roof blown off.
   ``The two sides must join in a heartfelt dialogue. They must
abandon the idea of dialogue as something strategic,'' said Carlos,
her husband.
   It is a call echoed by many here and in the rest of Central
America to end the 10-year-old civil war that has killed more than
70,000 people, most of them civilians.
   In one of the war's most barbaric acts, a death squad entered
the Jesuit-run Central American University on the city's southern
edge before dawn Thursday and broke into the residence where the
rector, the vice-rector and four other educators were sleeping.
   The victims, all members of the Society of Jesus, were awakened,
slaughtered and their brains removed.
   It was a pointed message to other intellectuals who, like the
progressive priests, sought to elaborate on the need for change in
a society that has benefited few while condemning the great
majority to ignorance, misery and early death.
   University officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniforms
enter the priests' residence just before the shooting. However, the
U.S.-backed right-wing government denounced the killings and said
it would investigate.
   A state of siege suspending most individual liberties and
guarantees has been in effect a week. In many regards, the measure
does not affect the lives of the poor, whose right to life and
liberty _ much less the pursuit of happiness _ has never been paid
more than lip service.
   The measure imposes censorship and voids freedom of expression.
   It also has drastically altered radio programming _ and the
radio is in most cases the poor Salvadoran's only link to the world
beyond his adobe house, cornfield or slum.
   The government has obliged all stations to plug into an official
network, on which enthusiastic announcers describe a capital
rapidly returning to normal, of stoic and smiling workers and
homemakers resuming their routines.
   ``The government says it's got everything under control, that
everything is fine,'' said another man in Soyapango, who like
hundreds of desperate residents was out looking for some place to
buy some beans or bread.
   ``But we're being badly informed, as you can see for yourself,''
he said, pointing two blocks down the road where guerrillas with
assault rifles and a grenade-launcher manned a barricade that
isolated the district.

   Prince William, 7-year-old son of heir-to-the
throne Prince Charles, will go to boarding school next year,
Buckingham Palace said.
   William is to attend Ludgrove School in Berkshire county, 10
miles from the Windsor Castle country home of his grandmother,
Queen Elizabeth II, and 35 miles from his parents' London home at
Kensington Palace.
   William, who will be 8 by the time he starts at Ludgrove, has
been attending Wetherby School in London.
   The choice of the 186-student school is a break with family
tradition. Charles attended Cheam Preparatory School, as did his
father, Prince Philip.
   Buckingham Palace announced Friday that Ludgrove had been the
``joint parental choice'' of Charles and his wife, Diana.
   Another royal offspring, 15-month-old Princess Beatrice, took
her first trip abroad, Buckingham Palace announced Saturday.
   Her mother, Sarah, the Duchess of York, slipped quietly out of
the country for a private vacation in Australia with her elder
sister, Jane. The Duke of York, Prince Andrew, is taking a
refresher course in England as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot.

<TEXT>
   The only gynecologist
serving an area of 110,000 people has left without warning, just
one indication of how the exodus of East Germans to the West has
caused a health care crisis.
   ``This is dramatic, of course,'' Dr. Hanns Wohlfarth, the acting
chief district physician, said of the gynecologist's departure to
the West from Karl Marx Stadt.
   By the end of September, before the government suddenly dropped
travel barriers, 100 doctors and 500 other medical staff had left
the Karl Marx Stadt district, Wohlfarth said Friday in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   The district's combined areas have a population of 2 million
people.
   He added that the subsequent opening of routes to the West made
it ``certain that the number has doubled by now, and may have
increased even further.''
   Other authorities estimate that 10 percent of East Germany's
doctors have emigrated, either legally or illegally. Wohlfarth said
Karl Marx Stadt, a city in southern East Germany, is among the
hardest hit.
   ``In some hospitals there is an emergency situation,'' he said,
citing the example of one nurse doing the work of four.
   But he said vital functions including intensive care and urgent
surgery have not been affected so far.
   This is partly because hundreds of people have been switched
from other jobs to replace ambulance drivers, technicians and
administrative staff who left, he said. About 300 army conscripts
are expected to join the support staff soon.
   Wohlfarth, a practicing dermatologist and a member of the
Communist Party, said he was ``personally shocked'' by the
departure of the doctors.
   He said it would be a ``genuine help'' if young doctors from
West Germany would temporarily replace those who had left.
   ``But it is much more important that the many East German
doctors and dentists who left come back. Think of their medical
ethics and, above all, think of the patients they left behind,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who 10 years
ago was inspired by the vision of a peaceful revolution in the
Soviet bloc, is telling Americans now that he foresees a united
Europe, without Cold War divisions.
   ``The wall that was separating people from freedom has
collapsed,'' Walesa told Congress last week in a speech celebrating
his success not only in creating free unions in Poland but in
forging the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc.
   The end of a divided Europe has long been a U.S. policy refrain.
But American decision-makers are being forced to examine the
prospect anew, and quickly, given the rapid changes under way in
Poland, Hungary and East Germany, symbolized by the opening of the
Berlin Wall.
   ``The wall itself is a paradox ... it is an abnormal
situation,'' Walesa said in an interview.
   The reforms in Poland and Hungary should lead to a political and
economic integration of Europe, ``a Europe in which there are no
borders,'' Walesa said. He said that with the destruction of the
Berlin Wall, East and West Germany should be reunited.
   ``The German problem must be solved, but as part of the
integration of the whole of Europe, and not against anybody,'' he
said.
   ``Not on the Nazi model, not the Stalin model, but a new and
wiser model that has to bring peace, tranquility,'' said Walesa,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983.
   East European reformers have been inspired in part by the
economic integration of Western Europe planned for 1992, said
Francis Fukiyama, a deputy director of the State Department policy
planning staff.
   ``If you look at Poland and Hungary, the prospect of being left
behind as the train leaves the station will stimulate the
introduction of market economies,'' Fukiyama said Friday in a
speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Integration of the European Economic Community is likely to
``heal the divisions of Europe,'' he said. ``We do look forward to
the EC playing an important political was well an economic role.''
   Meanwhile, Walesa said in a television interview on CNN's
``Newsmaker Saturday'' that a goal of his visit to the United
States was ``to prove, to demonstrate that the changes in Eastern
Europe are irreversible.''
   ``I have come to prove that Eastern Europe offers great
opportunities for business right now,'' Walesa said.
   He reiterated that ``Europe is one and must be integrated.
Primarily it must be integrated economically, so that it would be a
profitable solution for all. If political solutions are followed,
and economic solutions are put off, there won't be enough time for
those, for economic solutions.''
   Walesa's concept of an undivided Europe sounds a bit like Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's vision of a ``common European
home.''
   And President Bush expressed similar sentiments in a letter to
Gorbachev on Friday, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``He said the United States wants a calm and peaceful period of
change in Eastern Europe as Poland, Hungary and East Germany seek
to implement their reforms. The president said he believes these
historic steps will make a positive contribution to a Europe that
is whole and free,'' Fitzwater said.
   Walesa, steering Poland away from 45 years of what he calls
destructive Soviet control, clearly does not envision a Europe
under the Russian or German domination.
   German reunification ``is a complicated problem,'' he said,
adding that two world wars in this century started because of
German expansionism.
   ``I remember how much Europe and the world paid for Nazism,''
said Walesa, noting that Poland was the first nation invaded by the
armies of Adolf Hitler.
   Although he praised Gorbachev, Walesa was not willing to forget
the brutality of Josef Stalin, who imposed Communist rule on Poland
and the other nations of Eastern Europe.
   Discussing Solidarity's efforts to dismantle Poland's
Soviet-style economic and political system, Walesa said ``our task
is viewed with understanding by our eastern neighbors and their
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.''
   ``This understanding lays foundations for new relations between
Poland the U.S.S.R., much better than before. These improved mutual
relations will also contribute to stabilization and peace in
Europe, removing useless tensions,'' Walesa told Congress.

   A 115-year-old woman was feted on her
birthday Saturday with a private party for about 20 friends.
   Carrie White's big celebration comes Monday when hundreds of
people will honor the nursing home resident as the oldest person
alive and the oldest American ever based on records obtained by the
Guinness Book of World Records.
   ``She's doing fine. She's sitting out here in the lobby and we
just finished a private party,'' said Marjorie Allen, Mrs. White's
guardian. ``We had birthday cake and we sang.''
   The staff at Putnam Memorial Nursing Home has organized an
outdoor party under a tent for Monday.
   ``We have 750-some confirmed reservations, and we have a cake on
an 8-foot table,'' Mrs. Allen said. ``It'll pretty much fill the
table.''
   Mrs. White has impeccable records to back the claim she is 115,
which would apparently make her the world's oldest person. But the
records reflect a sad life behind the walls of a state institution.
   She was admitted to Florida State Hospital by her husband the
day after her 35th birthday in 1909. Hospital records described her
problem as ``post-typhoid psychosis,'' a term that isn't recognized
by doctors today.
   She was finally discharged in 1984.
   Mrs. White has lucid moments but won't answer questions about
her past. She sleeps about 16 hours a day, has a strong heart,
takes no medicine and seems nearly immune to colds and flu, her
care-givers say.
   She was born Carrie Joyner on Nov. 18, 1874, in Gadsden County
near the Georgia border.

<HEAD>Latvians Celebrate Independence Day at Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Lativians rallied Saturday in
the republic's capital of Riga to celebrate the 71st anniversary of
its declaration of independence.
   Anda Anspoka, a spokesman for the Latvian People's Front said,
said between 400,000 and 500,000 people gathered along the banks of
the Daugava River to commemorate the Soviet republic's former
independence, declared on Nov. 18, 1918 and lasting until Soviet
occupation in 1940.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, estimated the crowd at
tens of thousands, including Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov and
the republic's Communist Party leader, Janis Vagris.
   Gorbunov told local television reporters that he was there
because he believed that Latvia should become independent once
again, Anspoka said. The Tass dispatch did not mention that.
   On Nov. 11, the Latvian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, declared
Nov. 18 an official holiday and approved the rally.
   Activists at the rally waved placards demanding independence and
the demiliarization of Latvia, Anspoka said in a telephone
interview.
   Nearly every fifth person carried the national red and white
flags at the rally, the spokesman said. ``The place resembled a sea
of flags, a very impressing and spectacular sight.''
   He said the rally was well organized, with railway schedules
changed to accommodate Latvians who wanted to attend. According to
Anspoka, police presence was negligible and there were no reports
of violence or disorder.

   An early morning fire torched a crowded
mobile home Saturday, killing a woman and eight children, while the
mother of three of the victims watched helplessly screaming ``My
babies! My babies!'', officials and witnesses said.
   ``We're thinking it may have come from one of the kerosene-type
portable heaters,'' said Jimmy Maynor, chief of detectives for the
Robeson County Sheriff's Department. ``We're not positive on that.''
   Temperatures had dropped to about 32 degrees when the blaze
broke out about 4 a.m. in a trailer owned by Lois Ann Hunt, 32,
officials said.
   Maynor identified the victims as Mrs. Hunt, 32; her children,
Alisha Ann Hunt, 12; Melissa Sue Hunt, 11; Bobby Ray Hunt, 3; Nikki
Marie Hunt, 3; and Larry James Dial, 5; and three other children,
Cystal Lynn Locklear, 5; Glenford Locklear, 4; and Daniel Presley
Locklear Jr., 2.
   The Locklears were the children of JoAnn Locklear, 25, of
Maxton, who escaped with a burn to her left arm. Her boyfriend,
Richard Eugene Tyndall, 22, of Laurinburg, also escaped. He
received a cut to his hand after trying to get back into the house
through a window to rescue the others, Maynor said.
   Tyndall also had to restrain Ms. Locklear from running back into
the burning trailer, said a neighbor, Angie Locklear.
   ``She was hollering, `My babies! My babies!','' said Angie
Locklear. ``She wanted to go back in and get them.''
   By the time firefighters arrived, the trailer was engulfed in
flames, officials said.
   Angie Locklear said she heard an explosion and first thought it
was a gunshot, but ``when I looked out, all I could see were
flames.'' It was not immediately clear whether the two Locklear
women are related; the name is common in the region.
   Two of the bodies were found in one bedroom, six in another
bedroom and the woman was in a bedroom by herself.
   ``I have been told they were calling for help, so they probably
perished from flames,'' Maynor said.
   An arson team was at the scene sifting through the remains of
the trailer, which was destroyed. Behind the trailer, hogs and
goats were kept in sheds and two lines of clothes were hanging out
to dry.
   Neighbors said Mrs. Hunt had moved her mobile home to the wooded
lot located near U.S. 71 about a year ago and had just started work
at a fast food restaurant three weeks ago.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mob bosses probably ordered the killing of a
low-level associate accused of murdering a federal drug agent this
year, authorities said Saturday.
   ``Mob justice isn't always swift, but it's always deadly, and
this may be an example of deadly mob justice,'' James Fox, head of
the New York FBI office, said at a news conference.
   Costabile ``Gus'' Farace, 29, was shot Friday night as he sat in
a car, the same manner in which he was accused of killing Everett
Hatcher, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was posing as
a drug buyer.
   Hatcher's death Feb. 28 sparked a manhunt that involved up to
100 federal agents working seven days a week, and it prbably made
the Mafia bosses angry, said U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney.
   ``It's reasonable to assume all of that pressure could have
resulted in last night's shooting,'' Maloney said. ``The intensity
of the investigation never faltered. It was a full court press as
recently as yesterday.''
   Farace also was to be featured Sunday as the country's ``No. 1
fugitive'' on the Fox network television show ``America's Most
Wanted.''
   Maloney described Farace, who was paroled in 1988 after serving
eight years for a kidnap-murder, as a ``young punk'' associated
with the Bonanno and Colombo crime groups.
   ``I think it's reasonable to assume organized crime figures were
aware of the intensity of the investigation,'' Maloney said. ``I
assume that people higher up were as interested in finding him as
we were.''
   Robert Stutman, head of the DEA's New York office said: ``A
rational and prudent person would obviously believe that this is
probably a mob hit. The investigation is continuing; I can't say
that for sure.''
   Stutman said Farace, who grew a beard and dyed his hair red
while hiding out, apparently never left New York City. He said
agents at times had come within two hours of Farace but he always
disappeared with the help of mob associates.
   Authorities hoped that by capturing Farace they could make him
the first defendant to face the death penalty under a new federal
drug law, Stutman said.
   ``It would have been nice to see him sitting there and
squirming, knowing he'd never see the streets again,'' Stutman said.
   Hatcher, 46, was shot to death in February on Staten Island
after he went to meet Farace to set up a cocaine deal in an
undercover operation, authorities said.
   On Friday, Farace was sitting in the front passenger seat of a
car double parked on a Brooklyn street when a van pulled alongside
about 11 p.m. Seven to nine shots were fired into the car, Maloney
said.
   Farace was found dead. The driver, Joseph Sclafani, who had been
hit in the chest three times, got out of the car and fired a few
shots from his .38-caliber handgun at the fleeing van, Maloney said.
   Sclafani, 24, was listed in critical condition at Coney Island
Hospital.

<HEAD>Romania Imposes Travel Restrictions, Security Checks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Romania has imposed security checks and
travel restrictions on travelers seeking to enter or leave the
country.
   Police near the border with Hungary were removing Romanian
citizens from trains leaving the country and turning many back,
according to other passengers.
   The restrictions, coming in advance of a Communist Party
congress, began Friday. Travelers aboard one train said at least 70
people were ordered off and some were subjected to body searches.
   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu has rejected the political
and economic reforms sweeping Hungary and Romania's other Warsaw
Pact allies.
   Tanjug, the Yugoslav news agency, reported vehicles with foreign
license plates were being checked by Romanian border police and
said ``this is a sign of the difficult situation surrounding the
14th congress'' of the Romanian Communist Party that opens Monday.
   In a report from the Romanian capital of Bucharest, Tanjug said
security measures were increased throughout Romania and identity
checks were being carried out at airports and railroad and bus
stations.
   Tamas Oltvanyi, reporting for Hungarian state television from
Bucharest, said all roads leading to the Romanian capital were
controlled by police and ``people are being turned back at the
border.''
   Hungarian Lt. Col. Laszlo Fenyoe said that on Saturday 575 of
1,308 people planning to travel from Hungary to Romania were
refused entry by border police regardless of their nationality or
destination. He said those travelers were not given any reason but
on Friday police told some of the people turned back that ``the
hotels are full.''
   ``Those being turned away include not only Hungarians but also
Czechoslovaks, Turks, Dutch, West Germans, Poles, you name it,''
Fenyoe told The Associated Press.
   The Hungarian news agency MTI said at the Hungarian Nagylak
border crossing trucks were delayed for 10-12 hours Saturday before
being allowed to proceed and no reason was given for the blockage.
   A duty officer at the Romanian Embasy in Budapest said he had
not been notified ``about any such problems.''
   Hungarian-Romanian relations were difficult even before
Ceausescu's government maintaianed its hard-line stand against
reforms. Hungary has accused Romania of discriminating against the
1.7 million ethnic Hungarians living in Romania who claim they are
denied essential rights as a minority.

<HEAD>Horns Toot, Motorists Cheer Reopening of Bay Bridge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorists cheered, tooted their horns and
raised victory signs as the Bay Bridge reopened exactly one month
after an earthquake ruptured the main artery between Oakland and
San Francisco.
   ``What a moment _ you've just got to be here,'' said Roger
McCune of Piedmont, among the first motorists to pay his $1 toll
and head across the 53-year-old bridge at 11 p.m. Friday. ``It's
something we had to do.''
   Six California Highway patrol cars and 13 Bay Bridge toll
trucks, sirens wailing and lights flashing, led the first cars in a
triumphant procession westbound across the empty upper deck to San
Francisco.
   Ever since the quake shut the 8.5-mile bridge _ the world's
longest high-level span _ Bay Area commuters have suffered through
choking gridlocks on the bay's four other bridge crossings.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit set ridership records as the huge
disclocation drove workers by the thousands from their cars. The
emergency also geared up ferry runs not seen for 30 years _ ever
since the bridges killed the ferries. Some groups have organized to
try and keep the ferries going.
   ``I'm going to keep this forever,'' a laughing Darin Holzen of
suburban Pinole said, waving his toll receipt. Many cars rolled by
with occupants waggling V-victory signs out the windows or giving a
thumbs-up.
   The joyful scene was a stark contrast to the grim instant at
5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, when a 7.1-magnitude quake centered 70 miles
away jolted the area, killing 66 people and causing an estimated $7
billion in damage.
   The temblor sent a 50-foot-long, 250-ton section of the upper
deck crashing onto the lower deck, killing one woman in a car.
   Technicians and engineers rushed to complete a $2.5 million
repair job that ordinarily might be expected to take months instead
of weeks. Included in the job was 18 months worth of scheduled
maintenance that left the bridge sporting a shiny new coat of
silver paint.
   Especially pleased at the festive reopening was Sam Hassoun, a
structural engineer with the California Department of
Transportation who had been working on the bridge every day for a
month.
   ``I'm more than happy,'' he said at the toll plaza, wearing his
orange reflective vest and hard hat. ``Everything is A-OK.''
   ``It's almost like a grand opening celebration,'' bridge toll
captain John Sant said, surveying 17 operating toll lanes.
   Although the bridge is back in the commute loop, workbound
motorists aren't going to have much of a picnic on Monday because
important freeway connections on both sides of the bay are still
knocked out. They include the collapsed portion of Interstate 880
in West Oakland, where the greatest number of quake victims
perished.
   ``We had a traffic problem here even before the quake,'' said
Bob Halligan, a spokesman for the transportation department. ``Now
people will have to decide if they want to sit in their cars for
hours on the Bay Bridge, or do they want to get to work?''

<HEAD>Coast Guard Plans Cleanup Next Week After Ship Runs Aground in Bering
Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cleanup of oil from a Greek cargo ship
that ran aground in the Bering Sea will begin sometime next week,
with the start-up time depending largely on the weather, the Coast
Guard said.
   Representatives of the Coast Guard and the ship's owner went to
the scene Friday to assess options for oil cleanup and the ship's
salvage.
   The 485-foot Milos Reefer ran aground in 57 mph winds and
22-foot seas late Tuesday off St. Matthew Island, about 250 miles
off the west coast of Alaska in the Bering Sea National Wildlife
Refuge.
   The ship had no cargo, but tanks carrying 258,000 gallons of
fuel oil and 71,320 gallons of diesel oil were damaged.
   Officials haven't determined how much oil spilled, but a survey
Thursday indicated about 2,000 gallons of heavy oil were in the
water near the ship. A lighter slick of undertermined size was seen
about six miles to the northeast.
   Observers in an aircraft Friday saw heavy patches of oil between
the ship and a beach, Coast Guard spokesman Ed Moreth said.
   No damage to birds or wildlife has been documented, the Coast
Guard said. Thirty walruses were seen on a nearby island.
   St. Matthew Island has no human inhabitants and provides summer
nesting areas for birds. State environmental officials are
concerned rats from the ship will swim to the island and damage
nesting sites.
   Burning the Milos Reefer to destroy fuel and rats is a
possibility if other salvage options are unworkable, said Bill
Lamoreaux of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
   The ship's owner, Transcontinental Maritime Trading of Piraeus,
Greece, has accepted financial responsiblity for the accident and
the spill. The 27 crew members were transferred Wednesday onto a
Polish ship that took them to Dutch Harbor.
   Two Coast Guard C-130 transport planes from Sacramento, Calif.,
arrived Thursday night in Kodiak with pumps, containment booms and
other spill equipment.
   The cutter Midgett left Kodiak Friday to serve as the operations
platform for cleanup work, and is expected to reach the spill scene
early in the week. The buoy tender Firebush, based in Kodiak, will
ferry cleanup equipment to St. Matthew Island.

   Thirteen of the 14 men have died of cancer-related illnesses,
and the 14th had surgery for bladder cancer, said attorney Bruce
DeBoskey, who is handling their workers' compensation cases.
   ``There is a consistent pattern of accidents, injuries and
exposure to radiation that has put these men's lives at risk,'' he
said.
   The 14 men were involved in plutonium processes used in the
manufacture of triggers for nuclear weapons at the troubled Rocky
Flats plant. Some of the cases date back to the early 1950s just
after the plant was opened, DeBoskey said.
   Ed Heintz, a spokesman for Rockwell International, which
operates the plant for the Energy Department, declined to comment
on the allegations Saturday, citing ongoing litigation and federal
Privacy Act restrictions.
   ``We don't discuss health issues as they relate to our employees
simply because it would violate their privacy,'' Heintz said.
   Rocky Flats is one of 17 facilities in the DOE's nuclear weapons
complex.
   In recent months, the plant has been the target of a criminal
probe into allegations of illegal hazardous wastes disposal. A
federal grand jury is considering evidence gathered in the case,
but it has not issued any indictments.
   DOE is in the process of replacing Rockwell as the plant's
contractor. EG&amp;G Inc. of Massachusetts is scheduled to take over
operations Jan. 1.
   DeBoskey, a civil ligitator with the law firm of Silver and
DeBoskey, said he has filed eight workers' compensation cases
involving Rocky Flats employees in the past decade.
   He has won two, settled one out of court and lost two. In the
past two months, DeBoskey has finished trial work on two other
cases, which are awaiting a ruling from an administrative law
judge. One case is pending in the Court of Appeals.
   The cases name as defendants DOE, Dow Chemical Co., which
operated the plant until 1975, and Rockwell, which took over
management from Dow.
   Two additional cases will be ready for trial next fall, and he
is looking into possible litigation involving four other workers,
he said.
   ``Each case is different,'' he said. ``Some of these men have
had autopsies in which the tissues were tested for the presence of
radiation. Typically, we find it easier to win a case where we know
how much radiation was in the body at the time of death.''
   The cases amount to a ``David and Goliath kind of thing, (with)
a widow of a Rocky Flats worker taking on Dow Chemical, Rockwell
and the U.S. government,'' he said.
   ``She's not taking on an employer, she's taking on the whole
system,'' he said.

   Masked assailants stabbed and beat to death an
Arab woman Saturday and Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinians
in the occupied territories, wounding at least 11, hospital
officials reported.
   They identified the woman as 40-year-old Atiyat Inajar and said
she died of the wounds at the Nasser Hospital in the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis.
   Palestinian reporters in the Gaza Strip said she was suspected
of immoral behavior and of providing assistance to Israeli
authorities. The Israeli military command confirmed the death and
said the killing was under investigation.
   Her death brought to 147 the number of Palestinians slain by
Arabs on suspicion of being pro-Israeli collaborators during the
23-month uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip.
   At least 615 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire in
the revolt, and 42 Israelis have perished in the violence.
   Arab doctors said troops opened fire to disperse stone-throwing
Palestinian youths in the Gaza village of Beit Hanoun and the Shati
refugee camp, wounding eleven protesters aged 16 to 23.
   The army command said it had no information about the incidents.
   Isa Ali Sabah, 29, of El-Khadr village near Bethlehem, died at
East Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital Saturday after suffering head
injuries when stones were thrown at his car in the West Bank last
month. Israel radio said Sabah lost control of his car during the
assault and it crashed.
   The broadcast quoted Arab residents as blaming Jews for the
attack. Police said they no information about the case.

<HEAD>Senate Vote Sends Aid to Poland, Hungary to Bush's Desk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon urged President Bush on
Saturday to forgo his threatened veto and sign a three-year
authorization bill that calls for up to $938 million in U.S. aid to
Poland and Hungary.
   ``Freedom in Poland needs our help,'' Simon, D-Ill., said in a
statement asking Bush to sign the bill despite unrelated abortion
provisions opposed by the White House.
   The Senate gave final approval to the bill early Saturday as
House and Senate negotiators overcame legislative roadblocks after
a personal appeal from Polish union leader Lech Walesa for rapid
financial assistance. The voice vote sent the measure to the
president's desk.
   But an appropriations measure providing $533 million in hard
cash for Poland and Hungary this year is still awaiting action on
the Senate floor.
   And Bush has threatened to veto the whole package because it
includes aid to the United Nations Population Fund. Abortion
opponents are against the provision because the agency operates in
China, which has restrictive limits on family size and allegedly
imposes forced abortions.
   The Eastern European assistance includes programs for Poland
with a value of $846.5 million. Hungary would receive benefits with
a total value of $91.5 million.
   ``This plan is both a wager and an investment,'' Simon said in
his statement. ``It's a wager on Poland's experiment with
democracy, and it's an investment in our security. We should gamble
a little on freedom.''
   ``I urge the president to sign this bill _ before Lech Walesa
leaves this country _ and to make America a full partner in
Poland's struggle for freedom,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican said Saturday it completed
``open and cordial'' talks this week with Czechoslovakia on the
appointment of new bishops in the Communist country.
   The talks, from Tuesday through Thursday in Rome, focused on
``issues concerning the life of the Catholic Church in
Czechoslovakia and, in particular, several bishops' nominations,''
the statement said.
   ``The results of the talks will be presented to respective
higher authorities for further consideration,'' it said.
   Church-state relations generally have been cold in the Communist
country, and seven of Czechoslovakia's 13 dioceses still have no
bishops.
   But there have been signs of a thaw.
   In June, the Roman Catholic Church succeeded in placing three
new bishops in Czechoslovakia, the first new bishops there in 15
years.
   An estimated 10,000 Czechoslovak pilgrims were allowed to attend
the Nov. 12 beatification in Rome of Agnes of Bohemia, a
Prague-born nun, and the ceremony was broadcast live on
Czechoslovak state television.

<HEAD>Snow In Lower Great Lakes, Cold Grips Midsection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snowstorms blanketed the lower Great Lakes on Saturday, dropping
up to a foot of snow in northeast Ohio and causing a rash of
accidents, and unseasonably cold weather chilled the nation's upper
midsection.
   Snow showers reached from much of New York state to northwest
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. Up to 8 inches of snow was
forecast for northwest New York state. Scattered snow fell on
northern Maine, as well as southeastern North Dakota and eastern
South Dakota.
   In northeast Ohio, travel near Lake Erie was hazardous if not
impossible in some areas, the National Weather Service said.
Columbus got only a dusting of snow overnight, but it formed ice on
bridges, closing Interstate 70 through downtown.
   There was a rash of accidents, including a 15-car pileup on
I-70. Near the eastern Ohio town of St. Clairsville, a van carrying
members of the Muskingum College women's basketball team was hit by
a tractor-trailer on the icy interstate, killing two women and
injuring five.
   Rain fell in south-central Texas, along the upper Texas coast
and in northwest Florida and northwest Oregon.
   During the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST, 2 inches of snow fell
at Traverse City, Mich., and 1 inch fell at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
   Winds gusted to 60 mph at Vedauwoo between Cheyenne and Laramie,
Wyo. Wind advisories were posted for the mountains of Southern
California, as well as areas below major passes and canyons. A
high-wind watch was posted through Sunday for the mountains of
Wyoming.
   Unseasonably low temperatures settled across the Upper
Mississippi Valley and the Upper Great Lakes.
   Low-temperature records for the date were set in Alpena, Mich.,
where it was 9 degrees; Burlington, Iowa, 10 degrees; Duluth,
Minn., 0; Lamoni, Iowa, 11; Mason City, Iowa; 0; Rochester, Minn.,
minus 4; Sioux City, Iowa, 4; Spencer, Iowa, 4; and Waterloo, Iowa,
5.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states Saturday was minus
10 at Warroad, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 12
degrees at Grand Rapids, Minn., to 80 degrees at Naples, Fla.

   It sure looked like funny money. But
consumers and merchants have been assured the $100 bills are real _
even though some of them have ink that smudges and flakes.
   Approximately $400,000 worth of $100 bills shipped to a Wichita
Falls bank by the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas are the product of
a printing mishap or experimental ink, officials say.
   ``The only problem is them being so new (that they are) so
crisp. If you crumple it up, the ink will flake off in some places
_ like you can still see the signature, but part of it will be
faded because the actual ink is gone,'' said Elsa Suarez, an
investigative assistant with the Secret Service in Lubbock.
   The Secret Service, the Federal Reserve and the bank that began
distributing the $100 bills sometime over the past two weeks said
they are still legal tender.
   The bills are smeared slightly around the $100 insignias in the
corners, said Ms. Suarez.
   However, the bills are on Treasury Department paper and the
serial numbers match Federal Reserve records. About $300,000 of the
flaky bills have been put into circulation.
   Police and the bank began receiving calls about the bills last
week.
   Mary Loe Rosas, a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve in Dallas,
said they weren't aware of the problem until investigators
contacted them. She said the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was
made aware of the problem and they were tracking down the cause.

<HEAD>Santa Train Gives Out Tons of Toys</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KINGSPORT, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toys, candy and holiday cheer arrived on
schedule for thousands of children in Appalachia on Saturday as the
Santa Train Special made its 110-mile journey through the region's
coal fields for the 47th year.
   In Elkhorn City, Ky., Jared Williamson got his wish. The
4-year-old stood clutching a ball shortly after the train stopped
while candy and toys rained down on the surrounding crowd.
   Rusha Sikes watched nearby as her grandchildren joined other
youngsters gathering up the dolls, stuffed animals, food, paper and
games thrown from the back of a four-car train by Santa Claus and
several helpers.
   ``I brought my children when they were small,'' she said.
   For Sikes and many of the estimated 25,000 people who lined the
tracks between Pikeville, Ky., and Kingsport, Tenn., the train has
been a tradition for generations.
   Sponsored by CSX Transportation and the Kingsport Area Chamber
of Commerce, the Santa Train started in 1943 as a way for Kingsport
merchants to thank residents of the coal fields of southeastern
Kentucky and southeastern Virginia for patronizing their stores.
   ``It's sort of an institution,'' said Tim Hensley, a railroad
vice president.
   Donations of toys and candy from people and companies all over
the country filled a train car and weighed an estimated 10 tons.
Money also is donated each year and goes to fund a college
scholarship to someone from the area.
   Dozens of CSX and chamber officials take turns helping Santa
throw out presents. The train winds slowly through the area for
more than eight hours, passing small groups of people scattered
along the tracks in rural areas and making several brief stops at
bigger towns along the route.
   E.B. Blankenbeckler, a Kingsport printer, has ridden on the
train since its second year.
   ``I've always thought that it would continue because it gave us
so much satisfaction,'' he said of the tradition.
   Frank Brogden, vice president of public relations for Tennessee
Eastman Co. and Santa since 1984, said handing out the presents is
strenuous, but rewarding.
   ``You get a great deal of excitement seeing the joy,'' he said.
   Allen May has heard plenty about the excitement recently. He
stood at the stop in Elkhorn City while his five children, ages 4
to 12, picked up toys.
   ``They've asked me for the last two weeks when the Santa Train
was coming,'' he said.
   The train took on added significance this year because of the
United Mine Workers' 7{-month strike against Pittston Coal Co.
Presents from the Santa Train may be the only ones some children
receive this year, organizers said.
   ``It's gonna be hard; it really hits them hard,'' said David
Hill, the train's engineer for the second year.
   ``It's kind of sad some of the people you see,'' trainmaster Jon
Whittenberger said. ``There are some families up here that are just
destitute.''
   The temperature was near freezing when the train pulled out of
Pikeville at 7:30 a.m., and only rose into the 40s during the ride.
Some people lining the tracks early in the day had no coats, and
others built fires to keep warm.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada
arrived in Sweden Saturday night on his way to the Soviet Union,
where he hopes to increase trade and diplomatic ties.
   Mulroney was met by senior foreign ministry officials and
Canada's ambassador, Dennis Brown, after he landed at Arlanda
International Airport to begin a weekend visit.
   On Monday, he flies to Moscow for a six-day Soviet visit, the
first by a Canadian prime minister in 18 years. He is expected to
sign trade agreements after meeting Tuesday with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He leaves for Kiev on Thursday and concludes the trip with a
stop in Leningrad.
   They also could sign an agreement for increasing Arctic
cooperation in such areas as science and technology. Canada,
however, has said any Soviet proposals for demilitarizing the
Arctic should not be discussed bilaterally but only in
international forums.
   Mulroney, who went to Moscow briefly in 1985 for the funeral of
Konstantin Chernenko, is the first Canadian prime minister to make
an official visit to the Soviet Union since Pierre Trudeau traveled
there in 1971.
   The Soviet Union has a consulate in Montreal and has wanted to
open a second consulate in Western Canada. Toronto's Globe and Mail
newspaper reported Saturday from Moscow that in exchange, the
Soviet government appears willing to let Canada open a consulate in
Leningrad or Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine.
   Many of the 750,000 Canadians of Ukrainian descent live in
Western Canada.
   A delegation of Canadian business leaders led by Albert
Reichmann will visit the Soviet Union simultaneously for the
inaugural session of the Canada-U.S.S.R. Business Council.
   Among proposed Canadian construction projects are a Moscow
skyscraper that would be built by Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.,
the Toronto-based company of the Reichmann family that has projects
under way in New York, London and other cities.
   A hotel, commercial and residential complex in Leningrad is
being planned by a group brought together by Cyrus Eaton Jr. of
Cleveland, a Canadian native who has enlisted a number of Canadian
business leaders into the project.

<TEXT>
   Western European leaders decided Saturday night to
consider financial and training measures to encourage the political
and economic changes surging through Eastern Europe.
   Leaders of the 12-nation European Community, anxious about the
fast-moving events in the Soviet bloc, met for three hours at a
hastily arranged dinner at the invitation of President Francois
Mitterrand.
   ``We declare ourselves ready to cooperate in anything that will
help the reform of the Eastern countries, which are going through a
sometimes dramatic economic crisis,'' Mitterrand told reporters at
a news conference after the end of the summit at the Elysee Palace.
   ``We are ready to contribute by all our means to the
installation of a healthy economy, which is the sine qua non
(essential condition) of the return to democracy through respect
for human rights and the organization of free and secret elections
everywhere,'' he said.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, speaking with reporters as
he left the presidential palace, said there was a ``consensus of
joy and contentment, but also a little anxiety and reserve''
regarding the changes in East Germany.
   Mitterrand said he, Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey and
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain had been mandated to carry
out three measures:
   _ Consider the creation of a banking facility for the
development and modernization of Eastern Europe.
   _ Study the possibility of a European foundation to train
management people from Eastern Europe.
   _ Open existing European Community programs involving education
and training to Eastern Europeans.
   The meeting gave the European leaders a chance to work out an
approach to the East just two weeks before President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hold a summit off Malta.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will meet with Bush
this week. West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also
will travel this week to Washington.
   The Paris meeting comes barely a week after East Germany, once
one of the most hard-line members of the Soviet bloc, lifted travel
restrictions for its citizens and began knocking holes in the
Berlin Wall amid a wave of reform.
   Since September, the bloc's first non-Communist government has
come to power in Poland, and Hungary has instituted democratic
reforms. Bulgaria's leadership has been revamped, and thousands of
people in that country and in Czechoslovakia are demanding change.
   The summit was expected to touch on the possibility of drawing
East Germany into a 24-nation aid effort spearheaded by the
community for Poland and Hungary. The EC's executive body, the
European Commission, has proposed a $650 million program of help
for the two countries.
   Mitterrand was expected to press his idea for a European
development bank that would funnel loans to East European nations.
Such a fund, patterned after the Inter-American Development Bank,
would offer loans at low interest rates to encourage economic
reforms.
   Reunification of West and East Germany is another issue that has
gained prominence with the opening of borders between the two
countries.
   It has raised concern that West Germany, the strongest economy
in the EC, will turn away from the community and toward the East.
Some worry it may no longer have as strong an interest in the
community's campaign to create a border-free market by late 1992.
   On the eve of the summit, East Berlin appealed to the European
Community for ``comprehensive cooperation'' in a variety of areas,
officials said.
   In a note to the governments of the EC _ the umbrella
organization that includes the European Economic Community trading
bloc, or Common Market _ East Germany said it wants better ties
with the West, officials said.
   It called for early negotiations on a trade and economic
cooperation agreement with the EC. The two sides held preliminary
talks early this year but only for a limited trade accord. Frans
Andriessen, the community's top trade official, was invited to East
Germany for talks.
   The community has already signed broad trade and economic
cooperation pacts with Poland and Hungary and is negotiating one
with the Soviet Union.
   The EC nations are: Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain.

   New York City Opera orchestra members, whose
eight-week strike forced the cancellation of the company's fall
season, formally approved a five-year contract Saturday.
   Members of Local 802 of the Associated Musicians of Greater New
York voted 47-16 to approve the contract, said union spokeswoman
Judy West.
   ``The major issues were the maintenance of guaranteed weeks of
work and the need for the beginning of an approach to parity with
peer opera orchestras,'' the union said in a statement. ``In this
agreement, both issues have been addressed.''
   Martin Oppenheimer, vice chairman of the City Opera, said plans
were under way for the company's spring musical.
   ``We're delighted the fight's over and the playing can begin,''
he said.
   The agreement calls for annual wage increases of about $50 a
week, ending in the fifth year with wages at $1,000 a week. Weekly
wages under the expired contract were $755.
   The strike began Sept. 13, on what would have been opening night
for the City Opera's fall season of 70 performances. The tentative
agreement was announced Nov. 8.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet leader has suggested that
Czechoslovakia's chief Communist Party ideologist conduct a
``thorough analysis of the past,'' including the 1968 invasion, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   Soviet tanks led the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in
August 1968 that crushed the liberal communist government and
ousted party leader Alexander Dubcek.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo quoted Czechoslovak party
ideologist Jan Fojtik as saying he had discussed the invasion with
Vadim Medvedev, the Soviet Communist Party's leading ideologist.
The two met recently in Moscow.
   Rude Pravo reported Fojtik said, ``We have discussed the history
(of Czechoslovak-Soviet relations), including the year 1968.
   ``We have reached a fully identical conclusion that without a
thorough analysis of the past there is no way to formulate clear
intentions and objectives for the future.''
   The invasion remains as the main obstacle to national
reconciliation and to better relations with the Soviet Union.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pushing for change in
Eastern Europe, has pledged non-interference in the affairs of the
Kremlin's Warsaw Pact allies.
   All of the Warsaw Pact members except Romania joined in the 1968
invasion.
   Poland and Hungary, both with reformed Communist parties and
governments, declared this year that the invasion was not justified.
   Fojtik was quoted by Rude Pravo as saying, ``We must not avoid
any delicate issues, whether they are related to the assessment of
the past, or whether they are current problems.
   ``The Soviet comrades consistently adhere to the principle of
non-interference. They do not think it suitable to determine how
another party should evaluate a historical event.
   ``But (events of) the year 1968 do not concern only us, they
were a matter for five Warsaw Pact countries.''
   After the invasion Dubcek was replaced as Communist Party
general secretary by Gustav Husak, now president. The current party
leader, Milos Jakes, was in charge of the purges that removed
Dubcek and other liberals.
   There have been reports in Prague that the Kremlin recently sent
a directive to Czechoslovak leaders urging restructuring and
reforms.
   Some observers believe a political struggle between Jakes and
Premier Ladislav Adamec adds to the uncertainty of significant
changes.

   Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President
Dan Quayle, praised the heroism of this tornado-ravaged northern
Alabama city's residents during a visit Saturday.
   Mrs. Quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debris
left by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured at
Crestwood Hospital during her 2{-hour tour.
   The tornado left 18 people dead, hundreds injured and up to
1,000 homeless. The youngest victim, a 2{-year-old girl, died
Friday after being taken off life-support systems.
   ``The community is filled with heroes _ people who without ...
regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so that
they could survive,'' said Mrs. Quayle, who was accompanied by Gov.
Guy Hunt and U.S. Sens. Howell Heflin and Richard Shelby.
   Mrs. Quayle, who made similar visits to San Francisco after the
Oct. 17 earthquake and Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Hugo, also
praised corporations that have made donations to help Huntsville
recover.
   Federal and state officials have promised to do whatever is
necessary to help Huntsville, even if disaster relief funds are
squeezed by Hurricane Hugo and the quake.
   ``We're here to get the job done,'' Grant Peterson, associate
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Friday.
``Whatever's needed will be done.''
   President Bush declared Huntsville a disaster area, but FEMA may
have to do some financial juggling to deal with this year's rash of
natural disasters. Parts of eight states have been declared
eligible for federal relief.
   ``Any one disaster like Hugo or the earthquake in California
exceeds ... what we have in a normal year alone,'' Peterson said.
   Congress provided $1.1 billion in supplemental funds to FEMA
after Hugo devastated the Caribbean and the East Coast in
September, and $1.2 billion following the earthquake that ravaged
parts of northern California on Oct. 17.
   So far, about $1.3 billion has been allocated to disaster
victims. Peterson said he's not yet concerned about FEMA meeting
its financial obligations.
   ``I would say that to ask for any more money at this point would
be premature,'' he said.
   Peterson and his aides urged patience during the arduous task of
processing thousands of relief requests from the Huntsville area.
   ``If everything works well, in seven to 10 days we should get
the first checks out,'' Peterson said Friday. ``I'll make sure that
we expedite these requests to meet the people's needs.''
   The state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost of
providing clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims, with
the federal government pitching in the other 75 percent. Gov. Hunt
said he expected the Alabama Legislature to come up with whatever
money is needed.
   ``The state doesn't budget for disasters,'' said Danny Cooper,
Alabama's emergency management director. ``We take care of them at
the time.''
   Hunt stressed that government agencies won't be able to shoulder
the entire load. He requested donations to agencies such as the
American Red Cross, which set up a shelter for the homeless as
rescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hours
after the tornado struck.
   The tornado hit Huntsville with devastating force _ winds were
estimated at 250 mph _ and virtually no warning about 4:30 p.m.
Wednesday, leaving a 10-mile-long path of destruction.
   A shopping center and clusters of apartment buildings were
leveled. Cars were piled atop each other like the remnants of a
demolition derby.
   Cooper said 119 homes were destroyed and 125 had lesser damage.
Three churches, two schools, 35 businesses and 10 public buildings
were either destroyed or suffered heavy damage.
   Neighbors pitched in to help Debra McKay and her family pick
through the rubble of their home. The only things standing were the
walls around two bathrooms and an adjacent hallway _ the area where
Ms. McKay and her three children rode out the storm.
   ``I know the Lord spared us,'' she said. ``I woke up a different
person this morning.''
   Officials said several truckloads of food have rolled into
Huntsville but the city is running out of places to store the goods.
   ``There's a sense of thankfulness,'' Hunt said. ``It's
heartwarming to see how people have come together.''
   Huntsville is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, the
Army's Redstone Arsenal and a number of high-tech industries. Mayor
Steve Hettinger said the city would be able to withstand the
tornado's financial impact.
   ``Huntsville has a strong economy, a diverse economy,'' he said.
``That's not the source of our concern.''

   Two drug suspects wanted on federal charges were
extradited from Colombia to the United States on Saturday as part
of the South American country's continuing crackdown on its cocaine
cartels, authorities said.
   The U.S. Marshals Service took the pair into custody in Bogota
late Friday and flew them to Miami early Saturday.
   Manuel Palma, 49, a Colombian native, was named in a two-count
indictment issued in Miami in 1987 charging him with drug
trafficking and money laundering, a news release from the Marshals
Service in Washington said.
   He was expected to make an initial court appearance Monday
before a federal magistrate.
   Robert James Sokol, 29, was flown on to Greensboro, N.C., to
face a narcotics conspiracy indictment issued in 1984, the release
said. He was being held without bond in the Guilford County Jail, a
jail spokesman said.
   Fred Gregory of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in
Greensboro said Sokol will probably have a court hearing Monday or
Tuesday. Sokol was living in Greensboro when the indictment was
issued but fled the country, Gregory said in a telephone interview
from his home.
   ``I'm glad to see us get it over with,'' Gregory said. ``There's
a lot more that need to come back. Thank goodness the process is
continuing to work. It was logjammed for so long.''
   The indictments are part of a campaign started in August by the
Colombian government to attack the country's cocaine rings. The
cartels have responded with a campaign of violence that has
included widespread bombings and attacks on government officials
and journalists.
   The latest extraditions bring to eight the number of people
Colombia has turned over to the United States. None of those
extradited have been among the dozen major traffickers sought by
U.S. authorities.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's Parliament approved a
reform-minded Cabinet on Saturday as the Communist government
begged millions heading West to avoid black-market currency dealing
that further damages their economy.
   Lawmakers created a committee to study possible constitutional
changes, including stripping the Communists of their 40-year
monopoly on power. And new Communist leaders threatened to
investigate their hard-line predecessors for corruption and abuse
of power.
   About 10,000 peopled joined a pro-democracy protest in Leipzig,
where organizers said many skipped the rally to go shopping in West
Germany. Protesters demanded free elections and a genuine political
opposition force.
   Pro-democracy supporters also took to the streets in three other
cities, Plauen, Eberswalde-Finow and Suhl, the official East German
news agency ADN said late Saturday. It estimated 22,000 people took
part.
   Hundreds of thousands of other East Germans jammed trains and
highways into West Germany, creating a 19-mile backup at one
Bavarian border crossing and overwhelming public transport headed
West.
   For more than 1.6 million other East Germans, Saturday was a day
of shopping and sightseeing in West Berlin and West Germany, fueled
for many by $54 in ``welcome money'' per person from the government
in Bonn. West Berlin's shopping avenues became pedestrian malls.
   Some trains were ``recklessly stormed'' by impatient travelers
who filled the cars two or three times over capacity, the official
ADN news agency reported.
   People in West Germany greeted tourists with free lodging,
well-stocked store shelves and just plain curiosity.
   Late Saturday, West Berlin leftists scuffled with police during
a demonstration staged over the killing Friday of a woman during a
protest in the West German city of Goettingen. The woman was struck
by a car while fleeing police who had moved in to disperse the
protesters in Goettingen.
   Throngs of visiting East Germans looked on as West Berlin police
made arrests.
   In East Berlin, Premier Hans Modrow's 28-member Cabinet was
immediately sworn in after receiving approval from the 500-member
People's Chamber. The Cabinet was named as the government came
under increasing pressure to institute reforms and loosen the
Communists' grip on power.
   Eleven deputies are non-Communists, but they belong to political
parties long aligned with the ruling force. Reform groups like
Democracy Now and New Forum also are agitating for a role in
government affairs.
   At a news conference attended by several new Cabinet members and
other government officials, Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer said:
``I see concern abroad about a possible instability occuring in
this country.'' Fischer added that the other European countries are
not interested in seeing any such political ``shock'' on the
continent.
   The foreign minister also expressed interest in better ties to
the European Economic Community.
   Also at the news conference, Finance Minister Uta Nickel
appealed for patriotism in refraining from currency speculation.
   Illegal trading of non-convertible East German marks has become
rampant over the past week as East Germans visiting the West trade
money for 20 times less than the official rate set by East Berlin.
   ``Immediate measures are needed to protect the currency,'' Mrs.
Nickel said. ``We appeal from our hearts for an end to money
speculations.'' She did not specify what actions were needed.
   East German border guards were quoted by ADN as saying they
confiscated as much as 9,000 marks _ about $4,900 at the official
rate _ from tourists headed West. East Germans are forbidden from
leaving with more than 300 marks.
   Modrow has called for economic reforms but ruled out the idea of
a free-market economy.
   The East German Parliament formed a committee to investigate
cases of corruption, personal enrichment and abuse of power.
   Communist Party chief Egon Krenz was quoted as strongly
indicating the panel would investigate the activities of his
predecessor and mentor, Erich Honecker, as well as other top
leaders of the hard-line regime ousted over the past month. Krenz
replaced Honecker on Oct. 18.
   ``The responsibility of former General Secretary Honecker and
former Politburo members Guenter Mittag and Joachim Hermann are
names that have been concretely identified. We are not covering
up,'' Krenz was quoted as saying by the Hamburg-based Bild am
Sonntag newspaper.
   East German authorities have issued more than 10 million exit
visas, ADN said. That means more than 60 percent of the population
has obtained authorization to visit the West.
   The agency said 10.1 million visas have been issued since Nov.
9, when travel restrictions were lifted on East Germany's 16.5
million people. About 200,000 East Germans have moved to West
Germany and West Berlin this year.

   Children sobbed and clutched their parents
Saturday at services for two 8-year-olds killed when a tornado
smashed a wall in their elementary school's cafeteria.
   ``Everybody's heart is heavy,'' Alice Marinelli, great aunt of
Larae Litchhult, said at the girl's private funeral.
   At a funeral home in nearby New Windsor, the Rev. Ted Bechtel
urged relatives and friends of Peter Orsino to ``not grieve as
those who have no hope.''
   Larae and Peter were among seven school children killed Thursday
when the wall blew in at the East Coldenham Elementary School
shortly after noon, showering cinder blocks and glass on lunching
first-, second- and third-graders.
   Services for the other five tornado victims were scheduled for
Monday.
   ``Everybody is very sad. She was a sweet little girl,'' said Ed
Batdorf, a friend of the Litchhult family who was among the 50
mourners attending her private funeral.
   ``Right now she's not suffering,'' Batdorf continued. ``She's in
Jehovah's memory and we look forward to seeing her again.''
   Marinelli said the Litchhult family's loss is being shared by
people throughout the area.
   ``It's certainly a community that has come together in sorrow,''
she said.
   Mourners filled every room of the Coloni Funeral Home for Peter
Orsino's service, and sobbing children held tight to their parents.
   ``A young boy with so much promise is gone from us,'' Bechtel
said. ``The pain doesn't go away tomorrow or next week. But it is
in our sorrow and grief, our anger and our frustration, that we
need to find a way to help us live our todays and our tomorrows
also.
   ``... We will have to build our lives again out of the ashes
that now fill our hearts,'' the minister said.
   While the services took place, officials of the State Emergency
Management Office met with Newburgh officials to assess the damage
to the school. Engineers began examining the wall but have not
determined if structural problems contributed to the collapse, said
Tony Germano, deputy director of the state office.
   ``It's difficult to say,'' he said. ``It's a terrible
situation.''
   At the site itself, a trio of 12-year-olds from a nearby middle
school slipped past police and caught an up-close glimpse of the
destruction. Wide-eyed and out of breath, they told of seeing
spilled milk and food amid the rubble.
   ``Two lunch boxes were still sitting on a table,'' one of them
kept repeating.
   Bob Hayes, vice president of the Coldenham Fire Department in
Newburgh, 60 miles north of New York City, said many of his men
felt they didn't do enough for the young victims.
   ``That first day and even into yesterday things were pretty
tough around here,'' Hayes said. ``We had a lot of people taking it
pretty hard.''
   Thirteen of the 18 students injured remained hospitalized
Saturday. Two were listed in critical condition. The condition of a
third child, who'd been listed as critical Thursday, was upgraded
to fair Saturday.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney general on
Saturday accused some Roman Catholic bishops of fomenting violence
in El Salvador's civil war and urged Pope John Paul II to withdraw
them from the country.
   In a letter to the pontiff, Attorney General Mauricio Eduardo
Colorado said the bishops should be withdrawn for their own good.
The letter was released the same day as followers buried six Jesuit
priests who were slain in their home Thursday _ the most
politically explosive slayings since Archbishop Oscar Romero was
assassinated in March 1980.
   Colorado accused ``certain bishops'' of fomenting the violence
that culminated in the biggest leftist guerrilla offensive of the
10-year-old war. Fighting has raged in San Salvador and throughout
the country since it was launched a week ago.
   Colorado did not mention any bishops by name, but it was
believed that among those he referred to were Monsignor Arturo
Rivera Damas, the archbishop of San Salvador, and his auxiliary
archbishop, Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez.
   Both are identified with human rights causes and have urged the
government to negotiate with the rebel Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front to end the war.
   Rivera Damas was appointed archbishop after Romero was slain by
a sniper. Right-wing death squads were blamed for his murder.
   El Salvador's rightist government censured news of the letter
within the country. A copy of the letter was provided to The
Associated Press.
   There was no immediate reaction from Catholic leaders here or
from the Vatican. The pope on Friday decried the killings of the
six priests.
   Those murders were denounced in the U.S. Congress, where some
members threatened to cut aid to El Salvador if the government does
not bring the killers to justice. Washington has provided $3.5
billion in aid over the past decade to successive Salvadoran
governments.
   In his letter, Colorado said certain bishops who have
``persisted in keeping alive the questionable ideology of the
`church of the poor''' are considered responsible for ``much of the
violence that has devastated El Salvador for many years and
culminated in the rebel actions of this week.''
   He said he would investigate the murders of the priests but
added, ``rather than investigating things which have already
happened, it is a thousand times healthier to avoid them.''
   Colorado wrote the letter to the pope on official stationary but
said he was acting as a Catholic and not a government official.
   ``I want to suggest to the dear Father, for the security and
safety and well-being of all the Salvadoran faithful, the
withdrawal, at least temporarily, from Salvadoran territory of
these bishops,'' he said.
   Rebel gunners on Saturday shot down a U.S.-supplied A-37 jet
fighter-bomber in the eastern province of San Miguel, according to
witnesses and airport officials.
   Peter Collins of ABC News was in San Miguel and said he and his
crew saw the plane stuck by two projectiles, apparently from a
50-caliber machine gun fired by guerrillas.
   Collins did not see the plane crash, but the air traffic
controller at the San Miguel airport told two other reporters that
the pilot ejected and the A-37 crashed.
   The rebels, on their clandestine Radio Venceremos, claimed they
had downed the A-37. The armed forces press committee denied a
plane had been shot down. The military said Saturday that 784
guerrillas have been killed, 527 wounded 129 captured in the
offensive. It said 208 soldiers have been killed and 627 wounded
but gave no report on civilian deaths.
   Fighting slackened Saturday, and thousands of hungry, exhausted
residents took advantage of the lull to evacuate their homes,
carrying small children and packages of belongings.
   Some refugees crossed into government-controlled territory at a
checkpoint near the northern San Salvador suburb of Mejicanos.
   Fighting continued only 800 yards away and flared occasionally
along the northern and eastern edges of the capital, where the
rebels held their positions.
   Earlier Saturday, hundreds of mourners filed past the caskets of
the six priests and their two housekeepers who were killed in their
residence at Jose Simeon Canas Central American University.
   The Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, head of the Society of Jesus in
Central America, said they will be buried in the university chapel
``because that was their wish.''
   ``They wanted to live and die here. They wanted to die as the
leading defenders of justice here did, like Monsignor Romero,''
Tojeira said.
   Students, fellow religious workers, doctors and other
professionals, and members of the faculty staff filed past the
closed, gray caskets, which each with a lilac flower on top.
   Among the dead were Ignacio Ellacuria, the univerisity's rector
and one of Central America's leading educators, and Ignacio
Martin-Baro, one of the region's leading polling experts. The
brains of the victims were cut out in a sign of contempt.
   University officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniforms
enter the slain priests' residence just before shooting began
Thursday. However, the government denied responsibility and said it
would investigate.
   The nation's most prominint leftist politician, Guillermo Ungo,
left the country for Panama Saturday after spending a week in the
Venezuelan Embassy.
   Other leftist politicians, union activists and intellectuals
were in hiding, fearing that the killings of the Jesuits were the
beginning of another wave of death squad killings.

<HEAD>Implementation Talks Break Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nynex Corp. and union negotiators broke off
talks on implementing a tentative contract agreement, dashing hopes
for an end to a 3-month strike at New York Telephone Co., both
sides said Saturday.
   Officials had hoped to settle local issues by midnight Friday so
that striking workers at Nynex's two subsidiaries, New York
Telephone and New England Telephone Co., could return to work
Monday. The tentative contract agreement was reached last Monday.
   No new sessions were planned for Nynex, New York Telephone and
the 40,000-member Communications Workers of America after talks
broke down late Friday in the New York City suburb of Rye Brook,
officials said.
   In Boston, however, the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers and New England Telephone did come to an agreement on local
issues Friday night.
   The 20,000 IBEW members were to vote Sunday on the pact and,
assuming it passes, could be back on the job Monday, said Adele
Stacy, business agent for IBEW local 2222 in Boston.
   Nynex accused the CWA of reneging on agreements reached earlier
in the week, particularly the question of arbitration for 150
workers who were disciplined during the strike.
   ``They started monkeying around with amnesty for disciplined
employees,'' Nynex spokesman Robert O'Brien said. ``In a nutshell,
we told them to take a hike. There's no way we're going to give on
that one.''
   O'Brien said 82 workers were suspended for offenses like
harassing non-striking employees and destroying management
employees' property, and about 50 were dismissed for assaulting
non-striking employees.
   Bob Master, a CWA spokesman, denied the union had reneged on
agreements. He said the CWA was willing to submit those cases for
arbitration but wanted assurances on who would review the cases,
when they would be submitted and under what circumstances.
   Master said the union also was fighting company demands that
included longer workweeks for certain classes of workers with no
increase in pay and extension of the right to hire temporary
workers.
   The strike, which began Aug. 6, has delayed directory
assistance, repairs and installation for Nynex's 10.5 million
customers in New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Maine and two cities in Connecticut.
   The dispute is the last of a series of strikes by 200,000
workers in 20 states against Baby Bell regional phone companies.

<TEXT>
   Iraq on Saturday rejected an Iranian
proposal to exchange prisoners of war if the Iraqis withdrew from
territories taken during the Persian Gulf war.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told a news conference that Iraq
will not accept any compromise short of redrawing the border to
include the strategic Shatt-al-Arab waterway in Iraqi territory.
   Aziz spoke a day after U.N. envoy Jan Eliasson left Tehran for
New York, ending a 17-day peace mission in the region.
   Eliasson acknowledged that his bid to break the deadlock in
peace talks has failed but said Aziz and his Iranian counterpart,
Ali Akbar Velayati, would meet separately in New York in
mid-December with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Aziz told the news conference: ``We consider the Shatt as pure
Iraqi territory. When Iran recognizes our sovereignty over the
Shatt, we will be ready to withdraw our forces'' from Iranian
territory.
   The United Nations estimates the Iranian territory Iraq occupies
at 385 square miles, although Tehran claims the area is double that.
   The cease-fire began Aug. 20, 1988, but the talks on a final end
to the 8-year-old war have deadlocked.
   Iran has pushed for implementing the U.N. cease-fire resolution
point by point. Iraq insisted on settling first the issue of
sovereignty over Shatt-al-Arab.
   The resolution makes no reference to Shatt-Al-Arab. In addition
to the cessation of hostilities, it calls for troop withdrawals to
the internationally recognized pre-war border, the exchange of POWs
and settlement of the border dispute through negotiations.
   The channel is Iraq's sole outlet to the gulf. Before the war,
the border ran midstream down Shatt-al-Arab under a 1975 agreement.
   Aziz called the latest Iranian proposal tantamount to
``blackmail.''
   ``The Iranians are using a humanitarian issue as a brgaining
chip,'' he said of the POWs.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross has registered
almost 50,000 prisoners held by Iran, and about 19,000 held by
Iraq. But U.N. estimates place the number of POWs at more than
100,000.

   Well wishers lavished praise, gifts and good will
on Lech Walesa on Saturday as he toured the nation's biggest
Polish-American community in search of financial support for his
country.
   Thousands of bundled-up spectators gathered in freezing
temperatures at Daley Plaza downtown for an afternoon rally in
honor of the labor leader and Nobel laureate.
   ``I have to apologize for the colds you will get tomorrow,''
Walesa told the cheering crowd during his half-hour speech. ``But
you have to understand; we haven't been able to talk like this for
45 years.''
   Walesa urged the crowd, which the mayor's office estimated at
20,000, to support democratic reform in Poland with dollars as well
as good wishes.
   ``We have to change nearly everything in Poland,'' he said. ``We
have to pass from a totalitarian system to democracy.''
   Mietek Goral, who like many at the rally is of Polish descent,
said he believed Walesa's visit would convince U.S. enterprises to
help Poland with investment.
   ``The businessmen believe what he tells them,'' Goral said.
   Walesa appealed for private investment in is country during
earlier meetings with political, business and union officials, even
while stressing that he is at heart a laborer.
   ``Thank you brother unionists,'' Walesa told members of
Chicago's AFL-CIO at a morning meeting. ``It's due to your union
that I am here.''
   The AFL-CIO provided about $5 million worth of communications
equipment and other supplies during Solidarity's underground days,
dating back to 1981.
   Walesa told the union leaders he hoped he would be able to offer
U.S. unions similar help some day, and urged laborers to join a
union.
   Like a visiting head of state, Walesa was whisked through the
city in a motorcade, with excited crowds waiting to catch a glimpse
of him at every stop.
   Walesa, often wearing a bemused expression at the enthusiasm of
the response, worked his way through crowds of admirers, shaking
hands and posing for photographs.
   He was honored everywhere he went with gifts, including a
Chicago Bears football helmet. ``My head is too big,'' he said as
he received the helmet.
   He also received a membership in Local 134 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   ``I'm very happy, but I want to pay my union dues,'' Walesa said
with a grin as he accepted his membership card and a windbreaker
from the union.
   A union reception of another kind was waiting for Walesa at a
downtown hotel where he appeared for a luncheon. Several hundred
members of the city's police union _ without a contract since Jan.
1 _ formed an informational picket. But Walesa was ushered in a
side door and did not come into contact with the pickets.
   The stop in Chicago, which with 800,000 Polish-Americans boasts
the largest population of Polish descent outside of Warsaw, was the
latest leg of a trip to encourage U.S. financial support for
Poland's Solidarity-led coalition government.
   At an earlier meeting with officials of the Polish American
Congress, Walesa said he is not seeking direct financial aid from
U.S. politicians or businessmen, emphasizing that Poland wants to
concentrate on joint ventures.
   ``I appeal to you as teachers, to help us to step onto the right
path of development,'' Walesa said. ``We want to learn from you how
to develop a country, how to move it from a system that failed to
one that works.''
   Robert A. Bowman, treasurer of Michigan, announced in a morning
meeting in Chicago that his state would purchase $10 million in
bonds issued by the Polish government.
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson said he supported a plan for his
state to buy $25 million in bonds, but said it first needed
legislative approval.
   Walesa made a stop Saturday evening at the Copernicus Center, a
Polish cultural center. He praised the efforts of the
Polish-American Economic Forum, which was formed this fall to
organize Polish-Americans who want to invest in Poland and to
advise U.S. industry how to do so, said member Marek Stopinski.
   After visiting the cultural center, Walesa left for
Philadelphia. He is scheduled to go to South America on Monday.
   Since his arrival in the United States last Monday, Walesa has
met with President Bush, made a speech before a joint session of
Congress, and visited New York.

   Western European leaders said Saturday they would
``do every single thing'' to promote the surge for democracy in
Eastern Europe and promised more aid to help Poland and Hungary get
through the winter.
   Leaders of the 12-nation European Community met for three hours
in a special session called by French President Francois Mitterrand
to discuss the upheavals throughout Eastern Europe.
   ``We wish to do everything we can to encourage reforms and the
process of democracy throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe,'' said British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. ``We're
very pleased these events have happened.''
   The dinner-meeting came two weeks before President Bush and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev are to hold a shipboard summit
off the coast of Malta.
   Mitterrand had called the Paris summit last week in a move to
have the Western Europeans establish their approach to the
developments in Eastern Europe before the Bush-Gorbachev talks. But
Mitterrand said he didn't intend to send a formal message to either
superpower leader, although he would talk to Bush by phone before
the Malta conference.
   Mrs. Thatcher will meet with Bush Friday at Camp David, and
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is scheduled to
visit Washington this week. Mitterrand said he expected to meet
with Bush next month but he didn't say when.
   Mitterrand told a news conference after the summit in the Elysee
Palace, ``We declare ourselves ready to cooperate in anything that
will help the reform of the Eastern countries.''
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said there was a ``consensus
of joy and contentment but also a little anxiety and reserve''
regarding East Germany.
   With the opening of borders between East and West Germany there
has been speculation the two countries might reunite. That has
caused some concern that West Germany, with the most powerful
economy in the European Community (EC) trading bloc, might turn
toward Eastern Europe.
   But Kohl said, ``There is no alternative'' to membership in the
EC, also known as the European Common Market.
   Mrs. Thatcher, without referring directly to Germany, said,
``The question of borders is not on the agenda. They should stay as
they are.''
   She also said security matters should continue to be conducted
through the two military alliances _ the West's North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``At a time of great change, it's necessary to keep the
background of stability and security,'' she told the news
conference.
   The leaders emphasized their commitment to support the
democratic reforms in Eastern Europe.
   ``We must do every single thing we can to encourage it,'' said
Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``We are ready to contribute by all our means to the
installation of a healthy economy, which is the sine qua non
(essential condition) of the return to democracy,'' Mitterrand said.
   Mitterrrand, Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey and Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain were named to study a proposal
for a European development bank to help modernize the backward
economies of Eastern Europe. They also were asked to look into
setting up a European foundation to train managers from Eastern
Europe and to open up EC community education and training programs
to Eastern Europeans.
   The focus of the summit's economic attentions was on Poland and
Hungary, already the recipients of a 24-nation aid program
spearheaded by the European Community. East Germany, which had
appealed to the Western leaders for closer ties, apparently did not
receive as much attention.
   On the eve of the summit, East Berlin appealed to the European
Community for ``comprehensive cooperation'' in a variety of areas,
officials said.
   The Western leaders said they would increase aid to Poland and
Hungary until the two countries work out financial packages with
the International Monetary Fund, possibly by the end of the year.
   ``We feel we must give more aid. They have to get through the
winter,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.
   The EC nations are: Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain.

   A conservative took a berth Saturday in
a two-man presidential runoff but only about 300,000 of the 74.4
million votes counted so far separated two leftists vying for the
second spot, according to official returns.
   With 91.5 of the votes tabulated, Fernando Collor de Mello, of
the center-right National Reconstruction Party, had virtually
guaranteed first place with 24 percent of Wednesday's balloting,
the first free presidential vote since 1960.
   Labor Party candidate Leonel Brizola was running second with
about 10.9 million votes, or 14.6 percent, trailed by Marxist Luis
Inacio Lula da Silva with 10.6 million, or 14.3 percent.
   The top two finishers will compete in the runoff Dec. 17.
   Da Silva, of the radical-left Workers' Party, had led Brizola by
3 percentage points in official tallies until Saturday morning. But
the Superior Electoral Court said Brizola moved past da Silva after
returns came in from the heavily populated states of Rio Grande do
Sul and Rio de Janeiro, Brizola strongolds.
   Da Silva and Brizola have pledged to forget their personal
rivalry that marked the campaign and support the winner of their
battle for second.

   The B-2 Stealth bomber
completed its seventh test flight Saturday, including an in-flight
shutdown and startup of its four engines, the Air Force said.
   The bomber took off from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave
desert at 7:14 a.m. and returned at 2:31 p.m. The 7-hour, 17-minute
flight included two aerial refuelings.
   Each of the aircraft's four General Electric F118 engines were
deliberately stopped, then restarted about midway through the
flight, the Air Force said.
   The bomber's crew also conducted normal and alternate landing
gear extensions.
   Air Force test pilot Lt. Col. John Small and Northrop Corp.
chief test pilot Bruce J. Hinds were in the cockpit of the advanced
technology bomber.
   The bomber was designed to reduce radar detection through the
use of composite materials and countoured surfaces, which absorb
radar signals instead of reflecting the signals.
   The strategic bomber made its first flight July 17.
   The B-2, which is capable of delivering nuclear and conventional
weapons, is intended to replace the nation's aging B-52 strategic
bomber fleet.
   With an estimated price $530 million per airplane, the B-2 is
considered the world's most expensive aircraft.

<HEAD>Southerners Vote on Autonomy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in 13 southern provinces
decided Sunday whether to join a regional autonomous government
designed to satisfy Moslem demands for self-rule.
   The military maintained a full alert on southern Mindanao island
but reported no violence in the first hour after polls opened at 7
a.m.
   Polls close at 3 p.m., but results for the entire region is not
expected for several days.
   President Corazon Aquino offered regional autonomy to placate
demands for self-rule by an estimated 4 million Moslems. Moslems
who have waged a nearly 20-year-old insurgency have rejected the
plan as inadequate.
   The armed forces chief of staff, Gen. Renato De Villa, said
Saturday that 50,000 troops and police have deputized by elections
commission to ensure a ``fair and honest'' plebiscite.
   Elections officials reported a moderate early turnout in this
southern port city, 540 miles south of Manila.
   Ustadz Zain Jali, a spokesman for the successionist Moro
National Liberation Front, said there was a very small turnout in
predominantly Moslem villages near the city.
   On Saturday, gunmen killed a Moslem militiaman and four of his
relatives, and bombs exploded in two provinces, police said. A
13-year-old boy was injured in one of the explosions.
   Col. Jesus Almadin, police area commander, said the killings
took place shortly after midnight in a village on the outskirts of
Zamboanga.
   In Lanao del Sur province, a bomb exploded in the provincial
capital building in the city of Marawi, destroying election
materials, police said. There were no reports of casualties, police
said.
   Many Christian voters are expected to reject the autonomy plan,
and Moslems form a majority in only five impoverished and
geographically separated provinces. Only 28 percent of the 3.9
million registered voters are Moslem, election records show.
   Mrs. Aquino forged a cease-fire with the Moslem rebels in 1986.
Peace talks collapsed in May 1987, but the cease-fire generally has
held.
   Before the Moslem rebellion peaked in the mid-1970s, an
estimated 50,000 people were killed and thousands more fled to the
nearby Malaysian state of Sabah.

<HEAD>Airman Buried Two Decades After Crashing in Vietnam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Air Force flier shot down over Vietnam
more than 20 years ago was buried with full military honors
Saturday in his hometown, and hundreds of residents turned out to
honor him.
   An estimated 500 people, many holding small American flags,
lined Dogwood Street as the funeral procession for Maj. Larry E.
Martin passed by.
   The mile-long procession, led by members of veterans groups on
foot and motorcycle, ended at Highland Cemetary.
   ``You want to see the man come home,'' said Frosty Sheridan, who
like Martin belonged to the 44th Tactical Fighter Squadron.
   Martin, 28, was the co-pilot of an Air Force fighter jet when it
was shot down on July 15, 1968. The pilot, Gobel James, ejected and
was captured. He was released, but never knew what happened to
Martin.
   In 1974, the Air Force declared Martin dead. Last July, his body
was one of three of U.S. servicemen returned to the United States
by the Vietnamese government. The body was positively identified in
October.
   Mourners packed a United Methodist Church in this northeast
Kansas town of about 800 people for Saturday's funeral service. The
Rev. Edward Bateman, an Air Force chaplain, presided.
   An American flag covered Martin's casket. His photo and several
medals were placed just behind it.
   ``We never did give up hope,'' said Martin's brother, James.
``We always thought he was just a prisoner, that he would just come
home.''
   Martin said the return of his brother's body ``removes the
doubt. The knowing is always better than the wondering.''
   ``I feel very good about Larry being home today,'' Sheridan
said. ``It kind of settles part of my life, too.''
   At the cemetery, an Air Force detachment fired a 21-gun salute
and ``Taps'' was played.
   Air Force Maj. Mike Halloran presented the flag from Martin's
casket to the flier's mother, Ruth.
   ``It's another sad chapter put to rest,'' Halloran said.

<HEAD>Northeast Utilities Picked To Take Over Public Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOINA CHIACU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders and creditors of Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire endorsed a takeover by a Connecticut
utility Saturday that would bring the operator of the Seabrook
nuclear power plant out of bankruptcy.
   Gov. Judd Gregg announced the tentative agreement Saturday
evening about 90 minutes after a 5 p.m. deadline he and legislative
leaders had set.
   The agreement includes rate increases of 5.5 percent a year for
the next seven years, Gregg said. It also guarantees the state a
supply of energy whether or not Seabrook operates, he said.
   ``Those were the conditions we set out to meet,'' he said.
   Other details of the agreement were not disclosed.
   The takeover offer from Northeast Utilities won over two other
reorganization proposals: one from Public Service itself, and the
other from United Illuminating, another Connecticut utility that
sought to merge with Public Service.
   ``Northeast came up with a proposal that was sufficiently
attractive to us to be fair,'' said Geoffrey Kalmus, a lawyer
representing Public Service's unsecured creditors, who had
supported United Illuminating's plan earlier.
   Wilbur Ross, who represents Public Service shareholders, said
the agreement would give shareholders options to buy about 8
million shares of Northeast stock, which would make them the
largest single block of stockholders.
   Northeast is the largest electric utility in New England.
   Public Service, New Hampshire's largest utility with almost
400,000 customers, is the main owner of the long-delayed $6.3
billion Seabrook plant. The financial burden of its 36 percent
stake forced the company to file for bankruptcy protection in
January 1988.
   The tentative agreement is to be presented to federal bankruptcy
Judge James Yacos on Monday.
   Shareholders and creditors of Public Service must take a formal
vote on the agreement, and Yacos must hold confirmation hearings on
it.
   Jay Nolan, lawyer for Northeast, said the utility hopes to
complete bankruptcy proceedings by July 1.
   The agreement also depends on the state Legislature repealing a
ban on charging ratepayers for Seabrook before it operates
commercially. The Legislature must act before Jan. 1, when the
first rate hike would take effect.
   Seabrook was completed in 1986, but has yet to get an operating
license. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Thursday that it
would decide all issues regarding the plant, including the adequacy
of emergency evacuation plans. Seabrook opponents have cited
emergency preparedness in trying to block the plant.
   Plant spokesman Rob Williams said operators hope to get the
license around the end of the year.

<HEAD>Report: Cost Overruns Threaten Project, Location</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Design modifications sought for the
superconducting supercollider project could add at least $1 billion
to its $6 billion pricetag or cause it to be moved from its Texas
location, The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions.
   The Post, quoting unnamed U.S. officials and independent
scientists, said Department of Energy officials are determined to
build the project ``to cost'' because of federal budget constraints.
   But such a decision, if carried out, could result in a smaller,
less powerful collider that would be unsuitable for its chosen site
of Waxahachie, a remote Texas town south of Dallas, the newspaper
said.
   Congress recently approved the first $225 million to build the
collider over an eight-year period. The Texas site was chosen after
fierce rivalry among states for the project and the accompanying
jobs and dollars. It quoted officials who said extensive
modifications could renew the battle by states who would argue they
have more suitable sites.
   The huge project, with a 50-mile underground tunnel, would study
the basic makeup of matter by forcing bunches of protons into
high-speed, head-on collisions. Detectors record the particles
produced by the energy of the collision.
   As planned, the device would be 10 times as large as the largest
comparable project in the United States and three times as large as
its largest European counterpart.
   Roy Schwitters, director of the Dallas laboratory created to
supervise construction, privately asked for an extra $1 billion for
the project to make modifications, according to the Post.
   Schwitters said his changes were ``not due to flaws ... but to
advances in the state-of-the-art technology.'' Without the changes,
he said, equipment will have to be added later at an additional
cost.
   The newspaper quoted sources who said Robert O. Hunter Jr., a
former director of energy research who the Post said was forced to
resign from the project, projected the cost of modifications at $2
billion to $4 billion.
   The newspaper said some Energy Department officials expressed
skepticism about holding down the costs of important magnets used
in the project and said a sought-after proton beam ``injector''
could bring construction delays, adding to costs.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated more than a year ago
the project would cost $1.5 billion more than the Energy
Department's estimate at the time.
   Schwitters and Deputy Energy Secretary Henson W. Moore told the
Post a study due to be completed in December should give more
reliable information.
   Moore said project managers were told, ``Either we're going to
build it for the figure of 5.9 (million dollars) ... or we're not
going to build it at all.''

   Demonstrators demanding an end to
Communist Party domination lit candles and placed flowers on
bloodstained sidewalks Saturday where police attacked protesters in
the largest such rally in 20 years.
   Six theaters canceled shows Saturday night as actors and
students called for strikes to protest police brutality at Friday
night's demonstration, in which white-helmeted policemen clubbed
hundreds of peaceful protesters.
   Tens of thousands of students marched Friday for five hours to
commemorate student Jan Opletal, killed by Nazis 50 years ago. When
demonstrators tried to reach central Wenceslas Square, police
attacked them with tear gas, dogs and clubs.
   One student was fatally beaten near the square, according to The
Washington Post. It quoted witnesses as saying Martin Smid died
after being clubbed by two riot policemen. His friends said Smid
fell to the ground after being struck several times on the head and
shoulders and police kept on beating him, the newspaper said Sunday.
   It said Smid's parents were informed of their son's death
Saturday by two policemen who told them it was ``an accident.''
   The human rights group Charter 77 likened the police crackdown
to Nazi reprisals during World War II.
   Seventeen demonstrators and seven policemen were officially
listed as injured, although official media failed to report any
injuries suffered by demonstrators.
   The state news agency CTK quoted the Interior Ministry as saying
that 143 people were taken to police stations. Nine were detained
on criminal charges and 70 on misdemeanor charges. Twenty-one
people were fined.
   Alexander Dubcek, the Communist leader of the ``Prague Spring''
reforms in 1968, was detained during the march and released after
three hours, witnesses said.
   Observers estimated the size of the crowd at 30,000 people. It
was the largest demonstration since August 1969, when crowds
gathered in downtown Prague a year after a Soviet-led invasion
crushed Dubcek's reforms.
   About 1,000 people gathered on Wenceslas Square on Saturday
afternoon and walked to Narodni Street, where the protesters were
beaten the day before.
   In the street, they lit candles and placed them and some flowers
on the sidewalk where bloodstains could still be seen.
   Journalism students and Martin Mejstrika, a student from Damu, a
higher school of acting, denounced police brutality and demanded
strikes of students and actors in theaters.
   At the end of their speeches, they urged a general strike on
Nov. 27 between noon and 2 p.m.
   ``We all feel that something must be changed,'' said Petr Placak
of the independent activist youth group Children of Bohemia. ``It
will cost us something, but we must fight for it every day.''
   At least six theaters reported that shows were canceled Saturday
night, the first day of a planned one-week strike.
   ``None of the theaters are playing tonight and in every one of
them, the resolution will be read,'' a theater director said.
   At Saturday's rally, there were chants of ``We don't want
massacres!'' ``Let's stop bloodshed!'' and ``An end to one-party
rule.''
   On Wenceslas Square, two or three police cars patrolled the area.
   As the demonstrators marched toward Narodni Street, they chanted
such slogans as ``You were lying again!'' ``Freedom for political
prisoners!'' and ``Long Live Havel!'' a reference to playwright
Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's best-known dissident.
   After about a half-hour on Narodni Street, police emerged on
both sides, detained one person and told the others to disperse.
Other policemen sealed off the square.
   In a statement and in resolutions, the Charter 77 human rights
group urged ``the immediate departure of those in the party and
state leadership who are responsible for the brutal actions against
citizens'' on Friday.
   ``The brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators reminds several
participants of the Nazi reprisals 50 years ago,'' Charter 77 said.
   ``We call on the public and on political personalities all over
the world to bring pressure to bear on the current Czechoslovak
leadership'' to open a dialogue with people outside the Communist
Party.
   Czechoslovakia's hard-line leaders, installed after the 1969
invasion, have resisted most of the Soviet-inspired reforms
sweeping Communist neighbors in Eastern Europe.
   In a surprise move, however, they granted Havel an exit visa
Friday so he can travel to Stockholm this week and receive a human
rights award. Swedish officials had planned to come to Prague to
give Havel the prize because they did not expect Havel would be
allowed to leave the country.

<TEXT>
   Norma Terris, who rocketed to stardom in the
original production of the musical ``Show Boat,'' has died after a
brief illness. She was 87.
   Miss Terris died Wednesday at her summer home in Lyme, Conn. She
also had a home in Palm Beach, Fla.
   The Columbus, Kan., native won critical acclaim for her
performance as Magnolia in the Florenz Ziegfeld production of
``Show Boat,'' which was written by Jerome Kern and Oscar
Hammerstein II. It opened on Broadway in 1927 and ran for 2{ years.
   Kern and Hammerstein wrote ``Why Do I Love You?'' _ one of the
show's enduring songs _ for Miss Terris during rehearsals.
   In 1932, she repeated her success in a Broadway revival of
``Show Boat.''
   Miss Terris appeared in Hollywood movies in the 1930s. During
the '30s and '40s she was a star of St. Louis' Municipal Opera
Company.
   Miss Terris was a member of the board of the Goodspeed Opera
House Foundation in Chester, Conn., for 30 years. She also sang
there occasionally.
   In 1984, Goodspeed opened the Norma Terris Theater, dedicated to
developing new musicals.
   Miss Terris established a fund to encourage performing artists
and composers, and endowed an intern program at the Goodspeed for
young people starting theatrical careers.
   A devoted animal lover, she donated 30 acres in East Haddam,
Conn., to the Humane Society for a nature center and regional
office.
   Miss Terris is survived by her husband, Albert D. Firestone.

   Twenty-six demonstrators were arrested and
several injuries were reported at a suburban clinic Saturday in the
second straight day of abortion protests in the Washington area,
police said.
   Police said 500 demonstrators on both sides of the abortion
issue smashed a pane of glass as they pressed against the doors of
the Hillview Clinic. They said scuffles broke out causing a number
of injuries.
   Horse-mounted police were brought to the scene as well as buses
to take away those arrested. Patricia Ireland of the National
Organization for Women said five women were unable to enter the
clinic for abortions.
   ``It was a standoff out there,'' said Bob Nolte, a spokesman for
Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group. ``They (pro-choice
advocates) had the back door blocked off to keep us away from it,
and we had the front entrance blocked. There was no access, front
or back.''
   The demonstration outside the nation's capital was one of
several around the country against abortion on Saturday.
   Some 2,000 anti-abortion demonstrators crowded outside the
statehouse in Indianapolis in what they called a ``Thanksgiving for
Life'' rally. A lawmaker told the group he would introduce
legislation to severely restrict access to abortion in the state.
   Eight people who tried to block an abortion clinic in Missoula,
Mont., were also arrested Saturday and charged with disorderly
conduct, police said. The Rev. Dean Jetmore, pastor of the Assembly
of God Church in Billings, Mont., said the rally of about 35
protesters was also part of the Operation Rescue movement.
   About 5,000 people marched peacefully through downtown Houston
to protest abortion.
   Prince George's County, Md., police had originally estimated
some 200 people were arrested at the Suitland protest. But they
said later Saturday 26 of the protestors were formally charged.
   Those arrested faced misdemeanor charges of blocking an
entrance, which carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a
$50 fine, or crossing a police line, which carries a $50 fine.
   Police arrested more than 700 anti-abortion protesters on Friday
for violating a District of Columbia law barring demonstrators from
gathering near abortion clinics.

   Hundreds of people protested the
showing of ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' at a downtown theater
Saturday, but they were outnumbered by those who paid to see the
movie.
   About 350 protesters gathered in front of the Capitol Plaza
Theater at noon, singing, chanting and holding signs urging a
boycott the movie at the West Virginia International Film Festival.
   It was the first showing in a commercial theater in the state,
although the film is widely available on videocasette and has been
shown on cable television.
   Festival organizers said about 470 people bought tickets and
crossed a block-long picket line without incident to see the movie.
   The showing ignited controversy for more than a week in
Charleston, similar to protests that broke out elsewhere when the
movie was first released in this country last year.
   Critics have complained about the film's depiction of Jesus as
having doubts about his divine role and about a scene in which
Christ hallucinates on the cross about having sex with Mary
Magdalene.
   ``You don't have to fall into a septic tank to know what it
is,'' said the Rev. Avis Hill, a local minister who led the
protest. He said he had watched portions of the movie on
videocassette last year, fast-forwarding during offensive scenes.
   The protests attracted some viewers, though.
   ``It just makes me want to come more,'' said Pat Cowdery of
Charleston. ``They're doing what they want to do and I'm doing what
I want to do.''
   A $10,000 grant from the state Division of Culture and History
provided about a third of the festval's funding, but no state money
was used to rent ``Last Temptation,'' festival organizers said.

   A giant spruce being cut for use as the
nation's Christmas tree fell the wrong way Saturday, narrowly
missing about 300 spectators on a road in the Kootenai National
Forest.
   The tree broke as it fell across the back of a logging truck
near this northwestern Montana town.
   A backup tree, a 41-year-old Engelmann spruce originally
selected as their first choice, was later felled for shipment to
Washington, D.C.
   House Speaker Tom Foley is expected to throw the switch to light
the tree at a ceremony in Washington on Dec. 13.
   Montana is providing the nation's Christmas tree because the
state is celebrating its centennial this year.

   The electrocution of Arthur James Julius
early Friday marked the fourth death warrant carried out in Alabama
this year, putting the state's execution rate at a level not seen
in 35 years.
   Following Julius' execution for the 1978 murder-rape of his
cousin, Prison Commissioner Morris Thigpen said the rate of
executions could increase.
   ``I think it is obvious with the number we have on death row,''
said Thigpen at a news conference following Julius' execution.
   The state now has 108 inmates under sentence of death.
   Julius, 43, dressed in a white sweatsuit and shower shoes, gave
two thumbs-up signs and waved both hands after his final words were
spoken to Holman Prison warden Charlie Jones, who read the death
warrant.
   Thigpen quoted Julius as saying ``he believed in God and knew he
would not let him suffer.''
   Julius, of Birmingham, was sentenced to death for the slaying of
his cousin, 29-year-old Susie Bell Sanders, at her Montgomery
apartment. He was on an pass from a prison work-release center at
the time. He was then serving a life term for a 1972 murder.
   Julius was the fourth inmate to die in Alabama's electric chair
this year and the 119th person put to death in the United States
since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume
use of the death penalty.
   The last time Alabama had four or more executions in one year
was 1954, when three convicted murderers and one rapist were put to
death in the electric chair at the old Kilby Prison in Montgomery.
Two of those executions were held on the same day.

   A state prison official wants to rent jail cells
in Mexico to lock up illegal aliens who are convicted in Washington
of dealing drugs.
   Joseph Lehman, deputy secretary of corrections, proposed the
idea last month in a letter to Enrique Loaeza, Mexico's consul
general in San Francisco.
   Loaeza forwarded the request to his government, which has not
replied.
   Lehman said illegal aliens from Mexico who are convicted in
Washington of drug dealing and other crimes could be jailed more
cheaply in Mexico.
   Dick Milne, Gov. Booth Gardner's press secretary, said Gardner
knows about Lehman's effort. He called it an ``interesting idea''
but would not comment further.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee approved legislation Friday
that would stop the hauling of garbage in refrigerated trucks used
to ship food, drugs and cosmetics, and the back-to-back hauling of
chemicals and foodstuffs in cargo tankers.
   The vote by the Public Works and Transportation Committee is the
second this week in the House on legislation aimed at regulating
``backhauling,'' the practice of finding cargos for return trips in
order to make efficient use of vehicles.
   A number of hearings have disclosed that eastern cities are
sending their garbage to Midwestern landfills in vehicles that
earlier brought foods east from inland producers. Hearings also
have disclosed that western wheat shipments have been contaminated
by previous shipments of pesticides and fertilizers.
   The Energy and Commerce subcommittee on transportation and
hazardous materials earlier this week approved a bill requiring
federal authorities to determine which materials may or may not be
backhauled, and establishing procedures for the proper cleaning
between shipments of allowed materials.
   That legislation has yet to go before the full committee.
   Friday's legislation, sponsored by Rep. William F. Clinger Jr.,
R-Pa., bans the consecutive shipments in the same refrigerated
truck of food and garbage. The measure also bans shipments of food
products in cargo tankers that have been used to transport
chemicals and other nonfood items.
   The Department of Transportation, under the Clinger bill, would
come up with a list of solid waste items, such as recyclable
containers or packing materials, that could be carried in trucks,
as well as food and non-food items that could be carried in food
cargo tanks.

   A group of civil rights leaders met with
President Bush on Friday to air ``honest differences'' and emerged
from the session giving the president high marks for listening.
   ``I think we all feel that we have succeeded in opening up a
dialogue on a number of issues,'' said Corretta Scott King, head of
the Martin Luther King Jr. Center.
   The widow of the slain civil rights leader said Bush was
``receptive to our ideas, even if he disagrees ... on some things,
many things perhaps.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the meeting, which
lasted about half an hour, had been requested by the Black
Leadership Forum.
   ``What we had to bring to the president represents a recognition
that it's in the best interest of the whole country as well as
African Americans that we achieve parity. We would hope for it in
the year 2000,'' said Dorothy Height of the National Council of

   ``I think the most significant thing was that he listened, that
he showed a genuine interest, that we had real dialogue,'' she
added. ``There are honest differences of opinion on a number of
things.''
   Jospeh Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
told reporters after the meeting that Bush was ``surprised to hear
that there was really overt racisim and he hoped it wasn't true.
But we gave him instances where we think it is true.''
   ``We're also concerned about covert racisim that puts this
invisible ceiling in the corporate community on where blacks can
rise to higher paying jobs,'' Lowery said.

   The cause of a late-night collision between a
Navy tanker and an 80-foot sportfishing boat carrying 43 passengers
and crew members was under investigation, officials said Friday.
   Seven fishermen were injured in the accident late Thursday
outside Los Angeles Harbor. A small amount of fuel leaked from the
538-foot tanker, which was carrying 7.8 million gallons of jet
fuel, officials said.
   The fishing vessel Shogun, a San Pedro-based charter, and the
San Francisco-bound tanker Sealift Antarctic were returned to the
Los Angeles port and the Coast Guard began an investigation.
   The 80-foot Shogun remained afloat despite its run-in with the
tanker about two miles outside the harbor, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Robert Beals.
   Lifeguards from Long Beach rescued all those aboard the charter
boat, including six crew members, and took them to shore in rescue
boats, said Chief Petty Officer Mark Kennedy.
   The four most seriously injured people were taken to St. Mary's
Hospital in Long Beach, he said. Three were treated and released
and the second mate was admitted for observation, said nursing
supervisor Todd Brabbin.
   The collision punctured the tanker's hull, producing a hole
about the size of a quarter and spilling about 1,680 gallons of
fuel, Dickerson said. The leak was quickly contained, he added.
   The Antarctica, owned by the Irving Trust Co. of New York,
operates under Navy charter to transport jet fuel, Kennedy said. It
was manned by a merchant marine crew of 24.

<HEAD>California Scientists Import Wasps to Attack Problem Flies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists on Friday released 50 parasitic
Israeli wasps, each smaller than a pinhead, hoping the pests would
zero in on Southern California's growing ash whitefly population.
   The wasps were sent to work in a suburban Encino ash tree in the
first of a series of tests to see if they can be used in the fight
against the problem flies.
   ``This particular trial is not to see if the wasps will kill all
the ash whiteflies,'' said Tom Bellows, a University of California,
Riverside, entomologist supervising the experiment. ``This
particular trial is to see if the wasps can live successfully in
our Southern California climate.''
   Bellows released the imported predators into what he calls a
``sleeve cage,'' a finely woven mesh cloth fitted over a tree
branch so that all of the wasps will remain in one place.
   Otherwise, scientists monitoring the experiment would have to
search the whole tree and beyond to find the wasps, Bellows
explained.
   The ash whitefly infestation is not the only agricultural battle
being waged in Southern California. Record numbers of exotic insect
pests have invaded Los Angeles County this year, posing a threat to
the state's $16 billion-a-year farm economy.
   Efforts to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly, which lays its
eggs in more than 250 types of fruit, has cost taxpayers at least
$10 million so far, county officials said.
   Scientists also are scrambling to deal with invasions by
Japanese beetles, Russian wheat aphids, gypsy moths, fire ants and
other bugs found in faraway lands _ but foreign to the United
States.
   ``We are convinced that it's because you are the nation's
melting pot,'' said Gera Curry, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Food and Agriculture in Sacramento.
   The region's booming immigrant population is bringing in
contraband fruits and vegetables from native lands, she said.
   The people responsible don't seem to realize their shipments of
produce also carry alien pests that thrive in Southern California's
warm climate, Curry said.
   One of the most ruinous is the ash whitefly, which sucks vital
fluids from tree leaves and deposits a sticky ooze that discolors
fruit, stains patios and ruins car paint.
   The ash whiteflies, which have no natural enemies in the United
States, were first discovered in the San Fernando Valley last
summer. They were apparently imported accidentally from Europe, the
Middle East or Africa, where they are common.
   The parasite wasps were imported from Israel, where they act as
the ash whitefly's natural enemy.
   The wasp has no sting, but kills by laying its eggs inside ash
whitefly larvae, Bellows said. After the wasps' eggs hatch, they
eat their way out of the whitefly larvae, killing the pest.
   If the series of experiments set for this month are successful,
Bellows said hundreds of thousands of insect predators will be
released next spring.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Friday it will
review a complaint that its internal disciplinary unit wrongly
described the results of a foreign counterintelligence
investigation of a former official.
   Department spokesman David Runkel said the agency will review
Roger Pilon's complaint that the Office of Professional
Responsiblility erred when it said the investigation produced
sufficient evidence to dismiss Pilon.
   Pilon says he was cleared of allegations that he gave South
Africa a classified document and was reinstated in his job at the
Justice Department.
   ``Obviously there is a difference of opinion on the facts and
that has to be looked at,'' Runkel said, adding that the matter
would be reviewed by Deputy Attorney General Donald Ayer.
   Pilon's lawyers have asked the department for a public apology
for what they called the report's ``egregiously inaccurate''
description of the investigation by the FBI and the Office of
Professional Responsiblility (OPR).
   Three House members also called on the Justice Department to
resolve the discrepancy between the Nov. 9 OPR report and the
evidence Pilon produced that he was cleared of the allegations and
reinstated with his security clearance.
   OPR's report said that while the counterintelligence
investigation ``did not develop sufficient evidence to support a
prosecution'' it ``did discover that sufficient cause existed to
terminate'' Pilon as head of the Office of Asylum Policy and Review.
   Following the report's release on Nov. 9, Pilon produced a Sept.
9, letter from a senior department official saying that he was
being reinstated to his job.
   Pilon said his security clearance was fully restored when he
returned to the department following an administrative leave.
   The report, which did not identify Pilon by name, said that he
resigned before ``the initiation of removal proceedings.''
   Pilon says he resigned only after his reinstatement, carrying
out a longterm plan to join the Cato Institute, a libertarian think
tank where he is now a fellow.
   Pilon confirms that he was the subject of an FBI
counterintelligence investigation that grew out of a background
check of his wife, Juliana, when she was considered to be an
assistant interior secretary.
   The investigation scuttled her nomination and resulted in what
Pilon calls a ``Kafkaesque nightmare.''
   Pilon denies the allegation that when he worked for the State
Department in 1987 he gave his wife a classified document on
communist influence in South Africa that was relayed to a South
African diplomat.
   In their letter to Thornburgh, the three members of the House
Judiciary Committee also asked Thornburgh in a letter to study the
case and ``if appropriate'' issue an apology.
   ``Obviously there is a discrepancy that deserves to be
resolved,'' said Reps. Don Edwards, D-Calif., Gerry Sikorski,
D-Minn., and Constance Morella, R-Md.
   ``If the facts are as the Pilons allege, then they have been
done an injustice by the inclusion of Roger's case in the OPR
report issued last week,'' the lawmakers said.

<TEXT>
   A Peruvian diplomat and a Lima businessman were
convicted Friday of smuggling $6.3 million worth of cocaine into
London in a diplomatic pouch and each was sentenced to 20 years in
prison.
   Officers testified that 42 pounds of cocaine were still in the
pouch, which was inside a suitcase, when Jose Manuel Pacheco, 45,
and Carlos Alberto Margary, 47, were arrested by customs officers
at a London hotel.
   Pacheco held the rank of minister and headed the supplies
department at the Peruvian Foreign Ministry when he was arrested
last March. Margary operated a business in Lima, the Peruvian
capital.
   Pacheco was dismissed from his post by a Peruvian tribunal and
the court was told that customs investigators received full
cooperation from Peruvian authorities.
   The cocaine arrived at London's Heathrow airport after a two-day
trip via the United States and Paris.
   It was discovered March 24 when customs officers at Heathrow
X-rayed Pacheco's two suitcases.
   Prosecutor David Calvert-Smith said: ``It became apparent to
customs officers that what they were seeing was something that did
not look very diplomatic.''
   The officers left the leather pouch inside the suitcase and the
luggage continued on to the delivery carousel where Pacheco
collected it. He took a taxi into London and met Margary at a hotel
where the two were found in possession of the cocaine,
Calvert-Smith said.
   Judge Christopher Tyrer said, ``This case is particularly
serious because it involves the deliberate and outrageous abuse of
diplomatic privileges.''
   He told Margary: ``I am compelled to the view of you as a senior
figure in the Peruvian drugs industry.''
   Turning to Pacheco, he said, ``You have had all the advantages
of intelligence and position. Instead you have betrayed yourself,
your family and friends and you have brought discredit to the name
of your country.''

   The regulator of national banks has earmarked
29 banks for increased scrutiny because of their lending for
leveraged corporate buyouts.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, who ordered his
examiners a year ago to begin paying closer attention to LBO
lending, said ``criticized highly leveraged transactions'' at the
11 biggest banks under his jurisdiction jumped from 9 percent at
the end of last year to 17 percent at midyear.
   This raises concern that as competiton among banks to make these
loans heats up, some may make riskier loans, he said in a speech
this week. ``When the marketplace is as crowded as it appears ...
(it) almost always leads to abuses.''
   Moreover, smaller regional banks with less experience in the
field are increasing their involvement, he said, adding, ``We are
concerned that banks without proper understanding of the
transactions or appropriate risk management procedures are
participating in leveraged financing.''
   The 29 banks now targeted for quarterly monitoring of their LBO
portfolios all have at least 2 percent of assets tied up in
leveraged deals. At the 11 largest the average was 4 percent.
   The 11 large banks are: Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Marine
Midland, New York; Bank of America and Wells Fargo, San Francisco;
First National Bank of Boston; Continental Illinois and First
Chicago, Chicago; NCNB, Charlotte, N.C.; Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh,
and Security Pacific, Los Angeles.
   Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office, declined
to release the names of the 18 regional banks. ``We don't want to
create undue concern.'' She emphasized Friday that being on the
list does not signify a bank is in any danger.
   In a leveraged buyout, investors _ often managers seeking to
thwart a hostile takeover _ borrow heavily against a company's
assets in order to buy it. Critics say the debt can be risky if the
company's profits slip.
   An increase in banks' caution about such deals, particularly a
proposal last month for a buyout of United Airlines' parent
company, was cited by traders as the trigger for the Oct. 13 stock
market plunge.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns Convictions of Three Involved in Soccer Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge, questioning police evidence, overturned
the convictions of three men for violence at soccer games and
reduced the prison term Friday of a fourth man.
   Judge Lord Lane ruled that handwriting experts cast doubt on the
veracity of statements made by undercover policemen.
   On Thursday, the judge overruled the convictions of Vincent
Drake, 25, who was serving a seven-year sentence, and Terry Last,
26, and Stephen Hickmott, 33, both serving 10-year sentences, on
charges of plotting to fight.
   The case involved lengthy investigations, with undercover
officers trying to get close to people suspected of organizing
violence at soccer matches. Submitted as part of the evidence were
notes the officers often scribbled hastily.
   Judge Lane said police handwriting experts found that the notes
included dates and times of statements that did not match those on
officer duty sheets, suggesting tampering. He said that was
sufficient to undermine the prosecution's credibility.
   On Friday, Lane ruled that the six-year jail term of convicted
soccer hooligan Douglas Welsh, 25, was too long. Walsh has served
two years and the judge reduced the sentence to four years. That
will enable Walsh to be freed immediately under parole provisions.
   The judge said the violence that followed the 1986 cup final at
Wembley was terrifying but a six-year sentence flouted Appeal Court
guidelines and was too long.
   Five conspiracy cases involving soccer violence have collapsed
over the last two years with charges dropped against about 120
people. Scotland Yard was expected to begin an internal
investigation after the latest rulings.
   British soccer has been plagued by spectator violence in recent
years. A total of 39 people, most of them Italian fans, died when
rioting broke out among fans at a European soccer cup final match
between the British team Liverpool and Juventus from Turin, Italy,
at Heysel Stadium in Brussels on May 29, 1985. Drunken Liverpool
fans were blamed for starting the violence.
   Violent incidents at British soccer matches this year have
included street battles in Glasgow, Scotland, between rival
Scottish and English fans in which more than 250 people were
arrested.

   The new law requires a 10-year residency in Estonia for holding
public office, but deletes a two-year residency requirement for the
right to vote, Tass said.
   It passed with 186 votes in favor, and 40 abstentions by the
``Equal Rights'' group of deputies, Tass said. It did not say if
anyone voted against the bill.
   In August, tens of thousands of Russians and other non-Estonian
residents of the Baltic republic walked off their jobs to protest
the law requiring two years' residence in Estonia to vote.
   The national Presidium called the law unconstitutional, but the
Estonian parliament, in an act of defiance, only suspended the
law's provisions for the local elections set for Dec. 10.
   The law passed Friday also requires candidates to live or work
in the district they hope to represent, a departure from current
national law. Many Soviet legislators, especially those well known,
represent districts far from their homes.

   Gunmen killed a member of the
Ulster Defense Regiment as he was driving home Friday on the
outskirts of Armagh, 35 miles southwest of Belfast, police reported.
   No individual or group asserted responsibility for killing the
57-year-old man, but police suspect guerrillas of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army fighting. Police did not release the
identification of the victim.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to unite Northern
Ireland, a British province where Protestants outnumber Catholics
3-2, with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.
   The Ulster Defense Regiment is a locally recruited unit of the
British Army.
   Belfast police headquarters said the victim had signed off from
a day's duty at Drumad Barracks in Armagh and was driving home when
gunmen in another vehicle fired at least 20 shots at his car.

   The House approved compromise legislation
Friday aimed at protecting Chinese students in the United States
from reprisals at home for their participation in the pro-democracy
movement.
   By a voice vote, the House approved a House-Senate compromise
under which the 32,000 Chinese students holding ``exchange
visitor'' visas would not have to return home for two years before
applying for a change in their immigration status.
   The restriction had been intended to prevent a ``brain drain''
from developing nations, especially since students from abroad are
funded significantly by their own government.
   The bill requires that Chinese students holding the exchange
visitor visas, also known as ``J visas,'' to apply for immigration
status within four years of the bill's enactment.
   The compromise was reached Friday afternoon. The Senate must
still approve the report.
   The Attorney General has already suspended enforcement of
departures as a result of the Chinese government's suppression of
Chinese student protesters.
   As part of the compromise, the bill would require the Justice
Department to give careful consideration to applications by Chinese
nationals who express a fear of persecution because of China's
family planning law limiting couples to one child.
   Sen. William L. Armstrong, R-Colo., had asked for a provision to
protect Chinese nationals who refuse to practice birth control or
have an abortion in order to carry out the policy.
   The provision would cover applications for asylum, for
withholding of deportation or for refugee status.

   The estimated cost of helping local
governments remove debris from Hurricane Hugo has increased by 50
percent to $90 million, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
said Friday.
   The total estimated cost of the storm to all FEMA programs has
increased to more than $437 million, of which $210 million will go
to public assistance programs, the agency said.
   In that category, FEMA has increased its estimate for debris
removal from $60 million to $90 million. In addition, estimated
assistance to public utilities has increased from $60 million to
$80 million.
   In a brief statement announcing the revised estimates, the
agency did not explain the reason for the increases.
   In addition to public assistance programs, which allocate money
to publicly owned or private non-profit organizations, the total
cost figure comprises an estimated $74 million toward individual
assistance programs such as housing repairs and medical costs; $53
million in low-interest loans; $70.9 million in mental health,
disaster unemployment and emergency food stamp costs; and $40
million to the military and other federal agencies.

   Fire crews injected water into a
300-foot-long propane pipeline Friday to extinguish a towering
day-long blaze, enabling nearly half of the town's 1,000 residents
to return to their homes.
   A smaller fire continued to burn Friday night at the Williams
Pipe Line Co. terminal, but it posed no danger and was being
allowed to burn out, company spokesman Jim Gipson said.
   ``The main fire is out and the line has been capped,'' Gipson
said.
   The fire started Thursday as a work crew was performing routine
maintenance on a pump at the plant two miles south of Jasper in
southwest Missouri, Gipson said. Flames had shot 200 feet into the
air from a 2-inch valve in the pipeline, which leads to a 17-acre
underground storage cavern.
   No one was injured and the cause remained undetermined, he said.
Five vehicles at the site were destroyed, he added.
   Pipeline fire experts from Texas and Oklahoma extinguished the
fire late Friday morning.
   Several hours later, about 500 residents who were evacuated from
a two-mile radius of the plant on Thursday were allowed to return
home. Many had stayed with friends and relatives or gone to
shelters in the nearby Lamar, Carthage and Joplin.
   A 10-mile stretch of U.S. 71 between Jasper and Carthage also
was reopened Friday afternoon, the State Highway Patrol said. The
plant lies several hundred yards from the highway.
   Flames continued to shoot from a valve on a 20,000-gallon
propane tank near the capped pipeline. The main blaze heated the
tank and popped an emergency release valve designed for that
purpose, officials said.
   Dairy farmer Randy Greene, who lives about a mile from the
plant, said he was happy to be able to return home and milk his
cows on schedule. The sky had an eerie orange glow to it when he
was allowed past barricades Thursday night to milk the herd, he
said.
   ``I was a little nervous being that close to the plant, but it
had to be done,'' he said.

   The Navy's two-day freeze on normal
operations to concentrate on safety ended Friday, with commanders
awaiting the results of the exercise triggered by an unprecedented
series of accidents.
   In one case, they didn't have to wait long. Shortly after the
operational stand-down ended, mechanical problems forced a training
jet to ditch in the Gulf of Mexico, a Navy spokesman said. The two
pilots ejected safely.
   The TA4J jet went down on a routine training mission at 3:40
p.m. about 20 miles south of Pensacola, Fla., only nine hours after
the Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas unit completed its
stand-down, said Navy spokesman Rod Duren in Pensacola.
   The pause in operations was ordered Tuesday by Navy Secretary H.
Lawrence Garrett III and Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval
operations, after 10 accidents over a three-week period killed 10
and injured at least 71.
   Under the stand-down order, all Navy units worldwide were to
halt normal routine and concentrate on safety inspections, reviews
and lectures for 48 of the ensuing 72 hours, beginning Tuesday
evening.
   Trost ordered all commanders to report their findings from the
stand-down to him.
   Navy officials said the stand-down was not ordered because the
service was operating in an unsafe manner, but because Garrett and
Trost wanted to ensure that everything that could be done was being
done to protect servicemen.
   For the Norfolk-based Atlantic Fleet, that meant the
reorganization of training and operations schedules for
approximately 200,000 people and 300 ships.
   ``Most of the ships will be finished by this evening,'' Lt.
Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a fleet spokesman, said Friday. ``Some
helicopter units on base began the stand-down Wednesday, though
most units needed Wednesday to prepare for the stand-down.''
   Line commanders said the procedures of the stand-down were no
different from their daily training regime.
   ``The only difference is that this is a dedicated period. We've
stopped our routine activities. Every individual aboard ship is
devoted to the safety stand-down,'' said Capt. Frank J. Lugo,
commander of the guided missile cruiser Josephus Daniels.
   Lugo ran his 470 crewmen through a series of lectures,
inspections and demonstrations Thursday and Friday while the
warship was docked at the Norfolk Naval Station.
   ``What you're seeing here is no different than any other day,
except we're not flying,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Chris Wuethrich,
executive officer of Squadron VF-41 at the Oceana Naval Air Station.
   Wuethrich said squadrons normally go on stand-down after the
holidays to review flight safety and past accidents.
   Navy safety officials said there was no common thread linking
the accidents, which ranged from men washed overboard to plane
crashes to ship fires to the accidental bombing of a cruiser.
   ``Never in the history of the modern Navy have so many mishaps
happened at one time,'' said Capt. Ferguson Norton, the Navy's top
safety officer.
   According to Navy figures, 1989 is the safest year on record
with 69 major accidents reported so far. In 1984, 118 major
accidents were reported. Every year since then, the numbers have
declined.
   Where 1989 varies from the previous five years is in fatalities.
There have been 102 this year, including the 47 sailors killed in
the April 19 gun turret explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa.
In 1984, 64 people were killed in accidents.

   Roman Catholic officials urged the Bush administration to press
for an investigation of the killings of six Jesuit priests in El
Salvador and to stem the flow of arms to both sides in the civil
war.
   ``We have been sickened and outraged at the murders of the six
Jesuit priests and their co-workers as well as the more than 500
deaths that have occurred in El Salvador this past week,'' said a
statement from some 600 priests of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of Los Angeles.
   ``We ask that this violence be stopped. Ten years and 80,000
deaths have proven that the military solution is no solution,'' the
group, which included several exiles from El Salvador, said in the
statement drafted late Thursday at a meeting in Palm Springs.
   Earlier Thursday, Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony called the
slayings wanton murder and asked the U.S. government to urge ``an
immediate truce, prompt negotiations between the government and the
guerrillas in El Salvador and the cessation of outside military
armaments to all sides.''
   Dozens of religious workers, labor activists, academics and
political figures went into hiding Friday in San Salvador after the
killings of the Jesuits and the arrest of 12 Lutheran missionaries.
The Lutherans, including four Americans, were released Friday
unharmed, the U.S. Embassy said.
   The slayings Thursday of Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of Jose
Simeon Canas Central American University, vice-rector Ignacio
Martin Baro, four other Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her
15-year-old daughter were blamed on right-wing forces and drew
international condemnation.
   The National Council of Churches, America's largest religious
federation, urged Congress to halt delivery of military aid to El
Salvador.
   In Washington, Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk, president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, wrote President Bush to
demand that the Salvadoran government be pressed to investigate.
   President Alfredo Cristiani, whose government denied any
responsibility, said he had ordered an inquiry.
   The slayings shocked even those accustomed to analyzing events
in the war-torn country.
   ``This was not the work of madmen. This was the work of cruel,
politically sophisticated men,'' said Richard Nuccio, author of
``Who's Wrong, Who's Right in Central America'' and an associate of
the Washington D.C.-based Inter-American Dialogue.
   Beatriz Manz, a Central American specialist at Wellesley College
in Boston, attributed the massacre to forces within Cristiani's
ruling party.
   ``It will intimidate the few voices of dissent, the few voices
of reason, in El Salvador,'' she said.
   Nuccio said ``we'll probably never know for sure'' who did the
killings, but he said they will ``make it very difficult for
Congress to give aid to El Salvador without attaching any
conditions on human rights violations.''

   A $31,000-plus pay raise for the House _ but
only $8,900 for the Senate _ is on its way to President Bush's desk
after careening through Congress in just two days.
   The Senate voted 56-43 Friday night to approve the bill, but
only after deciding at the last minute that it couldn't take the
poltical risk of the bigger House-passed pay raise. Instead,
senators would keep taking honoraria from interest groups, a
much-criticized practice eliminated by the House.
   ``We have done exactly the wrong thing tonight. We have
failed,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo.
   But the Senate didn't cut back the raise that applies to the
House, federal judges and top government executives, and the House
early today gave the measure final approval and shipped the package
to the president. The House gave its approval in a voice vote at
nearly 1:30 a.m. with whistling and cheers in the chamber.

   Negotiators from the House and Senate are

nearing agreement on a compromise deficit-reduction package.
   Final action on those two bills, which could come Sunday, would

   Senior tax-writers in both houses agreed early today to kill the
catastrophic program, which was enacted with great fanfare less

bankrupted by costs of a major illness.
   But two Republican senators who had wanted to scale back the
program said they will work to defeat the repeal agreement. Sen.

fetus becomes viable for life outside the womb, or at any time when
necessary to protect the life of the mother.

<HEAD>The Big New Consumer Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is the penny-pinching period of the
economic cycle, when consumers watch their bills, homeowners study
mortgage rates and businesses cut overhead. Even Congress tries to
trim.
   It is the mood of the times, a period of rentrenchment,
reorganization and correction that follows every economic expansion
_ a regular and maybe necessary time in which the stage is prepared
for the next act.
   And that, perhaps, is why the attempt to cut automobile
insurance costs is gaining a sort of negative attention. While
lower insurance costs obviously are desirable, the effort is being
resisted and frustrated.
   At issue is whether no-fault policies, which are said to reduce
costs, should be offered as a choice to motorists in states where
fault-based policies, which often lead to costly litigation, are
now firmly entrenched.
   Consumers groups, including many insurers, are fighting for
no-fault, or consumer-choice insurance. The opposition includes
some insurers and members of state legislatures, but the legal
fraternity makes up its stiff backbone.
   Leading the consumer effort is Project New Start, whose leaders
claim that insurance buyers finance costly litigation that could be
avoided and that benefits a few at the expense of high rates for
everyone.
   Founded by consumerists James Brown of the University of
Wisconsin and Robert J. McEwen of Boston College, Project New Start
has plenty of heavy hitters, perhaps none better known than
Virginia Knauer.
   Mrs. Knauer, White House consumer affairs adviser in the
administration of Presidents Ford, Nixon and Reagan, is the
project's national chairwoman and at a point in her life when
public-spirited citizens often feel free to speak their minds.
   She contends that there is no arguing that no-fault makes sense,
and she blames one group _ ``the lawyers who make their living by
arguing over who is at fault'' _ for preventing its enactment by
state legislatures.
   She says lawyers made it clear in Nevada, one of the recent
battlegrounds, that ``they will fight Consumer Choice auto
insurance to the death.''
   Nothing new in that, she added. ``For the past two decades they
have sabotaged or crippled most consumer efforts to enact no-fault
insurance.''
   Those are harsh words, and they suggest the bitterness of the
battle.
   The legal profession says it isn't as simple as that. Involved,
they say, are a person's right to sue and a person's right to trial
by jury. And no- fault, they say, places a premium on economic loss
but minimizes physical loss.
   Mrs. Knauer says that's nonsense. What her group offers, she
says, is called Consumer Choice because it would allow the current
system to remain side by side with another system. Motorists would
choose one or the other.
   That choice: Pay higher premiums and retain the old system and
the right to sue; or pay less and avoid suits with a Personal
Protection Policy. Stated differently, a choice between a
no-lawsuit or ``sue and be sued'' system.
   Under the Personal Protection Policy, consumers would purchase
what medical coverage is needed, coverage for loss of income, and
whatever level of coverage is desired for fire, theft or repairs to
their cars.
   From that point they could choose building blocks of whatever
insurance they desired, including loss of life and survivor
benefits.
   Says Mrs. Knauer: ``No longer would a motorist be forced to buy
an arbitrary level of insurance coverage designed to protect some
other unknown person with unknowable resources and hypothetical
needs, with whom they might someday be involved in an accident.''
   But how could two systems exist simultaneously?
   It in this area, too, that some conflict might lie. Those who
choose the current system could collect through an uninsured
motorist rider, but they would be limited in their ability to sue
those with the Personal Protection Policy.
   Only 14 states now have basic no-fault systems, nearly two
decades after Massachusetts enacted the first such law. New Start
has a long way to go, and that suggests plenty of fireworks for the
decade of the 1990s.

<HEAD>C-Span From House of Representatives to House of Commons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television's C-SPAN, which has shown live
proceedings of the U.S. House of Representatives since 1979, on
Tuesday will do likewise from a somewhat older place _ Britain's
House of Commons.
   On that day, which starts with an address by Queen Elizabeth II
to the new session of Parliament that C-SPAN will carry live at
5:30 a.m. EST, the occasionally raucous Commons will open its
proceedings to television.
   That starts at 9 a.m. EST in what is a test run. The experiment
will last until at least next July, after which the legislators in
the 650-seat Commons will vote on whether to make TV permanent.
   ``It's unlikely that they won't continue it unless there's a
major row,'' C-SPAN chairman Brian Lamb predicted in a phone
interview from London, where he's overseeing a series of live
telecasts slated for this week.
   C-SPAN last week dispatched a staff to London for a week of
preliminary interviews, including call-ins from American viewers.
Among those fielding questions today is John Grist, who oversees
the Commons' eight-camera TV system.
   For C-SPAN, a non-profit industry-supported cooperative that
says it is seen in 46.8 million homes and offices, Tuesday may
prove a legislative tale of two cities, one that enables viewers to
see differences in at least the oratory of lawmakers in London and
Washington.
   If the American House still is in session Tuesday, a C-SPAN
spokesman says, ``we will go live to the U.S. House and air that in
its entirety, then pick up the British House in progress. Then,
that evening, we'll air the British House (proceedings) in its
entirety.''
   No video bundle from Britain is scheduled for Wednesday. But on
Thanksgiving day, at 9:30 a.m. EST, C-SPAN will air, live, another
Commons session in its entirety.
   ``It might go eight or ten hours,'' Lamb says. ``It's a good
chance for people who are busy on Tuesday to just tune in, just
look at it.''
   On Sunday, C-SPAN will show taped highlights of the week.
   The real action _ C-SPAN hopes to show it live _ will come on
Nov. 28 at 10:15 a.m. EST, when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
faces opposition Labor leader Neil Kinnock for a 15-minute
``question time'' session.
   Such sessions, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, are rarely sedate and
usually rife with riposte. Unlike the comparatively tame give and
take of the U.S. House, question time in the Commons ``is meant to
be confrontational,'' Lamb notes.
   ``They stand literally eight feet apart, looking each other in
the eye, both the Prime Minister and the leader of the Labor Party
... it's electric. And there's a lot of hooting and howling in the
chamber...
   ``They do it partly to throw everybody off guard.''
   Alas, as in the American House, the British House has strict
rules about what TV can and cannot show. If there is a noisy
disruption, the Commons camera crews are told to ignore it and
focus only on the Speaker, Bernard Weatherill.

   REASON NO. 365 TO CONTINUE LIVING _ NBC-owned CNBC says Morton
Downey Jr. is joining the ranks of distinguished TV visitors to
Germany _ they include Maury Povich of ``A Current Affair'' _
who've gone there since the dramatic Berlin Wall developments.
   However, Downey, who will co-star on CNBC's ``Showdown'' series
that begins on Dec. 4, is not going to Germany to report on the
Wall. Instead, he will appear on two specials on Munich Television
on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The specials of Downey, whose syndicated and often noisy talk
show was canceled earlier this year, ``are meant to explain to
German viewers what American television is all about,'' according
to a CNBC spokesman.

<HEAD>Filipinos Concerned About Growing Drug Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A growing drug trade has led to
concern that the Philippines is in danger of becoming the Colombia
of the Far East. Calls are going out for tougher laws and the death
penalty for drug dealers.
   Police say the illegal drug trade has become a $41
million-a-year business in recent years. The three largest drug
syndicates employ about 15,000 people fulltime, according to police
estimates.
   The trade comes nowhere near that of Colombia's
multibillion-dollar drug cartels, but experts here say most of the
narcotics produced in the Philippines are used locally.
   But Filipino and foreign experts fear the country could become a
major regional drug center because of a favorable climate for
growing marijuana, corruption and inefficiency within the police
and established trade and communications links to the United States
and other markets.
   In October, U.S. agents in Los Angeles seized two tons of
Philippine-grown marijuana worth $14 million in what was believed
to be an attempt to establish a pipeline between Manila and
California.
   Two Americans of Filipino ancestry were arrested recently in
Honolulu for allegedly trying to smuggle in two pounds of the drug
crystal methamphetamine, a widely abused drug known in Southeast
Asia as ``shabu'' and said by officials and drug experts to be more
addictive than crack.
   Philippine-grown marijuana and other drugs also have turned up,
albeit in modest amounts, in Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan,
Pakistan, Turkey and some European countries, police say.
   Foreign and Filipino narcotics officials say syndicates have
been bringing in foreigners, mostly Europeans, to teach growers
here how to grow better quality marijuana.
   Last year, police uprooted 15 million marijuana plants and
seized 7.5 tons of marijuana packed for shipment abroad.
   ``If we do not do something about this, there might come a time
when we will see the spectacle of the Philippines becoming like
Colombia, where drug lords even have armies, helicopters, planes
and even tanks,'' Sen. Alberto Romulo said at a recent Philippine
Senate hearing.
   Public concern over the problem began to grow in October after
Sen. Ernesto Herrera charged that at least 17 police and military
members, including a brigadier general, were protecting drug lords.
   According to the police, the drug trade is flourishing because
of the potential for huge profits in a country where the annual per
capita income is only about $600.
   Marijuana can be bought in remote mountain plantations for 200
pesos ($9) a kilo (2.2 pounds) and sold in Manila for 10 times as
much.
   Shabu, the crystaline drug, can be purchased in Hong Kong for
about $2,270 a kilo and sold in Manila for the equivalent of
$45,450. Sources say some shabu also is being made locally.
   Corruption among police and customs officials is said to
compound the enforcement problem.
   Col. Virgilio David, chief of the national police Narcotics
Command, said his unit is riddled with corruption because poorly
paid policemen find it difficult to turn down bribes from drug
syndicates. He said at least 40 of his officers and men had been
removed in an attempt to combat corruption.
   David and others say stronger laws and greater police powers are
needed in the Philippines.
   ``In Hong Kong, if you go there and the police doubt your
papers, they can just detain you,'' David said. ``That is the same
case in Singapore and Malaysia. They have stronger laws that
empower the police to arrest anybody based only on strong suspicion
that they are a violators of the law. We must have the same kind of
laws here.''
   David said the military has urged Congress to revive the death
penalty for drug dealers. The Constitution, ratified in 1987,
abolished capital punishment but allows Congress to revive it for
``heinous'' crimes.
   He also said the government should establish special courts to
handle only drug offenses to speed up trials, which often drag on
here for years.
   Because of legal obstacles in enforcing the laws, critics say,
police often simply execute big-time dealers and then report that
they were killed in a ``shootout.''
   In the Manila area alone, at least 22 drug pushers have been
killed in ``shootouts'' with police since Herrera made his charges
about the police and military in October.
   Sen. Neptali Gonzalez, a former justice secretary, said the
killings should persuade drug dealers to turn themselves in and
seek government protection.
   ``Otherwise, they may soon find themselves targets of
elimination,'' he said.

<HEAD>Western Companies Looking Cautiously Toward Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. companies don't want to miss out on
opportunities in Eastern Europe, but they are moving with caution,
as General Electric Co. signaled this past week with its investment
in a Hungarian light bulb maker.
   GE's $150 million purchase of a 50 percent stake in Tungsram was
labeled as one of the biggest U.S. investments to date in Eastern
Europe, but in fact it was not especially large.
   The sum was dwarfed by GE's announcement on Friday of plans to
spend $10 billion over the next five years on repurchasing its own
stock. GE Chairman John Welch described the Hungarian investment as
a ``prudent risk'' _ not a head-over-heels plunge.
   There are good reasons for caution. Communist political systems
appear to be crumbling, but the bloody suppression of protest in
China this past June is a reminder that an authoritarian reaction
remains possible.
   Also, the currencies of Eastern Europe, as in the Soviet Union,
are non-convertible, meaning it is difficult for Western companies
to take profits home from their joint ventures.
   The positive side is that Eastern Europe is not only a huge
potential market for consumer and capital goods, but a source of
inexpensive, relatively well-educated workers _ a point recognized
by General Electric.
   GE has bigger plans than selling light bulbs to Hungarians.
Welch told analysts and reporters Friday that the company hopes to
export lighting systems from Hungary to Western Europe, a market it
has so far been unable to crack because of the domination of NV
Philips and Siemens AG.
   GE recognized that too much caution is dangerous, too, because
there is a limited number of healthy potential business partners in
Eastern Europe.
   ``To some extent the choice spots will be taken by those who are
there first,'' said Peter J. Pettibone, a partner in the New York
law firm of Lord Day &amp; Lord, Barrett Smith.
   Western European companies have a built-in advantage over
Americans when it comes to selling to and investing in Eastern
Europe because of the geographic and cultural closeness.
   Less obviously, the Western Europeans have a banking advantage.
The biggest American banks were burned by foolish lending to Latin
America and are neither willing nor able to make a big plunge into
Eastern Europe.
   West German banks, in contrast, are rich and willing, notes
Donald Wich, a New York marketing director for the German American
Chamber of Commerce. The German banks are more likely to lend to
companies from West Germany than to, say, an Eastman Kodak Co. or
Ford Motor Co.
   Volkswagen AG of West Germany produces car engines in East
Germany and Italy's Fiat produces cars in Poland for export to
Western Europe, but so far the West's embrace of the so-called Iron
Curtain nations has been less than wholehearted.
   The ferment in Eastern Europe has overshadowed the opportunities
in the Soviet Union, but developments also continued there this
past week. The Joint Commercial Commission met in Washington this
past week, bringing together Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
and his Soviet counterpart, Konstantin Katushev, to discuss
lowering barriers to trade and investment.
   In spite of all the talk, investments in the Soviet Union remain
modest. The typical investment in U.S.-Soviet joint ventures is $3
million, according to a survey earlier this year by Lord Day &amp;
Lord, Barrett Smith.
   When Europe's ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. bought Connecticut's
Combustion Engineering Inc. this past week for $1.6 billion, a
company executive said it was ``charging full speed ahead'' into
the East bloc.
   In fact, ABB gets less than 1 percent of its revenue in the
Eastern bloc and President Percy Barnevik told reporters he is
hoping to raise that to perhaps 3 percent to 3.5 percent.
   Yes, businesses are moving into Eastern Europe. But with caution.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Government reports indicated economic sluggishness. Reports
said factory utilization slumped to the lowest level in 1{ years
and retail sales sank by the biggest amount in 2{ years as auto
sales tumbled. A big drop in the trade deficit mainly was the
result of slowing imports, although exports rose.
   _Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. announced an expensive overhaul of its
credit-services operation after being embarrassed by widespread
customer complaints. It said the reforms would cut next year's
profits about a tenth. Analysts had been predicting an earnings
gain in 1990.
   _Delta Air Lines announced it would buy up to 260 jets from
McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Boeing Co. in a transaction that could
be worth more than $10 billion. Texas Air Corp. said its
Continental Airlines unit would buy $4.5 billion worth of jetliners
from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium.

<HEAD>A Healthy Holiday Meal Can Be Satisfying</HEAD>

   From the Thanksgiving feast to New Year's Day
football, stuffing oneself as plump as the turkey seems almost
obligatory.
   And while a certain smugness may be the reward for not
indulging, few will find that sufficient sustenance at the holiday
table. There are ways to enjoy the fat of the land without making
the New Year's diet any tougher.
   ``Holidays should be subtitled `national days of carbohydrates
and fat,''' Ellen Brown writes in ``The Gourmet Gazelle Cookbook''
(Bantam Books, $19.95). ``A few years ago I was horrified to
realize I had used more than four pounds of butter in cooking
Thanksgiving dinner for eight people.''
   It's estimated that Thanksgiving gobbling can total 3,000
calories _ two normal days' worth of food for many women. But
Thanksgiving in particular, with its celebration of abundance and
variety, provides a chance to serve and eat healthy foods without
feeling left out. A key is flavorful, tradition-minded dishes
without large amounts of fats, cholesterol or salt.
   The centerpiece of most feasts, turkey, is a good place to start.
   ``You should take off the skin for your portion if you're trying
to lose weight,'' said Barbara Kafka, author of ``Microwave Gourmet
Healthstyle Cookbook'' (William Morrow and Co. Inc., $22.95). ``The
skin, unfortunately and sadly, is going to contain a major portion
of the fat and the cholesterol in the bird.''
   The roast turkey recipe in the American Heart Association's
``Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol Cookbook'' (Times Books, $18.95) calls
for stuffing the bird with parsley sprigs, apples and crushed
peppercorns. A separate recipe for cornbread dressing uses egg
whites, vegetable spray and just one tablespoon of margarine.
   Kafka also suggests paying close attention to side dishes and
considering skipping such traditional items as creamed onions,
buttery mashed potatoes and sugary canned cranberry sauce.
   ``I think people want some connection'' to the traditions, even
if they are willing to make some changes, she said. For dessert she
plans to make a pumpkin pudding, which is lighter than pie but
``satisfies most people in the sense of color, sweetness.''
   ``We're not trying to set out to deprive people. If people walk
around feeling constantly deprived, they are not going to stick
with a diet. It's very important not to set up an antithesis
between healthy food and pleasure.''
   Kafka will serve a fairly traditional Thanksgiving: vegetable
soup, turkey with a simple bread-and-sage stuffing, baked sweet
potatoes, braised leeks, raw cranberry sauce (with some of the
canned version for the children), apple pie and pumpkin pudding.
   For a giblet gravy that's lighter than normal, she suggests
cooking the turkey neck, wing tips and giblets (except the liver)
in a container of water in the microwave. Then, rather than the
fatty pan drippings, use the broth as the gravy base.
   To help make the meal a feast:
   _Choose the freshest foods possible.
   _Eat slowly and savor the flavors, and less food will be enough.
   _Decide in advance which ``indulgence foods'' are important and
which can be passed. Stick to those decisions.
   But in the end, if the stuffing, or the creamed onions or the
candied sweet potatoes are what makes you happy, go ahead.
   ``It's better to eat regular food, if that's going to make you
happy, but then try not to clean your plate,'' Kafka said. ``It's
not going to kill you to have something festive that has butter one
day a year.''

<HEAD>Time Running Short For Year-End Tax Maneuvers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The waning weeks of the year provide
stock-market investors with a rare opportunity to look favorably on
their mistakes.
   Those shares you bought for $50 that now sell for $32 aren't
just a painful lesson in the risks of playing the market _ they're
a potential tax deduction!
   That may not be consolation enough to soothe your regrets over
the loss of some hard-earned capital. But it may be sufficient
reason to warrant taking some action before 1989 ends.
   If you transform a theoretical ``paper'' loss into an actual one
by selling the offending securities, the loss you realize
(including brokerage commissions you paid at both purchase and
sale) can be deducted without limit from any capital gains you had
during the year.
   People with more losses than gains, or no gains at all, can
deduct losses against their other income up to a maximum of $3,000
a year. Losses beyond that are carried forward to future years.
   Financial advisers urge anyone who is a candidate for year-end
maneuvers along these lines not to delay much longer.
   Depressed investments which are most likely choices for tax
selling often get further depressed in December when that tax
selling reaches its peak, they point out.
   In addition, they say, it may take a little time and planning to
decide what you want to do with the money you receive from the sale.
   The rules don't permit selling a security to realize a loss and
simultaneously buying it back. In fact, if the offsetting purchase
occurs any time within 30 days beforehand or afterward, it is
considered a ``wash sale'' and the loss can't be deducted.
   A common way to skirt this obstacle is to switch into some
similar security _ say, a stock of another company in a comparable
business with about the same business prospects.
   Switching is especially suited to bond investments, where you
can shop for a security of a different issuer with a yield,
maturity and credit rating much the same as the one you sold.
   William Brennan, editor of the Ernst &amp; Young Financial Planning
Reporter, advises would-be bond swappers, ``don't delay making a
decision until December. It takes time to find comparable bonds.''
   With stocks, switching is more problematic, since the
performances of individual companies' stock prices can be
drastically affected by a long list of variables.
   Furthermore, you still may consider the future bright for a
stock you own that has been a disappointment to date.
   If you want to take a deductible loss while sticking with that
stock, you have two primary choices _ sell it now and buy it back
31 days later, or buy another chunk now and sell the original
holding after 31 days have passed.
   The alternative of buying another chunk now protects you against
the risk that the stock might suddenly soar while you have
temporarily stepped aside. But it demands prompt action for any
losses you want to take in 1989.
   Any good broker should be ready and eager to help you through
the process of taking judicious tax losses _ as well as suggesting
strategies for postponing capital gains into 1990.
   After all, year-end tax transactions are a time-tested source of
commission revenue for the broker and his or her firm.
   That's a point worth bearing in mind for the customer as well as
the broker. The research devoted to any year-end tax planning
should include an appraisal of whether the tax savings achieved are
worth the transaction costs.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Gleaming Brighter For Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors spooked by the stock market have taken to precious
metals, a fact reflected by the sparkling performance of the gold,
silver and platinum markets in the past week.
   The rise in prices also has caught the attention of jewelry
makers and other commercial consumers of precious metals, whose
higher-volume buying underscores the consensus among analysts that
prices are unlikely to lapse to the relatively low levels that have
prevailed for much of this year.
   The price of gold, traditionally the bellwether of the precious
metals complex, has jumped nearly 8 percent in the five weeks since
the stock market's 190-point plunge on Oct. 13. Gold for December
delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange closed at $395.80 a troy
ounce Friday compared to $388.60 a week earlier.
   December silver soared to $5.685 an ounce from $5.26 during a
week of heavy trading on the Commodity Exchange while platinum for
January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
$526.60 an ounce from $509.60.
   Analysts closely are watching the gold market as an indicator of
the rally's underlying strength. A move above $400 an ounce, a key
psychological barrier last crossed in late January, likely would
bring new buyers into the market and push prices sharply higher.
   ``I suspect we'll see gold test the $400 level before the year's
end,'' said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber
Inc. in New York.
   Other analysts said the gold market seemed poised for a test of
$400 an ounce as early as next week.
   Precious metals, especially gold, traditionally are perceived as
a safe haven for investors during periods of rapid inflation or
economic uncertainty, when it is considered more likely to hold its
value than paper currencies or stocks.
   Analysts say the stock market's volatility has made U.S.
investors nervous enough to move some of their dollars into
precious metals. Meanwhile, the far-reaching political and social
changes occurring in Eastern Europe have stirred fears of economic
trouble among European investors and driven them to the gold and
silver markets as well.
   ``You're seeing a lot of retail buying from investors who have
stood on the sidelines for two years,'' said Bruce L. Kaplan,
president of Kaplan &amp; Co., a Los Angeles-based metals and coins
dealer. ``The money seems to be coming out of the stock and bond
markets.''
   Experts also have noted heavy buying of precious metals by
Japanese interests in the past week, perhaps reflecting investor
uneasiness in the Far East or stockpiling by Japanese jewelers.
   ``You can never underestimate the potential demand from Japan
for both platinum and gold,'' Savaiko said. Platinum is the most
popular jewelry metal in Japan.
   Platinum got an additional boost from the mid-week release of
revised 1989 supply and demand projections by London-based Johnson
Matthey PLC, the world's largest platinum refiner.
   Johnson Matthey predicted world platinum consumption would
outstrip production by 120,000 ounces this year, which would make
1989 the fifth straight year of deficit production and falling
warehouse stocks.
   The silver market showed remarkable strength Wednesday through
Friday. Analysts said the market was playing catch-up with gold and
platinum after lagging behind those markets.

   The grain and soybean markets exhibited slight but steady
strength through most of the week. The gains were largely seasonal,
reflecting the end of the corn and soybean harvest and a shift in
the market's attention from supply to demand concerns.

   Oil prices were little changed on the week. Strength in the
heating oil and crude oil markets late in the week was linked to
wintry weather in the Northeast and to speculation that an
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting beginning
Saturday in Vienna could lead to lower crude-oil production
ceilings.

   Prices were little changed, although prospects for more U.S.
food aid to Poland continued supporting the pork markets. A monthly
Agriculture Department report released after the close of trading
Friday showed three percent fewer cattle on feedlots Nov. 1 than on
the same date a year ago. Although that number was near market
expectations, the report also showed an unexpectedly large number
of feedlot placements last month. That was expected to prompt
fairly heavy selling of live cattle futures when trading resumes
Monday.

<HEAD>Wall Street's Eyes on Eastern Europe</HEAD>

   As political barriers have toppled between
Communist and capitalist parts of Europe in recent days, Wall
Street analysts have been watching with a particular sense of
urgency.
   They see a rare opportunity to spot turning points that might
well shape economic and financial trends worldwide for years to
come.
   Preoccupied as they may often seem with fleeting matters _ the
next swing in interest rates, or a 15-cent reduction in some
company's earnings estimate for the next fiscal quarter _ most
stock-market professionals are perpetually searching for news with
a longer shelf-life.
   These prizes don't turn up very often. Like the weather,
financial trends are even more resistant to long-term analysis than
they are to short-term forecasting.
   So the developments in Berlin, in Poland and elsewhere along the
front lines of the Cold War have struck many Wall Streeters as the
equivalent of a new gold mine, full of risks as well as rewards.
   ``If the Eastern bloc continues to liberalize, the world is
going to look very different in a few years,'' said Michael Sherman
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``As a result, financial markets
will undergo major changes _ some bullish, some not so bullish.''
   At this early stage, analysts readily acknowledge, the puzzle
they have to work with is a vast one, with many pieces that are
hard to fit together.
   They also caution that a seeming triumph for capitalism can be
suddenly reversed, as happened earlier this year at in China at
Tiananmen Square.
   ``At some stage Eastern Europe will pass a point of no return on
the path to democracy, and it will be impossible for the Soviets to
turn back the clock,'' observed John Connolly at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   ``The trick will be to get to that point quickly, before the
door is shut _ but not so quickly that evolution devolves into
revolution and invites reaction.''
   That kind of qualified optimism seemed to fit the mood of
investors in general during the past week. The Dow Jones average of
30 industrial stocks rose 27.05 to 2,652.66.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 1.38 to
189.28; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 0.93 to 456.72, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 1.88 at 373.35.
   Big Board volume averaged 147.69 million shares a day, against
148.76 million the week before.
   If capitalism is about to flower in Eastern Europe, most
analysts see a vast range of possible implications for the world's
financial markets.
   Said Sherman: ``Trade flows between the West and East could
accelerate sharply, bank credits to Eastern bloc countries could
explode, defense budgets would come under enormous downward
pressure.''
   Adds Greg Smith at Prudential-Bache Securities, ``The very
obvious eager demand for American identifiable brand names such as
Levi's, Nike, Coca-Cola and McDonald's means that a huge market
exists that might well be able to afford these products within the
intermediate future, assuming that no political disruptions occur
along the way.''
   Furthermore, noted Connolly, ``A lot of machinery will be needed
_ both traditional and technological capital goods.''
   Amid all the optimism, however, analysts caution that securities
markets are subject to wide and unpredictable changes of heart as
they adjust to something as complicated as the situation in Europe.
   ``Trying to draw some economic conclusions about these
developments is guesswork at the very best,'' said Smith. ``I
suggest that when the joy and excitement subside, something like a
hangover could be ahead.
   ``There's a lot of risk associated with moving from a very
centralized controlled political system to one with more individual
participation.''
