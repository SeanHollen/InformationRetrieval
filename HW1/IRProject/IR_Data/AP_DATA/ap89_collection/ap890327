   The United States and Iraq have reached
agreement in principle for Iraq to pay compensation for the 37 U.S.
sailors killed aboard the frigate Stark in a May, 1987 Iraqi
missile attack in the Persian Gulf, sources said Monday.
   The compensation package still needs the formal approval of both
governments, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Progress on the stalled claim request was made when a U.S.
delegation, led by State Department legal adviser Abraham Sofaer,
went to Baghdad last week. The talks ended Monday and Sofaer was
headed back to Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said.
   In their talks, the U.S. and Iraqi teams apparently ``are
reaching the final stages of achieving a substantial settlement on
the claims,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She said she did not know when the actual agreement would be
concluded and could not divulge details of its content.
   At the Pentagon, defense sources said an agreement had been
reached but they described the accord as ``tentative _ subject to
review back here in Washington.''
   The United States presented Iraq with a $29.6 million claim for
the families of 37 crewmembers who died on the guided missile
frigate Stark when an Iraqi jet fighter fired two French-made
Exocet missiles at the ship.
   Iraq claimed the missile attack was a mistake born of the
tensions of the Iran-Iraq war.
   The U.S. claim was presented 11 months ago but Iraq rejected the
amount, which includes $800,000 for each of the families.
   The defense sources, who insisted on anonymity, said they could
not discuss the dollar amount in the agreement or how it might be
divided among the families of those who were killed; the sailors
who were injured; and as settlement toward the cost of repairing
the Stark.
   ``But apparently our negotiators are recommending we settle for
a bit less than we were originally asking with the goal of ending
further delays in settling the issue,'' one source said.
   In addition to the $29.6 million sought for the families of the
37 dead sailors, the Navy has asked Iraq to pay $82.9 million to
cover the cost of repairing the Stark and returning it to active
duty with the fleet.
   Pentagon officials have refused to say how much they asked Iraq
to pay to sailors who suffered injuries but survived the attack.

   Outgoing baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth
is discussing a purchase of strikebound Eastern Airlines, the
Associated Press learned Monday.
   Meanwhile, a judge ordered a hearing on Eastern's attempts to
force its pilots back to work, and sources said former Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci is among those being considered to head
the carrier's reorganization.
   An offer from Ueberroth may be presented to Eastern parent Texas
Air Corp.'s board of directors within the next few days, airline
industry and baseball sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell, contacted for comment at his
Miami home, said, ``I've heard about it. But we just don't comment
on rumors.''
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent in Houston said his company would
have no comment on the matter.
   ``There are a lot of those rumors going around,'' Kent said.
``If and when any agreement is reached to sell Eastern I'm sure all
the parties involved will issue a statement.''
   Ueberroth spokesman Rich Levin, contacted in New York City, said
the commissioner did not wish to comment on the matter.
   A source said the deal would involve Kirk Kerkorian, a Los
Angeles businessman who is a friend of Ueberroth's and is majority
owner of MGM-UA Communications Co. Ueberroth, who headed the host
committee for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, is to step down as
baseball commissioner on Saturday.
   A call to Kerkorian's office seeking comment Monday night was
not answered.
   Texas Air's board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting
Tuesday and Wednesday, said a source close to the company.
   Ueberroth was approached last fall by officials of Eastern's
unions to consider taking over the troubled airline, which filed
for bankruptcy protection March 9, five days after the start of the
Machinists' strike supported by airline pilots.
   The Machinists and pilots unions have said they would make
concessions if Ueberroth took over, possibly in return for
ownership of part of the airline.
   A call to the Machinists local in Miami was not answered Monday
night.
   Ueberroth met with Eastern officials during baseball's winter
meetings in Atlanta last December, then traveled to Miami for
further talks, a baseball source said. In addition, Ueberroth and
Kerkorian have discussed a possible buyout with Texas Air Chairman
Frank Lorenzo.
   In Miami, U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis set a hearing
Thursday on a key issue tossed back to him by an appeals court.
   The appellate court said Davis must decide if the pilots are
merely honoring Machinists union picket lines legally, or if they
are trying to advance their own cause with their walkout, which
could violate the National Railway Labor Act.
   The Air Line Pilots Association has backed the full hearing,
denying their strike is illegal.
   In refusing to cross the picket line, ALPA ``certainly
considered our parallel interests to strengthen our position to
obtain our own collective bargaining interests,'' said pilots'
attorney James Linsey. ``There is nothing wrong with that.''
   Eastern proceeded on another front against the pilots Monday,
inaugurating its first six-week training class to replace pilots
who walked out with Machinists on March 4. While the carrier had
planned to begin training up to 50 replacement pilots Monday, the
class size ended up smaller than that.
   ``We cut back to 35,'' said company spokesman Robin Matell,
adding that all the new hires had impressive qualifications. The
carrier said many are pilots from other carriers hoping to bump up
their seniority by jumping to Eastern.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee Harold Jones, who is
administering Eastern's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorginization in New
York, said Monday he is considering about a dozen candidates for
examiner in the complex case.
   Jones, who declined to name names, said the ideal examiner would
be ``someone who can play the role of statesman.''
   Sources who spoke under condition of anonymity told The
Associated Press that the list includes Carlucci and top securities
fraud lawyer Leon Silverman.
   Jones said he hopes to decide by late this week or early nex
week, and will recommend that person to U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge
Burton Lifland.
   Lifland has said he would appoint an examiner with sweeping
powers to try to mediate the bitter dispute between Eastern and its
unions. The examiner also will review financial transactions
between Eastern, Texas Air and sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   Silverman, a Washington-based securities lawyer who represented
some claimants in Manville Corp.'s Chapter 11 proceeding starting
in August 1982, also is one of the lead defense attorneys for
imprisoned insider trader Ivan F. Boesky.
   Carlucci is now vice chairman and managing director of The
Carlyle Group, an investment banking firm in Washington, D.C.
   Carlucci's secretary said he was unavailable to comment.
Silverman said he wasn't aware he was on the list.

   It's Academy Awards time again, the glamour,
the glitz and the ballyhoo. But Oscar can easily be upstaged by the
Hollywood sideshows sharing the bill.
   Who's wearing what and with whom _ the evening's Five Ws _ have
been known to steal the show from the golden statuettes that come
later, as arriving celebrities ritualistically alight from their
black limos.
   On the party scene, the Academy's official Governor's Ball is
generally a staid affair and Oscar winners usually make only
obligatory appearances before heading to private parties.
   But this year, many stars will party while watching the awards
on television.
   ``It is very fashionable this year to say, `I'm not going to the
Oscars,''' said celebrity insider Susan Price, who is also a public
relations consultant for Beverly Hills hair stylist Umberto.
   Superagent Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar will throw his annual Oscar
soiree at the posh eatery Spago, with dozens of celebrities
expected to gather there to watch the awards on television. Those
expected include Jeff Bridges, Glenn Close, Joan Collins, Michael
Douglas and Jane Fonda.
   The city's No. 1 celebrity of late, former President Ronald
Reagan, turned down an invitation to Lazar's party to watch the
awards with wife, Nancy, at their Bel-Air home, said spokesman Mark
Weinberg.
   Actress Elizabeth Taylor will hold a private get-together to
watch the Oscars show, and Ernest and Tova Borgnine will cast mock
ballots with friends during a private party in their Beverly Hills
home.
   Other mockers will gather at the Palace club in Hollywood, the
scene of the Golden Raspberry Foundation's annual Oscar spoof
ceremony, which this year will be held simultaneously with the
Academy Awards.
   Guests will dine on a potluck dinner while viewing the real
Oscar show on a large-screen TV. Presentation of the plastic
``Razzie'' trophies, which honor the worst in entertainment, will
be made during commercial breaks.
   The Oscars ceremony may not be the only game in town Wednesday,
but it could be the most expensive. A complete Academy Awards
evening can range from $1,800 to $15,000 per person.
   A seat at the Shrine Auditorium ceremony costs $150, the
Governor's Ball runs $450, it's $500 for a stretch-limousine,
tuxedo rental is about $70 and designer gowns range from $1,200 to
$12,000.
   Producer Allan Carr, who hired designers Ray Klausen and Fred
Hayman to spiff up the Oscar show, said the awards will be big,
glitzy and nostalgic, more like a Broadway play than the annual
parade to the podium.
   ``The trend this year will be drop-dead chic entrance gowns,''
said Hayman. ``The idea this year is a return to great glamour, the
Hollywood of the past. The public looks to Hollywood for glamour.''
He promised ``a lot of wonderful beading'' on the gowns.
   Two celebrities can particularly be expected to have the
drop-dead look. Cher can usually be counted on to expose her navel,
and actress-model Edy Williams habitually steps out of a limousine
wearing not much of anything.

<HEAD>NRA Loads Up as Gun Issue Heats Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association, traditional
heart, soul and bankroll of the nation's gun lobby, is digging in
for a test of its vaunted political power amid rising pressure to
curb sales of assault weapons.
   ``When less than half the convicted felons ever spend a day in
jail, why should we be taking firearms away from law-abiding
people?'' declares James Jay Baker, federal affairs director for
the 118-year old NRA.
   Demands for restrictions on military-style, semiautomatic
firearms are escalating, however, in the aftermath of the Stockton,
Calif., schoolyard tragedy Jan. 17 in which a deranged gunman with
an assault rifle left five youngsters dead and 30 other persons
injured.
   So intense is the clamor that, as often as the NRA has crushed
or blunted gun control bills in the past, many doubt that it can
prevail this time with its strategy of blaming the murder wave
sweeping cocaine-ridden communities not on firearms but ``our
crumbling criminal justice system.''
   ``We're certainly going to try,'' says lobbyist Baker.
   Even Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who urged Democrats to
softpedal the gun issue after the 1988 election, says public
opinion is ripe for action on semiautomatics. ``I think the NRA is
stubbing its toe here,'' he says. ``The appearance of being
unwilling to deal with assault rifles has hurt them.''
   From its modern headquarters on Rhode Island Avenue in downtown
Washington, a few blocks from the White House, the NRA deploys
lobbyists to Capitol Hill and statehouses across the nation,
provides generous campaign contributions to its political friends
and generates tons of literature to fill the mailboxes of America's
gun enthusiasts.
   With annual revenues of $70 million and a staff of 365
employees, including 65 in its lobbying department, the NRA is well
equipped to fight its political battles. It also has powerful
friends. President Bush is a member. And its roots go deep in the
fabric of American life.
   Founded in 1871 by National Guard officers, the NRA has long
counted many military men and policemen among its members. It holds
firearms courses for police, private security firms and private
citizens.
   It is recognized by the U.S. Olympic Committee as the national
governing body of shooting sports in the United States and
maintains a junior program for youngsters. It also provides
self-defense courses for women and maintains a 1,100-piece gun
museum within its headquarters as well as a special,
``Muzzleloaders'' division within its membership for history buffs.
   Last year, the NRA got the House to shelve a proposed seven-day
waiting period for would-be gun buyers. Failure of the bill named
for former presidential spokesman James Brady, brain damaged in the
1981 attempt on President Reagan, spurred Brady's wife to urge
readers in full-page magazine ads to help ``break the NRA's death
grip on Congress.''
   The real secret of the NRA's power has long been its ability to
mobilize hundreds of thousands of gun owners across the nation to
write and telephone lawmakers. ``Please open immediately.
Legislative alert,'' trumpets a mailing that went to Virginia gun
owners in February.
   It warns of an impending bill in Richmond in which ``the
anti-gunners ... have launched an all-out attack on semiautomatic
firearms in line with their goal of banning all firearms.''
   ``Your immediate action is needed to defeat this dangerous
bill,'' it says. But the General Assembly nevertheless approved the
measure calling for a background check of would-be gun buyers.
California lawmakers are expected to pass a more stringent measure
and bills are pending in Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland,
Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Texas.
   A number of cities, including Los Angeles and Cleveland, also
have approved restrictions on semiautomatic weapons. And on Sunday,
the International Association of Chiefs of Police announced its
opposition to the public sale and distribution of the guns.
   The chain reaction has led to a further question of NRA power.
``The NRA is being forced increasingly to the fringes of this
debate,'' says Dr. Garen Wintemute of Sacramento, Calif., who
treated AK-47 assault rifle wounds as a doctor in a Cambodian
jungle hospital in 1981. On coming home, he was shocked to find the
same AK-47 wounds in the United States.
   ``More and more people are willing to come out and say, the
emperor has no clothes, meaning the NRA,'' says the doctor, who has
become an outspoken critic of assault-rifle sales.
   Others are more skeptical about the alleged erosion of NRA power.
   ``The NRA members haven't lost anything with me,'' declares Rep.
Harold Volkmer, D-Mo. Few if any House members take a dimmer view
of gun control.
   Pending bills aimed at military-style assault weapons also would
``take away my Browning shotgun and my thirty-ought-six deer
rifle,'' says Volkmer. ``I think we can kill that up here. I think
we can beat it.''
   What happens in the House will depend heavily on the view from
the hustings. Democrats say a blizzard of NRA mailings against 1988
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis were probably not decisive.
But they hurt, especially in states where gun owners are plentiful.
   Texas political consultant George Christian says the Dukakis
stand in favor of toughened gun control ``wasn't the No.1 issue''
in his state ``but as part of a package of issues that subjected
him to attack from the other side, it played a very important
role.''
   ``The Republicans used gun control advertising very heavily, so
obviously their polling showed that it was an important issue,'' he
says.
   But on Capitol Hill, a stream of gun-control bills is flowing
into the hopper, sponsored by Rep. Fortney (Pete) Stark, D-Calif.,
and an array of other Californians.
   The most heavily spotlighted bill, however, is being offered by
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. It would place certain
semiautomatics, such as the AK-47 and the Israeli-made Uzi, in the
same restricted-sales category with fully automatic machine guns.
   It also would allow the Treasury Department to put additional
semiautomatics in the same class. Private citizens may own machine
guns but only if they are fingerprinted, pay a $200 fee, undergo an
FBI background check and get permission from their local law
enforcement officials.
   This has not deterred all firearms fans. Grant Stapleton, a
Pennsylvania NRA member, declares that he would hate to part with
the .50-caliber machine gun that is the centerpiece of his
collection. Why does he want it?
   ``What does anyone pay $150,000 for a Ferrari? Why does anyone
want a Matisse?'' Stapleton muses. His company makes a
sinister-looking round-drummed, semiautomatic shotgun called the
Striker, which pumps out 12 rounds of 12-gauge shot in three
seconds. The weapon, designed by a Rhodesian farmer to chase off
rebels, is precisely what Metzenbaum wants to outlaw.

   Whether they're from Cambodia, El Salvador,
Vietnam, Ethiopia or Iraq, they all seem to speak the same
language: the language of the refugee.
   The voice and the picture of the world's 14 million political
refugees _ of whom it has been calculated that only three of every
100 ever return to their homeland _ is brought home in a newly
published photo book.
   The book, ``Forced Out,'' represents an unusual collaboration by
four publishing houses and a foundation in an attempt to inspire a
global movement on behalf of the human rights of refugees, often
unwanted guests in unwelcoming camps. It consists largely of
accounts by refugees of the sometimes bewildering, frightening or
hopeless twists their lives took once they were forced from their
homelands.
   To a world inured to political disaster, the voices sound
familiar.
   A Salvadoran, describing how the National Guard conscripts boys
from a sleeping village: ``No one could run that night, maybe
because the boys were still half asleep. `They are only going for a
year,' the members of the patrol would say to make us feel better,
`and they'll be more civilized when we send them back. In the
barracks they learn to read and mind their manners,' they went on,
without looking at anyone, addressing the stones that were us. The
year was up but they never came back. No one comes back.''
   An Ethiopian, resettled in Somalia: ``Arriving in the area of
settlement we were scared to death. You feel lost. ... Never had we
seen such thick forest, inhabited only by wild animals, snakes and
big, biting flies. Homeland was a beautiful place, full of grazing
cattle. My dreams are still bound to my homeland.''
   An Afghan looking for a new home: ``We were deported from the
United States to Korea on March 29. They next day Korean Airlines
took us to Taiwan and then to Hong Kong. Hong Kong refused us and
sent us back to Korea. The Koreans then sent us to Sri Lanka and
told the Sri Lankan authorities that we should be sent on to
Afghanistan. The Sri Lankan government refused to accept us ... so
Korean Airlines took us to Saudi Arabia.''
   A Salvadoran: ``If we speak out, they kill us. If we're
suspected of speaking out, they disappear us. And if we keep our
mouths shut, they think we're hiding something. So they kill us for
that too.''
   In one painful paragraph, a famous American doctor, Howard A.
Rusk, describes how the body starves:
   ``Nature becomes kinder to the starving at this juncture, kinder
than the politicians arguing about boundaries and power. A great
overpowering lethargy develops, and a kind and wise nature offers
large doses of sleep to ease the pain of slow death. In the
meantime the body proteins have been depleted, the water and
electrolyte balance destroyed. The abdomen becomes distended with
fluids, the extremities swollen with water, and now the
degeneration of the vital organs such as the liver and the kidneys
starts in earnest ...''
   A Vietnamese boat person describes the desperation of the
starving: ``Our food and water ran out. No ship rescued us. `Please
wait until tomorrow. I'll die. Then you'll eat me,' said Dao Huo
Cuong. Three of us pulled Cuong out of the cabin and held his head
in water. Then one of us butchered him. Four others helped. We
cooked the meat in boiling water. I remember we prayed to the Lord
before we killed Mr. Cuong.''
   Principal author Carole Kismaric says political rather than
natural disasters create most refugees and most are forced from
their homes by their own governments, either for supporting rival
factions or so that their land can be seized.
   Bill Frelick of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, in an essay on
how countries accept or reject refugees, writes, ``Refugees are
inconvenient. Their concern is not for order, systems or
bureaucracies, nor for the general welfare. Their concern, rather,
is for survival _ their own and that of their families.
   ``Governments, on the other hand, have competing concerns: the
sovereignty of borders, relations with neighboring countries,
controlling immigration, promoting ruling ideologies, placating
public opinion. If offering asylum to a refugee is consonant with
those concerns, a government might come to his aid.''
   ``Forced Out,'' a collection of photographs and first-person
accounts refugees, was commissioned by the J. M. Kaplan Fund,
supporter of Human Rights Watch, which monitors the conditions of
refugees. It was published in a collaboration by Random House, W.W.
Norton &amp; Co., William Morrow &amp; Co. and Penguin Books, Ltd., with
profits earmarked for the Human Rights Fund.

<HEAD>Rare Condor Egg Found at Zoo on Easter Morning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A tiny, pale aqua egg was found in the nest
box of a pair of nearly extinct California condors at the Los
Angeles Zoo.
   The egg, measuring 5 inches long, 3 inches in circumference and
weighing about 10 ounces, was spotted early Easter Sunday morning.
   Zoo workers took the egg to an incubator while the parents,
Cuyama and Cachuma, a pair of 6-year-olds, were away from the nest.
   ``What an Easter egg!,'' said zoo spokeswoman Deborah Pollack.
``If fertile, God willing, it will hatch in 54 to 58 days.''
   The pair had an egg last month that proved to be infertile. Zoo
officials also took that egg away for artificial incubation in
hopes that Cachuma would ``double clutch'' or lay a second egg.
   ``We have high hopes for this egg because since the time of the
last one they have definitely improved their (mating) technique,''
Ms. Pollack said. ``It's a big egg, a nice egg. It looks good but
we won't know for sure for another week.''
   She added that there were no cracks in the shell.
   In the wild, the massive birds with a 9{-foot wing span would
normally lay one egg every other year, Ms. Pollack said.
   Molloko is the only California condor chick conceived in
captivity. The bird was born last April and stays in the San Diego
Wild Animal Park.
   There are only 28 California condors left in the world. Fourteen
of them are in the Wild Animal Park and 14 at the Los Angeles Zoo.

   For years, the United States has urged,
threatened and cajoled the Kremlin to allow free emigration from
the Soviet Union. But now that thousands of Soviets are being let
out, many are finding the doors to the United States closed.
   Some 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow for permission to enter the United States as
refugees; another 7,000 are waiting in temporary quarters near
Rome, according to State Department figures.
   The steadily growing backlog appears to result from several
factors: poor planning by the administration, severe budget
restraints and a change in the Justice Department's refugee policy.
   ``Now that the Soviet Union has chosen to let these people go,
we must not fail them,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., who has
sponsored one of several proposed funding bills to ease the
emergency.
   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., co-sponsor of another emergency
funding proposal, warned that ``Gorbachev's policies could change
overnight. We have to take advantage of this moment.''
   Soviet applicants have been told their processing could take as
long as two years and have been advised not to quit jobs or tell
landlords they plan to leave for fear of finding themselves without
work or housing.
   Last fall the United States asked Soviet authorities to withhold
exit permits until some of the backlog can be cleared, Jewish
community officials say.
   At the current rate of Soviet applications _ about 4,000 a month
_ the United States will run out of allocated refugee slots by
April or May. In January, the State Department shifted 7,000 unused
slots meant for Vietnamese refugees to accommodate the Soviet
overflow. Revised estimates project some 40,000 Soviet applicants
this year, about 20,000 more than was budgeted for by the
administration.
   The crisis has been compounded by a change in Justice Department
policy, which no longer grants automatic refugee status to every
person seeking to leave the Soviet Union.
   In the past, all Soviet Jews, who account for the majority of
Soviet emigres, were presumed to have a ``well founded fear of
persecution'' and therefore were considered refugees.
   Jews were subjected to government-backed anti-Semitism,
prevented from studying Hebrew or practicing their religion and
denied permission to leave. In 1984, the low point of Jewish
emigration, only 896 Jews were let out.
   A directive issued last summer by former Attorney General Edwin
Meese ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
determine refugee status for Soviets on a case-by-case basis rather
than as a group, in keeping with the way U.S. laws are applied for
other refugee applicants.
   This has resulted in denials for as many as 70 percent of Moscow
applicants for refugee status, according to a just-released report
by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
   The report found a 50 percent reversal rate on appeal by those
denied, evidence of ``uneven standards and inconsistencies among
INS officers.''
   The report faulted INS inspectors for, in many cases, not
speaking Russian and not knowing about life in the Soviet Union. In
some cases, INS processors were brought to Moscow from duty along
the U.S.-Mexican border and applied the same standards to Soviet
applicants as to Mexicans, the report said.
   Those denied refugee status are being offered parolee status,
which does not provide government funding nor does it allow the
recipients to eventually apply for citizenship.
   ``This sends a message to the Soviet government that the United
States no longer views Jews and other minorities as persecuted
people,'' said David Harris, Washington representative of the
American Jewish Committee which lobbies for Soviet Jewish
immigration. ``It's a strange political statement as a time when
the administration has decided to keep up its pressure on Gorbachev
to comply with international human rights standards,'' he said.
   The administration, caught in a squeeze, is scrambling to
respond.
   The White House is preparing an emergency request to Congress
for $100 million to help process and resettle the flood of
emigrants.
   The Justice Department has prepared legislation that would allow
as many as 30,000 people to enter the United States annually if the
president declares it in the best foreign policy interests of the
United States. Unlike refugees, though, these people would not be
given government funding.
   The State Department is conducting an internal review of the
problem in preparation for consultations with Congress on
increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country.
   Meanwhile, more INS officers are being sent to Moscow to help
hasten the processing, said John Moore, director of the Bureau for
Refugee Programs at the State Department.
   Moore told a congressional hearing that the State Department
could not have foreseen the surge of Soviet applicants when it
budgeted last year for this fiscal year. But members of Congress
and Jewish community groups are accusing the administration of
deliberately misleading them.
   ``The administration's refugee program is phony,'' said Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., head of the House subcommittee on foreign
operations. ``This was not unpredictable in light of last year's
growing emigration trends,'' he told Moore.
   Obey accused the administration of presenting deliberately low
predictions in order to stay within the limits of the budget,
knowing it could obtain emergency funding later on to respond to
the humanitarian crisis.
   Jewish groups contend the low figures are part of an
administration attempt to shift the funding for refugee programs
increasingly to private groups.
   Currently, the American Jewish community provides about $2 to $3
for every government dollar spent on refugee admissions and
resettlement and it has launched a $75 million fund-raising
campaign to provide for the flood of emigres.

   A feud is smoldering between two world
institutions based in Washington with billions of dollars to lend
and the power to make deeply indebted countries tighten their belts.
   The disagreement between the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund centers around the division of work between them.
Which should be telling governments to devalue their currencies?
Which should require cuts in government spending? Which should look
at long-term problems? How long is long-term?
   The 151 governments that own the bank and the IMF, which get
together every spring and fall, start meetings in the coming week.
Their ministers of finance and central bankers will have a lot to
say about the debt of Third World countries, now over $1.2
trillion. What the two organizations can do about it depends on
clearing up just what their roles should be, or even whether they
should be merged.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has put out some new ideas on
how to reduce the debt, but critics are saying they may be too
little and too late. Other governments are expected to suggest
doing more.
   Before the meetings open, President Barber Conable of the bank,
a former congressman from New York, and Managing Director Michel
Camdessus of the fund, a Frenchman, are trying to agree on how to
cooperate. The United States and nine other leading governments
have asked Lamberto Dini, the No. 2 at the Italian government's
central bank, to report on improving the relations between the twin
institutions.
   ``If they don't get their act together, there's going to be more
pressure to merge them,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, who heads the
private Institute for International Economics.
   ``That would be a mistake, because they would only have to be
separated again after a few years.''
   Bergsten used to be in charge of U.S. relations with them as
assistant secretary of the Treasury for international affairs.
   Both organizations are linked to the United Nations, but they
have something it lacks: teeth. By giving or holding back loans and
by the conditions they set, they can sometimes make or break
governments.
   Their conditions can lead to violence. Most recently, a
reduction in government subsidies, urged by the fund, brought an
increase in bus fares that touched off riots last month in
Venezuela. At least 300 people were killed.
   Both the World Bank and the IMF were set up at a meeting in
Bretton Woods, N.H., as World War II came to an end. Western
leaders were hoping to nip in the bud the economic problems that
had twice helped to plunge the world into bloody conflict.
   The bank, officially the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, was to help the countries devastated by the war to
recover a decent standard of living. As they did, the bank turned
to the Third World, making easy, long-term loans for schools,
hospitals, farms, roads, ports _ the basic needs of poor countries.
   India and Brazil were among the biggest borrowers.
   The fund's job was to keep currencies stable. Big shifts in
currency values upset world trade, and bad trade relations can lead
to bad political relations. As recently as the 1970s it was helping
Britain and Italy with such problems.
   In time the fund too found itself working mostly in the Third
World, where high values for local currencies wre making trade
difficult. Often the exchange rates were only part of a country's
problem. The fund offered big loans and mobilized more from private
banks. To get the loans, borrowing governments had to promise
changes in their policies _ austerity programs, often including
devaluations, to put the debtors in better shape to keep up with
their debts.
   Billions went to Brazil, Mexico and other major debtors.
   In 1985 James A. Baker III, then secretary of the Treasury, said
the way out of the debt problem was more loans and more policy
changes by the borrowers. The Baker plan called on the bank to map
out longer-term programs for them, since their problems went too
deep to be solved in a few years and the bank was used to taking
the long view. It had always made some ``policy-based'' loans. Now
it started making more.
   So bank and fund, with headquarters facing one another in
downtown Washington, found their jobs overlapping more and more.
They approached problems from different viewpoints.
   Lord Keynes, the British economist who helped set them up, was
quoted as saying that the bank is a fund and the fund is a bank.
Funds are usually concerned with improving people's living
standards; banks worry more about finance. But some of the IMF's
staff of 1,600 have seen the World Bank as a collection of 6,000
soft-minded do-gooders. Many in the bank thought the fund too
preoccupied with the world's financial system and insensitive to
people's needs.
   Neither bank nor fund officials want to be quoted about their
differences, except to say that they try hard to work together. But
some acknowledge privately that they have occasionally given
countries contradictory advice.
   Last October the bank offered $700 million worth of loans to
Argentina. The fund had been negotiating with Argentina for years,
but could not get the government of President Raul Alfonsin to meet
its conditions. The bank's offer raised a lot of eyebrows: in the
past, the bank had waited for the fund's approval of a country's
policies before going ahead with its own lending.
   In February, after disbursing $150 million, the bank decided
Argentina was not meeting its own conditions and refused to
disburse another $350 million.
   There were some quiet ``I-told-you-sos'' from sympathizers with
the fund, but officials said the bank's action showed that the two
institutions were closer to seeing eye-to-eye.

   An improving economy and a surge of federal
relief measures have put easy credit back within reach of farmers,
but an Agriculture Department economist says yielding to temptation
could be hazardous to the financial health of some of them.
   ``Farmers have reasons to be optimistic,'' says Gregory Gajewski
of the department's Economic Research Service. ``The burdensome
grain stocks are dropping and commodity prices are strong in the
face of rising domestic and foreign demand.''
   Gajewski cites rising land values after years of declines ``and
bankers' willingness to lend'' as reflections of farmers' improved
outlook.
   ``But the current optimism is tempered by the knowledge that the
U.S. and foreign farmers still have the capacity to produce large
crops and large volumes of livestock products that could exert
downward pressure on agricultural prices and land values,'' he
added.
   The USDA analyst, writing in the April issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine, said that when the drought hit last summer many
farmers needed more credit to cover expenses and gear up for the
next season.
   ``Bankers are often accused of deserting farmers when times get
tough, but this apparently did not happen during and after the
drought,'' Gajewski said.
   In 1987, Congress provided up to $4 billion to rescue the ailing
Farm Credit System, the national cooperative network of land banks,
production credit associations and other units that serve farmers.
Drought relief last year added an additional $3.9 billion package.
   Huge outlays for government commodity support programs have
pumped billions of dollars into the farm economy, reaching a record
$25.8 billion just three years ago.
   ``When combined with rebounding farmland values, the recent
rescue of the FCS, and other changes in the farm credit delivery
system (including an overhaul of Farmers Home Administration loan
policies), the good news about credit availability raises questions
about how much credit farmers should use,'' Gajewski said.
   Some financial analysts, he said, are concerned that the recent
rise in farmland values may not be supported by future returns. The
boom of the 1970s was followed by a collapse in land values.
   ``During the early and mid-1980s, all of the inflation adjusted
gains to farmers from the 1970s land price runup were lost,''
Gajewski said.
   Agricultural banks in the severe drought areas began 1988 in a
stronger position and made relatively more loans through the
drought's summer peak than banks did in other areas, he said. For
example, loan volume in the drought areas grew by 4.7 percent to 7
percent from the end of 1987 to mid-1988, compared with a 2.9
percent growth at agricultural banks elsewhere.
   More than half of the nation's roughly 4,500 agricultural banks
_ commercial banks that specialize in farm finance _ are located in
counties hit hardest by last year's drought.
   Gajewski said the picture for the Farm Credit System is less
clear. Most of the drought damage was in FCS multi-state districts
having headquarters in St. Paul, Minn.; Louisville, Ky.; and Omaha,
Neb.
   Performing loans _ those without late payments or collateral
problems _ grew in volume by 2.6 percent in the three districts
during the first half of 1988, compared with a 4.7 percent growth
systemwide.
   ``In general, lenders are willing and able to make new loans to
farmers when they believe agricultural prospects look good,'' he
said. ``Lower wheat and (soybean) stocks, and the consequent runup
in commodity prices, have given farmers and their lenders reason
for optimism.''
   A recent survey of a agricultural bankers in the Chicago Federal
Reserve District showed that farmland value rose an average of 11.5
percent in 1988, up a fifth from the depressed level of 1986, he
said. And a Minneapolis Federal Reserve District survey in December
showed cropland values up 5.7 percent from a year earlier.
   ``Farms in both the Chicago and Minneapolis districts were hit
hard by the drought,'' Gajewski said. ``Apparently, the drought did
not markedly weaken the already rebounding land market. In part,
this is because land values reflect expectations about the land's
future earning power, not just current earning power.''
   Another factor in making farm credit cheaper and easier to
deliver is the new Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, or
Farmer Mac, which is a secondary market for agricultural real
estate loans and rural housing.
   Gajewski said Farmer Mac will allow lenders to originate and
service fixed-rate and flexible-rate long-term mortgages without
keeping the loans on their books. By selling mortgages in the
secondary market, lenders will be able to pass on much of the risks
while keeping the origination and servicing fees.
   The Farmer Mac loan sales are ultimately guaranteed by the
federal government, although lenders selling loans will have to
maintain or contribute to a small reserve against future losses, he
said.
   ``Farmer Mac can benefit farmers, but the loan standards it sets
will determine its effectiveness,'' Gajewski said.
   If the standards are too tight, only the lowest-risk loans will
be sold, and the new market will not have much effect. If they're
too loose, lenders will be able to pass high-risk farm loans on to
non-farm investors, with federal backing.
   ``This would encourage farmers to take on more debt, leaving
them more vulnerable to the vicissitudes of weather, the general
economy and international markets,'' he said.

<HEAD>Small Third World Farmers Report Gains from Export Crops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When 448 farm households on the Philippine
island of Mindanao switched to raising sugar for sale to the United
States, their earnings per acre grew to nearly double those of
their neighbors.
   The cash crop brought the equivalent of just over $100 an acre
in a year, compared with about $52 an acre for the corn grown by
neighboring families. These were poor families, with farms that
averaged only about 10 acres. In a country where the average
citizen earns about $660 a year, the difference was huge.
   ``Contrary to conventional wisdom, farmers who produce crops for
export have more income and are better fed than subsistence farmers
who produce only basic food crops for home consumption,'' said the
International Food Policy Research Institute, an independent study
organization.
   The institute project was run by Joachim von Braun, a West
Germam farm economist, with a grant from the U.S. government's
Agency for International Development.
   The study found at least one bad effect from the contracts
offered by the Bukidnon Sugar Co.: some corn farmers sold their
land or gave up leases and took jobs on sugar farms, creating a new
group of landless farm workers.
   Von Braun suggested that the Philippine government should have
gotten the mill to make contracts for sugar with the tenant
farmers, as well as with those who owned land. The government could
also have taken measures to improve the production of small farms
that stayed with growing corn, making credit, fertilizer and new
varieties available, he said.
   Contrary to some people's belief, the researchers saw no damage
to child health _ but little improvement either _ from the change
to cash crops.
   While better income from the sugar provided more food for the
family, it did little to solve the problem of badly nourished
children. Better health and sanitation measures are needed as well,
the report said.
   Von Braun said that as farmers' income rose, the proportion they
spent on traditional foods went down. Spending on meat, housing,
transport and education rose sharply among the most prosperous
farmers in the Philippine group.
   Von Braun studied farmers not only in the Philippines, but also
in the east African republic of Kenya who made a similar switch,
and Guatemalans who tried vegetables instead of corn.
   There were also groups in two more African countries who
switched to farming for the market rather than for home
consumption. In central African Rwanda they planted potatoes and
tea instead of corn. In Gambia, on the Atlantic coast, the shift
was from swamp rice to peanuts and to rice under irrigation.
   The researchers found that when small farmers switched to cash
crops, they often kept some of their land in traditional food crops
as a kind of insurance.
   The study said that makes sense, because the income from cash
crops is not always certain. Sugar prices have dropped from the
levels that first made the switch attractive in the Philippines,
for example.

   Actress Kristy McNichol refused to continue
working on the movie ``Just the Way You Are'' in 1982 and rumors
flew that she was a drug addict, an alcoholic or a manic depressive.
   She denies the rumors, telling this week's People magazine that
it was an emotional breakdown that caused her to leave the set.
   ``I was totally out of control,'' said McNichol, 26. ``I wanted
to please everybody all the time. ... I was making my mom happy.
And then I found out later that wasn't making me happy,'' she said.
A friend took her to a psychiatrist who advised her not to go on
with the movie, her eighth in six years. She finished the movie a
year later.
   Once a star on the TV series ``Family,'' McNichol is back in
prime time starring in NBC's ``Empty Nest.''
   She said she finally is in control of her life. ``Now I feel
like I'm this mountain of strength,'' she said. ``Now I think,
`This is the time for me.'''

   Keith Whitley says he doesn't remember
when he wanted to be anything but a country singer.
   ``I grew up listening to my mother's collection of Hank
Williams, George Jones and Marty Robbins records,'' said the
Sandyhook, Ky., native.
   Whitley was 13 when he met another aspiring Kentucky bluegrass
musician, Ricky Skaggs, at a fiddlers' convention in Ezell, Ky.
Skaggs joined Whitley's band, the East Kentucky Mountain Boys.
   ``I laid my country music aside for quite a while ... because
bluegrass audiences didn't care to hear it. But it just kept
haunting me,'' Whitley said.
   Whitley in 1972 formed the New Tradition, later known as the
Country Store. In 1978, he teamed with J.D. Crowe and the New South.
   Whitley's hit list includes ``Don't Close Your Eyes,''
``Homecoming '63,'' ``Ten Feet Away,'' and ``I'm No Stranger to the

   Hope for a wetter summer is blossoming in the
wake of recent coastal rains, but drought continues in several
sections of the nation.
   Wheat-growing areas of Kansas and adjacent Texas and Oklahoma
remain particularly dry, and area legislators have already begun to
complain about lack of concern in Washington.
   In the Northeast, meanwhile, a dry winter left reservoirs low,
threatening water supplies in parts of New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and other parts of the Delaware River basin.
   New York Mayor Edward Koch declared a drought emergency and
imposed strict water-use limits last week, citing low reservoir
levels that have not been replenished by winter snowfalls, though
recent rains may help some.
   Recalling low river flows that restricted shipping in the
nation's midsection last year, the navigation season on the
Missouri River is being shortened by five weeks to allow water to
be held in reserve at reservoirs, which are only about 60 percent
full.
   David Miskus of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's Climate Analysis Center reports that storms along
the Gulf and East coasts have helped ease the dryness there
somewhat in recent days, and more moisture is expected in the
Pacific Coast states.
   Incoming storms could also bring some needed moisture to the
middle of the nation this week, Miskus said.
   The long-term outlook through mid-April calls for above normal
precipitation in the Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes and the
Northeast.
   But that projection also indicates below normal rain in Georgia,
Florida and adjacent states and in a large area including Wyoming,
South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico and northern
Texas and Oklahoma. Some of those areas are badly in need of
moisture.
   Over the winter, fierce winds eroded nearly 4.7 million acres of
land in the Great Plains, one of the most extensive losses on
record, according to an Agriculture Department survey.
   ``Much of this damage is due to the drought,'' said Wilson
Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation Service. ``We
went into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of the
Great Plains because of the drought. Then this winter, we've had a
combination of no snow cover and high-velocity winds in many
areas.''
   In addition to the land damaged during the four-month period,
Scaling said more than 22.5 million acres were ``in condition to
blow'' as of March 1, the most in 32 years. Highest on the list are
Kansas, North Dakota and Texas, he said.
   Farm state lawmakers, meanwhile, say the Department of
Agriculture is mishandling last year's emergency drought relief and
ignoring this year's arid, potentially disastrous conditions on the
High Plains.
   Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said the central part of the country
is ``blowing away'' but help is not forthcoming from Washington
because of the Bush administration's slow pace in filling key
policy jobs at USDA.
   As of Feb. 28, more than 558,000 producers have received
disaster payments and emergency feed assistance amounting to more
than $2.7 billion, responded Milton Hertz of the Agriculture
Department.
   On the other hand, along a wide belt from Texas to Kentucky,
moisture has been excessive in recent months, said Agriculture
Department meteorologist Doug LeComte.
   Despite some flooding, that moisture was badly needed in a
region that has suffered drought for several years, LeComte said.
   He said the northern plains are in much better shape than last
year, with snow and rain providing beneficial wetness for Montana,
the Dakotas and the Great Lakes region this winter _ although some
subsoils remain dry.
   Good snow and rains have also wetted down the Ohio Valley and
western portions of the corn belt, said LeComte. ``The main spring
planting areas were off to a pretty good start.''
   California, especially Southern California, remains dry, said
LeComte.
   He said moisture also remains a problem for the Pacific
Northwest. Things are looking better, but the area still has a lot
of rain to make up following three dry winters.
   Miskus reports that despite recent improvements, Southern
California received less than half of the normal amount of rainfall
between Dec. 1 and March 18.
   Other regions with less than half of normal wetness for the
winter include most of New England and eastern New York state;
parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the Gulf Coast, southern
Florida, northern Florida and parts of Georgia and South Carolina;
northern Missouri; southern Arizona and New Mexico; most of Kansas
and parts of north Texas, northern New Mexico and western Oklahoma.

<HEAD>EPA Defends `Voluntary' Approach to Ozone-Damaging Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says the
hunt to find substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals will go much
quicker without strict government regulation of the chemical
industry.
   EPA spokesman Chris Rice said the agency's policy is voluntary
cooperation _ instead of strong government control _ because EPA
has received ``excellent cooperation'' from the industry.
   Rice was reacting to a recent General Accounting Office report
that concluded the EPA's policy is failing to ensure the safe
testing of chemicals that will take the place of
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's.
   By not starting the lengthy regulation process now, EPA will
find itself unable to quickly restrict use of many substitutes
shown to endanger human health and the environment, the GAO said.
   The GAO, Congress' investigative agency, said EPA should use its
powers to demand unpublished test results and quickly slap controls
on substitutes believed to endanger the environment or humans.
   The United States and the 12-nation European Community have
pledged to ban chlorofluorocarbons by 1999 _ surpassing the goals
of the 1987 Montreal Protocol which requires they be halved by the
end of the century.
   CFC's, and related chemicals called halons, are stable and
non-toxic when released into the atmosphere, but 10 to 100 years
later, when they rise 15-20 miles to the stratosphere, their
chemical bonds are broken apart.
   Scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing more
of the sun's ultraviolet rays to reach Earth, causing more skin
cancer and eye cataracts, and suppressing human immune systems.
   The recent General Accounting Office report called the decision
to rely on voluntary cooperation a course that would allow eventual
production of CFC alternatives ``by anyone, in any amount, and for
any use, without prior notification ... or an EPA safety review.''
   But the EPA's Rice countered, ``We feel using that cooperative
relationship is going to obtain the information we need on a much
quicker track.
   ``We have very great concern over toxicity testing'' Rice said,
adding that EPA has ``not ruled out'' using its full authority to
regulate the industry ``if we're not getting the cooperation we
need.''
   ``It's a question of how you do it as quickly as possible while
everyone is clamoring for new compounds as quickly as possible,''
said Kevin Fay, of the Alliance For Responsible CFC Policy,
representing CFC producers and users.
   ``The concern is you've got some policy makers in Congress
saying we've got to go faster, and you have regulatory structures
that would slow it down,'' he said, comparing the dilemma to
sitting at an intersection with both red and green lights.
   The Toxic Substances Control Act allows EPA not only to demand
industry's test results, but to order advance notice from any
company planning to convert chemicals designed for other use into
CFC substitutes.
   ``Given the importance of the safety issue, we believe that
EPA's approach to assessing the safety of CFC ... chemical
substitutes should include the use of (the) two TSCA authorities,''
the GAO said in a report requested by the chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, John D. Dingell, D-Mich.
   The GAO said dependence on voluntary cooperation is a mistake
because, ``EPA's previous attempt to gather testing information''
from CFC producers in December 1987 ``resulted in incomplete data.''
   By ordering the test results, EPA officials could determine if a
chemical presented ``an unreasonable health or environmental risk''
and if so, could require testing to determine the specific risks.
   If necessary, the agency could take actions ranging from
labeling requirements to a complete ban.
   Advance notice of new uses for chemicals would let EPA ``review
the safety of these new uses and quickly control'' any substances
posing a danger.
   If EPA determined the information was inadequate to ensure the
safety of the new use, the agency could require more testing and
prevent the new use while data is gathered.
   CFC's are used as coolants in refrigerators and freezers in
home, office and automobile air conditioners; propellants in
aerosols; blowing agents for plastic foam products and insulation;
cleaning agents for metals and electronic equipment; fast-food
cartons, and sterilizing agents for medical instruments.
   Related chemicals, halons are used in fire extinguishers where
foam or water treatment would not work: ships, planes, military
vehicles, computer facilities, telephone switching centers and
libraries.
   Substitutes for CFC's will be tested for at least two more years
before commercial production could begin, Fay said. No substitutes
have yet been found for halons.

<DATELINE>MUGLAD, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starvation and disease, abduction and
slavery are some of the atrocities that six years of civil war have
inflicted on millions of people of southern Sudan.
   Consider Akwa Karfath Kawal, a woman of African descent who fled
hunger in her hometown of Aweil and ended up in a squalid refugee
area just outside Muglad in western Sudan.
   Armed Arabs abducted her five sons en route, she says, forcing
them into slavery as cattle herders.
   Another woman, Miriyal Mayowin, lost two toddlers to starvation
and one to the Arabs during the trek out of the south.
   ``There is nothing in Aweil but destruction and we were hungry,
so we left,'' she said. ``We ate shrubs as we walked ... but there
was no water.
   ``So many died.''
   More than 12,000 refugees in this maze of huts made of sticks
and plastic sheets tell similar tales.
   Dressed in rags, these Dinka tribesmen and their brethren in
other camps have been changed by the war from cultivators and
cattle breeders to paupers dependent on relief.
   The Dinka, largest of Sudan's 115 tribes, form the backbone of
the rebel army. They are Christians and animists.
   Rebels began fighting in 1983 for more autonomy from the
government, which is dominated by the Moslem Arab majority in the
north.
   On Sunday, a new broad-based Cabinet met for the first time in
Khartoum and endorsed a peace plan to end the war.
   And in April, the world will try to assuage the suffering of
Sudan's people with an ambitious emergency relief program
coordinated by the United Nations.
   Relief workers for both Western donor governments and private
organizations say the $132 million program will save the lives of
some of the hundreds of thousands of southern Sudanese who face
starvation.
   But they say the outside world has neglected the war and its
ruin for so long that a logistical nightmare will further
complicate the already precarious security situation. They doubt
the logjams can be sufficiently overcome to prevent another
disaster like last summer, when at least 250,000 people died after
monsoon rains isolated them without food.
   Everyone agrees the need is real and urgent, even the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army. Though the rebels have refused a
call by the United Nations for a one-month truce to let the food
pass, they have pledged not to attack supply convoys in certain
protected corridors.
   The plan is to stockpile 100,000 tons of food, medicine and
other supplies in places accessible to 2.25 million southerners in
both government and rebel-held areas. The supplies are to be in
place before the rainy season starts in May and paralyzes
transportation.
   ``It's an enormous quantity and a short period of time,'' said
one relief worker. ``Above all, this is Sudan.''
   Relief and government officials agreed to the plan for bringing
in supplies by train, plane, Nile River barge and truck convoy. The
government also promised to undo complicated bureaucratic
procedures for the relief organizations.
   For their part, Western relief workers offer endless stories
about bureaucratic inefficiency, generally on condition they not be
identified.
   A British-based organization says it had to wait a year before
four jeeps were cleared through Sudanese customs.
   A Dutch diplomat says he tried to transfer $4 million in aid to
the emergency operation. He was handed forms to fill out and told
that the transfer would probably take weeks.
   Much of the food must be transported to government-held southern
areas on Nile barges or trains. However, the barges and trains have
made no more than one trip in the past year because of security
problems and nervous railway workers.
   The government says of Sudan's 22 million people, 4 million are
southerners. It says half have been displaced by the war to camps
in Ethiopia or northern Sudan, and half still need relief in the
south.
   Southerners, however, claim they are 6 million.
   Western relief workers suspect that the discrepancy _ 2 million
people _ represents the number who died as a result of the war.

<HEAD>U.S. Economy Faces Trouble Without Trade Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improvements in the U.S. trade deficit will
stall out next year without major policy changes on the part of the
Bush administration, posing grave economic dangers for America, a
research institute warned today.
   The Institute for International Economics issued a report
forecasting that America's trade deficit will begin rising again in
1990 and will hit $150 billion by 1992, very near the all-time
record imbalance of $154 billion set in 1987.
   The projections are based on the current account, the broadest
measure of U.S. trade. It includes not only trade in merchandise
but also trade in services, primarily investment flows between
countries.
   In 1988, the current account deficit narrowed to $135 billion,
reflecting a surge in U.S. merchandise exports. The current
account, also known as the country's balance of payments, shows how
much foreign investment will be needed to finance America's trade
deficit.
   Unless something is done to jump-start America's stalled trade
improvement, the United States, already the world's largest debtor
country, will see that debt top $1 trillion by 1992, the report
predicted.
   The U.S. net debtor status means that American assets have been
traded to foreigners to pay for imported items such as cars and
television sets. Because of this, foreigners now own more U.S.
investments than Americans hold overseas.
   William Cline, a senior fellow at the institute and the author
of the report, blamed the worsening trade picture on continuing
high domestic demand in the United States, which attracts imports
and deflects American production away from export markets.
   To correct the situation, Cline said it is essential that the
Bush administration reach agreement with Congress on a credible
program to meet the targets in the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
law. The law calls for the deficit to be cut by $40 billion
annually until the budget is in balance by 1993.
   Cline said the Bush administration also needs to abandon the
exchange rate policy America has been pursuing since February 1987,
which has aimed at stabilizing the value of the dollar.
   Instead, he said, the new administration needs to convince its
major trading partners, in particular Japan and West Germany, that
further devaluation of the dollar is needed to boost America's
competitiveness by making U.S. exports cheaper on overseas markets.
   Cline said the dollar needs to drop by 25 percent in value
against the Japanese yen and by 20 percent in value against the
West German mark.
   Such actions would put the trade deficit back on a declining
path, reducing it to an annual rate of around $50 billion by 1992.
   Cline said trying to eliminate the entire trade deficit is not
really feasible.
   ``To go all the way to a zero trade deficit would meet very
stiff resistance'' from U.S. trading partners, Cline said in an
interview. ``I think it will be a major challenge just to get it
down from $150 billion to $50 billion annually.''
   Cline warns, as have other economists, that higher and higher
levels of U.S. foreign debt will ultimately lower America's living
standard as more and more resources are transferred to foreigners
to pay interest payments on the debt.
   Such high levels of foreign borrowing also leave the U.S.
economy vulnerable to foreign investors, who could suddenly decide
they no longer want to hold U.S. investments, the study said.
   The growing debt burdens run the risk of a ``collapse of
confidence in the dollar, triggering a further surge of inflation
and interest rates _ and possibly a recession,'' the report said.
``At a minimum, they would weaken America's future growth by
requiring persistently high U.S. interest rates to attract the
needed foreign funds.''
   The Cline study was based on computer models which simulated
global trade flows based on various economic scenarios.
   Among the report's conclusions:
   _Every percentage point boost in growth in the economies of
America's major trading partners will result in a decline of $9
billion to $13 billion in the U.S. current account deficit by 1992.
   _Every percentage point drop in the dollar's exchange value
against other currencies produces a trade improvement of between $8
billion and $10 billion by 1992 as U.S. goods are made more
competitive on overseas markets.
   _Each percentage point drop in America's economic growth rate
produces $15 billion in improvements in the deficit by lowering the
demand for imports.
   Cline's study argues that major reductions in the federal budget
deficit would dampen the growth of domestic demand, thus cutting
America's appetite for foreign goods.
   The study said that if the Bush administration and Congress act
quickly to implement the budget cuts, it will allow the necessary
shift from a consumption-driven economy to an export-driven economy
without a recession.
   The institute is a non-profit research organization which
analyzes international economic issues.

<HEAD>Paraguan Opposition Party Picks Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH LOVE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's chief opposition leader
was picked at a weekend convention to run for president in May 1
elections, but his party vowed to boycott a new government in the
event of election fraud.
   Domingo Laino, head of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party,
accepted his party's nomination Sunday night and vowed in his
speech to defend Paraguay's peasants and adopt economic policies to
meet their needs.
   ``We will work with the clean hands and moral strength of the
people,'' said Laino, 53, an economist and former university
professor. He was exiled for seven years by the recently deposed
government of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   Laino was expelled by Stroessner's government in 1981 after
writing a book about the business activities of Nicaraguan dictator
Anastasio Somoza. The Nicaraguan, a friend of Stroessner, was
granted asylum in Paraguay after his ouster in 1979. He was
assassinated a year later on an Asuncion street.
   ``Who is to say that on May 1, there will not be a new
government composed of the glorious Authentic Radical Liberal
Party?'' said Laino. He was the only candidate proposed for the
presidency at the convention.
   Laino was carried from the convention hall on the shoulders of
supporters following his acceptance speech. Delegates also approved
candidates for the House of Deputies and Senate.
   The May 1 elections will pick a president to fill the four years
remaining in the five-year term of Stroessner, who was ousted Feb.
3 by Gen. Andres Rodriguez. The coup leader, who had served as an
aide to Stroessner, declared himself provisional president,
dissolved Congress, and called for new elections.
   The Colorado Party, the country's largest and best-organized
party, has governed since 1947. It is expected to ratify Rodriguez
as its presidential candidate at a convention set for April 1.
   ``We know that many sectors of the government harbor hidden
intentions of legitimizing the current de facto government,'' said
Laino, a member of the House of Deputies from 1967 to 1977.
   In recent weeks, the party has repeatedly criticized what it
views as irregularities in voter registration, and it has suggested
the Rodriguez government might be trying to steal the election.
   Stroessner, who had led Paraguay since a 1954 coup, was elected
to an eighth consecutive term in February 1988 elections widely
regarded as fraudulent.
   A plan adopted by Laino's party calls for rejecting any seats
won in Congress if it deems the May 1 balloting to be fraudulent.
   Even if the elections are viewed as fair, the party still would
withdraw from Congress if electoral law reforms and changes in
voter registration lists are not made before municipal elections
scheduled for October 1990. The party claims voter lists are
inflated in favor of the Colorado Party.
   It also conditioned its participation in Congress on revocation
of a law which allows a president to serve an unlimited number of
terms. It also demands repeal of two laws frequently used under
Stroessner to crack down on dissidents and a ban on soldiers
belonging to political parties.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer games,
three-dimensional maps and nature trails are being developed to
help visitors understand how last year's forest fires were actually
useful.
   Space-age techniques went into the production of some of the
interpretive projects, which were considered nine months ago when
fires began consuming what would eventually consume nearly half of
the 2.2 million-acre park.
   ``Around the first of July we began to realize that we were not
only confronted with an incredible history-making event in terms of
fire suppression, but with a virtually unprecedented educational
opportunity as well,'' said George Robinson, Yellowstone's chief
naturalist.
   Forestry officials say the fires prompt rebirth in the
wilderness, clearing away the old, dead and overgrown while making
way for new vegetation and new wildlife habitats.
   Robinson worked with the National Park Service's Harpers Ferry,
W.Va., creative design center to develop exhibits and signs that
will be located along Yellowstone's roads.
   The projects were conceived ``as ways of helping people ... to
better understand what happened in the summer of 1988,'' he said.
   Among them is an exhibit at Grant Village, which was surrounded
on three sides by flames from the Snake Complex of fires and on the
fourth by Yellowstone Lake.
   ``It will be about a $250,000 exhibit on fire and fire
ecology,'' he said, adding it could be installed by June. He said
it will include a video of the 1988 fire season.
   Also planned at the visitor center is a computer-enhanced map of
Yellowstone that is being developed with the help of NASA
technicians. The map will give an eagle's eye view of the park.
   The map may be seen through a touch-sensitive screen on a video
monitor, Robinson said. ``Simply touch and fly north to south on a
simulated overflight and actually see with computer-generated
graphics what the area might have looked like on a given day during
the summer of 1988,'' he said.
   The development of a computer game will enable people to change
various factors to affect the fires.
   ``What if we had rain, in adequate quantities, in June, July and
August?'' Robinson asked, explaining the concept. ``What if we had
not had the high winds, unprecedented winds? What if, what if and
what if. So that a computer user could in effect change history,
but also duplicate the actual events of the summer.''
   Some of the more traditional projects include nature trails that
would wind through burned, and unburned, sections of Yellowstone;
three one-way roads to lead motorists through burned and unburned
areas; a movie on the fires; and a large pamphlet that would show a
burned lodgepole pine forest with the animal life expected to be
seen in the area after the fires.
   The pamphlet will not be specific to Yellowstone, but also will
show the effects of fire on the Alaskan tundra, the Florida
Everglades, and the sequoia forests in California.
   ``There will be included, as a matter-of-fact, computer images
of fires that were burning throughout the world during the same
time,'' he said. ``A multimillion-acre fire in China that was not
even known about until very late in the year because the Chinese
and Russians didn't make a big event out of it. ...
   ``There were fires burning in the Amazon basin and in Africa
that were started by man that dwarfed in magnitude the fires that
burned in Yellowstone.''
   Robinson said he hopes the project in its entirety will be
instructive ``to the role of fire as an element in our lives and
the lives of the forest.''

<HEAD>Agreement Designed to Safeguard Government Computer Files</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new agreement between the National Security
Agency and a research arm of the Commerce Department aims to
bolster their joint efforts to safeguard sensitive information
handled by thousands of federal government computer systems.
   The memorandum of understanding was signed late last week by the
NSA's director, Vice Adm. W.O. Studeman, and Raymond G. Kammer,
acting director of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
   Under prodding from Congress, the two agencies have started
working closely together to review computer security plans
submitted by offices throughout the government for protecting
systems containing sensitive but unclassified data.
   The effort has been spurred by mounting concern over so-called
computer viruses, including a virus ``attack'' last November that
crippled more than 6,000 computers connected to the Defense
Department's Internet electronic network.
   NIST, based in suburban Gaithersburg, Md., serves as a national
reference and measurement laboratory for the physical and
engineering sciences. It performs a wide range of research intended
to benefit U.S. industry.
   The supersecret NSA, headquartered at Fort Meade, Md., is the
nation's biggest intelligence agency, with a work force topping
60,000 employees _ more than all other U.S. spy agencies combined _
and a budget said to be upwards of $10 billion a year.
   Its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around the
world, encrypting U.S. communications and cracking foreign codes,
as well as protecting the security of U.S. computers and
communications systems.
   Kammer said Friday that the agreement ``provides a structure for
discussions between NSA and us if there are issues that arise where
there is a conflict between a classified or national security issue
and regular civilian data issues. By and large, it's a commitment
by us to work together.''
   He noted that the NSA's current position toward cooperating with
NIST _ under legislation signed into law early last year _
contrasted with the intelligence agency's previous attitude.
   ``We went through a bad spot about a year ago,'' Kammer said.
``There was a feeling by the then-management of NSA that the
Computer Security Act was a problem, something that they opposed.
... The management team that's in there now has taken the
philosophy that it's the law of the land, let's get it done. That's
been a big and refreshing change.''
   Kammer told a congressional hearing last week that as of March
13, the joint NIST-NSA review team had received 1,543 computer
security plans _ 74 from the Pentagon and the remainder from
civilian agencies.
   The General Accounting Office said last September that federal
agencies at that time had identified 53,443 computer systems _ an
estimated 52,000 of them within the Defense Department _ containing
sensitive data.
   Testifying before two House Science subcommittees, Kammer said
NIST had been working with the Justice Department and NSA to
establish an ``emergency response capability'' to deal with
``malicious software attacks'' such as computer viruses.
   Viruses are generally small strings of computer code that can be
stealthily inserted into software programs _ and spread widely
through electronic networks _ to cause computers to malfunction by
clogging memory, destroying or altering data, or other actions.
   ``For the current fiscal year I have redirected $200,000 to
start up an effort to coordinate responses to computer security
incidents and to create an information clearinghouse,'' Kammer said.
   Appearing at the same hearing, the NSA's Studeman said the
Pentagon has ordered his agency to ``pursue intensive research and
development with the objective of identifying means to counter
computer viruses.''
   ``Today there are no known solutions that can guarantee
protection of a system against malicious software,'' he said.
   But Studeman added that ``we believe strongly that the proper
use of trusted products, coupled with sound system security
management and increased funding and emphasis in the area of
research and development, offers the best hope for preventing,
detecting and containing such attacks.''
   Provisions of the four-page memorandum of understanding include:
   _NIST will draw upon computer technical security guidelines
developed by the NSA.
   _NIST will request the NSA's assistance on all matters related
to cryptographic techniques.
   _NSA will carry out research and development programs in
``trusted technology,'' telecommunications security, encryption
techniques and personal identification methods.
   _NSA will ``conduct assessments of the hostile intelligence
threat to federal information systems, and provide technical
assistance and recommend endorsed products for application to
secure systems against that threat.''
   _NIST and NSA will jointly review agency plans for the security
and privacy of computer systems.
   _NIST and NSA will ``maintain an ongoing, open dialogue'' to
ensure that each organization remains abreast of emerging
technologies and issues affecting the security automated
information systems.

   A Canada goose seems to have fallen hard
for a Shetland pony _ a true wild goose chase, says a stable hand.
   Mike Gottsch, who was working at the Jump Over the Moon Training
Center during spring break from college, said the goose flew onto
the ranch about a month ago and soon began following the pony
through pastures. It even ate corn from the pony's trough.
   ``He just got attached to him and won't leave him alone,''
Gottsch said.
   Sometimes the goose honks, hisses and bites the pony, said Stan
Miller, who boards several horses at the stables. But the bird also
will tag along from pen to pen and sometimes rides on the animal's
back.
   A silver identifying band often used by wildlife authorities is
attached to the bird's right leg. Gottsch said no one has contacted
officials about the goose.
   The unusual relationship has raised some eyebrows.
   ``People, they can't believe it,'' Gottsch said. ``They think
it's a domestic we've raised or something.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II decried religious
oppression in his Easter message and Christian leaders worldwide
groped for meaning in this world where, as one put it, ``the worst
often does happen.''
   In Czechoslovakia on Sunday, Christians called for the pope to
visit their communist nation. In some parts of the Soviet Union,
people heard Masses for the first time in years.
   Elsewhere Sunday, shells and rockets pounded Beirut as Lebanese
Christians commemorated Easter. In Afghanistan, about 30 members of
the dwindling Western community gathered for services.
   About 180,000 faithful crowded the Vatican's St. Peter's Square
for the pope's message commemorating the resurrection of Jesus
Christ.
   In his 20-minute speech in Italian, the pope lamented religious
persecution, exploitation of women, degeneration of family life,
sectarian strife and lack of concern for the environment.
   Earlier Sunday, the pope, squinting in the warm spring sun, held
a Mass on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica.
   Calling Easter the new Passover, a reference to the Old
Testament account of the miraculous rescue of the Jews in Egypt,
the pope said: ``God passes where there do not exist conditions
worthy of a truly human life, through lack of housing, promiscuity,
vagrancy, where selfishness withers the fruitfulness of marriage
and the family breaks up.''
   He also decried violence against children and the ``shameful
commerce of vice...(where) women are still the main victim.''
   The pope devoted much of his message, broadcast to 50 countries,
to places ``where consciences are oppressed, where Christ's
faithful cannot openly invoke him or suffer persecution because of
their love of him.''
   He said Easter proclaims a needed truth ``to today's world,
which in so many ways seems to be rushing headlong towards
self-destruction and death.''
   In Jerusalem, Patriarch Michel Sabah issued an Easter plea for
peace and blamed politicians for the violence in the Holy Land.
   ``We find the reality of the Holy Land, a reality of death and
suffering,'' Sabah, the first Palestinian to serve as Roman
Catholic patriarch of the city, told pilgrims at Easter Mass in the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
   ``We find those who tell us each day: We are hungry, we are
humiliated, we are prisoners, we have no schooling,'' he said. ``We
find those who have died and those who have yet to die while the
politicians take their time finding answers.''
   Sabah alluded to the searing conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians during a Mass intoned in Latin, French and Arabic on
the site where Christians believe Jesus was resurrected.
   Sabah, named bishop in January 1987, never directly mentioned
the 15-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   But his mention of the ``two peoples in this Holy Land'' and his
repeated references to death clearly evoked the revolt in which
more than 400 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed.
   In the Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latvia, many
Christians celebrated the Easter Mass for the first time in years.
Last year, Moscow handed back confiscated cathedrals to many
communities after decades in government hands.
   In Czechoslovakia, about 400 people gathered beneath the balcony
of 89-year-old Roman Catholic Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek's Baroque
residence shouting, ``Long Live Our Father!'' and ``We Want the
Holy Father!'' in a call for the Polish-born pontiff to visit
Prague.
   Czechoslovakia is the only Soviet bloc country where Communist
authorities have for decades blocked the appointment of religious
leaders.
   In Britain, Archbishop Robert Runcie, head of the Church of
England and the world's leading Anglican, told a congregation at
Canterbury Cathedral: ``We live in a world in which the worst looks
as if it is going to happen and the worst often does happen, and
yet out of the anguish and waste, love and trust come in new
forms.''
   ``A sober look at the world seems to raise more fear than
hope,'' Runcie told the congregation at Canterbury Cathedral.

<HEAD>English Text of John Paul II's Easter Message</HEAD>
<UNK>With PM-World Easter</UNK>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are excerpts from the official
Vatican translation in English of Pope John Paul II's Easter Sunday
message, which was delivered in Italian:
   In this Passover is inscribed the new and eternal covenant. The
covenant of the God of Life with man, condemned to death. The
covenant with humanity. The covenant with the world. With ``the
world which is the theater of the history of the human race.'' With
the world which Christians believe was created and is kept in
existence by the love of the Creator. With the world subject to the
slavery of sin but which _ with defeat of the Evil One _ by the
disobedience of Christ even unto death has been set free.
   In Christ crucified and risen this liberation remains in God for
all human beings. In Christ crucified and risen the world has been
restored to God so that it may be fashioned anew according to God's
design and reach that fullfillment willed by God from all eternity.
...
   Over these tragedies and triumphs of today's world, of the man
of today, God continues to pass through the Resurrection of his
Son, the Son of Man. He passes and sets free, as at the time of the
Exodus, as at the moment when Christ rises, and transforms the
world.
   God passes and frees from the fear that oppresses so many of our
brothers and sisters in the face of the uncertainty of the future,
everywhere in the world, he passes where death expresses once more
its horrors, where suffering imprints its marks on flesh and on
souls, he passes where there do not exist conditions worthy of a
truly human life through the lack of housing, promiscuity,
vagrancy, where selfishness withers the fruitfulness of marriage
and the family breaks up, where the innocence of children is
exploited and corrupted, where violence is done to their
defenseless goodness, where the shameful commerce of vice is
carried on and women are still its main victim.
   God passes and sets free, the Passover of the Resurrection, from
the perils of intolerance whatever name it bears where the
proclamation of Easter has not reached or is hindered, where
consciences are oppressed, where Christ's faithful cannot openly
invoke him or suffers persecution because of the love of him and
his Church and because of their faithfulness to their rites and
their own age-old religious traditions. He passes in the countries
where Christians cannot gather about the altars to celebrate the
Eucharist where the flock waits for its own pastor, whose guidance
it misses and longs for.
   For religious freedom, though it is deeply felt by consciences
and is written in the constitutions of states and in international
conventions, is often today trampled upon in many different ways.
God likewise passes where on the troubled and bloodstained horizon
of various countries the longed-for peace is yet to be seen where
men, though they are brothers, fight one another in a scene of
destruction and hatred as is still happening in the beloved and
tormented Lebanon. ...
   In his blood all is reconciled: man with God, with himself, with
nature: at this point there gains new strength and awareness.
...This is the truth which Easter proclaims to today's world which
in so many ways seems to be rushing headlong toward
self-destruction and death ...
   Easter, the Passover of the Lord, lasts unchangeably. It cannot
be blotted out, either in the history of the human race or in the
history of the whole creation. It lasts unchangeably. Christ's
Resurrection has not been ``added'' to history. It is the history _
the whole history _ of man, which is inscribed in this unique day
which the Lord has made so that he can make all things new.

   A Bush administration official says new
regulations may be created to help block the export of chemicals
and equipment for making poison gas weapons to developing nations.
   Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said the State and Commerce departments are working
with the Central Intelligence Agency on a policy review.
   ``We're reviewing the strengthening of controls,'' Freedenberg
said Sunday. ``Most likely we won't need legislation, we just need
further regulation. And more importantly, I think it's likely that
we'll be looking for international cooperation.''
   Freedenberg said the United States and 16 other industrialized
nations have pledged to prevent the export of critical poison-gas
chemicals and manufacturing equipment to four ``problem countries''
_ Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria.

   The Internal Revenue Service has a new
question for you: How long does it take to complete IRS tax forms?
   The IRS spent five years and $1.9 million study to figure out
that the average taxpayer should be able to fill out Form 1040, the
dreaded individual income tax return, in exactly 3 hours and 7
minutes.
   This year, for the first time, IRS instructions for more than
350 tax forms includes an estimate of how long it takes to complete
each one. The notices also include the name and address of an
official to contact if someone wants to complain about a form or
dispute a time estimate.
   The idea is that if enough people complain, bureaucrats will
feel pressured to simplify the forms _ or perhaps to shorten some
or eliminate them altogether _ in the interest of easing the burden
of government paperwork.

   The Democrat Party narrowed its spending gap
with Republicans in the 1987-88 election cycle, but figures show
the GOP still raised and spent more than double the Democrats.
   The Federal Election Commission reported Sunday that the
Republican Party raised $263.3 million and spent $257 million in
1987-88, compared to $127.9 million raised and $121.9 million spent
by the Democratic Party.
   By contrast, when President Reagan ran for re-election in
1983-84, the Republicans raised a record $297.9 million and spent
$300.8 million, while the Democrats raised $98.5 million and spent
$97.4 million.
   During the most recent election cycle, direct contributions to
candidates totalled $3.4 million for the Republicans and $1.7
million for the Democrats, the FEC said.

   A man underwent a successful kidney
transplant after he was plucked by helicopter from a remote
campsite and taken to a hospital for the organ that matched his
rare blood type, officials said.
   Charles Ridgeway, 47, was listed in critical but stable
condition late Sunday, according to officials at Western Medical
Center in Santa Ana.
   ``Everything went just great. His kidney is already showing
early signs of function,'' Dr. Garo Tertzakian said after he
performed the two-hour surgery earlier in the day.
   Ridgeway was camping with his wife and daughter in Imperial
County near the Mexican border when doctors found a kidney donor
whose blood type was B-positive, shared by only about 15 percent of
the population.
   Time was of the essence because organ must be transplanted
within a certain time. The organ was located Saturday night and the
nine-hour search began.
   ``Charles Ridgeway decided that he was going to go to the end of
the Earth,'' said Los Angeles-based KNX-AM radio pilot Bob Tur, who
found Ridgeway after flying through a rainstorm and serendipitously
picking up Ridgeway's son, Matt, who also was looking for his
father.
   The older Ridgeway, an accounting manager at Rockwell
International in Anaheim, carried an electronic pager linking him
to the hospital but his camping trip took him out of its range.
   Matt Ridgeway had driven about 100 mph to the area where he
thought his father might be.
   Tur, who volunteered after he heard of Ridgeway's plight, lifted
off at 1 a.m. Sunday from Santa Monica Airport with his friend Jim
King as co-pilot. They picked up two Orange County Search and
Rescue team members along the way.
   ``We were told if we don't find them by 4 a.m., forget it,'' Tur
said. He said doctors explained the kidney would not be fresh
enough to transplant if Ridgeway could not be found and dialysis
preparation started by 5 a.m., and Tur figured the trip to the
hospital would take about an hour.
   The search for Ridgeway's white motor home with two all-terrain
vehicles was not easy.
   ``Not only are there a thousand people in campers, but they're
all white, they all have ATV's,'' Tur said. ``We were yelling over
the P.A., `Charles Ridgeway, we have a kidney. Identify yourself or
notify the Orange County Sheriff's Department.'''
   They eventually saw a flash of light, and found Matt Ridgeway,
whose truck had become trapped in sand, Tur said. The crew picked
up the younger Ridgeway and took off again in a rainstorm.
   Just before 4 a.m., in a large sand dune park near Glamis, Matt
Ridgeway spotted his father's mobile home.
   ``The son leans over ... and says `That's it!''' Tur said.
   As the helicopter was landing, the craft's night light went out
but the five landed safely. Tur and the younger Ridgeway ran up to
the mobile home and banged on the door until a bleary-eyed Charles
Ridgeway woke up.
   They told him there was no time for him to get fully dressed and
flew him to a nurse and a small plane, waiting on the ground at
nearby Brawley Airport. The plane took Ridgeway to John Wayne
Airport in Orange County, where a waiting ambulance took him to the
hospital.
   ``It was nerve-wracking,'' said Matt Ridgeway.

<HEAD>New Cabinet Endorses Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As its first act, a new coalition Cabinet
has endorsed a tentative peace agreement with southern rebels and
called for an immediate cease-fire in the country's six-year civil
war.
   Sudan's people are weary of war and the famine it has bred.
   The peace plan, adopted Sunday, endorses the controversial
suspension of Islamic laws, a major demand of the rebels, who are
mostly Christians and animists of African descent.
   The Cabinet also urged opening talks with the rebels, who
contend the Moslem Arab north treats them unfairly and have been
fighting for increased autonomy.
   The issue of Islamic law has kept the country's fundamentalist
National Islamic Front from joining Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's
coalition government, which includes all other parties and interest
groups.
   The war costs the faltering economy $1 million a day, and
related famine has killed hundreds of thousands of southerners.
   Information and Culture Minister Hussein Abu-Saleh told
reporters the Cabinet has decided to form a committee to seek
contacts with the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Organization.
   The rebels, led by Col. John Garang, signed the agreement Nov.
16 with the centrist Democratic Unionist Party, then the senior
partner in Mahdi's Cabinet.
   However, the new government and rebels must now meet to work out
how to impose a cease-fire and other details of the plan.
   It calls for lifting the state of emergency in effect since
President Gaafar Nimeiri was overthrown in April 1985 and a
constitutional conference to negotiate peace.
   Initially, Mahdi refused to sign the agreement, maneuvering to
deprive the Unionists of credit for reaching a settlement where his
own party failed.
   The Unionists quit the government over the issue in December,
and Mahdi replaced them with the Islamic Front.
   That move, coupled with a successful rebel offensive, led the
army to intervene. It issued an ultimatum for Mahdi to resign or
form a broad-based Cabinet to bring peace. Political parties and
trade and professional unions supported the army's demands.
   Mahdi finally complied and swore in his new Cabinet on Saturday.
   Peace talks and a cease-fire, if achieved, would greatly help an
international relief operation to send 100,000 tons of food and
supplies to the south before the rainy season starts in May.
   The United Nations has warned that 100,000 to 600,000 people
could die in southern Sudan this summer if the operation fails.

   To Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the United States
Senate over the last 200 years has been a rock-bound channel, able
to contain the onrushing passions of the moment without losing its
essential and original shape and purpose.
   Byrd, in what he calls a ``labor of love,'' has pursued that
theme in a seven-pound history of the institution as it developed
over the past two centuries.
   The book, called ``The Senate _ 1789-1989'' and available
through the Government Printing Office, is a lavishly illustrated
and meticulous account based on 42 of the 100 speeches Byrd
delivered on the floor of the Senate in an unprecedented series
that began on a spring morning in 1980.
   ``One of my two granddaughters was in the gallery with other
members of her fifth-grade class,'' Byrd recalls. ``I decided I
should mark the occasion by talking a little about the Senate and
its history for that class.
   ``I had no notes; I spoke for an hour,'' he said.
   On the next Friday his older granddaughter was in the gallery
and Byrd decided to make another speech in her honor.
   ``But I thought I ought to make a different speech, so I talked
about the traditions and the customs of the Senate. That's how it
started; that was the seed of the idea. I determined there was
fully enough material to do 100 speeches on the Senate. I saw that
it was going to take a number of years.''
   For most of the next decade, when the business of the Senate had
been completed for the day, Byrd rose to advance his project
another notch, delivering what a generation of Senate clerks and
pages, and doorkeepers, reporters and fellow senators came to call
``Byrd's history lessons.''
   The result is a narrative history of the Senate from the
uncertain first steps of the first Congress in the late winter and
spring of 1789 through the calamity of civil war in the 1860s and
the Senate Watergate investigation of the 1970s.
   The assembly of those speeches into a book was a
``mini-Manhattan Project,'' Byrd says, proudly noting that he
proofread the book five times _ ``every comma, every colon, every
em-dash.''
   To Byrd, the most remarkable fact about the Senate's 200 years
is the way that historic themes tend to repeat themselves.
   Is there concern over the negative tone of last year's
presidential campaign? he asks.
   Then consider, Byrd says, the campaign of 1828 when the
partisans of John Quincy Adams called rival Andrew Jackson ``a
gambler, a drunkard and a duelist'' as well as an adulterer, and
Jackson supporters retaliated in kind, portraying Adams as ``a
monarchist, a gourmandizer and a spendthrift.''
   ``Slander was infectious,'' Byrd says.
   This year's 101st Congress opened with a donnybrook over a
proposed large congressional pay raise.
   Old hat, says Byrd.
   Pay squabbles date to the first Congress and began in earnest in
1816 when it was proposed that the pay rate of $6 a day be changed
to a $1,500 a year.
   The result: Public Outrage.
   The further result, according to Byrd: ``In the next election
two-thirds of the members of the House were defeated. Several
senators were also defeated and some resigned rather than stand for
re-election.''
   Also this year, the Senate tied itself into emotional knots over
President's Bush's nomination of former Sen. John Tower of Texas to
be secretary of defense, a battle that led to Tower's defeat.
   Nothing new in that, says Byrd.
   On a March day in 1843, President John Tyler's nomination of
Rep. Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts to be secretary of the Treasury
was rejected three times in three roll call votes on a single day.
   The Senate was in a nasty mood that day. It twice rejected
Tyler's nomination of Rep. Henry Wise of Virginia to be minister to
France and defeated his nominees to head the navy and war
departments and scuttled his nominee as minister to Brazil.
   To top things off, the Senate rejected Tyler's nomination of
John Spence for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Bush's experience with the Tower nomination can't compare to
that, Byrd says.
   Byrd said he hopes his history, which is available from the
Government Printing Office, will be a contribution to the
institutional memory of the place.
   ``Nothing has changed in 200 years,'' Byrd said. ``The Senate is
still guided by the Constitution and the knowledge that everything
that comes before it is just a new set of circumstances come to
center stage.''

   A West German tourist was trampled to
death by an elephant that she tried to play with during a hike in
northern Thailand, a police officer said today.
   The officer, who asked not to be named, said Helga Torbirt, 49,
was killed in the accident Friday in Chiang Dao, a town about 20
miles north of the major northern city of Chiang Mai near the
Burmese border.
   Her hometown was not available.
   He said she and her husband, Andrew, and other tourists had just
completed a journey by raft and were taking a break in Wang Pasak
village.
   Tourists in the group said they were sitting by a stream when
Mrs. Torbirt approached an elephant that was bathing there. The
animal panicked, rushed toward the woman, grabbed her with its
trunk and threw her to the ground and trampled her, the officer
said.

   Virginia is going to have the first state
laboratory in the nation with a data bank of genetic prints, which
allow police to nab criminals from scanty physical evidence like
saliva left at a crime scene.
   The Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services will
provide DNA testing for the state's police and sheriff's
departments beginning May 1.
   DNA testing is ``the most significant development for law
enforcement since fingerprinting, and that dates back about 100
years,'' said Paul B. Ferrara, director of the state Bureau of
Forensic Science.
   The lab will develop a computerized data bank of DNA prints of
sex offenders in the state. State legislation passed last month
requires sex offenders to submit blood samples for DNA analysis.
   DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the chromosomes of
cells, including saliva, hair, blood, semen, tissue and bone
marrow. Only identical twins can have the same DNA pattern, or
genetic blueprint.
   Scientists in recent years have developed technology for taking
DNA from body fluids or tissue left at a crime scene and matching
it with the genetic blueprint of a suspect.
   ``If a rapist leaves seminal fluid at the scene ... he might as
well be leaving his Social Security card,'' Ferrara said.
   He said DNA testing already helped nabbed one person in Virginia
_ Timothy Spencer of Richmond, who was convicted of three capital
murders on the basis of genetic printing.
   ``I'm not a lawyer, but based on what I've been told, Timothy
Spencer probably never would have been convicted without the DNA
testing,'' Ferrara said. The case is under review by the state
Supreme Court.
   Ferrara said DNA testing also could serve as a criminal
deterrent. He said criminals can be careful not to leave
fingerprints, as Spencer was, but the chances of committing a
violent crime without leaving a DNA sample are slim.
   Pre-DNA analysis of body fluids, tissue and hair left at crime
scenes consisted of examining enzymes and blood types _ processes
which only narrowed the list of possible perpetrators.
   ``Conventional serological evidence was always circumstantial,''
Ferrara said. ``You could say that a particular sample could have
come from, say, 13 percent of the male population. But with DNA
testing, you can say this sample definitely came from that person.
It's just like fingerprints in that respect.''
   DNA is inherited, with each parent contributing one-half. For
about 10 years, scientists have used DNA testing to establish
paternity and to research genetically related diseases.
   About three years ago, DNA testing was first used to solve a
rape in a small town in England, Ferrara said. The technology has
since been used to solve several crimes in the United States, but
Virginia is among the first states to implement widespread DNA
testing.
   Two Virginia serologists were trained in DNA testing at a lab in
New York and Ferrara received $80,000 from the state for equipment
and supplies.
   Last year, Ferrara secured an additional $200,000 in state funds
to keep the program going.

<HEAD>Adams Case Spotlights Judicial System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The release of Randall Dale Adams, who once was
three days from execution for a crime he long claimed he didn't
commit, has put the spotlight on a judicial system that imprisoned
``The Thin Blue Line'' defendant.
   Dallas police, prosecutors and judges ``have lost some
credibility with the public and the only thing that will restore it
is time, if they can demonstrate they will not be as zealous and
rabid as they demonstrated this (past) week,'' said Adams'
attorney, Randy Schaffer.
   Adams, who spent 12{ years in prison, was freed last week on
grounds he received an unfair trial. Dallas County District
Attorney John Vance dropped the charges, saying there wasn't enough
evidence to retry Adams for the 1976 slaying of Dallas police
officer Robert Wood.
   Vance soon found himself on the defensive, trying to explain why
his department had failed to examine Adams' case before and fought
court orders to free Adams.
   Defense attorneys and others are questioning how the case was
handled from the time prosecutors suppressed evidence at the 1977
trial to an assistant district attorney's contention last week that
judges who ruled in Adams' favor should be disqualified because of
their liberal beliefs.
   ``Do we have within the prosecutor's department people who do
not really understand or respect the rule of law?'' the Dallas
Times Herald questioned in an editorial Saturday. ``Is that the
lesson of the Adams case? ... If it is, then no one in the
community is separated from the fate of Randall Adams by more than
the thinnest of whims.''
   The editorial called for Vance to heal the district attorney's
office of a ``strong and dangerous streak of abuse and fanaticism.''
   Vance maintains the criminal justice system did not fail Adams.
   ``I think Mr. Adams would be the first to admit to you that the
criminal justice system works,'' Vance said. ``If it didn't, he
would be on death row.''
   Adams was three days from the electric chair in 1980, but the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled his jury had been improperly selected.
Instead of seeking a retrial, then-District Attorney Henry Wade
persuaded Gov. Bill Clements to commute Adams' sentence to life in
prison.
   ``One has to question, if they were convinced Randall Dale Adams
was a cop killer, why didn't they go back a second time and get the
death penalty?'' said Peter Lesser, a Dallas defense attorney.
   It was just such questions that prompted film maker Errol Morris
to re-examine Adams' case in the 1988 documentary ``The Thin Blue
Line.''
   The film showed prosecution witness David Harris recanting his
testimony that Adams was the trigger man, as well as other
witnesses giving information that conflicted with their testimony.
Harris now is on death row for an unrelated murder.
   Wade retired in 1986, but the never-quit reputation of his
office carried on with Winfield Scott, the assistant district
attorney who fought against retrial or release for Adams.
   Earlier this year, State District Judge Larry Baraka recommended
that Adams get a new trial or be set free. The Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals concurred.
   Baraka last week ordered Adams released on a $50,000 personal
recognizance bond. Adams spent an extra night in jail, however,
after Scott tried to have Baraka removed from the case and Adams'
bail increased to a $100,000 cash bond.
   Scott acknowledged he had not read the opinions of the appellate
court and Baraka, but said it was clear Baraka and eight of the
nine appellate judges were liberal and biased toward Adams.
   Another state district judge denied Scott's arguments and
cleared Adams' release.
   Scott was not in his office when called by The Associated Press.
Prosecutors have consistently declined to comment on the case. Wade
did not return messages from the AP.
   Vance said he will order a transcript of the recent hearings,
including Scott's testimony, and look into it as a personnel
matter. But he defended Scott, saying he has done an outstanding
job for years.
   Adams' attorney said prosecutors were right to investigate Adams
aggressively but could have handled the complex case better.
   ``It's that hard case that really is a measure of the quality of
a justice system and in this case they failed miserably,'' Schaffer
said.

   Less than an hour after former Texas
death row inmate Randall Dale Adams discussed his newly gained
freedom on national television last week, the state put another
inmate to death.
   The timing wasn't lost on the nearly 300 condemned men who
remain on the row, the nation's second largest, who argue that
Adams may not have been the only one who was wrongly convicted.
   ``They're talking about this guy getting off death row and
here's some guy getting executed the same time and they're not
talking about that,'' said convicted killer James Beathard.
   ``I see a whole lot of conflicting signals to the public,'' said
Beathard. ``It should be obvious to people they're going to kill
some innocent people out there.''
   Leon Rutherford King, who was convicted of a Houston murder 11
years ago, was executed by lethal injection last Wednesday shortly
after Adams appeared on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' program. Texas has
executed 30 inmates since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death
penaly in 1976, more than any other state.
   Adams was the subject of ``The Thin Blue Line,'' a documentary
that questioned his 1977 conviction for killing a Dallas police
officer.
   He came within three days of death in 1980 before his sentence
was commuted to life in prison. Adams was freed last week under a
Texas Court of Appeals ruling that said he didn't receive a fair
trial because prosecutors suppressed evidence and witnesses lied on
the stand. Prosecutors in Dallas said they wouldn't retry him.
   ``Isn't it nice that Adams gets relief _ and then we continue on
with the executions,'' said Lester Bower, another death row
convict. ``How many mistakes have to be pointed out and discovered?
... How many do you have to see before someone says, `Well, just
how many could there be?' And if there can be, can we justify
continuing executing?''
   King, like many of the 29 inmates who preceded him to the Texas
death chamber since the state resumed executions in 1982, had a
second trial after his first conviction and death sentence were
thrown out on a technicality.
   ``A number of men with cases similar to his, mine included, had
Adams issues,'' says Billy Hughes, whose conviction and death
sentence for the slaying of a state trooper were reversed. Unlike
Adams, however, Hughes was tried again, convicted again and
sentenced to death again.
   The most famous contested death row case is that of Clarence
Brandley, a black man facing execution for the 1980 rape-slaying of
a white teenage girl.
   He was convicted and sentenced to die in a second trial after
his first ended with a hung jury. But a state district judge has
recommended that the Court of Appeals grant a new trial, saying his
conviction and sentencing were marred by racial prejudice, perjured
testimony and a biased investigation. The appeals court is
reviewing the case.
   Bob Walt, the assistant attorney general who handles capital
cases in Texas, said the cases of Adams and Brandley show that the
system catches trial and prosecutor errors and ensures innocent
people aren't put to death.
   ``You obviously have some fear at some point but that fear
diminishes over time as more and more judges see and review the
case,'' said Walt. ``The system eliminates any realistic
possibility that innocent people would be executed.''
   Walt also understands the inmates' distaste for what his office
does.
   ``I wouldn't like anyone who's trying to get me killed,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Haitian Refugees Bolt Against Coast Guard On High Seas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-seas standoff between the Coast Guard and
250 U.S.-bound Haitians packed aboard a rickety 50-foot sailboat
ended peacefully after a 30-hour confrontation that included
threats babies would be thrown overboard.
   The Haitians agreed Sunday to the leave the boat and be returned
to their country. No injuries were reported.
   One refugee woman was rescued after leaping into the sea and
others vowed to throw their infant children overboard unless they
were allowed to continue toward the United States, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Gary Starks.
   ``It was really an ordeal and there were some very tense
moments,'' said Starks. ``There was no idea what would happen and
none of the Haitians had life jackets. There was a potential for a
significant loss of life.''
   The sailboat was discovered about 9 a.m. EST Saturday by the
Coast Guard cutter Escape, which was transporting nearly 100
Haitians intercepted the previous day back to the impoverished
nation, officials said.
   A rope was used to immobilize the rudder of the refugee vessel
and four other Coast Guard cutters were sent to the scene before
the Haitians surrendered about 120 miles southeast of Miami, Starks
said.
   The cutters Escape and Steadfast were traveling toward
Port-au-Prince today, Coast Guard officials said.
   Starks said none of the refugees had weapons and no one was
injured, although three ill Haitians were transported to the Coast
Guard base in Miami Beach. Some of the Haitians aboard the Escape
refused to eat in an act of sympathy with the other refugees, he
said.
   The standoff revealed the growing frustration driving record
numbers of refugees to seek Florida's shores, a Haitian leader said.
   ``This incident is just a hint of what could become common,''
said the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, director of the Haitian Refugee
Center in Miami and a spokesman for the city's Haitian community.
   ``Some of those on the boats are army defectors and will do just
about anything to keep from going back to Haiti,'' Jean-Juste said.
   Jean-Juste said the influx of Central American immigrants into
South Florida is fueling resentment among Haitians, who are
routinely returned to their homeland after being stopped at sea.
   Under Immigration and Naturalization Service policy, brief
hearings are held with refugees intercepted at sea and only those
deemed political asylum candidates are allowed to enter the United
States. Other so-called ``economic refugees'' are returned to their
native country.
   Only five of the more than 20,000 Haitians interviewed at sea
since 1981 have been brought into the country for asylum hearings.
This month, about 1,400 Haitians have been stopped at sea, more
than any other month in the eight-year interdiction program.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Say Dissident Faces Arrest For Visiting North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government prosecutors said today that
a dissident leader who made an unauthorized visit to communist
North Korea to discuss reuniting the two Koreas will be arrested if
he returns to Seoul.
   In a separate action, police detained 23 dissident writers and
supporters who tried to reach the North Korean border today for a
reunification meeting with communist delegates at the Panmunjom
truce site.
   Seoul officials had prohibited the meeting.
   Prosecutor Bae Jae-wook said the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan would face
prosecution under tough national security laws for making his
unauthorized visit to the north to meet top communist officials.
Moon could face up to 10 years imprisonment if convicted.
   Moon's surprise arrival Saturday in Pyongyang after a trip to
Japan and China shocked capitalist South Korea. The two Koreas are
bitter rivals who have clashed repeatedly, and their border is
sealed.
   South Korean officials criticized Moon for a speech he made in
Pyongyang describing North Korean leader Kim Il Sung as a
``respectable president.''
   Kim, who rules one of the world's most repressive police states,
is widely feared in the south for having started the Korean War.
Many South Koreans believe he still wants to conquer their country.
   Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo said Moon's unauthorized visit
was an attempt to undermine President Roh Tae-woo's efforts to
improve relations with North Korea. Lee said Moon's visit aided
North Korea by giving the impression that some South Koreans
support the Pyongyang government.
   South Korean dissidents, rejecting their government's efforts to
improve relations with the north, have been trying to start a
dialogue with the north on reuniting the peninsula. The dissidents
claim to speak for people in the south despite their lack of public
support.
   Pro-Western South Korea and communist North Korea were divided
at the end of World War II and fought the Korean war from 1950 to
1953. They are technically still at war because no peace treaty was
signed, and more than 1 million heavily armed soldiers face each
other across the 150-mile border.
   Roh ordered a major crackdown last week on radical groups after
charging they were attempting to stage a leftist revolution.
Government officials said Moon's visit was part of those attempts
to undermine the administration.
   Dissident groups calling for Roh's overthrow have been staging
violent protests, but they are not viewed as a major threat to the
government.
   Roh last week indefinitely postponed a promised referendum on
his performance, citing a threat of radical violence.
   Senior South Korean army commanders deplored Moon's visit at a
meeting today and demanded he be punished, Yonhap, the South Korean
news agency, reported.
   The main opposition parties all said today that Moon should not
have gone to North Korea without government permission.
   However, the United National Democratic Movement, the South's
main dissident alliance, expressed support for Moon at a press
conference.
   ``We hope he will return home with fruitful results,'' the
alliance said in a press statement.
   The two Koreas have been holding intermittent talks since last
August on improving relations. Little progress has been made
because each side has tended to push its own proposals and ignore
the other's initiatives.

<HEAD>Navy Captain's Wife Issues Public Appeal to Solve Car-Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of a Navy captain who mistakenly shot
down an Iranian airliner with 290 people on board began appearing
on television today in spots aimed at finding whoever planted a
bomb that destroyed her van.
   Authorities believe the bomb, which exploded while Sharon Rogers
was driving the van on March 10, might have been the work of
terrorists.
   ``We don't know who did it. We just must realize that someone is
out there who committed a very cowardly act,'' said Mrs. Rogers,
whose husband, USS Vincennes Capt. Will C. Rogers III, on July 3
gave the order to fire on the jetliner when it was misidentified by
ship radar operators as an attacking Iranian warplane. Iran vowed
revenge.
   ``Together as a community we have to find out who it is so that
(a car-bombing) doesn't happen to anybody else,'' Mrs. Rogers said
in a videotaped interview for Crime Stoppers.
   ``It could be me last week, you tomorrow,'' she said.
   The spot, which is intended to help find witnesses, includes a
re-enactment of Mrs. Rogers scrambling out of her van seconds
before it burst into flames.
   ``My life has been threatened, and that of my family has been
threatened,'' she said. ``I have lost my job, I can't go back to my
home and my life has completely done a turnaround.''
   Mrs. Rogers' shadow-darkened front is obscured by electronic
scrambling in the video, which contains the most extensive public
statement she or her husband has made about the bombing.
   During the interview, not all of which will be shown in the
Crime Stoppers segment, Mrs. Rogers describes what happened as she
was waiting at a San Diego intersection while driving to work.
   ``I had been sitting at the red light maybe 20, 30 seconds when
I felt that I had been rear-ended ... by a car going very fast,''
said Mrs. Rogers, who was not injured.
   ``At the same ime, I heard an explosion. I opened up the door. I
smelled (something) burning. I got my seat belt off as quickly as I
could. I jumped out and ran around the back end of the van, where I
saw the back third of my van on fire.''
   Mrs. Rogers and her husband have been in protected seclusion
since the bombing, which the FBI is investigating. Possible motives
that agents have said they're checking include retaliation for the
downed Iranian airliner.
   A week after the bombing, Mrs. Rogers was dismissed from her job
of 12 years at La Jolla Country Day School, which was the target
the same week of a telephoned bomb threat that turned out to be a
hoax.
   In a letter received Saturday by parents of students at the
exclusive private school, Headmaster Timothy Burns said Mrs. Rogers
was not allowed to return partly because of concerns that her
presence would create a military atmosphere and disrupt the campus'
learning environment.
   Crime Stoppers is a non-profit organization that works with law
enforcement agencies to offer rewards to people who provide
anonymous tips that help solve crimes featured in weekly segments
shown on local television stations as a public service.
   A total of $37,000 has been pledged to the reward fund in the
Rogers case, including $25,000 from an anonymous San Diego
developer and $1,000 from the Vincennes crew, said Molly Wilson
Cartmill, executive director of the San Diego chapter of Crime
Stoppers.

   People who were outraged over an art exhibit that
featured a U.S. flag on the floor now can get some measure of
revenge: They can walk on a likeness of the artist at another
exhibit.
   The new piece was put together by a junior high school art
teacher who was angered by the original by student ``Dread'' Scott
Tyler of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
   The protest exhibit features a life-size sketch of Tyler drawn
on cloth in the manner of a police outline of a homicide victim.
The cloth is on the floor and a U.S. flag hangs above it on a wall
of a small North Side museum.
   Viewers are encouraged to step on the sketch of Tyler's face
while they write comments on ``How to Display `Dread' Scott Tyler.''
   The original work, part of a minority students' exhibit that is
now closed, was titled ``What is the Proper Way to Display a U.S.
Flag?'' It featured a U.S. flag positioned on the floor in front of
a book asking viewers to write their opinions about how the flag
should be displayed.
   Tyler's display touched off several protests, including one
attended by 2,500 veterans and supporters that led to the arrests
of four people.
   Art Institute officials defended the flag display and the
student's right to freedom of expression. But veterans and
protesters succeeded in temporarily shutting down the exhibit
several times. It closed March 16 after a month of controversy.
   Tyler could not be reached for comment on the protest exhibit.
He has an unlisted telephone number.
   ``I was upset by seeing my flag on the floor,'' said Gary Mann,
33, the art teacher from suburban Deerfield. As he spoke, visitors
walked over his work at the cramped, storefront Vietnam Museum.
   One visitor to Mann's work, wrote, ``An artist he is not, this
Dread Scott. He is an unpatriotic snot. He knows not what this
country is about.''
   Vietnam Museum owner Joe Hertel said he contacted Mann and asked
him to exhibit the display at his museum after hearing news reports
on it.
   ``It showed contempt for the artist who showed contempt for the
flag,'' said Hertel, a Vietnam veteran.
   Mann, who said he graduated from the School of the Art Institute
in 1976, plans to move the exhibit to various Veterans of Foreign
Wars' halls around the state.

<HEAD>Aquino Says Communists Can Serve If Freely Elected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said today
on the eve of nationwide village elections that pro-Communist
candidates who are voted into office in the balloting can serve if
they are freely and fairly chosen.
   The military claims the rebels will use the vote to expand their
base.
   Also today, the rebels claimed they have recovered from setbacks
suffered during Mrs. Aquino's administration, and police said three
men shot up the home of an anti-communist activist near Cebu,
killing three people, including the man's wife.
   On Tuesday, voters in the country's 42,000 villages, or
``barangays,'' will select about 287,567 local council members.
   The military claims the rebels are backing pro-Marxist
candidates in hopes of solidifying their control in thousands of
rural villages.
   Mrs. Aquino was asked if the government would prevent rebel
supporters from claiming council seats. The Communist Party of the
Philippines is banned, but Tuesday's balloting is supposed to be
non-partisan.
   ``Well, if they have been elected legitimately, there has been
no force, they will hold office,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters. ``We
have to abide by the law.''
   Col. Gerardo Flores, intelligence chief of the Philippine
Constabulary, said the rebels hope to capture 60 percent of the
village council seats in areas under their control.
   The rebels claim to control about 8,500 villages nationwide. But
the Commission on Election puts the figure at about 2,800. The
difference is believed to be in definitions of ``control.''
   ``In remote, inaccessible areas, there is hardly any government
presence,'' said election commissioner Haydee Yorac. ``So the party
members are the ones who exercise the most serious influence.''
   Hilario Davide, chairman of the election commission, said troops
would be deployed in about 3,500 districts considered ``hot spots.''
   In a statement marking Wednesday's 20th anniversary of the
communist New People's Army, rebel Chief of Staff Romulo Kintanar
claimed a force of 30,000 fighters deployed in 65 of the
Philippines' 73 provinces, 800 of 1,500 cities and 12,000 villages
and neighborhoods.
   ``NPA units have largely recovered from setbacks in 1985 and
1986 and have reconstituted guerrilla formations which had been
reduced for a time,'' Kintanar said.
   Civilian and military authorities claim the rebels are losing
strength because of more effective counterinsurgency operations and
improvements in the Philippine economy.
   They also maintain that the rebels lost much of their appeal
following the February 1986 ouster of President Ferdinand Marcos'
authoritarian administration and the rise of Mrs. Aquino to power.
   Mrs. Aquino has vowed to crush the insurgents before her term
expires in 1992. The New People's Army was founded on March 29,
1969 by leftist intellectuals and remnants of the pro-Soviet HUK
guerrillas, who waged an unsuccessful insurgency in the 1950s and
1960s.
   Kintanar was captured in March 1987 but escaped last year from
the stockade at Manila's Camp Crame after attending a birthday
party for his former jailer.
   In Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila, police and witnesses said
gunmen late Sunday sprayed semi-automatic rifle fire on the home of
Rogelio Nara, 37, in the village of Kan-Irag in the mountains above
the city.
   Nara's wife and two male relatives were killed and two others
were wounded, including Nara's nine-year-old daughter, police said.
Nara is a member of the Movement for Democratic Reforms, one of
hundreds of government-backed anti-communist vigilante groups
operating nationwide.
   Police said the attackers could have been rebels or relatives of
a man killed by Nara several years ago.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Japan, Stocks Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen today,
while stock prices lost ground on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 132.30 yen, up 1.03 yen from last Friday's
close. The U.S. currency opened at 131.68 yen and moved in a range
of 131.67-132.30 yen.
   The dollar opened slightly higher than last Friday's close of
131.27 yen, but active buying of the dollar by insurance companies
pushed it further, currency dealers said.
   They attributed the dollar's bullishness to the market's reduced
wariness toward rising interest rates.
   ``There seem to be no strong incentive to sell the dollar right
now,'' said Masato Sanjo, a dealer at the Tokyo office of
Manufacture Hanover Trust. ``The bullish dollar appears to have
become more like a long-term trend.''
   Another currency dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said there was
some demand for the dollar in early trading but otherwise the
market was ``very quiet'' as most overseas markets were observing a
three-day Easter holiday from last Friday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 20.14-point
loser last Friday, shed another 56.12 points, or 0.18 percent, to
close at 31,512.40.
   On the stock market, dealers said the anticipation of the
introduction of the capital-gain tax starting April 1 led to heavy
sale of shares, resulting in a lower Nikkei index.
   Investors currently pay a 0.55-percent securities tax when
selling shares, but from April 1, they will pay 1.3 percent in
taxes _ 1 percent in capital gain tax and 0.3 percent for the
securities tax.
   Also, in anticipation of the indictment of former chairan of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. for bribery charges in a
stock-trading scandal, NTT shares closed at an all time low of 1.53
million yen. Its previous low was 1.58 million marked on last
Wednesday.
   But dealers expressed optimism, saying market environments are
not as bad as the Nikkei indicates.
   ``The fact that Nikkei fell only less than 0.2 percent despite
all the bad news indicates the deep-down bullishness of the
market,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage in Tokyo. ``Once all
the bad news is out, it will be time for the spring rally.''

<HEAD>More Space Chicks to Hatch Later This Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An experiment scientists hope will shed
light on the cause of motion sickness in zero gravity and the loss
of bone mass in astronauts continues this week as more ``space
chicks'' hatch.
   The first of a group of baby chicks to hatch from eggs that took
a five-day space ride aboard the space shuttle Discovery pecked
through his shell Friday night at Kentucky Fried Chicken
headquarters here.
   Kentucky Fried Chicken is the sponsor of the experiment that is
the brainchild of Purdue University senior John Vellinger.
   The first space chick hatched less than a week after the eggs
took their ride. Seven more space chicks and eight from a control
group that remained on the ground also hatched Friday and Saturday.
Another eight eggs that traveled in space and eight more control
eggs are to hatch this Saturday.
   Vellinger said the experiment was designed to measure the
effects of a weightless environment on embryo development.
   Vellinger, 23, designed an incubator that was launched aboard
Discovery on March 13. It carried 32 chicken eggs. A similar
incubator with a control group of 32 eggs was kept on the ground
during the period that Discovery was in space.
   Vellinger and a group of scientific advisers will study the
chicks during the next year and then prepare a paper assessing the
results.
   The other half of the 64 eggs _ from space and the control group
_ were opened by Vellinger and his five advisers after the shuttle
landed to examine the embryos at that stage in their development.
   Ronald Hullinger, a professor of veterinary medicine at Purdue,
said it is possible the experiment could provide clues about human
reproduction during generations-long voyages as well as the
differences in cartilage, bone, tissue and internal organs between
the space chicks and their Earthbound contemporaries.

<HEAD>Sheriff's Department To Comply With Grand Jury Recommendations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sheriff's Department has agreed to comply
with grand jury recommendations for ending abuse of jail inmates by
a so-called ``Rambo Squad'' that allegedly stripped, chained and
beat inmates, a spokesman said.
   The grand jury investigated allegations by more than 100 people
who said they had been abused or held naked in jail cells after
being arrested for misdemeanor offenses which usually were
alcohol-related.
   No indictments were issued, but the panel's report, released
last week following a nine-month investigation, criticized San
Diego County Sheriff John Duffy and his top assistants for failing
to provide the leadership to stop a group of deputies at the El
Cajon jail from preying on inmates.
   The grand jury found that the deputies found ``delight in
cruelty to others.''
   The panel also cited coverups and mismanagement by jail
supervisors, and said many deputies looked the other way while
inmates were being assaulted or harassed.
   Department spokesman Lt. Alan Fulmer said Duffy has reviewed the
20-page report and ``there is absolutely nothing he disagrees
with.''
   ``He thinks all the recommendations are good, and he would like
to implement them as soon as possible,'' Fulmer said.
   The panel's recommendations include the creation of an
Inspections and Control Division; a strengthening of the
department's Internal Affairs Division; required filing of detailed
reports of physical confrontations between prisoners and deputies;
and tougher standards for the selection and performance of jail
training officers.

   Much of the South got showers and thunderstorms today and rain
also fell in the Pacific Northwest, while parts of Kansas were so
windy that residents were warned of blowing dust.
   The storms reached from south central Kansas across central
Oklahoma and northwest Texas; from western Arkansas across
northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana; from central Louisiana
into northwest Mississippi; and over south central Minnesota.
   Evening thunderstorms in Texas on Sunday produced golf ball-size
hail near Winters, as well as three-quarter inch diameter hail at
Dougherty and Matador.
   In Kansas, winds gusted to 48 mph at Fort Riley and to 55 mph at
Salina. Advisories were posted for blowing dust this morning.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 a.m. EST
included more than an inch at Fort Sill, Okla., and almost an inch
at Leesville, La.
   The high temperature for the nation Sunday was 91 at McAllen,
Texas.
   Today's forecast: showers and thunderstorms scattered from
southern and eastern Arizona across the southern Plains, the
Mississippi Valley and the upper Great Lakes; possible severe
thunderstorms from south central Texas and the western Gulf Coast

   Here are some facts and figures for Sunday's national
parliamentary elections in the Soviet Union:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VOTERS _ About 190 million of the 285 million Soviets were
eligible to vote. To qualify, a voter had to be 18 years of age or
older and a Soviet citizen. The only legal disqualification is
insanity.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CANDIDATES _ There were 2,895 candidates running for 1,500 seats
in the 2,250-seat assembly. In 1,116 constituencies, voters had a
choice of two or more candidates. Only one candidate appeared on
the ballot in 384 districts. A total of 82 percent of candidates
were members of the Communist Party. Only 16 percent were women.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   REPRESENTATION _ The candidates elected Sunday will serve
five-year terms. A total of 750 deputies were elected in
territorial districts of equal population across the country, each
representing 257,300 constituents. The others were elected to
represent the 15 constituent Soviet republics, or autonomous
republics, regions and districts. An additional 750 seats in
congress are being directly filled by the Communist Party, Soviet
Academy of Sciences and other officially sanctioned organizations.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BALLOTING _ Voting opened at 7 a.m. at about 180,000 polling
stations across the country's 11 time zones. Polls closed at 8 p.m.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RESULTS _ The full tabulation of votes will take about 10 days.
The official Tass news agency said the names of winners would begin
to appear in local newspapers on Tuesday. Under the electoral law,
all results, including absentee ballots, must be published no later
than April 5.

   Abandoning hopes that raucous spring
break festivities might subside, police called in more patrols over
the Easter weekend, made hundreds of arrests and braced for a
second wave of vacationing students.
   ``We've got some tired officers,'' Sgt. Steve Harrison said
early today.
   Rest appears out of the question anytime soon as vacation
schedules call for a new load of college and high school students
this week, he said.
   ``USC (University of Southern California), Stanford and others
are heading into town apparently,'' Harrison said. ``We had hoped
it was over with.''
   The first phase of the annual rite of spring has already left
the desert resort town 110 miles southeast of Los Angeles littered
with beer bottles, cans and other trash, he said.
   During the 10-day period beginning March 17, three people died
in traffic accidents and a 19-year-old woman was injured when she
fell from the balcony of a hotel.
   Arrests reached 1,640 over the weekend. Charges ranged from
drunken driving to assault. Officers have handed out an estimated
6,000 traffic citations, Harrison said.

   Children hunted for eggs and Americans paraded under mostly
sunny skies to celebrate Easter, while services around the nation
echoed with more somber calls to remember the homeless and U.S.
hostages in the Middle East.
   San Francisco's Glide Memorial United Methodist Church served a
home-cooked breakfast to about 100 homeless people and poor
children dressed up in frilly Easter dresses and stylish blue jeans
donated by the church. Afterward, they hunted for Easter eggs.
   ``It's all for the kids,'' said the Rev. Cecil Williams.
   Near Albany, N.Y., the Rev. Bede Ferrara, a Roman Catholic
priest who describes himself as a traveling Franciscan preacher,
set up a shrine in his home in Clifton Park for the U.S. hostages
in the Middle East.
   ``We have photos of each American hostage on display and the
number of days they've been in captivity. We have an empty basket
which symbolizes that their baskets are empty this Easter,'' he
said.
   A more light-hearted atmosphere swept along New York City's
Fifth Avenue, where thousands enjoyed sunny 60-degree weather and
promenaded in the annual Easter parade. Jacqueline Kerstens
attracted a crowd with a 6-pound, 4-foot-tall bonnet that was a
basket of silk flowers _ lilies, apple blossoms and forsythia.
   In the nation's capital, President and Mrs. Bush attended a
christening at St. Alban's Chapel for their latest grandchild,
Ashley Bush, who was born Feb. 7 to the Bushes' son Neil and his
wife, Sharon.
   In Dallas, crowds at the Biblical Arts Center walked through a
life-size reproduction of Paul's Gate at Damascus and Christ's tomb.
   ``Easter is about the resurrection of Christ and the fact that
he died for all of us who believe in him. It's not about the bunny
and the painted eggs,'' said Ronnie Roese, the non-denominational
center's director.
   Nonetheless, more than 20,000 people flocked to a farm in Homer,
Ga., to hunt for about 140,000 dyed hens' eggs and candy eggs in
what was said to be the world's largest Easter egg hunt.
   A California condor laid a 5-inch-long, 10-ounce Easter egg.
Officials at the Los Angeles Zoo spotted the blue egg shortly after
sunrise.
   ``What an Easter egg!,'' exclaimed zoo spokeswoman Deborah
Pollack. ``If fertile, God willing, it will hatch in 54 to 58
days.'' Only one of the endangered condors has ever been conceived
in captivity.

   A man who falsely claimed he had placed a bomb
aboard a Pan American World Airways jet flying from New York to
London and demanded $1 million in ransom was arrested, police at
John F. Kennedy Airport said today.
   The man called the airport police information center Sunday
evening and told the operator he had placed a bomb on Pan Am Flight
102, said Port Authority Police Officer Sal Borgese.
   Borgese said the caller never gave a reason for the threat or
identified himself as belonging to any group.
   While an officer kept the caller on the line, police traced the
call to a pay telephone at the airport's Pan Am terminal, where
they found Scott Sasonkin, 23, Borgese said.
   Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kriendler said the caller later denied
putting a bomb on the plane and the flight was not affected.
   Sasonkin was being booked on charges of attempted grand larceny,
falsely reporting an incident and aggravated harassment, Borgese
said.

   Syrian and Christian army gunners
hammered each other's positions in and around Beirut today after
random bombardment of the capital forced residents to spend the
Easter holiday underground.
   Police said three civilians were killed and 13 wounded in the
hostilities overnight and during the morning. The casualties raised
the toll to 97 dead and 339 wounded since the latest round of
fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war broke out March 8.
   The rocket and artillery barrages in the capital tapered off at
daybreak. But heavy duels resounded in the mountains overlooking
Beirut, police said.
   It was the fourth consecutive night that barrages on both
Christian east Beirut and Moslem west Beirut have confined
civilians to basements and bomb shelters.
   The Syrians and their allies have also ordered a blockade of
east Beirut and nearby Christian communities, home of about 1
million people.
   Syrian forces and allied Druse gunners pounded east Beirut with
rocket barrages of up to 60 rounds per minute during the night. The
bombardment set fires at a fuel tank at the Beirut port and the
city's main power plant, police said. The Christian army units
retaliated with barrages from 155mm howitzers.
   Until the damaged plant is repaired, authorities will be able to
provide electricity for just four hours a day.
   The fighting pits army Commander Gen. Michel Aoun's
predominantly Christian units against an alliance of Syrian troops
and militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party.
   Aoun contends the Syrians, who intervened 13 years ago as
peacekeepers, have turned into an occupation force by taking sides
with Moslems and Druse. He heads a Christian military Cabinet in
Lebanon's divided government. Syrians back the rival Moslem
government.
   The Christian leader has declared a ``war of liberation'' to
drive out the 40,000 Syrian troops. He has vowed to fight on even
at the risk of destroying Beirut.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet,
today rejected Aoun's accusations.
   ``The Syrian army entered Lebanon in 1976 at the request of the
then reigning Lebanese government. This request was later endorsed
by the Arab League, of which Lebanon is a founding member,'' Hoss
said.
   He said any demand for a Syrian pullout should be made by a
united Lebanese government ``which is not present at the moment.''
   The latest violence began after Aoun imposed a blockade on
milita-run ports. The militias skim taxes that would otherwise go
to the government.

   Political manuevering in Israel over ``who is a
Jew'' has left a painful legacy among American Jews, who in a
survey more often perceived unfairness to Conservative and Reform
Jews than to West Bank Arabs.
   The American Jewish Committee study revealed support for Israel
was as strong as ever, but it also showed that widespread
discontent was sown when attempts were made to amend Israel's Law
of Return to deny non-Orthodox converts an automatic right to
Israeli citizenship.
   The study also provided new evidence of a growing activism among
American Jews toward their spiritual homeland, according to some
observers.
   A majority, 54 percent, of the survey said they had spoken
critically of attempts to change the law.
   A third said they would be less likely to make political or
charitable contributions to Israel if the law is changed to exclude
converts from Reform and Conservative Judaism, branches to which
more than 80 percent of American Jews affiliated to a synagogue
belong.
   ``I think the effect is kind of a contingent, or sleeper,
effect,'' said Queens College Professor Steven M. Cohen, who
conducted the survey for the committee's Institute on American
Jewish-Israeli Relations. ``This precedent will allow American Jews
to forcefully and pointedly disagree'' on other issues involving
Israel.
   The attempt to define Jewishness provided an ``emotional vent''
to American Jews already concerned about Israel's response to the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, according to
Gunther Lawrence, a media consultant to the Rabbinical Assembly and
other Jewish groups.
   ``I think that this is a family squabble that is erupting above
the surface,'' Lawrence said. ``American Jews and Diaspora Jews are
no longer content with being checkbook Jews only.''
   Orthodox religious parties, which do not recognize the validity
of conversions performed by Conservative and Reform rabbis, have
long sought to change the Law of Return, but the issue heated up
last year when they emerged as power brokers because neither of the
two major Israeli parties, Labor and Likud, won a majority in
elections. Both parties indicated a willingness to negotiate on the
Law of Return issue in return for the help of the religious parties
in forming a coalition government.
   The committee's poll, conducted among 944 Jews in January and
February, was not a random sample and provided no measure of its
sampling error. But Cohen said participants were demographically
representative of the American-Jewish community. The questions were
mailed to Jews on a list compiled by Market Facts, a research
company.
   The findings indicated the issue struck hard and close to home:
   _Two-thirds said Israel would be declaring Conservative and
Reform Judaism illegitimate if the Law of Return were changed to
recognize only conversions performed by Orthodox rabbis.
   _Three-quarters said they would be upset if the law were changed
to recognize only Orthodox conversion, and more than half saying
they would be ``very upset.''
   _Thirty-seven percent said they would be less likely to make
contributions to the United Jewish Appeal, and 31 percent said they
would be less likely to contribute to pro-Israel political
candidates if the law were changed.
   Cohen said he was shocked that respondents were more upset with
the Law of Return issue than with the Palestinian uprising on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where more than 400 Palestinians and 17
Israelis have died during the past 15 months.
   For example, 39 percent of the respondents said Conservative and
Reform Jews are treated unfairly in Israel, while slightly less
than a third of the respondents said Arabs on the West Bank and
Gaza are treated unfairly.
   While some Orthodox leaders in Israel have tried to downplay the
political consequences of changing the law, the survey confirmed it
is a grass-roots issue, said one of the American-Jewish leaders who
urged Israeli officials to retain the present law.
   ``It's natural and understandable they should react with great
fury,'' said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, executive director of the
Association of Reform Zionists of America. ``They sense the Jewish
state is proclaiming their Judaism to be illegitimate.''
   The issue has faded into the background recently as Labor and
Likud were able to form a coalition government, but American-Jewish
leaders are already preparing to fight the battle again.
   Ira Silverman, executive vice president of the Jewish committee,
said, ``American Jews are at this stage regrouping,'' and have
shared the survey results with Israeli officials.

   On March 27, 1964, an earthquake of
record-breaking proportions seized southcentral Alaska and set off
sea waves that punished far-off Pacific ports. Ward Sims, now
retired as AP bureau chief for Alaska, covered the disaster.

<TEXT>
   The earthquake that shuddered across
Alaska on that Good Friday packed so strong a punch that it knocked
out a seismograph in Fairbanks. It took a seismologist at a small
college in Mobile, Ala., to warn the world of what was to come.
   ``It could cause great devastation,'' Louis Eisele predicted.
``You can expect tidal waves from this one.''
   The earthquake had been felt by Eisele's Spring Hill College
seismograph. It said the temblor was centered about 3,600 miles
northwest of Mobile, in the Gulf of Alaska or near Kodiak Island.
   At 8.5 on the Richter scale, the 1964 earthquake was one of the
strongest on record.
   In the words of the U.S. Geological Survey: ``The entire earth
vibrated like a tuning fork.''
   The quake started at 5:36 p.m. Alaska Standard Time on March 27.
Centered under a glaciated peninsula 75 miles east of Anchorage, it
altered 100,000 square miles of landscape.
   Along a 600-mile arc from Cape Yakataga on the eastern Gulf of
Alaska to the Trinity Islands southwest of Kodiak, the land to the
north subsided by as much as six feet; to the south it rose by as
much as 50 feet.
   Land shifted horizontally as much as 70 feet in several places
south of Seward, tangling railroad tracks, splitting roads, yanking
down buildings.
   Property damage exceeded $311 million.
   The earthquake and the seismic sea waves it spawned killed 114
people in Alaska. More than a dozen others died at DePoe Bay, Ore.,
and Crescent City, Calif., when seismic waves crashed ashore at
those communities.
   In the aftermath came the stories of the lucky and the luckless.
Often, merest circumstance determined who died and who survived.
   In Anchorage, William Tobin had just parked his car outside the
new J.C. Penney Building when he felt a jolt. He stepped from his
car ready to have words with another driver.
   ``I thought some stupid jerk had rammed me from behind,'' says
Tobin, managing editor of the Anchorage Times.
   As he got out, a huge slab of the building crashed down,
flattening his car.
   Nine people in Anchorage weren't so lucky.
   In Valdez, many residents had turned out as usual to watch the
freighter Chena disgorge its cargo. The arrival of the 400-foot
ship always was something special for Valdez folks, and on this day
_ typically _ a crowd was on hand as longshoremen unloaded the
vessel.
   In an eternity that lasted only moments, Valdez was shaken
unmercifully, and the Chena began wallowing insanely, snapping her
mooring lines. The dock heaved, rocked, shook and then pitched into
the water, carrying onlookers and warehouses.
   The Chena survived; the Valdez waterfront and most of the
business district were obliterated by collapsing ground and seismic
waves.
   Thirty-one people died.
   In Kodiak, Norman Holm and his son were fishing for herring from
a skiff in the harbor. Holm could not understand why he suddenly
lost control of the small boat.
   ``I just couldn't make it respond. It kept bouncing, bouncing,''
he says.
   When the movement subsided, Holm headed to the dock. He and his
son, Oliver, helped secure several fishing boats which had broken
loose. He checked the lines of his own 72-foot Neptune.
   The level of water in the harbor started fluctuating wildly, and
then Holm heard ``the terrible roar of water coming up the channel,
the frightening noise of docks and buildings collapsing.''
   The Holms sprinted for shore as the dock creaked and groaned
under the pressure of the rising water. At the head of the dock,
Holm fought the impulse to seek safety atop an eight-foot wooden
tank used to keep crabs alive. He and his son raced about 150 yards
farther to the base of Pillar Mountain, the hill which forms
Kodiak's backdrop.
   With the sound of bedlam in the harbor behind them, they clawed
their way up the steep slope to an elevation of about 150 feet.
Holm was too exhausted to go farther. He told his son to go on, but
the boy stayed with his father.
   The two watched in awe as huge waves battered Kodiak for six
hours. The city lost most of its seafood processing industry, 75
percent of its business district and half its fishing fleet _
including the good ship Neptune. The wooden crab tank vanished.
   Nineteen people died.
   In Chenega, Avis Anderson was preparing to take a bath when the
tiny Prince William Sound village began shaking. She scooped up her
two sons, and dashed up a forest trail to the safety of a high
knoll.
   Behind her she could hear the sound of waves estimated up to 80
feet tall smashing the village only 70 miles from the quake's
epicenter. Of the 20 buildings in the town, only the school was
spared.
   Twenty-three people died, including Anderson's daughter,
parents, a grandmother, an uncle and an aunt.
   ``I had horrible, horrible nightmares for almost 20 years,'' she
says. ``Always they were the same. I would be climbing up and up,
and the waves would be creeping higher and higher.''

<TEXT>
   More than 300 anti-abortion protesters
remained in jail this morning, where their leader claimed police
used excessive force in making arrests and accused the media of a
``pro-death'' bias.
   The Operation Rescue protesters spent Easter behind bars,
sometimes singing hymns, refusing to take the legal steps that
would have allowed them to leave jail because they wanted to
dramatize their cause.
   The group's jailed leader, Randall Terry, spent part of the day
calling journalists to complain that they failed to show pictures
of aborted fetuses that might show the public what abortion really
entails.
   He opened the New York-based group's Holy Week protests Thursday
by appearing at a news conference with a small, white coffin that
contained what he said was an aborted 19-week-old fetus. After
opening the coffin lid he left, challenging the media to televise
the remains.
   ``The media is the greatest perpetrator of this holocaust
because they're hiding the truth from the public,'' Terry said
Sunday. ``It's not a matter of taste. The majority of the media
elite are pro-death and reduce this to a war of words, and it's a
war of bodies, dead bodies.''
   The protesters are the latest of more than 21,000 to be arrested
nationally since 1987, mostly for blocking clinics where abortions
are performed.
   As part of their effort to focus attention on the Supreme
Court's reconsideration of its 1973 decision legalizing abortion,
252 men and at least 50 women stayed in jail Sunday by refusing to
provide their names to police or to sign misdemeanor trespassing
citations.
   Terry, a former car salesman, and three others could face more
serious charges: They remained jailed today for investigation of
felony conspiracy to encourage others to commit a crime.
   ``This felony charge is a joke,'' he said. ``How can you have a
felony conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor trespass? That's
ludicrous.''
   He alleged Los Angeles police used excessive force when they
arrested 750 protesters during a six-hour standoff outside a clinic
Saturday. More than 1,000 anti-abortion activists were arrested
during three days of protests in Cypress, Long Beach and Los
Angeles.
   Officers' treatment of protesters, he charged, ``was completely
uncalled for and unprofessional. You don't twist people's arms to
the point were they're screaming in pain and sticking two fingers
up their nose.''
   One demonstrator's arm and wrist were broken in a scuffle with
police Saturday, Operation Rescue said. Los Angeles police Cmdr.
William Booth said Sunday that the group was exaggerating the
incidents.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates said officers used a ``pain compliance
hold'' in the arrests. And he said he would ask the city attorney
to sue Operation Rescue for the $60,000 to $100,000 the
demonstration cost the city.

<HEAD>Federal Reserve Bank Sees Surplus Due To Drug Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cash surplus at the Federal Reserve Bank
here has jumped from $165 million in 1985 to $3.8 billion in 1988,
and authorities believe the 23-fold increase is largely because of
laundered drug money moving through banks.
   ``It is a good indicator that we are awash with dope money being
laundered through Los Angeles, not just from the Los Angeles area
but from elsewhere in the country,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner
said.
   ``Staggering amounts of cash are being funneled into the Los
Angeles area for laundering here.''
   Despite hefty fines levied against some of the state's largest
financial institutions, drug officials say the illegal money is
being funneled into the Federal Reserve after being laundered
through banks.
   Laundering is the process of passing money through enough
transactions that it is hard to trace. It may arrive at a bank as a
legitimate business deposit. The money may then be transferred to
foreign bank accounts controlled by drug kingpins without
traffickers having to smuggle cash out of the country.
   Miami, which had a reputation of being the hub for drug
laundering, saw its Federal Reserve surplus drop from a high of $6
billion in 1985 to $4.8 billion in 1988, still the largest surplus
in the country.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Ralph Lochridge
said the trend ``validates Los Angeles as the new money-laundering
and drug financial center in the United States.''
   The Federal Reserve System is the nation's central bank,
managing the money supply by controlling how much cash member banks
must keep liquid instead of loaning out. About 40 percent of the
nation's banks belong to the Federal Reserve System.
   When deposits at a Federal Reserve district branch exceed the
branch's cash shipments back to its member banks, that district is
said to have a cash surplus.
   Only 10 of the 35 branches of the Federal Reserve reported cash
surpluses last year. After Miami and Los Angeles, the others are
Jacksonville, Fla., with a $1.9 billion surplus; San Antonio, $511
million; El Paso, Texas, $484 million; Nashville, Tenn., $399
million; Denver, $367 million; New Orleans, $118 million; Helena,
Mont., $45 million; and Salt Lake City, $15 million.

<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal's Motherland Party
suffered a crushing defeat in nationwide local elections, winning
only three mayoral races in Turkey's 67 provincial capitals,
unofficial returns showed today.
   The governing party finished third in the provincial assembly
elections behind the leftist Social Democrat Populist Party, the
chief opposition group, and the conservative True Path Party of
former six-time Premier Suleyman Demirel, according to nearly
complete tallies provided by state radio and the Anatolia news
agency.
   Opposition parties described Sunday's elections as a referendum
on Ozal's free-market economic policies. Ozal had said he would
quit if opposition gains were large enough to make it difficult for
him to govern.
   But today, Ozal said he would stay on until the next elections
scheduled for 1992. ``he nation gave us a mandate until 1992, we
will be serving the nation until then,''the 61-year-old premier
told a news conference.
   ``The people knew the party in power would not change as a
result of these elections. They wanted to give us a message: to
bring down inflation faster,'' Ozal said.
   He said ``A little warning was intended by the voters but it
went a bit too far.''
   Ozal promised changes in the Cabinet sometime this week.
   Voters elected more than 326,000 mayors, provincial assembly
members, city council members, village leaders and neighborhood
representatives.
   In the provincial assembly elections, the Social Democrats
gained 28 percent of the nationwide vote, and the True Path had
25.5 percent, the returns showed. Ozal's party was in third place
with 22 percent.
   Among the smaller parties, the Democratic Left Party of former
Premier Bulent Ecevit got 9 percent, the Moslem fundamentalist
Prosperity Party 9.5 percent, the Nationalist Labor Party 4.5
percent, the rightist Reformist Democracy Party 1 percent, and the
rest was scattered among independent candidates.
   Demirel said Ozal should quit because of the results.
   ``He said he would pack up and go, and if he is true to his
word, he should do so,'' Demirel told reporters. ``I am sure he
will not try to run the country on support based on 22 percent of
the votes.''
   Erdal Inonu, who heads the Social Democrat Populist Party, also
claimed a win over the Motherland Party.
   Inonu, a nuclear physics professor turned politician, declared,
``The people accomplished a real spring cleaning, making it clear
who they wanted to see in power.''
   Several Motherland members asked for early parliamentary
elections. ``Not early but immediate elections should be held,''
said Fahrettin Kurt, minister of energy.
   Five years ago in local assembly elections, Motherland gained 41
percent of the vote, the Social Democrat Populists won 22 percent,
and the True Path won 13 percent. The rest of the votes were
divided between three other parties.
   On Sunday, the Social Democrats won 30 mayorships out of 53
already decided; the True Path won 15 and the Motherland party won
three. In the last local elections, the Motherland Party captured
54 mayorships in the 67 provincial capitals. Also on the ballots
Sunday were mayor's races in 1,917 small towns.
   Social Democrat candidates ousted Motherland mayors in Turkey's
three largest cities: Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.
   Political analysts attributed Ozal's loss to inflation, which
reached 75 percent last year, his family's high-spending lifestyle,
charges of nepotism, and allegations of corruption in high places.
   Ballots are counted by hand. Complete unofficial results are not
expected until Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Media reports said Iran's navy seized a
yacht with as many as five members of Kuwait's royal family and
four Britons aboard, but officials in Kuwait, Bahrain and Britain
denied knowledge of the incident.
   Diplomatic sources in Dubai said Iranians have told them the
vessel was taken when it strayed into Iranian waters, but that
``the boat and its occupants have been released.''
   Media reports said members of the Kuwaiti royal family were
aboard the boat, but one diplomatic source said he was told by an
Iranian diplomat that no Kuwaiti royal family members were aboard.
   Diplomatic sources told The Associated Press the boat had four
British male crew and technicians and two prominent Arabs. The
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not elaborate
on their identity.
   Tehran made no public comment on the reports, which surfaced
Sunday in a report by the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Anbaa.
   The newspaper reported the yacht was seized by the Iranians in
the Persian Gulf on Thursday while sailing from Bahrain to Kuwait.
   The Independent Television News of Britain quoted diplomatic
sources in Kuwait as saying the royal family members were Kuwaitis
and the four Britons were women.
   The British Foreign Office said: ``All our investigations and
inquiries have drawn a complete blank.''
   Asked whether that meant no yacht was seized, a Foreign Office
said: ``Not that we can tell.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Officials in Kuwait and Bahrain also denied knowledge of the
reported seizure.
   Shipping executives and fishermen in Kuwait have referred to
cases of ``piracy'' in which they say Iranians have captured at
least two expensive boats in recent months. The boats' occupants
reportedly were free unharmed.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide Liquor-Labeling Issue in North Dakota Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may impose labelng and reporting requirements on
liquor sold at U.S. military bases within their borders.
   The court said it will review a ruling that such North Dakota
regulation of liquor sold at two military bases in that state
violates federal policy.
   A North Dakota law requires all liquor sold in the state to be
distributed through a state-controlled system.
   State officials sought to require out-of-state liquor
distributors to put a label on each bottle sold at the Grand Forks
and Minot Air Force Bases. The labels were to say the liquor is for
consumption only at the military installations.
   The state also wanted suppliers to report monthly on how much
liquor they shipped into the state.
   The rules were designed to prevent liquor intended for the two
military enclaves from being sold elsewhere in North Dakota.
   The federal government challenged the regulations, arguing they
violated a federal policy aimed at assuring liquor sold at clubs
and stores on military bases would be purchased by the government
for the lowest possible price. Profits from the military base sales
are used to pay for recreational activities.
   Federal officials said it could cost the government $200,000 to
$250,000 more each year if the labeling and reporting regulations
were enforced in North Dakota. They said the rules would force them
to purchase more liquor from North Dakota distributors at higher
prices.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last September that
the state regulations must give way to the federal policy.
   The appeals court rejected the state's argument that it was
empowered to impose the regulations by the 21st Amendment to the
Constitution, which repealed Prohibition and gave states sweeping
control over liquor distribution.
   ``We conclude that the 21st Amendment provides no basis for
regulating the means by which Congress has sought to order military
liquor procurement and to provide for the welfare and morale
activities of military personnel,'' the appeals court said.
   The National Beer Wholesalers' Association supported North
Dakota's appeal. The association said there is ``uncontradicted
evidence ... that North Dakota was seriously concerned about the
problem of diversion of liquor from military reservations.''
   The case is North Dakota vs. U.S., 88-926.

<TEXT>
   China's foreign minister said today some U.S.
officials were ill-informed about human rights questions in China
and threatened progress toward close bilateral relations.
   On Sino-Soviet relations, meanwhile, Qian Qichen told reporters
that even after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visits China in
May, there will be some way to go before differences between the
two countries are resolved.
   Since diplomatic ties were formed a decade ago, relations
between the United States and China ``enjoy vast potential and the
prospects are very good,'' Qian said.
   But he warned against interference in Chinese internal matters
that he said ``was not in the interest of friendly relations.''
   Qian called for a ``new pattern'' of relations based on mutual
trust, and had sharp words for members of the U.S. Congress who
have criticized China's lack of democratic reform and its human
rights record in Tibet.
   ``A small number of people in the American Congress are actually
very ill-informed about the situation in Tibet. They have very
strong prejudice.''
   The Chinese government last week criticized both the European
Parliament and the U.S. Congress for statements over the
declaration of martial law in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa
following pro-independence riots there this month.
   Human rights, Qian said, are a matter of basic questions such as
providing adequate food and education and ``are inseparable with
the actual condition of the country involved.''
   He also said U.S. congressional criticisms of China's family
planning policies that try to keep couples from having more than
one child were ``fairly absurd.''
   The United States in recent years has withheld funds for U.N.
family planning programs on the grounds that money going to China
backs up strict birth control policies that have led to forced
abortions.
   Qian said China, which supports the anti-Vietnamese resistance
in Cambodia, backs the dispatch of a U.N. peacekeeping force after
Vietnam ends its 10-year occupation. But, he said, China is not
preparing to send peace troops to Cambodia.
   The question of Cambodia will be high on the agenda when
Gorbachev meets Chinese leaders in Beijing, Qian said.
   The summit, the first between the two countries in 30 years,
will normalize long-strained relations, Qian said, but doesn't mean
that all major obstacles to better relations will be removed.
   Soviet support for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia is regarded by
China as the most serious obstacle to better ties between Beijing
and Moscow.

<HEAD>Justices Let Stand Damage Award to Former Oregon Medical Examiner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a $300,000
award won by Oregon's former chief medical examiner from the woman
who fired him following news reports that he had sold body parts to
finance parties in the morgue.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments by
Kristine Gebbie, administrator of the State Health Division, aimed
at overturning the award won by William J. Brady.
   A federal jury ruled that Gebbie deprived Brady of his
constitutionally protected liberty interests without due process of
law when she fired him in 1985.
   Brady had maintained a bank account, in his name but with the
knowledge of everyone in his office, for money paid for pituitary
glands and other body parts removed during autopsies in the state
coroner's office.
   The money was used for various amenities in the medical
examiner's office.
   When Gebbie announced Brady's firing on Oct. 3, 1985, she issued
a press release in which she said Brady had ``knowingly violated
public trust and confidence'' through his ``systematic 16-year
diversion of public funds.''
   In upholding the jury verdict last Oct. 31, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said Brady presented undisputed evidence that
Gebbie charged him with:
   _Violating the public trust.
   _Diverting state funds for his own use.
   _Establishing a ``slush fund.''
   _Causing the state to be billed for toxicological reports made
in connection with private autopsies he performed.
   The appeals court added, ``There was sufficient evidence
presented from which a jury could reasonably infer that the charges
were both contested and false.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Oregon Solicitor General Virginia
Linder argued for Gebbie that the appeals court ruling places
government employers in an ``untenable position.''
   The appeal said the 9th Circuit court's ruling gives no clear
guidelines for ``government's responsiveness to the performance of
its high-level officials and its ability to speak to the public it
serves.''
   The appeal also contended that Gebbie was entitled to qualified
immunity from Brady's lawsuit because ``she acted in unquestioned
good faith and the law concerning liberty interests and
name-clearing hearings is far from settled.''
   The case is Gebbie vs. Brady, 88-1299.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Dismissal of Suit Against Pennsylvania Newspapers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to review a
Pennsylvania judge's lawsuit against two newspapers that reported
on what was to have been a confidential state investigation of him.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed
state Supreme Court Justice Rolf Larsen's suit against The
Philadelphia Inquirer and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
   As a result of various articles appearing in both newspapers
about Larsen, the state's Judicial Inquiry and Review Board began
an investigation in mid-1982.
   In his suit, Larsen said the articles portrayed him as being
involved in ``political activity, racism, favoritism and
influence-peddling.''
   Completed in May 1983, the state board's investigation
exonerated Larsen of any wrongdoing.
   During the investigation, both newspapers published reports
about the board's supposedly secret proceedings. Some articles even
contained excerpts of hearing transcripts.
   Those reports were the basis of Larsen's suit, in which he
charged the newspapers with obtaining the transcripts illegally and
publishing only selected excerpts that placed him in a false light.
   The suit, which sought monetary damages, also claimed that the
articles invaded Larsen's privacy and violated the confidentiality
provisions of state law.
   A state trial judge dismissed most of the lawsuit's counts, and
that dismissal was upheld by a state appeals court.
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1978 ruling by the
nation's highest court in a Virginia case.
   In that decision, the justices said the free-press protections
in the Constitution's First Amendment mean newspapers cannot be
criminally punished for publishing truthful information about
secret governmental proceedings.
   The decision struck down a Virginia law that made it a crime to
report about a state judicial commission's confidential
investigations into judges' fitness to hold office.
   The Pennsylvania appeals court ruled that allowing Larsen's
civil suit would, like Virginia's criminal law, violate free-press
rights.
   ``The imposition of monetary damages (civil sanctions) can be
just as inimical to and an encroachment of one's First Amendment
guarantees as criminal sanctions,'' the state court said.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused to hear Larsen's ensuing
appeal last Oct. 31.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Larsen argued that the
state courts wrongly concluded that the newspapers' free-press
rights would be harmed if Larsen were allowed to sue over
violations of state confidentiality provisions.
   Lawyers for the newspapers urged the justices to reject the
appeal. They noted, among other things, that the state court
rulings left Larsen free to amend his complaint to explain his
assertion that confidential information was obtained ``illegally.''
   The case is Larsen vs. Philadelphia Newspapers, 88-1274.

   The central part of the nation is basking in temperatures more
like early summer than early spring as a pair of weather systems
pull air up from the Gulf of Mexico.
   Temperatures in the 70s and 80s, as much as 30 degrees warmer
than normal, were predicted today over the Great Lakes, the Ohio
Valley, the central half of the Mississippi Valley and the central
Plains.
   On Sunday, Fort Wayne, Ind., tied its record of 75 degrees and
Ottumwa, Iowa, tied its record of 78. Dodge City, Kan., hit a
non-record 85 degrees and Moline, Ill., hit a non-record 80. In
Chicago, it was 76, one degree shy of the record.
   But the warmth will gradually diminish and move eastward over
the next couple of days, with the central states cooling by 10 to
20 degrees and the East Coast warming, said Lyle Alexander of the
National Weather Service's public service unit in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``The eastern seaboard should be expecting temperatures around
70 through Friday, especially around the Washington area,'' he said
today.
   The warm air is being pumped northward by the clockwise flow
around a high pressure area off the central Atlantic Coast and the
counterclockwise flow around a low over Texas, he said.

   Maverick populist Boris N. Yeltsin savored his
political comeback today as election officials announced he had
trounced a Communist Party loyalist for Moscow's sole at-large seat
in the new national legislature.
   ``It's hard to say what my spirit is more full of, joy or
concern about what I realistically can do to help Muscovites,'' the
58-year-old Yeltsin told several hundred applauding workers at the
State Construction Committee, where he is first deputy chairman.
   Igor N. Orlov, chairman of Moscow's election commission, said
Yeltsin won 89.4 percent of the vote Sunday. His opponent, Yevgeny
Brakov, received 6.9 percent of the vote.
   Yeltsin, who was ousted as Moscow Communist Party boss in 1987,
has accused the party's elite of trying to discredit him and had
said he feared votes might be tampered with to cheat him out of
victory.
   The former protege of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev campaigned
against the privileges afforded high-ranking Soviet officials and
called for faster reforms to improve living standards for everyone.
   His opponent, Brakov, the 51-year-old director of the ZIL
limousine plant, has carefully followed the party line in most
matters. The cars made at his factory are a prized perquisite of
high-ranking officials.
   Brakov had said his top priority is to end food shortages by
providing more machinery to farmers and improving storage and
processing facilities.
   Large pro-Yeltsin rallies were held in the capital in the
closing days of the campaign and the former Moscow party leader
became something of a symbol for people expressing a desire for
truly representative government.
   ocal Moscow election officials spent all night counting votes
after Sunday's election for the new Congress of People's Deputies _
the country's first contested elections in more than 70 years.
   ``We have been sitting and waiting since last evening for the
final votes; we are unshaven and have had no sleep,'' Viktor
Kubivsky, a member of Moscow's Volgograd district, said by
telephone.
   Andrei Rudyakov, a city council member, said the votes,
initially counted at local election districts, were being recounted
at the city election headquarters and the information was fed into
computers for final tabulation.
   He said representatives of Yeltsin and Brakov were at the
council building to oversee the recount.
   Of more than 2,000 Soviets interviewed by Western correspondents
at polling places after the voting, 1,734 were for Yeltsin and 162
for Brakov. Others either refused to disclose how they voted or
expressed opposition to either candidate.
   After casting his ballot, Yeltsin claimed many Soviets were
worried about voting fraud, and he complained that the elections
were not completely democratic.
   ``People are worried about the election results, worried that
there will be deviations at election stations during vote
counting,'' he told reporters. ``Everything is troubling them.''
   He said the campaign was ``not fully democratic'' but was a
``big step forward'' from previous one-candidate balloting. He said
the real test of democracy will be whether the vote count is fair.
   Gorbachev, who brought Yeltsin into Communist Party leadership
in 1985 and two years later oversaw his ouster on charges of making
political mistakes and displaying personal ambition, said criticism
of party officials is normal during campaigns.

<TEXT>
   The government today released a report
that accused an aide to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of links to the
assassination of his mother. Officials said investigators later
found the aide was not involved.
   The findings of a special commission report on Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi's 1984 slaying were withheld for three years, but a
newspaper account of the report prompted opposition legislators to
demand its release.
   When Rajiv Gandhi initially refused, opposition legislators
walked out of Parliament and some were suspended for a week for
misbehavior.
   The commission report, released to Parliament, accused Rajendra
Kumar Dhawan, Mrs. Gandhi's personal secretary, of facilitating the
assassination. But it added: ``The possiblity of someone else being
involved along with Mr. Dhawan cannot be excluded.''
   A government memorandum also released today said investigators
had checked the accusations and found Dhawan ``had no hand in the
conspiracy for the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi and that there was
nothing to indicate that Mr. Dhawan was in any way involved in the
crime or conspiracy.''
   Dhawan, 52, left his post shortly after Mrs. Gandhi's death but
returned to government last month as a key adviser to Rajiv Gandhi.
He was not immediately available for comment.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot in the garden of her New Delhi residence by
two Sikh bodyguards as she walked to a television interview.
   One of the Sikhs, Beant Singh, was shot and killed by other
bodyguards minutes after the assassination, and the other, Satwant
Singh, was convicted of murder and hanged on Jan. 6. A third Sikh,
Kehar Singh, was convicted of conspiracy and also hanged.
   In releasing the report to Parliament, Home Minister Buta Singh
said another special investigating team also had ``unraveled a
conspiracy.'' He said additional charges would be filed, but did
not say when or against whom.
   According to the report, the commission did not rule out
involvement of an unspecified foreign agency that might have used
the assassins ``as unwitting instruments.''
   India has long accused neighboring Pakistan of training and
arming Sikh militants. Pakistan has denied the charge.
   Parliament passed a resolution in 1986 allowing the government
to withhold the report in the interest of national security. But on
March 14, the Indian Express newspaper published parts of the
report that alleged Dhawan lied during questioning and gave
unconvincing explanations about entries in his diary, including the
name of one of Mrs. Gandhi's assassins.
   Gandhi released the report only after members of his Congress
Party threatened to do so.
   The government says Mrs. Gandhi was killed in revenge for an
army raid she ordered on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest
Sikh shrine.
   At least 1,200 people, many of them Sikhs, were killed in the
June 1984 raid, which was aimed at ousting Sikh extremists who had
turned the shrine into an armed fortress.
   Sikh militants began fighting in 1982 for an independent
homeland.
   Sikhs, who comprise 2 percent of India's 880 million people,
claim discrimination by the Hindus, who make up 80 percent of the
population.

<TEXT>
   Iran's main rebel opposition group said
today that the sister of its leader, Massoud Rajavi, has been
executed after being tortured in an Iranian prison.
   Tehran had no immediate comment on the allegation.
   In a statement sent to The Associated Press in Nicosia, the
Mujahedeen Khalq, or the People's Warriors, said Monireh Rajavi was
arrested with her husband, Asghar Nazemi, in 1982.
   The statement said the couple's only offense was that the woman
was the sister of Rajavi, who in addition to being the Mujahadeen
Khalq's leader, also is commander of the National Liberation Army,
a coalition of Iranian dissident factions based in Iraq.
   It said Nazemi was executed in 1985 and his wife was tortured
for several years before being executed. She was 38 years old, the
statement said.
   The rebels did not identify the prison where she was held or
give the date and method of the alleged execution. Iranians usually
execute women by firing squads. Men are usually hanged.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq statement said the couple has two daughters
but it did not say where they live or how old they are.
   The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International, as
well as other human rights organizations and some governments have
condemned Iran for executing thousands of political prisoners since
August. In that month authorities began a crackdown against
dissidents after a cease-fire halted eight years of war with Iraq.
   The Tehran government has said most people executed recently
were drug traffickers.

<HEAD>Court Will Restudy Death Penalty Issue in Pennsylvania Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said today it will restudy
how far states may go in limiting a jury's discretion to choose
life or death for convicted murderers.
   The court agreed to decide whether Pennsylvania's death penalty
law violates the Constitution by improperly limiting jury
discretion.
   It will hear an appeal by Scott Wayne Blystone, sentenced to die
for a Sept. 9, 1983, murder committed during a robbery.
   Blystone and three others picked up hitchhiker Dalton Charles
Smithburger Jr. in Fayette County. The jury found that Blystone
robbed the man of $13 and then fatally shot him in the back of the
head.
   The same jury sentencted Blystone to death.
   Pennsylvania's death penalty statute says, ``The verdict must be
a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one
aggravating circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance.''
   The only aggravating factor the jury found was that Blystone
killed Smithburger during a felony _ namely robbery.
   Blystone did not submit any mitigating factors during the
sentencing phase of the case.
   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled last October that the state
law does not violate the U.S. Supreme Court's prohibition against
the mandatory death penalty.
   The state court said under the Pennsylvania law ``an individual
may thwart the imposition of the death penalty by offering evidence
of mitigating circumstances concerning his character, record and
the circumstances of the offense. Since (Blystone) refused to
present any evidence of mitigation, there was nothing to block''
imposition of the death penalty.
   The Supreme Court in 1978 said juries may not be precluded from
considering mitigating evidence.
   Lawyers for Blystone said the Pennsylvania law works like a
mandatory capital punishment act because the jury is misled into
believing it has a moral duty to impose the death penalty in such
cases.
   Pennsylvania law enforcement officials argued that the state
death penalty statute is constitutional because, despite its
mandatory language, nothing prevents the defendant from presenting
mitigating evidence to offset the presentation of aggravating
circumstances.
   The case is Blystone vs. Pennsylvania, 88-6222.

<TEXT>
   Voters gave populist reformer Boris N. Yeltsin a
resounding victory in his campaign against top-level privilege and
economic failures that have emptied Soviet store shelves, according
to election results announced today.
   Yeltsin won 89.4 percent of the vote in his race to represent
the city he once ran as Communist Party chief, said Igor N. Orlov,
chairman of Moscow's election commission.
   Yeltsin's opponent in Sunday's balloting for a new national
legislature, the more traditional party loyalist Yevgeny Brakov,
received 6.9 percent of the vote, Orlov told reporters.
   The 58-year-old Yeltsin had become the most visible symbol of
opposition to the party establishment in Sunday's elections _ the
first time Soviet voters had a choice of candidates in seven
decades.
   Yeltsin's race for the sole at-large Moscow seat typified the
more democratic politics that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
brought to the Soviet Union.
   ``Boris Yeltsin ... was named a People's Deputy of the U.S.S.R.
from Moscow's city national territorial district No. 1,'' the
official Tass news agency said.
   Hundreds of workers applauded Yeltsin today when he spoke the
State Construction Committee, where he is first deputy chairman.
   ``It's hard to say what my spirit is more full of, joy or
concern about what I realistically can do to help Muscovites,''
Yeltsin said.
   Yeltsin pledged to quit his job in the Construction Committee
and be a full-time legislator in the new 2,250-seat Congress of
People's Deputies. Voters elected 1,500 deputies Sunday, and the
rest are being chosen separately by members of
officially-sanctioned organizations.
   Yeltsin was fired as Moscow party boss in November 1987 after
criticizing the party's style of leadership and warning that a
Stalin-like cult of personality could form around Gorbachev. He
lost his position as a candidate member of the ruling Politburo and
was transferred to the State Construction Committee.
   He campaigned against the special supplies of food and consumer
goods, cars and drivers and other services that Moscow government
and party officials receive, and criticized what he said were
economic reform efforts that did not go far enough.
   In other races in Moscow, reform-economist Oleg T. Bogomolov and
Ilya I. Zaslavsky, an activist for the handicapped, won seats to
the congress. Roy A. Medvedev, a historian whose work went against
the official grain before Gorbachev, will face a runoff election.
   The new congress will meet once a year to choose the country's
president and elect about 400 of its own members to a new full-time
legislature, the Supreme Soviet.
   Yeltsin's campaign drew thousands of enthusiastic supporters who
held marches and demonstrations in the weeks just prior to the
election.
   Asked if he had received congratulations from Gorbachev, Yeltsin
said, ``that's unlikely, but I would be very happy and thank him
from the bottom of my heart.''
   He reiterated that he does not see himself as a political
opponent of the Soviet leader.
   In 74 percent of Sunday's races, voters had a choice between two
or more candidates, the Central Election Commission said. However,
82 percent of the candidates were Communist Party members, the
weekly Moscow News reported, guaranteeing the Communists will
dominate the new assembly.
   Still, this was the first time since the Soviet Union's earliest
days that the people were afforded a choice.
   The Central Election Commission said about 190 million of the
Soviet Union's 285 million people were eligible to vote. Tass said
more than 80 percent of Moscow's 6.7 million eligible voters took
part in the election.
   The Kremlin faced strong challenges from independent candidates
in republics like Lithuania where nationalist sentiments are strong.
   In the Baltic republic, the grassroots Sajudis or Lithuanian
Restructuring Movement said unofficial returns showed its
candidates finished strongly against those endorsed by the
Communist Party.
   Sajudis officials claimed their 39 candidates in Lithuania's 42
electoral districts either finished first or forced runoff
elections in districts where no candidate gained a majority.
   Gorbachev, who came to power in 1985, is assured of a seat in
the new congress, and the elections are unlikely to produce any
major upheaval in the power structure.
   The Soviet president, who with his wife Raisa voted at Moscow's
Institute of Chemical Physics, told reporters Sunday the
occasionally boisterous campaign caused by the contested elections
was just what the Kremlin leadership wanted.
   ``The electoral law that we passed has justified our hopes,''
Gorbachev said. ``It has advanced the political thought and social
activity of the people, and this is what we wanted to achieve.''
   Elections in the Soviet Union were until Sunday carefully
choreographed rituals in which practically all eligible voters were
said to turn out and those running got 99.9 percent of the vote.
Some Soviets expressed satisfaction at finally having a choice, but
there were also objections.
   ``I think the quality of our leaders will improve because now we
have a real democracy,'' said Dr. Valentina Agababova as she sat on
a windowsill at voting precinct No. 5 in Moscow's Sverdlovsk
district, crossing out names of candidates she opposed.
   But in Moscow's Gagarin district, where 12 candidates were
running, ``some old people have gotten upset about having so many
choices,'' said elections secretary Natalya Safonkina.
   The last elections in which most Russians had a choice occurred
weeks after the November 1917 revolution that swept Lenin and the
Bolsheviks to power. The Communists had since allowed just one
approved candidate to run for each seat.

<HEAD>Former Nippon Telephone Company President Charged With Bribery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today filed bribery charges against the
former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's
telecommunications giant, in a stock-trading scandal that has
rocked the government.
   Hisashi Shinto violated laws prohibiting company workers from
receiving money and valuables in exchange for favors, the Tokyo
public prosecutors office charged today.
   The affair involves sales by a Tokyo-based information
conglomerate, Recruit Co., of unlisted shares in a real estate
subsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos Co., to more than 150 government
officials, politicians and executives. Recipients of the shares
reaped huge profits after the stock price soared later in
over-the-counter trading.
   Prosecutors also filed today charged Hiromasa Ezoe, former
chairman of the information conglomerate, and his aide, Hiroshi
Kobayashi, with bribing Shinto. Kobayashi allegedly was involved in
financing the transactions as president of First Finance Co., a
second Recruit subsidiary.
   The charges were filed after the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended
trading today, but share prices of the Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp. already had plummeted to an all-time low before the
closing. The company was once at the top of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, with total assets estimated at over $1 billion.
   Prosecutors allege Shinto helped Recruit expand its
telecommumication business in return for the stocks.
   Shinto initially denied knowledge of the stock deal but later
admitted his involvement and resigned from his position at the head
of the telecommunications monopoly.
   Prosecutors have arrested 12 people on suspicion of giving or
taking bribes or violating security laws. At least 17 leading
politicians _ including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita _ have been
linked to the scandal, but none has been arrested.
   Since the scandal surfaced in July, the popularity of
Takeshita's administration has suffered. Recent polls conducted by
major newspapers showed the prime minister's popularity plunged to
15 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 1987.
   Members of the political opposition have demanded he resign.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that a public hospital does not violate the constitutionally
required separation of church and state by having a chaplain on its
payroll.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear an appeal by three
Iowa atheists who said taxpayers should not be forced to fund a
chaplain's salary at a county-run hospital.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September upheld the
employment of a chaplain at Polk County's Broadlawns Medical Center
in Des Moines.
   Three avowed atheists _ Larry Henry Carter, his daughter,
Courtney, and Maurice LaBelle _ said their rights were violated
because the government was sponsoring religious activity.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1983 that paying chaplains to lead
daily prayers in Congress and state legislatures does not violate
the Constitution. The court cited a long tradition, 200 years old
in the case of Congress, to support its ruling.
   The Iowa atheists noted that the chaplain at Broadlawns, Maggie
Alzeno Rogers, was hired in 1985 and her duties are more than
ceremonial.
   A deacon of the United Church of Christ, Ms. Rogers counsels
patients, their families and hospital workers and conducts
religious services and Bible study classes at the hospital. She is
paid $23,000 a year.
   The 8th Circuit court said her duties serve a secular purpose,
enhancing the hospital's ``wholistic treatment approach.''
   ``The purpose of the chaplaincy was the same as that of the
hospital generally, to help patients get well or at least to
provide the best care possible for those who would not get well,''
the appeals court said.
   It added that there was evidence Ms. Rogers' presence did not
advance religion unconstitutionally because she refrained from
proselytizing _ seeking religious converts.
   The appeals court also said Ms. Rogers may have reduced
entanglement between the church and state at the hospital because
there is less need for hospital officials to supervise volunteer
chaplains who worked at Broadlawns before she was hired.
   It is part of Ms. Rogers' job to make sure that the volunteer
chaplains are not proselytizing, the appeals court said.
   It also noted that many patients at the hospital are committed
involuntarily or are prisoners treated there. Comparing Ms. Rogers
to a military chaplain, the appeals court said many patients would
have no alternative religious counseling if she were not available.
   The appeals court said, however, that Ms. Rogers should be
permitted to give only secular counseling to hospital employees.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Said it will restudy how far states may go in limiting a
jury's discretion to choose life or death for convicted murderers.
   The court agreed to decide whether Pennsylvania's death penalty
law violates the Constitution by improperly limiting jury
discretion.
   Pennsylvania's death penalty statute says: ``The verdict must be
a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one
aggravating circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance.''
   _ Refused to review a Pennsylvania judge's lawsuit against two
newspapers that reported on what was to have been a confidential
state investigation of him.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed
state Supreme Court Justice Rolf Larsen's suit against The
Philadelphia Inquirer and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
   _ Agreed to decide whether states may impose labeling and
reporting requirements on liquor sold at U.S. military bases within
their borders.
   The court said it will review a ruling that such North Dakota
regulations of liquor sold at two military bases in that state
violates federal policy.
   _ Let stand a $300,000 award won by Oregon's former chief
medical examiner from the woman who fired him following news
reports that he had sold body parts to finance parties in the
morgue.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments by
Kristine Gebbie, administrator of the State Health Division, aimed
at overturning the award won by William J. Brady.
   A federal jury ruled that Gebbie deprived Brady of his
constitutionally protected liberty interests without due process of
law when she fired him in 1985.
   The chaplain case is Carter vs. Broadlawns Medical Center,
88-1286.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Eugene Profeta, the preacher
Jessica Hahn said she turned to for solace after her sexual
encounter with deposed PTL leader Jim Bakker, was sentenced today
to six months in jail for witness tampering and tax charges.
   Hahn had helped put together the case against Profeta after
being promised immunity from prosecution.
   Under a plea-bargain agreement, the Long Island minister also
got five years' probation and was also ordered to pay about $26,000
in back taxes, interest and fines. He will be required to stay away
from Hahn, his former church secretary.
   Profeta, 52, was sentenced this morning by state Supreme Court
Justice Joseph Harris, who denied a request from Profeta's lawyer,
Stephen Scaring, that the minister be sentenced to community
service instead of a jail term.
   In January, just before his trial was to begin, Profeta entered
a surprise guilty plea to two of 18 charges against him. He
admitted he tried to get Hahn to lie to the grand jury about his
financial dealings and filed a false 1986 income tax return.
   Hahn, Profeta's onetime secretary, has said she and he became
lovers after her sexual encounter with Bakker in 1980 because she
was emotionally upset about the experience.
   Two years ago, revelations about the encounter and the money
paid to Hahn afterward to keep quiet about it toppled Bakker from
his PTL ministry.
   Under his plea bargain agreement with state Attorney General
Robert Abrams, charges that Profeta had skimmed church funds were
dropped. Also, tax evasion charges against his wife, Glenda, were
dismissed.
   About 150 people from Profeta's congregation made the trip from
Long Island to Albany to show support for the minister. Some sat in
the hallway outside the courtroom crying while others shouted
``Praise the Lord!''
   He preached to his Long Island ministry on Easter Sunday, after
the judge agreed to delay sentencing to allow him to appear there
on the holiday.

   Moslem guerrillas killed 53 Afghan
army troops and shot down five aircraft in fighting around
Afghanistan's strategic eastern city of Jalalabad, the insurgents
claimed today.
   However, Mohammad Nabi Amani, an Afghan government spokesman in
Kabul, said 190 insurgents died in the fighting around Jalalabad
and that two government soldiers and three civilians were killed.
   The contradicting claims could not be independently reconciled.
   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said 53 communist troops
died, 98 were wounded and five deserted in heavy fighting since
Saturday. Insurgents shot down four helicopters and one airplane
and captured several posts north of Jalalabad, the agency claimed.
   It gave no estimate of guerrilla casualties.
   The guerrillas said heavy fighting continued around the city of
Jalalabad, the airport to the southeast and in suburbs to the
north. It said the Afghan air force has retaliated with heavy
bombing, causing many high civilian casualties.
   Jalalabad is the target of the guerrillas' first major offensive
since Feb. 15, the date Soviet troops ended nine years of
involvement in the Afghan war. Afghan government forces hold the
country's key cities but guerrillas reportedly control about 90
percent of the countryside.
   The guerrillas are fighting to oust the communist government and
establish an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.
   Afghan officials claim that Pakistani troops, and U.S. and Saudi
Arabian military advisers, are fighting with the Pakistan-based
guerrillas.
   All three countries supply the guerrillas but have denied that
their military personnel are fighting in Afghanistan.

   Pathologists today examined a human
skeleton found near the place Lord Lucan last was seen alive
following the murder of his children's nanny more than 14 years ago.
   But Sussex police said they thought it unlikely the remains were
those of the missing earl. ``I would treat that with a great deal
of skepticism,'' a police officer said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Police said until tests are completed on the skeleton, they will
not know the age and sex of the person, the cause of death or how
long ago it occurred.
   The skeleton was discovered Saturday in thick undergrowth on the
Beachy Head coastal promontory.
   Lucan was last seen alive at Uckfield, on Britain's south coast,
Nov. 7, 1974, the day Sandra Rivett was battered to death and Lady
Lucan was attacked at the Lucan family's London home. A car he
borrowed was found abandoned at Newhaven, near Beachy Head, 18
miles south of Uckfield.
   The police believe Lucan killed the nanny in a dark basement,
mistaking her for his estranged wife. They believe he then attacked
Lady Lucan when he discovered his error.
   Five days later, Scotland Yard issued a murder warrant for
Lucan's arrest, the first ever for a British peer.
   At an inquest, Lady Lucan accused her husband of being the man
who attacked her, and a jury found him guilty of murder.
   Lucan has been reported alive in various parts of the world, but
police have not located him. Many believe Lucan killed himself.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A longtime diabetic whose pancreas had
virtually destroyed his heart has been given another chance to live
after doctors transplanted both organs in what is believed to be
the first such operation ever.
   Barry Katz, 45, was listed in serious condition today at the
Washington Hospital Center, and a spokeswoman said he was given an
80 percent chance of surviving a year.
   But before the surgery Saturday, the Silver Spring, Md.,
physicist's chances of living even a week were slim.
   ``He was slipping away,'' his wife Kay said. ``When you see a
loved on slipping away, you grab at anything that can help him ...
I knew this was it. This was his last chance.''
   Katz's body has shown no signs of rejecting the organs, doctors
said. And if all continues to go well, he could leave the hospital
within weeks and eventually return to work as a senior scientist
for the Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative program, they said.
   Katz had undergone heart bypass surgery seven years ago, but the
organ had begun deteriorating again over the past several months.
He was hospitalized a week before a local donor was found.
   ``This is very fast,'' said Lori E. Brigham of the Washington
Regional Transplant Consortium. ``He was very, very fortunate in
terms of timing.'' Doctors refused to identify the donor.
   Katz's doctors decided to transplant his pancreas as well as his
heart because they believed his severe diabetes would make
management of a new heart difficult or impossible.
   Although the hospital does not have permission from the District
of Columbia's State Health Planning and Development Agency to
transplant the pancreas, surgeons went ahead with the double
transplant anyway, fearing Katz would die if they waited.
   ``To our knowledge it's the first (heart-pancreas transplant)
ever done,'' said hospital spokeswoman Sarah Dodge.
   Dr. Hans W. Sollinger, a Wisconsin surgeon considered one of the
leading experts in pancreas transplants, was flown in by private
jet Saturday morning. The procedure, which was divided into
separate operations for each transplant, lasted the entire day.
   ``Everything proceeded wonderfully,'' said Dr. Jimmy A. Light, a
member of the surgical team. ``The pancreas is working, and we
think his diabetes is cured.''
   The pancreas is supposed to produce insulin, the hormone that
regulates the body's metabolism of sugar. When the organ doesn't
function properly, patients develop diabetes, and often have to
rely on insulin injections and constant monitering to survive.
   ``Diabetes can destroy the vascular system,'' said Ms. Dodge.
``Severe heart disease is a complication of diabetes.'' The
one-year survival rate for patients receiving a new pancreas has
been about 50 percent, compared with 85 percent for other organs,
Light said.
   But improvements in management of anti-rejection drugs for the
pancreas should improve Katz's outlook, making his chances of
surviving one year about 80 percent, doctors said.

   This Indiana Jones-style encounter involved neither gold nor
gems but, rather, a humble looking, weedy plant.
   Iltis, an intense, burly, Czech-born botanist at the University
of Wisconsin, is one of the world's foremost collectors of rare
plant species. The precious cargo he was protecting from the
Guatemalans several years ago was a genetic cousin of corn called
teosinte. Because its genes may carry resistance to certain
viruses, this scraggly plant may someday prove more valuable to
mankind than gold.
   As such plant-rich parts of the globe as the Amazon jungle are
stripped and despoiled, scientists and governments are racing time
to gather rare plant species and preserve them before they are lost
forever.
   Iltis has braved harsh climates and tropical sickness and says
he has occasionally given ``gifts'' at customs posts to ensure the
safe passage of himself and his botanical booty across borders. And
he said plant hunters sometimes face tough practical and ethical
choices.
   Increasingly, Third World nations see the germplasm issue as
just another instance of the United States stealing their
resources. The last thing American botanists want to be accused of
is plundering such nations.
   Iltis said that in Mexico, Brazil and other countries that have
placed ``impossibly difficult'' and time-consuming restrictions on
plant exploration, U.S. scientists look for quiet ways around the
regulations.
   ``You're supposed to collect with the permission of Mexico,''
said Iltis. ``I never have, but I always share.''
   Iltis says he makes up for his intrusions by religiously sending
back duplicates of any samples to Mexican scientists. He has also
sent valuable plant reference books to colleagues in Nicaragua and
other Central American nations he has explored.
   Interviews with several plant hunters revealed that
conservation, rather than profit, is most often their prime
motivator. Some, like Iltis, join the hunt for purely scientific
reasons that have nothing to do with improving agriculture.
   ``There is nothing in the world so thrilling to a taxonomist
than to walk into an entirely new flora,'' he told a recent visitor
to his university herbarium where row after row of special movable
file cabinets house hundreds of rare species of corn and other
trophies of more than two decades of expeditions to Mexico, Central
America and the Soviet Union.
   ``For anyone studying natural history, life can never be long
enough,'' he said.
   Slowly, governments, including our own, have begun sponsoring
and financing plant expeditions because rare species may contain
genetic information that plant breeders and geneticists can someday
use to help protect crops from viruses, drought or other
life-threatening blights or hazards.
   Yet despite the limitless potential of this genetic resource
called ``germplasm'' and the high importance scientists attach to
its preservation, the Department of Agriculture has financed an
average of only four expeditions a year since 1956, according to
USDA figures.
   In the fiscal year 1989, a relatively flush year for germplasm
exploration, the government is still spending only $150,000 to
finance about a dozen missions.
   Nevertheless, that is more than the mere $40,000 spent by the
government as recently as 1986, according to Calvin Sperling, head
of the USDA's plant exploration office, who has been on three
expeditions to South America and the Middle East and plans to go to
Turkey this spring to gather wild lentils, chick peas and
pistachios.
   Government-sponsored trips tend to be less hazardous than those
undertaken by private scientists, said David Spooner, a USDA
botanist who spends 2-3 months a year on plant expeditions for the
government, mostly hunting potato species. Such trips usually
involve sharing the fruits of the search with scientists from the
host country.
   But prior to his stint as a USDA explorer, Spooner recalls, he
knew all too well the dangers of attempting the same thing on
nothing more than a passport and plane ticket.
   ``I traveled throughout Latin America and I was hassled
constantly,'' he said. In Mexico, police stopped him and asked for
money, he said. In Honduras, police stopped him ``every 50
kilometers'' and challenged him to produce credentials.
   ``What do you do if authorities ask for bribes?'' mused William
Alberson, a University of Wisconsin plant research associate who
has explored for plants in Colombia and other South American
countries. ``You pay it.''

<HEAD>Lorain Ties Future To Casino Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS J. SHEERAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LORAIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city on Lake Erie is moving closer to
becoming the third area in the country with legalized casino
gambling, but residents still disagree whether a casino would be a
blessing or a curse.
   Lorain, an economically struggling and largely blue-collar city
of 72,000 people, would have a referendum on the issue under the
proposal the state House approved March 15.
   ``It would make more work and brighten this little town up,''
said Herman Ricks, 50, a 27-year employee at Ford Motor Co.'s
Lorain Assembly Plant.
   But Linda Hamilton, 32, a mother of two, said she may already
start to fight against the proposal.
   ``I think it would hurt Lorain, and it would hurt Lorain
families,'' said Mrs. Hamilton. ``I think crime would definitely go
up.''
   The proposal, which has been pending for 14 months, faces an
uncertain future in the state Senate, where hearings start next
month. Gov. Richard Celeste won't say yet whether he would sign or
veto the legislation.
   House approval sparked a surge of opposition, including comments
from Cleveland's top two elected officials that a casino might
attract organized crime. A organization of Roman Catholic bishops
in Ohio opposes any change in state law that could lead to
development of a casino.
   The House bill would permit voter-approved casino gambling only
in Lorain, as a five-year pilot project. Ohio law allows charity
bingo, horse racing and the state-run lottery, but casino gambling
is legal only in the state of Nevada and in Atlantic City, N.J.
   The bishops said bingo games had enough potential for abuse that
parishes were being encouraged to find other ways to raise money,
and that non-charitable gambling was even more dangerous.
   The originator of the proposal is Alan Spitzer, whose family
operates more than 20 car dealerships in Ohio and Florida. Spitzer
envisions building a $400 million resort that will include a
1,000-room hotel, restaurants, shops and a casino on a former
American Shipbuilding Co. property his family owns on the Black
River, which meets Lake Erie at Lorain, 29 miles west of Cleveland.
   The bill's sponsor, state Rep. Joseph Koziura, believes voters
would approve the casino proposal.
   Koziura, a Democrat from Lorain, bristles when he talks about
opposition by Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, a Republican, and
Cleveland City Council President George Forbes, a Democrat.
   ``It could cause us some problems,'' Koziura said. ``This is not
a Republican or a Democratic bill. This bill is simply an economic
development tool that we feel we ought to have the right to vote
on.''
   Many believe the project would be an economic boom to Lorain,
which has struggled in the 1980s because of the loss of about 5,000
jobs at the USX plant, the elimination of approximately 2,000 jobs
at Ford and the 1983 shutdown of American Shipbuilding, which at
its peak employed 1,500.
   Lorain had an unemployment rate of 10.4 percent in February,
while Ohio had a statewide rate of 6.9 percent, said Mayor Alex
Olejko, one of the proposal's strongest backers.
   Supporters believe the casino-hotel complex would employ up to
4,000 people, with increases in tourist-related employment
providing a net gain of 10,000 jobs.
   Others are concerned that a casino would increase crime and
corruption.
   Police Chief John Malinovsky was indicted this month on felony
charges of extortion and perjury for allegedly pressuring fire
inspectors into ignoring fire code violations at a charity bingo
hall his daughter planned to run.
   One of his subordinates, Sgt. Wayne Long, is serving a two-year
prison term in connection with the same investigation.
   Safety Director Richard Yepko resigned last week after police
announced that he was being investigated for allegedly telling
local clubs shortly after Malinovsky's arrest that illegal gambling
would be overlooked. Yepko hasn't been charged.
   ``I think all this negative publicity will hurt the chances of
the casino,'' said Robert Azzariti Jr., a high school business
teacher who says he hasn't decided how he would vote.
   ``Lorain needs something, and we need to develop the
waterfront,'' Azzariti said. ``But you'd have to worry about the
crime element. You'd have to worry about the kinds of people a
casino draws in. I worry about these things, too _ about what's
going to happen to the moral fiber of the community.''
   Olejko said the legislation includes protections against
organized crime. The Ohio attorney general automatically would be a
member of a commission overseeing the casino's operation, and
voters would have an opportunity to decide whether to retain the
casino after five years.

<TEXT>
   All students, teachers and
administrators at a private high school will be checked for illegal
drug use in a testing program believed to be one of the most
far-reaching in the country, officials say.
   ``We're not trying to be any trend-setters. We're just trying to
do whatever we can to look out for our kids,'' said Homer Burns,
headmaster of the 276-student Indianola Academy, which has boys and
girls in grades seven through 12.
   The program, to begin in August, will include the 24 members of
the school's board of directors.
   Burns said school officials have not decided yet which drugs
will be targeted.
   The town of 13,000 residents, 130 miles south of Memphis, Tenn.,
``sort of'' has a drug problem, says Police Chief Roosevelt Harris.
Police say two recent burglary-related shootings may have been
related to drugs.
   Officials with private school associations say Indianola's
mandatory program is one of the most extensive in the country.
   ``I've never heard of anything like (it). That's very unusual,''
said Robert L. Smith, director of the Council for American Private
Education.
   Drug testing programs generally target student-athletes or
students suspected of using illegal drugs.
   Youngsters who refuse to participate in the urine-sample testing
will have to leave the academy. Those who test positive will be
referred to treatment programs and could be excluded from
extracurricular activities, authorities say.
   The program, expected to cost $9,000 a year, was approved
earlier this month by the school's board.

<TEXT>
   The state House Judiciary Committee
today formally sent to the full House articles of impeachment
against Treasurer A. James Manchin stemming from losses of $279
million in a fund under Manchin's control in 1987.
   The committee voted 17-7 to recommend the impeachment after
adding two additional articles to the 16 it voted for last
Wednesday.
   The popular, flamboyant Manchin, 61, is in his second term as
state treasurer. He is a Democrat, and his party also controls the
House of Delegates and state Senate.
   House Speaker Chuck Chambers said the body could vote on
impeachment as early as Wednesday. If it passes the House, the case
would then go to the Senate for a trial.
   Senate President Larry Tucker, anticipating that a majority of
the House will vote to impeach Manchin, has told his colleagues to
be prepared to hear the case in May and estimated the trial would
take three to four weeks.
   The last time a West Virginia treasurer was impeached and
removed from office was in 1876.
   Also today, the House Judiciary Committee then voted 22-3 to
censure state Auditor Glen Gainer for his role in the losses.
   The articles recommend that Manchin be impeached for
maladministration, incompetence, neglect of duty and high crimes
and misdemeanors for his role in the investment fund losses and for
conspiring to cover them up.
   The two articles added today accuse him of putting an
unqualified person in control of the state's investment portfolio
after two previous treasury employees left and having the
treasurer's office charge a service fee for handling investments in
the fund.
   Manchin, Gainer, and former Gov. Arch Moore made up the Board of
Investments when the losses occurred in the consolidated investment
fund. The board had general supervisory control over the fund.
Manchin's office had direct investment powers.
   Committee members were angered by statements Gainer made to them
during 10 days of testimony on the impeachment issue. They believed
he should have been more active in the fund's supervision. Moore
left office in January after being unseated by Gaston Caperton in
last year's general election.

Tass reported.
   The new airport, Minsk-2, was constructed ``to meet the rapid
growth of passenger traffic brought about by the development of
foreign tourist travel and direct business contacts,'' the official
news agency said.
   First flights from the airport will be to East Germany, and
service will expand to Warsaw later this month. Charter flights
will be added later this year, the news agency said.
   ``The new airport increases flying safety,'' Tass said. ``If
Moscow airport is declared closed due to unfavorable weather

   A North Korean navy warship violated
South Korea's territorial waters in the Yellow Sea, the Defense
Ministry announced Monday.
   There was no military clash in the brief confrontation Saturday,
a spokesman for the ministry said. The North Korean vessel changed
its course and retreated when South Korean ships approached, he
said.
   The North Korean warship apparently sailed into South Korean
waters in an effort to identify a Japanese merchant ship that was
being checked by South Korean naval craft, the spokesman said.
   The Japanese ship, the 200-ton Yakusimaru, was sailing to North
Korea's western port of Haeju when it was ordered to stop for
inspection by the South Korean navy, he said.
   South Korea will lodge a protest with North Korea through the
Korean Military Armistice Commission, a watchdog of the 1953 Korean
War truce accord, operating in the border village of Panmunjom, he
said.

   Thousands of chanting and
sign-carrying West Germans took to the streets across the nation
Monday in holiday parades organized to call on the West to do more
to ensure world peace.
   From Hamburg to Nuremberg, more than 100,000 protesters have
been marching in annual Easter peace parades and demonstrations
since Thursday. The actions ended Monday with more marches and
peaceful demonstrations across West Germany.
   Marchers have been demonstrating against low-level NATO training
flights over West Germany and the alliance's plans to modernize
short-range nuclear weapons based in this country, and they have
demanded increased disarmament initiatives from the West.
   ``Modernize defense policies, and not atomic rockets,'' said a
banner at a Frankfurt rally.
   Peace activists want the short-range rockets dismantled and not
modernized, saying they are not needed because of a lessened
military threat from the East.
   Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, an official with the opposition
Social Democratic Party, said the modernization plans could violate
the 1987 Soviet-U.S. treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear
missiles based in Europe.
   ``We have certainly not struggled for the destruction of
Pershing and cruise missiles so that we can now stand by and watch
them be replaced by new atomic rockets,'' she said at the Frankfurt
rally.
   In Hamburg, an official with the giant workers' union IG Metall
criticized the government's defense policies as well as the
modernization plans.
   Karin Benz-Overhage called on the government to nullify its
decision to raise compulsory military service terms from 15 months
to 18 months.
   Ms. Benz-Overhage also charged the government has shown little
willingness to undertake disarmament initiatives.
   ``More and more young people don't want to have anything to do
with this kind of nonsense anymore,'' she told the Hamburg rally.

<TEXT>
   It is no celebration the Cherokees plan
this week, although spring brings a special joy in the adopted
homeland where the tribe ended its greatest tragedy 150 years ago.
   In the winter of 1838-39, thousands of Cherokees died on a
forced march from their homes in the southeastern United States to
what is now northeastern Oklahoma. The path is known as the Trail
of Tears.
   On Friday and Saturday, the tribe observes the sesquicentennial
of that time. The last of 14 groups of Cherokees escorted by
federal troops arrived in late March 1839.
   Wilma Mankiller, chief of the nation's second-largest Indian
tribe, said Cherokees decided to mark the sesquicentennial after
some hesitation because of the sensitivity that lingers over those
days.
   The tribe settled on a commemoration only after wagon hobbyists
not affiliated with the tribe re-traced the Trail of Tears last
fall. Ms. Mankiller noted most Cherokees made the trek by foot,
some in shackles.
   ``It wasn't a friendly removal,'' she said.
   ``I think there are a number of people who have concerns,'' said
Ms. Mankiller, chief since 1985. ``I think it's healthy for us to
look back (and show) respect for our ancestors.
   ``It helps to place our present problems in a historical
context. But I certainly understand the concerns of people about
looking at this issue.
   ``I think for us it's a very solemn, very emotional time. We
look at it as something that happened to our family.''
   Ms. Mankiller said the observance provides ``a chance to do some
public education about our history.''
   ``There's so little accurate information about what modern
American Indians are like. There's a vacuum,'' she said.
   Most Americans know only the Indians they see depicted in John
Wayne movies, Ms. Mankiller said.
   In the tribe's capital of Tahlequah, a university city of
10,000, there will be speeches, story-telling and flute playing. A
tree will be planted in honor of the estimated 4,000 Cherokees who
died along the trail.
   Donated hogs will be cooked in huge black kettles on the grounds
of a historic home. There will be free corn bread and beans, eggs
and wild onions.
   ``This is what the Indians of the hills eat ... whatever food
they could find and forage,'' said John Ketcher, deputy chief of
the tribe, who remembers when his own relatives would not discuss
the tragedy.
   Those forced westward included Cherokees who owned plantations
and had assimilated into the dominant white culture. But the tribe
had its own government and its own written language when President
Andrew Jackson ordered the Cherokees removed from land sought by
white settlers.
   Ketcher's great-grandparents were on the trail, uprooted from
northern Georgia.
   ``I never did hear about the trail when I was growing up _
nothing, not anything,'' Ketcher said. ``Was it just an attempt to
shut it out _ like it never happened?
   ``Many of them would just prefer to forget the whole thing,
because it was such a tragic event in the lives of our people.''
   Ms. Mankiller, who keeps busy with speaking engagements
nationwide, said the sesquicentennial should remind tribal members
of their resiliency.
   ``It is intended to be sort of a solemn occasion .... But also
at the same time look back about what happened after the Trail of
Tears. We were able to bounce back in the 1800s,'' she said.
   A commemorative plaque depicts a legendary Phoenix bird arising
from ashes to assume the form of a Cherokee warrior.
   The tribe arrived in Oklahoma politically divided over removal.
But the tribe rebounded to re-form a government, enforce tribal
laws and erect government buildings that still stand. It
established some of the first schools west of the Mississippi,
including a school for women.
   ``Lots of people in Oklahoma believe that Oklahoma history began
with the Land Run (of 1889). We had been here for a couple of
generations. We had made this area hospitable. We had settled it,''
she said.
   Today the Cherokee Nation's concerns focus on education, health
care and employment, Ms. Mankiller said. Cherokee Nation Industries
has a booming greenhouse operation in Tahlequah, a defense
contracting plant in Stilwell and industrial tracts, but economic
development in the rural areas remains a major concern.
   ``I share that frustration, I think, with every other small town
in America,'' Ms. Mankiller said.

   A Japanese television network has reached agreement
with Soviet authorities for one of its employees to go aboard the
Soviet space station Mir by the end of 1991, a network official
said Monday.
   The agreement was signed between Kiichi Nakamura, of the Tokyo

Glavkosmos, the Soviet commercial space agency, said the official,
who refused to be identified.
   To mark the network's 40th anniversary, one of its employees
will be flown to the space station aboard a Soyuz spaceship. During
the six-day stay aboard the Mir, live broadcasts of the staffer's
activities will shown daily in Japan, he said.
   The official refused to say how much the broadcaster will pay
the Soviets.
   Employees at the network are signing up to be considered for the
flight. ``Everybody wants to go,'' said one reporter.
   The Mir station was launched in 1986 and has a capacity of six.
   Three Japanese astronauts are undergoing training in the United
States, and one is scheduled to board a U.S. space shuttle flight
by July 1991.

   Sales of existing homes fell in February for
the second straight month as higher interest rates pushed buyers
out of the market, a real estate trade group said Monday.
   Sales of existing single-family homes dropped 3.1 percent last
month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units,
the slowest pace since the 3.38 million rate recorded last March,
the National Association of Realtors reported.
   February's decline followed an even sharper 9.4 percent sales
drop in January.
   The Realtors attributed the recent weakness in sales to the
Federal Reserve Board's yearlong campaign to drive up interest
rates in an effort to slow the economy and ease inflationary
pressures.
   ``The Fed's credit stance is working,'' said Realtors President
Ira Gribin. ``Interest rates are pushed up and buyers are pushed
out.''
   Fixed-rate home mortgages last month averaged between 10.55
percent and 10.78 percent, according to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were
asking an average initial rate of between 8.56 percent and 8.73
percent.
   By last week, the rates were up to 11.22 percent and 9.30
pecent, respectively.
   Because lower-income buyers generally were the ones pushed out
of the market by the higher rates, the median price of existing
homes sold last month increased, the Realtors reported. The median
rose $3,400 to $93,100, meaning half sold for more and half for
less.
   ``Generally, in times of rising rates, the people left in the
market tend to be upper-income buyers who can buy the house they
want regardless of less affordable financing,'' said John Tuccillo,
chief economist for the group.
   He said the resale pace is not expected to drop much further
because economic growth appears to be slowing to a level acceptable
to the Fed.
   February's decline in home sales was led by a sharp drop in the
high-priced Northeast, where the market began to cool last year
after an earlier surge in prices.
   Resales in the region were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 580,000 last month, down 18.3 percent from the previous month.
The median price of a home in the Northeast was $142,600, down
$1,200 from the previous month.
   The higher interest rates ``probably will prolong stagnation in
some of those markets,'' Tuccillo said.
   Sales in the South were down 0.8 percent to an annual rate of
1.3 million units last month, with the median price in that region
rising $6,100 last month to $88,500.
   Sales dropped 1.1 percent in the Midwest to an annual rate of
920,000 units, while the median price rose $2,100 to $69,900.
   The West was the only region to record an increase in sales last
month, with the annual rate rising 3.2 percent to 650,000 units.
The median price in the region was $133,700, up $3,000 from January.
   ``Strong economic growth in the West has made it better prepared
to withstand credit tightening,'' Tuccillo said. ``This region
contains some of the hottest markets in the country now, and buyers
there seem to be less affected by hikes in interest rates.''

   A U.S. human rights group that monitored the
Soviet parliamentary elections said Monday the system appeared to
be efficient but there were flaws that could have led to rigging
the results.
   Soviet newspapers reported some voters were disenfranchised
because of election difficulties. Igor Orlov, the chairman of the
Moscow election commission, acknowledged some snags developed in
Sunday's voting, the first multicandidate elections in the Soviet
Union in 70 years.
   David Carliner, an attorney with the U.S.-based International
Human Rights Law Group, told a news conference that six delegates
visited 17 polling stations in eight election districts.
   ``The process appeared efficient and officials took their duty
quite seriously,'' he said. ``It was clear that they did not try in
any way to influence the voters.''
   Voters interviewed by the delegation ``were satisfied that their
ballots were secret and sacred and would be counted,'' Carliner
said.
   There were possibilities to commit election fraud, however,
mainly because there weren't enough Soviet observers to monitor all
polling stations, he said.
   At several polling stations, there were no observers or
officials present by late afternoon. ``The lack of observers left
open a chance to cheat,'' Carliner said. ``Anyone could have walked
in, marked up a bunch of ballots and stuffed them into the box.''
   In addition, special voting passes had been given to many people
such as businessmen and tourists, allowing them to vote away from
their residences, he said. That left the system open to abuse, he
said.
   ``We ran up against masses of absolutely new moments, currents
and problems,'' Orlov said from the Moscow City Council
headquarters. ``Some things we did satisfactorily, some things did
not get done until the end.''
   Soviet newspapers carried complaints of people who said they
were denied a chance to vote.
   ``In some election districts, a few disabled people were denied
the voting right because of the inefficiency of voting
commissions,'' Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   In past elections, the disabled could request a ballot box be
brought to their residences. If a person could not get to a polling
station, a relative could take the person's internal passport and
cast the vote by proxy.
   The newspaper said the election commission of the
Cheremushkinsky district responded to the complaint by saying,
``They only had two portable ballot boxes and they were short of
time.''
   In other districts, residents did not receive the special mailed
invitation cards needed to cast a ballot, it said.
   The U.S. group has monitored elections in Nicaragua, Uruguay,
Grenada, El Salvador, South Korea and Zimbabwe.

   An 18-year-old student beat a 54-year-old
woman to death with a rock after an argument over topless
sunbathing, it was reported Monday.
   The student, Giuliano Moschetto, insulted Maria Adua Amerio and
accused her of indecency for going topless on a remote stretch of
beach in this Ligurian resort near Savona on Sunday, the news
agencies said.
   When Mrs. Amerio argued with Moschetto, he tried to strangle
her. Mrs. Amerio tried to run away but was killed when her attacker
struck her on the head with a large rock, the reports said.
   Moschetto was arrested later after a witness pointed him out to
police. He was being held Monday on murder charges.
   The agencies said the two did not know each other and had each
come to Andora for the Easter weekend holiday.

   Hundreds of spiffily dressed youngsters and

take part in the traditional Easter Egg Roll and, maybe, catch a
glimpse of President Bush and his wife Barbara.
   The Bushes, accompanied by their children and grandchildren, put
in a brief appearance midway in the event, with the president
blowing a whistle to start the kids off trying to roll eggs along
the lawn with plastic spoons.
   The president was accompanied by two people in bunny costumes.
   Actor Christopher Reeve, who plays Superman in the movies, was
also in his president's party.
   Many in the crowd held up yellow, pink, blue and other colored
balloons.
   The fine weather that greeted Washington for Easter Sunday held

Franklin D. Roosevelt.

<HEAD>Seven Patients Returning Home To Armenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven people who were seriously injured in the
devastating December earthquake in Armenia headed home Monday after
weeks of medical care and rehabilitation in U.S. hospitals.
   ``They looked radiant,'' said Stephen Johnson, executive vice
president of Americares, the medical relief organization that
coordinated the effort.
   The patients were accompanied by 12,000 pounds of medical
equipment and 16 physicians and other medical volunteers who will
set up a clinic in the Armenian capital of Yerevan to treat
hundreds who lost limbs in the earthquake.
   Patients will be fitted with prosthetics which will be made at
the clinic, and will undergo physical therapy.
   ``The whole purpose of this effort is to start working on them
over there and to train some of the Armenians to carry on the
work,'' Johnson said.
   Among those returning home was 8-year-old Arman Kazarian, who
could not walk because of a spinal injury when he arrived last
month at the Hospital for Joint Diseases and Orthopaedic Institute
in New York. Surgery enabled him to walk without a brace or
crutches.
   ``He was in great spirits,'' Johnson said.
   Lubov Papikian, a 34-year-old mother of four who was paralyzed
by falling debris, also was on the plane, able to walk with
crutches.
   ``The contrast of her coming off the plane on a stretcher in
February and in a wheelchair today, able to move her legs, was like
night and day,'' said Johnson.
   Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Neil Kahanovitz, who inserted metal rods
to straighten Mrs. Papikian's spine, was already in Yerevan
awaiting the plane's arrival.
   The patients, ranging in age from 8 to 45, were cared for in
hospitals in New York and Connecticut. Eight others who arrived in
February will be heading home in the coming months.
   The doctors and other volunteers are part of a new program
formed by Americares called Doctors To All Peoples. The clinic in
Armenia will be operated by Americares and the World Rehabilitation
Fund of the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine.

<HEAD>Reagan Won't Have To Testify at North Trial Friday, But Maybe Later</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra trial Monday
rejected Oliver North's bid to have former President Reagan appear
in court Friday as the defense's first witness, but held out the
possibility he might be called later.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he wanted ``a
succinct particularized statement of facts'' from North's lawyers
on what they want to elicit from Reagan before he would decide
whether the former president must testify.
   In a two-page order, Gesell said the defense should file that
statement under seal by late Wednesday afternoon. The prosecution
won't be permitted to see it.
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan asked the court last Friday to
enter an order enforcing a subpoena issued in December directing
Reagan to appear at North's trial. Sullivan sought to have Reagan
appear this coming Friday as the defense's leadoff witness.
   ``There is insufficient time to resolve the pending questions
relating to President Reagan's personal appearance to contemplate
his appearance by Friday, March 31, as requested,'' the judge said.
   Gesell said a hearing date on the questions concerning Reagan's
possible appearance will be scheduled ``based on developments at
trial.''
   Gesell also said he wants other issues regarding North's
subpoena for Reagan ``to be resolved expeditiously this week.''
   The trial was in recess Monday and was to resume Tuesday.
   Gesell said he wanted to know whether the ex-president
personally objects to appearing at ``a later date convenient for
him'' or whether other arrangements for his testimony could be
substituted.
   These could include a videotaped deposition or excerpts from
personal diaries, said the judge.
   The Justice Department, acting on Reagan's behalf, opposes
North's subpoena.
   Sullivan is trying to show that Reagan and his advisers approved
North's actions. The fired National Security Council aide is
charged with 12 crimes, including obstructing and making false
statements to Congress by denying he was involved in secretly
assisting the Contras.
   Sullivan said ``the importance'' of Reagan's testimony to the
defense of this case ``is clear both from the record in the trial
to date'' and from earlier arguments made by the defense.
   North's lawyers have brought out at the trial that Reagan
personally approved a secret deal to slip $110 million in extra aid
to Honduras to entice the country's government to back the Contras.
   The defense also introduced documents designed to show that
Reagan approved airdropping intelligence materials and recoilless
rifles to the Contras to destroy arms-bearing ships headed for
Nicaragua.
   Reagan's actions took place during a congressional ban on
military aid to the Contras.

   Police and soldiers surrounded a prison
farm today where about 250 inmates held guards and Easter visitors
hostage, officials said. Seven people were reported killed and
about 20 wounded in the takeover.
   Officials said inmates took over the prison farm on Sunday after
wresting rifles from prison guards.
   At least 300 police officers and 400 soldiers armed with rifles
and submachines guns surrounded the prison, reports said.
   Three of those who died Sunday in the uprising at the Pavon
prison farm _ the country's largest penal institution _ were
inmates and three were guards, according to a judge who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
   A fourth guard died today of his injuries, said prison spokesman
Conrado Monroy.
   The judge said he did not know how many people were hurt, but a
witness interviewed on a local radio station said about 20 people
were wounded in a gun battle between guards and inmates.
   It was not clear how many hostages the inmates held _ one report
said about 400 _ or how much of the 2.5 square mile facility they
controlled.
   Miguel Campos, director general of prisons, told reporters today
that he was reviewing demands of about 250 armed inmates.
   The inmates reportedly raided the prison armory, then took over
the prison farm about 12 miles from Guatemala City, at around noon
Sunday.
   Prisoners surrendered many of the weapons during negotiations
with authorities, news reports said. Negotiators said the talks
ended just before midnight and were to resume today.
   Negotiators told reporters about 1,000 people remained inside
the institution including guards, inmates who had not joined in the
rioting, and families with children who were visiting on Easter
Sunday.
   Television station Notisiete said about 400 people were being
held hostage. But one negotiator, reporter Ricardo Gatica Trejo of
the Guatemala City newspaper El Grafico, said the number of
hostages was not clear.
   The prison farm has room for 1,350 prisoners, but it was not
known how many were inside when the uprising began.
   Trejo said inmate demands included amnesties or reduced
sentences, a change in prison officials, and better food and
treatment.
   Another negotiator, Fire Department Cmdr. Alejandro Giammattei
Falla, said the inmates also demanded to talk with federal human
rights director Gonzalo Mendez de la Riva, who was out of town and
not scheduled to return until today.
   Television newscasts showed the prison farm surrounded by police
and soldiers sent from the capital. An air force helicopter hovered
overhead.
   Notisiete said additional army units were on standby.
   The National Broadcasters Information Patrol Service, a private
radio station, broadcast an interview with a man identified as
Marcos Antonio Morales. He said he and his wife, Maria, were
waiting outside to visit a relative when the revolt broke out.
   Morales told the radio station his wife was among about 20
people wounded in a gunfight between inmates and guards.
   He said he initially took his wounded wife into a prison chapel,
where many other visitors sought refuge and treatment for the
injured. He said his wife was taken to a police hospital and he did
not know the extent of her injuries.
   In an uprising at the same prison farm five years ago, guards
shot 12 inmates to death after a prisoner tried to attack a guard
with a knife during roll call.

   Burma's leader, Gen. Saw Maung, urged the
military Monday to continue its struggle against the country's
dozen rebel groups.
   On Sunday, government troops overran the main Karen camp of Maw
Po Kay, in Karen State, located on the border with Thailand. The
victory came after three days of intense fighting, according to
Burma's state radio.
   The broadcast said 38 government troops were killed and 189
soldiers wounded; at least 74 rebels were killed.
   ``The traitors such as the Burma Communist Party rebels ... and
the Karen National Union ... who are lackeys of foreign powers,
continue their efforts ... to cause the disintegration of the
state,'' Saw Maung said at a military parade marking Armed Forces
Day.
   Saw Maung seized power in a bloody coup in September when his
troops killed hundreds of people to crush a nationwide movement for
democracy.
   On Monday, he repeated pledges the military will hand over power
to the winner of a general election next year.
   ``With the improvement of the general situation, free and fair
general elections will be held throughout the country, except in
the areas where there is no peace and tranquility because of rebel
activities,'' he said.
   Burma has been torn by ethnic clashes since gaining independence
from Britain four decades ago.
   The Karens, with about 4,000 fighters, roam vast tracts of the
southeastern border with Thailand.
   Sunday's loss of Maw Po Kay, 80 miles northwest of Raheng,
Thailand, was considered a major defeat, sources said. The Karens
had held the camp for several years despite previous government
offensives.
   Government troops seized rebel weapons and ammunition in the
attack, the broadcast said.
   The fighting forced the evacuation of 3,000 people from the Tha
Song Yang district of Thailand's Tak province, located near the
camp. Government troops captured two other Karen camps along the
Thai-Burmese border in December and January.
   The Karens are one of a dozen minority groups that have sought
greater autonomy promised to them in Burma's constitution after
independence was won from Britain in 1948.
   The minorities live in Burma's rugged frontier and make up about
30 percent of Burma's 38 million people. Most Burmese live in the
central part of the country.
   The lifestyles and traditions of the minorities differ from
those of the dominant Burmese, who are mainly Buddhist.

   As Hollywood gets ready for its yearly
orgy of self-congratulation, where is a jaded journalist to go for
the other side of the story _ the detached, indifferent, listless
and world-weary side?
   Alan Caruba, a public relations consultant, is meeting that
need. As creator of The Boring Institute, he says his phone has
been ringing constantly with interview requests prompted by his
satirical ``most boring'' lists.
   Caruba's latest, released March 20, was the ``Most Boring Film
Awards,'' a sendup of the Academy Awards.
   Eddie Murphy is a big winner for his two 1988 releases, ``Raw,''
and ``Coming To America,'' which Caruba says, ``run the gamut from
merely vulgar to monotonously obscene.''
   The institute will surface again in July with ``National
Anti-Boredom Month,'' followed in September by ``Fearless Forecasts
of TV's Fall Flops.'' The ``Most Boring Celebrities of the Year''
in December resulted in 200 radio interviews for Caruba.
   Caruba, a 51-year-old bachelor who still lives with his parents
in the house where he was raised, says the popularity of his
lampoon confirms his beliefs about America's media-glutted society.
   ``The American public is being exploited cynically by film
producers and people who choose what television programs they see.
   ``We are asked to live our lives vicariously through others,
primarily on television,'' he said.
   The irony of The Boring Institute, of course, is that Caruba's
diatribes are approaching the level of exposure that he is
criticizing.
   ``It's a kind of commentary on our times,'' he said.

   Thousands of Protestants
marched through Belfast on Monday to mark the 300th anniversary of
Protestant resistance to the 1689 Siege of Londonderry ordered by
England's Catholic King James II.
   An estimated 8,000 members of the Protestant Apprentice Boys
order, accompanied by dozens of bands, took part in the parade,
which police said was peaceful. They included contingents from the
Irish Republic, Scotland and England.
   The Apprentice Boys take their name from 13 apprentice boys said
to have slammed Londonderry's gates on James' army at the start of
the unsuccessful 105-day siege.
   Security forces put up huge screens along parts of the route
where the parade passed Catholic areas, in an attempt to deter
secular violence.
   Hugh Pollock, secretary of the Apprentice Boys, said it was the
biggest parade ever organized outside Londonderry. ``This is an
important day for us _ a day to mark an historic occasion,'' he
said.
   On Monday night, more than 400 people, including members of the
ultra-Protestant Orange Order, were expected at a banquet at
Belfast City Hall given by Lord Mayor Nigel Dodds.

<HEAD>White House Says Gray Has Withdrawn Complaint About Aid Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with White House brushing
aside Gray complaint and rebuking him. ^By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The White House, trying to put an end to an
embarrassing episode, today brushed aside a complaint from
President Bush's legal counsel about the new Contra aid agreement
and issued what amounted to a public rebuke of the official.
   In a highly unusual move, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray was
quoted Sunday as saying the agreement encroached on the president's
power to conduct foreign policy. Privately, White House officials
were perplexed that Gray would go public with a challenge to a
policy Bush had embraced.
   Bush sidestepped a question about whether he was angry at Gray.
Mingling with thousands of children on the South Lawn during the
annual Easter egg roll, Bush said, ``On a day like this, I'm not
angry at anybody.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Gray met with
chief of staff John Sununu today. ``They had a polite discussion
about how things work in the White House,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked why Gray would have felt that the agreement had not
received proper legal review, Fitzwater replied, ``I just can't
tell you what was in Boyden Gray's mind. That's more than I can
handle.''
   Fitzwater's comments amounted to a rare public rebuke of another
senior White House official. The press secretary was asked whether
Gray had been told that he should work through proper channels
instead of taking his complaints to the press.
   ``I don't know that they did tell him that,'' Fitzwater said.
``I think that's a good idea. I'd tell him that.''
   Fitzwater added, ``All the appropriate discussions have been
commenced and completed with Mr. Gray and he fully understands our
position.'' The spokesman said, ``Boyden simply explained his
concerns and they were met and that's pretty much the end of it.''
   Baker played down the dispute and insisted that the accord does
not surrender presidential power to Congress.
   ``This is a voluntary agreement,'' Baker said Sunday. ```You do
not have the question arise here with respect to constitutional
powers and prerogatives because the Congress is not imposing its
will, in effect, through legislation.''
   Gray himself tried to play down the dispute today during the
daily meeting of senior White House officials. He told his
colleagues that reports of his concerns were overstated and that he
didn't think there were any problems with the agreement, according
to an official who declined to be identified.
   ``He basically backed off,'' the official said. ``There's a lot
of discussion of this and a feeling that it was really a somewhat
bizarre occurrence and shouldn't have happened.''
   The episode marked Gray's second run-in with Baker, one of the
most powerful figures in the Bush administration. Earlier, Gray had
raised questions about the propriety of Baker's financial holdings,
and the secretary later disposed of the assets.
   Gray did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   Gray had expressed concern in a New York Times interview about a
provision giving any of four congressional committees the power to
cut off aid to the Nicaraguan rebels after November if lawmakers
conclude that the Contras' continued presence is harming Central
American peace efforts.
   Gray said the provision was ``much more than a gentleman's
agreement'' because ``it's in writing and becomes a precedent,
although not as serious as if it were in legislation.''
   Both Baker and White House national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft said on television news shows Sunday that they did not
agree with Gray on the subject. But neither would criticize him
directly, with Baker sidestepping questions about the dispute.
   A television interviewer noted that it was Gray who ``a few
weeks ago embarrassed you publicly by calling attention'' to stock
held by Baker in a bank with major outstanding loans to foreign
countries.
   ``Now he is complaining that you have made a deal that is wrong.
Is there room for both of you in this administration?''
   ``Nice try, Sam,'' replied Baker. ``The fact of the matter is,
the president, the chief of staff, the national security adviser to
the president and I all discussed this particular provision. So,
good try.''
   ``So, you don't care to predict how long C. Boyden Gray will be
in the administration?'' persisted a second questioner.
   ``Good try, David,'' replied Baker.
   President Bush, appearing at the White House with congressional
leaders from both parties to announce the deal last Friday, hailed
it as a return to a bipartisan foreign policy. The previous
administration repeatedly failed to reach accord with Congress on
Central America.
   Congress voted to end military aid to the Contras in 1988, and
the current appropriation of $27.1 million in humanitarian aid ends
next Friday. Contra forces are now encamped across the border in
Honduras.
   Under the new agreement, negotiated by Baker and congressional
leaders, Congress would vote after its Easter recess to send the
Contras $4.5 million a month in non-military aid through February
1990.
   The administration, meanwhile, would pledge in writing to pursue
diplomatic means to end fighting in Central America.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has committed itself
to hold free elections in February 1990, according to an earlier
accord among Central American presidents.
   Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Alejandro Bendano, interviewed by
satellite on the ABC-TV program ``This Week with David Brinkley,''
said that the U.S. policy still was ``out of step with what the
Central American presidents have agreed upon'' because it would not
disband the Contras.
   Baker, also appearing on ABC, said that the accord among Central
American presidents called for an agreement by May 15 on
demobilizing the Contras, but not their immediate dissolution.
   If the Sandinistas do not hold elections as promised, said
Baker, the United States might use ``sticks'' that would ``involve
tightening economic sanctions, further diplomatic sanctions and ...
there is nothing in this agreement that would foreclose the
president's future request for military assistance, should things
deteriorate substantially.''

   A crewman without proper certification was
in command when an Exxon tanker apparently hit two rocks and ran
aground, causing the nation's biggest oil spill, the company said.
   Officials said a third mate was in command, against company
policy, at the time of Friday morning's accident that sent an
estimated 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince Williams
Sound south of here and prompted the governor Sunday to declare the
sound a disaster area. The Exxon Valdez crewman did not have the
proper license to legally operate such a large ship in the sound,
officials said.
   Exxon Shipping Co. spokesman Brian Dunphy said Sunday that the
captain, Joseph Hazelwood, was in the cabin at the time of the
grounding. But today he said ``the captain's whereabouts are
uncertain throughout the entire incident. It is known he was not on
the bridge for the complete time.''
   Both he and another company spokesman, Sharon Curran-Wescott,
said that even if Hazelwood was present during part of the time on
the bridge, he was not in command.
   ``We do know the captain was not in command,'' Ms.
Curran-Wescott said. ``He apparently may have been physically
present on the bridge.''
   Dunphy said Hazelwood was consulting an attorney.
   Meanwhile, winds topping 25 knots this morning forced
postponement of efforts to clean up the sound with chemicals to
disperse the oil or fire to burn it off.
   ``Some of the cleanup operations, such as the use of skimmers
and also dispersants and the burn technique, have been put on
hold,'' Dunphy said. He said he was unsure if the weather would
improve enough to allow cleanup to begin later in the day.
   He said crews using three pumps had managed to move 78,000
barrels of oil from the Exxon Valdez to another tanker, the Exxon
Baton Rouge, as of 6 a.m., and workers planned to bring in four
more pumps todayto speed up the rate of unloading.
   Based on the findings of divers, the company believes the tanker
had struck one rock a glancing blow and was already leaking when it
struck a second time and ran around, said Exxon Shipping Co.
President Frank Iarossi. ``We're surmising there had to be two
events,'' he said, but he didn't know how many minutes apart they
might have taken place.
   Coast Guard officials said they could not confirm whether the
tanker hit bottom more than once or say what crew memers were on
the bridge at the time of the accident.
   Oil traders and analysts predicted crude oil prices would rise
temporarily because it forced the closing of the port of Valdez,
southern terminus of the Alyeska pipeline that carries all crude
oil from Alaska's North Slope, cutting U.S. crude supplies by a
quarter.
   In today's early trading, the May contract for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, was up 57
cents from Thursday's close, trading at $20.72 per 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper on Sunday declared the wildlife-rich
sound a disaster area and said he would seek federal funds to help
with the spill, which the Coast Guard estimates has affected about
100 square miles. Oil has washed up on two islands, and sightings
were reported of dozens of crude-coated birds.
   Also Sunday, officials said the government authorized use of
chemicals and fire to combat the massive slick.
   Before winds forced postponement of the effort, Iarossi had said
officials planned to use a C-130 aircraft today to spray chemicals
to disperse patches of oil in a 5-square-mile area of the sound.
The company also planned to burn ``fingers'' of the slick by
igniting them with a laser.
   ``The volume of oil released in the water is, for all intents
and purposes, beyond control by mechanical means alone,'' Iarossi
said.
   Iarossi said the latest estimate of damage to the tanker is
eight damaged oil cargo tanks and two damaged ballast tanks.
   At the time of the disaster Friday, third mate Gregory Cousins
was in command and his actions violated federal regulations, said
Ms. Curran-Wescott.
   ``He didn't have a proper pilot's license for that. He wasn't
authorized by the company, nor was it legal,'' she said.
   Neither Hazelwood nor Cousins could be located in Valdez by The
Associated Press for comment.
   The National Transportation Safety Board took over the
investigation Sunday, one day after issuing subpoenas for
Hazelwood, Cousins and helmsman Robert Kagan, the third member of
the bridge crew. Results of routine drug and alcohol tests
administered to the three weren't immediately available, officials
said.
   The NTSB slated hearings for next week in Anchorage.
   Hazelwood was relieved of his command, but to give him rest, not
as a disciplinary measure, officials said.
   The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez, carrying 1.2 million barrels
of North Slope crude oil, ran onto a reef 25 miles from port early
Friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice. Valdez is
at the southern end of the 800-mile Alaska oil pipeline.
   Estimates put the spill at 240,000 barrels of oil, or about 10.1
million gallons, making it the biggest U.S. spill on record. The
only larger oil-related accident in U.S. waters involved 10.7
million gallons of oil when two ships collided in Galveston Bay in
1979, but that oil burned as well as spilled.
   ``This oil spill may well be the greatest disaster to hit Alaska
since the Good Friday earthquake 25 years ago,'' Cowper said.
   A wildlife specialist toured the sound and observed 75 ducks and
two otters coated with oil, said U.S. Department of Interior
spokeswoman Pamela Bergmann.
   A station was set up to clean birds, and a mammal-cleaning
station also was planned.
   Fishermen fearing lost income have sought compensation from the
shipping company, Exxon officials said.
   ``We're not ready to absorb any loss,'' said Riki Ott,
spokeswoman for United Fishermen of Alaska. ``We expect full
compensation.''
   More than four miles of floating boom has been placed in an
effort to contain the oil, the Coast Guard said. Skimming boats
worked to remove the oil.
   The transfer to a second ship of oil remaining aboard the Valdez
resumed during the weekend, and the Coast Guard said it could take
seven days to unload the damaged vessel.
   Iarossi said 36,000 gallons of chemicals that were to be used to
break up the oil were in Anchorage and 19,000 were to be flown from
Texas. Fishermen and other users of the resource-rich sound have
expressed concerns about additional damage that could be done by
chemicals.
   Environmentalists, the governor and other state officials have
accused Exxon and Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. of responding too
slowly to the spill. Alyeska operates the oil-loading terminal at
Valdez.
   Both companies said they were satisfied with how the problem was
being handled.
   ``We're proceeding cautiously,'' said Exxon spokesman Tom
Cirigliano. ``We want to make sure we don't make any mistakes in
cleaning up the spill.''
   Under the terms of the law authoritizing the Alaska pipeline,
the owner-operator of an oil tanker has strict liability for the
first $14 million in damage from a spill, according to Oil Spill
Intelligence Report, a weekly publication in Arlington, Mass.
   If damage exceeds $14 million, claims are paid out of a reserve
that is funded by a tariff on oil companies' Alaskan production.
The reserve has $300 million and can pay up to $100 million per
spill.

   A man accused of threatening to blow up an
airliner has a history of mental problems and has been picked up
for similar threats in the past, including ones against President
Reagan, officials said Monday.
   ``We don't feel that the guy's dangerous, but he's causing
people a lot of trouble,'' said Richard Ward, head of the Secret
Service office in New York.
   Scott Sasonkin, 23, was arrested at Kennedy Airport after he
called the airport police information center late Sunday and told
the operator he put a bomb on a London-bound jet, said Bill Cahill,
a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
which operates the airport.
   Cahill quoted the caller as saying: ``I want $1 million or many
people will die. I planted a bomb on Pan Am flight 102 to London.
It's already in the air.''
   Cahill said the police kept Sasonkin talking for 20 minutes
while they traced the call to a pay phone in the Pan Am terminal
building. He was still talking when police reached him.
   Sasonkin, of the borough of Queens, was charged with attempted
grand larceny for demanding money, falsely reporting an incident
for telling police a bomb was on the plane, and aggravated
harassment for making the call, authorities said.
   Sasonkin was arrested June 27, 1988, for allegedly threatening
President Reagan, Ward said. He's also been picked up several other
times for making threatening calls and each time was committed to a
mental hospital for observation, Ward said.
   Pan Am said the flight was not affected. Sasonkin retracted his
story and denied placing a bomb on the plane, airline spokesman
Jeff Kriendler said.

   A State Department spokeswoman on Monday
praised the Soviet elections, calling them a ``move in the right
direction.''
   ``It goes without saying that yesterday's elections were neither
free nor democratic by Western standards,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. ``But they do represent an advance
over the practices of the past in the Soviet Union,'' she added.
   The elections to the new Congress of People's Deputies were ``a
move in the right direction. It's another sign that they're serious
about perestroika,'' she said.
   Perestroika is the process of restructuring the Soviet economy
undertaken by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Sunday's balloting
was the first time in 70 years that Soviet citizens had a choice of
more than one candidate.
   Asked what the Soviets should have done to comply with Western
standards, Ms. Tutwiler said they should have held ``the same type
of elections, I guess, that we have.''
   Ms. Tutwiler, who made her debut as the department's spokeswoman
at Monday's daily briefing, declined to go further, saying
elaboration on her comments would ``get me in trouble.''

<HEAD>Ozal Vows to Stay in Office Despite Party Defeat in Polls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EMEL ANIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Turgut Ozal on Monday pledged to
stay in office until the end of his term in 1992 despite the
stunning defeat suffered by his Motherland Party in nationwide
local elections.
   Opposition parties had cast Sunday's election as a referendum on
Ozal's free-market policies, and Ozal had vowed to resign if
opposition gains were large enough to make it difficult for him to
govern.
   The governing party came third in the provincial assembly
elections behind the leftist Social Democrat Populist Party and the
conservative True Path Party of former premier Suleyman Demirel.
   The Motherland Party won only three mayorships in Turkey's 67
provincial capitals, down from 54 mayorships it captured in local
elections five years ago.
   Demirel called on Ozal ``to be true to his word'' and resign.
   Ozal promised to shuffle his Cabinet but said he would stay in
office.
   ``The nation gave us a mandate until 1992, we will be serving
the nation until then,'' Ozal, 61, told a news conference.
   In a statement to foreign correspondents, Ozal said the election
results ``would not affect, in any way, the political balance and
the parliamentary arithmetic. (The) Turkish government's
international economic policy and relations will continue
unchanged.''
   Apparently giving assurances to the international business
community, the statement said ``our engagements, including joint
venture arrangements, would suffer no modification.''
   The Motherland Party has a 292-seat majority in the 450-seat
legislature.
   Political analysts attributed Ozal's loss to inflation that rose
to 75 percent in 1988, his family's free-spending lifestyle,
charges of nepotism and alleged corruption by state officials.
   ``The people knew the party in power would not change as a
result of these elections. They wanted to give us a message: to
bring down inflation faster,'' the premier said.
   He said ``a little warning was intended by the voters but it
went a bit too far.''
   Voters elected more than 326,000 provincial assembly members,
City Council members, mayors, village leaders and neighborhood
representatives.
   In the provincial assembly elections, the Social Democrats got
28 percent of the vote nationwide and the True Path had 25.5
percent. Ozal's party was in third place with 22 percent, down from
41 percent in local elections five years ago.
   The rest of the votes were split among four smaller parties.
   The Social Democrats won 31 mayorships out of 54 already
decided, and the True Path won 15.
   Social Democrats ousted incumbent governing party mayors in
Turkey's three largest cities, Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir,
according to the returns announced by the state radio and the
Anatolia news agency.

   Walt Disney World's most popular
attraction these days is its employment office, where the tourist
giant will be hiring up to 4,000 workers a year over the next few
years.
   The employment drive begins next week with a goal of 2,300 new
workers by the end of the month to begin staffing $1.5 billion in
expanded attractions.
   The first, the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, opens May 1.
   Disney also has a new, highly visible employment office, or
``Casting Center'' to help attract workers in what is considered a
tight job market for entry-level, tourism-hotel-restaurant workers
in the area.
   The $10 million center resembles a Venetian Castle with Disney
touches. Mickey Mouse ears adorn its crenelated top and a rotunda
forming the entryway sports 13 golden-colored Disney characters.
   ``We know the market is tough,'' said Robert Wacker, director of
employee relations. ``But we're confident that when jobs pop up,
people will come looking to find them.''
   Disney has in the past few years raised its starting rates to $5
an hour, while many employers pay the current minimum of $3.35.
   Prospective employees get their first taste of Mickey's world in
the Casting Center with a 12-minute film about what it takes to be
a Disney ``cast member.''
   Disney's dress and grooming rules for men include no beards,
moustaches, long hair, earrings or visible tattoos. For women, eye
shadow and frosted hair is out, and no earrings larger than a
quarter.

<TEXT>
   Eugene Profeta, the minister Jessica Hahn
turned to for solace after her sexual encounter with television
evangelist Jim Bakker, got a six-month jail sentence Monday in a
tax case she helped put together.
   A day before being led off to the Albany County Jail on witness
tampering and tax evasion charges, Profeta had delivered a rousing
Easter sermon to his Long Island congregation.
   State Supreme Court Judge Joseph Harris rejected a last-minute
plea from Profeta's lawyer to sentence the minister to community
service work instead of jail. The lawyer, Stephen Scaring, said he
would consider appealing the sentence, which included five years on
probation.
   Profeta had agreed to the sentence in January in exchange for
his guilty pleas to two of 18 charges against him.
   ``I thnk that the Rev. Profeta pled guilty because he simply
didn't want to put his parishioners through the tragedy and trauma
of a court trial,'' Scaring said after Monday's sentencing.
   Hahn, who wasn't present, was Profeta's one-time church
secretary whose sexual encounter with Bakker toppled his PTL
ministry. She helped state investigators put together the case
agaist her former boss after being promised immunity from
prosecution. She has said she also had an affair with Profeta.
   Profeta admitted in his plea bargain that he tried to get Hahn
to lie to the grand jury about his financial dealings and that he
filed a false 1986 income tax return.
   The judge ordered the minister to pay about $26,000 in back
taxes, interest and fines and to stay away from Hahn.
   Harris also dismissed tax evasion charges against Profeta's
wife, Glenda.
   Profeta, 52, stood quietly and chewed gum during Monday's
proceedings. After the sentencing, he kissed his wife goodbye and
was escorted to the county jail in handcuffs by sheriff's deputies.
   About 150 members of Profeta's Full Gospel Tabernacle Church
came to Albany on a bus to watch the sentencing. Before the
proceedings began, Profeta strolled around the courtroom, shaking
hands with and greeting his parishioners.
   After the sentencing, some parishioners cried. Others shouted
``Praise the Lord'' in the courthouse halls.
   At the Easter service, Profeta christened three babies,
performed a marriage and received a standing ovation from
parishioners.
   On top of the normal Sunday contribution, Profeta asked
churchgoers for an extra Easter offering. Those contributing were
given a wooden cross and a checkbook cover inscribed: ``You shall
remember the Lord your god, for it is he who gives you power to get
wealth.''

<HEAD>Army Won't Accept Updated Stinger Missile Until Problem Fixed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has refused for nine months to accept
delivery of a new version of its potent Stinger anti-aircraft
missile because the heat-seeking weapon sometimes can be fooled by
flares, officials said Monday.
   Capt. Barry D. Bomier, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said
the problem with the so-called Stinger-RMP is considered relatively
minor despite the delay in taking deliveries from the General
Dynamics Corp., the missile's producer.
   Bomier said testing of a ``fixed'' version of the new missile is
under way, and ``We don't expect it to take much longer.''
   ``We expect the problem that we have can be resolved with
modifications to the (computer) software (in the guidance
system),'' he said.
   ``But the Army is not going to accept that missile until it can
do what we expect it to do and what is written into our contract.''
   General Dynamics acknowledged through its Washington office
Monday there had been a problem with the Stinger-RMP and that it
was working with the Army to correct it.
   But Jim Gilkerson, a spokesman for General Dynamics' Valley
Systems Division in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., where the missile is
made, refused Monday to discuss when the new round of testing might
be completed and deliveries started.
   The Stinger, renowned for its performance in Afghanistan where
it helped U.S.-backed resistance fighters overcome Soviet air
power, is a shoulder-fired missile for use against airplanes or
helicopters.
   The basic Stinger, delivered to the Army in 1979, is a
heat-seeking missile and can be fooled by some types of flares. The
Stinger-RMP is designed to overcome that problem with a more
sophisticated guidance system.
   The ``RMP'' in the name stands for reprogrammable
micro-processor. The new missile features removable computer
software that can be updated to compensate for new types of flares
or threats as they develop.
   The problem that General Dynamics is working to correct surfaced
during final testing of the new missile and involves the missile's
failure to ignore certain types of flares when they are ejected
from a hovering helicopter.
   Army and corporate officials decline to elaborate further _
citing security classifications _ but stress the problem crops up
only in one situation and that even with the one flaw, the
Stinger-RMP is a much more effective weapon that the basic Stinger.
   ``The weapon works,'' Bomier said. ``The problem involves only
one target under certain selected conditions. We haven't stopped
buying the missile. We just haven't accepted it yet.''
   The Army has awarded two contracts to General Dynamics for the
Stinger-RMP. They total about $900 million and call for delivery of
about 23,000 of the missiles through May 1991.
   In the meantime, the older models of the missile still are being
used.
   General Dynamics continues to produce the new missile while the
fix is developed for the computer software and it is warehousing
them in the interim. Bomier said the company is paying the cost of
storage.

   Margaret Tutwiler made her debut as chief
State Department spokeswoman Monday, cautioning reporters that she
was not knowledgeable about foreign policy and asking their
``patience and understanding.''
   ``As you all know, I am not, and do not claim to be, an expert
in foreign policy,'' Tutwiler said, reading a statement at the
start of the daily State Department briefing.
   ``But I do claim to have a fair amount of experience in working
with the press, and I do know this president and this secretary of
state very well,'' she added.
   Ms. Tutwiler, 38, served as Secretary of State James A. Baker's
spokeswoman when he was treasury secretary in the Reagan
administration and worked for George Bush when he made his
unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980.
   Ms. Tutwiler, who is considered one of Baker's closest advisers,
was confirmed by the Senate earlier this month. She has a tough act
to follow in her job as assistant secretary of state for public
affairs.
   Her predecessor, Charles Redman, is a career foreign service
officer with experience in U.S. diplomatic posts overseas. Redman,
who has been nominated ambassador to Sweden, enjoyed close ties
with former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and was adept at
handling the department's press corps.
   ``I have no intention of ever standing up here and winging it,
or guessing, or misleading,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``When I don't
know something, I'll tell you I don't. I sincerely ask for your
patience and understanding.''
   Ms. Tutwiler, speaking in a pronounced southern accent which
appeared to puzzle some of the foreign reporters, was careful to
stick closely to briefing answers prepared in advance by the
department's regional experts.
   She read a statement that praised the Soviet elections but said
they did not comply with Western standards. Asked ``what was
missing,'' she declined to answer, saying, ``You're going to get me
in trouble.''

<HEAD>State Sues Feds For $157 Million In Welfare Payments</HEAD>

   New York state sued the federal government
Monday for $157 million in welfare reimbursements that state
officials charge Washington has illegally withheld.
   State social service officials charged in the lawsuit, filed in
federal court in New York City, that the federal government has
refused to give state and its local governments money owed for five
separate years, dating to 1979.
   The reimbursements are the federal share of the Aid for Families
with Dependent Children program dealing with children placed in
foster care. State Social Services Commissioner Cesar Perales said
federal officials have never acknowledged that New York filed for
the reimbursements.
   ``We are paying. We are providing the service,'' Perales told
reporters. ``The issue here is that the federal government is not
paying its share.''
   Perales said ``just about every other state is owed money''
totaling about $600 million. He mentioned California and Texas as
two states with a similar problem.
   ``We're talking about a system in which the federal government
says, `We're going to help you finance the care of your children in
foster care,''' Perales said. ``We rely on that trust and
relationship. ... We are relying on the good faith of the federal
government.''
   David Siegel, a spokesman at the U.S. Family Support
Administration, said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not
immediately comment. The agency, part the Department of Health and
Human Services, administers the foster care program.
   The $157 million consists of reimbursements the state claims
it's owed for 1979, 1980, 1983, 1987 and 1988, Perales said. Some
$50 million would go to the state, about $80 million would go to
New York City and $27 million would go to other local governments,
said state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   The federal government estimates how much the state will need to
run the foster care program each quarter. According to Abrams and
Perales, Washington is supposed to reimburse the state whenever
actual costs for the quarter are higher than the federal estimate,
but didn't in these cases.
   Abrams, a Democrat, accused the Republican Reagan administration
of trying to balance the federal deficit ``on the backs of those
who can least afford to deal with that problem _ individuals who
are vulnerable, who are disabled.''

<TEXT>
   A defense consultant pleaded guilty today
to bribing a public official and conspiracy in the most recent
plea-bargaining arrangement in the government's massive defense
purchasing scandal.
   William L. Parkin, 65, entered the plea a week before he was
scheduled to go on trial in U.S. District Court.
   Parkin was hospitalized March 21 after, sources said, he took an
overdose of pills.
   He was accused of paying a former Navy official $1,000 every few
months in exchange for classified documents.
   Appearing before U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton, Parkin
pleaded guilty to bribing a public official, wire fraud and
conspiracy to defraud the United States. In exchange, other charges
against him were dropped and he agreed to cooperate with the
government.
   His head low, Parkin entered his pleas in a soft voice and told
the judge that the charges against him were accurate, ``as far as
it pertains to me.''
   Parkin could be sentenced to a maximum of 25 years in jail and a
fine of $750,000.
   Parkin's plea came just three days after Stuart Berlin, the
suspended Navy official, pleaded guilty to receiving bribes from
Parkin and another consultant, Fred Lackner.
   Teledyne Industries also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud
the United States last Friday. Parkin had a $150,000 consulting
contract with Teledyne.
   On April 3, Lackner and three Teledyne officials are scheduled
to go on trial. It will be the first trial involving the
government's nearly 3-year-old investigation of the Pentagon's
purchasing scandal known as ``The Ill Wind'' investigation.

<HEAD>No Shelter from the Tax Collector After a Nuclear Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It will take something more than a nuclear
attack to wipe out your obligations to the Internal Revenue Service.
   However, an addition to the Internal Revenue Manual, which is
supposed to guide the conduct of all IRS employees, acknowledges
that tax collection might suffer if the bomb is dropped. Once the
emergency is over, the manual declares, ``operations will be
concentrated on collecting the taxes which will produce the greater
revenue yield.''
   IRS spokesman Johnell Hunter said Monday that the new section _
titled ``National Emergency Operations'' _ was added to the manual
in response to a directive to government departments from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. The two-page policy statement
is dated Dec. 14, 1988.
   ``In the event of a national emergency (especially resulting
from nuclear attack) the primary function of the service is to
support the secretary of the Treasury,'' the manual states. ``This
support as a minimum will consist of analyzing and reporting upon
emergency tax legislation, prescribing regulations and forms,
issuing rulings and technical information of an emergency nature.''
   Within 30 days after an attack emergency, the agency would
expect to resume assessing and collecting taxes. At that time, the
manual states, many employees might find themselves reassigned to
carry out essential functions ``regardless of and without any
effect on the current positions or grades of the employee.''
   ``On the premise that the collection of delinquent accounts
would be most adversely affected, and in many cases would be
impossible in a disaster area, the service will concentrate on the
collection of current taxes,'' the manual says. ``However, in areas
where the taxpaying potential is substantially unimpaired, enforced
collection of delinquent accounts will be continued.''

<TEXT>
   Differences will remain between China and the
Soviet Union even after they resume normal diplomatic relations at
their first summit in 30 years, China's foreign minister said
Monday.
   Soviet support for Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia is regarded by
China as the most serious obstacle to better ties between Beijing
and Moscow, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said the issue will be
high on the agenda when Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
visits China in May.
   Qian told a news conference that the visit will lead to normal
diplomatic relations, but there will still be ``some way to go and
some efforts to be made'' before two countries resolve all their
differences.
   Qian said China, which supports the anti-Vietnamese resistance
in Cambodia, backs the dispatch of a U.N. peacekeeping force after
Vietnam ends its 10-year occupation.
   He said China is not preparing to send troops to Cambodia to
participate in a proposed peacekeeping force.
   The Chinese-Soviet summit, the first since Nikita S. Khrushchev
and Mao Tse-tung met in 1959, follows the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan and a Soviet announcement this month it
would withdraw of 75 percent the 50,000 Soviet forces from Mongolia
_ two Soviet moves to ease its long-strained relationship with
China.
   Khrushchev and Mao later clashed over ideology, and Soviet and
Chinese troops clashed in the 1960s and 1970s along the 4,670-mile
border.
   At the news conference, Qian said Sino-U.S. relations have
progressed smoothly since diplomatic ties were formed a decade ago.
Relations, he said, ``enjoy vast potential and the prospects are
very good.''
   But he also called on a ``new pattern'' of relations based on
mutual trust, and had sharp words for members of the U.S. Congress
who have criticized China's lack of democratic reform and its human
rights record in Tibet.
   ``A small number of people in the American Congress are actually
very ill-informed about the situation in Tibet. They have very
strong prejudice.''
   China last week criticized both the European Parliament and the
U.S. Congress for statements concerning the declaration of martial
law in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa following pro-independence
riots this month.
   Qian said the Lhasa rioters were trying to split the Chinese
nation and foreign nations that raise the human rights question are
interfering in China's internal affairs.
   Human rights, he added, are a matter of basic questions such as
providing adequate food and education and ``are inseparable with
the actual condition of the country involved.''
   He noted China still has 200 million illiterate people. ``There
are things that can be easily achieved in some countries but not in
others.''

   A travel service that arranges trips to Cuba for
Cuban exiles has been bombed, the 11th attack in two years on
agencies that handle passengers and packages bound for the
communist island.
   Federal and local authorities said Monday they are renewing
their investigation of the case.
   Militant anticommunist Cuban exiles are the prime suspects in
the bombings.
   Just before midnight Sunday two small bombs blasted holes in the
outside wall of Marazul Charters, the only company authorized to
handle trips for Cuban exiles wanting to visit their homeland. No
one was hurt, but the explosion also shattered a window and light
fixtures in businesses across a narrow canal.
   ``We're actively investigating, but we haven't identified a
suspect yet,'' said George Kiszynski, spokesman for the Miami FBI
office. He said the Metro-Dade police bomb squad was gathering
evidence to identify the detonation method for the two bombs.
   There have been 13 similar bombings in the Miami area over the
last two years _ 11 at agencies doing business with Cuba, one aimed
at an art museum showing work by Cuban artists and one at the home
of the sponsor of a forum on U.S.-Cuban relations.
   Marazul's owner, Francisco Aruca, has spoken in favor of closer
relations with Cuba, an anathema to some in Miami's anti-Castro
community.
   The bombings were the work of ``fanatical and radical elements
in the community,'' Aruca said Monday. ``Anyone who perceives a
softening of the attitude toward a dialogue with Castro can expect
to have that happen to them.''
   The bombing apparently did not frighten off Marazul's customers,
who often have to wait months for seats on the twice-a-week charter
flights to visit relatives in Cuba.
   ``My husband would like to see his mother before she dies,''
Hilda Aybar said while waiting in front of the agency. ``I don't
see why he shouldn't go.''
   Threats phoned to Marazul and other agencies criticize them for
indirectly supporting Castro by providing hard currency to Cuba,
and more broadly by softening attitudes toward the communist
government.
   The latest bombing came three days after another Miami agency
announced the first direct mail to Cuba, and two weeks after the
Kiwanis Club of Little Havana, which sponsored Miami's Calle Ocho
street party, caused a controversy by banning any singers who had
performed in Cuba.

   The commander of Lebanon's Christian army
units has asked President Bush to support his drive to expel all
Syrian troops from his country, officials said Monday.
   In a letter to Bush, Gen. Michel Aoun said he was determined to
achieve the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon, said a
U.S. official who saw the letter. The official spoke only on
condition he not be named.
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Beirut and eastern Lebanon,
while Israeli forces _ estimated to number about 1,000 _ and an
allied Christian militia patrol a cordon of southern Lebanon along
the border with Israel.
   Aoun contends the Syrians, who intervened in Lebanon 13 years
ago as peacekeepers, have turned into an occupation force by taking
sides with Moslems and Druse. He heads a Christian military cabinet
in Lebanon's divided government while Syria backs the rival Moslem
government.
   In his campaign to drive out the Syrians, Aoun's predominantly
Christian units have been engaged since March 8 in a fierce
artillery battle in Beirut with an alliance of Syrian troops and
militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party. The fighting is considered the worst Beirut has known in
recent years.
   In his letter, Aoun said ``he sees himself as the spearhead''
for removing Syrian forces and restoring the country's sovereignty,
the U.S. official said.
   ``He wanted to gauge our reaction to this and our ability to
assist,'' he added.
   Aoun did not ask for any specific help; rather he wants U.S.
understanding for his plan ``and moral support,'' the official said.
   Bush will be responding to the letter, likely reiterating the
U.S. position of neutrality in the conflict, he said.
   The State Department issued two statements last week urging
Christians, Moslems and Syrians to cease fire and negotiate, either
directly or through the Arab League.
   U.S. officials are in contact with all sides in an obvious show
of neutrality, but have refused to mediate after failing last year
in mediation attempts between the Christians and Syrians.

<TEXT>
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole on Monday urged
breaking down bureaucratic barriers between programs aimed at
preventing school dropouts, saying a ``fragmented, piecemeal,
programmatic approach'' doesn't work.
   She began a 10-city fact-finding tour of Labor Department
regional offices during which she is meeting with officials and
students in youth job training and employment programs. The tour
ends April 4 in Boston.
   ``We need a way to tie together the programs both federally and
most definitely at the community level,'' she told civic leaders,
teachers and students in Atlanta's Exodus program, founded in
Atlanta in 1971 to combat Georgia's 34 percent dropout rate. The
program now is in 31 cities.
   She said her tour is designed to help learn which programs work
and which do not.
   Mrs. Dole said the information will be used to start programs to
identify needs of individual students in 12 cities to be picked
later. These are to be converted to model programs in five cities.
   She said current programs often overlap or duplicate each other
and lack follow-up studies.
   Mrs. Dole said much of what she referred to as the ``skills gap
and the motivation gap'' is rooted in a time when there were fewer
possibilities for young people in the job market and when
expectations were lower.
   ``Everyone can have a job today who wants a job if he has the
skills,'' she said. ``But you've got to have the skills.
   ``It's a new day,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``We've got a real mission
here together to accomplish this.''
   Mrs. Dole said she believes her primary goal is to ensure that
the United States has the best-trained labor force in the world.
But she noted that youth unemployment nationally is at 16 percent
and that minority youth unemployment is at 35 percent, or even
higher in some areas.
   ``We must look at our own situation,'' she said, adding that she
will urge other federal departments, such as Education and Health
and Human Services, to tie programs together with the Labor
Department. ``Are we training people for the jobs of yesterday or
the jobs of tomorrow?''

   Articles of impeachment were sent
Monday to the full House against state Treasurer A. James Manchin,
who was charged with improper handling of a fund that lost $279
million and covering up the losses.
   Neither Manchin, 61, a popular, flamboyant Democrat in his
second term as treasurer, nor his lawyer would comment immediately
on the 17-7 vote by which the House Judiciary Committee recommended
18 impeachment articles to the House.
   The committee also voted 22-3 to recommend censure of state
Auditor Glen Gainer for his role in the losses in the consolidated
investment fund, which was under the overall control in 1987 of a
board upon which Gainer and Manchin served. The fund was under the
direct investment power of the treasurer.
   House Speaker Chuck Chambers said the 100-member House is
expected to take up the resolution Wednesday. A simple majority is
needed to send it to the Senate.
   Senate President Larry Tucker, anticipating Manchin's
impeachment by the House, told the Senate last week to be prepared
to sit as a jury in late May.
   It would take 23 ``yes'' votes in the Senate _ two-thirds of the
34 members _ to convict. That could lead to Manchin's removal from
office and loss of a pension estimated at at least $2,128 a month.
   The judiciary committee voted 19-6 last Wednesday to formalize
16 impeachment articles and the final vote on the document was
taken Monday.
   Added Monday were articles charging that Manchin put an
unqualified person in control of the state's investment portfolio
after two previous treasury employees left and that the treasurer's
office charged for handling investments in the fund.
   The articles charge Manchin with failing to supervise the fund,
delegation of his power and authority, making improper investments
of state funds, paying out funds that were not earned, and covering
up the losses, which occurred mainly in April, May and June 1987.
   Manchin's chief defender on the committee, Delegate Jim Pitrolo,
said a minority report signed by six members is being prepared to
present to the House. ``We don't feel there is evidence to
impeach,'' said Pitrolo.
   Gainer's censure motion, which amounts to a public reprimand,
said he failed to adequately supervise the fund and to fulfill his
public duties.

   Sam Malone, Rebecca Howe, Carla Tortelli,
Woody Boyd and the other denizens of Boston's favorite watering
hole are returning for an eighth season of ``Cheers,'' NBC
announced Monday.
   The highly rated Thursday-night comedy stars Ted Danson, Kirstie
Alley, Rhea Pearlman and Woody Harrelson behind the bar and George
Wendt, John Ratzenberger, Kelsey Grammer and Bebe Neuwirth on the
stools.
   Joan Severence joins the cast later this season as Rebecca's
sister, Susan Howe, a former Miss San Diego, who will become a love
interest for Malone. She will be back next season in at least five
episodes.
   Contrary to the supermarket tabloids, Shelley Long is not
returning to the show, said Maggie Begley, a spokeswoman for
Paramount Television. Long played Diane Chambers on ``Cheers'' in
the 1982-87 seasons, then left to pursue a career in movies. She's
currently starring in ``Troop Beverly Hills.''
   The Long rumor began when a reporter overheard her and Danson
talking at the premiere of ``Cousins,'' which stars Danson.
   The conversation was a ``wouldn't it be nice'' kind of talk
about Long's return, said Begley. There has never been any
discussion between the producers and her representatives about her
return to the show.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans aren't responding to President
Bush's ``thousand points of light'' message by giving more time and
money to charity, a poll released Monday says.
   Most of the 1,010 people polled by the Marist Institute of
Public Opinion said they planned no changes in the time they
volunteer to charity or money they give, said Dennis Murray,
president of Marist College in Poughkeepsie.
   Bush, as part of his call for a ``kinder and gentler'' America,
has asked Americans to give more time and money to charity.
   ``Most people feel that they are giving at their limit and are
giving a fair amount,'' said Murray, author of ``The Guaranteed
Fund-Raising System.''
   Half the people polled said they donate time to a religious
group or civic or community organization. Eighty-five percent of
Americans contribute money to churches, charities or civic groups,
the poll found.
   Slightly more than two-thirds of the respondents said they'd
give the same amount of time and money to charity in 1989 as they
did last year. The survey found 19 percent planned to give more
money this year and 12 percent would give less, largely because
they had more or less money to spend.
   Similarly, 83 percent of those who don't volunteer time now
don't plan to change their habits, the survey found.
   ``The people who are in positions of leadership in this country,
be they religious, political or civic leaders, are going to have to
make a very clear case for additional giving and additional
involvement,'' Murray said.
   Non-profit groups need to better show how the money and time
makes a direct impact, Murray said. Too many groups seem more
preoccupied with their fund-raising than what the money is actually
going to do, he said.
   ``The people who are involved and are already giving understand
what the social needs are,'' he said.
   The survey, conducted by telephone in the lower 48 states from
Jan. 29 to Feb. 1, also found that women are more likely than men
to give time or money to charity. The margin of error was plus or
minus 3.5 percent.

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Monday urged the
Marxist government of Angola to accept a peace proposal put forth
by U.S.-backed rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
   The proposals by Savimbi's National Union of the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) ``are a significant step in that
direction, and are deserving of broad support,'' State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   She said the United States urged the government in Luanda ``to
respond positively to UNITA's gestures and offer of peace.''
   Savimbi, who has been fighting the government for 14 years, has
called a four-month halt to attacks on Cuban-aided government
troops in order to bring about peace talks.
   He also has pledged not to interfere with reconstruction of the
strategic east-west Benguela railway, destroyed by rebel attacks,
and he said he would be willing to release 100 captured government
soldiers.
   The United States, which gives UNITA an estimated $15 million in
weapons annually, has been embarrassed by recent reports of human
rights violations by Savimbi.
   Savimbi has denied the reports, which include allegations that
he ordered the torture and killings of rebel dissidents, and U.S.
officials say they are investigating.
   UNITA wants to take advantage of a recently signed,
U.S.-sponsored agreement for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from
Angola in order to start talks on power sharing with the government.
   But so far, the government has refused to negotiate with the
rebels, even though there is little prospect for a military victory
by either side. Savimbi acknowledges he cannot win a conventional
war against the Cuban-backed government forces, but his rebels have
for years controlled about a third of the country.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest levels in more
than four years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 9.1 percent, up from 9 percent last
week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 9.12 percent, up from 9.04 percent last
week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 9.38
percent and six-month bills averaged 9.59 percent on Oct. 29, 1984.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors

<HEAD>USDA Says Sugar Can Cut Amount of Food Poisoning Bacteria in Chickens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Monday that
either ordinary lactose _ milk sugar _ or another sugar from a
Mediterranean plant can sharply reduce the amount of common food
poisoning bacteria in the intestines of chickens destined for the
consumer market.
   Preliminary tests showed that the number of salmonella bacteria
in infected chickens can be reduced in a significant number of the
birds by 99.9 percent for a cost of pennies a day, said USDA
biochemist John R. DeLoach of the Agricultural Research Service,
College Station, Texas.
   DeLoach said in a report issued here by the agency that lactose
and D-mannose were added to the drinking water of chicks dosed with
100 million Salmonella typhirmurium bacteria.
   When the 10-day-old chicks were compared with birds that had
received the bacteria but no sugars, only 53 percent of the birds
on lactose and only 26 percent of those on D-mannose had any
salmonella bacteria, he said.
   ``It's not only important how many birds had salmonella, but how
many salmonella bacteria those birds had,'' DeLoach said. ``The
birds treated with either mannose or lactose had 99.9 percent fewer
salmonella than the control birds in those experiments.''
   DeLoach added: ``Lactose worked just as well as mannose, and the
cost of lactose in drinking water might be no more than two cents
per bird. Right now, if the poultry producer put his birds on
D-mannose for 10 days, it would cost him 50 cents a bird.''
   The exact amount of bacterial contamination in poultry is
unclear, but USDA and private estimates have ranged from 35 percent
to 60 percent nationally. Salmonella and other organisms can be
spread when slaughtered birds are put through eviscerating machines
and their intestinal contents are spilled.
   DeLoach was part of a team studying salmonella at the agency's
veterinary toxicology research unit at College Station.
   D-mannose is produced naturally by the Fraxinus ornus plant
along the Mediterranean basin, the report said. The sugar _
seminose and carubinose _ is available commercially in the United
States. A sister compound, mannitol, has been used for years as a
stabilizer and preservative in pharmaceutical products.
   The report said D-mannose reduces the ability of salmonella
bacteria to settle in a chicken's intestines, forcing the organisms
to pass harmlessly out of the bird. Studies are still under way on
how lactose works.

   Thousands of volunteers are being used to help
farmers comply with new federal conservation requirements, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   A record 8,222 volunteers helped the department's Soil
Conservation Service in the 1988 fiscal year that ended last Sept.
30, almost a four-fold increase from 2,223 the previous year.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the agency, said the unpaid helpers
will be recognized during National Volunteer Week, April 9-15.
   ``We're in the midst of one of the biggest conservation efforts
in history, and volunteers andre playing a key role,'' he said.
   Scaling referred to provisions in the 1985 farm law requiring
farmers with highly erodible crop land to have a conservation plan
approved by the agency no later than Dec. 31, 1989, and to have it
implemented by Dec. 31, 1994.
   The volunteers, called the Earth Team by the agency, include
college students to retired people. They're used for a variety of
jobs, including design and layout of conservation practices on
individual farms, educational activities, and computer and general
office assistance.
   Scaling said anyone interested in joining the program can call a
toll-free number, 1-800-THE SOIL to find out more information, or
they can contact local SCS offices, which are located in nearly all
counties.

   Here is a look at some other major oil spills and their effects.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FRANCE-AMOCO CADIZ</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The 220,000-ton tanker Amoco Cadiz, owned by a subsidiary of
Standard Oil of Indiana, ran aground March 16, 1978, after tow
lines snapped, impaling the vessel on rocks two miles off the
western French coast.
   At least 68 million gallons of light Gulf crude oil spilled out
along about 100 miles of Brittany coastline. The spill created an
oil slick 18 miles wide and 80 miles long, blackened beaches, and
killed thousands of birds and millions of sea creatures. Local
industries such as tourism, fishing, and particularly the oyster
industry, were seriously affected.
   The French government has paid out as much as $100 million in
clean-up costs and compensation to those affected by the spill. In
February, a judge recommended a $115.2 million judgment against
Amoco Corp., with the French government slated to recieve $44.4
million and affected towns about $7.5 million.
   Today, Brittany's beaches are again clean, the fishermen are at
work again and the oyster beds productive. But insidious damages,
like the death of small animals which other fish had fed from, have
caused the gradual disappearance of certain species, and officials
say the total fallout from the pollution has not yet been evaluated.

<NOTE>NANTUCKET-ARGO MERCHANT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Argo Merchant, a Liberian tanker, was lost in the early
morning darkness on Dec. 15, 1976, when it ran onto a shoal off
Nantucket Island in Massachusetts. Winds and waves battered the
ship while the Coast Guard tried to save it. The tanker leaked oil
until it finally broke apart nine days later and lost the rest of
its cargo. A total of 7.6 million gallons of residual oil (not
crude) were spilled.
   Winds were blowing offshore, and the oil drifted into the open
ocean. A few months later, no oil could be found on the ocean
bottom. No serious harm to the waters or fish were detected.
   In 1980, a federal court ruled that the Argo Merchant was an
unsafe ship, citing general mismanagement, neglect, and navigation
errors.

<NOTE>PACIFIC NORTHWEST-BARGE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Approximately 231,000 gallons of heavy bunker oil spilled from a
barge off the southwest Washington coast on Dec. 22, 1988, after
the tug towing the barge struck it while maneuvering to secure a
towing line.
   The spill fooled officials, who predicted it would be broken up
in heavy seas. However, a few days after the accident, a storm
pushed the oil back toward land, where it washed up on hundreds of
miles of beaches, including pristine wilderness beaches in Olympic
National Park and Canada's Pacific Rim National Park.
   A massive cleanup effort followed, involving professional and
volunteer crews. Still, up to 10,000 birds died and effects of the
pollution will linger for years.
   The Oregon company whose tug was towing the barge, Sause
Brothers Ocean Towing Co., agreed to pay cleanup costs. The state's
cost to date is $350,000, of which Sause Brothers has paid $115,000.
   A marine resource damage-assessment team is investigating the
spill's effects on everything from surf smelt and sea otters, to
subsistence seafood harvesting by Indian tribes. A price tag will
be put on the whole package, including a cost per dead bird and for
such ephemeral items as lost recreational opportunities.

<HEAD>Compromise Ends 10-Year Battle Over Child Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MACON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade of bargaining between the Air Force
Logistics Command and a federal workers' union has ended with the
military offering child care to the command's 83,000 civilian
employees nationwide.
   The Association of Federal Government Employees since 1978 had
sought Air Force funding for union-operated day care for children
of civilian AFLC employees.
   The agreement gives control to the Air Force, which by October
will expand its existing AFLC child-care facilities and offer them
to all families of civilian workers. Families of uniformed
personnel in the Air Force, as in other services, have had access
to subsidized day care for decades.
   The initial cost of expanding the service, which officials won't
disclose, will be borne by the Air Force. Operating costs for
civilian child care will be paid by parents who enroll their
children, and service fees will be set by each base, according to
officials at the command's headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.
   The agreement was reached Feb. 27 with little publicity. On
Monday the Macon Telegraph &amp; News ran an account of how the
agreement will affect the command's 15,100 employees at Robins Air
Force Base in central Georgia.
   At Robins, 20 civilians are on a waiting list for day care,
which accommodates 32 children of civilians along with 142
dependents of military personnel, said base commander Billy
Edenfield.
   The first priority for on-base child care has been for military
families, and just 1,000 children of civilian workers are enrolled
in the AFLC centers nationwide, said AFLC spokesman Ken Perrotte.
   Along with Robins, expanded day-care centers will be established
at five air logistics centers: Ogden, Utah; Sacramento, Calif.;
Oklahoma City; and San Antonio.
   Under the agreement, child care for civilians also will be
offered at Wright-Patterson and the Aerospace Guidance and
Meteorology Center at Newark AFB in Ohio.
   ``This has been an important issue for our command, and I'm very
pleased we were able to work this out in a manner that will best
serve not only the Air Force and the AFGE, but also our children,''
said Gen. Alfred Hansen, who became AFLC commander in August 1987.

<HEAD>Agents Arrest 33 In Interstate Bookmaking Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 33 people have been arrested
in Central Florida in a multimillion-dollar, interstate sports
betting ring, state and federal officials announced Monday.
   Those arrested allegedly accepted or placed bets in Florida with
an operation based in Louisville, Ky., ranging from hundreds to
thousands of dollars on events in college and professional
basketball, football and baseball, and horse races.
   While arrests were made in Florida, the FBI in Louisville was
seizing six facilities associated with the operation and began
serving search warrants on suspected leaders of the organization,
said Peter Antonacci, Florida's statewide prosecutor.
   Phone taps were used in the investigation, which began in late
1987.
   ``We've got calls where thousands were bet by one person on one
game,'' said Don Marblestone, assistant statewide prosecutor.
``We're not talking people betting 10, 20, 30 bucks.''
   Arrested and accused of leading the operation's Florida division
were Robert Kopp, 45 and his wife, Shirley, 32, of Orlando.
   According to information gathered through the wiretaps, the
Kopps were salaried employees of the Kentucky organization and
earned $150,000 a year, said Marblestone.
   They face charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit
racketeering and 30 counts of bookmaking. Kopp's bond was set at
$250,000 and Mrs. Kopp's was set at $50,000. If convicted, Kopp
faces up to 22 years in prison and Mrs. Kopp faces up to seven
years, said Marblestone.
   Most of the other people arrested were bettors. They face
misdemeanor charges.

<HEAD>Government Claims Guerrilla Attack on Jalalabad Collapsing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials said Monday the attack by
Moslem guerrillas around Jalalabad was collapsing and the rest of
the country was ``very calm and quiet.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman would not rule out the possibility,
however, that the guerrillas were regrouping to continue the fight
at Jalalabad, their first major offensive since Soviet military
forces withdrew Feb. 15.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a guerrilla group claimed 53 soldiers
were killed and five aircraft shot down in weekend fighting around
the strategic city on the main road from Kabul to the Pakistani
border.
   The Afghan News Agency, associated with rebel leader Gulbaddin
Hekmatyar, said insurgents had captured several army posts north of
Jalalabad in heavy fighting since Saturday.
   It gave no figures on guerrilla casualties, but on Sunday the
official Afghan radio said nearly 350 were killed. Claims by the
two sides usually conflict, and no independent confirmation is
possible.
   Mohammad Nabi Amani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman in Kabul,
said guerrillas fired only 250 rockets and shells at Jalalabad in
the 24-hour period ending at sundown Monday, compared with 12,000
in the previous 24 hours.
   ``Our armed forces detected their place of attack and shelled
(them),'' he told reporters. ``As a result, 190 of the extremists
were killed and 70 were wounded.''
   He said two government soldiers and three civilians were killed
and five soldiers and nine civilians wounded.
   ``Extremists'' is what the government calls the guerrillas who
begqan fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet
soldiers arrived in December 1979, and an estimated 115,000 were in
Afghanistan when the U.N.-mediated withdrawal began last May.
   Despite the lull he reported in fighting at Jalalabad, 75 miles
east of Kabul, Amani said it was too soon for foreign journalists
to visit.
   Asked whether the reported decline in guerrilla activity could
mean they were regrouping for a fresh attack, he said: ``We're of
the opinion that they are drawing a conclusion that they cannot
achieve any success through military means,'' but whether they
would attack again was open to question.
   A guerrilla victory there would give them control of their first
major city and provide a base for the ``interim government'' they
elected Feb. 23 in Pakistan.
   ``Except for minor military activities in border provinces,
including Herat, the rest of the nation led a very calm and quiet
life,'' and at Jalalabad the attacks are ``weakening and
disintegrating,'' he said.
   Herat is near the the border with Iran, Afghanistan's neighbor
to the west and the base for eight predominantly Shiite Moslem
insurgent groups. The Shiites frequently are at odds with the seven
predominantly Sunni Moslem groups that operate from Pakistan.
   Amani claimed Pakistani miitiamen and advisers from Saudi Arabia
had been killed fighting with the guerrillas, but he gave no
figures. Abdul Haq, a rebel commander outside Kabul, claimed in a
report mailed to news organizaions that Indian military advisers
and pilots were with Afghan forces near the Soviet border.
   Officials in Kabul often claim Pakistani troops, along with U.S.
and Saudi military advisers, help the insurgents. All three
countries acknowledge supporting the guerrillas but deny direct
involvement.
   Previous guerrilla reports have said Indian and Soviet pilots
were bombing their forces, but both countries deny it.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said he was incorrctly informed
Sunday when he told reporters all passengers on two small buses
were killed by guerrilla rocket attacks. He said ``a number''
survived and were in Kabul hospitals.
   One attack occurred on the Jalalabad-Kabul highway and the other
on the road linking kabul with the northeastern province of
Laghman, Amani said.
   Kabul, a city of 2.2 million, was quiet Monday and has been for
a week.

<HEAD>Bush Urged To Move Fast To Avert New Trade Deficit Spiral</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The improving U.S. trade deficit, the biggest
factor promoting domestic growth last year, is on the verge of
stalling out unless the Bush administration moves quickly to
devalue the dollar and reach a budget agreement with Congress, a
research institute warned Monday.
   The Institute for International Economics said that unless the
United States is able to get its trade problems under control, the
country faces the threat of a recession, triggered by the flight of
foreigners from U.S. investments.
   There is also a danger that rising trade deficit would force
Congress and the administration to erect protectionist trade
barriers that would threaten a global trade war, according to the
study, ``American Trade Adjustment: the Global Impact.''
   The report said without needed policy changes, America's trade
deficit will begin rising again in 1990 and by 1992 will surpass
the record imbalance of $154 billion set in 1987.
   The forecast covers the current account, the broadest measure of
U.S. trade, because it includes not only trade in merchandise but
also trade in services, primarily investment flows between
countries.
   The current account deficit shrank 12 percent to $135 billion in
1988 as a boom in U.S. export sales accounted for almost half of
total economic growth last year.
   The report said this improvement was about to stall out because
high U.S. consumption spending was continuing to pull in imports
while the dollar's value was not low enough to spur further gains
in U.S. export sales.
   The report recommended that the Bush administration persuade
America's major allies to accept a further devaluation of the
dollar. It said the dollar needed to drop another 25 percent
against the yen and another 20 percent against the West German mark.
   Since February 1987, the United States has promoted a
dollar-stabilization effort in the face of protests from U.S.
allies, including Japan and West Germany, that the greenback
already had fallen enough from its highs in 1985.
   The report called on the Bush administration to work with
Congress to meet the targets of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction
law, which calls for a balanced budget by 1993.
   William Cline, a senior fellow at the institute and the author
of the report, said a reduction in the federal budget deficit would
dampen the growth of domestic demand in this country and thus
reduce America's appetite for foreign goods.
   The study said if the Bush administration and Congress act
quickly to implement the budget cuts, it would accomplish the shift
from a consumption-driven economy to an export-driven economy
without a recession.
   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the institute, said the risks of a
recession are greater now because in the past three years America
has borrowed an additional $428 billion from the rest of the world
to finance its huge current account deficits. Those deficits mean
that Americans are handing over billions of dollars to foreigners
to pay for imported products.
   Unless the trade improvements are resumed, America's net debt
will top $1 trillion by the end of 1992, the report forecast. The
net debt represents the excess in foreign investments in this
country over what Americans own overseas.
   The growing debt burdens run the risk of a ``collapse of
confidence in the dollar, triggering a further surge of inflation
and interest rates _ and possibly a recession,'' the report said.
   Cline said the administration should have as a goal lowering the
current account deficit from $150 billion to an annual rate of $50
billion, which he said was a more realistic figure than trying for
total elimination of the deficit.
   The report, which used computer models to simulate global trade
flows, reached these other conclusions:
   _The U.S. trade deficit would drop by $9 billion to $13 billion
in 1992 for every percentage point boost in growth in the economies
of America's major trading partners.
   _The trade deficit would narrow by between $8 billion and $10
billion in 1992 for every percentage point decline in the dollar's
exchange rate value. The report said the trade-weighted value of
the dollar against all currencies needed to fall by 10 percent.
   _The trade deficit would improve by $15 billion for every
percentage point drop in America's economic growth rate, reflecting
a lower demand for imports.
   The institute is a non-partisan research organization which
specializes in studies of international economic issues. It
receives its financial support from private foundations and
corporations, both in the United States and overseas.

<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin completed a stunning political
comeback with his landslide victory over a candidate who symbolized
power and prestige.
   Yet, his broad base of political support translates to little
real power in his bid to challenge the government and the Communist
Party bureaucracy.
   Yeltsin rolled up more than 89 percent of the vote to defeat
technocrat Yevgeny Brakov for a seat representing all of Moscow in
Sunday's first multicandidate national balloting in 70 years of
Soviet power. Together with the defeats of high-ranking officials
in other areas of the country, it is a warning of popular
discontent with entrenched officials and their privileges.
   The victory restored the burly, 58-year-old Sverdlovsk native to
a place of prominence in Moscow, giving the onetime protege of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev a parliamentary seat representing
the city he used to run as Communist Party chief.
   But it is only one of 2,250 seats in a body that meets once a
year to elect a president and a new, more active legislative body:
the Supreme Soviet.
   Gorbachev has said he wants all members of the congress to serve
one year of their five-year terms in the Supreme Soviet, but there
is no guarantee when Yeltsin will be elected to the practically
full-time lawmaking body.
   Yeltsin has been on the outs politically since losing his job in
November 1987 following his blunt criticism of the party's style of
leadership and warnings of a Stalin-like cult developing around
Gorbachev.
   During his populist campaign against the privileges of the party
elite and the failure of Gorbachev's reforms to put food on the
tables of ordinary people, however, Yeltsin was careful not to
challenge Gorbachev's leadership. He repeated that disclaimer after
his victory.
   ``I didn't consider myself, I don't consider myself, and I don't
want to be an alternative candidate to Gorbachev,'' Yeltsin told
hundreds of workers Monday at the State Construction Committee,
where he serves as first deputy chairman.
   Accused in the Communist Party's Central Committee of advocating
a multiparty system, Yeltsin has denied the charge and said it was
an effort to undermine his campaign. But he gave a clue about how
he plans to push his program, saying deputies must form interest
groups if they expect to accomplish anything.
   ``It is impossible to carry out 2,250 programs, as many as there
are deputies,'' he said Monday. Yeltsin said he foresaw ``some
based on ecology, some on social issues, some on the economy. In
this way they can be formed to strengthen that trend, that voice.''
   ``And just the opposite, they can stand as a strong barrier
against those trends that people don't need, which hurt our people
and the government too,'' he said.
   Yeltsin ran hard in the Soviet Union's most visible electoral
district against what he said is an entrenched power structure that
enjoys special privileges while creating shortages for the masses
by mismanaging the economy.
   He said the leadership has failed to meet its top priority of
improving living conditions because reforms have not gone far
enough. Yeltsin campaigned for eliminating most government
ministries and cutting the Moscow bureaucracy to improve local
autonomy.
   His campaign was built on his popularity gained while serving as
Moscow Communist Party chief in 1985-87. It also served as a
lightning rod for discontent that is surfacing as Soviets are
increasingly allowed to voice their opinions.
   Yevgeniya Tonkonovye, 62, said Sunday that she voted for Yeltsin
because he visited the clinic where she worked and because he used
public transportation. ``You feel his earthiness,'' she said.
   Brakov, in contrast, came across less naturally and recited a
campaign program that closely followed mainstream Communist Party
calls for improved food and consumer goods.
   In his short term as Moscow party chief, Yeltsin was a close
supporter of Gorbachev, especially of his calls for greater
openness. But it was Gorbachev who criticized his one-time protege
for being overly ambitious and presided over the meeting at which
Yeltsin was fired.
   Yeltsin has criticized Gorbachev's electoral reforms as not
being democratic enough, and he chastised the party for nominating
100 candidates for an equal number of seats in the congress.
Gorbachev was among the 100.
   In contrast, three-quarters of the 1,500 congress members chosen
Sunday had competition.
   ``Democracy in society has gotten ahead of democracy in the
party, judging by the election law,'' Yeltsin said.
   But Yeltsin's popularity with a program that criticized
Communist Party policies could conceivably help Gorbachev, and the
Soviet leader appeared to acknowledge that in comments he made to
correspondents after voting Sunday.
   Asked about the charges made against Yeltsin in the final days
of the campaign, Gorbachev said the former Moscow party leader must
be willing to accept criticism along with everyone else in a freer
atmosphere.
   But he also said those who supported Yeltsin's attacks on
bureaucracy were ardent supporters of continuing reforms.
   Gorbachev might be able to use the strong showing by Yeltsin and
losses suffered by conservatives elsewhere to show the
conservatives still in the power structure thatay     *#*  *#*

   The astronauts who will fly the
first space shuttle planetary mission said Monday the Magellan
probe they are to launch toward Venus next month could teach us
about more than that hot planet.
   ``Not only will we learn much about Venus but we'll learn more
about Earth'' and why these neighboring planets evolved so
differently, said astronaut Norm Thagard.
   Astronaut Ronald Grabe, who will pilot the shuttle Atlantis,
noted that Magellan will be the first American planetary launch in
12 years and the first from the shuttle.
   ``The planetary program has been dormant for some time,'' he
said. ``So Magellan will be a very fullfilling flight for us. Not
only when we launch it, but 15 months later when it orbits Venus.''
   Astronaut David Walker, who will command the flight, said the
Magellan flight is a ``logical marriage between the manned and
unmanned space programs.''
   Walker and his four Atlantis crew members held a news conference
to discuss the four-day flight, scheduled for launch from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., on April 28.
   Six hours after Atlantis lifts off, astronauts Thagard and Mark
Lee are to release the Magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay. An
hour later, a payload rocket motor is to ignite to start the
8,000-pound probe on a 466-day voyage to Venus.
   Magellan is to reach Venus on Aug. 10, 1990, swooping into orbit
to begin 243 days of mapping the entire surface of the planet with
high-resolution radar.
   ``Venus is our closest neighbor in terms of space, mass and
size,'' Thagard said. ``Planetary science is very important to
learning how the Earth evolved and what is going on here. Venus is
another data point. We worry about the greenhouse effect here on
Earth. Magellan could tell us if there are any parallels between
Earth and Venus.''
   Although Earth and Venus were almost identical at the beginning
of the solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago, they evolved very
differently. Today, Venus has a surface temperature of 900 degrees
and is shrouded in a cloudy atmosphere.
   Mary Cleave, a mission specialist on next month's mission, said
Magellan's radar images could show whether Venus has shifting
crustal plates similar to those that sometimes cause earthquakes.
   ``Being a civil engineer and interested in the design of
buildings that could withstand earthquakes, I would like to know
more about plate tectonics,'' she said. ``Because there is no water
on Venus, the radar can look at the entire planet and this might
help us understand plate tectonics on Earth.''
   Magellan also could answer questions about the extent of
volcanic activity on Venus and whether the planet ever had oceans.

<HEAD>New York City Reins In Pit Bulls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city is getting tough on the pugnacious pit
bull dog, barring the breed from taking up future residence and
requiring photos and tattoos of those already here.
   The Board of Health adopted a Health Code amendment Monday that
requires that all pit bull terriers be registered, spayed or
neutered and identified by photographs and tattooing.
   The regulations, which go into effect in 30 days, also require
that the animals be muzzled whenever there is any potential contact
with the public, that they be on a leash when outside the owner's
home and that signs be posted on the premises indicating the
presence of a pit bull.
   The terriers, which were long ago bred to battle bulls for
sport, have been known to turn on humans without warning and bite
or maul them.
   Registration of all pit bulls with the city Department of Health
must take place before Oct. 1, and owners must have proof of
liability insurance of at least $100,000.
   Unregistered pit bulls can be seized and owners face fines of up
to $500 a day, said department spokesman Barry Adkins.
   ``After October first,'' he said, ``there will be no pit bulls
allowed into New York City. ... Eventually, there will come a time
when there will be no pit bulls in New York City.''
   Adkins said the only figures he had available on deaths from dog
attacks indicated that from 1983 to August 1987, there were 29
deaths nationally and 21 of those were caused by pit bulls.

<HEAD>Study Finds Crimes of Racism More Violent Than Thought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crimes motivated by bigotry are more violent than
previously assumed, according to a study released Monday by
Northeastern University.
   ``The idea that a civil rights violation consists of kids
painting graffiti on a church or throwing a rock through a window
does not describe the type of incidents reported to the Boston
police,'' Professor Jack McDevitt wrote in his study for the Center
for Applied Social Research at Northeastern University.
   ``More than 50 percent of the incidents of racial violence
identified in our study are acts of a very serious and potentially
injury-resulting character.''
   The study examined 452 crimes reported from 1983 to 1987 and
identified by the Boston Police Community Disorders Unit as
motivated by bigotry.
   The crimes included whites assaulting a white boyfriend of a
black female, bricks thrown through windows, a swastika painted on
a synagogue and assaults on homosexuals.
   Fifty-three percent of the crimes were categorized as physical
assaults, and 47 percent as property damage.
   Howard J. Ehrlich, research director of the National Institute
Against Prejudice and Violence, an independent organization in
Baltimore, called the Northeastern study ``the first really decent
analysis of hard data.'
   Such research reinforces findings of the Baltimore institute
that one out of four or five minority persons will be victimized
during the course of a year, he said.
   ``It's very underreported,'' McDevitt said. ``Victims fear
retaliation. And victims will deny it's a hate crime. If you feel
you're a victim because of your religion or your color, then each
time you step out the door (you fear) you're going to be attacked.''
   Among the findings:
   _Sixty-three percent of the racial incidents were perpetrated by
whites, 33 percent by blacks. Four percent of such offenses were
committed by people of Hispanic or Asian origin.
   _The largest percentage of victims _ 35 percent _ were white,
followed by blacks, 32 percent; Vietnamese, 12 percent, other
Asian, 11 percent; Hispanics, including Portuguese, 7 percent; and
Jews, 1 percent. Nearly one-third of the victims were female.
   _In 30 percent of the cases, victims were told they were being
attacked because they ``did not belong'' in a neighborhood.
   _64 percent of the racial attacks were committed by more than
one individual and most involved four or more people ganging up
against a lone victim.
   Ehrlich said it's estimated that up to 70 percent of such
crimes, including verbal assaults, are never reported. But he said
society can work to get rid of bigotry.
   ``Prejudice is learned. What confuses people is that, because
it's learned so early, they believe it's innate or natural.
Understanding that it's a learned attitude lets us understand that
we can change attitudes,'' Erhlich said.

   A gene and data bank for shrubs and other
woody landscape plants has been established at the National
Arboretum, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Arboretum director H. Marc Cathey said plant researchers and
nurseries will use the bank to find and obtain landscape specimens
at other arboretums and nurseries around the country _ as well as
in the National Arboretum.
   Cathey also said collections of plants at the 444-acre arboretum
will be expanded as part of a new national woody landscape plant
repository. A new computer bank will make it easier to develop new
and better specimens.
   The new repository is the first of its kind at the national
level, he said. The arboretum is operated by the department's
Agricultural Research Service.
   Cathey said public interest in gardening has expanded rapidly
since 1978, including an increase of almost a third in the sales of
landscape plants. Those sales were estimated at more than $7
billion last year.

<HEAD>Youngsters Throng White House Lawn for Egg Roll Without Commercials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, his wife, children and
grandchildren joined thousands of youngsters on the sunlit South
Lawn of the White House Monday for an Easter egg roll lacking much
of the commercialization of recent years.
   ``What we were trying to do was basically bring back good kid
entertainment and take some of the commercial out of it,'' said
Debbie Romash of the White House visitors center.
   Ms. Romash said White House security estimated nearly 40,000
children and parents came through the gates for this year's event,
about 5,000 more than last year.
   The Bushes were accompanied by two of their children, Neil and
Doro, and six grandchildren. Vice President Dan Quayle hid wooden
eggs in straw for younger children, and his wife, Marilyn, and
10-year-old daughter, Corinne, read stories.
   Nancy Sununu, wife of White House Chief of Staff John Sununu,
also joined the story readers.
   Actor Christopher Reeve and his two sons, Alexander and Matthew,
joined the first family at the egg roll, as did actors playing
Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf from the Broadway show ``Into
the Woods.''
   The president squatted down to explain to 2-year-old
granddaughter Ellie LeBlond how to use a plastic kitchen spoon to
roll a hard-boiled egg 20 or so feet down a lane drawn on the White
House lawn for the occasion.
   Then he blew a whistle to start the round.
   Egg-rolling is a technique that may have fallen into disuse
since 1878, when the children of Washington persuaded President
Rutherford B. Hayes to allow them to compete at the White House
after they had been banned from the grounds of the Capitol.
   The eggs are to stay rolling through the lush grass for the
distance, but some of the older children _ the top age allowed is 8
_ sailed their eggs across the finish line with one flick at the
whistle. Some of the littlest competitors needed help from a parent.
   No one seemed to be keeping track of who won the events, but it
didn't matter, because all the participants in the White House egg
rolls win a souvenir wooden egg. This year they bore the signatures
of the first couple.
   Bush talked with Reeve, bystanders and others, then blew the
whistle for a second race. At its conclusion, he headed back to the
White House, shaking hands along the way.
   ``Our goals this year were to, one, accentuate the family
because that is so much of the Bushes and, two, increase the
involvement of the kids in the basic activities that they come
for,'' Ms. Romash said.
   ``A Family Easter at the White House, 1989'' said the brochure
and sticker given each child upon arrival. Afterward, each was
given a single Easter Card with a story about the Easter Bunny, not
the bags of candy and other goodies of recent years.
   Gone were the actors dressed up as TV cartoon characters or
well-known brands of candy that were a feature of the event during
the years Ronald Reagan lived in the White House.
   Instead, clowns, some volunteers from the Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, made up the bulk of the costumed
entertainers who mingled with the little ones this year,
distributing helium-filled balloons of pink, yellow or white and
signing autographs.
   It was a day with much standing in line for most guests, an
average of two hours just to get in plus additional waits to
participate in the most popular events.

<HEAD>Hairless Calf Survives Winter With Flannel Shirts But Faces Sunburn
Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILLMAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare Holstein calf born without hair has
survived its first month by wearing flannel shirts and leg wraps,
but it now faces the risk of fatal sunburn as summer approaches.
   ``The local vet has been here a couple of times to look at him
and he said he's seen calves with two heads or five legs, but he's
never had to deal with one that doesn't have any hair,'' said
Virgil Hoheisel, the owner of Baldy.
   Except for a small patch of fur on its hind quarters and two
wispy tufts on its forehead, the Hillman farmer's cow is as bald as
a cue ball. It doesn't even have eyelashes.
   ``When it was born, he reminded me of one of those little baby
mice without any hair,'' said Hoheisel's wife, Mary Lou.
   Raising a hairless calf has posed some unusual problems. Baldy
eats considerably more than most calves his age, yet he stays
surprisingly svelte. Almost all of his food energy is consumed in
keeping warm and not much is left for growing, the Hoheisels said.
   To warm Baldy, the owners have outfitted him in old flannel
shirts. And because he bruises and cuts easily, Mrs. Hoheisel has
fitted him with leg wraps.
   Francis Spurrell, a doctor who specializes in animal
reproduction, or theriogenology, at the University of Minnesota's
College of Veterinary Medicine, said Baldy likely is showing signs
of hypotrichosis-congenita, an extremely rare genetic mutation.
   ``Most calves like this die shortly after birth, so a calf
living even this long is highly unusual,'' Spurrell said.
   Baldy's long-term prognosis will not improve much as summer
approaches, Spurrell said. The animal's weight may increase, but
because of the lack of hair, the calf will be highly susceptible to
severe sunburn and accompanying infection. Spurrell said he doubts
that Baldy could gradually adapt to longer exposure to the sun the
way people do _ by becoming tan.
   ``As long as he's healthy and not suffering, we're in no rush to
get rid of him,'' Hoheisel said. ``Being as rare as he is, he's
kind of nice to have around.''

<HEAD>Britain's Thatcher Suggests Israel Talk to Opponents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain said Monday that the need to resolve the Middle East crisis
has never been more urgent and suggested that Israel consider
talking to its opponents.
   She addressed a banquet given by Morrocan King Hassan II at the
start of an African tour that also will take her to Nigeria,
Zimbabwe and Malawi.
   Mrs. Thatcher noted Hassan's 1986 meeting with then-Israeli
Premier Shimon Peres, which drew fire from some other Arab nations.
   ``Nothing is ever lost by exploring the views of one's
opponents,'' she said. ``That is an example from which Israel can
learn.''
   The remark appeared to be another suggestion that Israel meet
with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said on a
visit to Israel last month that Israeli leaders should accept the
PLO as a negotiating partner. Waldegrave met in January with PLO
chief Yasser Arafat.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization despite
Arafat's renunciation of terrorism in December and his recognition
of Israel's right to exist, a move that opened the way for the
U.S.-PLO dialogue now in progress.
   ``Never has the need for a solution (to the Arab-Israeli
conflict) been more urgent,'' Mrs. Thatcher told the royal banquet.
``The proliferation of weapons, including chemical weapons and the
ballistic missiles to deliver them, brings home to us the horrors
of a further conflict.
   ``No one should be in doubt that the present situation in the
Middle East is fundamentally unstable and cannot continue.''
   She said an international conference would provide the ``right''
framework for negotiations.
   Successful negotiations must include ``the direct involvement of
representatives of the Palestinian people from inside and outside
the occupied territories,'' she said, as well as U.S. influence
with Israel and support of the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France
comprise the five permanent members.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she would like to see Britain and Morocco
make a cooperative effort to bring the Israelis and Palestinians
together.
   Her talks with Hassan were to focus on the Mideast,
British-Moroccan ties and Moroccan relations with the European
Economic Community.
   In an interview with the official Moroccan news agency MAP, Mrs.
Thatcher expressed her assent with Morocco's wish for strengthened
economic ties with the EEC. Morocco has vainly sought entry into
the trading bloc.
   Greeted at the rain-drenched airport by Premier Azzedine Laraki,
Mrs. Thatcher was ceremonially offered a bowl of milk and dates
upon her arrival Monday before attending a luncheon given by
Hassan's wife and three daughters.
   The British prime minister's aides said before her departure
that she would launch a southern African peace initiative during
her one-week trip.
   She said in a radio interview broadcast on Saturday, however,
that she could not go to South Africa until Nelson Mandela, jailed
leader of the African National Congress, is released.

<TEXT>
   A massive mudslide closed the main road
to Cedar Breaks National Monument and stripped off a half-mile
section of pavement, and it continued to ooze downhill Monday,
authorities said.
   The slide, roughly half a mile long and half a mile wide, sent
mud and boulders cascading across State Road 14 sometime during the
night and was discovered Monday morning, said Utah Department of
Transportation spokesman Kim Morris.
   No injuries were reported. The highway had been heavily traveled
during the Easter weekend, the Utah Highway Patrol said.
   No one was stranded at the monument because other roads lead
from the monument back to main roads.
   The slide pushed an unoccupied road grader off the road. Morris
said it also blocked a section of Coal Creek, which runs through
the canyon eight miles east of Cedar City, but no serious flooding
was reported.
   The slide continued to move but did not appear to be a threat.
The movement was ``barely perceptible to the eye,'' said Jeff
Tippetts, communications supervisor for the Utah Highway Patrol
office in Cedar City.
   State road crews expected to open a detour around the slide area
Tuesday after plowing snow from two sections of rural roads that
been closed through the winter, Morris said.
   The area received heavy rain and snow during the weekend, said
meteorologist Bill Alder at the National Weather Service in Salt
Lake City.
   It wasn't immediately known if the precipitation triggered the
slide, but Alder said ``that's probably what loosened the soil.''
   A weather gauge at nearby Navajo Lake reported 10 inches of
snow, while Zion National Park, 15 miles to the south, reported
0.54 of an inch of rain, Alder said.
   Cedar Breaks is a natural amphitheater a half-mile deep and two
miles wide, with cliffs eroded into pinnacles and ridges in a
variety of colors. It was named by Mormon pioneers, who called its
rugged topography ``breaks'' and mistook its juniper trees for
cedars.

   Boris N. Yeltsin and other anti-establishment
candidates rode a wave of popular discontent to victory in
parliamentary elections that gave Soviet voters their first real
choice, according to returns Monday.
   Communist Party chiefs in the nation's second- and third-largest
cities were defeated in Sunday's voting, and a top member of the
Soviet leadership apparently was rejected in his home district
where he ran unopposed.
   Results trickling in from across the country indicated Soviets
took advantage of new electoral freedom to express their
dissatisfaction with shortages of food and consumer goods, rising
prices, the bureaucracy and officials who promise reform.
   The winners will join those picked earlier by the Communist
Party and other organizations in a new 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies. The parliament is still certain to be dominated
by the ruling party and an entrenched Kremlin leadership that
assured itself of seats without having to face opposition at the
polls.
   Yeltsin, the burly, 58-year-old former Moscow party boss, won a
landslide victory after a populist campaign against the special
privileges afforded the party elite at a time when most people can
find practically nothing in their stores.
   The one-time Gorbachev protege amassed 89.4 percent of the vote
against Yevgeny Brakov, a factory director, in a race for a seat to
represent all of Moscow, according to Igor N. Orlov, chairman of
Moscow's election commission.
   Brakov, 51, who also campaigned for improvements in the food
supply but whose factory makes the ZIL limousines that symbolize
privilege, received just 6.9 percent of the vote, Orlov said.
   Yeltsin's win marked a stunning political comeback following his
dramatic fall from grace in 1987, when he was ousted as Moscow
party chief and later fired as a non-voting member of the ruling
Politburo. He was accused of political mistakes and personal
ambition after he criticized his fellow leaders and complained that
perestroika, Gorbachev's reform program, had not fulfilled the
people's needs.
   ``It's hard to say what my spirit is more full of, joy or
concern about what I realistically can do to help Muscovites,''
Yeltsin told hundreds of workers at the State Construction
Committee, where he still holds ministerial rank despite his ouster
from the party's top ranks. The workers applauded warmly.
   But Yeltsin's victory carries little power. The congress to
which he was elected will meet just once a year to elect a
president and a fraction of its own membership to a full-time
legislature, the Supreme Soviet. Gorbachev has said he wants all
members of the congress to serve one year of their five-year terms
in the Supreme Soviet, but there is no guarantee when Yeltsin will
move up to the lawmaking body.
   The congress will be made up of 1,500 deputies elected in
Sunday's territorial balloting and 750 members chosen earlier by
various party, social and professional organizations.
   Elsewhere, other longtime office holders who traditionally won
in uncontested elections went down to defeat.
   Leningrad Communist Party chief Anatoly Gerasimov lost
overwhelmingly to a shipbuilder who took 74 percent of the vote in
the nation's second-largest city, Tass said.
   In an apparent defeat for a Politburo member, the name of
Leningrad regional party chief Yuri F. Solovyov was omitted from a
Tass list of victorious parliamentary candidates, local journalists
said. Solovyov, one of eight non-voting members of the 20-man
Politburo, had no opponent in the parliamentary race, but voters
had the choice of voting against any candidate by crossing out the
name on the ballot.
   Another loser was Konstantin Masik, regional party chief in
Kiev, the Soviet Union's third-largest city and capital of the
Ukraine, Tass said. Party leaders in four other areas of the
Ukraine also lost, Tass said.
   In the Baltic republics, candidates from grassroots movements
that have tapped popular dissatisfaction with Moscow's control over
their economies, cultures and politics generally fared well in the
election.
   In Estonia, Edgar Savisaar, a founder of the People's Front, won
more than 80 percent of the vote in defeating a local Communist
party chief. Another Estonian People's Front leader, Marju
Lauristen, also received more than 80 percent to defeat the editor
of a Russian-language newspaper.
   Lithuania's president, Vitautas Astrauskas, and its premier,
Vitautas Sakalauskas, were defeated. Sajudis, the Lithuanian
grassroots movement, claimed all 39 of its candidates either won or
advanced to run-off elections.
   Latvia's premier, Vilnis Bresis, was defeated by a popular
television reporter, and the republic's party chief, Janis Vagris,
was elected a deputy by a only small margin after a ``complicated
pre-election battle,'' Tass said.
   In other Moscow races:
   _ Reform-minded economist Oleg T. Bogomolov defeated a factory
worker and a regional party official.
   _ Roy A. Medvedev, a historian ousted from the party for
writings that went against the official grain before Gorbachev came
to power, faces a runoff against a woman who runs an atomic energy
laboratory.
   _ Ilya I. Zaslavsky, a young activist who campaigned for rights
for the handicapped, beat a TV commentator in a race in Gorbachev's
home district in Moscow.
   Of 26 territorial election district races in Moscow, runoffs are
planned in eight districts where no candidate won a majority of the
votes, Tass said. Election officials said the runoffs would be held
April 9.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
praised the Soviet elections as a ``move in the right direction.''
She said that although the elections ``were neither free nor
democratic by Western standards,'' they do represent a change from
past practices.
   Nationwide figures on turnout were not available, but Orlov said
83.5 percent of Moscow's 6.9 million eligible voters took part.
That represents a drop from the 99.9 percent turnout usually
reported in Soviet elections in which volunteers go into
neighborhoods to force people to vote.
   Yeltsin had expressed fears that ruling party officials would
steal the election after the polls closed by stuffing ballot boxes
or throwing out opposition votes, but no complaints of fraud
surfaced Monday.

   An aerospace company employee who received a
transplanted kidney was recuperating well Monday, thankful that he
was rushed by helicopter from a remote desert camp in time for the
surgery.
   Charles Ridgeway, 47, ``is doing great. He's awake, alert and
reading the newspaper,'' his son, 23-year-old Matt Ridgeway, said
by phone from Western Medical Center in Santa Ana. ``He's pretty
happy about the new kidney. We're all happy.''
   The elder Ridgeway was upgraded from critical to serious
condition, and showed no sign of rejecting his new kidney, hospital
spokeswoman Rose Ayala said. Matt said his father expected to be
discharged within two weeks.
   He underwent transplant surgery Sunday after an urgent ground
and air search to find him once the donor kidney became available
on Saturday. He was some 200 miles from the hospital when he was
found.
   Ridgeway, his wife, Betty, and 25-year-old daughter, Robin, were
camping in a remote Imperial County area near the U.S.-Mexico
border, when they finally were located early Sunday by Matt
Ridgeway and Los Angeles-based KNX-AM news radio helicopter pilot
Bob Tur.
   ``He's very thankful, especially to Bob Tur and his
helicopter,'' Matt said.
   Charles Ridgeway, an accounting manager at Rockwell
International in Anaheim, wore a paging device so hospital
officials could locate him, but he was well out of its range.
   Because Ridgeway's blood type is shared by only 15 percent of
the population, ``doctors said it could be years before a kidney
became available,'' the son said. ``It was just a fluke one with
the right blood type became available so quickly.''
   Matt drove 100 mph to the Imperial Valley, while
search-and-rescue crews also looked and Tur flew through driving
rain in his search. They initially were unable to find the elder
Ridgeway among Easter weekend crowds of campers.
   It was like looking for ``a needle in a sand dune,'' Tur said.
   ``It was a pretty close call, mainly because the helicopter was
running out of fuel,'' the younger Ridgeway said. ``They (Tur and
others with him) had 10 minutes left before they would have had to
turn around and go back.''
   Ridgeway required the transplant because he suffered polycystic
kidney failure, in which cysts form in the kidney and prevent its
proper functioning, Ayala said. The condition is genetic, Matt
Ridgeway said.
   He said the donated kidney came from a local teen-age girl.
Ayala said she had no details on the donor.

<HEAD>Sources: Iran Plans To Releas Yacht Seized By Guards</HEAD>

   Iran planned to release a yacht that was
seized by Iran's Revolutionary Guards with four Britons and members
of the Kuwaiti royal family on board, sources said Monday.
   Details of the incident remained sketchy in the face of
government denials, and sources could not confirm whether the yacht
and its passengers were still in Iranian hands.
   But Iranian diplomats in the southern gulf port of Dubai were
discreetly spreading word that the yacht would not be held, said a
diplomatic source in Dubai who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier reports said the ship was seized Thursday near the
Revolutionary Guard stronghold of Farsi Island, with five members
of Kuwait's ruling Sabah family and four young British women on
board. One report said they were airline stewardesses. There was no
confirmation Monday of who was on board.
   ``This seems to be nothing more than the usual practice of the
Iranian Revolutionary Guards,'' said a Kuwait-based diplomat,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There does not appear to be
anything political behind this incident, it just seems to be an
exercise in piracy.''
   The guards, using speedboats with guns mounted on board, roamed
the gulf shipping lanes and attacked vessels during the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war, which was halted in August by a cease-fire.
   ``A ranking Iranian diplomat has confirmed that the yacht was
seized when it strayed in Iranian waters,'' said the diplomatic
source in Dubai. He also said the Iranian confirmed an imminent
release.
   The sources said Iran did not want to jeopardize the friendly
ties it has been developing with Kuwait since the cease-fire, and
that the affair would end quietly. Iran has not commented publicly
on the reports.
   The diplomats said the occupants of the yacht may have been
released by Monday, but that sandstorms and rough seas were keeping
the ship in Iranian waters.
   Kuwait's government apparently leaked the story to the respected
daily newspaper Al-Anbaa to pressure Iran for a release. The
newspaper first reported details of the seizure on Sunday.
   The governments of Kuwait, Bahrain and Britain denied all
reports involving the incident.
   The diplomats speculated that the identity of the passengers
would never be released, especially if members of the royal family
were involved. The 82-foot yacht's name, the Falaika, is the same
as a resort island off Kuwait and indicated that it came from the
wealthy emirate.
   If Britons were on board, they might not have been missed
because they did not bother to register with the local embassy, the
diplomats said.
   ``By the time everything has firmed up, it will probably be
referred to as a case of a small motorboat getting lost and
released, with no one of significance aboard,'' said one source.

<TEXT>
   The government sent army troops to
northeastern Uganda against marauding cattle rustlers who chased
13,000 people from their homes, Radio Uganda reported Monday.
   Maj. Gen. Elly Tumwine was quoted as saying army units would be
left permanently in besieged Usuk county, 180 miles northeast of
Kampala. The troops were to fight the heavily armed rustlers who
are Karamajong tribesmen, according to the broadcast.
   He did not say how many troops were deployed.
   The rustlers moved into Usuk county three weeks ago after
government troops were withdrawn from the area. They since have
tortured and killed villagers, burned their huts, and stolen cattle
and other property, the radio said.
   An estimated 13,000 Usuk villagers fled the raiders to nearby
Soroti, where they are living in makeshift camps, the radio said.
   The Karamajong are cattle rustlers who raided military barracks
after the fall of dictators Idi Amin in 1979 and Milton Obote in
1985. They stole machine guns to boost their traditional arsenal of
spears and arrows.

   Japan last year turned away or deported 17,854
foreigners for carrying fake passports or working illegally,
according to a Justice Ministry report Monday.
   For the first time in 10 years, the number of males deported for
violating immigration law exceeded that of females and was 90
percent higher than in 1987, the report said. The number of women
deported fell by 16 percent, the report said.
   Of the total, more than 16,000 foreigners overstayed visas and
14,300 of these were employed without proper working papers, the
report said.
   The remaining foreigners were turned away at borders with fake
papers, the report said.
   The largest national group deported was from the Philippines,
followed by illegal workers from Bangladesh, Pakistan and South
Korea, the report said.
   In the last three years, people from developing Asian nations
have flocked to Japan, where they usually find illegal work on
construction sites, in restaurants or in small factories, a Justice
Ministry official said. They earn far more than they would in their
own countries, the official said.

   The body of a woman who may have been

the home of a daughter, police said.
   The woman, identified as Clara Peters Whiting, would be 80 if

play was not suspected.
   A son, identified as Charles Whiting of Melrose, who had been

said Darnell.
   The daughter, Myra Joyce Vickers, did not tell authorities why
she had left her mother's body in the home, but said she died about
two years ago, Darnell said.
   ``She really didn't know what to do,'' Darnell said, adding that
the daughter is now being cared for by family members.
   Darnell said police have not decided whether to file charges
against Ms. Vickers for not reporting the death.

<HEAD>Detainee Halts Hunger Strike After 38 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A detained black activist ended a
38-day hunger strike Monday, drinking milk and eating two slices of
toast to end the longest of a wave of fasts protesting detention
without trial.
   Sandile Thusi said he would consider resuming the hunger strike
if Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok refused to free him.
   ``I'm just giving Mr. Vlok a chance, a few days so he can think
about my release,'' Thusi, 26, said from his bed at St. Aidan's
Hospital in Durban, where he was visited by his mother, aunt and
sister-in-law.
   Thusi lost about 57 pounds, one-third of his normal weight, in
the hunger strike, and doctors had said he risked brain damage and
blindness if he did not resume eating immediately. He was fasting
to protest his nine-month detention without trial.
   The Law and Order Ministry said last week that Thusi's release
would not be considered while he continued his fast. There has been
no response from the ministry to his decision to resume eating.
   Thusi said he would suspend the fast after a meeting Saturday
with the Rev. Frank Chikane, a prominent anti-apartheid leader.
   Chikane also spoke Saturday to Vlok about Thusi, who has staged
the longest fast of the estimated 600 detainees participating in
hunger strikes since January to demand their freedom.
   Thusi, a university researcheundations and
contributions from 100,000 members, has 40 staff lawyers.
   ``I guess we would have more than effective legal counsel in any
litigation,'' said Meyerhoff, who is a lawyer.
   ``Unless there was some showing of bad faith or malice here on
our part, the law is clear that a lawsuit like that could be
successfully defended,'' he said, adding such a lawsuit could be
considered frivolous by the courts.
   The NRDC report on pesticide residues in childrens' food was
released in late February, and concluded that eating apples treated
with the growth regulator Alar increased cancer risk in children.
   The report has been widely disputed, and the federal government
has said apples are safe to eat. The industry has accused the NRDC
of unfairness because only 5 percent of the crop is treated with
Alar. Alar is the trade name for daminozide, and is still legal to
use.
   Nevertheless, the report caused an uproar, prompting some school
districts to temporarily ban apples, hurting exports and retail
sales.
   The exact economic impact has not yet been measured, but prices
for the top grade of red apples have dropped about $2 per box in
recent weeks, and apple shipments from Washington dropped by over
300,000 boxes in the past two weeks.
   Warehouses in Washington, which produces half the nation's
supermarket apples, still have 17.7 million boxes of red apples
from the fall harvest in storage.
   Multiplying that by $2 per 42-pound box produces an economic
loss of $35.4 million for the rest of the season, even if prices
drop no further.
   ``The basic problem in the industry now is they've (NRDC)
smeared the red apple so bad on the Alar thing that it's rolling
over into the non-Alar-treated fruit,'' McPherson said.
   ``Everytime a housewife sees red apples she could be seeing red
herself,'' he said. ``I don't know how you can measure that.''

<HEAD>Agency Says Imports Being Sold in U.S. at Less than Fair Value</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said Monday it had
made a final determination that imports of anti-friction bearings
from nine countries are being sold in the United States at less
than fair value.
   The department's ruling covered imports from West Germany,
France, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand and the
United Kingdom. The agency also ruled that bearings from Singapore
and Thailand were being subsidized.
   As a result of earlier preliminary rulings in the case, cash
deposits or bonds are being imposed on imports from the nine
countries to offset the price advantages and subsidies.
   If the U.S. International Trade Commission makes a final ruling
that the low-priced imports harm U.S. industry, the Commerce
Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect the final
anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
   The department began its investigation after the Torrington Co.
in Torrington, Conn., filed a petition last March on behalf of the
U.S. bearing industry, alleging that massive dumping by the foreign
countries was damaging the domestic bearing industry. Torrington is
the nation's largest producer of a range of bearings.
   David Gridley, the company's industry marketing manager, said
several studies had found that a ``substantial number of bearing
factories closed and workers were laid off while at the same time
imports from these foreign countries have been increasing.''
   Gridley said the company was very pleased with the ruling and
with the department's in-depth inquiry. The petition resulted in 34
anti-dumping and 10 countervailing duty investigations covering
several kinds of bearings.
   The department said the investigations were the most technical
and complex in several years, and covered more than 25 foreign
companies.
   Imports of anti-friction bearings from the nine countries were
estimated at about $650 million in 1988. Anti-friction bearings are
used in the aircraft, automotive, machinery and electronics
industries.

<TEXT>
   A political group seeking greater
autonomy from the Soviet Union defeated government leaders in
elections in Lithuania, and similar organizations made strong
showings in Latvia and Estonia.
   Voters in the three Baltic republics used Sunday's balloting _
the first multiple-candidate elections in the Soviet Union in 70
years _ to express support for reform.
   The official Tass news agency said that in Lithuania, President
Vitautus Astrauskas and Premier Vitautus Sokolauskas were defeated
by candidates supported by Sajudis, the Lithuanian Restructuring
Movement.
   Sajudis claimed it won or forced runoff elections in all 39
districts it contested. Sajudis leaders saw the voting for
positions in the new Soviet parliament, the Congress of People's
Deputies, as a referendum on its call for more sovereignty.
   The organization did not run candidates against Algirdas
Brazauskas, the leader of Lithuania's Communist Party, or his
deputy, Vladimiras Beriozovas. Sajudis regards them as reformers.
   Virgilijus Chapaitis, a Sajudis leader, said of the vote: ``In
principle it means the public backs independence. It means we want
to say what will happen in Lithuania.''
   Some Sajudis supporters want an independent Lithuania, but the
organization has stopped short of calling for secession. ``Any
question of secession is for the future'' while the republic works
toward creating democratic institutions, Chapaitis said in an
interview.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``need not fear this
election,'' he added.
   Chapaitis noted that many Sajudis members also are members of
the Communist Party. ``Its not a victory against the (Communist)
party. It's a victory of the progressives,'' he said.
   In Latvia, Janis Vagris, head of the Latvian Communist Party,
won in a multicandidate struggle that included Yuris Dobelis, a
founder of the Latvian independence movement, Tass said.
   Dobelis said he hoped to get enough votes to force a run-off. He
said Vagris had taken advantage of heavy exposure on state-run
television in the week before the elections.
   In Estonia, Popular Front candidates ran well.
   Edgar Savisaar, a People's Front leader, took more than 80
percent of the vote to defeat Allik Jaak, a Communist Party chief
in the city of Viljandi.
   Marju Lauristen, another People's Front candidate, also won with
more than 80 percent of the vote in her race against Walter Toots,
the editor of a Russian-language newspaper in the university town
of Tartu, said officials of the Estonian Foreign Ministry.
   Rein Vederman, the No. 2 official in the Estonian Communist
Party, faces a runoff against Yevgeny Kogan, the leader of
Interfront, a political group that promotes the interests of
non-Estonians living in the republic.

   Christian army gunners exchanged
artillery fire with Druse militiamen and Syrian soldiers Monday in
a battle that began nearly three weeks ago and has killed or
wounded hundreds of civilians.
   An Arab League mediation committee appealed for a cease-fire.
   Police reported sporadic rocket and howitzer barrages during the
day and said the fire intensified just before sundown. They said
the Syrians and Druse launched hundreds of rockets into into
residential districts of Christian east Beirut and the Christian
enclave north and east of the capital.
   Dozens of rockets were directed at the Defense Ministry in
suburban Yarze, headquarters of Gen. Michel Aoun, who commands the
20,000 Christians of the Lebanese army, and the presidential palace
in nearby Baabda, where Aoun lives.
   His gunners used 155mm howitzers to shell Syrian and Druse
positions in the mountains overlooking Beirut, police said.
   They reported two civilians were killed and seven wounded in
east Beirut, and four wounded in Druse-controlled villages
southeast of Beirut, but they had no word on casualties among
combatants. The toll since fighting began March 8 stood at 99 dead
and 350 wounded by police count.
   The worst sectarian fighting since 1985 in Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war began two days after Aoun's men blockaded illegal ports
run by Moslem militias, which deprive the five government ports of
an estimated $100 million a year in taxes.
   A political crisis that arose in September has created Christian
and Moslem governments and divided the army on sectarian lines.
Premier Salim Hoss leads the Moslem cabinet and Maj. Gen. Sami
Khatib commands the 22,000 Moslem soldiers.
   Citizens on both sides of the sectarian line that divides
Beirut, who have been living in bomb shelters, took advantage of
the comparative daytime lull to replenish food and other
necessities.
   ``It seems our hibernation ... is going to last for a long
time,'' said George Khoury, a Christian from the Mansourieh
district. ``I have bought some mattresses because we cannot go on
sleeping on the hard floor, some games for the children and
tranquilizers for our fraying nerves.''
   Random shelling overnight sometimes reached 60 rounds a minute
and the main power plant was set ablaze. Electricity was rationed
to four hours Monday.
   Arab League mediators sent appeals for a truce from league
headquarters in Tunis to President Hafez Assad of Syria and the
Lebanese belligerents, Beirut radio stations reported.
   Assad keeps 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League and has become the country's main
power broker during the long civil war.
   Sheik Sabah Ahmed Sabah, Kuwait's foreign minister, leads the
six-member committee. The mediators, appointed in January,
scheduled meetings in the Tunisian capital with two former
presidents of Lebanon and four of its former premiers.
   Hoss told a news conference Monday he had sent a new note to the
league blaming the fighting on Aoun's ``lust for power.'' Aoun has
made no secret of his hopes to become president.
   President Amin Gemayel named Aoun to lead an interim government
Sept. 22, when Parliament could not agree on a successor at the end
of Gemayel's six-year term. Moslems supported by Syria swore
allegiance to Hoss, the incumbent Sunni Moslem premier, and two
governments resulted.
   Under an unwritten agreement dating to independence from France
in 1943, the president is a Christian, the premier a Sunni and the
parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   Aoun says the Syrians have become an occupation force by taking
sides, and has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out.
   Hoss contends the Syrian military presence is legitimate.
   ``The Syrian army entered Lebanon in 1976 at the request of the
... Lebanese government,'' he told reporters. ``This request was
later endorsed by the Arab League, of which Lebanon is a founding
member.''
   Any demand for Syrian withdrawal should come from a united
government, ``which is not present at the moment,'' he said, and
accused Aoun of ``pushing Lebanon to the brink of ... disaster.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will propose
elections in the occupied lands as a step toward beginning peace
talks with Palestinians while avoiding direct contact with the PLO,
a senior official said Monday.
   Shamir, who is bringing his peace plan to Washington next week,
is being pressed by the United States, European countries and
opponents in his own government to find a way to end the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Also Monday, an Israeli policeman caught alone in a West Bank
village opened fire Monday on young Arabs who pelted him with
stones, killing a 4-year-old boy, the army reported.
   Arab hospital officials said Amjad Ahmed Hassan died of a chest
wound. The death toll since the uprising began in the occupied
territories more than 15 months ago now stands at 412 Palestinians
and 18 Israelis.
   A military spokesman said the policeman who came under
stone-throwing attack in Beit Kad, a remote West Bank village, and
``was forced to use his weapon.'' He did not say why the policeman
was there.
   Israeli policemen are assigned to the occupied territories only
for investigative duties and the army handles patrols. The military
command said police and the army were investigating the shooting.
   The senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Shamir's plan calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
occupied lands to choose local leaders in the next few months who
can negotiate an interim peace agreement.
   But Shamir said his proposal would not lead to an independent
Palestinian state.
   ``In the Land of Israel there can be just one country, the state
of Israel,'' Shamir said Monday at a gathering of senior members of
his right-wing Likud bloc in Tel Aviv.
   ``In the coming days, I'm going on a mission for the country.
I'm confident because I know the majority of the country is behind
me,'' Shamir said of his trip to the United States.
   The official said Shamir's vision of the temporary settlement
resembles the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy outlined in
the U.S.-sponsored Camp David accords that led to the 1979 peace
treaty with Egypt.
   ``The main idea is elections as part of an interim settlement,
but the type and extent of the elections _ whether they would be
mayors or local leaders or representatives _ will be left open to
negotiation,'' the official said.
   Other reports have said Shamir might propose administering the
West Bank and Gaza with neighboring Jordan as part of a
confederation. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who proposed several months ago
that elections be held, told high school pupils near Tel Aviv on
Monday his center-left Labor Party and Shamir's conservative Likud
bloc must cooperate on a peace plan.
   ``We can of course gore each other, the two main blocs ... but
let's put aside differences and seek the area where we can move the
peace process forward in a joint, cooperative way among us,'' he
said.
   Labor, led by Finance Minister Shimon Peres, and Likud formed a
``national unity'' coalition after indecisive elections in November.
   Shamir refuses contact with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which he says is a terrorist group, and objected when
the United States opened contacts after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat
renounced terrorism in December.
   Holding elections, which Shamir initially rejected, is seen here
as a compromise.
   ``I am convinced that in any peace agreement both sides have to
overcome many obstacles and also make concessions,'' Shamir said
Sunday on Israel television Sunday.
   According to the senior official, the Bush administration is
trying to persuade the PLO to accept the proposal for Palestinians
not officially linked to it to open talks with Israel, but the PLO
insists on entering the talks later.
   He said Shamir's government rejects that condition as well as
demands that Israel accept the principle of trading land for peace.
   Meanwhile, leaders of the rebellion urged Palestinians to
intensify it with ``knives, axes, firebombs and large rocks.''
   In leaflet No. 37, issued Monday, the Unified National
Leadership of the Uprising also demanded that Palestinians boycott
meetings with Israeli officials to frustrate Shamir's effort to
find non-PLO partners for peace talks.
   A general strike Monday virtually shut the territories down.
Arab reports said 11 Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in six
stone-throwing encounters with Israeli troops.
   Soldiers confined more than 260,000 Gaza residents to their
homes with curfews on eight towns and refugee camps.

   President Bush will name a veteran national
security official to an arms control post that became a focus of
controversy in the Reagan administration, the White House announced
Monday.
   The announcement said Bush plans to nominate Ronald Frank Lehman
II to be director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
succeeding William F. Burns.
   The arms control agency has usually been noncontroversial, but
became a storm center when Reagan nominated Kenneth Adelman as its
director after he took office in 1981.
   Adelman was confirmed after lengthy confirmation hearings in
which his qualifications were questioned and his conservative views
brought sharp criticism from liberals on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   Lehman is currently serving as assistant secretary of defense
for international security policy. He has also been chief U.S.
negotiator in U.S.-Soviet talks on strategic nuclear arms.
   Before undertaking these duties, he was deputy assistant to the
president for national security affairs and senior director for
defense programs on the National Security Council staff. He has
been a senior advisor to the United Nations Special Session on
Disarmament.

   Randall Dale Adams, jailed for more than
12 years for a murder he says he didn't commit and freed partly
because of the movie ``Thin Blue Line,'' said Monday he hopes to
build a future by speaking about his ordeal.
   ``This is a case and a story that must be held before the
public,'' Randall Dale Adams said in an inteview at his mother's
home. ``I want to get some speaking engagements, talk to people,
law schools, places where lawyers and judges are trained. They must
know my story.
   ``If I can support myself and do that, I want to take that
avenue. But failing that, I'll get a job. In that case, Randall
Adams could just filter into the mists of time.''
   In the meantime, Adams, a quiet, introspective man with a dry
wit, is enjoying his newfound freedom and trying to find some
private time.
   Adams, 40, was freed last week from a Texas prison he had
inhabited since being convicted in 1977 for the murder of a Dallas
policeman. He was sentenced to die.
   He was released Tuesday after the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals reversed the conviction. On Thursday, prosecutors announced
they would not seek to retry him.
   Adams' story was chronicled in filmmaker Errol Morris'
documentary ``Thin Blue Line,'' which questioned evidence and
prompted Texas officials to re-examine the case.
   Adams spent Thursday night with his mother, Mildred, who sold
her house in suburban Grove City to help pay her son's legal bills.
After taking a short drive Friday around Columbus, which has
doubled in size since he last saw it, he spent the rest of the day
with his family in Grove City.
   He spent most of Saturday and part of Easter Sunday shopping for
clothes and other necessities. On Sunday morning, Adams attended an
Easter church service.
   ``Randy took a flower out of his lapel and gave it to the
pastor,'' said Mrs. Adams. Then the whole church clapped. That
whole church was just so glad to see that boy.''
   He tried to rent a videotape of ``Thin Blue Line,'' but was told
it was not in stock.
   ``The guy there said I shouldn't rent it because all they do in
it is talk,'' he said, smiling.
   Adams had other errands to run Monday, including applying for a
driver's license and a Social Security number. He also went to rent
a post office box to accommodate the stream of letters and gifts
for him.
   ``I've been given just about everything you can think of, an
Easter bunny, flowers, this watch,'' he said.
   But Adams was calm in the face of the publicity storm his
release created. He said the family has agreed to put its private
homecoming on hold for now.
   ``We're trying to snatch as much private time as possible. My
family understands,'' he said, adding that his mother has become
almost as much a celebrity as he has. ``I'm afraid I'm going to
have to get her an agent.''
   He said he tries not to think about the time he spent in prison,
which he said ``is as bad and worse than any movie you've ever
seen. I carry the scars.''
   His face filled with pain and he spoke slowly when he recalled
his brush with death in 1980. Three days before his execution date,
a stay was issued.
   ``A judge calls you in and tells you you have 30 days, then you
return to your cell and you have 29 days, and then you have 20 days
and then you have 10 days ... and you know next week, you may have
nothing,'' he said. ``You make peace with yourself.
   ``You must know the man that is inside you. I liked the man I
saw there. But I wonder if I could have been man enough to ... walk
to my death as a man.''

   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia arrived Monday for
meetings with President Hosni Mubarak in the quest by moderate Arab
governments and the PLO for a common position on Middle East peace.
   Mubarak is scheduled to meet with President Bush in Washington
next Monday. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will confer with Bush
three days later, and King Hussein is to visit Washington on May 2.
   Hussein and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, conferred with Mubarak on Saturday to coordinate
strategy in seeking an energetic U.S. role in Middle East peace
efforts.
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Monday he told a group
of visiting U.S. senators: ``It is vital that the United States
play its role in helping to achieve permanent and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East. President Mubarak's U.S. visit is aimed
at pushing the peace effort forward.''
   Mubarak, Hussein, Fahd and Arafat favor an international
conference on Middle East peace, which Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of Israel has opposed. It would include the parties involved
and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: the
United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
   Egyptian officials said privately that Mubarak and the others
believe the United States can convince Israel to reverse its
position on such a forum and its refusal to deal with the PLO and
hope the conference can begin this year.
   Saudi Arabia is considered a key because of its political
influence in the Arab world, friendship with the United States,
financial aid to the PLO and poorer Arab states, and position as
custodian of Islam's holiest shrines.
   The 10th anniversary the U.S.-mediated peace treaty between
Egypt and Israel occurred Sunday. No other Arab country has made
peace with the Jewish state.
   Egypt is involved in current peace efforts in hopes of acting as
``a bridge'' and ``because the parties want us there,'' Mubarak has
said.
   Fahd's four-day official visit is the first by a Saudi monarch
to Egypt in 15 years. The Egyptian officials said the meetings with
Fahd, Hussein and Arafat should strengthen Mubarak's hand with Bush.
   After the Ismailiya discussions, Mubarak, Hussein and Arafat
renewed the demand for an international peace conference and
praised the current U.S. position on Middle East peace as
``positive.''
   Hussein said: ``We believe the United States is giving great
attention to this problem and we hope the American position will
crystallize very soon. ... We all hope to see progress toward
comprehensive peace in the region and we believe the international
conference is the only means to this end.''
   Bush renewed his promise of action twice last week.
   In an interview published Friday, he told The Washington Times
he planned to tell Shamir ``we have got to move the peace process
forward.''
   In a White House statement released Saturday, he said the 10th
anniversary of the Egyptian-Israeli treaty ``turns our minds toward
the still more daunting challenges ahead. ... We must commit
ourselves, as Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin did, to fresh
thinking.''
   President Sadat and Begin, then Israel's prime minister,
negotiated the treaty. Sadat was assassinated in 1981.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said
Monday that ultrarightists in the government and military oppose
democratic reforms and are ``attempting to bring about a catstrophe
by any means.''
   They fear losing their hold on power and ``feel as if their
throats are being choked by demcoratic reforms,'' he said in an
address to the Foreign Press Club.
   Kim also said he is opposed to a referendum on President Roh
Tae-woo's administration and that he favors the presence of
American troops in South Korea until peace can be secured with
communist North Korea.
   In other developments:
   _Police detained 23 dissidents who tried to reach the North
Korean border for a reunification meeting with communist delegates
at Panmunjom, the truce site established in the demilitarized zone
under the cease-fire that ended the Korean War in 1953. The
dissidents had defied a government order barring South Koreans from
going to the meeting.
   _Government prosecutors said that a dissident leader, the
Rev.Moon Ik-hwan, would be arrested if he returns to Seoul from an
unauthorized visit to North Korea.
   They said Moon would face prosecution under national security
laws and if convicted could be sentenced to up to 10 years in
prison.
   Moon arrived Saturday in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital,
after a trip to Japan and China. South Korean officials denounced
Moon for a speech he made in Pyongyang in which he called North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung a ``respectable president.''
   Roh announced on March 20 that he was indefinitely postponing
the planned midterm referendum on his government's performance, but
Kim Dae-jung urged the president not to hold such an election.
   He said a referendum could plunge the nation into chaos and
allow extreme rightists to seize control.
   Roh has said he postponed the referendum because radical
leftists were plotting a revolution.
   Kim Dae-jung, leader of the Party for Peace and Democracy, said
it would be premature to conduct a refereundum because Roh has not
carried out all of the democratic reforms he promised during the
election campaign.
   ``Our goal is not to expel him (Roh), but to complete work for
true democracy,'' he added.
   Some observers believe Kim Dae-jung does not want a referendum
because polls show he is trailing rival opposition leader Kim
Young-sam.
   They said if the people voted against Roh's administration it
could have forced an election and Kim Young-sam had the best chance
of winning.
   Roh, a former general, won the election in December 1987 after
Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam split the opposition vote.
   Kim Dae-jung rejected the anti-Americanism of many radical
groups that are demanding the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
military personnel based in South Korea.
   He said he favored Amerian troops remaining here until a
permanent peace with North Korea is assured.

<HEAD>Fishermen Say `I Told You So' After Huge Oil Spill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tanker Spill, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fishermen who warned years ago that an
oil spill could wreak havoc with Prince William Sound's pristine
environment say their worst fears have been realized.
   ``It's a heck of a way to win an argument,'' said fisherman
Knute Johnson, 62, who opposed the 1977 construction of an oil
terminal in Valdez, the nation's northernmost ice-free port.
   Johnson joined a group of fishermen who testified in the 1970s
before a congressional committee considering construction of the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the oil terminal.
   ``We were concerned about what biological damages could be,''
Johnson said Monday. ``We were concerned about tankers piling up on
reefs.''
   The oil companies ``ignored us,'' he said. ``All they said was
that the latest technology would be used. They said not to worry
about a spill because it would never happen. Now it's happened.''
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground early Friday on a charted
reef as it maneuvered around floating ice 25 miles south of Valdez.
Cleanup of the 10.1 million-gallon spill, the largest in U.S.
history, was proceeding slowly Monday as high winds and currents
spread the oil over more than 100 square miles.
   A $12 million herring-roe fishery expected to open in early
April may be ruined, while other fisheries may suffer this summer
and for years to come, said Marilyn Leland, executive director for
the Cordova District Fishermen United. Some fishermen could go
broke waiting for other fisheries to open, she said.
   Last year, fishermen on Prince William Sound caught $131 million
in salmon, herring, halibut and shellfish.
   Even if this year's catch is good, marketing the fish could be
difficult, said Sandra Cesarini, co-owner of a Valdez
fish-processing company. ``People are concerned whether the fish
will be edible,'' she said.
   Charter boat operations and other businesses dependent on
tourism say the spill is tarnishing the pristine image of the
island-dotted sound, which is surrounded by glacier-topped
mountains and filled with whales, bald eagles, porpoises and other
wildlife.
   Leland said one of the hardest-hit towns may be Cordova, 30
miles east of the spill. The town's population swells to 6,000
residents during fishing season.
   ``Everybody is here because of fishing in Cordova,'' Leland
said. ``We can be looking at a devastating loss.''
   Up to 50 fishermen offered their boats for the messy job of
pulling containment booms around fingers of the oil spill, but by
Monday only four boats had been used.
   Cesarini said she already is losing money because of the spill.
A boat en route to the cannery with 14,000 pounds of scallops had
to be diverted because the spill closed the Port of Valdez.
   ``We're talking about $1 million lost income right this
second,'' with more losses likely to follow, she said. ``We're
pretty outraged. This was to have been our best year.''
   Fishermen met Sunday with Exxon officials to discuss claims for
compensation for immediate losses as well as losses expected from
damage to the marine environment during the next 20 years. The
company said it will operate claims offices in Valdez and Cordvoa.
   The spill may affect dozens of charter boats, cruise ships and
state-run ferries that cater to the summer tourist trade. In
Valdez, population 3,100, motels and restaurants are packed now
with oil spill workers, government officials and journalists, but
the boom soon may give way to a bust.
   ``I wouldn't expect people in Iowa will want to see beautfiful
Prince William Sound with oil floating in it,'' Leland said.
   ``It's a negative we'll probably live with all summer long,''
said Bob Scott, owner of Alaska Glacier Tours in Anchorage, which
coordinates cruises in Prince William Sound. ``Any time something
negative happens, that's what people remember. They don't remember
that it's cleaned up.''

   Thousands of ethnic Albanians
clashed with police throughout Kosovo on Monday in the province's
worst ethnic violence in eight years. Two police officers were
reported killed and at least eight people wounded.
   State-run media said violence spread to at least seven Kosovo
towns in the fifth straight day of protests of constitutional
changes that would reduce autonomy in the southern province.
   Helicopters sprayed tear gas on demonstrators in one town, the
Tanjug news agency said, and gunfire was reported in at least three
others.
   Tanjug said officials closed schools and universities and banned
gatherings of more than three people. Authorities also imposed an 8
p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew on the province, permitting only movement
authorized by police, the news agency said.
   Barrages of handgun and automatic weapon fire rang out Monday
afternoon in the suburbs of Pristina, the provincial capital, 160
miles south of Belgrade.
   State-run media said a paramilitary officer was shot and killed
in clashes with thousands of Albanians in Podujevo, 20 miles north
of Pristina.
   Another police officer was fatally shot in the town of Titova
Mitrovica, Belgrade radio said.
   In addition, unconfirmed reports said two demonstrators were
killed in Podujevo.
   State-run media reported only eight injuries by early evening,
but witnesses and media reports suggested many more had been
wounded in the violence.
   Two Associated Press reporters traveling through Kosovo on
Monday saw hundreds of military vehicles, including modern
Soviet-made T-72 tanks, on the move.
   Helmeted riot police carrying shields and wearing gas masks used
tear gas, batons, water cannon and even armored personnel carriers
to disperse thousands of ethnic Albanians.
   Police road blocks ringed Pristina and at least one other town,
Lipljan, was reported temporarily sealed off by police during a
fierce battle with demonstrators hurling rocks and bottles. There
were similar battles in Gnjilane, according to television reports.
   By evening, there was no visible military presence in Pristina.
   Kosovo's governing body, the collective presidency, said
Monday's demonstrations ``were characterized by unprecedented
brutality and aggressiveness,'' the state news agency Tanjug
reported.
   The protests were the worst since 1981, when at least nine
people died in ethnic riots in the province.
   The protests began Thursday, when Kosovo's Parliament approved
constitutional amendments giving leaders from the mainly Christian
republic of Serbia more power in Kosovo. Serbia is the largest of
the country's six republics.
   Serbia's provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina have enjoyed
considerable autonomy since 1974, but Serbian leaders said they
needed more control over Kosovo to protect the mainly Christian
Serbian minority from the mainly Moslem ethnic Albanian majority,
which makes up 85 percent of the vote.
   Tanjug said Monday that 174 ethnic Albanians have been detained
in Kosovo since Thursday. Seventy-eight of them have been sentenced
to between 30 and 60 days in jail on misdemeanor charges, the
agency said.
   More than 100 other ethnic Albanians were sentenced to 60 days
in jail Monday for defying compulsory orders to work and end
protest strikes at two Kosovo mines, Tanjug said.
   A partial state of emergency was imposed on the province last
month because of the strikes.
   The ethnic unrest in Kosovo has deepened divisions in
Yugoslavia's Communist leadership, with leaders in the more liberal
northern republics of Croatia and Slovenia opposing Serbia's drive
for more control over Kosovo.
   The Belgrade daily Borba reported Monday that an unsigned appeal
to the human rights organization Amnesty International was
published in Slovenia protesting the arrests of ethnic Albanians.
   Among those detained is Azem Vlasi, a former Communist party
leader in Kosovo, who is accused of fomenting strikes by ethnic
Albanian workers last month. He is the first party man detained on
political grounds in Yugoslavia since the 1950s.
   Kosovo is Yugoslavia's poorest region, with 30 percent
unemployment, twice the national average.
   Ethnic tension throughout the country has been exacerbated by
the long political and economic crisis, with annual inflation
expected to hit 400 percent in April.

   The government released contradictory
findings in the 1984 assassination of Premier Indira Gandhi Monday,
one implicating her personal secretary and expressing the suspicion
that he was linked to the CIA.
   A memorandum accompanying this report exonerated the secretary,
said Home Minister Buta Singh in releasing the report to Parliament.
   Singh disclosed at the same time that separate investigations
that did not figure in the report ``unraveled a conspiracy, a
larger conspiracy to eliminate Mrs. Gandhi,''and that more arrests
were expected shortly.
   Two Sikh bodyguards shot and killed Mrs. Gandhi on Oct. 31,
1984, as she walked through the garden of her New Delhi residence
to a television interview. Her son, Rajiv, replaced her as prime
minister.
   A report by an investigative commission under Supreme Court
Justice M.P. Thakkar was completed nearly three years ago, but was
kept secret on national security grounds. This inquiry ran parallel
to an inquiry of police experts called the Special Investigating
Team.
   The 314-page Thakkar report implicated Rajendra Kumar Dhawan,
Mrs. Gandhi's secretary for more than 20 years, and also said
security officials were aware of the threat to Mrs. Gandhi's life
and could have prevented the murder.
   A memorandum accompanying the report said the allegations were
checked out by the Special Investigating Team, appointed by the
government to lay charges against those involved, and it found
Dhawan had ``no hand in the conspiracy.''
   Singh told Parliament the team completed its work in January and
added that charges will be filed soon against others involved in
the conspiracy.
   The Thakkar report links only three people directly to the
assassination: the two known gunmen and Dhawan.
   Dhawan, 52, left government after the assassination, but
returned last month as an adviser to Rajiv Gandhi. Dhawan could not
be reached at his home or office for comment, but the government
has said he is innocent.
   According to the Thakkar report, Mrs. Gandhi reprimanded Dhawan
a month before her death and made inquiries about replacing him.
   It accused Dhawan of facilitating the murder by countermanding
an order to remove all Sikhs from the inner security circle,
approving shift changes for one assassin, and keeping secret
instructions about Mrs. Gandhi's security that indicated ``he was
snooping or spying on the late prime minister and was active as an
informant for someone.''
   The report said Dhawan was walking with Mrs. Gandhi to the
interview, but fell back just before the shooting started.
   ``It appears that he has been making a deliberate effort to
emphasize that he had not noticed Beant Singh taking out his
revolver from his hip pocket,'' the report said.
   It said Dhawan lied or gave inadequate reponses to questions
about entries in his diary about one assassin, foreign money, the
CIA and his association with a Sikh suspected of having ties to the
U.S. intelligence agency, which ``gives rise to a suspicion as to
whether Dhawan had some links with the CIA.''
   The Thakkar report said security officials ``appear to have
taken things for granted.'' It said ``high officials ... were aware
of the threat to the life of the prime minister'' and that ``the
unfortunate occurrence could have been averted'' through careful
study and precautionary action.
   Thakkar finished his report in February 1986, but recommended it
be kept secret lest its contents jeopardize other investigations.
   Only Gandhi and two senior Cabinet ministers had seen the report
when Parliament passed a resolution in July 1986 allowing it to be
withheld.
   Two weeks ago, the Indian Express newspaper published excerpts
and oppostion lawmakers demanded the report be released. Gandhi
made it public after some members of his Congress Party said they
would do it if he did not.
   The government says Mrs. Gandhi was killed in revenge for an
army raid she ordered in June 1984 on Sikhdom's holiest shrine the
Golden Temple, to clear the compound of militants. At least 1,200
people died, most of them Sikhs.
   Other bodyguards shot and killed one assassin, Beant Singh, and
the other, Satwant Singh, was convicted of murder and hanged on
Jan. 6. A third Sikh, Kehar Singh, was convicted of conspiracy and
hanged.
   The three men were not related. All male Sikhs take the name
Singh, which means lion.

   President Bush plans to nominate Alfred A.
DelliBovi, a former New York state legislator who was a
transportation official in the Reagan administration, as
undersecretary of housing and urban development, the White House
announced Monday.
   DelliBovi has been administrator of the Urban Mass
Transportation Administration since 1987. Before that, he had been
deputy administrator since 1984 and regional administrator for New
York from 1981 to 1984. He was a member of the New York State
Assembly from 1971 to 1978.
   The White House also announced that the president intends to
nominate William G. Rosenberg to be an assistant administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency. Rosenberg has been chairman of
The Investment Group in Ann Arbor, Mich., and Washington since 1982.
   In addition, the White House said the president will nominate
Francis Anthony Keating II, the outgoing associate attorney
general, as general counsel of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. Keating was assistant secretary of the Treasury for
enforcement from 1955 to 1958 and before that was U.S. attorney for
the Northern District of Oklahoma.
   In another personnel announcement, the White House said Bush
will nominate John C. Weicher, associate director for economic
policy in the Office of Management and Budget since 1987, to be
assistant secretary of housing and urban development for policy
development and research.

   A bomb exploded near a British
cultural center early Tuesday, hours after Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe of Britain arrived to discuss the controversy over
the novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Police said no one was injured in the 1 a.m. blast at a building
under construction about 10 yards from the British Council Library.
   It broke windows in the library and some surrounding shops, but
damage appeared to be slight. Bomb experts at the scene had no
immediate information on the explosives used.
   There were no claims of responsibility, but the bombing appeared
to be linked to anti-British protests over ``The Satanic Verses,''
by Salman Rushdie, a naturalized British subject born in India.
   An explosion at a British Council Library in Karachi, Pakistan's
largest city, killed a Pakistani guard on Feb. 27. Police said they
believed the blast was related to Rushdie's book.
   Moslems feel the novel blasphemes Islam. The book includes a
brothel scene in which the prostitutes take the names of wives of
the Prophet Mohammed, and it suggests Mohammad wrote the holy Koran
rather than receiving it directly from Allah.
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Feb. 14, when Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenie ordered Moslems kill the author.
Rushdie, who was born a Moslem but no longer practices religion,
has defended his work as a fictional examination of the nature of
good and evil.
   Howe arrived in Pakistan Monday afternoon amid unprecedented
security designed to prevent protests over the book.
   About 2,000 police lined the 12-mile route from Islamabad
Airport to the British Embassy. Authorities barred would-be
protesters from demonstrating at the embassy.
   ``If our government would have allowed the demonstration, Howe
would have felt the depth of our feeling,'' said Mustaza Pooya, a
member of the conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance.
   Pooya was among a delegation of fundamentalist religious leaders
and right-wing Pakistani politicians that was allowed to present a
four-page memorandum to the foreign secretary criticizing Britain
for protecting Rushdie.
   Howe was ``willing to concede that the book certainly caused
anguish,'' Pooya said after the meeting. Reporters were barred.
   Authorities imposed a ban on public gatherings in Islamabad of
more than five people during Howe's 26-hour visit.
   Seven people died and more than 100 were injured in Islamabad on
Feb. 12 when hundreds of demonstrators battled police outside an
American cultural center to protest publicatin of ``The Satanic
Verses'' in the United States.
   Pakistan, a Moslem country of 107 million people, banned ``The
Satanic Verses'' after its publication in Britain last September.
   Howe was to meet with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to discuss the Rushdie crisis, British
aid to Pakistan, and both countries' support of Moslem rebels
battling the communist government in neighboring Afghanistan.

   A missing sludge barge which eluded searchers for
days, even though it was as big as a football field and brightly
lit, was towed back to New York after being discovered off Bermuda,
a Coast Guard official said Monday.
   The empty barge, the Princess B, drifted to sea during a storm
Feb. 25. It was found March 17 by an oil tanker 180 miles west of
Bermuda and towed back Saturday to New York Harbor.
   Even though Coast Guard officials spent a week combing 65,000
square miles of ocean for the barge, which has strong floodlights
and a homing device, it was found by a passing ship that was not
looking for it.
   ``We had stopped looking for it, so we were pretty surprised,''
Coast Guard Petty Officer David Jersey said Monday in Boston, where
the search was organized. ``It should never have (drifted) so far.
We don't know what happened to it.''

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government denied a news report that
it seeks to trade a Palestinian the United States accuses of
terrorism for a fugitive Greek banker held in an American jail.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos told reporters Greece
``is not negotiating'' the extradition of Mohammed Rashid in
exchange for George Koskotas.
   Rashid, 39, is wanted by the United States in the bombing of a
Pan Am jetliner over Hawaii in 1982. A Japanese teen-ager was
killed and 15 people were wounded.
   Greece wants Koskotas, 34, in a multimillion-dollar financial
scandal that emerged in October and has shaken the Socialist
government of Premier Andreas Papandreou.
   Papandreou has spoken, without elaboration, of ``consequences''
if the United States does not extradite Koskotas before the general
election June 18.
   A statement issued by the U.S. Embassy said: ``the U.S.
government has never linked the two cases. Each case must be
decided on its own merit.''
   Both official responses followed a report by U.S. News and World
Report, an American weekly news magazine, that an exchange was
being discussed.
   Koskotas fled Greece in November after being indicted in the
$200 million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal. He was
arrested in the United States and is in jail in Salem, Mass.,
awaiting an extradition hearing.
   In interviews from jail, the former chairman of the Bank of
Crete has claimed Papandreou and other high government officials
received millions of dollars in payoffs and authorized the looting
of his bank.
   Eight Greek government ministers resigned because of the
scandal, and four state-appointed managers of public enterprises,
such as the post office and telephone company, have been sent to
jail.
   Rashid was arrested in Greece last May and jailed pending a
decision on extradition from the Supreme Court, which has been
delayed twice.
   He is to answer charges in court Tuesday that he had a knife
hidden in his cell. Rashid was cleared of the same charge Feb. 20,
but a district attorney asked that the verdict be overturned.
   A conviction could delay extradition further.

   The Supreme Court was urged Monday to find a
national consensus ``against executing our young'' and ban the
death penalty for all juvenile murderers.
   ``There is a consensus of opinion in this country against
executing our young,'' argued attorney Nancy McKerrow in behalf of
a Missouri death row inmate condemned for a murder he committed
when he was 16.
   But questions from the bench during two hours of arguments in
cases from Missouri and Kentucky suggested the justices doubt that
any clear consensus exists.
   The high court is to decide by July whether imposing the death
penalty on murderers who committed their crimes before reaching the
age of 18 represents the ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by
the Constitution's Eighth Amendment.
   In the Missouri case, Heath Wilkins was condemned for a murder
he committed when he was 16. In the Kentucky case, Kevin Stanford
was sentenced to death for a killing he committed when he was 17.
   The court's decision will affect only 31 of the more than 2,200
death row inmates nationwide. Anti-capital punishment forces
nevertheless are attaching enormous importance to the issue.
   The justices were told that of the 36 states with capital
punishment laws, only 12 ban the death penalty for killers who were
under 18 when they committed their crimes.
   Noting the lack of unanimity among state legislatures, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist asked, ``Why should we set the bright
line at 18?''
   Ms. McKerrow, a lawyer from Columbia, Mo., answered that 18 ``is
the age most commonly chosen for demarking the separation between
childhood and adulthood.''
   She noted that 80 Missouri laws treat individuals under 18
differently from those over 18 _ including a law that bars
juveniles from witnessing executions.
   Ms. McKerrow also noted that the American Bar Association and
the National Council of Juvenile Court Judges have supported
banning capital punishment for juvenile killers.
   Frank Heft Jr., a Louisville lawyer, argued for Stanford that
people under 18 are ``children who have not evolved into adults''
and who ``have a tremendous capacity for change.''
   The issue is not whether a line should be drawn but where to
draw the line,'' Heft contended.
   Lawyers for Missouri and Kentucky urged the justices to leave
any line-drawing to state legislatures.
   ``What is a national consensus?'' asked Missouri Assistant
Attorney General John Morris III.
   He said the fact that Wilkins, the convicted Missouri killer,
could have been condemned in 22 states despite his age
``demonstrates an absence of a national consensus'' regarding a
minimum age for executions.
   Morris did not explain the apparent conflict between his use of
the 22-state figure and the fact that 24 of the 36 states with
death penalty laws do not exempt those under 18.
   Kentucky Attorney General Frederic Cowan said state legislatures
may choose to exempt juveniles from the death penalty as a matter
of mercy, but argued, ``The Constitution is an instrument of
justice, not an instrument of mercy.''
   He added, ``Common sense dictates that youths mature at
different rates.''
   The high court effectively drew the allowable capital-punishment
line at age 16 last year when it voted 5-3 to throw out the death
penalty of an Oklahoma killer who committed his crime when he was
15.
   Four members of the court _ Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens _ said
in that decision that the death penalty is unconstitutional for
those younger than 16.
   Three _ Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia
_ said that the Constitution does not set such age limits.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who asked only two neutral
questions Monday, provided a fifth vote last year but stopped short
of calling for the abolition of capital punishment for killers
under 16.
   She will provide a key vote in the Missouri and Kentucky cases.
So, too, will Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court in
February 1988, too late to participate in the Oklahoma case.
   Kennedy asked numerous questions Monday, some of which focused
on a jury's ability to take a defendant's youth into account even
if the death penalty is a possibility.
   The cases are Wilkins vs. Missouri, 87-6026, and Heft vs. Cowan,
87-5765.

   Iran said Monday it will boycott the
Istanbul film festival in Turkey because ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' a film considered blasphemous by many Christians, is to
be shown, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a statement by the
Culture and Information Ministry's film division as saying, ``The
showing of this film, especially in a Moslem country, is an insult
to ... all those who believe in God, and is playing into the hands
of global arrogance (the United States), which fears the role of
religion in awakening the oppressed countries.''
   The film by American director Martin Scorsese was adapted from a
novel. Many U.S. and West European Christians condemned it for a
dream sequence in which Jesus descends from the cross, seduces Mary
Magdalene and raises a family.
   Moslems consider Jesus a prophet.
   Monday's development follows a major diplomatic confrontation
with the West over the novel ``The Satanic Verses'' by British
novelist Salman Rushdie.
   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini condemned the book as
blasphemous for its treatment of the prophet Mohammed and sentenced
Rushdie to death.
   Iran also is in a diplomatic spat with Turkey for banning
Islamic dress for women on Turkish university campuses.

   The chairman of the presidential commission
that investigated the Three Mile Island accident said Monday that
the nuclear power industry apparently has heeded the panel's
recommendations and become more safety conscious.
   ``We warned them that unless they changed their attitude
completely they would be out of business, and it sounds to me as if
they took it to heart,'' John Kemeny said on the eve of the 10th
anniversary of the nation's worst atomic power accident.
   Kemeny, a former Dartmouth College president, based his
assessment on a recent report by the Institute of Nuclear Power
Operations, a group the industry established after Three Mile
Island to work on safety issues. The institute concluded that the
nation's 111 nuclear power plants now licensed are safer and more
efficient.
   ``I'm not saying that every problem has been fixed,'' Kemeny
said in an interview. But he said it was ``very hard for me to
believe that it's the same industry we really tore apart 10 years
ago.''
   Still, Kemeny said he was concerned that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission may have become even more mired in a maze of regulations
that don't necessarily insure safety.
   Referring to reports that the NRC mandated 149 changes based on
his commission's recommendations, Kemeny said: ``That's typical
madness to me. I wish they had mandated 40 important (changes).
They'd have a much better chance of compliance.''
   Kemeny, 62, is a mathematician who had a small role in the
Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bomb during World
War II, and who later worked as a research assistant to Albert
Einstein. President Carter appointed Kemeny to head a 12-member
commission to investigate the Three Mile Island accident.
   The panel spent six months investigating the March 28, 1979,
partial meltdown at the nuclear power plant in Middletown, Pa.
   Among its recommendations that the NRC adopted were establishing
10-mile evacuation-planning zones around commercial reactors and
requiring an array of new control-room equipment to better apprise
operators of a plant's safety status.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., charged during the weekend that
nearly four out of five U.S. atomic plants still have failed to
complete all the changes.
   Kemeny did not dispute Markey's allegations, but reached a
different conclusion, noting an NRC official's statement that more
than 97 percent of the changes have been completed.
   ``Remember, these are all changes, none of which were in place
10 years ago,'' Kemeny said. ``I think that's substantial change.''
   Ten years ago Kemeny called the NRC ``the worst government
agency that existed.'' He said he still has concerns.
   ``What we found (then) was that they had such a huge number of
regulations _ they regulated everything, even minute things _ that
many (nuclear plant officials) ... spent all their time making sure
that they met all the regulations, rather than worrying whether
their plant was safe,'' Kemeny said.
   ``I don't mean that those two things are inconsistent, but just
because you meet all the paper regulations does not mean your plant
is safe.''
   Kemeny said he hasn't followed the commission closely in recent
years, but noted that the private Institute of Nuclear Power
Operations duplicates much of the information sharing, inspection
and training that the NRC does, sometimes with stricter standards.
   ``To me that's a suggestion that the industry itself feels that
the NRC is not sufficient,'' Kemeny said.
   ``Let me say one thing for the NRC,'' he added. ``I don't think
regulation alone can solve this problem. Unless the industry has a
commitment to safety, no amount of regulation can solve it.''

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega urged the U.S.
Congress on Monday to reconsider a proposed aid package to the
Nicaraguan rebels, saying the guerrillas were ``a cannon aimed at
Nicaragua.''
   Ortega, speaking to 60 Harvard scholars from 37 countries,
accused the United States of ignoring a Central American peace plan
that commits regional leaders to drafting a program by mid-May to
dismantle the rebel force.
   He said of the bipartisan aid package unveiled Friday in
Washington, ``It reaffirms once again the policy that the strongest
can act without regard for the will of others.''
   The proposal, worked out between the Bush administration and
congressional leaders, provides $4.5 million a month in
non-military aid to the rebels, known as Contras. The current $27.1
million in humanitarian aid runs out Friday.
   The package proposes aid at least through November and could
continue through Feb. 28, 1990, if congressional committees approve.
   ``If the U.S. Congress were respectful of our accord, it would
approve aid for 90 days, and gear it to the dismantling of the
Contras,'' Ortega told the gathering of Mason Fellowship scholars,
in Nicaragua on a one-day visit.
   ``What they're trying to do is maintain intact a force in
Honduran territory, which is like a cannon aimed at Nicaragua. The
president of Honduras himself has insisted he has not agreed that
the Contras remain for another 10 months or a year.''
   He said Congress ``still has time to rectify, and show its
respect for the will of the Central American presidents.''
   Ortega moved up general elections in Nicaragua by 10 months to
Feb. 25, 1990, as part of the regional peace plan he and the
presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica
reached in El Salvador on Feb. 14.
   The presidents agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May to
demobilize up to 11,000 Contras living in Honduran jungle camps
near Nicaragua with about 12,000 relatives.
   Most guerrillas moved from Nicaragua into the camps after
Congress cut off military aid in February 1988. A month later, the
Contras and Sandinistas signed a cease-fire, which Nicaragua has
been extending every month since.
   Ortega said Congress might consider redirecting the proposed $45
million in aid to Nicaragua, which could use the money to build
9,000 homes for victims of last October's Hurricane Joan.
   He said with $45 million, Nicaragua could buy food to feed
750,000 people for seven months, or milk for 2.8 million children.
   ``That indeed would be humanitarian aid,'' Ortega said. ``We
hope this is a document with a rhetorical tint ... and that deep
inside it really is looking for a peaceful solution. But their
actions will be the determinant'' factor.
   Responding to questions, Ortega said he finds it inconceivable
that the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front could lose
next year's elections.
   ``The people would have to be crazy to vote against the Front .
.. against the revolution,'' Ortega said. ``The peasant, the worker
who has seen his wife, his son killed by the Contras is not going
to vote against the Front.''
   He said Nicaraguans have ``discovered the ... capacity of
capitalism to exploit them, to keep them in ignorance, the capacity
to deny them the right to organize. ... Now, the day the people
don't want any more revolution, they have the vote and the weapons
in their hands. The people decide. The Front cannot impose anything
on the people.''
   Barricada, the official Sandinista paper, and the pro-government
El Nuevo Diario said Monday the U.S. aid package is proof the
Sandinistas won Nicaragua's eight-year civil war.
   ``U.S. Makes Official Nicaragua's Triumph,'' said El Nuevo
Diario's headline.
   Erick Ramirez of the Social-Christian Party said the U.S. aid
proposal sounded the rebels' death knell.
   It ``effectively foresees the end of the war,'' he said in an
interview. ``The war has no future and I believe the United States
must channel its efforts in that direction.''

   Leftist guerrillas released an empty railroad
car parked at a siding Monday, and the car killed three people as
it rumbled down the tracks for nine miles before coming to a halt,
officials reported.
   Enafer, the state railroad company, said the car was set loose
near Chosica, 25 miles east of Lima. It blamed left-wing rebels but
did not name a specific group.
   The brief statement did not identify the three people who were
killed or give any other details.
   Officials reported two policemen were slain by gunmen of the
Maoist Shining Path movement in separate attacks.
   They said a police captain was fatally wounded by four
guerrillas who shot him as he walking to his home in Huancayo, 140
miles east of Lima, Sunday night. The other policeman was slain
Sunday night in a downtown market in Pucallpa, 235 miles northeast
of Lima, according to the officials.
   Peruvians began receiving their mail Monday when postal service
resumed after a strike for nearly two months by members of the
National Federation of Postal Workers who sought salary increases.
   The government and union reached an agreement Thursday on a wage
and benefit package but no details were released.
   About 85 percent of Peru's 7,000 postal employees participated
in the strike that began Feb. 2 and halted home mail delivery and
other services.
   Officials said some 10 million letters were placed in post
office storerooms during the strike.
   The nation's 70,000 miners stayed on the job after the National
Federation of Mine Workers called off a three-day strike set to
begin Monday.
   The union said talks with the government were planned Tuesday
and the strike could be rescheduled depending on the outcome of the
meeting. Miners were demanding that contracts be negotiated jointly
instead of on the current company-by-company basis.
   Peru has been hit with dozens of strikes since the economy
spiraled into deep recession a year ago.
   In most cases, workers demanded pay increases to offset
inflation, which hit 1,722 percent in 1988.

   A United Airlines Boeing 747 jumbo
jet was forced to return to Auckland Airport on Monday night with
engine problems, a spokesman for the American carrier said.
   Flight 812 was on its way to Honolulu carrying 280 passengers
and 18 crew when one of its four engines malfunctioned, United
spokesman Wayne Dodge said Tuesday.
   The engine was shut down and the captain dumped fuel before
landing safely 45 minutes after takeoff. Some passengers and
witnesses on the ground reported seeing flames, the New Zealand
Press Association reported.
   ``I saw a flash of flame in the pilot's far right-hand engine
and then there was a big boom like a sonic boom. The flame seemed
to last a few seconds,'' the news agency quoted witness Bob McElroy
as saying.
   Dodge, the airline's New Zealand general manager, said there was
no fire. Sometimes there is ``a bit of a flash'' when an engine was
shut down, he said.
   Last month, nine people were sucked to their deaths when a
fuselage section ripped off a United Boeing 747 en route from
Honolulu to Auckland.

   Actor Edward James Olmos will appear in a
series of spots sponsored by Pepsi to encourage students to stay in
school, the company announced Monday.
   The public service announcements tie in with Olmos' film role as
Los Angeles school teacher Jaimie Escalante in ``Stand an
Deliver.'' The part put Olmos in contention for a best-actor Oscar
at this week's Academy Awards ceremony.
   One 90-second spot to be appended to the videocassette version
of ``Stand and Deliver'' has Olmos explaining that while Escalante
taught calculus to students in Los Angeles' barrio, the real lesson
he taught was one of perseverance and courage.
   In another ad, Olmos tells how he considered dropping out ``to
discover the world and maybe earn some money.'' He says he realized
that would have been the wrong decision and that ``staying in
school beats dropping out.''

   More than 100 passengers on a Continental

malfunctioned moments after takeoff.
   The jet touched down early Monday morning at Houston
Intercontinental Airport 10 minutes after takeoff, officials said.
   The 113 passengers were given overnight accommodations and
rescheduled on later flights, said Continental spokesman David
Messing.
   Only 10 to 20 seconds after leaving the runway, the pilot
radioed the airport tower, saying one of the Airbus A300's two
engines was not working.
   ``She sounded real good _ no problems,'' Richard Lackey, an air
traffic control specialist, said of the pilot. ``She just said they
shut down No. 2 engine and they were going to come back and land.''
   A Continental spokesman said the engine was not completely shut
down, but put on what would be the equivalent of idle. He said he
did not know what caused the problem.

   Claudio Santoro, who was
considered Brazil's most important living composer, died of a heart
attack Monday. He was 69.
   Santoro collapsed onstage while conducting an orchestra
rehearsal in the capital, Brasilia, and died shortly afterwards,
according to the government news agency Radiobras.
   Santoro, born in the western Amazon port of Manaus in 1919,
studied violin and composed his first symphony when he was 19.
   His eclectic opus of symphonies, concertos, and operas included
atonal and popular works. Among his best known works was the 1943
symphony ``Impressions of a Steel Foundry.''
   Considered one of the successors to renowned 20th century
Brazilian composer Heitor Villas Lobos, Santoro was also among the
most important authorities on contemporary Brazilian music.
   He was particularly well known in Europe, where he performed and
taught music in the 1960s.
   Santoro is survived by a wife and six children. Radiobras said
the funeral date and site was not announced.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A mob with machetes attacked and
seriously wounded seven U.S. missionaries after a pickup truck
carrying the Americans accidentally ran over two Haitians, Radio
Haiti-Inter reported Monday.
   In Washington, a State Department official put the number of
Americans injured in the incident Sunday at 12, but said none was
hurt seriously. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said some Americans were hospitalized and that others were treated
and released.
   The report by independent Radio Haiti-Inter said seven Free
Methodist Church missionaries were hospitalized in serious
condition with multiple machete wounds after the attack, and the
two Haitians suffered broken legs.
   The missionaries and Haitians were not immediately identified.
The State Department said it was not authorized to release the
missionaries' names because of the Privacy Act.
   The radio station said the attack occurred after the pickup
truck went out of control and plowed into the Haitians, who were
celebrating the Lenten season on a highway near Leogane, about 18
miles southwest of Port-au-Prince.
   Bystanders stoned the truck and set upon the missionaries with
machetes, the report said. It did not say what caused the truck
driver to lose control.
   Two witnesses told The Associated Press the missionaries were
saved by the arrival of a soldier, who fired a shot into the air to
quiet the crowd.
   The man and woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
some of the missionaries also were armed and that they fired their
weapons.
   The witnesses said they were driving home to Port-au-Prince from
Leogane region when they came upon the scene. They described it as
``nightmarish.''
   The truck struck the crowd, and the pedestrians interpreted that
action as a deliberate attempt to harm them, the witnesses said.
   Bands of revelers known as ``ra-ras'' are a Lenten season
tradition in Haiti. They wander about, chanting and playing drums
and bamboo trumpets.
   The State Department official said the Americans planned to
return to the United States on Tuesday. The official did not know
whether the trip was scheduled as a result of the Sunday incident.

   Warm air spread through the Northeast and Great Lakes states on
Monday, toppling temperature records and causing some spring
flooding. Texas and Oklahoma were pounded by thunderstorms and hail.
   Tornadoes were spotted in southwest Oklahoma during a storm that
packed 70 mph winds and caused damage at a trailer park near
Woodward. Hail the size of tennis balls fell amid the thunderstorms
at Giles, Texas.
   Tornado watches were in effect from east central and south
central Kansas to far western Oklahoma and the eastern part of
Texas panhandle and portions of southwest Texas.
   An unseasonably warm air mass carried spring weather into the
Great Lakes and along much of the Eastern Seaboard.
   It was 78 degrees in Rochester, N.Y., the highest temperature
there since last Oct. 1. Records for the date also were set in at
least 25 other places, including Dulles International Airport in
Washington, where it was 78; Buffalo, N.Y. (72); Alpena, Mich.
(65); Cleveland (80); Greer, S.C. (78); Youngstown, Ohio (77);
Charleston, W.V. (80); and Meridian, Miss (85).
   The high of 80 degrees in Des Moines, Iowa, tied a 94-year-old
record for the date.
   The warm weather caused a rapid snowmelt in northern sections of
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Some flooding was reported in
Wisconsin as creeks swelled due to the melted snow.
   Dense fog formed overnight from eastern portions of the Dakotas
to the upper Mississippi Valley and the northern Great Lakes.
   There were thunderstorms in the northern Great Lakes and light
rain from the lower Ohio Valley into western Tennessee. Rain also
was reported in the Pacific Northwest, and there were scattered
showers in the northern Rockies.
   Sunshine and relatively cool temperatures prevailed in the
Southwest, where Yuma, Ariz., and Palm Springs, Calif., reported
temperatures of just 70 degrees at 11 am PST.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 pm EST ranged from 31
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 90 degrees at Harlingen, Texas.
The nation's low was 15 degrees at Flagstaff, Ariz.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for showers and thunderstorms
from Texas to the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, the southern Great
Lakes; scattered showers in the northern Great Lakes and northern
New England; widespread rain from the Pacific Northwest to Idaho
and western Montana; and windy conditions in the northern Rockies,
the Intermountain West and the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 40s from eastern North
Dakota to northern Minnesota and northern Michigan; 70s and 80s
from Southern California to the desert Southwest and from the
southern Plains to the lower and middle Mississippi Valley, the
middle and south Atlantic coastal states; 70s extending north into
parts of New York state and southern New England; and in the 50s
and 60s elsewhere.

   A woman said Monday she will give birth in a camper
parked outside the Chinese Embassy to protest China's refusal to
let her husband join her in Italy.
   Chinese authorities are ready to let Zhu Juwang leave the
country, but first want him to clear up what they regard as
slanderous charges against the government, an Italian Embassy
official in Beijing said.
   Patrizia Riccardi is expected to give birth to the child's
second couple within days.
   She said she met her husband at a reception in 1986 in
Switzerland, where Zhu was employed with the Chinese delegation to
the United Nations.
   Zhu and Ms. Riccardi were married in Beijing two years later,
after the birth of their first child, David, and after Zhu
renounced the diplomatic post that under Chinese law prevented him
from marrying a foreigner.
   Ms. Riccardi, 33, said the Chinese government has confiscated
her 28-year-old husband's passport and won't allow him out of the
country. She said she had written to Pope John Paul II and Italian
Foreign Minster Giulio Andreotti seeking their intervention.
   In Beijing, Embassy First Secretary Maria Assunta Accili
Sabbatini said, ``We've been told several times by the Chinese
government that they are willing to permit him to join his wife''
once a dispute over his departure from his U.N. post in Geneva in
resolved.
   She said Zhu was in Shanghai waiting for permission to leave
China.
   Chinese authorities have accused Zhu of slandering the
government in a letter written to the United Nations in which he
reportedly says he was forced to quit his job because of his
marriage to a foreigner, Mrs. Sabbatini said.
   The Chinese government says Zhu resigned voluntarily and that
they replaced his diplomatic passport with an ordinary one after
his marriage. The second passport was confiscated after he wrote
the letter to the United Nations, officials say.
   Mrs. Sabbatini said the Chinese told the embassy they were
discussing the matter with U.N. officials in Geneva and New York
and would issue Zhu a passport once the question of his resignation
is clarified.
   She said the Chinese ``don't like very much what his wife is
doing in Italy.''
   Ms. Riccardi has been living in the camper near the embassy for
several days and the police haven't done anything about it. When
informed of her plans to have a baby in the camper, a police
officers said she has a right to do in it what she wants.

   A reactor closed for more than two years at
the Oak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory can be restarted, the
Energy Department announced Monday.
   The High-Flux isotope reactor has been shut down since November,
1986, when it was found to be suffering from embrittlement of the
reactor pressure vessel. The vessels become brittle when
continually bombarded with atomic particles as an offshot of chain
reactions.
   Since then, there have been more than 20 safety studies of the
reactor and Energy Secretary James. D. Watkins said Monday he is
convinced the operation will be safe.
   ``I have reviewed the work that has been done to assure the
safety of this reactor and I am comfortable with the restart of the
reactor,'' said Watkins in a statement.
   The reactor is expected to be restarted within five weeks. It
will be operated at 85 percent power.
   The reactor was constructed in 1966 and is used for research on
a variety of projects.

   Rebellious inmates
Monday night allowed 15 adults and four children o leave a prison
where armed convicts and hundreds of family members are standing
off army and police forces.
   The inspector-general of the National Prisons System, Carlos
Ramos Moncada, said he does not consider as hostages the more than
600 non-inmates still inside Guatemala's biggest prison, 15 miles
east of Guatemala City.
   ``They remain there by choice,'' he told The Associated Press in
an interview outside the prison's main gate. ``The family members
still inside are backing the movement.''
   Ramos Moncada said the last people considered hostages _ four
doctors and two firemen held for 24 hours _ were released at midday.
   At least four guards and three inmates were killed and 20 people
wounded in battles that broke out as prisoners tried to escape on
Easter Sunday afternoon.
   The 19 family members escorted out at 7 p.m. Monday spent about
30 hours in the Pavon prison. Like the 607 family members believed
still inside, they were paying Easter visits to jailed relatives
when the uprising began.
   Ramos Moncada said the prison mutineers had about 75 M-1
carbines taken from prison guard dormitories. He said from 75 to
100 inmates belong to what he repeatedly referred to as ``the
movement.''
   Officials said about 1,350 inmates are at the 2{-square-mile
prison farm and up to 100 joined in the revolt. Prisoners who did
not take part apparently remained in areas not controlled by the
rebels.
   The inspector-general said prisoner demands _ for better food
and reduced sentences _ had not changed since Sunday. He said they
did not demand a plane to fly to Cuba as reported by a local radio
station.
   Clementina Diaz and her 2-year-old son Miguel Angel were among
those leaving the prison Monday night.
   Mrs. Diaz, who was visiting her eldest son Gerardo on Sunday,
said she was escorted her out because her little boy had a fever.
She said rebels asked visitors if they had health problems that
made their stay impossible.
   Alicia Rodriguez, who was visiting her husband, cried as she
spoke from inside a Red Cross van outside the gate.
   ``I was sick from nerves,'' she said, explaining her departure.
   Ramos Moncada said President Vinicio Cerezo ordered prison and
other authorities ``to exhaust every alternative'' in negotiating a
solution. ``Peace and tranquillity is the strict order,'' he said.
   Local news reports said Cerezo gave orders to avoid bloodshed. A
15-minute exchange of gunfire took place Monday morning, but no
casualties were reported.
   Ramos Moncada said ``serious problems remain'' in resolving the
crisis. ``(The rebels) must reform their conduct and surrender the
weapons.''
   Prison spokesman Conrado Monroy earlier told reporters family
members ``fear that if they leave, authorities will take reprisals
against the rebel inmates.''
   Troops were rushed to Pavon when the insurrection began, and on
Monday about 1,000 soldiers and police were reinforcing the
prison's 180 guards as officials negotiated with the rebels.
   Monroy said the rebels added to their demands on Monday, saying
they wanted to be flown to Cuba. He did not elaborate.
   Federal Human Rights Director Gonzalo Menendez de la Riva spent
about five hours inside the prison farm Monday negotiating with the
inmates. He reported later that the women and children there need
food.
   Ricardo Gatica, a journalist for El Grafico newspaper, entered
the prison Sunday as a negotiator. He said a carbine was held at
his temple and a knife at his chest for the first few minutes.
   The inmates ``were aggressive and confused, sometimes arguing
among each other,'' he said.

   For years, the United States has urged,
threatened and cajoled the Kremlin to allow free emigration from
the Soviet Union. But now that thousands of Soviets are being let
out, many are finding the doors to the United States closed.
   Some 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow for permission to enter the United States as
refugees; another 7,000 are waiting in temporary quarters near
Rome, according to State Department figures.
   The steadily growing backlog appears to result from several
factors: poor planning by the administration, severe budget
restraints and a change in the Justice Department's refugee policy.
   ``Now that the Soviet Union has chosen to let these people go,
we must not fail them,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., who has
sponsored one of several proposed funding bills to ease the
emergency.

   The National Rifle Association, traditional
heart, soul and bankroll of the nation's gun lobby, is digging in
for a test of its vaunted political power amid rising pressure to
curb sales of assault weapons.
   ``When less than half the convicted felons ever spend a day in
jail, why should we be taking firearms away from law-abiding
people?'' declares James Jay Baker, federal affairs director for
the 118-year old NRA.
   Demands for restrictions on military-style, semiautomatic
firearms are escalating, however, in the aftermath of the Stockton,
Calif., schoolyard tragedy Jan. 17 in which a deranged gunman with
an assault rifle left five youngsters dead and 30 other persons
injured.
   So intense is the clamor that, as often as the NRA has crushed
or blunted gun control bills in the past, many doubt that it can
prevail this time with its strategy of blaming the murder wave
sweeping cocaine-ridden communities not on firearms but ``our
crumbling criminal justice system.''

three-dimensional maps and nature trails are being developed to
help visitors understand how last year's forest fires were actually
useful.
   Space-age techniques went into the production of some of the
interpretive projects, which were considered nine months ago when
fires began consuming what would eventually consume nearly half of
the 2.2 million-acre park.
   ``Around the first of July we began to realize that we were not
only confronted with an incredible history-making event in terms of
fire suppression, but with a virtually unprecedented educational
opportunity as well,'' said George Robinson, Yellowstone's chief
naturalist.
   Forestry officials say the fires prompt rebirth in the
wilderness, clearing away the old, dead and overgrown while making
way for new vegetation and new wildlife habitats.

   Boris N. Yeltsin completed a stunning political
comeback with his landslide victory over a candidate who symbolized
power and prestige.
   Yet, his broad base of political support translates to little
real power in his bid to challenge the government and the Communist
Party bureaucracy.
   Yeltsin rolled up more than 89 percent of the vote to defeat
technocrat Yevgeny Brakov for a seat representing all of Moscow in
Sunday's first multicandidate national balloting in 70 years of
Soviet power. Together with the defeats of high-ranking officials
in other areas of the country, it is a warning of popular
discontent with entrenched officials and their privileges.
   The victory restored the burly, 58-year-old Sverdlovsk native to
a place of prominence in Moscow, giving the onetime protege of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev a parliamentary seat representing
the city he used to run as Communist Party chief.

   The massive oil spill that threatens waterfowl
and fish off the Alaska coast is expected to give ammunition to
environmentalists fighting to keep oil developers out of a pristine
arctic wildlife refuge.
   Congress must approve oil exploration in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska where the petroleum industry
believes much oil is hidden.
   President Bush endorsed oil drilling along a 1.5 million acre
coastal strip of the refuge if it can be done within environmental
guidelines, and legislation allowing exploration passed a Senate
committee earlier this month.
   But aides for senators on both sides of the issue suggested
Monday that the momentum is likely to slow considerably in light of
the accident involving the tanker Exxon Valdez and the oil spill in
the environmentally sensitive Prince William Sound.

   The Supreme Court was urged Monday to find a

death penalty for all juvenile murderers.
   ``There is a consensus of opinion in this country against
executing our young,'' argued attorney Nancy McKerrow in behalf of
a Missouri death row inmate condemned for a murder he committed
when he was 16.
   But questions from the bench during two hours of arguments in
cases from Missouri and Kentucky suggested the justices doubt that
any clear consensus exists.
   The high court is to decide by July whether imposing the death
penalty on murderers who committed their crimes before reaching the
age of 18 represents the ``cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by
the Constitution's Eighth Amendment.

   The nation's worst nuclear accident occurred when a series of

molten material raced to the bottom of the reactor before it was
held in check by a remaining pool of water. Radioactive gas was

   Policy-makers at the Federal Reserve, sifting
through murky economic data, probably will not tighten credit
further this week but will indicate they stand ready to push
interest rates higher if inflationary pressures do not abate soon,
private economists predicted Monday.
   The central bank, facing growing political pressure over fears
of a possible recession, is likely to postpone further credit
tightening for the time being at a meeting this week, many
economists believe, although they expect this respite will be brief.
   Most analysts are forecasting that a variety of interest rates,
including banks' prime lending rate and mortgage rates, will be
headed higher in the months ahead as the Fed struggles to keep
inflation from getting out of control.
   So far this year, inflation at the wholesale level has been
racing ahead at an alarming annual rate of 12.6 percent, and
consumer prices have been rising at a slower, but still
troublesome, annual rate of 6.1 percent, up sharply from the 4.4
percent increase in consumer prices turned in during the past two
years.

   The improving U.S. trade deficit, the biggest
factor promoting domestic growth last year, is on the verge of
stalling out unless the Bush administration moves quickly to
devalue the dollar and reach a budget agreement with Congress, a
research institute warned Monday.
   The Institute for International Economics said that unless the
United States is able to get its trade problems under control, the
country faces the threat of a recession, triggered by the flight of
foreigners from U.S. investments.
   There is also a danger that rising trade deficit would force
Congress and the administration to erect protectionist trade
barriers that would threaten a global trade war, according to the
study, ``American Trade Adjustment: the Global Impact.''
   The report said without needed policy changes, America's trade
deficit will begin rising again in 1990 and by 1992 will surpass
the record imbalance of $154 billion set in 1987.

   Call it a reluctance to work on
windswept rooftops, knead dough at four o'clock in the morning or
get dirty installing furnaces.
   Whatever the reasons, West Germany is facing a serious shortage
of young people interested in skilled manual labor.
   The situation has become so serious that the federal government
in Bonn is calling on ethnic German immigrants and women to apply
for the jobs. At the same time, it is urging some students to look
to skilled manual labor instead of universities, which are
overflowing.
   At a recent manual labor trade fair in Kassel, about 110 miles
north of Frankfurt, construction worker Friedrick Baum, 64,
explained what the long-range effects of the trainee shortage might
be in his trade.
   ``Our generation was the one that rebuilt the country after the
war,'' he said. ``Sometimes when I look back I can't believe what
we accomplished.
   ``Now, with many of us getting ready to retire, and not enough
apprentices to train, we're facing an experience gap that will get
worse over the next 10 years.''
   Education Minister Juergen Moellemann has proposed that the
government increase its annual spending on the training of
specialists in labor and technical fields by the equivalent of $216
million to $1.3 billion.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently told the Rhineland Palatinate
state Labor Chamber that it should fill the trainee gap with women
or young ethnic German immigrants from countries in Eastern Europe.
   ``This would not only signal solidarity with our own people and
help them,'' he said. ``It can be an enrichment to take on these
people, who often show an especially high motivation for work.''
   Some old-timers in the country's 126 trades classified as manual
labor say West German young people today want only white collar
jobs.
   Federal Labor Office figures for January indicated that 2.3
million West Germans were unemployed, but that only 92,402 of the
jobless were youths or new trainee prospects.
   With so few prospects, employers say that finding manual labor
trainees is difficult.
   Helmut Gress, who runs a plumbing and heating company in
Koenigstein, about 20 miles north of Frankfurt, says he has been
trying for two years to find an apprentice.
   ``There just doesn't seem to be anyone interested,'' he said.
``I think they see the work as too hard and sometimes dirty.''
   Hannelore Eckes, 50, who with her husband Horst operates a
bakery in the same town, said their search for a trainee has been
fruitless.
   ``We've tried to find either a young woman or man since the end
of the last school year. But no one wants to do manual work
anymore. Part of it is because our day starts at 4 a.m., and we
work half days on Saturday.''
   At the Kassel trade fair, Guenter Griehs, a 65-year-old retired
welder, manned a booth advertising for young people to get into the
welding business.
   ``It's not like it was when I became an apprentice,'' he said.
``In those days we were encouraged and proud to become master
tradesmen.
   ``Parents and schools are partly at fault because they push
children to keep studying for office work and computers rather than
work with their hands.''
   He said industries, such as automakers, hire away many young
people with starting salaries as high as $550 a month, while most
apprentices in manual trades average $190 to $375 a month.
   Karl Weinhold, 57, a senior construction worker at another booth
at the fair, said the building industry has its own special
problems that discourage youth.
   ``When you move heavy stones around to build houses from age 16
on, by the time you're 45 your spine is so worn out you can't walk
straight anymore. The young know this.''

   The night is dark and dismal on Dresdener Street.
Suddenly, bizarre lights and music burst from a rusty old vending
machine as miniature monsters stare sinisterly from inside.
   No, this is not ``The Twilight Zone.''
   It's the ``Blumenautomat Galerie,'' where a few coins buy
strange, tiny sculptures created by Georg Glueckman and Suwan
Laimanee, and a show that keeps fans coming back for more.
   In its previous life, the ``Blumenautomat Galerie'' (Flower
Automat Gallery) was an after-hours vending machine that dispensed
posies to passers-by.
   But now it is one of the most talked about multimedia art events
in Europe, pulling its creators out of years of obscurity.
   Glueckman and Laimanee came up with the idea as an alternative
means of promoting their modernistic concept of art, and say it is
Europe's only 24-hour art gallery.
   ``This is not what you would call a conventional exhibition.
It's not what you would call a normal thing,''' acknowledged the
wry, 37-year-old Laimanee, who is originally from Thailand.
   The man-size automat is bolted to a wall on dimly lighted
Dresdener Street, a cul-de-sac in one of the poorest sections of
West Berlin. Placed inside the machine's 12 compartments are
toy-like creations made by Laimanee and Glueckman at the
made-to-sell price of about $3.80 each.
   The Flower Automat Gallery is a humble but eerie-looking
machine. Indeed, sometimes it seems to have a life of its own.
   Laimanee deposits coins and pulls a bug-eyed monster sculpture
from one of the compartments. The left-hand side of the rusty
machine bursts into a brilliant light show, to the accompaniment of
strange music put together by Laimanee and Glueckman on a tape
recorder. Two minutes later, the show is over and the vending
machine has returned to a state of repose.
   ``Our Flower Automat Gallery is really a work of art in
itself,'' said Laimanee.
   Every four weeks the artists change the miniature creations and
play host for the premiere of a new show. Laimanee also has to fill
up the machine every day because of the great public demand.
   The Flower Automat Gallery has captured the curiousity of arts
enthusiasts across Europe. Articles have been written by the
Munich-based New Art in Europe magazine, West Germany's respected
Die Zeit weekly newspaper and other publications. Laimanee and
Glueckman have been interviewed in television programs that have
reached audiences from Belgium to Austria.
   Their fame last year resulted in an invitation to show their
larger works _ creations known as ``room installations'' _ in
Warsaw, Poland.
   For years, Laimanee and Glueckman took the traditional route of
displaying their larger works in rented Berlin rooms.
   Their break came in 1987 when they noticed the flower vending
machine across the street from the up-and-coming Zwinger Art
Gallery. They picked up the automat free of charge from a flower
shop that no longer used it.
   The Flower Automat Gallery was an immediate success when it
opened in October 1987, thriving on the ready market of curious
patrons of the Zwinger Gallery.
   ``It's not big money and we're not getting rich, but we can pay
our bills,'' Laimanee said.

<TEXT>
   As a Rhodesian soldier, Bruce Moore-King
believed the good were white, the evil were black and the war he
fought was a noble struggle waged in the name of Christian
democracy.
   A decade later, he is convinced the war to prevent black
majority rule was immoral and looks back with shame at how he and
thousands of other white Rhodesians accepted ``simplistic,
jingoistic nonsense'' from their leaders.
   Far worse, he says his fellow whites still hold blacks in
contempt and he fears they are throwing away their last chance for
peace in the land now called Zimbabwe.
   Once a member of an elite counterguerrilla force, the Grey
Scouts, Moore-King has written the first published reproval of the
seven-year war by a former supporter of white rule.
   In ``White Man Black War,'' Moore-King accuses the leaders _
``Elders,'' he calls them _ in what was the breakaway British
colony of Rhodesia of an inflexibility that led to the deaths of
1,400 whites and 27,000 blacks before the white minority gave up
power under British pressure in 1978.
   ``These Elders valued the comfort of their lifestyles beyond the
lives of their children,'' Moore-King writes in the book published
by Zimbabwe's year-old Baobab Books. ``It was greed that sent us to
war.''
   The 134-page volume has caused a stir among blacks and whites
who fought or lived through the conflict that ended with Rhodesia's
transition to independent, black-governed Zimbabwe. It provoked
numerous reviews in the local media, with one white lawyer saying
the book ``was like peeling a scab off and seeing how well the
wound was healing.''
   Moore-King's unforgiving and brutal accounts of war atrocities
form the basis of his scathing indictment of Rhodesia's leaders. He
particularly assails Ian Smith, the prime minister of Rhodesia,
calling him the whites' ``High Priest.''
   ``Mr. Smith, along with the farmers, businessmen, and other
politicians told us that we were not fighting to persecute,
oppress, or deny our black countrymen _ we killed and burned to
save them from communism,'' Moore-King writes.
   ``The shameful part of our history is not that we were wrong,
just that we were so childishly thoughtless,'' Moore-King said in
an interview at his modest home in Ruwa, about 20 miles east of
Harare (formerly Salisbury), the capital. The house is off a dirt
road surrounded by African bush and black neighbors.
   Moore-King, 36, said the book, published in December and now
into its second printing, was born of anger and fear he felt after
returning to his homeland in 1985 after a seven-year absence.
   ``I feared the whites in this country were screwing up the
opportunity to live in this land,'' he said. ``They have been given
a second chance in a way.''
   An estimated 90,000 whites remain in Zimbabwe out of the 250,000
or so in the early 1970s.
   ``The irony is that having lost the war, we haven't lost the
lifestyle,'' Moore-King added.
   Most whites in Zimbabwe live in spacious homes, many with
swimming pools and tennis courts and cared for by black servants.
   Smith, who still lives in Zimbabwe, said he does not intend to
read ``White Man Black War'' and dismissed Moore-King as a
``crank.''
   ``It seems at one time he was a great Grey Scout,'' said Smith
in a telephone interview. ``Now he's turned against everything he
once believed.''
   Moore-King, who is bearded, broad and imposingly tall, was a
sergeant in the Grey Scouts, a mounted infantry unit used as a
mobile fireforce and specializing in high-speed tracking.
   In flowing, impressionistic style, his book recounts wanton
destruction, torture and pointless massacres.
   Soldiers mistakenly bomb a schoolhouse in which black civilians
have taken refuge, and 123 are killed. A ``nanny and two pics''
walking home late at night are gunned down by inexperienced young
soldiers who mistake them for guerrillas. A black man hangs
spreadeagled on a steel bed-frame while a soldier sends electric
jolts through wires attached to his scrotum and a nipple.
   Moore-King left Rhodesia in 1978 and wandered around Europe for
several years, still believing the war was a noble affair.
   ``I swore I wasn't a racist and justified it by saying I didn't
hate black people, they just weren't ready for independence,'' he
said.
   Moore-King's attitude began to shift when he went to South
Africa in the early 1980s and worked at an insurance agency on an
equal basis with blacks.
   When he returned to Zimbabwe upon the death of his parents he
feared retaliation by the black government. Instead, he said, he
was welcomed back by blacks who treated him with respect.
   But he found attitudes little changed among whites.
   In his book, Moore-King tells of a moment soon after his return
when his landlord found him sharing tea on his porch with a black
neighbor. Not only were Moore-King and his wife evicted, but the
landlord locked the vegetable garden Moore-King had left to his
black friend. The book paints the pitiful scene of the hungry black
man looking longingly through a fence at tomatoes rotting on the
vine.
   ``It was one of a number of things that I thought were repugnant
morally, but also dangerous and stupid the way anger was being
stirred up in blacks,'' said Moore-King, who plans soon to leave
his job as a Harare insurance agent to work on his second book.
   ``I can understand now why our countrymen took up arms against
us,'' he wrote in his first book. ``And if these actions and
attitudes and forms of selective ignorance displayed by my tribe
once caused blood and fire to spread across the land called
Rhodesia, what will these same actions and attitudes and forms of
selective ignorance produce in this land called Zimbabwe?''

<HEAD>Traveling in Albania, Europe's Last Adventure</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Land of Albania! ... thou rugged nurse
of savage men,'' wrote Lord Byron, perhaps Albania's most famous
literary tourist.
   Albanians have changed since he visited in the early 18th
century, but being a tourist in Europe's most isolated country
still is an adventure for outsiders.
   Whether arriving at Tirana's bumpy airport, touring the
picturesque countryside or lounging on the marvelous beaches, a
traveler seems constantly surrounded by the same faces: Albania's
ever-present secret police, the Sigurimi, keep an eye on all
foreigners.
   Traffic on the winding, narrow roads is almost nonexistent, with
only the occasional truck or horse-drawn cart bumping along in the
dust.
   That's probably why Albanian drivers have an unnerving tendency
not to worry so much about sharp curves, to the horror of their
foreign passengers.
   ``But what if we run into Albania's other bus,'' a foreigner on
a tourist bus joked, eliciting a sour glance from the Albanian
driver.
   The wild and jagged mountains of Albania's interior offer
breathtaking views of forests and streams in deep precipices, while
the few and scattered villages are surrounded by carefully tended
terraced fields.
   In the countryside, only women are seen tilling the communal
fields and small plots each family has been allotted in an apparent
attempt to increase food supplies.
   The long, sandy beaches and the lack of crowds make Albania's
Adriatic seaside resorts a far cry from Europe's crowded summer
retreats, although one is apt to run into the ever-present men in
dark suits and sunglasses among the bathers.
   Since World War II, Albania has been sealed off by the harshest
Communist regime in Europe.
   The isolationism and fear of the outside world is exemplified by
the thousands of empty bunkers in the countryside and on beaches.
   The weapon slits in the bunkers are mostly bricked over now that
Albania has decided it does not have to be on the alert against
invasion.
   But moonlight dips in the sea are strictly forbidden, and police
patrol the beaches, apparently to discourage citizens from swimming
off to the nearby Greek island of Corfu or to the foreign ships
riding at anchor.
   Visitors are often lodged in hotels built by the Italians when
they ruled Albania before or during World War II. Most of the
furniture and fittings in the Adriatic Hotel in Durres appear to be
left over from that period.
   Lodging comes moderately expensive for foreigners _ 280 lekas
($40) a day for the room only.
   Albania closed its borders with Greece and Yugoslavia in the
1940s, and ordinary Albanians are forbidden to travel abroad. The
10,000 foreign tourists who come annually are restricted to
organized group travel.
   No Americans are allowed, however, since the United States is
still considered Albania's foremost enemy. Most of the tourists are
from Italy, West Germany and Britain.
   There is very little to do in the evenings, since nightlife as
it is known in the West is nonexistent, and the primary
entertainment for Albanians is to watch television programs from
Yugoslavia, Italy and Greece.
   Albanians used to hide TV antennas under the rooftops of their
homes. When the Communist leader Enver Hoxha died in 1985, after a
41-year rule, citizens gradually became bolder and put them outside
for better reception.
   Forests of antennas now sprout from decrepit concrete apartment
blocks where most Albanians live.
   Few women are seen on the streets of towns. There are fewer cars
and no pets. Food is not plentiful in Albania, and citizens choose
not to waste it on dogs and cats.

   Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas, noted for
their hip, urban comedies, have turned to the soil for their newest
series, CBS' ``Heartland.''
   ``Heartland'' may be the first television comedy to milk laughs
from farm folk without portraying them as ``aw-shucks'' hayseeds.
   ``This is from an idea that's been percolating for a while,''
said Witt. ``We started a long time ago with the idea that the farm
is the last of the family businesses. And although the American
family farms are disappearing, the people running them are some of
the most clever and inventive people in business. People on farms
are now sophisticated and no longer culturally isolated.
   ``Rather than the images we were raised with, we wanted to
portray them as the last vestige of the Connecticut Yankee. Farming
is a complex business that requires you to be mechanic,
veterinarian, agronomist and many other things all at once. In
talking to farmers we found that it was laughter that helped them
get through the hard times.''
   ``Heartland,'' which made its debut on March 20, stars Brian
Keith, Richard Gilliland, Kathleen Layman, Jason Kristofer, Devin
Ratray and Daisy Keith as a family living in Nebraska. It was
created by Don Reo.
   The Family Farm Coalition has urged its 42 organizations in 35
states to ask its members to watch the show.
   Other Witt-Thomas shows are ``The Golden Girls,'' ``Empty Nest''
and ``Beauty and the Beast.''
   Keith, starring in his seventh series, portrays family patriarch
B.L. McCutcheon. McCutcheon is outspoken and cantankerous, two
characteristics Keith virtually holds a patent on. He's lost his
own farm and lives with his daughter and son-in-law. Daisy Keith,
who plays McCutcheon's granddaughter, is Keith's real-life daughter.
   ``That allows us to play to a very primal conflict,'' said Witt.
``Very few fathers ever believe that their son-in-law is worthy of
their daughter. That's a great source of comedy and conflict.
There's little that they agree on, from raising children to farming
to politics.''
   Both Witt and Thomas agreed that it was hard to launch a show
with only six episodes on a third-place network. ``It's tough to
get sampling at any time, and it's especially tough to get the
audience to sample a show with only six episodes,'' said Witt.
``The phrase we use is, `it's tough to hit the green.'''
   Partners since 1976, Witt and Thomas have produced such shows as
``Soap,'' ``Benson,'' ``It Takes Two '' ``Hail To the Chief'' and
``I'm a Big Girl Now.'' In the past, both worked for Danny Thomas
Productions and Spelling-Goldberg Productions.
   Thomas is the son of entertainer Danny Thomas. Witt is married
to writer-producer Susan Harris, who created ``Soap'' and ``The
Golden Girls.''
   ``Bureaucracy is the enemy of comedy,'' said Thomas, who wants
to keep the company small. ``Most major studios haven't been as
successful as the independent producers with comedy.''
   The Witt-Thomas show ``Beauty and the Beast'' was a big risk for
the producers. A one-hour show is a financial burden for an
independent producer, because the network licensing fee does not
cover all the costs.
   Witt said ``Beauty and the Beast'' was hurt by the writers'
strike, which delayed its fall premiere to Nov. 19, and by its
temporary move from Friday to Monday nights.
   The concept of a noble, heroic man-beast living underground in
New York could easily have turned out corny without the right
execution.
   ``It's an epic love story,'' said Witt. ``It's also very
literate and stylized. The people read Shakespeare and poems. It
was a risk creatively and financially. It's still not profitable.
But every once in a while you find something you want to do because
you like it.''

that something very special has gone out of our culture,'' Fleisher
said.

<HEAD>On Hostages, Business as Usual Means Wait</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terry Anderson is two weeks into his fifth
year as a hostage in Beirut and business is proceeding about as
usual, which means that none is evident.
   For the hostages, business as usual means only waiting.
   Now that the four-year anniversary observances are over, the
hostage issue is back on the back burner, an agonizing, frustrating
riddle in which nine Americans are held captive and silent by
Moslem extremists who are themselves silent most of the time.
   After a Capitol Hill ceremony on the Anderson anniversary date,
March 16, there were going to be yellow ribbons on display around
Congress, and a resolution seeking action to end the hostage
ordeal, although no specific step was or could be proposed.
   Neither ribbons nor resolutions are in evidence. Not that they
would change the situation, but it has dragged now to the point at
which symbols become substitutes for acts no one has been able to
devise.
   President Bush suggested as he took office two months ago that
moves by Iran to assist the hostages, to establish contact and help
gain their release, would be a significant step toward a time of
better relations with the United States.
   There was no response. He has said no more on the subject.
   That is the standstill into which Jesse Jackson now proposes to
move with a renewed humanitarian campaign for the release of
foreign hostages in Lebanon. Fifteen are known to be held, nine of
them Americans.
   Jackson said they shouldn't be left out of mind because they are
out of sight.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, has been held longer than any other hostage. He and Jackson
became acquainted when Anderson covered the release of Navy Lt.
Robert O Goodman, a downed flier held for a month by the Syrians.
Jackson went to Damascus to appeal for Goodman's release and to
escort him home.
   He said he would go back to the Middle East now to work for the
release of Anderson and the others if he had leads, contacts and
indications such a mission would help.
   First, he said, there should be a humanitarian appeal in
messages on radio, on television and in Lebanese newspaper
advertisements. He said he is looking for sponsors to finance that
effort.
   ``In Lebanon, the captors are basically nameless and faceless,''
he said in an interview at his Chicago headquarters. ``Therefore
the appeal has to be a broad-based appeal to religious and
political leaders and others who care.''
   The black civil rights activist and two-time Democratic
presidential candidate said such appeals were making headway and
might have succeeded in 1985, but were undercut by the
administration's arms deals with Iran.
   Two American hostages were freed during the arms dealings.
   Jackson invited the interview on his projected renewal of public
appeals in Lebanon for release of the hostages. He said private
appeals can work. ``We should not interfere with the government in
its efforts,'' Jackson said. ``But the government's efforts are
both modest and ineffective.''
   He acknowledged that he doesn't know what efforts the new
administration is planning or making for the hostages.
   Humanitarian appeals have been made before, and have failed
before. Indeed, one of the men who made them, Terry Waite, envoy of
the archbishop of Canterbury, was himself kidnapped on Jan. 20,
1987, and remains hostage.
   The captors, after all, are no humanitarians.
   But Jackson said they cannot operate without the tacit support,
or at least acquiescence, of the society around them.
   ``We want to put the focus again back on the captured as well as
on the basic agony of the captors,'' he said. ``We need to have
those holding the hostages know that Americans are concerned about
the rebuilding of Lebanon, about the children in the camps, about
the invasions and the bombings.
   ``We are concerned about that. So was Terry.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a time when the French are trying to whip up
enthusiasm for the 200th anniversary of their Revolution, visitors
will be treated to an American exhibition in Galeries Lafayette,
France's best-known department store.
   A major art exhibition will form the backbone of the show in the
Paris store, which also includes a Tex-Mex restaurant, a
demonstration of Navajo arts and crafts and phone booths offering
free three-minute phone calls to the United States.
   The exhibition might be dubbed the biggest ``show and sell,''
gambit ever attempted in France because it's also a commercial
enterprise aimed at selling thousands of items ``made in the
U.S.A.''
   ``We feel the United States was the most obvious choice for our
annual show devoted to a foreign country,'' said Jean-Michel
Girardin, director of promotions and sales.
   He pointed out that people in both countries battled for liberty
in the late l8th century, and that the Marquis de Lafayette, a
French statesman, had championed the American patriots' cause as a
general under George Washington in the American Revolutionary War.
   Lafayette's gesture was viewed suspiciously by the French, who
first condemned him but finally welcomed him back as a hero in 1781
when they saw how he'd defeated their arch-enemies, the English.
   The exhibition of 50 American paintings from the Wadsworth
Atheneum in Hartford, Conn., is the most important such show
sponsored by a retailer in France.
   ``Chosen by the museum's curator, Patrick McCaughy, the
paintings will cover the chief periods of art in America,'' said
Georges Meyer, chairman of Galeries Lafayette.
   Insured for $50 million, the canvases will range from the works
of the scenic Hudson River School to the abstract expressionism of
Jackson Pollock and the pop art of Andy Warhol.
   Also on show will be Whistler's ``Coast of Brittany,'' as well
as Winslow Homer's ``Boy in a Dory,'' Georgia O'Keeffe's upside
down painting of D.H. Lawrence's pine tree and an impressionistic
landscape of Etretat, a beach in Normandy, by George Inness.
   ``This will be a new kind of audience for an art show,'' said
Girardin, intimating that these casual visitors would have fewer
preconceived ideas than the usual culture vultures at art
exhibitions.
   Bound to be a crowd-pleaser are 16 vintage cars contributed by
Ford Motor Co. to be placed on the rooftop terrace. Long queues are
expected for the first week of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Corp. phone-booth exhibit, when free phone calls to the United
States will be offered from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. as part of a
credit-card promotion.
   Navajos from Santa Fe, N.M., will be on hand in their
workshop-boutique to demonstrate how they weave rugs, make pottery
and silver jewelry. And elsewhere, professional seamstresses will
demonstrate the fine art of making a quilt.
   Skateboard demonstrations by Californians are expected to knock
'em off their feet, if the Harley-Davidson motorcycle exhibit
doesn't first.
   And a French cactus buff will show off new breeds of the prickly
succulent.
   While the Rio Grande restaurant from Paris' Les Halles district
serves up chili con carne, gastronomes may also sample treats at
the ``typically American'' food shop. The eclectic food selection
will either fascinate Gallic gourmets or send them galloping away
in droves: frozen yogurt, pop corn, diet products, biologic food
products, wine without alcohol and Kentucky bourbon for kicks.
   The Hamilton Beach Co. was to contribute cookery items
considered ``indispensable to the American way of life'' including
a corn popper, a milk-shaker, a dough-kneader and a hot dog cooker.
   Fashions, home furnishings, accessories and leisure products
will complete the vast show. Designer styles will be from
Paris-based Patrick Kelly, Ralph Lauren, Betsy Johnson, Tahari,
Charlotte Neuville and Leon Max.
   French couture will make a cameo appearance on about 20 models
fashioned by top designers for Barbie dolls.
   The Saks boutique will not only show and sell red-white-blue
socks and beach robes, but offer chocolate cake and Bloody Marys to
cheer the weary.
   In a more sedate vein, New York's Museum of Modern Art will have
a gift shop of museum copies.
   With all this American razzle-dazzle, what does the French store
expect to be the biggest sensation?
   ``Well, maybe some of that naughty underwear the Californians
are going to show,'' said Girardin. ``It may be like taking coals
to Newcastle, but I've never seen any worse even up in our
red-light district, Pigalle.''
   Similar shows in 14 branches around the country will take place
at the same time, from March 29 to April 30.

<TEXT>
   Chinese students are flocking to Japan as language
students, but many come only for the big money they can earn _ 20
times wages at home _ in jobs outside the classroom, immigration
officials say.
   Some come in hopes of eventually getting to the United States.
   Many fall victim to unscrupulous language schools that charge
inflated fees for bogus study programs and introductions to the
Japanese sponsors they need for visas.
   Foreign students in Japan are allowed to earn the equivalent of
$1,000 a month, a fortune by Chinese standards.
   Last year, 28,256 Chinese entered Japan to study Japanese, up
from 1,199 in 1985, the Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau says.
   Many, if not most, use the language study as a pretense to get
into Japan. Only about 1,600 Chinese students came last year to
pursue formal studies, from literature to management, at regular
universities and graduate schools. They don't fall into category of
those who come mainly to work.
   The flood came after Japan changed immigration rules in 1987 to
permit language students to work as much as 20 hours a week.
   ``The Chinese come because they hear they can earn 2 million yen
($16,000) in two years,'' said immigration spokesman Sadao Kawakita.
   ``The schools are vastly overbooking. In January we cracked down
on 23 schools with a capacity of 5,000 that had accepted
applications _ and fees _ from 15,000 Chinese who now won't get
visas.''
   The schools were ordered to restructure by July. One, which
issed phony sponsorship papers, was closed down.
   Today 38,000 Chinese in Shanghai alone are waiting for Japanese
visas. In December, thousands rallied at Japan's Consulate in
Shanghai demanding visas for which they had paid brokers and
protesting stricter rules on guarantors.
   Japan requires that foreign students have guarantors _ Japanese
with an annual salary of at least 5 million yen ($40,000) who vouch
for the students' conduct and financial well-being.
   Finding guarantors has become a big business, with student
brokers borrowing or sometimes inventing names they ``sell'' to
Chinese desperate for a visa.
   ``I paid a Hong Kong `visa broker' 2,700 U.S. dollars to find me
a guarantor,'' said a 21-year-old electrician who identified
himself only as Zhou. He had to borrow virtually all of it, he
said, so he works 56 hours a week _ in violation of immigration
rules _ at a restuarant and sends home 80,000 yen ($640) monthly.
Tuition averages 30,000 yen ($240) a month.
   Most Chinese language students work as day laborers or in
restaurants, bars and small factories.
   Wu Zizhong, 27, works six days a week at a small printing
factory for 600 yen ($4.80) an hour, standard for Japan. He also
works some nights sorting letters until dawn at a post office where
about 100 other Chinese work part time for 1,000 yen ($8) an hour.
He said he takes naps in Japanese class and during breaks at the
printing plant.
   He and others also violate the 20-hour immigration rule.
Violators generally get away with it because the students often
work in more than one place and pay no taxes, making it difficult
for authorities to keep track of them.
   A radio technician from Shanghai named Shen says he saves 50,000
yen ($400) a month and wants to bring his girlfriend to Japan and
then try to go to the United States.
   Shen paid 90,000 yen ($720) to his school _ one of the 23 that
were disciplined _ to find his girlfriend a guarantor.
   ``Now they can't do it, and I don't think I'll see that money
again,'' he said.
   Like Shen, many Chinese dream fervently of going to the United
States, and some make it, usually if they have relatives there.
Others go to great lengths trying.
   ``We get dozens of Chinese every day seeking permanent
residence,'' said a consular officer at the Bolivian Embassy in
Tokyo. ``But I don't think they even know where Bolivia is. They
somehow have this idea that this is how they can get to America.''
   But one woman from Beijing, who works nights as a club hostess,
said she had a different goal.
   ``I want so much to go to college. But in China I can't, I'm too
old,'' she said. ``I don't really like Japanese or Japan, but I had
no chance to go anywhere else.''

<HEAD>More West German Youths Opt Out of Military Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOGNE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The war veterans at the Riehler
Home for the Aged tend to get more riled up about the earrings and
tiger-striped pants worn by ``civvies'' than the fact that the
young men have refused military service.
   Civvies, or civilian servants, are conscientious objectors who
opt for their constitutional right to reject military service and
work instead in the most menial of health care and manual labor
jobs.
   Amid an increasingly tolerant West German public and an imminent
lengthening of both military and civilian service terms, the number
of young men filing for conscientious objector status has climbed
dramatically in recent months.
   The pacifist corps grew by more than 22 percent last year alone,
swelling the force to a record 85,000 and rekindling worries among
some labor union officials that the civvies who earn only about 300
marks ($160) a month will take jobs away from regular workers.
   On the whole, however, civvies are finding widespread acceptance
among their countrymen.
   ``We have occasional problems between the conservative older
residents and the Civilian Service workers, but it is more often an
objection about the kind of clothes they wear than their moral or
political views,'' observed Josef Gerlach, a psychologist in charge
of care for the 1,200 residents of the Riehler home, the nation's
largest facility for the elderly.
   ``The residents are actually more likely to lash out at each
other, calling this or that one an old Nazi.''
   Civvies like 24-year-old Gerd Daassen, who has been feeding,
bathing and cleaning up residents at the Riehler home since
October, confirm that their decisions against bearing arms stir
little hostility.
   ``A lot of them ask me why I am doing this instead of serving in
the army,'' Daasaen said during a break. ``But it seems to be more
a curiosity than a judgment. When I tell them that I cannot kill
another man, and therefore have to reject military service, they
seem to understand.''
   Peter Hintze, federal commissioner for the Civilian Service,
said in an interview at his Bonn office that he considers the broad
acceptance of conscientious objection in West Germany ``a sign of a
healthy and mature society.''
   ``In the 1960s, the public reaction was very negative. The
phrase used then for civilian servants was `shirker','' said
Hintze, a former Anglican minister. ``In the 1970s, there was
mostly skepticism, `Who are these guys?' people wondered. But now,
as the 1980s draw to a close, the choice of civilian service is
broadly accepted.''
   The pacifist trend among West Germans began abruptly in 1968, a
year of widespread student protests against militarism and a time
of anxiety over the Vietnam War.
   Refusal to bear arms has grown steadily ever since.
   Hintze and his adviser, Achim Schmidt, attribute most of the
sharp rise in civilian service entries over the past year to the
Defense Ministry's plan to lengthen the obligatory army service
from 15 to 18 months beginning in June.
   The civilian service term now is 20 months but will be extended
to two years after June.
   ``The willingness to serve longer demonstrates commitment to the
alternative service,'' said Hintze, a civvie himself in the 1970s.
   Civvies serve longer because they often can find positions in
their own communities, while soldiers have to wear uniforms, put in
longer hours and live away from home.
   All West German men reaching the age of 18 are obligated to
register for military service, but education deferments are easily
obtained.
   Hintze said the percentage of military draftees refusing army
service has grown steadily over the past two decades to about 12
percent. That figure is significantly larger than in neighboring
countries, where usually less than 1 percent called for service
refuse to bear arms.
   West Germans' acceptance of conscientious objectors can be
explained in part by the nation's tragic experience with war and
militarism during the first half of this century and its position
on the frontline with Eastern Europe.
   The nation's Basic Law, set down 40 years ago when the new
postwar West German state was formed, was the first constitution in
the world to grant citizens the right to chose an alternative to
military service.
   The civvies most often find jobs caring for the elderly and
handicapped, but they also get into fields like environmental
protection, zoo and park maintenance and search and rescue.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ As its 40th birthday approaches, West Germany
has lately shown itself to be a nation undergoing profound change.
Long viewed as an ideological twin of the United States, the nation
is now engaged in a flirtation with the Soviet Union that worries
its partners in the NATO alliance. All the while, there is the Nazi
specter and the fear that history could repeat itself.

   Historian Karl-Dietrich Bracher likes
to compare West Germany to a young man just out of college, shakive parents
and plunging headlong into a world full of
opportunity and danger.
   Youthfully ing
off protectvibrant and economically strong, West Germany has let
go of the apron strings of the United States, which gave it
political guidance and physical nourishment in the first hard years
of a statehood founded on the ruins of the Third Reich.
   Now engaged in a flirtation with the Kremlin that its elders in
the NATO alliance fear may be a naive or dangerous courtship, the
nation has been rebelling against the familial bounds of bloc
diplomacy and the burdens of a shared deGermans on both sides of the border
that reunification is still
possible. But West Germans concede the prospects are slim as time
heals the wound of separation and a new generation with no memory
of one Germany becomes the majority in both states.
   The future holds out little hope of improvement for East
Germans. The socialist leadership of Erich Honecker has failed to
embrace either the social or economic reforms championed by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Honecker maintains that a wholesale revamping of the type
Gorbachev espouses with his ``perestroika,'' or rebuilding project,
is unnecessary in East Germany because of his nation's relative
success among the socialist states.
   The 76-year-old Honecker, reported at times to be in ill health
but showing no signs of an intent to bow out as head of the
Socialist Unity Party, dismisses suggestions of a unified Germany
as an unrealistic refusal to deal with the political facts.
   He has also dashed hopes that East Germany in the age of
Gorbachev and glasnost might be willing to dismantle the Berlin
Wall that Western leaders have labeled an anachronism of the Cold
War.
   Responding to appeals during a recent Vienna human rights
conference that the wall be torn down, Honecker declared it would
stand another 50 or 100 years, as long as the differences dividing
East and West demand it.
   The wall was erected in 1961 to stop the flood of East Germans
seeking refuge in the West.
   ``Contrary to its intention, it is daily proof that the question
it tried to answer remains unanswered,'' West German President
Richard von Weizsaecker has said. ``It makes the idea of belonging
together conspicuous, an idea which it sought to make us forget.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a vast, enigmatic wilderness sitting
incongruously in the midst of the New York-Philadelphia
megalopolis, ringed by the urban sprawl that gave New Jersey a bad
name. With the creation of the Pinelands National Reserve a decade
ago, the 1 million-plus acres have been spared bulldozers running
rampant, much to the chagrin of some landowners.

   To the nature buff, New
Jersey's Pinelands are miles of pygmy pines, deep forest, creeks
and bogs.
   To romantics, the Pinelands might be symbolized by the Waretown
cabin where fiddler George Albert once played through the night, or
the general store in Chatsworth that still offers a table for
coffee and gossip.
   In folklore, it's the birthplace of the Jersey Devil, a place
where men live in caves and marry their sisters.
   But to some landowners, ``Pinelands'' is only a title, an
annoying federal designation that stifles development and profit.
   In reality, the more than 1.1 million acres comprising the
Pinelands in southern New Jersey are a unique medley of tremendous
historical and environmental significance.
   Ringed by the urban sprawl that gave New Jersey a bad name, the
region gained national recognition in November 1978 when President
Jimmy Carter signed the National Parks and Recreation Act that
included the creation of the Pinelands National Reserve.
   Carter's act stopped any talk of a supersonic jetport in the
middle of this vast space, a frightening prospect for an area
already being invaded by the rush of metropolitan housing
developers.
   Ten years ago, it seemed that nothing within two hours of New
York City would be left untouched.
   But the Pinelands reserve, the largest remaining open tract in
the mid-Atlantic states, was saved.
   In a unique arrangement, the state of New Jersey manages the
federal reserve, keeping large-scale development in outlying areas
and maintaining the undisturbed nature of thousands of acres in the
middle. The state, with federal financial help, is slowly buying
property to add to the total reserve, most of which is still
privately owned.
   The state Pinelands Commission now operates with a management
plan that is both commended and condemned. In addition, 56
municipalities within the Pinelands are involved in modifying their
master development plans to make them conform with the goals of the
protection effort.
   ``When the Pinelands plan developed, there had to be
accommodations, and some people were hurt and some people were
helped,'' says Pearl Schwartz of Toms River, a member of the Ocean
County Environmental Agency and the Ocean Nature Society.
   ``But the overall picture that has emerged in 10 years has been
on the side of good. We have been able to control growth, which is
not happening in the rest of the state.''
   More than 100 years ago, the parts of Atlantic, Burlington,
Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties that
are now the Pinelands made up a prosperous region filled with iron,
charcoal and glass industries utilizing the bountiful raw
materials. In later years, sawmills and wineries flourished.
   Today, only the names of Colonial-era villages remain, along
with remnants of the ``Piney'' lifestyle. Few still follow the
tradipine cones, clams and
sphagnum moss to live off the land.
   ``The Pinelands heritage is going to die off very soon,'' says
Kenneth Yates, a Tabernacle blueberry farmer who grew up among
generations of Pineys. ``We don't even have much of a historical
society anymore. The young people don't want to get involved.
   ``Older homes are getting torn down, because the younger
generation is not about to live primitive. And people are still
living in the woods, but with all the modern conveniences.''
   Some southern New Jersey natives are flattered to be called a
``Piney.'' But not others.
   ``A Piney is a three-headed incestuous idiot that can't walk or
talk,'' says Joe Horner, a member of a Pinelands band. ``We are
`indigenous' residents _ born here, raised here, growed up here and
will die here. Pineys are people who moved here from Brooklyn to
live off the land.''
   Russ Horner, picking on a guitar nearby, chimes in: ``The whole
thing is a hoax. The idea of people stumbling around the Pinelands
picking sphagnum moss for a living is nice, but it's not hardly
real anymore.''
   Horner points to his Uncle Joe, who builds wooden boats in
Waretown and was dubbed a ``Piney'' by newspaper reporters who
wrote about him and his craft.
   ``Joe turns out classic garveys made out of Atlantic white
cedar, but he ain't no Piney,'' Horner says.
   Ask Joe Reid himself, and he somewhat bashfully agrees.
   ``Growing up here, we didn't know this would ever be called `the
Pinelands,''' he says. ``We used to call it `back in the woods.'''
   Although the lifestyle may wane, action has been taken to
protect the Pinelands' physical attributes, which include a vast
underground aquifer, with an estimated 17 trillion gallons of pure
water, and rare cedar and pygmy pines. In 1983, the United Nations
designated the region an ``International Biosphere Reserve.''
   The Pinelands Management Plan protects a fragile core, and gets
increasingly less restrictive as it moves outward. Some areas are
designated for agriculture. Others are forest areas that permit
low-density residential and commercial development.
   Larger communities already within the reserve have been
classified as ``regional growth areas,'' where most future
development will concentrate.
   But the director of the state Pinelands Commission, Terrence
Moore, emphasizes that no part of the reserve will see any major
project, such as a toxic waste dump, that could taint the
environment.
   In the process of protecting such a vast tract in a rapidly
developing region, the state frustrated many landowners who faced
restrictions on their ability to use or profit from their property.

   Newsletters from the Pinelands Landowners Society accused the
state of ``trying to preserve land by essentially confiscating
it...Meanwhile, taxes continue to be paid by landowners held
hostage by the plan.''
   Researchers continue to study the Pinelands' fragile ecosystem,
right down to the rare Pine Barrens tree frog and the curly grass
fern.
   Medical research also has been conducted in the Pinelands. Last
year, Squibb Corp. microbiologists announced that a new family of
microbiotics could be developed from Pinelands soil.
   But for all the Pinelands' beauty and benefits, it is
overshadowed as a tourist destination by the popular shore region
and relatively few people take advantage of the reserve. Scattered
through the scenic Pinelands are attractions such as the historic
Batsto Village, a preserved iron-making facility, and a host of
hiking trails and rivers for canoeing.
   ``I don't think there is enough of an understanding in the state
as to what the Pinelands means and how important it is,'' Moore
says. ``Most people think it's just a boring, flat landscape.''
   Although the Pinelands' significance may not be widely and fully
appreciated, and its preservation fought by some, the Pinelands
Management Does Tanya have any advice for her sister?
   ``Stay in school and don't have kids until you finish school.''
   Samantha Jones, a 17-year-old graduate of Beach Channel High
School in Rockaway, says the pregnant teen-agers she knows ``really
don't understand that once that baby's born, it's going to be hard
to feed them and clothe them and take 'em places and stuff like
that. And that they can't really do the things that they used to
do.''
   But when asked if she used birth control, she said, ``Sometimes,
but not really. No. But I'm supposed to start on it soon. But not
now.''
   Katie Trieller, the clinical nurse specialist at Woodmere, says
that kind of carelessness is common among teen-agers of every
stripe.
   ``In the last five years, with the media talking about herpes
and AIDS, adults are being more careful about sex,'' she says.
``It's not affecting the adolescent population because they think
they're omnipotent. That's their modus operandi: `I'm not going to
get pregnant. I'm not going to get VD.'''
   Sharon Redman, the Valley Stream teen who learned the hard way
that she was not immune to pregnancy, laments her abortioo kill a baby,''
she says, ``but I
was only 17 at the time and still in school and I was working and
my boyfriend was still in school at the time, and his mother never
knew. She'd probably be upset if she ever found out.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The 20th edition of Dewey Decimal
Classification, which assigns numbers to library books, is due out
this year. It's a simple yet sophisticated system for organizing
the world's knowledge, a system that a child can quickly learn.
While it must be updated from time to time, some librarians
maintain that Dewey's system will ``stand for all time.''

   When Melvil Dewey envisioned how a library
should be organized more than a century ago, he couldn't have
guessed how his system would be tested in the future.
   He could hardly have foreseen in 1873, for example, the
invention of computers, or the spread of AIDS and advancements in
medical science such diseases engender.
   Or the high-speed, low-cost printing presses that turn out so
very many books each year. Since 1979, over a million volumes have
been assigned Dewey Decimal numbers.
   And with the publication this year of the 20th edition of
Dewey's revolutionary system _ the first complete update in a
decade _ just about the only constants of the Dewey Decimal
Classification are its basic structure and its publisher, Albany's
Forest Press.
   But that, after all, was Dewey's vision. The strength and
popularity of the system lie in its adaptability.
   From a slant toward subjects a white, middle-class American male
in the 19th century might study _ European literature, the Bible
and classical philosophy, Romance and Germanic languages, the
natural sciences and history _ the system has assimilated other
literatures and cultures to become the most popular method of
organizing libraries in the world.
   ``Dewey had definitely a white, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon bias.
Over the years, as other editors have worked on the Dewey, there
has been a constant effort to correct for this,'' says Arnold
Wajenberg, principal cataloger and professor of library
administration at the University of Illinois in Urbana.
   Wajenberg, who is also on the advisory committee which oversees
the Dewey's updates, adds, ``There is a very definite United States
bias, Western European bias which is especially damaging as it
becomes a worldwide classification.''
   Familiar to most grade school children, the Dewey Decimal system
is used to organize libraries so books can be found easily. And
reports written, languages learned, curiosity quenched.
   A book is assigned a number to the left of the decimal, placing
it in a general category. To the right of the decimal, it is
assigned numbers that describe the particular book. By adding or
subtracting numbers, a person can find other books on more specific
or general topics. New books can be squeezed into the library's
catalog in the same way.
   The system is sophisticated enough to catalog millions of
volumes and simple enough for a child to quickly learn. So simple
and sophisticated, in fact, that its editor, John Comaromi, says it
will ``stand for all time.''
   ``The thing is, it's powerful, it's really powerful,'' he says.
``It really fits human expression of ideas.''
   Comaromi is head of the Decimal Classification Division at the
Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., where the Dewey numbers
are actually assigned.
   Translated into 34 languages, from German to Gujarati, the Dewey
system is now used in 95 percent of the world's libraries.
   It stands in near-constant transition, with differences in the
two most recent editions illustrating its changing face.
   For example, work began on the 19th edition in 1972. When it was
published, in 1979, crack cocaine was unknown and there was little
published about drugs in general. But as the next decade passed,
information piled up and social attitudes changed, prompting major
changes in the 20th edition. AIDS had the same effect, with its
impact on epidemiology, biochemistry, even sociology, Comaromi says.
   The rapid rise of computer technology even prompted a separate,
between-editions edition, and will prompt future changes in the
system itself, as it is adapted for publication in computer form.
   ``We have this tension between stability in libraries and then
advancement and progress for people using the classification as the
window into knowledge, to the whole world of knowledge,'' Comaromi
says. ``If it's going to be a window into knowledge, it's got to be
current.''
   That's the sole purpose of Forest Press _ keeping the Dewey in
line with what's being published, says executive director Peter
Paulson.
   Paulson, like Melvil Dewey, is a former director of the New York
State Library, one of the first libraries to adopt the system.
   Dewey developed his system in 1873 while a student at Amherst
College in Massachusetts and worked on it the rest of his life.
   In 1911, after resigning his post and moving to Lake Placid,
N.Y., he founded Forest Press, housing it at the Lake Placid Club.
In the early 1970s, the press moved to Albany, and earlier this
year it was purchased by private information-systems giant OCLC of
Dublin, Ohio.
   Although there was at the time neither regular training for
librarians nor a widely used classification system, Dewey based his
system on others, such as the scheme created by former U.S.
Secretary of Education William Torrey Harris for the St. Louis
Public Library earlier in the 19th century.
   While about 200,000 libraries in more than 130 countries now use
the Dewey, other systems compete for attention. Many major research
libraries use the Library of Congress' scheme, the Soviet Union has
its own system, and the Universal Decimal Classification _ derived
in the 20th century from the Dewey _ is popular in Europe,
Wajenberg says. But the Dewey is king for now.
   Its real effectiveness can be seen every time an adult enters
the public library and finds it familiar, years after first
encountering the system. For, as Paulson sums up: ``This is a
system for organizing all the world's knowledge.''

   He's also found time recently for a role as Berthold, the
fastest man alive, in ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' and as
Passeportout, Phileas Fogg's woman-chasing, wine-bibbing French
valet, in the NBC miniseries ``Around the World in 80 Days.''
   In ``Nearly Departed,'' which makes its debut Monday, April 10,
he and Caroline McWilliams play spirits, only recently departed,
who try to dislodge the new occupants from their home.
   ``It's not polite comedy,'' he says. ``I seriously want those
people out of the house.''
   Idle was concerned with the lack of time available as he filmed
six episodes of ``Nearly Departed.''
   ``It takes twice as much time to do comedy,'' he says. ``They
don't give you enough lead time. The writer was reworking the
current script while he was writing the next week's script. I
didn't do any writing, but I'm allowed to rewrite and punch up. So
I put my bits in.''
   Idle plays an English lecturer at the University of Chicago who
is killed with his wife by falling rock while on vacation. Instead
of heaven or hell, they go back to Chicago to haunt their old home.
   ``Nearly Departed'' is an original series but the concept has
occasionally popped up in such past projects as ``Blythe Spirit''
and ``Topper.''
   ``You get a chance to comment on people right in front of them
and they can't hear you,'' Idle says. ``We haunt Stuart Pankin and
Wendy Schaal and their child, Jay Lambert. Only the grandfather,
Henderson Forsythe, can hear us.
   ``It's necessary to have someone you can communicate with or it
doesn't relate. You can't make the comedy work without that.''
   Idle was in the forefront of British television's ``golden age
of comedy,'' both as a writer and an actor. He did three series
with Monty Python's ensemble of nonsense comedians and edited the
spinoff books and co-wrote and appeared in three Monty Python
movies.
   Idle's role in ``Around the World in 80 Days'' took him to
London, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Yugoslavia and the River Kwai in
Thailand.
   Some railroad scenes were filmed on the River Kwai Railroad, the
infamous line built by Allied prisoners of war in the movie ``The
Bridge Over the River Kwai.''
   ``Every foot of the railroad represents someone who died,'' Idle
says. ``It's beautiful and chilling at the same time.''
   Idle notes that since ``Around the World in 80 Days'' was
written by Jules Verne, a Frenchman, Passeportout receives a more
sympathetic treatment than does the Englishman Fogg.
   ``Verne pictured Fogg as the punctual Englishman who must have
his bath water at a certain temperature,'' Idle says, ``while
Passeportout chases women and drinks wine.''
   ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,'' the new epic fantasy
from Columbia Pictures, was directed by Terry Gilliam, another
alumni of Monty Python. John Neville plays the title role. Robin
Williams plays the king of the moon.
   ``Munchausen was an 18th-century character who used to boast
about his exploits,'' Idle says. ``The tales eventually became
short stories that were favorites with children.
   ``I play an actor who plays Berthold in the play within a play.
I had my head shaved for six months in order to play Berthold. He
has spent 20 years in prison on the moon.''
   Idle describes the movie as an epic fantasy in the mold of ``The
Wizard of Oz'' or a Cecil B. DeMille film.
   He says it's unlikely that the Monty Python team will get back
together, except perhaps for a special on the 20th anniversary.
Members of the ensemble were Gilliam, Idle, John Cleese, Terry
Jones, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman.

   Philip Bosco may not be the busiest actor in the
New York theater. It just seems that way.
   In nearly 35 years as a performer, Bosco has appeared in 99
plays, 61 of them in New York, according to his extensive Playbill
biography. He usually shuttles between Broadway's Circle in the
Square and off-Broadway's Roundabout Theater Company, sometimes
playing both in one season.
   But his broad, beefy, Irish face is not well-known beyond the
Hudson River. That may change with Bosco's critically praised
performance in Ken Ludwig's farce, ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' and his
growing movie career in such films as ``Children of a Lesser God,''
``Three Men and a Baby'' and ``Working Girl.''
   In ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' now on view at Broadway's Royale
Theater, Bosco plays an apoplectic opera company manager. In it, he
manages to turn frenzy into high, hilarious art.
   Theater has always been Bosco's major focus, and he has had
seven good reasons to keep working steadily in it. His children:
Diane, Philip, Chris, Jenny, Lisa, Celia and John.
   ``My wife, Nancy, has been a wonderful manager,'' the
58-year-old Bosco says. ``I've never been interested in money. It
has never mattered to me. Money was the cause of a great deal of
difficulty in my family when I was a kid.''
   Bosco's father was in the small carnival business in Jersey
City, N.J. His family would travel, mostly during the summers,
throughout the Northeast.
   ``As a kid, I used to work mostly in penny pitch,'' Bosco
recalls. ``Then I began to work ball games where you'd knock the
bottles down, then wheel games and when I got older, even gambling
joints. It was not your average, run-of-the-mill childhood.''
   In Catholic grammar school, the nuns thought Bosco was a pretty
good reader. It's there he made his stage debut at the age of 12,
playing Machevilli the cat in a little something called ``The Fairy
Cobbler.''
   ``I was a big success because I played with my tail all through
the show,'' he says.
   Acting had made an impression on Bosco. In high school, he
appeared in the winter and spring plays, entered elocutionary
contests and was on the debating team. He ended up at Catholic
University in Washington and was a regular on the local Washington
theater circuit, including stints at a summer theater in Olney,
Md., and at fledgling Arena Stage.
   In 1960, Bosco and his wife moved to the New York area for good,
settling in Teaneck, N.J., where they still live.
   His New York career did not have an auspicious beginning. While
rehearsing his first show _ ``Measure for Measure'' in Central Park
_ his car was broken into and the belongings he was moving from
Washington were stolen.
   But the play and Bosco got good notices. The actor landed an
agent and his New York career was launched. Much of his early days
were spent at Lincoln Center in its repertory company run by Jules
Irving and Herbert Blau.
   ``But when Irving left Lincoln Center in 1973, I was out of work
for about 18 months,'' he recalls. ``That's the longest I've ever
been out of a job. My wife went to work, and I took part-time jobs
outside the theater.
   ``When you are in a reof get
insulated and you get removed from the Broadway scene,'' he says.
``You're not thought of for shows. After a while, people stop
calling.''
   Eventually, people, Joseph Papp in particular, did. Bosco went
back to Lincoln Center, when Papp took over there, to appear with
Ruth Gordon in George Bernard Shaw's ``Mrs. Warren's Profession''
and then replaced Raul Julia in ``The Threepenny Opera.'' Since
then, Bosco hasn't stopped working.
   In ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' Bosco co-stars with Victor Garber, an
actor he has worked with before in ``You Never Can Tell'' and ``The
Devil's Disciple'' at Circle in the Square.
   It was Garber who suggested Bosco for the role of the opera
company manager to the show's producers and to director Jerry Zaks.
   ``Jerry's attention to detail is all-encompassing,'' Bosco says.
``Nothing escapes him. He will work on a thing until he is
satisfied with it. You work very hard. Pace is the critical thing.
You have to keep ahead of the audience all the time.''
   With farce, Bosco says, you sometimes can go too fast.
   ``I remember coming off and being annoyed with myself because I
stumbled over three or four words in a scene,'' he says. ``Usually
it's for lack of concentration but in this case it was because I
was talking faster than I was thinking.
   ``That's why comedy is so difficult to play. When you make a
mistake, it's so obvious. You can really screw up in a drama, where
there are pauses and stops, and no one would know that you've done
it.''
   At the urging of his family and his agent, Bosco has made some
15 to 20 films in the last five years. The roles have been small,
but the salaries were enormous.
   ``You can't make any money in the theater,'' he says. ``If you
are lucky enough to get in a Broadway show, who knows how long it's
going to run.''
   Was it hard to break into movies?
   ``When you work in the theater, they tend not to think of you
for movies,'' Bosco says. ``They're just different communities. And
there aren't too many peo for Sunday, April 9

   To look at Argentina is to look at a nation that
has everything going for it. But nothing is. This is one of a
series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the economic,
social and political turbulence that has turned South America into
a continent in crisis.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The way things are today, it is
hard to believe that after World War II Argentina was one of the
wealthiest nations in the world.
   Many Argentines today date the steady decline of their economic
fortunes since then to a day in February, 1946, when Gen. Juan
Domingo Peron visited the Central Bank after being elected
president and came out marveling at the pile of gold bars he saw
inside.
   ``You can hardly walk through the corridors,'' he remarked.
   Argentines still cite those words in looking back.
   They still have as high a standard of living as anyone in South
America, but they no longer are rich and many blame that on Peron
and his policies which still exerting influence long after his
heyday and 14 years after his death.
   He nationalized industries, regulated wages and prices and work
conditions, expanded public employment and social welfare programs,
convinced millions of Argentines that big government was best. He
created a political party that bears his name to carry out his
vision.
   Today, one worker of every six is employed by the government _
about 2 million overall in a population of 30 million. The state
subsidizes an estimated 300 companies. The budget usually is in
deficit. Natural resources go untapped. Private industry chafes at
myriad regulations.
   ``The state, from 1945 to now, has gotten a little bigger every
year, and it has long since reached the point where it can be
sustained,'' says Juan Jose Cresto, chairman of the department of
economics at the University of Buenos Aires.
   ``Everyone realizes what the problem is, but there is no general
agreement on a solution,'' says Enrique Szewach, chief economist at
the independent Latin America Research Foundation.
   The dominance of the state has been one constant in a political
and economic maelstrom that has hampered development in a country
blessed with resources.
   Over the years, soldiers ousted civilians and democratic rule
gave way to dictatorship. The political and economic ``rules of the
game'' changed quickly and often.
   New regimes have tried to wipe out what came before rather than
build on what may have been achieved.
   Economically, currency-exchange rates have been undervalued and
then overvalued. Business has been protected and then forced to
face international competition. Wages and prices have been
controlled and then set by market forces. Exports have been favored
and then imports, agriculture and then industry.
   Meanwhile, the country slipped into decline _ despite fertile
cropland and a temperate climate, rich fishing grounds, abundant
deposits of oil, natural gas and uranium, rivers that can be tapped
for hydroelectric power, and a literate population not divided by
language, religion or race.
   The gross domestic product has stagnated at about $80 billion
for a decade. Annual per capita income dropped to the equivalent of
$1,630 in 1988 from $1,990 in 1980, according to the World Bank.
   Raul Alfonsin, 62, an attorney and human rights leader, has been
president since December 1983. Already, he has outlasted all his
predecessors since Peron, but his tenure has been rocky.
   The military, which unseated Peron in 1955, Arturo Frondizi in
1962, Arturo Illia in 1966 and the widow Isabel Peron in 1976, has
had minor revolts in its ranks three times in the past two years.
Human rights groups and other critics maintain the military is
agitating again for political power.
   The radical left also has not given up, despite the brutal
crackdown on subversives beginning with Isabel Peron's government
in 1974 and carried on by the 1976-83 military regime in which at
least 8,963 Argentine civilians were arrested, never seen again and
presumed executed, according to the findings of a commission set up
by Alfonsin. But human rights groups, among them Amnesty
International, estimate the number of people who disappeared _
``desaparecidos'' _ at 10,000 to 30,000.
   Few expect any outbreak of violence such as that recently in
Venezuela, but if it happens the spark might come from an economy
that neither soldiers nor civilians have been able to control.
   Inflation has been at triple-digit rates in 13 of the past 14
years _ climbing from 24.39 percent in 1974 to 688 percent in 1984
and down to 387.70 percent last year. Unemployment and
under-employment stand at a combined 14 percent. The austral
currency is devalued every month, and wages often fail to keep up
with inflation.

<TEXT>
   Looming over everything is the nearly $59-billion foreign debt,
for which there is almost nothing to show. The military borrowed
heavily to balance the budget in the late 1970s.
   It also used the money to buy military equipment, build highways
through Buenos Aires, subsidize military-run industries and inject
money into chronically inefficient state-owned companies. It used
some of the money to play host to the World Soccer Cup tournament
in 1978.
   Alfonsin has borrowed mostly to pay the interest on the debt
but, by his own admission, has paid only 50 percent of the interest
due. Argentina's international credit rating now is classified as
``substandard'' and is on the verge dropping to ``value impaired''
because of noncompliance with interest payments.
   Debt repayment now costs $6 billion a year and consumes _ or
would if the government paid it _ more than one-half of total
export earnings. The Central Bank is $2.5 billion in arrears.
   In human terms, people who used to drive to work now take the
bus or subway. Home ownership for many is out of the question.
Vacations are shorter and closer to home. University graduates are
emigrating in increasing numbers to Europe or the United States.
   Wage strikes by public employees are common and schoolchildren
stay home, mail doesn't get delivered, businesmen go to work in car
pools.
   The General Labor Confederation has staged 13 general strikes
since Alfonsin became president.
   The 4-million-member confederation, which was forged by Peron,
is lending considerable support to the Peronist Party's candidate,
Carlos Menem, in the presidential elections set for May 14.
   Perhaps Alfonsin's biggest accomplishment has been to hold
together a fragile democracy and fractious republic for five years.
A main goal, he has said, is to hand over political power to an
elected successor in December. That has not happened since 1928.
   The biggest failure of Alfonsin's military predecessor was the
war with Britain over the Falkland Islands, the Malvinas to
Argentines.
   Alfonsin's biggest failure has been the economy.
   He has tried without much success to cut the federal budget,
reorganize the banking sector, lower trade barriers, increase tax
collections and sell the state telephone company and the national
airline, Aerolineas Argentinas.
   Alfonsin's second major anti-inflation plan collapsed in
February. In the weeks since, the austral has plummeted by 59
percent against the U.S. dollar. Cars valued in australs now seem
half-priced to those with dollars. Apartments selling for dollars
doubled in cost for buyers with australs.
   National elections raise the prospect of more instability.
   Menem, the front-runner, pledges to dramatically improve workers
wages and hints he might not continue payments on the foreign debt.
He talks vaguely of a ``productive revolution'' to spur growth and
a ``social pact'' to resolve tensions.
   His main challenger, Eduardo Angeloz of Alfonsin's Radical Civic
Union, pledges to balance the budget, attract foreign investment
and sell off state companies despite the opposition of unions.
   Compounding matters, the election could wind up in the Electoral
College, where conservative third-party candidate Alvaro Alsogaray
may hold the votes to push one or the other _ probably Angeloz _
past the required 50 percent of 600 electors.
   In a recent television interview, Alsogaray, 75, said his
grandchildren asked him whether they should study for a career in
Argentina, or emigrate.
   ``I told them they should go abroad,'' he said.
   A return to the days of the 1920s and 1930s, when beef and grain
exports to Europe propelled Argentina into the top 10 countries in
per capita income, is beyond anyone's hope now.

<HEAD>Six Months After Coup, Democracy Remains Elusive in Haiti</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In a roofless, burned-out church,
the congregation sings hymns in Creole about death and crushed
dreams.
   ``They kill us in the street, they kill us in our homes, they
kill us inside church.''
   The words flowed from 200 or so worshipers during Mass at St.
Jean Bosco Roman Catholic Church in the midst of slum.
   ``The problems of our country make us die like animals.
   ``Democracy. Democracy.''
   In September thugs with machetes, guns and spikes stormed into
St. Jean Bosco during Mass, killing 13 people and wounding 70
others before setting the church afire with gasoline. A week later,
on Sept. 17, rank-and-file soldiers revolted and put Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril in power.
   They overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and stirred hopes for
democracy at last in Haiti.
   The Caribbean-island nation has known almost nothing but brutal
dictatorships since winning independence from France in 1804 _ the
first slave state to become a nation.
   Today, six months after Avril took over and three years after
dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier flew to exile in France,
there is disillusionment over the pace of promised democratic
reforms, while allegations of human-rights violations continue.
   But Avril, who holds a law degree, has made some, albeit slow,
progress toward his pled an
elected government. His government maintains democracy is the only
path for the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
   ``We've had dictatorships for 184 years and we are still the
least developing nation in Latin America. So something is wrong
with how we governed,'' said Foreign Minister Serge Elie Charles in
an interview. ``Democracy is not a choice; it's an imperative.''
   In February, Avril approved the formation of an independent
council to oversee eventual elections and he recently restored 291
articles of the 1987 constitution, suspended in June by Namphy. But
37 articles that mostly restricted the army's role were not revived
because, Avril said, they were inconsistent with a de facto
government.
   ``You can't expect this government to behave like a
democratically elected government,'' sociologist Leopold Berlanger,
head of the Haitian Research and Development Institute, said in an
interview. ``Avril is a product of the system.
   ``The only thing we have to expect is that he assures a secure,
fair and honest democratic process.''
   The 50-year-old Avril was Duvalier's close financial adviser and
people still associate him with the old regime. Many charge he is
making reforms merely to win back $70 million in U.S. economic
assistance. The aid was frozen Nov. 29, 1987, after goonsquads
killed 34 people voting in the country's first election in 30 years.
   The U.S. State Department has said it won't renew aid until
democratic government is in place but Congress could release some
funds in the meantime as an incentive.
   With about 80 percent of the country's 5.5 million people living
in dire poverty, Haiti desperately needs help.
   ``Witholding aid has been very negative,'' said the foreign
minister. ``The social-economic factors have worsened so we cannot
say how these measures have in any way advanced democracy.''
   This year, labor strikes and sporadic demonstrations broke out
in Port-au-Prince, the capital, and in the provinces with demands
for Avril to step down.
   America's Watch and other human rights groups say abuses and
arbitrary arrests by the army and paramilitary groups continue to
be made of people in peasant organizations, labor unions and church
groups.
   ``The basic human rights situation has not changed,'' said
Robert Duval, who was a political prisoner under Jean Claude
Duvalier and today runs a human rights group. ``In the last weeks
we have found one to two bodies a night as a result of the
political situation.''
   Duvalier's feared private militia, the Tonton Macoute, was
disbanded after Jean-Claude fled and some were integrated into the
7,000-member army. But they were chased out by soldiers who brought
Avril to power.
   Although disorganized, the army wields considerable power.
   ``You're not going to get to power if there's not a reasonable
understanding with those guys,'' said presidenial hopeful Marc
Bazin, a former Finance Minister and World Bank economist. ``You
would be killed or disappear one morning.''
   Optimism waned a month after Avril took office when the soldiers
who put him in power were jailed, accused of plotting a coup. Three
months later, they were released. No explanation was given.
   But the tide turned in late December when Avril gave Franck
Romain, the notorious mayor of Port-Au-Prince, safe passage to the
Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti.
   Romain, a retired colonel, was believed to have orchestrated the
church massacre and was implicated in the one against voters in
1987.
   ``Giving Romain safe conduct showed the tendency of the
government to preserve the status quo and encourage the
Duvalierists to stay on _ not to pursue the murderers of Nov. 29 or
the church massacre,'' said Louis Dejoie II, son of popular
industrialist who lost to Francois Duvalier, Jean-Claude's father,
in the disputed 1957 election.
   Fears also abound that elections would again be disrupted or
rigged, as was believed the case in the elections Jan. 17, 1988,
when frightened voters stayed home and Leslie Manigat came to power
amid allegations of fraud. Manigat was overthrown by Namphy five
months later.
   ``International pressure would have to be great so they can't
repeat the events of November or of January's sham election,'' said
sociologist Hubert de Ronceray, the runner-up in the 1988 election.
   About a dozen opposition parties and an array of organizations
have emerged since 1986 but are divided.
   ``The democratic process depends on confidence building between
the army and civilians,'' a Western diplomat said. ``Civilians have
to trust the army to take its role but not to take control. And you
have to have the willingness of the existing government, the
quietude of the far left and the tolerance of the far right.''
   No one predicts what will happen.
   The Communist Party, the grassroots ``popular church'' and
leftist unions are influential with peasants and the poor. These
groups want Avril to step down and allow a coalition government to
govern until elections.
   Many say Avril is caught in the middle.
   ``He risks being overthrown if he doesn't make enough progress.
He risks it if he does,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``So he's trying to maintain an equilibrium.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Rooftops,'' ``SING''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``SING'' opens March 31.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Rooftops''
   
   Let's hear it for the septuagenarian film director.
   Charles Crichton, who made ``The Lavender Hill Mob'' and other
comedy classics, scored an Academy Award nomination at 78 for his
rollicking ``A Fish Named Wanda.'' Samuel Fuller (``Pickup on South
Street'') is starting another action movie at 77. Now Robert Wise,
74, has a new film, ``Rooftops.''
   It's not in the range of Wise's ``West Side Story,'' to which it
is inevitably compared. But ``Rooftops'' is handsomely produced,
directed with kinetic energy and skillfully acted by a youthful
cast.
   Amazingly, ``Rooftops'' was produced on the streets and of New
York City for $8 million. Wise's last movie, ``Star Trek: The
Motion Picture,'' reportedly cost $50 million.
   Like ``West Side Story,'' ``Rooftops'' deals with urban warfare.
The setting is Manhattan's lower East Side, where homeless
teen-agers live on top of abandoned tenements and earn a meager
living by scrounging used plumbing and auto parts. They are at odds
with punk gangs and, on a more sinister level, the venomous drug
dealers.
   A straight-arrow loner known only as T (Jason Gedrick) pumps
iron at his watertower apartment and tries to stay out of trouble.
Then he falls for Elena (Troy Beyer), a virtuous girl who has been
trapped into serving as lookout for her drug-dealing cousin, Lobo
(Eddie Velez). Conflict builds to a violent showdown, with T and a
few allies mismatched against Lobo and his thugs.
   While not a musical per se, ``Rooftops'' is scored to continuous
rock music by David Stewart of the Eurythmics, and Michael Kamen of
Pink Floyd. Plenty of lively choreography is provided by the
capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian exercise that combines karate with
ballet.
   Wise's direction is a marvel, capturing the action while drawing
credible performances. The stumbling point is Terence Brennan's
script, which lacks surprise and explores no new ground in the
struggle of survival in the big-city jungle.
   Jason Gedrick supplies a strong, sullen presence as the hero,
and Eddie Velez is appropriately terrifying as the heavy. Troy
Beyer's unspoiled beauty and dramatic depth indicate a promising
future. Young Alexis Cruz provides bright moments as the
spray-paint artist Squeak.
   The New Visions Picture was produced by Howard W. Koch Jr., and
bears an R rating, for language and violence. Running time: 95

   ``SING''
   
   Generations of Brooklyn high school students have enjoyed one of
academia's most popular traditions, Sing. The school song and dance
competition between grades at individual schools such as Erasmus
Hall and Midwood was a joyous and spirited event. It bubbled like
the 2 cents plain at Jahn's ice cream parlor.
   Unfortunately, Richard Baskin's recreation of that spirited show
in ``SING'' is as flat as a stale egg cream. It was written by Dean
Pitchford, and has the same situational formulas as his ``Fame''
and ``Footloose.''
   It stars two newcomers, Peter Dobson and Jessica Steen, who are
appealing enough but lack the power and talent to truly carry a
movie. Louise Lasser, heavier and less frenzied than her ``Mary
Hartman, Mary Hartman'' days, co-stars as Steen's mom. Lorraine
Bracco (``Someone to Watch Over Me''), with a heavy Hollywood-style
Brooklyn accent, portrays a street-tough teacher who returns to her
community.
   Singer Patti LaBelle (``A Soldier's Story'') is the only cast
member who has enough high energy to dominate the screen and infuse
some excitement. But her explosive talent is little used in her
role as a teacher who also works with the Sing committee.
   ``SING'' is centered around the threatened closing of an
imaginary Brooklyn high school where the competition has been a
community tradition. Students, faculty and members of the
neighborhood rally to keep the school open so the skits can be put
on, and to retain a way of life.
   At the same time, a local punk named Dominic (Dobson) is forced
into being a Sing leader by his teacher, Miss Lombardo (Bracco),
who is trying to turn him from a life of crime. Dominic falls in
love with Hannah (Steen), a good student and good girl, and it's
like water mixing with oil.
   The movie is sprinkled with enough perky songs to fill an album.
Pitchford wrote all the lyrics, with music by Tom Snow, Rhett
Lawrence, Patrick Leonard, Jonathan Cain, Martin Page, Tom Kelly,
Desmond Child, Diane Warren and Richard Marx. However, there are
more misses than hits.
   The Craig Zadan production for Tri-Star Pictures leaves one
thirsting for ``West Side Story,'' or even ``To Sir With Love.''
And the producers might take lessons from the former Brooklyn
students who poured so much talent into the Sing competitions:
Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond, Paul Simon, Art Garfunkel and Neil
Sedaka.
   ``SING'' is rated PG-13.

   ``Imagine'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated PG)
   
   ``Imagine'' bills itself as ``the definitive film portrait'' of
musician-poet-pop icon John Lennon. It's too early to judge this
film biography as definitive, but it is certainly a comprehensive,
thoughtful and deeply moving study of the most complicated Beatle.
   Produced by David L. Wolper and directed by Andrew Solt, the
film is a compilation of more than 100 interviews with Lennon
himself, Yoko Ono, his first wife, Cynthia, sons Julian and Sean,
the aunt who raised him, manager Brian Epstein and dozens of other
lesser characters.
   The well-paced production (Wolper and Solt previously
collaborated on ``This Is Elvis'') contains footage of Lennon's
early years in Liverpool, the Beatles' first success in Hamburg,
West Germany, the group's phenomenal U.S. tour, the drugs, the
break-up, life with Yoko, alternating between public and private
glimpses of the artist.
   Highlights include a combative _ and hilarious _ exchange
between Lennon and cartoonist Al Capp, and a poignant performance
of the song ``Imagine'' shortly after Lennon wrote it.
   The film wisely does not end abruptly with Lennon's
assassination in 1980 but moves beyond, showing what his music
meant to an entire generation. The soundtrack, with nearly three
dozen songs, is stunning.

   ``The Thin Blue Line'' (HBO Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.99)
   
   Errol Morris' singular documentary about the circumstances that
led to a man being convicted of murdering a Dallas police officer
and condemned to death is at the very least harrowing in its
implications.
   Before you say it couldn't happen to you, read on:
   It was Thanksgiving weekend in 1976 when Randall Dale Adams, a
day laborer with no criminal record, fell in with Richard Harris, a
16-year-old juvenile delinquent. They spent the day hanging out.
   Adams says they split up at 10 p.m. Harris testified that they
were together at midnight, when Officer Robert Wood died during a
routine traffic stop, shot to death by a gun Harris had stolen.
   Harris boasted about killing a cop to friends, but when he
fingered Adams for the crime, he was believed. Adams, who has
maintained he is innocent, landed on death row. His sentence later
was commuted to life in prison.
   What's harrowing is the low-key way in which Morris reconstructs
the crime, offers the testimony of witnesses and conducts
interviews with the principals. Very gradually you realize that
Randall Dale Adams got railroaded by police and prosecutors with
the best intentions in the world. They knew he was guilty; it was
just a case of fitting the facts to conform to that truth.
   ``Rashomon'' this isn't, but powerful and persuasive and
chilling it is.
   As a result of Morris' critically acclaimed effort, Adams'
conviction was overturned.
   In December, a Texas state judge recommended that Adams receive
a new trial or be set free. On Feb. 24, Texas refused, for the
eighth time, to parole him and scheduled its next review for
December 1990.
   But on March 1, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ordered a
new trial for him, saying a witness had lied and a prosecutor
suppressed evidence. And on March 23, the Dallas County, Texas,
district attorney dropped the case against Adams, citing a lack of
evidence.
   ``You know, Texas wanted to execute me in '79,'' Adams said in
December. ``So each day past that is a day that I'm alive.''

   ``Lyle Lovett and His Large Band'' (Curb-MCA) _ Lyle Lovett
   
   So besides large, just what sort of band is this?
   Listen to the album's instrumental opener, ``The Blues Walk,''
and you might think ``large band'' is just a clever name for 1940s
``big band.'' But wait. Next comes ``Here I Am,'' an odd comic turn
combining spoken-word passages with a blues-rock refrain. Now skip
ahead a few tracks and hear that unmistakable country sound.
   So what sort of band is this? Why, it's a
jazz-blues-swing-R&amp;B-country-western-rock band, of course. And the
individual songs on this fun, quirky album are just as tough to
categorize.
   ``I Married Her Just Because She Looks Like You'' comes closest
to following a standard country formula, but its wry lyrics are a
cut above that standard. ``Good Intentions'' is a sort of talkin'
blues number that could easily come from David Bromberg's songbook.
Then there's ``What Do You Do,'' which starts out as a sassy blues
number, turns into a bar-pickup conversation (Lovett in duet with
vocalist Francine Reed) and slides into the 1936 standard ``The
Glory of Love.''
   Tying all of this together is Lovett's peculiar combination of
cynicism and romanticism that adds an edge to his I-love-you songs
(``I Know You Know'') and a softness to his she-done-me-wrong songs
(``Once Is Enough'').
   This Texan's country roots come out more strongly as the album
plays on. The world could do without Lovett's cover of ``Stand By
Your Man,'' but his reworking of the traditional ``Farther Along''
into the lost-love ballad ``If You Were to Wake Up'' has a simple
charm.
   As for the Large Band, it adapts to the needs of each song,
appearing in various sizes and combinations of instruments
including fiddles, cello and saxophones as well as guitars,
keyboards and drums. More than large _ it's grand.

   ``Wiener Blut'' (Sire) _ Falco
   
   Falco, the one-time classical music child prodigy who had a No.
1 hit with the unusual ``Rock Me Amadeus'' single in 1986, has
returned after a two-year hiatus with ``Wiener Blut.''
   The record is chock full of the synthesizer-based pop rock so in
vogue today, with its fabricated drums and overblown melodies. But
at its base ``Wiener Blut'' rocks solidly, surprisingly.
   On Side 1, the Austrian-born Falco _ nee Johann Holzel _
collaborates with the Dutch brothers Rob and Ferdi Holland, the
producer-arranger-composer duo that was responsible for ``Rock Me
Amadeus.''
   The result is highly orchestral, almost baroque pop _ lush
synthesizer lines backed by a heavy dance beat and punctuated by
stinging guitar solos. The title cut best typifies this style,
while ``Untouchable'' incorporates the television show's theme into
the melody and ``Satellite to Satellite,'' with its
technology-can-save-us lyrics, combines a spacy synthesizer with a
good rock beat.
   Side 2 leaves the Holland brothers behind. Falco takes charge on
most cuts, and the result is a simpler, more satisfying set of
tunes with more of a message.
   ``Walls of Silence,'' the best cut on ``Wiener Blut,'' is a slow
rocker dealing with the inability of nations to communicate. The
wall of the title represents that inability _ probably best
symbolized by the Berlin wall.
   Falco keeps the beat rocking steady with ``(She's My) Solid
Booze'' and ``Wie Sand Am Himalaya.'' He even checks in with a
spirited version of Steely Dan's 1972 hit ``Do It Again'' that
features Falco's best singing on the record.
   Falco is often silly and vapid. That's too bad, because when he
wants to, he makes some pretty fair rock 'n' roll. Here's hoping he
can stick to the beat.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Carmen Maura and Pedro Almodovar Create a Stir</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Impressions of a Spanish film star on her
first glimpse of Hollywood:
   ``I am a little afraid of this city. It is very special. I think
it is too much for me. Too much. It is very big, lot of cars. I
drive but I don't want to drive (here). It is impossible to live
here without car. Impossible to work.''
   It's hard to imagine Carmen Maura afraid of anything. Her fiery
temperament is one of the many delights of ``Women on the Verge of
a Nervous Breakdown,'' Spain's entry as foreign language film in
the Academy Award sweepstakes.
   The film, the director Pedro Almodovar and Maura have elicited
rave reviews from American critics, and the moviegoing public has
responded accordingly. The movie has grossed $4.6 million, which is
big money for a subtitled film these days.
   ``Women on the Verge'' has been compared to the great screwball
comedies of the late 1930s Hollywood. Maura says she is not
surprised that Americans like the film.
   ``When I started to work with Pedro 10 years ago, we had a
situation and a relationship that was very special,'' she recalled.
``I said to him, `Oh, Pedro, don't worry, because in time the
Americans will understand you.'
   ``I am very proud of Pedro Almodovar. He is very genuine. His
sense of humor is very American sometimes, and my sense of humor
also. The Spanish have a lot of sense of humor. The directors in
Spain don't normally make the kinds of films like Pedro makes. They
make films about the war, about the poor _ no colors, no rich
persons. Pedro is different.''
   The Almodovar-Maura partnership goes back to when he was working
for the telephone company in Madrid and she was a mostly unemployed
actress. The dark beauty, who speaks in bursts of slightly flawed
English, remarked:
   ``The first moment when I meet Pedro, I am a little actress and
he is very young. He had no money; he had nothing. He works with
the Telefonica and with little parts in the theater. He work with
Super-8 (movies) and he make jokes every day.
   ``He has an imagination really, really special. He began to
speak to me, and I began to speak to him about life, about women,
about men. I say to him, `Pedro, you must get away from the Super-8
and go to the big film.' So we make the first film during two years
on the weekends, without money, without makeup, without nothing. It
was a very, very funny movie.''
   It was called ``Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls Like Mom,'' a
title that set the tone for Almodovar's film career. Born in a
small village of La Mancha in 1951, he had come to Madrid at the
age of 17, worked at various humdrum jobs while indulging in the
burgeoning world of underground literature, pop music and movies.
At one time he played in a rock band called Almodovar and McNamara.
   Carmen Maura was born to a conservative Madrid family in 1945.
After a Catholic education, she worked in an art gallery while
seeking work in theater productions. She met Pedro when she was
starring in Satre's ``Dirty Hands,'' and he had a one-line role.
After their first movie, she became a TV talk-show hostess on the
popular ``Esta Noche'' (``Tonight'') program.
   Almodovar first attracted attention outside of Spain with his
third film, ``Dark Habits,'' in which Maura played a bongo-playing
nun. In his other films, she portrayed a harried housewife (``What
Have I Done to Deserve This?''), a psychiatrist (``Matador'') and a
flamboyant transsexual (``Law of Desire''). The director's
reputation continued to grow, then he exploded with ``Women on the
Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' which opened last season's New York
Film Festival.
   ``It is the first time that a Spanish film has made as much
money as an American film,'' Maura said. ``In this case we have the
money like `Rambo,' like Spielberg. It is the most successful film
in the history of the Spanish film. The people see the film three
times, four times, and they go with the whole family. They repeat,
they laugh a lot. The film is in four cinemas one year. It has a
long life in Spain.
   ``I don't understand exactly what happened with this film. The
cinema is a mystery. Sometimes it happens. I don't understand it.''

<HEAD>The Artists: War's Impact on Iraqi Artists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Murthada Haddad, one of Iraq's emerging
sculptors, spent six years fighting the Iranians in the gulf war,
and the horrors he and other artists experienced at the front have
had a dramatic impact on Iraqi art.
   ``I saw too many people die in the war and they come out in my
work. It was a very, very painful experience,'' said Haddad, who
lost his studio and foundry in the southern port of Basra when it
took a direct hit from Iranian shellfire during fierce assaults on
the city.
   Six months after the August cease-fire, there are few signs of
the conflict on the streets of Baghdad. But the battle scars are
visible in the capital's museums, galleries and studios.
   Gone are the idyllic landscapes, the bedouins on horseback, the
scenes from the marshes and the mountains _ all traditional
subjects artists favored before the war began in September 1980. In
their place are searing sculptures and paintings that reflect the
carnage the artists witnessed.
   Three sculptures by Haddad, displayed at a recent one-man
exhibition, show small, bronze figures sitting twisted and bound,
covering their faces. The group is called ``Prisoner of War.''
   A statue commemmorating a missile attack was designed by
Muhammed Ghani, whose whimsical statues inspired by the legend of
``1,001 Nights'' are Baghdad landmarks. A girl in the statue has
two shattered stumps for legs.
   A painting entitled ``War and Peace,'' which won plastic surgeon
Ala Hussein Bashiir the gold medal at the Baghdad International
Festival, shows a man leaving the cold, metallic bonds of his
military uniform to float among the clouds.
   ``The war turned the work of most Iraqi artists into art that
has something to say, not art for decoration,'' the 50-year-old
Bashiir said in an interview. ``They may use the same style, but
the subject has changed.''
   Painter Shakir Hassan, 64, remembers his first visit to the
front after a fierce battle. ``When I saw Basra and the front lines
I understood the dramatic results of war.
   ``When the town itself is burned by bombardment. It means the
existence of things is destroyed _ not just humans, but walls,
paintings as well.''
   One side of his pyramid painting, ``Al-Faw,'' created after the
Iraqi army recaptured the strategic southern peninsula in April
1988 after two years of Iranian occupation, is filled with brightly
colored triangles and squares.
   ``I was using the cultural symbols from Arab and Islamic art,
like old wall decorations from mosques, to represent the strength
of the culture,'' he said. ``Rebuilding them means peace.''
   Artists and critics expect more powerful work to emerge once
artists in the 1 million-strong army Iraq still keeps in the field
get back to their easels.
   ``In the past, the school that was dominant in Iraqi art was the
calligraphy school,'' said prominent critic Jabra Ibrahim Jabra.
``With the war, there was a reaction against that.
   ``The younger artists are very powerful in their statements,
using rough colors, a lot of paint, taking a lot of liberty with
the canvas. They're trying to say something very personal and very
agonized.''
   One strong theme that has emerged in the war-influenced art is
the enduring legacy of the civilizations that prospered along the
Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Artists said 5,000 years of history in
the region was a source of inspiration against the onslaught by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's army.
   ``We have an ancient civilization,'' Ghani said. ``Islam is
relatively young. It's only been here for the past 1,400 years.
Khomeini wanted humanity to go backwards and we didn't want to go
backwards.''
   Haddad used a group of people inspired by ancient Mespotamian
wall reliefs to show the shock induced by the fall of Faw in 1986.
The bearded figures stare off in the distance, mouths agape, hands
crossed over their stomachs.
   Iraqi artists point to the generous checks the government
continued handing out during the war as another important
wellspring of their work.
   ``Our public isn't quite like the public in New York and Los
Angeles in that it wants to acquire paintings for prestige,'' said
Jabra. ``That's coming, but not yet.''
   Culture and Information Minister Latif Nisayyif Jasim visits
most exhibitions, and any artist who has had a one-man show is
eligible for government commissions.
   Everything from the massive new Basra airport to conference
rooms at the state oil marketing authority are hung with original
artwork.
   A gold medal at Baghdad's international exhibition carried a
$15,000 prize. While travel abroad is banned for most Iraqis,
artists are allowed to leave to organize exhibitions of their work.
   The government has realized that giving artists a free hand was
an ``indication of the vitality of the nation,'' Jabra said.
   ``Most Iraqi artists are very well-to-do,'' joked Bashiir, who
is getting government support to organize a fall showing of his
work at the Institute du Monde Arabe in Paris. ``They earn 10 times
more than doctors.''
   President Saddam Hussein is known for ruthlessly eliminating his
enemies, and the state-run press is heavily censored. Still,
artists stress that they have a free hand in their work. But with a
limited private market, official tastes tend to dominate and
artists generally laud the government's tough standards in
selecting the works they commission.
   Part of the quality comes from the country's highly competitive
art colleges.
   The crude nature of some of the statues emerging from the war
has been condemned. In Basra, for example, a massive statue on a
freeway interchange shows an Iraqi infantryman brandishing a sword
after chopping open the neck of a massive ``Iranian shark.''
   ``Very few of us are very happy with our public monuments,''
Jabra said. However, he added, ``the arts are flourishing. It's
miraculous.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Thinking About the Flow of Words</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lou Reed's new album, ``New York,'' has been
receiving much critical attention because of its unsparing lyrics
about urban blight.
   He has been asked about lyrical content so much, he wonders why
writers don't go beyond the subject and concern themselves with the
poetry in which the lyrics are expressed.
   ``The opening of `Romeo Had Juliette' _ `Caught between the
twisted stars the plotted lines the faulty map that brought
Columbus to New York' _ you've got to admit that's a great opening
line,'' Reed says. ``Forget about what it means and think of the
flow of words. I wish people would notice. Don't you get some kind
of pleasure when you listen to the language?
   ``It's the first song I wrote for the album; it was the standard
for the rest. We had the luxury to go in and test out the studio.
We tested it with `Romeo' and kept the cut we did for the record.''
   Reed talked about his music in an interview at the American
Sound Studio, where he and a band were rehearsing for a tour that
will include an engagement at Broadway's St. James Theater.
   That's a distance from Reed's early, scruffy days in the Velvet
Underground. The group was discovered in 1967 in New York's
underground rock scene by the late pop artist, Andy Warhol, who
promoted them. It remained menacingly non-mainstream and didn't
become commercial. Later, though, it became a role model for punk
rock. Working solo since 1970, Reed has had only one pop hit,
``Walk on the Wild Side,'' in 1973.
   Next November, Reed and John Cale, who also left the Velvet
Underground in 1970, will present an evening of songs in tribute to
Warhol at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
   When he was cutting ``New York'' _ as lyrically street-tough as
ever but accepted in these days of rappers and U2 _ Reed wasn't
expecting media attention.
   ``You can tell from listening we weren't thinking in terms of
radio airplay,'' he said.
   ``Dirty Blvd.'' begins: ``Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel.
He looks out a window without glass. The walls are made of
cardboard newspapers on his feet. His father beats him 'cause he's
too tired to beg.''
   Sire Records wanted to market a single, but Reed said he wasn't
the type of person to sell singles. ``I pushed for `Dirty Blvd.'
because I thought the single should at least be representative of
the album. Look what happened,'' he said.
   ``New York'' is selling better than any previous Lou Reed album,
and is fast climbing the charts.
   A liner note on ``New York'' says, ``You can't beat 2 guitars,
bass, drum.'' The sound of the record was important to Reed, that
the words be understandable and the guitars sound real.
   ``Even though Segovia said an electric guitar is an abomination,
what I like about an electric guitar is it can have all this body
from the wood in it,'' he said. ``We had as one of our goals to
record it so it comes across that way and doesn't sound like a
synthesizer _ thinned out and high endy.
   ``One thing was not to have too many instruments. We wanted my
solos on guitar to be thick and beautiful. We wanted everything to
be heard. Of course, when there's not too many parts, there's
nothing to hide behind. Any mediocrity is heard.''
   His singing is basically talking, and has always been that way.
``In my mind I would like to sing like Otis Redding or Al Green. I
can't, so I had to find a way I could use my range in my style.''
   About the songs, Reed said he doesn't know why he wrote them.
``I didn't sit and say, `I'm going to write about this and this.'
   ``I had pieces of songs. Whatever I get first, I can't change,''
he said. ``I can juggle around with later things, but the first
phrase or line of melody or title I get for a song, I can't change
it. I had the title `Dime Store Mystery' for 20 years. My wife,
Sylvia, said, `When are you going to finish it?' It came up on this
album.
   ``I like that song a lot. It had an odd effect on us when it was
recorded. We were taken someplace else. I can't say where that
someplace was.
   ``I guess people don't expect much out of records. They keep
staying on the plot and asking, `Who do you know in a welfare
hotel?' `Dime Store Mystery' dispenses with plot.''
   Reed said what the album is really about is the use of language.
``That's what I'm really getting off on. There are phrases in there
as good as anything I've ever written.
   ``It is pretty funny, some of it, I thought. It's not endlessly
grim.''
   Reed took part in a benefit concert Paul Simon organized at
Madison Square Garden to buy and equip a medical van to visit New
York welfare hotels. ``Paul bought one with the proceeds of
`Graceland.' Every penny from this concert went to get another
one.''
   Reed has been told that ``Last Great American Whale'' from ``New
York'' will be on a Greenpeace album released in the Soviet Union.
When he's asked if that's a real Indian myth, he says: ``It is now.
It's an American Indian-Jewish myth. In Europe all the great myths
have been taken. Wouldn't it be nice if we could still write a myth
and do it well enough so it held up? I wanted to try to do that.
Why not?''
   Asked about solutions to the big-city problems limned on ``New
York,'' Reed says, ``We only had an hour. We'll get into solutions
on Vol. 2, maybe.''

   It is somehow fitting that when Saul Bellow must
choose between an overstuffed chair and a straight-backed one for
an interview, he selects the less comfortable seat.
   ``I write in a chair as hard as this,'' he said with a smile,
sitting upright in the rigid seat and looking perfectly at ease.
   Bellow _ Nobel Prize winner, Pulitzer Prize winner, the only
author to win three National Book Awards _ has racked up more than
enough laurels on which to comfortably rest, but at 73 he shows no
indication he's ready to relax. His 14th book, ``A Theft''
(Penguin, $6.95), is now in bookstores.
   This reluctance to get too comfortable is all a part of what
Bellow calls ``fighting the Nobel curse'' _ the popular conception
that writers produce little work of merit after winning the
granddaddy of all literature prizes.
   Since receiving the Nobel in 1976, he has published the
following: two novels, ``The Dean's December'' and ``More Die of
Heartbreak''; a collection, ``Him With His Foot in His Mouth and
Other Stories''; and the latest work, a novella.
   Although most critics rank these works below such masterpieces
as ``The Adventures of Augie March,'' ``Mr. Sammler's Planet'' and
``Humboldt's Gift,'' they are by no means considered second-rate,
and the new ``A Theft'' shows Bellow still willing to take risks.
   ``A Theft'' breaks ground on two levels. It is his first long
work to have a female protagonist, and it is the first time an
author of Bellow's stature has opted to publish a book in paperback
without it first appearing in hardcover.
   Bellow is a small man with an unassuming manner and low voice
that contrast nicely with his august reputation. At an interview in
the drawing room of the private Lotos Club, he answered questions
thoughtfully but with little hesitation, as if he had already
considered them.
   The snowy hair, aristocratic nose and space between the front
teeth are familiar from book jackets; what is unexpected is a
tiredness about the eyes that may be old age or simply that he had
risen early enough to appear on a morning talk show that day.
   His novella's heroine is Clara Velde, a middle-aged publishing
executive dubbed the ``czarina of fashion writing.'' For all her
sophistication and Park Avenue polish, Clara, we quickly learn, has
never forgotten her small-town Indiana roots and her strict
Protestant upbringing.
   Nor has she forgotten her first love, Ithiel Regler, a kind of
free-lance global political analyst who appears regularly before
congressional committees and on network news programs. Clara's four
husbands can't hold a candle to him. An emerald engagement ring
Ithiel once gave her is the subject of the book's title.
   Bellow dismissed the critical fuss over his use of a female
protagonist as so much topical ferment and pointed out that many of
his short stories have been about women.
   ``It just struck me forcibly, so I did it. There was no planning
about it, no public policy involved,'' he said. ``I wrote it the
way I write everything.''
   Clara is described in the opening paragraph as an energetic
woman with ``a head unusually big. ... Her blue eyes, exceptionally
large, grew prominent when she brooded. The nose was small _
ancestrally a North Sea nose.''
   Such exacting descriptions of characters' features is a Bellow
trademark. A minor character in ``Augie March'' has ``a
campaigner's red in the face, a powerful bite in his jaw and
gold-crowned teeth, green cockeyes and soft short hair, altogether
Napoleonic.'' Tommy Wilhelm, the protagonist of ``Seize the Day''
has ``a big round face, a wide, flourishing red mouth, stump
teeth.''
   ``It's a lifelong thing for me,'' Bellow said of his fascination
with faces. ``As soon as I meet somebody it just comes over me.
I've never finished with that. Certainly children do that
immediately. Before you have any concept of what it means you have
very powerful impressions of who people are, secret communications,
by the way their ears stand out on their heads, their grimaces. A
nose can tell you volumes.''
   He is asked if he considers the impetuous Clara a romantic, as
so many of his characters are.
   ``I don't know whether she's a romantic character or a
passionate character; the two have become somewhat confused these
days. I do think of her as a very passionate person. I also think
of her as having an intelligence and force,'' said Bellow, who like
many writers speaks of his characters as if they were acquaintances
rather than products of his imagination.
   ``Well, it's often like that,'' he said when this is pointed out
to him. ``Are these people outright inventions? Well, sometimes
they are. But they're never what they were originally. ... It's the
imagination poured into the person that makes them worth reading
about.''
   Bellow is most firmly associated with Chicago, where he has
lived most of his life since he arrived with his family from
Quebec, Canada, when he was 9. The city, from its Depression-era
slums to its modern North Shore high-rises, is the setting of most
of his fiction. However, ``A Theft,'' like a few other works, takes
place in New York, where he lived for a time early in his writing
career.
   Bellow said the debut of ``A Theft'' as a paperback original is
his way of protesting what he considers the third-class treatment
given fiction in magazines these days, where short stories are
increasingly scarce to make room for more articles on sex,
politics, sports, entertainment and other ``distractions.''
   ``Literature is anti-distraction,'' he said. ``It is absorption
and forgetfulness.''
   When two magazines rejected ``A Theft'' as being too long to
publish, Bellow began casting about for another way to get it into
print. He said he probably had enough weight to persuade a
publisher to put out the manuscript in hardcover, but he didn't
want a reader to have to spend $15 or more for a work that ran
barely 100 pages. His agent peddled it to Penguin, and the result
is a book with a 150,000 first printing that will see a far larger
audience than it would have in a magazine.
   Bellow will publish another novella this fall in the same format
and hopes his move will inspire other authors to dig similar
manuscripts out of desk drawers. He is at work on a third novella.
   ``Lately, it's strongly appealed to me,'' he said of the form,
``maybe because of my age. There's a certain number of things I
want to write, and I don't want to invest many years in writing
them at great length. I also have a feeling that a great many
people today also want things to be more compressed.''
   With a self-deprecating laugh, Bellow offered up this assessment
of his work: ``A great many people seem to view me as a very good
writer who is very difficult to read.''
   A wry observation from a man who selects the hard chair over the
soft one _ whose fans do no less, recognizing that less substantial
writers are too cushy to provide support over the long haul.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Eddy Raven Flying High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Eddy Raven is working on a streak
of four straight No. 1 country music records.
   But the biggest song with which he's been associated was one he
wrote that took nine years to become a hit and then became a
country classic: ``Thank God for Kids,'' recorded by the Oak Ridge
Boys.
   The 44-year-old Raven is at the peak of a 20-year recording
career. His ``'Till You Cry'' recently reached No. 1 on at least
one of the national country charts, joining his earlier top ranked
``Shine Shine Shine,'' ``I'm Gonna Get You'' and ``Joe Knows How to
Live.''
   Since October 1987, each of his singles has been No. 1. His
first No. 1 record was ``I Got Mexico'' in 1984. Several other
songs of his have been close to the top spot.
   But it was the emotional lyrics of ``Thank God for Kids'' that
probably will make it the most enduring song of his prolific
singing and songwriting career. The impassioned tune sold 1 million
copies for the Oak Ridge Boys in five weeks in 1982, and has become
the theme song for various anti-child abuse campaigns in the seven
years since.
   ``There's stone reality in that song,'' Raven said in an
interview. ``Everybody who's had kids has had KoolAid on the couch.
Every father has tried to fly a kite. And kids ask thousands of
questions.''
   He composed the song at home in 15 minutes in 1973, inspired by
his 3-year-old son, who said he wanted to help his father write
about Mickey Mouse and Big Bird.
   Raven himself recorded the song in 1976 but only as the B-side
of a record. Music industry executives told him the subject matter
just wasn't what country music fans wanted.
   ``I was told country folks don't care about Santa Claus and
Christmas, that they are interested in love and barrooms,'' Raven
said. ``I tried for three years to get that song put out. They said
no.''
   Finally, the song reached the hands of the Oak Ridge Boys who
made it a hit and one of their most requested tunes.
   As a singer, he recently released the album ``Best of Eddy
Raven,'' his top selling LP to date. Due out by summer on the new
Universal label is another album, ``Temporary Sanity.''
   ``We wanted the title to at least stir some excitement from
people: `What has he done now?''' Raven said about the intriguing
title.
   He has a deep, masculine voice that pours out incisive songs in
a style he describes as ``Cajun reggae, Caribbean Cajun, electric
Cajun.''
   ``No one is doing exactly what we're doing,'' he said about his
style.
   ``Someone asked me why I don't do more hard country like Randy
Travis and Ricky Van Shelton. I said, `Why? They do it great and I
can't do it any better than that.'
   ``I want to break some new ground and bring the Cajun heritage a
step farther and a little step up if we can.''
   Raven, a native of Lafayette, La., was the oldest of 10 children
born to a truck driver. He began performing and writing in his
early teens, but has worked in the cotton and rice fields, as a
service station attendant and in a lumberyard. He even ``ran
moonshine'' for a while.
   His first album came out in 1969, making this his 20th year as a
recording artist.
   He said his streak of No. 1 records has made him more aggressive.
   ``They make you fight harder to make a better product. If you
are honest and realize how fleeting they are and how fortunate you
are, it makes you work harder to find that better song and change
that one lyric to make it better.
   ``It also gives you a little more to show for what you've done.
You hang up a No. 1 plaque before you hang up a No. 3 plaque.''
   He attributed part of his recent success to being hard-headed:
``I've always been stubborn. When people made a suggestion, I
always asked why instead of saying OK. But I got a little more
adamant about it. I really analyzed everything a little better.
   ``I had more expertise. I worked a little bit more. I'm able to
draw on a lot more road experience and more of what the public is
listening to.''

   Gregg Biggins never gave up on oats.
   Even when prices were low and other farmers thought about
switching, Biggins stuck with oats. ``Oats is a great crop.''
   ``It doesn't need the chemicals or the work that a row crop
does. It's nice to be able to have a straw crop to rotate. All this
about oats being good for cholesterol is going to do a lot of good
for the oats industry.''
   ``All this'' is the fact that oat bran, the husk of the kernel,
can help reduce cholesterol and prevent heart attacks. So far,
though, it's been cereal makers and consumers who have reaped the
benefits; farmers are suffering.
   The nation raised more oats under Abraham Lincoln than under
Ronald Reagan, said Keith Carlson of the American Oat Association.
``It's kind of ironic that production has been declining while the
demand ... is increasing.''
   U.S. oat production plummeted by 42 percent last year to 219
million bushels, the smallest crop on record. In South Dakota, the
leading oat state in 1987, production dropped 62 percent last year
to 20 million bushels.
   The summer's drought was one factor, but farmers say government
programs that favored other crops also were to blame.
   ``It's a real shame. There just has not been any money in oats.
You have to get paid for something to want to grow it,'' said
Biggins, of Gregory.
   ``The prices got so bad, I just felt like I had been betrayed,''
said Milt Lakness, of Hayti. ``I'm a fan of the oat. I was tickled
to think I was raising something that was going into Americans'
breakfasts.''
   Some farmers are skeptical about the oat revival, said Dale
Reeves, an oat researcher at South Dakota State University.
``There's a lot of hesitation to get back into oats. You'd think
they'd be clamoring to get back in now.''
   Lakness said he's heard about the oat-bran craze, and is eating
more oatmeal himself these days to lower his cholesterol level. But
he's not ready to stake his financial future on the hope of a
resurgence.
   ``I'll plant oats this year, but I'm not going to plant very
much,'' he said. ``They talk about all this interest in oats, but
if you could make more money on other crops, would you plant oats?
The arithmetic is just not there.''
   Lawmakers haven't tried to encourage production because, until
recently, no one really cared about oats, Carlson said. ``Since the
public wasn't eating them, it didn't make that much difference.''
   That may be changing. A provision of last year's drought bill
gave farmers more freedom to plant oats. ``We were trying to level
out the playing field for oats,'' said Anne Simmons, an aide to
U.S. Rep. Tim Johnson, D-S.D.
   Another measure introduced by Johnson and Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D., would give farmers more flexibility and would raise the
government-guaranteed price, eliminating what Daschle called
``distortions in agriculture programs that discourage oats
production.''
   Deon Stuthman, an oat researcher at the University of Minnesota
and chairman of the National Oat Improvement Council, thinks
Congress may go even further. ``People in a lot of different areas
are embarrassed that the United States will be importing 70 million
bushels of oats this year,'' he said.
   Imports are another reason farmers shouldn't count on a boom,
Lakness said. ``We farmers in this part of the state raise the
finest oats of anyplace in the nation. Then the oat people decide
they can get a better deal somewhere else.''

<HEAD>Newly Discovered Flower Gets Sex Backward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Botanists thought they had plant sex figured
out.
   After all, all 248,000 known flowering plants had the pistil _
the female parts _ in the center, and the stamen _ the male parts _
outside.
   But biologist Esteban Martinez, tromping through three feet of
decaying tropical muck in a chigger-ridden jungle, has proved once
again that little can be taken for granted in science.
   Lacandonia schismatica, a flower the size of a sesame seed, has
the stamen in the center, surrounded by about 50 pistils.
   ``It defies all logic,'' said Warren Stevens, head of research
at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis. He said a paper on
the discovery will appear in an upcoming issue of Annals of the
Missouri Botanical Garden.
   Martinez, who works at the National University of Mexico, found
the star-shaped flower on a fallen tree trunk in the Lacandon
jungle. At first he thought he'd picked up a type of mushroom, and
it took a year to discover and prove it was an exception to the
sexual rule.
   ``It seems to be some sort of massive mutation. One of the
sacred things has been that the female parts are inside the male,''
Stevens said.
   More study is needed to see what advantage a reverse arrangement
could have. The plant appears to reproduce as other flowering
plants do: pollen from the stamen fertilizes the ovaries, which are
part of the pistils. The ovaries turn into fruit, which produce
seeds.
   Martinez and Clara Hilda Ramos agreed to discuss the discovery
before publication because they believe the plant's habitat is
threatened by logging.
   Cutting was banned last year in the 20-acre site where the plant
has been found, but Martinez said he'd heard that members of the
Chol Indian tribe are seeking permission to cut chicle trees,
valued because their wood resists rot.
   The reserve is in Chiapas state near the Guatemalan border.
   ``We've advised all the authorities in Chiapas and the federal
Ecology Department, and we hope they take the proper measures,''
Martinez said.
   Each plant has four to seven flowers 2 millimeters in diameter,
growing along threadlike stems up to 3{ inches long. The flowers
have six tepals _ a kind of petal _ ending in turned-up points.
They are thickish, something like the fleshy leaves of a jade
plant. In the center is a mound of ovaries encircling an average of
three stamen.
   The plant is a brilliant, almost translucent white, ``like
crystal,'' Ramos said. As the ovaries mature, the center turns
yellow, then to the reddish-brown color of its fruit, so tiny
they're like a fine dust.
   Lacking chlorophyll, the plant gets its energy from decomposing
material in the dark, humid jungle with the help of a fungus that
lives in its roots.
   Martinez and Ramos believe the plant doesn't belong to any
existing family and propose that it be categorized as family
Lacandoniaceae, genus Lacandonia and species schismatica, for the
jungle and the fact that it broke with traditional botanical faith.
   Stevens said the plant is clearly a new genus and species, but
he expects it to fall into the existing family of Triuridaceae _
which includes varieties of flowering plants with normally arranged
sexual parts.
   When he spotted the plant in September 1985, Martinez was
collecting for Flora Mesoamericana, a survey run by the National
University, the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Natural History
Museum in London.
   He has been unable to find the plant in other parts of the
jungle, but Stevens thinks it will appear. ``My experience is that
plants don't have ranges that restricted,'' he said.
   The plant has survived for as long as six weeks in the
laboratory, but it then dies, perhaps because it doesn't fertilize
itself and may need insects to carry its pollen to another plant's
pistils.

<HEAD>An Apple a Day Might Make the Doctor Sick</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An apple a day really might keep the doctor
away _ especially if the doctor knew what went on it.
   If fruit were labele the label on apples
would list fiber, potassium and vitamin C _ all of which are good
for you. It also might list azinphis methyl, Captan, Supracide,
parathion, Elgetol, Sevin, NAA, NAD, Ziram, diphenylamine, Lorsban
and benzimidazole.
   These might not be so good, but they're among the dozens of
chemicals routinely used to bring apples from fruit trees to fruit
bowls.
   Without some of them, according to Pennsylvania apple grower
John Rice, chairman of the International Apple Institute, ``People
would have to get used to biting into an apple and seeing a whole
or half a worm.''
   Probably the best-known of these chemicals right now is Alar,
the market name for daminozide, which helps apples ripen, extends
shelf life and prevents bruising. Many schools pulled apples from
their lunchrooms this month after the Natural Res
Council said Alar increased the risk of cancer among children,
whose diet contains proportionally more fruit than adults.
   Most schools let apples back in after the claim was disputed by
regulators, Uniroyal Chemical Co. and the industry, which cut its
use of Alar to 5 percent of the $1.2 billion-a-year crop since
concerns were first raised in 1985.
   But dozens of other chemicals are routinely used, and the NRDC
considers several of them to be cancer-causing even though, like
Alar, they are legal.
   A recent Louis Harris Poll found that 84.2 percent of Americans
would choose organically grown food if given the choice. But Rice
said that without the chemicals, an apple ``would be a rather
small, gnarled (object) that kind of resembled an apple. It would
be covered with a black fungus scab, infested with various decay
molds which could have natural carcinogens. It would undoubtedly
have codling bud moths and other types of larvae.''
   Washington's 5,000 growers, who produce about half the nation's
apples, spend an average $449 per acre to buy and apply chemicals
each year, said Brooke Peterson, a Washington State University tree
fruit extension agent.
   Many of the chemicals have been identified as harmful to childen
by the NRDC report, which studied chemical residues on food. But
those findings are in dispute, and the Food and Drug
Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of
Agriculture and Surgeon General have all said apples are safe.
   Here is a typical chemical season for Washington apples:
   In early April, before bloom, an organophosphate spray _
Supracide, Lorsban or parathion _ kills the eggs of European red
mites and also controls the spread of San Jose Scale, a pest which
can kill trees.
   In May, growers will apply Guthion, the marketing name for
azinphis methyl, an insecticide that kills the codling moth larva,
which produces worms in apples and is the most damaging pest in the
orchard.
   Also applied at bloom time is Elgetol, a ``thinner'' that burns
off some of the flowers, reducing the number of apples a tree will
bear. Untreated trees will produce huge crops one year and tiny
ones the next to conserve energy. Another thinner is Sevin, an
insecticide made from the chemical carbarylaced Alar as a ``stop-drop,''
which
farmers would spray about a month after bloom to keep apples on
trees; an apple on the ground is worthless. NAA and NAD are less
effective, and there is no substitute for Alar's ability to extend
shelf life, Peterson said.
   Ziram or Captan, fungicides used to battle bull's eye rot, also

<HEAD>Study: Spoonful Of Lecithin Helps Stop Memory Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Find yourself forgetting names and appointments,
mislaying keys and groping for words with increasing frequency as
you grow older?
   Two daily tablespoons of lecithin, a common health-food staple,
could help.
   ``The medical community accepts that there may be a role for
lecithin in aiding memory,'' said neurologist Barry Baumel of the
Neuromedical Centers of South Florida. Baumel and Florence Safford,
a Florida International University social work professor, studied
the effects of lecithin last year.
   In their study, 41 subjects aged 50 to 80 were given two
tablespoons a day of lecithin for four weeks and 20 others received
placebos. They kept logs of memory-loss incidents the seven days
before and after taking the substance.
   Ninety percent of the lecithin group had a significant decrease
in memory lapses, Safford said. The placebo group had 60 percent
more such lapses, though that may have resulted from increased
awareness because of keeping track.
   In addition, 40 percent of lecithin takers ``reported an
improvement in mood, a decrease in anxiety and a general sense of
well being,'' she said. None of the placebo takers reported any
change in mood.
   The study was limited to people with mild memory loss, not those
with the severe symptoms or Alzheimer's disease, for whom lecithin
already has failed to show significant results, Ms. Safford said.
   Lecithin contains lots of B vitamins, particularly one called
choline, known to improve the work of neurotransmitters _ brain
cells that fire electric charges that make our thought processes
work. ``By adding choline to the diet, you are helping this brain
mechanism to fire faster,'' Ms. Safford said.
   ``There may not be dramatic changes. We're not looking at people
suddenly becoming geniuses. But even if it helps a little bit, we
should try it.''
   But choline needs to pass the blood-brain barrier, which keeps
harmful chemicals from damaging the brain. Lecithin, which is
similar to chemicals in the brain, turns out to be an ideal
transporter. ``It has an emulsifier that allows it to pass through
the blood-brain barrier,'' Safford said.
   The lecithin is taken in granule form, mixed with a liquid like
fruit juice or sprinkled on cereal, rather than in capsules, she
said. ``You'd have to take 16 to 20 capsules a day to equal the
same amount as a tablespoon.''
   The only reported ill effect from lecithin was mild diarrhea.

<HEAD>Oat Bran Craze Shows No Signs of Tapering Off, Cereal Makers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nothing helps scenery like ham and eggs, Mark
Twain once remarked, but health-conscious Americans are choosing a
bowl of oat bran instead to brighten up their breakfast horizons.
   Consumer craving for the husk of the oat kernel has opened up a
whole new landscape for cereal makers and bakers, while critics
charge that greedy food companies are unscrupulously capitalizing
on the consumer craze.
   Almost 1{ years have passed since the oat-bran boom began,
ignited by scientific studies indicating that just over an ounce of
oat bran eaten daily as part of a low-fat diet could help prevent
heart attacks.
   Quaker Oats Co., the nation's largest oat miller and maker of
oat bran cereal, is turning out a million pounds of oat bran a
month, compared with a million a year two years ago, and is
introducing a cold oat bran cereal.
   Meanwhile, competitors are jumping on the bran wagon, including
Nabisco Foods Co. of Parsippany, N.J., and St. Louis-based Ralston
Purina Co. Oat bran is going into everything from pancakes to
potato chips.
   The magic of oat bran is that it is one of the best known
sources of soluble fiber, which reduces cholesterol in the blood
and along with it risk of heart disease. Beans like pinto, kidney
and navy; psyllium, a seed grain; rice bran; and fruits with
pectin, like apples and grapefruit, are good sources.
   One of the most important studies of oat bran found that people
with normal blood cholesterol levels who went on a low-fat diet
reduced their cholesterol levels by about 5 percent. But if their
diets included 2 ounces of oat bran or oat meal, the cholesterol
levels dropped 8 percent to 9 percent.
   Every 1 percent decline in blood cholesterol is believed to
result in a 1 percent to 2 percent reduction in heart attack risk,
said dietitian Linda Van Horn, who led the study at Northwestern
University Medical School.
   As little as 34 grams of oat bran _ a little more than an ounce
_ have been found to produce the cholesterol-lowering effect in
scientific studies.
   But that knowledge may be of little help to consumers facing
torrents of advertising hype and a jungle of new oat-bran products.
It can take more than a dozen servings a day of some foods to see
benefits, and some products are full of highly saturated fats that
may drive up blood-cholesterol levels more than the oat bran lowers
them. ``Check the label,'' nutritionists warn.

<HEAD>Newly Discovered Flower Gets Sex Backward</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Botanists thought they had plant sex figured
out. After all, all 248,000 known flowering plants had the pistil _
the female parts _ in the center and the stamen _ the male parts _
outside.
   Biologist Esteban Martinez found a plant that proved little can
be taken for granted in science.
   Lacandonia schismatica, a flower the size of a sesame seed, has
the stamen in the center, surrounded by about 50 pistils. More
study is needed to see what advantage the reversal could have. The
plant appears to reproduce as others do: pollen from the stamen
fertilizes the ovaries, which turn into fruit.
   ``It defies all logic,'' said Warren Stevens, head of research
at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis. A paper on the
discovery will appear in an upcoming issue of Annals of the
Missouri Botanical Garden.
   The plant is a brilliant, almost translucent white, ``like
crystal,'' said Martinez' colleague, Clara Hilda Ramos. As the
ovaries mature, the center turns yellow, then the reddish-brown of
its fruit, so tiny they're like a fine dust.
   Lacking chlorophyll, the plant gets its energy from decomposing
material in the dark, humid jungle with the help of a fungus that
lives in its roots.

<HEAD>An Apple a Day Might Make the Doctor Sick</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>

   If fruit were labeled with ingredients, the
label on apples would list fiber, potassium and vitamin C _ which
are good for you.
   It also might list azinphis methyl, Captan, Supracide,
parathion, Elgetol, Sevin, NAA, NAD, Ziram, diphenylamine, Lorsban
and benzimidazole. These might not be so good, but they're among
dozens of chemicals routinely used to bring apples from fruit trees
to fruit bowls.
   Many have been identified by the Natural Resources Defense
Council as harmful to childen, based on chemical residues on food.
But those findings are in dispute, and federal regulators and the
industry say apples are safe.
   Here is a typical chemical season for Washington apples:
   In early April, an organophosphate spray _ Supracide, Lorsban or
parathion _ kills the eggs of European red mites and also controls
the spread of San Jose Scale, a pest which can kill trees.
   In May, Guthion, the marketing name for azinphis methyl, kills
codling the moth larva, the most damaging pest in the orchard.
   Also applied at bloom time is Elgetol, a ``thinner'' that burns
off some flowers, reducing the number of apples a tree will bear.
Untreated trees will produce huge crops one year and tiny ones the
next to conserve energy. Another thinner is Sevin, an insecticide
made from the chemical carbaryl.
   NAA and NAD have largely replaced Alar to keep apples on trees
longer. They are less effective, and there is no substitute for
Alar's ability to extend shelf life.
   Ziram or Captan, fungicides used to battle bull's eye rot, also
are applied at this time.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Climbing Stairs Not Good Exercise For Fatties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fat people shouldn't climb stairs for
exercise because it can put dangerous stress on their hearts, a
physician says.
   ``Stair climbing is excellent exercise for individuals who are
not overweight. However, stair climbing is not the best way for
overweight people to lose weight,'' said Dr. Marque Hunter, a
University of Texas Medical Branch pulmonary specialist who tested
20 men at or near their ideal weight and 10 who were 30 percent
overweight on a miniature ``escalator'' sold for exercise.
   ``An overweight person must perform an excessive amount of work
to climb stairs even at a modest pace,'' Hunter recently told the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.
   The men were tested at 40, 50, 60 and 70 steps a minute for five
minutes at each speed, going without a rest from one speed to the
next. Heart rates and oxygen consumption were measured throughout.
   Fifty steps a minute is about normal climbing speed, but only
three of the fat men managed to get past 40 steps a minute, Hunter
said. ``Seven of the 10 reached exhaustion in three or four minutes
at the lowest speed. The other three reached exhaustion in the next
five minutes.''
   Nearly all of the other group got to 60 or 70 steps a minund of a nut
and a bolt. You sew on
the nut part into the front of the eye, then screw the bolt in
through this supporting structure,'' said Barron.
   One major problem, is that rejection sets in faster than many
other sorts of plastic implants, he said. ``It's different than an
artificial heart valve or an artificial hip, where it's totally
enclosed. For the patient to see, it has to protrude partly out.
And the body tries to extrude it.''
   Patients must use an antibiotic ointment on the lens and eyelid
at night, with a pad to protect the lens and ``close'' the eye for
sleep. In the morning, they clean it off with hydrogen peroxide on
a cotton swab. Some implants can last for years, but complications
usually set in after a year or two.

<NOTE>Doctor Claims First Test For Premenstrual Syndrome</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gynecologist says he's developed a test to
detect whether moodiness is a result of premenstrual syndrome, but
others say his work is promising although the sample is too small
to be conclusive.
   Dr. Edward M. Portman, whose clinic in Madison, Wis.,
specializes in PMS and menopausal care, told the Federation of
American Societies for Experimental Biology that he has found low
levels of the antibody for leuteinizing hormone _ the hormone
controlling ovulation _ among PMS sufferers.
   Portman said his is the first biological test for PMS, which is
estimated to affect anywhere from one-tenth to half of all women.
   ``It would be wonderful if we had a test like that,'' said Dr.
Patricia K. Branning, a New Orleans gynecologist. A test would help
doctors convince women whose depression was not due to PMS that
they needed to try other treatment.
   She and gynecologist Mary Francis Gardner said Portman's sample
_ 456 women with PMS and 65 symptom-free controls _ was too small
for conclusive results.
   ``PMS is such a very diffuse problem, it's hard to deal with. It
has such protean manifestations,'' said Branning. ``I think you
aways wonder if it's not more than one thing that we've lumped
together under one heading.''
   Symptoms include depression, distorted thinking, angry
outbursts, headache, food binges and bloating in the weeks between
ovulation and menstruation.
   Without a test, Portman said, doctors must see whether a woman's
symptoms fit PMS and ask her to chart them against her period for
several months.
   ``We are at the very embryonic stage of what we have,'' said
Portman. ``We have a high and statistic significant correlation of
antibody levels and PMS. Hopefully, over the next few years we can
unravel more of this.''

   Americans' personal income shot up 1 percent
last month while consumer spending advanced at a more restrained
pace, boosting the savings rate to its highest level in nearly
three years, the government said.
   Personal income, bolstered by strong growth in employment and
wages, posted two straight solid gains, rising to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $4.32 trillion last month after surging 1.7
percent in January, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
   But when it comes to spending that money, consumers have been
showing more restraint. Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.5
percent in February to an annual rate of $3.38 trillion after

   Strikebound Eastern Airlines, nearly idle while
other carriers handled busy Easter weekend traffic, plans to return
to federal court today hoping to have its veteran pilots ordered
back to work.
   As a backstop, the Miami-based carrier also plans to open a
school for its first group of newly hired replacement pilots.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Davis scheduled new hearings in Miami
to determine whether the 3-week-old walkout by Eastern's 3,600
pilots is a strike in sympathy with machinists, as the pilots
claim, or is a separate strike seekings its own aims, as Eastern
management contends.

   Continental Airlines has moved swiftly to capture

Eastern Airlines, but the company disputes union claims that its
moves are part of a master plan to grow at Eastern's expense.
   Amid its own labor problems _ flight attendants on Friday ended
a four-day walkout that had little impact on service _ Continental
has added flights on routes vacated by Eastern, taken over Eastern
gates at some airports and waged an aggressive ad campaign to
attract more East Coast passengers.
   Industry observers say the Houston-based airline has gained
passengers and revenue, but no more so than other competitors since
Eastern virtually shut down after the March 4 strike by its
Machinists union members and subsequent walkouts by pilots and

   The number of working oil and gas rigs jumped
this week by 26 to total 766, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   Last week the rig count fell by three to total 740. A year ago,
the total was 935, the company said Monday.
   The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker that merged with
Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the
rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma had the biggest
increase with nine additional rigs, followed by Kansas and
Louisiana, four each; California and North Dakota, three each, and
Colorado and Michigan, one each.
   New Mexico saw the only decline with two while Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wyoming were unchanged for the week.

<HEAD>Shamrock Holdings Abandons Bitter Takeover Bid for Polaroid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than a week after a Delaware court
temporarily stymied its chances of acquiring Polaroid Corporation,
Shamrock Holdings Inc. announced today that it is abandoning its
eight-month, often bitter battle to take over the instant
photography company.
   Polaroid officials said they have entered into an agreement with
Shamrock under which Shamrock will terminate its tender offer and
proxy contest and both companies will end all litigation between
them.
   Shamrock, based in Burbank, Calif., and its affiliate companies
have also agreed not to attempt to gain control of the
Cambridge-based Polaroid for at least 10 years.
   ``We are very pleased that Polaroid and Shamrock have reached an
agreement that will serve the best interests of all Polaroid's
shareholders by freeing Polaroid of the huge future costs of
fighting a disruptive takeover bid and enable all of us to devote
our full energy, creativity and talent to building and realizing
Polaroid's enormous inherent values,'' said I. MacAllister Booth,
president and chief executive officer of Polaroid.
   The settlement includes a provision that Polaroid distribute to
shareholders either through dividends or stock repurchases part of
the after-tax proceeds from a copyright infringement suit against
Kodak.
   Under the agreement, Polaroid will distribute a portion equal to
at least a quarter of the proceeds over $750 million up to $1.2
billion or 33{ percent of proceeds between $1.2 billion and $2.4
billion or 50 percent of proceeds above $2.4 billion.
   The amount that will be distributed will be determined after it
is decided how much Kodak must pay Polaroid. A trial to determine
damages from Kodak is scheduled to begin in Boston next month.
   Polaroid has also bought $5 million worth of advertising on
Shamrock's radio and television stations. The company has also
reimbursed Shamrock for $20 million for out-of-pocket expenses
stemming from the litigation and Shamrock's tender offer.
   Shamrock, which offered $45 a share for Polaroid stock, was
thwarted Thursday by a Delaware court decision clearing the way for
Polaroid to repurchase 16 million shares of its own stock for $50
each.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today set a hearing on a key issue
in Eastern Airline's efforts to force its pilots back to work,
while the strikebound carrier began its first class in training
replacement pilots.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Davis said this morning he would hear
arguments Thursday on whether the pilots' strike was only a refusal
to cross Machinists' picket lines, or was a primary strike, which
could be illegal under the Railway Labor Act.
   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta had asked the judge
for a decision on the issue, which is central to Eastern's legal
efforts to end the 3-week-old walkout.
   ``As I see it, I need to make a determination whether refusal to
cross the picket line is a `pretext,''' the judge said today. ``I
must determine what the appeals court means about `pretext.'''
   Air Line Pilots Association attorney James Linsey asked for
Thursday's hearing during the judge's meeting with lawyers.
   ``We don't think that Eastern has shown in the previous hearings
that ALPA's action was a pretext,'' Linsey said.
   ALPA claims the Railway Labor Act gives its members the right to
show sympathy for the striking Machinists. The appeals court
agreed, but added that ``a claim of a sympathy strike cannot be
used as a pretext to shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear
violation of the Railway Labor Act.''
   Eastern lawyer David Ross said today that the judge already had
enough evidence, unsuccessfully arguing for Davis to immediately
forward to the appeals judges the finding that the pilots' walkout
was not allowed.
   Meanwhile, Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said the first six-week
training class for about 40 replacement pilots was beginning today
with an organizational session. All but 200 of Eastern's 3,600
pilots have refused to work since the strike began March 4.
   ``I have heard that they're even coming from other airlines,''
Ashlock said of the new pilots. ``They're coming over because they
can make seniority faster.''
   Eastern has been operating only about 10 percent of its daily
pre-strike schedule of 1,040 flights, concentrating on routes from
the airline's Miami hub to the Northeast and from Florida to the
Caribbean, which were the most heavily traveled on Eastern's past,
said spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   The pilots union continued to play down Eastern's efforts to
hire replacement pilots, saying there simply aren't enough pilots
to fill available airline slots, especially at Eastern and
Continental Airlines, which are operated by Frank Lorenzo's
Houston-based Texas Air Corp.
   ``Young pilots know better than to go to work for Frank
Lorenzo,'' said Capt. Jack Saux, a Delta Airlines pilot and
chairman of ALPA's education committee. Saux said in a news release
that he and other ALPA members have been meeting with pilots from
regional airlines and corporations as well as student pilots.

   General Nutrition Inc. said today it has
retained two investment banking firms to explore ways to increase
the value of its stock, including selling or recapitalizing the
company.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Jerry D. Horn said no commitment
has been made to any course recommended by Lazard Freres &amp; Co. or
C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.
   The health food retailer, meanwhile, reported fourth-qaurter
profit of $4.9 million, or 16 cents per share, on sales of $116
million.
   A year earlier, GNC lost $3.9 million, or 12 cents per share, on
sales of $114 million.
   Horn said he is confident of achieving 1989 per share earnings
of 50 to 60 cents.
   Net income for the year that ended Feb. 4, totaled $12.6
million, or 39 cents per share, on sales of $361 million, compared
to 1988 earnings of $404,000, or a penny per share, on sales of
$350.9 million.
   ``Three years ago we began the restructuring process of General
Nutrition. The operational portion of that restructuring has been
substantially completed with the transformation of the company's
retail business from a commodities orientation to one of specialty
retailing, with the 1988 consolidation of our manufacturing
operations and the recent sale of our mail order unit,'' Horn said.
   ``We now are in a position to focus our efforts on further
increasing value through restructuring on the financial side,'' he
said.
   GNC says it is the nation's largest seller of vitamin and
mineral supplements and nutritional, personal care and
health-related products.

   The stock market showed some spotty gains in
slow trading today against a background of confusion about the
economic outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.85 to 2,250.89 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers and losers were evenly balanced in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 578 up, 569 down and
554 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 35.68 million shares at
midmorning.
   The market has drawn some support lately from suggestions by
analysts that the Federal Reserve may bide its time for a while
before deciding whether to tighten credit further.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic
Advisers, said in a weekend interview that he believes interest
rates are close to peaking out. He predicted lower rates later in
the year.
   But worries have also increased of late that subsiding interest
rates might be accompanied by a slowing of economic activity
significant enough to qualify as a recession.
   In some scripts now being written on the Street, that would mean
that corporate profits are also peaking out about now.
   American Medical International led the active list and jumped 4
to 21~. An investor group made a $24-a-share buyout offer for the
company.
   Exxon was unchanged at 44{, recovering from some early selling
on news of the huge oil spill that occurred when an Exxon Shipping
Co. tanker ran aground Friday near Valdez, Alaska.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .12 to 162.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   Crude oil futures opened sharply higher today in
a rally oil traders and analysts predicted would result from last
week's closing of an Alaskan harbor to contain a massive oil spill.
   The Valdez, Alaska, harbor was closed Friday after 240,000
barrels of oil spilled from an Exxon Shipping Co. oil tanker that
ran aground on a reef south of the port city. It is being called
the largest oil spill in U.S. history.
   Valdez is the only terminal that handles crude oil produced on
the North Slope of Alaska, the source of more than 25 percent of
U.S. production.
   The volume of Alaskan crude that has been temporarily disrupted
is more than 3{ times the amount of North Sea production shut down
during recent months because of a series of accidents.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, was up 57 cents from Thursday's close at
$20.72 per 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   U.S. commodity markets were closed Friday for the Good Friday
holiday.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also rose sharply. April
unleaded gasoline was 59.95 cents per gallon, up 1.93 cents from
Thursday's close, and heating oil was 57.70 cents a gallon, up 1.18
cents from Thursday.
   Most Alaskan crude goes to West coast refineries, which will be
scambling for supplies, said Sam F. Willson Jr., senior vice
president of the Coastal Corp. He expects prices to move higher
immediately and to climb sharply if the harbor remains closed past
the middle of the week.
   ``If it is down all next week, it is going to drive prices up
quite a bit. There is nothing else available to take the place of
Alaskan North Slope crude for those West Coast refineries,''
Willson said.
   The U.S. Coast Guard has not indicated how long the Valdez
harbor will be closed, but no ships will be allowed to leave until
all remaining oil has been pumped out of the Exxon tanker, said
John Ratterman, spokesman for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the
operator of the TransAlaska Pipeline and the Valdez terminal.
   The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez, carrying 1.2 million barrels
of North Slope crude, ran onto a reef 25 miles from port early
Friday after swinging out of a traffic lane to avoid ice. Valdez is
at the southern end of the 800-mile Alaska oil pipeline.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in
reaction to forecasts for rain in some of the nation's major crop
areas.
   The corn and soybean markets registered the sharpest early
losses amid predictions for thunderstorms in the Midwest during the
next few days and above-average precipitation in the region next
week.
   The central and southern Great Plains also were expected to
receive rain tonight and Tuesday, which would help the maturing
winter wheat crop.
   There was little news of export business in the market this
morning.
   ``With a lot of the world not working today because of people
still celebrating the Easter holiday, there's not much here in the
way of demand,'' said Dale Gustafson, a grain-market analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Prices likely will be influenced this week by position-evening
ahead of Friday's Agriculture Department report on quarterly grain
stocks and spring planting intentions, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.29 a bushel; corn was 1\

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCorp, one of Texas' largest banking companies,
today announced it would seek protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, in response to involuntary
bankruptcy petitions filed against it.
   The troubled bank holding company, which last fall stopped
making interest and principal payments on about $470 million of
debt while it attempted to recapitalize, said three noteholders
last week filed a bankruptcy court petition in New York seeking to
have MCorp involuntarily sold off to pay creditor claims.
   MCorp spokesman George A. McCane said the company learned Friday
about the filings for the involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy
liquidation.
   ``MCorp deeply regrets that those noteholders ignored our pleas
not to take premature and unnecessary action,'' Gene H. Bishop,
MCorp's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a prepared
statement.
   Bishop said he hoped the action by a very small number of
noteholders seeking to force liquidation of MCorp would not disrupt
or interfere with discussions between prospective investors and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on terms of a recapitalization plan.
   Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, MCorp would be
protected from creditor claims while it reorganizes under
bankruptcy court supervision and works out a plan to pay debts.
   MCorp's Chapter 11 filing would supercede the Chapter 7
petition, which calls for the total sale of the company to satisfy
creditors.
   MCorp spokesman McCane said the company has not yet indicated
when it would ask the bankruptcy court to convert the involuntary
liquidation request to a Chapter 11 reorganization case. MCorp has
20 days to convert the petitions once the company is served with
them.
   The company's individual MBanks aren't involved, and the filings
should not affect the company's business, Bishop said.
   ``We want all of the depositors, customers, employees and
suppliers of MBanks to know that our 86 offices will remain open
for business as usual,'' Bishop said.
   Since last fall, Bishop said, MCorp representatives have met
several times with noteholders and urged them not to take action
prematurely despite the moratorium on payment of principal and
interst on borrowed money while the company proceeded with efforts
to recapitalize.
   The Wall Street Journal identified the three creditors who filed
the Chapter 7 petitions as S.N. Phelps &amp; Co., a Greenwich, Conn.,
bond broker that claims to hold $2 million principal amount in
MCorp debentures; and Janice M. Eberhardt and Carol R. James, each
of whom claims to hold $5,000 in debentures.
   I. Walton Bader, an attorney for the holders, told the Journal
his clients decided to file for Chapter 7 liquidation for fear that
MCorp would be forced to pump its holding company assets into the
failing MBanks, thereby putting the money out of reach of creditors.
   The Journal quoted analysts as saying MCorp's move complicates
the FDIC's efforts to arrange a sale of MCorp. The FDIC had set an
April 3 deadline for bids to acquire MCorp.
   The FDIC has the authority to sell or otherwise dispose of
insolvent banks once they have been closed by the U.S. Comptroller
of the Currency, but a bankruptcy filing would make any plan to
sell the company subject to a bankruptcy judge's approval.
   FDIC records show that 25 banks owned by MCorp posted a $213
million fourth-quarter loss and lost $903 million in 1988.

   The U.S. trustee administering the Eastern
Airlines bankruptcy said today he is considering about a dozen
candidates for examiner in the complex case, and sources said the
list includes former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and top
securities fraud lawyer Leon Silverman.
   U.S. Trustee Harold Jones said in a telephone interview he hopes
to make a decision by late this week or early next on his choice of
a bankruptcy examiner for Eastern, whom he will recommend to U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton Lifland. An examiner would have broad
powers over the strike-crippled Miami-based airline.
   Jones declined to name people on the list. But the candidates
include former secretary of defense Frank Carlucci and Leon
Silverman, who represented some claimants in Manville Corp.'s
Chapter 11 proceeding starting in August 1982, sources close to the
situation said today. The sources spoke on condition they not be
identified.
   Silverman, a Washington-based securities lawyer, also is one of
the lead defense attorneys for imprisoned insider trader Ivan F.
Boesky.
   Carlucci is now vice chairman and managing director of The
Carlyle Group, an investment banking firm in Washington, D.C.
   Carlucci's secretary said he was unavailable to comment.
Silverman said he wasn't aware he was on the list.
   On Thursday, Lifland said he would appoint an examiner with
sweeping powers who would try to mediate the bitter dispute between
Eastern and its unions. The examiner also will review financial
transactions between Eastern, its parent Texas Air Corp. and sister
carrier Continental Airlines.
   Eastern workers struck the airline March 4 and it sought
bankruptcy court protection March 9.
   Jones said the candidates under consideration were recommended
to him either by Eastern management, the airline's unions or the
committee of 15 Eastern creditors which he named last Wednesday. In
addition, some of the people he is interviewing put themselves
forward for the position, he said.
   Jones said the ideal examiner would be ``someone who can play
the role of statesman.''

   American Medical International Inc.
is pondering a $1.68 billion offer to take the company private as
well as a restructuring plan by senior management that would keep
it publicly traded.
   ``No determination has been made to sell the company or engage
in any other transaction,'' the hospital company said in a
statement, adding that it appointed a committee of six outside
directors to evaluate the proposals.
   Both proposals were revealed Sunday.
   The $1.68 billion debt-financed takeover plan, proposed by
minority shareholder Dr. M. Lee Pearce of Miami and and an
investment group, offers $24 a share for American Medical stock,
including $20 to $22 in cash and the remainder in securities. Under
this offer, the buyers also would assume some $1.4 billion in
long-term debt.
   Pearce, who already owns nearly 10 percent of the company's 70
million shares, is making the offer with Shamrock Investments, a
private Los Angeles investment firm. It is unrelated to Shamrock
Holdings Inc., the investment firm controlled by Roy E. Disney.
   American Medical also said it is pondering a restructuring
proposal, which it didn't describe in detail. That proposal,
developed by an unidentified investment banking firm and senior
managers, would keep the company in public hands, and ``could
provide over a six- to nine-month period total shareholder value of
between $25 and $29 per share, including a special cash divided,''
the company said.
   The company said its recently named chairman and chief
executive, Richard A. Gilleland, is officially neutral on the two
proposals, which were presented to American Medical's board on
Thursday.
   The company has been subject to takeover speculation because of
disappointing earnings and the depressed value of its shares, which
reportedly led to last summer's forced resignation of Walter L.
Weisman as chief executive.
   A statement from Shamrock said the investors ``think we can do
far better if not subjected to the quarterly pressures of
investors.''
   American Medical reported Friday that its earnings declined to
$18.1 million, or 26 cents per share, for the three months ending
Feb. 28, on revenues of $678.2 million. During the same period a
year earlier, earnings were $24.1 million, or 30 cents per share,
on revenues of $766.1 million.
   The decline in earnings was attributed primarily to the sale of
36 hospitals to an employee-owned company, Epic Healthcare Group of
Dallas. AMI retains 55 hospitals and psychiatric treatment centers
in the United States and 20 facilities overseas.

<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers gather this week to
review a recently-strengthened world oil market and the impact of
the cartel's strategy for cutting production to help boost crude
prices.
   Eight ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries were scheduled to begin talks Wednesday at cartel
headquarters in Vienna.
   Subroto, secretary-general of the 13-nation organization, told
reporters last week that the ministers _ members of a monitoring
committee _ would review the market and make certain the new accord
was working well.
   The cartel agreed last November on a new quota system limiting
each member's output in the first half of this year in an attempt
to support a price of $18 a barrel. The overall production level
was set at 18.5 million barrels a day, well under the actual output
at year's end.
   Many analysts had been skeptical the OPEC countries would comply
with their quotas, but now say most nations generally have met
their targets.
   ``They've done better adhering to (their quotas) than most had
expected,'' said Fergus MacLeod, oil analyst at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd in London.
   ``Prices have looked amazingly good,'' he said.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC
reaching $17.50 a barrel last week, up more than $5 from late
November when the output deal was struck.
   In U.S. futures trading, the May contract for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, was up 45 cents at $20.60 a
barrel Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Although Monday's price was inflated by speculation stemming
from the closing of the Alaskan pipeline at Valdez due to a major
offshore oil spill, it still reflected the crude's sharp surge from
the two-year low of $12.60 reached last Oct. 5.
   Subroto said, ``My feeling is that there seems to be a bullish
expectation in the market to see a strong price level. So we will
enter the second quarter, which is usually a weak quarter, with a
stronger demand than had been foreseen.''
   Independent producing nations also were expected to curb exports
by a total of less than 300,000 barrels daily in the April-June
quarter to support OPEC's efforts.
   The Soviet Union, the world's largest crude producer, said it
would join the cuts in the second quarter, when prices generally
decline with the onset of warmer weather in oil-importing countries.
   With the good wintertime results, the ministers also likely will
hold initial discussions on production levels for the second half
of this year. Those quotas won't be set until a full meeting of all
OPEC ministers June 5 in Vienna.
   Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, told the
Middle East Economic Survey that OPEC should boost its production
ceiling by 1.5 million barrels a day to 20 million barrels in the
last six months of the year.
   He said in an interview published Monday that the cartel's price
target should be maintained at $18 a barrel.
   Since the production accord, OPEC has reported that 12 of the
nations complied with the agreement in January and February by
curtailing output for the international market.
   The cartel said the 12 nations pumped 17.4 million barrels of
oil a day in February, compared with the daily ceiling of 17.51
million barrels set for those dozen countries.
   The statement said the United Arab Emirates had not reported
supply figures in January or February. That country persistently
has exceeded its daily quota of 988,000 barrels. Analysts estimate
its current production at more than 1.5 million barrels a day.
   Ministers who form the monitoring committee represent Algeria,
Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
Other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and the United
Arab Emirates.

   Scientists are experimenting with new uses of
chemical agents to aid in the cleanup of oil spills, but mechanical
methods such as vacuum pumps, ``skimmer'' boats and absorbant pads
are still the most widely used.
   At the spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound, the volume of
crude oil in the water is so large _ 10.1 million gallons _ that
mechanical means are being supplemented with the use of approved
chemicals to disperse some of the oil on the surface.
   Exxon Shipping Co., owner of the tanker that spilled the oil
Friday near the port of Valdez, also planned to burn ``fingers'' of
the oil slick by igniting them with a laser.
   Experiments also are being conducted with the use of a chemical
agent that, rather than dispersing the oil on the water's surface,
causes it to draw together to make it easier to remove with vacuum
pumps, said Harry Schultz, a cleanup expert with the Coast Guard in
Washington.
   Under the best circumstances, some oil remains in the water
after a spill cleanup operation. Wind and wave action emulsify some
of it. Some is consumed by bacteria.
   In an ocean spill, oil on the water's surface can be herded into
one area by skimmer boats that use wing-like devices to guide it.
Vacuum machines then pump it onto floating barges, which take it
ashore in tanks and transfer it to trucks.
   For oil that has washed ashore or entered shallow-water areas in
which skimmer boats cannot be used, cleanup crews can use a string
of absorbant pads that soak up the crude.
   A variety of chemicals, usually in liquid form, also can be used
to break up sections of the oil slick. Some chemical agents are
used to make the oil sink to the bottom, where it poses no direct
threat to birds.
   Burning agents also are used, although questions have been
raised about whether the advantages brought by these and other
chemical agents outweigh the disadvantages of adding more
pollutants to the water or air.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Plunge On Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed sharply lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for wet weather
in the nation's major crop-growing areas.
   Further selling was attributed to technical factors and to
increasingly bearish expectations for Friday's planted-acreage
estimate and quarterly grain stocks report from the Agriculture
Department.
   The soybean market appeared to lead the decline, with much of
the selling in that market stemming from Friday's 6-to-10-day
forecast from the National Weather Service predicting above-average
rainfall March 30-April 3 in most of the central and all of the
eastern United States.
   Oats for May and July delivery fell the permitted daily limit of
10 cents a bushel on rain forecasts.
   ``There seems to be just a perception that the weather is
getting better and it comes in a very timely fashion for oats,
which are just getting ready to be seeded,'' said Dale Gustafson, a
market analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 4\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.27{ a bushel; corn was 6} cents
to 7} cents lower with May at $2.71 a bushel; oats were 9\ cents to
10 cents lower with May at $1.95\ a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents
to 15{ cents lower with May at $7.69 a bushel.

   Stock prices nudged ahead in slow trading today
amid confusion about the economic outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.53 to 2,253.57
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers held a narrow lead over losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 731 up, 671 down and
519 unchanged.
   The market has drawn some support lately from suggestions by
analysts that the Federal Reserve may bide its time for a while
before deciding whether to tighten credit further.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic
Advisers, said in a weekend interview that he believes interest
rates are close to peaking out. He predicted lower rates later in
the year.
   But worries have also increased of late that subsiding interest
rates might be accompanied by a slowing of economic activity
significant enough to qualify as a recession.
   In some scripts now being written on the Street, that would mean
that corporate profits are also peaking out about now.
   American Medical International led the active list and jumped 3}
to 21|. An investor group made a $24-a-share buyout offer for the
company.
   Other hospital-management stocks moved up in sympathy. Humana
gained 1[ to 29} and National Medical Enterprises added ] to 27~.
   Polaroid fell 4} to 35}. The company succeeded in fending off
the takeover advances of Shamrock Holdings Inc.
   Exxon was unchanged at 44{, recovering from some early selling
on news of the huge oil spill that occurred when an Exxon Shipping
Co. tanker ran aground Friday near Valdez, Alaska.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.41 to 163.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>Shamrock Holdings Abandons Bitter Takeover Bid for Polaroid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. abandoned its
eight-month-old struggle to acquire Polaroid Corp. Monday, less
than a week after a Delaware court dealt the company a fatal blow
in its attempt to gain control of the instant photography giant.
   Polaroid officials said they entered into an agreement with
Shamrock under which Shamrock would terminate its $3.2 billion
tender offer and proxy contest and both sides would end litigation
resulting from the Shamrock bid.
   Shamrock, based in Burbank, Calif., and its affiliate companies
also agreed not to attempt to gain control of Polaroid for at least
10 years.
   Shamrock, which offered $45 a share for Polaroid stock, was
stymied Thursday by a Delaware court decision clearing the way for
Polaroid to repurchase 16 million shares at a premium price of $50
each.
   ``We are disappointed and frustrated by the Delaware courts,''
Shamrock president Stanley Gold said Monday. ``It's certainly not
good news for folks who are trying to do what we did.''
   Some analysts said the Delaware ruling allowing the Polaroid
purchase could signal a new era in the kinds of defensive
strategies planned by takeover targets.
   ``Up until now, attacking companies have been able to peel away
layer by layer of companies' defenses,'' said Brian Fernandez,
managing director of Brean Murray, Foster Securities Inc. in New
York. ``This is one of the first ways anyone's found to be
successful.''
   As part of its defense, Polaroid placed an estimated one-third
of its shares in friendly hands through the stock buyback, an
employee stock ownership plan and the sale of preferred shares to
Corporate Partners L.P., an investor group formed to help companies
fight hostile takeover bids.
   The moves were designed to frustrate Shamrock's attempt to
unseat the Polaroid board at the company's annual meeting and its
tender offer.
   Under the settlement, Polaroid will distribute to shareholders
part of the after-tax proceeds from a copyright infringement suit
against Eastman Kodak. A trial to determine damages from Kodak is
scheduled to begin in Boston next month.
   Polaroid also bought $5 million worth of advertising on
Shamrock's radio and television stations and reimbursed Shamrock
for $20 million in expenses connected with the litigation and
tender offer.
   Shamrock accumulated 4.95 million shares of Polaroid during the
takeover battle and tendered all of those shares before the
midnight deadline last Thursday.
   According to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Shamrock paid an average price of about $31 a share for
its stake in Polaroid. By selling 27 percent of its shares back to
Polaroid for $50 each, Shamrock can expect to receive approximately
$67 million.
   Shamrock's remaining 3.6 million shares of Polaroid would
conservatively be worth more than $130 million, yielding a profit
of approximately $42 million before legal fees, financing costs and
other takeover expenses.
   Polaroid said the final number of shares tendered under the
buyback offer, and the definitive pro-rating formula, will be
determined April 4. Payments will go out to stockholders as soon as
possible after that date, the company said.

   Former defense secretary Frank Carlucci and Wall
Street attorney Leon Silverman are among those being considered for
the influential role of examiner in the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy
reorganization, sources close to the situation said Monday.
   The examiner, who will have what experts say is an unusually
broad mandate for overseeing a bankruptcy case, will be charged
with reviewing Eastern business transactions and mediating disputes
among the parties involved in the case, including strike-bound
Eastern, its unions and its creditors.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton Lifland, who is overseeing
Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization, on Thursday ordered the
appointment of an examiner with expanded powers, saying it was in
the public's interest to do so.
   Eastern sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors on
March 9 becuase of a cash drain stemming from a strike by its
Machinists, pilots and flight attendants that has virtually
paralyzed the Miami-based airline.
   U.S. Trustee Harold Jones, who is administering the Eastern
bankruptcy case, said he was considering about a dozen candidates
for examiner in the complex proceeding. He said he hoped to decide
by late this week or early next week on an examiner to recommend to
Lifland.
   In addition to mediating disputes among parties in the case, the
examiner will review financial transactions between Eastern, its
parent Texas Air Corp. and sister carrier Continental Airlines.
Eastern's unions claim that Texas Air has been attempting to funnel
Eastern assets to Continental, a non-union carrier.
   The ideal examiner would be ``someone who can play the role of
statesman,'' Jones said in a telephone interview Monday.
   Jones declined to name people on the list. But the sources, who
asked not to be identified, said the candidates include Carlucci
and Silverman, who represented some claimants in Manville Corp.'s
Chapter 11 proceeding that began in August 1982 and ended this past
January.
   Silverman, a securities lawyer, is one of the lead defense
attorneys for imprisoned inside trader Ivan F. Boesky.
   Carlucci, also a former chairman of the National Security
Council, now is vice chairman and managing director of Carlyle
Group, an investment banking firm based in Washington, D.C.
   Carlucci's secretary said he was unavailable to comment and
Silverman himself declined comment Monday.
   Silverman ``was a very effective and important part of the
resolution of our bankruptcy,'' said a Manville spokesman who
wished not to be identified further, speaking from the company's
headquarters in Denver.
   Jones said the candidates under consideration were recommended
to him either by Eastern management, the airline's unions or the
committee of 15 Eastern creditors he appointed last week. Some of
the candidates put themselves forward for the position, he said.
   ``It's a mediator with clout,'' said William Ury, associate
director of the program on negotiation at Harvard Law School.
   Bruce Simon, an attorney for the Air Line Pilots Association,
said the unions are looking for ``a strong public figure beholden
to no specific interest, including our own.''
   The examiner will need to ``bang the parties' heads together to
see if a solution can be achieved here,'' Simon said.
   Harvey Miller, Eastern's lead bankruptcy attorney, said the
company would like an examiner who ``has somewhat of a national
reputation,'' is impartial and has a strong legal or financial
background.

<HEAD>Troubled Buffalo Thrift Names New President</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goldome, one of the nation's largest
thrifts, named a new president Monday and said its chief executive
officer, Ross B. Kenzie, would soon retire.
   The moves come after the bank reported a $119 million loss in
1988 and only a month after it named a new chairman, Jeremy Jacobs,
who is the company's largest shareholder.
   Kenzie, 58, will retire June 30, the bank said. His apparent
successor is Thomas A. Cooper, the former head of Bank of America.
   Cooper was named Goldome's president and chief operating
officer, effective April 1, replacing Paul E. Ruch, who was elected
vice chairman.
   A replacement was not immediately named for Kenzie's post of
chief executive officer. But analysts said Cooper would likely be
named CEO later.
   ``Tom Cooper's extensive banking background and his management
experience will be important assets in Goldome's ongoing
restructuring,'' Jacobs said.
   Cooper, 52, is a former president and chief operating officer of
the Bank of America. While at Bank of America, Cooper headed a
massive restructuring project that cut more than 10,000 jobs.
   Since 1987, he has been chairman and chief executive officer of
INVEST, a brokerage and investment firm.
   ``It looks as if things are going to tighten up at Goldome,''
said Henry Peltz of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods in New York.
   He said Cooper was brought in to bring Goldome's expenses under
control.
   ``It will be a painful job, but presumably that's what he's good
at,'' he said.
   Jacobs, who heads the privately held Delaware North Cos. in
Buffalo, has vowed to change the bank's market approach, avoid
risky undertakings, and emphasize traditional businesses.
   Kenzie presided over the bank's rapid growth from a regional
savings bank into a national financial services company engaged in
non-traditional businesses such as the financing of leveraged
buyouts and commercial lending.
   Under his leadership the Buffalo Savings Bank's assets increased
to $15 billion from $3 billion, it changed its name to Goldome,
built a headquarters building in Buffalo, bought troubled savings
banks in New York and Florida, and became a publicly held company.
   ``Ross Kenzie built a small western New York savings bank into
one of the largest and best known thrift institutions in the United
States,'' Jacobs said.
   Kenzie joined the bank as president and chief operating officer
in 1979. He became chief executive officer in 1980 and chairman in
1983. He was replaced as chairman by Jacobs in February.
   Before joining Goldome, Kenzie was an executive vice president
with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York.

   The dollar headed sharply higher Monday against
all key currencies, particularly the Japanese yen, in thin
post-holiday trading.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $390.00 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $2 from
late Thursday.
   There was virtually no trading on Friday in celebration of Good
Friday. The European financial markets were closed for the Easter
holiday until Tuesday, while many U.S. financial centers had scaled
down operations Monday.
   Earl I. Johnson, a currency trader with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago, said the dollar's advance was mainly at the yen's expense.
The yen declined partly in reaction to a political scandal in Japan.
   ``This is really a story of weak yen, more so than a strong
dollar,'' he said.
   Johnson said higher oil prices due the massive oil spill in
Alaska also supported the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed at
132.30 yen, up 1.03 yen from Friday's close. Later, in New York,
the dollar stood at 132.70 yen, up from 131.475 yen Thursday.
   The dollar rose against the British pound, with sterling
fetching $1.7085, vs. $1.7195 Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.8834 West German marks, up from 1.87375;
1.6415 Swiss francs, up from 1.6275; 1.19305 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1905; 6.36375 French francs, up from 6.3400; and 1,381.25
Italian lire, up from 1,376.88.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $391.10 a troy ounce, down from $392.80 Thursday.
   Silver prices also declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery finished at $5.946 a troy ounce, compared with
$6.008 Thursday.

<HEAD>Japan's Major Bank-Credit Card May Deal in U.S. Through BofA</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Dwane is cq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of America is negotiating with Japan's
largest bank card company for the exclusive right to honor the JCB
credit card at more than 100,000 outlets in the United States, bank
officials announced Monday.
   ``This historic agreement would allow Japanese tourists and
business travelers visiting the United States to use their most
popular credit card throughout our extensive merchant base,'' said
Joe Fontana, senior vice president in charge of merchant services
at the San Francisco-based bank.
   Bank of America says it can perform all sales and servicing of
JCB International Co. Ltd. card accounts through its existing
credit card programs and will bill merchants for JCB use through
Bank of America statements.
   Under the deal, no other bank can honor the JCB card in the
United States.
   JCB's six sponsoring Japanese banks, which are not prohibited
from setting up their own servicing programs with U.S. merchants,
currently have no such programs. Through independent arrangements,
JCB is accepted at about 20,000 U.S. businesses, most of them on
the West Coast and in Hawaii.
   ``This deal will greatly expand the utility of our card for our
holder dramatically, both for visitors and Japanese nationals now
living or working in the United States,'' said JCB Dwane Krumme in
Los Angeles.
   Fontana indicated BofA's move is the first step toward expanding
merchants' ability to accept various bank cards without having to
arrange service programs with each sponsoring company.
   ``We feel this will be a significant step in providing merchants
with a convenient, consolidated service for different card types,''
said Fontana.
   JCB is Japan's largest bank-related credit card issuer and has a
card base of more than 13 million and a merchant network of more
than 1 million establishments worldwide. The JCB card currently is
accepted in 102 countries and territories, although most of the
company's business remains limited to Asia.
   Fontana said the agreement is expected to be signed within 90
days and would apply to 60,000 businesses with 100,000 outlets
nationwide. If approved, BofA will be the first major overseas
partner of JCB.

   Stock prices struggled higher Monday in the
slowest trading of the year amid some tentative hopes that interest
rates might turn downward soon.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 49.10 points
last week, rebounded 14.82 points to 2,257.86.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
767 up, 655 down and 530 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 112.96 million
shares, down from 153.75 million last Thursday and the lightest
total since a 110.63 million-share day on Dec. 28.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 135 million shares.
   The market has drawn some support lately from suggestions by
analysts that the Federal Reserve may bide its time for a while
before deciding whether to tighten credit further.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic

   Sears Roebuck gained [ to 42{ in active trading. The company

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

<HEAD>Crop Futures Plunge On Rain Forecasts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for April showers in the
nation's major crop-growing areas.
   On other markets, orange juice futures surged for the second
straight session; energy futures advanced sharply; precious metals
were lower and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 4\ cents lower with the contract
for delivery in May at $4.27\ a bushel; corn was 6\ cents to 7}
cents lower with May at $2.71{ a bushel; oats were 9\ cents to 10
cents lower with May at $1.95\ a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to
16 cents lower with May at $7.68{ a bushel.
   The selloff in the grain and soybean markets was widely seen as
a reaction to Friday's 6-to-10-day National Weather Service
forecast for above-average rainfall March 30-April 3 in most of the
central and all of the eastern United States.
   The winter wheat crop in the central and southern Great Plains
is in need of precipitation and rain also is needed to replenish
soil moisture in the Midwest, where corn, soybean and oat planting
will soon begin.
   Further selling was attributed to internal market influences and
to increasingly bearish expectations for Friday's planted-acreage
estimate and quarterly grain stocks report from the Agriculture
Department.
   ``The combination of the threat of precipitation and that very
important government report just triggered a lot of liquidation,''
said Pat O'Connell, a grain-market analyst with Refco Inc., a large
Chicago-based futures brokerage.
   A new 6-to-10-day National Weather Service forecast issued after
the close called for mostly dry weather in the Great Plains and
parts of the Midwest April 2-6.
   The soybean market appeared to lead the collapse but oats
registered the steepest relative losses. Oats for May and July
delivery fell the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures soared the
5-cents-a-pound limit on the New York Cotton Exchange on buying
linked to reports that some of Florida's largest orange-juice
processors had raised or planned to raise their wholesale prices to
$1.60-$1.65 a pound from $1.50.
   The price increase may cause a scramble for near-term deliveries
but projections for abundant supplies from Brazil should ensure
against supply tightness, said analyst Judy Ganes of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Orange juice settled 4.70 to 5 cents higher with May at $1.609 a
pound.
   Oil futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid supply-shortage fears linked to the massive oil spill in
Alaska. The spill forced a shutdown of Alaska's Port of Valdez,
cutting the pipeline output of Alaskan crude oil by more than half.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .13 cent to .42 cent
higher with May at $20.53 a barrel; heating oil was .86 cent to
1.06 cents higher with April at 57.58 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .35 cent to 1.83 cents higher with April at 59.75
cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures fell on New York's Commodity Exchange,
reflecting a continued easing of inflation fears.
   Gold settled $1.70 to $2.10 lower with April at $391.60 a troy
ounce; silver was 5.7 cents to 6 cents lower with May at $6.003 a
troy ounce.
   Cattle futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, led by a surge of speculative and commercial buying in
the feeder cattle market amid indications strong consumer demand.
   Pork futures ended the day lower with most of the selling

   The massive oil spill that threatens waterfowl
and fish off the Alaska coast is expected to give ammunition to
environmentalists fighting to keep oil developers out of a pristine
arctic wildlife refuge.
   Congress must approve oil exploration in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska where the petroleum industry
believes much oil is hidden.
   President Bush endorsed oil drilling along a 1.5 million acre
coastal strip of the refuge if it can be done within environmental
guidelines, and legislation allowing exploration passed a Senate
committee earlier this month.
   But aides for senators on both sides of the issue suggested
Monday that the momentum is likely to slow considerably in light of
the accident involving the tanker Exxon Valdez and the oil spill in
the environmentally sensitive Prince William Sound.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked Monday about such
speculation, said that ``at this point, we would not try to make
any sweeping judgments based on the oil spill, certainly not policy
judgments.''
   With more than 10 million gallons of oil flowing into the sound,
it is the worst oil spill in U.S. history and threatens waterfowl,
fish, sea otter and other wildlife as well as the Alaska fishing
industry.
   The Exxon oil tanker that ran aground was carrying petroleum
which had been shipped from Alaska's North Slope through the
trans-Alaska pipeline to Valdez and then put aboard the tanker. The
controversy over drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
involves a coastal plain just east of the North Slope oil fields.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate environmental
protection subcommittee, said Monday the spill puts into question
the oil industry's assurances that they can protect the environment.
   ``The oil and gas industries have been very willing to provide
assurances that the (arctic refuge) will be developed in an
environmentally responsible manner,'' said Baucus. ``Unfortunately
the oil spill ... is the latest and most tragic evidence of the gap
that exists between past industry assurances and actual industry
performance in preventing environmental damage.''
   Environmental groups also suggested the accident raises
questions whether there can be oil development and still guarantee
environmental protection as Bush has suggested in his support of
drilling in the refuge.
   ``This (spill) ought to make Congress and President Bush
intensely aware that when you have development you're going to have
environmental consequences. Period. It's a reality,'' said Syd
Butler, a vice president for the Wilderness Society, which has been
lobbying intensely against opening the arctic refuge for drilling.
   David Gardner, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, noted reports
that the Exxon tanker was being handled by a crewman who did not
have proper credentials when it ran aground, and suggested the
episode ``calls into question'' how much priority the oil industry
puts on environmental concerns.
   ``It's pretty clear this kind of disaster is going to happen any
time you have oil development and oil production,'' said Gardner.
   The American Petroleum Institute, in a statement, called the
tanker spill ``a very regrettable situation'' and acknowledged it
may have an impact on pending petroleum legislation, including the
question of drilling in the arctic refuge.
   But Earl Ross, chief spokesman for the industry lobbying group,
said it was ``really much too soon to tell what the reaction is
going to be.''
   Ever since the petroleum industry discovered the possiblity of
large oil and gas deposits under the tundra of the northeastern
Alaska refuge, there has been pressure to open the refuge's coastal
strip for exploratory drilling. Some estimates are that it could
produce as much as 3.2 billion barrels of oil and keep the Alaska
pipeline flowing well after North Slope oil is gone.
   But the refuge also is the breeding ground for North America's
largest remaining herd of migratory caribou and the habitat for
polar bears, musk oxen, wolves, arctic foxes and an assortment of
waterfowl. A recent congressional study suggested that oil
development in the refuge would produce about the same
environmental disruption as has occurred in the North Slope fields.
   Legislation allowing drilling in the refuge cleared the Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee on March 16, but likely will
be debated in the environmental committee before any floor action.
Meanwhile, bills also have been introduced to declare the refuge a
formal wilderness area, which would prohibit oil or gas development.

<TEXT>
   MCorp said Monday it would seek bankruptcy court
protection from creditors, a move that would block an attempt to
force the sale of the troubled banking company but also might
hamper a federal plan to rescue its failing subsidiary banks.
   A filing for protection by MCorp, Texas' second-largest bank
holding company, would supercede a request made last week by three
minor bondholders for an involuntary liquidation of the company.
   The maneuvering comes amid a six-month effort by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. to rescue the 25 banks owned by MCorp,
which has assets totaling about $20 billion and parent company debt
of about $418 million.
   MCorp sought federal recapitalization assistance last October
due to deepening financial losses. MCorp's banks lost $903 million
in 1988, $213 million in the fourth quarter, according to the FDIC.
   MCorp officials have met with noteholders several times since
last fall, urging them not to take action against the company
despite its moratorium on paying debts while it tried to
recapitalize.
   ``MCorp deeply regrets that those noteholders ignored our pleas
not to take premature and unnecessary action,'' Gene H. Bishop,
MCorp chairman and chief executive officer, said in a prepared
statement.
   Mirroring comments by several industry analysts, Robert Rieke,
of Rauscher Pierce and Refsnes, Inc. in Dallas, speculated that the
bondholders decided to seek liquidation of MCorp because of
concerns that the FDIC was moving too slowly in rescuing its banks.
   ``I think a more expedited decision process would have resolved
the problems and the bondholders' fears,'' Rieke said. ``There just
hasn't been any apparent desire by the FDIC to resolve the issues,
and that caused a buildup of uncertainty detrimental to all
involved.''
   FDIC spokesman Steve Katasnos in Washington said FDIC procedures
have been relatively swift.
   ``You're talking about asking someone to buy a banking
organization that has rather substantial losses and a masssive
portfolio to review,'' Katasnos said. ``You don't ask someone to
engage in a multi-million transfer without giving them ample
opportunity to review documents and operations before they submit
an informed bid.''
   The FDIC has set an April 3 deadline for bids.
   Neither the bankruptcy petition nor the company's reorganization
filing should affect bank business, Bishop said.
   The Chapter 7 petitioners were S.N. Phelps &amp; Co., a Greenwich,
Conn., bond broker that claims to hold $2 million principal amount
in MCorp debentures; and Janice M. Eberhardt and Carol R. James,
each of whom claims to hold $5,000 in debentures, according to a
copy of the filing provided by S.N. Phelps.
   S.N. Phelps submitted a claim of $93,750 in interest and Ms.
Eberhardt sought $234.38 in principal payment. James did not list a
claim amount in the petition.
   I. Walton Bader, a New York-based attorney for the holders, told
the Wall Street Journal his clients decided to seek Chapter 7
liquidation for fear that MCorp would be forced to pump holding
company assets into the failing banks, putting the money out of
creditors' reach.
   The FDIC has authority to sell or otherwise dispose of insolvent
banks closed by the Comptroller of the Currency, but a bankruptcy
filing would make any plan to sell the holding company subject to
bankruptcy court approval.
   The request for FDIC assistance appeared to hinge on $400
million set aside by MCorp for the deal. Federal regulators
reportedly wanted that money put into the local banks before they
would consider an assistance package.
   MCorp's creditors indicated they would fight such a move,
apparently fearing a repeat of last year's rescue of Dallas-based
First RepublicBank Corp. Regulators took over that company's
subsidiary banks and left the holding company with almost no assets
to pay off its creditors.
   MCorp has 20 days to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
reorganization after being served with the creditors' petitions for
the involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation, officials said.
   MCorp had not received the petitions by late Monday, said
spokesman George A. McCane. The company learned Friday the petition
had been filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, southern district of New
York.

<TEXT>
   Two leading companies specializing in plant
genetics will merge, officials announced Monday.
   Spokesmen for Calgene Inc. and Plant Genetics Inc., which
operated next door to each other in this university town 75 miles
northeast of San Francisco, said a definitive agreement on the
merger has been signed.
   The deal is subject to approval by shareholders of Plant
Genetics.
   Under the agreement, 2.1 million shares of Calgene common stock
will be issued in exchange for all outstanding shares of Plant
Genetics common stock. Calgene will have 10.3 million shares of
stock after the acquisition is completed in June.
   ``With total revenues of $32.4 million reported by the combined
organizations in 1988 and well-established businesses in four of
the world's most important agricultural crops, Calgene is
positioned to be the leading agricusiness biotechnology company in
the world,'' said Roger Salquist, president of Calgene.
   The combined company, to operate under the name of Calgene, will
hold 20 U.S. patents.
   In 1987, Calgene received the first U.S. Department of
Agriculture permit to test genetically engineered plants and
expects to conduct more than 12 different field trials with five
different genes in three different crops this year.
   ``Uniting Calgene's proven molecular biology and plant
biochemistry leadership and existing portfolio of commercially
valuable agronomic genes with Plant Genetics' plant breeding and
cell biology programs in alfalfa and potato will significantly
expand our proprietary product opportunities,'' said Zachary
Wochock, president of Plant Genetics.

<TEXT>
   American Medical International
Inc., which Monday was weighing a $1.7 billion buyout bid against a
management-proposed reorganization, likely will sell some of its 75
hospitals in either case, analysts said.
   The cash-and-stock bid to take the company private was revealed
Sunday by Dr. M. Lee Pearce, a Miami physician and investor who
owns about 10 percent of American Medical's 72 million shares. The
offer from Pearce and two former American Medical officers, which
presumes acceptance of management, is for $24 a share _ $20 to $22
of that in cash and the rest in securities.
   The buyers would assume $1.4 billion in long-term debt.
   At the same time Pearce's proposal was announced, the company
revealed it was considering a restructuring plan it said would
boost the company's value to $25 to $29 per share. The company
refused to reveal further details of the restructuring.
   A special committee of the board began weighing the proposals
Monday. Spokesman Mick Taylor said the study was expected to take a
few weeks.
   American Medical led the New York Stock Exchange's most-active
list, jumping $3.62{ a share to $21.50.
   The company owns 55 acute-care and psychiatric hospitals in the
United States and 20 oversease in the United Kingdom, Switzerland,
Spain, Greece and Singapore. The domestic hospitals are in 15
states, most of them in California, Florida and Texas. All have AMI
in their names.
   Pearce's offer was made with Shamrock Investments, a Los Angeles
partnership including former American Medical executives Charles
Reilly and Michael Gallagher. It is unrelated to Roy E. Disney's
Shamrock Holdings Inc., which Monday abandoned a bid for Polaroid
Corp.
   American Medical, under pressure from Pearce and others to boost
flat earnings and improve its stock price, has over the last two
years sold more than 40 hospitals and laid off 2,000 employees.
Further efforts to pare the company down to a profitable core
include sale of non-hospital subsidiaries including outpatient
surgery centers, AMICARE Insurance health plans, and alcohol and
drug rehabilitation services.
   Asset sales are likely under either the buyout or the
reorganization, particularly of the company's overseas hospitals.
   Pearce's New York attorney, Seymour Chalif, said the potential
buyers would expect to sell non-core businesses, possibly including
the foreign operations.
   American Medical refused to release any details of its proposed
restructuring, but analysts suggested that plan, too, would involve
sale of assets.
   ``Basically, we're talking about scaling back to a group of the
most attractive hospitals,'' said analyst Rae Alperstein, who
follows the company for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. a Los
Angeles securities firm.
   She called $24 a fair price apresent, but suggested an
aggressive restructuring effort that includes sale of unprofitable
hospitals could boost the company's value into the high $20s per
share in a year.
   Sale of the overseas hospitals could bring $450 million, Ms.
Alperstein estimated.
   In addition to asset sales, the restructuring plan could include
moving the headquarters out of expensive Beverly Hills, a direct
cash dividend to shareholders and a stock buyback, said Todd
Richter, who follows the company for Dean Witter Capital Markets in
New York. He values the company at $25 to $30 a share.
   American Medical reported Friday that its earnings declined to
$18.1 million, or 26 cents per share, for the three months ending
Feb. 28, on revenues of $678.2 million. During the same period a
year earlier, earnings were $24.1 million, or 30 cents per share,
on revenues of $766.1 million.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said
Monday it plans administrative action against convicted former
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. executive Mark L. Stahl that could
bar him from the industry.
   Stahl, who admitted to an $18 million check-kiting scheme, was
sentenced to five years in prison last year on fraud charges.
   According to Lawrence Iason, regional administrator of the SEC's
New York office, a hearing before an administrative law judge will
determine whether Stahl's 1987 conviction on four counts of wire
fraud exposes him to civil SEC sanctions.
   Martin Kuperberg, the SEC's associate regional administrator,
declined to say what specific action the commission would bring
against Stahl, but said options ranged from censure to a permanent
bar from the securities industry.
   He said a tentative earing was scheduled for April 19.
   Employed by Shearson since 1979, Stahl, 46, of Manhattan, was
fired by the firm on the day of his arrest in April 1987.
   He pleaded guilty to fraudulently transferring a total of $1.031
million in Shearson funds to various bank accounts he controlled in
Boston, Hartford, Conn., and Elizabeth, N.J., but admitted
defrauding the firm of a ``litte less'' than $19 million.
   Shearson Lehman Brothers is now known as Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.

   Exxon Corp. is likely to pay willingly for the
cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill to avoid controversy that could
hurt its opportunity to explore for oil in an arctic wildlife
refuge, oil analysts said Monday.
   Exxon is so big that even if it had to pay $100 million out of
its own coffers for the cleanup its earnings would be lowered by
only a nickel a share, said Frank Knuettel, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A bigger priority for the company is winning congressional
approval for oil companies to explore in the pristine Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska, Knuettel said.
   The oil spill from the tanker Exxon Valdez has slowed momentum
for the authorization, which passed a Senate committee earlier this
month, aides to senators on both sides of the issue said Monday.
   ``They'd want to handle this as quickly and efficiently as
possible'' to limit the damage to its image, Knuettel said. ``This
obviously is a setback.''
   The Exxon Valdez, carrying 1.2 million barrels of North Slope
crude oil, ran onto a reef 25 miles from port early Friday.
Estimates put the spill at 240,000 barrels of oil, or about 10.1
million gallons, making it the biggest U.S. spill on record.
   Reflecting investors' lack of concern about the spill, Exxon's
stock closed unchanged at $44.50 a share in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   A long delay in resumption of shipping from the Valdez terminal
could hurt Exxon and other producers if it forced them to cease
production temporarily, cutting into their revenue, said
Constantine Fliakos, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   As for the cleanup itself, Exxon is liable for the first $14
million in damages under terms of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
Authorization Act. Up to $86 million more could be paid out of a
Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund that was funded by tariffs on
oil production by Exxon, British Petroleum Co., Atlantic Richfield
Co. and several smaller Alaska oil producers.
   However, the administrator of the fund, Edwin Powell, said
Monday that the fund could seek reimbursement from Exxon if there
was evidence Exxon was negligent in the spill.
   Powell, who is treasurer of Unocal Corp., said Exxon might
choose to pay the full costs up front if it wanted to avoid a
controversy with the fund over possible negligence. He said he had
not heard from Exxon on the matter.
   Exxon U.S.A. spokesman Les Rogers said Exxon is a party to two
insurance-related agreements, the Tanker Owners Voluntary Agreement
Concerning Liability for Oil Pollution and the Contract Regarding A
Supplement To Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution.
   But Rogers failed to provide information by late Monday on how
those agreements could diminish the cost to Exxon of the cleanup.
   Knuettel said he did not know if Exxon's admission that an
unlicensed third mate was at the helm of the tanker at the time of
the crash could affect its ability to collect on the insurance.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Natural Beverge Corp., the maker of the
Soho Natural Sodas brand founded 12 years ago in a Brooklyn
kitchen, has been sold to the giant beverage company Joseph E.
Seagram &amp; Sons, the companies announced Monday.
   Terms of the all-cash deal were not disclosed.
   American Natural has sold more than 100 million bottles of the
sparkling soft drink with the distinctive label named after
Manhattan's artistic neighborhood. The company had more than $30
million in retail sales last year.
   ``My dream for starting this company was to see this brand
become a major brand,'' said American Beverage founder Sophia
Collier, 33. ``I saw that after 11 years the best way to achieve
that was to sell the company.''
   Collier said she decided to sell American Beverage in November
and began discussions in January with Seagram, the U.S. subsidiary
of The Seagram Co. Ltd. of Canada. The company and its 48 employees
will remain based in New York, she said.
   ``The company was growing but the fact is the soft drink
industry is a multibillion-dollar industry,'' Collier said.
``Sometimes you look over the fence and say, `Gee, if we had
another $10 million to promote this we could really do something.'
   ``My philosophy in starting the company was to make an
alternative to Coke and Pepsi. When I started there were no natural
sodas. I thought, just make wonderful sodas with fruit juice and
natural ingredients.''
   Collier _ an artists's daughter who wrote an autobiography at 19
and drove trucks around New England delivering Soho in the
company's early days _ said she will serve as a consultant and
spokeswoman for the soda, which comes in 12 flavors and is sold in
37 states and Japan.
   Soho won a dispute with Anheuser-Busch Inc. in 1987 over the
soda's distinctive diamond-shaped checkerboard logo, which it
introduced in 1982. Anheuser-Busch agreed in an out-of-court
settlement to drop a similar logo it had used for its own seltzer
product.
   Soho is latest addition to Seagram's empire of sprits, wines,
coolers and juices. The company's brands include Chivas Regal,
Crown Royal and Seagram's V.O. Canadian Whiskies, Mumm and
Perrier-Jouet champagnes, Martell Cognac, Barton &amp; Guestier Wines
and Seagram's Coolers.
   Last year, Seagram agreed to buy Tropicana Pure Premium Orange
Juice from its parent, Beatrice U.S. Food Corp., for $1.2 billion.
   ``Soho Natural Sodas have developed a loyal and growing
following in every market they are sold,'' said C. Richard Coffey,
president of the Seagram Beverage Co., of which Soho will become a
unit.
   ``They have achieved an enormous success because Soho sodas are
classic products sold with classic style,'' he said.
   Seagram reported a 1988 profit of $589.5 million on sales of
$5.1 billion.

<HEAD>Motorola Moves Legal Action Against Hitachi to Texas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. has dropped a federal
patent-infringement lawsuit filed here against Hitachi Ltd., but
has filed a virtually identical lawsuit in Austin, Texas, officials
of the two companies said Monday.
   The lawsuit filed in January in U.S. District Court here alleged
that Hitachi was engaging in unfair competition with its new H-8
microprocessor.
   ``Hitachi does not know why Motorola no longer wishes to pursue
its claims in Chicago, the site of Motorola's national
headquarters,'' said a statement issued by Tokyo-based Hitachi from
Tarrytown, N.Y., home of its Hitachi America Ltd. subsidiary.
   ``Hitachi believes Chicago remains the proper place for these
lawsuits and it will resist Motorola's tactical maneuvers to avoid
the Chicago courts.''
   But spokesman Charles Sengstock of Motorola, which is based in
suburban Schaumburg, said in a telephone interview that Motorola
has two plants in Austin that make the microprocessors involved in
the lawsuit.
   He said the ``procedural move'' to Austin ``focuses the matter
(to) the center of our ... microprocessor activity and the site of
all the documents, evidence and witnesses.''
   Hitachi also has filed a lawsuit against Motorola in the Chicago
court, alleging that the Motorola 68HC11 microcontroller infringes
on a Hitachi patent.
   Sengstock said Motorola is seeking to have the cases combined in
the federal court in Texas.
   Motorola has said that the alleged unfair competition began
shortly after Motorola granted a patent license to Hitachi for
certain Motorola microprocessors in May 1986.
   The company said the Hitachi H-8 microprocessor series infringes
on at least four Motorola patents.
   Hitachi has denied any wrongdoing.
   Sengstock said Motorola would seek an injunction to stop
distribution of the disputed Hitachi microprocessors in the United
States. The lawsuit also seeks unspecified damages, he said.
   Microprocessors are digital electronic devices that perform
control and arithmetic functions in a computer. They often contain
hundreds of thousands of microscopic transistors on silicon chips
about a quarter-inch square.

   Minkow, who founded the now-defunct ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning
company, was convicted of 57 counts of securities, credit card and
mail fraud on Dec. 14. The government's sentencing memorandum
described Minkow as a remorseless liar and thief whose schemes cost
victims more than $100 million.
   In arguments during Monday's hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney
James Asperger said Minkow would probably serve only a third of any
sentence imposed.
   In pleading for a lenient sentence, Minkow compared himself to
former financier Ivan Boesky, who is serving a three-year prison
sentence for his role in the Wall Street insider trading scandal.
   ``This is a great day for this country,'' said Minkow, clad in
blue prison-issue shirt and pants. ``This is a great day for
justice. This is how America works.''
   He commended the FBI, the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and the U.S. attorneys who prosecuted him, saying, ``They got the
right guy. They got the guilty guy.
   ``I see victims here today,'' he said, turning toward the
audience. ``I can only say to them how sorry I am, and I'm going to
get what I've got coming, every bit of it.''
   But the judge was unmoved by Minkow's plea or a similar one by
defense attorney David Kenner, who asked for a sentence of eight to
10 years and psychological counseling for his client.
   ``That would be a joke,'' snapped Tevrizian. ``Here is someone
who has corrupted the financial system. Here is someone who has
lied and cheated. That sentence would be a slap on the wrist.''
   After Minkow's appeal, Tevrizian told him, ``You tell me you're
sorry and I think, `Is he trying to clean my carpet or what?'
   The judge ordered that Minkow serve five years probation
following his release and that the probation would be conditional
on his paying the $26 million restitution as well as any back taxes
or civil judgments against him. The judge also ordered him to
participate in a drug dependency program.
   Kenner said outside court that he would try to get Minkow's
sentence reduced.
   Tevrizian has sentenced 10 other defendants in the case to terms
of a month to eight years.
   In their sentencing memo, Asperger and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Gordon Greenberg said Minkow carried out a ``five-year crime wave''
that ``amounted to a search-and-destroy mission aimed at the trust
and integrity of our financial institutions, securities markets and
the public at large.''
   But Kenner said in a reply memorandum that the young
entrepreneur was a victim himself, browbeaten by mobsters and
emotionally damaged by a ``dysfunctional family'' characterzied by
``physical abuse, emotional neglect, embarassment, secrecy, lying
and mental disorders galore.''
   ``The true story of ZZZZ Best is a young man almost constantly
in debt, struggling to prove that he will not become the failure
depicted by his father,'' Kenner said. ``Look closely and you will
see the picture of a compulsive debtor.''
   Minkow, who launched ZZZZ Best at age 16 in his parents' garage,
has insisted he was a captive of mobsters who took over his company
and forced him to commit fraud.
   The government claimed he was a shrewd con man who convinced
Wall Street investors and TV talk show hosts that he was a teen-age
genius.
   The collapse of ZZZZ Best rocked the volatile U.S. money markets
and exposed the vulnerability of major securities firms and banks,
which bought Minkow's sales pitch and committed millions to his
company.
   At the center of Minkow's confidence scheme was a claim that
ZZZZ Best was making a fortune restoring water- and fire-damaged
buildings. Investors were given badges and hard hats and taken on
tours of alleged restoration projects in abandoned buildings with
which ZZZZ Best had no connection.
   ``The magnitude and seriousness of defendant Minkow's criminal
conduct, coupled with his level of sophistication and ability to
manipulate both his cohorts and victims clearly place him among the
most significant white-collar criminals ever prosecuted on the West
Coast,'' the prosecutors said.
